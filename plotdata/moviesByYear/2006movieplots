2:37
 A contemporary, ensemble drama telling the complex tale of six high school students whose lives are interwoven. All six students have their own personal problems and goals.  The story takes place during a normal school day. At precisely 2:37 a tragic [[suicide]] will occur, affecting the lives of a group of students and their teachers. As the story unfolds, the individual stories of the six teenagers are revealed, each with their own personal significance. This eventually leads up to one of the characters taking their own life. An unwanted [[pregnancy]] unravels a terrible, dark secret; all is not as it appears for the seemingly confident school football hero; an [[outcast (person)|outcast]] must deal with everyday taunts from his peers; a beautiful young girl battles an [[eating disorder]]; a stellar student constantly struggles to win his parents' approval while another uses [[drug]]s to escape from his own demons.  
5ive Girls
 The story takes place at St. Mark's, a [[ Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[boarding school]] for girls. One day, a young student, Elizabeth, is studying in a classroom on the third floor when, without warning, she is attacked by unseen evil forces. One of St. Mark's priests, Father Drake, attempts to save Elizabeth from the apparently [[demon]]ic aggressor, but he quickly proves to be powerless against it, and the girl vanishes without a trace.  The school is immediately shut down, and all of the students are removed from campus by worried families. Five years later, the school reopens. A harsh [[Head teacher|headmistress]], Miss Pearce, rules the girls with an iron fist; Father Drake remains at the school as a teacher, but, because of Elizabeth's disappearance, he has become a drunkard, and was found by Miss Pearce at a bar. Five troubled and unwanted girls are left by their families at the school: Alex, Mara, Cecilia (who is blind), Leah, and Connie. The girls are strictly forbidden to go to the third floor (the site of Elizabeth's disappearance). Cecilia and Mara enter the third floor, prompting Miss Pearce to punish the responsible party. Alex takes the blame and is severely beaten with a ruler.  Alex begins to have visions of Elizabeth being [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by a demon. Other strange things begin to happen, revealing that all five girls possess supernatural gifts. Connie is a "conduit", or a magnet for spirit activity, Leah can pass through objects (though not doors or walls), Cecilia has "[[second sight]]" or what the viewer could interpret as ESP, Mara can heal recent wounds (she heals Alex after her beating), and Alex has [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]].  It is revealed that Miss Pearce has brought the girls to the school for a very specific reason and is seen conjuring them to a pentagram on the third floor, after which Connie appears to be possessed. Connie attempts to drown Leah and the demon passes into her while Connie falls dead. The possessed Leah (who can now pass through doors) goes to confront Father Drake, at which time the name of the demon is revealed: [[Legion (demon)|Legion]]. They argue, Father Drake attempts to exorcise her, and Leah uses her newfound demon powers to stab him with gold crucifixes. Alex, Mara, and Cecilia have been reading Elizabeth's journal, which appeared after Connie's possession, and have learned enough about Legion to know that they need to escape. They split up to search for the others, Mara finding Father Drake, Alex finding Connie, and Cecilia running into the demon.  After a prolonged fight where Cecilia is severely bloodied and Leah's head is smashed in with a book, Legion moves on to Cecilia and grants her "first sight". Terrified, Mara and Alex try to flee, but Ms. Pearce locks them in and breaks Mara's healing hand. It is revealed that Ms. Pearce is Elizabeth's sister, and is trying to save her from Legion. Mara and Alex then hole up in the bedroom and use Connie's spellbook to create a protective circle. Cecilia/Legion finds them and, while she cannot initially penetrate the circle, uses her own blood to cover over the lines and then possesses Mara.  Miss Pearce is in another part of the building, chanting. Elizabeth's body slowly begins to appear before vanishing again. Mara is chasing Alex, who gets stabbed in the stomach. Miss Pearce begs Legion to let Elizabeth go, but is told that they only have four girls and the deal was for five. Alex then uses her own powers of telekinesis to force Legion out of Mara and into Miss Pearce before ramming the demon's head through a crucifix. Mara and Alex collapse and, presumably several hours later, Mara awakes and heals herself, but is unable to heal Alex in time. She begins to leave and encounters Virgil (a man in monkish robes, who appears to be a type of groundskeeper and is seen briefly throughout the movie). Elizabeth comes running down the stairs, whole and alive, and greets him as father (cue Mara's exit). He is happy and excited, until a bloody Miss Pearce grabs him by the throat and transfers Legion to him. Elizabeth screams and cries as the film ends.

9mm Sunrise
 ''9mm Sunrise'' follows its lead character Jack Quick as he foils the plans of two battling gang lords who are attempting to start a gang war on the streets of [[Hollywood, California]].  As is apparent in all Scott Shaw films this film follows a non-linear storyline and presents images of Hollywood, California, including the [[Hollywood Sign]] and the [[Capitol Records Building]]. Several of the scenes for this film were shot on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] at night. This film also presents scenes filmed in [[Los Angeles Union Station]]. This railway hub was built in 1939 and is considered to be "The last of America's great rail stations.”  It was created in an [[art deco]] style of [[architecture]] and is a very visual location that has been featured in many films and [[music videos]]. Union Station is also a commonly presented location in the films of Scott Shaw.  This film is riddled with the unexpected characters, storyline twists and the music video style edits apparent in all Scott Shaw films.  One character is a human [[rag doll]] that walks as if she has no bones.  Also included in the characters of this film are a [[motorcycle|biker]], a [[vampire]], a [[prostitute]], and several [[assassination|assassin]] characters. Shaw frequently references all of these characters in his films.  This film is considered a "Zen Film" in that it was created in the distinct style of filmmaking formulated by Scott Shaw known as [[Zen Filmmaking]]. In this style of filmmaking no scripts are used.  
9/Tenths
 The film takes place sometime in the not too distant future where terrorist attacks are on the rise and cities are the primary targets. Jessica ([[Gabrielle Anwar]]) and husband William ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]) have fled the city amid the increasing terrorist threats. William is excited to relocate to his newly purchased ranch hundreds of miles from nowhere. Jessica reluctantly humors her husband and his paranoid fears by going along.  On their arrival, William and Jessica discover someone already living in their house. Elias (Dave Baez) proves quite an intimidating presence when the couple discovers him in their kitchen butchering a freshly killed animal. But Elias soon explains in his broken English that he was the caretaker for the previous owner who had promised to let him continue living there as a reward for his services.  William knows of no such arrangement and quickly attempts to get rid of this man he sees as nothing more than a trespasser. Elias sees the couple the same way and develops his own ideas about sending them back to the city. Meanwhile, it quickly becomes obvious that William is of little use in this rustic environment that Elias calls home. Even a simple task like fixing a broken water heater is beyond William's range of expertise. "I pay people to do these things for me," he blurts out. Obviously successful in the professional world, William is at a loss in his newfound sanctuary. William's frustration festers as he observes Elias's adroitness with such tasks.  Just as the property dispute escalates to a dangerous level, the three hear parts of an emergency radio broadcast indicating that an extremely large terrorist attack has caused widespread, catastrophic destruction in the world around them.  The three are cut off from everything, completely in the dark as to whether anybody at all, is left alive in the area, the country or even the world. Civilization as they have to know it may have ended.  This alters the dynamic between the pampered city couple that are totally invested in what is known as civilization, and the self-sufficient Elias.  As time goes by and the couple's supplies diminish, Elias, formerly a second-class citizen at best, finds himself in a position of power since he is the only one with the skills needed to survive.  This change in events brings forward Elias attraction to Jessica which is intertwined with the desperate circumstances, leading all three down a frightening and depraved path none would have ever expected.

  [[Hansel and Gretel]] are lost in the forest. Gretel thinks to see a dwarf in the bushes but it is a disgusting humanlike creature. It scares Hansel and Gretel who run further into the woods. Bubi appears not much later and he asks the creature his name. The creature only reveals to be "The Evil One" and nobody else knows his real name. Bubi sneakily follows the creature and witnesses how it dances around a fire singing a song in which he mentions his real name.  The story moves to the castle where [[Snow White]] lives. She became a mother. Her husband, the [[jester]], left a year ago to buy some cigarettes in a nearby shop. Snow White wonders why this takes so long. The Evil One suddenly enters the castle and claims the child. The day before Spliss, one of Snow White guards, rescued The Evil One from a trap. The Evil One wanted to thank Spliss by giving him a wish. Spliss wished to have a beautiful haircut which he got. However, Spliss did not like the color and wanted to have it blond. The Evil One agreed on condition Spliss signs a contract so Snow White's child will become his property. Snow White asks The Evil One if the contract can be undone. The Evil One agrees nor or less: if someone can reveal his real name within 48 hours, Snow White can keep the child.  Snow White seeks for the dwarves, but is surprised only Bubi still lives in the cabin. Bubi explains this is Snow White her own fault. Some time ago she visited the dwarves telling them her husband is missing. She wanted to find a new man and this could be even a dwarf. There was one main condition: the man must have a successful career. Not much later all dwarves left except Bubi. Snow White is a bit surprised she can't remember her visit. Snow White asks Bubi to reunite the dwarves and to find the name of The Evil One.  The six other dwarves work in a nearby town. Cookie, Cloudy and Sunny have their own inn. Speedy is chief of the fire department. Ralfie works at the brewer. Tschakko exterminates vermin. Bubi finds them all to convince them to help Snow White. According to them, there is only one man who can help them: The Wise Grey. The dwarves can't find him. According his diary, he left for "The Fishing Palace" in another world. The dwarves find the magical mirror which once belonged to the former queen. They jump into the mirror and end up in the other world: modern [[Germany]].  In the meantime, The Evil One arrives at the candy house of the witch, who is actually the former queen. The Evil One follows a therapy. The queen says she cannot remember three things: names, faces and a third other thing she does not know anymore. As the witch always forgets the real name of The Evil One, last one writes it down on a paper: [[Rumpelstiltskin]]. He puts the paper in an envelope and hides it in the witch her [[magical text|conjuring book]]. The Evil One tells Snow White her baby will soon be his although he is afraid someone is in search for his real name. The witch uses her [[crystal ball]] and discovers the dwarves set up a mission. As she is still mad on the dwarves and Snow White she sends The Evil One to the other world to boycott the dwarves. The Evil One is gifted: he is a [[shapeshifting|shape shifter]].  The dwarves find The Wise Grey in some sort of [[fish and chips]]-stand. He does know The Evil One but never heard his real name. He does know the dwarves should look for it in the witches' candy house. The dwarves return to their own world by using a magic mirror in the railway station. In meantime, The Evil One tried unsuccessfully to stop the dwarves.  The dwarves head to the candy house where the witch tried to make her invisible. The Evil One is also present. The dwarves use a tricky way to obtain the envelope with The Evil One's real name. They all go to Snow White. However, The Evil One gave the dwarves an envelope with another name so the dwarves think his real name is [[Mother Hulda]]. They realize it was not Snow White who visited them to tell she is in search for a new man, but The Evil One. Eventually, Bubi says the real name is Rumpelstiltskin. He knew this the whole time and tried to tell but nobody let him speak. The dwarves also meet their former head dwarf Brummboss who became a king at the end of Männer allein im Wald. The king asks if he can become a dwarf again. This is rejected by the others as there are already seven dwarves.  
16 Blocks
 Jack Mosley ([[Bruce Willis]]) is an alcoholic, burned-out [[New York City Police Department|N.Y.P.D.]] detective. Despite a late shift the night before, his lieutenant orders him to escort a witness, Eddie Bunker ([[Mos Def]]), from local custody to the courthouse 16 blocks away to testify on a police corruption case before a grand jury at 10 a.m. Bunker tries to be friendly with Mosley, telling him of his aspirations to move to Seattle to become a cake baker with his sister who he has never met, but Mosley is uninterested, and stops at a liquor store. They are suddenly ambushed by a gunman, and Mosley drags Bunker to a local bar to take shelter and call for backup. Mosley's former partner, Frank Nugent ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), and several other officers arrive. Nugent and his men are part of the corruption scheme, and he tells Mosley that Bunker is not worth defending as his testimony will likely expose several corrupt officers, including Nugent. The corrupt cops try to frame Bunker for firing at an officer before they try to kill him. Mosley intervenes, rescuing Bunker and fleeing.  Mosley briefly stops at his sister Diane's ([[Jenna Stern]]) apartment to retrieve guns and ammo, and learns the police have already approached her about his activities earlier that day. He and Bunker take steps to further elude the police, and Mosley is wounded in the process.  They become cornered in a run-down apartment building as Nugent and his men search floor by floor. Mosley calls the district attorney to arrange for help, but purposely gives the wrong apartment number, suspecting there is a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] involved. Mosley and Bunker are able to escape onto a passenger bus, and as the police follow them, Mosley is forced to treat the passengers as hostages. The bus crashes into a construction site and is soon surrounded by the [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit|ESU]]. Aware that Nugent will likely order the ESU to raid the bus, risking the safety of the passengers, Mosley allows the passengers to go free, using their cover to allow Bunker to sneak off the bus in the confusion.  Mosley finds a tape recorder in the discarded possessions on the bus, and prepares a farewell message to Diane.  To his surprise, Bunker returns to the bus; while Nugent is ready to fire on him, Nugent is made to stand down by a superior officer. Bunker has come to see Mosley as his friend and wants to be there for him to see this through. Bunker's tenacity convinces Mosley to get to the courthouse, and he manages to drive the bus into an alley, temporarily blocking the police from following them. He finds that Bunker has been wounded, and calls Diane, a [[paramedic]], to bring an ambulance around to help, despite knowing she will be followed. Diane cares for Mosley and Bunker's wounds, though Bunker still needs further treatment at a hospital. As Diane's ambulance drives away, the police stop her but discover the ambulance is empty; she had a second ambulance pick up Mosley and Bunker that would not be under similar surveillance. Meanwhile, Mosley reveals to Bunker that should he testify, not only will Nugent be convicted but so would Mosley as one of the corrupt cops. Mosley gets off a block from the courthouse and wishes Bunker luck with his bakery, instructing the paramedic to take Bunker to the Port Authority and put him on a bus for Seattle. Bunker promises to send him a cake on his birthday.  Mosley continues to the courthouse, where the police and ESU are waiting for him, as well as the district attorney. Mosley enters the courthouse building through the underground garage, encountering Nugent alone, who tries unsuccessfully to dissuade him from testifying in Bunker's place. Mosley enters the courthouse proper, where one of Nugent's men ([[David Zayas]]) tries to shoot Mosley but is killed by one of the ESU snipers. Mosley informs the district attorney that he will testify in exchange for Bunker having his record expunged, also revealing that he had recorded the conversation with Nugent in the garage on the tape recorder, which he submits as evidence.  Two years later, Mosley is freed from prison. He celebrates his birthday with Diane and other friends, and is surprised to find that the cake had indeed come from Bunker, who has been successful in starting "Eddie & Jack's Good Sign Bakery" in Seattle.

13 Beloved
  A [[Boy Scout]] is standing at the crosswalk of a busy intersection in Bangkok and sees an elderly woman carrying some bags, struggling to make her way across the street. The woman drops some of her belongings, and as the seconds tick away before the lights will change, the boy runs out to assist the woman. In the confusion, he drops his mobile phone, and leaves it in the street while he helps the woman to safety. Just as the light changes and traffic starts to rush forward, the boy runs out to retrieve his phone, where he is hit by a bus and killed.  The scene then shifts to [[protagonist]] Phuchit Puengnathong (ภูชิต พึ่งนาทอง)<ref></ref> ([[Krissada Terrence|Krissada Sukosol Clapp]]), a struggling [[Yamaha Corporation]] salesman. He arrives at a potential client's school to find that a co-worker from his firm has already made the sale. His girlfriend, Maew, has recently dumped him to become a pop star. He lives alone in a small apartment. The next morning, he finds that his car has been repossessed. He arrives at work and is called into his boss's office, and is forced to resign due to his lack of sales.  He goes out to the stairwell to gather his thoughts and have a cigarette. He then discovers he has no more. He has a big stack of overdue bills from credit companies. However, his mobile phone is still working. His mother calls. She needs some money to pay for his younger brother's schooling. Puchit agrees to send her some money.  Angrily, he crumples his credit-card statements and bills and throws them to the floor. His phone rings again. The caller says Phuchit has a chance to win 10,000 [[Thai baht|baht]]. Phuchit is ready to hang up, thinking the call is cruel joke being played on him by his co-workers or friends. But then the caller tells Phuchit his full name, age, employment status and other details that makes Phuchit stay on the line. To win the 10,000 baht, all he has to do is swat a fly which is at that very moment buzzing around him and has been pestering him the whole time he's been sitting in the stairwell. The caller even says there is a rolled up newspaper nearby. Phutchit grabs the paper and swats the fly.  He immediately receives a message that 10,000 baht has been transferred to his bank account. His phone immediately rings again. The caller says Phuchit will win more money if he eats the dead fly. He goes back to his desk, holding the fly while debating whether to eat it. One of his co-workers, a friend, Tong (Achita Sikamana), comes to see him, just as he pops the fly into his mouth. She is stunned and is not sure what to say to him.  Phuchit receives another phone call. The caller explains that if he completes 11 more tasks, he will win 100 million baht. Needing the money, Phuchit reluctantly agrees to the play the game. The caller explains that if he quits the game or anyone discovers that he's playing the game, he'll forfeit all his winnings so far.  {| cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" style="width:30%; float:left; border: 2px solid #aaa; font-size:90%; padding:4px; margin:0 1em; background-color: #f9f9f9;clear:;" |- |align="center"|'''Phuchit's 13 tasks''' |- | #Kill a fly. #Swallow the fly. #Make three children cry. #Beat up a beggar and take his money. #Eat a plate of feces served to him in Chinese restaurant. #Give mobile phone to mentally unstable man at bus stop and then take another mobile phone from gang of youths on bus No. 6. #Retrieve man's corpse from well. #Beat ex-girlfriend Maew's new boyfriend with a chair. #Find old woman in hospital and escort her from the building while evading police. #String up wire clothesline across highway, which decapitates several motorcyclists. #Kill Tong or her dog (Phuchit kills the dog). #Slaughter cow and find a key in the intestines. #Kill John Adams (hooded man in wheelchair). |} For the third stunt, he is told he must make some children cry. This act makes Phuchit recall his childhood, in which his father crushed his toys by stomping on them; Phuchit's father, a [[farang]] named John Adams (Philip Wilson), had married his Thai mother (Sukulya Kongkawong). Next, Phuchit must steal coins from a beggar.  For his fifth stunt, Phuchit is told to go to a fine Chinese restaurant. He is brought a covered plate that contains feces and he is told that he must eat it. This makes Phuchit recall when some bullies tried to make him eat dog feces when he was a child.  The stunts grow increasingly degrading, unlawful and deadly. His sixth is to fight with a gang of school-age thugs while riding a public bus in order to get another mobile phone. He must jump down a well and drag up the corpse of a dead man. He has to beat up his ex-girlfriend Maew's new boyfriend with a chair. Next, he must break an elderly woman (the same old woman from the first scene) out of a hospital. The game causes Phuchit to recall his childhood, when he was beaten by his cruel farang father, was taunted by bullies and other bad memories.  Meanwhile, Phuchit's friend Tong is concerned about the strange behavior she witnessed earlier in the office and later in the Chinese restaurant, and putting together clues overheard at the police station, she goes to her computer at work and gets on the internet. A computer expert, she manages to hack into a website for a game called ''13''. However, unbeknownst to her, she is being watched, and unwittingly, she is made part of the game.  A police detective, Surachai, also becomes involved, and comes close to catching Phuchit. However, Phuchit evades capture, and a higher-ranking police official orders Surachai to call off the pursuit.  Eventually, Tong's life is put at risk. She discovers the place where the game is being run from, and confronts the game's mastermind, a young boy named Kie, who tells Tong he is powerless to stop the game, saying he is "just a component" in the live, underground reality game involves players and viewers that perhaps number in the thousands.  Phuchit finds himself confronted by his father John Adams, who is strapped in a wheelchair, wearing a straitjacket and appears to be unconscious. To win the 100 million baht, Phuchit must stab Adams with a butcher knife. Phuchit is unable to do this; Adams stabs Phuchit to death, therefore winning his game. Tong screams at Kie, and Kie leaves as his minions hold her. Tong later wakes up on a bus bench and is found by Surachai.

  In 481 BC, one year before the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], Dilios, a [[hoplite]] in the [[Spartan Army]], begins his story by depicting the life of [[Leonidas I]] from childhood to kingship via [[Agoge|Spartan doctrine]]. Dilios's story continues and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] messengers arrive at the gates of [[Sparta]] demanding "[[earth and water]]" as a token of submission to [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]] - the Spartans reply by killing and kicking the messengers into a well. Leonidas then visits the [[Ephor]]s, proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the [[Thermopylae|Hot Gates]]. His plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea. The Ephors consult [[Pythia|the Oracle]], who decrees that Sparta will not go to war during the [[Carneia]]. As Leonidas angrily departs, a messenger from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors for their covert support.  Although the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Sparta's army, Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal [[bodyguard]]. They are joined along the way by [[Arcadia]]ns. At Thermopylae, they construct the wall made up of stones and slain Persian scouts as [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]], angering the Persian Emissary. Stelios, an elite Spartan soldier, orders him to go back to the Persian lines and warn Xerxes after cutting off his whipping arm.  Meanwhile, Leonidas encounters [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]], a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain [[Sparta#Society|infanticide]]. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father's name by joining Leonidas' army, warning him of a secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic, Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough, potentially compromising the [[phalanx formation]], and Ephialtes is enraged.  The battle begins soon after the Spartans' refusal to lay down their weapons. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage, as well as their superior fighting skills, the Spartans repel wave after wave of the advancing Persian army. During a lull in the battle, Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender, offering him wealth and power in exchange for his allegiance. Leonidas declines and mocks Xerxes for the inferior quality of his fanatical warriors. In response, Xerxes sends in his elite guard, the [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|Immortals]], later that night. Despite some Spartans being killed, they heroically defeat the Immortals, with slight help from the Arcadians.  On the second day, Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian city-states, including [[war elephants]], to crush the Spartans once and for all, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth, luxury, women, and a uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes' betrayal, but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened, a "tale of victory".  In Sparta, [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] tries to persuade the [[Gerousia|Spartan Council]] to send reinforcements to aid the 300. Theron, a corrupt politician, claims that he "owns" the Council and threatens the Queen, who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces her in front of the Council, Gorgo kills him out of rage, revealing within his robe a bag of Xerxes' gold. Marking his betrayal, the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day, the Persians, led by Ephialtes, traverse the secret path, [[Last stand|encircling the Spartans]]. Xerxes' [[General officer|general]] again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas rises and throws his spear at Xerxes; barely missing him, the spear cuts across and wounds his face, proving the [[Sacred king|God-King]]'s mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage.  Dilios, now back at Sparta, concludes his tale before the Council. Inspired by Leonidas' sacrifice, Greece mobilizes. One year later, the Persians face an army of 30,000 free Greeks led by a vanguard of 10,000 Spartans. After one final speech commemorating the 300, Dilios, now head of the Spartan Army, leads them to war, against the Persians across the fields of [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].  
.45 (film)
 Big Al ([[Angus Macfadyen]]), and his girlfriend Kat ([[Milla Jovovich]]), are small-time crooks dealing in guns and stolen goods in [[Queens]], [[New York City]]. They seem to have a fun relationship full of sex and booze. Living in a shabby apartment, they both traffic in illegal handguns, while also cleverly avoiding the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] and [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]]. However, Vic ([[Sarah Strange]]), Kat's best friend (and ex-lover) still has a crush on her, hates Big Al and doesn't approve of the relationship.  Big Al is almost arrested in a police sting, but is released when they realize he is unarmed...as Kat was holding the guns.  Returning home, they catch a thief trying to take their new TV out the window, and Big Al gives him a beating.  They call the police and berate them for not catching the 'real crooks', all the while surrounded by the stolen goods that are their livelihood.  Meeting up with his old partner Reilly ([[Stephen Dorff]]) they steal a car as Al tries to convince him to come back to help Al run the gun business.  However, Kat has plans on her own; she wants to sell guns on her own to provide since she wants to move out of Queens and into a classier neighborhood, maybe by the beach. She meets up with Jose ([[Vincent Laresca]]), a drug dealer and Big Al's rival, and sells him a gun. However, Clancy (Tony Munch), a local snitch working for Al, notices them. Kat returns home and pretends to have been out with Vic, upsetting Al.  When Jose brazenly comes to Al's local bar, and comes on to Kat, Al, Clancy, and their friends punish him by appearing to cut off his fingers. Al comes home later and based on comments from Clancy, accuses Kat of having sex with the 'spic'.  He forces her to confess to lying to him and then beats her up, leaving her with a black eye and bleeding lip and even cuts off chunks of her hair.  After he leaves the apartment the next day, Vic and Reilly come over to console her, swearing revenge, but Al arrives home and in the ensuing scuffle, AL fires a shot that grazes Kat, and is arrested and detained.  At the police precinct, Kat is questioned by Liz ([[Aisha Tyler]]), a member of an battered women`s group that offers protection via sanctuary or court order.  Liz explains that Al doesn't really love her, and she used to be in an abusive marriage of her own.  However, Kat refuses to press charges, but ultimately decides to leave.  However, Big Al sneaks in through the window as she is packing, threatens her with death if she ever leaves, and saying there is nowhere she can hide from him.  When Liz and Vic arrive to take her, he convinces Kat to tell them she wants to stay.  Liz threatens to `end him` if he ever touches Kat, but they ultimately leave without her.  While convincing Al the relationship is back the way it was, she secretly devises a plan; seeming to seduce Vic, Reilly, Jose and Liz, and telling each of them she`ll go anything to be rid of Big Al. After convincing Al to stay home one evening, a hooded figure takes Big Al's special jacket with his name on it, and his registered .45 handgun, and shoots Clancy.  The next day, Big Al goes into church and threatens the priest, Father Duffel ([[Hardie Lineham]]), saying he abhors weakness.  Leaving, he is arrested for Clancy's murder as a crowd of locals watch from across the street, Kat, Vic, and Reilly among them.  Later at the police station, Big Al begs Kat to find the real killer, knowing he has been set up, but can't figure out who did it.  Slowly Kat reveals that she is behind the plot, and is now in charge. Later, Reilly and Vic discuss who the killer is, and then realize they both fear the hard change in Kat, and decide to start a relationship together.  Soon enough, Kat meets up with the hooded killer: it was Liz.  Kissing, Liz says now they can be together but Kat explains she only used her, and thanks her for her advice about being a strong woman (`Lips, tits, hips`) and leaving Liz heartbroken. Kat picks up the gun business and the film ends with her narrating the whole story, from the beach neighborhood she wanted to live in, before walking away.

200 Pounds Beauty
 Hanna Kang is an overweight [[phone sex]] part-timer and a [[ghost singer]] for Ammy, a famous pop singer who actually [[lip sync]]s instead of being famous for her own vocal talent. Other than that, Hanna has a huge crush for Sang-jun who's a director and whose arrogant father owns the entertainment company. One day, Ammy purposely insults Hanna's weight in front of Sang-jun during his birthday party, knowing well that Hanna likes him. While crying in the restroom, Hanna overhears Sang-jun telling Ammy that even though they are just using Hanna for her voice, they must be kind to her so she will not walk out on them. Heartbroken, Hanna attempts suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from one of her phone sex regulars who is a top plastic surgeon. She persuades him to perform a head-to-toe plastic surgery operation on her. Hanna puts herself in seclusion for a year as she recovers from the changes from the surgery and weight loss.  When she comes back from the hospital, Hanna is incredibly beautiful and slender, that even her best friend Jung-min cannot recognize her at first. With Jung-min's help, Hanna creates a new identity for herself; she is now a Korean-American from California named Jenny. After auditioning to be Ammy's secret vocalist again, she earns her own recording contract instead from Sang-jun, claiming that she is "all-natural". In the meantime, Ammy desperately tries to find Hanna by spending time with Hanna's father who is in a hospital due to mental problems, possibly [[Alzheimer's]]. Sang-jun orders Ammy to give up her search for Hanna and give Jenny a chance to help him finish her album. Ammy refuses out of fear for possible competition for album sales with Jenny and is determined to find Hanna because she will come back to her like always. After many encounters with Jenny, they both realize that Jenny is actually Hanna.  Jenny's debut single "[[Maria (Blondie song)|Maria]]" becomes a hit and in the party to celebrate it, Ammy brings Hanna's father in an attempt to blow her cover. Desperate to keep her true identity a secret, Hanna ignores her father. Jung-min gets furious about her indifferent behavior. After the party, Sang-jun reveals to Jenny that he knows her true identity but is now cold and distant. He seems unable to forgive her for lying to him but says that he will conduct her concert scheduled the next day. Hanna also confesses her love for him that made her to do such a thing. After realizing how worthless she was to him even as Jenny, Hanna tearfully refuses to have anything to do with him and leaves. When she tells the plastic surgeon about it, he makes Hanna realize that she's better off without Sang-jun. Before the concert, Ammy threatens Sang-jun that she will reveal Jenny`s deception if the concert was not cancelled. Even his father agrees and confronts Sang-jun for the deception after being sent photos by Ammy. He orders the release of Hanna’s X-Rated CD covers and the discontinuation of the concert, not wanting to lose money. Sang-jun stands up against her threat and his father's orders by refusing to cancel it. Sang-jun encourages a distraught Hanna to do this concert, not for the sake of the fans or the company but for herself. At the concert, Hanna proceeds tearfully to tell the large crowd her story: that she was a ghost singer to an ungrateful Ammy while she was overweight, how she went into a year of seclusion to heal from the changes from the surgery and that she has abandoned everything that is dear to her, including her best friend and father, to get to where she is. Sang-jun plays a tape of the old, obese Hanna, singing. The crowd, moved by her sincere confession, responds by chanting "It's okay". Hanna rekindles her relationships with her father and best friend. She drops the stage-name Jenny and re-releases a CD with her own name, Hanna, and becomes a highly successful music artist. Despite her having moved on from her crush on him, Sang-jun realizes the very thing about Hanna that had always drawn him to her was Hanna's innocence, and continues to promote her. It's also implied without the supportive fans and exposure of her lack of singing voice, Ammy has faded into obscurity.  During the post credits, Jung-min also asks to get a head-to-toe plastic surgery from the surgeon.

The house seems to change at random between a state of dilapidation and a state of domestication.

His gifts do not extend to grades, however, and he receives rejection letters from all of the colleges to which he applies, including those with high acceptance rates. In an attempt to gain approval from his strict father ([[Mark Derwin]]), Bartleby creates a fake college, the South Harmon Institute of Technology (S.H.I.T.). His best friend, Sherman Schrader III ([[Jonah Hill]]), who has been accepted into his father's ([[Jim O'Heir]]) prestigious alma mater, Harmon College, aids Bartleby and fellow reject Rory Thayer ([[Maria Thayer]]), who only applied to [[Yale University]] and was rejected due to [[legacy preferences]]; Darryl "Hands" Holloway ([[Columbus Short]]), who lost his athletic scholarship after an injury; and Glen ([[Adam Herschman]]), who failed his [[SAT Reasoning Test|SAT exam]] due to vacuity. To make the "college" seem legitimate, Bartleby convinces Sherman to create a functional website for the school.  When his father insists on meeting the dean, Bartleby hires Sherman's peculiar uncle, Ben Lewis ([[Lewis Black]]), a former Harmon College professor, to play that role, and he leases an abandoned [[psychiatric hospital]] adjacent to Harmon College and renovates it to look like a college campus. Their plan backfires when the website, which automatically accepts any applicant, enrolls hundreds of other rejected students. Bartleby realizes that these people have nowhere else to go, so he lets them believe that the school is real, a place where they will finally feel accepted, despite objections from his friends. After a visit to Harmon disenchants him with traditional college life, he has the students create their own curricula. Students write down what they want to learn on a giant whiteboard, ranging from the culinary arts, sculpting, meditations, to unusual courses such as [[psychokinesis]], a subject one eccentric kid ([[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]]) wishes to study.  Bartleby creates a school newspaper (the ''S.H.I.T. Rag''), invents a mascot (the S.H.I.T. Sandwiches), and throws themed parties, turning South Harmon into a [[party school]]. Meanwhile, the [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] dean of Harmon College, Richard Van Horne ([[Anthony Heald]]), makes plans to construct the Van Horne Gateway, a park-like "verdant buffer zone" adjacent to the college that the dean hopes will "keep knowledge in and ignorance out". He dispatches Hoyt Ambrose ([[Travis Van Winkle]]) to free up the nearby properties, but when Bartleby refuses to relinquish the lease for the South Harmon property, Hoyt sets to work trying to reveal the college as a fake. The dispute turns personal, since Bartleby has been vying for the affections of Hoyt's ex-girlfriend, Monica Moreland ([[Blake Lively]]). Hoyt exposes South Harmon as a fake institution through Sherman, who is attempting to join Hoyt's [[fraternity]] as a legacy, but is constantly humiliated and abused by them. After debasing Sherman once more, the fraternity violently forces him to hand over all the files he has created for South Harmon.  Hoyt contacts all the students' parents, and with Van Horne, he reveals that the school is a sham. Soon after, the school is forced to close, but Sherman, who has had enough with Harmon College's corruption, files for accreditation on behalf of South Harmon, giving Bartleby a chance to make his college legitimate. At the subsequent State of Ohio [[educational accreditation]] hearing, Bartleby makes an impassioned speech about the failures of conventional education and the importance of following one's own passions, convincing the board to grant his school a one-year probationary accreditation to test his new system, thus foiling Van Horne's schemes. The college reopens, with more students enrolling, including Sherman and Monica. In addition, Bartleby finally earns the approval of his father, who is proud that his son now owns a college. As the film closes, Van Horne walks to his car in the parking lot, only to watch it suddenly explode. Bartleby watches in astonishment as the eccentric student from earlier makes his interest in psychokinetic explosion a reality.  
Abominable
 The film begins with a [[farmer]] named Billy Hoss ([[Rex Linn]]) and his wife Ethel ([[Dee Wallace]]) waking up in the middle of the night to unusual noises. They and their dog Sparky go outside to investigate, where they find a [[horse]] lying dead, violently ripped open. Their dog runs into the dark, and is attacked (and presumably killed off-screen), causing Billy and Ethel to run back in the house where they see a mysterious giant figure behind their home. Once the creature is gone, they come out again and find large [[footprints]] on the ground.  Shortly thereafter, a man bound in a [[wheelchair]] named Preston Rogers ([[Matt McCoy (actor)|Matt McCoy]]) stays in a [[cottage]] in the local woods while being watched and nursed by Otis Wilhelm ([[Christien Tinsley]]). A group of city girls named Karen ([[Ashley Hartman]]), Michelle ([[Natalie Compagno]]), C.J. ([[Karin Anna Cheung]]), Tracy ([[Tiffany Shepis]]), and Amanda ([[Haley Joel]]) arrive in a [[jeep]] with plans to celebrate Karen's upcoming marriage in the house next door. Though things may look peaceful, Preston, who lost his wife in the climbing accident that crippled him, begins to see something mysterious happening in these woods.  As night falls, a group of hunters, including Billy and a gas station clerk named Buddy ([[Jeffery Combs]]) who met Otis and Preston earlier, are out looking for the same monster that came to Billy's home, which they believe to be a deranged [[Bigfoot|Sasquatch]] ([[Michael Deak]]). Ziegler Dane ([[Lance Henriksen]]), the third of the party, investigates when Buddy claims to have heard noises. He finds a cave and discovers Karen, who went missing when Preston saw something grab her. She is mortally wounded with her stomach torn open. When she is dragged away and killed, Dane runs out and warns the others. They open fire. One by one, the hunters are grabbed by the hiding monster and killed.  Preston tries to contact the local police after what happened to Karen. He sees that the remaining girls are looking for her. After trying to call the police, they head inside and promise to search for her later. But the Sasquatch returns and attacks Tracy, who had just finished taking a shower. As the monster pulls Tracy through a small window, snapping her in half and killing her, Preston tries to get Otis to see the creature, but it disappears. A disbelieving Otis attempts to [[sedate]] Preston, but Preston turns the tables and tranquilizes Otis. Preston then looks out a window: the creature appears, roaring at him.  After fainting in terror from seeing the beast up close, Preston wakes up, only to find that the police led by Sheriff Halderman ([[Paul Gleason]]) have responded to his initial inquiry, only to dismiss his concerns and warn him of using the line for pranks. He tries to warn the girls, who now discover Tracy gone and blood in the bathroom. The Sasquatch appears again, then heads further into the woods. Preston gets the girls' attention and warns them about the monster. After what happened to Tracy and Karen, they now believe him. He urges them to stay away from the windows and to call the police, but the beast invades their cabin. They hide: Michelle in the upstairs bathroom; C.J. in the bedroom closet; and Amanda, forced to take her chances, downstairs.  The Sasquatch hears Michelle in the upstairs bathroom, pulls her down through the ceiling, and mauls her. As it stomps through the living room, Amanda attempts to sneak out. C.J. runs into the room looking for her and screams at the sight of the Sasquatch, blowing their cover. C.J. escapes but Amanda is cornered, forcing her to leap through a window. A hysterical C.J. abandons Amanda and attempts to escape in the Jeep, but is unable to get it started. The Sasquatch overturns it. C.J. tries to rescue Amanda and get to Preston's cabin, but the Sasquatch knocks her to the ground and stomps on her stomach, killing her. Amanda is the sole survivor out of all her friends.  A traumatized Amanda runs to Preston's cabin; he quickly welcomes her in. Promising to protect her, Preston starts a plan to stop the creature from killing them both while Amanda attempts to contact police with a different message, this time about a "psycho killer", but the power goes out. The Sasquatch breaks into the cabin, and they both try to escape down the cottage's [[balcony]] using Preston's old climbing gear. The creature gets Amanda but is interrupted by an awake Otis, now knowing Preston was telling the truth, who strikes it in the back with an [[axe]], causing it to drop Amanda. The attack does not kill it, and the enraged beast kills Otis by biting his face off. The Sasquatch continues to pursue the two remaining humans. As they get inside Preston's car, the survivors attempt to move but the creature has them and then releases the car. Amanda is ejected from the vehicle and onto the ground and knocked out. A desperate Preston then stops the monster from killing her by using his car horn which irritates the beast.  Preston then releases the [[brakes]], causing the Sasquatch to get caught behind the car. Preston shifts gears into reverse and keeps pushing it until it is rammed to a tree, causing the axe from Otis' attack still stuck in its back to [[impalement|impale]] it. Preston goes after Amanda as the creature dies and the police finally arrive. After confirming dead bodies, Preston and Amanda are off to a hospital. However, the victims of the Sasquatch are not seen and the creature itself is somehow gone. On the other hand, Sheriff Halderman and his deputies then hear noises after a short search. He and his crew turn around to discover a group of Sasquatches growling at them from the trees as the movie ends.

After the Wedding
 Jacob Petersen manages an Indian [[orphanage]].

The orphanage has been in danger of collapse for eight years and faces [[bankruptcy]]. A Danish corporation offers a substantial donation to maintain the orphanage, with the caveat that Jacob return to Denmark (where he grew up) to personally receive the funds. Apparently the CEO, Jørgen Hannson, wishes to meet Jacob.  Pramod is upset when he learns that Jacob must travel to Copenhagen, and is insistent that Jacob return for Pramod's [[birthday]], which is in eight days. Jacob departs for Denmark; once there, he is greeted by a driver and a young man named Christian; he is checked into a luxurious suite paid for by the corporation.  When Jacob meets with Jørgen, the latter says he is still considering which project to fund. This surprises Jacob, who had understood that the decision was already made. Jørgen's daughter, Anna, is to marry Christian and Jørgen invites Jacob to the [[wedding]]. During the ceremony Jørgen's wife, Helene, notices Jacob.  They are formally introduced during the reception, though both of them have recognized each other. She was the love of Jacob's life, but he was unfaithful with her best friend, and they broke up twenty years prior.  During Anna's speech at the marriage festivities, Jacob learns that she is not the biological daughter of Jørgen. His suspicion that she might be his daughter is confirmed by Helene the next day. Jacob is angry to have only learned of his daughter after two decades. Helene claims that they had tried to track him down in India but were unsuccessful. She is compelled to tell Anna of Jacob now; the two meet and get along well, if slightly awkwardly.  Jørgen stalls the negotiations relating to funding, which distresses Jacob because of his promise to return for Pramod's birthday. Jacob attempts to explain the situation to a disappointed Pramod, who cuts their telephone call short. Jørgen discloses that he will create a foundation in Jacob's and Anna's name and fund it with a large sum of money. One of the conditions of the contract would be that Jacob must live in Denmark.  Jacob initially finds himself unable to comply, because he is thinking of Pramod and the other children who have been part of his life for so long. He also resents the implication that he could be bought by Jørgen.  When Jacob storms out, Jørgen runs after him and admits the real motivation: he is terminally ill and will soon die.  Jørgen had brought Jacob to Denmark so he could care for Anna and Helene, as well as Morten and Martin, Jørgen's twin sons. Angered at this deception, Jacob hastily leaves for his hotel room. Later, Anna arrives distressed because she has just discovered Christian with another woman. Jacob comforts her, realizing his need for her in his life. He signs the contract with Jørgen with the conditions intact.  Jørgen dies. On Jacob's next visit to India, construction work at the orphanage is well underway. Jacob asks Pramod if he would like to come to Denmark to live with him, but partly because Jacob used to rail against the rich, Pramod decides to stay in his home country.

Wrongly accused of doping in the [[Santa Fe-Coronda Marathon]], a 57 kilometer river swim, he has abandoned his career and his dreams.  Eight years later, Goyo returns to [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], where the marathon will be held again, to attempt to re-gain his title and clear his name. Goyo is inspired to attempt again after seeing a documentary about 6 fold long distance swimming world champion [[Edith van Dijk]] who plays herself in the movie.  However, long buried emotions come back to haunt him. He meets Chino, a stubborn and disciplined pool swimmer, who tries hard to be selected for the national team, but fails.  
Air Force, Incorporated
 The documentary portrays a behind-the-scenes look at the poor state of Argentina's civil aviation, and puts the blame on the Argentine Air Force.  The Air Force has been in control of air traffic operations since the military takeover of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] in 1966.  The producer/director, Enrique Piñeyro, claims [[Argentina]] and [[Nigeria]] are the only countries whose air force controls and regulates the airline industry.  Piñeyro, a former Argentine airline pilot, makes his case in the documentary using diagrams, 3D animations, interviews, hidden cameras in the control tower, and a few props.  For example, at one point he spills out a bag of plastic airplanes and equates it to the number of planes the air force has lost due to negligence.  The film is heavily based on the [[Austral Líneas Aéreas Flight 2553]] plane crash.  Enrique Piñeyro takes his camera, secretly, into the control tower of the [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport]] also-known-as Ezeiza, the international airport at [[Buenos Aires]].  
After Thomas
 Kyle Graham (Andrew Byrne) is a severely [[autism|autistic]] child who has limited communication skills, throws violent tantrums and is not toilet-trained. His condition tests the patience of his parents Nicola ([[Keeley Hawes]]) and Rob ([[Ben Miles]]).  Nicola believes that the symptoms of Kyle's autism can be [[Autism#prognosis|made less severe over time]] by attempting to integrate him with the world around him. Rob, however, believes that the best solution is to send Kyle to a specialist boarding school run by the charismatic and caring headteacher John Havers ([[Clive Mantle]]).  Rob, who has not had sex with his wife for years, becomes more torn when family friend Rachel ([[Lorraine Pilkington]]) offers him casual sex. Nicola’s only respite is the unwavering support of her mother Pat ([[Sheila Hancock]]) and father Jim ([[Duncan Preston]]), who dote on Kyle and provide practical support when needed.   Open-minded on [[autism therapies]], Nicola reads about a child [[Animal-assisted therapy|whose condition improved]] with the help of a [[therapy dog]]; Rob remains sceptical, believing that Kyle will either be terrified of the dog or oblivious to its existence. Kyle names his [[golden retriever]] puppy Thomas after [[Thomas the Tank Engine]]. Slowly, through Thomas, he learns about emotions and interpersonal relationships. Rob discovers that he can quell his son's tantrums by speaking in a different voice that Kyle believes is that of Thomas. Rob and Nicola's marriage improves and she becomes pregnant with her second child. Thomas falls ill and the couple fear that if the dog should die, their son will regress. However, he makes a full recovery. In the final scene of the film, Kyle acknowledges his parents for the first time and says that he loves them.  Before the credits, an [[epilogue]] shows what happened to the real-life figures portrayed as characters in the film.  
Akeelah and the Bee
 Akeelah Anderson, an 11-year-old spelling enthusiast, attends Crenshaw Middle School, a predominantly [[black school]] in [[South Los Angeles|South]] [[Los Angeles]]. She lives with her [[widow]]ed mother Tanya, her older sister Kiana, her older brothers Devon and Terrence, and her infant niece. Her principal Mr. Welch suggests that she sign up for the Crenshaw Schoolwide Spelling Bee, which she initially refuses. After being threatened for detention for the remaining of the semester, she gives in, enters the spelling bee, and wins. Soon after, Dr. Joshua Larabee, a visiting English professor and Mr. Welch's friend from college, tests Akeelah and decides that she is good enough to compete in the National Spelling Bee. Nevertheless, Dr. Larabee declines to coach her because she is rude to him. As a result, Akeelah studies on her own to prepare for the district spelling bee. Although Akeelah misspells her word during the final round of the bee, she qualifies for the regional bee when Kiana catches the other finalist cheating. Akeelah also meets and befriends Javier Mendez, a 12-year-old [[Mexican American]] boy and fellow speller. Javier invites her to join the spelling club at his [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]] middle school.  At Woodland Hills, Akeelah meets Dylan Chiu, a [[Chinese American]] boy who had won second place at the past two national spelling bees. Contemptuous, he asks her to spell "[[xanthosis]]". When she starts with a "z", he tells her she needs a coach. At the conclusion of the spelling club meeting, Javier invites Akeelah to his birthday party. At the party, Akeelah nearly beats Dylan in [[Scrabble]]. The boy is reprimanded by his father for nearly losing to "a little black girl". After the party, Tanya is depressed over her husband's death after a criminal shot and killed him on his way home from work and concerned about her daughter's grades and frequent [[truancy]]. As she finds out about Akeelah going alone to Woodland Hills, she subsequently forbids Akeelah from participating in the upcoming state bee. To circumvent this prohibition, Akeelah forges her deceased father's signature on the consent form and secretly studies with Dr. Larabee. During the state bee, Tanya comes inside and interrupts her daughter before she can spell her word. Tanya relents after a side discussion with Dr. Larabee and Mr. Welch. Javier protects Akeelah from disqualification by stalling until she can return. Dylan, Javier and Akeelah advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee.  As Christmas approaches, Akeelah goes out to buy Dr. Larabee a present, but when she meets him, he reveals that he is quitting being her coach because she reminds him of his deceased daughter Denise: being very sick caused her death and that caused his wife Patricia to move into another city. Instead, he gives Akeelah 5,000 flashcards to study. Without her coach, rejected by her best friend Georgia, and feeling the pressure from her neighborhood residents to make them proud, Akeelah loses her motivation. However, Tanya tells her that if she looked around her, she would realize that she has "50,000 coaches". Akeelah recruits her family members, classmates, teachers, friends, and neighbor Derrick T to prepare in earnest. After reuniting with Dr. Larabee, Akeelah goes to [[Washington, D.C.]] with him, along with Tanya, Georgia, Mr. Welch, and Devon, unaware that her coach has paid for four of their tickets. Georgia rekindles her friendship with Akeelah after she invites her. During the competition, Akeelah becomes a crowd favorite. After all the other competitors are eliminated, only Dylan and Akeelah remain. The two finalists are allowed a break, during which Akeelah overhears Dylan's father harshly pressuring him to win. Akeelah attempts to [[match fixing|intentionally lose]] by deliberately misspelling "xanthosis". Dylan, knowing that Akeelah knows this word, intentionally misspells it as well. Dylan tells Akeelah that he wants a fair competition, rejecting his father's obsession to win. The two then proceed to spell every word listed by the judges in the hopes of winning the championship together, with Dylan earning a share of it by correctly spelling "logorrhea", much to his father's delight. Akeelah spells the last word on the list, "pulchritude", and the two are declared co-champions amidst a cheering crowd.

Akihabara@Deep
  ===Novel===  A group of outcasts who meet each other through an online website decide to form an IT company.  They seek to create a search engine that will become more popular than Google.  They call their creation CROOK (クルーク).  This new search engine uses Artificial Intelligence to understand the user's intentions and help them narrow their search.  This attracts the attention of Nakagomi Takeshi, the president of Digital Capital (DigiCap), who after a failed attempt to take over Akihabara@Deep, steals the technology for himself.  The group must then find a way to get their technology back from DigiCap.  The novel is narrated from the point of view of CROOK's Artificial Intelligence.  ===Drama===  The Drama takes a much more lighthearted approach to the story.  It all begins when a mysterious online personality named Yui decides to assemble these outcasts to try to form a group dedicated to solving the problems that plague Akiba by forming the "troubleshooting" company, Akihabara@DEEP, often shortened to just @DEEP. One example of this troubleshooting would be that the otaku of Akiba have come under a surge of bullying. @DEEP's first task was to eliminate this bullying. After getting rid of this problem, @DEEP began taking up other tasks as well. Some of these include clearing the name of a cosplayer in a case that involved the distribution of underground videos depicting other cosplayers getting undressed in dressing rooms, protecting a news anchor from attacks by otaku who were enraged at a story that she had previously worked on that bashed the youth of Akiba, and helping out a [[maid café]] that the people of Akiba frequent from an opposing maid café that was acting extremely hostile to this maid café and even provided various prostitution services to the visitors of the opposing maid café.  While @DEEP solves these cases, the group unintentionally attracts the attention of a seedy character named Nakagomi Takeshi. The reason behind this is because of a secret past relationship between Nakagomi and Yui. What adds to this is a fully self-reliant [[AI]] program that Nakagomi would greatly benefit from if he got his hands on it. This is because he is the president of a very influential electronics company called Digital Capital, often shortened to DigiCap. He will eventually raid @DEEP's headquarters and steal Yui's AI.

Alien Autopsy (film)
 The film is framed by [[Ray Santilli]] and his friend [[Gary Shoefield]] retelling the events to a documentary maker.  In 1995, Ray and Gary went to America to find [[Elvis]] memorabilia to sell on the market stall Ray runs in London. Harvey, a former [[US Army]] [[cameraman]], sold them a silent [[black and white]] film of Elvis performing live, but later returned with an intriguing offer. Harvey took Ray to [[Miami, Florida]] to see a film from 1947 showing the [[autopsy]] of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] supposedly killed in a [[UFO]] crash in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. Harvey want to sell the film for $30,000.  Gary and Ray returned to England to look for an investor to give them the money. Ray convinces Laszlo Voros, a Hungarian art dealer obsessed with [[crop circles]], to give him the $30,000 and retrieves the film from Harvey. Back in England, that the film has [[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the "vinegar syndrome"|degraded]] from humidity and heat and was now completely unwatchable, so the duo decided to film their own remake of the movie to avoid serious repercussions from Voros. Based on Ray's memories of the content of the original, and with the help of some friends, Ray and Gary remade the autopsy film, using a convincing replica of the dead alien fashioned from a mannequin and meat products from a friend's butcher shop, and filmed on a [[Bell and Howell]] spring-wound camera, turning the living room of Gary's sister into a [[movie set]] in the process. Once finished, Ray gave a copy of the new film to Voros, who believed it to be real.  Having convinced Voros, Ray and Gary decide to sell the film to other venues, earning them lots of money. However, Voros heard that about the international distribution of the film, he demanded 80% of the profits. Good fortune intervened, however, when Voros was knocked down and killed by a green [[Land Rover]] whilst standing naked in the middle of a crop circle, leading to speculations that Voros was killed by a [[CIA]] agent.  Ray and Gary traveled to Argentina to promote the film, followed by reporter Amber Fuentes, who seduced Ray. Amber eventually tracked down Harvey, who demanded from Ray and Gary that they help him keep his anonymity. So they produced an interview with a homeless man (who coincidentally had been an actor 40 years previously) posing as Harvey, making the newswoman believe she was onto the wrong man.  While the documentary maker remains skeptical, Ray and Gary claim that some of the original 1947 footage could actually be recovered by the [[film restoration]] experts and could be watched. However, after viewing the film, Ray and Gary bury it, telling each other that they can't go through with it all over again.

Alive in Joburg
 In 1990, Johannesburg is home to a number of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[refugees]], whose large spaceships (estimated to be nearly one kilometre in length) can be seen hovering above the city. When the visitors first arrived, the human population was enamored with, among other aspects, the aliens' advanced "bio-suits", and welcomed them with open arms. However, the aliens later began moving into other areas of the city, committing crimes in order to survive and frequently clashed with police. Playing as a documentary, the film continues with interviews and footage taken from handheld cameras, that highlight the growing tension between Earth's civilian population and the extraterrestrial visitors.  According to individuals "interviewed" in the film, the aliens were captive labour (slaves or indentured servants), forced to live in "conditions that were not good" and had escaped to Earth. Because the film takes place in 1990, while [[apartheid]] was still in effect in [[South Africa]], the aliens were forced to live amongst the already-oppressed [[black people|black]] population, causing conflict with them as well as the non-white and [[white people|white]] populations.  All of the interview statements which do not explicitly mention extraterrestrials were taken from authentic interviews with many South Africans who had been asked their opinions of [[Zimbabwean]] refugees.<ref>Woerner, Meredith.

All the King's Men (2006 film)
 Jack Burden, a [[Louisiana]] news reporter, takes a personal interest in Willie Stark, an idealistic small-town lawyer and [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parish]] treasurer. Circumstances develop that result in Tiny Duffy, a local political leader Burden knows, urging Stark to run for [[Governor (U.S.)|governor]]. Burden’s upbringing makes him familiar with the undercurrent of politics – he was raised by his loving [[Godparent|godfather]] Judge Irwin, a former state attorney general, while his good friend, Dr. Adam Stanton, and his sister Anne Stanton—also Burden’s former lover—are the children of a former governor. Burden therefore decides to take Duffy's advice and travels as a reporter on Stark's campaign for governor.  The politically astute Burden soon deduces, and Duffy strategist (and Stark mistress) Sadie Burke confirms, that Duffy is using Stark to split his party's vote and thus allow the opposing party to win. They tell Stark, who begins to give speeches in a straightforward manner to appeal to the public, in defiance of the advice given to him by Duffy. His vigorous strategy attacks the corruption of the existing players and promises schools and roads for his “fellow ignorant hicks”, resulting in Stark winning the election. He manages Duffy by making him his lieutenant governor. Stark recruits Burden to work for him as an adviser.  Stark proves to be a very persuasive governor, delivering on many of his new projects. Irwin disapproves of Stark and publicly supports an investigation of possible [[Graft (politics)|graft]] in the new spending. Burden points out that graft is the elite’s word for what the previous politicians had always done, while Stark openly tells his crowds that his “crooks, unlike theirs, are itty bitty” compared to the elite’s. Stark convinces Stanton to head a new public hospital while he begins having an affair with Anne, provoking Burke's jealousy and Burden's disappointment.  Irwin continues criticizing Stark as political controversies begin to unfold. Stark demands that Burden seek information on the judge to be used against him. Jack insists that there is no such information, but eventually discovers evidence of a [[bribe]] that Irwin used to get his appointment many years prior, leading an opponent to commit suicide. Following this revelation, Irwin himself commits suicide. Burden’s mother then tells him that Irwin treated him with such love because he was his biological father, which causes a great amount of guilt for Burden.  Stark utilizes many methods of [[corruption]] to consolidate his power, including [[patronage]] and intimidation. Adam is told that Stark is using the hospital project to rob the state and is framing him in the process. Burden and Anne both assure Adam that this is false. Adam also becomes enraged when he learns of Stark's affair with his sister. Adam waits at the state capitol and assassinates Stark, only to be immediately killed by the governor's bodyguard. It is later revealed that Adam was influenced by Duffy and Burke to murder Stark, allowing Duffy to succeed Stark as governor.  
Alpha Dog
 Johnny Truelove is a young drug dealer living in [[Southern California]] in late 1999. His father, Sonny, supplies him with [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], which Johnny distributes to his gang of drug-dealing friends, which include Frankie Ballenbacher, Johnny’s right-hand man; Tiko Martinez, the muscle of the group; Elvis Schmidt, a ridiculed member of the group who is indebted to Johnny; and Jake Mazursky, a short-tempered drug-dealer who is also in debt with Johnny.  Jake makes a failed attempt at borrowing money from his father Butch and step-mother Olivia, who themselves are dealing with their other rebellious son: Zack Mazursky, Jake’s younger half-brother who looks up to him. That night, a fight breaks out between Jake and Johnny when the former tries to pay Johnny only part of his debt. After back and forth escalating retaliation, Johnny brings Frankie and Tiko to go and confront Jake in person, but when they arrive at his apartment he is nowhere to be found. As they leave, they find Zack, who had just run away from home, walking on the side of the road. Johnny impulsively orders the gang to kidnap him with the intent of holding on to him until Jake pays his debt.  Wanting a break from his home life, Zack makes no effort to escape. Johnny leaves Frankie to watch Zack and he offers Zack a chance to leave, but Zack declines, not wanting to cause any problems for his brother. Zack stays with Frankie at his father's house and the two develop a friendship over drinking and doing chores around Frankie’s house. The next day, Zack ingratiates himself with Frankie's friends Keith, Julie, and Susan, although the latter is the only one who seems concerned.  Frankie meets with Johnny and grows nervous when Johnny tells him that they could get in serious trouble for the kidnapping. Frankie suggests they pay Zack to keep quiet about the kidnapping upon going home; Johnny agrees. However, the next day after a threatening phone call from Jake, and a phone conversation from his lawyer who tells him he could face life in prison for the kidnapping, he decides the risk of ending up dead or in jail is too great to let Zack go. Johnny calls Elvis and offers to erase his debt if he kills Zack, giving him a submachine gun. Frankie and his friends still believe Zack will be returning home that night and throw a raucous going away party that night at a hotel. Zack has a good time at the party, and later goes skinny dipping with Julie and her friend Alma, which leads to a threesome. After the party Julie gives Zack her number, and Alma gives him a goodbye kiss on the cheek.  Elvis arrives at the hotel where Zack is waiting to be picked up, and he and Frankie begin to argue when he reveals Johnny sent him there to kill Zack. While Frankie runs off, Elvis goes inside and introduces himself to Zack. Elvis then takes Keith out to help him dig a grave in a secluded part of the nearby mountains. Frankie returns to the hotel and offers Zack a final opportunity to escape, but believing that he will be returning home soon, Zack prefers to wait for Elvis. When Elvis and Keith return to the hotel, Elvis and Frankie go outside to talk. Frankie, reluctant because of the friendship he has formed with Zack, finally relents when Elvis tells him they could face life in prison, in addition to problems with Jake and Johnny, if Zack tells someone what happened. Meanwhile, Sonny, Cosmo (Johnny's godfather), and their lawyer confront Johnny, who stubbornly refuses to call off the hit, even when given the offer to spend a minimal amount of jail time with a plea deal.  Zack and the others arrive at the grave site. Zack is not aware of what's going on but grows suspicious when a saddened Keith tells Frankie he can't go through with it. When Zack sees the grave, he begins to break down, and begs them to let him go. Frankie tells Elvis one last time that they shouldn’t do it, but Elvis insists on following through. Frankie calms Zack down and proceeds to tie Zack up with duct tape. Elvis then knocks Zack into the grave with the shovel and shoots him to death. Despite the seclusion of the spot, Zack’s body is eventually found days later.  Certain parts of the film are intercut with scenes from interviews, conducted by detective Tom Finnegan, of people connected to Johnny and his group. The film also makes note of the multiple witnesses—ranging from onlookers, partygoers, friends, and family members—that saw Zack in between his initial kidnapping and eventual murder, which total up to 32. The epilogue shows the aftermath of the crime. Olivia, now suffering from obesity and depression, talks candidly to Finnegan about her failed suicide attempts and the loss she has experienced from her son's death. Susan angrily confronts Frankie over Zack's death and goes to the authorities. Elvis is caught while trying to secure a ride out of town. Johnny flees the city as far as [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and arrives at the house of an old classmate, who drives him back to Cosmo's house, where he enters and is not seen again.  Tiko, Keith, and Frankie are all arrested and serve their respective sentences—Tiko is convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to nine years in prison; Keith is convicted of second degree murder for digging Zack's grave and remains at the California Youth Authority until the age of 25; Frankie is convicted of aggravated kidnapping of special circumstances and receives a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 7 years; Elvis is convicted of kidnapping and first degree murder, currently on [[Death Row]] in [[San Quentin State Prison]].  Finnegan interviews Sonny and Cosmo, asking Sonny how his son was able to escape authorities for four years without help, but Sonny assures him he doesn't know where his son is. On screen text reveals that in 2005, after over five years of being on [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|America's most wanted list]], Johnny is finally found and arrested in Paraguay. Johnny is in California awaiting trial, and, if proven guilty, faces the death penalty.

All the Boys Love Mandy Lane
 At a [[Texas]] high school, Mandy Lane ([[Amber Heard]]) is an outsider who blossoms over the summer and starts getting a great deal of attention from her male classmates. One of those classmates, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house and she accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet ([[Michael Welch (actor)|Michael Welch]]) can come along with her. At the party, Dylan attacks Emmet, and holds his head under water in the pool until Mandy intercedes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump off the roof and into the pool, but Dylan hits his head on the cement floor beside the pool and dies.  Nine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been almost completely ostracized and is subjected to even more intense bullying. Their [[Cannabis culture|stoner]] classmate Red is having a small party at his father's [[cattle ranch]] and invites Mandy along, which she accepts after receiving permission from her aunt.  Mandy, Chloe, Bird, Red, Jake, and Marlin arrive at the ranch, and meet the ranch hand, Garth. That night, while playing drinking games, Jake gets offended over a joke and storms off to a nearby cattle barn, where Marlin performs [[oral sex]] on him. They have another argument, and after he walks off again, Marlin is knocked out with a [[Double-barrel shotgun|double-barreled shotgun]] by an unseen assailant, and has her jaw broken. Meanwhile back at the house, Jake unsuccessfully attempts to woo Mandy before stealing Red's shotgun and pickup truck to go search for Marlin. After driving a great distance from the house, he finds her sitting by a remote lake. Upon closer look, he sees her mangled face, and is confronted by Emmet, seeking vengeance for the humiliation he has suffered. Emmet shoots Jake in the head before breaking Marlin's neck, killing both. While the remaining friends sit on the house porch, Emmet begins shooting fireworks at them from Red's truck; Bird gives chase, believing the driver to be Jake. When he realizes it is in fact Emmet, they get into a fight, which results in Emmet slashing his eyes with a knife before stabbing him to death. The rest of the friends, drunk and high, fall asleep at the house along with Garth.  The next morning, Garth finds the words "wake up" spelled out in bloody alphabet magnets on the refrigerator. As the group attempts to leave out the front door, Garth is shot by Emmet and wounded. While Mandy looks after Garth, Red and Chloe try to run to Chloe's car, but Red is shot in the back by Emmet, who then chases after Chloe in her car. Mandy retrieves the keys to Garth's Bronco from his shack and finds the bloody knife that Emmet used to kill Bird. She goes outside to find Chloe being chased in her direction; Mandy embraces her, but then stabs her in the stomach, revealing that she is helping Emmet with the murders. While Chloe bleeds to death on the ground, Mandy and Emmet discuss the [[suicide pact]] they had planned. Mandy reveals she had no intention of going through with it, convinced that Emmet agreed to the murders only on the basis of winning her affection. Refusing to let her back down, Emmet prepares to shoot her, but Garth intervenes by wounding Emmet with his shotgun, prompting Emmet to stab him multiple times.   Emmet chases Mandy into the fields, where they both fall into a ditch filled with cattle carcasses and get into a fight; Mandy defends herself using a tree log to hold out against Emmet's repeated attempts to swipe her with his machete. The machete becomes stuck to the log and finally she hacks him to death. She returns to Garth, who is critically injured but still alive, and they both drive away from the ranch. Garth thanks Mandy for saving him, incorrectly assuming her to be a victim in Emmet's murder plot.  A [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shows the group back at a railroad track, where they took a break from their drive. While they are all goofing off, Mandy balances on the tracks, watching her future victims.

Amazing Grace (2006 film)
 In 1796, William Wilberforce is severely ill and taking a recuperative holiday in [[Bath, Somerset]], with his cousin, [[Henry Thornton (abolitionist)|Henry Thornton]]. It is here that William is introduced to his future wife, [[Barbara Spooner Wilberforce|Barbara Spooner]]. Although he initially resists any romantic overtures, she convinces him to relate the story of his career.  The story flashes back 15 years to 1782, and William recounts the events that led him to where he is now. Beginning as a young, ambitious, and popular Member of Parliament (MP), he experiences a [[Born again Christian|religious enlightenment]] and aligns himself with the [[Low Church|evangelical wing]] of the [[Church of England]]. William contemplates leaving politics to study theology, but is persuaded by his friends [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]], [[Thomas Clarkson]], [[Hannah More]], and [[Olaudah Equiano]] that he will be more effective doing the work of God by taking on the unpopular and dangerous issue of the abolition of the British [[slave trade]]. His conviction in the cause deepens following a meeting with his former mentor John Newton (introduced sweeping a church floor dressed in [[sackcloth]]) who is said to live "in the company of 20,000 ghosts... slaves". As a former slave ship captain turned Christian, he deeply regrets his past life and the effects on his fellow man. Newton urges William to take up the cause.  Pitt becomes Prime Minister and William becomes a key supporter and confidant. Pitt gives William the opportunity to present a bill before the house outlawing the slave trade. William's passionate campaigning leads him to become highly unpopular in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. He is opposed by a coalition of MPs representing vested interests of the slave trade in London, Bristol, [[Glasgow]], and [[Liverpool]] led by [[Banastre Tarleton]] and the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]]. Despite popular support and the assistance of an unlikely ally in the form of [[Charles James Fox]], William's bill to abolish the slave trade goes down to defeat. Afterward, the film portrays [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]] as one of his few friends and allies remaining in Parliament, however even their relationship becomes strained. Pitt, now facing the stresses of leading a [[Minority government|shaky coalition]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], tells William that his cause must now wait for a more stable political climate.  William keeps up the fight but after years of failure he is left exhausted and frustrated that he was unable to change anything in the government. Believing his life's work has been in vain, he becomes physically ill (in the film he is depicted as suffering from chronic [[colitis]] which causes him to become addicted to [[laudanum]] prescribed for the crippling pain), which brings the story back up to 1797. Having virtually given up hope, William considers leaving politics forever. Barbara convinces him to keep fighting because there is no other person who is willing or able to do so. A few days afterward, William and Barbara marry. Several years pass with no further success. William's wife and new children provide him with the support and strength needed to carry on the fight.  Finally, with a renewed hope for success William devises a backdoor method of [[Fabian strategy|slowly weakening the slave trade through seemingly innocuous legislation]]. Aided by Thornton, Clarkson, and new ally [[James Stephen (British politician)|James Stephen]] and cheered on by the now terminally ill Pitt, he reintroduces his bill to abolish the slave trade. In time, after the 20-year campaign and many attempts to bring legislation forward, he is eventually responsible for a [[Slave Trade Act 1807|bill being passed through Parliament]] in 1807, which abolishes the slave trade in the [[British Empire]] forever.  
American Dreamz
 On the morning after his re-election, [[US President]] Joseph Staton ([[Dennis Quaid]]) decides to read the [[newspaper]] for the first time in four years. This starts him down a slippery slope. He begins reading obsessively, reexamining his "black-and-white" view of the world in a more "gray-seeming" way, and holing up in his bedroom in his [[pajamas]]. Frightened by the President's apparent [[nervous breakdown]], his [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] ([[Willem Dafoe]]) pushes him back into the spotlight, booking him as a guest judge on the television ratings juggernaut (and the President's wife's personal favourite), the weekly [[talent show]] ''American Dreamz''. America cannot seem to get enough of ''American Dreamz'', hosted by self-aggrandizing, self-loathing Martin Tweed ([[Hugh Grant]]), ever on the lookout for the next insta-[[celebrity]]. His latest crop of hopefuls includes Sally Kendoo ([[Mandy Moore]]), a conniving steel magnolia with a devoted, dopey veteran boyfriend William Williams ([[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]), and Omer Obeidi ([[Sam Golzari]]).  Because Omer's mother died in the Middle East in an American attack, he joined a group of [[jihadist]]s. He was an actor in an instruction film for terrorists, but he was too clumsy, and his interest in show tunes was frowned upon. Therefore, he was sent to the U.S. to await further instructions, but the leaders expected they could not use him. He moved to [[Southern California]] to live with his extended family there, including his [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] cousin Iqbal ([[Tony Yalda]]) and Shazzy ([[Noureen DeWulf]]). Iqbal hoped to be selected to participate in ''American Dreamz'', but in a misunderstanding, Omer was selected instead. Iqbal becomes angered by this at first but later agrees to help Omer win and makes himself his manager.  Omer's terrorist organization now sees an opportunity: Omer is instructed to make it to the finale, and kill the [[President of the United States|President]] in a [[suicide attack]]. He succeeds in getting to the finale. Security is bypassed by assembling the bomb after the security check, in the toilet, from small parts smuggled in (the smaller pieces of explosive are disguised as chewing gum). Omer agrees, but changes his mind and disposes of the bomb in the trash can.  Sally is the other finalist. Earlier in the film, she had dumped William because she believed that her life would've gone nowhere if she still had him for a boyfriend and that he'd only drag her down. This drove William to join the army, only to be wounded in Iraq and sent back to the U.S. For the purpose of the show and at the insistence of her agent, Chet Krogl ([[Seth Meyers]]), Sally has to pretend that she still loves William. On the eve of the ''American Dreamz'' finale, William proposes to Sally, which she rejects until Chet decides to boost Sally's popularity and chances of winning the show by asking William to do the proposal on air. However, William witnesses Sally having sex with Martin, and is furious. When he throws out the engagement ring, he finds the bomb Omer tossed in the trash can. He then comes out on stage and threatens to detonate it. While the other people evacuate, William starts singing and Martin, who refuses to let go of the camera, films it. As William reaches the end of the song, he detonates the bomb by walking into the camera, killing both himself and Martin. The film then cuts to shots of people dialing up their cell phones to vote in for the winner. It is eventually revealed that William Williams was voted the surprise winner of ''American Dreamz''.  The epilogue reveals what each of the characters went on to do after the end of last season. Omer went on to become a successful star of his own Broadway revue, where he is shown performing a scene from the musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''. The President makes his wife his new Chief of Staff. And Sally Kendoo becomes the new host of ''American Dreamz''.  
The Amazing Grace

Ang Pamana: The Inheritance
 Canada-based Filipino siblings Anna and Johnny are asked by their dad to attend the wake of their grandmother (lola) and to represent their family in the reading of her will in Manila.  Together with their cousin, Vanessa, they inherit their lola's 19-hectare property/farm in rural Bulacan. The three of them get along, especially Johnny and Vanessa due to their shared vice. Johnny also gets along with his lola's adoptive autistic grandson, Tommy, who's also inherited part of the same property.  Mang Dante and Celia act as caretakers of the property and live with the inheritors.  Vanessa takes the siblings to the local marketplace - where a mysterious old woman (implied to be the human form of a manananggal, meaning "the one who removes" - a type of aswang that preys on pregnant women or sick people) briefly touches Anna's belly (an act which "marks" an intended victim) - and later the whole property together with Tommy. She also shows them her very own marijuana plantation there, which she believes will make them a fortune albeit illegally. Anna and Johnny are hesitant, but Vanessa says no one dares to go to their land as locals believe there are supernatural entities inhabiting it. Vanessa herself doesn't believe the tales, but it helped keep the stash a secret.  While checking out a particular mango tree nearby, Tommy appears to be talking to someone up there. Johnny, who was then recording their travel, catches something peculiar on tape.  Through either his dreams or drug-induced stupor, Johnny recalls some details of his time with his lola as a kid. She mainly shares with him the tale of the manananggal. It is revealed that he and his lola saw it in the said property at least once, and that she warned him never to enter the wooded area there. She also says that one day, he'll set things right.  Throughout their stay, the house is slowly revealed to be haunted by their lola's spirit. The spirit makes its presence felt to the trio. Johnny dismisses his experiences.  Tommy is shown to have the ability to "see" the ghost, as well as some other entities that dwell in the land.  The next day, Vanessa and her friends Ronnie, Paolo and Nico harvest some of their plants. Along the way, Ronnie and Nico litter, urinate and spit on some mounds on the forest floor. In Filipino folklore, such areas are considered as homes of dwendes (dwarves) which will curse anyone who disrespects their homes. On the way back, Ronnie and Nico's motorcycles mysteriously stall, prompting Vanessa and Paolo to go on ahead back to the house.  Tommy finds and plays with Johnny's drugs, but the latter does not find out. He is then forced to go sober for some time.  Meanwhile, Ronnie gets his motorcycle to start up, and leaves Nico behind. As Nico walks back to the house, he notices the mango tree. He throws rocks at it to get some of its fruits. He also sees cigars near its base - cigars which were placed by Mang Dante earlier as an offering - and takes some, angering an unseen entity.  Johnny reviews his footage from earlier by the same tree showing an entity called kapre, a tall hairy tree spirit which is benevolent to those who respect it but malevolent to those who are not.  Anna is revealed to be eight weeks pregnant, but not considering marrying her boyfriend. Johnny expresses his support for his sister.  That night, Nico fails to return. Tommy keeps saying that he's dead, but no one takes heed. Johnny suggests they find him, but Paolo advises against roaming the farm at that time. Ronnie suddenly becomes very sick.  Come morning, Paolo hires a local albularyo or medicine woman to cure Ronnie who apparently fell victim to the curse of a black dwarf. After she succeeds, Vanessa then hires her to exorcise the ghost haunting the house. Paolo goes home. Although the albularyo advises against this, Vanessa insists the exorcism to be performed due to her being a current owner of the property, unlike the ghost who is now just a former owner.  Johnny finds Tommy talking to someone at a shrine outside the house. He briefly catches a glimpse of lola (whose ghost he now believes he really has been seeing due to him being sober at the moment but still seeing the ghost) and gets Anna to the spot, who confirms she is able to feel a presence and smell lola's perfume but doesn't see her. Tommy then states that lola told him to go to the mango tree and runs off. Johnny follows, leaving Anna at the shrine. Shortly afterwards, Anna is attacked by the human form of the manananggal while Tommy and Johnny find Nico's body by the tree.  That night, Ronnie and Vanessa decide to have Tommy locked up at the barn as they believe it was him and not a kapre that killed Nico. This, despite the Johnny's footage showing the kapre.  Mang Dante asks Johnny to come with him to the mango tree immediately. As Mang Dante places offerings, Johnny again sees the kapre through his videocam's night vision. Mang Dante comes back and says the kapre wants to talk to lola's descendant. Johnny is reluctant because he's afraid and doesn't speak Tagalog. Mang Dante responds that entities don't use words to communicate. Johnny offers cigars, and the kapre shows him a vision of a manananggal's lair in the forest - a creature that his lola intended to get rid of in her younger days but was unable to.  At the barn, Celia tries to unlock the doors to let Tommy out. His noise attracts the manananggal, forcing Celia to retreat. It terrorizes Tommy for some time.  Back at the house, Anna wakes up at her room and hears Tommy's cries. She asks Ronnie and Vanessa to help her get him but they refuse and reveal that the manananggal is outside. She goes out, only to find the creature at the treetops nearby. The three of them shut all the windows and doors, while the manananggal flies around.  Johnny is able to find the manananggal's lair and throws salt all over its lower body half hidden there. This will prevent the creature from merging its flying part to its lower body. Realizing that the flying part isn't nearby, he quickly goes back to Mang Dante who's at the mango tree and they hurry back to the house.  Celia is able to free Tommy from the barn. They run back to the house to help Anna.  Vanessa tells Ronnie that the manananggal is after Anna only, and that they can escape. Ronnie reluctantly goes, but not before handing Anna a machete. They leave Anna behind.  The manananggal finally enters the house and gets the unborn child out of Anna using its tongue. Unable to fly indoors, it slowly crawls to finish off Anna. Celia and Tommy arrive and splash salt all over the creature, hurting it and momentarily paralyzing it. Johnny arrives, then throws a net to prevent it from flying. Mang Dante sets it on fire, which later burns down the whole house. The five of them escape before it collapses.  As Ronnie drives away on his motorcycle, Vanessa spots a white lady by the side of the desolate road. They pass her by a few times, after which Ronnie begins seeing it too. The white lady, revealed to be lola's spirit which was forced out earlier, suddenly appears in the middle of the road. They crash, causing Vanessa's death. Ronnie walks away dazed and heavily injured.  Johnny, Mang Dante, Celia and Tommy are seen working to rebuild the house. It is implied that Johnny will stay at the farm to take care of it. He and Tommy offer flowers at the shrine, which has pictures of lola and Vanessa. As they walk away, Vanessa's vengeful spirit appears behind them.

We then see Professor Goda, who is also attending the opening ceremonies, looking on the crowd of freshmen with evil eyes and a sinister smile on his face. After the ceremony has ended, five girls discover a [[goblin]]-looking creature in the background of one of their photo's after one of them got her picture taken; however due to its frighting appearance, they decide to get rid of it instead of keeping it.  The scene then shifts to an underground [[basement]] in the school's church in which Professor Goda and The Director are raping a freshman student who is tied up and gagged.  The Director is dressed up in typical red [[S&M]] bondage gear while Goda is [[Naturism|buck naked]]. Goda comments that he needs the extracts of younger women in order to provide food for an organism that he just discovered.  The Director appears to be happily enjoying watching the torture and involves herself in the process by whipping the freshman with her riding crop until the freshman faints from shock.  The scene cuts to the dormitory where Sayaka and Atsuko are currently engaging in heavy petting and passionate kissing in their dorm room. The scene develops into a full sex scene until they are interrupted at the end of their lovemaking by a group of fellow students knocking at the door asking them to come to dinner.  It's at this point there are clear signs that there is something wrong with the student population as all the girls are listless and uninterested in anything, including Atsuko's "impressions".  Yuko manages to get a little life out of them through her [[violin]] playing, but it is clear there is still something wrong.  Professor Goda is in the church listening to the music when he is suddenly attacked by what appears to be a [[fairy]], who we later find out is named Rom. The show then cuts to a montage of Sayaka and Atsuko's life at their new school, and Atsuko proves to be an apt athlete in [[lacrosse]] and a healthy eater, and is very popular with the other girls in the school, to the disapproval of Sayaka who wants Atsuko all for herself.

The Ant Bully (film)
 In [[Las Vegas]], lonely 10-year-old new kid, Lucas Nickle ([[Zach Tyler Eisen]]) is left with his older sister, Tiffany ([[Allison Mack]]), and his grandmother ([[Lily Tomlin]]) when his parents go to [[Puerto Vallarta]]. Neglected by his family and tormented by a local bully named Steve ([[Myles Jeffrey]]), Lucas takes out his frustration on an [[anthill]] and attacks it with a squirt gun, terrifying the ants. One ant, an eccentric [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] named Zoc ([[Nicolas Cage]]), tries to fight back. His girlfriend, a nurse ant named Hova ([[Julia Roberts]]) who is fascinated by human beings, attempts to communicate with Lucas. He drops his gun on the grass, and kicks the anthill with one of his sneakers, sending the ants flying into the grass. Hova tries to communicate to Lucas, but she is almost crushed before being rescued by Zoc. The leaders of the colony decide to use a [[potion]] Zoc has recently created to shrink Lucas down to ant size.   The local [[pest control|exterminator]], Stan Beals ([[Paul Giamatti]]), convinces Lucas to sign a contract to kill vermin. Later, Zoc and a small troop of ants pour the potion onto his ear. He wakes up and discovers that he is now tiny, where he lands on a potato chip. He is carried to the anthill into a world of giant caves, [[caterpillar]]s and ants. Zoc insists that Lucas should be studied then eaten, but he is overruled by the Queen ([[Meryl Streep]]). She sentences Lucas to [[penal labour|hard labor]].  Hova volunteers to train Lucas, much to Zoc's mortification. They both learn about the differences between ants and humans. However, when she forces him to forage for [[jelly bean]]s with Kreela ([[Regina King]]) and Fugax ([[Bruce Campbell]]), Lucas is unsuccessful. The ants are attacked by [[tarantula hawk|tarantula hawk wasps]]. Lucas finds a discarded firecracker and uses it to scare away the wasps. This earns him the admiration of all the ants – except Zoc.  Lucas is introduced to honeydew, the feces of caterpillars. He is shown a painting which depicts the Great Ant Mother and the evil "Cloud-Breather", an exterminator. Lucas is told that the Great Ant Mother will return and shower the ants with honeydew, while the Cloud-breather will spell destruction for all of them. He and his friends return to the house, where he tries to cancel the contract but dials for pizza instead. To make matters worse, Tiffany comes in as a giantess, and tries to crush the ants with the phone (not just Fugax) as they are forced into hiding until dark.  When Zoc finds out that Lucas put Hova in possible danger, he accuses Lucas of further treachery and tells him that he should find another wizard because there is no way that he will give Lucas the potion to turn him back again, causing Lucas to run away in fright. Upon hearing what happened, Hova becomes angry with Zoc and goes out to look for Lucas. Once she finds him, he is swallowed by a [[frog]]. Zoc witnesses the event and realizes how much Hova cares about Lucas and frees him to make up for his selfishness. Afterwards Zoc and Lucas discuss their differences. Zoc explains that ants work for the benefit of the colony. Lucas states that most humans work for personal gain. Zoc is unsure as to how anything gets accomplished in Lucas' world but then sympathizes with him when they both admit that both used to act without thinking.  Next day, when Beals arrives to exterminate the colony, Lucas and Zoc enlist the aid of the [[wasp]]s; at first, the wasps want to eat them, but hearing that their nest is destroyed by Beals, they agree to help. During the battle with Stan, Lucas saves the lives of Hova and an injured wasp. Both the ants and wasps were no match against [[pesticide]], but as Stan is about to exterminate the ant hill, a [[beetle]] and [[glowworm]] bite him in the groin. As Stan doubles up in pain, Lucas injects him with the shrinking potion, severely disfiguring him, and he retreats on a tricycle.  The queen pronounces Lucas an ant in honor of his heroic actions, and Zoc gives him the antidote. Lucas goes back to normal size and finally stands up to the bully who runs away. Lucas then showers the colony with jelly beans as a farewell gift.  
Antônia
 On Vila Brasilândia, a ''[[favela]]'' (shanty town) of São Paulo, four [[Afro-Brazilian]] girls battle to fulfill their dream of making a living off their music. Friends since the childhood, Preta (Negra Li), Bárbarah (Leilah Moreno), Mayah (Quelynah<ref name="bo" />) and Lena (Cindy Mendes, a.k.a. Maria Madalena,<ref name="bo" /> as Cindy) quit singing the [[backing vocals]] for a male [[rap music|rap]] group and form Antônia, their own group. Discovered by the smooth-talking manager Marcelo Diamante (Thaíde), they begin to sing rap, [[Música popular brasileira|MPB]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[soul music|soul]] in bars and in middle-class parties.  Preta is the deep-voiced mother of a young daughter, Emília (Nathalye Cris). Mayah is the most sexually provocative though single and the high-voiced Lena lives alone with her boyfriend. Bárbarah is the sister of Duda (Chico Santo), an athletic young man with whom she frequently practices [[martial arts]]. Duda's exposed [[homosexuality]] brings a rising action into the story in which his gay partner is killed by a gang and Duda himself injured. Duda, however, recovers; despite this sudden crisis, the future begins to look bright again as the band Antônia begins to take flight.  Just when the dream of the quartet seems to becoming true, their hopes are dashed by daily events, such as [[poverty]], male oppression, and further street violence, which threaten the group and place the young women's friendship in jeopardy.  The conflict begins when Mayah flirts with Preta's estranged husband Ermano (Fernando Macário), and Preta forces Mayah out of the group, deciding to raise Emília by herself with the help of her parents. Next, Lena reveals that she is pregnant and must quit the group after her boyfriend, who originally wanted an abortion, puts pressure on her to do so if they are to raise the child. Bárbarah, meanwhile, is walking home one night with Preta when she is confronted and harassed by a young member of the same gang who attacked her brother; she defends herself using martial arts, throwing him heavily to the ground and resulting in his hospitalization. The boy dies in the hospital and Bárbarah is arrested and imprisoned for [[manslaughter]].  Preta, who struggles with her own personal troubles and the strain of raising her child alone, is the final member of Antônia left. At last unable to feel any desire to continue the group or rise to fame (as Marcelo enourages) if her friends cannot be with her, she goes to Mayah's house to apologize and reconcile. They, along with Lena, visit a grateful, teary-eyed Bárbarah in prison; they decide to spend their time with her writing a song about their experiences.  The scene changes to some point in the future in which all four members of Antônia are back together, singing onstage a liberation-themed song, ''Antônia''.  
The Architect (film)
 Architect Leo Waters' life is in trouble and in order to have some sense of control, he attempts to lord over the other members of his family. His career appears to be going nowhere; his wife Julia ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) is a bored housewife who spends her time tending to the luxurious modern house he has designed for them, their son Martin ([[Sebastian Stan]]) drops out of college and has no interest in taking up his father's dream of also becoming an architect, and their daughter Christina ([[Hayden Panettiere]]) has entered her mid-teens and her father has started staring at her maturing body in an unfatherly way.  Tonya Neely ([[Viola Davis]]) is a black [[community organizing|community organizer]] who lives in the high-rise public housing Leo designed several years before. Her own son committed suicide and her eldest daughter just sits at home all day, while her youngest daughter has managed to get a scholarship at a fancy school in a middle-class neighborhood where she lives with a wealthy black family, and feels ashamed of her background and even her own mother. Many of the residents in the housing block want the projects razed, but the local gangs are content to control the blocks where they sell drugs. One day, Tonya turns up at one of the lectures Leo gives at the local university's school of architecture - where he comes across as a jaded teacher - to confront him over his work and to ask him to sign her petition calling for their demolition. He initially defends his own work, but later comes up with his own idea of how to improve the housing blocks by the addition of glass and artwork. Tonya arrives at his house to see the scheme but is appalled at his approach, especially as he has not even bothered to visit the area to see how it has failed. His wife turns to support Tonya.  Martin had been sitting in the lecture hall when Tonya confronted his father and becomes intrigued enough to visit the area, and begins a friendship with a black boy, Shawn ([[Paul James (actor)|Paul James]]), who turns out to be a gay prostitute and who initially thinks Martin has come to the area to pick up men. They end up having sex, anyway. In the meantime, Christina has realized that her own father has started looking at her maturing body too closely: she wishes to escape his overbearing control yet also seek affirmation of her own maturity, for which she puts herself at risk by going to a bar, getting picked up first by a young student but then ditching him for a truck driver with whom she offers to have sex, which he refuses. Things come to a head when Julia announces that she is leaving Leo. He goes to the housing block and meets Tonya. He agrees to sign her petition, but she informs him that the authorities have already agreed to demolish them. Leo walks to the roof of the block where he unexpectedly bumps into his own son.  
Apocalypto
 While hunting in the [[Mesoamerica]]n rainforest, Jaguar Paw ([[Rudy Youngblood]]), his father Flint Sky ([[Morris Birdyellowhead]]), and their fellow tribesmen encounter a procession of refugees fleeing warfare. The group's leader explains that their lands were ravaged and they seek a new beginning. He asks for permission to pass through the jungle. Flint Sky comments to his son that the visitors were sick with fear, and urges him to never allow fear to infect him.  At sunrise the next morning the tribe's village is raided by a group led by Zero Wolf ([[Raoul Trujillo]]). Huts are set on fire, many villagers are killed, including Flint Sky, and the rest of the adults are taken captive. Jaguar Paw's heavily pregnant wife Seven ([[Dalia Hernández]]) and their young son Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Báez) escape by hiding in a small natural [[pit cave]] that also serves as a water reservoir, but are left trapped when Jaguar Paw is captured. The raiders then lead the captives on a long [[forced march]] through the jungle, having left the children behind to fend for themselves.  On the journey Cocoa Leaf (Israel Ríos), a badly wounded captive, is killed by the sadistic Middle Eye ([[Gerardo Taracena]]), eliciting anger from Zero Wolf, who threatens his fellow raider with death if he kills another captive without permission. As the party approaches the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n city from which the raiders come, they encounter razed forests and failed maize crops, along with villages decimated by an unknown disease. A little girl (María Isidra Hoil) infected with the illness prophesies Zero Wolf's death and the end of the Mayan world. Once the raiders and captives reach the city the females are sold as slaves while the males are escorted to the top of a [[Mesoamerican pyramids#Maya|step pyramid]] to be [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] before the Mayan King (Rafael Velez) and Queen (Diana Botello).  As a result of a solar eclipse and the superstitions surrounding it, Jaguar Paw and the remaining captives are spared from being sacrificed by beheading. Instead, they are ordered to be taken away and "disposed of". They are offered freedom if they can avoid being killed during [[target practice]] by Zero Wolf and his men. After some tribesmen are killed, Jaguar Paw is severely injured but kills Zero Wolf's son Cut Rock (Ricardo Díaz Mendoza) and escapes into the jungle. Zero Wolf sets off with eight comrades to chase down and kill Jaguar Paw. Back in his native jungle, Jaguar Paw now has the advantage, although he is badly injured. Most of his pursuers—including Zero Wolf and Middle Eye—are gradually killed off via clever conceits and traps laid out by Jaguar Paw until there are only two left to hunt him.  The drought breaks and heavy rain begins to fall, threatening to drown Jaguar Paw's family, who are still trapped in the pit cave despite their attempts to escape. Seven gives birth to another son, who is [[Water birth|born]] into the now dangerously rising water. Meanwhile, the two remaining raiders chase Jaguar Paw out of the undergrowth towards the coast. As they reach the beach, all three are stopped in their tracks by the sight of [[conquistador]] ships anchored off the coast and Europeans making their way ashore holding up a large [[Christian cross|cross]]. Jaguar Paw escapes while the two raiders remain, seemingly mesmerized at the conquistadors' presence. Jaguar Paw returns in time to save his family from the flooded pit. He is overjoyed at the sight of his new baby son.  Sometime later, as the reunited family look out over the water at the Spanish ships, Jaguar Paw decides not to risk approaching the conquistadors, insisting his family head back into the jungle. They depart in search of a new home and a new beginning.  
Aquamarine (film)
 13-year-old best friends Claire Brown ([[Emma Roberts]]) and Hailey Rogers ([[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]]) are upset to know that they will be separated in five days as Hailey has to move to Australia because of her mother's ([[Claudia Karvan]]) work. Claire, sensible and slightly naive, looks up to Hailey as a mother figure in some ways, since her parents drowned in a boat accident years before. She now lives with her grandparents ([[Roy Billing]] and [[Julia Blake]]) by the beach near Hailey, who is more daring and adventurous in the small beach town.   One night while the girls have a slumber party, Hailey prays to the ocean god for a miracle that will make her mother change her mind about moving. Minutes later, a violent storm occurs. The following morning, Claire accidentally slips into the local beach club swimming pool and notices something strange under the water with blue hair and a tail. She tries to tell herself it was only a figment of her imagination since she's been afraid of water ever since her parents' deaths, but Hailey convinces Claire to come back and explore it later that night. When they do, they find a mermaid named Aquamarine ([[Sara Paxton]]). They instantly become friends and Aquamarine tells the girls that she needs to prove to her father that true love exists or she'll be made to get married to a man she doesn't know when she returns home. She also explains that if you help a mermaid, you get a wish.  Aquamarine immediately sets her eyes on Raymond ([[Jake McDorman]]), the lifeguard who Hailey and Claire have had a crush on for years. They are reluctant at first, but know it is their last hope, so they agree to help her. However, because Aquamarine isn't human, she doesn't understand that people don't just love one another instantly, and is rejected by Raymond when they first meet. Still, the girls promise to make Raymond fall in love with Aquamarine over the next three days. They use strategies found in the magazines that Claire and Hayley read, and proceed to stalk Raymond around town so he can notice Aquamarine more and more.  At the street fair, Raymond spends the day with Aquamarine. While spending time together alone in the water watching the sunset, he mentions that he wants to see her at a party, The Last Splash, the following night, but she flees before she can give him an answer knowing a sunset can cause her legs to transform back into a tail. Claire and Hailey show Aquamarine a water tower for her to spend the night in, and promise to visit her the next day. In the morning, the three take a bus to Tampa to buy new outfits for the party.  For years, Hailey and Claire have had disagreements with a more popular group of girls, especially Cecilia Banks ([[Arielle Kebbel]]), who also has a crush on Raymond. Cecilia lies and tells him that the reason Aquamarine left so soon is to be with her boyfriend, so Raymond invites Cecilia to the party instead. Later that day, Claire goes to find Raymond to tell him that Cecilia made the whole thing up, and he and Aquamarine reconcile. At the party, Aquamarine and Raymond bond more, but before she flees again because of another sunset, she kisses him and asks him to meet her on the pier in the morning. When the three girls leave the party, Cecilia follows them to the water tower and discovers Aquamarine's secret. She unhooks the ladder to prevent Aquamarine from getting down and calls the news so they can expose her on national television. However, in the night, the town's mysterious handyman Leonard ([[Bruce Spence]]) helps her out and promises not to tell anyone what he knows. Aquamarine grants him a wish for helping her out. When Cecilia shows up with her father, Storm Banks ([[Shaun Micallef]]), a news and weather reporter to expose Aqua, the rescue team just finds a toy dolphin in the water tower and the whole crowd, including the rescue workers, all laugh at Cecilia and Storm. Humiliated, outraged and knowing that his career may now be ruined, Storm takes Cecilia's car away from her—permanently as a punishment and tells that when she walks to school every day, she can think about why she needs to have so much attention, much to Cecilia’s dismay.  After a while, although he cares for her a lot, Raymond still has not fallen in love with Aquamarine. They meet on the pier where Cecilia interrupts and pushes Aquamarine into the ocean. Aquamarine's father calls her back home in a giant storm, but Hailey and Claire swim after her as Aquamarine tries to defy her father again. They discover the meaning of platonic love and Aquamarine's father is satisfied knowing love is real, and the girls receive their wish. They decide to not use it to keep Hailey from moving away, and instead, they part ways with Aquamarine, with promises of Aquamarine visiting them and Raymond and loving each other forever.

Se-jin has also made friends with a student, Jung-hong, whose parents leave her behind when they go out of town. Se-jin passes the puzzle cube on to Jung-hong, who notices that the tiles always go back to their original configuration. Looking at the cube, Se-jin realises the numbers inscribed on the tiles match up to the apartment numbers of the known victims, save one. They also find an article that notes Yoo-yeon committed suicide a year ago. Se-jin goes to apartment 1203 to investigate, finding another dead person, with a key to 704 in their mouth. In the apartment, Se-jin relives Yoo-Yeon's experiences, as the recluse relates them to Yang: orphaned when her parents died in a car wreck, Yoo-yeon's neighbors voluntarily decide to care for her, but over time come to hate and maltreat her, including attempted rape and assorted physical abuse. Yoo-Yeon takes her own life, her blood turning her dress completely red, but her spirit remains.  Terrified to go back to the apartment, Shin Jung-soo kills himself with an officer's gun. Jung-hong sees her parents have come home, but as it is close to 9:56 she races to keep them from being hurt. Meanwhile, Yoo-yeon confronts Se-jin, threatening to kill her for turning away from her like the others. Se-jin escapes to the roof, but is followed by Yoo-yeon; to end her hatred and pain, Se-jin allows Yoo-Yeon to take her over, and jumps from the roof, witnessed by Yang and Jung-hong.  Two months later, Jung-hong helps Detective Yang move into an apartment in the same building. They see an apparition of Se-jin, and then the lights flicker; it's 9:56 pm.

Arthur and the Invisibles
 In the year 1960, protagonist 10-year-old Arthur lives with his grandmother Daisy in a quiet farm house on a dirt road, in a small rural community in [[Northeastern Connecticut]] (based on [[Sterling, Connecticut|Sterling]]). His grandfather Archibald has recently gone missing and he sees little of his parents (who are away looking for work). Daisy entertains Arthur with stories of his grandfather's adventures in Africa, featuring the tall Bogo Matassalai and the minuscule Minimoys, of whom the latter now live in Archibald's garden, protecting a collection of rubies. Arthur becomes enamoured of a picture of Selenia, the princess of the Minimoys. When Daisy receives a two-day deadline to pay a large sum of money to a building developer named Ernest Davido, who plans to evict the two, Arthur looks for the rubies to pay off the debt and discovers various clues left by his grandfather. He is met in the garden by the Bogo Matassala, who reduce Arthur to Minimoy size. From the Minimoys, Arthur learns that they are in danger from Maltazard, a Minimoy war hero who now rules the nearby 'Necropolis', after corruption by a [[weevil]], by whom he has a son named Darkos.  Arthur, reflecting his legendary [[King Arthur|British namesake]], draws a sacred sword from its recess and uses it to protect the Minimoys from Maltazard's soldiers; whereupon Sifrat, the ruler of the Minimoys, sends Arthur to Necropolis, with the princess Selenia and her brother Betameche. ''En route'', they are attacked on two occasions by Maltazard's soldiers. In Necropolis, Selenia kisses Arthur, marking him as her husband and potential successor, and confronts Maltazard alone. When Maltazard learns that she has already kissed Arthur and thus can no longer give him her powers and cure his corruption, he imprisons all three, who discover a Minimoy form of Archibald. Thereafter Arthur and his grandfather escape and return to human form, with little time to spare before Maltazard's flood reaches the Minimoys.  With the help of Mino, a royal advisor's long-lost son, Arthur redirects the flood to Necropolis; whereupon Maltazard abandons Necropolis and his son, and the water ejects the rubies above ground. Archibald pays Davido with one ruby; and when he tries to take them all, the Bogo Matassalai capture him and give him to the authorities (scene deleted in the U.S. edition). The film ends with Arthur asking Selenia to wait for his return, and her agreement to do so.

The Art of Negative Thinking
 A support group takes a van to visit a 33-year-old man named Geirr who was in a car accident that made him a [[paraplegic]] two years prior. Geirr is paralyzed and impotent from the waist down and gets around with assistance from his wife, a motorized stair climber, and a [[wheelchair]]. He tells his loving and devoted wife, Ingvild, how terrible his life is and is drenched in bitterness, spending his time drinking booze, smoking [[marijuana]], and watching films based on the [[Vietnam War]].  In an attempt to get her husband to look more favorably on his life and to save their marriage, Ingvild signs Geirr up for a positivity group meeting. All the members of the group have different disabilities, and with the help of an enthusiastic group leader Tori (who has no disability) they are forbidden to say anything negative and encourage each other to see things more positively. The group includes Marta, who is a [[quadriplegic]] as a result of a climbing accident; Gard, Marta's self-absorbed boyfriend who feels guilty for accidentally causing the climbing accident; Asbjørn, a stroke victim full of suppressed anger; Lillemor, an old divorced woman who complains often.  Tori does her best to get Geirr to appreciate his life. The rest of the group helps her by offering sympathy and encouragement. Tori tells Geirr to focus on solutions and not problems, while Geirr rebels. With irreverence he promotes the view that there are no solutions at all. Eventually he turns the group to his side by having them acknowledge and revel in their problems, dropping the facade of positive thinking and happiness.  As Geirr gradually takes control of the group he initiates arguments about who is the worst off with the most serious problems, and who is [[malingerer]]ing or does not belong. After dramatic emotional breakdowns, the group members discover solidarity and emotional release by being honest and dropping the facade they have built around themselves. They become familiar with each other, they become friends, and they learn the art of thinking negatively.<ref>Irina Echarry  [http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=17052 The Art of Negative Thinking] December 12, 2009 Havana Times</ref>

Artie Lange's Beer League
  Artie DeVanzo ([[Artie Lange]]) is an unemployed town drunk who plays softball with his buddies Maz ([[Ralph Macchio]]) and Johnny (Jimmy Palumbo) for Ed's Bar and Swill. Their arch-rival is Manganelli Fitness, led by Dennis Manganelli ([[Anthony DeSando]]). After the teams brawl during the first game of the year, the town's police chief decides whichever team finishes best in the league that season can still play in the league, and whichever team loses is out for good.  Artie lives at home with his mother ([[Laurie Metcalf]]) and can never hold a job or a girlfriend for very long. After a night out with his pals, he ends up at a diner for late night food, where he sees old flame Linda Salvo ([[Cara Buono]]) out with her friends. Artie abandons his friends and starts some small talk with Linda, which results in a one-night stand. At first Linda is disgusted and annoyed that she let herself fall into another meaningless encounter, but Artie decides to actually try to attempt a more meaningful relationship with her.  The Ed's team, traditionally a league doormat, decides to actually practice in an attempt to beat out Manganelli and stay in the league. The regular season is highlighted by Maz's bachelor party and wedding, and Johnny's attempt to bat .700 for the year.  The team charges up the standings to qualify for the championship game against the four-time defending champions from Manganelli Fitness. However, 'Dirt', Ed's Bar and Swill's team pitcher, collapses and dies from a heart attack at practice in the days leading up to the championship. After the funeral, the rest of the team drinks heavily in homage to Dirt before they play in the championship game scheduled for that afternoon.  Manganelli's team quickly builds a 10–0 lead over their inebriated opponents, and that remains the score heading into the final inning of the game. After two outs, the season rests on Artie's shoulders.  Artie proceeds to launch a Manganelli pitch over the fence in left field for a solo home run, an incredibly rare feat that nobody in the league has done "since '89". That shot only makes the score 10–1, but Ed's Bar and Swill comes to life and bats around the lineup in the inning, bringing Artie back to the plate, now with the bases loaded and the score 10–6, though still with two outs.  Artie hits the ball to right field, where nobody is stationed because Manganelli has his fielders playing the "DeVanzo Shift"; completely dead-pull. All three baserunners come home, and as the ball is thrown away, Artie races home in an attempt to tie the score. He and Manganelli have a collision at the plate, but Manganelli hangs on to the ball for the final out and a 10–9 victory.  After the game ends, however, Artie keeps his vow of not letting Manganelli have the championship trophy, stealing it during the postgame awards ceremony and driving off down Route 3 past Giants Stadium, heading for the Jersey Shore with Linda, talking about other leagues in other towns and how he can still play in them.

Asterix and the Vikings
 A tribe of [[Vikings]] feel flustered because in every raid they find their target locations devoid of people. Cryptograf, an advisor to Viking chief Timandahaf, says that the enemies always disappear because "Fear gives them wings". Timandahaf excitedly concludes that they must find a "Champion of Fear", who can teach them to be great cowards so they can fly, making them invincible. The chief says he'll give anything to whoever can bring him this Champion of Fear. Cryptograf hatches a secret plan to seize power and tells the chief they'll find the Champion of Fear in [[Gaul]].  During a typical day in the Gaulish village, chief Vitalstatistix announces the imminent arrival of his nephew Justforkix, who is to be trained to be a man. When Justforkix arrives from Parisium, he doesn't look like warrior material. He uses his bird SMS (Shortmessageservix) to send messages to his "babes". Besides chasing girls, he's into hi-tech, nightlife, and dancing — and he's a [[vegetarian]], much to the dismay of Obelix, who can't get him to try [[wild boar]].  In [[Norway]], as the Vikings prepare to start their quest, the chief's wife, Vikea, orders her husband to get her some flat-packed easy-to-assemble furniture from his raids, while his daughter, Abba, insists on going along, but meets with a flat refusal. Abba disguises herself as a man and goes anyway.  Meanwhile, Asterix and Obelix proceed with training Justforkix, but with little (if any) success. He runs screaming from any danger and refuses to drink (non-organic) potion. Upon the Vikings' arrival in Gaul, Cryptograf explains to his incredibly stupid son, [[Characters in Asterix|Olaf]], that ''he'' must capture the Champion of Fear, and claim the prize of anything he wants, which Cryptograf says is the chief's daughter, Abba. Since the chief has no son, this would put Olaf in line to become the next chief (with Cryptograf calling the shots, of course).  Olaf captures Justforkix, and Asterix and Obelix have to retrieve him before the next full moon when his father, Doublehelix, plans to return to their village. Asterix and Obelix arrive on Iceland shortly after the Vikings, but they can't rescue Justforkix. He doesn't want to leave because he considers the Vikings (especially Abba) as his friends. However, the Vikings decide to test Justforkix's flying skills by throwing him off a cliff. Cryptograf secretly rigs up a rope to Justforkix, allowing him to be suspended in the foggy air and thus convincing the Vikings that he really can fly.  The Vikings rush off to Olaf's wedding ceremony, leaving the Champion of Fear dangling. Asterix and Obelix return just in time to rescue Justforkix before the rope breaks. On the way to Gaul, Justforkix sneaks some magic potion from Asterix and swims back to stop the wedding and to rescue Abba. Later, he discovers that he really can fly as he rescues Abba from another precarious spot – using a [[hang-glider]] improvised from a ship's mast and sail.  Back in the Gaulish village, everyone gathers to celebrate the wedding of Justforkix and Abba. All the Vikings (except Abba because of her improvised ear muffs) finally experience real fear when they hear a ballad sung by Cacofonix. When Asterix asks him what fear is good for, Getafix explains that we can only be courageous when we have some kind of fear to overcome.

The Astronaut Farmer
 Charles Farmer is a former [[U.S. Air Force]] fighter pilot and [[astronaut]]-in-training who reluctantly resigned from the space program and was discharged from the military before he could fulfill his dream of becoming a vital part of [[NASA]].  He did so in order to take over his family's failing ranch in Texas after his financially strapped father's suicide prior to the ranch being foreclosed on.   Having missed the opportunity to travel into space, he decides to build a working replica of the historic [[Mercury-Atlas]] rocket and spacecraft in the barn on his secluded ranch in the fictional town of Story, Texas, using all his assets and facing his own [[foreclosure]] of the ranch as a result. But he has done so with the ongoing support of his wife Audrey, his teenage son Shepard, and young daughters Stanley and Sunshine. When he begins making inquiries about purchasing rocket fuel, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] step in to investigate, and the ensuing publicity thrusts Farmer into the spotlight and makes him a media darling.  Farmer's launch is delayed by endless [[red tape]] created by U.S. government officials from the FAA, FBI, CIA, NASA and the Department of Defense, who seek to stall him beyond his deadline and force his creditors to foreclose on the farm. Farmer was counting on publicity to help him financially. He is denied the [[hydrazine]] fuel he requires, with government officials claiming he is a security risk and that it is too dangerous to allow a private citizen to launch a space vehicle. Facing financial ruin, he panics, climbs aboard, and, using a less-than-optimal substitute fuel, he somehow launches the rocket. However, after only a foot or two of vertical lift, the rocket descends back down, falls over, and horizontally blasts out of the old wooden barn where it was constructed.  Farmer nearly dies from [[head trauma]] and other injuries after his capsule is thrown from the rocket. News media, spectators and all their vehicles are nearly crushed in the process. During the months he spends recuperating, public interest in his project wanes, and while he recovers slowly, he is depressed at the failure of the project and of his dream.   Fortunately, an inheritance from her father, Hal, is unexpectedly left to Audrey after his death, which allows them to bring their debts current. Audrey, realizing how much Charles' dream means to the entire family, encourages Charles to construct another rocket, financing it with the rest of her inheritance. He is able to do so in relative privacy.   Using a ruse to distract snooping government officials, Charles succeeds in launching the rocket, while the FAA claims no such thing has occurred. As the rocket rises out of the barn, the locals and law enforcement authorities in the area are amazed to watch it rise into space. After orbiting Earth nine times and suffering a brief period of a communication blackout, Charles returns safely and is given a hero's welcome home, appearing on the [[Tonight Show]] with [[Jay Leno]] and as seen in still photos shown during the [[end credits]], while playing [[Elton John]]'s [[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]].  
Atomised (film)
 The film focuses on Michael (Michael Djerzinski) and Bruno and their disturbed [[male sexuality|sexuality]]. They are half-brothers who are very different from each other. They both had an unusual childhood because their mother was a [[hippie]], instead growing up with their grandmothers and in [[boarding school]]s.  Michael grows up to become a [[molecular biologist]] and in doing so becomes more fascinated with [[genetics]] and separating [[reproduction]] and sexuality by [[cloning]] rather than having actual sexual relationships. He is frustrated by his current job in [[Berlin]] and decides to continue his research on cloning at an institution in [[Ireland]]. Bruno, a secondary school teacher and unsuccessful author, on the other hand, is obsessed with his own sexual desires and systematically drowns himself in failed attempts with women and nights with prostitutes. He voluntarily checks himself into a mental institution after having [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] one of his students.  Before his departure to Ireland, Michael visits the village of his childhood for the first time in years. To his surprise, he meets his childhood friend Annabelle there and finds that she is still single and they start a sexual relationship. Bruno leaves the mental institution and goes on holiday to a hippie camp after being faced with divorce by his wife. At the camp he meets Christiane, who is also sexually open. Although they have an open relationship, he falls in love with her.  During a sex orgy at one of their visits to a [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swing club]], Christiane collapses and Bruno is faced in hospital with the news that Christiane is paralysed forever because of a chronic illness. Nonetheless Bruno wants to live with her until the end. However Christiane insists that he should take some time for consideration. Michael moves to Ireland and learns that, despite his doubts, his old research on cloning was a revolutionary breakthrough. However he misses Annabelle but does not manage to get her on the phone. Annabelle is informed that she is pregnant but must have an abortion and her womb removed due to life-threatening abnormalities. Bruno calls Christiane but always replaces the receiver after just one ring. He finally drives to her apartment only to learn that she has committed suicide shortly before. Subsequently he re-enters mental institution totally devastated. Michael is told by Annabelle's mother that Annabelle had an abortion and a severe surgery. He immediately leaves Ireland for Annabelle and finally openly admits his deep love to her.  In hospital Bruno has [[hallucination]]s of Christiane who explains to him that her suicide was not his fault. In his imagination he tells her that he ultimately has decided to stay with her forever. After Annabelle recovers and before their departure to Ireland, Michael and Annabelle visit Bruno in hospital and take him to the beach. Michael asks Bruno if he wants to come with Annabelle and him to Ireland but Bruno decides to live happily in hospital with Christiane in his mind forever.  The film ends with title cards stating that Michael Djerzinski received the [[Nobel Prize]]. This too is fiction.  
Attack Force (film)
 Marshall Lawson ([[Steven Seagal]]) is the commander of an elite U.S. military unit. During an overseas assignment in [[Paris]], Lawson loses all three of his men in a seemingly random attack on their hotel room. He takes it upon himself to investigate the attack, with the help of his girlfriend Tia (Lisa Lovbrand) and his friend Dwayne ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]). Marshall uncovers CTX, a covert military drug so secret that an arm of the military headed by a man named Werner ([[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]]) wants Marshall eliminated. Tia turns out to be one of the two military scientists who developed CTX.  Reina (Evelyne Armela O'Bami), the hooker who slaughtered Marshall's team, was under the influence of CTX. The drug gives its users superhuman strength and agility, but also irrevocably drives them to violence. The other co-inventor of CTX is Aroon ([[Adam Croasdell]]), now a Paris night club owner. Aroon has plans to release the CTX into the Paris' water supply, which would turn the city's residents into deranged killers. Marshall, Tia, and Dwayne must stop Aroon and Werner before that happens.  
Augusta, Gone
 The film dramatically opens with a [[voice-over]] from Augusta ([[Mika Boorem]])'s mother Martha ([[Sharon Lawrence]]), in which she states that her daughter was once a sweet girl who had the ability to paint beautiful pictures and loved everybody. In fact, later on in the film, Augusta is described as a 'strong, creative, kind and magnificent person' by her mother. This description is in dissonance to the condition in which Augusta's parents find their daughter at a local party. Her parents realize that they need to take drastic and immediate action when they find Augusta in a drug-induced [[euphoria|euphoric]] state. The problem is, however, they are unsure as to how to proceed. Upon their arrival at home, Augusta seems [[contrite]] and willing to make amends. However, her mood abruptly switches when Martha and her husband, Ben ([[Tim Matheson]]) attempts to address the situation. When an explosive fight ensues, culminating in Augusta pointing a [[butcher knife]] at her parents and later at herself, she begins screaming in a threatening manner: "It's my life! It's my life!"  The movie then cuts to one year earlier with a 14-year-old Augusta worrying about her weight and what her classmates think of her. Owing to the camera angles, it appears that Augusta has a significantly distorted view of herself and is exceptionally dissatisfied with the image that she sees in the mirror. On face value, Augusta appears to be a good-spirited young artist who is slightly perturbed by the fact that although her mother is speaking to her, her mother fails to notice "how fat" her daughter has become. Martha is a divorced businesswoman who appears to have had a good relationship with her daughter.  Underneath the surface, Augusta is very insecure and despises herself. For example, she is overly concerned with her weight and strives to perform well in school. She becomes very anxious when she does not attain perfection and worries about receiving excellent grades in school. Augusta's life becomes complicated and takes a turn for the worse when she becomes friends with Rain ([[Tamara Hope]]), the local "bad girl". Augusta then attempts to impress Rain by doing stuff that she would not otherwise do, such as smoking cigarettes. Augusta then adopts a blasé attitude towards her schoolwork, her family, her old friends and her own well-being. Her [[self-destructive]] ways cause her life to spiral out of control.     Augusta begins to accept Rain's bad habits and makes a drastic change in her once predictable, sensible and normative life. She begins sneaking out at night, using [[drugs]] (even getting her younger brother Jack ([[Sage Testini]]) to try [[marijuana]]), [[shoplifting]], skipping school, and disrespecting authority. Martha begins to notice the extreme changes in her daughter's behavior and is at a loss at how to help get Augusta back on track. When Augusta calls her mother at work in a state of panic after a drug-laden night, Martha fears for Augusta's safety. Unfortunately, Augusta rejects any form of assistance and insists that she had a cold, and all that she had taken was some medication.  At one point in the film, Augusta screams at her mother to give up on her. It is apparent that Martha is not prepared to turn her back on Augusta. With nowhere to turn, Martha goes to a [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselor]] for help. Augusta is quick to dismiss any [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] that her mother makes. The counselor tells Martha that in order to be saved, Augusta must attend a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation center]] for teens. Hesitant at first, Martha finally agrees.  Martha's pain is exacerbated because [[Mother's Day]] is the agreed upon date for Augusta's departure. The police find Augusta, and she is sent to the rehabilitation center. During the transfer Augusta angrily tells her mother that she hates her, and that she is dead to her. Martha is left in tears.     During the program Augusta meets Bridget, a young girl who discloses to Augusta that she was [[rape]]d by her father's best friend. They become closer when Bridget convinces Augusta to stop [[self-mutilation|cutting herself]]. Throughout rehab, Augusta begins to appreciate the consequences of her misbehavior. At the end, Augusta seems to have changed, but the counselors don't think that she has been fully rehabilitated. Against Augusta's will, she is sent with Bridget to a special school for [[juvenile delinquents]].  At the school, Augusta meets a counselor named Rose who finally is able to reach her. She sits down with her parents, confesses what she has done and asks for forgiveness. She lists all the drugs that she has tried and even discloses that she felt [[suicidal]] at times. Although her parents are shocked, they are relieved that Augusta has become more open and coherent about her lifestyle.  Martha accepts and assures Augusta that she will always be loved and that she will never give up on her. Rose lets Augusta spend time with her parents only if she promises not to run away. What finally gets Augusta to change her ways and realize how good she really has it is seeing Bridget, who has nothing to return to, die of a [[drug overdose]].     After the [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] experience, Augusta, who feels she is successfully rehabilitated, runs away from the program and gets in touch with her mother and asks to go home. Martha agrees but only if Augusta promises to reform. Augusta promises, and gets a bus home. Martha meets her at the bus stop, and mother and daughter embrace, while Ben and Jack happily reunite with her as well.  It is after this embrace when Augusta and her family walk away from the bus stop, the audience sees the real Martha and Augusta smiling into the camera.

Astram (film)
  The story starts off by showing gun smuggling and gun running via bags of mirchi (dried red peppers) throughout the country to nefarious dacoits and criminals. Shortly after one group gets their shipment of guns, they block off a road with rocks and stop a wedding bus, kill the conductor and the driver, drive everyone from the wedding party out of the bus and gun them all down and steal their gold ornaments/jewelry and other valuables. Even women and children are not spared. This leads the government police department to establish a special task force headed by Hyderabad Crime Branch, ACP Siddharth IPS (Manchu Vishnu). They go to Chittoor (the location of the wedding bus massacre) and set up their own road block and capture some of the criminals/dacoits who were responsible as well as arrest the SI of that area. During interrogation, they get a lead back to Hyderabad, but their superior officer wants them to bring the SI to him before the Press gets wind of this arrest and things get blown out of proportion. While taking the SI to their superior officer, the SI cruelly teases and bullies and gets pushed out the back of the jeep and gets run over by a lorry and this incident is filed as “an accident”.   Flashback to 4 years ago; Siddharth and Anusha (Anushka Shetty) both attend the same dance class and like each other but neither wants to make the first move to express their love for the other. Siddharth tricks Anusha into expressing that she has feelings for him but he fails to show up as promised that evening and is absent for the next 4 years.  Back to the present, Khadar Vali aka “KV” (Jackie Shroff) is a singer who has been invited back to the dance/song school to put on presentations. During an outing, Siddharth realizes that he is being followed, but brainless jabber mouth Anusha, not believing that Siddharth is an ACP, confronts the tail and nearly screws up the arrest that Siddharth had planned with his team. The perp gets stabbed in the police van before he could spill any information.   Another flashback by Siddharth to Karim (Rahul Dev) shows why he was MIA for 4 years and spent thqat time to do IPS and became an ACP…his father had his neck broken is in bad health as a result, his sister-in-law is a widow because her husband was murdered, and his uncle has sacrificed everything in his life to help the family cope with their troubles. All these troubles came to happen because the Police were working with the criminal and immediately intimated that a witness (Siddharth’s father played by Sarath Babu) had came forward to identify and testify against him. The criminal and his gang went after Siddharth’s father and in the process killed Siddharth’s brother.   Back to the present, the task force uses the information in the dead criminal’s cell phone that they captured to find when and where the next consignment of illegal weapons will come through and stake out the place in the hopes of capturing it and the criminal smugglers. They find that Pulla Rao is one of the smugglers, and shortly after he appears, a lorry containing large shipment of illegal firearms shows and the bags of mirchi are off loaded onto various jeeps for further distribution. While trying to apprehend Pulla Rao, a shootout ensues. Karim arrives to help out, but Pulla Rao and his goons get away and Siddharth breaks his leg.  Back in Rameswaram, the leader of the smuggling ring gets a phone call reporting that their entire shipment was seized, but Pulla Rao and Sardar managed to avoid capture. It is then revealed that the ring leader is none other than Khadar Vali aka KV (Jackie Shroff) who is now under pressure from his clients not just for more weapons that they have paid for but also for ammunition that is running low (ammunition was also seized), and what use is a gun without ammunition? It would be nothing more than an expensive and very clumsy club. The smuggling ring try to buy off (bribe) Siddharth and if he doesn’t take the bribe and stay out of their business, then they will kill him. After fighting off the smuggler, Siddharth uses Karim’s help to navigate a facial construction software to create an image of his attacker and distribute that to all police stations to see if they can get an ID on the culprit. During the scuffle at the dhaba where they seized the large shipment, Siddharth remembers that something came out of one of the smugglers bag and flew into the underbrush. He goes back to the dhaba and traces out his steps and finds Sardhar’s horoscope. They use this information to back trace the where Sardhar probably lives and therefore the point of origin of where the illegal weapons are entering the country and think that it is Rameswaram. There, KV finds out that the ACP he was looking for was actually Siddharth.   Siddharth and his team raid the next shipment and capture and start interrogating Bullet Basha (a higher up in the smuggling ring) for information but is called off for a school function that his nephew is part of. At the school function, Siddharth’s dad recognizes the swastika tattoo on the forearm of the criminal that broke his neck and caused the death of his son (Siddharth’s brother) and it is none other than the current DGP. At this time, the team also finds out that all the weapons that were seized are now missing from evidence and when Siddharth offers to go and investigate the disappearance, the DGP overrules him and says that he will do it personally. The only evidence left at the scene is a handkerchief with the initials “PD” so Karim uses a sniffer dog and the dog goes straight at the DGP confirming Siddharth’s suspicions.  The DGP surreptitiously arranges for Siddharth’s nephew to be kidnapped for exchange for Bullet Basha (trade). After rescuing his nephew, Siddharth tries a new number that they retrieved and finds out that the real culprit (king pin) is none other than KV himself. The team of six decide to try a near suicide attempt to stop the latest shipment. At the end, Siddharth plays KV against DGP and gives them both the opportunity to kill the other before the other kills them, but only one gun (the one given to KV) had a bullet in it and so the DGP dies. After a fiery speech by Siddharth admonishing KV for his actions and pitting Hindu vs. Muslim, Karim handcuffs KV, but KV has different ideas than to be taken to prison and so impales himself on the bayonet of an officer’s rifle and thereby committing suicide.  At the end of the movie, the team comes to meet Siddharth to inform him that another bus atrocity similar to the one in the beginning of the movie, just occurred, but the difference is that the culprits were using entirely new types of weapons, suggesting that there is now a new smuggling ring and a new leader to chase down.

Automatons (film)
 Somewhere in the distant future, The Girl is living alone in a bunker. She continues to fight with the generations-long war with the assistance of a group of antiquated robot helpers and soldiers.  Her only connection to her people is a collection of recorded journal entries made by the scientist who cared for her as a baby. His is the only friendly human face she’s ever seen. These entries gradually disclose the fall of mankind: escalating war that destroyed Earth's atmosphere, human reproductive abilities, and all hope for future. The Girl is revealed to be a clone, created as a last attempt to restore the humanity's dwindling numbers.  The regular radio transmissions from her enemy's leader are always filled with threats and taunts. The girl responds with attacks of her own, carried out by her mechanical soldiers on the contaminated surface where no human can survive.  After a transmission is used to intercept control of the robots, the girl decides to launch a full-scale assault on the enemy base, and does so, succeeding by hiding inside one of the machines (using it as an exoskeleton). Upon defeating the enemy remnants, she is told by dying enemy leader that they are the last people on the planet, rumors of prosperous nations being just myths.  The girl is put before a choice to either spare the enemy leader, or kill her. Believing that she lies, the girl executes the last of her foes. This activates the large EMP generator, however, which the enemy never used before (as using it would doom themselves too). All machines and bunker life support cease to function, leaving the girl alone, trapped within the enemy base, with no way out. The film ends with her calmly staring in the illuminator.

A new opportunity arises when the American film director Brian Sobinski arrives in [[Paris]] to cast a new film based on the life of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. * Jean-François is a world-renowned pianist who wants nothing more than to share his playing with those who would appreciate it least, and to get away from formal classical music concerts.  This disconcerts his wife Valentine, who is also his manager, because of all the planning that she has done for his career. * Jacques is an art collector who has decided to sell off his collection towards the end of his life.  He and his son Frédéric have a somewhat strained relationship, not helped by the fact that Jacques is in a relationship with the much younger Valérie, with whom Frédéric himself once had an affair.

Babel (film)
 ''Babel'' focuses on four interrelated sets of situations and characters, and many events are revealed out of sequence. The following plot summary has been simplified and thus does not reflect the exact sequence of the events on screen.  ===Morocco=== In a desert in [[Morocco]], Abdullah, a goatherder, buys a [[.270 Winchester]] [[Winchester Model 70|M70 rifle]] and a box of ammunition from his neighbor Hassan Ibrahim to shoot the jackals that have been preying on his goats. Abdullah gives the rifle to his two young sons, Yussef and Ahmed, and sends them out to tend the herd. Ahmed, the older of the two, criticises Yussef for spying on their sister while she changes her clothes. Doubtful of the rifle's purported three-kilometer range, they decide to test it out, aiming first at rocks, a moving car on a highway below, and then at a bus carrying Western tourists. Yussef's bullet hits the bus, critically wounding Susan Jones ([[Cate Blanchett]]), an American woman from [[San Diego]] who is traveling with her husband Richard ([[Brad Pitt]]) on vacation.<ref></ref> The two boys realize what has happened and flee the scene, hiding the rifle in the hills.  Glimpses of television news programs reveal that the US government considers the shooting a terrorist act and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Having traced the rifle back to Hassan, the Moroccan police descend on his house and roughly question him and his wife until they reveal that the rifle was given to him by a Japanese man, and then sold to Abdullah. The two boys see the police on the road and confess to their father what they have done, believing at the time that the American woman has died of her wounds. The three flee from their house, retrieving the rifle as they go. The police corner them on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire. After Ahmed is hit in the leg, Yussef returns fire, striking one police officer in the shoulder. The police continue shooting, hitting Ahmed in the back, possibly fatally injuring him. As his father rages with grief, Yussef surrenders and confesses to the crimes, begging clemency for his family and medical assistance for his brother. The police take him into custody.  This first plotline is interspersed with scenes of Richard and Susan, who came on vacation to Morocco to get away from and mend their own woes. The death of their infant third child, to [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]], has strained their marriage significantly and they struggle to communicate their frustration, guilt, and blame. When Susan is shot on the tour bus, Richard orders the bus driver to the nearest village, [[Tazarine]]. There, a local [[veterinarian]] sews up Susan's wound to stem the loss of blood. Richard contacts the US embassy to request an ambulance. The other tourists wait for some time, but they eventually demand to leave, fearing the heat and that they may be the target of further attacks. Richard tells the tour group to wait for the ambulance, which never arrives, and eventually the bus leaves without them. The couple stays behind with the bus's tour guide, Anwar, still waiting for transport to a hospital. Political issues between the US and Morocco prevent quick help, but eventually a helicopter arrives and carries Richard and Susan to a hospital in [[Casablanca]], where she is expected to recover. Richard calls his children's nanny, Amelia, from the hospital, and they agree not to tell the children that Susan has been shot yet. Richard cries as his son tells him about his day at school.  ===Japan=== Chieko Wataya (綿谷 千恵子 ''Wataya Chieko'', [[Rinko Kikuchi]]) is a rebellious, deaf Japanese teenage girl, traumatized by the recent suicide of her mother. She is bitter towards her father, Yasujiro Wataya (綿谷 安二郎 ''Wataya Yasujirō'', [[Kōji Yakusho]]) and boys her age. She starts exhibiting sexually provocative behavior, partly in response to dismissive comments from a member of her volleyball team. While out with friends, Chieko finds a teenage boy attractive, and following an unsuccessful attempt at socialising, exposes herself to him under a table. Chieko encounters two police detectives who question her about her father. She and her friends take [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pills in public and attend a rave. Chieko sees one of her friends kissing another boy whom she had spent the evening flirting with, and leaves the party alone.  She invites one of the detectives, Kenji Mamiya (真宮 賢治 ''Mamiya Kenji'', Satoshi Nikaido), back to the high-rise apartment she shares with her father. Wrongly supposing that the detectives are investigating her father's involvement in her mother's suicide, she explains to Mamiya that her father was asleep when her mother jumped off the balcony and that she witnessed this herself. It turns out the detectives are investigating a hunting trip Yasujiro took in Morocco. Soon after learning this, Chieko approaches Mamiya nude and attempts to seduce him. He resists her approaches but comforts her as she bursts into tears. Before he leaves, Chieko writes him a note, indicating that she does not want him to read it until he is gone.  Leaving the apartment, Mamiya crosses paths with Yasujiro and questions him about the rifle. Yasujiro explains that there was no black market involvement; he gave his rifle as a gift to Hassan Ibrahim, his hunting guide on a trip in Morocco. About to depart, Mamiya offers condolences for the wife's suicide. Yasujiro, however, is confused by the mention of a balcony and angrily replies: "My wife shot herself in the head. Chieko was the first to find the body. I've explained this to the police many times." After leaving, Mamiya stops at a bar to read Chieko's note. The note's contents are not revealed. Chieko is leaning on the balcony nude when her father enters the apartment, and the two embrace as she breaks down in tears.  ===United States/Mexico=== Richard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia ([[Adriana Barraza]]), tends to their children, Debbie ([[Elle Fanning]]) and Mike ([[Nathan Gamble]]), in their San Diego, California home while they are in Morocco. When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced to take care of the children longer than planned and becomes worried that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she has to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near [[Tijuana]], Mexico. Her nephew Santiago ([[Gael García Bernal]]) offers to take her and the kids to the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Intoxicated and worried, Santiago trespasses the border. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, attempting to lead off the police; his fate after this is unknown.  Stranded without food and water, Amelia and the children are forced to spend the night in the desert. Realizing that they will all die if she cannot get help, Amelia leaves the children behind to find someone, ordering them not to move. She eventually finds a [[US Border Patrol]] officer. After he places Amelia under arrest, she and the officer travel back to where she had left the children, but they are not there. Amelia is taken back to a Border Patrol station, where she is eventually informed that the children have been found and that Richard, while outraged, has agreed not to press charges. However, she is told she will be deported from the US where she has been working illegally. Her plea that she has been in the US for 16 years and has looked after the children (whom she considers "her children") for their entire lives does not secure lenient treatment. Amelia meets her son on the Mexican side of the Tijuana crossing, still in the red dress she wore for the wedding, now torn and dirty from her time in the desert.

Bambi realizes the Great Prince had planned on sending him away and snaps at his father, while the Great Prince concludes that he is not meant to raise Bambi. Bambi sadly accepts the change.  On the way to Mena's den, Ronno shows up to taunt Bambi one last time. The two get into another fight that sets off one of Man's traps, which ensnares Mena and alerting Man. While Ronno flees, Bambi saves Mena by leading Man's dogs away from her, as his father arrives and works to set her free. The dogs chase Bambi through the forest, and his friends help him fend them off. Using the techniques the Great Prince taught him, Bambi evades all but one of the dogs. Cornered at the top of a rocky peak by the last dog, Bambi kicks it off a cliff, but falls off as well when it crumbles beneath him. His friends and his father all grieve him until Bambi reveals he is still alive, and he and the Great Prince reconcile.  Sometime later, Thumper shares his version of the chase with the rest of his friends, and Bambi, whose antlers have just grown in, enjoys the tall tale with Faline. Ronno appears and vows vengeance on both of them, until he is bitten on the nose by a snapping turtle and runs off, screaming for his mother for help. Bambi eventually leaves to meet up with the Great Prince, who shows Bambi the field where he and Bambi's mother met in childhood.  
Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas
 As the movie's title implies, [[Daffy Duck]] stars in an [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]-like role in the Looney Tunes retelling of this classic tale.  In the beginning of the movie, [[Bugs Bunny]] (in a Fred-like role) pops up out of his hole to clear away the snow, and explains to the viewers he's all about winter holidays, despite the fact that rabbits are traditionally associated with [[Easter]]. He's then almost run over by Daffy Duck's gas guzzling [[Hummer]].  Daffy's the Scrooge-like owner of the Lucky Duck Superstore (a [[Costco]]-esque megastore), and he treats his employees (played by other Looney Tunes) like they're garbage. Despite Bugs' scolding him for berating [[Playboy Penguin]], Daffy still acts snobbish and tries to abscond with the money Priscilla Pig, [[Egghead, Jr. (Looney Tunes)|Egghead Jr.]], [[Henery Hawk]] and [[Barnyard Dawg|Barnyard Dawg Jr.]] are collecting for charity. Daffy especially has trouble with his hover scooter, and gets beat up by his own employees (through no fault of their own) and the customers (since he insulted them). After Daffy states he hates the holidays, Bugs warns him about the Ghosts of Christmas, which Daffy simply scoffs at.  After working his employees to the bone on Christmas Eve, Daffy expects them all back at 5:00 AM on Christmas Day, so he can make more money off of last minute shoppers. Assistant Manager [[Porky Pig]] in a [[Bob Cratchit]]-like role pleads to let him go home for Christmas and spend time with his daughter, Priscilla, who's in a [[Tiny Tim (A Christmas Carol)|Tiny Tim]]-like role, but Daffy refuses and Bugs warns him that bad things happens to people like him (referring to [[A Christmas Carol]]) and tells him "Bah, Humduck!", (an adaption of Scrooge's "Bah, Humbug!") which Daffy then takes as his own.  Later that day, the spirit of his deceased business idol Sylvester the Investor ([[Sylvester (Looney Tunes)|Sylvester the Cat]] in a [[Jacob Marley]]-like role), who's clad in chains as punishment for his greed after a disgruntled employee used a forklift on him. He warns Daffy that if he doesn't change his ways, he will be doomed to the same fate. He tells Daffy that he still has a chance of escaping his fate and foretells that three spirits will visit him but Daffy thinks that this is a trick by Bugs and does not believe him. After the visit, he turns down the requests of [[Elmer Fudd]] (who would like some vacation time), [[Marvin the Martian]] (who would like to go home to Mars), and Porky Pig.  At the end of the day, everyone goes home for the night. Later that night, Daffy ends up trapped in the store by a snowdrift with Bugs. He locks himself in his vault to be safe. But the ghosts are not that easily stopped.  The [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] takes on the form of an old lady and a bird ([[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] and [[Tweety]]) then takes him back to his childhood, where they see that Daffy lived at the Lucky Duck Orphanage (with his design from ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' reused), and every Christmas, he was ignored by potential parents, which explains his cold demeanor in the Present Day (and how his store got its name).  The [[Ghost of Christmas Present]] ([[Yosemite Sam]]) then appears, and shows him how sad his employees are and tells him if he doesn't change his ways, his future is very bleak. He shows him what Elmer Fudd, Marvin the Martian, and Porky Pig are doing at the time. By this time, Daffy is starting to feel tender emotion (though he doesn't attribute it as guilt), which earns him another one of the Ghosts' numerous beatings. By this time, he actually dreads the visit of the last ghost and begs Bugs to hide him from it. After a reenactment of Bugs and Daffy's hiding routine, he's left alone and the last ghost appears.  The [[Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]] (the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]]) comes and shows him that because of his greed and selfishness, he's dead. Porky Pig tells Priscilla it happened because Daffy tried to name himself as his own heir, which, of course, is illegal. As a result, Lucky Duck Superstore was closed down leaving everyone out of a job, but allowing them to spend Christmas with their families just like they wanted. After Porky leaves the grave, Priscilla stays longer and reveals that she never hated Daffy; like him, Priscilla can understand what it's like not having family around at the holidays, and feeling that no one should be alone at this time of year, she promises to come visit his grave every year on Christmas. Priscilla leaves a plate of [[Christmas cookies]] on Daffy's grave before following her dad out of the cemetery. Because of Priscilla's kindness, Daffy's cold demeanor melts and his heart breaks. Realizing his greed and selfish nature was to cover up his real wish to be part of a family, Daffy vows to be a kinder and more generous person.  Returning to the present, he starts to make reparations by waking up a nearby Elmer where he enlists his help in exchange for accepting his request for vacation time. He makes Porky the store manager, gives Marvin a rocket to go home to Mars in, hires Playboy Penguin as one of his employees, gives all of his employees the gifts they desired along with a raise and a paid vacation. There's a brief moment when he slides back to his greedy self, contemplating just how he is going to recover all the costs. However, it immediately fades when Priscilla presents a plate of duck-shaped cookies and calls him "Uncle Daffy." Daffy thinks she's pushing it until she kisses him on the cheek and he lets her call him "Uncle Daffy" (implying that he finally got his wish to be part of a family). After Bugs munches on a candy cane, the camera pulls out of the mall to end the movie. Porky and Priscilla finish the movie by saying Porky's famous line: "T-T-T-That's all folks!"

Barbie: Mermaidia
  In ''[[Barbie: Fairytopia|the first film]]'', the wingless flower fairy Elina defeated Laverna, the evil sister of the Enchantress, and the Enchantress gave Elina wings as a reward. This film's plot begins shortly afterward with Elina flying through the air, still having trouble believing that she has wings. As the three are flying, Dandelion, Elina and Bibble, in the air, Bibble notices that someone was following them. Bibble tells it to Elina and soon, Elina learns from a young sea-butterfly fairy that her friend Nalu, the [[merman]] [[prince]], has been kidnapped by several of Laverna’s Fungi at the Crystal Cove. The banished Laverna is seeking out the Immunity Berry, a berry that causes whoever eats it to be immune to all magic. Since Nalu knows how to find the berry, Laverna had sent her Fungi to force Nalu to lead them to the Immunity Berry.  Fungus Maximus, the leader of the Fungi, asks Nalu to take them to the Immunity Berry, but as Nalu refused, Fungus Maximus threatens to pour a bottle of magical poison into the ocean to destroy Mermaidia as Nalu refuses to lead them to the berry. Nalu reluctantly agrees, giving them a magical seaweed to breathe underwater, then taking the Fungi underwater. Elina arrives at the Crystal Cove a short time after this, accompanied by her companion Bibble. She finds no trace of Nalu, but encounters a mermaid named Nori. Nori had planned to meet Nalu at the cove and is unaware of the reason for his absence. When Elina tells her of the kidnapping, Nori insists on going to rescue the prince herself. Elina uses magical seaweed to breathe underwater and follows. Meanwhile, Nalu has delayed the Fungi in their quest by leading them to a place in the ocean called the Carousel of Confusion, where people forget what they’re doing. This allows him to direct them in circles for a long time before Fungus Maximus finally catches on.  Elina soon reaches Mermaidia and finds Nori attempting to learn the location of the oracle Delphine so that she can ask her where to find Nalu. The only people who know Delphine's location are the merfairies, who are nearly impossible to speak with. After Elina helps Nori converse with the merfairies, they learn where Delphine is and both of them go to seek the oracle out. Delphine tells them that they will have to travel to the bottom of the Depths of Despair to find the Mirror of the Mist, which will lead them to Nalu. She also tells them that Elina will have to trade her wings for a tail to be able to swim strong enough to reach the mirror. Delphine gives Elina a magical pearl necklace that will allow her to make this trade. However, if Elina does not get out of the water in a certain amount of time, she will remain a mermaid forever.  Elina and Nori head to the Depths of Despair together, where Nori is soon entrapped by one of the hostile sea plants growing on the shaft’s walls. Elina cannot swim fast enough to rescue Nori, so she is forced to use the necklace to become a mermaid. She then frees Nori and they reach the Mirror of the Mist at the cavern in the bottom of the Depths of Despair. The mirror shows them an image of Nalu, and creates a magical bubble beacon for them to follow. They also find, what is called the Crest of Courage, has appeared on their arms from enduring the Depths of Despair. The bubble takes them to the entrance of a cave filled with boiling hot thermal vents. Nori carefully leads them through, and they find that beyond the vents lies a cavern filled with magical fruits, including one that reveals the eater’s true self. When Nori and Elina reach the surface, they see Nalu being guarded by two Fungi. While Bibble distracts them, the two mermaids free the prince.  Nalu is grateful to be rescued, but tells them that the Fungi leader has reached the cave where the Immunity Berry grows. The three battle with the Fungi to retrieve the berry that Fungus Maximus has picked. They succeed by secretly swapping the berry with a similar-looking substitute, but Elina does not make it out of the water in time, and is forever trapped in mermaid form, thanks to Fungus Maximus threatening to drop his vial of poison in the water if Elina did not surrender the Immunity Berry to him. But upon Nori's suggestion, Elina then decides to risk eating one of the true-self berries herself in the hopes of restoring herself to fairy form. She succeeds, gaining wings even more spectacular than she'd had before. Nori and Nalu reveal their love for each other and Elina returns to Fairytopia.  Meanwhile, Laverna takes a bite from what she believes to be the Immunity Berry but it turns out to be the true-self berry and she transforms into a toad.

Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses
 Barbie stars as Genevieve, one of twelve princesses who live in a castle with their widowed father, King Randolph. The princesses have adventurous and free-spirited natures that are viewed as "unladylike" and "non-proper" by other members of the royal society. This leads King Randolph to summon his cousin, Duchess Rowena, to the castle to help raise the princesses. Unbeknownst to King Randolph, Rowena plans to poison him and get rid of his daughters so that she can become queen. Attempting to break the princesses' spirits, Rowena makes their lives miserable by stripping the castle of everything they love,  making them wear grey dresses and banishing singing and dancing.  The princesses find comfort in their late mother's favorite story, which tells of a magical kingdom where golden flowers grant wishes and princesses can dance at an enchanted pavilion for three nights. The princesses realize that the story contains clues on how to enter the magical kingdom from their own bedroom, by dancing on specific stones on the floor from oldest to youngest. Now inside the magical kingdom, the princesses discover that the water there possesses healing properties.  The next day, the princesses appear tired and the duchess finds their new dancing shoes worn through, arousing her suspicion. The royal cobbler and Genevieve's love interest, Derek, comes to fix their shoes and sees that they are covered in [[Gold|gold dust]]. When King Randolph mysteriously falls ill, Genevieve is prompted to ask Derek to investigate Rowena's true intentions. That night, the princesses return to the magical kingdom to dance. During this time, Derek discovers that Rowena is stealing heirlooms from the castle and dealing with an apothecary, and he rushes back to the castle.  The next morning, the sisters are again exhausted. Rowena interrogates and threatens them, but when they tell her the truth she refuses to believe them, forcing the princesses into servitude. Heartbroken, they return to the magical kingdom, and Rowena finds the princesses gone the next morning. That evening, Derek makes it back to the castle but discovers that the princesses are missing. He sneaks into their bedroom and, remembering the dance Genevieve had shown him earlier, enters the magical kingdom to report his findings to the princesses. Rowena's monkey minion, Brutus, watches as Derek enters the magical kingdom and reports what he has seen back to Rowena. Rowena uses this knowledge to enter the magical kingdom, where she steals some of the gold flowers that grant wishes. Rowena then returns to the castle and destroys the gateway to the magical kingdom with the help of her footman Desmond.  The princesses and Derek are trapped in the magical kingdom. However, they eventually discover that, when Genevieve and Derek dance together, everyone floats up into the sky and they are able to return home through a different gateway that leads to their mother's dance pavilion. Upon returning, they learn that Rowena has taken over as queen. She then hires an army of a dozen soldiers to defend her castle. The princesses need to defeat them to reach the castle. Two of them use a rope to knock a soldier off his horse, injuring him. Some other princesses use their croquet mallets to hit hard balls at the soldiers standing guard on the palace steps, and pushing the visors on their helmets up so they cannot see, and making them trip and fall down the stairs to their deaths. They could not move because of their heavy armor. The soliders watching chase them, however when the chase leads to the end of a bench, the princesses stop at the end of the bench instead of continuing on. The heavily bulked soldier in the back fails to stop in time because of his bulky armour, and knocks them both into a bush, where they cannot get up because of the armour, and die. The princesses break into the castle to confront her. After a struggle, Rowena uses the gold flowers to wish that Genevieve dances forever. When the flower dust comes towards Genevieve, she uses her fan to blow the dust back towards Rowena, who begins to dance. When Desmond tries to help her, he is pulled into the dance, too, and the two villains dance their way out of the castle.  Meanwhile, the youngest of the princesses, Lacey, uses some water brought back from the magical kingdom to heal their dying father. When he heals, King Randolph explains that Rowena had been poisoning him and apologizes to his daughters for not believing them. With the conflict resolved, Genevieve and Derek celebrate their wedding.  
The Banquet (2006 film)
 It is the end of the Tang Dynasty and China is divided. The Crown Prince, Wu Luan, is deeply in love with the noblewoman Little Wan. However, his father, the Emperor, decides to marry Little Wan. Wu Luan, deeply hurt, flees to a remote theatre to study the arts of music and dance. Shortly after Wu Luan's departure, the Emperor is murdered by his brother, Li. The film begins as Empress Wan sends messengers to the theatre, informing Wu Luan that the Emperor has died, and that his uncle will succeed the throne. Unknown to Wan, the usurping Emperor Li has already dispatched riders to assassinate Wu Luan. However, Wu Luan survives the attack and returns to court where he is met by Empress Wan and her [[lady-in-waiting]] Qing Nu, the daughter of Minister Yin, who is officially still engaged to Wu Luan.  The tension in the Imperial Court is high, and when a palace official, Governor Pei Hong, greets Empress Wan as '[[Empress Dowager]]', he and his family are sentenced to a violent death. With his death, Minister Yin's son, General Yin Sun, is sent to fill the position in a distant province, greatly weakening Yin Taichang's position in the court. Wu Luan is asked by the Emperor to perform a brief swordplay ceremony, to practise for the Empress' upcoming coronation. While sparring with harmless swords, the Imperial Guard suddenly produce sharpened swords and attempt to kill Wu Luan. The ceremony is stopped by the Empress, who implies that the Emperor was trying to murder Wu Luan in the ceremony and make it look like an accident. Later in his chambers, a scroll drops mysteriously from the upper balcony to Wu Luan, depicting his father being murdered by his uncle by blowing poison into his ear. Wu Luan enquires at an apothecary, who reveals that the poison used is made from Arsenic trioxide and black scorpions, and nothing on earth is more deadly except for "the human heart".  Meanwhile, the Empress Wan is to have a new coronation ceremony. As a special treat, Wu Luan is required to perform a swordplay ceremony. Instead, as an accomplished singer and dancer, Wu Luan stages a masked mime play that exposes his uncle as his father's murderer. The Emperor is notably shaken, but manages to conjure a plan to remove Wu Luan. Rather than kill the prince and risk alienating Empress Wan, he decides Wu Luan would be traded as a hostage for the prince of a neighbouring kingdom, the Khitans, although it is known that the neighbour prince is an imposter. An ambush by the emperor's men is set up the snowy border with the Khitans' kingdom in the north, but the Yin Taichang's son Yin Sun, following the Empress's command, saves the prince.  Believing that his nephew is dead, and power is firmly in his grip, the Emperor calls for a grand banquet. The Empress comments that it would be bad luck to organise such an auspicious occasion on their 100th day of knowing each other, but the Emperor claims he does not surrender to superstitions. The Empress then decides to poison the Emperor, using the same poison that was used to kill the previous Emperor. All goes according to plan until Qing Nu takes to the stage, claiming to have planned another performance for the occasion, and in tribute to her fiancé, she wears her theatre mask. The scheme to poison the emperor fails as the cup he was to drink out of is instead given to Qing Nu out of respect and partly of pity for her. Upon the climax of the dance, Qing Nu falls down dead on stage, and Wu Luan reveals himself to comfort her in her dying moments. The Emperor realises in horror that the Empress had plotted his death. After a confrontation with Wu Luan, the Emperor commits suicide by drinking the rest of the poisoned wine intended for him. Upon Emperor Li's death, the Empress proclaims Wu Luan the new Emperor. However, Yin Sun, enraged by his sister's death, attempts to kill the Empress to avenge his sister. His blade is stopped by the hand of Wu Luan, and he proclaims in fear that the knife is poisoned. The Empress stabs him through the neck, killing him instantly, but Wu Luan has fatally poisoned himself in the process. Empress Wan is proclaimed Empress Regnant by the Lord Chamberlain.  In the closing scenes, Empress Wan grasps bright red cloth and speaks of the "flames of desire" that she has satiated by taking the throne. Through her private celebrations, she is suddenly pierced by a flying blade from an unknown source. As she is dying, she turns around to face her assailant. Her confusion shifts to horror and anguish, as the blade is then dropped into a mossy [[koi]] bed, and the blood soaks the water.  The film abruptly finishes, with the audience unsure who the mysterious assailant was.  ===Ending=== The ambiguity of the ending can produce many interpretations of who the assailant may be. Asian film critic, Bey Logan, makes a claim that the film makers initially planned for the maid, Ling, to be the mysterious assailant, and the current version of the film still shows more shots of Ling than would be normally expected of such a minor non-speaking character. A popular interpretation is that it is a manifestation of the previous Emperor, exacting revenge and justice.  When paired with the film's sung theme, the ending most likely references [[Jin Yong|Louis Cha]]'s ''wuxia'' novella ''[[Sword of the Yue Maiden]]''.

Basic Instinct 2
 Set in London, the film opens with American best-selling author [[Catherine Tramell]] in a speeding car with her companion, Kevin Franks, a famous English [[association football|football]] star. Tramell takes the man's hand and begins masturbating with it, all the while increasing her vehicle's speed. At the point of [[orgasm]], Tramell veers off the road and crashes into the [[West India Docks]] in [[Canary Wharf]]. She attempts to save her partner but, as she says while being questioned by the police, "When it came down to it, I guess my life was more important to me than his".  Tramell is interrogated by [[Scotland Yard]] Detective Supt. Roy Washburn, who notes that [[Tubocurarine|D-Tubocurarine]], a [[neuromuscular]] blocking agent used to relax muscles during [[general anaesthesia]], was found in her car and in her companion's body, and the companion wasn't breathing at the time of the crash, and that a man named "Dicky Pep" said that he sold Tramell "15 milliliters of DTC last Thursday". Tramell counters by saying that this Dicky Pep must be lying because "you've got him on some other charge and he's trying to deal his way out, if he even exists".  Tramell begins therapy sessions with Dr. Michael Glass, who has conducted a court-ordered psychiatric exam and given testimony in her case. Glass strongly suspects that Tramell is a [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissist]] incapable of telling the difference between right and wrong. Tramell begins to play mind games with Glass, who becomes increasingly frustrated with, yet intrigued by, this mysterious woman. Soon, Glass's own life begins a spiral of destruction.  One night, Glass goes on a date with Michelle Broadwin, and has rough, violent sex with her after dealings with Tramell. Glass receives a phone call from his ex-wife, Denise, in a state of distress. Her partner, Adam Towers, a journalist writing a negative story about Dr. Glass, has been found strangled to death. Glass suspects that Tramell committed the murder and is attempting to frame him for it. More murders begin to surface around Glass as his obsession with Tramell grows and his career and life are threatened – he finds his ex-wife in a bathroom with her throat slit after they have an altercation in a bar. Later, Dicky Pep is killed – eventually, he himself can no longer tell right from wrong, and the police begin to suspect Glass of involvement in the crimes. He confronts Tramell at her apartment where they engage in passionate sex.  The situation comes to a head during a confrontation between Glass and Tramell at her apartment where, after a struggle, Glass attempts to kill Tramell. Tramell gives Glass a copy of the draft of her next novel, titled ''The Analyst''. After reading it, he realises that Tramell has novelised most of the recent events with herself and other people related to Glass, even himself, as characters. Then it turns out that the character based on herself is going to kill a therapist based on Glass's colleague, Dr. Milena Gardosh.  Glass runs to Gardosh's apartment to warn her, finding Tramell there to his dismay. Gardosh tells him that he is no longer in charge of Tramell's therapy and that he's going to have his license revoked, due to bad practice regarding Tramell's treatment. There is a struggle between Glass and Gardosh, in which the latter is knocked out. Tramell then threatens Glass with a gun she carries, but Glass takes it away from her. When Washburn arrives at the scene, Glass shoots him because Tramell told him he had killed the girlfriend of one of Glass's patients just to "nail him".  In the final scene, Tramell pays a visit to Glass at a local [[mental hospital]] where he has been institutionalised, and he learns from her that the subject of her latest best-selling novel was a man very much like him. Tramell claims that she manipulated Glass into committing all those murders for her own amusement, and flashbacks are shown of Glass committing the murders. Tramell leaves with a wicked smirk on her face, while Glass continues to sit silently in his wheelchair, either stymied by frustration and rage or having an enigmatic smile being satisfied with what he has caused (ambiguous end).  
Barnyard (film)
 Otis ([[Kevin James]]) is a carefree cow who prefers playing with his friends rather than accept responsibility. His father Ben ([[Sam Elliott]]) is the leader of the barnyard. After Otis interrupts a barnyard meeting with his wild antics, Ben has a talk with his son, warning him that he will never be happy if he spends his life partying without acting more maturely. Otis ignores his advice and leaves to have fun with his friends Pip the Mouse ([[Jeffrey Garcia|Jeff Garcia]]), Pig the Pig ([[Tino Insana]]), Freddy the Ferret ([[Cam Clarke]]), and Peck the Rooster ([[Rob Paulsen]]). That same day, Otis meets a pregnant cow named Daisy ([[Courteney Cox|Courtney Cox]]), who is accompanied by her friend, Bessy ([[Wanda Sykes]]).  That night, the animals throw a party in the barn. All the animals at the barnyard are there except Ben, who guards the fence line. Otis is assigned a shift along with Ben, but Otis talks himself out of work. Before Otis leaves, Ben tells him that the night he found him as a baby calf stumbling alone in the meadow, he swore he saw the stars dance, thus giving him reason to know his place was at the farm. Later, Ben takes on a pack of coyotes led by Dag ([[David Koechner]]), plundering the chicken coop. He manages to fight off the pack until he is bitten on the leg by the red coyote, making him fall. The Coyotes pile on Ben, but he manages to grab Dag and escapes the pile. He threatens to punch Dag but lets him go, scaring away him and the coyotes. Ben falls on the ground, exhausted. Otis is alerted and he runs outside to his father. Ben dies and is buried on a hill by the farmer ([[Fred Tatasciore]]), and the other animals mourn Ben after the farmer leaves.  After Ben's death, all the animals elect Otis as the new leader of the barnyard. Otis shirks his duties by leaving Freddy and Peck in charge of the coop, then helps the trouble-making Jersey Cows Eddy, Igg, and Bud ([[S. Scott Bullock]], [[John DiMaggio]], and [[Maurice LaMarche]]) teach a lesson to a mean fat youngster called Snotty Boy ([[Steve Oedekerk]]) for cow-tipping, eluding the police along the way. Later that night, when Otis is holding Daisy's hoof under the starlight, he overhears the coyotes chasing a rabbit and leaves Daisy to pursue the coyotes and avenge his father. Otis tries to attack Dag and his pack, but is outnumbered. Since Otis is weaker, Dag proposes a deal: he and his pack will take various barnyard animals at random times and that, if Otis tries to stand up to them, they will slaughter everyone at the barnyard. Otis decides to leave the barnyard, realizing that his chances of victory are slim.  The next morning, before leaving, Otis is informed that the Coyotes took some hens including Maddy (Madeline Lovejoy), a little chick who is one of Otis' friends. Otis realizes that he has been fooled by Dag, as he was not expecting him and the coyotes until tonight, and sets off to rescue the chickens. Otis confronts the pack but is easily defeated after Dag bites him in the leg; however, Pip, Pig, Freddy, Peck, Miles ([[Danny Glover]]), Ben's old friend, and the Jersey Cows arrive to help Otis. Dag tries to attack Otis from behind, but Otis is alerted when Peck successfully manages to crow a warning. Otis catches Dag and warns him to never return to the barnyard. Otis then swings Dag out of the junkyard with a golf club, finally avenging his father's death.  After hijacking a biker gang's motorcycles from the diner, Otis and the rest make it back to the barn to witness Daisy giving birth to a calf that she names Li'l Ben. Otis then takes responsibility and becomes leader of the barnyard as he watches the stars of himself, Daisy and Lil' Ben dance just like Ben said. Mrs. Beady gets ready for bed, but she noticed that Wild Mike is on top of her head.  
A Battle of Wits (2006 film)
 The film is set in China in 370 BC during the [[Warring States period]]. A massive army from the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]] is on its way to attack the [[Yan (state)|Yan state]]. Liang, a [[city-state]] on the Zhao–Yan border, is in peril of being conquered by the Zhao army. Ge Li, a [[Mohism|Mohist]], comes to Liang to help defend the city. Although the King of Liang has already planned for peace talks with the invaders, Ge Li manages to convince him and the people of Liang to put up resistance by warning them of the consequences of surrendering. He also promises the King that the invaders will give up on Liang if they fail to conquer it within a month, because their main target is actually the Yan state. The King has doubts about Ge Li's idea but still puts Ge in command of his army.  Ge Li creates a [[bulwark]] and various traps to halt the Zhao army's advance. When he insists that Zituan lead the archers, Liang Shi (the Liang prince) is angered because he sees Zituan's archery skill as inferior to his. Even though Zituan later proves to be a better archer, Ge Li's style of working puts him at odds with Liang Shi and the other Liang generals. Ge Li also briefly meets Xiang Yanzhong, the commander-in-chief of the Zhao army, for a board game outside the city to understand each other better. During the first Zhao attack, Ge Li's defence tactics worked well—a Zhao general was killed and the invaders were forced to retreat—but the Liang forces also suffered losses from a skirmish with Zhao infiltrators inside the city. Ge Li's success earns him the support of the people and he becomes a highly revered hero. Yiyue, a female cavalry commander, falls in love with Ge Li. However, Ge Li is reluctant to accept her feelings for him and tries to draw boundaries between them. One night, Ge Li and Yiyue scout the Zhao camp and discover that the enemy is digging underground tunnels to bypass their city's defences. Ge Li used that to his advantage by luring the Zhao soldiers into an ambush and then sealing the tunnel exits. The Liang general Niu Zizhang massacres the captured Zhao soldiers even though they were promised that their lives would be spared if they laid down their weapons.  In the meantime, the King feels threatened when he sees Ge Li's growing popularity, so he plots to have Ge stripped off his post and executed on false charges. At the same time, the Liang forces receive news that the Zhao army has retreated. Ge Li plans to leave Liang since his mission is complete. He goes out to check that the Zhao army is indeed retreating. When he returns, he is stopped outside the gates and is accused of starting a war under false pretences and plotting to seize the throne. Just as the Liang soldiers are about to kill Ge Li, Liang Shi shows up, pretends to fight with Ge, and secretly tells Ge to take him hostage in order to buy time for Ge to escape. Ge Li manages to escape but Liang Shi is killed by a rain of arrows meant for Ge Li. Meanwhile, Ge Li's supporters, including Yiyue, are falsely accused of plotting a rebellion against the King and are arrested and tortured. Yiyue denounces the King and is sentenced to death. The King also has her rendered mute to prevent her from speaking up against him. Zituan refuses to turn against Ge Li, so he cuts off his right arm and leaves the Liang army.  One night, just as Yiyue is about to be executed, the Zhao army launches a surprise attack and completely catches the Liang defenders off guard. She is taken back to the prison. Instead of focusing on fighting the invaders, the King orders his soldiers to kill those who try to escape from the city. Liang eventually falls to the Zhao army, and the King and his people are captured. Zituan and his archers manage to escape from Liang, and they join Ge Li outside the city. Xiang Yanzhong sends a message to Ge Li, in which he threatens to kill the people of Liang if Ge does not return to Liang to meet him. Ge Li returns to Liang alone and agrees to play the board game again with Xiang Yanzhong inside a tower. They agree that only the winner can leave the tower. Meanwhile, Zituan and his men flood the areas guarded by Zhao forces and launch an attack. Seeing that reinforcements have arrived, the people of Liang rise up against the Zhao invaders and succeed in defeating them and driving them out of the city. Xiang Yanzhong refuses to leave the tower because he feels that he has lost. After the battle, the King passes by the tower, sees Xiang Yanzhong, and orders Xiang to be killed. While the people of Liang rejoice in their victory, Ge Li rushes to the flooded prison to find Yiyue but arrives too late because she was unable to call out to him for help and has already drowned.  Before the film ends, Ge Li leaves with some orphans to promote peace among the various warring states. The King of Liang meets his downfall five years later: The people can no longer stand his cruelty so they overthrow and execute him. Eventually, the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquers all the other states and unites China under the [[Qin dynasty]].

Richard, her mother's husband is unwittingly cruel, like an obnoxious and malicious child. He is played like  one of Steve Martins "wild and crazy guys" but more repulsively.

In Munich the brothers unintentionally start a brawl that takes down an entire Oktoberfest tent. They participate in Beerfest, an underground drinking game tournament, run by Baron Wolfgang von Wolfhausen ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]), where they discover that the von Wolfhausens are related to the Wolfhouses. The German team reveals that Johann was a stable boy who stole the recipe for "the greatest beer in all ze world" decades ago and ran away with his prostitute mother, Gam Gam. Swearing to get revenge on the Germans, Jan and Todd return to Colorado, where they recruit college drinking friends for an American Beerfest team.  Among them are:  Barry Badrinath who is good at [[drinking games]] like [[Beer Pong]] and has since become a [[male prostitute]], Steve "Fink" Finklestein who has a [[PhD]] in [[Chemistry]], and Phil "Landfill" Krundle who has been known to drink copious amounts of beer.  During the team's year of drinking training, Jan and Todd find out their grandfather did not steal the family beer recipe, but was actually the rightful heir to the family [[brewery]] in [[Bavaria]]. The team uses the rediscovered recipe to brew Schnitzengiggle Beer, which is so good it literally makes them cry. After the German team receive a bottle of Schnitzengiggle in the mail, the Wolfhausen clan goes to America to take the recipe back. Their agent Cherry ([[Mo'nique]]) steals the receipe off Fink's computer,  and drowns Landfill in a beer vat when he catches her. Thinking he committed suicide,  the team decides to disband, but change their mind when Landfill's twin brother Gil joins.  Like his brother, Gil has been known to drink copious amounts of beer and he even invites the other members of the team to call him "Landfill" in honor of his dead brother.  In Germany, the team uses an empty wooden keg as a [[Trojan Horse]] to get inside, where they emerge to boos and jeers. The Americans are allowed to participate after Jan and Todd show how uncannily they resemble the two Beerfest founders, thus convincing the crowd of their von Wolfhausen ancestry. In the finals (bootline chug), Cherry tells Gil at a crucial moment how his brother Phil died, causing Gil to crack and the Germans to win.  Jan offers the Germans a double or nothing opportunity. The Germans tell Jan they already have the recipe and thus no need for a rematch, but Fink points out that Cherry only stole a recipe for a low-carb strawberry beer, which prompts Wolfgang to have Cherry killed. When one of the von Wolfhausens knocks off Fink's [[yarmulke]], he enters into a state of purely concentrated rage (the "Eye of the Jew") which allows him to coach the team to victory, barely gaining the win when the German team's anchor fails to finish "Das Boot" ([[Boot of beer]]) by one drop.  In the post credits, the team go to Amsterdam  to celebrate their victory in winning the brewery. Upon their travels they find Willie Nelson who is in need of a team for an international pot smoking contest.

The lieutenant steps onto the makeshift ramp to peer outside, returning to the doorway to inform the rest of men of the abort. The high-speed winds from outside rip the indicator loose and send it flying into the lieutenant's face. Stumbling backwards, James loses his balance and is sucked out of the plane. Callaghan disobeys orders to stand fast, strikes his commanding officer, and follows the first three, taking a radio with him. When [[Korean People's Army|North Korean forces]] led by Commander Hwang ([[Joseph Steven Yang]]) find the SEALs, two of the Navy SEALs are killed in a gun battle, and James and Callaghan are captured and tortured by Hwang and his men.  After [[South Korea]]n [[Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command|special forces]] rescue James and Callaghan, President Manning and the South Korean government send the SEALs and South Korean special forces to destroy the missile site. But after losing radio contact with the SEALs, the President and his top advisers believe that they have been captured again. Under pressure from his military advisor, General Norman Vance ([[Bruce McGill]]), the President decides to send [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 stealth bombers]] to destroy the site, which would start a full-scale war against North Korea. The SEALs and the South Korean special forces are almost recaptured by Hwang, but he is shot by a defecting officer. James and the South Koreans destroy the missile silo with a bomb before the bombers reach the missile site, which averts the bombing and prevents a full-scale war.  A tribunal convicts Callaghan of striking an officer (1 year) and disobeying an officer (10 years). Due to the "[[Black operation|black op]]" nature of the mission, the transcript of the hearing is deemed [[Classified information in the United States|classified]] and the charges are expunged from his record, leaving him free to return to his family.  Meanwhile, James meets the president in a classified meeting, bringing his mentor [[Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy|Master Chief]] Scott Boytano ([[Keith David]]) as witness to James' receiving of an award.  The film closes with Boytano telling James he was not red flagged because Boytano had never seen anyone who desired so badly as James did to be a SEAL. During the credits there is a news report on the Ryanggang explosion.

Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon
 The film is shot as a documentary set in a world where the killers depicted in famous [[slasher film]]s are real. A female journalist named Taylor Gentry and her two cameramen, Doug and Todd, document the preparations of Leslie Vernon as he prepares to join the ranks of other slasher villains. Leslie takes his identity from an urban legend about a boy who killed his family and was cast into a river by angry townsfolk.  He initially claims to be the vengeful spirit of the slain boy but soon admits that he is an ordinary man named Leslie Mancuso who must rely on conventional tactics rather than supernatural powers. Taylor and her crew film Leslie's meticulous preparations to slaughter a number of teenagers in an abandoned house and then be confronted by a virginal "[[Final girl|survivor girl]]", Kelly. Taylor and her crew come to share Leslie's enthusiasm for his project, but their consciences catch up with them on the night of the murders.  They beg Leslie to call off his killing spree, but Leslie is adamant, believing that his survivor girl will define herself by facing him. Taylor and her crew abandon their documentary and at this point the film shifts from a documentary style to a traditional [[horror film]] presentation. Taylor attempts to warn and rally the remaining teens together to fight Leslie, but Leslie's preparations repeatedly give him the upper hand. The group looks to Kelly - who is revealed to be ''very'' sexually active - for leadership, but she unexpectedly dies when trying to escape.  Taylor quickly realizes that, as a virgin herself, she was Leslie's true survivor girl all along. Leslie continues picking off the group one-by-one until only Taylor remains. She faces Leslie and defeats him in the exact manner he had laid out for her, crushing Leslie's head in the Apple Press,then burns down the shed in which he was defeated. She then runs into Doug and Doc Halloran who survived their encounters with Leslie. However, Leslie's preparations included learning to feign death and slathering himself with flame-retardant gel.  Over the final credits, security camera footage reveals Leslie's charred body sitting up on an autopsy table, still alive, accompanied by the song "[[Psycho Killer]]" by [[Talking Heads]].

The Benchwarmers
 Gus Matthews, Richie Goodman, and Clark Reedy are three adult "nerds"; Clark and Richie were the unpopular children who were constantly bullied and never played because of their lack of athletic ability in baseball despite Gus Matthews being quite good at a young age. When a nerdy boy named Nelson and his friends are kicked off a nearby baseball diamond by a team of [[Bullying|bullies]], Gus and Clark chase the bullies away. When Gus and Clark return with Richie to play again and get back their feel for the game, the bullies return and demand that they leave. Gus challenges the bullies to play them for the field, and the three friends, despite Clark and Richie's poor abilities, win the game. Days later, one of Clark and Richie's bullies, Brad, challenges them to another baseball game with his team, but the three friends win again.  Later, Nelson's billionaire father, Mel, tells the trio that he is impressed with their wins, and explains his plan to hold a round-robin with all the mean spirited little league teams in the state, plus their team. The winners will be given access to a new multimillion-dollar baseball park that he is building. Wanting to capture the spirit and fun they never had when they were kids, the three decide to form the Benchwarmers and join the tournament. They prepare to compete with all the other teams, despite the fact that they are three adults squaring off against nine kids per team. The Benchwarmers begin winning every single game, with Clark and Richie's abilities gradually improving, and the team becomes popular among many nerds and the general public, but much to the frustration of the losing mean-spirited teams, who form a group together.  At the semi-final game, the competing team's coach Wayne bribes the umpire by entering a 30-year-old Dominican man named Carlos into the league claiming him to be 12 years old (despite the fake birth certificate being written in green crayon). Carlos proves to be a professional, purposely stepping on Gus' hand at one point to injure it too much for him to pitch. But the Benchwarmers eventually manage to defeat Carlos by making him too drunk to actually pitch properly and they manage to win when Richie's [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] and [[Heliophobia|heliophobic]] brother Howie is hit by the pitch but forces the winning run.  However, the group of bullies find evidence that Gus was a bully himself as a child; known for using name calling over physical force and had bullied one child so intensely that the boy, named Marcus, had to be sent to a [[mental institution]]. Taking advantage, the bullies expose Gus' secret to the public, resulting in Gus getting kicked out of the team. However, on his wife Liz's advice, Gus sincerely apologizes to Marcus, who before the final game, makes an incredible speech that he forgave him. Gus re-joins the team, announcing that Marcus is the Benchwarmers' new third-base coach.  In the final game, Gus, Clark and Richie do not play; rather, they let a team of Nelson and other children play, to give them a chance to compete. The final is played against a team with a heartless coach, Jerry, who practically torments his players, is the leader of the group of bullies, and was Richie and Clark's main bully when they were children. In the final inning, the Benchwarmers are losing, but Jerry's team sees that the Benchwarmers are having fun playing the game anyway despite losing. Seeing how heartless and uncaring Jerry is and realizing the true spirit of the game, they decide to let Nelson hit the ball, and let him score a run, saying that Jerry is "the loser". The Benchwarmers storm the field, celebrating the fact that they were not shut out, and they give an enraged Jerry a taste of his own medicine, giving him a wedgie. Later, the Benchwarmers celebrate at [[Pizza Hut]] where Richie and Clark manage to get girlfriends, and Gus celebrates as he will become a father.

But when Young-woon's mother finds out about the affair and pushes him into marrying his fiancée, he is forced into choosing between the two women.  
Bernard and Doris
 In 1987, Doris Duke, considered the wealthiest woman in the world, hires Bernard Lafferty, who lists Elizabeth Taylor and Peggy Lee as former employers on his résumé, as her majordomo. He explains a six-month gap in his employment history was due to "health issues," a euphemism for time spent in rehab to deal with his addiction to alcohol. He assures Doris, who immediately suspects the truth, he is capable of performing his duties without any problems. As Bernard moves in, the viewer can quickly tell he is a little neurotic, first putting portraits of his former employers, Taylor and Lee, in his bedroom, then informing the rest of the staff he is now "Miss Duke's eyes and ears" and demanding they listen to him. Despite Bernard's growing affection for Doris, the brash and often crude Doris thinks little of him, not even remembering how to correctly pronounce his name. However, their situation slowly evolves into a more emotionally intimate but non-physical relationship as Doris returns from a plastic surgery center one evening, drunk and on painkillers, and is aided by Bernard who stays with her through the night.  Doris teaches Bernard about horticulture, especially the care of orchids, and he takes control of the operation of her various households during her frequent long absences. Bernard himself enjoys tending the home and making sure things are in their correct order. The first time his sexuality is questioned is when he peers at Doris's much younger lover playing the piano in his underwear. In the greenhouse, Doris flirts with him, telling him belly dancing is a form of seduction and then performing a dance for him. Bernard tentatively informs her that he "swings in the other direction." Doris encourages him to tone down his severe dress and wear brighter colors. Doris begins to take Bernard with her on her world tours and convinces him to pierce his ear. During this time, they grow closer, and Doris begins to favor him above everyone else. Also, whenever Doris is mentioned in newspapers, we see Bernard cutting them out of the newspapers and keeping them for himself.  Doris begins to spend more time with Bernard, and at one point attempts to seduce him.  When Bernard backs away, Doris questions him: "I don't get it. You don't fuck me, you don't steal from me. So what do you want from me?", to which Bernard answers, "I want to take care of you, Miss Duke."  As the two become closer, and Bernard becomes more relaxed, he begins to drink again, initially with discretion but eventually to an extent that it begins to hinder his performance. Rather than dismiss him, as she always has done with employees who displeased her in the past, Doris has him committed for more rehab at her expense despite his having consumed large amounts of her expensive, vintage wines. Doris suffers a stroke, and Bernard returns to take full control of her life. In order to humor her—and to indulge his own proclivities—Bernard wears her makeup, jewelry, and haute couture and begins to affect a more feminine demeanor. One evening, Doris tells Bernard what she wants him to do after she dies, and a  tearful Bernard promises he will perform her requests. Doris's smile fades and she tells him, "I must really be crazy to believe a fucker like you," suggesting that she still resents him for stealing from her.  Meanwhile, Bernard tries to keep Doris' attorney and financial advisor Waldo Taft, away from Doris, hanging up on him whenever he calls. Taft dislikes and distrusts Lafferty enough to have offered him $500,000 to leave his position in the past. Taft calls the police to Doris's estate, but Doris tells the police officer that Bernard is only "peacefully devoted above and beyond in the call of duty," prompting the officer to leave and blame Taft for being jealous. However, Taft encourages Doris to hire a live-in nurse. Although Doris's faith and trust in Bernard cannot be shaken, she agrees to hire a nurse, which Bernard is very unhappy about. Eventually, he convinces her to refrain from hiring a nurse, instead taking care of her himself and only occasionally inviting a doctor to give her checkups.  A while later, Bernard gives a very sick Doris her medicine and injection before putting her to bed, and she dies that night. Before her death, however, she appoints him executor of her massive estate. In his first meeting with her board of directors following Doris's cremation, a now obviously effete Bernard appears confident and in control, dressed in a style and acting in a manner that is peculiarly similar to Doris's at the beginning of the film. As he waters the orchids in her garden, viewers are told that there were accusations against him that he murdered Doris but that no evidence was found.  Viewers are then told that he died from complications related to his alcoholism three years later.

Bhagam Bhag
 Champak Chaturvedi ([[Paresh Rawal]]) the director of a theater group, is offered a chance to perform a show in London. Babla ([[Govinda]]) and Bunty ([[Akshay Kumar]]) are two derps and flirts in his group, always fighting with each other to get the role of the hero. Their behaviour causes the actress ([[Tanushree Dutta]]) to run away. This really upsets the organizer, who offered the chance mainly because of the heroine. After reaching London, Champak tells the duo that whoever gets a new actress will get to become hero. Then Babla asks Gulab Singh Lakhan Singh Haryanewale ([[Rajpal Yadav]]), a local driver where he can find a heroine. Gulab Singh misinterprets this as prostitute and directs him to a park.  Bunty, who has heard everything, follows them. In a misunderstanding, they meet two men from underworld and exchange their goods, only to find that the men have sold drugs to them since the underworld misinterpreted their need for heroine as  "heroin". Bunty convinces Babla into going to  the police to turn in the drugs to get good credit or an award, but the police get the wrong impression and think they are drug dealers. Commissioner JD Mehra ([[Jackie Shroff]]) releases them after telling them not to leave the country until they are proven innocent. Then while search of a heroine, Bunty and Gulab Singh take help of Guru ([[Shakti Kapoor]]), a local don who is a drunkard and they end up breaking his (Guru's) legs. Guru sends his goons to thrash Bunty and Gulab Singh but they escape. They bump into Munni ([[Lara Dutta]]), who is trying to commit suicide. Bunty saves her and brings her to the theatre group to be the heroine.  Later, Bunty falls in love with Munni, but then she has an accident. The doctor notes that she may have suicidal tendencies. When Munni wakes up, she claims to be Nisha Chauhan, wife of Vikram Chauhan ([[Arbaaz Khan (Indian actor)|Arbaaz Khan]]). They meet Vikram, who confirms her suicidal nature. A heartbroken Bunty accepts the fact and tries to forget her, only to learn some time later that Nisha has burnt herself to death.  Meanwhile, the underworld don ([[Sharat Saxena]]) who gave drugs  and his boss M.G. Gandhi ([[Manoj Joshi]]) think that Bunty, Babla and Champak are undercover cops and they want to kill them. However, Bunty suddenly spots Nisha in the city one day. Later, Champak and Babla too see her. On the day of the drama, the trio see Vikram flailing a gun at someone and are shocked to see him die in front of them.  All three are frightened and throw his body down a vent. During the performance, Vikram's body falls from the ceiling. Mehra questions everyone and arrests the trio for murder of Vikram. M.G. Gandhi wants the three dead because he thinks they're going to get him thrown in jail. Gandhi's men attack the police car transporting the trio, helping them to escape. The trio try to search priety based on the clues they have. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh is given task by Guru to search for the trio. M G Gandhi captures Champak. Bunty and Babla run into Nisha, well and alive, upon which they trap her at the clock tower of Brighton railway station.  It is revealed her real name is Aditi and she was hired by Vikram to play his wife Nisha and convince people she is crazy in return for money and a passport out of the UK. Vikram wanted to kill his real wife Nisha ([[Gurleen Chopra]]) to get her wealth. When Aditi found out about his ways, she tried to stop him and failed. She later tried to reach Bunty at the show to tell him about it, but Vikram caught her. Then Mehra arrived at the play and killed Vikram. Just then, Mehra arrives there and confirms that he is indeed Vikram's killer.  Mehra reveals that Nisha was his sister and he killed Vikram to avenge her murder. He also intends to kill Aditi as she helped Vikram to pass off Nisha's murder as suicide.The disaster is averted due to an accident.  Bunty tries to stop Mehra, saying that Aditi wanted to say something in her defense, but she remains tongue-tied due to fear. Guru and his men take Gulab Singh to the clock, leaving Hakka, Guru's right hand to take care of Ravinder Taneja, the sponsor. Hakka flees towards his master on spotting Gandhi and his men coming with Champak leaving Ravinder. Gandhi mistakes Ravinder as Sherkhan, a drug dealer from whom he used to buy drugs, ending up in annoying Ravinder. Meanwhile, Gulab Singh's employer (who had leased him a taxi) and Hakka, with his friends, enter the scene. Briefed wrongly due to misinterpreting by his men all those who were present as undercover cops, Gandhi fires his pistol towards the ceiling. All reach where Babla, Bunty, Mehra and Aditi stand. Gandhi, again due to incorrect briefing, fires at Mehra, but misses and the bullets pierce a beehive. The honeybees launch an attack, in standing against which everyone loses its head. Mehra flees the scene unhurt, and probably also calls the police.  Some climb on the top of the tower, while Bunty breaks the dial of the clock. All cling to the front of the clock while a firefighting crane arrives. The firefighter allows only two people, but everybody holds the crane, overloading and throwing it out of order. The victims are thrown off the crane seconds after they hold it. The first is an Arab(possibly Sherkhan in disguise); he runs head and feet first into a Time Magazine poster. A British drug dealer (who works for Gandhi) then crashes into a window of a nearby building. Bunty and Aditi then land on a hanging poster. Aditi is saved but Bunty falls down. Ravinder lands into the reservoir of a fountain, ingesting a marine animal on reaching underwater. Gulab Singh's employer, Hakka and Guru fall on a palm tree. Gandhi, his other man and Champak land on a live overhead electric line. Hakka drops down onto bouquets displayed under the tree. Guru, hanging on a rope or the line, transports in and disrupts the Pampered Pet Shop. Those on the line get thrown due to electric current. Gandhi lands in a firecracker store. His man falls into white paint. Gandhi emerges out tied to a rocket amidst deafening explosions. He, too, has a dive in the reservoir of a fountain. Champak slides down, ruining a set table. He is taken along by an oncoming Babla into a trashcan. The last to be thrown off the crane is Gulab Singh, who rests on the hands of a statue. The crane then falls apart. When in the hospital, Mehra returns the passports of Babla, Bunty and Champak. Then, he surrenders to his juniors.

The werewolf kills two of Derek's friend's and breaks into one of the locked rooms of the cabin where it rapes one of the girls in front of her boyfriend, before killing her. The werewolf then castrates the boyfriend and kills him too. Derek and Sam both manage to escape the werewolf and are found by police.  They tell  the police they didn't get a good look at what attacked them, knowing that they wouldn't believe them. The next day Mitch picks Derek up from the police station, and tells Derek that the deaths of his friends are on him for taking his friends to the cabin in the first place. Sam and Derek both suspect that Mitch is the werewolf. Later Charlie pays Derek a visit to see if he's alright.  Derek and Sam confide what they know to Charlie, who surprisingly believes them. Charlie explains that he shot at the werewolf that killed his brother and suspected it to be Mitch as Mitch had a crush on Derek's mother. Charlie also says they just can't accuse Mitch, and need DNA evidence to be compared to the hair sample he got from the werewolf. Meanwhile, Charlie reconnects with Derek's mother while Derek and Sam become romantically connected themselves. While searching for DNA evidence, Sam enters Mitch's room and picks hair from his comb. Mitch catches Sam in his room and forces her to perform oral sex on him, and Sam takes the semen sample as DNA. Derek finds out and it puts a strain on her and Derek's relationship.  Meanwhile, Mitch has been stalking Charlie, suspecting that he is sweet on his wife. Mitch picks up a package addressed to Charlie, and learns it's DNA results. Mitch later abducts Charlie, and reveals to him that he doesn't need the moon to change, that he learned to control himself to the extent that he can transform at will. Mitch beats, tortures, mutilates and finally kills Charlie, saying it's his own fault for not minding his business. Derek later finds the DNA report and learns that Mitch has killed Charlie, Derek confronts Mitch about it. Mitch tries to justify himself but Derek shoots down his arguments. Around the same time, Derek's mother decides to leave Mitch. In retaliation, Mitch kidnaps Sam and demands Derek to meet him in the cabin that night, alone.  Derek arrives, but another group of teenagers go to the cabin to investigate the previous massacre (a running gag in the film). Mitch transforms and kills them one at a time, including raping a girl in their group. When it's down to Derek and Sam, they fight Mitch with silver knives and arrows. Eventually, they set Mitch on fire and the cabin burns down. After escaping the fire, Derek and Sam embrace, but Mitch is not dead and bites Derek, before being stabbed one last time. As he dies, Mitch says "my curse is now yours". Derek worries about his future after all he went through, but Sam promises to stick by him whatever happens, and they drive off together on her moped.  After the credits end, Mitch is shown moving his fingers slightly.

Meanwhile, an incident occurs in [[Orange County, California]], where Malcolm's old friend, Doug Hudson ([[Kirk B.R. Woller]]), has been killed while he was going undercover.  FBI agent Kevin Keneally ([[Zachary Levi]]) is doing surveillance on a former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] military intelligence specialist named Tom Fuller ([[Mark Moses]]), who has since retired and is working for a private corporation called National Agenda Software. The FBI has soon discovered that Tom is developing a computer worm which will create backdoors into the databases of all the branches of the U.S. government. Affected by his friend's death, Malcolm asks FBI chief, Crawford ([[Dan Lauria]]), to put him on the case, but Crawford refuses and tells him to stay away for safety analysis.  By eavesdropping via the webcam, Malcolm finds out that the FBI is sending one of the agents to infiltrate Fuller's house as a nanny. Giving Sherry the pretext of attending a safety conference in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], Malcolm leaves for Orange County and takes the "Big Momma" costume with him.  Malcolm reprises his disguise as Big Momma from the original film and showing up at Fuller's house as Mrs. Fuller ([[Emily Procter]]) is interviewing several other candidates. Big Momma eliminates the three other applicants for the nanny position by pointing out the sexually attractive qualities of the first, the drug use of the second, and the FBI Agent's concealed firearm of the third.  Big Momma meets the three Fuller children: Molly ([[Kat Dennings]]), Carrie ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), and Andrew.

Big Nothing
  The film is set in a small [[Oregon]] town, where a brutal [[serial killer]] nicknamed the 'Oregon undertaker' has been murdering and mutilating young women.  Charlie ([[David Schwimmer]]) is an ex-teacher turned disaffected call center employee who is fired on his first day. Distraught at being unable to provide for his daughter Emily and policewoman wife Penelope ([[Natascha McElhone]]), he is approached by former colleague Gus ([[Simon Pegg]]), an aspiring scam artist who presents Charlie with a seemingly snag-free plan to make some cash: [[blackmail]] Reverend Smalls, who is listed in the company database of visitors to illegal porn websites. Gus plans on extorting money from Reverend Smalls, with the intention of publicly exposing his secret shame should he refuse to pay. The normally cautious Charlie reluctantly agrees to play a part in the scam, confident that with the money he will garner from the deal he would be able to support his family. A teenage pageant queen Josie McBroom ([[Alice Eve]]), Gus's scheming one-night stand, forces herself into the scheme. Josie convinces Charlie and Gus that she should make the call to Smalls on the grounds that if either of them called, the police could trace their voices and connect them to the job.  The plan goes into action, and Gus goes to Smalls' house where he is surprised by the Reverend wielding a gun. From outside the house two shots are heard. At the same time, Charlie arrives at the bar to explain his and Gus' alibi, only to find out that the blind owner of the gas station where Gus has supposedly gone is at the bar celebrating his 80th birthday. Charlie runs away and goes to Smalls' house, where he finds the Reverend dead. Scared, he drags the body outside, and dumps him into a nearby [[septic tank]]. He goes back inside the house, tries to call Josie. He then finds Gus and learns that the Reverend shot Gus in the leg, explaining the blood near the corpse. After the first shot, Gus hit the Reverend over the head with a vase, leaving him alive but unconscious. Gus and Charlie leave the house to escape the scene of the crime, but Charlie remembers that he left Josie's card inside. They go back and get it, but in the process Gus stumbles upon a hidden DVD collection of the Reverend. They put one in, and find a video of the Reverend killing and torturing a young girl. They try to flee the house, but are immediately met by a deputy police officer outside the door. The policeman explains that the Reverend was found dead, with three bullet holes in his head.  Charlie lets in the policeman, who notices some blood on the floor. Charlie, in the kitchen, grabs a knife and cuts himself, and then goes back to the policeman to explain that he cut himself on a vase. Right before leaving, the policeman decides to see what Charlie had been watching, much to Charlie's protests. He presses play, and watches the beginning of a children's movie Gus had secretly switched in. Satisfied, he leaves the house, but finds marks in the ground that look like someone had been dragged. Charlie follows the policeman to the end of the drag marks, the septic tank. As Charlie is about to open it, Gus smashes a vase against the head of the deputy, who is promptly dragged inside.  Inside, Charlie panics about the murder of the Reverend and the kidnapping of a policeman and leaves, where he is met by the Reverend's wife ([[Mimi Rogers]]) who has a gun pointed at Charlie. They go back inside, where she explains that she shot the Reverend and that she was going to meet her lover, Max, at the house so they could collect their $2,000,000 the real Reverend had left. Gus and Charlie explain that Max will not be seeing her, and she asks them where the money is, pointing a gun at the tied-up policeman. They frantically try to say that they don't know anything about the money, and right before she is about to shoot the deputy, Josie comes in and lodges an axe in the wife's head. As Charlie and Gus talk over what's been happening, Josie finds the money hidden in the Reverend's oven, and calls Charlie and Gus over. As they are looking at the stacks of hundred dollar bills, they hear cries of "help" from outside. The deputy has escaped through the front door, and, rolling himself along, is soon caught by the three. In his rolling, the deputy drops his badge, which Charlie picks up and puts in his pocket. They agree to dispose the body of the wife. The policeman, still alive, asks to use the toilet. Inside, he tries to escape through a window, but slips and kills himself by breaking his skull on the toilet.  Charlie, Gus, and Josie hide the bodies in suitcases and drive away to dispose them, but soon get into an argument. Charlie reveals that the reason why he has been reeling off random facts is because of a neurological disorder. This problem with the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] means that eventually his mind will become blank and explains why he was fired from his teaching position. After driving for a while Charlie realises that Gus, who had originally said he needed the money for his daughter's cornea operation, does not really have a daughter, and punches him. In this small fight, they nearly get into an accident with a fat man, who tries to call the police, but is persuaded by Gus to not do so. Charlie, Gus and Josie drive away and get to their disposal point, only to find that one of the bodies is missing. They drive back and hit the Reverend's wife, who had jumped out of the car and was trying to get help. As they look over the body, two police officers arrive, one of them being Charlie's wife, and quickly see the body. Charlie's wife tries to call her deputy, but it goes to voicemail. Josie hurriedly makes up a story, but the three are taken to the station where a special agent is waiting.  Agent Hymes ([[Jon Polito]]), the fat man the three almost got into an accident with, examines the body with Gus and Josie, seeming to understand the earlier events. However, it turns out not to be the case and he lets them go. In the waiting room, Charlie finds his sleeping daughter, who could not be left alone at the house and was brought by his wife, and gives her his coat. Charlie, Gus and Josie drive to a [[tar pit]], where they plan to dispose of the bodies, but they find that the special agent has been following them. He gets angry at Gus for calling him fat before, and Gus swipes and stabs him with an [[insulin]] needle in the foot. The agent throws the gun up, which is caught by Charlie, who then points the gun at the agent. The agent then reveals that Josie is the Wyoming Widow; a murderer who befriended men and killed them with whiskey laced with highly concentrated [[thallium]]. She disregards it as nonsense, but Charlie and Gus make her empty her pockets, where they find the tell-tale flask of poisoned whiskey. They make her drink some, and she pretends to die, but soon begins laughing at their foolishness as it is not poisoned. They check for the agent, but as he has disappeared they go looking for him. Gus goes back to the car and tries to hide the money, but is caught by the agent, who complains of his lack of payment for what he does. He shoots Gus twice, killing him, and gets the money. In the mean time, Charlie's wife finds the badge of her deputy in her husband's coat, but drives to a bridge and throws it off, removing the evidence.  The agent runs to his car, but is surprised by Josie, who was waiting in the back seat. They make him eat a large sugary [[lollipop]], dangerous because of his diabetes, and leave him for dead. Charlie remarks on what monsters they have become, and is then faced by Josie, who has a gun pointed at his head. She explains that she really is the Wyoming Widow, and then gives him the choice of the bullet or the poisoned whiskey (from her second flask). Charlie tells her not to spend all the money in one place, and drinks the whiskey, dying quickly, but not before he happily sees Josie discover that the bag is filled with nothing but his daughter's stuffed animals. At home, Charlie receives a message on his phone from a publishing firm regarding his book and his dream job and an office. Also, his daughter is seen drawing with marker on some of the hundred dollar bills next to several large stacks of money.  Josie tries to hitch a ride away from Oregon, and finally gets one from an old man. The old man goes to the back to "double-check on something", and Josie takes out the poisoned whiskey. The old man covers a bloody leg with a tarpaulin (where it is revealed he is the Oregon undertaker), and goes back into the truck to drive away with Josie.  
Big Bang Love, Juvenile A
 In an unknown future, Jun confesses to the murder of another boy, Shiro, at an all-boy juvenile detention facility. The story follows two detectives trying to uncover the case through interviews and intersperses testimonies by the inmates and the prison employees with events in the lives of Jun and Shiro.  Jun, who is incarcerated for the murder of his rapist, forms an intensely close bond with Shiro, who is in prison for a murder and the rape of a woman.  Shiro protects Jun with fanatical intensity and violence from the other boys, though his intentions toward Jun are not clear.  The highly symbolic visuals and dialogue contrast with the routine nature of the police investigation, creating a somewhat surreal commentary on the nature of violence and salvation throughout the film.

Black Book (film)
  In 1944, [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch-Jewish]] singer Rachel Stein is hiding from the Nazi regime in the [[German occupation of the Netherlands|occupied Netherlands]]. When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed in an Allied bombing, she goes to see a lawyer named Smaal, who has been helping her family. He organizes for her to escape to the liberated southern part of the country. Aided by a man named Van Gein, Rachel is reunited with her family and boards a boat that is to take them and other refugees to the south. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], who kill them and rob the bodies of valuables. Rachel alone survives, but does not manage to escape from occupied territory.  Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a [[Dutch resistance]] group in the [[The Hague|Hague]], under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans. Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local [[Sicherheitsdienst#Inland-SD|SD]] commander ''[[Hauptsturmführer]]'' Ludwig Müntze. At a party at the local SD headquarters, Ellis recognises ''[[Obersturmführer]]'' Günther Franken, Müntze's brutal deputy, as the SS officer who oversaw the massacre of her refugee party. She obtains a job as a secretary at the SD headquarters while also falling in love with Müntze, who in contrast to Franken, is not abusive or sadistic. He realises that she is a Jew, but does not care.  Thanks to a [[Covert listening device|hidden microphone]] that Ellis plants in Franken's office, the Resistance realises that Van Gein was the traitor who betrayed Rachel, her family, and the other Jews to the SS. Against Kuipers' orders, Akkermans and others decide to abduct Van Gein to expose him. The plot goes wrong, and Van Gein is killed during the abduction. Franken responds by planning to kill 40 hostages, including most of the plotters, but Müntze, who realises the war is lost and has been negotiating with the Resistance, cancels the order.  Müntze forces Ellis to tell him her story. On her evidence, he confronts Franken with a superior officer, ''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' Käutner, who orders Franken to open his safe, in a search for the valuables stolen from the Jews he had killed. (Murdering Jews was not against SS regulations, but personally stealing their wealth was a capital offense.) However, the safe reveals nothing, and Franken tells Käutner that Müntze has been negotiating with Dutch resistance "terrorists" for a truce. Müntze is imprisoned and condemned to death. The Resistance plots to rescue their imprisoned members; Ellis agrees to cooperate only on the condition that they also free Müntze. The plan is betrayed by an unknown insider, and the would-be rescuers find the prisoners' cells to be filled with German troops. Only Akkermans and one other man manage to flee.  Ellis is subsequently arrested and taken to Franken's office. He has known about her and the bug for some time. Knowing that the Resistance is listening in, he stages a confrontation to make them believe that Ellis is the [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborator]], responsible for the failure of the rescue operation. Kuipers and his companions swear to hunt her down and make her pay for her treason. Ronnie, a Dutch woman working at the SD headquarters to whom Ellis had confided her role in the Resistance, helps her and Müntze escape.  When the country is liberated by the Allies, Franken attempts to escape by boat, but is killed by Akkermans, who takes the Jewish loot. Suspecting Smaal is the traitor, Müntze and Ellis return to confront him. Smaal states that the traitor has been revealed by the titular black book in which he had detailed all his dealings with Jews. However, he refuses to discuss further, wanting to go to the Canadian authorities instead. When they are about to leave, Smaal and his wife are killed by an unknown assailant. Müntze chases him into the street, only to be recognized by the triumphant Dutch and arrested by soldiers from the [[Canadian Army]]. The Dutch also recognize Ellis and arrest her as a "[[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborator]]", but not before she grabs the black book.  Müntze is brought before the ranking Canadian officers and finds that Käutner is helping in keeping order among the defeated German forces. Käutner convinces a Canadian colonel that under [[German military law|military law]], the defeated German military retains the right to punish its own soldiers. Due to his previously issued death warrant, Müntze is immediately executed by a firing squad.  Ellis is imprisoned with other accused collaborators, and humiliated and tortured by the violently anti-Nazi volunteer jailers, but is rescued by Akkermans, now a colonel in the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Dutch Army]]. Akkermans brings her to his medical office, and tells her that he killed Franken when the Nazi tried to escape. He shows her the valuables stolen from Franken's Jewish victims. When informed about Müntze's fate, Ellis goes into shock, and Akkermans administers a tranquilizer which is in fact an [[Drug overdose|overdose]] of [[insulin]]. Ellis, feeling dizzy, sees the bottle of insulin and survives by quickly eating a bar of chocolate. She realizes then that Akkermans was the traitor who had collaborated with Franken and had killed the Smaals. While Akkermans is distracted, waving to a crowd that cheers him, she jumps from his balcony into the crowd below and runs away. He tries to follow her, but is blocked by the crowd.  Ellis proves her innocence to Canadian military intelligence and to the former Resistance leader Gerben Kuipers by means of Smaal's black book, which lists how many Jews had been taken to Akkermans for medical help just prior to their murders. Together, Ellis and Kuipers intercept the fleeing Akkermans, who is hiding in a coffin in a hearse with the stolen money, gold, and jewels. They quickly kill the driver, and while Kuipers drives the hearse, Ellis screws down the coffin's secret air vents. They drive to [[Hollands Diep]] where the SS trap had been sprung, and wait until Akkermans suffocates. Ellis and Kuipers are left wondering what to do with the stolen money and jewels.  The scene changes to [[Israel]] in 1956, and shows Rachel meeting her husband and their two children, and walking back into [[Kibbutz]] Stein, which a sign at the gate announces was funded with the recovered money stolen from Jews killed during the war. In the final scene, the tranquility of Rachel and her family is interrupted by explosions heard in the distance; the siren announces an air attack and the Israeli soldiers position themselves at the front of the kibbutz. It is October 1956 and the [[Suez Crisis|Suez crisis]] has begun.

To prevent Billy from talking, she imprisons him in the attic.  Years later, Constance attempts to conceive another child, but realizes that her boyfriend is [[impotence|impotent]].  She goes to the attic and rapes twelve-year-old Billy. Nine months later, Constance gives birth to their daughter, Agnes.

At the house, Clair Crosby, one of the sorority girls, is murdered in her bedroom by an unknown figure.  Meanwhile, Megan Helms begins to hear noises and goes up to the attic to investigate. Upon finding Clair's body in a rocking chair, Megan is attacked and killed by the same assailant.  In the living room, the other sorority sisters, Kelli Presley, Melissa Kitt, Heather Fitzgerald, Dana Mathis and Lauren Hannon, along with their housemother Mrs. Mac, receive a threatening call from a stranger.  Clair's half-sister Leigh Colvin soon arrives, searching for her.  The withdrawn Eve Agnew presents Heather with a glass unicorn before leaving the sorority house to go home for the holidays. Meanwhile, Kelli's boyfriend, Kyle Autry, arrives but is kicked out when Kelli discovers a video of he and Megan having sex.  When the lights suddenly go out, Dana goes to check the power under the house, but encounters the figure in the crawlspace and is dragged underneath and killed with a [[garden fork]].

While Kelli and Leigh descend to the garage to investigate, Melissa is attacked and killed by an assailant with a pair of ice skates.  Kelli and Leigh return upstairs and find Lauren's eyeless corpse in bed.  Kyle returns to the house, and the three go to investigate the attic; while ascending the ladder, Kyle is dragged into the attic and stabbed to death.  The killer is revealed to be Agnes, now an adult; Kelli and Leigh watch in horror as Billy appears in the attic as well.  Agnes, along with Billy, attacks Kelli, knocking three of them into the empty space between the walls of the house.  Kelli and Leigh manage to escape before starting a fire, and leave Billy and Agnes to burn to death.  Later, Kelli and Leigh recover at the hospital.  Billy, who is partially burned, kills the morgue assistant. While Kelli goes for an x-ray, Agnes (also survived from being burned to death) appears in her hospital room and kills Leigh.

Bucky learns that Elizabeth was an aspiring actress who appeared in a [[pornographic film]].  Through his investigation, Bucky learns that Elizabeth liked to hang out with lesbians.  He goes to a lesbian nightclub and meets Madeleine Linscott, who looks very much like Elizabeth.  Madeleine, who comes from a prominent family, tells Bucky that she was 'very close' with Elizabeth but asks him to keep her name out of the papers. In exchange for his silence, she promises him sexual favors.  Continuing his relationship with Madeleine, Bucky meets her wealthy parents, Emmett and Ramona.  Bucky's partner, Lee, also becomes obsessed with Elizabeth's murder.  Lee's obsession leads him to become erratic and abusive towards his long-time girlfriend Kay Lake, who is also one of Bucky's close friends.  After Lee and Bucky have a nasty argument about a previous case, Bucky goes to Lee and Kay's to apologize, only to learn from Kay that Lee was responding to a tip about a recently released convict, Bobby DeWitt.  Bucky goes to the location and gets into an altercation with DeWitt in the atrium of the building.    DeWitt is gunned down by Lee, standing on the stairs across the atrium.  Bucky sees a man sneak up behind Lee, and wrap a rope around Lee's neck.  Lee fights back while Bucky, paralyzed with shock, watches from across the atrium as a second shadowy figure steps out and slits Lee's throat.  Lee and the man holding the rope fall over the railing to their deaths several floors below.  It is then that Bucky is helped by Millard and Morrie Friedman, a friend of Lee's whom Bucky saw with Lee at the New Year's party in 1946.  Dealing with the grief of losing Lee propels Bucky and Kay into a sexual encounter.  The next morning, Bucky finds money from a bank robbery hidden in Lee and Kay's bathroom.  Kay reveals that she had been DeWitt's girlfriend, that DeWitt had mistreated her, and that DeWitt had done the bank robbery; stealing a large sum of money from one of [[Benjamin Siegel|"Bugsy" Siegel]]'s nightclubs.  Lee had rescued Kay and stolen DeWitt's bank robbery money.    Lee needed to kill DeWitt now that he was out of prison; leading to the encounter that resulted in Lee's death.  Bucky leaves, furious with Lee and Kay for their actions and lies.  He returns to Madeleine's family mansion and continues his intense relationship with her.  Kay is furious when she discovers the relationship, especially with the fact that Madeleine bears a striking resemblance to the same girl Lee obsessed over before he was killed, and leaves the scene.  Watching an old movie one night, Bucky notices that a bedroom scene matches the set in Elizabeth's pornographic film.  The credits at the end of the film includes the statement "Special Thanks to Emmett Linscott", Madeleine's father.  Bucky's search for answers leads him to an incomplete housing project that Madeleine's father had started just below the [[Hollywood sign|Hollywoodland sign]].  In one of the empty houses, Bucky recognizes the set that was used to film Elizabeth's pornographic movie.  In a barn on the property, Bucky finds where Elizabeth was killed and her body butchered, as well as a drawing of a man with a [[Glasgow smile]]. The drawing resembles a painting in Madeleine's family home and matches the disfiguring smile carved into Elizabeth's face during her murder.  Bucky confronts Madeleine and her father in their home, accusing them of murdering Elizabeth. Madeleine's mother, Ramona, reveals that she killed Elizabeth, who looked so much like Madeleine.  She confesses that Madeleine was not fathered by Emmett but rather by his best friend, George.  She also reveals that George had been on set when Elizabeth's pornographic film was made, becoming infatuated with her.  She felt that Elizabeth looked too much like Madeleine, and was bothered that George was going to have sex with someone who looked like his own daughter, and decided to kill Elizabeth first.  Upon finishing her confession, Ramona kills herself.  A few days later, remembering something Lee had said during the investigation, Bucky visits Madeleine's sister Martha with some questions.  He learns that Lee knew about the lesbian relationship between Madeleine and Elizabeth, and was blackmailing Madeleine's father to keep it secret. Bucky finds Madeleine at a seedy motel, and she admits to being the one who slit Lee's throat. Although she insists that Bucky wants to have sex with her rather than kill her, he tells her she is wrong and shoots her dead.  Bucky goes to Kay's house and she invites him in and closes the door.  
Bleach: Memories of Nobody
 [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] and [[Rukia Kuchiki]] are Soul Reapers, soldiers trusted with ushering the souls of the dead from the World of the Living to the afterlife realm known as Soul Society and with fighting Hollows, monstrous lost souls who can harm both ghosts and humans. After defeating a Hollow in a local park, unidentified ghost-like spirits begin to appear, before a mysterious Soul Reaper named Senna appears and destroys the spirits. Ichigo and Rukia confront her, but she refuses to answer any questions and leaves. Ichigo follows Senna, while Rukia returns to the Soul Society in search of answers.  While pursuing Senna, Ichigo meets Soul Society's envoys who are on Earth to investigate the mysterious reflections of the human world that appears in the Soul Society. They discover that the spirits seen earlier are "Blanks", a group of amnesiac souls that were lost in the space between the Soul Society and the real world, and whose memories combine to form a single entity, the "Shinenju". In this in-between space, the spirits form the "Valley of Screams"; although it is a natural phenomenon, its colliding with the two worlds, which is not natural. So they deduce someone is doing it to obtain the Shinenju, and the Soul Reapers assembled separate to find it. Later, Senna is attacked by the mysterious group and Ichigo fends them off, without their motives.  After Ichigo and Senna reunite two lost souls, several Soul Society's officers and some armed forces declares that Senna is the real Shinenju and orders Ichigo to hand her over, but Ichigo refuses, valuing her as a being. The mysterious group calling themselves the "Dark Ones", exiles from the Soul Society seeking revenge for the past, arrives and captures Senna, while fighting off the Soul Reapers. The Dark Ones take Senna to the Valley of Screams and attach her to a device powered by the Blanks that can cause the Valley to collapse, resulting in a collision between the real world and the Soul Society that would destroy both.  Rukia goes to get reinforcements from the Soul Society, but their head-captain wants to destroy the Valley before it collapses and refuses to order a rescue mission with only an hour left. At the Valley, Ichigo fails to defeat the large number of Blanks and the Dark Ones, but he is saved by the arrival of his Soul Reaper counterparts. In the meantime, the head-captain is convinced to prolong the destruction of the Valley so that the Soul Reaper force in there may complete the mission and escape the Valley beforehand. The Soul Reapers quickly defeat the Dark Ones and Blanks, while Ichigo defeats their leader, Ganryu. The Soul Reaper force then quickly leave the portal of the Valley and return to the real world, content in finishing the mission.  However, the process of the collapse continues, before Senna sacrifices herself to push the two worlds back apart. Afterwards, when both worlds have been saved, Senna, weakened by her efforts asks Ichigo to take her to the graveyard so she can see her name on her gravestone, which had it one of a Blank whose memory Senna had; Ichigo lies and tells her that her name is on it. Believing him, she expresses contentment that she once had her own life before fading away. Rukia notes that once the power of the Blanks fades away, so will all memories of Senna. After the credits, Ichigo walking on the bridge, sees a red ribbon that he bought for Senna, floating down from the sky and sees a girl who resembles her running past him. He happily keeps their memory to himself.

The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling [[phobia]] of sheep.  Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret [[Genetic engineering|genetic experiments]] that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty demonic half-sheep monstrosity. While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of [[Environmentalism|environmental activists]] named Grant ([[Oliver Driver]]) and Experience (Danielle Mason) accidentally release a [[mutant]] lamb. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep.  Meanwhile, Henry and an old friend, Tucker ([[Tammy Davis]]), decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it. Inside they find the mutilated body of a farmer. Henry sees a sheep in the hallway and, because of his phobia, he quietly shuts the door and locks it. The sheep tries to crash through the door.

Back in the car, Tucker, Experience, and Henry leave to warn Angus about the killer sheep, but a sheep hiding in the car bites Tucker. After the car is destroyed, they seek refuge in the laboratory. Henry and Tucker finally realize that Angus is conducting cruel experiments. When one of the scientists see that Tucker's foot has now become a sheep's foot, she keeps him there for study but Experience and Henry escape when Angus cannot bring himself to shoot his own brother.  Suddenly, hordes of sheep come running down the hill. They see an [[offal]] pit surrounded by a gate. Henry accidentally slips into the pit, and his brother refuses to help.

But when she goes to give the shot to Angus, she gets eaten by the sheep.  Angus gives a presentation to businessmen about his new genetically engineered sheep. The businessmen are soon slaughtered by the infected sheep. When Henry and Experience try to warn Angus, they discover he has a [[Zoophilia|love for sheep]]. Disgusted, they leave. Henry realizes he has been infected so, like Angus, sheep no longer attack him. Henry and Experience go their separate ways. Henry ends up fighting with his brother, who has now transformed into a gargantuan sheep monster: however, only as intelligent as a sheep, Angus is kept in check by Henry and the farm's [[herding dog|sheepdog]]. While he is cornered by the dog, the revolving propeller of the family plane cuts into Angus and wounds him badly.  Tucker suddenly arrives and disinfects Angus and Henry with more amniotic fluid, administered via a medicine nozzle designed for sheep. Experience arrives. Even though Angus is now a human, he goes back to the sheep and tells them to bite him again. The sheep, driven mad by the smell of blood, devour Angus. Eventually, all the sheep are contained and killed in a giant bonfire of ignited sheep flatulence. The cure is given to the surviving were-sheep people, including Grant. However, the sheepdog now makes sheep noises.  
Blind Dating
 Danny Valddesechi ([[Chris Pine]]) is an intelligent, handsome, charming boy who happens to be blind. Having been blind from birth, he volunteers for a risky experimental [[visual prosthesis]] that may restore his sight—having a microchip installed in the visual cortex of his brain that connects to a camera that would give him only, at best, fuzzy black and white images. During the tests he meets a beautiful Indian nurse, Leeza ([[Anjali Jay]]). Meanwhile, because Danny is a virgin at 22, his brother Larry ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]), who runs a limousine service, gets him a string of hilariously disastrous blind dates in between rentals.

Danny's family, his eccentric psychotherapist Dr. Evans ([[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]]) and eye doctor Dr. Perkins ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]) advise him to continue because it is his only chance of seeing, and soon Danny is successfully operated on. He sees his family's faces for the first time, but not Leeza's, who was away, reluctantly preparing for her engagement party. Soon the experiment proves to be a failure, as the fragile prosthesis in his brain moves, clouding his already weak vision, and Danny goes back to being blind. Realizing that he really loves Leeza, he bursts into the engagement party, professing his love for her and saying "Love is how you speak to me. Love is how you touch me...and guide me showing me the way to go. And when we kiss, when we kiss, it moves me to my soul." The couple kiss.

After waking up, one of the thugs beats the injured boy so badly that all believe him dead.   Meanwhile, Yeong-seon finds a police officer that fined him earlier that day and tells him about the thugs and the boy. The policeman happens to be the boy's older brother Moon-jae. When they arrive to the riverbank, they don't find anybody because the thugs locked the boy in the car's trunk and left to drive the car into the river at a different place. The boy eventually regains consciousness and shoots several times from a revolver he'd been hiding all the time. The car crashes and the policeman is able to find them. He recognizes the thug leader to be his former schoolmate Bong-yeon that he used to bully and physically abuse. The kidnapping and torture of his brother was meant to be a revenge for this abuse. The policeman proceeds with mocking and beating Bong-yeon in a manner that resembles his behavior at school. After beating him up, he leaves taking a small tin box from one of the thugs. The box originally contained cough powder but one of the thugs replaced it with a poison he used for catching birds. Believing it to be cocaine, the policeman samples the poison and dies shortly after becoming the only victim of the whole episode.

Bobby (2006 film)
 The film recreates the ambiance of the era and invokes the hopes inspired by Kennedy through the use of actual broadcast and newsfilm footage of the [[United States Senate|senator]] intercut with dramatic sequences involving mostly fictional characters.

Bommarillu
 The film begins with a baby taking his first steps on a beach supported by his father. The narrator ([[Murali Mohan]]) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala ([[Siddharth (actor)|Siddharth]]) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind ([[Prakash Raj]]), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.  Satti ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]), Addala household's dutiful servant wakes up Siddhu in the morning. In the background, Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi ([[Jayasudha]]), is seen singing a devotional Telugu song while cooking. At the dining table, Aravind, Managing Director of their construction company, asks if Siddhu will join their office. When Siddhu deliberates, his father becomes impatient and plans for his marriage despite Siddhu's silent protest. The next week, Siddhu returns home to realize that he is going to get engaged to Subbulakshmi ([[Neha Bamb|Neha]]) against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a ''daddy's girl'' ([[Tanikella Bharani]] being the father) and does not take a liking to her. However, with Aravind's final say, they eventually get engaged.  While contemplating on his options in a temple, Siddhu accidentally meets Hasini ([[Genelia D'Souza]]), an engineering student. Siddhu is attracted by her cheerful nature and energy, and the couple begin to meet on a regular basis. As the days go by, Siddhu grows to admire the ever-friendly Hasini as someone who does what she loves, and he discovers many small things which make him happy to be in her company; he realizes that he has fallen in love with her.  Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a bank loan to start his construction company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) that she is going on a college tour.  When Hasini is introduced to Siddhu's family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, the other family members begin to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Aravind's household is difficult, Hasini stays for Siddhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Aravind reprimands Siddhu when he finds out about his bank loan and his career plans, only to further enrage Siddhu.  One day, the entire family along with Hasini attends a marriage ceremony. A cheerful Hasini cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao who happens to be around, recognizes Siddhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Hasini realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their face, Siddhu admonishes Hasini for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Hasini moves out of the house saying that she does not find Siddhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Siddhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Aravind on Siddhu's choices and wants. In the process, Siddhu opens up his heart, leaving Aravind to repent on his over-protectiveness. Siddhu requests Subbulakshmi and her parents to call off the marriage. While they relent, Aravind manages to convince Kanaka Rao about Siddhu and Hasini's love. When Kanaka Rao disagrees to get the two lovers married, Aravid suggests letting Siddhu stay with them for a week and the story returns to the pre-credits scene. The viewers are left to assume that the two lovers have a happy union.  
Bon Cop, Bad Cop
  When a body is found hanging on top of the sign demarcating the [[Ontario]]-[[Quebec]] border, police officers from both Canadian provinces must join forces to solve the murder. David Bouchard ([[Patrick Huard]]) is a rule-bending, [[francophone]] detective for the [[Sûreté du Québec]], while Martin Ward ([[Colm Feore]]) is a by-the-book [[English Canadian|anglophone]] [[Ontario Provincial Police]] detective. The bilingual detectives must resolve their professional and cultural differences as well as their bigotry and prejudices.  The body is identified as Benoit Brisset, a hockey executive. The clues lead the pair to Luc Therrien ([[Sylvain Marcel]]) at a roadside bar. After a fight in the bar, they imprison him in the trunk of Bouchard's car. Bouchard has promised to watch his daughter's [[ballet]] recital, so he drives to the recital and parks the car in front with Therrien still locked in the trunk. When they emerge, they find the car being towed from the no-parking zone, and as they try to chase down the truck driver, the car explodes.  With their prime witness dead, they decide to search Therrien's house where they find a large [[marijuana]] grow-op in the basement. They also discover another body, a former hockey team owner. A laser tripwire is activated by Bouchard, which sets the house on fire, destroying the house and causing the two cops to get high on the fumes of the burning marijuana. When they are disciplined by Bouchard's police chief shortly afterwards, he angrily removes them from the case after they start laughing hysterically because they're still high.  The next victim is discovered in Toronto. They realize that the killer has a pattern of tattooing his victims, with each tattoo providing a clue to the next murder victim. Each murder is in some way connected to major league [[ice hockey|hockey]]. (The film uses thinly disguised [[parody|parodies]] of [[National Hockey League]] teams, owners and players, however, rather than the real league). The pair anticipate the next victim, but he goes missing before they reach him. Ward and Bouchard appear on a hockey broadcast to warn people in the hockey community to be vigilant. The "Tattoo Killer" calls in to the show and threatens the two police officers, causing a brawl between them and the anchor (played by [[Rick Mercer]]) when they attempt to hang up.  Ward is attacked in his home by a masked assailant whom he discovers is Therrien. Meanwhile, Bouchard has sex with Ward's sister.  The "Tattoo Killer" kidnaps Bouchard's daughter, leading to the final confrontation with the two policemen. It is ultimately revealed that the murders are being committed by a bilingual portly hockey fan (Luc Therrien), as previously mentioned, under the direction and unequal partnership of a sadistic, psychopathic, sociopathic, fan of the notion of the game of hockey as a Canadian nationalistic symbol that he feels is being permanently corrupted by attempts to move ownership of Canadian teams to venture capitalist groups in the United States.  He is therefore having Therrien commit the murders along with him (with the tattoos as a signature), as revenge against the hockey league for desecrating the game by moving Canadian teams such as the "Quebec Fleur de Lys" to the United States.  They try to reason with him that hockey is just a game, but this only angers him.  Ward distracts the man while Bouchard unties his daughter.  After a fight, the killer is blown up by one of his own explosives.  During the credits, a news report is shown, revealing that the hockey teams will not be moved.  
Bondage (2006 film)
 ''Bondage'' is the story of a youth from [[Orange County, California]], who escapes an [[child abuse|abusive]] home environment but ends up in juvenile detention and a psychiatric center.  
Bonesaw (film)
  A woman returns home from grocery shopping, and has her throat slit by a masked serial killer known as "Bonesaw". Elsewhere, a man named Lee wakes up in Bonesaw's warehouse, and is informed via [[closed-circuit television]]s and the building's sound system that he must win his freedom by surviving a series of intellectual and physical challenges; an [[ankle monitor]] that is capable of delivering electric shocks is used to ensure Lee's compliance.  Lee's first test involves two fellow captives, [[Knights and Knaves|one of whom can only lie, while the other can only tell the truth]]. The two men are forced to have sex in front of Lee, who uses his one allotted question to correctly discern the identities of the duo. While Lee moves on to the next challenge, Bonesaw shoots one of the men and knocks the other out while declaring, "I still need you."  Pat Roberts, a self-proclaimed psychic, calls the Wannell County Police Station to report his precognitive flashes of Bonesaw’s murders, but his visions are dismissed by the skeptical Detective Brown.  Bonesaw's next game involves a caged man who will be released if Lee can solve at least two out of three [[brain teaser]]s. Lee correctly answers only  a single question, but is given a second chance to free the hostage, one that involves bringing the man to orgasm in less than fifteen minutes. Lee is unable to make the man ejaculate in time, and is forced to leave him behind as the room fills with toxic gas.  Pat Roberts meets with Detective Brown in person, and attempts to convince him to investigate an address that he claims is Bonesaw's hideout. Brown instead kicks Roberts out, and has sex with another detective named Larson. Afterward, Larson suggests that Brown look into the address that Roberts provided, explaining that Roberts's "gift" once helped the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] close a homicide case.  For his final challenge, Lee must make two men, both of whom are handcuffed to a pole, orgasm in less than twenty minutes, and do it without stepping outside of a circle that has been drawn on the floor. Lee wins the game, and is allowed to leave by Bonesaw, who kills the other two men with a handgun and a [[circular saw]] while deadpanning, "I said you'd go scot-free, not them".  Brown and Larson reach the warehouse and shoot Bonesaw, unmasking the figure afterward to reveal that it was actually the surviving hostage from Lee's initial challenge, disoriented, gagged, and framed by the real Bonesaw. As Brown laments that he should have listened to Patrick Roberts earlier, a puzzled Larson mentions that Roberts is not a man, but a woman (the one murdered in the intro) whose full given name is Patricia.  A series of flashbacks reveal that both Bonesaw and the impostor Pat Roberts are really James, an ex-boyfriend of Lee's. James locates, comforts, and takes the oblivious Lee to safety, which spurs Lee into asking that they get back together, a request that a smirking James obliges.  
Bordertown (2006 film)
 The opening titles explain that American corporations are using the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] by opening large ''[[maquiladora]]s'' right across the [[United States–Mexico border]]. The maquiladoras hire mostly Mexican women to work long hours for little money in order to produce mass quantity products.  Lauren Adrian ([[Jennifer Lopez]]), an impassioned American news reporter for the "''Chicago Sentinel''" wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. Instead, her editor George Morgan ([[Martin Sheen]]) assigns her to investigate a series of slayings involving young ''maquiladora'' factory women in a Mexican bordertown.  Worker Eva (Maya Zapata), originally from the southern Mexican state of [[Oaxaca]], takes a bus to go back to her shanty-town home after work. After a while she is the last passenger still in the bus. The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes.  Adrian heads to [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], on the U.S.–Mexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent. In Juárez, Adrian meets up with Diaz ([[Antonio Banderas]]), whom she had been working with six years before, and who is now the editor for the local newspaper "''El Sol de Juárez''". She also meets Eva.  The three try to find the two killers and have them prosecuted. For this purpose she starts working in the factory, in order to act as bait on the bus ride. The driver tries to assault her in the same way he did Eva, and although police assistance has been arranged, they are at the wrong place. She manages to escape her attacker. Later Diaz gets shot and killed in a drive-by shooting. Eva changes her mind and does not want to testify any more for fear of revenge, and tries to flee to the U.S., together with others in the trunk of a car. She gets caught and is sent back. Adrian convinces her to testify after all. For political reasons the ''Chicago Sentinel'' refuses to publish Adrian's story. Adrian quits and becomes the editor for ''El Sol de Juárez.''  
Borat
 At the behest of the Kazakh Ministry of Information, reporter Borat Sagdiyev leaves [[Kazakhstan]] for the [[United States]], which he called "Greatest Country in the World", the "U, S and A", to make a documentary.  He leaves behind his wife Oksana and other inhabitants of his village including his [[prostitute]] and [[incest|implied lover]] sister Natalia and his annoying neighbour Nursultan Tulyakby.  His companions are his producer [[Azamat Bagatov]] and a pet hen.  In New York, Borat sees an episode of ''[[Baywatch]]'' on TV and immediately falls in love with [[Pamela Anderson]]'s character, [[C. J. Parker]].  While interviewing and mocking a panel of [[feminist]]s, he learns of the actress's name and her residence in [[California]].  Borat is then informed by telegram that Oksana has been killed by a bear. Delighted, he resolves to travel to California and make Pam Anderson his new wife.  Azamat is afraid of flying because of the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], which he believes were [[9/11 conspiracy theories#Israel|the work of Jews]].  Borat takes driving lessons and buys a dilapidated ice-cream truck for the journey.  During the trip, Borat acquires a ''Baywatch'' booklet and continues gathering footage for his documentary.  He meets [[gay pride parade]] participants, politicians [[Alan Keyes]] and [[Bob Barr]], and [[African American]] youths. When Borat tells Keyes about the friends he made at gay pride, Keyes reveals that they are [[homosexuality|homosexual]], shocking Borat and filling him with regret. Borat is also interviewed at a live local television station and proceeds to disrupt the weather report.  Visiting a rodeo, Borat excites the crowd with [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] remarks, but then sings a fictional [[Meniñ Qazaqstanım|Kazakhstani national anthem]] to the tune of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]", receiving a strong negative reaction.    Staying at a [[bed-and-breakfast]], Borat and Azamat are stunned to learn that their hosts are Jewish. Fearful at the hands of their hosts, they two escape after throwing money at two [[woodlouse|woodlice]], believing that they are their Jewish hosts transformed. After their escape Borat insists they press on to California despite Azamat's objections as he wants to return to New York as he believes there are no Jews there. To appease Azamat, Borat attempts to buy a handgun to defend himself, but is turned away because he is not an American citizen, so he buys a bear instead.  A etiquette coach suggests Borat attend a private dinner at an eating club in the [[Southern United States|South]].  During the dinner, he unintentionally offends the other guests by showing them naked photos of him and his son and mistaking someone as retarded. When he lets Luenell, an African-American prostitute, into the house and shows her to the table, they both are kicked out. Borat befriends Luenell, and she invites him into a relationship with her, but he tells her that he is in love with someone else.  Borat then visits an antique shop where he clumsily breaks various [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] heritage items, almost bankrupting the documentary.  At a hotel, Borat, just out of the bath, sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson. A furious Borat accidentally reveals that she is the reason why they're travelling across the entire country instead of staying in New York.  Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a nude brawl with huge material damage to their room which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and then into a packed convention ballroom.  Azamat abandons Borat, taking his passport, all of their money, and their bear (whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator).  Borat's truck runs out of gas, and he begins to hitchhike to California.  He is soon picked up by drunken [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] brothers from the [[University of South Carolina]].  On learning the reason for his trip, they show him the ''Pam and Tommy'' [[sex tape]] which reveals that she is not a virgin, as he had previously suspected.  Despondent, Borat burns the ''Baywatch'' booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan.  Borat attends a [[United Pentecostal Church|United Pentecostal]] camp meeting, at which [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Chip Pickering]] and [[Supreme Court of Mississippi|Mississippi Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[James W. Smith, Jr.]] are present.  He regains his faith, and forgives Azamat and Pamela. He accompanies church members on a bus to Los Angeles and disembarks to find Azamat dressed as [[Oliver Hardy]] (though Borat thinks that he is dressed as [[Adolf Hitler]]).  The two reconcile in Azamat's hotel where he tells Borat where to find Pamela Anderson. Borat finally comes face-to-face with Anderson at a book signing at a [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin Megastore]].  After showing Anderson his "traditional marriage sack", Borat pursues her throughout the store in an attempt to [[Bride kidnapping|abduct her]] until security guards intervene.   Borat visits Luenell and they return to Kazakhstan together, bringing back American customs and technology. This includes the apparent conversion of the people to Christianity (the Kazakh version of which includes [[crucifixion]] and torturing of Jews) and the introduction of computer-based technology, such as [[iPod]]s, laptop computers and a high-definition [[LCD]] television.  Over the credits, the fictional Kazakhstan national anthem which Borat sang at the rodeo is played accompanied by images of Soviet-style industry.

BoyTown
 BoyTown, the greatest [[boyband]] of the eighties and the group that started the boyband phenomenon, leave their terrible lives and low-paying jobs for one last attempt at the big time. They return to the stage with slightly older fans and slightly larger pants to complete some unfinished business. These days they spend less time singing about tears, eternity, angels and their 'baby' and more time singing about divorce, shopping, and picking up the kids from school.  As their triumphant tour draws to a conclusion all the personal issues that have been safely buried away for twenty years come bubbling to the surface with explosive consequences. Suddenly the band has to deal with allegations of infidelity, paternity tests, a miming fiasco, a band member "outing" himself live on stage, an awards night disaster, solo albums, a mysterious disappearance, and a plane journey that will cement the BoyTown legend forever.  ===''BoyTown Confidential''=== The official ''BoyTown'' website features clips from a [[mockumentary]] ''BoyTown Confidential'', hosted by [[Tony Martin (comedian)|Tony Martin]] as "Kenny Larkin", his character from the movie.  The mockumentary was supposed to be included in its entirety on the [[DVD]] release of ''BoyTown'', but was not included. Mick Molloy's Molloy Boy Productions has commented that it was left out due to lack of post-production funding, however Tony Martin said that he would have paid the estimated $5000 post-production cost as he believed it was one of his finest works. Speculation persists that Molloy thought the mockumentary would upstage the film itself. This has led to an ongoing rift between longtime collaborators Martin and Molloy.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22051878-5012964,00.html Martin Molloy rift far from funny]</ref>

Discovering Bathorly's plan, Van Helsing and King begin to hunt down and destroy the vampires one by one, until they finally face the Countess herself and try to kill her once and for all, before her evil consumes the city and allows Dracula's curse to consume the human race.  
Brahmastram
 Bangaram ([[Jagapati Babu]]) loses his memory in a childhood traumatic incident and is raised by the evil Rudra ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), who strictly keeps him in a cage in a cellar of his house and raises him into a ruthless fighter who is otherwise quite unkempt and uncivilized, cannot even speak properly, and eats just raw meat. Rudra uses him human bomb when he gets into problems to fight to kill. When Rudra takes off the holy Hindu wedding chain ([[Mangalsutra]]) tied to his right hand, off goes Bangaram like a raging bull, an unstoppable machine using the only ultimate weapon he knows: his body. He also uses him to make money by entering him in an underground fight club where the winner is the one who survives.   But, when a turf war ends up in a bloody carnage, Bangaram escapes and is taken in by a kind family consisting of blind piano tuner Vasudev ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]) and his teenage stepdaughter Gayathri ([[Neha Oberoi]]). Slowly, they teach Bangaram how to be a real person. How to behave and act in the civil society.They also teach him the delineation between good and bad. They even give him a new name Guru.  They also allow Bangaram to explore his love of the piano, where a specific tune haunts him, bringing back repressed memories from his long-ago past. In the process, both Guru and Gayathri fall in love. Gayathri is drawn towards Guru, attracted by his innocent and naïve ways of looking at life and things. Just when, Guru thinks he has escaped from his former life, he is pulled back in. But he is no longer the trained dog Rudra thinks he is. Rudra brainwashes Guru that it is his father who has killed his mother. This infuriates Guru and he goes in search of his father to finish him off. When Guru comes to know that Vasudev is his father, he is ready to kill his father. But, Vasudev reveals to Guru, who the real culprit is and why he had killed his mother in a flashback.  In the end, the family reunites and Guru kills Rudra and henchmen in an action-packed climax.  
The Break-Up
  Gary Grobowski and Brooke Meyers meet at [[Wrigley Field]] during a [[Chicago Cubs]] game and begin dating, eventually buying a [[condominium]] together. Gary works as a [[tour guide]] in a family business with his brothers, Lupus and Dennis. Brooke manages an [[art gallery]] owned by eccentric artist Marilyn Dean.  Their relationship comes to a head after the latest in an escalating series of arguments. Brooke, feeling unappreciated, criticizes Gary's perceived immaturity and unwillingness to work on improving their relationship. Gary is frustrated by Brooke's perceived controlling, perfectionistic attitude, and expresses his desire to have a little more independence (particularly when arriving home from work, wanting to unwind).  Brooke becomes irate when Gary fails to offer to help her clean up after a big dinner party at their home; and, still frustrated from their earlier, unresolved argument, breaks up with him (despite still being in love with him). Brooke seeks relationship advice from her sister Addie, while Gary goes to tell his side of things to friend Johnny Ostrofski.  Since neither is willing to move out of their condo, they compromise by living as roommates; but, each begins acting out to provoke the other in increasingly elaborate ways. Gary buys a pool table, litters the condo with food and trash, and even has a [[strip poker]] party with Lupus and a few women. Meanwhile, Brooke has Gary kicked off their "couples-only" bowling team, and starts dating other men in an attempt to make Gary jealous.  When their friend and [[realtor]] Mark Riggleman sells the condo, Gary and Brooke are given two weeks' notice to move out. Brooke invites Gary to an [[Old 97's]] concert, hoping that he will figure out that the gesture is meant to be her last-ditch attempt to salvage their relationship. Gary agrees to meet her there, but misses the hidden agenda, and misses the concert—unwittingly breaking Brooke's heart. When Gary goes out for a drink with Johnny, his friend points out that Gary has always had his guard up, has been guilty of a lot of selfishness, and never gave Brooke a chance, emotional intimacy-wise.  Afterwards, Brooke quits her job in order to spend time traveling [[Europe]]. When she brings a customer from the art gallery home one evening, Brooke finds the condo cleaned and Gary preparing a fancy dinner to win her back. He lays his heart on the line and promises to appreciate her more. Brooke becomes devastated and states that she just cannot give in anymore, and, therefore, does not feel the same way. Gary seems to understand and kisses her before leaving. It is later revealed that Brooke's "date" (who initially asked her out, but she politely rejected) was actually a client interested in a piece of artwork she kept at the condo.  Both eventually move out of the condo. Gary begins taking a more active role in his tour guide business, while Brooke travels the world, eventually returning to Chicago. Some time later, they meet again by chance on the street as Gary is bringing home groceries and Brooke is on her way to a meeting. After some awkward but friendly catching up, they part ways but each glances back over their shoulder and they share a smile.  
Bring It On: All or Nothing
 Britney Allen is living a 'dream life' as the cheerleading captain and girlfriend of Brad Warner, the star quarterback of Pacific Vista High School. Her [[Archenemy|nemesis]] is the highly ambitious Winnie Harper. Her life changes dramatically when her father loses his job, and the family must relocate to the disadvantaged city, Crenshaw Heights, which Britney, being the "[[Tokenism|White Girl]]", [[Culture shock|takes quite a while to adjust to]].   She meets Camille, cheerleading captain of the Crenshaw Heights Warriors and her friends and fellow cheerleaders, Kirresha and Leti. She also meets Jesse, a male cheerleader and the only person who is nice to her on her first day. Britney, at the urging of Winnie, has already vowed to never cheer for another team (as this would make her a 'cheer whore'), but after being dared by Camille and Jesse to show up at the cheerleading tryouts, Britney impresses everyone with her cheerleading skills and experience. Camille, after being persuaded by her friends to "do it for the squad," reluctantly invites her onto the squad. Britney and Jesse become close and eventually kiss.   Around this time, singer [[Rihanna]] announces a television special where all high school cheerleading squads can compete, with the winners appearing in a music video with her and winning new computers for their school. Winnie finds out that Britney's cheering with the Warriors and reveals this to her friends. A week later, Britney lies to Camille, telling her that she can't cheer at the next game as she's holding a memorial service for her dead dog; when she's actually going to Pacific Vista's Homecoming dance. Camille and Jesse arrive at Britney's to offer their condolences, and when they see Britney and Brad dressed up for the dance, Camille kicks her off the squad.   At the dance, Winnie reveals to everyone that she has been sleeping with Brad behind Britney's back causing Britney to dump him and end her friendship with Winnie, telling her that she's "too much of a [[Backstabbing|backstabber]] to have any real friends". On the day of the auditions, Britney arrives at the Warriors' bus and comes to wish them good luck. When Winnie, with the rest of her team, makes fun of the Warriors, Britney stands up to Winnie and defends them. Camille, impressed by this, lets Britney cheer with them again. Jesse, however, is still mad at her for not telling him that she had a boyfriend before they had kissed. Both of the rivaling teams show their performances. At the auditions, the two finalists are Pacific Vista and Crenshaw Heights. PV wows the audience with their routine and Camille starts getting worried. Then Britney points out that all their steps are repetitive and that they have their secret weapon: [[Krumping]]. Now dressed in streetwear instead of their regular uniforms, steps on stage during PV's performance and begins mirroring their steps. Finally, they begin krumping, wiping PV off the stage and impressing Rihanna with their routine.  After the Warrior's performance ends, Winnie approaches Rihanna and insists that Crenshaw Heights should be disqualified ("or arrested") for interrupting PV's routine. This leads to an argument between Winnie and the rest of the Pacific Vista squad, during which Britney notes, "Spirit Law states that if there's a cheer [[mutiny]], a squad can vote to replace their captain."   Everyone present, even Rihanna and the other performing squads, vote to replace Winnie as the Pacific Vista High cheerleading captain. Winnie protests, dismissing CH's style as "[[ghetto]]," to which Rihanna responds that she judges a squad by their skills and not by where they come from. Rihanna ultimately selects Crenshaw Heights as the winners, and the Pacific Vista squad (with Britney's friend Amber as their new captain) comes forward to congratulate them. Britney and Jesse also make up, kissing backstage after their first performance. The film ends with a made-for-film music video of Rihanna's "[[Pon de Replay]]" with the Crenshaw Heights squad dancing in the background. During the end credits, the main characters are seen dancing to the outro music as the film ends.  
Les Brigades du Tigre
 Valentin and his squad of ''Mobilards'' are assigned to track down the infamous [[Bonnot Gang]].  
Brand upon the Brain!
 Guy Maddin (played by Erik Steffen Maahs as an adult, and Sullivan Brown as a child), returns to Black Notch, a deserted island on which stands a lighthouse that was his family home, an orphanage run by his parents, to slap a fresh coat of paint on the lighthouse. The film is divided into twelve chapters, each of which is a flashback that Guy's ancestral house-painting has brought to the fore of his memory.   Guy, twelve years old in his memory, attends a secret meeting of orphans run by Savage Tom, a believer in pagan rituals. Tom says he will cut out the heart of Guy's friend Neddie but Guy's mother interrupts through the use of her "aerophone," a radio/loudspeaker that Guy's domineering mother uses to communicate across the entirety of the island and so keep control of her children, whom she also spies on with the help of a telescope mounted with the lighthouse's revolving light. In the orphanage/lighthouse, mother delights in repressing the orphans' desires as fully as possible, especially the sexual yearnings of Sis. Mother relates that she herself was an orphan because Maddin's grandmother was bald and scalped her sister for her hair, while her sister was so jealous of the pregnancy that Maddin's mother was literally cut out of her own mother's stomach. Maddin's father, little-seen, spends his time in a basement laboratory while Mother oversees all else.  In the woods one day Guy meets a young girl, Wendy Hale, a famous teen detective investigating why orphans adopted from the island all have holes bored in the backs of their heads. Guy falls for Wendy and the two join Sis and Neddie for a game of spin the bottle. Wendy falls in love with Sis and impersonates her twin brother Chance in order to pursue her. Guy develops a "Boy crush" on the disguised Wendy/Chance, who moves into the orphanage to further her/his investigation. Guy helps Wendy/Chance investigate and they discover that Father is using a sharp signet ring to drill into the skulls and draw nectar from their brains of the orphans (and his own children). The nectar is harvested and shipped to the mainland, and also used to extend Mother's youth. She becomes twenty years younger, and hopes to eventually return to infancy, but the effects are daily reversed by the age-ifying efforts of keeping Sis and the other children in line and properly repressed. Sis being the biggest problem, Mother sends her for additional nectar-harvesting, but the over-harvesting causes Sis to murder Father in self-defense.   Father is buried near the water and the orphans have to jump on the coffin so that it will sink into the flooded grave. Mother attempts suicide by dramatically taking poison and calling the orphans to her bedside to witness the lengths to which they've driven her. Sis has discovered that Chance is Wendy but nevertheless plans to marry the girl. Mother is enraged by the marriage and threatens to tell Father. To accomplish this, she exhumes the corpse and "boosts" it back to life using jumper cables connected to her own racing, nectar-infused heart. The zombie Father resumes his normal activities. Mother curses Sis further and becomes frenzied with hunger for more nectar. Guy stumbles upon Mother in the woods, eating through Neddie's skull. The crime compels Sis to force Mother, Father, and Savage Tom from the island in a rowboat. Guy, left on the island, and his Mother exchange calls of love over the water. Guy is soon sent off the island himself and into foster care.   Present-day Guy finishes painting the lighthouse, and encounters the ghost of Wendy, who tells him that Sis took over his Mother's place, to become just as tyrannical. She continued to harvest nectar from the orphans, and finally Wendy/Chance abandoned her and fled the island. This drove Sis to madness and to combusting in the lighthouse's lamp. Mother returns to the island, now blind, with the undead Father in tow. She attempts to restore her past regime, with Guy (her lone remaining child) her sole focus. Guy resists but life is less dramatic than before, until Father is murdered by sailors who were formerly orphans he victimized (they stuff him in a trash can and set him on fire). Mother soon readies to die, and Guy readies to catch her dying breath in a glass bottle. However, the ghost of Wendy/Chance distracts him and Mother dies furious with him for his inattention. Guy is left alone on the island, torn between the past and the future, contemplating suicide.  
The Breed (2006 film)
 The movie begins with a couple on a small sailboat who find a small island and begin to look around. The girl sneakily wanders off while the man ties up the boat. She stumbles across a fence and a small compound, but no one seems to be around. She is then attacked by unknown creatures. The man at the boat is startled by her screams.  Sometime later, a [[Republic RC-3 Seabee|seaplane]] heads to what appears to be the same island. Matt ([[Eric Lively|Lively]]) and John ([[Oliver Hudson|Hudson]]) are two brothers who are heading to the island for a week of fun and relaxation. The island was owned by their uncle, who built a cabin on it. He recently died, and the island is otherwise uninhabited. The brothers are joined by three friends, Nicki ([[Michelle Rodriguez|Rodriguez]]), Sara ([[Taryn Manning|Manning]]) and Noah ([[Hill Harper|Harper]]). Upon landing, they moor the seaplane at a dock near the cabin.  Soon after they arrive, a puppy shows up. The friends take him in to the cabin. Noah goes into the kitchen to get a drink. The puppy follows him in. The puppy then mysteriously growls at him and runs off. Sara and John then follow him out. They are ambushed by an older vicious dog and Sara is bitten by it. The pair manage to get back to the cabin.  The following morning, the men are in the forest. They bump into the man who came to the island at the beginning of the movie. He is bloody and warns them about the dogs. A pack of dogs attack and eat him. The men run back to the cabin and tell the women to come inside. A dog attacks Nicki and John shoots an arrow, wanting to kill the animal, but accidentally impales Nicki's shin instead. They are soon under siege by more vicious dogs.  The friends decide they must leave the island, but dogs have surrounded the plane. As they have no other way off the island, and no means of communication, they will have to wait out the dogs. However, a few minutes later, they see the plane has detached from its moorings and is drifting toward the ocean; the dogs have chewed through the ropes to force the friends out of the cabin. When John attempts to swim to the plane, the dogs are on the plane and they attack him. However, he manages to swim to the dock, then the friends retreat to the house. Sara begins to show distinct canine behavior, such as a ravenous appetite and growling.  Their next idea is to make their way to a storage shed and drive their uncle's car to the training compound, where they believe they can call for help. However, the car won't start and that night, with no other options, they continue to party. The power goes out, and Noah heads to the fuse box in the basement, where he is killed by dogs who have managed to enter the house. The dogs then find their way into the rest of the cabin, and Matt is bitten. John, Matt, Nicki and Sara have to hide in the attic. There, they discover paperwork relating to the training facility, and learn it was an Army facility to train attack dogs.  The next morning, the dogs have left. Matt and John make another attempt and manage to pop the clutch of their uncle's [[Mercedes Benz]]. They go back to pick up the women, but Sara does not want to leave. The dogs attack again, and in fighting one, Sara falls out of the window and impales herself and the dog on a post.  Matt, John, and Nicki drive to the facility and find it abandoned. They break in and discover that the dogs were being [[genetic engineering|genetically enhanced]]. John finds communications equipment, but a power cable on the antenna has been disconnected, so he goes out to fix it. Having been bitten, Matt learns he can sense the dogs, and realizes if they escaped they can get back in. When the antenna is powered up, John is accidentally shocked by electricity, and when he falls to the ground the dogs attack him. Matt shows up with a baseball bat to fight off the dogs, but a power surge has caused a fire in the compound. Nicki realizes the fire is creating a backdraft, and lures in the dogs before exposing them to the fire. The building then explodes.  John tells Matt he saw a nearby boat, which was owned by the couple from beginning of the film. When the dogs surround them, Nicki shows up in the Mercedes, they jump in and drive off. Because there are so many dogs, they cannot stop the car and get out, so John has Nicki drive the car off the pier. They swim to the boat and sail off. Thinking they are safe, they wonder if they can make it to medical facilities before Matt and John fall victim to the dog bites. In the last shot, they open the door to the sleeping quarters, and a stowaway dog leaps out.  
The Bridge (2006 drama film)
 [[Sea Org]] officer Ronnie Miscavige describes the planetary Scientology dissemination campaign. After the title sequence, Scientologist Diane Wheat (Carole Smith) is seen in an [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] session with the head of her local church, Robert Solomon (Bill Baker). Diane describes her trouble with finances and having her car [[repossession|repossessed]]. The next day Robert has Diane model her financial difficulties in clay. She is worried that her other financial obligations keep her from moving up Scientology's [[Bridge to Total Freedom]]. Robert tells her that she can work at the church in exchange for services to move up the Bridge.  Parallel to these events, Richard Grey (Tom Padgett) is trying to contact his daughter Amy at the [[Flag Land Base]] in [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]]. Church employees refuse to allow him to speak to her because, unbeknownst to him, he has been declared a [[suppressive person]]. He arrives at the local church on Saturday seeking more information. Diane, who is working as a receptionist, hands him a copy of the [[ethics (Scientology)|ethics]] order declaring him a suppressive person, and he leaves.  The next day, Diane is working at the church again when two teenage girls arrive. The girls have seen the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]" and want to attend a service for their own amusement. Diane tells them that the church does not have Sunday services, and shows them a promotional film for ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'' instead. At home, Richard is reading the [[Operation Clambake]] and [[Arnie Lerma|Lermanet.com]] web sites when he receives a panicked [[instant message]] from a friend. The friend tells him to watch a news report from Clearwater, and he learns that Amy has died after falling from the [[Fort Harrison Hotel]]. Shortly afterward, Robert calls Richard and informs him that he may not attend the funeral because Amy and her mother have [[disconnection|disconnected]] from him.  At a celebration of [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s birthday, Robert announces that Diane has attained the state of [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]] and gives her a Clear bracelet. After the celebration, he takes the bracelet away (but reminds her that she may purchase one of her own as they are not free) and shows her a film that encourages her to continue on the Bridge by taking the [[Operating Thetan]] courses at Flag. Late in the night, while she is cleaning, a distraught Richard comes by and asks if he can talk to anyone about being allowed into the funeral service. She refuses, but Richard insists on dropping off some old Scientology books and tapes that used to belong to Amy. Diane listens to one of Amy's cassettes from the high–level Clearwater Scientology center and hears a man's voice speaking scoldingly about being "willing to talk to the auditor", in an impenetrable jargon laden with nonsense words.  In the final act, protesters are seen outside the church loudly picketing over the death of Amy. When Diane walks out to confront them, they ask her to step outside the church gate and proceed to tell her the story of [[Xenu]] and the Wall of Fire from Operating Thetan level 3 (OT III). Robert notices Diane outside the church, tells her to go back inside, and threatens the protesters, but not before they have finished telling her the story. Once Diane is back inside, Robert runs her on a [[List of Scientology Security Checks|security check]] to determine whether she has any doubts or ill will toward Scientology.  Richard calls Amy's mother, who is still in Scientology and asks to be allowed at the funeral. She refuses and ends the call to avoid being sent to ethics. In the evening, Robert reminds Diane of the need to continue up the Bridge, and mentions the Wall of Fire at OT III. That night, disillusioned after returning to a room which earlier she was prevented from entering (being told it is a fully furnished office for the return of L. Ron Hubbard) and discovering it is merely a closet, Diane walks out the door of the church and leaves Scientology. The film ends with a written dedication: ''"For all who speak out — for those who have been silenced."''  
Bristol Boys
 The story revolves around Michael "Little Man" McCarthy and the rise and fall of marijuana dealers from [[Bristol, Connecticut]].

"There was no murder, but if I were the guy that ratted everybody out, I'd be concerned," said David.  David denies the movie is an attack on Bristol.

Breaking and Entering (film)
 Will Francis (Jude Law), a young Englishman, is a [[landscape architect]] living a detached, routine-based life in London with his Swedish-American girlfriend Liv (Robin Wright Penn) and her [[Autism|autistic]] daughter Bea. The 13-year-old girl's irregular sleeping and eating habits as well as her unsocial behaviour (she has trouble relating to people and seems only interested in doing [[somersault]]s and gymnastics) reach worrying proportions and start to put a lot of strain on Will and Liv's relationship. Complicating the situation further is his feeling of being shut out of their inner circle since Bea is not his biological daughter. He and Liv start relationship counselling, but their drifting apart continues.  Simultaneously on the business front, Will's and his partner Sandy's (Martin Freeman) state-of-the-art offices in the [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] area are repeatedly burgled by a group of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]-language-speaking thieves. The thieves employ a 15-year-old [[parkour|traceur]] named Mirsad "Miro" (Rafi Gavron) whose acrobatic skills allow them to enter the building. Miro is actually a refugee from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] living with his Bosnian Muslim mother Amira (Juliette Binoche) who works as a seamstress, while his Serbian father got murdered during [[Bosnian War|the war]].  Though they're puzzled about the burglars' ability to disable the alarm, the two architects are not particularly worried after the first break-in, mostly writing it off to the neighbourhood's dodgy reputation. However, after the second break-in, they decide to stake out the building after hours hoping to find the culprit and alert the police. Being out of the house on nightly stakeouts actually suits Will just fine, allowing him to get away from the cold atmosphere of his household. He even strikes up a strange acquaintance with an Eastern European prostitute named Oana (Vera Farmiga) who hangs around the area every night. Spotting Miro attempting to break in one night, Will attempts to follow him. This pursuit leads Will to the flat where Miro lives with his mother Amira. Realizing their modest living means, he decides not to report his findings to the police, but goes back to Amira's apartment under the guise of having a suit that needs mending.  He soon becomes emotionally entangled with her, causing him to re-evaluate his life. Conflict arises when the police close in on the burglars, and Will must make a crucial choice which will affect the lives of everyone around him.  
Brother Bear 2
 Picking up several months after the events of the first film, Kenai, now a cave bear, is living happily with his foster brother Koda. Having just awoken from [[hibernation]], the bears begin traveling to Crowberry Ridge for the first berries of the season. However, Kenai is haunted by memories of his childhood friend Nita, to whom he gave a special amulet many years ago after saving her from drowning. Nita, now grown up, is set to wed Atka, a man from a neighboring Inuit village. However, on the day of the wedding, the Spirits appear in the form of a storm that causes a fissure to open up in the ground between Nita and Atka, much to Nita's horror. Believing it to be a sign, Nita consults the wisest shaman of the tribes. By communicating with the Spirits, the shaman reveals that the amulet that Kenai gave Nita all those years ago bonded her and Kenai together. The only way for Nita to sever the bond and be able to marry Atka is to find Kenai, go with him to Hokani Falls (where Kenai gave Nita the amulet), and burn the amulet on the eve of the [[Equinox]], thus returning the bond to the Spirits. The shaman grants Nita the ability to communicate with Kenai and the other wildlife for this journey.  Eventually, Kenai and Koda meet up with Nita. At first, Kenai refuses to destroy the bond, but Nita tells him that the Spirits may turn him back into a human and send him to find her. Under pressure from Nita and Koda, who is worried that he and Kenai could no longer be brothers if this happens, Kenai relents and the three make their way to Hokani Falls. As they spend more time together, Kenai and Nita rekindle their old friendship, much to Koda's jealousy. One night, Nita asks Kenai if he ever thought of being human again. When Kenai says that he has considered it, Koda hears this and races up a mountain, grief-stricken that Kenai may leave him. Nita finds Koda hiding in a cave, but both are caught in an avalanche and barely rescued by Kenai. Kenai scolds Koda for almost getting himself killed, but the two reconcile with Kenai assuring Koda that he would never leave him.   The trio eventually make it to Hokani Falls, where they burn the amulet. Without it, Nita can no longer communicate with Kenai or Koda, so she says goodbye. Seeing how depressed Kenai is and realizing that he loves Nita, Koda secretly asks his mother in the spirit world to turn Kenai back into a human so he can be happy. The next morning, Rutt and Tuke (whom Kenai, Koda, and Nita ran into multiple times throughout their journey, and whom Nita helped woo a pair of female Canadian moose) inform Kenai that Koda went to the village to retrieve Nita. Knowing that Koda could be killed, Kenai follows after him.   At the village, the tribes prepare for the wedding once again, but Nita, realizing her feelings for Kenai, tells her father that she cannot marry Atka. At that moment, Koda creates a major commotion in the village in order to get Nita's attention, while Kenai arrives to retrieve Koda. Rutt and Tuke rescue Koda from two of the villagers, while Atka battles Kenai, shoving him off of a cliff and into shallow water. Nita rushes to Kenai's aide, where the two profess their love for each other. The Spirits appear to change Kenai back into a human, allowing Nita to communicate with Kenai and Koda. Kenai tells Nita that he cannot become a human again and leave Koda, but Nita tells him that she can be with him. With her father's blessing, the Spirits transform Nita into a bear. The film ends with Kenai and Nita's wedding that the tribes, bears, Rutt, Tuke and their mates happily watch.  
Broken Trail
  '''''Part 1'''''  In San Francisco in 1898, countless Chinese girls are sold into slavery and brought to the American West to live as prostitutes among the miners and railway workers. Capt. Billy Fender ([[James Russo]]) arrives in San Francisco and purchases five Chinese girls to be sold as prostitutes in Idaho.  In southeastern Oregon, Prentice "Prent" Ritter ([[Robert Duvall]]), an aging cowboy, arrives at the Gap Ranch to inform his cowboy nephew, Tom Harte ([[Thomas Haden Church]]), that his mother died. Estranged from her son years earlier after he left the family ranch to become a buckaroo, she left behind a brief impersonal note informing her son that she left everything in her will to her brother Prent. Uncomfortable with her unfair decision, and wanting to reconnect with his nephew, Prent tells him about his plan to transport 500 horses from Oregon to Sheridan, Wyoming, where he will sell them to the British Army. He offers Tom 25% of the profits if he joins him in the business venture.  After purchasing 500 horses from various ranches in the region, Prent and Tom head out east with the herd toward the Idaho border. Along the way, Prent sends Tom into a nearby town to purchase supplies. At the local saloon, he purchases three bottles of whiskey. When the bartender attempts to throw out an Irish fiddler named Heck Gilpin ([[Scott Cooper (director)|Scott Cooper]]), Tom intervenes and punches out the bartender. He hires the fiddler to accompany them on their venture.  Back on the trail, they meet Capt. Billy Fender and his five Chinese girls. Fender asks if he can follow along and Prent agrees. That night, Fender offers the cowboys sex with one of the Chinese girls, but they decline. Later, Fender drugs the cowboys' whiskey, and while they sleep, he steals their money and saddled horses and escapes with one of the girls, leaving the other Chinese girls behind. The next morning, the men realize what's happened, and Tom rides off in search of Fender. He finds him in a drunken sleep after he's raped the girl. Tom hangs Fender from a tree and heads back to camp with the girl.  Meanwhile, Prent becomes acquainted with the Chinese girls who are taught to call him "Uncle Prent". Unable to bridge the language gap, Prent assigns numbers to the girls, naming Ghee Moon ([[Jadyn Wong]]) #1, Mai Ling (Caroline Chan) #2, Sun Fu ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]) #3, Ye Fung ([[Olivia Cheng (Canadian actress)|Olivia Cheng]]) #4, and Ging Wa ([[Valerie Tian]]) #5. After Tom returns with #4, the group continues east across Idaho. As the oldest of the girls, #3 explains to the others that these men are good and will protect them. Along the way, Tom teaches #3 how to drive the wagon, and Prent teaches #5 how to ride a horse. One night, #2 develops a tick fever. While Tom watches over her during the night, she dies. The next morning, after they bury her, Prent speaks over the grave: "We're all travelers in this world. From the sweet grass to the packing house, from birth 'til death, we travel between the eternities."  Meanwhile, a hired killer named Ed "Big Ears" Bywaters ([[Chris Mulkey]]) rides into the town of Caribou City, Idaho where he meets up with "Big Rump" Kate Becker ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]), the woman who runs the city and its illegal activities. Fender was supposed to deliver the five Chinese girls to Kate, who provided him with the money. She offers to pay Ed to bring the girls back to her, but he is more interested in abusing one of Kate's prostitutes, Nola Johns ([[Greta Scacchi]]).  Back on the trail, Prent and his outfit meet up with two strangers, one of whom Prent identifies as Smallpox Bob, and proceeds to gun him down. He orders Tom to kill his companion and his horse. Smallpox Bob infected thousands of Indians by selling them smallpox-infected blankets. Afterwards, they burn Bob and his companion and their horses and blankets. As the flames rise, the ghosts of their Indian victims dance over the flames. That night, #3 notices a hole torn in Tom's shirt, and she mends the shirt while he sleeps. A silent attraction has grown between the two.  The next day, Prent orders Tom and Heck to take the girls into the town of Caribou City and find someone who will take care of them. In town, after finding a room for the girls, Tom meets Lung Hay (Donald Fong) who is able to speak with the girls in their native language. Lung Hay explains to Tom that the girls do not want to leave Tom, Prent, and Heck—that they do not feel safe without them. Later at the saloon, Tom and Heck meet "Big Rump" Kate, who offers them one of her whores. After they decline, she demands that they hand over the Chinese girls whom she paid for when she hired Fender.  Back at the girls' room, three men break in and attack the Chinese girls wanting to rape them. Nola Johns hears the nearby screams and rushes in to help them, only to be hit in the face by one of the attackers. Tom and Heck rush in, throw one man out the window and beat up another. They throw the third man to the floor, and Tom shoots both of his thumbs off. Nola begs Tom to take her with them for her protection. As they all prepare to leave town, Kate and her henchmen approach, but Tom draws his weapon and guards his party as they leave. Kate vows to take revenge.  '''''Part 2'''''  Prent and his group recover from their ordeal, as Tom stitches the wound on Lung Hay's head, and Prent treats Nola's broken nose. They decide to spend several days resting the horses by the Snake River. Prent sees two men [[fly fishing]] and wishes he could try it someday. At night the men talk about the unfathomable mysteries of women, and they all enjoy listening to Heck's fiddle music. They begin to reveal more about themselves. Lung Hay left his wife in China many years ago to follow the promise of gold in America. Nola turned to prostitution after her husband killed himself. Heck was educated back east, but the prospect of adventure led him out west. Prent and Nola begin spending more time together, but Prent—whose memory of his dead wife and seven-year-old daughter still haunt him—is cautious about his feelings for her. Tom and #3 also spend time with each other, going for long walks together. No one notices #4 growing more depressed and withdrawn. One afternoon on the trail, she steps in front of stampeding horses and is killed.  Prent and his outfit continue east through Wyoming, encountering a band of Crow Indians who demand payment to pass through their land. They demand two horses. Prent insists on only one, but gives the Indians a small carved horse figure he made as the second horse. Further on, Prent and Tom sense that they are being followed. That night, Prent sits alone by the fire while the others hide nearby. Ed and his gang ride into the camp. They were hired by Kate to bring back the Chinese girls and kill the rest. Pretending to be Smallpox Bob, Prent scares them away with the help of Tom and Heck providing cover.  After passing through [[Cody, Wyoming]], Prent decides to head north through the [[Big Horn Mountains]] and over a steep pass known as the Whale's Back in order to avoid Ed and his gang. Tom wants to face the horse thieves and kill them, but Prent remains adamant. Although the way is steep, they manage to make it over with the horses safely. Eventually, Prent leads his horses safely into [[Sheridan, Wyoming]], where he closes out the deal with Malcolm, who purchases the horses on behalf of the British Army. Afterwards, Prent and the others relax, bathe, and enjoy a good meal at Malcolm's home. That night, Prent gives Tom his share of the profits so he can start a new life.  The next day, after Tom rides off to gather in the strays, Ed and his gang show up in Sheridan and kill Heck. In the ensuing gun battle, Ed takes Nola, Lung Hay, and the girls hostage, forcing Prent to throw down his rifle. Just as Ed prepares to torture and kill Prent, the aging cowboy yells out a warning to Tom, who has just arrived back at the ranch. Tom rushes to the scene, aims, and shoots the gang members and wounds Ed. As the burly killer takes aim at Tom, Prent takes a heavy mallet and clubs Ed to death.  Sometime later, Nola and the girls prepare to board a [[stagecoach]] to San Francisco. Tom says goodbye to #3 as a gentle snow falls over them. She hugs Tom and boards the stage, but at the last minute, overwhelmed by feelings of love for the young cowboy, steps down with her bags. As the stage pulls away, Tom sees her standing there, and he smiles.  In 1912 at Siam Bend on the Snake River in Wyoming, Prent is fly fishing on his ranch when his longtime friend Lung Hay approaches with a letter from Nola, who has been corresponding with him for fourteen years. She writes that the girls are doing fine, and that her love for him has never wavered. In 1913, Heck's parents had his body disinterred and reburied in Richmond, Virginia. Ging Wa (#5) studied medicine at Stanford University and moved to China with Ghee Moon (#1) to start a hospital. They were lost in [[Mao Zedong]]'s revolution. Tom Harte and Sun Fu married, and their grandchildren still ranch in Wyoming. Nola Johns was buried at Siam Bend on the Snake River. Prent rests at her side.

Bug (2006 film)
 The film opens with a dead body in a strange looking room. We then meet Agnes White, who is a waitress at a [[gay bar]] living in a run-down motel in rural [[Oklahoma]]. Unable to move on from the disappearance of her son some years previously, she engages in drug and alcohol binges with her lesbian friend, R.C. Lately, she has been plagued by silent telephone calls that she believes are being made by her [[Domestic violence|abusive]] ex-husband, Jerry Goss, who has recently been released from prison.  One night, R.C. introduces Agnes to Peter Evans, a drifter who says he is a recently discharged soldier. Agnes and Peter reach out to each other out of loneliness, and start a relationship after Jerry visits Agnes. He convinces her that he was the subject of biological testing by the U.S. government while he was in the military, and says the anonymous phone calls she has been receiving were made by government agents in anticipation of his arrival. After they have sex, Peter tells Agnes that their room has become infested by bugs sent there by the government as part of their experiments.  Peter's movements and behavior become more erratic as he fights the bugs, invisible to the audience, that he claims are infesting his body. Agnes soon joins in this behavior. R.C tries to convince Agnes to leave Peter, and mentions that a man named Dr. Sweet is looking for him, but is sent away by Agnes after Peter has an episode. Over time, they isolate themselves from the outside world, sealing themselves in their room and covering it with [[flypaper]] and [[aluminum foil]] and lighting it with the glow from [[bug zapper]]s. Peter, believing that a colony of microscopic bugs was implanted in one of his teeth, tears it out of his head. Using a child's microscope, he says he sees the bugs in the remains of the crushed tooth, as does Agnes.  A Dr. Sweet arrives, and tells Agnes that Peter has escaped while under treatment at a [[mental institution]] and that delusions about insects are a known symptom of Peter's mental illness. Peter kills Sweet, telling Agnes that he was a robot sent by the government. Together, Peter and Agnes elaborate upon Peter's beliefs in a conspiracy, including that Agnes' son was kidnapped by the government to lead her and Peter to meeting and that each of them is infected with bugs that are meant to mate with one another and take over the world. In order to prevent this, Agnes and Peter douse each other in gasoline and set themselves on fire.  In the end credits, the audience sees the toys in Agnes and Peter's room completely intact, with no sign of the aluminium foil, and opening shot of the film with the body of Dr. Sweet, in the room covered with foil but undamaged by fire. Which shot, if any, shows "reality" is left unclear.

The three roommates live a generally [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life.  Ashraf arrives at the apartment to return Noam's [[passport]], which he had dropped and left at the checkpoint. Noam takes Ashraf to the roof to look at the city skyline. They talk and Ashraf kisses Noam and they spend the night together. Soon it is agreed that Ashraf will move in with them and work in Yali's restaurant as a Jew under the name Shimi, as he could not be openly gay in the [[Palestinian territories]] like he can in the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Tel Aviv. For a time, all goes well for the couple despite some jealousy on the part of Yali. However, Ashraf flees to his family in [[Nablus]] when he is recognized by Lulu's former boyfriend as a Palestinian. Ashraf does not return any of Noam's calls.  Noam is devastated by Ashraf's desertion, and refuses to get out of bed. When the news reports violence in Ashraf's hometown, Noam becomes worried. He and Lulu go to the [[West Bank]] identifying themselves as French television journalists and find Ashraf at his parents' house and there the two men kiss. Ashraf's future brother-in-law, Jihad (who is a [[Hamas]] militant), sees them and repudiates him, adding that Ashraf has to marry his cousin or he will reveal his secret. Lulu and Noam leave in a hurry, but encourage Ashraf to come to their anti-occupation [[rave party]]. Ashraf shows up, and he and Noam spend another night together.  Before his sister's wedding ceremony, Ashraf tells her he is in love with a man. She angrily refuses to believe him, and Ashraf is devastated.

The next morning, Ashraf's sister is killed by stray bullets in a military raid seeking those responsible for the Tel Aviv bombing, before his very eyes. At the funeral Jihad promises revenge, telling Ashraf's father that his daughter was a [[martyr]] and will not die in vain. Jihad once again demands that Ashraf marry his cousin, revealing a poster of Ashraf's involvement with the Israeli rave. It is clear at this point that Ashraf is walled in and feels no hope of escape from his situation. His brother-in-law, Jihad, decides to avenge the death of his newlywed bride, and while creating a suicide video, Ashraf decides to take Jihad's place as a [[suicide bomber]] in Tel Aviv.  Ashraf wanders the streets of Tel Aviv with a sorrowful and blank expression. He winds up at the cafe in which he once worked. When Ashraf primes his explosive belt, Noam sees him from inside the bar where he has just bought Yali's and Lulu's dinner, and rushes out to Ashraf. Seeing Noam, Ashraf walks away from the bar to the middle of the street. As Noam approaches, Ashraf turns to face him. The two stare at each other and start to kiss when the bomb explodes, killing them both. The news report that Ashraf avoided more death by suddenly turning away from the cafe into the empty street. The film ends with Noam talking about the love the two shared, wondering whether they ever had a chance, wishing for a place where they can just love each other, and hoping that people will see "how stupid these wars are", over a scene of young Noam and young Ashraf playing together as children in [[Jerusalem]], their mothers sitting side by side.  
The Butcher (2006 film)

One of the girls in the vehicle dies, and is accompanied by a friend while the others go looking for help in the small town. They find an old house in the woods, which is inhabited by a family of psychopaths, who proceed to chase and hunt down the group of kids.  
Caffeine (film)
 The staff and customers of the cafe get an extra "jolt" with their coffee when a commitment-shy man has a public fight with his angry ex-girlfriend, instigating a series of revelations about the eavesdropping couples nearby and their own "unusual" relationships; filled with eccentric personal conversations, confrontational arguments, imaginary visions, and connections between various characters.  
The Caiman
 Opening with a wedding between two young Communists, officiated by a CP functionary, under the poster of Mao-Tse Tung, the bride suddenly spears the man and escapes, chased by the police. This is the end of 'Cataratte'/'Cataracts', a 10-year-old action B-movie projected in an open-air cinema in honor of Bruno Bonomo ([[Silvio Orlando]]), a cockeyed film producer,  who did some trash movies starring his wife Paola ([[Margherita Buy]]) in the 1970s. He also has two young sons loved by him and his wife. During this homage, a young woman presents him the script of a movie she wants to direct with his help.  Slated to start on a project celebrating the return voyage of Columbus just after his discovery of America, Bruno is stunned when his director, Franco Caspio, quits because of the low budget. Suddenly Bruno has no projects, no financing and no leverage.  Added to his many troubles, Bruno's wife asks for a separation even though they have two sons. She wants to pursue her artistic options.  Bruno reads the offered script and realizes that it's a thinly disguised account of Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate who promoted his political career through his TV stations. Knowing this could draw political and legal heat, not to mention difficulty for finding funding; but the young woman convinces Bruno to start production on ''The Caiman''. The film shows how secret money, slush funds and Swiss bank accounts start Il Caimano's career as a big building developer. She hopes that the film will influence voters in the elections slated for 2006.  Starting to fall in love with the writer, Bruno meets her lesbian partner and her son 'made' in a 'journey' to the Netherlands.  The production of the film is rife with problems, including the defection of the main actor Marco Pulici ([[Michele Placido]]), but the plot of ''The Caiman'' also deals with the domestic issues between Bonomo and Paola until their final separation, with the compromises made for their two sons.  Despite growing evidence that his film will never be completed, Bonomo decides to shoot the last scene, which shows the political nucleus behind the film: in it, Silvio Berlusconi (played by [[Nanni Moretti]] himself) enters the tribunal room to hear the ruling against him (see [[Silvio Berlusconi#Legal investigations of Berlusconi|Legal investigations of Berlusconi]]), which sentences him to seven years of jail. Notwithstanding the sentence, Berlusconi/Moretti exits the tribunal while a crowd throws debris at the judges, including a [[Molotov cocktail]].  The whole, crude scene is not only an allusion to Berlusconi's judiciary controversies, but also to his powerful ability to communicate, which (in Moretti's view) led Italian people to support him anyway despite his controversial past.

  In a world populated by [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[vehicles]], the last race of the Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran [[Strip Weathers|Strip "The King" Weathers]], infamous runner-up [[Chick Hicks]], and rookie [[Lightning McQueen]]. The [[tiebreaker]] race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in [[California]]. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rusteze, a bumper ointment company, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative [[List of Pixar film references#Dinoco|Dinoco]] team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his [[Semi-trailer truck|big rig]], [[Mack (Cars)|Mack]], to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of [[The Delinquent Road Hazards|four reckless street racers]], causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, but instead finds a grumpy [[Peterbilt]]. He then decides to head back the Interstate to find Mack, but ends up lost in the run-down desert town of [[Radiator Springs]], while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road.  After being arrested and impounded overnight (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, [[tow truck]] named [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]]), McQueen is ordered by the town judge, [[Doc Hudson]], to leave town immediately. The local lawyer, [[Sally Carrera]], requests that McQueen should instead be given [[community service]] to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave the road in a single day, but turns out shoddy, and he is forced to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he befriends several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along the old [[U.S. Route 66]], but with the construction of [[Interstate 40]] bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is the "[[Fabulous Hudson Hornet]]", a three-time Piston Cup winner, whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954, and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes repaving the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally chastises Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.  At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully set on the race due to him missing Sally and his other new friends, and soon he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other cars from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, illegally side swipes Weathers and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns to reunite with Sally, and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.

Héctor Pérez leaves Puerto Rico, even though his father tries to persuade him not to go because if he does he'll lose a father. Héctor decides to go anyway against his father's will in an attempt to pursue his dreams. On his first night in the city he meets Eddie (Manny Pérez) and discovers the new sound of salsa flowing through the streets. He eventually becomes the lead singer in a salsa group performing in a bar. One night he is approached by salsa musician, Willie Colón (John Ortiz) and Johnny Pacheco. Johnny offers them a deal with Fania Records Company and Hector accepts. The company also suggests that he change his name to Héctor Lavoe. "Lavoe" meaning "the voice" in French.   Héctor falls in love with Puchi, a girl who danced at the club where he performed. He confesses to her that his mother died when he was young, his brother was killed the night he came to New York and that he didn't have many people in his life. She tells him that they'll take care of each other. It is revealed that Héctor was cheating on Puchi with another girl named Carmen. Puchi reveals that Carmen and she were pregnant with a baby of his at the same time. But she is the only woman of his life because he chose her. They eventually get married and have a son named Tito. On a night of hard partying, Héctor catches Eddie doing drugs and does so too. This will be the start of his drug addiction.   Through the years, after Héctor's consistent tardiness to gigs, Willie grows tired of Héctor's irresponsibility and decides to go solo. Héctor's drug and alcohol addiction continues to grow stronger and becomes very noticeable. Puchi is infuriated when she finds Tito eating alone and Héctor shooting up while the gas was on. She begs Héctor to quit the drugs and to turn his life around for their son and because he is always high and is missing out and she loves him.   One night, Puchi wakes up to Héctor sitting with a gun staring into space, suicidally depressed. In fear she sends him to rehab. Puchi can't help feeling extremely guilty when Héctor's sister Priscilla blames all of Héctor's problems on her. She later takes him out and he is put on medication. A jealous Héctor calls Puchi a whore and frequently accuses her of having affairs with many different men. Héctor maintains sobriety and takes his family to Puerto Rico for vacation. When Héctor tries to reconcile with his father after leaving against his will, he rejects Héctor. This causes him more pain. He is diagnosed with HIV and advises Puchi to get tested as well. He maintains sobriety for a while but soon has a relapse and goes back to his old ways. Puchi and Héctor fight often and it usually ends with him leaving the house and then coming back and apologizing to her.   Tito is killed when his friend accidentally shoots him while playing with the gun Héctor kept in the house. This scars Héctor for the rest of his life. In the interview, Puchi admits that Héctor was never the same after that, and he died along with their son. She says everyone expected too much from him.  Héctor confesses to Willie that he loves Puchi and that he wishes he would've done things differently, but it's too late and nothing is the same anymore. Willie encourages him to perform at a gig in Puerto Rico. At the concert, there is less than half of the audience due to bad managing and advertising. Still, he decides to perform for the few people who still showed up while it starts raining. He just couldn't hold in all the pain anymore. The depression and guilt are too much for Héctor to handle and it drives him to attempt suicide by jumping out a window. He survives the fall and lives another 5 years.   Puchi is seen in her new apartment, listening to a voice mail from Hector, wishing her a happy birthday and that he'll always be there and love her. She smiles and begins to dance while looking at a picture of her and Héctor on the wall. The movie ends with Héctor performing and the credits revealing that he died at the age of 46 of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], from sharing needles. It is also, revealed that Puchi died shortly after this interview in 2002.  
Cannibal (2006 film)
  In the intro, a mother reads the story of ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' to her young boy. The setting then moves to the present day, where The Man goes about his day-to-day routines and occasionally chats with others on his computer, where he looks for someone who shares his cannibalistic fantasies. The Man meets with several people he had chatted with, but he either rejects them or is rejected (and in one case attacked) by them, except for The Flesh, a suicidal man who volunteers to be killed and eaten by The Man. The Flesh travels to The Man from [[Berlin]], and the two bond, having sex and frolicking in the nude in and around The Man's home.  When The Flesh decides that it is time for him to die and be devoured, he tries to coerce The Man into biting off his penis, but The Man is unable to go through with it, even when The Flesh uses drugs to knock himself out in an attempt to make things easier. Disappointed, The Flesh chastises The Man. The Flesh decides to give him another chance when The Man begs him to stay just as he is about to board a train back to Berlin. Returning to The Man's home, The Flesh ingests a large amount of alcohol and pills, then instructs The Man to castrate him with a kitchen knife, which The Man succeeds at doing. The two then fry and attempt to eat the severed penis, before The Flesh seemingly dies of blood loss in a bath The Man places The Flesh in.  The Man drags The Flesh's inert body (which vomits and defecates repeatedly) to a room he has readied for slaughter. Before he can begin taking The Flesh apart, The Man is shocked to discover The Flesh is still alive, so he stabs him in the throat. The Man then beheads, guts and dismembers The Flesh, buries the inedible parts, and cooks and eats the rest; he places The Flesh's severed head at the head of the table. The Man then masturbates to video footage of what he has done, and leaves.  
Casino Royale (2006 film)
 MI6 agent [[James Bond]] gains his [[license to kill (concept)|licence to kill]] and status as a [[00 agent]] by assassinating the traitorous [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] section chief [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Casino Royale|Dryden]] at the British Embassy in [[Prague]], as well as his contact, Fisher, in a bathroom in [[Lahore|Lahore, Pakistan]].

Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest safely for him; instead Le Chiffre uses it to buy [[put option]]s on the aerospace company Skyfleet, thus betting the money on the company's failure.  In [[Madagascar]], Bond pursues bomb maker [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Casino Royale|Mollaka]] to an African embassy, shooting him dead and blowing up the building. In [[London]], [[MI6]] chief [[M (James Bond)|M]] admonishes Bond for having violated international law, and advises him to rethink his future as an agent.  Clues from Mollaka point to corrupt Greek official [[Alex Dimitrios]]. Bond finds Dimitrios in the [[Bahamas]] and, after seducing his wife Solange, pursues him to [[Miami]]. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. He thwarts the destruction of [[Skyfleet S570|Skyfleet's airliner]], costing Le Chiffre his investment. To recoup the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the [[British government]], which they will grant in exchange for information on his clients. On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] agent there to protect the government's $10&nbsp;million [[buying in (poker)|buy-in]].

Vesper is traumatised by the encounter, but Bond comforts her. When the tournament resumes, Bond loses his initial stake, and Vesper refuses to fund further playing. Frustrated, Bond is about to kill Le Chiffre when he meets [[Felix Leiter]], a fellow player and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who is on the same mission as Bond. Leiter, on the verge of losing, agrees to stake Bond on the condition that the CIA takes custody of Le Chiffre after his defeat.  Bond rapidly rebuilds his position before the next break. Le Chiffre's girlfriend, [[List of henchmen of James Bond villains#Casino Royale|Valenka]], spikes Bond's [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] with [[digitalis]] poison. Bond vomits and retreats to his [[Aston Martin]] to inject himself with an antidote. MI6 instructs him to use the [[defibrillator]], but a wire is disconnected; Vesper saves Bond by reconnecting the wire. Bond returns to the game just as Leiter loses his last hand to Le Chiffre. The tournament culminates in a $115-million hand in which the remaining players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, go all in. Le Chiffre trumps the other players, but Bond wins with a [[straight flush]].  After Bond and Vesper share a romantic dinner, Vesper is kidnapped by Le Chiffre's men. Bond pursues them in his Aston Martin. He sees Vesper lying in the street and swerves to avoid her, crashing his Aston Martin. They are taken captive by Le Chiffre. Before Bond falls unconscious, Le Chiffre reveals that Mathis was his [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in MI6. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the password to the account containing the money, but Bond refuses to give in. As Le Chiffre prepares to castrate Bond, White bursts in and shoots him dead. Bond awakens in a hospital on [[Lake Como]] as Mathis is taken in by MI6. Bond decides to resign from MI6 to be with Vesper.  Bond and Vesper travel to [[Venice]]. M calls Bond and tells him the money was never deposited. Bond calls Mendel, the Swiss banker responsible for the monetary transactions following the poker tournament, to figure out what is going on. Mendel informs Bond that the money has been deposited, but is being withdrawn as they speak. Realising Vesper has stolen it, Bond pursues her and her clients into a building. The building is damaged in the struggle and begins to sink into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], with Vesper trapped inside. Bond kills Vesper's clients and attempts to save her, but she refuses his attempts and drowns. White, watching nearby, walks away with the money.  Bond rejoins MI6 and copes with Vesper's death by denouncing her as a traitor. M informs him the [[SPECTRE#rebooted community|same organisation]] behind Le Chiffre had kidnapped Vesper's lover and threatened to kill him unless she became a [[double agent]]. During the torture with Le Chiffre, Vesper made a deal: the money in exchange for Bond's life. Bond discovers a text message left for him by Vesper with White's name and phone number.  At his estate in [[Lake Como]], White receives a phone call from Bond. As he asks for the caller's identity, Bond shoots him in the leg, then introduces himself: "The name's Bond... James Bond."

Cashback (film)
 Aspiring artist Ben Willis develops [[insomnia]] after a painful breakup with his girlfriend, Suzy. To take his mind off Suzy and to occupy the extra waking hours he has recently gained, Ben begins working at a local [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, where he meets colourful co-workers. Among them is his colleague Sharon, with whom he soon develops a mutual crush. As his personal means to escape the boredom inherent in the night shift, Ben lets his imagination run wild. In particular, he imagines that he can stop time so that he can walk around in a world that is "frozen" like the pause of a film. He imagines female patrons of the supermarket stopped in time, allowing him to undress and draw them.  Finally the ability to stop time becomes real.  A series of flashbacks occur with each progression of the plot, accompanied by Ben's narration and an examination of the effect the situation had had upon him. He explains how he always has been impressed by the beauty of the female body: how he, as a young boy, witnessed a Swedish boarder walk naked from the shower to her room. In another flashback, the young Ben and his best friend Sean share Sean's discovery of his parents' adult magazines, and Sean pays a neighbourhood girl [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|fifty pence]] to show him, and all the neighbourhood boys, her [[vulva]].  Ben's boss, Alan Jenkins, recruits the staff for a weekend football game and, after an embarrassing defeat, 26-Nil, Ben freezes time again. This time he discovers that he is not alone when he sees a mysterious stranger who is able to move inside the frozen world as he can. When Jenkins throws a party to honour his own birthday and as a consolation for their defeat, Sharon asks Ben to be her date, to which he eagerly but nervously agrees. While there, Ben encounters his ex-girlfriend Suzy, who implores him to try their relationship again. Ben refuses her advance but she kisses him, just as Sharon witnesses from afar. Sharon angrily leaves the party. Ben realizes Sharon has seen the kiss, and freezes time. After spending several days "frozen", Ben concludes that although he can stop time, he cannot reverse it to correct the mistake. He eventually seeks to explain himself to Sharon at her apartment, and a confrontation similar to the film-opening breakup occurs. Sharon henceforth does not show up to work at the supermarket.  As a [[practical joke]], colleagues Barry and Matt phone Ben; Matt poses as an art gallery owner who is interested in displaying Ben's drawings, and schedules an appointment for Ben to present more to him. When Ben arrives as agreed, the reaction of the owner quickly reveals that he has been pranked. However, the gallery owner is nonetheless interested in Ben's work and decides to exhibit Ben's drawings. Sharon receives an invitation to the exhibition and visits. She is moved as most of the pieces depict her and she happily greets Ben, congratulating him on his success. The finale occurs as Ben shares his ability to stop time with her and the two step outside into a time-frozen snowfall.

Catch a Fire (film)
 In South Africa in 1980, [[Patrick Chamusso]], a young, apolitical man, is accused of carrying out a terrorist attack. [[Afrikaner]] police officer Nic Vos is in charge of locating the perpetrators of a recent [[bomb attack]] against the [[Secunda CTL]] [[synthetic fuel]] refinery, which is the largest [[coal liquefaction]] plant in the world.  Patrick is unwillingly swept into Vos's investigation due to his inability to provide a satisfactory explanation for his whereabouts at the time of the bombing (he was actually having an affair with a woman not his wife). Eventually Patrick, his wife, Precious, and his family are tortured by Vos and his subordinates. Desperate, Patrick says that he is willing to confess to a crime he did not commit to protect his family. Vos concludes that Patrick is innocent, and orders his release.  Fuelled by the anger at the injustices he and his family suffered, Patrick joins [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the military wing of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and becomes exactly what Vos had initially accused him of being. He attempts to execute a plan to attack Secunda, the oil refinery he used to work for, by first bombing its adjacent water supply facilities, and 15 minutes later triggering the main explosion within the refinery itself. This would allow the refinery's workforce to flee between the two explosions, and not be harmed. Also, the damage of the first bomb would reduce the possibility of successfully extinguishing the fire caused by the second, main explosion. Patrick succeeds in the first part, but the second bomb is discovered by Vos and deactivated.  Patrick is arrested and sentenced to 24 years in prison, after his wife goes to Vos and tells him where Patrick is, because she fell for a simple trick in which Vos left photographs of Patrick talking to a female member of the ANC. Through her unjust jealousy she sells him out. He is released early due to the abolition of apartheid.  Precious, who has remarried, is waiting for him and apologizes, and Patrick forgives her and says he is sorry as well. Some time later, he sees Vos sitting out near a small body of water. He creeps over and sees that it is indeed Vos, and though a part of him wants to break Vos' neck, he decides that it is not worth it. He left Vos alone, and went on to remarry and take in over 80 orphaned children in South Africa to provide a home for kids who lost their families during the anti-apartheid struggle.

She successfully begs her father to spare the piglet's life. John gives the piglet to Fern, and she nurtures the piglet lovingly, naming him Wilbur. To her regret, when Wilbur has matured, Fern is forced to take him to her uncle, Homer Zuckerman, in whose barnyard he is left yearning for companionship but is snubbed by other barn animals, until befriended by Charlotte, a spider who lives in the space above Wilbur's sty in the Zuckermans' barn. When the other animals reveal to Wilbur that he will be prepared for dinner in due time, Charlotte promises to hatch a plan guaranteed to spare Wilbur's life.

Chaos (2005 Capitol film)
 [[Seattle Police Department|Seattle PD]] Detective Quentin Conners ([[Jason Statham]]) and his partner Jason York are implicated in the death of a hostage taken by a [[carjacker]] named John Curtis. After a fellow police officer, Callo ([[John Cassini]]), testifies against them, Conners is suspended, and York is fired. In reality, York tried to shoot John, but accidentally killed the hostage. John in turn fired back, but Conners killed John in self-defense.  Some time later, Lorenz ([[Wesley Snipes]]) and four other criminals take hostages in a bank. Lorenz has only one demand, to negotiate with Conners. Conners is reinstated but put under the surveillance of a new partner, the recently-graduated Shane Dekker ([[Ryan Phillippe]]). Conners is given control of the negotiations, and after a bank teller is shot, he orders a [[SWAT]] unit to cut the building's power and go in. During an explosion, the criminals flee during the ensuing panic and chaos.  Dekker and Conners learn more about each other at a local diner, slowly building a friendship, but Dekker disapproves of Conners' "cowboy cop" methods. Dekker explains that during negotiations, Lorenz was making many cryptic references to [[chaos theory]]. As they leave to examine new evidence, Conners pays with a ten dollar bill and says he does not like to tip. Dekker swaps the ten for a twenty of his own. A TV camera caught a shot of one of the criminals, who is arrested together with his girlfriend at her home, where banknotes are found with a scent used to mark evidence collected by the police. The banknote serial numbers did not come from that day's robbery, but had been placed in police storage and signed out two weeks earlier by Callo. He is found shot dead in his home, together with incriminating evidence linking him to the heist.  When reviewing video footage from the bank, Dekker notices one corner of the bank is deliberately shielded from view. In that corner, they find the bank regional manager's computer. Fingerprints on the keyboard reveal the identity of a hacker that Conners himself had arrested, but whose conviction was overturned after the shooting on the bridge. Conners and Dekker want to question the hacker, but he is shot dead by Lorenz, and a gunfight ensues, during which Lorenz manages to escape. Dekker questions the hospitalized bank robber identified in the news footage and finally breaks him when he casually explains the impact of a massive overdose of morphine while slowly injecting something into the suspect's drip. An amazed Conners watches and later calls him a hypocrite. Dekker responds by explaining he only injected more saline solution.  The suspect reveals Lorenz is Scott Curtis, the brother of John shot earlier, and Conners leads a stakeout at an address where all the gang are to meet that night; Scott's house. Forced to go before Scott arrives, a shootout results in both suspects' deaths, and a bomb blows up the building while Conners is inside. Dekker is devastated but realizes that Callo's signature requesting material from the evidence storage was forged by the evidence custody officer, who reveals that Scott is actually York. In a flashback, York stands on the bridge and fires the first shot, killing the hostage in the opening sequence. Tracking Lorenz/York's mobile phone, Dekker surprises York at a diner, and York takes a woman hostage in a reversal of the standoff on the bridge. Dekker chases and eventually kills York.  When Dekker pays for his coffee at the diner, he discovers the banknote Conners used to pay for lunch with is also scented, which means Conners was also involved in taking the money from police evidence. Dekker finds a copy of [[James Gleick]]'s ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'' in Conners' house, showing he had faked an earlier ignorance of the mathematics. On a hunch, Dekker looks for airplane tickets booked in Gleick's name and runs to the airport.  During a mobile call between the now disguised Conners and the searching Dekker at the busy airport, flashbacks reveal how the seemingly unconnected events in the film form a pattern, just as predicted in chaos theory. Conners reveals that he placed his badge on Scott's corpse before the explosion. Conners and York recruited a group of ex-convicts from their past. Callo was framed for being a dirty cop. Conners ends the call, walks casually to a private jet, and takes off while sipping champagne.

The scene is played back-to-back with the bar scene and an action scene of the trio. Meg alerts the other two of a suspicious character entering the bar, who they find had a [[pocket knife]].  Later, as the women are getting [[massage]]s, Goro gives the trio a job order by a woman named Mari, played by [[Mari Hoshino]], who believes her fiance, M.

When the P.I rejected her, not believing her boyfriend to be having an affair, Goro overheard and offered her information and a job opportunity.  Afterwards, Kumi sees Mari and Takeda out in public together and Meg is curious as to why Takeda, Hotta's vice president, would take Mari to Hotta's office. After the trio discover Mari and Takeda are trying take over the company, they talk to Hotta, who asks them to find the truth to save his company. When they break into Hotta's office, they find Takeda and Mari. Mari tries to escape, but Yu stops her and mocks the fact that Mari thought her manipulation would work. The trio fight Takeda and, after he falls, Mari places herself over him to protect him. She explains that, as Hotta's company grew, Takeda was pushed off to the side, so she tried to frame Hotta as having multiple lovers so he would have to give up the company due to bad publicity. Kumi tells her that, by manipulating both Hotta and Takeda, she is hurting Takeda and it would be best to tell the truth.  The trio returns to running their bar and Goro congratulates them on a job well done. After they say goodbye, the trio talk about the job and Goro.

Cinderella (2006 film)
 A figure carries a birthday cake into a room but drops it in shock as another unknown person commits suicide by hanging herself.  Su-kyoung is lying on an operating table ready to undergo plastic surgery. She is extremely nervous and is being comforted by her friend Hyeon-su, whose parents are divorced. Hyeon-su leaves and talks to her mother Yoon-hee, a successful and talented plastic surgeon. The two have a good mother-daughter relationship. Meanwhile, Su-kyoung is panicking alone in the operating room. She sees a frightening image of a girl in a dark blue dress and long dark hair. Yoon-hee begins the surgery, telling Su-kyoung that it is time to become pretty. A day later, on Hyeon-su's birthday, she argues with her mother about where to have the party and finally decides to do it in her home.  Hyeon-su is later in her art class, making a sculpture of Su-kyoung's face. Many girls in the class comment saying that Su-kyoung looks much more attractive than she did before. Hyeon-su accidentally cuts into the face of her sculpture and a large cut subsequently appears on Su-kyoung's cheek. She screams and flees in terror. A mysterious voice shrieks at her saying she wants her face back. Su-kyoung's cut and blood later vanish. Hye-won, another friend, decides to get an eye job from Yoon-hee.  Meanwhile, Hyeon-su, Jae-hui and Su-kyoung wait at a bus stop while an old woman gives out fliers for her missing granddaughter. Su-kyoung is distant, troubled by earlier events. The bus arrives but Hyeon-su waits for her friend Sung-eon to come. Jae-hui shows instant dislike for Sung-eon, who is tomboyish and closer to Hyeon-su than her other friends: she also hasn't undergone plastic surgery.  The girls all celebrate Hyeon-su's party and Su-kyoung gives her an expensive doll for a present. When lighting the cake, the same ghost girl that Su-kyoung saw appears next to Hyeon-su, but no one else can see her except Su-kyoung. The candles go out. In a hasty panic, Su-kyoung gets in the way of the cake (which was to be thrown at Hyeon-su) and then goes to the bathroom to wash her face. Su-kyoung admires her face for a second before she sees her face shredded in the reflection. She screams and runs from Hyeon-su's house.  Later the two girls look through a photo album and laugh about what they used to look like. Hyeon-su then tells Sung-eon that she has no childhood pictures. Yoon-hee listens through the door and then walks away.  Su-kyoung meanwhile has locked herself inside her room for days and refuses to see anyone. Her mother calls Yoon-hee and Hyeon-su to come and help. Su-kyoung lets Hyeon-su in and she tells her that there is something wrong with her face and that she can't help wanting to mess it up. Su-kyoung hears a voice say "pretty" and fearfully forces Hyeon-su out. The ghost girl appears and evilly says "I'll make you pretty." Su-kyoung's face begins to violently cut open. Hyeon-su and the other women manage to enter the room after Su-kyoung's screaming stops. Hyeon-su finds the dead Su-kyoung face down and flips her onto her back, revealing her face, now cut off on one side.   During art class the next day, Hye-won blames Hyeon-su for Su-kyoung's death. Hye-won has had surgery from Yoon-hee. At their home Yoon-hee discovers that Hyeon-su is into Vivaldi and has been calling her father. Later Yoon-hee gives Hyeon-su a facial. While Hyeon-su sleeps a pair of hands begin to caress her face before trying to gouge out her eyes. Hyeon-su panics and tears off the face mask, sees no one with her and her mother then comes to comfort her. Her mother places her face mask in a box.  Hyeon-su then goes into the basement where she was told never to go there as a child. She finds a picture of a child with a severely burnt face and the words, Hyeon-su before surgery. The girl with long hair has been watching Hyeon-su but vanishes when her mother comes down and scolds her. Hyeon-su then becomes distant and refuses to speak to her mother properly. Hyeon-su then leaves the house to see her father. Yoon-hee follows.  As Hyeon-su talks to her father, Yoon-hee has a flashback. Many years before, she tells Hyeon-su to wait in the car while she delivers a file to her husband. She promises a trip to the park for Hyeon-su. As Yoon-hee leaves, the car's engine begins to smoke. Yoon-hee finds her husband and a woman engaging in oral sex, hits him, and leaves. The car's engine explodes, horribly burning Hyeon-su and leaving her comatose. Yoon-hee weeps over her disfigured daughter. She then later visits a church and a little orphaned girl grows attached to her, addressing her as mommy.        The Orphaned Girl loves Yoon-hee very much and the two are shown to have a loving mother-daughter relationship. Yoon-hee's husband then goes to the hospital to find Hyeon-su missing.  Back in present day, Yoon-hee confronts her ex-husband and tells him that he has no right to see Hyeon-su. Her ex-husband then argues saying that she isn't Hyeon-su and that she is the Orphaned Girl. As Yoon-hee leaves, Hyeon-su tearfully says "Mom" and hugs her.  Yoon-hee takes her home and tells her to have a bath. The doorbell rings and Yoon-hee goes to see who it is, horrified to find out it is Hyeon-su ringing the doorbell. As she lets Hyeon-su in, the two get into an argument in which Hyeon-su tells her that she isn't her real mother which causes Yoon-hee to slap her. As Hyeon-su locks herself in her room, Yoon-hee notices the floor is soaking wet and then hears the tap in the bathroom running. The bath is overflowing. Footsteps leave the bathroom and head towards Hyeon-su's room. Hyeon-su's door opens on its own and as Hyeon-su checks it out and sees her mother walk down the far end of the corridor, her bed suddenly becomes wet. Hyeon-su sits on it, notices the wetness and finds a tangled bunch of wet long hairs on her back and screams. She pulls back the covers to reveal the girl in the blue dress lying soaking wet under the sheets. She screams again and the girl disappears.  The next day Hyeon-su shows the picture of the missing girl from the old woman to Sung-eon and then shows her a photo given to her by her father. Sung-eon notices that they look very similar but have different eye colors.  Meanwhile, Jae-hui and Hye-won are painting self-portraits. Hye-won goes to the toilet while Jae-hui washes her paint brush. She notices it gets stuck in the middle of the bucket of paint-water. As she inspects it a hand shoots out of the bucket and forcefully pulls her head into the bucket by grabbing her face. Jae-hui accidentally tears her picture. Sung-eon gets a call from Hyeon-su's mom. Hye-won returns and is shocked to see the painting ripped and scratches on Jae-hui's face, who now seems to be almost catatonic and in a trance-like state. Next we see the two girls sitting face to face and smiling in a possessed way as they draw lines on their faces, telling each other which parts of their faces need improving. They then lift up two scalpels and begin to slowly cut each other's faces up, both uttering "I'll make you pretty" at the same time, with their feet in the bucket. Hyeon-su and Sung-eon both enter the room to find both of the girls soaked in blood with shredded faces, smiling at the two of them.  The ambulances come and the paramedics carry Jae-hui's and Hye-won's bodies away. Sung-eon is taken downtown to answer questions about the two girls.  Yoon-hee comes to the scene of the crime and leaves with "Hyeon-su". The real Hyeon-su returns home and her mother locks her in the basement.  Yoon-hee puts what she believes to be Hyeon-su to bed and leaves her room before she has another flashback. Hyeon-su, still with her face burned off, begins to show signs of improvement and Yoon-hee then performs an operation. Yoon-hee then removes the girl's oxygen mask but cannot bring herself to kill her and then quickly gives it back as she sobs with guilt-ridden sadness for her "daughter"; the faceless girl lovingly strokes her mom's hand. Later, the little faceless girl (head wrapped in bandages) watches the other girl play with a friend (Sung-eon?) outside and she comments on how pretty she is. Yoon-hee tells her that she is "way prettier" but the little Faceless Girl accuses her mother of liking the other girl better. Yoon-hee then lovingly tells the Faceless Girl that she will make her a new face. Unfortunately Yoon-hee didn't fully keep her promise, and only made the girl very realistic masks of her daughter's face (the face mask seen earlier in the film was used). The Faceless Girl (now in her late teens) sneaks out of the basement and witnesses Hyeon-su's birthday party with all of the friends who would later have surgery. Yoon-hee then hastily leaves the room and locks her back in the basement. The Faceless Girl screams, begging for a birthday party and a pretty face as Yoon-hee breaks into tears on the other side of the door.     Later in the day, Yoon-hee prepares a cake (the beginning of the film) and takes it to her, finding out that she has hung herself.  Hyeon-su then discovers the girl's room and explores finding a cupboard filled with the masks she wore over the years and a diary filled with sadness and hate towards Hyeon-su and her friends. Hyeon-su then discovers a fridge-like device which Yoon-hee kept the Faceless Girl's body in after her death. Sung-eon, now free of the police visits Hyeon-su's house and breaks in, unlocking the basement door and the two separate to search for Yoon-hee. Sung-eon then sees what she believes to be Hyeon-su but it is actually the Faceless Girl who shocks Sung-eon to fainting by pulling her own face off like a mask. Hyeon-su finds the unconscious Sung-eon; her mother then appears and drugs her.  Hyeon-su lies on an operating table next to the corpse of the Faceless Girl, who is wearing a mask that resembles Hyeon-su's face. Yoon-hee removes the mask, revealing the faceless girl's gruesome visage properly for the first time. Hyeon-su begins to panic, but she can't move because of the drugs. Yoon-hee tells Hyeon-su it's time to give her face back and begins to operate with a scalpel but stops when she remembers how much she loved her. Yoon-hee collapses to the floor in grief but the corpse of the faceless girl gets up and tries to cut off Hyeon-su's face screaming "I want my face back!". Yoon-hee stops her, telling her that she's her precious daughter and that she's sorry for all she did to her. The ghastly faceless corpse reverts into the child she once was. The Faceless Girl was The Orphaned Girl all along, not the real Hyeon-su, and the operation had been a face swap. Yoon-hee had cut off the Orphaned Girl's face and had given it to Hyeon-su. Yoon-hee then repents for her sins and leaves with the Orphaned Girl to go onto the Afterlife. However, the final scene shows the Orphaned Girl, back in her faceless long-haired form suddenly appearing by Hyeon-su's bed with her hands reaching out before the credits roll, perhaps meaning that she was not yet satisfied and still wanting her face back.

 Ex-gangster Wang-jae ([[Ahn Gil-kang]]) chases a gang of punks into an alley where he's fatally stabbed. His four childhood friends reunite, first time in nearly twenty years, at Wang-jae's funeral.  Up to then, each has gone their own way: Tae-su ([[Jung Doo-hong]]) became a Seoul police detective. Pil-ho's ([[Lee Beom-soo]]) taken over his brother-in-law Wang-jae's throne as a mobster. Seok-hwan (''City of Violence'' director [[Ryoo Seung-wan]]) who works as a debt collector while his older brother Dong-hwan struggles as a math teacher. A flashback reveals a pact they made on School Picnic Day before they fought with other youths. After the funeral, Tae-su decides to investigate the murder within a week before he would return to his job in Seoul. Meanwhile, Seok-hwan decides to find and kill Wang-jae's murderers.  While investigating, Tae-su is attacked by youth gangs, who use an array of weapons including baseball bats, hip hop, bikes, [[hockey stick]]s, and [[yo-yo]]'s. Tae-su barely escapes with his life after Seok-hwan's unexpected arrival. They decide to work together. After hunting the gangs, they discover Wang-jae's death isn't a random mindless attack. It was a planned murder. The revelation leads them to Seok-hwan's own brother, who confesses a secret. It's Pil-ho who was behind the plan, which was hatched after Wang-jae disapproved Pil-ho's plans to turn their city into a tourist district.  After strangers tried to kill him as part of tying up Pil-ho's loose ends, Wang-jae's young murderer agrees to testify against Pil-ho. A killer douses the young murderer in gasoline and sets him on fire. When Tae-su realizes there's no legal way to take Pil-ho down, he confronts Pil-ho, but he ends up badly beaten. Meanwhile, Seok-hwan, Dong-hwan and their mother are on their way to a restaurant when a truck smashes into their car. After Dong-hwan and his mother's funeral, Seok-hwan and Wang-jae's widow leave the funeral house and sees Tae-su waiting outside. Tae-su persuades Wang-jae's widow into revealing information on her brother Pil-ho's whereabouts.  No longer bound by law, Tae-su and Seok-hwan storm Pil-ho's fortress where they fight their way through swarms of armed cooks and bodyguards until the banquet room. They witness Pil-ho killing a Seoul president, which prompts all guests to leave just Tae-su, Seok-hwan, Pil-ho and his four elite guards alone in the room. The elite guards immediately take Tae-su and Seok-hwan on.  Two men, victorious but exhausted, set to take on Pil-ho, but Pil-ho takes them by surprise by attacking Seok-hwan, who loses his fingers. Pil-ho turns and stabs Tae-su's stomach, ignoring Seok-hwan who's binding the katana to his hand with torn table cloth. Tae-su informs Pil-ho that the last man who stands last wins. Before Pil-ho could react, Seok-hwan stabs him through the chest, killing him.  As Tae-su bleeds to death, he recalls the day he and his childhood friends walk home from the School Picnic, talking about future. Seok-hwan says they didn't win, but his older brother Dong-hwan says they did. Seok-hwan insists they have nothing to show for it. Wang-jae disagrees, pointing out they have the snake tonic. They will drink it in twenty years' time when they become rich men. One wonder what would happen if it didn't work out. "Doesn't matter," Wang-jae says. "We won't amount to much, anyway!"  Back at Pil-ho's place, the exhausted Seok-hwan glances around, noting the carnage he and his late friend Tae-su had created, and sighs heavily. Finally he says, "Fuck it."  
City of Rott
 The story begins after the Earth's water supply has been infected by a strange [[parasite]] known as Rot Worms. Rot Worm eggs were delivered by rain, and there's no place on the planet that is free from the worms. Once hatched, they begin feasting on human flesh, turning their hosts into mindless zombies.  The film revolves around Fred, an elderly man with a [[Walker (mobility)|walker]], which he uses as a weapon. Fred appears to be losing his mind, believing his walker speaks to him as he travels through an infested city on a quest for a new pair of shoes.  While searching a mall for the shoes, Fred encounters a recently bitten nurse. With no knowledge of a cure for the infection, the nurse quickly becomes a zombie, forcing Fred to flee the mall. Outside, he meets Jon, a skilled shooter who decides to help Fred escape the city. However, Fred loses his walker in an ensuing scuffle with zombies, where it gets taken from him by the nurse. Unwilling to abandon his closest friend (even as his slippers assume the role of inanimate speaking object), Fred abandons Jon by stealing a motorcycle.  The motorcycle runs out of gas on a bridge, leading Fred to be surrounded on both sides by zombies. Fortunately, he manages to recover his walker from the nurse and kill numerous zombies, though he is unable to finish off the nurse herself. After fighting his way through the hoard of undead, Fred rescues another survivor, an old man carrying a bottle of prune juice. However, the man flees from Fred.  Deciding to rest on a park bench, Fred discovers a newspaper detailing a new type of parasite known as Brain Worms, which eat any intake of food and eventually eat the brain of their host. As becomes evident from the symptoms of partial memory loss, rapid age progression, hallucinations, and hearing voices, Fred has already been infected by one. Unfortunately, the blood which got on him during the fight on the bridge contains Rot Worms, which quickly overpower the lesser Brain Worms, turning him into a zombie.  The next day, Jon, who was unknowingly infected with a Brain Worm when Fred patted him on the back, discovers the now infected Fred. Jon attempts to kill him, but is surrounded and eaten by the zombies.  Eight days later, a man named Benjamin has begun to look for his wife in the city with his two sons and another man named Larry, the four using a van to store goods. While Benjamin has one of his sons pick up doughnuts, Larry gets attacked by the undead, then accidentally shot by the other son. Afterwards, it is revealed that the nurse was Benjamin's wife and she left the group in an attempt to help others. Benjamin tries to bring her back despite her infection, but is attacked and killed, while another zombie decapitates his wife.  A man named Hac is sent by his bitten friend Mac to find an antidote. Mac has begun to believe that the old man carries the cure in his bottle of prune juice. Though both Hac and Mac die before learning the truth, Mac's belief turns out to be correct. The bottle carries an antidote known as "Zombifate", which the old man constantly consumes. Fred catches up to the old man, who orders him to resist the worms' influence. Fred manages to temporarily overcome the infection and save the old man from zombies, but the man dies of a sudden heart attack. Fred tries to cure himself with Zombifate, but worm inside him refuses to accept the medicine. Then Fred begins to feast on old man's corpse consuming so much flesh that the Zombifate inside the old man's body forces the Rot Worms out of him, allowing Fred to ultimately cure himself and get to some safer position (outright stated in City of Rott 2 preview).  After the film's credits, a man who trapped himself inside a box laughs about surviving the zombies, but has been infected by a Brain Worm.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'' [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=352824 review] at [[Allmovie]] 2005</ref>  
Citizen Duane
 Duane Balfour ([[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]]) was born into a family of misfortune, in the prairie town of Ridgeburg. After losing a high school election against his enemy Chad, he decides to run for [[mayor]] against Chad's grandmother&mdash;Ridgeburg's Mayor Milton ([[Rosemary Dunsmore]]), who has been the [[incumbent]] for a ridiculously long time.  Duane and a [[homeless]] man are the only two competing with Mayor Milton.  Duane has a long-standing resentment against Milton because she approved his father's shooting by the police.  His father had become violent while trying, without success, to warn Milton and the townsfolk that the town's namesake ridge would soon collapse due to heavy [[mining]] and insect tunneling.  With the support of his brother Maurie ([[Devon Bostick]]) Duane tries, and fails, to win the election. After withdrawing from the race he and his uncle ([[Donal Logue]]) drive back to Duane's house from Ridgeburg's ridge. The camera pans down underground, showing an insect removing a rock from a tunnel under the ridge. This triggers a landslide, leading to the implosion of the ridge, which Duane and his uncle see from the back of their truck. The next morning, prior to the election results being announced, it is revealed Mayor Milton has had a [[heart attack]] after seeing the ridge collapse, presumably since she realized that Duane's father was right all along.  Later in the day it is announced that the homeless man has become mayor with three votes, Milton's votes being deemed invalid and Duane having dropped out of the election.

Randal encourages Dante to leave Mooby's in search for Becky, and in the meantime, sets up a surprise going away party for Dante. Randal hires "Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud," a [[donkey show]] with a [[fog machine]]. When Dante comes back, he mistakes the fog for a fire and calls the fire department, but upon discovering that it is not a fire, he proceeds to watch the show with Randal, Jay, Silent Bob, and Elias. The group soon discovers that "Kinky Kelly" is, in fact, the donkey, while the man ([[Zak Charles Knutson|Zak Knutson]]), whom Randal thought to be the [[pimp]], is "The Sexy Stud". When Becky returns, Dante confesses his love for her. As they kiss, Emma arrives. She throws her engagement ring at Becky, dumps a cake she'd made for Dante over his head, and angrily walks off.  The fire and police departments soon arrive and discover the show. Dante, Randal, Elias, Jay, Silent Bob, and The Sexy Stud are detained and jailed. Although they are informed they will soon be released, Dante blames Randal for ruining his life and expresses his eagerness to start a new life without Randal, while Randal condemns Dante for his willingness to live his life under the standards of others and for walking out of their friendship. Amid the argument, Randal proposes that they buy the Quick Stop and re-open it, although Dante says that neither have the money to purchase the store. Jay and Silent Bob offer to lend them some money (from the royalties they collected following the events of ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'') on the condition that they can hangout outside of the Quick Stop anytime they want without calling the police. Randal accepts their offer, but Dante remains skeptical, prompting Randal to emotionally confess his fear of losing Dante. As a result, Dante agrees to the proposition as well, and after his release, he proposes to Becky, who accepts. After the Quick Stop and RST Video are rebuilt, Elias applies for a job and is hired at RST Video. In the very last scene, with the store open, Dante says, "Can you feel it? Today is the first day of the rest of our lives." The camera slowly zooms out, showing the newly rebuilt store and the scene turns black-and-white, while a woman checks through the milk jugs to find one with the furthest expiration date.  
Click (2006 film)
  Michael Newman is a hardworking architect, married to his longtime sweetheart Donna Newman with two children, Ben and Samantha. Michael is easily pushed around by his overbearing boss, John Ammer, and often chooses work over family.  Michael visits the retail store [[Bed Bath & Beyond]] to buy a [[universal remote control]] for his home. He stumbles around the various departments before falling onto a bed, and sees a section titled "Beyond". A man named Morty offers Michael a free remote, but warns it can never be returned.  Learning to use the remote, Michael finds that it can control reality much like a television, able to pause, rewind to events in his past, or fast-forward in time. He uses it to fast-forward past illness and arguments with Donna. Morty tells Michael that during these times, his body is on "auto-pilot", going through his motions of everyday life while his mind skips ahead.  Michael is unable to buy promised bicycles for his children, but knowing that Ammer plans to promote him to a partnership, he uses the remote to skip to the promotion. He is shocked to find that a year has passed. During that time, he and Donna have entered marriage counseling, his children have grown up with different tastes, and learns that Sundance, the family dog, had died. The remote, having learned his preferences, starts time-skipping in response to casual wishes Michael makes. Michael attempts to get rid of the remote or destroy it, but the remote reappears in his hands shortly after each attempt.  At work, Ammer tells Michael he plans on retiring, which would make Michael the CEO. Michael momentarily forgets about the remote, and tells Ammer he wishes he were CEO. The remote fast-forwards ten years into the future where Michael is now CEO. While Michael is wealthy and well-off, he has become morbidly obese, Donna has divorced him, and both Ben and Samantha have become moody teenagers. He argues with Donna and new husband Bill, which brings their family dog to jump atop Michael, knocking him into a coma. The remote time-skips several years to when Michael wakes from the coma, and is no longer obese. Ben is now a partner of the firm, and Michael's father Ted has died.  Morty reappears and tells Michael he is the [[Death (personification)|Angel of Death]]. Michael asks to go to a "good place", whereupon the remote fast-forwards him several more years in the future to Ben's wedding. Michael has a second heart attack when Samantha calls Bill her dad. When he wakes in the hospital later that day, he finds his family there, including Ben. Ben had decided to skip his honeymoon to help fix some issues with the firm, but Michael implores him not to ignore his wife. As Ben and Samantha leave for the airport, Michael tries to follow but collapses again and dies, telling his family that he still loves them. Morty appears to take Michael.  Michael wakes back up in the bed at Bed Bath & Beyond, in his original present. Michael realizes it was all a dream and got a second chance. He races home to rejoin his family. There he sees the remote on the counter with a note from Morty, reading "Good guys need a break". Michael considers the remote for a moment before throwing it away; it does not reappear. Michael joins his family in a pillow fight.

Tonny's wife, Tanja (Ellen Hillingso), grew humiliated and promptly divorced him, but Tonny luckily managed to swing occasional custody of his two children. On one of their prized afternoons together, Tonny and the kids hearken off to see the new Harry Potter movie, but run headfirst into the discouraging news that the film is sold out. With only one other option available to them at the cinema, the three must endure a thoroughly miserable afternoon at an über-pretentious experimental Danish film called "The Murderer," directed by the snotty passive aggressive artiste director Claus Volter (Nikolaj Lie Kaas). Frustrated, Tonny smashes a display case in the cinema lobby (and barely manages to escape re-incarceration for it), this leads him to lose his custodial session with his children's. Hence he decides to track Volter down for a refund of their cost for seeing the film. Tom finds Volter in a film set shooting final film of the trilogy. Volter pushes Tom in a frantic response, and lands on a litigation. Tom only asks for his money spend for seeing Volter's early film and wants to be the co-writer and co-director of Volter's new film. Volter finds this as disrupting his "artistic" expression, but compromises for his Producer (Kristian Halken). Tom with help of his love (Line Kruse) re-writes the whole script with the intention of making something enjoyable for him and his children. Volter tries to bring artistic interpretation to the film, but Tom, the producer and the lead actress (Mille Dinesen) dislikes it and follows Tom's way of commercial filming. Volter removes his name from the film and botches the editing of the film. The film appears to be jaunty and disconnected, but the critics love it and gives maximum rating. Volter finds the paradox in this and gives money to Tom as a debt he is paying for watching his previous film. Tom finally as any artist finds his film not as good as he expected and goes out with his love to see a decent film and plans to lead a quiet life.

The group are driving in their car towards Jotunheimen. When they arrive, they climb the first mountain and are stunned by the magnificent view.

They treat it the best they can but realize they can't care for it properly out in the wilderness. They spot a hotel, and decide to seek help there.

The Cloud (film)
 Due to a malfunction in the fictitious nuclear power plant Markt Ebersberg near Schweinfurt, an [[Design basis accident|MCA]] occurs and the whole area is evacuated extensively by the [[emergency management]]. Hannah's school is also located in the affected area. She has to take care of her younger brother on this day, since the mother is in Schweinfurt because of business matters; exactly where the disaster has occurred. Since there is no other way to get home to the East Hessian town of Schlitz, where her little brother Uli is already waiting for her, Hannah accepts the offer of her classmate Lars and lets herself be driven home by him and his friends. During the trip, the teenagers learn about the events on the radio, but they do not really understand - until they arrive in Schlitz, where Lars' mother drags him out of the car and tells the others that her son can not take them with him because he has to flee with his family. Hannah finally goes home on foot, where Uli is already waiting for her. Since their mother is at a cosmetics congress, the two children are on their own. As recommended by the emergency management, the children want to go to the cellar for protection, while all neighbors are already fleeing. There, Hannah wants to wait for Elmar with her younger brother, a schoolmate from whom she got a kiss shortly before the alarm and who has promised her help in the escape. In the midst of the panic, the two finally receive a call from their mother: she does not want the children to go to the cellar, because the radiation reaches them there, but flee to Bad Hersfeld with the neighbors, from where they take the train to Aunt Helga in Hamburg. But since all the neighbors have already fled and Elmar has not appeared (he grappels with the car at home, wants to [[Hot-wiring|hot-wire]] it because he can not find the car keys of his parents), the children decide to go to Bad Hersfeld by bike alone. On the way there, Uli is killed in a [[hit-and-run]]. A little later, a family with several children takes Hannah to the Bad Hersfeld station after the family father places Uli's body in a near corn field. Since the motorways are crowded, many others want to flee with the trains, so Hannah has to pay attention to the little daughters of the family on the platform, since the parents still have to fight their way through. Hannah however discovers her friend Elmar in the midst of the human masses and runs in his direction - but does not reach him. The couple who took Hannah to know where their children were, who she left behind in search of Elmar, but because she is still in a state of shock, she does not reply. While the father finally finds the children, Hannah leaves the train station as if in a trance, and enters the emptied station forecourt, where a few seconds later, the [[cloud burst]] happens. Hannah walks into the [[fallout]] and collapses shortly afterwards. She wakes up in a hospital near Hamburg. Beside her is Ayşe, a girl of the same age, with whom she makes friends. Hannah feels tired and sick; shortly afterwards she suffers from hair loss. A little later, Elmar comes to the hospital because he has found Hannah in a tracing file and wants to see her. Elmar is also contaminated, but his health is apparently much better than Hannah's. A month later, Aunt Helga comes to pick up Hannah. She tells her that her mother is dead, and not missed, like she'd been told in the hospital all the time. In Hamburg, where Aunt Helga lives, Hannah goes back to school, but remains isolated there because her radiation damage is too obvious because of her baldness and the people avoid her. Only Elmar, whose family also escaped to Hamburg, keeps to her. Elmar's parents want to go to America with their son, but he refuses because he thinks he has no chance and soon dies of the radiation. He lets himself be admitted to the hospital, like Hannah finds out from Ayşe, who is also treated there. Hannah wants to see her friend; she finds him just at the moment he wants to commit suicide, but can stop him at the last minute. When the (least-radiated) Zone 3, in which Hannah's hometown is located, is opened, she goes there with Elmar, mainly to bury her brother. After they have buried Uli in the corn field, the two continue the journey to Schlitz. Elmar says he feels a fluff on Hannah's bald head, and Hannah sticks her head out of the sun-roof of the car "to let her hair fly in the wind".  
Color of the Cross
 In what would later become the last 48 hours of his life, [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (Jean-Claude La Marre), a Black man, leads a group of 12 disciples to the biblical city of [[Arimathea]] to celebrate the Jewish holiday of [[Passover]]. The city of Arimathea is governed by the elite Jewish [[Sanhedrin]] under the administrative jurisdiction of the [[Roman Empire]] who persecute and discriminate against the Jewish population. Growing weary of the popular influence displayed by Jesus, a Jew claiming to be a messiah, the Sanhedrin wish to call an emergency meeting to discuss his growing power and clout. From the Sanhedrin, some of the members find it hard to believe a black man although Jewish, could in fact be the messiah. The members attempt to formulate a plan to capture and interrogate Jesus over his alleged blasphemy. Meanwhile, Jesus with the help of his disciple John ([[Akiva David]]), discovers a safe dwelling in Arimathea to consume the Passover meal away from the watchful patrol of Roman soldiers who are also attempting to subdue him over his reputation. Accordingly, Mary ([[Debbi Morgan]]), the mother of Jesus, comes to believe her son is being individually singled out on motivations based on race. In addition to persecuting Jews in general, the Romans also view Jews who are black in skin color as a more troublesome ramification than just ordinary white Jews.  After a trek through the wilderness in the province of Judea, Jesus and his followers arrive in Arimathea. During the passover meal at a secret location within a Jewish guest home, Jesus reveals a vision which he experienced from God; depicting one of his disciples will betray him and hand him over to the Romans as a blasphemous criminal against the Empire. After hearing of the so-called miracles which Jesus performed, such as the healing of a blind man, and the restoring of life to a dead person, Caiphas ([[Elya Baskin]]), the leader of the Sanhedrin remains unconvinced of Jesus' prowess. The Sanhedrin believe that Jesus may in fact be a prophet like other Jews in the past, but do not believe he is a messiah. Later, Judas Iscariot ([[Johann John Jean]]), one of Jesus' followers, betrays him for a payment of 30 pieces of silver by revealing his hiding place from the Romans to Caiphas. Against the wishes of his fellow members in not involving the Romans into the matter, Caiphas recruits a group of Roman soldiers led by Horatius (David Gianopoulos), to capture Jesus. Earlier, Jesus along with his disciples left the Jewish guest home to seek refuge in the [[Gethsemane|Garden of Gethsemane]] within the mountains of Judea. Following his capture with the aid of Judas, Horatius leads Jesus away to a presumed trial before the Romans. Jesus is later condemned to death and crucified.

The Colonel (2006 film)
 France, 1993. The retired Colonel Raoul Duplan is shot in his home. As the police are baffled, young army officer Galois is brought to help the investigation. Shortly thereafter she receives a letter containing some diary pages of a lieutenant Guy Rossi who served in 1955 in the Algerian war under the command of Duplan and disappeared in 1957 under mysterious circumstances. Every day Galois receives a continuation of the diary in which Rossi describes in detail his ambivalent relationship to Duplan and his dirty methods. As she reads the diary the film flashes back to black-and-white scenes of Rossis' experiences.  Rossi witness torture and public executions, and finds himself torn between wanting peace and disgust at the brutal methods being employed to secure it.  Rossi inadvertently reveals information to a friend sympathetic to the rebels which may have led to the murder of a shopkeeper who was providing information to the French army.  Ordered by Duplan to command a firing squad, he resolves to disobey his superior's orders.  It is revealed he left the diary with the friend with the intended final recipient being his father because he feared for his life.  A recent appearance on TV of Col. Duplan prompted his friend to finally deliver the letter to Rossis' father, who, when confronted by Galois readily reveals he has been the one sending the diary and that he committed the murder because Duplan expressed no remorse for his son's murder, Duplan justifying himself by saying Rossi was a traitor.  The film ends somewhat ambiguously as Galois, as an army officer, lacks the authority to arrest the elder Rossi, and while driving back from the interview, seems moved by the experience and decides to get lunch with her commanding officer instead of immediately returning to the office.  
Confetti (2006 film)
 The prestigious bridal [[magazine]] ''[[Confetti]]'', owned by the arrogant, suave Antoni Clarke ([[Jimmy Carr]]) and managed by the long-suffering, uptight chief editor Vivienne ([[Felicity Montagu]]) is holding a competition to see who can hold the most original [[wedding]], with the winners being presented with a new house and a [[cover shoot]] for the magazine. Three couples and their proposals are selected to participate: Sam and Matt ([[Jessica Stevenson]] and [[Martin Freeman]]), a [[middle class]] couple of old-fashioned romantics who have elected to hold their wedding in the style of [[Busby Berkeley]] musicals of the 1930s and 1940s, despite the fact that Sam can barely hold a tune; Isabelle and Josef ([[Meredith MacNeill]] and [[Stephen Mangan]]), a pair of hyper-competitive professional [[tennis]] players holding a tennis-themed wedding; and Joanna and Michael ([[Olivia Colman]] and [[Robert Webb (actor)|Robert Webb]]), a [[naturist]] couple who intend to hold their wedding entirely [[Nudism|naked]]. All three weddings are planned using the services of Gregory and Archie ([[Vincent Franklin]] and [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]]), wedding planners and partners in both business and love.  The film follows their planning, and the various crises that each couple faces over the three-month planning period. As well as learning to sing and dance, Sam and Matt must contend with Sam's dominating mother ([[Alison Steadman]]) and attention-seeking sister ([[Sarah Hadland]]), who appear intent on hijacking the proceedings and constantly browbeat and undermine the shy and easily  cowed Sam (such as preventing her from inviting her beloved but estranged father), much to Matt's growing irritation. The couple must also deal with Matt's oldest friend and [[best man]] Snoopy ([[Marc Wootton]]), a musician who nurses a bitter resentment towards Sam for coming between him and Matt that he expresses in not-so-subtle lyrics that he intends to sing at the wedding. Despite the constant support and encouragement the couple receive from Archie and Gregory, the gradual tension eventually builds to a bitter argument between Matt and Sam's mother and sister which sees him kicked out of the house where he is staying with them; this prompts Sam, however, to finally stand up for herself and put her mother and sister in place.  Isabelle and Josef, meanwhile, are intensely determined to win, owing to unexplained financial difficulties. Suspicious and competitive, they become increasingly paranoid that the competition is being 'fixed' against them in favour of Matt and Sam, eventually resorting to the extreme measure of having Isabelle's nose – and her extremely large nostrils – altered by plastic surgery (with the result being that the nose she ends up with is much longer than her original one). In the process, however, they find themselves combatting their own anxieties; Josef, in particular, finds himself confronting his jealousy over Isabelle's friendship with their tennis coach, Jesus, and insecurity over his largely finished tennis career and that he will not be able to be a worthy husband to Isabelle. Joanna and Michael, however, find their plans challenged at every turn by Vivienne, who has no intention of putting a naked couple on the front of the magazine should they win. Michael, an experienced naturist, angrily resists Vivienne's efforts to make him dress up for the wedding, but Joanna, a recent convert and still insecure about revealing her body to strangers, finds herself of mixed minds about the issue. The pressure of the magazine and the tension between the two becomes so great that it briefly looks like the marriage will not even take place at all.  The big day finally arrives, amid much jitters and anxiety on all sides. All three weddings go off largely without a hitch, although Michael and Joanna raise eyebrows when, in defiance of Vivienne's rulings, they bare all (literally) in their wedding service. The winners are soon decided – Matt and Sam, which prompts a display of sour grapes on part of Josef and Isabelle. The movie then briefly glimpses at the three couples a few months later, all of whom are adjusting to married life relatively happily.

Widower Ray Keene ([[John Cusack]]), a high school gym teacher, ex-cop, and well-intentioned but not very able dad to Chris (Jamie Anderson), belatedly realizes the need to bond with his son when the latter gets caught smoking [[marijuana]], and takes him hiking in the wilderness. Carden is being driven through that same wilderness by the marshals, but his men stage a rescue attempt. Most of the marshals end up dead; the car crashed and the surviving marshal asks Keene to take the prisoner to the authorities and then dies of his injuries. Ray and Chris have to get Carden out of the wilderness and hand him over to the authorities. Carden's men, highly skilled ex-military thugs, track them down to rescue Carden and kill the Keenes.  The pursuit brings a couple, Sandra and Lochlan ([[Megan Dodds]] and Ryan McCluskey) into the crossfire, with Lochlan being killed by Carden's men.  In a tense standoff in a cabin in the woods, Carden's friends turn up and Keene agrees to let Carden go. Just at that moment, one of Carden's thugs bursts in and punches Chris, causing Keene to panic and kill both thugs, sustaining critical wounds in the process. Carden escapes, taking Chris as a hostage while Sandra and Keene are rescued by the local police.  Feeling defeated and resting at home, a televised news report echoes an earlier conversation about Carden's job description with the key phrase "exterminating obstacles to progress", making Keene aware of Carden's intended target.  Keene heads to the funeral of Hammond, Jr. to intercept Carden, and inadvertently saves Carden from an attempted assassination from Carden's recent recruit, Davis ([[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]]). Carden gets the upper hand on Davis, killing him with his own sniper rifle. However, the battle forces Carden to miss his own window of opportunity to assassinate Hammond, Sr. Carden relents in giving Keene a set of keys to a hotel room where Carden locked up Chris, letting father and son reunite while he disappears.  In Washington, D.C., Carden intercepts his mission handler, Miles ([[Alice Krige]]), aware of her role in hiring Davis to kill him.  Carden threatens to pursue her if any harm were to come to the Keene family.  Two weeks after the incident, Keene enters into a relationship with Sandra and holds a family barbecue, expressing disbelief in hearing a radio news report about Hammond, Sr. dying in a boating accident, realizing that Carden finished his contract killing.

Yau is so depressed with her death that he indulges in alcohol and turns in his police badge to work as a private investigator. He becomes obsessed with finding out the reason for his girlfriend's suicide.  Three years later, Yau discovers that his girlfriend had actually cheated on him and she was waiting at a bar for her secret lover on the night she died. Her secret lover did not show up that night because he was involved in a car accident.

Yau gets over  the unhappy incident and falls in love with Hung, a girl who sells beer in the same bar.  Lau's wife, Susan, is the daughter of the billionaire Chow Yuen-sing. One night, Lau and two accomplices break into his father-in-law's residence, where they kill Chow and his butler, Uncle Man. Later, Lau lures his partners-in-crime to a rundown house and murders them, after which he attempts to make the scene seem as though the two of them killed each other in a dispute over the loot. Susan is not convinced that only the two killers were involved, so she hires Yau to help her investigate further. She has also become paranoid after her father's murder, so Lau has to discreetly give her pills to calm her down and put her to sleep.  After a long investigation, which includes a few dangerous confrontations with a "suspect", Yau discovers Lau's secret and dark past. Chow Yuen-sing had murdered Lau's family members in Macau several years ago when Lau was still a boy, and he bribed the police to close the case. Lau survived, took on a new identity, and grew up in an orphanage before moving to Hong Kong, where he became a police officer. Lau seeks vengeance on Chow and he pretended to fall in love with Susan and married her. He attempts to kill Susan by drugging her and locking her inside the kitchen after turning on the gas. Susan survives, but is badly injured because there was an explosion, and ends up in hospital.  Lau visits Susan in hospital and mentally confesses the truth to her. She reveals that she already knows he tried to murder her because she was still partially conscious when he drugged her and locked her in the kitchen. She then asks him if he ever really loved her. Lau realises that, in his desire for revenge, he has destroyed a new family he created with Susan. Susan does not believe him, loses her will to live, and dies. Yau meets Lau outside the hospital and tells him his conclusion. Lau returns to Susan's room, where he feels overwhelmed by guilt and eventually commits suicide by shooting himself in the head.

The Conclave
  The plot centers on the [[Papal conclave, 1458|conclave of 1458]], which took place five years after the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. The story material was sourced from a diary written by Silvius Aeneas Piccolomini, the only cardinal to ever record the secret proceedings of a papal conclave. The Conclave hinges on the drama surrounding a 27-year-old Spaniard, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (later [[Pope Alexander VI]]) as he struggles to save both his career and his life.  
Copying Beethoven
 It is set in 1824 as Beethoven ([[Ed Harris]]) is finishing his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]].  He is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma.  A fictional character, a new copyist, Anna Holtz ([[Diane Kruger]]) is engaged to help the composer finish preparing the score for the first performance.  Anna is a young conservatory student and aspiring composer.  Her understanding of his work is such that she corrects mistakes he has made, while her personality opens a door into his private world.  Beethoven is initially skeptical, but he slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows to view her with respect, and even with admiration.   Anna Holtz (as Beethoven refers to her) is sent to be his copyist, but due to her gender, is constantly thought less of, and is mistaken for a serving girl, maid, and even prostitute. Pushing past, though quite unhappily, from these assumptions, Anna proves herself to Beethoven, not only as a copyist, but also as his friend, and something of his protégé and heir as far as he is concerned. He gains much admiration of her, after she assists him by directing him, hidden among his musicians, as he simultaneously copies her movements to direct the orchestra during what would turn out to be, one of his final performances. Though Anna agreed to her romantic interest, Martin Bauer, that she would help him complete his symphony, and then immediately leave after showing him her work, she instead continues to assist him as his copyist. After seeing the admiration she has gained from Beethoven, Anna proceeds to show him a piece of music that she composed. Beethoven tactlessly and unknowingly insults her. Anna, more than ready not to return, continues to stay with her great aunt and the nuns at the convent. Anna is surprised when Beethoven, desperate to keep Anna in his employment and under his tutelage, bursts into the convent and begs Anna, on his knees, to come back and work as his equal on both of their music. He begins to teach her about Romanticism, music, and mostly, how to allow her artistic side freedom. Continuing his infuriating behavior, Beethoven smashes Martin's bridge he built for an engineer's competition, thereby ruining Martin as well. Anna, angry, confronts Beethoven, asking him if he had ever considered that she loved Martin. Beethoven replies, "You don't love him." Upon hearing this, Anna angrily asks if she is supposed to love Beethoven instead. Beethoven again replies, "No. You want to be me." From here, Anna agrees that Beethoven did the right thing, and continues to work with him, pushing him past his hardships and failures, and then staying by his bedside until he died. The movie ends though, with Anna finally embracing herself as an artist, unique from all other composers, including Beethoven, and readying herself for a promising future.   Though the film is directed very abstractly, leaving room for the audience to view Anna and Beethoven's relationship as that of a chaste romance, the characters remain very platonic, and could much more easily be viewed as a strong and close friendship, bordering on Beethoven even being viewed as a father figure of Anna's.  
Corporate (2006 film)
 ''Corporate'' centers around the power games between two industrialists, The Sehgal Group of Industries (SGI) owned by Vinay Sehgal ([[Rajat Kapoor]]) and the Marwah Group of Industries (MGI) owned by Dharmesh Marwah ([[Raj Babbar]]). The two companies are traditional rivals in the food & beverages products business. [[Bipasha Basu]] plays Nishigandha Dasgupta aka Nishi, vice president of SGI, while Vinay Sehgal's brother-in-law Ritesh ([[Kay Kay Menon]]) joins in later as senior vice president.  Ashwini, a politician backed by Sehgal, become the Union Finance Minister, which helps the Sehgal Group to enter a lucrative partnership with international food products giants Friscon.  In a CII meeting, the state Finance Minister Gulabrao declares that a public sector unit (PSU) is for sale. Both the companies pounce into the competition using every tactic they have to outperform each other. But last-minute politicking by Marwah with Gulabrao leads to the PSU going to the Marwah Group, leaving Sehgal disappointed.   However, Nishi charms Marwah Group's CEO Pervez, and is then able to steal critical information from his laptop computer: she finds out that Marwah had been misleading the media that they were planning to manufacture mineral water in the plant, whereas in reality they were planning to manufacture a mint-based soft drink. The Sehgal Group publicly announces that they will be launching their own mint-based soft drink, which they've named "Just Chill", pre-empting the Marwah Group's planned launch. Marwah traces the leak to Pervez and fires him.  Ten days before the launch of the drink, Sehgal learns that the FDA has found the presence of a large amount of pesticides in the drink. But Sehgal, cold-heartedly, decides to launch the product by bribing the FDA agents. However, CEO Naveen resigns from the SGI. The drink is a great success. However, another of SGI's executive is unhappy that Ritesh is being made the CEO, and he gives Marwah the information that SGI's product contains pesticides. Marwah along with Gulabrao blow up the issue in the media, leading to a raid on the SGI plants and a case on the Sehgals. Sehgal decides that the only solution is for an employee of SGI who is not a member of the Sehgal family to take the blame for the blunder. Nishi is chosen for that role.  Ritesh is called on by his sister Chayya Sehgal, where she asks him to convince Nishi to sacrifice for the company. Initially disagreeing, Ritesh agrees to convince Nishi on the insistence of Sehgal as he promises that Nishi would be released by the Enquiry Commission soon. A foreign investor holding major stake in Friscon, urges Ashwini to settle the dispute between the two as this would lead to capital flight and foreign investors will pull back their investments, causing serious havoc in the business market. Ashwini discusses the issue with Gulabrao and both the ministers mediates between Marwah and Sehgal to settle down the issue. Marwah agrees to withdraw all the allegations suited through NGO's and drawing their limitations in Friscon company. However, Gulabrao refuses to release Nishi as it would dent his chances of chief minister-ship as elections roars near.  Meanwhile, Ritesh comes to know that Nishi is pregnant with his baby. Ritesh, angry about it, threatens to expose Sehgal in front of the media if Nishi is not released within 48 hours. The next day he is found dead, having fallen from the terrace of his apartment building. It is assumed to be suicide but some think otherwise. The movie ends the narrator of the story concluding that Marwah and Sehgal are living happily in their world, whereas there is no place of emotions in corporate world as Nishi is the victim of the corporate tactics. The movie shows Nishi still fighting the case after two years of the incident with her child.  
Crank (film)
 Chev Chelios, an [[English people|English]] [[hitman]] based in [[Los Angeles]], works for a crime syndicate led by Don "Carlito" Carlos. Chelios is contracted by Carlito to kill mafia boss Don Kim as members of the [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]] have been encroaching on Carlito's business. Chelios goes to Don Kim and apparently murders him.  However, ambitious small-time criminal Ricky Verona uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios: Verona will kill Chelios so the Triads do not retaliate, and then take Chelios's place as Carlito's new hired gun. The morning after Don Kim's death, while Chelios sleeps in his apartment, Verona, his brother Alex, and several henchmen break in and inject Chelios with a Chinese synthetic drug which inhibits the flow of [[adrenaline]], slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recording left by Verona showing what he has done. Furious, Chelios smashes his TV and heads out.  Chelios phones Mafia surgeon Doc Miles, who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, and he is unsure if the antidote exists. Chelios keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts, which include picking fights with other gangsters, taking illegal drugs and synthetic epinephrine, fighting with the police, and having public sex with his girlfriend Eve.  Chelios visits Carlito at his penthouse and asks him to help find an antidote, as well as to find and kill Verona and his crew. Carlito says there is no antidote and only confirms that Carlito and Verona are working together. Carlito tells Chelios how he will use his death as a scapegoat against the Chinese. An angered Chelios leaves Carlito's penthouse to find Verona. Through Chelios' street contact, a [[transvestite]] named Kaylo, he finds Alex at a restaurant and unsuccessfully interrogates him about his brother's whereabouts before killing him. Chelios phones Verona through Alex's phone and tells him of his brother's death, prompting Verona to send thugs after Eve as a revenge. Chelios rushes to pick up Eve before Verona's thugs get to her. Chelios reveals his true profession to her and that he was planning to retire to spend more time with her.  Kaylo, who has been kidnapped by Carlito's men, is forced to call Chelios and tell him that Verona is at a Triad warehouse. Chelios goes there, finding Kaylo's corpse and the henchmen. They reveal that Carlito ordered them to kill Chelios. Eve, who has followed Chelios, unexpectedly arrives, but then escapes with Chelios after a shootout with Carlito's henchmen. Chelios and Eve go to Doc Miles's place, where Miles explains that he cannot cure Chelios. Knowing that he will die soon, Chelios decides to take his revenge on Verona and arranges a meeting with him at a downtown hotel.  Chelios goes to the rooftop of the hotel and meets with Verona, Carlito, and his henchmen. Carlito takes out a [[syringe]], filled with the same poison used by Verona. As he is about to kill Chelios by injecting the second dose into him, Don Kim, revealed to be alive as Chelios spared him, arrives with his Triads to assist Chelios and a shootout follows. During the battle, several of Don Kim's and all of Carlito's men are killed. Carlito tries to escape with his private helicopter, but Chelios manages to catch up to him and holds him at gunpoint. Before Chelios can kill Carlito, Verona sneaks behind and injects Chelios with the syringe, after which Chelios collapses. Carlito himself is betrayed by Verona, who shoots him dead and tries to escape with his helicopter.  Chelios manages to stand up, boards the helicopter, and engages in a fight with Verona. After some struggle, Chelios manages to pull Verona out of the helicopter and while mid-air, Chelios proceeds to snap Verona's neck, killing him. While falling, Chelios calls Eve on his cell phone to apologize for not coming back. Chelios hits a car, bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera. In the last shot, it is implied that his adrenaline is indeed still flowing fast; his nostrils flare, he blinks, and two heartbeats are heard.  
The Covenant (film)
  In the town of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], four college school boys - Caleb, Pogue, Reid and Tyler, together known as the Sons of Ipswich - are the descendants of colonial [[Witchcraft|witch]] families and thus wield magical abilities which first manifest on their 13th birthday and grow stronger until they Ascend at 18. The Power is linked to their life force; the more they use, the faster they age. This becomes more dangerous as, upon Ascending, their powers reach their full strength and become so addictive, suductive as they say, that some can't resist. Caleb - who's closest to his 18th birthday - exhibits restraint.   While attending a rave, Caleb meets Sarah, a transfer student from a community college in [[Boston]]. The Sons also meet Chase Collins, a new student at Spencer Academy. Their meeting is cut short when cops appear to break up the party. The boys escape by using their combined magics. After a student is found mysteriously dead near their campus, various paranormal occurrences take place, with Sarah and her roommate Kate being the focus of it. Upset, Caleb suspects Reid - the most reckless of the warlocks - but he angrily denies any abusive usage of his powers.   Caleb and later Pogue see a "darkling," a dead spirit and malicious omen. Meanwhile, Caleb and Sarah quickly become romantically close. During a swim race, Caleb notices Chase, who had befriended the group, displaying magic usage. After researching, Caleb concludes that Chase descends from a fifth family, the bastard son of Goodwin “Goody” Pope, one believed long extinct, and that he is the true perpetrator. As the Sons discuss this revelation, Pogue learns that his girlfriend was rendered comatose by a spell. Enraged, he hastily challenges Chase, who swiftly hospitalizes him.  Caleb visits Sarah only to fall into Chase's trap. Chase reveals that he was unaware of his magic’s origin, having been adopted. After locating his biological father, he learned of the price for ascension; but it was too late and he has become too addicted to using magic. His biological father then transferred power to him. Chase wants to force other "ascended" witches to transfer power to him as well, starting with Caleb. Despite Caleb's warning that having more power does not save him from aging to death, Chase ignores him. Before leaving, Chase threatens harm on Caleb's family and friends if he does not get what he wants. Caleb reveals the truth to Sarah and takes her to his father, a man of forty-four years with a decrepit old body, exhausted from magic abuse. When Sarah suggests that one of the other three transfer their power to Caleb so he could evenly match Chase, Caleb immediately refuses, explaining that doing so will cost them their lives.   On the night of Caleb’s eighteenth birthday, he leaves to face Chase alone, and has Reid and Tyler safeguard Sarah in public. However, Chase easily kidnaps Sarah. At an old barn, the two confront each other. Chase reveals a spellbound Sarah and gives Caleb an ultimatum of his life for hers. Caleb declares he won’t will his power away or let Sarah come to harm. They duel and Caleb is clearly outmatched. At the exact minute of his birth, he ascends, and his power fully matures, which allows him to mount an offensive. However, as Chase has more than one magical share, he still proves superior and the temporary turn of tide does not last long. Back at home, Evelyn, Caleb's mother, begs her husband to save Caleb. He sacrifices himself and transfers his power remotely to his son. Once his father’s power is infused within him, Caleb hits Chase with a final blow that engulfs him in a ball of flame. Sarah, Kate, and Pogue awaken, freed from their curses.  Firefighters arrive on the scene. Caleb and Sarah wait until inspection of the barn’s wreckage is complete; they are informed that a third person was not found, suggesting Chase somehow survived and escaped. The pair get into Caleb’s car, and he casually uses magic to fix the busted windshield, which seems visibly unsettling to Sarah. He reassuringly holds her hand, and they drive off.

Crickets (film)
   
Crossover (2006 film)
 The movie starts with [[sports agent]] and [[bookie]] Vaughn (Wayne Brady) riding through Detroit, Michigan setting up wagers for an upcoming basketball game that he is in charge of. One of the protagonist of the film, Tech (Anthony Mackie) is the frontman of his streetball team (Enemy of the State) and he is determined to take down Jewelz (Phillip "Hot Sauce" Champion) and his team "Platnium". Before the game starts, Tech calls his friend (and the other protagonist) Noah Cruise to participate in the game. Noah is very reluctant but ends up playing after Tech says "Look, you owe me man. You owe me". In the first game, we also see one of Tech's best friends , Up (Lil JJ) rooting for him on the sidelines. During the game, Vaughn explains the game of streetball to his girlfriend Nicki who has come from Los Angeles to visit him. Tech's team ends up losing the game. This is where we see that although they are best friends, Tech and Cruise live in completely different environments. Noah is a naturally talented basketball player who receives an athletic scholarship to [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. His mother has died and he has moved from a  [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit#Mile roads within Wayne County|7 Mile]] neighborhood in north [[Detroit]] to the prestigious [[Palmer Woods]] neighborhood to live with his grandmother. Although he is a skilled player, Cruise wishes to use his scholarship to become a medical doctor. Tech on the other hand, still lives in a run-down Detroit neighborhood where he has to help his mother pay for groceries and pay the bills.  Nikki tells Vaughn that she is not fond of the lifestyle he has in Detroit (hosting illegal basketball games and running nightclubs), and while leaving back to Los Angeles, she tells him that she wants him to live in LA with her.  Meanwhile, on his way to work, Tech comes across Up who asks Tech to play basketball but Tech says thy will have to play later. While at work at Foot Locker, Cruise tells Tech that he has two tickets to his college's orientation in California so he invites Tech. A girl named Eboni walks in and invites Tech to a tattoo party. While talking to Ebony, Jewelz and the rest of his team walks in and brag about their victory over Tech's team. Throughout the day Up is still at the park waiting for Tech to return to play basketball with him. While on their lunch break, Vaughn approaches Tech and Cruise in an attempt to persuade Cruise to join the NBA. Cruise has a reputation as one of the best basketball players in the state, so Vaughn tries to recruit Cruise at every chance he gets. Cruise mentions that he has no interest in the NBA and wants to be a Doctor after finishing college. Because of NCAA collegiate rules, a sports player cannot earn money from playing any outside sports. If they do, their scholarship is revoked (which is why Cruise was so reluctant to play the first basketball game in the beginning of the film). Vaughn mentions that although Cruise didn't directly take any money, Vaughn paid Tech and Tech paid the other members on the team. Cruise leaves out of anger but Tech calms him down and invites him to the tattoo party that Eboni invited Tech to.  Tech returns home and sees Up sitting in his bedroom. Up mentions that he waited all day at the park for Tech to show up. Tech says they will have to play basketball another time because he is busy, but Up then gets upset and leaves.  At the party, Eboni introduces Tech and Cruise to her friend Vanessa (who turns out to be Jewelz's ex-girlfriend. Vanessa and Cruise are instantly attracted to each other and start dancing. While at the party, Tech tells Eboni his dreams about playing professional ball, and how he is focused on getting his GED. Turns out that Tech never went to the 12th grade, as he ended up going to jail for 4 months for assault. Meanwhile Cruise tells Vanessa about how he is going to California for college to become a doctor, and then they share a kiss. Tech and Cruise then bring Eboni and Vanessa to Cruise's home where they all relax in the pool. Cruise goes behind Tech's back and gives his second ticket to the orientation trip to Vanessa instead. When tells Tech about it, Tech is not upset because he also asked Eboni to go with him as well. Cruise asked how is he is going to get the money to pay for him and Eboni's plane tickets and Tech leaves with saying "I have to do what I have to do".  Tech goes to Up's home the next day to apologize and they finally play basketball together. They run a scheme against other players where  they pretend they do not know each other and Up dresses up as a nerdy kid on the sidelines and Tech challenges other players by saying "I bet me and four-eyes over there can beat anybody". As the days go by, they continue doing this and it works in their favor as they travel to different basketball courts doing it, which helps Tech raise the money for the trip. Meanwhile, Cruise gets a tattoo of "Cruise & Vanessa" on his arm (after previously telling her at the tattoo party days before that he would never get a tattoo). Tech also is studying for his GED test, even at work.  Cruise and Vanessa go out to dinner where she reveals she is pregnant, which excites Cruise. Vaughn suddenly appears and tries to convince Cruise some more to join the NBA, while Vanessa is hearing the entire conversation which causes her to want Cruise to join the NBA as well. Vaughn's attempt is unsuccessful and Cruise and Vanessa then leave. Meanwhile, Tech and Up's strategy gets compromised when a group of guys recognize them from a different court and catch on to their scheme. The guys try to beat up Tech and Up but they manage to escape.  While in LA Tech is performing in a commercial that he was offered a few weeks back from a casting director. After the shoot is done, Tech walks past a guy who is wearing the exact same clothes as him. One of the workers tells Tech that he is not going to be in the commercial and that the work he did was simply stunt-double work for the other guy. He goes back and ram-shacks his trailer and storms back to the hotel with Eboni. Vanessa and Cruise are checking out the campus and then they have lunch. At lunch, Cruise proposes to Vanessa and out of excitement, she asks him is he going to play in the NBA (because she knows it will make him a lot of money). Cruise tells Vanessa the deep reason why he doesn't really like basketball and would rather be a doctor - The night Cruise's mother is in the hospital dying, when he arrived to the hospital, there was a doctor that recognized him and said how he loved watching him playing basketball and that he remembers a 40-point game that Cruise had. Cruise mentions to Vanessa "my mother is laying there dying, and all he can talk about is me scoring 40 points. I don't know, I guess in the grand scheme things, basketball just isn't that important to me". Vanessa reminds Cruise that he should be scored that Vaughn will tell the media that Cruise played in one of his illegal basketball games. But Cruise reminds her that since he didn't play for money, Vaughn wouldn't gain anything from telling.  Back at the hotel Tech starts drinking and he gets in an argument with Eboni and tells her to "play her role". He admits that he thinks Eboni is only with him because he paid for her to come to LA and she doesn't truly like him. Eboni then slaps Tech when he says that her life wasn't anything special before she met him. Cruise and Vanessa arrive and Tech tells Cruise to mind his business when he asks what happened at the commercial. Vanessa defends Cruise and tells Tech that the only reason he is friends with him is because he is jealous of Cruise and wants his lifestyle. Tech tells Vanessa that Cruise wouldn't have his lifestyle if it wasn't for him.  The big secret is finally revealed. Tech was sent to jail for 4 months because one night when he and Cruise were at a party, Cruise became very drunk and assaulted a rich guy. Because Tech did not want Cruise grandmother's heart to get broke, he took the blame for Cruise and went to jail instead. This is also why in the beginning of the film, Tech told Cruise "you owe me" when Cruise did not want to play in the streetball game in fear of losing his scholarship. Tech then leaves by himself to go back to Detroit.  When Cruise returns to work at Foot Locker, his manager tells him that Tech was fired because Tech asked him for some time off work (so that he to go to LA with Cruise) when the manager told him no, Tech left anyway. Eboni goes to Tech's house to talk to him, but Up answers the door and lies to Eboni and says that Tech isn't home. Tech then goes to a basketball court to clear his mind, at which point Cruise arrives to apologize. Tech mentions that what Vanessa in the hotel was 100% true and that he is jealous of Cruise because he has "the gift" and Cruise doesn't want it but Tech does. Cruise then tells Tech that somebody reported to the media that Cruise played in an illegal basketball game for money, thus, he lost his scholarship. Tech asks him that since he lost his scholarship, is he going to accept Vaughn's offer and go to the NBA, but Cruise denies and says that he is going to community college and then transfer to university afterward as he still wants to be a doctor. Tech tells him that he is going to community college as well as he finally passed his GED test. Cruise agrees to play on Tech's team in the next basketball game, then leaves and goes to Vanessa's house.  At Vanessa's home, Cruise tells her that he lost his scholarship and that they won't be moving to Los Angeles. Vanessa mentions that it's not that big of a deal because now he can join the NBA. She is stunned when Cruise tells her that he is not going to the NBA either and that he will stay in Detroit and go to community college. He starts to tell Vanessa about their future but she instantly cuts him off and says she's not interested anymore. She also tells him that she was wrong about being pregnant by him and that the baby belongs to Jewelz. Vanessa openly admits that she has been playing Cruise and that she knew all along that he wasn't the father. But since Cruise came into her life with a free-trip to Los Angeles and the opportunity to become a basketball star, she chose to be with him. Cruise drives home heartbroken and ends up getting into a motorcycle accident.  In his hospital bed, Cruise softly whispers to Tech how Vanessa lied to him. The next day Tech storms in to the nail salon where Vanessa and Eboni both work and tells how he knows that she was the one that told the media that Cruise played in the basketball. Vanessa tells him she's not aware of what he's talking about but Tech knows she is lying and leaves. Tech and Eboni then go to a wagering shop and Tech bets $10,000 that Enemy of the State will beat Platinum in the next game. Tech received the $10,000 in the mail from the commercial he did back in Los Angeles (revealing that even though he won't physically be in the commercial, he still got paid for the work he did).  Tech is then having a meeting with is team at a basketball court. Vaughn arrives and tells Tech that heard about the $10,000 bet, and he returns the money to Tech and tells him the bet is off. The bet was that if the Platinum team scores over 11 points, then Tech loses the bet. Even if Platinum loses the game, if they score over 11 points, then Vaughn wins the $10,000. Vaughn tells Tech that he can't beat Jewel'z team because they haven't lost a game in three years. Tech instantly changes the subject and brings up how Vaughn was the mastermind behind Cruise losing his scholarship. Vaughn states how he didn't say anything to the media, but Tech figures out that even though Vaughn didn't directly say anything, he was aware of Vanessa's gold-digging lifestyle and that's why he talked to Cruise about the NBA in front of Vanessa (because he knew that Vanessa would tell the media instead- which she did). Vaughn silently admits that Tech is right and he accepts the bet.  At the basketball game, Up takes Cruise's spot on the team and Tech wears Cruise's jersey. The final possession comes down to Enemy of the State leading the game 19-11. Up makes the final 2-pointer and wins the game for Enemy of the State 21-11 (since Platinum didn't score more than 11 points, Tech wins the $10,000 bet as well). After the game, Vaughn offers Tech a spot as one of his players under his management and how they can make so much money together because "great minds think alike". Tech corrects him and says that "great minds think for themselves", and uses the analogy of how Cruise wanted to get an education and be a doctor, but everybody else wanted him to join the NBA. Tech declines Vaughn's offer and then walks out of the basketball arena.  In a voice-over "Where Are They Now?" segment, up reveals what happened to everyone afterwards:  '''Vaughn''' - Vaughn was really bothered that Tech did not accept his offer. Therefore, he sold his nightculb, shut down the basketball arena, and moved to Los Angeles to be with Nikki.  '''Jewelz''' - Jewelz broke his ankle in a streetball game and ended up opening up a strip-club. Turns out Jewelz was not the father of Vanessa's child either.  '''Vanessa''' - . Vanessa had 2 more kids and still works part-time at the nail salon.  '''Cruise''' - Cruise got out of the hospital with a clean bill of health. Graduated from community college, and then moved to Atlanta Georgia to attend Morehouse School of Medicine.  '''Eboni''' - Eboni moved to New York and got a job as a make-up artist for commercials and television shows.  '''Tech''' - Played basketball for the team at his community college and got the attention of some sports scouts. These scouts helped Tech get a spot on the El Madrid team in the Euroleague.  '''Up''' - Earned All-American honors at his high-school basketball team.

Creepshow 3
 ===Wraparound story=== Unlike the first two ''Creepshow'' installments, in which the wraparound element linking the stories was a [[Horror comics|horror comic]], ''Creepshow III'' takes an approach similar to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', in which characters from each story interact with each other during the film. There is also a hot dog stand as a common element in the movie. Brochures, ads and other things from the hot dog stand are peppered throughout.  ===Alice=== Alice (Stephanie Pettee) is a stuck-up, snotty teenager who comes home to find her father meddling with some kind of universal [[Remote control|remote]]. Whenever he presses one of the buttons on the device, the whole family except for Alice changes [[ethnicity]] (i.e., the "Color and [[Hue]] Settings" button makes her family turn [[African Americans|African-American]], and the "[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]]" button makes her family turn [[Hispanic]]). During this, Alice gradually mutates into what is supposedly her "true form".  Just when Alice thinks everything is back to normal, her father presses another button, revealing Alice's true form. Her family is absolutely horrified at the sight of Alice. The story ends with Professor Dayton, the mad scientist from down the street, using another remote control to turn Alice into a white [[rabbit]].  ===The Radio=== Jerry ([[A. J. Bowen]]) is a part-time security guard who buys a [[radio]] from a homeless street [[vendor]] to replace his old one which has stopped working; however, this mysterious new radio is far from ordinary as it can have a [[conversation]] with Jerry. Very soon Jerry is stealing [[money]] and murdering people, all at the whim of his new radio.   After escaping with a hooker who lives in his building, Jerry is told by the radio to kill the hooker or she will kill him. He refuses and destroys the radio.  Right after, the hooker finds his gun in the car and shoots Jerry, killing him. Moments after she kills him and wipes the gun clean, she is shot in the head. The shooter is revealed to be the pimp living in the same building as Jerry. When the pimp returns to his car, another radio tells him to go and start a new life.  ===Call Girl=== Rachel, a murderous [[call girl]], receives a request from a shy man named Victor, her newest client. Rachel thinks he will be just another easy victim. When Rachel gets there, scenes of a murdered family with their necks ripped out are flashed on-screen, and there is no evidence of Victor living in the house.   Rachel then chains him to the bed and proceeds to stab him in the chest, places a pillow over his face, and then has a quick shower. She then keeps hearing Victor's voice saying, "You killed me." Rachel removes the pillow and reveals a gruesome creature with a large, toothy mouth. It is then revealed that Victor is an actual vampire. He kills Rachel and hangs her in the room with the house owners whom he's already killed. Blood starts pouring down her neck in a strange way indicating she will become a vampire.  ===The Professor's Wife=== Two former students come to visit Professor Dayton and meet his fiancee, Kathy. Having been victims of his practical jokes in the past, they suspect that Kathy is actually a [[robot]], which the professor has supposedly spent the last 20 years working on in his [[laboratory]]. She also behaves like a robot and does not eat or drink, which further indicates that she is probably mechanical.   When the professor is out of the house, they decide to dismantle Kathy to see what she looks like on the inside. To their utter [[Horror and terror|horror]], they learn that Kathy really was a human being after all and that she was a mail order bride. The professor later buys an 'advanced' [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] kit from the homeless street [[vendor]] to put Kathy back together in time for the [[wedding]].  ===Haunted Dog=== A cruel, miserly [[physician|doctor]], Dr. Farwell, is working a 30-day [[court]]-ordered sentence at a [[free clinic]], where he is very insolent and rude towards his patients. He even goes as far as to show no sympathy towards a young girl with a [[brain tumor]] and mocks an elderly woman who is going [[Blindness|blind]]. One day, he buys a [[hot dog]].  Dr. Farwell accidentally drops it on the ground. He sadistically decides to give the dirty hot dog to a [[Homelessness|homeless]] man who has been bothering him for some spare change. The homeless man dies after taking one bite, and he returns to haunt the cruel doctor. The story ends with the doctor having a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] from having had too many encounters with his ghostly stalker. The homeless man can be heard muttering, "Thanks for the good dog" to Dr. Farwell throughout the segment.   ===Epilogue===  It shows The Professor at his wedding with his resurrected wife (who is bandaged up from being murdered in "The Professor's Wife") with a huge crowd around them, the professor and his wife drive off. The camera zooms in on the back of the hot dog guy's head. He turns around, revealing that he was the Creep all along.  
Crossing the Dust
 During the fall of Saddam in 2003, two Kurds are looking for the parents of an Arab boy named Saddam. At the same time the boy's parents are looking for him everywhere, worried because his name is now taboo. All the attempts of the two Kurds (Azad and Rashid) to get rid of the child fail: neither the Americans nor clerics at the mosque want him. Little Saddam begins to become a real problem. Azad overcomes ethnic differences and tries to help the boy find his parents, much to the objections of Rashid, whose family was wiped out by Iraqi troops under Saddam during the anti-Kurdish campaign in the 1980s. Azad is killed while trying to protect the boy from Saddam's troops, who want to take him back. Rashid puts aside his animosity and carries on with the task of helping the boy find his parents.  
Curious George (film)
 The introduction of the movie is a cartoon short where we are introduced to a happy, artistic, and mischievous but lonely little orphaned monkey somewhere in the jungle. Meanwhile, Ted ([[Will Ferrell]]) is an employed guide at the Bloomsberry Museum. We are introduced to teacher Ms. Maggie Dunlop ([[Drew Barrymore]]) and her students who come to the museum often but they are the only regular visitors. Mr. Bloomsberry ([[Dick Van Dyke]]) heartbreakingly informs Ted that the museum will have to close because it is no longer making any money.   Bloomsberry's son, Junior ([[David Cross]]), wants to tear down the museum and replace it with a parking garage. Ted is convinced to volunteer to go to Africa in place of Mr. Bloomsberry and bring back a mystical, forty foot tall idol known as the "Lost Shrine of Zagawa" in the hopes that it will attract customers, much to Junior's envy. Ted is outfitted with a ridiculous yellow suit (which causes people to laugh at him) and boards a cargo ship to Africa despite his embarrassment.  With the help of a tour guide and tour group, Ted supposedly finds the idol, but discovers it to be only three inches tall, much to his disappointment. He sends a picture of it to the museum, but the unfortunate angle leads Mr. Bloomsbury to believe that the shrine was even taller than he had originally believed. Ted also encounters the little monkey and gives the monkey his yellow hat. The monkey, who quickly grows fond of Ted, follows him and boards the cargo ship, unbeknownst to Ted. Ted returns home to find advertisement for the shrine all over the city, much to his dismay. He enters his apartment only to receive a call from Bloomsberry telling him to report to the museum, so Ted can do an interview on the news.   The monkey follows Ted to his [[apartment]], and is discovered busily repainting a posh apartment in full scale African animals and due to the strict "no pets allowed policy", Ted is [[evicted]] by grumpy doorman Ivan ([[Ed O'Ross]]). Ted returns to the museum and reveals to Bloomsberry the idol's size. Ted is kicked out of the museum by Junior after the monkey accidentally destroys an [[Apatosaurus]] skeleton.  Ted and the monkey sleep outside in the park, and the next morning, Ted follows the monkey into the zoo, where Maggie and her young students name the monkey "George". George gets into trouble when he begins dangerously floating away on balloons high up over the city, Ted takes flight as well to save him. George's balloons are popped by spikes on a building and Ted catches him.  Ted and George make their way to the home of an inventor named Clovis ([[Eugene Levy]]), where George uses an [[overhead projector]] to increase the idol's size making it appear 40 feet tall. Ted and George head to the museum to show Bloomsberry the invention. Junior tries to convince his father that it would not be honest to fool the public, but the elder Bloomsberry sees it as the only way to save the museum. Crushed by Bloomsbury’s gratitude to Ted while he is neglected, Junior foils Ted's plan by pouring a [[latte]] on the projector causing it to explode and frames George for it by giving the rest to him. Ted addresses the crowd outside of the museum, announcing that it would be closed permanently and they didn’t have the idol. Believing his life to be ruined, Ted allows [[animal control officer|animal control]] to take away George.  Ted speaks with Ms. Maggie who helps Ted "see" what is really important in his life. Ted regrets the decision to give George to animal control, and boards George's [[cargo ship]] to get him back. Ted tells George that nothing else matters besides their "buddyship". In the hold of the ship, George discovers that when reflected in light, the idol reveals a [[pictogram]] with the message "turn your eye to the light, go from blindness to sight". It turns out that when held up to the sun, the small idol is actually a [[map]] to the real idol. They sail the ship back to Africa and George helps him find the real idol which is, indeed, forty feet tall.  The idol is put in the museum, and the museum goes back in business and becomes more successful than ever when it becomes more hands-on because of the addition of Clovis's inventions, the interaction with Ms. Dunlop and her young students and, of course, George. Junior ends up the valet, but finds joy in Mr. Bloomsbury finally being proud of him. Ivan invites Ted to move back to his apartment because he likes George, and Ted and Maggie almost start a romance, but George causes more trouble by starting up a rocket ship, forcing Ted to follow him.  
The Curiosity of Chance
 In 1980s Europe, flamboyant and gay 16-year-old Chance Marquis shows up at an international high school in a [[top hat]] and [[Tailcoat|tails]], immediately attracting the attention of the "queer-hating" resident bully, among others. Through his involvement in the school newspaper, he meets an introverted photographer with a mysterious briefcase, and while practicing [[tennis]], he befriends a catty fashionista, both of whom act as his wingmen in his new high school. He also meets the jock-next-door, with whom he forms a tentative friendship, despite the jock's cacophonous group of friends. The film follows Chance through a year of high school, with its attendant drama, successes, and hijinks—including sneaking into a drag bar, where Chance begins to explore his true self.  Themes underscored throughout the film include facing one's fears as one grows into adulthood, and the barriers that people put up in order to cope with life. Chance claims to be strong with his nonchalant attitude, but when photos of him in [[drag show]] up all over school, Chance must face his own preachings of staying true to oneself.  
The Curse of King Tut's Tomb (2006 film)
 In ancient Egypt, [[Tutankhamun]], the boy [[pharaoh]] who is said to have died young, was actually sent by the sun god [[Ra]] to protect the people from the demon [[Set (mythology)|Set]], who escaped from the [[Duat|Underworld]] and caused chaos in Egypt. With Ra's blessing, Tutankhamun manages to overcome Set and keep the demon under control by breaking an emerald tablet into four pieces and sending the pieces to the far corners of the world. However, the tradeoff is that he must remain in the Underworld.  In 1922, Danny Fremont, an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], is searching for the last piece of the tablet, which is believed to be in Tutankhamun's tomb. He found the first three pieces earlier, but they were seized from him by his rival, Morgan Sinclair. Sinclair is in the service of the Hellfire Council, a secret committee formed by a group of influential men from around the world, and they wish to use the tablet's powers to achieve their goal of world domination. Sinclair uses the Hellfire Council's influence to damage Fremont's reputation and cause him to lose his job.  Fremont is undaunted by the challenges he faces. With help from his buddies, he manages to convince several others, including a sceptical [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] named Azelia Barakat, to join him in his quest to find Tutankhamun's tomb and the last piece of the tablet. Despite their efforts, the last piece still falls into the hands of Sinclair and the Hellfire Council. Sinclair assembles all four pieces in the tomb, absorbs the tablet's powers, and unleashes Set and the demons of the Underworld. He also gets rid of the Hellfire Council's members later.  Fremont and his companions manage to hold off Sinclair and other enemies and make their way back to the tomb, where they open a portal to the Underworld. In the Underworld, Fremont and his friends succeed in finding and freeing Tutankhamun, but the boy pharaoh is too weak to help them. Meanwhile, Sinclair is absorbed by Set, who then attacks Fremont. At the critical moment, Barakat prays to Ra to empower Tutankhamun and her wish is granted. Tutankhamun springs to life, fights and destroys Set, and brings Fremont and Barakat (the only two survivors) safely out of the Underworld. Before leaving, Tutankhamun thanks them and tells them that "all things are as they should have been". Fremont and Barakat do not understand what he means and they leave the tomb just before it closes by itself.  Back in the streets of [[Cairo]], Fremont and Barakat finally understand what Tutankhamun meant when they see that all the negative events which happened earlier have been reversed: their dead companions are alive and well; Barakat's fiancé is happily married to another woman and has a family. Fremont chances upon [[Howard Carter]] and gives him the map to Tutankhamun's tomb; Carter becomes world-famous for his "discovery". At the end, in the [[Egyptian Museum|Museum of Antiquities]], Fremont proposes to Barakat and she agrees to marry him.  
Crusade in Jeans (film)
  Dolf is a 15-year-old boy from [[Rotterdam]] who plays for the junior national football team. At the beginning of the film, Dolf and his team are playing an important championship game against the Belgian team in the German city of [[Speyer]], They were trailling by a goal, and got the chance to equalise in the final minutes which dolf blew it.  Dolf's mother er works in a research centre in Rotterdam where a [[time travel|time machine]] has been developed. It allows an object, animal or person to be moved to a specified time and place in the past, and to bring them back again. But, a person moving to the past can only return to the present by being at an exact location at an exact time. Furthermore, a special medicine is needed daily to stay alive in the past.  Dolf decides to go back in time one day to replay the match, since he regularly visits his mother at the lab, assists with the work, guards know him, the [[iris scan]] authorization check lets him pass, and he knows his mother's password to the computer system. However, the activation of the system alarms the guards. Dolf manages to operate the machine just in time before the guards can stop him, but in his haste he accidentally enters the password instead of the destination date, and consequently travels to the year 1212. He ends up at the location of the present-day football stadium, not far from the city of Speyer, which already existed then.  After being attacked by vagabonds and being saved by a girl named Jenne, Dolf joins Jenne in the [[Children's Crusade]]: 8,000 children traveling from Germany to [[Jerusalem]] to pray for the city's deliverance from [[Ayyubid dynasty|the Muslims]]. The crusade is led by Nicolaas, a teenaged boy with visions, and an adult priest, [[clergy|Father]] Anselmus. Although it is a long detour, Anselmus has decreed that the children will travel to Jerusalem via [[Genoa]], where Nicolaas expects the sea to part, so the children can walk to the Holy City. What the children don't know is that Anselmus has secretly planned to sell the children to slave traders in Genoa, instead of bringing them to Jerusalem.  During the crusade, Dolf applies his modern-day knowledge to save the lives of many children, battling disease, kidnappers and hunger. He even saves one of the leaders, Prince Carolus, from drowning. All this helps him gain the respect of the children and Nicolaas. However, Anselmus and his bodyguard Vick are intent on discrediting Dolf and try to destroy his reputation whenever they can. Outside Genoa, they finally succeed in making Nicolaas and the other children believe Dolf is an agent of the devil, who should be executed. Dolf manages to escape his execution at the last moment with the help of Jenne and Carolus and finally uncovers Anselmus' plan to sell the children as slaves.  Meanwhile, Dolf's mother succeeds in sending him a message telling him the date and place of his return, after learning of his deeds and whereabouts in a mediaeval manuscript by Thaddeus, a monk whom Dolf has befriended. Although Dolf and Jenne succeed in getting to the location on time, a fight with the slave traders erupts and Dolf is forced to leave Jenne behind in 1212 and return to the present alone.  Back home, Dolf manages to persuade his mother to let him go back to 1212 in order to get Jenne. His mother agrees and Dolf leaves for 1212 once more, setting a new time and place for his return. In European territories the film ends here. For American audiences, an extra scene was added in which Dolf has once again returned to the present, this time with Jenne. He is seen replaying the football match he lost in the beginning of the film, with Jenne cheering him on in the crowd.  
Curiosity Kills the Cat (film)
 ''Curiosity Kills the Cat'' tells the same story of an affair gone sour in a modern Chinese city (in this case, [[Chongqing]]) from four separate perspectives. In the first part of the film, the story is told from the point of view of a young woman, Momo (Lin Yuan), who works in a photography store located in the same building as a luxury apartment complex. Momo has begun to secretly observe (and take pictures with her [[camera phone]]) John Zheng ([[Hu Jun]]) as he carries on an affair with Sharon ([[Song Jia (actress, born 1980)|Song Jia]]), the owner of a nearby nail salon. Momo also observes John's unhappily married wife Rose ([[Carina Lau]]), as she suffers attacks from an unknown vandal who dumps paint on her car and windows.  In the film's second part, the story of John and Sharon is retold, this time from John's perspective and how he became involved with the younger woman. The story is retold once again in the film's third part, now from the perspective of a security guard ([[Liao Fan]]). In this part of the film, John and Rose's young child is kidnapped and a murder of one of the characters  causes disarray to all the characters' lives.  
The Da Vinci Code (film)
  Jacques Saunière, the [[Louvre]]'s curator, is pursued through the Grand Gallery by an [[albino]] [[Catholic]] [[monk]] named Silas, who demands the location of the Priory's "keystone" to find and destroy the [[Holy Grail]]. Saunière gives him a false lead and is murdered. When the police arrive, they find his body posed like Da Vinci's [[Vitruvian Man]]. The police captain, Bezu Fache, sends his lieutenant, Jérôme Collet, to summon American [[symbologist]] [[Robert Langdon]], in the midst of signing autographs after one of his public talks, to examine Saunière's body.  At the museum, Langdon is shown the body, and a secret message, readable only by [[blacklight]], that contains an out-of-order [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] sequence. Sophie Neveu, a police [[cryptographer]] and Saunière's granddaughter, reveals to Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him after finding the words "P.S. Find Robert Langdon" at the end of Saunière's secret message, leading Fache to believe Langdon murdered Saunière. The two get rid of the tracker, distracting the police, and sneak around the Louvre, finding more clues in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s works, eventually leading to Langdon to deduce that Saunière was the grand master of the [[Priory of Sion]].  Silas is revealed to be working for an anonymous person named the Teacher, along with members of [[Opus Dei]], led by Bishop Aringarosa. Evading the police, Langdon and Sophie travel to the Depository Bank of Zurich, where they access a [[safe deposit box]] of Saunière's, using the [[Fibonacci sequence]]. Inside the box is a [[cryptex]], a cylindrical container that can only be safely opened by turning dials to spell a code word, and which contains a message on [[papyrus]]. The police arrive outside and Langdon and Sophie are aided by the bank manager, Andre Vernet, only for him to attempt to take the cryptex and murder them. Langdon disarms Vernet and flees with Sophie and the cryptex.  The two visit Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert who walks using crutches, who claims the Grail is not a cup but instead [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Jesus Christ]]'s wife. Teabing argues that she was pregnant during His crucifixion, and the Priory was formed to protect their descendants. The [[Opus Dei]] have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Later, Silas breaks into Teabing's house, but Teabing, using one of his crutches, disables him. The group escapes to [[London]] via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. They travel to the [[Temple Church]], but the clue to unlocking the cryptex is a [[red herring]]. Silas is freed by Remy while claiming to be the Teacher and taking Teabing hostage, dumping him in the car trunk, and taking Silas to hide out in an Opus Dei [[safe house]]. Teabing later poisons Remy and sends the police after Silas. Silas is shot by police after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache, who resents being used to hunt Langdon.  Langdon and Sophie are confronted by Teabing, who is revealed to be the Teacher, and who wants to bring down the Church for centuries of persecution and deceit. The trio goes to [[Westminster Abbey]] to the tomb of [[Isaac Newton]], a former grand master of the Priory. Teabing demands that the pair open the cryptex. Langdon tries and then tosses the cryptex into the air. Teabing dives for it, catches it, but acid dribbles and the papyrus thought destroyed. The police arrive to arrest Teabing, who realizes Langdon must have solved the cryptex's code and removed the papyrus. The code is revealed to be "APPLE", after the [[Isaac Newton#Apple incident|apocryphal myth]] of the apple which led Newton to discover his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]]. The clue inside the cryptex, which tells of the Grail hiding neath the rose", leads Langdon and Sophie to [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Scotland]].  Inside the chapel, they discover Magdalene's tomb has been removed. Langdon, after searching through documents, realizes that Sophie's family died in a car crash, that Saunière was not her grandfather but her protector, and that she is the last descendant of Jesus Christ. The two are greeted by several members of the Priory, including Sophie's grandmother, who promises to protect her. Langdon and Sophie part ways, the former returning to Paris. While shaving, he cuts himself and has an epiphany when his blood curves down the sink, reminding him of the [[Rose Line]]. Realizing the true meaning of the cryptex clue, he follows the line to the Louvre, concluding the Holy Grail, the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, is hidden below the [[Pyramide Inversée]]. Langdon kneels above it.  
Curse of the Golden Flower
  On the eve of the [[Double Ninth Festival]], the Emperor ([[Chow Yun-fat]]) and the second of his three sons, Prince Jai ([[Jay Chou]]), return from their military campaign to [[Nanjing]] so they can celebrate the holiday with their family. However, the Empress has been in an affair with the first son, Crown Prince Wan ([[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]]), who was born of the Emperor's previous wife. At the same time, Crown Prince Wan has been in an affair with Jiang Chan ([[Li Man]]), daughter of the Imperial Doctor, and is keen on rejecting the throne so that he may run away with her.  Prince Jai notices the declining health of his mother, and is confused by her sudden interest in golden flowers. The Empress explains that the tea she drinks has been poisoned for some time by the Emperor, but that she is planning a rebellion to overthrow him. Prince Jai agrees to be the leader of the rebellion. The Empress hires a mysterious woman to discover the type of poison which she is suffering from, but the woman is captured by Crown Prince Wan and taken to the Emperor. As it happens, the woman is Jiang Shi (Chen Jin), the Imperial Doctor's wife, whom the Emperor imprisoned a while ago and was believed dead, but who somehow escaped. The Emperor decides to pardon her and to promote the Imperial Doctor to governor of [[Suzhou]]. When Crown Prince Wan meets with Jiang Chan to say goodbye, she informs him that the Empress has woven 10,000 scarves with golden flower sigils. Crown Prince Wan confronts the Empress, and when she admits to planning a rebellion, he is anguished, and tries to kill himself with a knife, but survives.  On the way to Suzhou, the Imperial Doctor's household is betrayed and attacked by the Emperor's black assassins, resulting in his death. Jiang Shi and Jiang Chan run back to Nanjing and confront the Emperor, who refuses to answer, whereupon the Empress explains to Jiang Chan that Jiang Shi was the Emperor's first wife and Crown Prince Wan's mother, meaning that Jiang Chan and Crown Prince Wan are half-siblings. Jiang Chan is horrified by this news and runs from the palace. Jiang Shi chases after her, whereupon both are murdered by more assassins. At this point, the third son, Prince Yu, suddenly murders Crown Prince Wan and reveals he has been aware of the corruption of both the Emperor and the Empress. Prince Yu summons a group of his own soldiers to murder the Emperor and to seize the throne. However, even more assassins descend from the ceiling, and they easily defeat Prince Yu's soldiers. The Emperor proceeds to whip Prince Yu to death using his belt.  Meanwhile, the outer square of the palace is assaulted by 10,000 soldiers wearing golden armor and golden flower sigils, with Prince Jai in the lead. They overpower the assassins and proceed to the inner square of the palace, trampling upon the bed of golden flowers arranged for the ceremony. However, thousands of silver armored soldiers appear, being the reserve army of the Emperor, bearing shields, pikes, and bow-and-arrows, and they slaughter the golden soldiers down to the last man. Prince Jai rises from the sea of bodies and is taken captive. Behind him, the courtyard is cleaned with mechanical efficiency by a legion of servants, with bodies being removed, floors being scrubbed and laid with carpets, and pots of yellow flowers being replaced, making it seem as if the entire rebellion never even happened. At midnight, the Double Ninth Festival begins as scheduled. At the table, the Emperor expresses disappointment with Prince Jai, saying that he was already planning to give Prince Jai the throne. He offers to pardon Prince Jai if the latter cooperates in the Empress's poisoning. Prince Jai refuses and kills himself, and as he does so, his blood spills into another cup of poisoned tea that has been brought to the Empress, turning the tea red.  Horrified, the Empress slaps the tea away, and the liquid is shown to corrode the table's wood, along with the golden flower image engraved into the wood.  
The Cutting Edge: Going for the Gold

However, a serious injury derails that ambition. After months of training, Jackie is finally ready to skate again but has trouble keeping up with the rigorous demands of singles skating. Her parents send her on a vacation to L.A., where she meets surfer boy/in-line skater Alex Harrison. Sparks fly between the two, but when Jackie sees how glamorous Alex's life as a pro in-line skater really is after finding out he works as a valet at her hotel, she brushes him off. This makes Alex mad, so when Jackie shows up at the beach, where they were supposed to meet for a date, and makes a half-hearted apology, the irritated Alex picks a fight and the two go fuming their separate ways.   In the meantime, Jackie realizes that, considering the circumstances, pairs skating will give her a better chance at Olympic gold. After many unsuccessful interviews with prospective partners, she becomes frustrated. Then, after Alex Harrison sees Jackie on TV, discussing her search for a partner, he shows up for an interview. Even though Alex has no experience and has trained for only a short time, he shows remarkable natural talent.  However, Jackie feels that Alex is lazy and unreliable. Inevitably, the two lock horns. They fight so constantly that Jackie's mother locks them together with a harness, forcing them to do everything together. After that, Jackie and Alex start to get along, and their attraction grows. But then, Alex's old girlfriend Heidi shows up and jeopardizes Alex and Jackie's chance at gold. After a blowout fight at regionals, Alex leaves. Jackie convinces him to return, but also learns that Heidi and Alex are engaged. Alex and Jackie train for the Olympics, which will be held in Torino, Italy. Later, while in Torino, Heidi lets it slip that they are getting married immediately after the closing ceremonies and that Alex will be hanging up his skates for good.

Their long program is flawless and includes a move that has never been done before. In the final shot, Alex and Jackie are seen kissing.

 Charles Drake, maker of C-grade low-budget exploitation films, has brought on neophyte director Ed Smith for his latest bit of twaddle, "Curse of the Killer", based on an unfinished script penned by Ed himself. Ed fancies this opportunity as his big break, though he is alone in this belief as most everyone else involved with the meandering project sees it for what it is. Everything turns a darker shade of weird when people involved with the production start getting gruesomely killed off one by one. Charles, who has a history of dealing with nefarious characters, suspects the person responsible for the body count is a mob boss who is funding the film, but no one knows for sure. In the end, will there be anyone left to complete the film, or will the prophesy in the script "Curse of the Killer" turn into a reality?  
Daisy (2006 film)
 Hye-young ([[Jun Ji-hyun]]) is an artist who makes her living by sketching portraits of people for 30 euros per portrait.  Park Yi ([[Jung Woo-sung]]) is a professional hit man who sees Hye-young painting in the high mountains and instantly falls in love with her.  One day, while Hye-young is trying to cross a small channel connected by a narrow log, she falls down and loses her art bag, which contains all her painting equipment. Park Yi, who had been watching her from a distance, immediately runs to her rescue; but by the time he gets there, Hye-young is gone. He finds the bag she lost and gets the log replaced with a bridge. The next time she comes to paint, Hye-young is taken by surprise at the sight of the new bridge. Though, initially, she thinks the bridge is a coincidence, she is moved when she finds her lost bag hung in the middle of the bridge. She completes her painting of the mountains and leaves it in place of her bag as a gesture of thanks for the person who had built the bridge for her.   From that day on, she starts receiving daisy flowers daily at 4:15 pm sharp. As the days pass, she is touched by the humour of the person who is sending the flowers and develops a soft spot towards the person. On the other hand, Park Yi is afraid she might be hurt if he gets close to her, because of his profession. He subdues his feelings and maintains a distance from her.  Interpol detective Jeong Woo ([[Lee Sung-jae]]) is working on a case involving a drug ring. One day, on his way to track the activities of the drug dealers, he encounters Hye-young and her portrait stand. He asks her for his portrait as he surveys the crowd for suspicious activity; this continues for a few more days until one day the drug dealers come to know his hideout.  In the meantime, Hye-young starts to believe that Jeong Woo is the one sending her daisy flowers and instantly falls in love with him. Jeong Woo also hides the fact for fear of blowing his cover.  Park Yi, who has been constantly keeping an eye on Hye-young and Jeong Woo, notices a few gangsters advancing towards them with armed pistols. Park Yi instantly grabs his sniper and starts shooting the crooks. However, Park Yi accidentally shoots Hye-young in the neck, leaving her mute for the rest of her life. Jeong Woo is crushed with guilt, for he considers himself responsible for this entire episode.  Jeong Woo is transferred back to Korea, leaving Hye-young alone and heartbroken. Park Yi cannot help himself with Hye-young's condition and starts showing up and moving close to her. Hye-young is still in love with Jeong Woo and cannot forget him.  After a year, Jeong Woo comes back to the Netherlands and surprisingly shows up on Hye-young's doorsteps. He apologises for the entire episode and leaves her in tears. Meanwhile, Jeong Woo's boss, who wants to solve the case behind this whole episode, tells Jeong Woo to catch the guy who shot the gangsters. Further investigation reveals Park Yi's identity as professional hit man, and they set a trap.  Jeong Woo's boss contracts Park Yi's dealer to kill Jeong Woo in a plot to catch Park Yi. Jeong Woo shows up in a car secretly surrounded by many undercover cops. Jeong Woo came to know Park Yi as Hye-young's friend when he had gone to apologise to her. Park Yi suddenly shows up and asks Jeong Woo for a private talk. Jeong Woo stalls all the cops, saying that he is going to speak with a friend and is later found shot in the head. (Although Park Yi reveals his real identity and refuses to kill him, Jeong Woo is shot by another assassin belonging to Park Yi's group.)  Jeong Woo's boss gives hints of the activities of the man who killed Jeong Woo to Hye-young at Jeong Woo's funeral. Hye-young instantly realises who the killer is. Hye-young holds Park Yi at gunpoint, but fails to pull the trigger and falls unconscious due to the spiked tea she drank moments before.  Meanwhile, Jeong Woo's boss devises a much tougher plan to catch Jeong Woo's assassin by targeting himself for a [[contract killing]]. A series of events leads Hye-young to realise that Park Yi was the one sending her the daisies. Park Yi, who is all set to assassinate Jeong Woo's boss, is taken by surprise when Hye-young shows up asking him to stop. The assassin responsible for Jeong Woo's death shoots at Park Yi, but the bullet is intercepted by Hye-young, who sees the reflection of the car that the assassin is in on a building opposite, and she dies.  Park Yi takes his revenge by killing his entire gang. He later stumbles out of the building and limps down the street.  The epilogue shows Park Yi, Jeong Woo, and Hye-young standing in a crowd under an overhang, waiting for the rain to stop. When they spot each other, they smile.  
Daft Punk's Electroma
 The two lead characters appear as the robotic forms of [[Daft Punk]] and are credited as "Hero Robot No. 1" and "Hero Robot No. 2". One wears a silver helmet and the other wears a golden one. An opening scene shows the duo driving in a 1987 [[Ferrari 400|Ferrari 412]] with its license plate displaying "HUMAN". After passing through a [[Southwestern United States]] landscape, the duo arrives by car at a town in [[Inyo County, California]].<ref name="ElectromaReview" /> The town's resident are also shown to be robots physically identical to the two main characters, but at different ages, with different clothing and alternating gender.  The pair drive to a high-tech facility where liquid [[Latex (rubber)|latex]] is poured over their heads. The latex is shaped into human-like faces with the aid of [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] appliances and wigs. The resulting look caricaturizes the members of Daft Punk, [[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]]. When the two leave the facility, the locals of the town are shocked by their human appearance. The townsfolk gradually begin to chase the duo, whose faces eventually melt in the sun. The two take cover in a public restroom where the gold robot discards his ruined mask, then encourages the reluctant silver robot to do the same. Again appearing as robots, the pair then undergo a lengthy hike across desert [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]]s.  After walking for an extended period, the silver robot slows down and comes to a stop. Becoming aware of this, the gold robot walks back to the silver one. The silver robot continues to stare at the ground for a moment before removing his own jacket. He then turns away from the other robot, revealing a switch on his back. The gold robot flips the switch, which begins a timer. When the countdown ends, the silver robot is blown to pieces. The remaining robot piles the remains of the silver robot, then continues to walk. The gold robot eventually falls to his knees and attempts to reach the switch on his own back, but to no avail. Another moment passes before the robot removes his helmet and repeatedly slams it into the ground until the helmet shatters. Using one of the shards as a [[burning-glass]], the robot focuses the sunlight to set his hand ablaze. The film ends as the robot, completely on fire, walks in [[slow motion]] through darkness.  
Danika
 Danika Merrick ([[Marisa Tomei]]) suffers from increasingly disturbing, paranoid [[hallucinations]]. Most of her hallucinations involve threats to her family and media-fuelled fears such as child kidnappings, car accidents, her children lying and terrorism. Danika confides to her husband, Randy ([[Craig Bierko]]), and Evelyn ([[Regina Hall]]), her psychiatrist.  The movie begins with Danika apologizing for being late, being scolded by her bank manager about incorrect calculations. Her manager leaves the office, instructing Danika to remain there until errors are corrected. Danika then witnesses a bank robbery in progress with two trigger-happy robbers shooting anyone who moves. The alarm activates, and the robbers force Danika's boss to tell them where the security monitors are located. The manager points to her office where a shivering Danika seeks shelter in a corner. As the door opens, she expects to come face to face with a gun-toting bank robber, but is confronted by her manager who wonders what is wrong with her.  The movie continues with increasingly paranoid hallucinations, due to schizophrenia, including seeing a little girl in front of her daughter's school being pulled away by a suspicious-looking man as she asks Danika to help her; Danika does nothing only to watch in horror as the same little girl's mother appears on the news begging for her child's safe return. Danika also finds a human head in a grocery bag as she's putting the groceries in the fridge. She's oblivious as, standing in front of the school looking for her daughter who ran off, her daughter's teacher is killed by falling glass, (it turns out it's the same person's head she found in the grocery bag a day before). She also believes her son's partner for a school assignment is trying to give him AIDS, after she imagines the girl crawling into her bed and confessing she is dying from AIDS and is going to give it to Danika's son.  Near the end of the film, the audience learns that Danika was in a car accident years earlier while driving her young children home and she makes a side visit to see Randy. The accident occurred immediately after Danika found out he was having an extramarital affair with the children's nanny, Evelyn, in a motel shower. Danika's vision of the nanny is that of her psychiatrist who's been treating her, revealing they were one and the same. Evelyn reveals that both she and Randy thinks that Danika needs serious psychiatric help because her behavior is dangerous to her children. Danika attacks Randy and tells Evelyn to stay away from her children. She drives away from the motel home with the children in tow. After witnessing Randy's affair with Evelyn, Danika psychologically breaks down when she ran the red light and her car is hit by a school bus. In the car accident, all of Danika's children die, leaving Danika, (and, of course, Randy who was back at the motel), as the sole survivors. It can be assumed she never saw Randy again and which he probably blames the tragic death of their children on Danika and her "visions".  As the film ends, a homeless Danika sits on a bench at the scene where the accident occurred, basically reliving the events of that day, presumably every day out of guilt. She slowly walks away pushing a shopping cart filled with her children's belongings. All the events after the accident—reuniting with her husband and raising her children to adulthood, are hallucinations Danika experiences, caused by the tremendous guilt she feels for running the red light that led to her children's deaths.

Darna Zaroori Hai
 ''Darna Zaroori Hai'' interweaves six stories into one film. Five children get lost in the middle of a forest until they find a haunted house. Inside, there is an old woman who agrees to tell them six scary stories, and they will all compete on who is able to sit through all six stories without getting scared.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>  === Additional Story&nbsp;– Uncredited === ;Written and directed by [[Sajid Khan (director)]] The first story is about a young film-buff named Satish ([[Manoj Pahwa]]), living with his mother. Satish has a habit of watching a Bollywood movie in theaters every Friday, on the last show of the day. He decides to watch the film ''[[Darna Mana Hai]]''. His mother warns him not to take the graveyard shortcut because it's [[Friday the 13th]], a new moon night, and witches might appear. He insults his mother, and takes the shortcut. He safely arrives at the cinema, buys his regular snacks, gets some change back, watches the movie and returns home. On his return, he once again uses the graveyard shortcut. Walking through the graveyard, he hears clinking footsteps and begins to run. He sees a witch and falls to the ground in terror. His fear leads to his death. It turns out the footsteps were actually the coins jingling in his pocket as he walked and the witch he saw was actually a poster for a movie, ''Darna Zaroori Hai''.  === Official Stories ===  === Story 1&nbsp;– Imaginary Ghost === ;Directed by [[Ram Gopal Varma]]  Five children arrive at a haunted house. The resident of the house, an old woman, decides to tell them six scary stories. The children decide to have a competition to see who gets scared first. The first story is about a professor, Sunil Khanna ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), who is giving tuition to one of his [[Biotechnology]] student Altaaf ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]) at home. Every minute, the professor points out something (or someone) in his house. Once in the kitchen, once in the dining room and once on the sofa. The annoyed student decides to leave when the professor warns him not to leave the house, or the ghost will go after him as well. Curious, the student asks the professor about the ghost and the professor tells him that the ghost is an exact lookalike of himself, except he has a hollow face with a hat. The frightened student tries to run but the professor takes him in front of the mirror and points at his reflection. The professor's reflection in the mirror looks exactly like the ghost he talked about. After the story, one child, Nisha, goes down to the bathroom, only to come back as a ghost without revealing her real identity. Nisha sits down with the rest of the kids with a bowed head.  === Story 2&nbsp;– Spirits Do Come === ; Written and directed by [[Prawaal Raman]] The second story is about a photographer, Kunal ([[Arjun Rampal]]), who confronts a strange house when his car breaks down. There, Varsha ([[Bipasha Basu]]) invites him in and claims she has been lonely for the past few years since her husband Rahul died. He tries to make a phone call but is confronted by Rahul. He gets scared and says that Varsha opened the door, but gets astonished on listening that Varsha is the one who had died 2 years ago, and not Rahul ([[Makrand Deshpande]]). They then confess to a scared Kunal that they were playing a prank on him. The two explain to Kunal that Rahul has been trying to call spirits and bring them down to earth. When Kunal interrupts by saying he's in hurry, Rahul plays as if he is calling a spirit of a mechanic. After a few moments, the three hear a door knock, and Rahul goes outside to check and then he screams for Varsha and while Kunal decides to stay inside the house. When she comes out, there lies Kunal dead in the driver seat of his broken-down car. The scream was from Rahul, who was horrified at seeing Kunal's dead body. The door was knocked by a trespasser and he asks them to inform the police. Just then, Kunal walks out and declares in a chilly voice that spirits do come, whenever you call them. But sometimes sending them back becomes very difficult and he laughs in a chilly voice. After this story, another child, Rohan, goes to the bathroom but he too returns as a ghost.  === Story 3&nbsp;– Accidents are Never Predicted === ;Directed by Vivek Shah The third story revolves around a couple, Vishwas ([[Sunil Shetty]]), and his wife ([[Sonali Kulkarni]]) who both live with their son, Chintu. One fine day, the three are visited by an insurance agent Prabhakar Pandit ([[Rajpal Yadav]]) who keeps warning them about the risk of life and that accidents are never predicted. They kick him out of the house and their doorbell suddenly rings. They open the door only to find that there is no one there. They go back into the house but the bell rings yet again. It is the agent again, who claims it is raining outside and he has left his umbrella inside. He takes out many things such as a knife, rope and gun, which all represent different ways to die in life. Vishwas gets tired of him and asks him to leave. The agent then takes out the gun and threatens Vishwas and his family. Vishwas gets into a struggle with the agent which results in the agent being accidentally shot. Before he dies, as if confirming his statement, he says, "See sir, accidents are never predicted!"  After the story, another child, Aditi, leaves the room to get water and comes back with same fate as the two previous ones.  === Story 4&nbsp;– Ghostly Audition === ;Directed by Jiji Philip A film director, Karan Chopra ([[Anil Kapoor]]), decides to make a horror film. On the way to the sets, he gives a lift to a fine young woman, Riya ([[Mallika Sherawat]]), who pretends to be a ghost. Karan thinks she is just playing a prank and Riya later also claims that she was just joking. When stormy weather hits, Karan takes Riya to his mansion. The electricity and lights go out and Riya's face starts to gore with blood. Karan still thinks she's playing a prank, but when her voice turns ghostly, he falls to the floor and dies in shock. Riya takes off her mask, which was stained with [[fake blood]], and a microphone that changed her voice to make it sound ghostly. It is revealed that she really was only playing a joke on him. She says that she was trying to audition for his new horror film, but it's too late now anyway since Karan has already died on his own bedroom floor.  After this story, another child leaves the room to get water and also becomes a ghost.  === Story 5&nbsp;– A Bride's Revenge === ;Directed by [[J.D. Chakravarthy]] The fifth story centres on Ajay ([[Randeep Hooda]]), a young man driving on the road. He finds a young woman standing on the highway. When he approaches her, he becomes frozen after seeing her face. Shortly after, he wakes up in a jail accused of murdering a man. A police officer, ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]), brings the mother of the murdered victim to the police station for justice. But the mother is shocked to find that Ajay is possessed by the spirit of a woman, who turns out to be her daughter-in-law, Sandhya. It's revealed that the mother-in-law, her husband, and son had burned the newly-wedded bride to death and her spirit has come back for revenge. Sandhya's spirit reveals that it possessed Ajay and killed the son. The spirit enters the police officer's body and shoots her mother-in-law. When the spirit leaves the officer's body, he realises what has happened and secretly buries the body. Ajay is released and is driving back to the city when he sees Sandhya's spirit in the backseat. She says that her father-in-law is away in the city on a business trip and she must complete her revenge. She assures him that she will not harm him—all he has to do is drop her off there. This last part was severely criticized by the Indian public as spirits, ghosts and spectres are believed to be able to freely transport themselves without the means that are used by humans.  === Story 6&nbsp;– The Ending === After all of the stories are over, one boy, Ashu, claims that he is still not scared. The old lady smirks as the lights of the house suddenly turn off. The stunned boy looks around him. The lights turn back on immediately and he sees that he is the only one in the room: as if no one was ever there. The lights go off and turn back on again, this time to reveal his friends, all of whom are now ghosts, giving him eerie smiles. The old woman appears back on her chair, giving him a witch's smile. Realizing what is going on, the boy tries to make a frantic escape out of the house but the doors are all jammed and locked. Just as the boy looks back at the upstairs room to see if he was followed out, he sees the old lady right beside him, smirking. The old lady's hair is snow-white and scattered; her killer smile gives the boy a heart attack and he dies at the scene. The next morning, the house is swarming with police and the media. The police clear away the bodies of the dead children. The old servant of the house tells the police officers that a long time ago, the house belonged to an old lady who loved children but unfortunately, she had no children of her own. He explains that once, he had left her for hours to get her some medication (just as the old lady had told the children), and when he returned, he found her dead. The film ends with a reporter reading the tragic story of a camping trip-turned-nightmare for the six children. He says that the exact cause of death of the children is still unknown and will most likely never be known, however, one thing is for certain- all the children died of cardiac failure or in simple words&nbsp;— fear.

Day Watch (film)
 It is [[New Year's Day]] of 2006, more than a year after the events of ''[[Night Watch (2004 film)|Night Watch]]''. [[Anton Gorodetsky]], the [[protagonist]] of the first film, finds himself in the middle of an approaching conflict between the [[Others (Night Watch)|Light and Dark Others]], who are still bound with an uneasy truce. Anton is still a Night Watch operative, now working with his trainee and romantic interest, [[Svetlana (Night Watch)|Svetlana]]. As his son [[Yegor (Night Watch)|Yegor]] has now become a Dark Other, Anton is forced to secretly destroy evidence of Yegor's attacks on normal people, which violates the treaty, leaving the Night Watch unable to sentence Yegor.  To redeem for his previous mistake, an attempt to use a witch's service to kill the unborn Yegor (shown in the beginning of the first film), Anton seeks the legendary Chalk of Fate, a magical chalk that could rewrite history, which was once [[Timur|Tamerlane]]'s property and one of the main reasons for his numerous military successes.  Meanwhile, [[Zavulon (Night Watch)|Zavulon]], the leader of the Dark Others and their Day Watch, is waiting for Yegor's birthday. At the birthday, Yegor would become a Great Other and acquire the power that would allow the Dark Others to break the treaty (which is only supported because the Others fear that the two sides will destroy each other). Zavulon's gratitude to Anton for covering Yegor's violations of the treaty doesn't stop him and the Day Watch from attempting to frame Anton for murder and bring him in front of the Inquisition. They succeed, despite the efforts made by [[Gesser (Night Watch)|Gesser]], the head of the Night Watch, to protect Anton from the Dark Others by putting him in [[Olga (Night Watch)|Olga]]'s body. While in her body, Svetlana confesses that she loves Anton to the person she thinks is Olga, which pushes their relationship forward. This happens despite Svetlana's initial anger at Anton for not telling her that he was in Olga's body.  Anton obtains the Chalk of Fate from its hiding place in a Central Asian cafe in [[Moscow]] and uses it to summon Yegor. They initially get on well, but Yegor is resentful when Anton refuses his request to patch things up with Yegor's mother. Anton puts his large coat on Yegor, who seems to be cold, and leaves to order food. At this time, Svetlana rings Anton's mobile, which he left in the pocket of the coat, and Yegor, angry at her intrusion into his relationship with his absentee father, yells at her, "He has a family. Don't call again." He smashes the phone and leaves with the chalk, which he takes to Zavulon. Zavulon cannot use or touch the Chalk, because doing so would be a direct violation of the treaty, so he has Yegor give it to his minion/lover [[Alisa (Night Watch)|Alisia]] to do with as she wishes, although it is implied that Zavulon knows what she will do with it.  Yegor's birthday party begins soon after that; the guests are Dark Others (some of them are [[Russia]]n pop stars), although Anton makes his way to the party as Yegor's father to expose the real perpetrator of the murder he has been charged with - his vampire neighbor, [[Kostya (Night Watch)|Kostya]]'s father. He is unable, however, to avert a disaster: as Svetlana rushes to the party to find Anton, Yegor confronts her.  She tries to avoid a conflict but Yegor repeatedly challenges her and expresses resentment at her relationship with his father; Svetlana accidentally strikes Yegor and spills a drop of his blood, which Zavulon interprets as a violation of the Treaty and thus uses as a pretense to declare all-out war on the Light Others.  Yegor, now a Great Other, unleashes an apocalypse upon Moscow, killing most of the guests and blinding Svetlana. The city is nearly destroyed, starting with the [[Ostankino Tower]]; a fierce battle between the Light and Dark Others follows, with few survivors on either side. In the midst of the chaos, Anton, who survives, finds Alisia who is trying to revive her dead lover, Kostya, but without success. She cannot revive him because her actions did not cause his death. The scene implies the user of the Chalk can only change decisions that he or she made, not anyone else's. Anton convinces Alisia to give him the Chalk so that he can prevent the destruction of Moscow and the deaths of scores of Others, but is almost immediately caught by a panicked Svetlana and an enraged Yegor. The two Great Others fight for Anton, but nearly kill him in the process. Saved at the last minute by Gesser, Anton runs through the ruins of Moscow to the house where he, fourteen years ago, made his visit to the witch &mdash; the visit that caused the entire sequence of events, starting Anton's own initiation into the Night Watch. Anton writes ''NO'' (нет; pronounced ''nyet'') on a wall in this house. Moscow reverts to its normal, undemolished state and the film returns to 1992 and the first scene of ''Night Watch''.  In the epilogue, as a result of the Chalk's influence, Anton rethinks his deal with the witch, and therefore never inadvertently agrees to harm his wife's unborn child, who would have been Yegor. He walks out of the house and into the street, where he meets Svetlana. Zavulon and Gesser watch them from a park bench, eager to see if Anton will recognize Svetlana, despite now having never met her because of the rewriting of history. Gesser's prediction turns out to be accurate; despite not knowing how or why, Anton recognizes Svetlana and they walk off together, implicitly striking up a less harried relationship than the one they have/had in the first film.  
The Darwin Awards (film)
 The film opens with a car with a [[JATO]] rocket strapped to it. The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a [[criminal profiler]] for the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his [[hematophobia]] allows a [[serial killer]] to get away, Michael wallows in a deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]] for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases.  Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car. A pair of men attempting to ice fish become  frustrated and use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice. The problem is their dog plays fetch with the lit dynamite and runs it back to their brand-new SUV. As they investigate the cases, Michael tries to pinpoint a common factor for these people. The only explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane.   Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. He and Siri are stranded in the middle of nowhere on a cold night. Desperate for warmth, he attempts to start a fire with gasoline, causing his car to explode. Siri later confronts Michael, accusing him of being obsessed with the Darwin Awards.  A twist of fate leads to Michael discovering where the murder suspect he originally allowed to escape now lives, as he videotapes the man in his home by rappelling down the side of the building. The film school student is seen for the first time as he, too, is hanging on the side of the building. The problem is his rope is the other end of the same one Michael is dangling by. The stone vase on the roof that the pair is anchored to starts inching closer to the edge. At the same time the serial killer taunts them while slicing open the captive Siri's hand, hoping to trigger Michael's hematophobia. But Michael is able to overcome his fear and defeats the serial killer.  
Days of Glory (2006 film)
 In [[French North Africa]] in 1943 large numbers of men from [[French colonial empire|France's overseas possessions]] have been recruited into the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]] of the [[Free French Forces]] to fight alongside the other [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against [[Nazi Germany]] and liberate France from [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation]]. The army consists of two main elements: ''[[pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', that is people of mostly [[European diaspora|European]] descent, and ''[[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigènes]]'', those of mostly African descent. The “indigènes” in turn consist of three main groups: [[Demographics of Algeria|Algerians]], [[Moroccans]] (known as ''[[Moroccan Goumier|goumiers]])'', and troops from [[Sub-Sahara Africa]].  Saïd, an impoverished goat herder, joins the 7th RTA (Régiment de [[Tirailleurs]] Algériens). With him are other Algerians including Messaoud, who wants to marry and settle in France, and the literate Corporal Abdelkader, who seeks equality with settlers for the indigenous people of his country. There are also two Moroccan brothers Yassir and Larbi, Yassir's aim being booty so that Larbi can afford to marry.    Soon the men, dressed in mostly [[lend-lease]] [[U.S. Army M-1943 Uniform|American uniforms]] meet Sergeant Martinez, a battle-hardened ''pied-noir'', who trains them before leading them on their first engagement against the Germans in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. Their mission is to capture a heavily-defended mountain, but it soon becomes clear that their white commanding officer is using them as [[cannon fodder]] to identify [[artillery]] targets. The colonial troops eventually succeed, at the cost of high casualties. When asked by a French war correspondent about his thoughts on the losses, the white colonel replies, "today was a great victory for the Free French Forces".   The troops of the 7th RTA next embark for [[Operation Dragoon]], to liberate the south of France.<ref name=c4>[http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=160750 Days of Glory (2006) Channel 4 Film review], retrieved 2007-03-30</ref> While aboard ship, a white cook refuses to give tomatoes to black soldiers. Abdelkader calls for equality, but mutiny is averted when Martinez and the company captain promise that everyone will be treated the same.   On arrival at [[Marseille]], the colonial troops are greeted as heroes. Messaoud meets and courts Irène, a French woman, promising when the regiment leaves that he will write and one day return. She says she'll wait for him and they will marry. However, due to censorship of soldiers' mail, Irène never learns Messaoud's fate.  Saïd becomes Martinez's [[Batman (military)|orderly]], for which the other soldiers call him "girlie" and imply he's gay. Eventually he snaps and holds a knife to Messaoud's throat. Abdelkader calms the situation, but Saïd makes it clear that in this [[racial segregation|segregated]] world the French authorities will not give their colonial soldiers anything. Having seen among Martinez's possessions a family photograph, while drinking with the sergeant Saïd mentions that the two of them are similar in both having an Arab mother. The NCO attacks him and threatens to kill him if he reveals this secret.  The colonial troops discover that, while they are not granted leave, white members of the Free French Forces are allowed trips home. Eventually the men are told they will be going home, but it's a ruse; instead, they are billeted behind the lines and given a [[ballet]] performance. Bored and disillusioned, most leave the tent and hold a meeting outside decrying the injustice. Martinez challenges the group, led by Abdelkader, and a fight starts.  Early next morning, French [[National Gendarmerie|military police]] bring Messaoud to a temporary [[stockade]] where Abdelkader is also being held. Messaoud says he was arrested for trying to go back to Marseille and find Irène. Abdelkader is brought before the white colonel who tells him that he needs him to go on a special mission: to take ammunition to American troops fighting in the [[Lorraine Campaign]] and also be the first French troops to liberate [[Alsace]]. The white officer promises that Abdelkader and the other colonial soldiers will get the rewards and recognition that success in this operation will bring. Later, the white company captain tells the corporal that the colonel will keep his word.  Most of the men are killed by a booby trap, including Yassir's brother, as they cross the German lines, and Martinez is severely injured. The survivors mostly want to go back, but Abdelkader rallies them to push on. Eventually the corporal, Saïd, Messaoud, Yassir and the wounded Martinez reach an Alsatian village. Over the next few days the soldiers ingratiate themselves into the area and Saïd befriends a [[milkmaid]]. A battle begins when a unit of Germans arrives, and everyone except Abdelkader is killed. Messaoud is badly hurt by a [[Panzerschreck]] and then shot by a German rifleman. Saïd attempts to evacuate Martinez, but they are both shot by the Panzerschreck, killing Saïd and further wounding Martinez, who is quickly finished off. Abdelkader and Yassir attempt to flee, but Yassir is shot in the back by a German. However, just as the corporal is cornered, more colonial troops arrive and drive the Germans out of the village.  As columns of Free French forces begin to move through the area, Abdelkader sees the colonel passing in his jeep, but the white commanding officer ignores him and he is pulled away by a staff officer who asks him where his unit is. When Abdelkader says they are all dead, he is simply assigned to another white NCO. As he walks out of the village, he passes a film cameraman filming only white troops standing by the liberated villagers.  The movie then moves to the present day. An elderly Abdelkader goes to a war cemetery in Alsace to visit the graves of his comrades: Martinez, Saïd, Yassir and Messaoud. He then returns to his small rundown flat in modern-day France. The film concludes with the caption that from 1959 pensions for servicemen from France's overseas possessions living in France enjoyed no increases after the date their country of origin became independent.

Death of a President (2006 film)
 Broadcast in the year 2008, the film is presented in a TV documentary style format, combining [[pundit (expert)|talking head]] interviews, news coverage clips and [[video surveillance]] footage surrounding the assassination of U.S. President George W. Bush in [[Chicago]] around a year earlier on 19 October 2007. The president is fatally shot by a [[sniper]] after he addresses an [[Economics|economic]] forum at the Chicago [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotel]], before which an [[anti-war]] rally had taken place. News outlets immediately begin reporting on the incident along with its political ramifications. After authorities earlier arrest and interrogate war-protesting detainees, Jamal Abu Zikri (Malik Bader), an [[Information technology|IT]] professional of [[Syrian people|Syrian]] origin,  becomes the prime suspect.  [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]], now president, uses the possible [[al-Qaeda]] relationship in connection with the suspected assassin, Zikri, to push his own domestic political security agenda. He calls for the legislation of [[USA PATRIOT Act|PATRIOT Act]] III, trying to increase the investigative powers of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], the [[Law enforcement in the United States|police]], and other government agencies over U.S. [[citizen]]s and resident aliens as he contemplates attacking Syria.  As his wife Zahra (Hend Ayoub) listens to the verdict with family attorney Dawn Norton (Patricia Buckley) in a packed courtroom, Zikri is convicted of killing the U.S. President and [[death sentence|sentenced to death]] based upon dubious [[Forensics|forensic]] evidence. Meanwhile, a new report which surfaces, substantiated by interviews with Marianne Claybon (Chavez Ravine), indicates that the perpetrator is most likely her husband Al Claybon (Tony Dale), a veteran of the [[Gulf War|1991 Persian Gulf War]], who lived in [[Rock Island, Illinois]], and who also was the father of David Claybon, a U.S. soldier recently killed in the [[Iraq War]]. The assassin, who blames President Bush for the death of his son, killed himself after Bush's assassination. Claybon's suicide note, addressed to a second son, Casey Claybon (Neko Parham), an Iraq War veteran living in Chicago who was previously considered as a suspect, reads:    Ten months after President Bush's assassination, Zikri remains on [[death row]] at the [[Stateville Correctional Center]], because [[government]] officials are deliberately delaying his legal appeal. Moreover, in his dead father's Rock Island house, Casey Claybon finds evidence of his father's planning of the shooting. The most incriminating piece of evidence is a copy of a [[classified information|top secret]] presidential itinerary outlining, to the minute, President Bush's Chicago whereabouts on 19 October 2007. The news report ends while the U.S. Government continues investigating how presidential assassin Al Claybon obtained that top secret document.  The final closing titles of the film inform the viewer that President Cheney's USA PATRIOT Act III was signed into permanent law in the U.S., stating the following: ''"It has granted investigators unprecedented powers of detention and surveillance, and further expanded the powers of the [[executive (government)|executive branch]]"''.  
The Dead Girl
 The story is presented in five parts, each bearing a title: * '''''The Stranger:''''' Arden (Colette) lives with her [[child abuse|abusive]], invalid mother (Laurie). One day she discovers the naked body of a dead woman on the property. Arden becomes a minor celebrity, drawing the attention of Rudy (Ribisi), who tells her the dead woman is the victim of a [[serial killer]] preying on young women in the area. Rudy asks Arden out. Arden gets into a fight with her mother, which compels her to finally leave home. Arden has her date with Rudy. In the morning, Arden calls the police to report a woman (her mother) left alone at home. * '''''The Sister:''''' Leah (Byrne) is prepping the dead woman in the morgue when she notices a certain birthmark. Leah suspects that the dead woman is her sister, Jenny, who was taken from a nearby park fifteen years ago. She asks the sheriff to match the dental records. She is certain the dead woman is her missing sister, but Leah's parents (Steenburgen, [[Bruce Davison]]) refuse to believe that Jenny is dead. The sheriff delivers the test result: the dead woman is ''not'' Jenny. Therefore the episode title was a [[red herring]]. * '''''The Wife:''''' Ruth (Hurt) is angry that her husband, Carl ([[Nick Searcy]]), constantly leaves her alone night after night. The next morning, she discovers clothing, wallets, and [[Identification card|ID]]'s in ziplock bags inside a storage unit that is supposedly empty. She matches the IDs to names in the newspapers of a serial killer's victims. Carl comes back late at night with scratches on his neck. After another argument, he leaves the house to go to the car outside. He pulls a trash bag out of the trunk and goes to the storage unit. Ruth asks Carl if he knows anything about the missing women, and he says no. Later that night, Ruth enters the unit and pulls everything out. She drives to the police station, but doesn't follow through with her plan to present the evidence she found to the authorities; instead Ruth returns home to burn the evidence. * '''''The Mother:''''' The dead woman has been identified as Krista Kutcher. Melora (Harden), Krista's mother, is notified. Melora goes to Krista's previous house and finds Rosetta (Washington), Krista's former roommate. During a tense conversation with Rosetta, Melora learns that her daughter had been a prostitute, that she gave birth to a daughter, and that Melora's late husband had [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her. The following day, Melora takes Krista's daughter home with her. * '''''The Dead Girl:''''' Krista (Murphy) buys her daughter a stuffed animal for her third birthday. One of her johns, Tarlow (Brolin), promises to drive her to Norwalk, where her daughter is, but he backs out at the last minute. Krista goes back to her room and finds Rosetta &mdash; implied to be her lover &mdash; severely beaten. Krista believes the culprit to be a man named Tommy (Dennis Keiffer). Krista vandalizes Tommy's car and, when he tries to stop her, she beats him up and leaves on a borrowed motorcycle. Krista calls Rosetta, and tearfully asks if Rosetta cares about her; Rosetta doesn't reply, and Krista hangs up, saddened and hurt. When the motorcycle breaks down on the highway, Krista hitches a ride from Carl. The film ends with Krista smiling, and happily talking about her daughter.

After a chance encounter at the gym, Tom is offered a job working as a door man for the same run-down night club as Paul ([[Paul Barber (actor)|Paul Barber]]), a tough-looking man who likes to use his [[knuckle duster]].  Paul is a volatile man with a history of violence. After learning of Tom's background in [[boxing]] he takes him under his [[wing]] to teach him the ways of being a door man. Tom soon falls in love with the [[barmaid]] for the club and his loyalties are put to the ultimate test as Paul gets increasingly more in trouble with violent [[gangsters]] from the area.  
Death Note (2006 film)
 Within the Kanto region of Japan, [[Light Yagami]], an intelligent yet somewhat disaffected Japanese college student stumbles across a mysterious dark-colored notebook, with the words "Death Note" marked on the cover, while returning home from his classes. The Death Note's instructions claim that if a person's name is written within while picturing that person's face, that person will die. Light is initially skeptical of the Death Note's authenticity, but after experimenting with it on a convicted criminal, he realizes it is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a ''[[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]]'' named [[Ryuk (Death Note)|Ryuk]], Light seeks to become "god of the new world" by passing his judgment on those he deems to be evil or who get in his way. He begins using the Death Note to kill scores of criminals around the world, becoming a world-famous and notorious [[serial killer]] known as "Kira."  As the Kira killings continue, some in Japanese society come to see Kira as a righteous figure. [[Interpol]] launches an investigation of the murders, but months pass without any fruitful lead. The case eventually attracts the attention of [[L (Death Note)|L]], a reclusive, enigmatic and world-renowned criminal profiler. Working with Interpol and the Japanese police force, L manages to confront Light through a television broadcast and demonstrates his deductive skills, correctly surmising Kira's residence in the [[Kanto region]] and that he can "kill without lifting a finger." The race begins between L and Light to discover each other's identity, and a game of cat and mouse ensues between the two geniuses.  After Light hacks into the police database to find information on acquitted criminals, L realizes that Kira is somehow related to the Kira task force led by Light's father Soichiro. Light finds out that he is being followed by an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent named Raye Iwamatsu and, through a series of events, kills him and his fellow agents. Raye's fiance, Naomi Misora, takes it upon herself to uncover Kira's identity. Suspecting Light, she kidnaps his girlfriend Shiori and demands that he confess if he wants to save her. Light adamantly insists that he is not Kira. When Shiori tries to escape, Naomi shoots her and commits suicide. Shiori dies in Light's arms.  Ryuk finds that Light had actually engineered Naomi's death using the Death Note, as he had already found out her identity and written a scenario whereby Naomi would commit suicide after shooting Shiori. Ryuk is confused that Light would deliberately put Shiori in danger, but Light reveals that he had written her name in the Death Note as well. Using these events to foster hatred for Kira, Light asks to join his father's task force. While Soichiro is slightly reluctant, L immediately grants his wish and it is hinted that he is still certain that Light is Kira.  As a precursor to the second movie, Misa, an actress, is chased down an alley by a man wielding a knife, intent on killing her. As she screams for help, the man dies of a heart attack just like Kira's victims. A second Death Note lands beside her.  
Death Note 2: The Last Name
 Misa receives a Death Note from Rem, another Shinigami. As Light joins the task force after Shiori's funeral, Misa becomes the Second Kira and forces a TV station to broadcast her taped messages. Misa, using her Shinigami Eyes, looks through the TV screen and kills a critic of Kira, as well as Detective Mogi and two policemen, who were trying to disperse a rally of Kira's supporters. Light's younger sister Sayu is almost killed, but Soichiro crashes into the festival wearing a motorcycle helmet, which prevents Misa from seeing his face. Light arrives to comfort Sayu and Soichiro, but is spotted by Misa, who correctly identifies Light as Kira. Misa approaches Light near his home, requesting to be his girlfriend and to join his mission to cleanse the world. Seeing that she has Shinigami Eyes, Light accepts her help, and sets up a meeting between her and L, in the hope of learning L's true name. However, Misa is arrested by L because of evidence connecting her to the taped messages. Fearing that Misa will confess, Light arranges for himself and Misa to forfeit their Death Notes, thereby losing their memory. Light buries his Death Note, while Rem gives the other Death Note to Takada, a reporter covering the Kira case. His plan is to sit in jail while Kira's killings are continued by Takada, thereby convincing the police of his innocence.  After some time, Light and Misa are released, but kept under surveillance by L. Light finds a clue leading to Takada, and assists the police-team in arresting her. As a result, the police learns of the existence of Death Notes and Shinigami. By touching the Death Note, Light regains his memories, and he proceeds to kill Takada using a fragment of a Death Note hidden inside his watch. Earlier, Light had written a fake rule into the Death Note stating that, once a person writes a name, he must keep writing names every thirteen days or perish. The police, believing this rule to be real, consider Light and Misa as being completely exonerated, as they were in custody for much longer than thirteen days.  Light asks Misa to uncover the buried Death Note to kill L. Misa, having forgotten L's name, resumes Kira's killing spree instead. With suspicion falling upon Misa, Rem is forced to kill Watari and L to protect Misa from being arrested again. Since Shinigami are not allowed to protect humans, the action results in Rem's death. For the sake of halting the police-investigation into Kira, Light proceeds to write his own father's name into his Death Note, much to Misa's horror. Strangely, his father doesn't die, and Light is surrounded by the police at gunpoint. L also emerges, revealing that he wrote his own name into the Death Note, scheduling his death a month in advance. As a result, he became immune to further writings in the Death Note. When Watari died, L pretended to die. Furthermore, the Death Note which Light attempted to use to kill his father was fake. Light, being cornered, pleads with Ryuk to kill the people surrounding him, but Ryuk decides to kill Light instead. He reveals to Light that any human who owns a Death Note is banned from Heaven and Hell, and will instead spend eternity as nothingness. Light dies in his father's arms, begging his father to believe that his actions were for the sake of justice. The police decided to cover up the truth, and to announce that Kira killed Light and then himself. Twenty days later, Soichiro meets L one last time before L peacefully passes away. One year later, on Light's birthday, Soichiro maintains the false story to his wife and Sayu, that Kira killed Light. Misa also celebrates Light's birthday, loving him but having no recollection of the Death Note. The film ends with Ryuk flying around the Tokyo Tower and laughing.  
Dead and Deader
 After communications to a small medical outpost in [[Cambodia]] was cut off, a U.S. special-forces squad was sent to investigate. As they approach the outpost they are attacked by zombies. As the zombies are dispatched, Lieutenant Bobby Quinn survives with heavy injuries. He radios for a medivac airlift, then falls unconscious.  Quinn wakes up on an exam table at Ft. Preston Army Base. The shocked coroner explains that he arrived in a body-bag and had been pronounced [[Dead on arrival|DOA]]. Suddenly feeling a pain in his right arm, Quinn grabs a scalpel and cuts it open. Gushing out of the wound is green blood and a strange scorpion, which he crushes. The incision then rapidly heals, and Quinn finds that he now possesses superhuman strength. He also begins feeling intense hunger that can only be dulled by ingesting raw, red meat.  Quinn fights his way out of the army base and leaves to find his fellow squad-members. He stops at a small road-side bar and meets Holly, a part-time bartender. The local news had aired a report about the killings at Fort Preston, labeling Quinn a suspect. The bar patrons lock him inside the cooler. The bar is then attacked by Zombies. Holly frees Quinn, and they fight their way out.  Quinn eventually learns that a doctor named Dr. Scott plans to use the scorpion venom to revive dead tissues and sell for a profit. Quinn and Holly follow Dr. Scott back to Ft. Preston, where Scott is killed by zombies attempting to extract a scorpion. After destroying the scorpion and killing all of the zombies, Holly and Quinn escape from the base and leave.  Outside the base, Quinn and Holly lure zombies toward the armory, blowing it up using a stash of ammunition. They narrowly escape as the base goes up in flames. After making sure no zombies survive, they walk away together.  
Dead in 3 Days
  While celebrating their high school graduation, Nina, her boyfriend Martin, and their friends Mona, Clemens, and Alex each receive an anonymous [[Text messaging|text message]] telling them that they will be dead in three days. The quintet dismiss the threat as a prank up until Martin is found at the bottom of a lake, having been abducted from a dance and thrown into the water while tied to a weight. Patrick, an [[Outcast (person)|outcast]] and Martin's rival, is questioned as a suspect, but is released due to a lack of evidence indicating any involvement on his part in Martin's death.  Martin's killer captures Nina and attempts to drown her, but she is saved by Patrick, who the murderer stabs to death while Nina escapes. As Nina recovers in a hospital, the killer decapitates Alex by slamming her onto the frayed edge of a fish tank. Nina identifies her attacker as Manfred Haas, the father of Fabian Haas, a childhood friend who had died due to falling through a frozen lake that he was playing ice hockey on with her, Martin, Mona, Clemens, and Alex.  The police inform Nina that Manfred hanged himself two years after his son's death, and that his wife moved away, though she still owns a house nearby. Nina, Mona, and Clemens sneak out to explore the Haas property, and are followed by Nina's sister, Kerstin. The killer binds and gags Kerstin, and is revealed to be Mrs. Haas, who is attempting to avenge her son's death (which occurred three days after he fell through the ice) while wearing a mask fashioned out of her dead husband's preserved face.  Mrs. Haas fatally stabs Clemens, knocks Nina out, and chases Mona, who falls off of a balcony and onto a spiked fence. Unaware that Mona survived and has gone for help, Mrs. Haas leaves with Nina, and rows out to the middle of a lake, which she intends to drown Nina, and herself, in. Nina stabs Mrs. Haas and knocks her overboard, but is pulled into the water along with her. Divers save and resuscitate Nina, who they bring to the same hospital that Mona is in, while she flashes back to how she and her friends had taunted Fabian into skating onto thin ice, running off when he fell through it.  
Déjà Vu (2006 film)
 On [[Mardi Gras]] in [[New Orleans]], the ferry ''Sen. Alvin T. Stumpf'' is carrying hundreds of [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] sailors and their families across the [[Mississippi River]] from their base to the city. Suddenly, the ferry explodes and sinks, killing 543 passengers and crew members.  Special Agent Douglas Carlin ([[Denzel Washington]]) from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) is sent to investigate and discovers evidence of a bomb planted by a domestic terrorist. Arriving at the scene he meets with local investigators and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Paul Pryzwarra ([[Val Kilmer]]), and informs them of his findings. He learns about and is invited to examine a partially burned body pulled from the river, identified as Claire Kuchever ([[Paula Patton]]), which was reported to the authorities minutes before the explosion.  Pryzwarra is impressed with Doug's detective expertise, and asks him to join a newly formed governmental detective unit whose first case is to investigate the bombing. Led by Dr. Alexander Denny ([[Adam Goldberg]]), they investigate the events before the explosion by using a program called "Snow White", which enables them to look into the past (4 days, 6 hours, 3 minutes, 45 seconds, 14.5 nanoseconds) in detail by (according to Pryzwarra) using several satellites to form a triangulated image of events. The system is limited in that they can only see past events once; there is no fast forwarding or rewinding, although they can record what they see in the process. Convinced that Claire is a vital link, Doug persuades them to focus on her. While the team observes Claire's past through "Snow White", the bomber calls her to talk about the SUV that she advertised for sale. He doesn't buy her car, but the "Snow White" team now knows exactly where and when he was during the call.  Doug finds out "Snow White" is actually a time window, and can send inanimate objects into the past. Despite Denny's protests against tampering with the past, Doug has the team send a note back to his past self with the time and place to stop the ferry bomber. Instead, his partner Larry Minuti gets the note and while following up on it is shot by the terrorist. The team attempts to follow the fleeing terrorist, who takes Minuti with him, but he moves outside of Snow White's range. However, Doug is able to follow him in the present using a specially equipped vehicle with a mobile Snow White unit. In the past time, the bomber takes Minuti to his bayou shack where he kills him and sets fire to his body. Still needing a vehicle big enough to hold the bomb the terrorist goes to Claire's address, kidnaps her and takes her car.  Using a [[facial recognition system]], the ferry bomber is identified and taken into custody. He turns out to be Carroll Oerstadt ([[Jim Caviezel]]), who is angry at the military after being turned down for joining by both the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]]s and [[United States Army|Army]], because their medical screening showed he was unstable. Considering the case now closed, the government shuts down the Snow White investigation. Despite the killer having been caught, Claire and the ferry victims remain dead, which unsettles Doug since he is convinced that the Snow White team can actually [[Alternate history|alter history]]. Doug persuades Denny to do one last experiment: send Doug to the past to save Claire and stop the bombing; a risky procedure, since no human has ever been sent back. Doug survives the trip, because he was sent back to a hospital emergency room, where they were able to revive him. He steals an ambulance and races to Oerstadt's shack just in time to stop Claire's murder, while Oerstadt flees with the bomb.  Doug and Claire go to the ferry. Doug boards to try to find and disarm the bomb, but meanwhile Oerstadt captures Claire. Claire is tied up in the bomb car with her mouth gagged with duct tape. A brutal gunfight ensues which culminates with Doug attempting to negotiate with Oerstadt but finally catching him off guard and killing him. He gets into the car to try to free Claire but police surround the vehicle and threaten to open fire. To save everyone, Doug and Claire purposely drive the bomb SUV off the end of the ferry before it explodes. Claire escapes but Doug, unable to get out of the vehicle, dies in the underwater explosion. As Claire mourns Doug's death, she is approached by an identical Doug Carlin, the one from her present, who consoles her.  
Deck the Halls (2006 film)
 In a small Massachusetts town, local [[optometry|optometrist]] and Christmas expert Steve Finch ([[Matthew Broderick]]) wants his kids to have a great Christmas, packed with Steve's tried-and-true traditions such as using an Advent calendar, taking Christmas card pictures in matching sweaters, and getting a large [[Christmas tree|tree]]. In the dead of night on December 1, new neighbors move in across the street. Steve meets car salesman Buddy Hall ([[Danny DeVito]]) and his wife Tia ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]) the next morning when Buddy steals Steve's paper. Later that day, Steve's wife Kelly ([[Kristin Davis]]) and her daughter Madison ([[Alia Shawkat]]) and son Carter (Dylan Blue) go to the Hall house, where they meet their teenage twin daughters, Ashley (Sabrina Aldridge) and Emily (Kelly Aldridge). Tia and Kelly immediately become friends, as do Ashley, Emily, and Madison.   That night, Buddy complains to Tia that while he can sell anything, he gets bored quickly. On discovering that the neighborhood can be seen on satellite photos via a website called MyEarth (seemingly a [[parody]] of [[Google Earth]]) but that his house is not visible, Buddy decides to make it visible using Christmas lights. As his display grows bigger, including live animals, it gets Buddy known around town, upsetting Steve and threatening his position as "the Christmas guy" and chairman of the town's WinterFest. Enmity grows between the men; in various incidents, Steve's Christmas-card photo is ruined, his car doors are ripped off, and his private Christmas-tree lot is destroyed. Eventually Buddy's house is completely lit, and even synchronized to music. Steve attempts to deflate the light show by filling Buddy's fusebox with snow, but a backup generator foils his plan. Buddy discovers the sabotage and gets back at Steve by stealing the town Christmas tree and putting it in Steve's house, and "buying" him a car -- for which he forged Steve's signature to a loan for which Steve is on the hook.   Buddy and Steve make a bet: if Steve beats Buddy in the WinterFest [[speedskating]] race, then Buddy removes the lights, and if Buddy beats Steve, Steve pays for the car. Buddy wins, and Steve yells at him for being a nobody, since his house is still not visible from space. Hurt, Buddy compensates by buying a huge amount of programmable LED lights. He pays for this by hocking Tia's expensive heirloom vase, and Tia and the girls depart. Having had enough, Steve buys a variety of [[firework]]s including a large, illegal, military-grade rocket from a gangster and tries to blow up the Hall house. The rocket misfires, setting the Finch house on fire, and Steve's family leaves. Steve and Buddy forget their rivalry and build a winter wonderland with all of Buddy's lights. They lure Tia, Kelly, and the kids home and all sit down to a nice meal.  Soon the whole town helps put Buddy's lights back up in time for a story about them on [[MTV]]. They do not work, and everyone sings carols and uses their cell phones as flashlights. As they sing, Carter notices that one of the plugs is not plugged in properly, which explains why the lights did not work. He tightly plugs it in, causing the lights to shine brightly through the night. [[SuChin Pak]], who is doing the MTV report, gets confirmation from MyEarth that the house is indeed visible from space. The crowd celebrates as the film ends.  
Deepfrozen

The Death of Poe
 After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a [[hallucination]] where he is [[premature burial|buried alive]].  He prepares to take a trip to [[New York City]] via a ferry steamboat from [[Richmond, Virginia]], to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine ''[[The Stylus]]''.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.   Poe is depicted as having some type of [[memory loss]], which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local [[tavern]] rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at [[West Point]].  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised $1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his [[Prospectus (book)|prospectus]] for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the $1,000 he had collected.  An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a [[cooping]] ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.  A couple of victims of the [[scam]] die amidst the brutality of their captors.  Afterwards, Poe is released and he eventually collapses in the street and is found by a local tavern owner.  The man calls for Poe's uncle Henry Herring and Dr. Joseph Snodgrass.  The men discuss what to do with the incoherent, half-conscious Poe.  Snodgrass assumes he is drunk and suggests they let him sleep it off - a theory the film seems to dispute by showing him early in the film declining offered [[alcohol]] several times.  Herring becomes more concerned and demands Poe be taken to Washington College Hospital, despite the expense.  At the hospital, Dr. John Moran tends to Poe, unable to accurately determine his situation or the cause of his failing health, or how he received his injuries.  He muses to his wife, Mrs. Moran, that he does not want to be known as the physician who killed Edgar Allan Poe.  Over the next three days, the bedridden Poe is kept in seclusion in a private room as Moran denies Poe visitors, including his Baltimore cousin Nielson Poe, who becomes convinced that his cousin is about to die.  Poe ultimately does die after one final hallucination or perhaps a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] where he sees his dead wife [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]].

The Departed
  As a child, Colin Sullivan is introduced to [[organized crime]] by Irish-American mobster Frank Costello in the Irish neighborhood of [[South Boston]]. Over the years, Costello grooms him to become a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] inside the [[Massachusetts State Police]]. Sullivan is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit, which focuses on organized crime.  Before graduating from the state [[police academy]], Billy Costigan is recruited by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam to go undercover, as his family ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. He drops out of the academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.  Each man infiltrates his respective target organization. Sullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan sees her as a condition of his probation, and they begin a relationship, too. After Costello escapes a [[sting operation]], each mole becomes aware of the other's existence. Sullivan is told to find the "[[Informant|rat]]" and asks Costello for information to identify the informer.  Costigan follows Costello into a [[Adult movie theater|porn theater]], where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope containing personal information on his crew members. Costigan chases Sullivan through [[Chinatown]]. When it is over, neither man knows the other's identity. Sullivan has Queenan tailed to a meeting with Costigan on the roof of a building. Queenan orders Costigan to flee while he confronts Costello's men alone. The men throw Queenan off the building to his death. When they exit, Costigan pretends he has come to join them. Television news reveals that crew member Delahunt has been an undercover cop, working for the [[Boston Police Department]]. Dignam resigns rather than work with Sullivan. Dignam suspects Sullivan is the mole after Dignam asks Sullivan why he had Queenan followed.   Using Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary of Costello's role as an informant for the [[FBI]], causing him to worry about his own identity being revealed. With Costigan's help, Costello is traced to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between Costello's crew and the police. Most of the crew are killed. Costello, confronted by Sullivan, admits he is an FBI informant. Costello tries to shoot Sullivan, but Sullivan shoots him multiple times. With Costello dead, Sullivan is applauded the next day by everyone on the force. In good faith, Costigan comes to Sullivan for restoration of his true identity and to be paid for his work, but notices the envelope from Costello on Sullivan's desk and flees, finally realizing Sullivan is the enemy. Fearing retaliation, Sullivan erases Costigan's records from the police computer system.  Sullivan is unaware that Madolyn had an affair with Costigan when she tells Sullivan that she is pregnant. Later, Sullivan finds her listening to a CD from Costigan containing incriminating recorded conversations between Costello and Sullivan. Sullivan unsuccessfully attempts to assuage her suspicions. He contacts Costigan, who reveals that Costello had recorded each of their conversations, and his attorney arranged for Costigan to take possession of the recordings, and Costigan intends to implicate Sullivan. The two agree to meet at the building where Queenan died.  On the roof, Costigan catches Sullivan off-guard and handcuffs him. As Costigan had secretly arranged, Trooper Brown appears on the roof as well. Shocked, Brown draws his gun on Costigan, who attempts to justify his actions by exposing Sullivan as Costello's mole. Costigan asks Brown why Dignam did not accompany him as Costigan had requested, but Brown does not answer. Costigan leads Sullivan, his hostage, to the elevator. When it reaches the ground floor, Trooper Barrigan shoots Costigan in the head, then shoots Brown, and afterward reveals to Sullivan that Costello had more than one mole in the police. Sullivan shoots and kills Barrigan. At state police headquarters, Sullivan identifies Barrigan as the mole and has Costigan posthumously given the Medal of Merit.  At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices that Madolyn is tearful. As they leave the gravesite, Sullivan attempts to talk to her, but she ignores him. When Sullivan returns to his apartment, he is ambushed by Dignam, who shoots and kills him as he enters.

Delirious (2006 film)
  Toby and Les meet when Toby interrupts a crowd of paparazzi waiting to take pictures of pop diva K'harma Leeds ([[Allison Lohman]]).  Les requests that Toby go get coffee for himself and two of his colleagues.  On his way back with coffee, Toby is stopped by K'harma's agents from the inside of a building and asked to see if the photographers are looking.    After the photographers look away, the agents guide K'harma past Toby towards a car.  The photographers catch on and rush towards the car, colliding with Toby and spilling some coffee.  Later that night, Toby approaches Les outside his apartment, scaring him.  He claims that he was bringing his change back from the coffee, but eventually asks to stay with him that night, saying that he is really cold and doesn't have a place to stay. The next day, Toby offers to be his assistant for free, which Les accepts. Later that night, after being thrown out of a party, Les and Toby overhear a celebrity's agent talking about where his client is getting surgery done on his [[penis]]. Toby writes down the address, and they show up there the next day. After waiting for quite some time, Les gets a shot of the celebrity, referring to it as "[[the shot heard 'round the world]]", although he only gets $700 for it.  Les offers to take Toby's headshots free of charge to help him start out his dream of being an actor. Eventually, their partnership begins to wear thin after K'harma takes Toby backstage without Les, angering the latter. The next day, at Les' apartment, Toby gets a call from K'harma, who invites him to her birthday party. Toby agrees on the condition that he can bring Les along, making it up to him.  At the party, however, even after agreeing not to do so, Les takes pictures of K'harma with [[Elvis Costello]], getting him and Toby thrown out. Toby is extremely angry at Les, who feigns dropping his camera's memory card into a cup of coffee (unbeknownst to Toby, Les ejects his camera's battery instead) and offers to print up Toby's headshots and show them to a few people. The next day, Toby says his stomach hurts and that he cannot go with Les. After he leaves, Toby tries to leave after him only to find that Les has locked him in. He then walks into Les' room and gets on his computer, discovering the pictures of K'harma and Elvis Costello on it. Feeling betrayed, Toby escapes by way of unhinging the apartment door.  Later, we see Toby walking through the park, seemingly homeless again, until a couple nears him. He runs up to the man, and stabs him in the stomach. The woman tries to talk him out of killing her, but forgets her line. A bell rings, and it is revealed that the park is a film set, and Toby is the lead character. Les repeatedly tries to talk to Toby by calling Toby's agent until Toby finally speaks to him. Les offers to apologize over coffee, but Toby declines. Soon, Toby professes his love for K'harma on film, which skyrockets his popularity.  A jealous Les soon finds a vintage camera in his apartment, which his father gave to him. The camera is actually a hidden gun, and he resolves to murder Toby with it. At the premiere of Toby's latest film, he walks down the red carpet with K'harma. Les shows up, and raises the camera, getting ready to shoot him, but then sees him kissing K'harma, and stops. As he is trying to leave the crowd, Toby sees him and asks him to come back. They shake hands, and Les takes his picture up close. Les tells Toby to go, and Toby walks down the red carpet into the premiere. Les, although disappointed that recognition still eludes him, is proud of Toby's fame.  After the credits, Les is shown on a Hollywood talk show discussing his picture of Toby, which the interviewer refers to as "the shot heard 'round the world".  
The Devil Wears Prada (film)
 Andy is an aspiring [[journalism|journalist]] fresh out of [[Northwestern University]]. Despite her ridicule for the shallowness of the fashion industry, she lands a job as junior [[personal assistant]] to [[Miranda Priestly]], the editor-in-chief of ''Runway'' magazine. Andy plans to put up with Miranda's excessive demands and humiliating treatment for one year in the hopes of getting a job as a reporter or writer somewhere else.  At first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her gossipy, fashion-conscious co-workers, especially Miranda's senior assistant, Emily Charlton. However, she does find an ally in art director Nigel, and gradually learns her responsibilities and begins to dress more stylishly to show her effort and commitment to the position. She also meets an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who offers to help her with her career. As she spends increasing amounts of time at Miranda's beck and call, problems arise in her relationships with her college friends and her live-in boyfriend, Nate, a [[chef]] working his way up the career ladder.  Miranda is impressed by Andy and allows her to be the one to bring the treasured "Book", a mock-up of the upcoming edition, to her home, along with her dry cleaning. She is given instructions by Emily about where to leave the items and is told not to speak with anyone in the home. Andy arrives at Miranda's home only to discover that the instructions she received are vague. As she tries to figure out what to do, Andy begins to panic. Miranda's twins, Caroline and Cassidy, falsely tell her she can leave the book at the top of the stairs just as Emily has done on many occasions. At the top of the stairs, Andy interrupts Miranda and her husband having an argument. Mortified, Andy leaves the book and runs out of the home.  The next day, Miranda tells Andy that she wants the new unpublished ''[[Harry Potter (series)|Harry Potter]]'' book for her daughters and, if Andy cannot find a copy, she will be fired. Andy desperately attempts to find the book and nearly gives up, but ultimately obtains it through Christian's contacts. She surprises Miranda by not only finding the book but having copies sent to the girls at the train station, leaving no doubt that she accomplished Miranda's "impossible" task, thus saving her job. Andy gradually begins to outperform Emily at her job, and slowly but surely becomes more glamorous and begins aligning herself, unwittingly at first, to the '' Runway'' philosophy.  One day, Andy saves Miranda from being embarrassed at a charity benefit, and Miranda rewards her by offering to take her to the fall fashion shows in [[Paris]] instead of Emily. Andy hesitates to take this privilege away from Emily but is forced to accept the offer after being told by Miranda that she will lose her job if she declines. Andy tries to tell Emily on her way to work, but Emily gets hit by a car. Andy later breaks the news to a hospitalized Emily.  When Andy tells Nate she is going to Paris, he is angered by her refusal to admit that she's become what she once ridiculed, and they break up. Once there, Miranda, without makeup, opens up to Andy about the effect Miranda's impending divorce will have on her daughters. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that he has accepted a job as Creative Director with rising fashion star James Holt at Miranda's recommendation. Andy finally succumbs to Christian's charms and, after spending the night with him, learns from him about a plan to replace Miranda with Jacqueline Follet as editor of ''Runway''. Despite the suffering she has endured at her boss's behest, she attempts to warn Miranda.  At a luncheon later that day, however, Miranda announces that it is Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave ''Runway'' for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she explains to a still-stunned Andy that she was grateful for the warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the [[Place de la Concorde]], leaving Miranda, ''Runway'', and fashion behind.  Some time later, Andy meets up with Nate, who is moving to Boston because he got a new job as the sous chef of a restaurant. They agree to start dating again and see what the future holds. The same day, Andy is interviewed and is accepted to work at a major New York publication company. The editor recounts how he called ''Runway'' for a reference on Andy, and got a response from Miranda herself. Miranda described Andy as "her biggest disappointment"- and said that the editor would be "an idiot" if he didn't hire her. Emily is offered her Paris wardrobe by Andy and the two leave on good terms. Andy passes the "Runway" office building and sees Miranda get into a car. Andy gives a wave, but Miranda does not acknowledge her. Andy is used to this and instead walks further into the crowd. Once inside the car, however, Miranda smiles and then orders her chauffeur to drive.

Stephen King's Desperation (film)
 In the Nevada desert, a couple, Peter and Mary Jackson are driving just as they are stopped by a sheriff, Collie Entragian. He soon learns they are in possession of [[marijuana]]. (It is implied later that Entragian planted the marijuana in their car). He takes them to jail. After they enter the police station, they see a little girl, dead, on the floor and Entragian shoots and kills Peter. Mary is thrown in a jail cell along with a young boy, David Carver, his parents, Ralph and Ellen, and an old man, Tom Billingsley. The little girl is the Carver's daughter, named Pie. In the meantime, in the police station, David kneels and prays to God, his practice since his best friend Brian was struck by a drunk driver. For the duration of the film, David is a mouth piece for commonplace [[Judaeo-Christian]] values.  Meanwhile, Steve Ames is in his truck, following famous author Johnny Marinville, who is some 50 miles up ahead. Ames is Marinville's assistant. Steve soon picks up a young female hitchhiker named Cynthia Smith. Johnny stops in the desert to urinate just as Entragian shows up behind him and plants the same bag of marijuana he got from Peter and Mary in Johnny's motorcycle bag and arrests him.   Back in the Police Station, David is asked by his mother Ellen why he kept on praying. David revealed that he prays because God made 'his' presence known to him by miraculously saving his friend Brian from the brink of death. He then recollects that when he and Brian were riding a bike, a drunk driver hit Brian. David immediately began praying to God, offering to sacrifice anything, and to do what ever is asked of him in order that his friend be saved, at which point, Brian miraculously regained consciousness. The doctor at the hospital described Brian's recovery as "miraculous".  Later, David realizes Entragian's skin is breaking out and he keeps saying "Tak" because he is possessed. Entragian then takes Ellen so he can shift his spirit into her body. He leaves his vicious dog to guard the cells. Pie's ghost appears and gives David a bar of [[soap]] which glows green. David scrubs his body with the soap and while the dog is distracted, slips through the bars of the jail cell and escapes the holding area. David searches the police station and finds a gun on the corpse of another sheriff. He returns and shoots the guard dog, freeing everyone.  Meanwhile, Steve drives up to where Johnny was captured by Entragian. He and Cynthia find Johnny's motorcycle hidden behind dry bushes. Cynthia and Steve later search the town, finding all the residents dead. That night, they both meet up with other escaped prisoners from the jail. They gather at a disused theater and Tom tells a story that took place 120 years ago, when Chinese workers digging in a local mine known as 'The China Pit' discovered an evil spirit named "Tak". The now-possessed Ellen sends in a mountain lion and Tom is killed. Mary is then possessed by Ellen so that Tak can have a new body.  David sees Pie's ghost in the theater again. She leads him to the movie editing machine where old footage (apparently supernatural/visionary) reveals the truth of how Tak came to the town. Mary wakes up to find herself trapped in a shed, surrounded by rattlesnakes, scorpions and tarantulas, waiting to be the next host for Tak. With the help of Pie, she manages to escape, while seriously injuring Ellen's body. Tak is forced to take over the body of a [[buzzard]].  Johnny later confesses that 40 years ago in Vietnam he saw a guy, possessed by Tak, blow up the bathroom of a bar, killing 87 people. Johnny still feels guilty to this day that he did not warn any of the patrons before fleeing the bar. The group decides to return to the cave with some explosives they found to put an end to Tak. At the entrance, the buzzard comes out and kills Ralph. In order to redeem himself, Johnny goes into the mine and falls in a hole leading to a pit where Tak is. Johnny ignites the explosives, blowing up the mine and giving up his life, while the rest of survivors drive away in Steve's truck.  Along the route driving away from the town, they pass by the empty RV vehicle owned by David's family and Peter's sister's car. Mary tells Steve to stop the truck to retrieve an overnight case from the car. In the back seat Mary finds a photo album belonging to David with a frontispiece picture of Johnny and Pie together, which Steve identifies as being signed by Johnny.

A Dirty Carnival
 [[File:A Dirty Carnoval allusion to Gangs of New York.JPG|left|thumb|250px]]  ''A Dirty Carnival'' is the story of Kim Byung-doo, a small-time gangster in his late 20s. Unable to acquire the money necessary to save his family from eviction, Byung-doo subverts his boss, Sang-chul, and takes a job directly from President Hwang, Sang-chul's boss, to eliminate Attorney Park, a public prosecutor who has been bothersome to President Hwang. On this job's completion, Byung-doo receives the money he was hoping for in addition to President Hwang's respect and a spot at his side. Byung-doo and President Hwang swear never to speak of the hit to anyone so that they, and the organization, will not be implicated.  While these events unfold, Byung-doo is reunited with his elementary school friend, Min-ho, who has become a movie director. Min-ho's current project is a gangster film, although prospective scripts are continuously shot down by his higher-ups for being too fake. In an attempt to improve the film's authenticity, Min-ho sets out to interview Byung-doo who he sees as "a real gangster". Meanwhile, Min-ho manages to reunite Byung-doo with his high school love interest, Hyun-joo. Byung-doo finds that he still has an interest in her and attempts to rekindle their relationship.  Sang-chul becomes aware of the Attorney Park murder and feels threatened by Byung-doo's subversion of his authority and lack of consideration for the organization. To test his ultimate allegiance, he has Byung-doo's crew assist a Russian gangster (Hwang's rivals) in transporting sex slaves but falls short when it is ambushed by Hwang's men tipped off by Byung-doo himself.  Hwang  sets up a hit to take out Sang-Chul, while Sang-chul does the same to Byung-doo. Byung-doo murders Sang-chul without much incident.  These murders don't leave Byung-doo without heavy emotional baggage, however. When Byung-doo's gangster tendencies frighten Hyun-joo away, Min-ho attempts to console Byung-doo who reveals to Min-ho his darkest secrets, including the hits on both Attorney Park and his former boss, Sang-chul.  Missing Hyun-joo deeply, Byung-doo tries to hide his gangster tendencies to revive their relationship. However, despite his words to Hyun-joo otherwise, Byung-doo is unable to truly escape the gangster occupation. In fact, as his rank within the gang escalates, his actions become more violent and cruel, juxtaposing his ever-growing affection for Hyun-joo.  Soon Byung-doo discovers that Min-ho's gangster film reenacts many of the events from Byung-doo's past, including the hit on Attorney Park. Realizing the dangers of the organization being implicated, Byung-doo confronts Min-ho and threatens him never to tell anyone, choosing to spare his life despite pleas from his underlings that he do otherwise. These underlings later decide to take matters into their own hands and threaten Min-ho more seriously than Byung-doo was willing to do, but still sparing his life. It is then that Min-ho, deeply disturbed, goes to the police and informs them of the potential threats on his life. The police attempt to arrest Byung-doo but fail. It is then that Byung-doo believes that the proper solution is to eliminate Min-ho once and for all. As Min-ho (and his film) have become quite popular, it will not be an easy job - Byung-doo intends to perform the hit and fly out of the country, escaping the consequences of his actions.  Byung-doo moves to assassinate Min-ho at an after-party for his film. Min-ho manages to escape outside where he is captured by Byung-doo's underlings who are supposed to take Min-ho to a planned location for Byung-doo to meet them at. Upon arrival, Byung-doo is attacked by the Russian's thugs. Despite being outnumbered, Byung-doo manages to stumble away from his attackers, heavily wounded. He appears to be saved as his underlings arrive on the scene, however, they betray Byung-doo and kill him. Notably, Jong-soo, Byung-doo's former right-hand man and his lone accomplice in the Attorney Park murder, is present and appears to be leading the betrayal.  The scene shifts to a meeting with President Hwang and Min-ho, who appears to be alive and well despite being captured by Byung-doo's men. President Hwang discusses potential movie ideas with Min-ho, saying he can draw inspiration from the stories of his past, though they shouldn't be too close to the truth for as he says, "a fiction should remain a fiction", referencing Min-ho's first movie and its connection to Byung-doo's untimely fate. Soon Jong-soo joins the meeting, taking Byung-doo's position at President Hwang's side, showcasing his subversion much in the same way that Byung-doo subverted his own boss, Sang-chul.  The final scene is a repetition from earlier in the film, where Byung-doo visits Min-ho on his movie set to give him advice. Byung-doo encourages Min-ho with the friendly words, "Make something with a real gangster spirit," reinforcing the strength of the friendship and gangster themes running throughout the film.

DOA: Dead or Alive
 A group of martial arts and combat masters are invited to a fighting contest, "Dead or Alive", on an isolated island within an advanced complex, with the ultimate prize of $10 million. Among the competitors are Kasumi, a [[Ninja|shinobi]] ninja-princess looking for her brother Hayate (who was competing in the last tournament), Tina, a professional wrestler setting out to prove she has more potential (complicated by her father Bass  being one of the contenders), Christie, a master thief and assassin, her treacherous partner Maximillian ‘Max’ Marsh, and Hayabusa, a friend of Kasumi and Hayate who follows Kasumi to keep her safe, using the invitation to DOA for this. A final competitor is Helena Douglas, daughter of the tournament’s late founder. When they arrive, they are monitored by the island’s supervisor, Dr. Victor Donovan, who, aided by egghead Weatherby, is gathering data (using injected nano-sensors) from the fights for some mysterious project. To add to the situation, an assassin from Kasumi's colony, named Ayane, has followed Kasumi to kill her and wipe away the disgrace the princess has caused to the clan.  The contest plays out, with multiple contestants fighting and being defeated (including Gen Fu, Bayman, Leon, and Zack), until only Kasumi, Christie, Hayabusa and Tina are left, with Helena being defeated by Christie. During the course of the film, Max and Christie form a plan to steal the fortune stowed away inside a hidden vault. During her fight, Christie sees that the key to finding and unlocking the vault is a tattoo on the back of Helena’s neck. Meanwhile, Kasumi begins to suspect Donovan of lying about her brother being killed in the previous tournament, and Hayabusa, infiltrating the main facility to find the truth, is captured. She is more than once confronted and nearly killed by Ayane, who Kasumi tries to convince that Hayate is alive (since it is eventually clear that Ayane loves Hayate). Also, Weatherby begins to fall for Helena, and in the end tells her about what he knows of the mystery project, and that before Helena’s father could shut the project down, he died (indicating that he was murdered).  On the final day of the tournament, wondering where Hayabusa is, Kasumi, Christie and Tina look for him and discover a secret entrance to the main complex, where they find Hayabusa unconscious. They are then gassed and captured. Meanwhile, Helena resolves to stop the mystery project, and has to fight the armed staff of the island, sent to kill her and Weatherby by Donovan. They are followed inside by Max, who finds his way to the vault, and is then knocked out by Bayman, who is working for Donovan. Inside the main complex, Donovan shows the four semifinalists the project he has been developing; an advanced form of neural interface that allows him and others to use the fighters' combined skills to become the ultimate fighter. After ‘downloading’ the data into the device (shaped like a pair of sunglasses), he then shows that he kept Hayate alive and in peak condition to test the technology. He challenges Hayate to fight and win, if the others are to survive. Hayate accepts and is defeated, then thrown through a wall to die. Hayate is saved by Ayane, and the two of them apparently accept each other.  With the successful demonstration, Donovan prepares to sell the technology around the world, and begins "[[upload|downloading]]" it to the watching buyers. Weatherby stops the broadcast and alerts the [[CIA]], which provokes Donovan to head for them. Helena keeps Donovan back while Weatherby frees the others, but both are defeated and Donovan activates a self-destruct sequence which will obliterate the base. Kasumi, Helena, Christie, Tina, Ayane, and Hayate launch a combined attack on Donovan, while Hayabusa and Weatherby find Max and escape with him, despite Max's urge to go back for the money. During the battle with the fighters, Donovan’s ‘glasses’ are knocked off and he is easily paralyzed by Hayate and Kasumi. The fighters then all escape as the base explodes and Donovan is consumed by the flames, making their escape by a hijacked pirates' boat.  In the final scene, Helena, Ayane, Christie, Tina, and Kasumi are shown together again preparing to fight an army of ninja in Kasumi's palace.

During autumn, Bouquet scolds Ai for not attending Sally's farewell party, which comes as a big surprise. Ai becomes heartbroken, learning that Sally has moved away to embark on a career in fashion design. Ai ends up at the museum café, and ends up crying when K.K. Bossa plays, as the song reminds her of Sally. Bianca scolds Ai, and tells her that she should be happy as a friend for Sally. Ai then responds by saying that she is happy, but she is instead sad that Sally never told her anything, and leaves the café. Sally sends a letter of apology to Ai, explaining that a goodbye would have been too upsetting, and encourages her to embark on her own personal journey. Bouquet apologizes to Ai for her harsh reaction.  Winter comes, and all the pine trees that Ai has planted have fully grown and are decorated with Christmas lights. A spaceship crash-lands in the middle of the forest, and Johnny, a seagull, emerges. Johnny, who had planted the bottles in order to make an entrance dressed as an alien, asks the villagers to help locate some of the pieces that broke off his ship during the descent. Ai, Bouquet, Yū, and Albert head towards a cave, where Yū claims to have seen one of the pieces fall. The entrance, though, is blocked up by a large boulder from a recent event. Though the team tries to move the boulder, it eventually turns out it is too heavy for them to move. Sally then appears and helps unseal the cave.  The five retrieve the missing piece and return to Johnny, who they discover had already obtained them all. The missing piece turns out to be an injured UFO, one of a larger group that was attracted to the village due to the pattern formed by Ai's lit-up pine trees. The injured UFO reunites with its group, and as they depart, create a constellation in the night sky resembling Ai. Ai then wins the Winter Festival contest for the best decoration, leaving her feeling for the first time as a true member of the village.

A [[plesiosaur]] ''[[Futabasaurus]]'' comes out, and Nobita decides to name the plesiosaur Piisuke. Suneo and Gian come looking for Nobita but because Piisuke is still too small, Nobita doesn't show them the plesiosaur and instead makes a deal with them. If he cannot show them a real dinosaur, he would have to eat spaghetti through his nose. Meanwhile, Nobita and Piisuke form a strong bond between them with Nobita working very hard to make sure the baby plesiosaur is well looked after, feeding it his own dinner of [[sashimi]] and playing with it.

The next day, their plan is discovered, Shizuka, Gian and Suneo are captured. Doraemon and Nobita rush to save them and all five have to face being eaten by a ferocious ''Tyrannosaurus''. As he nears, they realize that this was one of the tame dinosaurs and chase the hunters with the dinosaur, as well as defeating the hunter's pet ''[[Spinosaurus]]''.

Dor (film)
 Zeenat ([[Gul Panag]]) is an independent [[Muslim]] woman living in [[Himachal Pradesh]]. She agrees to marry Amir Khan, her boyfriend, despite his parents' reservations. After their marriage, her husband leaves for [[Saudi Arabia]] to begin employment.  Meera ([[Ayesha Takia]]), a simple [[Rajasthan]]i [[Hindu]] woman, has everything in her life in accordance with customs and traditions: her formative years, her recent marriage into a traditional Rajasthani family and her daily chores within the walls of her ''[[haveli]]''. Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh ([[Girish Karnad]]), mother, Gowri Singh ([[Prateeksha Lonkar]]), his paternal grandmother ([[Uttara Baokar]]) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated to know that Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.  When the news of Shankar's death reaches the Singh ''haveli'', everyone turns somber and the ceremonies towards rendering her into a widow emotionally drains Meera. Her vivaciousness and exuberance are thrust behind her black veil. The rest of the family vents their frustration of losing their only bread-winner on Meera, by blaming her for bringing bad-luck to their family. Meera, being her respectful self, bears the insults silently.  On the other side, Zeenat hears that her husband has been arrested for murdering his roommate in Saudi Arabia. She is convinced that it must have been an accident, but the Saudi law is unforgiving and Amir is scheduled to be executed. An Indian officer explains to her that Saudi law permits release of a criminal if the wife of the deceased forgives the guilt. Armed only with a photograph of Shankar and Amir, Zeenat sets out to find Meera. En route, she meets a ''[[Behrupiya]]'' ([[Shreyas Talpade]]). The ''bahuroopiya'' introduces himself and his profession as being multi-faceted and multi-talented in arts and mimicry. This profession requires him to keep visiting different places to perform "tricks" for his income. He turns out to be a petty con-man when he hoodwinks Zeenat and steals her belongings. However, when Zeenat is in trouble, he returns to rescue her with his artistic talent. He reveals his sympathetic view when Zeenat details her plight; he offers to help her with whatever knowledge he has. After making a lot of educated guesses, they reach [[Jodhpur]]. With local help, they identify the Singh ''haveli''. When Zeenat directly requests the Singh family to pardon Amir's mistake, their anger drives her away. She feels that maybe talking through and befriending Meera might help her cause. The ''bahuroopiya'' takes leave of Zeenat and wishes her the best for her efforts.  At a temple, which Meera visits as her daily ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is too afraid to tell Meera the truth about the situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their friendship brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her ''haveli'' and gives her a new perspective on her life.  In the meanwhile, the Singh ''haveli'' is under a debt to Chopra ([[Nagesh Kukunoor]]), a local factory owner. When Randhir requests him for more time to repay it, he is given an offer — pardoning the debt in exchange for Meera. Though initially set back by Chopra's offer, Randhir prefers the ''haveli'' over Meera.  When the news of the imminent death sentence arrives, Zeenat is compelled to tell the truth to Meera. Meera is shocked beyond belief to hear Zeenat's words. The fact that her friendship was based on false pretenses is what hurts her more. She immediately refuses to sign the ''maafinama'' (statement of forgiveness). She makes it clear that she wants to hurt her husband's murderer, even if it was an accident, because of how much she is hurting in her new, veiled life. She leaves for the ''haveli''. Zeenat, initially, is deeply hurt from Meera's decision but eventually accepts it as fate and decides to leave for her hometown. Meera later has a change of heart, perhaps because of her disillusionment at Randhir's willingness to "sell" her to Chopra. She gets encouragement from her paternal grandmother and hurries towards the railway station, where she meets Zeenat and gives her the signed statement of forgiveness. Zeenat extends her hand from the train and Meera grabs it and climbs aboard, presumably running away from the only life she has ever known, as the train speeds up into the distance.

Dragon (2006 film)
 The film takes place in the forest of Sidhe, following Princess Alora on her journey to Bagnor Brim to seek the aid of Lord Blackthorne against the dark elves waging war on humanity throughout the realm. Attacked by dark elves, the Princess is saved by the warriors Lord Artemir and Cador Bain. The two warriors insist that they accompany Princess Alora on her quest to act as her guardians and warn her of the dragon which dwells within the forest.  Princess Alora and the two warriors are ambushed by a trio of bandits (Gareth Morholt, Naga, and Sogomo) who identify themselves as the Kensington Vassals, famous for having slain a dragon. Princess Alora promises the three land and title in exchange for their knowledge and assistance, to which the Vassals agree despite tension between Gareth, Lord Artemir, and Cador.  As the group's passage through the forest continues, they encounter an elf named Damara and her mistress Freyja, a mysterious necromancer. Freyja cryptically forewarns that not all of Alora's companions shall survive their trek, but one is destined to slay the dragon. Declaring that she shall render them aid, Freyja and Damara join the Princess as well. The necromancer easily takes measure of the group's character, noting the budding romance between Cador and Alora.  The group is taken by surprise when the dragon attacks them, and their attempts to fight the beast do little to injure it. Sogomo is trapped under a tree felled by the dragon during the fray and, horrified, the party can do nothing but watch as the dragon devours him.   Once the Princess and her band flee and regroup, Freyja takes Alora aside to divulge a new strategy for defeating the beast. The necromancer reveals that she was responsible for creating the dragon many years ago to fight the dark elves at the behest of Alora's father, the king. Unable to control the beast, however, Freyja did what little she could to confine it to the forest of Sidhe. Confiding that the dragon's death shall mean the necromancer too shall die, Freyja also gives Alora a wand made of a small tree branch to use against the dragon. The Princess bestows a knighthood upon Cador for his valor, grimly noting that there may not be another chance to do so.  The group decides to seek the dragon in its lair, and prepare to attack the sleeping beast only to be ambushed themselves by a band of dark elves. Naga continues to fight despite being shot with several arrows until she succumbs to the fatal wounds. The Princess and her accompaniment of warriors fend off the elves in time to turn their attention to the awoken dragon. Lord Artemir attempts a valiant charge only to be consumed in a gout of flame, perishing.  The wand given to Alora transforms into a spear, and the Princess pierces the dragon's heart. As the dragon dies, Freyja collapses and confides in her dying breath that Alora was her daughter.   Reinforcements of dark elves arrive but concede victory and allegiance to the Princess as she brandishes the spear aloft in triumph.  Though the dragon is defeated and the war with the dark elves is brought to an end, the group of adventurers gathers for the bittersweet funeral of their fallen comrades. The king dies during Princess Alora's return journey, but she ascends to rule the kingdom with Sir Cador at her side.

Her faith does not, however, hinder her from engaging in an affair with Peter, a young [[curate]] portraying [[Jesus Christ]] in the church pageant she is directing.  Notably Laura's religious side appears to be completely invented to simply bully her husband and son. Amongst Laura's many random and mean-spirited rulings she refuses to allow Ben to have a mobile phone (they cause cancer), refuses to allow him to hang around with people his own age and uses his driving lessons as a way to be ferried around for her affair with Peter, who appears unrepentant for sleeping with his mentor's wife. Miserable in his life, Ben writes poems for a girl, named Sarah, he knows from church. He decides to read his most recent "Sarah Poem" to her aloud, only to result in him being rebuked by Sarah. Before Sarah walks off in embarrassment, she tells him that he's "just too weird."  At his mother's urging he seeks summer employment, so that she can pay for the upkeep of a mental patient, named Mr. Fincham, she has adopted. Ben responds to an ad placed by Dame Evie Walton, an alcoholic, classically trained actress who was reduced to accepting a role on a daytime [[soap opera]] when her once flourishing career began to fade and who hasn't worked since the series ended, to her annoyance. In search of a companion to assist her in the house and drive her to various appointments, Evie immediately takes to Ben and offers him the position.  Ben's conservative upbringing hasn't prepared him for the adventures he begins to experience with his new employer. When Laura refuses to allow Ben to take a [[camping trip]] with Evie, she suggests they take a drive in the country instead, then "swallows" the car key when they find an idyllic spot for setting up a campsite. The following morning she announces she needs Ben to drive her to the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]], where she has been invited to read poetry. Their [[road trip]] proves to be an epiphany for Ben, who has his first sexual experience with Bryony, one of the young women organizing the event; learns the importance of accepting responsibility and honouring commitments; and finds the inner strength to stand up for himself and speak his mind.  Upon returning from the trip, Laura interrogates Ben as she labels Evie as "wicked" and believes she has "corrupted" him. However, when Evie comes to visit, she is rebuffed by Laura. Ben discovers this and in a fit of rebellion walks offstage in the pageant and goes for a bike ride over to Evie's house where the two friends reconcile.  Later Evie turns up at the Pageant and "portraying" the part of God manages to whip everyone up into a religious frenzy, allowing Ben to join her in the car park. Laura chases the pair and tries to weaponise the [[Bible]] once more, however Ben finally tells her to go away, seconds later Laura is run over by Mr. Fincham, whose mental state has steadily declined throughout the film. When Ben visits her at hospital she tells him her near death experience has made her a prophet and that God says she must have a divorce so that she can run off with Peter, whom the Bishop has fired; with him taking Laura to Cornwall to convalescence.   Angered at her lack of concern for either him or his father, Ben storms off. On his way out of the hospital he runs into Sarah who aimlessly prattles in a condescending tone on about how the affair was God's will. Finally pushed beyond endurance, Ben tells Sarah to "fuck off", taking her aback. Later, following Evie's advice, Ben buys himself a tent and moves into the backyard as a way to "get away from it all". When Robert speaks to him Ben shouts at him, telling him that he, not Laura, should have asked for divorce. Robert then reveals that he did. Startled, Ben listens to Robert explain that he loved his wife and had tried to be faithful even when she was not. Finally free from Laura's brand of [[Religious fanaticism#Christianity|Christian fanaticism]], Ben and his father tell each other that they love each other.  Later Ben visits Evie to tell her he is moving to [[Edinburgh]] to attend [[university]] to study English. Evie is pleased for Ben and a little saddened that Ben shall no longer be working for her. Ben reads Evie a last poem expressing his [[gratitude]] for her friendship, for which Evie compliments him; saying that "it's him". Ben then promises to visit her whenever he's home from college and heads off.  The final scene of the film shows Ben, finally free, walking through the park on his way home to start packing for Edinburgh.  
Dreamgirls (film)
  In 1962 [[Detroit, Michigan]], young car salesman Curtis Taylor Jr. meets a black [[girl group]] known as "The Dreamettes", which consists of lead singer Effie White and backup singers Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson, at an R&B amateur talent show at the Detroit Theatre. Curtis presents himself as The Dreamettes' new manager and arranges for the girls to become backup singers for [[chitlin' circuit]] R&B star Jimmy "Thunder" Early.  Curtis soon starts his own record label, Rainbow Records, out of his Detroit car dealership, and appoints Effie's brother C.C as his head songwriter. When their first single fails after a white pop group releases a [[cover version]], Curtis, C.C., and their producer Wayne turn to [[payola]] to make "Jimmy Early & The Dreamettes" mainstream pop stars. Offstage, Effie becomes infatuated with Curtis while the married Jimmy begins an affair with Lorrell.  Jimmy's manager, Marty Madison, grows weary of Curtis' plans to make his client more pop-friendly and walks out. When Jimmy bombs in front of an all-white [[Miami Beach]] [[supper club]] audience, Curtis sends Jimmy out on the road alone, keeping The Dreamettes behind to headline in his place. Feeling that Effie's plus-sized figure and distinctive voice will not attract white audiences, Curtis appoints the slimmer and higher-voiced Deena lead singer and renames the group "The Dreams".  With the aid of new songs and a new image, Curtis and C.C. transform The Dreams into a top-selling mainstream pop group. By 1965, however, Effie begins acting out, particularly when Curtis' affections also turn towards Deena. Curtis eventually drops Effie from the group, hiring his secretary Michelle Morris to take her place beginning with their 1966 [[New Year's Eve]] debut in [[Las Vegas]] as "Deena Jones & the Dreams." Despite Effie's defiance and desperate appeal to Curtis, he, C.C., and The Dreams leave her behind and forge ahead to stardom.  By 1973, Effie has become an impoverished [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] mother living in Detroit with her daughter Magic. Struggling to restart her career in music, she hires Marty as her manager and begins performing at a local club. Meanwhile, with Deena Jones & the Dreams superstars and Rainbow having moved to [[Los Angeles]] and now the biggest pop business in the country, Curtis attempts to produce a film about [[Cleopatra]] starring an unwilling Deena, who is now his wife.  The following year, Jimmy, who has descended into drug addiction due to Curtis' preoccupation with Deena, has a breakdown during Rainbow Records' tenth-anniversary television special. Curtis promptly drops him from the label and Lorrell ends their affair. Sometime later, C.C., who feels Curtis is undermining the [[artistic merit]] of his songs by making them into [[disco music]], quits the label, only for everyone to then learn that Jimmy has been found dead from a [[heroin]] overdose.  Disillusioned by Jimmy's death and Curtis' cold reaction to the news, C.C. travels to Detroit and reconciles with Effie, for whom C.C. writes and produces a comeback single. Just as the record begins gaining local radio play, Curtis uses payola to force radio stations to play The Dreams' [[disco]] cover of the song. The plan falls apart, however, when Deena, angry over how Curtis controls her career, finds evidence of his schemes and contacts Effie, who arrives in Los Angeles with C.C., Marty, and a lawyer.  Deena and Effie reconcile, with Effie revealing to Deena that Curtis is Magic's father, while Curtis agrees to give Effie's record national distribution in order to avoid being reported to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Having been inspired by Effie's victory and realizing Curtis' true character, Deena leaves him to make it on her own.  By 1975, The Dreams give a final farewell performance at the Detroit Theater and invite Effie onstage for the final song. As the concert ends, Curtis notices Magic in the front row and realizes she is his daughter.  
Dragon Tiger Gate
 Dragon Tiger Gate is an academy established by two powerful martial artists. The academy aims to train students in [[martial art]]s in order to uphold justice and combat the threat of the [[Triad (underground societies)|triad]]s. The academy is also a haven for children who had been orphaned by triads.  The story begins with the two sons of Wong, one of the founders of the academy, who were each born to different mothers. The older is named Dragon and the younger is named Tiger. When the boys were young, Dragon's mother left the academy and gave Dragon half of a Jade amulet pendant and told him that his half-brother, Tiger, has the other half. When Dragon's mother was killed in a fire, Dragon was taken into the care of triad boss, Ma Kun, and he grew up to become his bodyguard. Ma Kun's gang is a subject of the evil Luocha Cult.  Several years later, Tiger and his friends are dining in a restaurant and encounter Ma Kun and his men, who are receiving the Luocha Plaque. The plaque is a symbol of authority within the Luocha Cult and indicates that the holder is second only to the cult's leader, Shibumi. Ma Kun and the leader of the White Lions Gang were arguing over the plaque when Tiger accidentally interrupts the meeting. One of Tiger's friends makes off with the plaque while Tiger starts a fight with the gangsters. Just then, Dragon appears and fights Tiger, whom he does not recognize to be his half-brother. Ma Kun calls for Dragon to pull back.  Later that night, Dragon confronts Tiger and his friends at a [[Japanese restaurant]] to take back the plaque. Tiger and his friends have been drugged by Scaly, another of Ma Kun's lackeys, who also wanted to seize back the plaque to prove to his boss that he is the better man. Scaly and his followers fight Dragon over possession of the plaque. Turbo Shek, another diner at the restaurant, is aroused by the commotion and he joins the fight on Dragon's side. Dragon and Turbo defeat Scaly and his men and Dragon takes back the plaque from Tiger. Just then, Tiger discovers that Dragon has the other half of the jade amulet pendant and realizes that Dragon is actually his half-brother.  Turbo follows Tiger back to Dragon Tiger Gate, wanting to be enrolled into the academy to improve his martial arts. He is refused by the current leader of the academy, Master Wong, for his arrogance. Dismayed, Turbo waits outside the academy and promises not to leave unless he is accepted in as student. Master Wong agrees to spar with Turbo and defeats Turbo easily. Turbo is humbled and accepted by Master Wong as a student.  Meanwhile, Ma Kun returns the Luocha Plaque to signify his retirement. He is supported by Dragon, who wants to return to Dragon Tiger Gate, and his daughter Ma Xiaoling, who wants a simple life. Shibumi sees this as an insult and sends his henchmen, the Double Devils, to kill Ma Kun. He uses his subordinate Lousha to lure Dragon away while his minions kill Ma Kun. Dragon returns to rescue Ma Kun but is too late. Dragon slays the Double Devils after a vicious fight and leaves Ma Xiaoling in his brother's care before leaving.  Shibumi was impressed with Dragon for defeating his henchmen and goes to Dragon Tiger Gate to issue a challenge. With Dragon not present, Master Wong, Tiger and Turbo takes on Shibumi's challenge but were utterly defeated. Master Wong is killed by Shibumi while Tiger and Turbo are severely wounded. Ma Xiaoling brings Tiger and Turbo to Mount Baiyun to seek help from Master Qi. Master Qi heals the wounded Tiger and Turbo, and teaches them new martial arts techniques to fight Shibumi.  Tiger and Turbo storm into Shibumi's Black Pagoda to stop him from committing evil acts once and for all. Although their martial arts abilities have greatly improved since the last time they fought, they are still no match for Shibumi. At the critical moment, Dragon appears and fights Shibumi, eventually killing him with his Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms technique. Before the film ends, Dragon returns to Dragon Tiger Gate together with Tiger and Turbo (who decides to change his name to Leopard) to carry on Master Wong's legacy.

En route back to base, McClaren slips down an embankment, breaking his leg and falling into freezing water. Shepard uses the lead dog Maya to carry a rope to McClaren and pulls him out. The two battle [[hypothermia]], [[frostbite]] and near [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions as the dogs lead them home. Once there, the entire human crew is immediately evacuated, while the dogs are left behind.

Back at home, Shepard tries to secure a plane to return and save the dogs, but no one is willing to finance the risky expedition. Five months later, Shepard makes one last attempt to get back. McClaren realizes the magnitude of his ingratitude and uses the remaining balance of his grant money to finance a rescue mission.

They have been on their own for nearly six months.  Shepard makes it back to base with the others and is dismayed to find the body of Old Jack, still attached to the chain, and no sign of the other dogs. He hears the sound of barking and sees Max, Shorty, Truman, Shadow and Buck come over the horizon. After a joyous reunion, Shepard attempts to load the dogs into the snowmobile, but Max runs off, with Shepard in hot pursuit. Max leads him to Maya, lying in the snow – weak, but alive. With six of his eight sled dogs in tow, Shepard and his crew head back to civilization, withe last scene showing a grave for the two fallen dogs, Old Jack and Dewey.

At the same time, Jimmy is trying to escape Wo Shing by building a legitimate business empire in mainland China. When he is arrested in an illegal financial trade with a government official for the building of a new logisitics center and highway, the section chief of the [[Public Security Bureau]] forbids him to re-enter the mainland to do business, unless he becomes Wo Shing's next chairman. Reluctant, but forced to accept the reality he can never truly exit the triad, Jimmy enters into the election nomination, with Jet and Kun also seeking the chairman position.  Lok first negotiates with Kun, claiming Wo Shing's "Uncles" will support Kun, so long as they team up for a joint election bid. Kun then kidnaps and places Jimmy's financial supporter Mr Kwok in a coffin alive with Big Head, so as to eliminate the competition. Lok also asks Jet to assassinate Jimmy, also claiming the "Uncles" will support Jet. Unfortunately, Jet does not complete the assassination, following Jimmy warning the youth Lok will most likely have him and Kun killed, once Jimmy is dead. Mr So, having been similarly arrested in the mainland for an illegal gambling ring, allies with Jimmy to see to his election as chairman. Meanwhile, Lok hides the Dragon Head Baton, the symbol of Wo Shing's leadership, in mainland China, hoping to reassert his power, then outright kills "Uncle" Teng Wai, after Teng blasts Lok for breaking Wo Shing tradition. Seeing the corruption and civil war escalating in the society, Jimmy kidnaps Lok's lieutenants and bribes them to work for him. After exposing Kun for kidnapping Mr. Kwok and Big Head, while ordering Lok's lieutenants to murder the chairman, Jimmy's nomination is successful, and he wins the election.  Back in mainland China, the section chief congratulates Jimmy for winning and hands the Dragon Head Baton Lok hid. However, the Security Bureau is tired of seeing the baton entering the mainland for years and having to re-deliver it back to Wo Shing. In the hopes this will not happen again, the section chief orders Jimmy to become Wo Shing's chairman ''permanently'', establishing the society as a family enterprise. The furious Jimmy cannot believe these turn of events, hoping once his two-year term as chairman expires, he can finally go "clean". Upon visiting his wife, whom he sent into hiding during the election for her safety, she announces her pregnancy. Jimmy embraces her hiding both fear and horror at the prospect of his son being trapped in a life he wants no part of.  
Ekskul
 The pre-title scene shows Joshua (Ramon), the main character, in a psychiatrist's office. Joshua is clearly refusing to cooperate with the shrink, who seems to favor repressive in place of persuasive approach. The brief dialogue in this scene is mainly filled with rather cheesy joke exchanges about transsexual brothers. The title screen is then shown.  In the next scene, a huge number of police officers, including [[SWAT]] teams and [[sniper]]s, is deploying around Joshua's school. Joshua has purchased a gun and has barricaded himself in the school counselor's office along with six students as hostages.  Most of the film consist of flashbacks, depicting the events leading to the current situation. Some of these include Joshua being beaten by the school gang and his own father, being hanged by his collar from the school gate, and having his face shoved down the toilet.  The flashbacks also show his brief relationship with Cathy (Metha Yunatria), a popular student, and Sabina (Sheila Marcia), a beautiful but introverted girl who sympathized with him.  The police attempts to negotiate, aided by Mrs. Miranda, the school counselor, and Joshua's parents. During negotiations, Joshua tells about his frustration to everyone listening, including the press which is broadcasting the crisis nationally.  Eventually he releases the female hostages, which includes Cathy, but keeps the males which consist of the gang members which have tormented him for so long. Announcing to them "It's judgement time," he returns what they did to him. He makes them shove their leader's head into a toilet at gunpoint, and after demanding all the school students to come and watch, he hangs Jerry from the school roof.  Again, Mrs. Miranda pleads Joshua to let the hostages go. Joshua refuses, claiming they deserve to die. However, the police have arrested the man who sold Joshua his gun, and he told them that Joshua only has one bullet. Mrs. Miranda uses this information to force Joshua into surrendering, since he won't be able to shoot all three hostages. However, that was not actually his plan all along. As a squad of police officers move up to the roof to apprehend him, he points the gun to his head and kills himself.

Employee of the Month (2006 film)
 For years, Zack Bradley has been working at the local "[[warehouse club|Super Club]]" as a box-boy. He lives with his grandmother and spends his free time with co-workers Lon Neilson, Iqbal Raji, and Russell Porpis-Gunders. Despite his [[slacker]]-like ways, he is kind-hearted, popular and supportive. His co-worker Vince Downey earns the [[Employee of the month (program)|Employee of the Month]] title for the 17th time in a row. Vince is egotistical and rude towards his co-workers, including his box-boy Jorge Mecico, whom he berates constantly. When new cashier Amy Renfro is hired, Zack and Vince fall for her and compete for her affection. Zack is told that Amy slept with the Employee of the Month at her last job, so he decides to win the title. Amy has dinner with Vince, but is repulsed when he puts the move on her. Vince does not realize how Amy feels, thinking they had a good kiss, and continues pursuing her. Zack steps up his act and begins going to work on time and working harder, giving Vince competition for the title. He also goes on a date with Amy, which takes place entirely in Super Club.  Within a few days, with Vince still winning the daily star, Zack realizes that getting Employee of the Month is not as easy as he thought. With Iqbal's encouragement, Zack finds his groove and, to Vince's horror, wins the star the next day. A war of attrition begins, as Vince tries everything he could think of to derail Zack's string of stars, even breaking into his house one night to reset the clocks; the sabotage causes Zack to arrive a minute late the following day, but with Iqbal's help, Zack's attendance card indicates that he arrived on time, causing Vince's scheme to fail. Zack takes Iqbal's shift on the day of a championship slow-pitch game against rival chain Maxi-Mart. However, he leaves to play in the game and Iqbal is fired. Frustrated at Zack's new attitude, his friends tell him he is turning into Vince and feel his attempt at getting the title is a result of trying to have sex with Amy. Amy overhears the conversation and is disgusted at Zack for his true intentions, prompting her to compare him to her last boyfriend, also an Employee of the Month with whom she indeed had sex but could not stand his attitude, which was why she requested a transfer.  At month's end, Zack and Vince are tied. On the day of the tie-breaking competition, Zack quits, gets Iqbal his job back and tells him he took responsibility for what happened, making a heartfelt apology to Lon, Iqbal, and Russell. Zack tells them he plans to win the competition, not for recognition or to make an impression, but for pride. When the store manager is about to announce Zack's resignation, Zack, Lon, Iqbal, and Russell show up claiming Zack never filed the resignation papers. It is revealed that Russell bribed the [[human resources|HR]] manager with a broken [[Butterfinger]]. Zack tries to reconcile with Amy, giving a heartfelt apology and telling her that no matter what, he is a better man because of her. Despite Vince's protests, the competition, for the fastest checkout, is held. The Employee of the Month Award will be granted to the person who finishes the task first.  Vince beats Zack by seconds but, during the award ceremony, Semi, the security guard, brings a surveillance video of the competition that shows Vince throwing items behind his back and onto the conveyor belt without [[Barcode reader|scanning]] them. Vince denies the allegations of [[shoplifting|under-ringing]]. The store's assistant manager, who had just completed an audit of the tills used in the competition, proved the surveillance video was right about Vince giving customers free items and has been doing this for 18 months, costing the store thousands of dollars. Vince is fired and required to wear a police tracking device in lieu of jail time. Zack ends up winning the competition, and his relationship with Amy is rekindled.   Six weeks after he is terminated from Super Club, Vince is on probation and working at Maxi-Mart, a rival store. Jorge finally learns to assert himself and treats Vince the same as he was treated by him. He is still willing to give Vince a ride to the bus stop, knowing that this would put him outside the range of his probation [[ankle monitor]].

Encounter Point
  One mother that is introduced early on in the film is Robi Damelin.[http://www.justvision.org/profile/robi_damelin.php] Damelin’s son David was a soldier in the Israeli army that had been shot by a sniper while working at a checkpoint. The soldiers had been sent to protect an Israeli settlement on Palestinian territory. After learning of her son's loss, Damelin joined the [[The Parents Circle-Families Forum|Bereaved Families Forum]], where she was able to meet other Palestinian and Israeli families that had been through the same losses. There she worked closely with the families from different backgrounds and began to advocate peace between the two territories. She continues to work for an end to the conflict.  Ali Abu Awwad is another individual in the film who is followed by the production team to see his stance on the non-violence attempts. After being shot in his lower body by an Israeli settler he was sent to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment. While healing in Saudi Arabia, Ali’s brother Yusef had been murdered by an Israeli militant. After the news of his brother's murder [http://www.justvision.org/profile/ali_abu_awwad.php Ali Abu Awwad] teamed up with the [[The Parents Circle-Families Forum|Bereaved Families Forum]] to work with Israelis and Palestinians who together campaigned for non-violence. By speaking with Palestinian militants and those who are threatened by Israeli settlers Ali was able to broaden his message of non-violence resistance throughout the Palestinian territories.  Shlomo Zagman, who grew up in an Israeli settlement most of his life is another character in the documentary. Along with the settlers from his home town, Shlomo, and by and large all Israeli settlers, are extremists that believe that all the Palestinians should be deported to the neighboring Arab countries [[Israeli settlement|(Israeli Settlement)]]. The movie illuminates this point as we see how Shlomo and his wife transform, despite the meandering resistance of his parents and home town, to become founding members of the Realistic Religious Zionism group [http://www.tzionut.org/index.asp].This transformation is a huge step, and usually unheard of, for someone who grew up in the settlements. Subsequently, Shlomo tries to encourage the people of his hometown, as well as other settlements, to withdraw from these occupied territories and convince them that the persistence of these settlements will bring down the Jewish State of Israel.  George then joined the Bereaved Families Forum, 3 months after her death, like many of the others in the film. There he met Israelis and Palestinians who had gone through the same losses and were ready to fight for peace on top of their pain. In an interview George has said that he received an apology from the soldiers that had begun the shooting. In the same interview he is quoted as saying “We also call for peace that is just and real where there will be no Palestinian or Israeli family that has to go through the same thing we did. Our goal now is to try as much as we can through our love and forgiveness to carry on with our lives and help others not to go through what we went through.” [http://www.justvision.org/interview/george_saadeh.php#a006572] George was a principle of a high school in Bethlehem, but after the shooting he became the deputy mayor of Jerusalem.

The door is answered and both Fay and Keung burst in seeking help for their injuries sustained in the restaurant shootout. Fay pushes a still unconscious Wo out of the way and orders the doctor to tend to his wound first. Meanwhile, Keung takes a look around the flat and comes across a hiding Fat. Realizing that they have been found the gang begin to dispatch the bosses' henchmen. Meanwhile, Wo wakes up and slowly gets to his feet to escape before collapsing. The rest of the friends not knowing where Wo has got to, make an exit down the back of the apartment. However whilst escaping across the back courtyard, Boss Fay throws Wo from a high window and pins down Wo's friends preventing any rescue attempt. The gang desperately try to retrieve their critically injured but still alive friend but Fay still shoots at them and even manages to shoot Wo. Quick thinking Fat seeing that his friend has come to rest on some tarpaulin pulls Wo to safety and the gang escape. Now in the car Wo knowing he is near death, asks to be taken back to his wife and son. Wo dies shortly after.  Handing Wo's body over to his wife, Jin, she demands to know what has happened and in her grief opens fire on Blaze and Tai who run away. Jin contemplates killing herself and her son but thinks better of it. She instead smashes up the furniture in the house and makes a funeral pyre for Wo. She then sets fire to Wo and the flat and leaves with her son. The reduced gang leave the city in search of the gold. After coming across the heavily guarded convoy carrying the gold, they flip a coin to decide whether to hijack it or not. The coin comes up tails meaning they will not proceed with the robbery. After carrying on down the road however the come across the convoy being ambushed by another gang. They witness all the police officers bar one crack-shot being killed. The friends decide to help the officer ([[Richie Jen]]) by dispatching the rest of the gang. The friends appreciating the policeman's sharp shooting decide to split the gold with him and drive off to a hidden dock to transport the gold to the mainland and a new life. Meanwhile, back in the city, Jin still furious about the death of her husband goes looking for the friends, asking many people until she is recognised by the fixer Jeff who in turn contacts his boss, Boss Fay.  Fay with a captured Jin calls a gloating Blaze, who is then informed of the situation. He is told to meet Fay at midnight otherwise Jin and her son will be killed. Determined to protect Jin after Wo's death, the friends agree and leave the officer at the dock with the gold telling him they will return by dawn. Once at the meeting place the four friends are confronted by Jin, whom Fay allows to shoot Blaze in revenge. However Blaze is again hit in the chest, surviving due to his bullet proof vest. Tai steps in, throwing a bag of gold at Fay's feet telling him that he can have it all if Fay lets them all go. Fay agrees, but tells them Blaze must stay to face the consequences of not following orders. Blaze agrees to this deal and the remainder of the friends leave with Jin. However, as they leave, Tai informs Jin of the boat and the policeman and tells her to drive there. With Jin safe the greatly outnumbered friends open fire. In the resulting gunfight all are killed including Boss Fay and Boss Keung. As the friends lie dying they all smile knowing they have kept their promise to Wo.  
Everything's Gone Green (film)
 Ryan, a good-natured [[slacker]] in his twenties, is dumped by his girlfriend and kicked out of their apartment, and, on arriving late to work, is suspended (pending psychological tests) from his job at an anonymous [[information technology|IT]] corporation. On receiving a phone call from his family saying they have won the jackpot of 4.3 million [[Canadian dollar|dollars]] on the BC lottery, he trashes his office space, and resigns. Unfortunately, when he calls the lottery "Win Line" he discovers they haven't actually won anything. By happy accident, Ryan is offered a job with the lottery bureau interviewing and photographing lottery winners. En route to the job interview he stops to see a beached whale and meets Ming, a set designer in a relationship with golf-course designer and scam artist Bryce.  Ryan is enticed by Bryce into participating in a lucrative money-laundering scheme involving new lottery winners, and after the euphoria of new-found wealth wears off is forced to choose between working with Bryce and winning over an increasingly sceptical Ming. Additional complications arise when Ryan discovers that his parents are operating a [[Cannabis cultivation|marijuana grow-op]] in the family basement, and when he re-visits lottery winners to discover that they are often worse off than they were before winning.  
Everyone's Hero
 The year is 1932, during the [[Great Depression]], Yankee Irving ([[Jake T. Austin]]) is a young baseball fan, whose father Stanley ([[Mandy Patinkin]]) works as a custodian for [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. While the two are on the premises, a thief steals Babe Ruth's famous bat Darlin' ([[Whoopi Goldberg]]), with the result that Yankee’s father is blamed and temporarily dismissed until Darlin can be found, as result Stanley also blames Yankee for stealing it and for setting him up. The true thief is Lefty Maginnis ([[William H. Macy]]), a cheating pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. Lefty works for the Cubs general manager Napoleon Cross ([[Robin Williams]]), who desires to see the Cubs defeat the Yankees during the [[1932 World Series]].  Stealing the bat back, Yankee decides to return it to Babe Ruth and thereby clear his father’s name by journeying across the country to Chicago, where the next World Series' games will be played. Darlin' is able to speak, as does her counterpart Screwie ([[Rob Reiner]]), a baseball, who she constantly argues and bickers with (though near the end, they finally become friends). Much of the plot is driven by Lefty's comic attempts to steal back the bat from Yankee, with slapstick results. Other scenes involve Yankee meeting others who will help him in his quest: several hobos (Ron Tippe, [[Richard Kind]] & [[Ed Helms]]); Marti ([[Raven-Symone]]), an African American girl; her baseball player father Lonnie “The Rooster” Brewster ([[Forest Whitaker]]); and in Chicago, Babe Ruth himself ([[Brian Dennehy]]).  A series of improbable coincidences allows Yankee himself to bat for the Yankees, resulting in the archetypal home run (technically, a series of errors after an infield pop-up that allow him to round the bases). This restores the morale of the Yankees, who score 7 more runs to take the lead and win the World Series. Cross tries to talk Babe Ruth out of accepting the victory, saying that Yankee is too young to be a counting player. This leads to the arrest of Cross, who simply says that he was a fan that cheated. When his part in the plan is revealed, Lefty is banished from the team, also arrested as well and Stanley is cleared and officially reinstated as the stadium’s custodian  
The Ex (2006 film)
 Living in [[Manhattan]], Tom ([[Zach Braff]]) is a [[Chef|cook]] who has difficulty keeping a steady job. His wife, Sofia ([[Amanda Peet]]), is an [[Lawyer|attorney]]. When their first child is born, they agree that she will be a full-time mom and he will work hard to get a promotion. When Tom gets fired after defending his friend Paco ([[Yul Vazquez]]), he takes a job in [[Ohio]] working at the ad agency where his father-in-law is the assistant director. Tom is assigned to report to Chip ([[Jason Bateman]]). Chip is a strict and hard-working [[paraplegic]] man who is coincidentally Sofia's ex-boyfriend from high school. Chip still carries an obsession with her, so he conspires to make Tom's work life miserable. As Tom's frustrations mount, Chip begins to sway Sofia to his side.  Tom begins to suspect that Chip isn't handicapped at all and goes through his desk. He finds a photo of Chip playing tennis and rushes to his in-laws' house to see his wife and show her the picture. He finds Chip having dinner with Sofia and her parents and holding Tom's child. Tom mercilessly tries to prove that Chip isn't actually [[Paralysis|paralyzed]] by dragging him up a flight of stairs and then throws him, expecting him to stand up to prevent falling. Chip doesn't stand up and Tom is humiliated in front of his family. Later, he confronts Chip outside his house and attacks him, where Chip reveals that he really can walk, but can't fight outside of his chair. After sitting back down, Chip beats him severely and reveals that he plans to sleep with Sofia, much to Tom's already-increased rage.  It's revealed that Paco had called Chip under the guise of being an ad agency boss in [[Barcelona]], telling Chip that he got a job and convincing him to fly to [[Spain]]. Excited by the news, Chip goes to Sofia and asks her to come with him. However, Tom accosts them both and convinces her not to go with Chip. Chip, angry that Sofia chose Tom over him, heartlessly mocks Tom and reveals he "faked his orgasm" to Sofia before getting out of his chair and walking out. While chastising them from outside, Chip is hit by a bus and ends up breaking both of his legs, crippling him for real. Tom and Sofia have moved out of Ohio and Sofia's dad is helping Tom start his own ad business. Tom and Sofia are shown to have switched positions, Tom becoming a [[stay-at-home dad]] while Sofia becomes a full-time worker. During the credits Chip is shown being tossed out of the ad company in Spain, and later on Tom's friend sees Chip in the middle of the running of the bulls on TV.  
Everyone Stares
 The first part of the film is a slideshow of photos before Copeland acquired his film camera. This includes the era with [[Henry Padovani]] and the arrival of Andy Summers. The film then follows the band as they try to find success in America, joined by Copeland's childhood friend Kim Turner as their tour manager.   The band then return to Europe, performing at various festivals. They then got their first taste of fame when a mob of fans wait for them in Birmingham after a show. This is followed by number one singles on both sides of the Atlantic and the band's explosive shoot to success. However, they collaborate less and less on songs as Sting brings in almost finished songs. It ends with The Police headlining the [[US Festival]] in 1982 and their eventual breakup.  
Evil Bong
 Nerdy college student Alistair McDowell (David Weidoff) moves in with law school drop-out Larnell (John Patrick Jordan), typical "surfer-stoner" Bachman (Mitch Eakins) and former baseball player Brett (Brian Lloyd). During Alistair's stay, Larnell sees an ad for a large bong, in which the previous owner claims it was "possessed". After receiving the bong and all taking a couple of hits (with the exception of Alistair, who doesn't smoke), Brett introduces Alistair to his girlfriend Luann ([[Robin Sydney]]) and her friend Janet (Kristyn Green), on whom Alistair develops a crush.  Later that night, Bachman wakes up in a strip club where he meets [[Doll Graveyard|Ooga Booga]] and [[Decadent Evil|Ivan Burroughs]]. He's introduced by one of the strippers (Kristen Cladwell) who has skull heads on the cups of her bra. When he comes near the bra, the skull heads start biting him in the neck and he bleeds to death. The next morning, the other roommates find Bachman dead on the couch. Alistair tells to them that it's probably from the weed that came with the bong. Larnell also notices that the bong has changed. The trio then hide his body underneath a pile of trash in the basement, after nearly getting caught by Larnell's paralyzed-but-wealthy grandfather, Cyril (Jacob Witkin), who came by to tell Larnell that he just got remarried.  Later on, the bong (voiced by Michele Mais) starts speaking to Larnell (to Larnell only, no one else hears) and tempts him to take a hit out of her. After doing so, he ends being in the same strip club as before. Here he sees Bachman (who seems to be fine), the [[The Gingerdead Man|Gingerdead Man]], and his grandfather. Eventually a stripper gives Larnell a lap dance, and he's killed in a similar way that Bachman was killed. Back in the real world, Luann and Janet come over to play [[Trivial Pursuit]]. After playing the game, the group (again with the exception of Alistair) take a hit from the bong. After Brett and Luann pass out, they wake up in the same strip club and they're greeted by [[Demonic Toys|Jack Attack]], and Luann is taken away by the bouncer. Brett is then treated by another stripper (Brandi Cunningham), who happens to be Brett's ex-girlfriend Carla Brewster. She eventually uses her lip-cupped bra to bite off Brett's genitals, killing him.  Meanwhile, when Alistair starts figuring out what's going on, Janet falls prey to the bong and passes out. A man named Jimbo Leary ([[Tommy Chong]]) randomly enters the room and proclaims that the bong is his. He also explains that the bong (named Eebee) has a voodoo curse on it and that once you take enough hits from it, it brings you to the "Bong World" (the strip club) and kills you. In order to save Janet, Alistair takes a hit from the bong and is instantly sent to the bong world. Meanwhile, Jimbo tries destroying the bong with a hammer, chainsaw, and (resorting to drastic measures) a bomb. Eebee unleashes marijuana smoke from her bong, causing Jimbo to inhale and pass out.  Meanwhile, in the Bong World, Eebee forces the strippers to seduce Alistair, but he breaks them off. During his search, he bumps into [[Trancers|Jack Deth]]. Once he finds a stoned Janet, Eebee reveals her motives: to control the world by turning everyone into stoners by turning the air into pot smoke and the oceans into bong water. They take "vitamins" (that Jimbo gave them) to make them sober again. Jimbo, who has just got sucked into the bong world, tells them to go ahead and escape while he takes care of Eebee. Jimbo comes up to Eebee and shows Eebee the time bomb now strapped to his chest. Jimbo activates the bomb and blows up Eebee and apparently Jimbo himself. Back in the real world, Alistair and Janet wake up, with Larnell, Brett, Luann, and Bachman coming back to life. Jimbo, however, has been killed, along with the bong, which is now shattered into pieces. Alistair and Janet remember what had happened previously in the Bong World, but the rest of the group doesn't seem to remember right away. The last scene shows that Jimbo is now the king of the Bong World.  
The Exam
  Five friends (Mert, Sinan, Gamze, Kaan and Uluç) are set to sit for the daunting nationwide university entry exam. Desperate to get a passing grade, they try to pool their resources together and enlist the services of a professional thief/assassin (Charles) for hire to steal the papers.  All five of them have good reasons to do so. For Mert, it is essential to get into university, as he promised to his mother dying of cancer. He is the head of the family, working hard to make a living, even stopped attending school. Because of that, Mert surely cannot pass the entrance exam, so he needs to find other ways. He is in love with Gamze, whom he had cheated on before and so the girl doesn't approve of him anymore. Gamze's parents are in a continuous fight with each other which frustrates the young girl, making her want to flee from home - she needs to get into a university. Sinan's police officer father treats him badly, sure if he cannot pass the exam his cruel father would beat him up. The honest and good student Kaan is under pressure also by his family who want him to be a doctor - but no matter much he works, it is never enough for his maximalist father, not to mention Kaan doesn't want to be a doctor but rather would like to become a bass guitarist. Uluç's father is always telling his son to study, not to become a poor man like himself.   First the friends try the legal way of getting things done: study. But however hard they study, they cannot please their parents. It seems to be impossible to study for their lessons and for the exam as well, which demands different knowledge. They - and especially outcast Mert - are also harassed by the corrupt headmaster, Rafet, who only wants to make as much money out of extra lessons given to the students, as much is possible. The only person who wants to do good for the school is Zeynep, the assistant of the headmaster.  The friends finally decide to steal the Mathematics test from the teacher's bag, when she is out to lunch. They precisely plan the operation and finally succeed. Nonetheless they discover that this won't help them at the [[ÖSS]], the university entrance exam. So Sinan, frustrated by his policeman father's corruptness, tells the others to plan the theft of the exam papers as well. First they visit a former student of their school, Levent, who has become a famous and wealthy man and was rumoured to have been close to steal the ÖSS exam papers. He senses their plans and tells them off, offering the worried Zeynep his help to teach a lesson to the guys. So the heroes have to find another way.   Uluç tells them a story how he saved the life of a British secret agent when he was a little boy and how he got a cup from this Charles as a reward, telling Uluç that he "is obliged to him". So Uluç keeps sending emails to every Charles in Britain hoping to find the agent. Finally he gets an answer from the Charles he was seeking. The friends start collecting money (by doing various jobs) to pay for Charles's expenses and invite him to steal the exam papers. Charles ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]) arrives and tells his plan of the theft. He enters the building at night and manages to steal the documents and give them to the overjoyed students. Kaan, however, refuses to have a look at the papers, he says that his sense of honesty doesn't allow this. He had studied hard and done the questions of the previous year's exam. The others start memorising the answers and finally the "great day" arrives and they sit for the exam. The parents are waiting outside for the results, proudly watching their children enter the exam building. As soon as they start reading the questions they realise that they are different from what Charles had given them. It turns out that Charles is really Jean-Claude Van Damme (as Kaan had suspected when the plane landed saying: "He looks like Jean-Claude Van Damme, are you sure this is Charles?"), and that he was asked to play for the role of Charles by Levent, the wealthy former student of their school, as he and Jean-Claude are old friends. So the students - except Kaan, who really did study - are taught a very difficult lesson about honesty and fairplay. In the end we see Mert's mother fall off the bench in the park opposite the window at which Mert is sitting. Mert hurriedly leaves the exam and runs out only to find his mother dead. The film ends with Mert taking his dead mother into his arms.  Throughout the film we can see moments of a horserace - the rush for the university entrance is like a race for horses where only the best fed and best trained horses can win and the jockeys do everything to rush the horses, just like the teachers and parents push the children.   The film shows how important the university entrance exam is in [[Turkey]] and how frustrating this "race" is for these 18-year-old young people, that the system is unfair and far from sufficient, as Levent says to Zeynep when talking about 'crime and punishment': "Have you ever wondered why our students are not taught [[Dostoyevski]]? Because their minds might awake".  
Factory Girl (film)
 The film is framed by [[Edie Sedgwick]] ([[Sienna Miller]]) being interviewed in a hospital several years after her time as an [[Warhol superstar|Andy Warhol superstar]].  In the mid 1960s, Edie is a young heiress studying art in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. She moves to [[New York City]] with her friend, [[Chuck Wein]] ([[Jimmy Fallon]]). She is introduced to [[pop art]] painter and film-maker [[Andy Warhol]] ([[Guy Pearce]]), who is intrigued by the beautiful, clearly troubled socialite. He asks her to perform in one of his underground, [[experimental films]]. She agrees and goes on to star in several of Andy's projects, becoming his [[Muse#Modern use|muse]].  She and Chuck become part of the tightly-knit, bohemian social scene at Andy's famous art studio, [[the Factory|the Silver Factory]]. Edie's status as a Warhol superstar and rising [[youthquake (movement)|youthquake]] fashion model earn her fame and international attention. The success, however, fails to ease her psychological issues. Although descended from a prestigious family lineage and raised on an idyllic, California ranch, Edie was [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by her father during childhood. She has been further shaken by the fairly recent death of her favorite brother, Minty. Her trauma manifests itself in [[Shopping addiction|uncontrolled spending]], poor money management and a burgeoning drug habit.  Edie's Cambridge friend, Syd ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), visits her in New York City and introduces her to folk singer Billy Quinn ([[Hayden Christensen]]), a character based on [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name="Dylan's got it wrong about my movie, says Sienna"></ref> Edie and Billy begin a relationship, which causes Andy to become jealous. Edie attempts to make peace between the two men by arranging a screen test for Billy at Andy's Factory.  When Billy and his posse arrive, they act disrespectfully towards Andy. Billy and Edie fight and he tells her that Andy is a "bloodsucker" who will "kill" her. She tearfully responds that she "can't hate him." Realizing that she has chosen Andy over him, Billy leaves her.  Edie's worsening drug addiction begins taking its toll. Her relationship with Andy deteriorates and she becomes a [[Outcast (person)|pariah]] among the Factory crowd. One night, while in a drug-induced stupor, she falls asleep with a lit cigarette and nearly dies in the ensuing apartment fire. ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', which once championed her as the newest [[It girl (disambiguation)|"it" girl]], now refuses to hire her; editor Diana Vreeland ([[Illeana Douglas]]) explains that Edie is considered "vulgar" due to her current lifestyle.  When Syd visits Edie again, she is barely conscious and is being filmed naked by three strangers in her apartment. Syd kicks the men out and looks after Edie. He gets them a taxi and shows her a photo of herself back in Cambridge. He says she inspired him back then and she can be an artist once more. Edie, deeply upset at how far she's fallen, gets out of their cab and runs frantically down the street.  The scene transitions to the framing device of Edie's interview several years later. She tells the interviewer that she is overcoming her addiction, pursuing art again and is glad to be home in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. The closing caption explains that Edie spent her last few years struggling to remain clean. Her short marriage to a fellow patient ended when she died of a [[Barbiturate#Recreational use|barbiturate overdose]] at the age of twenty-eight.  Meanwhile, in New York City, Andy is interviewed the day after Edie died in 1971. When the interviewer asks about her and Andy's "breakup," Andy becomes visibly uncomfortable and says it was so long ago and he hardly knew her at all.  
Facing the Giants
 In 2003, Grant Taylor (Alex Kendrick) is the head coach at Shiloh Christian Academy, and has yet to post a winning record in his six-year tenure. After his seventh season begins with a three-game losing streak, the players' fathers start making noises about replacing him with defensive coordinator Brady Owens. This is not the only problem Grant is facing; his car is breaking down, and he discovers that he is the reason that his wife Brooke cannot become pregnant.  He creates a new coaching philosophy and decides to praise God, no matter what the result. At the same time he guides and urges each one of his players to give the maximum effort, and motivates them to believe they can win under God's guidance. This influence spreads to the rest of the school.  From that point on, the Eagles win all their remaining regular season games after losing the first three and make the state playoffs.  As a result, Grant is given a raise in salary rather than being fired and is also provided with a brand-new truck from grateful boosters.  The Eagles lose their playoff opener, but are declared the winner after the opponent used ineligible players.  The Eagles then advance all the way to the state championship game against the three-time defending champion Richland Giants.  Even though the Eagles have only a third as many players as the Giants, the Eagles hold their own and ultimately win the game on a 51-yard field goal from a backup kicker who had never kicked more than a 35-yarder before.  Grant's prayers for children are also answered as he and Brooke have children after two years.  
Expiration Date (film)
 The story is told by a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] elderly man to a Native American boy who wants to give up dancing and leave the reservation by bus. The story he tells is about a Native American man named Charlie Silvercloud III who thinks that he will be hit by a milk truck on his 25th birthday, like his father and grandfather before him due to a curse. His birthday is two weeks away. Charlie has a checklist of things he wants to do before his two weeks are up, but because he does not have long to live and has no way to do anything extreme, his list is somewhat more practical than most "bucket" lists. His checklist includes canceling his cellphone contract, watering the plants, and returning library books. His mother tries to prevent the curse from killing him by mapping the milk truck route and is trying to stop Charlie from going outside during certain times just in case he might be killed earlier than expected. While looking for a casket to buy for his assumed death, he meets Bessie Smith who is looking for casket for her mother. Bessie owns a dog named Roadkill because he is able to play dead so convincingly that crowds gather when he plays dead. Bessie and Charlie start seeing each other, but Charlie cannot decide if he should continue the relationship because of his impending death. Things become more complicated when Charlie finds out that Bessie is being stalked by a man who drives a milk truck for the local dairy.  
Eye of the Dolphin
 A troubled fourteen-year-old girl named Alyssa ([[Carly Schroeder]]) has been living with her grandmother Lucy ([[Katharine Ross]]) since the death of her mother a year before. After being suspended from school for smoking, Alyssa is brought to the Bahamas to live with Hawk ([[Adrian Dunbar]]), the father she never knew she had. Alyssa's arrival on the island comes at a decisively inconvenient time for Hawk, a dolphin researcher, whose prickly personality puts him at odds with local politicians, who feel that the local economy needs good relations with tourists. It is a difficult relationship at first between Alyssa and her father, but Tamika ([[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]]), Hawk's girlfriend, and Daniel ([[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]]), Tamika's father, smooth the way. Alyssa soon adjusts to island life, and she discovers the gift that she shares with her father for communicating with dolphins, a skill which leads her into a powerful relationship with a wild dolphin which her father, for legitimate scientific reasons, cannot condone. But when the powers-that-be threaten to close down her father's research station, it is Alyssa and her wild friend who hold the key, and they have the power to bring all parties together.  
Exorcism: The Possession of Gail Bowers

Father Bates is first alerted to the matter by a local couple, Clark and Anne Pederson ([[Griff Furst]] and [[Noel Thurman]]). Clark, a worker for [[Dead Men Walking (film)|Blackthorn Industries]], tells of the problems that the neighborhood faces as the result of Gail's possessions, and that medical science has failed to make amends.  Using what powers are available, Father Bates visits Gail in her home and begins to perform an exorcism. It is during this service that the malevolent forces possessing Gail begin to fight back against the priest, and force themselves to be revealed for the first time.

Failure to Launch
 Tripp ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), a 35-year-old man, is still living with his parents Al ([[Terry Bradshaw]]) and Sue ([[Kathy Bates]]) in [[Baltimore]]. Tripp's best friends Demo ([[Bradley Cooper]]) and Ace ([[Justin Bartha]]) are also still living in their parents' homes and seem proud of it. Tripp has a number of meaningless romances; when he gets sick of the women, he scares them off by inviting them to “his place,” and after seeing he lives at home, they promptly dump him, leaving him free again. Al and Sue are fascinated when their friends, whose adult son recently moved away from home, reveal that they hired an expert to get their son to move out.  The expert is Paula ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]), who believes that men continue to live at home because they have low self-esteem. Her approach is to establish a relationship with the man to build his confidence and transfer his attachment from his parents to her. However, upon meeting Tripp, she finds that he does not fit any of her previous profiles, having normal social skills and no problems with self-esteem.  He also has a good job which he enjoys. After an awkward encounter with his parents, Paula thwarts his attempt to dump her and has sex with him, all the while developing real feelings for him. She and Tripp find themselves sailing unfamiliar waters and confide in their friends.  Paula's vocation exasperates her roommate Kit ([[Zooey Deschanel]]), who believes that Paula took the job because she once had her heart broken by a man who lived with his parents. Paula, on the other hand, is shocked when she finds out why Tripp lives at home: his life collapsed when his fiancée suddenly died, and his family has been his source of solace ever since.  Ace discovers what is going on and blackmails Paula for a date with Kit; although Kit is more attracted to Demo, she and Ace wind up falling in love. Ace then outs Paula to Demo, who in turn reveals all to Tripp. Tripp angrily confronts his parents and breaks up with Paula. Wracked with guilt, Paula refunds Al's and Sue's money. After an awkward confrontation, Tripp manages to forgive his parents, but he cannot forgive Paula for manipulating him.  Tripp's parents and friends devise a plan to reconcile the two lovers. They tie up and gag Tripp and lock him and Paula together in a room. Paula pours her heart out to him, and he finally forgives her. The film ends with Al and Sue in their [[Empty nest syndrome|empty nest]], happily singing "Hit the Road, Tripp," fading into the closing credits playing the [[Hit the Road Jack|Ray Charles song]], and Tripp sailing away with Paula on his newly purchased boat.  
Falkenberg Farewell
 The film presents five childhood friends in their twenties who have grown up together in the town [[Falkenberg]]. The movie chronicles what they call "their last summer" in the town, faced with the prospect that sooner or later they have to move up to [[Gothenburg]]. Their lives in Falkenberg currently circle around nothing and each other: Holger, who seems to be the central figure of the five, faces fears of moving away from his hometown and becoming clichéd; his brother John, grumpy and lazy; Jesper, the only member of the group who already attempted to move away from the town, but ends up coming back nevertheless; Jörgen, who is in the process of setting up a catering business, but without much prospect; and David, the sensitive loner and Holger's best friend, whose diary serves as a narration for the story. The film offers vignettes of the seemingly empty lives of the five: wandering in nature, dealing with the parental expectations, swimming in the sea and burglarizing homes (although more as a pastime activity opposed to a financial source).  At the climax of the movie, David wraps up his diary and mails it off to Holger. He then packs up a shotgun, goes out to the forest and commits suicide. Holger is initially distraught, but eventually, as David predicted in his diary, "life goes on" and the remaining friends settle back into their former routine of killing time and facing their inevitable prospects.  
Faith like Potatoes
  When Angus Buchan, a white [[Zambia]]n farmer of Scottish origin, emigrates to escape political unrest and worrying land reforms, he looks south for a better life. With nothing more than a trailer in the untamed bush, and help from his Zulu foreman, Simeon Bhengu, the Buchan family struggles to settle in their new homeland. Faced with ever-mounting challenges, hardships and personal turmoil, Buchan quickly spirals down into a life consumed by anger, fear and destruction. Finally, his wife convinces him to attend a local church, where the religious testimony of other farmers influence his decision to give his life to [[Jesus Christ]]. His outlook takes a complete turnaround, and [[supernatural]] occurrences begin to happen when Angus prays in faith. He begins giving his testimony in different towns, and eventually gathers thousands of people in [[Kings Park Stadium]] for a time of unified prayer for the nation and for the land. Traditionally a maize and cattle farmer, Buchan decides to plant potatoes. [[Scientist]]s had warned the farmers not to plant that season unless they had irrigation. Because of the unprecedented drought, planting potatoes would be a massive risk. Believing he is led by the Lord, he plants potatoes in the dry dust. When harvest time comes, there is a crop of giant potatoes.  
Falling for Grace
 Grace Tang ([[Fay Ann Lee]]) is an ambitious [[Wall Street]] [[investment banker]] raised in New York’s [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].

When she is finally invited to her first high-end soiree, a Junior Committee meet-and-greet for a prestigious opera company, she is accidentally mistaken for an heiress from [[Hong Kong]], also named Grace Tang. Her efforts to correct the mistake lose some of their forcefulness when she is subsequently introduced to handsome Andrew James Barrington, Jr. ([[Gale Harold]]), who is dating committee-member Kay Douglas ([[Stephanie March]]).

Grace, unable to extricate herself gracefully from what she saw initially as an innocuous white lie, finds herself pretending that her parents are an old couple whom she visits as a volunteer. Meanwhile, Andrew Sr. is helping to shepherd a fashion-company buyout at Grace's bank, with a company that exploits sweatshop works. Grace finds herself secretly caught in the middle  When her brother Ming ([[Ken Leung]]) inadvertently reveals the truth to Andrew, Andrew leaves the budding romance, of which Kay is unaware.

The Fall (2006 film)
 In 1915 Los Angeles, [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] Roy Walker ([[Lee Pace]]) is hospitalized, bedridden and possibly paralyzed after taking a jump in his first film. He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake, [[Alexander the Great]]. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day.  The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-[[slave]] named [[Ota Benga|Otta Benga]] (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), [[Charles Darwin]] ([[Leo Bill]]) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious ([[Daniel Caltagirone]]) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic.  Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing [[morphine]] from the hospital pharmacy. Roy intends to use the morphine to commit [[suicide]] because the woman he loves has left him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills, having mistaken the "E" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a "3". The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: while Roy is the masked bandit, she is his daughter.  Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all. The next morning, Roy awakens from his sleep and realizes he is only alive because his neighboring patient is receiving a [[placebo]] rather than actual morphine. Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy. She climbs onto the cabinet but loses her footing, falls, and is badly injured. She receives surgery, after which she is visited by Roy, where he confesses his deception. He encourages Alexandria to ask someone else to end the story, but she insists on hearing Roy's ending. Roy reluctantly begins the rest of the story.  The heroes die one by one, and it seems that Governor Odious will be triumphant. Alexandria becomes upset, and Roy insists, "It's my story." She declares that it is hers too and exerts some influence on the course of the tale. Finally, the epic tale comes to an end with only the Bandit and his daughter remaining alive and Governor Odious dying. Roy and Alexandria, along with the patients and staff of the hospital, watch a viewing of the finished  'flicker' that Roy appeared in. With everyone laughing, only Roy's smile is broken in confusion when he sees that his life-threatening jump has been edited out of the film as another stuntman jumps instead.  Alexandria’s arm heals and she returns to the orange orchard where her family works. Her voice-over reveals that Roy has recovered and is now back at work again. As she talks, a montage of cuts from several of silent films' greatest and most dangerous stunts plays; she imagines all the stuntmen to be Roy.  
Faltu
 The story is set around Ranirghat of [[Murshidabad District]] in [[West Bengal]] in the early 1950s. It is the story of a 20-year-old orphan called Faltu (faltu in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] means worthless, junk) and his search for the man who has fathered him. This is also the account of a village and its people, woven around a narrative with myriad moments and a lot of dramatic events.  Ranirghat is a village made up of refugees from the then [[East Pakistan]]. (Its current population is 148.) The lives of the villagers take a new turn when a census official questions Faltu's parentage. While it is well-known that Faltu is the son of Sureswari Dasi aka Suri Khepi (a mad woman on the street played [[Indrani Haldar]]), no one knows who his father is. Neither does Faltu nor he has even bothered with the question. He was happy with what he was doing &mdash; driving a bus and ferrying villagers.  The census official's question opens a [[Pandora's box]]. It turns out that many apparently upright men in the village &mdash; including Ismail ([[Biplab Chatterjee]]), who brought up Faltu and taught him driving &mdash; raped Suri Khepi, taking advantage of her mental condition. Everybody knows that Faltu's father is one of them, but nobody is sure of who that is. Faltu is not particularly concerned. He is more interested in earning his living, and pursuing his love interest &mdash; Tuktuki ([[Manjari Fadnis]]).  A government order brings in bad news for the villagers of Ranirghat. As part of "development" plans, the government wants to construct a bridge from the village across the river and villagers have to vacate. They agree to do so but, before parting ways, they want Faltu and Tuktuki to get married to make up for what they had done to Suri Khepi. A guilty feeling haunts all the rapists.  The elders of the village call a meeting to organize the marriage. When they propose the marriage to Tuktuki's father, he flatly disagrees in a weird manner. He goes to Faltu and discloses that he also had raped Suri Khepi: The marriage should not occur as Faltu and Tuktuki are stepbrother and sister. Tuktuki overheard this. She commits suicide, and the next morning she is found hanging from a tree. The villagers of Ranirghat left with pain-stricken hearts, while the background narrator declares that "with a proud and wounded heart, and several questions in mind, the undefeated Faltu drives on."  As the construction work of the bridge goes on, the last bit of film captures a night sequence at the construction site: an engineer, sensing the presence of any unknown one, turns on his torch on the person. The last scene freezes there, showing another mad woman trying to drink water from the streamlets pouring down from the upper iron structure. Like the case of Suri Khepi, perhaps this was the beginning of another story of committing sins.  The entire story deals with human relations and how the guilt of having done something wrong haunts everyone in the village. They want to make up for their sins, but end up opening a new can of worms and spoiling a marriage.  
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift

When Sean cuts through a structure and catches up to Clay, Clay hits Sean's car repeatedly until they reach a high-speed turn, which causes both cars to crash; Sean's car is totaled. Clay and Cindy's wealthy families help them escape punishment, but because Sean is a repeat offender for street racing, he is sent to live in Tokyo with his father, a U.S. Navy officer, in order to avoid juvenile detention or jail.  While in Tokyo, Sean befriends Twinkie, a [[military brat]] who introduces him to the world of [[drift racing]] in Japan. Sean has a confrontation with Takashi — the Drift King (DK) — over Sean talking to Takashi's girlfriend, Neela. Though forbidden to drive, Sean decides to race against Takashi, who has ties to the [[Yakuza]]. He borrows a [[Nissan Silvia]] from Han, now a business partner to Takashi, but loses his first race with Takashi and ends up totaling the car due to his inability to [[drifting (motorsport)|drift]].  To repay his debt for the car he destroyed, Sean agrees to work for Han. This leads to the duo becoming friends, with Han agreeing to teach Sean how to drift. Han also loans him a [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]] for future races, explaining that he is helping him as Sean is the only person willing to stand up to Takashi. Sean moves in with Han and soon masters drifting, gaining some clout after defeating DK's right-hand man, Morimoto. Sean soon asks Neela out on a date, and learns that after her mother died, she moved in with Takashi's grandmother, which resulted in their relationship. Takashi beats up Sean the next day, telling him to stay away from Neela; Neela subsequently leaves Takashi and moves in with Sean and Han.  Takashi's uncle Kamata, the head of the Yakuza, reprimands Takashi for allowing Han to steal from him. Takashi and Morimoto confront Han, Sean, and Neela about the thefts. Twinkie causes a distraction, allowing Han (in his [[Mazda RX-7]]), Sean, and Neela (both in a [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]]) to flee, who are then pursued by Takashi and Morimoto (driving their respective [[Nissan 350Z]]s). During the chase, Morimoto is killed in a crash, leaving Takashi to pursue the trio on his own. Han allows Sean to overtake him in order to hold Takashi off, but the chase ends when Sean and Neela crash. Meanwhile, moments after escaping from Takashi, Han is critically injured from a car accident. Han's car explodes, dying instantly just seconds before Sean has a chance to save him.  Takashi, Sean, and his father become involved in an armed standoff which is resolved by Neela agreeing to leave with Takashi. Twinkie gives his money to Sean to replace the money Han stole, which Sean then returns to Kamata. Sean proposes a race against Takashi, with the loser having to leave Tokyo. Kamata agrees to the challenge, but on the condition that the race take place on DK's mountain. With all of Han's cars impounded, Sean and Han's friends then rebuild a 1967 [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]] that Sean's father was working on, with a [[Nissan Skyline GT-R|Nissan Skyline]] [[Nissan RB engine#RB26DETT|engine]] salvaged from Han's Silvia that was totaled by Sean in his first drift race, and other spare parts.  That night, on the mountain, crowds gather to see the race; Takashi takes the lead initially, but Sean's training allows him to catch up. Determined to win, Takashi resorts to ramming Sean's car, eventually missing and driving off the mountain while Sean crosses the finish line. Kamata keeps his word, and lets Sean remain in Tokyo and is now christened the new Drift King.

Fido (film)
 The film takes place in a 1950s-esque [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] where radiation from space has turned the dead into [[zombie]]s. This resulted in the "Zombie Wars", where humanity battled zombies to prevent a [[zombie apocalypse]], with humanity the ultimate victor. The radiation still plagues humanity, as all those who die turn into the undead, unless the dead body is disposed of by decapitation or cremation. In order to continue living normal lives, communities are fenced with the help of a governing corporation named ZomCon. ZomCon provides collars with accompanying remote controls to control the zombies' hunger for flesh so as to use them as menial task servants.  In the town of Willard housewife Helen Robinson ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]) buys a zombie in spite of her husband Bill's ([[Dylan Baker]]) zombie [[phobia]], as Bill had to kill his own father who had become a zombie and tried to eat him. Their son, Timmy ([[K'Sun Ray]]), befriends the zombie, naming him "Fido" (little is revealed of his "pre-zombie" life, except that he likely died of [[myocardial infarction]] as evidenced by the chest incision). One day, Fido's collar malfunctions and he accidentally kills their next door neighbor, who turns into a zombie. Timmy "kills" the zombified neighbor later, but not before she kills and infects another person, causing a small zombie outbreak. ZomCon security forces quell the situation and then investigate what caused the outbreak.  When a pair of local bullies get caught shooting a ZomCon officer they are suspected of shooting the missing neighbor but they point the blame on Fido who hurt them when they tried bullying Timmy.  The bullies later capture Fido and Timmy who are out on a walk in the country. Fido escapes and in a parody of Lassie is sent by Timmy to go home and find Helen, who comes and rescues Timmy from the bullies (who, through their own misadventure and Fido's hunger for human flesh, are now zombies), and they try to forget about the whole thing. Several days later, the neighbor's body is 'uncovered' and the murder is traced back to Fido, who is taken away to ZomCon where the family is told he will be destroyed. Timmy learns through Cindy Bottoms ([[Alexia Fast]]), daughter of Jonathan Bottoms ([[Henry Czerny]]), ZomCon's zealous security chief, that Fido has been put to work in a factory at ZomCon. Timmy sets out to rescue him with the help of Mr. Theopolis ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]), a previous Zomcon employee who was forced To leave when it was discovered he was suspected of fraternizing with his attractive female zombie.  Meanwhile, Timmy locates Fido, but is captured by Mr. Bottoms, who attempts to throw Timmy into the zombie-infested "wild zone" that exists outside of the fenced communities as punishment for his becoming attached to a zombie. Bill comes to the rescue and is killed in a struggle with Mr. Bottoms, who in turn is killed by Fido. Timmy is set free and the news media states that the ZomCon security breach was the fault of rednecks who venture out into the wild zone to hunt zombies for fun. Helen gives Bill the headless funeral he always wanted in order to prevent his zombification. The film ends with Fido as a surrogate father to  Timmy, Helen and Helen's newborn baby. They, along with a few neighbors happily enjoy their new domestic lives together, including the zombified Jonathan Bottoms who is now under the control of his daughter.

Ficció
 Àlex, a shy and reserved filmmaker suffering from screenwriter's block, goes on holiday to a village in the Pyrenees to stay with his old friend Santi, who has a cabin there. Together the two friends go to have dinner with Santi's lesbian neighbor, Judith, who in turn is receiving the visit of a Monica, a violinist. At Judith's house an attraction between Alex and Monica starts almost imperceptibly over the dinner table when Monica identifies with the character that Àlex describes at the protagonist of his next film project. The friendship between Monica and Àlex develops further when they  go horseback riding.  During an excursion to the nearby lakes Àlex and Monica become separated from Santi and Judith on a mountain walk, and are forced to stay overnight in a mountain shelter. The wild setting is just right for romance and clearly there is a deep connection between them, but they do not act on their feelings of talk about them, instead their friendship deepens while talking about their lives. Àlex is married with two daughters. His wife, Silvia, was his high school sweetheart. Their marriage had not been an easy road and they even had to separate for one year. Monica has recently adopted a daughter from Africa. She has settled in the last two years with a journalist in the first steady relationship of her life.  Both Àlex and Santi ache to communicate but are embarrassed to do so. The usually carefree Santi has been re-evaluating his own aimless life in the face of mortality and is planning to have a child with Judith, a project that had to be postponed by Judith's recent health scare. Unable to find motivation in his self-imposed exile to finish his work, Àlex decides to return home early, and agrees to join Santi and the others on a final camping trip to the Pyrenees in a show of solidarity for their ailing friend before heading back to the city. However, when Alex and Monica become hopelessly lost after hiking on the wrong mountain on their way back to the base of the trail, the two find themselves drawn even further together by their shared misadventure. Similar to the unmotivated, 39-year-old protagonist of his latest film, Alex, too, faces a daunting blank page, vacillating between the commercial demands of his profession and integrity of his creative vision, youthful liberation and middle-aged inhibition. Like Àlex’s unfinished script, their brief encounter, too, remains an unwritten fiction charged with imagined possibility and resigned regret.  When Silvia, Àlex's wife, surprisingly appears at the countryside retreat with the couple two daughters, the connection between Àlex and Monica seems to have come to an abrupt ending. Monica, strolling around town, meets Alex's family. Her trip is near its end and she plans to leave the area early the next day. That morning Àlex, leaving his family still sleeping, take his car and reach Judith and his lesbian girlfriend who are driving Monica to take the train. Stopping on the road, Monica and Alex confess to each other the love that they are feeling; they kiss passionately and continued their lives separate ways.  
Find Me Guilty
 It's the late 1980s and low-level mobster Jackie DiNorscio ([[Vin Diesel]]) has just been shot by his junkie cousin Tony Compagna ([[Raúl Esparza]]), but refuses to press charges against him to police. Jackie soon gets arrested and is sentenced to thirty years on an unrelated drug bust.  Tony, afraid of reprisals from the extended mob family run by Nick Calabrese ([[Alex Rocco]]), agrees to be a government witness for district attorney Sean Kierney ([[Linus Roache]]), who intends to bring down dozens of organized crime figures all at once. Kierney tries to bribe Jackie to be a government witness as well, but it's not in the gregarious Jackie's nature to be a rat.  That sets in motion a massive court case where Jackie, Nick and dozens of other mobsters are tried together for a countless number of crimes in front of presiding Judge Sidney Finestein ([[Ron Silver]]). Upset with his current lawyer, who couldn't even keep him from doing a 30-year stretch, Jackie turns down an offer to be represented by lead defense attorney Ben Klandis ([[Peter Dinklage]]) and decides to represent himself in court, despite having no legal background or any real knowledge of how to proceed.  Jackie's mischievous and vulgar manner amuses the jury on occasions but persistently irritates the judge, lawyers, witnesses, and defendants, including his friends from the mob. As weeks turn into months, the court case evolves into a marathon affair. Jackie turns the courtroom into something of a three-ring circus. Ben begins to believe that maybe Jackie could be effective, but Nick Calabrese is furious and Judge Finestein repeatedly threatens the charismatic mobster with contempt of court.  Jackie's estranged wife, Bella ([[Annabella Sciorra]]), visits him in jail, where he is becoming increasingly frustrated. Guards spy on him and prosecuting attorneys remove his favorite chair, causing considerable pain to Jackie's injured back.  He apologizes to the court and tries to mind his manners in the end. The prosecutors and the defense return to their offices expecting the jury to deliberate for at least a week. However, the jury comes to a decision after only 14 hours of deliberation. The jury reaches a verdict of not guilty for all. The entire courtroom reaches pandemonium as the family celebrates. The entire family hugs the twelve jury members as they leave. Meanwhile, Jackie is the only one bound for jail, returning there to finish his sentence.

Believing the incident is due to an identity theft, Jack entrusts a colleague to take care of the claim. He goes out for a drink with Harry Romano who introduces him to Bill Cox, a potential partner. After they leave, Cox follows Jack into his car and forces him to drive home at gunpoint.  At home, Jack finds his wife Beth and two children unharmed, but under surveillance by Cox's henchmen.

Morteza orders Rouhi, a maid and bride-soon-to-be, to help the couple clean their apartment, though Mozhdeh initially insists that she is not required.   While she is doing her work, Rouhi learns piece by piece what is happening between the two: Mozhdeh suspects that Morteza is seeing their divorced neighbor, Simin, behind her back, after discovering Simin's phone number in the logs. Simin, meanwhile, is working as a beautician, which disturbs the neighborhood due to all the noises, eventually leading to a court order imposed against her to either quit or leave. As Morteza says that he would not come home until 5 PM, Mozhdeh sets Rouhi, who wants her eyebrow trimmed, to ask Simin if she is also unavailable until 5 PM; her fears are confirmed.  Simin, though, has enough time to trim Rouhi's eyebrows; there, Rouhi overhears that Simin knows when the Samiei are due to depart to Dubai. When she goes back to Samiei, she finds her [[chador]] taken by Mozhdeh, who wants to spy on Morteza, leaving her to take the Samiei's son, Amirali, home from school. Morteza is enraged upon learning these and publicly beats Mozhdeh. Fed up, Mozhdeh decides to move to her sister and brother-in-law's residence with Amirali, refusing to hear Morteza's apologies. To calm the situation down, Rouhi lies about the reason why Simin knows their departure time.  Morteza offers Rouhi a ride home in exchange for accompanying him and Amirali to see the fireworks. He leaves the two for a while and meets with Simin in private, confirming that the two are indeed having an affair; to his dismay, though, Simin wants them to separate, as she does not want to break up the Samiei. Rouhi later sniffs Simin's perfume scent on the way home (she has previously scented her hand with Simin's perfume) and realizes the truth. However, she ultimately chooses not to tell Mozhdeh.

 As three US servicemen – [[United States Marines|Marine]] Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]], Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]], and [[Hospital corpsman|Navy Corpsman]] [[John Bradley (Navy)|John "Doc" Bradley]] – are feted as heroes in a [[war bond]] drive, they reflect on their experiences via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]].  After training at [[Camp Tarawa]] in Hawaii, the [[28th Marine Regiment (United States)|28th Marine Regiment]] [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine Division]] sails to invade Iwo Jima. The Navy bombards suspected Japanese positions for three days. Sergeant [[Mike Strank]] is put in charge of Second Platoon.  The next day, February 19, 1945, the Marines land in [[Higgins boat]]s and [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|Amtracs]]. The beaches are silent and Private First Class [[Ralph Ignatowski|Ralph "Iggy" Ignatowski]] wonders if the defenders are all dead before Japanese heavy artillery and machine guns open fire on the advancing Marines and the Navy ships. Casualties are heavy, but the beaches are secured.  Two days later, the Marines attack [[Iwo Jima#Geographic features|Mount Suribachi]] under a rain of Japanese artillery and machine gun fire, as the Navy bombards the mountain. Doc saves the lives of several Marines under fire, which later earns him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]]. The mountain is eventually secured.  On February 23, the platoon under command of Sergeant [[Hank Hansen]] reaches the top of Mount Suribachi and hoists the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] to cheers from the beaches and the ships. Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]], who witnesses the flag raising as he lands on the beach, requests the flag for himself. Colonel Chandler Johnson decides his 2nd Battalion deserves the flag more. Rene is sent up with Second Platoon to replace the first flag with a second one for Forrestal to take. Mike, Doc, Ira, Rene, and two other Marines (Corporal [[Harlon Block]] and Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]]) are photographed by [[Joe Rosenthal]] as they raise the second flag.  On March 1, the Second Platoon is ambushed from a Japanese [[machine gun nest]]. During the fight over the nest, Mike is hit by a U.S. Navy shell and dies from his wounds. Later that day, Hank is shot in the chest and dies, and Harlon is killed by machine gun fire.  Two nights later, while Doc is helping a wounded Marine, Iggy is abducted by Japanese troops and dragged into a tunnel. Doc finds his viciously mangled body a few days later. On March 21, Franklin is killed by machine gun fire and dies in Ira's arms. Of the eight men in the squad, only three are left: Doc, Ira, and Rene. A few days after Franklin's death, Doc is wounded by artillery fire while trying to save a fellow corpsman. He survives and is sent back home. On March 26, the battle ends and the U.S. Marines are victorious.  After the battle, the press gets hold of Rosenthal's photograph. It is a huge morale booster and becomes famous. Rene is asked to name the six men in the photo; he identifies himself, Mike, Doc, and Franklin, but misidentifies Harlon as Hank. Rene eventually names Ira as the sixth man, even after Ira threatens to kill him for doing so.  Doc, Ira, and Rene are sent home as part of the seventh bond tour. When they arrive to a hero's welcome in [[Washington, DC]], Doc notices that Hank's mother is on the list of mothers of the dead flag raisers. Ira angrily denounces the bond drive as a farce. The men are reprimanded by Bud Gerber of the [[United States Treasury Department|Treasury Department]], who tells them that the country cannot afford the war and if the bond drive fails, the U.S. will abandon the Pacific and their sacrifices will be for nothing. The three agree not to tell anyone that Hank was not in the photograph.  As the three are sent around the country to raise money and make speeches, Ira is [[survivor guilt|guilt-ridden]], faces discrimination as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and descends into alcoholism.  After he throws up one night in front of General [[Alexander Vandegrift]], commandant of the Marine Corps, he is sent back to his unit and the bond drive continues without him.  After the war, the three survivors return to their homes. Ira still struggles with alcoholism and is never able to escape his unwanted fame. One day after being released from jail, he hitchhikes over 1,300 miles to [[Texas]] to see Harlon Block's family. He tells Harlon's father that his son was indeed at the base of the flag in the photograph. In 1954, the [[Marine Corps War Memorial|USMC War Memorial]] is dedicated and the three flag raisers see each other one last time. In 1955, Ira dies of exposure after a night of drinking. That same year, Doc drives to the town where Iggy's mother lives to tell her how Iggy died, though it is implied that he does not tell her the truth. Rene attempts a business career, but finds that the opportunities and offers he received during the bond drive are rescinded. He spends the rest of his life as a janitor. Doc, by contrast, is successful, buying a funeral home. In 1994, on his deathbed, he tells his story to [[James Bradley (author)|his son, James]], and in a final flashback to 1945, the men swim in the ocean after raising the flags.

He is grooming her older brother, Howard, to take over the ranch and sends Katy away to a private school where she feels like a misfit. Rob is having trouble understanding his daughter as she continually defies his authority to follow her own path. When she comes home for the summer, Katy is met with her father's disapproval because she did not finish a writing assignment at school, but is greeted by her mother, Nell, and Howard. Howard  wants to attend college. While out riding, Katy finds a wild [[mustang (horse)|mustang]], and feels a connection with the horse. She sets off to tame "[[wikt:flicka#Swedish|Flicka]]" ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for little girl), despite her father's protests.  Flicka is captured during a roundup, and Rob asks Katy not to go near Flicka. Determined to prove she can run the ranch, Katy starts training Flicka at night. Flicka slowly warms to Katy and the two develop a close bond. Rob sells Flicka to the rodeo, leaving Katy devastated. Nell and Howard are furious at Rob about making the decision without including them. Howard stands up to his father and says that he does not want the ranch and Rob refuses to take Flicka back. Howard and Nell refuse to help Rob with the ranch, which he is now considering selling since Howard does not want it. Katy starts writing about Flicka to escape her pain.   At the rodeo, Howard and Katy enter the competition that Flicka is being used in, hoping to get the horse back. Flicka runs from Katy until the girl calls her name. Rob tries to intervene and Katy freezes at the sight of him. Howard boosts his sister onto Flicka and the two escape. Katy becomes lost in the mountains, and allows Flicka to make her way towards the ranch. The family reconciles and searches for Katy as a fierce thunderstorm moves in. Katy and Flicka are attacked by a [[mountain lion]]. Flicka bolts, throwing Katy to the ground and the lion goes to attack her. Flicka protects Katy, but is badly wounded in the process. Katy binds Flicka's wounds and refuses to leave her in the storm, resulting in her developing a fever. Rob finds the two and brings a delirious Katy back to the house. As her fever spikes, Katy calls for Flicka as Nell tends to her. Rob thinks Flicka is mortally wounded and believes she should be put down. Overhearing the argument, a dazed Katy stumbles into the room and gives her father permission to "shoot us now."  Rob goes outside and begins to cry as he finally understands his daughter's feelings and her pain. A gunshot is heard and Katy bursts into tears, thinking Flicka is dead. The next morning, Nell finds Rob walking back to the house, supporting the injured Flicka. She runs outside to help and finds out that the gunshot was him shooting at the mountain lion. Both are stunned that Flicka is alive and decide not to put her down. Katy's fever breaks and she begins to recover. As he watches over his daughter, Rob reads the story that Katy had been writing about Flicka, eventually typing the story and sending it to the school so that Katy can pass for the year. When Katy wakes from the fever, she and Rob reconcile and he takes her to see Flicka. Rob apologizes to Howard and gives his son his blessing and Howard prepares for college. As a family, they decide to not sell the ranch, making it both a working ranch and a refuge for wild mustangs.

Five Fingers (2006 film)
 Martijn (Phillipe), a gifted Dutch [[jazz pianist]], flies to Morocco to set up a food assistance program. When he arrives, however, he and his travel guide, Gavin (Meaney), are quickly kidnapped by [[terrorist]]s, taken to an undisclosed location, bound and blindfolded. The captors swiftly shoot Gavin and then begin methodical attempts to extract information from Martijn about where he obtained the money to set up the program by cutting off his fingers one at a time. Martijn insists that he has no idea where the money came from, though in time it becomes clear that all is not what it seems. As the torture continues, Ahmat (Fishburne) tries his hardest to get answers from Martijn. Eventually, Martijn reveals to Ahmat that he was a terrorist and was going to poison fast food with bacteria, killing potentially thousands of Americans. After giving up the names of those within the Holland terrorist cell funding him for his alleged food program, Youseff, a man who had been filming Martijn, kills him. Ahmat is revealed to be a CIA agent and Gavin is revealed to be an American who had been with Ahmat the entire time. Ahmat and his girlfriend go for a drink, showing the [[Statue of Liberty]] revealing they had been in New York City the entire time.  
Flushed Away
 Roddy St. James is an [[upper class]] pet rat who makes his home in a posh [[Kensington]] flat. While his owners are away on holiday, a [[Everyman|common]] sewer rat named Sid comes spewing out of the sink and decides to stay, especially as [[England national football team|England]] is playing against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup final]]. Roddy schemes to get rid of Sid by luring him into the toilet, but Sid is not fooled, instead throwing Roddy in and flushing him away into the sewer.  Roddy discovers a city resembling [[London]], Ratropolis, made out of various bits of junk, and meets Rita Malone, an enterprising scavenger rat who works the drains in her faithful boat, the ''[[Jammie Dodgers|Jammy Dodger]]''. Rita is irritated by Roddy initially, but ends up taking him along. Her archenemy The Toad sends his rat henchmen, Spike and Whitey, after her for stealing back her father's prized [[ruby]]. The Toad loathes all rodents, and plans to have Roddy and Rita frozen with [[liquid nitrogen]] inside an icemaker. The pair escape, and Rita takes a unique electrical cable that is required to control Ratropolis' floodgates.  Roddy finds that the ruby is a fake and breaks it in front of Rita, enraging her. Roddy offers her a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington, to which she agrees, and the pair first stop to visit her family before setting off. During Roddy's stay, he overhears a conversation that causes him to think that Rita is selling him to The Toad, so he steals the Jammy Dodger. When Rita catches up to him, she is able to clear up the misunderstanding. The pair evade a pursuit from Spike, Whitey, and their accomplices, and incensed at his minions' repeated failures, The Toad sends for his French cousin, known as Le Frog. It is revealed that The Toad was once [[Prince of Wales|Prince]] [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]]' pet, but was replaced by a pet rat and flushed down a toilet, resulting in his hatred of rodents. Le Frog and his subordinates intercept Roddy and Rita and retrieve the cable, sinking the Jammy Dodger in the process, but the duo use a plastic bag to lift themselves out of the sewer and return to Roddy's home.  Roddy pays Rita the promised ruby and an emerald, then shows her around his house. She at first believes he has family in the home, but notices his cage and realizes he is a pet. Rita tries to persuade Roddy to come with her, but he is too proud to admit that he is lonely. She departs, but is soon captured by The Toad. Talking to Sid about half-time, Roddy pieces together The Toad's plan: to open the gates during halftime of the World Cup, when all the humans will most likely be using their toilets. As a result, a great sewage flood will form and drown Ratropolis in sewage, allowing The Toad to use the city as a home for his tadpole offspring. Roddy gives Sid his cushy position and has Sid flush him back to the sewers. He frees Rita, and together they defeat The Toad and his henchmen and freeze the wave of sewage with his liquid nitrogen.  Rita and Roddy build the "Jammy Dodger Mark Two" and set off in her. In a post-credits scene, Roddy's former owner Tabitha returns home with a new pet cat, which scares Sid.  
Flyboys (film)
  In 1916, during World War I, a group of young Americans go to [[France]], for different personal reasons, to fight in the French Air Service, ''L'[[History of the Armée de l'Air (1909–1942)#World War I (1914–1918)|Aéronautique militaire]]''. These American recruits are under the command of French [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Georges Thenault]], with the veteran [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] Reed Cassidy as their mentor.  During their training, each pilot struggles with the demanding flying; later, they have to face the [[Dogfight|aerial dogfights]] that dominate the front line missions. One of them, Blaine Rawlings meets a young woman named Lucienne whom he courts despite her hesitations about his risky profession.   On their first mission to escort two bombers to attack a German ammunition depot, the rookie pilots are ambushed by Germans and two are killed while flying; a third is forced to make an emergency landing. While on the ground he is killed by a ruthless German pilot identified as "The Black Falcon"; the more chivalrous German pilot Franz Wolferd shakes his head in disapproval.  During a later battle, Rawlings' single machine gun jams; Wolferd—the pilot whom he had been chasing prior to the jam— flies beside Rawlings, before saluting and banking away toward home, sparing his opponent's life.  Rawlings kills Wolferd when Wolferd dives after another American. After this, Rawlings is alarmed to learn that German forces are going to invade Lucienne's village. Despite others disapproving of his conduct, they let him go. He single-handedly rescues Lucienne and her two nephews and niece. He returns to base, and instead of being arrested for his misconduct, he is praised by their commander and awarded with the [[Croix de Guerre]] medal for bravery due to his courage.  During an attack on a German [[Zeppelin]], Reed Cassidy is mortally wounded by the Black Falcon but, as his final act, destroys the Zeppelin by crashing into it. Rawlings reunites with Lucienne before she leaves for Paris. Before Rawlings leaves for another battle, his plane is presented with an eagle, Cassidy's former insignia, and Rawlings is promoted to Commander. Their next mission is to escort four bombers which are being sent to bomb the same supply depot from the first mission.  Upon returning from the bombing mission, Rawlings takes off again to exact revenge on the Black Falcon. He is followed soon after by Jensen, who has recovered from his shock and saves Rawlings. During the final battle, despite having jammed guns and being wounded, Rawlings evades his enemy and fatally shoots the Black Falcon with his pistol. Rawlings and three other pilots (Jensen, Skinner, and Beagle) survive the encounter and return to base.  Jensen flies for the rest of the war and returns to Nebraska and receives a hero's welcome. Skinner enlists in the [[United States Army|US Army]] but is kept from flying due to his race; he later joins the [[Airmails of the United States|Airmail Service]]. Beagle marries an Italian woman and starts a [[flying circus]]. Rawlings goes to [[Paris]] but doesn't find Lucienne. He builds one of the largest ranches in [[Texas]], but never flies again.  
Footy Legends
 Set in [[Sydney]]'s western suburbs, ''Footy Legends'' tells the story of Luc Vu ([[Anh Do]]), a young [[Vietnamese Australian]] man with an obsession about [[rugby league football]]. Out of work and with welfare authorities threatening to take away his little sister ([[Lisa Saggers]]), because their parents are dead and Luc is deemed incapable of being a responsible guardian, Luc re-unites his old Yagoona High School "footy" team&mdash;whose members are now facing social problems such as long-term unemployment, drug addictions, the after-effects of teenage parenting&mdash;and wins a competition that offers a [[Holden Ute]] and a modelling job for [[Lowes Menswear]] as its prize. It is mostly comedy which is underpinned with serious social issues affecting [[western Sydney]].  The film features Vietnamese-language dialogue between Vu, Anne, and their aged grandfather.  
Flourish (film)
 The film tells the tale of Gabrielle Winters (Ria), a very smart and awesome. she elaborately recounts the disappearance of the sixteen-year-old girl she was babysitting. It also features the former [[The Torkelsons]] stars [[Connie Ray]] and [[Olivia Burnette]].  
The Flying Scotsman (2006 film)
 The film starts with Graeme Obree (Miller), who suffers from crippling [[bipolar disorder]], cycling into a wood where he prepares to hang himself. A flashback to Obree's ([[Sean Brown (actor)|Sean Brown]]) childhood depicts him being physically attacked at school by other pupils, leaving severe psychological scars. One day Obree is given a bicycle by his parents and we see Obree evading the bullies on his bike.  The adult Obree is married with a child. While competing in local races, he runs a failing cycle shop and has to supplement his income as a bicycle courier.  Baxter (Cox), a boatyard owner who is (unbeknownst to Obree) a minister, befriends the atheist Obree.  Obree decides to try and beat the hour record.  He has neither the funding nor the quality of bicycle required. Determined to succeed, he constructs "[[Graeme Obree#The bike|Old Faithful]]", a revolutionary bicycle designed by Obree for maximum efficiency, made up from scrap metal and components from a washing machine. With help from his friend and manager Malky McGovern (Boyd), Obree plans to break the world record in Norway.  His first attempt is a failure, but he tries again the following morning and succeeds. His victory is short-lived, and his record is broken by [[Chris Boardman]] (Adrian Grove (credited as Adrian Smith)) a week later. The [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] changes the rules to discourage Obree from using his experimental bicycle.  Obree is severely depressed the night following his record-making ride. This is exacerbated when Boardman breaks the record. When Obree is confronted in a pub by the four bullies who had victimised him years earlier at school, he becomes completely withdrawn and rarely leaves his house.  Baxter attempts to counsel him, but Obree feels betrayed when he discovers that Baxter is the pastor of a local church.  He recovers enough to compete in the [[Individual Pursuit]] World Championship in 1993, in which he uses his bicycle design again.  The UCI officials begin rigorously enforcing the new ruling, penalizing him for riding in the stance that his bicycle design is intended to support.  The physical and emotional exertion take their toll, and he crashes disastrously, breaking his arm.  The plot then returns to the opening of the film.  The rope Obree uses to hang himself breaks, and he is found by another cyclist who summons the authorities.  Obree initially resists treatment, until Baxter tells him about his wife, who also suffered from bipolar disorder and ultimately took her own life. At Obree's request, his wife, Anne, a hospital nurse, agrees to help him begin treatment.  Obree later makes a comeback and regains his world title.  The [[Graeme Obree#Old Faithful banned|new bicycle configuration]] that he uses, which supports the "Superman" stance, is later banned by the UCF after eight riders win gold medals with it.

For Horowitz
 Kim Ji-soo is a 30-year-old single woman who once dreamed about becoming a world-class pianist, but ends up opening a small neighborhood piano school on the outskirts of [[Seoul]], where she teaches children to play.  She then meets Yoon Gyung-min, a 7-year-old orphaned boy who starts pestering her for no apparent reason. Gyung-min's parents died in a car accident, and he now lives with his uncaring grandmother. He is a troublemaker, emotionally distant from his peers, and possibly [[autistic]].  When Ji-soo discovers that Gyung-min has untapped musical genius, she becomes determined to turn him into a renowned pianist like [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. She does this for her own selfish reasons, because if she gains the reputation of being a great piano teacher, that would lead to her school's success.  She uses music to communicate with her gifted student, ruthlessly giving him intensive piano lessons to prepare him for competitions. But their relationship turns maternal when Ji-soo realizes what the boy really needs is love.  
The Fountain
 At its core, ''The Fountain'' is the story of a 21st-century doctor, Tom Creo ([[Hugh Jackman]]), losing his wife Izzi ([[Rachel Weisz]]) to cancer in 2005. As she is dying, Izzi begs Tom to share what time they have left together, but he is focused on his quest to find a cure for her.  While he's working in the lab, she writes the story entitled the "fountain" about 16th century [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] losing her kingdom to the [[Inquisition]] while her betrothed, [[conquistador]] Tomás Verde, plunges through the [[Central America]]n forest in [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] territory, searching for the [[Tree of Life]] offering immortality for his Queen and their love.  As she does not expect to see it, Izzi asks Tom to finish the outcome of the story for her. As they look out to the star of a nebula, she imagines, as the Mayans did, that their souls will meet there after life and when the star goes supernova. In the 26th century, future space traveler Tommy travels there for the event, in a spaceship made of an enclosed [[biosphere]] containing the [[Tree of Life]] he seeded above her grave.  The three story lines are told [[Nonlinear narrative|nonlinearly]], each separated by five centuries. The three periods are interwoven with [[match cut]]s and recurring [[motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]]; Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play the main characters in all three narratives.<ref name="calhoun51–52"></ref> Even within a given narrative, the elements of that particular story are not told in chronological order.  Whether the actions in these stories are actual events, or symbolic, is not clarified; and, director Darren Aronofsky emphasized that the storylines in their time periods and their respective convergences were open to interpretation.<ref name="fulfilled"></ref> The director has said of ''The Fountain''s intricacy and underlying message, "[The film is] very much like a [[Rubik's Cube]], where you can solve it in several different ways, but ultimately there's only one solution at the end."<ref name="fulfilled" /> In a 2012 interview outlining the path of life depicted, Aronofsky stated that "ultimately the film is about coming to terms with your own death" oftentimes driven by love.<ref></ref>  ===Tomás the conquistador=== [[File:Berruguete, Pedro - Burning of the Heretics (Auto-da-fé) - c. 1500.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of an Inquisitor sitting on a throne before a large crowd|thumb|One of the film's narratives takes place during the [[Spanish Inquisition]].]] The film opens with [[conquistador]] Tomás Verde in [[New Spain]] fighting a horde of [[Maya civilization|Mayans]] to gain entry into a [[pyramid]], where he is attacked by a Mayan priest with a flaming sword. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that the conquistador has been commissioned by [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Spain to travel to the [[New World]] in search of the fountain of youth or [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Tree of Life]] and immortality. If Tomás can find it, she is convinced that she can put an end to the struggle between herself and an influential cleric during the [[Spanish Inquisition]] who is attempting to stop her search and usurp the throne. Isabella vows to spend eternity with Tomás upon his return, citing a correlation with [[Adam and Eve]]. When Tomás arrives at his destination, he finds that his fellow knights are exhausted and refuse to continue searching for the Tree of Life. A [[Franciscan]] monk discovers the location of the temple, but is killed while Tomás represses the mutiny amongst his officers. As the priest dies, he gives Tomás a ceremonial dagger and directs him towards the pyramid. Once he arrives at the pyramid, Tomás and his men are ambushed and Tomás is captured. He is forcefully directed to the top of the pyramid, and engages in  combat with a Mayan priest wielding a flaming sword. Tomás is stabbed in the stomach, but just as the priest is about to kill him, future Tommy appears before the figurehead. The priest believes Tomás is the "First Father", apologizes and asks Tomás to usher him down the path of awe by slitting his throat. Tomás sacrificially kills the priest and proceeds to a pool with a large tree; convinced this is the Tree of Life. Tomás applies some of its sap to his torso and is cured of his stab wound. He drinks the sap flowing from the bark. But in a reenactment of the Mayan creation myth told earlier in the film, flowers and grass burst forth from his body and he literally gives rise to new life.  ===Tom the neuroscientist=== Tom Creo is a doctor working on a cure using samples of the "Tree of Life", found through exploration in [[Central America]], which are being tested for medicinal use for [[degenerative diseases|degenerative]] [[brain diseases]] in his lab in 2005. He is motivated by his wife Izzi's [[brain tumor]], which has caused a rapid decline in her health. Izzi has used this time to assess the implications of death and comes to terms with her mortality, but Tom refuses to accept that she might die and has increasingly resolved to find a cure. She has written a book which apparently tells the story of Tomás the conquistador, but when she collapses at a museum, she becomes convinced that she won't live long  and asks Tom to write the final chapter and "finish it". She dies shortly thereafter and Tom dedicates himself to curing not only her disease, but death itself. His colleagues fear that this drive has made him reckless, but they support him scientifically and  emotionally at Izzi's funeral. As a final inspiration of love and devotion, Tom plants a [[Liquidambar|sweetgum]] seed at Izzi's grave in the manner of a story she told him relating how a Mayan guide's dead father lived on in a tree nourished by the organic nutrients of the buried body.  ===Tommy the space traveler=== This narrative for Tommy is set in [[Outer space|deep space]] in a small, self-contained [[biosphere]] bubble spaceship. Jackman's character in this plot is alone, flying in outer space toward the golden [[nebula]] of [[Xibalba]] with a large tree and a few personal effects comprising his ship. While traveling, he meditates, performs [[t'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], grows mushrooms and cuts pieces of bark from the tree for nourishment. He also converses with apparitions of Izzi. It is implied that the tree within the biosphere also represents Izzi and that Tommy has been transporting it to Xibalba with the hope that she will be restored to him. Tommy is also shown to have applied extensive, incremental tattooed ring patterns to both of his arms similar to the tattoo of his engagement ring from Izzi in 2006; it is implied that the tattoos mark the passage of time on his journey in 2500.  At the climax of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final apparition of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his accepted impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes [[supernova]], engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body, being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula, is disintegrated and absorbed by the tree causing it to flourish back to life.  Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.  
For Your Consideration (film)
 Character actress Marilyn Hack (O'Hara), despite having been in the entertainment industry for 30 years, is best known for playing a blind [[prostitution|prostitute]] in a film from the late 1980s. Victor Allen Miller (Shearer) is also an acting veteran who is known to the public as the hot-dog wearing mascot for a [[kosher]] line of frankfurters. Together they are cast in a new low-budget film called ''Home for Purim'' as the patriarch and dying matriarch of a Southern U.S. Jewish family in the 1940s.  A newcomer ''[[ingénue]]'', Callie Webb (Posey), plays their lesbian daughter, who has come home along with her girlfriend ([[Rachael Harris]]). Rounding out the cast is Brian Chubb ([[Christopher Moynihan]]), playing Webb's brother who has returned home from the Navy. The family reunites in time to celebrate the Jewish holiday of [[Purim]].  ''Home for Purim'''s cast and crew are in the process of making what appears to be a cheap melodrama. The director (Guest) is constantly adding bizarre camera shots and acting notes. The producer (Coolidge), heiress to a diaper service, dresses flamboyantly but doesn't seem to know much about managing a film beyond paying for expenses. The two writers (Balaban and McKean) are at odds with the director, seeing their script mash together Southern genteel with out-of-place Jewish references and words.  The [[Story within a story|film-within-a-film]]'s plot centers around the daughter's confession of her lesbianism as her mother gets nearer to death and the family celebrates an awkward Purim.   Because of an off-hand remark that turns into a full-blown rumor, Oscar buzz begins around all of the cast (with the exception of Chubb). Each begins obsessing about the award potential in his or her own way.  Hack pretends not to care while secretly pining for the award. Miller begins to demand a higher salary and push his agent (Levy) for more dignified work. Webb breaks up with Chubb (her boyfriend), claiming he is not being supportive. He is virtually left in the dark. The obnoxious entertainment news program ''Hollywood Now'' and its hosts (Willard and Lynch) fuel the awards-season buzz, even coming to the set to interview the cast.  At this point, studio executives butt in and force the writers to make script changes, feeling the film is "too Jewish." It is retitled ''Home for Thanksgiving''. Despite the changes, the Oscar buzz intensifies to the point where Hack, Miller, and Webb are convinced they will be nominated for Academy Awards. An inept publicist, Corey Taft (Higgins), becomes very excited about the film's word of mouth, even though he only has a vague idea of what the Internet is.   They all begin to do major press appearances for the film. These are often embarrassing, both for the actors and the movie audience. Miller appears on a hip-hop teen show called ''Chillaxin''' in youthful attire with capped teeth, a tan, and dyed blonde hair. Hack gets [[breast implant]]s and extensive plastic surgery to the point where her face is comically ecstatic. Callie goes on an L.A. [[shock jock|shock-jock]] radio show, only to field questions about topless scenes rather than her performance. All rise early in the morning for the televised announcement of the Oscar nominees, although Miller doesn't even own a TV.  Ultimately the only person nominated for an award is Chubb, the one person for whom there was no buzz at all. (He sleeps in on the morning of the announcement of the nominations.) Miller goes back to auditioning for food commercials and other infomercials for useless products. Webb revives her failed one-woman show, ''No Penis Intended''. Hack (after a drunken, explosive rant on ''Hollywood Now'') becomes an acting teacher and seems uncomfortably at peace with her mediocre career.  
Forget About It (film)
 A trio of retired military servicemen who find a suitcase of money near their [[Arizona]] trailer park. Little do they know it belongs to a [[mobster]] in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]]. The old men's neighbor is played by [[Raquel Welch]].  
Forbidden Quest
 At the start of the film, Kim Yoon-seo, an Inspections officer (police inspector) is seen at his home where his brother has been beaten almost to death. His family wants to submit a false appeal to the king accusing the family of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Lim family. The Lim family had by the past submitted a false appeal against Yoon-seo's family. However Yoon-seo does not wish to submit such an appeal, much to the anger of his elders.   He returns to the court where the King hands him an important assignment. The King's concubine, Jung-bin, had a painting she had drawn mounted, but it was replaced by an exact copy, she only realized because of the lack of a scribble she had drawn on the back. The King would like Yoon-seo to find the culprits. Yoon-seo is impressed by the talent of the artist who made the fraudulent copy. Jung-bin is in turn impressed by Yoon-seo's knowledge on the subject and invites him to talk to her some more about art some day.   Yoon-seo teams up with Lee Gwang-hun, an inspector who likes to torture people in his dungeons, to try to hunt down the culprit. They enter a shop in their search for the criminal. In the basement Yoon-seo encounters an old man transcribing an erotic story book. Back upstairs a group of men from the village enter the shop and engages in a fight with Gwang-hun, who beats them away with his truncheon, however Yoon-seo is knocked out so Gwang-hun takes him back to his house with him. When Yoon-seo awakes he admires Gwang-hun's painting artwork. Back at the shop the old man confesses to Yoon-seo that he does not wish to protect the mounter either, but that one of his friends is involved and he does not wish to betray him. After Yoon-seo has promised to protect his identity, the old man gives him an address he may go to. Out of curiosity before he leaves he reads few verses from the book the old man is reproducing. He is at first outraged by the content (pornography being illegal at the time), but when the old man says the whole city is waiting for the book he shows some interest and perhaps embarrassment about never having heard of the author. He reports later to the King that he found the culprits and had each flogged fifty times.   Jung-bin invites him around for tea, to thank him. When a bee lands on her he violates all protocol risking his death, by going beyond the curtain and brushing it off her shoulder. Jung-bin however does not report his attitude, and thanks him instead. She also appears to be very fond of him.   Yoon-seo writes an indecent book himself and returns to the shop to present to the shop keeper, asking him to read it. The shopkeeper, Hwang is impressed and they decide to copy and sell his work. His book becomes a best seller.  To get his books to sell better he asks Lee Gwang-hun to illustrate them for him. At first he is outraged but in the end accepts. Meanwhile, Jung-bin sends him an embroidered kerchief, by means of her eunuch, who asks him to not accept the present, or else Jung-bin will be wanting to meet him. He does accept though, and later meets Jung-bin, in private. They start to cuddle, but Yoon-seo leaves when she attempts to kiss him.   The illustrator has trouble understanding some of the things he is supposed to draw, so next time Yoon-seo meets Jung-bin, he has him hide behind a wall, and spy on them while they have sex. Yoon-seo writes about his affair with Jung-bin in his next book. When she forces the one of her maids to tell her, she goes to the shop and confronts Yoon-seo. She tells him to divulge the name of the illustrator Gwang-hun. However he refuses to betray him.   Jung-bin has Yoon-seo sent to the town prison, the prison for which Gwang-hun the illustrator is responsible. In the presence of Jung-bin, Yoon-seo is tied to the ceiling and severely beaten with sticks.   Gwang-hun wishes to stop but Jung-bin decides to call the matter to the King's attention. They tie Yoon-seo to a contraption, and Gwang-hun turns the handle until the bones of his legs snap in half. The King is satisfied with the torture but Jung-bin wants to continue, after their meal. During meal time Gwang-hun removes him from jail, so he can escape with the help of the book publisher, the shopkeeper. However Jung-bin's eunuch follows them and a fight ensues in between the people from the shop and a group of warriors the eunuch brought along. The shopkeepers are no match for the warriors, however Gwang-hun does put up a good fight. In the end he is beaten but is forced to leave with the people from the shop while the eunuch takes Yoon-seo back to his jail. Gwang-hun is left alive because Yoon-seo threatens to claim the eunuch as the illustrator, which would be possible because he did come with Jung-bin to all their meetings. On the way back the eunuch becomes more worried about what Yoon-seo may say and attempts to kill him. One of his warriors however chops off his hand to avoid him stabbing Yoon-seo. The eunuch is shocked and the warrior asks him why he disobeyed an order. The eunuch tells him he had an order from his heart also (he is secretly in love with Jung-bin, and became a eunuch to stay with her); at which point the warriors shoves his dagger through the top of his shoulder and down through his heart.  Yoon-seo is brought back to the palace and to Jung-bin and the King. Jung-bin decides she has had enough. The King asks her about her sudden change of mind. Then he tells her he knows that what she had wanted Yoon-seo to say all along was not the name of the illustrator, but that he loved her. The King can not understand why he did not lie and say he loved her.   The King tells the servant to castrate him and make him a eunuch so he may be with Jung-bin for the rest of his life, even though the operation may kill him due to his age. Jung-bin intervenes and takes all the blame saying she used her influence to seduce him. Yoon-seo then confesses his love to her. Jung-bin says she will wait till they meet again in the next life. The King is overcome by anger and grief, as he was most in love with her, and at first wants to personally kill both Jung-bin and Yoon-seo. He decides against this though, as he realizes that it would be useless as they would just be reunited in the afterlife, and leaves them both alive.   At the end Yoon-seo is sent to live in exile on an island, where he continues to write. Jung-bin remains at the palace "to rot." Later it is revealed that the words "indecent" were branded on Yoon-seo's forehead as part of his punishment.  The film ends with Yoon-seo, Gwang-hun and the shopkeeper walking along the shore, talking about future works, which include their first homosexual male erotic story, and even the discovery by Yoon-seo of the basic principles of animation or "moving pictures."

Free Jimmy
 ''The events of the original movie take place entirely in Norway; in the English-language version of the movie, the story begins in Britain, and ends up in Norway with the travelling circus.''  At night, an [[animal testing]] laboratory in grimy downtown [[Oslo]] is broken into by the "urban guerrillas", a group of bumbling, [[vegan]] [[animal rights activists]]. They first release some rabbits, which refuse to leave. They then set the rats free, then cats, which to the horror of the activists, eat the rats. They then release a small yapping dog which in turn, again to their horror, kills the cats. They bury the dead animals, vowing to at some point take revenge on "animal oppressing" society. One of them, Sonia, a highly-strung, anxiety-stricken woman, keeps the dog and names the dog "[[Karma]]".  Meanwhile, three inept [[stoner (drug user)|stoners]] and bungling [[habitual criminal]]s named Odd, Gaz and Flea (Odd, Geir and Kælle in the Norwegian version) sit around in a decrepit apartment, watching the news story about the lab break-in. Their shady American friend Roy Arnie arrives and offers them a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity with Circus Stromowski, a travelling Russian [[circus]] led by Ringmaster Igor Stromowski. The lads agree as they are in debt with Roy Arnie, and it is apparently a good money-raiser, and to escape a local gangster named Ivan. However, upon arriving at the circus, they find Stromowski to be utterly deranged, the acts dangerous, and performers suicidal. The entire circus is full of useless, miserable has-beens and tired animals that will only perform under the influence of [[narcotics]]. What's more, the four lads are actually to be [[animal handler]]s with the dangerous animals in the circus stable. The star attraction is "Jimmy", a captive large male elephant who is paranoid of police and with an earring and half a tusk sawn off. Roy Arnie gives Jimmy [[speed (drug)|speed]] to incite the animal to go crazy and perform in the ring for the spectators. At night, he gives Jimmy heroin to sedate him. Soon the elephant becomes [[Drug addiction|addicted]].  Roy admits to the others that he has stolen over a million pounds worth of heroin from a tanker owned by the [[Russian Mafia]], and that he joined the circus to escape them. The four lads hatch a plan to smuggle the heroin out of Norway by putting it inside the elephant. Roy makes an incision in Jimmy's buttocks, places the bags of drugs inside, and then sews it back up. He has a plan to set up his own circus with the money he makes from the heroin, the "Roy Arnie Circus", and believes Jimmy to be the key to his dream. However, on the night the lads plan to steal the elephant, Jimmy escapes when he is accidentally given speed instead of heroin, and bolts out of a door left open by the animal rights activists. Jimmy's drug-induced escape causes widespread chaos. Flea comically steals a van with no windshield in the ensuing chase of Jimmy, which leads them up into the frozen [[moorland]].  Three bizarrely-dressed [[Motorcycle|bikers]] who have been tailing the lads the whole time turn out to be members of the highly feared "[[Sami people|Laplander]] [[motorcycle gang]]" who have been hired by the Russians and are looking for the heroin, and revenge on Roy Arnie. After overhearing their conversations they learn of where the drugs are, and decide to first go after the elephant. Meanwhile, the animal rights activists are hot on Jimmy's trail with the intention of rescuing Jimmy. Jimmy is also hunted by a group of trigger-happy, [[redneck]]-type [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[big game hunter]]s ([[Trøndelag|'''trøndere''']] in the Norwegian version) want to shoot something bigger than a moose or a deer for a change. So begins a mad-cap cross-country [[road trip]] to find Jimmy, with each group having different motives. The four stoners crash a [[log cabin]] which is occupied by an elderly American couple, but the three Lappish Mafia bikers find them there, kill the couple, and torture the four stoners for information on the whereabouts of Jimmy the elephant.  Jimmy nearly dies on the moors as he begins to go through [[cold turkey|withdrawal]], although a seemingly intelligent and benevolent [[moose]] with golden antlers befriends the elephant and attempts to nurse him back to health by nudging him towards water and bringing him grass to eat. The moose pushes Jimmy into a rocky overhang, protecting the elephant from the elements. The moose forces Jimmy to stand on occasion by pushing him up and holding him up with his antlers, bringing back the strength in Jimmy's legs. Over the course of a few painful days, with the moose's help, Jimmy makes a full recovery from the drugs, and again becomes one with nature away from the ugly trappings of man.  When the groups converge on Jimmy's location, chaos ensues which results in most of the people involved getting killed in various ways, mostly violent and bloody. As the elephant and the moose escape into the sunset, the elephant accidentally steps on Sonia the activist's dog, Karma, splatting it. Sonia momentarily loses her temper and picks up one of the hunters' rifles and shoots Jimmy in the behind, unwittingly bursting the bags of heroin inside and causing Jimmy to die quickly of massive drug overdose. This causes Sonia to recoil in horror in what she has done, and she flees amidst nervous breakdown in the knowledge she has harmed an animal. The moose causes a landslide which buries Jimmy's body, and after the moose sits poignantly by the mound of rocks which now entomb the elephant, the moose gallops off into the sunset alone.  The only other survivors of the massacre, the four stoners, do not witness these events, and back at their apartment assault Roy for leading them to the situation in the first place, because of his mad circus dreams, and "for Jimmy", "our mate." Finally, Roy, full of remorse over his actions in the past, wanders out onto the moors alone to look for the elephant, unaware that Jimmy is already dead and entombed under rocks and out of sight. Roy disappears into a terrible [[blizzard]] calling out "Jimmy" in vain.

Olivia can't seem to find love or money and resorts to questionable tactics to satisfy both.  Franny's inheritance sometimes causes tension between her and her accountant husband, who likes to spend it.  Christine's marriage is falling apart because she and her husband can't communicate effectively.  Finally, Jane is becoming increasingly unpleasant to be around, possibly because of her discomfort with her age and her husband's sexual ambiguity. Together, these women attend charity benefits, have lunch, lean on each other, and wade their way through life.

Full Grown Men
 Alby Cutrera is a pathologically nostalgic guy who, at 35 years of age with a wife and young son, really just wishes he could ride his [[Schwinn Bicycle Company|Schwinn]] 5 speed around all day on a Cherry [[Slurpee]] high.   His wife Suzanne and son Josh love him because he's funny and creative but for Suzanne it’s getting old and there’s rent to pay. Finally losing patience with Alby, Suzanne kicks him out of the house with the unequivocal instruction: "Don't come back 'til you grow up!"   Alby's having none of ''that'' and does what any hopeless case of arrested-development would do – he goes back to Mom's house. There, after having his fill of eating [[Fruit Loops]] and watching cartoons on TV, he decides to look up his old best friend from childhood, Elias Guber.  Alby is thrilled to get back with his old pal and relive old times, but there’s a problem – Elias remembers a much less rosy version of their childhood – one in which he was Alby’s performing monkey. But as always, Elias can't resist Alby's entreaties to take him along on a trip to Diggityland, a [[theme park]] up in central [[Florida]] that was their favorite place as kids. Elias is going there to get an award for his work as a special-ed teacher, a decidedly ''grown-up'' occupation, while Alby needs a ride up the coast to sell his precious action figures to a collectibles broker – a move he thinks will reinstate him in the good graces of his family and signal his transition into adulthood.  Along the way the two friends meet a series of similarly damaged romantics: a [[hitchhiking]] disgruntled former employee of Diggityland who has a "little matter to settle with the management"; Trina, a horny bartender who attends "Clownin' School" in hopes of earning her "Clownin' Degree" and joining the Circus; and a delusional fading beauty who lives in an [[Airstream]] trailer and obsesses over her past glory as the most beautiful and popular [[Weeki Wachee, Florida#Weeki Wachee Springs tourist attraction|Weeki Wachee]] [[mermaid]]. Each pokes a new hole in Alby’s fantasy bubble of being a kid forever.  Ultimately it’s one of Elias’s students, a [[developmentally disabled]] boy named Rollie, a boy literally denied by fate the chance to ever become an adult, who teaches Alby the value of seeing beyond himself and taking responsibility for his actions.

Gamera the Brave
 After [[Gamera]] self-destructs to destroy three [[Gyaos]] in 1973; the tale picks up thirty-three years later in 2006, when the son of one of the survivors of that incident finds an unusual egg, from which a baby turtle hatches. The boy, Toru, raises the turtle, quickly realizing it as being remarkable in that it hovers and breathes fire. The turtle quickly outgrows the house, is relocated by Toru and his friends to maintain secrecy and then disappears.  Concurrently, many shipping disasters occur in the area, the cause of which is the [[kaiju]] Zedus (ジーダス), which soon thereafter rampages through the city. It corners Toru and his friends, but the boy's former pet, now significantly larger, intercedes. The young Gamera is wounded in the fight and captured by government officials, who hook the creature up to a machine which infuses it with liquid derived from mysterious red stones found in the vicinity of the egg and which scientists theorize give the Gameras their power.  Zedus attacks again and the new Gamera, now larger, goes out to battle him. The human characters determine that the still-immature Gamera must consume the red stone which Toru had found with the egg in order to gain its full power. The egg is located and, with some difficulty, delivered to Toru, who throws it into Gamera's mouth during the battle. Gamera's power of jet-propelled flight manifests itself and it defeats Zedus by breathing a fireball at it. The kaiju escapes further government investigation with Toru's assistance and flies off as the boy wishes him farewell.

Gangster (2006 film)
  Simran ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) drowns her misery in booze. Her one friend in [[Seoul]] is Aakash ([[Emraan Hashmi]]), a singer in an Indian restaurant.  Originally a bar dancer in [[Mumbai]], [[India]], Simran is the girlfriend of a notorious gangster, Daya ([[Shiney Ahuja]]). Five years ago, Daya's boss Khan ([[Gulshan Grover]]) ordered him to give Simran up. When Khan threatened Simran, Daya turned on him and Khan cut Daya loose from his gang.  She and Daya were forced to flee to Seoul. They took a small boy named Bittu with them. After an encounter with the Mumbai police, Bittu was killed, causing a strain in the couple's relationship and pushing Simran toward alcoholism. Leaving Simran alone in Seoul, Daya went to work in Mauritius and then Dubai.  Aakash tells Simran that he cares for her despite her past, and their relationship gradually develops from friendship to love. Daya, who is still in Dubai, suddenly comes to Seoul. When he learns of Simran's affair with Aakash, he attacks and severely beats him in a fit of rage and jealousy. Daya then professes his love for her and promises to reform and fulfill her dreams of a normal life; he also tells her that if she truly loves Aakash he will not hold her back. Before Simran can respond, the police arrive in pursuit of Daya and Simran. The two flee.  Daya gives up murdering innocents and begins working odd jobs, admitting to Simran that he has found peace in doing honest work. He says that he would like to return to his village in India with her, so that they might live there peacefully. To do so he would have to perform one last crime: fake passports for him and Simran.  Simran, who is longing for Aakash, soon discovers that she is pregnant with his child. When she tells Aakash, he meets her and tells her he would like to marry her, but they will never find peace as long as Daya is at large. He says that for the sake of their unborn child, Daya must be turned in to the police and only Simran can do this. Simran, who is still emotionally attached to Daya, refuses.  Meanwhile, Daya, who has gone to forge passports for himself and Simran, is intercepted by Khan, who reminds Daya of what had occurred between them years before and says that he intends to make an example of Daya for abandoning the gang. Khan and his men severely beat and wound Daya, who is eventually able to fight back and kills Khan. He then calls Simran, warning her that the police are after them and asking her to meet him outside a Seoul train station that night.  Simran arrives at the appointed time to find Daya badly injured from his fight with Khan. He manages to crawl to Simran and takes out a box of [[sindoor]] for her. But just as he reaches and embraces her, they are surrounded by police cars. Daya realises that Simran informed the police; heartbroken and screaming, he is hauled away. Simran remains at the station until morning and then goes to meet Aakash, whom she finds is not at home. She is soon informed that he is at the Indian embassy.  When she reaches the embassy, she enters a room full of reporters and sees a large screen showing a video of her telling Aakash about her relationship with Daya. She is thunderstruck when she sees that the one addressing the media is none other than Aakash, who is actually an undercover Indian detective hired to capture Daya. Realizing that Aakash befriended and wooed her solely to discover Daya's whereabouts, she explodes in fury in front of the media; Aakash holds her back and slaps her across the face. He tells her that he never cared for her and that his involvement with her was only a part of his duty to end organised crime and bring justice to his country. Enraged, Simran tries to attack him, but she is stopped by security. While she is being hauled away, she yells that to spread justice Aakash and his colleagues have done her an injustice and that Daya, who has never betrayed anyone, is not the gangster but Aakash and his men are. She reminds Aakash that he has betrayed the woman who is carrying his child and that he will regret his actions.  Daya, who has been arrested and taken to jail, sends Simran a letter saying that he does not blame her for what she did and that she is the one who has been betrayed; he admits that he has done many cruel and bad things but that, thanks to her, he now knows what it is like to live an honest life. He encloses her fake passport and, stating his love for her, writes that he would feel better knowing that she is living safely in India. After reading Daya's letter, Simran is left pained and guilty.  Months later, Daya admits and pleads guilty to his crimes. He is tried and sentenced to death. Simran goes to meet him in prison and asks him to forgive her; they share an emotional goodbye before Daya is taken away by guards. She later goes to Aakash's residence and, forcefully entering his house with a gun, shoots and fatally injures him. Before he lapses into unconsciousness, Aakash shoots her in the shoulder and they are found and taken to a hospital.  Aakash dies in the hospital while Simran is transferred to the I.C.U. At dawn she escapes to the roof, where she commits suicide by jumping off the roof. At the same time, Daya is hanged. Simran is shown falling through the air. Before she reaches the ground we see her standing in a meadow and gazing at Daya, who is holding Bittu. Smiling, they hold out their arms to her; she happily runs toward them, and they embrace in heaven.

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society
 In 2034, two years after the events of ''[[Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG|2nd GIG]]'', [[Public Security Section 9]] is investigating a string of mysterious suicides by refugees from the [[Siak Republic]]. Chief Aramaki conducts a raid to arrest the refugee dictator only to find him already dead. In retaliation, a Siak operative plans a terrorist attack with a micromachine virus. [[Batou]] is sent to intercept the Siak operative and encounters Kusanagi, who is conducting her own investigation. Before they can apprehend the operative, he dies while attacking them. Kusanagi takes a case of virus ampules and warns Batou to stay away from the Solid State Society before leaving.  Section 9 operatives develop a theory that a hacker known as the Puppeteer or 傀儡廻 (''Kugutsumawashi'', literally 'Puppet Spinner', contrasted with the original film Puppet Master who was 人形使い ''Ningyō-zukai'', literally 'Doll Handler') is responsible for Siak agents' forced suicides and Togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus. All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when they are part of a larger body of 20,000 children. Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one and the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.  Togusa tracks down one of the missing children, now assigned to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State. Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.  Kusanagi temporarily rejoins Section 9 and confirms that Ito Munei, an influential politician, was behind the assassination of General Ka Rum. She also confirms that Munei and other politicians use it as a front for a brainwashing facility to create an elite group of pure-blooded Japanese to take control of the country in the next generation and lead it into Munei's vision of a new [[Golden Age]]. The Solid State decided to eliminate Munei for interfering in its plans, but Munei was ignorant of the origin of the abduction infrastructure.  A designer named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, claiming he developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|egos]] until a [[collective consciousness]] emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him to move into the society beyond as the [[vanishing mediator]]. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a prosthetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal. Kusanagi implies that she will permanently rejoin Section 9 after years of wandering the net on her own.  
The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006 film)
  At Kuranose High School in [[Tokyo]], Japan, Makoto Konno discovers a message written on a [[blackboard]] and inadvertently falls upon a walnut-shaped object. On her way home, Makoto is ejected into a [[railroad crossing]] when the brakes on her bicycle fail and is hit by an oncoming train, but finds herself transported back to the point in time when she was riding her bicycle right before the accident. After entering the [[Tokyo National Museum]] to meet with Kazuko Yoshiyama, she explains to Makoto that she has the power to "time-leap", to literally leap through time. At first, Makoto uses her powers to avoid being late, getting perfect grades, and even relive a single [[karaoke]] session for several hours, but soon discovers that her actions can adversely affect others.  Consequently, Makoto uses most of her leaps frivolously, to prevent undesirable situations from happening, including an awkward love confession from her best friend Chiaki Mamiya. Makoto realizes that she has a numbered [[tattoo]] on her arm indicating the limited number of times she can time leap. Using her remaining time leaps, Makoto attempts to make things right for everyone. When Chiaki calls Makoto to ask if she has been time-leaping, she uses her final time leap to prevent Chiaki's call. In the meantime, Makoto's friend Kōsuke Tsuda and his new girlfriend, Kaho Fujitani, borrow her faulty bike. Makoto attempts to stop them, but because she had just used her final leap, she is unable to rescue them from the train.  A moment later, Chiaki freezes time, telling Makoto that he is from the future. He explains that the walnut-shaped object is a time-traveling device, and he used it to leap through time hoping to see a painting that is being restored by Kazuko, as it has been destroyed in the future. While walking with Makoto in the frozen city, Chiaki also explains that he stayed longer in her time frame than he originally planned. Consequently, he has used his final leap to ensure Kōsuke's existence and has stopped time only to explain to Makoto what the results will be. Having revealed his origins and the nature of the item that allowed Makoto to leap through time, and now unable to return to his own time period, Chiaki must leave. Makoto then realizes that she loves him.  True to his words, Chiaki disappears once time resumes. Initially distraught by Chiaki's disappearance, Makoto discovers that Chiaki's time-leap had inadvertently restored her final time-leap: Chiaki had leaped back to the time before Makoto used it. Makoto uses it to safely leap back to the moment right after she gained her powers, at which point Chiaki still has one remaining time-leap, and recovers the used up time-travel device. Makoto explains her knowledge of everything and shows the device to Chiaki. Makoto vows to ensure the painting's existence so Chiaki can see it in his era. Before Chiaki departs, he tells Makoto that he will be waiting for her in the future. When Kōsuke asks her where Chiaki went, she says that he went to study abroad, and that she made a decision about her own future.

His position and that of the group is deteriorating, and it is in some desperation that they turn to [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]-picking at [[Morecambe Bay]].  The film begins and ends with scenes recreating the [[2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster]], in which 23 illegal workers lost their lives whilst cockle-picking.  
Ghost Train (2006 film)
 A young boy, Takeshi, is told by a mysterious woman that he will die after picking up a ticket inside a red bag. While boarding the subway train home, he is pulled outside of the train, which briefly stops when the conductor is distracted by a figure outside. The next day, Takeshi's classmate, Noriko Kimura, finds the ticket and shows it to her sister, Nana, experiencing a vision of a baby and her mother in the process. Noriko spots Takeshi while waiting for the train and tries to follow him, but she ends up missing as well.  Nana decides to take action and contacts the train conductor, Shunichi Kuga. From the name written on the ticket, Yaeko Aonuma, she learns that the ticket has been returned to the lost-and-found multiple times and the people who did so have all died. The victims all have two distinguishing features: black marks covering their face and black eyes. Nana visits Takeshi's apartment, but flees when she sees that Takeshi has returned, but is naked, pale, has dark marks on his face and dark eyes, with his mother repeatedly babbling that he is no longer Takeshi.  Nana's classmate, Kanae Fujita, receives a bracelet from her boyfriend that turns out to be a useless trinket. When she confronts her boyfriend at the subway station that night, he is possessed and chokes her. Kanae kicks him to the railway right when the spirit leaves him and a train appears. Before he dies, he tells her to "beware of Yaeko". When Kanae visits the station again, Yaeko's spirit chases her until she bumps into Nana. Deciding to tackle the mystery together, the two agree to meet at the station the next day, but Nana unexpectedly has to attend her sick mother at the hospital. Alone at the station, Kanae is almost hit by a train until a hand saves her at the last second.   Nana demands more information about Yaeko from Kuga, who reveals that Yaeko is a pregnant woman who gave birth to her baby right after she was hit by a train. She died, but the status of the baby is unknown. Kanae wakes up to the woman who had rescued her. The woman tells her that she wants revenge against Yaeko, as her son suffered the same fate as Takeshi's. The woman agrees to drive Kanae to the station, but along the way, the car is hijacked by Yaeko and stops right in the middle of a railway. The woman manages to escape, but Kanae is not so lucky. She asks the woman to save Nana before a train hits the car.  At the station, the woman informs Nana about Kanae's fate. With Kuga's help, the trio head to a deeper part of the subway. Nana receives another vision, learning that there was already a spirit who resided in the subway and that Yaeko was just another victim. However, her sorrowful spirit, furious at not knowing her baby's fate, overcomes the original spirit, and she becomes the sole haunter of the subway. Unraveling a passageway behind the tunnel walls, Nana and the woman discover the spirit's ancient statues and Noriko sleeping atop a mountain of dead bodies. When Yaeko appears, the woman is enraged and tackles her, ending up stabbed by a stalagmite. As she lays dying, Nana learns from the woman's scars that she is Yaeko's long-lost baby. Seeing the bodies reanimated, Nana and Noriko race back to Kuga's train. Nana almost falls to an endless chasm if not for her sister, Kuga, and Kanae's spirit pulling her back. Upon reaching the train, Kuga manages to steer the train back to the station.  The next day, Nana and Noriko visit their mother, who has recovered and is ready to come back home. Nana watches the TV and learns that Kuga has ordered an explosion on the subway to seal it forever. She heads outside to sit on a bench and meets Kanae's spirit. The two smile at each other before Kanae disappears.

Glory Road (film)
  Newly appointed men's basketball coach Don Haskins gets a new job at Texas Western College in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. Lacking necessary financial resources, he makes an effort to recruit the best players regardless of race to form a team that can compete for a national championship. Some of the young men he brings in possess skill, but are raw in talent when it comes to organized teamwork focusing on defense and ball distribution. In the end, his Texas Western Miners team comprises seven black and five white athletes; a balance that raises eyebrows among university personnel. Haskins puts his players through a rigorous training program, threatening to cut anyone who doesn't work as hard as he demands, while trying to integrate his players into a single team with a common goal.  Following initial victories against mediocre local teams, Haskins quickly discovers that he has to give his black players more free room on the court. Yet, the more victories his team achieves with its flamboyant style, up until this point rarely seen in college basketball, the more racial hatred mounts on his squad. This culminates in threats to his own family, the beating of a player while on the road and ultimately the vandalism of his team's motel rooms by racists while they are at an away game. Increasingly frightened, the team loses its last game of the regular season after the black players stop playing with passion. Thus, the Texas Western Miners finish the 1965-66 regular season with a 23–1 record, entering the 1966 NCAA tournament ranked third in the nation.  Going on to the [[1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game|NCAA final]], played at [[College Park, Maryland]], they take on the top-ranked [[1965–66 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|University of Kentucky]] under legendary coach, [[Adolph Rupp]]. Rupp, with a well-organized and more experienced all-white [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Wildcats]] squad, firmly believes that his opponent stands no chance. On the eve of the decisive game, Haskins decides to experiment with a bold strategy, informing his team that he intends to start an all-black lineup in the game, and also only using the two other black players in the rotation.  In the midst of seemingly insurmountable odds, Texas Western encounters mounting problems with [[forward (basketball)|forward]] and team captain Harry Flournoy leaving the game with an injury, and their center David Lattin in foul trouble. In a close game, the Miners narrowly lead at halftime, but finally manage to beat Kentucky 72–65 with some impressive [[steal (basketball)|steals]], rebounding and passing techniques in the second half. The film ends with the players exiting the plane that brought them back to El Paso to the greeting of a raucous crowd.  
Glass House: The Good Mother
 The film tells the story of Abby ([[Jordan Hinson]]) and Ethan Snow ([[Bobby Coleman]]), who lose their parents in a tragic accident and are adopted by Eve ([[Angie Harmon]]) and Raymond Goode ([[Joel Gretsch]]), two seemingly-ideal parents who have recently lost a child of their own, David.  At first things seem good, but the first oddity manifests when Ethan gets his own room with a bathroom close to the master bedroom but Abby is given a bedroom far away, up in the tower of the house. From here, Abby notices a lot of strange things; there's a bed in the basement with David's name into it and many places they can't go into, like David's old bedroom. They are not allowed to make phone calls either. Eve and Abby get into a fight at the dinner table, and Eve slaps Abby. Later on, Eve asks Abby to wash dishes. As Abby is washing them, she cuts her arm on broken glass that Eve purposely left in the sink for her. Abby did not see the glasses, since the sink was filled to the top with water, and covered in soap. Abby demands to be taken to the hospital, but Eve refuses and brings out a box of medical supplies. Raymond reveals that Eve was a nurse, and Eve makes the process as painful as she possibly can- including a shot, and stitches without any anesthetic or numbing medications. Later, Abby is seen sleeping, and Eve injects her with an unknown substance. Abby awakes, too late to do anything, except ask what the liquid is, Eve responds with "This is for pain," Abby replies, that she's not in pain, but Eve states "You will be." Abby falls asleep, quickly, suggesting that it was a sedative of some sort. Later on, Abby wakes up, and Eve tells her that she's been in bed for three days.  Ethan soon becomes almost deathly ill, and Abby soon discovers that Eve is poisoning him, and that this has occurred to all the previous foster children who died in her care. Abby makes an attempt to escape, but Eve catches her and locks her in the attic. Their parents' friend, Ben Koch ([[Jason London]]), comes over to the house to take the kids to Six Flags, but Raymond tells him that Eve took them to an art gallery. After a walk through the house Ben finds it very odd. Abby escapes through a window, then Eve comes after her. During this time the phone rings and Eve and Abby both race to answer it. Eve gets to it first, but the person on the other line hangs up. It is revealed that it was Ben, seeing if they really were gone.  After Abby tries to get away in the car again, she is stopped by Raymond, who Abby knocks out with a wrench. Ben arrives and enters the house, but is ambushed by Eve and drugged. Eve continues to chase Abby before luring her out of hiding via feigning talking to Ethan and catching her. She holds Abby over the railing, but Abby fights back and kicks Eve down the stairs. Eve takes a blow to the head at the bottom, appearing to be dead. Abby races to find Ethan, who she finds in a bathtub almost drowned to death. Abby pulls him out and Eve is standing behind her with a cleaver. She knocks Abby to the ground as Ben enters, and raises the cleaver. A shot is fired and Eve is killed, but it was not Ben who fired. It is revealed that Raymond fired the gun that killed his wife, having snapped out of his blind obedience caused by love. Raymond is arrested, and Abby and Ethan are taken to the hospital. The two presumably end up with Ben.  
The Go Master
 The Go Master shines a light on the life and times of Wu Qingyuan, pronounced Go Seigen in Japanese. Wu is considered the greatest Go player of the 20th century, his talents bringing him from his native China to a professional career in Japan when he was only a teenager. Based on Wu's autobiography, this elegantly shot and remarkably restrained biopic follows the life of a singular figure, fascinating not only for his genius and achievements in the game of Go, but also for his unique experiences as a Chinese man in Japan during an immensely turbulent period in history. Acclaimed Taiwanese actor Chang Chen (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon<ref></ref>) portrays the titular role in a subtle, poignant performance that is as penetrating as it is opaque, underlying the brooding lyricism of the film. The Go Master co-stars Sylvia Chang, Matsuzaka Keiko, Emoto Akira, and Ito Ayumi, and Wu Qingyuan himself appears briefly in the film's prologue. Also of note is the film's costume design, which is by renowned designer Wada Emi (Ran, Hero, House of Flying Daggers).  With the breakout of the Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s, Wu Qingyuan (Chang Chen) and his family are thrown into an uncomfortable and dangerous position as Chinese nationals residing in Japan. While Wu's family returns to China, he chooses to stay behind in his adopted country to continue to pursue the game of Go. In the quiet recluse of his school, there are no politics, only the singular dedication to his art and the love for his wife Kazuko (Ayumi Ito). However, the chaos of the times eventually forces him out of his enclave, throwing his life and mind into conflict.<ref>[http://www.asiatorrents.com/details.php?id=7869d9bd5fc04a99f929a416b943497a2790077e Review courtesy of Asia Torrents]</ref>  Wu's career ends abruptly when he is struck by a motorcycle in a collision which does not appear to be an accident. This real-life incident may have been a conspiracy against him by opponents in the world of Go, where he remained an unshakable winner. He is later hospitalized and can no longer play Go, due to brain trauma. Despite this, the film ends nostalgically in the golden room of Go.

Jumping to the late 1990s, when ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' brings humor and TV stars into the mix.

The Good Shepherd (film)
  A photograph and an audio recording on [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape]] are dropped off anonymously at the home of Edward Wilson, a senior CIA officer, after the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of Cuba fails due to an undisclosed leak.  In 1939 Edward is at [[Yale University]] and invited to join [[Skull and Bones]], a secret society. He is compelled to disclose a secret as part of his initiation and reveals that as a young boy in 1925 he discovered the suicide note left by his father, Thomas, although he says he never read it. After the ceremony, a fraternity brother, Richard Hayes, tells him that Edward's father was to be chosen as [[Secretary of the Navy]], until his loyalties were questioned. Afterwards Edward is recruited by an [[FBI]] agent, Sam Murach, who claims that Edward's poetry professor, Dr. Fredericks, is a [[Nazi]] spy, asking Edward to expose his professor's background. Edward's actions result in Dr. Fredericks' forced resignation from the university.  Edward begins a relationship with a deaf student named Laura, but while on [[Deer Island (Thousand Islands)|Deer Island]], Edward meets his friend John Russel's family and is later aggressively seduced by his sister Margaret 'Clover' Russell. General Bill Sullivan asks Edward to join the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], offering him a post in London. Later while Edward and Laura are at the beach, Margaret's brother privately reveals that she is pregnant, so Edward marries her. At the wedding reception Edward accepts the London OSS office position, while his new wife remains in the United States. In London he meets Dr. Fredericks again, who is actually with British intelligence.  An intelligence officer in the British [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]], Arch Cummings, tells Edward that Fredericks' indiscriminate homosexual relationships pose a security risk. Edward is asked to deal with his mentor, who refuses to protect himself by returning to teaching. Shortly afterwards, he is brutally murdered and his corpse dumped into the [[River Thames|Thames]] while Edward watches.  In post-war Berlin, where both [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] are recruiting German scientists, Edward encounters his Soviet counterpart, code named "Ulysses", for the first time. After learning from his son, Edward Jr., during a phone call home that his wife is having an affair, Edward has a one-night stand with interpreter Hanna Schiller; the same night, he realizes she is a Soviet agent and she is killed. Edward returns home to his wife and son in America. His wife confesses her adultery, and Edward confesses his. General Sullivan approaches Edward again to help form a new foreign intelligence organization, the CIA, where he would work with his former colleague, Richard Hayes, under Phillip Allen and Edward accepts.  Edward's first assignment deals with coffee in Central America where the Russians are trying to gain influence. Edward spots Ulysses in the background of footage of the country's leader. Edward arranges for airplanes to fly over and release locusts during a public event where the Russians and Ulysses are present in order to intimidate the Central American leader. An American agent's severed finger is sent to Edward in a coffee can. At a Christmas party, General Sullivan tells Edward that Phillip Allen was going to be on the Mayan Coffee Company's board of directors, prompting Edward to ask Sam Murach to look into Phillip's finances.  A Russian man requests [[Right of asylum|asylum]] and claims to be high-ranking [[KGB]] agent Valentin Mironov. While attending the theater with Mironov and Cummings, Edward encounters his former sweetheart, Laura. They begin seeing each other again. Sometime later, Margaret receives photos of Laura and Edward getting into a taxi together and kissing. After she confronts him, Edward ends the relationship with Laura. Another Russian defector appears, claiming that he is the ''real'' Valentin Mironov, the other man being an impostor called Yuri Modin, a KGB operative working for Ulysses. Thinking he is lying, agents torture him, and administer liquid [[LSD]] believing it to be a potential [[truth serum]]. The second defector does not break, instead telling them how the Soviets' power is just a myth, before hurling himself through a window and down several stories. The first man claiming to be Valentin Mironov, who has watched the entire ordeal together with Edward, offers to take LSD to prove his innocence, but Edward does not take him up on his offer. Edward visits his son, who has, like his father, joined the Skull and Bones society at Yale, and been approached by the CIA, which he joins despite his mother's misgivings, widening the rift between his parents. Edward Jr. overhears his father and Hayes discussing the imminent Bay of Pigs invasion. His father warns him to be silent. Margaret later leaves Edward and they divorce.  Returning to the recording at the beginning of the story, detailed analysis points to [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]], in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]. Having tracked down the room where the recording was made, Edward realizes that the source of the leak was his son speaking to his lover, an African woman, revealed to be a Soviet agent by Ulysses when he appears and plays Edward an unedited version of the recording in an attempt to turn him.  Edward confronts his son, who plans to marry the woman. Growing suspicious, Edward discovers evidence that Cummings and Mironov (really Yuri Modin) are [[double-agent|double agents]]. Meeting Ulysses in the [[National Air and Space Museum]], Edward finally refuses his offer, but argues that, having won in Cuba, there is nothing to be gained for the Soviets in hurting his son. On their wedding day, Edward Jr.'s fiancée is killed by being thrown out of the plane she was taking to the ceremony. When Edward Jr. asks if his father was responsible, he denies it.  Edward meets with Hayes at the new CIA headquarters still under construction. Allen is resigning under a cloud of financial improprieties, and the President has asked Hayes to be the new director. Hayes makes Edward head of counter-intelligence. At home, Edward retrieves and reads his father's suicide note. In the letter, his father confesses to having betrayed his country. Edward burns the note. The final scene shows Edward leaving his old office for the new position.  
Goya's Ghosts
  In 1792, [[Spain]] reels amid the turmoil and upheaval of the [[French Revolution]]. [[Francisco Goya]] ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]) is a renowned painter, who, among others, does portraits for the royal family as the Official Court Painter to the King and Queen.  The [[Spanish Inquisition]] is disturbed by part of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares ([[Javier Bardem]]), who has hired Goya to paint his [[portrait]], defends him, saying that his works are not evil, they just show evil. He recommends the Church step up the fight against [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] practices, and is put in charge of intensifying the Inquisition.   When posing in Goya's studio, Lorenzo asks Goya about a young model he uses, Inés ([[Natalie Portman]]), daughter of a rich merchant, Tomás Bilbatúa ([[Jose Luis Gomez|José Luis Gómez]]). One evening Inés is spotted by Inquisition spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork in a tavern. The Holy Office of the Inquisition summons Inés and arrests her on a charge of "judaizing" (spreading [[Jews|Jewish]] rituals), for refusing to eat pork. She is stripped naked and [[torture]]d by [[strappado]] ("put to The Question"), confesses, and is imprisoned. The Inquisition's archives had already revealed that one of her father's ancestors had converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1624 upon arrival in Spain from Amsterdam.  Bilbatúa begs Goya for help, who in turn asks Lorenzo to find out about Inés's situation.  Lorenzo visits Inés in prison telling her that he is going to help her and will pass a message to her family if she wishes. He offers to pray with Inés, but is clearly struggling with his desire to rape her as, still naked, she prays with him at his request. Later at a dinner in Bilbatúa's home, where he and Goya are guests, Lorenzo defends "The Question": he argues that if the accused is really innocent, God will give him or her the strength to deny guilt, so a person who confesses must therefore be guilty. Bilbatúa does not agree: he argues that people will confess to anything under torture, and Goya agrees. To prove this Bilbatúa draws up a statement which says that Lorenzo confesses to being a monkey, and, with the help of his sons, prevents Lorenzo from leaving unless he agrees to sign it. Goya pleads for Lorenzo without success, and is escorted away and pushed out of the home. Bilbatúa, his sons and servants torture Lorenzo with a makeshift [[strappado]], causing him to break down and sign. Bilbatúa promises to destroy the document after Inés is released. He gives Lorenzo a large amount of gold for the Church, hoping it will persuade the Holy Office to consider leniency.  Lorenzo pleads for Inés, but the Inquisitor General Father Gregorio, while accepting the money, refuses, since Inés has confessed. Lorenzo again visits Inés in prison and, offering to pray with her, instead rapes her. Bilbatúa brings the document to the king, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] ([[Randy Quaid]]) who is highly amused at seeing it, and promises to assist Inés. Lorenzo is now an embarrassment to the Spanish Church and flees when they come to arrest him. His portrait is confiscated and is set on fire in public, to burn him in effigy.  Fifteen years pass, and Goya is at the height of his creativity, but has grown deaf. The French army under [[Napoleon]] invades Spain, abolishes the Inquisition and sets its prisoners free. Lorenzo had fled to France, where he was introduced to the ideas of the [[French Revolution]] and became a fanatical adherent of them.  He is now Napoleon's chief special prosecutor against his former Spanish colleagues in the Inquisition. (This twist in Lorenzo's allegiance might have been inspired by the career of [[Juan Antonio Llorente]].) A French court presides over the [[show trial]], conviction and sentencing to death of the Inquisitor General.   Inés has been left to languish in the dungeons until now; she had given birth to a daughter in prison, who was taken away from her immediately after birth.  Upon visiting her old home and finding her family killed, Inés turns to Goya for help in finding her child. Lorenzo is the father, which is embarrassing for him, and he sends Inés, whose sanity has suffered in prison, to an [[insane asylum]]. Lorenzo questions the condemned Inquisitor General, who tells him that a child born in the prison would have been placed in an orphanage. Lorenzo locates it, and he learns from the nuns who run it that his daughter, named Alicia, had run away several years before.  In Garden Park, Goya finds a [[prostitute]] named Alicia (also played by [[Natalie Portman]]) who looks identical to Inés. He goes to Lorenzo asking for Inés in order to reunite her with her daughter. Lorenzo takes the initiative and secretly goes to see Alicia, offering to pay for her passage to America if she will leave Spain. She refuses, declaring him insane. In the meantime, Goya travels to the asylum where Inés has been kept. He pays the director a bribe to release her, and then tries to bring Inés to see Alicia in a tavern where prostitutes gather. Unfortunately, as Goya tries to persuade Alicia to see her mother, a group of soldiers, under orders from Lorenzo, burst into the tavern and forcibly arrest all the prostitutes. Goya discovers Lorenzo's intention to sell the women off to America where they will be treated as [[slaves]]. Inés, waiting outside to meet Alicia, wanders into the tavern and finds a baby left there when its mother was seized in the raid. In her delusion Inés thinks the baby is her own lost daughter; she is delighted and wanders off with the child.  The British invade Spain from Portugal, defeating the French troops with the help of the Spanish population. The wagons in which the prostitutes are being transported are abandoned by the French cavalry guarding them when the British attack, with Alicia catching the eye of a British officer. Lorenzo is arrested as he is fleeing. The Spanish reinstate the Inquisition, which now tries and sentences Lorenzo to death, the Inquisitor General condemning him in much the same words as Lorenzo used at his trial. They urge Lorenzo to repent, even at the site of his execution, to which he is led in the [[auto da fe]] wearing a [[sanbenito]] with painted flames indicating he is sentenced to die. On the scaffold, Lorenzo spots his daughter Alicia, on the arm of the British officer, scoffing at him. He also notices Goya sitting at a distance sketching the entire ordeal. Inés is also present in the crowd and calls to Lorenzo enthusiastically to show him the baby she believes is their daughter. Refusing to repent, despite pleas from his former colleagues the monks, Lorenzo is [[garrotted]]. The film ends with a cart taking Lorenzo's body away, escorted by Inés still carrying the child, with Goya following closely behind her calling for her. She glances back with a smile, but continues to accompany the body as she kisses its hand.  
A Good Year
 Young Max Skinner, whose parents have died in an accident, spends his childhood summer holidays learning to appreciate the finer things in life at his Uncle Henry's [[vineyard]] estate in [[Provence]] in southeastern [[France]]. Some 25 years later, Max is an unethical, successful, and hard-working [[London]]-based bond [[Bond trader|trader]] with a sense of humour.  Following his uncle's death, Max is the sole [[beneficiary]] of the French property. He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale. Shortly after arriving, by driving while fumbling with a cell phone, he unknowingly causes a local café owner, Fanny Chenal, to crash her bicycle. Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has caused real trouble for the owners of the trading company he works for, and the CEO orders him to return to London as soon as possible.  To assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool. He is unable to escape until Fanny, driving by and spotting his rental car, turns on the water supply in retaliation. This delay causes Max to miss his flight and, having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week.  On Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines. Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless.  They are surprised by the arrival of young [[Napa Valley]] [[oenophile]] Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter. Max realizes, but does not tell her how French law decrees, even though Christie is not his uncle's legitimate daughter, she still becomes the rightful heir to the Chateau and vineyards. As Max did earlier, Christie finds the house wine unpalatable but is impressed by Max's casual offering of the boutique Le Coin Perdu ("the lost corner") vintage, noting some intriguing characteristics. During dinner at the Duflot house, while slightly inebriated, Max exposes his concern that she might lay claim to the estate and brusquely interrogates her.  Max's assistant Gemma warns him of the ambitious antics of other employees. To ensure he is not usurped by Kenny, his second-in-command in [[London]], through whom Max continues to direct trades, Max intentionally gives the ambitious young trader bad advice, getting him fired.  Max becomes enamoured with Fanny, who is rumoured to have sworn off men. He successfully woos Fanny into his bed. She leaves him the next morning, expecting him to return to his life in London. A disillusioned Christie also decides to move on. Max finds his uncle's memoirs, which contain proof of Christie's heritage. He bids her farewell while handing her an unexplained note inside a book she was reading. While informing Duflot of the pending estate sale, Max learns that the mysterious expensive Le Coin Perdu was made by Henry and Duflot with "illegal vines" from the estate, bypassing [[wine classification]] and [[appellation]] laws.  The estate is sold and Max returns to London where Sir Nigel, the company chairman, offers him a choice: either a large discharge settlement, or the partnership in the trading firm. Max asks about Nigel's art in the conference room, which Fanny has a copy of in her restaurant. Upon Nigel's dismissive comment that the real one is kept in a vault and the $200,000 copy in the office is for show, Max reconsiders if he wants to still be like Nigel.  Max invalidates the estate's sale with the farewell letter he gave to Christie, which he forged, along with real photos confirming Christie as Henry's daughter with a valid claim to the entire estate. (As a child Max signed cheques for his uncle, and is able to replicate his handwriting.)  He puts his London residence up for sale and returns to Provence, entering into a relationship with Fanny. Christie also returns and she and Francis jointly run the vineyard while trying to reconcile their vastly different philosophies of wine production. This enables Max to focus his entire attention on Fanny.  
Golmaal: Fun Unlimited
 The story revolves around the lives of Gopal ([[Ajay Devgn]]), Lucky ([[Tusshar Kapoor]]),  Madhav ([[Arshad Warsi]]) and Laxman ([[Sharman Joshi]]).  Laxman is an intelligent student who is diverted from doing well in college by his mischievous band of friends Gopal, Madhav, and Lucky. Lucky is a mute in the movie. The three friends use Laxman's hostel room for their mischievous activities. Laxman is [[peer pressure]]d into running a series of scams to earn himself and his friends some money and is punished by being thrown out of college. The naughty foursome then finds refuge in the bungalow of a blind couple, Somnath ([[Paresh Rawal]]) and Mangala ([[Sushmita Mukherjee]]), who are waiting for their grandson, Sameer, to inherit his paternal grandparents' treasure chest hidden in the old couple's house. Gopal pretends to be Sameer returning from America, and enters the house, while the other three friends sneak in hidden.  A cat-and-mouse game unfolds as Laxman's body and Gopal's voice make up Sameer. Each time the blind Dadaji comes amidst them, hilarious situations arise. Enter Nirali ([[Rimi Sen]]), the saucy girl-next-door, and the group now have time, place and 'resources' to fall in love. Their individual efforts at winning the lady's heart fail. Apart from their amorous interests, there is a quest for the chest. There is also a gangster named Babli who wants to steal the chest from the couple's bungalow. All his attempts are unintentionally and unknowingly thwarted by the foursome.  After the foursome find a chest hidden behind an old painting in the house, despite Laxman pleading not to open the chest, Somnath reveals about Sameer's death to Gopal, Laxman, Madhav, and Lucky. The real Sameer, along with his parents, were killed in a car crash after his father and mother left with him for India to meet his grandparents, after Somnath's son learned that Somnath and Mangala were permanently blinded in a lethal accident. Somnath goes to America and lights the pyres of his son, daughter-in-law and grandson, the ashes of whom he later kept in an urn, as per the Hindu tradition which he kept in the chest. Mangala is shocked to hear the stories, breaks into tears and condemns her husband for lying to her all those years and not allowing her to cradle her grandson or light the pyres, and she also condemns the foursome for tricking her and hurting her feelings. Babli then arrives with his gang and later reveals that he hid the diamonds in the urn Somnath was carrying his grand returned to India and arrived at an airport. Panducharang, an assassin previously sent by Babli as an undercover servant later joins Gopal's team and fights the gangsters off, with the fight finally ending with Gopal being accidentally stabbed by Babli in his behind with a knife, falling unconscious soon after, but not before warning Madhav, Lucky and Laxman to not touch the knife, leaving the three friends in laughter. Babli also falls unconscious after seeing blood flowing from Gopal's behind.  After being admitted to a hospital, Gopal finally has the knife removed from his back, and Babli is arrested for his crimes. Laxman, Gopal, Madhav and Lucky are then rewarded with ten percent of the original value of the diamonds for arresting Babli. Nirali then chooses Lucky as her husband-to-be, saying that she found true love and loyalty in him and him alone, leaving the remaining three disappointed.  
The Good German
 Jacob "Jake" Geismer ([[George Clooney]]), an American [[war correspondent]] for ''[[The New Republic]]'', returns to [[Berlin]] during the [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam negotiations]] between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] after [[Victory in Europe Day|World War II was over in Europe]] (May 1945) but before [[Victory over Japan Day|hostilities ended in Asia]] (August 1945). Jacob witnesses his murdered driver, a [[Black market|black-market]]eering American soldier named Tully ([[Tobey Maguire]]), being fished from a river eddy, suspiciously adjacent to the Potsdam conference grounds. The corpse is discovered to be in possession of 50,000 [[German reichsmark]]s — which are later revealed to have been printed by the U.S occupying forces.  Geismer becomes entwined in both the mystery of his murdered driver and the clandestine search by both [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United States|American]] forces for the missing German Emil Brandt (the title character, played by [[Christian Oliver]]). He becomes more involved in both mysteries as his investigation intersects with his search for Lena Brandt ([[Cate Blanchett]]), a Jew — and Emil's wife — with whom Geismer had been in a relationship prior to the war. Lena has survived the [[Holocaust]] by doing "what she had to" to stay alive — early in the film this is assumed to be [[prostitution]], but Lena, in reality, holds a darker secret of complicity and guilt.  In the film, Emil Brandt is a former [[SS]] officer who had been the secretary of Franz Bettmann, Chief Production Engineer of the [[V-2 rocket]] at [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] [[Mittelbau-Dora]]/[[Mittelwerk]]. (Bettmann is only a minor character in the film; he appears to be based on the real [[Arthur Rudolph]].) The Soviets, the Americans, and the [[British people|British]] all try to get hold of Emil Brandt, for different reasons. The Americans have already detained Bettmann in a [[safehouse]] and intend to transport him to the U.S. as part of their [[Operation Paperclip|Operation Overcast/Paperclip]] to have him work on their own rocket program (cf. [[Wernher von Braun]]). In the film, they are fully aware of Bettmann's role at Camp Dora and know about the [[slave labor]] used in the V-2 program, but want to cover up his involvement (because they could not lawfully employ a known [[war criminal]]), which includes eliminating Emil Brandt, whose testimony or written notes would prevent their whitewashing of Bettmann.  Geismer, in his attempts to get his former lover, Lena, out of Berlin, gets more and more involved in the search for Emil Brandt. At one point, Lena gives Emil's notes on Camp Dora to Geismer. When Lena and Geismer try to hand Emil Brandt over to the American prosecutor charged with handling war crimes cases, they are intercepted by the American authorities who want to protect Bettmann, and Brandt is murdered. But Geismer still has Brandt's notebooks, which he now trades in to the war crimes investigators of the U.S. Army (who have turned out to be in league with the other American authorities - the ones who want to keep that evidence confidential to whitewash Bettmann) in exchange for a ''[[Persilschein]]'' (a [[denazification]] document) and a [[visa (document)|visa]] for Lena, such that she can leave Germany.  Through a minor character of a Jewish owner of a [[pawn shop]] who survived the Holocaust with his legs amputated, the film refers to the [[Nazi human experimentation]], in particular to bone transplantation experiments as they were done at the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]].  
Gopi – Goda Meeda Pilli
 Gopi is a story followed avidly by Lord Vishnu ([[Suresh (actor)|Suresh]]) and Goddess Lakshmi ([[Rambha (actress)|Rambha]]), who intervenes every once in a while with his observations. If it's true that the whole universe resides in Vishnu, then the makers of this one already have the largest possible audience, without needing to rely on the material world. Good for them, since in this illusory world of ours that look tough.  Gopi ([[Allari Naresh]]) is a bachelor who rejects marriage proposals for a living. After about 250 women fail to live up to his standards, his parents ([[Tanikella Bharani]] & [[Hema (actress)|Hema]]) are fed-up with his character. Gopi sees Lakshmi ([[Gowri Munjal]]) when his friend Balaraju ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]) is fixing a bride (''Pelli Choopulu'') and falls in love with her. He plots to get Balaraju to reject her and asks for her hand in marriage himself. Just as the marriage is about to happen, he goes to Bangalore for a job interview. On the way, he meets Priya ([[Aarti Chhabria]]), a dreaded terrorist who's real name is Monica Judi. He falls for her beauty without realizing her true identity. Priya tries to use him as human bomb while he dreams of dumping Lakshmi and marrying Priya. Gopi informs his parents about the intention of canceling the marriage with Lakshmi.  Balavinder Cheda ([[Jagapati Babu]]) is the CBI officer in charge of the operation of capturing the terrorist and her accomplice. He intervenes at the right time to rescue Gopi from the clutches of Monica. Freed from her, Gopi goes to the marriage venue. But instead of him, it is Vamsi ([[Vadde Naveen]]) Gopi's cousin arranged by Gopi's parents, who are getting ready to marry Lakshmi. Gopi realizes his mistake and apologizes. All promptly forgive him and he marries Lakshmi.<ref name="Story"></ref>  
Grandma's Boy (2006 film)
 Alex ([[Allen Covert]]) is a single, 35-year-old video game tester who lives with his friend Josh ([[Jonathan Loughran]]). When Josh wastes their rent money on [[Filipino people|Filipino]] hookers, their landlord ([[Rob Schneider]]) kicks them out, and Alex has to find a new place to live. Alex tries to stay with his marijuana dealer, Dante ([[Peter Dante]]), but cannot do so because Dante is adopting a wild lion to live in the house. Alex spends one night with his co-worker Jeff ([[Nick Swardson]]), but Jeff still lives with his parents. After an embarrassing "encounter" with Jeff's mom, in which he is caught masturbating in the bathroom and subsequently ejaculates on her, Alex is forced to move in with his grandmother Lilly ([[Doris Roberts]]) and her two eccentric friends, Bea ([[Shirley Knight]]) and Grace ([[Shirley Jones]]).  Alex is given many chores and fix-up projects to do around the house, but has a hard time completing them because his grandmother and her friends are a constant distraction. He also finds it hard to get any work done. Alex discovers that the three women have a fascination with the television program ''[[Antiques Roadshow (U.S. TV series)|Antiques Roadshow]]'' and later is able to get some work finished by giving them tickets to attend a taping of the show. At work, Alex meets the attractive Samantha ([[Linda Cardellini]]), who has been sent by the company's corporate office to oversee the production of a new video game. Alex and Samantha hit it off, but the only person in the way of their relationship is the creator of the game they are all working on, J.P. ([[Joel David Moore|Joel Moore]]), a self-proclaimed "genius" who is obsessed with video games and has a crush on Samantha. Samantha is not interested in J.P. and declines his constant advances.  Meanwhile, in an attempt to sound cool to his younger co-workers ([[Jonah Hill]] and [[Kelvin Yu]]), Alex says that he is living "with three hot babes". Alex's friends believe the lie and actually think the reason he is so tired every day at work is because he is living with three women who constantly "wear him out" in the bedroom. The real cause of his fatigue is because he stays up late at night working on his own video game, called ''Demonik'', which he has been developing in secret for some time. Lilly asks about the game one night and he teaches her to play it. To his surprise, she becomes quite good at it and beats many levels. After Alex and his co-workers finish successfully testing ''Eternal Death Slayer 3'', their boss Mr. Cheezle ([[Kevin Nealon]]) tells Samantha to take the boys out to eat at a vegan restaurant, but they instead make fun of the restaurant and their waiter ([[David Spade]]) when they arrive, and then leave to a burger shop. When Jeff has to use the bathroom and refuses to use the one in the restaurant, Alex is forced to take everyone to his house.  Alex comes home to find that Lilly, Grace, and Bea drank all of his pot, which they thought was tea. When Samantha admits to smoking weed too, Alex calls up Dante and throws a wild party. During the party, the group prank-calls J.P. and leaves him a voicemail that makes fun of him about wanting to be a robot. J.P. is upset by the message and shows up at Lilly's house a couple nights later in tears. Feeling bad for him, Alex agrees to let him borrow his only copy of ''Demonik'' and test it out for a few days. In retaliation for Alex making his life miserable, and having become accustomed to stealing others' ideas, J.P. steals the game and tries to pass it off as his own at work. Mr. Cheezle does not believe Alex when he insists the game is his, since it was his only copy, so his friends call Lilly to the office. Because she has mastered the game already, she plays J.P. and wins to prove it belongs to Alex. In the end, Alex is vindicated and creates a successful game. Alex and Samantha start dating.  
Grbavica (film)
 Single mother Esma lives with her 12-year-old daughter Sara in post-war Sarajevo. Sara wants to go on a school field trip and her mother starts working as a waitress at a nightclub to earn the money for the trip.   Sara befriends Samir, who, like Sara, has no father. Both of their fathers allegedly died as war heroes. Samir is surprised to find out that Sara does not know the circumstances of her father's death. Samir's own father was massacred by [[Chetnik]]s near Žuč when he refused to leave the trench he was defending. Whenever Sara and her mother discuss this delicate topic, however, Esma's responses are always vague.  The situation grows more complicated when students who can provide a certificate proving that they are the offspring of war heroes can go on the field trip free. Esma explains to Sara that her father's corpse was never found and that she has no certificate. She promises to try to obtain the document. Secretly, however, Esma attempts to borrow the money Sara needs from her friend Sabina, her aunt and her boss.   Sara is haunted by a nagging feeling that something is not right. Shocked and bewildered when she discovers she is not mentioned as the child of a war hero on the list of pupils going on the school trip, Sara lashes out at Samir. At home, however, she confronts her mother and demands to know the truth. Esma breaks down and finally admits painfully that she was raped at a prisoner camp and forced to have the child, Sara, that resulted from this violation. All at once, Sara realizes she is the child of a Chetnik. And yet, this discovery also brings her closer to her mother and helps overcome her trauma. In the end, Sara leaves for the field trip, not waving to her mother until the last moment. On the bus, the students sing a popular song about Sarajevo ("Land of My Dreams"), and Sara joins in.

Their lifestyle is generally co-dependent, involving them living together, going to dance classes together, etc. Gray and Sam's relationship has never been thought of as strange, but once a dinner party guest mistakes the siblings as a couple, Gray and Sam decide to venture outside of one another. While discussing with each other what they can do about their single lifestyles, and how they can "hook each other up" with a significant other, their conversation continues to the park, where Gray spots a possible girlfriend for Sam, Charlie Kelsey ([[Bridget Moynahan]]). Gray introduces herself, then Charlie to Sam, and they instantly bond, agreeing to see each other again.  To Gray's surprise, Charlie and Sam become engaged the morning after their meeting. Charlie and Sam are so madly in love with one another, they plan to go to Las Vegas the following morning and elope there, and invite Gray along. Gray is a little hesitant, but agrees when Charlie says they can have a "mini bachelorette party". Gray agrees and the three make their way to Vegas. While in Vegas, Gray takes Charlie out for a [[hen night]], and after many drinks, the two share a drunken but passionate kiss.

The Gravedancers
 An unidentified young woman, alone in a room, is attacked by an invisible assailant, who hangs her in the stairway of her house. As she dies, she drops an ornate black envelope.  A year later, former college friends Sid ([[Marcus Thomas (actor)|Marcus Thomas]]), Kira ([[Josie Maran]]), and Harris ([[Dominic Purcell]]) go out drinking after a funeral. They break into the Crescent View Cemetery to say their final goodbyes to the departed. Continuing their revelries, they get quite drunk. Sid finds a black envelope tucked behind a garland of flowers at the grave. It contains a poem urging those present to be joyful and to dance upon the graves. In their drunken state, the three regard this as a celebration of life, and they dance.  Afterwards, mysterious things happen. Harris and his wife Allison ([[Clare Kramer]]) are frightened by unexpected visions and odd sounds. Then Kira is attacked by a demonic force. She is severely bitten and sexually assaulted, and her house is ransacked. Sid is plagued by unexpected fires. They enlist a pair of paranormal investigators, Vincent Cochet ([[Tchéky Karyo]]) and Frances Culpepper ([[Megahn Perry]]), who determine that the three friends inadvertently invoked a powerful curse by dancing on the graves. They are now being haunted by three wayward spirits—a passionate axe murderer, a child pyromaniac, and a serial killer and rapist—who will kill them at the next full moon.  As the full moon approaches, they return to the cemetery to disinter the remains of their tormenters, hoping to bury them anew and put the curse to rest. Not all of the critical parts make it back into the ground, however, and on the final night the three friends experience renewed attacks, more powerful and furious than any previously. They are trapped together with the investigators by the malevolent spirits. Sid is incinerated by his firebug ghost, and Kira is murdered and her body is possessed by the axe murderer who is pursuing Harris.  Under duress, Culpepper admits that she foiled the burial plan by hiding the skulls of the corpses, the better to gather hard evidence of ghostly activity. Culpepper is then killed with an axe to the chest. Harris takes the axe murderer's skull and tries to return it to its body to break the curse. He helps Allison escape the house through an attic window.  The spiritual force in the house coalesces into the form of a demonic head. Smashing through the walls and out of the house, it pursues the characters' fleeing vehicle. Barely eluding the head, Allison and Harris return the skull to its corpse, and the raging spirits disappear.  Later, Allison and Harris walk through the cemetery after the funerals of their friends. As they leave, the groundskeeper carefully places an ornate black envelope on one of the tombstones.  
The Graveyard (film)
 A group of friends (Jack, Allie, Sarah, Charlie, Michelle, and Eric) head to the Placid Pines Cemetery for a midnight game of hide and seek. Eric is chosen to be the seeker, and begins to count with his eyes closed as the friends spread out. As he opens his eyes, he sees a masked, knife-wielding man approaching. In fear, he begins to run away, looking back to see the masked man stab one of his friends. He keeps running and slips, impaling himself on protruding bars in the cemetery fence. As he bleeds to death, the friends gather around, with the masked man revealing himself as Bobby, the seventh friend. Their practical joke has gone horribly wrong.  Five years later, Michelle testifies at Bobby's probation hearing; apparently, Bobby was charged with manslaughter while the other friends were let off. Michelle, Bobby's former lover, has organized a reunion of the friends at a campsite near the Placid Pines Cemetery in hopes of bringing closure to the horrific accident that occurred earlier. Bobby is reticent as we learn the status of the other friends, clearly upset at having served time for a joke everyone else was in on. The friends meet up at the campsite (with Veronica, Jack's girlfriend), where they are greeted by the groundskeeper, Peter Bishop, with whom Michelle strikes a good rapport. Meanwhile, in an isolated shed, we see a bloodied man tied to a chair, awakening only to be brutally hacked to pieces by a masked assailant.  The group reunites, with Bobby making his disdain apparent to everyone. The group decides to try to relax until dinner, and it is revealed that Eric's family died a short while after Eric's death—victims of an arson. After a vigorous sex scene, featuring Jake's premature ejaculation, his girlfriend wanders off to take a shower. She is attacked and brutally murdered by a masked assailant. The group then tries to locate her, and, soon after, Jack is attacked by a masked man. His screams draw the others close, but it is revealed that the masked man is Bobby, who is chided for not having not learned his lesson. A light tone returns, though Veronica is still missing, as the group returns to the camp. However, Allie and Jake are killed in short order, and as their bodies are discovered, chaos descends on the surviving friends. Bobby heads for town and is arrested, as the sheriff is on the lookout for a murderer—a body was located in the woods earlier. Charlie accidentally electrocutes Sarah, and is subsequently bitten in the eye by a rattlesnake planted by the murderer. Peter and Michelle frantically realize they are alone with the killer.  The sheriff releases Bobby upon confirming his identity and heads out to scour the woods again. Before Bobby leaves, he sees an incoming fax that reveals the identity of the body found in the woods: Peter Bishop. Back at the camp, "Peter" reveals that he is Adam, Eric's brother. A psychopath, he burned down his home, using Eric's exhumed body as his own to fake his death. He takes Michelle to the cemetery and tells her to run, much like in the hide-and-seek game in which Eric died. He stalks her, but she is saved by Bobby's timely return. Adam is shot, but as the police close in, they are unable to locate his body. Some time later, Bobby and Michelle are escorted into a police car. They sit back, glad to be safe. The driver enters, and we see in the rear-view mirror that he is none other than Adam.

Gridiron Gang
 Sean Porter ([[Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson]]) works at [[Camp Kilpatrick|Kilpatrick Detention Center]] in [[Los Angeles]]. He becomes frustrated at not being able to help the kids get away from their problems in life when they are released from the center, such as [[street gangs]] and drug dealings.  He decides to create a [[American football|football]] team so the kids can feel like they're part of something. Porter believes that football will teach the teenage inmates what it takes to be responsible, mature, and disciplined winners. He picks out a few kids in the room that he feels will benefit from this program and requires that they practice with him the following day. He states to his new team, the [[Kilpatrick Mustangs]], "You do it my way, not your way.  Your way got you here and you're here because you lost.  Right now you are all losers, but if you accept this challenge and stick with the program, you are all going to be winners at the end." Two of the teens do not get along because they are from rival gangs. Willie Weathers ([[Jade Yorker]]) is from the 88’s and Kelvin Owens (David Thomas) is from the 95’s. The first game is against one of the best teams in the league, Barrington. The game starts out somewhat positive for the Mustangs, as they recover a fumble on the first drive, but things quickly turn. They are demolished by Barrington, losing by 38 points. After starting 0–2, the Mustangs start winning games as they learn to work together. Kelvin and Willie finally shake hands when they win a game by one [[touchdown]] after Kelvin makes a big block for Willie. Near the end of the season, the Mustangs are headed for the [[playoff]]s. They are getting more publicity and more fans along the way.  One of Willie’s 88 gang mates, Free, stops by the field. He realizes that Kelvin is a 95. Free and Kelvin get into a fight, and Free shoots Kelvin in the shoulder. As Free prepares to put another bullet in Kelvin's head, Willie runs toward Free and tackles him to the ground to save Kelvin. Free is shocked that Willie helped Kelvin and not him. The police show up, and Free runs off. He fires at the responding officers who fire in return, killing him. Although Kelvin survives the attack, he will not be able to play in the finals. Kilpatrick is almost forced to forfeit the playoff game due to concerns about further gang violence, but Porter's boss steps in to prevent it by arranging for volunteers from neighboring police departments to patrol the game.  The County Sheriff's spokesperson states that "We will do whatever it takes to ensure that gangs do not take over the lives of our youth".  In the playoff game, a rematch against Barrington, the Mustangs go into the half down 14–0. Willie gives a motivational speech, and they go out and beat Barrington on the last play of the game. It is revealed in the narration that they lost the championship game 17–14, but no one called them losers. A few months later, Sean's football method is officially made part of the program.  Nearly all the former members of the Mustangs are doing well in their new lives outside the detention center. Willie Weathers is playing football at a top boarding school, Kelvin Owens is playing football for Washington High, Kenny Bates is going to school in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]] and living with his mother, Junior Palaita got a job working for a furniture company, Leon Hayes is playing football for Dorsey High, Miguel Perez and Donald Madlock went back to their old gangs and are now in California youth authority prisons. Bug Wendal was killed in a [[drive-by shooting]] in Compton, California. Only five of the players are back in jail. The movie ends with a new group of Mustangs training for the next season. Some footage of the 1993 [[Gridiron Gang (1993 film)|Gridiron Gang]] documentary is shown during the end credits.  
The Groomsmen
 A groom and his four groomsmen wrestle with issues such as fatherhood, [[homosexuality]], honesty and growing up in the week leading up to his wedding.  Paulie (Burns), a self-supporting writer, is making plans for his marriage to Sue (Murphy), his girlfriend who is in her 5th month of pregnancy.  In real life, Burns' then-girlfriend, supermodel [[Christy Turlington]], was also five months pregnant when they married in June 2003.  Christy inspired Burns to rework the manuscript for this movie, which he hadn't worked on in many months.    Paulie is strongly advised by his older brother Jimbo (Logue) to not go through with the wedding. Jimbo, who runs a struggling business, is envious of Paulie, partly because his own childless marriage is unraveling.  T.C. (Leguizamo), who left the neighborhood without explanation eight years earlier, returns for the wedding. Apparently, before leaving, T.C. had stolen a [[Tom Seaver]] baseball card from Paulie's cousin Mike (Mohr). Mike still harbors such resentment over the loss that he immediately starts a fight with T.C. Later, T.C. hesitantly reveals that he abruptly left the neighborhood because he's [[gay]] and that he stole Mike's card because, even though they were best friends, he hated him for his constant verbal [[gay bashing]].  The neighborhood bar is owned by Dez (Lillard), who is married with two children and is the most content and functional member of the gang. He is continually trying to "get the band back together". He has even pushed his own sons into learning the guitar and is seen riding them to become better.  [[Jessica Capshaw]] has a small role in this film.  Her stepfather, [[Steven Spielberg]], directed Edward Burns in  [[Saving Private Ryan]].

Then the two of them goof around and eventually stay up all night together watching the sunrise. Griffin believes they are close but Phoenix doesn't show as much interest. Although Phoenix sends Griffin the occasional mixed signals, the two team up for a whirlwind of adventurous and almost childlike activities. However Phoenix doesn't want to hurt Griffin or herself by falling in love because she's too weak to deal with it as she too has cancer and is also short of time. One day while at Griffin's house after their adventure, while cleaning she comes across his books on dying and "living life to the fullest" and comes to the conclusion that Griffin knows she's ill and is being nice only out of sympathy. She storms out and after their confrontation Griffin explains that the books belong to him and he too has cancer. This causes the two to fall ever more deeply for one another, and their relationship deepens. Together, they strive to make the most of their last days of life. However while exploring and making the most of their last days, Griffin explains how when he gets seriously ill he will just leave and he wishes for her to not come looking for him because it's something he feels he must do himself. But Phoenix is first to get sick and uses Griffin's same words against him. This deeply hurts Griffin and causes him to overact. Later, however, after realizing he was wrong, he decides he wants to spend the last moments of Phoenix's life with her anyhow. The movie ends with Griffin making 'Christmas' for Phoenix, as it is her favorite season and it would be their last holiday together.

While waiting in a survival raft, his best friend, [[Chief Petty Officer]] Carl Billings ([[Omari Hardwick]]), dies. Shaken, Ben considers retiring but becomes an instructor at a Coast Guard training school.  Jake Fischer ([[Ashton Kutcher]]), a hot-shot candidate for AST, comes on the scene. Ranked as a top high school competitive swimmer with scholarships to every [[Ivy League]] college, Jake opted to enlist in the [[Coast Guard]]. At the "A" school, Ben is considered a legend with a countless number of rescues.  During training, Jake meets local schoolteacher, Emily Thomas ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]), and they begin a "casual" relationship, both knowing their time together is limited. Once the initial weeks of training end with most of the students dropping out, advanced instruction begins. After sleeping at Emily's house, Jake arrives late to class, and Ben punishes him and his entire team for his tardiness. Ben tries to force Jake to quit, but later sees Jake's persistence and dedication.  Meeting Emily in a bar, Jake recounts his beating all of Ben Randall's records. Maggie the barkeep ([[Bonnie Bramlett]]), Ben's old friend, tells Jake one unbeatable record Ben set when a hospital ship full of invalid patients caught fire, and Ben worked tirelessly to save all the victims. With one man left and a broken winch, Ben held the man by his fingertips till they landed safely, but received extensive injuries to his hand and shoulder.  Later, Jake's friend Billy Hodge is unable to cope with panicked victims in the water and afraid of failing school; Jake takes him out for a drink to cheer him up. In a [[United States Navy|Navy]] bar, they get in a fight and land in jail, standing up Emily. Jake arrives back at base beaten and bandaged, and takes the blame entirely.  Ben confronts Jake about his past. On a late night out, Jake, who flipped a coin for designated driver and lost, crashed, and high school relay team members died. Ben and Jake share common ground; they both know how it feels to be the only survivor.  Near graduation, only a handful of the original candidates remain, with Jake emerging as the leader during exercises. Emily comes to see Jake graduate, but the two part ways because Jake is leaving town. Jake is assigned to [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak|CG Air Station Kodiak]], [[Alaska]], Randall's previous post.  On a mission together, Ben and Jake are sent to rescue two kayakers trapped in a cave. Ben experiences flashbacks and appears to be incapacitated during the rescue. Jake, however, is able to guide him and together they successfully rescue the kayakers. Ben retires and tells Jake of his only record he kept track of – the 22 people he lost during his career. As Jake is sent out on another mission to rescue the crew of a sinking fishing trawler, Ben visits and apologizes to his wife and gives her signed divorce papers. Meanwhile, during the rescue, Jake becomes trapped in the ship after attempting to rescue the captain. His helicopter is forced to return to base, where Ben hears of the situation and opts to suit up to rescue Jake.  Once on scene, Ben finds and frees Jake from the hull, and as they hook up to the winch and proceed upwards towards the helicopter, their combined weight causes the cable to begin separating. Knowing that the cable would not last, Ben unclips himself from the cable so that Jake can survive. As Ben falls, Jake catches him by the hand and tells him he will not let him go. Ben sees that Jake will do anything to keep him alive and he says, "I know...", but Ben does not want him to die, so he unstraps his glove, plummeting from a fatal height into the ocean. Ben does not resurface and his body is never found.  Jake is on a rescue mission sometime later, when one of the survivors tells of a man in the sea who refused to let go. Jake connects this to the legend of the Guardian ("There's a legend of a man who lives beneath the sea. He is a fisher of men, the last hope of all those who have been left behind. Many survivors claim to have felt his gripping hands  beneath them, pushing them up to the surface, whispering strength until help could arrive"), as well as to Ben. He goes back to Emily and they rekindle their relationship.

Several months later, Rachel still blames herself for the death of her son, and is not only unable to finish her book but is also a simple signature away from formally being divorced from her husband. In an effort to finish her novel and find some emotional peace, Rachel moves away to a remote cottage on the Scottish coast. However, she soon starts to see the ghost of her late son, who at one point drags her into the waters and at another point moves a set of magnets on the refrigerator. A local town psychic informs Rachel that the spirit of her son is trying to tell her something, but the rest of the locals warn Rachel that the psychic is just a troubled woman.  Troubled by the possibility that her son has returned from the grave, Rachel shares her troubles with a young and handsome lighthouse keeper named Angus (Matheson) and the two spark a romance that suddenly goes awry when she learns that Angus died seven years ago by committing suicide after murdering his wife and her lover in the lighthouse. Rachel fears that she may be going insane and her efforts to prove otherwise, and learn more about the suicide-murder of Angus, falter when the news articles about the tragedy have gone missing from the local library, and Sharon Winton, her best friend and writer for a British tabloid journal, goes missing after Rachel saw her killed by Angus in the lighthouse.  It eventually comes to light that her soon to be ex-husband has been having an affair with her best friend, and that they paid a man, Patrick, to pose as Angus in order to cause an already emotionally unstable Rachel to act crazy enough in public that, when they make her murder look like a suicide, no one will suspect foul play. Just as Rachel is about to leave town, convinced that her dead son is trying to warn her that her life is in danger, she is drugged and dumped into the sea, only to be saved when the keys to the chains she has been put into suddenly fall into the water and thus allow her to free herself and make her way to the lighthouse in an effort to seek some revenge. (It was previously written on a slate, "don't forget, look behind you" and Rachel heard her son repeating those lines in water).  However, after a brief fight at the lighthouse, Sharon hits her head and is killed in the kitchen, and Brian is murdered by Patrick, possessed by the spirit of Angus, in much the same way that Angus's wife and lover died seven years previously. Patrick then jumps from the tower, as Angus had done. Rachel leaves town, with the promise that the house that she rented is kept empty so that Angus's spirit can finally rest. She returns to her home in London, where her son died, having decided to celebrate his life instead of mourning his death.

Dan perceives that Frank is a bad influence on Drey and tries to intercede.

In the film's pinnacle scene, Drey arrives at a place to deliver some drugs and walks into a room of stoned drug users. Dan is revealed to be the buyer. He walks out of the back room and slumps down at the sight of Drey as the drug runner. There is only a slight shameful nod from him as he hands her money for the drugs. The next day, Dan is not at school, and his students are told that he is being replaced by a Mr. Light, without much explanation. This changes something within Drey. She refuses a lift home from Frank, choosing to turn from that path.  She knocks on Dan's door and he answers. He goes into the bathroom, shaves and cleans himself up, before sitting down to drink a glass of water. Drey sits down and joins him. The film ends with Dan telling the same joke he heard from Cindy, but the timing is all wrong. Drey says, "That was horrible", and they both laugh.

Hanbando (film)
 The North and South Korean governments are on the verge of reopening the [[Gyeongui Line|Kyungui Railroad]], which connects the two Koreas, as a further step toward reunification.

Yet an age old conspiracy is uncovered where the imperial seal with which Emperor Gojong signed the documents is suspected to be fake. It is a race against time and hidden agendas as the South Korean president ([[Ahn Sung-ki]]) employs the outspoken historian Choi Min-jae ([[Cho Jae-hyun]]) and the descendant of the Joseon royal bloodline Kim Yu-shik ([[Kang Shin-il]]) to find the authentic seal and prevent the history of Japanese occupation from repeating itself. In the meantime, Japanese economic sanctions divide the South Korean government, and its armed forces appear on the border of South Korea threatening its sovereignty.

  A suburban family harbors a dark secret: When their parents are killed in a tragic accident, eldest Hamilton sibling David (Samuel Child) relocates the surviving family members to a quiet California suburb and assumes the responsibility of caring for his orphaned teenage siblings; Wendell (Joseph McKelheer), Darlene (Mackenzie Firgens), and Francis (Cory Knauf). While twins Wendell and Darlene seem to share a bizarre incestuous bond that separates them from the rest of the siblings, Francis acquires a video camera that previously belonged to his deceased parents and sets out preparing a school project about his family.  The all-seeing lens of Francis' roving camera begins to reveal that something malevolent is going on inside the Hamilton's picturesque abode. David finds work in a meat-packing warehouse, and is shown to bring some stuff from work home with him, while it is also implied that he is interested in men as he regularly invites male co-workers to go with him to a nearby motel for an evening.  One evening, Wendell kidnaps two young girls whom he meets in a local bar and they are tied in their storeroom. Older brother David drains blood off one of them till she slowly dies. Francis gets attracted to the other girl who tries to get him to help her. But things come to a head when Wendell and Darlene murder one of her classmates and feed off her blood.  When David tries to kill the other girl, Francis hits him in the head and carries her off to a safe hideout at the meat packing plant which is closed for the night. Wendell asks David to follow Francis, as he is the only one capable of persuading him to return. At the barn, Francis, seeing an open wound on the girl's hand, is unable to control his bloodlust and he kills the girl and feeds off her. When David appears, Francis is crying and we see his fangs. Though terribly sad at his actions, he finally seems to be accepting what he really is: a vampire.  With the death of Darlene's classmate, David decides to move somewhere else, and they go to the basement to retrieve the creature locked there, who turns out to be their little brother Lenny.  The family, the Hamilitons, is revealed to be a new breed of vampires who are born that way, not made. They move from place to place to hide their secret of their thirst for blood and to avoid detection from the authorities. In the final scene, we see them introducing themselves to their new neighbors, as the Thompsons, and Francis, now having embraced his newfound status as a vampire, is shown making a happy video of his now complete family.

Happy Feet
  Every [[emperor penguin]] sings a unique song called a "heartsong" to attract a [[Mating|mate]]. If the [[male]] penguin's heartsong matches the [[female]]'s song, the two penguins mate. Norma Jean, a female penguin, falls for Memphis, a male penguin and they become mates. They lay an egg, which is left in Memphis' care, while Norma Jean leaves with the other females to [[fish]]. While the males struggle through the harsh [[winter]], Memphis briefly drops the egg. As a result, their son, Mumble, is unable to sing, but he can [[tap dance]] instead. Nevertheless, he is enamored with Gloria, a female penguin who is regarded as the most talented of her age. One day, Mumble encounters a group of hostile [[skua]], with a leader who is tagged with a [[bird ringing|yellow band]], which he says is from an [[alien abduction]]. Mumble narrowly escapes the hungry birds by falling into a crevice.  Now a young adult, Mumble is frequently ridiculed by the elders. After escaping from a [[leopard seal]] attack, Mumble befriends a group of [[Adelie penguin]]s called "the Amigos", who embrace Mumble's dance moves and assimilate him into their group. After seeing a hidden human [[excavator]] in an avalanche, they opt to ask Lovelace, a [[Northern rockhopper penguin|rockhopper penguin]], about its origin. Lovelace has the plastic rings of a six pack entangled around his neck, which he claims have been bestowed upon him by mystic beings.  For the emperor penguins, it is mating season and Gloria is the center of attention. Ramón, one of the Amigos, attempts to help Mumble win her affection by singing a Spanish version of "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]", with Mumble [[lip sync]]ing, but the plan fails, and Gloria finds it embarrising. In desperation, Mumble begins tap dancing in synch with her song. She falls for him and the youthful penguins join in for singing and dancing to "[[Boogie Wonderland]]". The elders are appalled by Mumble's conduct, which they see as the reason for their lean fishing season. Memphis begs Mumble to stop dancing, for his own sake, but when Mumble refuses, he is exiled, prompting him to curse revenge on the elders for their blind belief.  Mumble and the Amigos return to Lovelace, only to find him being choked by the plastic rings. Lovelace confesses they were snagged on him while swimming off the forbidden shores, beyond the land of the [[elephant seals]]. Not long into their journey, they are met by Gloria, who wishes to join with Mumble as his mate. Fearing for her safety, he ridicules Gloria, driving her away.  At the forbidden shore, the group finds a fishing boat. Mumble pursues it solo to the brink of exhaustion. He is eventually washed up on the shore of [[Australia]], where he is rescued and kept at Marine World with [[Magellanic penguin]]s. After a long and secluded confinement in addition to fruitlessly trying to communicate with the humans, he nearly succumbs to [[Insanity|madness]]. When a girl attempts to interact with Mumble by tapping the glass, he starts dancing, which attracts a large crowd. He is released back into the wild, with a [[GPS wildlife tracking|tracking device]] attached to his back. He returns to his colony and challenges the will of the elders. Memphis reconciles with him, just as a research team arrives, proving the claims of the existence of "aliens" to be true. The whole of the colony, even Noah the leader of the elders, engages in dance.  The research team returns their expedition footage, prompting a worldwide debate. The governments realize they are [[overfishing]], leading to the banning of all Antarctic fishing. At this, the emperor penguins and the Amigos celebrate.  
Happily N'Ever After
 The story begins with the idea that the [[Magician (fantasy)|Wizard]] ([[George Carlin]]) controls all of the [[fairy tales]] and maintains the balance of good and evil in Fairy Tale Land. With the help of his assistants the uptight Munk ([[Wallace Shawn]]) and the decidedly goofy Mambo ([[Andy Dick]]), the Wizard is checking to make sure that all the fairy tales under his care are "on track" to have their traditional [[happy ending]]s. As we meet him however, the Wizard is leaving for [[Scotland]] for a long-overdue vacation. He leaves the kingdom in the hands of Munk and Mambo.  Ella is a girl who is better known as [[Cinderella]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]). She lives as a servant to her step family, dreams of the Prince ([[Patrick Warburton]]) who will sweep her off her feet. Her best friend at the palace is Rick ([[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]]), the palace dishwasher. Rick takes it upon himself to deliver the invitations to the royal ball to Ella. Ella sees Rick only as a friend, but Rick secretly loves Ella, although he is too cool and proud to admit it. Rick can't really understand what Ella likes about the Prince. Rick's Three Amigos, the comic chefs (all voiced by [[Phil Proctor]], [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Tom Kenny]]) in the palace kitchen, believe that Rick has a bad case of "Prince envy".  The Prince does everything by the book, and plans to meet his maiden at the ball.   However, things don't go as planned at the ball. Thanks to the assistants, Ella's evil stepmother, Frieda ([[Sigourney Weaver]]) gains access to the Wizard's lair during the Prince's ball. She manages to chase off Munk and Mambo and tip the scales of good and evil, causing a series of fairy tales to go wrong and have unhappy endings, including [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] getting stepped on by the [[Giant (mythology)|Giant]] ([[John DiMaggio]]) yet surviving, [[Rumpelstiltskin]] ([[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]]) winning his bet with the miller's daughter ([[Jill Talley]]) and taking her baby, and the unseen demise of [[Little Red Riding Hood]].

Ella finds out and escapes to the woods where she meets Munk and Mambo. The trio set out to find the prince who has goes looking for his maiden (not knowing it was actually Ella) in hopes that he will defeat Frieda and save the day.  Together, they flee to the [[Seven Dwarfs]] (all played by Tom Kenny and John DiMaggio) home. Witches and [[troll]]s led by [[The Snow Queen|The Ice Queen]] attack them. The Seven Dwarfs hold off the trolls, while they flee with the help of Rick who had stolen a flying broom. Frieda decides to go after Ella herself. She succeeds in capturing her and returns to the palace, with Rick, Munk and Mambo in pursuit. Frieda tortures Ella because if the story had run its course she would have married the prince while Frieda would never get anywhere in life. Rick, Munk, and Mambo slip into the castle and attack Frieda. During the fight, Frieda generates a pit in the floor. Mambo knocks her in, but she uses her staff to fly back up again. After a short battle, in which Rick takes a blast meant for Ella and falls into a deep sleep, Frieda creates a portal by accident. Ella knocks Frieda back and punches her into the portal. Rick awakes from the spell and he and Ella kiss, finally admitting their feelings for each other.  Ella and her true love Rick decide to choose their destinies in a world of happy endings and get married. Rumpelstiltskin has shown throughout the movie that he has come to care for the baby and the miller's daughter lets him stay in the castle as the baby's nanny. The Wizard returns from vacation where he wasn't told about what happened while he was away.  In the final scene, Frieda is shown trapped in the Arctic surrounded by [[elephant seal]]s.

One night a group of mean teenagers stumbled across the house and threw fireworks at it to scare Victor. The house began burning, and Thomas returned, causing the teens to flee. Victor was killed when Thomas accidentally hit him in the face with a hatchet while trying to break down the door. Marybeth claims that Victor, now undead, roams the swamp at night, looking for his father, and that they are not safe in the woods, but the crew don't believe her.

Marybeth bends the pole until it is pointed at Victor, who impales himself upon it and collapses, apparently killing him. Ben and Marybeth flee in Sampson's boat; Marybeth is ensnared by seaweed and pulled underwater.

In the [[New Mexico]] desert, they meet a [[gas station]] attendant named Jeb ([[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]]), who tells them of a short-cut through the hills. After taking the supposed short-cut, their tires are punctured by a hidden spike strip. Doug and Bob go look for help, while the rest of the family stays behind.  Later that day Bobby chases a panicked Beauty into the hills and finds her mutilated body. Frightened, he runs and falls, knocking himself unconscious.

As Doug travels towards the interstate, he finds a vast area full of craters that are filled with numerous abandoned cars and other items.  Bob goes back to the gas station for help, and after finding news clippings detailing various disappearances that have occurred in the area, he realizes the attendant purposefully led them to danger by suggesting they take an alternative route through the hills. When Bob exits he finds the hysterical Jeb, who commits suicide in front of him. In fear, Bob attempts to flee, but is attacked by the mutant leader, [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Papa Jupiter|Papa Jupiter]] ([[Billy Drago]]), and dragged into the mining caves by Jupiter, Jupiter's eldest son [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Lizard|Lizard]] ([[Robert Joy]]), and Pluto.  Bobby returns to the trailer, but doesn't mention Beauty's death not wanting to frighten the rest of the family. Later that night, the family is awakened by Bob's screams, and they all rush from the trailer, except for Brenda and the baby, who are left behind. Outside they find Bob being burned alive on a stake and frantically try to save him, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Pluto and Lizard use the distraction to ransack the trailer, and Lizard beats and [[rapes]] Brenda.

Outside, Doug kills the mutant [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Cyst|Cyst]] ([[Greg Nicotero|Gregory Nicotero]]) and continues to search for Catherine. After ordering Lizard to kill Catherine, Big Brain is mauled to death by Beast.

Doug sees Ruby running through the hills with Catherine and follows her. At the trailer, Brenda and Bobby discover their mother's body missing and track it to find Papa Jupiter eating her, so they lure him towards the trailer and prepare an explosive trap, which destroys the trailer, apparently killing Papa Jupiter.  Doug catches up with Ruby, but before she can return Catherine, Lizard attacks him. Lizard and Doug have fight and Lizard is presumed dead. Ruby gives Doug his daughter back. Lizard, who is still alive aims a shotgun at Doug. In order to save Doug, Ruby tackles Lizard off a cliff, sending them falling to their deaths.

The History Boys (film)
 In a boys' [[grammar school]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1983, students Crowther, Posner, Dakin, Timms, Akthar, Lockwood, Scripps, and Rudge have recently obtained the school's highest ever [[A-level]] scores and are hoping to enter [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], taking a seventh-term entrance exam in History. The General Studies teacher, known by staff and boys alike by his nickname "Hector" ([[Richard Griffiths]]), is much beloved, and works alongside their deputy head and regular History teacher, Mrs. Lintott ([[Frances de la Tour]]). The Headmaster, known by all as "Felix", appoints a temporary contract teacher, Tom Irwin ([[Stephen Campbell Moore]]), who had been at Oxford, to help the boys along in their quest. Irwin is only a few years older than his students but proves to be a bold and demanding teacher, and particularly difficult to impress.  As part of their General Studies, the class acts out scenes from romantic films and literature. At the conclusion of each class, Hector offers a lift to one of the students on his motorbike and it is generally known (and dismissed as a joke) that he touches them inappropriately on the ride. The only one he never takes along is Posner ([[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]]), a slight Jewish boy, who doesn't hide his infatuation with Dakin ([[Dominic Cooper]]). Dakin, who characterises himself as an aspiring lecher, is currently pursuing an affair with the headmaster's secretary, Fiona ([[Georgia Taylor]]). He is not displeased by Posner's attention, but finds himself increasingly interested in Irwin. Gradually, Dakin's quest to impress Irwin on an intellectual level evolves into a flirtatious, potentially sexual pursuit of his young teacher, who is visibly attracted to Dakin. Meanwhile, Hector's indiscretions are shockingly revealed and Felix instructs him to "retire early".  The boys continue their studies and all gain places at Oxford and Cambridge, including the famously dimwitted Rudge ([[Russell Tovey]]), with Posner and Dakin winning scholarships. On their last day at the end of term, Dakin calls out Irwin on a lie and asks him out for a drink, overtly revealing his sexual interest in him, much to Irwin's confusion and repressed enthusiasm. They agree to get together that very Sunday. Dakin then proceeds to the Headmaster's office and, by threatening to reveal Felix's own sexual harassment of Fiona, forces him to reinstate Hector.  As the boys prepare to leave the grammar school, Hector agrees to give Dakin a ride home on the motorbike "for old times' sake". However, before they leave, the headmaster runs out and stops them, saying that Hector should not take one of the boys. He suggests that Hector take Irwin instead. Dakin gladly hands the helmet to him, and the screen fades to white as they drive off, the boys waving happily and laughing.  Off-screen, there is a motorcycle accident; Hector is killed and Irwin is injured. Dakin (in voiceover) says that Irwin had never been on the back of a bike and so may have unbalanced Hector, leading to Hector's death, and that Irwin and he never got a chance to meet that Sunday. The boys sing "Bye Bye Blackbird" at Hector's memorial service and the Headmaster gives a general speech. Mrs. Lintott then turns and asks: "Will they come to my funeral, I wonder?". The school hall is shown with only the boys sitting and each recounts his life: Akthar, a headmaster; Crowther, a magistrate; Timms, a drug-taking dry-cleaning manager; and Dakin, a tax lawyer. Lockwood, a junior army officer, was killed by friendly fire at 28 years old. Rudge is a builder, Scripps a journalist, and Irwin makes history TV programmes, though Mrs. Lintott says they are more journalism. Posner is a teacher and takes the same approach that Hector did, save for the touching. The final shot shows the boys and teachers standing at the field trip lawn, with Hector's voice encouraging them to "pass it on".

The Hoax
 In 1971, publishing executives at [[McGraw-Hill]] express an interest in Clifford Irving's novel, ''Rudnick's Problem.'' ''Fake!'', his previous book about art forger [[Elmyr de Hory]], had sold poorly. Irving believes he has a breakout work, but the publisher decides against releasing the book after a ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' editor deems it unsatisfactory.  Vacationing with his friend and researcher [[Richard Suskind]], Irving is ejected from his hotel at 1 a.m, after eccentric billionaire [[Howard Hughes]] arrives and demands the entire building be vacated. Returning to [[New York City]] to meet with his publishers, Irving finds he has been reduced to meeting with an assistant. Irving storms into the board room, says his new project will be the "book of the century", and threatens to take it elsewhere. He struggles to come up with a topic fit for his grandiose claim. Seeing a cover story on Hughes, he decides to make him the subject.   Irving tells McGraw-Hill that Hughes has recruited him to help write his autobiography, and shows forged handwritten notes from Hughes as proof. Handwriting experts confirm the notes as genuine, and the publishers strike a $500,000 deal for the book. Irving believes that the reclusive Hughes is unlikely to sue him, and that his eccentricities can be used to deflect any denials of authenticity for the book.   At the time Irving is having marital problems with his artist wife Edith; he has had an affair. Irving assures Edith he'll be faithful as he leaves to begin research with Suskind. To fool experts, the two men devote days to studying documents pertaining to Hughes. They illicitly obtain a copy of a draft biography of [[Noah Dietrich]], a retired Hughes aide, which provides details that add to the apparent authenticity of their work. Irving recites passages into a tape recorder while in character as Hughes, dressing like the millionaire and adding a mustache during these sessions.  As work on the book progresses, Irving receives a box containing scandalous material about questionable dealings between Hughes and President [[Richard Nixon]]. He believes that Hughes sent the package and convinces himself that Hughes wants this damaging material included in the book, as a sign he supports the work.   As the publication date draws near, Irving elaborates his hoax, staging an "aborted" meeting between Hughes and the publishers. Hughes has officially denied that he was involved in the work, but the McGraw-Hill executives are convinced it is genuine. They begin to think it will be a bestseller and Irving works to gain larger payments for himself and (purportedly) Hughes. Irving and Edith concoct a scheme for her to deposit Hughes' check, payable to H. R. Hughes, into a Swiss bank account, using a forged passport with the name Helga R. Hughes.  The continuing drama makes Irving increasingly paranoid. He has alcohol-fueled fantasies about being kidnapped by Hughes' people. His affair with Van Pallandt continues, and the pressure of keeping up a pretense of fidelity with his wife adds to his stress. In what is implied to be a favor to Nixon, Hughes goes public via a televised conference call and denies any knowledge of Irving or the book. Irving is arrested and agrees to cooperate if Edith is granted [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]]. At a press conference, a government spokesman announces Irving, Edith, and Suskind have received short jail sentences.  An overheard radio report details a sudden wave of legal decisions in favor of Hughes. Irving believes this indicates that his book had been used to place the president in debt to Hughes. A fleeting scene set inside the Nixon White House suggests that Nixon's preoccupation with Hughes led directly to the [[Watergate scandal|burglary and wiretapping of Democratic Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel]]. Historians and political analysts dispute this.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/watergate-aviator-connection/ "Watergate Aviator connection"], CBS News</ref>

The Holiday
 Iris Simpkins ([[Kate Winslet]]), a wedding columnist for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in [[London]], is still in love with her co-worker Jasper Bloom ([[Rufus Sewell]]) for over three years, even though he cheated on her and they have broken up. When she learns that he is engaged to marry another woman, Iris is distraught, and desirous of a life change. Meanwhile, Amanda Woods ([[Cameron Diaz]]), a workaholic [[business executive]] living in Los Angeles, discovers that her boyfriend Ethan Ebbers ([[Edward Burns]]) has been cheating on her with his receptionist. After breaking up with him, she decides to get away for the Christmas holidays and visits a home-exchange website on which Iris has listed her cottage in [[Surrey]], [[England]]. Amanda contacts Iris, and the two women agree to swap homes for two weeks.  While Iris revels in the luxury of Amanda's large [[Los Angeles]] home, Amanda is disappointed by the slow, quiet pace of life in Iris's quaint cottage. She grows bored after only a few hours and books a flight home for the following day. Later that night, Iris's brother, Graham ([[Jude Law]]), knocks at the door thinking Iris is home. Graham asks Amanda to let him spend the night despite never previously meeting, as he has been drinking at the pub and does not want to drive home. Amanda agrees. After a brief, drunken conversation, they kiss and later end up sleeping together.  In the morning, Graham receives phone calls from Sophie and Olivia, which arouse Amanda's suspicions that Graham has multiple girlfriends. Graham, knowing that Amanda is planning to return home imminently, invites her to dinner later that night if she decides to change her mind, which she later does. They spend time together over the days that follow, but Amanda becomes worried that their relationship will be complicated as she is only living in England for two weeks.  Meanwhile in America, Iris meets Miles Dumont ([[Jack Black]]), Ethan's assistant, and later, an elderly neighbour named Arthur Abbott ([[Eli Wallach]]). She learns that he was a screenwriter during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. The two become friends. Arthur notes that Iris's relationship with Jasper is not serving her well, and he suggests movies for her to watch that include strong female characters, in hopes that she can acquire what he calls "gumption." Back in England, Amanda chooses not to see Graham again but, alone again in the cottage, she has a change of heart and surprises Graham at his house, where she meets his two young daughters, Sophie and Olivia. He reveals he is a widower.   Iris then discovers that the Screenwriters' Guild wants to throw a grand celebration in Arthur's honor, but he is reluctant to attend because he does not expect to know many of the attendees, he cannot walk without the assistance of his walker, and he does not want to embarrass himself on stage. Iris encourages him to go and promises to help him prepare by undertaking an exercise program together, determined to help him walk without his walker. During this time, Jasper contacts her from England, asking her to assist with the book he is writing. She agrees to look over his pages, but does not have the chance to do so after spending so much time with Miles and Arthur.  Iris and Miles slowly become close friends and spend more and more time together. Iris returns to Amanda's house and is surprised to find Jasper at her doorstep. Iris is touched at first and the two spend a cosy night in together, only for Iris to discover he is still engaged. She breaks up with him for good, claiming he has never treated her right and that she has finally got clarity. Meanwhile, Miles breaks up with his cheating girlfriend also, and rushes to attend Arthur's award ceremony with Iris. The event is filled with attendees standing and applauding Arthur's lifetime of achievements. That, and the music that Miles wrote especially for Arthur for this moment, give him the confidence to walk onto the stage unassisted. Miles asks Iris for a date on New Year's Eve, but she reminds him she will be back in England by then. He agrees to travel to the United Kingdom for her.  Meanwhile, Graham confesses his love for Amanda on the night before she is scheduled to depart, but Amanda is still doubtful that a long-distance relationship will work. On her way to the airport, she realises she feels the same way and returns to the cottage and reunites with Graham. Amanda tells him that she has decided to stay to spend New Year's Eve with him, and they embrace. Iris and Miles celebrate the new year with Amanda and Graham and his two daughters, enjoying the evening, and laughing and dancing together.  
Hollywoodland
 In June 1959, Louis Simo ([[Adrien Brody]]), a [[Los Angeles]] private investigator more interested in generating an income than in devotion to his clients, is spying on the wife of a man named Chester Sinclair to find if she is cheating. On a visit to his own ex-wife Laurie, Simo learns that his son is upset over the recent death of actor [[George Reeves]], who played [[Superman]] on television. Reeves was found dead inside his [[Beverly Hills]] home with a gunshot wound to the head, which police ruled a [[suicide]].  Simo learns from a former police colleague that the Reeves suicide has aspects that the cops don't want to touch. Sensing the potential for making a name for himself, Simo begins investigating and notes several apparent conflicts with the official version of Reeves's death. He also bickers with Laurie over his failures as a father, particularly now when his son seems so troubled.  Years previously, in 1951, Reeves ([[Ben Affleck]]) is a charming man whose acting career has stalled since appearing in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. He catches the eye of a beautiful woman and they end the night in each other's arms. In the morning, a newspaper photo reveals to Reeves that the woman is [[Toni Mannix]], the wife of [[Eddie Mannix]], the general manager of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].  Frightened that an affair with a studio boss's wife will destroy what is left of his career, Reeves is angry that Toni did not tell him. She claims to have an open relationship with Mannix and tells him not to worry. The much wealthier Toni begins to buy Reeves expensive gifts such as a house, a car and jewelry.  Reeves lands the starring role in the television series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', based on the comic book hero. The role makes Reeves famous and gives him a steady income, but he longs for more "serious" work and is uncomfortable with the public's stereotype of him as Superman, resulting in snickers when he is seen on screen in the war film ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''.  As the years pass, Reeves becomes bitter at being a kept man and at Toni for not using her clout to help his career. He barbeques his Superman costume to "celebrate" the program's cancellation in 1958. He also meets a young woman in [[New York City]], actress [[Leonore Lemmon]], and leaves Toni for her. Toni is broken hearted and furious and seethes at her "mistreatment" by Reeves.  Simo initially suspects that Leonore might have accidentally shot Reeves during an argument and imagines how the scenario might have played out. Simo is beaten at his home by thugs, apparently working for Mannix, who are trying to scare him off the case. This and other evidence leads Simo to suspect that Mannix was the one who had Reeves murdered. Simo has a vision of how that killing would have occurred.  Sinclair murders his wife, having grown impatient waiting for Simo's report. A guilt-plagued Simo gets drunk, then visits his son's school, where his inebriation scares the boy. Simo visits Reeves' manager, Arthur Weissman, who has a home movie that Reeves shot to promote some wrestling work. Reeves' sadness and disappointment with his life is on display in the footage. Simo's final imagined variation on Reeves' death concludes with the actor shooting himself. This is the most vivid of the three scenarios, and Simo imagines himself in the upstairs bedroom watching the suicide.  Each of the scenes imagined by Simo begins with Reeves playing guitar and singing "[[Green Eyes (Aquellos Ojos Verdes)|Aquellos Ojos Verdes (Green Eyes)]]" in Spanish for his house guests. After each of the three imagined renditions, Reeves says goodnight to his guests, then retires to his bedroom upstairs, just before the gunshot.  Reeves' quest for success and Simo's realization of parallels to his own existence cause the detective to re-evaluate his life. Simo watches another home movie, this one of himself and Laurie and their son in happier days. He goes to Laurie's house wearing a suit and tie, greeting his son hopefully.  
Hollow Man 2
 The movie opens at a cocktail party at the Reisner Institute, a Washington [[think tank]], some time after the events of the first movie. An invisible force drags a scientist named Dylan into a nearby bathroom, where the force (implied to be a person) brutally throws Dylan around for information. Dylan mentions another scientist, Maggie Dalton, who knows the "formula" the invisible person is looking for. Apparently accepting this, the invisible person releases him, warning him not to tell anyone he was there. As soon as the invisible man leaves (or rather, pretends to leave),  Dylan attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man smashes the phone and slashes Dylan's throat. The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct a murder investigation, but the laboratory's military supervisor, Colonel Gavin Bishop, insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction. Fearing attacks on the remaining scientists, the lab's owner, Dr. William Reisner, employs Frank Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez, to protect Maggie, but refuses to divulge any information on the nature of his work.  The two detectives stand guard outside Maggie's house. When Lisa opens the door to let the cat in, the invisible man sneaks past her into the house. Just as he reaches the study where Maggie is, Lisa tracks him down, and he kills her with a lamp's power cord. Suddenly, armed military commandos appear and storm the house, using thermal goggles to target and corner the invisible man. Outside, Turner confronts Bishop, realizing that they used him and Lisa to lure the invisible man to the house. Several [[stun grenades]] go off around the house, incapacitating the soldiers and allowing the invisible man to escape in pursuit of Turner and Maggie. He almost catches up to them, but is struck and badly injured by a car, and flees.  Maggie is taken into protective custody by the police, where Turner's superior and friend, Captain Tom Harrison, has received orders to have her transferred to military custody. Frank helps Maggie escape from the police station and they flee in a stolen car. Bishop and Reisner, knowing their careers would end if Maggie talks, declare them fugitives.  Maggie later tells Turner that [[Hollow Man|five years prior, a team of scientists figured out how to make humans invisible, but something went wrong, leaving only two survivors]]. A year after the original project was scrapped, the Reisner Institute restarted the experiments as a covertly [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]-funded operation to create the perfect soldier, codenamed "Silent Knight", which attempts to render humans invisible. The resulting [[drug|serum]] ''does'' turn human tissue invisible, but with [[adverse effect]]s: as it allows light to pass directly through the subject, the [[radiation]] damages the cells and causes physical and mental degradation, slowly killing the person. Maggie developed a compound called the "Buffer" to counteract the effects of that particular radiation. A soldier named Michael Griffin volunteered, and the serum succeeded, but the Buffer failed and Griffin seemingly died, which in turn got Maggie fired. Maggie believes that Griffin faked his death so he could use his powers without restraint, but now needs the [[antidote]] to the radiation before he dies.  Maggie receives a message from a man named Ludlow, who has been in contact with her for weeks. Turner uses his contacts to find Ludlow, a soldier enlisted into the program after [[Hollow Man#Cast|Sebastian Caine]] (the original guinea pig), but before Griffin. He had gone into hiding, but is now slowly dying from radiation. Ludlow has also been tracking Griffin, and reveals the true story to his supposed "death" and the program itself: Operation Silent Knight was ''never'' about national security, and neither was Griffin given the Buffer, since they used him to assassinate their political enemies.  Meanwhile, Griffin infiltrates Bishop's office and both get into a fight. The latter attempts to reason with him and then, getting desperate, stabs him with a pen (non-fatally). Griffin impales Bishop with the same pen, and uses his computer to locate Ludlow. Arriving at the hideout, Griffin attacks Turner, but Ludlow intervenes, sacrificing himself to allow Turner and Maggie to escape. Griffin decides to make them return by capturing Maggie's sister. When they meet at the train station where he is hiding, Griffin silently catches Maggie and tries to turn her invisible so he can take her unnoticed, but Turner intervenes. After a short fight, Griffin escapes with Maggie, leaving Turner with the arriving Reisner and his guards. A short time later, Reisner pursues an invisible man, but is soon captured and held by him. Believing him to be Griffin, he offers to send for the Buffer. The figure, however, is ''Turner'', who used Griffin's discarded syringe to become invisible as well. Reisner, backing away, is hit and killed by a speeding car.  Griffin takes Maggie to her old college laboratory to create the Buffer for him. Griffin forces her to inject herself with it first, than injects himself with another dose. With his survival seemingly assured, Griffin tries to kill Maggie, but Turner intervenes and knocks him out of the laboratory window. Turner runs outside, where Griffin renders him unconscious. As Griffin slowly turns visible, Maggie reveals that he has been poisoned, as the vial contained [[rat poison]]; she loses consciousness. Enraged, Griffin takes a shovel and attempts to kill her, but Turner, having recovered, stops him and kills him with the shovel. He then carries Maggie away for medical attention, leaving Griffin's body outside in the rain.  A few days later, Maggie is recovering in hospital and is poised to be released. Heather tells her that Turner has not been found. Maggie insists that he will come back to her, as she knows he needs her. Outside, they are being watched by a hooded invisible man, presumably Turner, who then walks away.

Over the next several years, there are sightings of a strange amphibious creature in the waterway, and the fish in the river die off. A suicidal man, just before jumping into the river, sees something dark moving in the water.  In 2006, a slow-witted young man named Park Gang-du ([[Song Kang-ho]]) runs a small snack-bar in a park near the River with his father, Hee-bong ([[Byun Hee-bong]]). Other family members are Gang-du's daughter, Hyun-seo ([[Go Ah-sung]]); his sister Nam-joo ([[Bae Doona]]), a national medalist [[archery|archer]]; and his brother, Nam-il ([[Park Hae-il]]), an alcoholic college graduate and former political activist.  While Gang-du is delivering food to some customers, a huge creature (voiced by [[Oh Dal-su]]) emerges from the Han River and begins attacking people. Gang-du sees his daughter in the crowd and tries to grab her and run. As he realizes he has grabbed the wrong girl, he sees the creature snatching Hyun-seo and diving back into the river. After a mass funeral for the victims, government representatives and the American military arrive and quarantine people who had contact with the creature, including Gang-du and his family. It is announced that the creature is not only a direct danger, but also the host of a deadly, unknown virus.  Gang-du is in a hospital when he receives a phone call from Hyun-seo. She is on the phone long enough to explain that she is trapped somewhere in the sewers with the creature, but her phone stops working shortly after.  Gang-du tries to explain this to others, but his claims go ignored by all except his family. The four of them escape the hospital. Hee-bong buys a truck, weapons, and a map of the sewers to look for Hyun-seo. They find a snack bar, have a meal and rest. Upon waking up, they encounter the creature. Soon, they discover their gun only serves to anger it, and Hee-bong is killed buying time for his children to escape. Gang-du is captured by the Army. Nam-il and Nam-joo escape but are separated from each other.  Two homeless boys, Se-jin (Lee Jae-eung) and Se-joo (Lee Dong-ho), are searching for food when they are attacked and swallowed by the creature. It returns to its sleeping area in the sewer, a large hole, and regurgitates them. Only Se-Joo is alive. Hyun-seo helps Se-Joo hide in a spot the creature cannot reach.  Nam-il meets an old friend ([[Yim Pil-sung]]) to trace the location of Hyun-seo's call. He learns that the government has placed a bounty on his family. The friend tries to capture Nam-il, but he manages to escape after obtaining Hyun-seo's general location. He texts the location to Nam-joo and Gang-du. He meets a homeless man ([[Yoon Je-moon]]) who knows about the quarantine but decided to stay in the city. After learning of Nam-il's intentions, the man decides to help him. Gang-du overhears an American scientist (Paul Lazar) discussing the fact that there is no virus; it is all made up to distract people from the creature's origin. The scientists decide to lobotomize Gang-du to silence him. Gang-du escapes by taking one of the nurses ([[Go Soo-hee]]) hostage and continues searching for his daughter.  Back in the sewers, while the creature is sleeping, Hyun-seo makes a rope from old clothes and uses it to get out of the hole. She realizes too late that the creature only feigns sleep to lure her out of her hiding spot. Hyun-seo and Se-joo are swallowed by the creature.  The government announces the plan to release a chemical called Agent Yellow into the river and the surrounding area, hoping it will kill the creature. Gang-du finds the creature's sleeping spot but sees no one there. As Gang-du climbs down to the hole, the monster passes over him. He sees Hyun-seo's arm hanging out of its mouth and gives chase, meeting Nam-joo on the way. The creature makes its way to the location where Agent Yellow is released and a large crowd has formed in protest.  As the creature attacks the crowd, Agent Yellow is released, which appears to stun the creature. Gang-du pulls Hyun-seo out of its mouth and sees her still clutching Se-joo; Hyun-seo is revealed to have died protecting him.  Gang-du, enraged at his daughter's death, attacks the creature as it wakes up, but is knocked to the ground. Nam-il and the homeless man come to Gang-du's aid. While Nam-il throws Molotov cocktails at the creature, the homeless man pours gasoline onto it. Nam-il accidentally drops his last bottle. Nam-joo picks up the flaming cloth from the bottle with one of her arrows and fires it at the creature, setting it on fire. Before the creature can escape into the water, Gang-du impales it with a metal pole, finally killing it. As Nam-il and Nam-joo hold Hyun-seo, mourning her death, Gang-du revives Se-joo and takes him to safety.  In the final scene, Gang-du has adopted Se-joo. The two live in his food stand, and he still watches over the river. They have a meal together, ignoring a news broadcast about the aftermath of the incident, on Se-joo's encouraging that they concentrate on eating.  
Hood of Horror
 ===Intro=== The animated introduction revolves around how Devon (voiced by [[Snoop Dogg]]) becomes a Hound of Hell, in which he agreed to sell his soul to a demon named Liore (voiced by [[Hawthorne James]]) to bring back his dead sister (whom he has accidentally killed). Liore grants him knowledge, strength, and the power to decide who goes to heaven or hell for an unspecified period of time. The animation is switched out showing Devon as a real person, as he narrates the stories.  ===Crossed Out=== A female [[graffiti|tagger]] named Posie ([[Daniella Alonso]]) is given the power of death by a mysterious Derelict ([[Danny Trejo]]), another Hound of Hell who captures her while she tries to escape from some gang members ([[Teyo Johnson]], [[Noel Gugliemi]] and [[Jeffrey Licon]]) that harmed her mother ([[Andrea Lion]]). With it, any tag she "crosses out" causes the gruesome demise of the original tagger. She later suffers the ultimate price when she loses sight of her calling as an artist and starts to abuse her power. The Derelict told her that she could have broken the cycle of murder and violence in her city, but instead she made it worse. He takes the power away and sics the zombies of the recently deceased gang members on her. They lodge a spray-paint can in her head and spray the wall with her blood into a beautiful mural. Derelict tells the viewers "Now that's life imitating art."  A service held by Pastor Charlie ([[Billy Dee Williams]]) is given for Posie and her beautiful flower mural, while Devon and Derelict watch on in human disguises.  ===The Scumlord=== A racist white couple, Tex Woods Jr. ([[Anson Mount]]) and Tiffany ([[Brande Roderick]]), are given the chance at inheritance when Tex's father Tex Woods Sr. ([[Chuck Hicks]]) dies "mysteriously". But in order for them to receive the inheritance, they have to live with some black Vietnam vets ([[Ernie Hudson]], [[Richard Gant]], [[Tucker Smallwood]] and [[L. Kenneth Richardson]]) that served under Tex's father for a year.  Instead of learning tolerance and respect from the vets, Tex and Tiffany just harass them and force them to work. When they start to cause casualties, they soon become victims to their unhappy house mates. After Tiffany dies by stomach explosion from caviar and Tex Woods Jr.'s demise upon the housemates getting him impaled on a horn, the remaining housemates gain the inheritance of their friend Tex Woods and celebrate.  Soon, Devon, who is now revealed to be the new landlord, greets them and congratulates them on their new wealth. However, it's short lived when Tiffany's pet chihuahua Pootie starts barking at Devon, who shoots it in anger. Then he calmly says "No pets allowed."  ===Rapsody Askew=== A new rapper named SOD ([[Pooch Hall]]) is finally starting to gain recognition and fame.  During an awards show after party, he is confronted by Clara ([[Lin Shaye]]), a mysterious woman who seemingly stops time implying she too is a Hound of Hell. She shows him videos from his up-and-coming days: from when he first met Quon ([[Aries Spears]]) (another up-coming MC) to Quon's last day when he was gunned down in a liquor store by a masked burglar. During that life, Quon was always there acting as a big brother usually defending SOD when his ego got out of line. Quon was offered a solo career by a British Record Mogul ([[Jason Alexander]]) after SOD's behavior was out of control, but Quon refused and stayed with SOD.  When SOD denies having anything to do with his death to Clara, Quon enters the room upon Clara's eyes glowing a familiar color. Back from the dead as a zombie, Quon knows it was really SOD and SOD's manager Jersey ([[Diamond Dallas Page]]) who were behind his death revealing the elaborate plot of SOD wearing a bulletproof vest as well as Jersey being the gunman as an act of betrayal and act of fame. Quon then brutally kills Jersey and frames SOD, who is then gunned down by the police during a shootout with them where he dies in the elevator.  ===Epilogue=== During all the stories, Devon tells the audience that each character had the potential to do good in life, but instead, chose to do evil for their own needs that resulted in each of their deaths. After each segment, he takes all the deceased characters to a mysterious elevator. First pulling Posie out of her mural, then dragging Tex Woods Jr. by the horn which is embedded in his neck with his partner Half Pint dragging Tiffany afterwards. After claiming SOD who wakes up in the elevator, Devon takes SOD, Posie, Tex Wood Jr., and Tiffany and sends all of them to a one-way ticket straight to hell, where all of them are further tormented. Devon tells the viewers that what they saw is what he does. When Half-Pint tries to quit, Devon reminds him that he can't because they must do this for all eternity.

She crosses paths with Rohit, (Arjun Rampal) who saves her life when she is about to fall over a cliff. The pair spend time together and fall in love. At one point, Durga creates a clay bust of Rohit but weeps because she cannot see it. Rohit tells her that he will find a way to help her see again.  When Durga's mother is killed due to the actions of another suitor, Rohit promises to marry her so that he can take care of her. He takes her to a hospital where she will have surgery to regain her sight. While she is recovering (before the bandages are removed), Rohit leaves to prepare their new home. The jealous suitor steps in and apparently kills Rohit.  Upon receiving news of Rohit's death, Durga goes into depression. Dr. Prasad, who performed the surgery, takes her in as his own adopted daughter. As part of his plan to help her recover, he takes her to Switzerland. There she meets Raj (Bobby Deol), a businessman who falls in love with her. He, too, is grieving a dead friend and recognizes that Durga is also lonely.

On the day of Raj and Durga's engagement, Raj is told that Rohit is alive and in a reclusive hospital where he has been in a coma for six months. Raj is reunited with Rohit, and they return to the house in time for the engagement celebrations. Rohit is shocked to discover that Raj's fiancée is his beloved Durga, but keeps this a secret.  Raj introduces Rohit to Durga, but Rohit purposely doesn't speak in front of her so as to avoid her recognizing his voice. Durga later overhears Rohit speak, recognizes his voice, and confronts him, wanting to be sure whether Rohit is really the man she loved. Rohit denies it, but Durga is not convinced. She calls Dr. Prasad, as he had met Rohit before Durga underwent surgery. The doctor tells her that Rohit is not her long lost love, but it turns out that the doctor was just following Rohit's instructions to lie to her. Durga finally accepts this and does not question Rohit anymore.  One night, the lights go out in Raj's home, and Durga and Rohit accidentally bump into each other. In the dark, Durga's hand goes up to feel Rohit's face, which she recognizes. Rohit flees, and Durga blindfolds herself and recreates the clay bust of her love, relying on memory alone. When it's completed, she looks at it and realizes that Rohit is the person she loves. Rohit confronts her, asking her whether it would be right to destroy Raj's happiness after all that he has been through. Durga reluctantly agrees that she cannot leave Raj, and they decide to keep the secret.  On the day of the wedding ceremony, Raj publicly confronts the pair, apparently in anger. He accuses Rohit of trying to steal Durga away from him. Rohit quietly accepts the accusation. However, Durga cannot remain silent and speaks up for her lover, exposing the truth of their past. It is then revealed that Raj's angry behavior was a ruse to make them reveal the truth. He gladly steps aside to reunite the lovers so they may be married, sharing their happiness as his own.

Hurricane on the Bayou
  The film begins in the bayou itself, as a family of alligators frolic in the water to the tune of the Cajun classic “Iko Iko". The story then sets off on an historical exploration of how New Orleans rose up hundreds of years ago out of an untamed swampland – and went on to become celebrated around the world as “The Big Easy", a place where a feeling of joyful freedom permeated the music, the food and the city’s inimitable talent for turning “good times” into an art form.  Here, a spicy gumbo of African, Native American, Cajun, Creole and Southern influences forged a completely unique culture. Louisiana’s coastal location (the state contains 40% of all the coastal wetlands in the continental U.S. according to the [[National Wetlands Research Center]]) was both a boon and a bane to the city.  New Orleans evolved into the busiest port in the U.S., but after engineers diverted the Mississippi River, depleting the wetlands, the city became increasingly vulnerable to the killer winds and rising waters of seasonal hurricanes.  Today, the situation grows more and more dangerous as every year Louisiana loses enough land to make up the island of Manhattan.  Setting out for the mystery-tinged bayous with Tab Benoit and Amanda Shaw, ''Hurricane on the Bayou'' reveals how in the last 50 years, the natural coastal buffer that once sheltered New Orleans from severe storms has drastically deteriorated, endangering many unique animal and plant species and leaving the city wide open to Mother Nature’s ferocious forces.  Spectacular flights over the Gulf of Mexico reveal the shocking reality that every half an hour, Louisiana loses a section of wetlands the size of a football field.  Meanwhile, a side-trip into the vibrant swamplands probes how the bayou provides a fragile home to a family of alligators with newborn babies.  Here, Tab Benoit explains that hope for New Orleans’ future will lie in concerted efforts to not only preserve but restore these wetlands by redirecting the Mississippi River’s silt and re-planting vital foliage.  Ultimately, the story builds to the monster storm that was Katrina and the crisis it brought to New Orleans, causing families to be separated, homes to be lost and one hundred square miles of wetlands and marshes to be destroyed by saltwater (including damaged caused by Hurricane Rita). Visceral, state-of-the-art CGI effects created by Hollywood specialists Sassoon Film Design recreates the fury of the storm, when fierce winds tore off the roof of the Superdome.   Then, haunting, never-before-seen 70mm footage of the storm’s aftermath provides a shocking reminder of just how vast the storm’s devastation really was.  Finally, returning to New Orleans in the bittersweet 2006 Mardi Gras season, the film reveals a city in the first throes of recovery – and reunites Allen Toussaint, Amanda Shaw, Chubby Carrier and Marva Wright for a passionate performance of a resonant modern hymn (written by the film’s composer Steve Wood) in the oldest Cathedral in North America, New Orleans’ elegant St. Louis Cathedral.<ref>{{cite news   | title = Hurricane on the Bayou   | publisher =  Greg MacGillivray   | date = 19 November 2006   | url = http://www.hurricaneonthebayou.com/logo.html   | accessdate = 2009-11-22}}</ref>

Their objective is a "ground control encoder" that locks out the controls and instruments in an aircraft, allowing remote control from the ground. In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], this device was designed to prevent hijacking but the rebels intend to use it to send an aircraft on a suicide mission.  With three airliners in the air as possible targets of the device, the terrorists send out a warning that they will not hesitate to kill all on board in their attacks on government facilities. Despite efforts to stop them, the terrorists crash the first jetliner into the Kudaram Base and destroy most of the aircraft and helicopters on the runways and taxiways.

I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer

(Clay Taylor) stage a prank at the town carnival. Roger impersonates the "Fisherman" killer, with the hook Roger says Ben Willis originally used. Afterward, they see everyone staring at P.J.'s body impaled on a pipe. The public believes the Fisherman to be behind it. Colby convinces his friends to burn the evidence and make a pact to keep it secret.  One year later, Amber returns to town to discover that Colby never left to pursue his scholarship. She goes up to the mountains where she encounters one of the officers who witnessed the accident, Deputy Haffner ([[K.C. Clyde]]). Later that night, Amber awakens to a sound, and receives 50 text messages reading "I know what you did last summer". She drives to Zoe's shack to find her band rehearsing for a concert. Zoe allows her to sleep there for the night. The next day they find Roger fixing ski-lift [[Gondola lift|gondolas]] and Colby working as a [[lifeguard]] at a public pool, but they angrily dismiss them when told about the messages. Amber is attacked on a ski-lift by someone wielding the hook, but Colby does not believe her.  Later that night, a drunken Roger contemplates [[suicide]] while pulling out the hook from the prank, which he had salvaged from the fire. When he investigates a noise, he is attacked by the Fisherman, who slits his throat after a chase. Colby goes to Amber and Zoe telling them that he believes them. They go to warn Roger and find him dead along with a [[suicide note]] and the hook. Deputy Haffner shows up, accusing them of the murder, until he reads the suicide note. After their statements, they return to Amber's house to find pictures of them from the [[high school]] yearbook sliced up and stuck to the wall reading "SOON". They all stay at Zoe's place again and find Lance ([[Ben Easter]]) outside, who shows them a message engraved on his motorbike. They agree to stay together for safety. Colby goes to the pool to do some laps after his shift, and is hooked in the ankle by the Fisherman, who disappears.  The night of Zoe's concert, Colby, now on crutches, sneaks off to get drunk. After Zoe's performance, Amber and Lance go back to congratulate her but are attacked. Zoe is stabbed in the stomach and then thrown over a balcony to her death. As Amber and Lance make their way up to the balcony to find Zoe's corpse, P.J's dad, the sheriff, comes in, only to be pulled into the darkness to his death. The Fisherman then attacks Colby in the kitchen, who grabs a [[butcher knife]] and stabs the Fisherman in the back, but he appears completely unharmed. Colby flees but the Fisherman breaks through a window and hooks him in the mouth. Outside, Deputy Haffner reveals that Roger told him about the accident, arrests Amber and Lance and escorts them to his jeep; in the back lies Zoe's body. The Fisherman advances towards Haffner, who shoots him several times, but the Fisherman does not budge and impales Haffner on a forklift.  Amber and Lance get into the car and run the fisherman down. He gets up, however, and reveals himself to be an undead Ben Willis, the man who committed the original murders 10 years ago. Willis then teleports to the car and attacks them, but is cut by a hook Amber was wielding, causing him to disappear. Amber and Lance go to face Willis, deducing that the hook might hurt him. They are again attacked by Willis and chased into a warehouse. In the fight that follows, Amber stabs Willis in the head with the hook and pushes him into a [[Threshing machine|thresher]], which apparently kills him.  A year later, Amber is driving across the desert, talking to Lance on the phone when a tire blows out. She stops the car, and loses phone reception. Willis appears behind her. The screen goes black as Amber's scream is cut off by the slicing sound of the hook.  
I Served the King of England (film)
 Jan Dítě has been released from a Czech prison just before the very end of his 15-year sentence and is settling in a town near the border between [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. He occupies his time with rebuilding a deserted house, and begins to recall his past, where he says that his main wish in life was to be a millionaire. Jan begins his career as a [[Frankfurter Sausage|frankfurter]] vendor at a railroad station, and quickly learns the power of money and the influence it exerts over people.  At one point during his reminiscences, a young woman, Marcela, and her older traveling companion, a professor, settle in the area. Jan and Marcela develop a mutual attraction, although it remains physically unconsumated. The film continues to alternate between past and present, as the relationship between the older Jan and the new neighbors develops.

He also gradually moves into more socially prestigious work settings, including a stint at a spa, the Hotel Tichota, where he has an affair with a maid there. Jan eventually finds employment in Prague at the Hotel Paříž, where he falls under the tutelage of the Maître d', Skřivánek, who claims that he once served the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of England]]. Eventually, Jan serves the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] at one occasion. The Emperor tries to award a medal to Skřivánek, but because he is short in height, cannot place the award around Skřivánek's neck. Jan is short enough for the Emperor to reach, and maneuvers into place to receive the medal in place of Skřivánek.  With the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexation of Czechoslovakia]] by the Third Reich, Jan falls in love with Liza, a young [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten German]] woman who worships [[Adolf Hitler]]. She agrees to marry him only after he proves that he is of pure [[Aryan race|Aryan]] descent through medical examination. During the occupation, the other waiters and the hotel manager, Brandejs, express their contempt for the German occupiers by trying to be as unhelpful in their service as possible.  Jan is the only member of the waitstaff not to express symbolic resistance in this manner. Brandejs dismisses Jan for this reason, and says that Jan will be blacklisted from employment in any Prague establishment. When Jan and Liza later appear as patrons, and after Jan mocks Skřivánek that serving the King of England has done him no good in life, Skřivánek pours food over Jan in protest. Eventually, Skřivánek is taken away by the occupying authorities and never seen again.  During [[World War II]], Jan works in an institute, formerly the Hotel Tichota, where German women reside to [[Lebensborn|breed a new "master race"]] with selected soldiers. Because the owner, Mr Tichota, uses a wheelchair, he has been displaced as its owner and is never seen again. In the meantime, Liza serves as a nurse on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]].  She returns with valuable stamps taken from the homes of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] families. As the war progresses and the tide turns against the German, the women are displaced from the facility, and wounded and amputee soldiers replace them.  Near the end of the war, the facility is attacked, and the soldiers and staff are evacuated. Liza tries to retrieve the stamps to use after the war, but dies when the roof of the hospital collapses. Jan finds Liza's body with her holding the box of stamps, and pries them from her hands. After the war, the stamps' value allows Jan to become a wealthy hotelier, in the same Hotel Tichota premises.  After the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communists]] take power in Czechoslovakia [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|in 1948]], Jan loses his property and wealth when he tells the Communist resistance that he himself is a millionaire. He is sentenced to prison for 15 years: one year for each million of his fortune. In prison, he sees that Brandejs and the other formerly wealthy customers are prisoners. Jan tries to sit among them, but they exclude him from their circle.  Marcela and the professor leave the area. Jan completes the restoration of his home and finally releases the stamps by letting the winds blow them into the valley.  
I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK
 The film takes place mostly in a [[mental institution]] filled with an eclectic menagerie of patients. Young-goon, a young woman working in a factory constructing radios and who believes herself to be a cyborg, is institutionalized after [[Self-harm|cutting her wrist]] and connecting it with a power cord to a wall outlet in an attempt to "recharge" herself, an act that is interpreted as a [[suicide attempt]]. Her delusion is characterized by refusing to eat (she instead licks batteries and attempts to administer electric shocks to herself), conversing almost solely with machines and electrical appliances and obsessively listening to her [[vacuum tube|tube]] [[radio]] at night for instruction on how to become a better cyborg. Her apathetic mother is interviewed by the institute's head doctor, to determine the roots of Young-goon's psychosis; despite claiming ignorance of her daughter's delusion (it is later learnt she knew but was too busy to make her seek help), she reveals that Young-goon's mentally ill grandmother had previously been institutionalized for delusions of being a mouse, a trauma that sparks Young-goon's own lapses from reality. As a result, she frequently fantasizes of finding her grandmother and seeking revenge on the "men in white" who took her away.  Il-soon, a young male patient hospitalized for [[anti-social behavior]] and [[kleptomania]] (stemming from [[schizophrenia]]) becomes fascinated with Young-goon; he is described as having "no sympathy" for his fellow man, believes he can "steal" other people's souls/attributes, and frequently wears handmade rabbit masks. He fears that he will eventually "shrink into a dot" and is seen compulsively brushing his teeth when nervous or upset. His habit of covertly taking the traits of his fellow inmates makes him the frequent target of scorn, but he only takes the traits willingly and returns them to their owners after he is done.  When Young-goon persuades Il-soon to take away her "sympathy" in order for her to be able to kill the men in white, she has a hallucination of going on a rampage, slaughtering the doctors and orderlies of the hospital. When she is given shock treatment owing to her refusal to eat, she believes that she has been recharged. In reality, her physical condition begins to deteriorate rapidly, and the doctors begin force-feeding her to keep her alive. Il-soon, now wracked with sympathy for Young-goon, hatches an elaborate plan to get Young-goon to eat, convincing her that he can install a food-to-electrical-energy conversion unit (a "rice-megatron", as he calls it) in her back. After eating her first meal at the hospital, and confiding her secrets to the head doctor, Young-goon ponders the meaning of a recurring dream in which her grandmother explains to her the purpose of her existence. Interpreting the lip-read message as that she is in fact a "nuke bomb" that requires a bolt of lightning to detonate, she goes out into a horrendous storm with Il-soon, intending to use her radio's antenna as a lightning rod.  In the middle of the storm, the wind blows their tent away, prompting them to hastily protect their food supplies. Il-soon, hearing Young-goon's complaints about the opened wine collecting rain, plugs it with his little finger. Unknown to Young-goon, it is shown Il-soon placed the missing cork atop the makeshift lightning rod, protecting her from lightning; similarly to using the 'rice megatron' to make her eat, Il-soon did so to protect her without discouraging. Sitting together as the sun rises, the duo soon embrace under a rainbow.

Ice Age: The Meltdown
 In the opening scene, [[Scrat]], the saber-toothed squirrel climbs a [[glacier]] to bury his acorn, but accidentally opens a hole in it, causing water to spurt out. The world of ice is slowly melting. The creatures of the Ice Age are all shown enjoying themselves on slides and pools made by the melting ice; among them the three protagonists of the [[Ice Age (2002 film)|first film]]: [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manny]] the [[woolly mammoth]], [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]] the [[Megalonyx|ground sloth]], and [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]] the [[Smilodon|saber-toothed cat]]. Sid opens a small day camp, where none of the younger creatures take him seriously, nor do Manny and Diego, which leaves Sid seeking a daring deed. [[List of Ice Age characters#Fast Tony|Fast Tony]] the [[giant armadillo]], a local [[con artist]] is claiming that the earth will [[flood]] and that the bark and reeds which he sells are needed to stay alive.  Manny dismisses the idea, but is distracted when he sees that Sid will try to high dive from a giant waterfall known as "the Eviscerator"; as Manny goes with Diego to the top of the Eviscerator to save Sid from his act of daredevilry, suddenly the ice under Diego's feet begins breaking, causing him to bolt in fear, this also made Sid figure out that Diego is afraid of the water. The Herd figure that the pleasant weather has caused the ice shelves to melt, and it is kept from destroying the valley only by the [[glaciers]], which have formed a dam.  A lone vulture warns the animals that a giant tree can act as a boat and save them if they make it to the end of the valley within three days time, and all soon set out to find it. As the animals begin their journey, Sid teases Manny about Mammoths being "extinct". During the evacuation, a glacier which contains two sea reptiles from the [[Mesozoic]] era, [[Cretaceous (Ice Age)|Cretaceous]] a ''[[Cymbospondylus]]'' and [[Maelstrom (Ice Age)|Maelstrom]] a ''[[Pliosauroidea]]'', breaks off.  When Manny is briefly separated from them, Diego and Sid encounter two mischievous [[opossums]] named [[List of characters#Crash and Eddie|Crash and Eddie]] who drive them nuts by playing [[Whac-A-Mole]] with them. Manny is still worried about being the [[Endling|last]] [[mammoth]] alive and his family, who had been killed by humans, but is surprised when he encounters [[List of Ice Age characters#Ellie|Ellie]], a female woolly mammoth who believes she is an [[opossum]] and Crash and Eddie's adoptive sister. Sid invites her to tag along with the group to escape the flood, and she brings her brothers. After a dangerous encounter with Cretaceous and Maelstrom while crossing a pond, Sid prompts Diego to encourage him to admit and face his fears - Diego insists that "fear is for prey", so Sid points out that Diego is behaving as if he is the water's prey. They discover an area which Ellie recalls as the place where she was adopted. She finally realizes she is a mammoth and also expresses her suspicions about how different she was from other opossums. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests "saving their species".  Ellie and Manny ultimately make up when they must co-operate to save the group when the ground cracks under their feet. Sid is kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths who believe Sid to be a god. Sid lights a fire for them, and believes that he has finally found respect, but they plan to sacrifice him by tossing him into a [[volcano]]; Sid narrowly escapes. The next morning, Sid tells the others his experience but none are convinced. After being harassed by vultures, the group finds the boat behind a field of hot geysers, which separates Manny, Sid and Diego from Ellie and her brothers when they argue about which way's safest to go through.  When the flood comes, Manny saves Ellie from drowning as she is caught in a cave (due to falling rocks), while Diego overcomes his [[Aquaphobia|fear of water]] to save Sid, Crash and Eddie from drowning.  Cretaceous and Maelstrom arrive, but due to Manny's quick thinking, they are finished off by a rock which falls on them, killing them both. The other animals are at the mercy of the water currents. Meanwhile, Scrat climbs up the glacier and at the top sticks the acorn he has into the ice. This forms a crack in the glacier, which widens into a [[fissure]], diverting the flood and saving the animals in the valley; Scrat is then washed away. In the final scene, a herd of mammoths show up, proving mammoths aren't extinct. But Manny and Ellie decide to remain together anyway, taking Sid, Diego and the [[opossum]] brothers along. Sid encounters the mini-sloths again - they believe Sid stopped the flood and invite him to be their leader.  Diego, surprised to see the mini-sloths are real, convinces Sid to stay with the others, admitting that Sid is a vital part of their 'herd'.  The [[epilogue]] shows Scrat having a [[near death experience]] after falling into the fissure. He enters a [[heaven]] full of acorns. Suddenly, he finds himself torn away. He unhappily wakes up, having been resuscitated by Sid, who he proceeds to viciously attack.  
Idiocracy
 In 2005, [[United States Army]] librarian, Corporal "Average Joe" Bauers, is selected for a [[suspended animation]] experiment on grounds of average appearance, intelligence, behavior, etc. Lacking a suitable female candidate, they hire Rita, a prostitute whose pimp "Upgrayedd" has been bribed to allow her to take part. The experiment is forgotten when the officer in charge is arrested for having started his own prostitution ring under Upgrayedd's tutelage. Over the next five centuries, the expectations of 21st-century society ensure that the most intelligent humans [[Voluntary childlessness|fail to have children]], while the least intelligent [[dysgenics|reproduce prolifically]], which, through the process of [[natural selection]], creates generations that collectively become increasingly dumber and more virile with each passing century. In 2505, Joe and Rita's suspension chambers are unearthed by the collapse of a mountain-sized garbage pile, and Joe's suspension chamber crashes into the apartment of Frito Pendejo, who expels him.  The former Washington, D.C. has lost most of its infrastructure, with people living in plastic huts called "domistiles". The human population has become morbidly stupid, speaks only low [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of English competently, is profoundly [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectual]], and individuals are named after corporate products. Suspecting hallucination, Joe enters a hospital, where he is incompetently diagnosed, and comes to realize what has happened to him and to society. He is arrested for not having a bar code tattoo to pay for his doctor's appointment, and after being assigned the grossly incompetent Frito as his lawyer, he is sent to prison. Rita returns to her former profession.  Joe is renamed "Not Sure" by a faulty tattooing machine, and takes an IQ test before tricking the guards into letting him escape. Once free, Joe asks Frito whether a time machine exists to return him to 2005, and bribes him with promises of riches through compound interest on a bank account Joe will open in the 21st century. Frito claims he knows of one, and leads him with Rita to a gigantic [[Costco]] store, where a tattoo scanner identifies Joe. He is apprehended, but is taken to the [[White House]], where he is appointed Secretary of the Interior, on the grounds that his IQ test identified him as the most intelligent person alive.  In a speech, President Camacho gives Joe the impossible job of fixing the nation's [[Famine|food shortages]], [[Dust Bowl]]s, and crippled economy within a week. Joe discovers that the nation's crops are irrigated with a [[sports drink]] named "Brawndo", whose parent corporation had purchased the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], and [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. When Joe has the drink replaced with water, Brawndo's stock drops to zero, and half of the population lose their jobs, causing mass riots. Joe is sentenced to die in a [[monster truck]] [[demolition derby]] featuring undefeated "Rehabilitation Officer" Beef Supreme.  Frito and Rita discover that Joe's reintroduction of water to the soil has prompted vegetation to grow in the fields. During the televised event they show the sprouting crops on the stadium's display screen, and Camacho gives Joe a full pardon, appointing him Vice President. Joe and Rita find that the "time masheen" Frito had mentioned is merely an inaccurate, history-themed amusement ride. Following Camacho's term, Joe is elected President. Joe and Rita marry and conceive the world's three smartest children, while Vice President Frito takes eight wives and fathers 32 of the world's stupidest children.

  In [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 1889, a magician named Eisenheim is arrested by Chief Inspector Walter Uhl of the Vienna Police during a magic show involving [[necromancy]]. Later, Uhl explains the story of Eisenheim's life to Crown Prince Leopold.  Eisenheim was born to a cabinet-maker and became interested in magic after meeting a travelling magician. He also fell in love with Sophie, the [[Duchy of Teschen|Duchess von Teschen]], but the two were forbidden to see each other on account of the former being a peasant. They kept meeting secretly but were caught one day and separated by force. Eisenheim proceeded to study magic by travelling the world, and fifteen years later returned to Vienna to perform. During one performance, he encounters the adult Sophie and learns that she is expected to marry the Crown Prince Leopold, who, it is rumored, is brutal towards women and in the past even murdered one. Eisenheim conducts a private show for the Crown Prince and humiliates him in the course of it. In response, he is banned from performing again in Vienna. Eisenheim asks Sophie to flee with him, but Sophie is afraid that they will be executed. Sophie also reveals that the Crown Prince is planning a ''[[coup d'etat]]'' against his elderly father, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].  At the [[Mayerling]] hunting lodge, Sophie tries to end her engagement with Leopold. He reacts by chasing her into the stables with a sword, in full view of the servants. Sophie's body is discovered the next morning in the [[Vienna Woods]], an unknown man blamed for her assassination. This throws Eisenheim into a deep depression. He eventually buys a theatre and begins a new series of magic shows, this time focusing exclusively on the summoning of dead spirits. Leopold secretly attends one of them, during which Eisenheim summons the spirit of Sophie, who says that someone in the theater is her murderer. Leopold, highly unnerved, orders Uhl to arrest Eisenheim for fraud, but Eisenheim manages to avoid jail by openly confessing to the public that his show is a mere illusion.  Eisenheim is threatened that if he summons Sophie in his next performance, he will be arrested and likely imprisoned. Uhl attends the packed performance with dozens of officers, and in spite of the warnings, Eisenheim brings Sophie's spirit to life again. Uhl storms the stage with his officers, but to the shock and horror of the audience, Eisenheim is revealed to be a spirit after Uhl's hand passes through him. Eisenheim then fades away in front of everyone.  Uhl reveals to Leopold that he has found evidence - a jewel from Leopold's sword and Sophie's distinctive locket - which could implicate Leopold in Sophie's murder. Uhl has already informed the Emperor and the [[General Staff]] of Leopold's conspiracy to seize the throne. Leopold points a [[revolver]] at Uhl, threatening to kill him, but as officers of the imperial guard of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] arrive, Leopold shoots himself in the head. Later, as Uhl leaves the palace, he places Sophie's locket in his pocket. He is now no longer Chief Inspector of Police. As a boy approaches him, he is jostled by a bearded man in a long coat. The boy gives him a package containing Eisenheim's notebook about the Orange Tree trick, which Uhl had been unable to figure out. He asks the boy who gave him the notebook and the boy replies "Herr Eisenheim."  He checks his pocket and realizes the person who jostled him stole the locket. He sees the man and chases after him, but the man boards a train and escapes. Uhl realizes the jostling and the notebook are a message from the illusionist, and begins to rethink recent events. He concludes that Sophie and Eisenheim staged her death so that she could be free of Leopold. Uhl laughs delightedly at the brilliance of their plan. Later, and far away, Sophie and Eisenheim start a new life together in a cabin at the foot of a beautiful mountain. Eisenheim places Sophie's locket in her palm.

Twenty-five years pass, and Pulikecei is now the king of Cholapuram Paalayam. As foretold, he is foolish as well as lecherous. He is a puppet in the hands of Sangilimayan, who collaborates with the British for his own personal gain, and does not attend to the needs of the people of his kingdom. Pulikecei also tortures his subjects. He creates an outdoor stadium for different castes to fight against each other and punishes his palace guards even when they make the slightest of mistakes; he also uses his guards as targets for shooting practice. Ukraputhan, now an educated revolutionary, collaborates with his friends to overthrow the British. Ukraputhan falls in love with Vasantha Sundari, who reciprocates his feelings. When Ukraputhan tries to kill Pulikecei, he is shocked to see that they look alike.  Ukraputhan then learns about his birth from his foster-parents. To save the land from Sangilimayan and the British, Ukraputhan captures Pulikecei and trades places with him as the king whilst sending Pulikecei to prison. As the king, Ukraputhan joins Agandamuthu, the commander-in-chief, and helps brings about new reforms. He converts the palace harem into a playground and helps fund and provide for the education of children; to grow crops, he creates fertile land for tilling the soil. In a break with past policies of the kingdom, Ukraputhan refuses to pay tributes and taxes demanded by the British. Bhavani Ammaiyar praises Ukraputhan's reforms, unaware that Ukraputhan is disguised as Pulikecei. In jail, Pulikecei is taken care of by Soolayini, who provides refreshments to the soldiers. Eventually, the two fall in love.  All of this happens while Sangilimayan is away on a business trip visiting British officers in [[Chennai]]pattinam. When he learns of the new reforms, he confronts Ukraputhan, who defies him. Later, Pulikecei escapes from prison and overhears a conversation between Ukraputhan, Agandamuthu and Chinnavadayaan. Pulikecei learns the truth about his birth and confronts the trio. He joins forces with Ukraputhan to reform the kingdom, but is beaten by one of Sangilimayan's men and is locked up in the palace. However, he escapes with the help of Kollan, the palace blacksmith. Believing that Agandamuthu was responsible for Pulikecei's change of mind, Sangilimayan arrests him and Ukraputhan. After escaping, Pulikecei appears before Sangilimayan as Ukraputhan but is recognised by his minister, Mangunipandiyan. A fight between Ukraputhan, Pulikecei, Sangilimayan and the British follows; Sangilimayan is overpowered by the twins and is about to be killed when Bhavani Ammaiyar intervenes. Feeling guilty for betraying his kingdom, Sangilimayan has a change of heart and apologises to his sister; she forgives him. The kingdom attains independence from British rule and Pulikecei and Ukraputhan get married to their respective lovers, Soolayini and Vasantha Sundari.  
In a Dark Place
 Anna Veigh is an [[art teacher]] that seems to get too involved in her students' private lives. She is called into the [[headmaster]]'s [[office]] and chastised for (once again) attempting to be an "art therapist" rather than an art teacher. The headmaster makes inappropriate advances, touching her leg and putting his arm around her as he informs her that she is on "the wrong track". Later, the headmaster calls and leaves a message on her answering machine in which we find that she has been fired and something has occurred in the office that he wishes to "keep secret". He informs her that he has found her a job as a nanny that pays very well.  The next day she attends an interview for the job and is hired on the spot by the wealthy and mysterious Mr. Laing to become the nanny for his niece and nephew — two wealthy young orphans — whilst he is away on business. It seems a perfect escape for her, a welcome change.  Her new workplace is Bly House, a remote country estate with beautiful grounds and a small resident staff. Miles and Flora, the children, seem sweet and charming, if a little strange, and Anna thinks that she has really "landed on her feet" after the rigors of her previous job. The only fly in the ointment is the frosty estate manager, Miss Grose, who seems remote and unfriendly to the new arrival.  Anna soon begins to make disquieting discoveries. Miles, the boy, has been expelled from his school, for a sin so dreadful the headmaster will not even discuss it. Anna hears whispers through the night often leading towards Flora's bedroom. Anna then learns that her predecessor in the job, one Miss Jessel, drowned in a lake on the property. Her lover, Mr. Quint, hanged himself in Bly House shortly thereafter. The children continue to commit devilish seeming acts, that lead her to question the children. To add to her unease, Anna begins to catch glimpses of unknown sinister figures lurking in the grounds, but nobody else admits to seeing them.  Anna confronts Miss Grose with her suspicions about the intruders and is surprised to learn that Miss Grose had hated Mr. Quint for stealing her lesbian lover, Miss Jessel. The figures Anna describes are unmistakably Miss Jessel and Mr. Quint, but these former employees have been dead for some time. Anna has recurring daydreams concerning her own abuse as a child, and she soon suspects that Mr. Quint and Miss Jessel may have physically abused Miles and Flora as well.  As Anna's ghost sightings and fears for the children's safety become more pronounced, Miss Grose begins to doubt Anna's sanity and fires her from her post. As Anna reveals some affection for the estate manager, Miss Grose reconsiders and begins to passionately kiss Anna. While they later sleep together that evening, it is apparent on Anna's face that she is shocked by the estate manager's physical attention and feels that she is again being abused just as when she was a child.  It seems as if Anna is being sexually abused by every character in the movie, highlighting her disturbing childhood.  Eventually, the children grow more and more fearful and sullen around Anna. Anna's hallucinations about having multiple three sums and four sums and therefore emotional breakdown continue, and Miss Grose once again tells her to leave. Anna frequently visits the lake that Miss Jessel had supposedly drowned in, yet tells the children not to go there.  She seems possessed and has frequent sightings of Miss Jessel there. After some strange behaviour on the children's part and Anna's, it is unclear what exactly is going on.  That evening, Flora has a severe fear-induced [[asthma]] attack and is taken away by ambulance, never to be seen again. Miles runs away, and before accompanying Flora to the hospital, Miss Grose makes Anna promise to call her as soon as Miles is found.  Anna finds and chases the frightened Miles around the estate believing that only she can rescue him from the ghosts' attentions. As she corners him at the lake where Miss Jessel drowned, Miles in a sense "walks the plank", slowly forcing himself into the water and drops from the log into the shallow creek-like puddle where Miss Jessel's previous body parts had been shown. There is no struggle and he drowns. Anna tells him that he will now be free of his suffering and that what happened between them will remain a secret. It is suggested that Anna had been physically abusing Miles and Flora just as she had been abused as a child herself, but the truth is no one really knows, if she is insane and imagining these images or being harassed by ghostly figures.  Then without any real explanation or even implication, her face suddenly turns into herself as a little girl and says "I'm the only one."  We are left questioning if her mind was in fact the "dark place" or if in fact the house was truly haunted.  
Impy's Island
 On a magical tropical island called Tikiwoo in the 1950s, a fun-loving group of misfit animals and people make a marvelous discovery: a baby dinosaur frozen since prehistoric times. Little Impy, as they call him, is loving his new family and ready to explore the strange new world. but when a king from a faraway country vows to capture the lovable baby dino for his private collection, all the inhabitants of Impy's island must join together to save their new friend.  
In Between Days (film)
  Much of the film's focus is on the relationship of Aimie, a teenage Korean immigrant in North America, and her best friend, Tran. Each is ambivalent about romantic feelings for the other and communicate through indirect means of hoping the other can read their mind, often followed by passive-aggressive tactics when such indirect communication inevitably leads to disappointment.  Subplots concern Aimie's strained relationship with her mother, the absence of her father, and her increasing loneliness and isolation as she drifts apart from Tran.  
In Her Line of Fire
  'Air Force Two', the aeroplane carrying the [[Vice-President of the United States]] and his staff, is flying over the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], when it is damaged by an electrical storm. It's forced to ditch in the ocean off the coast of the (fictional) country of San Pietro, located near the [[Solomon Islands]].   As the few survivors make it onto a beach of a small off-shore island, one is immediately shot dead by a sniper from a [[guerrilla]] camp. The remaining survivors, including the Vice-President, who is a former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]], manage to escape and hide. It emerges that the sniper belongs to a group of armed rebel forces intent on overthrowing the island's dictatorial government. The rebels are led by Armstrong, a ruthless American [[mercenary]].  The Vice-President is eventually caught by the rebels, who plan to hold him for ransom. It falls to his two aides, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Lynn Delaney (Hemingway) and press secretary Sharon Serrano to infiltrate the rebel camp and save him. They are also captured, but Delaney is able to escape and sets out to rescue the others.  As US helicopters search for them, Delaney's military and combat skills enable her to rescue them and kill Armstrong.   In return for the V-P's rescue and the cooperation of some of the rebel forces, the US offers aid to San Pietro on condition that they agree to hold democratic elections.  
Inland Empire (film)
 The film opens to the sound of a [[Phonograph|gramophone]] playing ''Axxon N.'', "the longest-running radio play in history". Meanwhile, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the "Lost Girl", cries while watching television in a hotel room, following an unpleasant encounter with her client. The Lost Girl’s television displays a family of [[Rabbits (film)|surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits]] who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are [[laugh track]] responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout ''Inland Empire''.  The main plot follows an actress named Nikki Grace ([[Laura Dern]]), who has applied for a comeback role as a character named Sue in a film entitled ''On High in Blue Tomorrows''. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman ([[Grace Zabriskie]]) claiming to be her neighbor; she predicts that Nikki will get the role, and recounts two folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, "caused evil to be born". The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, "discovers a palace". The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. Disregarding Nikki's offended response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbor is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler ([[Ian Abercrombie]]) walks into the living room with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek ([[Peter J. Lucas]]) ominously surveys them from atop a nearby staircase.  Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk ([[Justin Theroux]]) receive an interview on a talk show. The host ([[Diane Ladd]]) asks them both whether they are having an affair, to which each of them responds negatively. Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds, due to her husband's power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director, Kingsley Stewart ([[Jeremy Irons]]). They are interrupted by a disturbance, but upon investigation Devon finds nothing. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled ''47''. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.  Immersed in her character, while the film is being shot, "Sue" / Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon / "Billy". A strange scene follows based on what the old woman had described: Nikki appears in a mysterious alley walking to her car, carrying a bag of groceries, but then she notices a door in the alley marked ''Axxon N.'', and enters. It leads her back to the soundstage where the earlier rehearsal took place. She witnesses that rehearsal from across the room—she herself was what had interrupted it earlier. This time, when Devon seeks to discover who's observing them, she disappears from the rehearsal scene, and flees among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of a character named Smithy. Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness, not hearing her frantic cries of his character's name, "Billy".  At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband (whether it's "Smithy" or Piotrek is unclear) in bed. Hiding from him, she enters a different room and encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings, many of which seem to revolve around her, or alternate versions of herself.  Prior to these scenes, the woman who plays Billy’s wife Doris ([[Julia Ormond]]) tells a policeman that she had been hypnotized to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from [[Inland Empire]]. A parallel plotline involves Polish circus artists in the present day, as well as Polish prostitutes in [[Łódź]] during the 1930s, who are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, "Who is she?" Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them and "say whether you've known me before". In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver long monologues to an unidentified man touching upon her [[Child sexual abuse|childhood sexual abuse]], disastrous relationships, and retaliations. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization, and then is hired by a circus from Poland because he is said to be "good with animals". There is much talk of the Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced she's being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver.  Finally, Sue walks down [[Hollywood Boulevard]], and is startled to see her doppelgänger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of [[Hollywood and Vine]]. One woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to [[Pomona, California|Pomona]]. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko, a prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The older woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face until she finally dies, promising her "no more blue tomorrows". Off-camera, Kingsley yells "Cut!" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.  As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only ''On High in Blue Tomorrows''—encompassing some of the subplots of the film—but events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked "Axxon N.". Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be the Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki's own face, and then an even more distorted face bleeding from its mouth.  Nikki flees into a nearby room—Room 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds the Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces a man and child.  Nikki is then seen back home, smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them [[Laura Harring]], [[Nastassja Kinski]], and [[Ben Harper]]. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue's monologue looks around and says, "Sweet!" Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to [[Nina Simone]]'s "[[Sinner Man]]" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat.  
Infamous (film)
 [[Truman Capote]], known in [[New York City]] society for his wit and fashion flair as much as he is recognized in literary circles as the celebrated writer of ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]'' and ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', reads a brief article about the murder of a farming family in [[Holcomb, Kansas]], in the back pages of the ''[[New York Times]]'' of November 16, 1959.  Curious as to how the residents would react to a brutal massacre in their midst, the author and his friend, [[Nelle Harper Lee]] (Sandra Bullock), who has just published her novel ''[[To Kill A Mockingbird]]'', travel from New York to the rural Midwestern town, ostensibly so Capote can interview people for a magazine article. Once there, he realizes there might be enough material for what he eventually describes as a [[nonfiction novel]].  Capote's dress and demeanor both amuse and dismay law enforcement officials. He allows the less ostentatious Lee to act as a buffer between himself and those whose trust he needs to gain in order to obtain as much background information as possible.  The [[Kansas Bureau of Investigation]]'s lead detective on the case, [[Alvin Dewey]] ([[Jeff Daniels]]), has refused to cooperate with the writer. But when his starstruck wife Marie meets Capote in a grocery store, she invites him and Lee to Christmas dinner. He eventually wins over his host with personal anecdotes about [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[John Huston]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and the like.  As a result, when ex-convicts [[Richard Hickock]] (Lee Pace) and [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]] (Daniel Craig) are apprehended in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] and extradited to Holcomb, permission is given to Capote to interview them in their cells. The two men are tried and found guilty, but a lengthy period of [[appeal]]s begins. Capote's society and literary friends like [[Slim Keith]] and [[Babe Paley]] in New York press him for juicy gossip about the case and inquire when they can expect to read the book.  Capote forms an attachment to Smith. He empathizes with the convicted killer's unhappy childhood, and Smith's remorseful manner, genuine sincerity, and obvious intelligence impress him. The criminal's reciprocal feelings become evident, although Smith has difficulty dealing with his emotions. As soon as Smith learns that Truman plans to title his book ''In Cold Blood'', which suggests the author thinks of him only as a merciless killer, he violently subdues Capote and nearly rapes him.  Smith steadfastly refuses to describe the night of the murders. This greatly angers Capote, who wants to hear details not only as a writer in search of the truth but as someone who finds it difficult to believe a loved one could be guilty of such a crime. Smith eventually acquiesces and discusses what transpired.  Capote then finds himself entangled in a personal and professional dilemma. As much as he wants Smith to be sentenced to life in prison, a death by hanging would provide a far more sensational ending for readers of his book. He begins to unravel psychologically as the legal appeals drag on, unable to complete his book without an ending.  Years go by. Hickock and Smith finally exhaust all their options; they now ask that Capote be present at their April 14, 1965 execution. He complies reluctantly with their request. Afterward he learns Smith bequeathed his meager belongings to him, and among them he finds a charcoal sketch of him the killer had drawn.  
The Initiation of Sarah (2006 film)
 Twin sisters Sarah ([[Mika Boorem]]) and Lindsay ([[Summer Glau]]) are excited to attend Temple Hill University, where they will likely join Alpha Nu as their mother Trina Goodwin ([[Morgan Fairchild]]) was a [[Legacy preferences|previous member]]. Sarah finds herself immediately drawn to Finn, a student adviser that invites them both to Pi Epsilon Delta's [[Rush week#Joining|rush week party]]. At the party the sisters are introduced to the Alpha Nu President, Corrine ([[Joanna Garcia]]), but Sarah ends up leaving the party in tears after accidentally spilling a drink on Corrine. Lindsay follows Sarah and accidentally breaks her ankle. They're brought into the Pi Epsilon Delta house, where Dr. Eugenia Hunter ([[Jennifer Tilly]]) introduces herself as a friend of their mother. The sisters are surprised to find that Lindsay's ankle has been healed. The following day Corrine ingratiates herself to Lindsay during a meeting at Alpha Nu, during which time Corrine takes the opportunity to take an eyelash off of Lindsay and pocket it.  Sarah is approached by Dr. Hunter, who tells Sarah that they both possess magical powers. This unnerves Sarah, especially after Dr. Hunter later tells her that the Pi Epsilon Deltas and the Alpha Nus are mortal enemies locked in a fight of good against evil, and that Sarah is the One- a person who could disrupt the balance. Sarah is further warned that as the One, the Alpha Nu wants to sacrifice her to the Eternal Flame with the Knife of Truth in exchange for immortality.  Sarah tries to approach her sister with this, who angrily tells her that Sarah has always been the focus of attention as opposed to Lindsay herself and Lindsay ends up leaving in tears. After Corrine's vice-president Esme ([[Tessa Thompson]]) informs her of the fight, Corrine uses this to persuade Lindsay into joining the sorority in return for beauty and a chance to outshine her sister - an offer Lindsay eagerly accepts.  Things grow more tense after Lindsay is forced to stay in the Pi Epsilon Delta following a fire and after making up with Finn, Sarah discovers that Trina Goodwin is not her true mother and that Trina actually killed their birth mother after a failed ritual. The Alpha Nus had believed her to be the One, which had been proven to be false after the Knife of Truth refused to cut her, as it will only cut the flesh of the One. Sarah also learns that the Alpha Nus are willing to kill her if they can't have her, which prompts her to try to rescue her sister from their clutches. She initially seems to be successful, as Lindsay appears to want to leave the group, but this is soon revealed to be a trap to capture Sarah and force her into sacrificing herself willingly. However everyone is shocked when a struggle reveals that the true One is actually Lindsay rather than Sarah, as the Knife of Truth ends up nicking her throat. They also find that the Knife can cut through anything if it has the blood of the One on it.  Corrine immediately imprisons Lindsay in preparation for her initiation into the sorority and kills Trina Goodwin, as she is no longer of any use to Corrine. Sarah escapes with Finn and the two end up having sex in order to keep him from being sacrificed in a ceremony where the Alpha Nus will throw virgins into their Eternal Flame to keep it burning. Sarah and Lindsay are both initiated into their respective houses (Sarah into Pi Epsilon Delta, Lindsay into Alpha Nu) and Lindsay is horrified when she discovers that the Alpha Nus are intent on sacrificing her. Sarah manages to successfully rescue her sister, almost dying in the process, and after a struggle pushes Corrine into the Eternal Flame. After they return to the Pi Epsilon Delta house, Dr. Hunter uses Lindsay's inner power to heal her and the film ends with Esme walking off with a little bit of the Eternal Fire in a small [[cauldron]].  
Incubus (2006 film)
 Seeking refuge from a torrential storm, Jay, her brother, and three friends break into what they think is an abandoned recycling plant. (A fourth friend, Karen, decides not to enter the building and leaves.) They find two dead people, who appear to have killed each other, and a Sleeper – a coma patient hooked up to life support in a triple-locked, shatterproof observation room. Closer examination reveals a disturbing truth: the Sleeper is Orin Kiefer, a murderer executed by lethal injection six years earlier.  Jay, her brother and friends search for a way out of the factory. A psychopathic man roaming the building attacks and kills her brother.  When Peter falls asleep, his dreams are invaded and his mind is controlled by the comatose madman. The madman turns Peter into a deranged killer like himself, and he tries to attack Jay and the remaining friends, but they make it safely to the observation room and try to sort the situation out.  They discover that the Sleeper in the locked room possesses the power of an [[Incubus]] demon, and can invade and control another human's mind through their dreams. To test this theory, they tell Holly to go to sleep. She is the weakest of the three, and if she is infected like Peter she can at least be tied up and easily kept under control without being hurt. She agrees and eventually falls asleep.  Jay and Bug wait, not expecting anything to happen. After a few minutes, Holly wakes up and tries to attack Bug and Jay. They try to get her to snap out of the spell of the Incubus, but when they fail they realize that the only way to stop her is to kill her, which they do. Angry, disgusted, and scared, Bug turns and attacks the comatose madman, still peacefully sleeping and dreaming. He rips off the machinery that keeps him in his unconscious state. Bug and Jay run to get out of the factory.  Peter is still waiting for them, and Bug quickly attacks him with a hammer. As he dies, Peter reveals that he is no longer under the control of the Incubus. As it turns out, the reason he is no longer psychotic is that the Incubus is no longer asleep. Because the machinery keeping him comatose was destroyed, he was able to free himself, wake up, and kill. He kills Bug by snapping his neck, and then goes after Jay.  Jay tricks the Incubus by making it look as though she has managed to escape onto the factory's roof. After she kills him she makes the mistake of falling asleep and dreams of the Incubus. In the dream he manages to get inside of her and when she wakes up she is delirious.  As sheriffs arrive on the scene, they discover the dead Incubus and the bloody Jay. They wrongly assume she is a killer, though she does not say a single word. She is led into a police car, in handcuffs, past Karen, who is in another police car. The movie ends with a brief shot of Jay's eyes, which suddenly exhibit an alarming expression revealing that she has become a psychopathic killer, possessed by the Incubus.

Inside Man
 A man named Dalton Russell sits in an unidentified cell and narrates a story of how he has committed the perfect robbery. In New York, masked robbers, dressed as painters and using variants of the name "Steve" as aliases, seize control of a Manhattan bank and take the patrons and employees hostage. They divide the hostages into groups and hold them in different rooms, forcing them to don painters clothes identical to their own. The robbers rotate the hostages among various rooms and occasionally insert themselves covertly into the groups. They also take turns working on an unspecified project involving demolishing the floor in one of the bank's storage rooms.  Police surround the bank and Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell take charge of the negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food and the police supply them with pizzas whose boxes include listening devices. The bugs pick up a language which the police identify as [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. They discover, however, that the conversations are in fact propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian communist dictator [[Enver Hoxha]], implying that the robbers anticipated the attempted surveillance.  When Arthur Case, chairman of the board of directors and founder of the bank, hears of the robbery taking place, he hires "fixer" Madeleine White to try to protect the contents of his [[safe deposit box]] within the bank. White arranges a conversation with Russell, who allows her to enter the bank and inspect the contents of the box, which include documents from [[Nazi Germany]]. Russell implies that Case started his bank with money that he received from the Nazis for unspecified services, resulting in the deaths of many Jewish people during [[World War II]]. White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum if he destroys the contents of the box.  Frazier demands to inspect the hostages before allowing the robbers to leave and Russell takes him on a tour of the bank. As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another of the robbers. Afterwards he explains that he deliberately tried to provoke Russell and judges that the man is not a killer. However, this is disproven when the robbers execute one of the hostages.  The execution prompts the ESU team into action. They plan to storm the bank and use rubber bullets to knock out those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props for faking the execution, but no money or valuables appear to have been stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.  Frazier, however, searches the bank's records and finds that safe deposit box number 392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording of an incriminating conversation that she had with him. White confronts Case who admits that the box contained diamonds and a ring that he had taken from a Jewish friend whom he had betrayed to the Nazis.  Russell repeats his opening monologue, but with the revelation that he is in fact hiding behind a fake wall the robbers had constructed inside the bank's supply room. He emerges a week after the robbery with the contents of Case's safe deposit box, including incriminating documents and several bags of diamonds. On his way out, he bumps into Frazier, who does not recognize him. When Frazier opens the safe deposit box, he finds the ring and a note from Russell. Frazier confronts Case and urges White to contact the [[Office of War Crimes Issues]] at the State Department about Case's war crimes. At home, Frazier finds a loose diamond, slipped into his pocket by Russell.  
Invincible (2006 film)
  During the 1970s, chaos reigns in the city of [[Philadelphia]] as southern portions of the city protest the shutdown of several job sites while their NFL team, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], endures a string of losing seasons, along with irate fans.  In 1976, [[Vince Papale]] goes to a sandlot one night and joins his friends playing a [[pick-up game|pick–up]] football game against another group of young men. After the game ends, Papale goes home and finds out that his wife Sharon is disgusted with his alleged failure to provide proper support.  The next morning, Papale goes to the high school where he works as a substitute teacher. In a short, unexpected meeting with the principal, he is told of his layoff. Later in the day, there is a report that the Eagles have hired a new head coach named [[Dick Vermeil]] as shown in a formal televised conference. That night, Papale goes to the bar where he works as a part-time [[bartender]]. The bar contains die-hard Eagles fans, who are watching TV about the hiring of Vermeil. The news story concludes with the announcement by Vermeil that he is staging open public tryouts for the Eagles. The men in the bar encourage Papale to go to the tryout. When Papale returns home, he finds out that his wife has left him and a note from her saying he will never be anything in the world. Distraught, Papale trashes the few remaining belongings that Sharon left behind.  When Papale goes to the bar the next night, he meets a new co-bartender, Janet Cantrell, who is a [[New York Giants|Giants]] fan. Desperate for income in the aftermath of his wife's departure, Papale receives support from his friends and attends the tryout hosted at [[Veterans Stadium]]. Out of several hundred Philadelphia residents attending the training facility, Papale performs well during the workouts. After the camp is over, Papale fails to start his car, and Dick Vermeil comes by. He is impressed by Papale’s actions at camp and invites him to training camp to compete for a roster spot with the Eagles. Everyone at the bar becomes excited about the TV announcement that Papale will be joining the team. After work, Papale has an interview with a [[newscaster]].  The next day, Papale exercises by jogging in the city and stops by at the empty home he tore up, where his former wife Sharon lived; then he interacts with his friends, telling them about joining the Eagles. His father, meanwhile, offers to let Vince stay with him. The following day, he goes to his first training camp with the Eagles. As the days of training camp progress, Papale endures a life full of hard work and disrespect from the other players. Papale goes out on a date with Janet one night, but didn't think he'd still be on the team. He says he's not sure he can start a new relationship at that time, because he is focused on trying his best to make the team and she claims she didn't know it was a date. She goes to help out at the bar and he leaves. As training camp ends, the final roster spot is down to Papale and a veteran. Against his assistants' advice, Vermeil decides to give the spot to Papale.  As Papale’s career with the Eagles begins, the team loses all six preseason games and their regular season opener against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Papale plays poorly against the Cowboys, and Vermeil faces pressure from the fans and media for the poor start. After the team returns to Philadelphia, Papale goes to the sandlot where he played with his friends once before. He is invited to play, but he declines because of his upcoming Eagles game and watches for a few minutes. A rainstorm begins, and then Papale does join his pals and plays against another sandlot team to help his friends. During a wet and dirty game, Papale ends the game by throwing a touchdown pass. When he runs into Janet later, they speak briefly before passionately embracing and tumbling into Vince's home.  During the home opener against the New York Giants, Eagles fans are enraged about Janet’s appearance in a Giants shirt. In the locker room, Vince looks again at the note Sharon had left and tears it up. Papale opens the game by solo-tackling the kickoff returner inside the fifteen-yard line. After an up-and-down game, Papale gets downfield during an Eagles' fourth quarter punt to tackle the returner, forcing a fumble that he recovers and takes into the end zone for a touchdown, giving the Eagles their first win in Papale’s career. Eagles fans go wild with joy. As the film's end credits appear, media and actual footage show highlights of Papale’s career with the Eagles. Papale plays for the team for three seasons and eventually marries Janet while Vermeil succeeds in turning the Eagles into a winning team, culminating in an appearance in [[Super Bowl XV]].

Woody is a popular varsity [[American football|football]] player while Nell is a girl who loves literature but lacks social skills. They loathe each other and are constantly in dispute. One day their class goes on a school trip to a museum and they are forced to work together on an assignment. They quickly begin arguing in front of a statue of the ancient [[Aztec]] god [[Tezcatlipoca]].<ref></ref> As they argue, the statue casts a spell upon them — causing them to wake up in each other's bodies the next morning. When they arrive at school, they immediately blame each other for the body swap, but agree to pretend to be the other person until they can find a way to switch back. At first, they seem to succeed, but quickly return to arguing when they each feel the other is misrepresenting them in the opposite body, such as Woody (in Nell's body) answering a question oddly and surprising a teacher.  The following day, Nell (in Woody's body) arrives at school wearing "[[Chino cloth|Chinos]] and an [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford]] cotton button-down" making Woody's appearance look "dorky" which frustrates Woody, and he is even more frustrated after he hears about how Nell (in Woody's body) failed Woody's football practice the previous day. As payback, Woody (in Nell's body) dresses in inappropriate and provocative clothing the following day. After school, Nell (in Woody's body), in retaliation, breaks up with Breanna ([[Brooke D'Orsay]]), Woody's girlfriend, much to the disappointment of Woody. The humiliation competition continues when Woody (in Nell's body) drives off with a biker boy, Nicky (Brandon Carrera), and makes Nell (in Woody's body) think she is going to lose her [[virginity]]. However, Woody decides it is "so gay" and leaves Nicky just as he is removing his clothing.  The following day, rumors are being spread around school by Nicky about his night with Nell. When Nell (in Woody's body) finds out, she gets very upset. When Woody (in Nell's body) finds Nell (in Woody's body), he admits that he didn't actually lose Nell's virginity and that everyone was simply spreading Nicky's lies. However, Nell is still let down and so Woody (in Nell's body) decides to confront Nicky. It turns out that Woody (in Nell's body) can't fight him, and Nell (in Woody's body) runs up and punches him in the face. After this, Nell and Woody reach a truce and realize the statue of Tezcatlipoca at the museum had something to do with their body swap. They head down to the museum and even after confronting the statue, they fail to return to their original bodies. They realize they are going to have to help each other in two important upcoming events. Nell must learn how to play football for Woody's [[Homecoming]] game and Woody must learn about poetry and literature for Nell's [[Yale University|Yale]] interview. Later that night Nell (in Woody's body) is getting drunk at a party while Woody (in Nell's body) is stuck at a slumber party listening to all the gossip about Woody, and surrounded by nailpolish, pajamas and slippers and gets a bikini wax.  After spending so much time together, Nell and Woody become very fond of each other and start to understand each other better. The night before the interview and the game, they agree to go to the Homecoming Dance together, as "not a date." The day of the interview and match, Woody goes to Yale for the interview and at first messes things up and is asked to leave, but he starts to talk about poetry in [[Hip hop music|rap]], which impresses and astonishes the interviewer. After that, he goes to the football game and watches Nell run in the winning [[touchdown]] in the closing seconds. A college recruiter witnesses his good performance and wants to talk to him later. After the game, they congratulate each other for their successes. Shortly after this, the spell lifts and they return to their original bodies. The scene finishes with Woody being kissed by Breanna and Nell going home very upset about it.  The following day, Woody tries to talk to Nell, but is stopped by her mother, who sees Woody's family as uneducated. Nell receives a letter from Yale informing her that she has been accepted, meaning that her interview (done by Woody in her body) was successful; however, she is still upset with Woody and has decided not to go to the Homecoming Dance. Meanwhile, Nell's father has a talk with her on the porch about Woody, during which she confesses she truly likes him, and her father surprises her with a dress and shoes for the dance. Woody and Breanna are selected as the Home Coming King and Queen. As the Home Coming King and Queen prepare to dance, an upset Woody sees Nell and both confesses their love for each.

Irresistible (film)
 The film begins with Sophie, a popular illustrator for books, walking her daughters, Ruby and Elly, home from school. She suddenly remembers she forgot to turn off the iron, and rushes to get home. When she gets there, she finds that it was still hot, but someone had already switched it off. Eventually dismissing it as a lapse of memory, she continues her daily routine of taking care of her two daughters and working on her next painting. While she's working, her husband, Craig, sends a singing telegram with flowers as an anniversary gift.  Later, while fixing dinner, Sophie senses that someone is in the house, but shrugs it off. Then Elly complains of the same feeling, and being frightened of it. Sophie has a look around and seems to notice things just slightly out of place, but again decides it's nothing of concern. Later, she has to pick up Craig because he has lost his keys. Sophie continues to feel on edge that night during their anniversary dinner. The next day, she finds one of her paintings destroyed and assumes her cat knocked over the inkwell.  She soon meets Mara, her husband's new co-worker, at a party. Mara and Sophie leave the party for a walk to the beach, where they have a talk. Mara offers Sophie her sympathy for her mother's passing, telling her she can relate because she lost her best friend, Kate, who had been an aid worker with orphans in Kosovo. She told Sophie that someone threw a [[Molotov cocktail]] through the window of the orphanage, and Kate burned to death trying to save the babies.  Over the next few weeks, items begin to go missing from Sophie's house, including one of her dresses and her daughter's favorite stuffed animal, causing the child great distress. She comes to suspect that Mara is stealing her belongings after seeing her wearing the missing dress, but Sophie has no evidence. She then breaks into Mara's house to collect proof, but gets caught and is given a restraining order. Craig does not back up Sophie in court.  Sophie soon suspects Craig may be having an affair with Mara, but he is quick to shrug it off. Sophie decides to take Craig's suggestion to stay in a friend's cabin, to spend time apart from the family and clear her mind. During a conversation with her father, it is revealed that Sophie became pregnant at the age of 18, and the baby had been surrendered to an orphanage against Sophie's wishes.  When Sophie returns home from the cabin, she realizes her cat is nowhere to be found. She suspects Mara is behind it, so she decides to sneak onto Mara's property to check. She finds her cat inside the house, but the burglar alarm goes off, attracting a neighbor's attention. Sophie hides in the basement just as Mara returns, who then searches the house to find out why the alarm was tripped. Wielding a hammer, she checks the basement while Sophie hides behind a shelf unit. Mara seems to sense someone is there but doesn't say anything. She just goes back upstairs and bolts the basement door, locking Sophie inside. Mara then goes to work.  Sophie begins to look around for tools or a way out, and finds her missing items, including her daughter's beloved toy and family photos with her face cut out of them. She realizes her suspicions of Mara were correct. She also finds a birth certificate and a letter from an adoption agency addressed to Mara, informing her that, despite her request, her biological mother did not wish to make contact with her. Because of the details in the documents, Sophie comes to believe that Mara was the baby she gave up.  While this is going on, Mara attempts to seduce Craig at his office, but they are interrupted by a phone call from his children's school. The school informs Craig that Sophie has not picked up the children. Craig needs to attend a meeting, so Mara offers to pick up the girls and take them to her house. When they arrive at Mara's house, Sophie, who is trying to escape via the air ducts, sees them through a floor vent in the kitchen. She tries to get her daughter's attention, but Mara discovers her instead.  Mara confronts Sophie in the basement and threatens her. Sophie tries to reason with Mara, who will have none of it. Sophie tells her she knows she is her mother, and she is sorry for giving her up. Mara strikes Sophie and smashes a bottle of wine on the floor. She drops a lit match on the wine, setting the basement on fire and hoping to kill Sophie. They struggle, and Mara's trouser legs catch fire, but Sophie saves her and helps Mara walk out to safety.  At the hospital, Craig is given the contents of his wife's pockets. Among them is the birth certificate and letter from the adoption agency. When Sophie wakes up, Craig tells her he knows about Mara, and they resolve to make their relationship work. Later, Sophie visits Mara in her hospital room, asking if she can include their story in her book. Sophie tells Mara she was brave to try to meet her, and she was a coward to refuse. Sophie asks for forgiveness, and they embrace as Mara weeps, apparently now forging a true mother-daughter bond. When the nurse tells Sophie she can't be there, she replies, "I'm her mother."  While Mara continues to recover at home, she pores over old news clippings and photos of her deceased childhood friend, Kate. There is a photo of Mara and Kate together as children in the orphanage, and we see that Kate looked just like Elly does now, and another photo of Mara and Kate together as adults in Kosovo. In that one, we see Kate grew up to be the spitting image of Sophie, revealing it was really Kate who was Sophie's daughter. She then angrily cuts out Ruby's face from another of Sophie's family photos and replaces it with her own, so her face is next to Sophie's. The caption she wrote in the scrapbook reads "Mother and Me".

John Tucker Must Die
 Kate Spencer is a teenage girl whose mother Lori's series of bad relationships always causes them to move to a new town. She and her mother move to a suburb of [[Portland, Oregon]] and Kate gets a job as a waitress. While at work, she sees popular local boy John Tucker on dates with three different girls: chronic [[Overachievement|overachiever]] Carrie, head [[cheerleader]] Heather, and promiscuous and liberal [[Veganism|vegan]] activist Beth. Kate learns from a co-worker that John dates girls from different [[clique]]s at his school so that they never interact and convinces the girls he dates to keep their relationships secret.  One day in gym class, Kate, Carrie, Heather and Beth end up on the same team for a volleyball game. During the game, Carrie brags about being with John Tucker, and the girls learn about his scheme. Carrie, Heather and Beth begin fighting. Kate tries to intervene, only to get all four of them sent to detention. Later that evening, the girls enlist Kate's help in seeking revenge against John. Meanwhile, Kate becomes friends with John's brother Scott, better known as "The Other Tucker". The girls' initial attempts to undo John (making people believe he has [[genital herpes]] and with Heather undermining his confidence by pranking him with [[estrogen]], causing him to become weak and say strange things about himself) initially work, but eventually backfire as John manages to use them to his advantage. After he breaks up with all three girls, they agree that breaking his heart is the ideal revenge. They then enlist Kate to be the heartbreaker.  Kate joins the cheerleading team in order to get John's attention, and the girls give her advice on how to act around John and spy on the dates using surveillance equipment. After they give Kate a makeover, John immediately notices her and tries to win her attention, but Kate dismisses him. With his ego insulted that there is a girl he cannot charm, John becomes determined to get her.  Kate and John eventually go on a series of dates, the first of which is a bonfire at the beach. Kate is unprepared after John asks to take her home and Beth intervenes to teach her how to kiss. However, John arrives, forcing Beth to hide in the back of his [[Land Rover]].  At her house, Kate manages to buy Beth time to escape by kissing John, with Beth's skirt being ruined in the process after getting it caught in the car's door. The plan seems to be working as John relentlessly chases after Kate, even going to her house in the middle of the night while talking to her on the phone at the same time. (Kate tells him that she needs to call the police because there is a stalker outside the house, and John drives away in panic, hitting a trash can.)  The next date is a romantic boat ride, and Kate and John have a good time together. Beth later notices that Kate is starting to fall for John. To counteract this, Carrie tapes John bragging to his friends in the locker room, saying he'll be scoring "more than baskets" at the away game, and shows the tape to Kate in order to get her to snap out of it.  The girls try another plan to embarrass John at a hotel on the night of the away game. Kate seduces John on a video-chat and tells him to put on a woman's thong and climb out of his room and into hers. He is misled and climbs into a teacher's room and ultimately becomes the laughingstock of the school. John again uses this to his advantage, starting a fashion trend that helps the boys on the team improve. Meanwhile, Kate's mother and Scott both discover the plan and lament the change in Kate's behavior.  Afterward, Kate tells John that she heard about what he said in the locker room about her. John makes amends by giving her his watch and asking her to be his girlfriend. Kate tells Heather, Carrie and Beth that she wants to be out of the plan, as whether they are dating or plotting to destroy John Tucker, it is still all about him. At John's birthday, the tape the girls made of John's destruction is played, and Kate reveals the entire plot as John stares in disbelief, seemingly hurt.  Heather, Beth and Carrie defend her after a guest throws his drink at Kate. Still, John Tucker becomes unfazed, and the party devolves into a cake fight. A few days later, John and Kate agree to be friends, and John resolves to be honest. Scott, happy that Kate confessed, becomes her lab partner again, and it is hinted the two will begin dating. Kate is now good friends with Beth, Carrie and Heather. Kate finishes saying, "as for the girl who made John Tucker fall in love, well, she's a legend".  [[post-credits scene|After the credits]], Kate warns [[fourth wall|viewers at home]] wanting to try this that destroying a man has consequences, and the camera pans to several male teachers bending over to grab some papers, all wearing thongs.  
Jindabyne (film)
 On an annual fishing trip, in isolated high country, Stewart ([[Gabriel Byrne]]), Carl ([[John Howard (Australian actor)|John Howard]]), Rocco (Stelios Yiakmis) and Billy ([[Simon Stone]]) find a girl's body in the river; she has been brutally murdered by Gregory ([[Chris Haywood]]), a local electrician. The girl (Tatea Reilly) turns out subsequently to be [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]]. The discovery shocks and confuses the men. Only the youngest of the men, Billy, understands this is a crime scene but he is ignored. Billy later leaves the town with his partner and child. The men initially suggest hiking back the following morning as it is too late in the day to safely navigate their way to their trucks. Stewart secures the girl's body by the ankle to the riverbank, so she will not drift downstream and get lost in the rapids. However, Stewart the next day goes fishing and, after catching an especially large fish, the men decide to spend the rest of the afternoon continuing their trip before informing the police in the morning.  While the men are gone, some of the men's wives (Jude and Claire) and Rocco's girlfriend (Carmel), get together socially. During their conversation, Jude (Carl's wife) reveals that their daughter died nearly two years ago, leaving them to raise their granddaughter Cailin-Calandria, who has psychological issues and towards whom Jude shows resentment. When Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney) remarks that she does not think Stewart would want more children, Jude reveals that Claire had a mental breakdown after her son Tom was born and left the family for 18 months.  The men return home late Sunday night. After reporting the body to the police, they each go to their respective homes. Stewart goes home to Claire and finds her sleeping on her stomach, reminiscent of the posture of the dead body. He talks to her briefly and initiates intimacy. However, he does not disclose the find, which later causes problems when Claire finds out he left the girl's body to keep fishing.  The next morning, the police show up at Claire and Stewart's house to ask Stewart to answer some more questions. The men gather in the police station, where the police officer expresses his disgust that they would "fish over a dead body" instead of reporting it as soon as they could. Claire is stunned that Stewart would do such a thing and keeps trying to understand his reasons. The men come up with a story that Carl strained his ankle thus they could not walk back as early as they would have otherwise. Because the girl was Aboriginal, some believe the men neglected the dead girl out of racism. All of the men's businesses are vandalised in retaliation by Aboriginals, with painted slurs branding them racists. It becomes clear from this point that the western culture of a town that had to be abandoned and rebuilt on higher ground because of a dam and which is peopled by immigrants, is at odds with the ancient belief system of the native Aboriginals.  Claire and Elissa (Billy's partner) are the only ones of the group who express any remorse and condemnation for what happened.  Jude repeatedly defends her husband Carl, while Carl argues that the girl was already dead and thus it made no difference to her whether they stayed or not. The more Claire pushes Stewart and the others to make amends, the more tensions increase in the town.  Prior to the fishing trip, Claire had begun throwing up repeatedly from morning sickness, which she hid from everyone. With her marriage unravelling, and haunted by her post-post-partum breakdown and abandonment of her first child, she inquires of a medical professional about how to get an abortion. However, she has still not gone through with it - nor revealed her pregnancy to Stewart - by the end of the film.  Despite encountering hostility from the rest of the group, Claire continues to try to reach out to the girl's family. She gathers donations to give to the girl's family for her funeral. Claire even goes to the family's home and is rebuked. She later returns to give them the money she has gathered.   Increasingly troubled that Claire continues to probe for the truth of what happened, Stewart erupts in rage one evening when Claire asks him to talk about it. The two begin fighting physically, while slinging barbs at each other about their past mistakes. The next day, after Billy and his family have left town for the coast, Stewart tells Claire - who he suspects is planning to leave him - that he will never allow her to take his son from him. Carl similarly stands up for Cailin-Calandria after Jude once again shows anger towards her, saying she cannot take her pain of losing their daughter out on their blameless granddaughter.  The next day, Claire goes to the memorial service. The rest of the men and their wives, as well as the children, show up to pay their respects, too. When Stewart apologises on behalf of the men, the girl's father throws dirt on him, spits on the ground and walks away, but there are no further objections to their presence. Stewart also asks Claire to come home.  Throughout the movie, the murdering electrician continuously pops up around the characters, and even attends the memorial service. He is never caught, though the final scene of the film where he is stung by a wasp before an abrupt cut to black opens the possibility that he is killed.

The next day, Sam invites the Sarans for a dinner party on the occasion of Kamal's birthday. At the party, after a conversation on love, marriage and fidelity, Dev 'jokingly' confesses that he loves Maya. Sam senses that there was more to Dev's remark than light banter.

Both Sam and Kamal are shocked and upset at the fact that Dev and Maya cheated on their spouses, despite both Rhea and Rishi's attempts to salvage their respective marriages. That night, Sam has a heart attack. On his deathbed, he advises Maya to leave Rishi as she was depriving Rishi and herself of true love and happiness in life. After Sam's death, Dev and Maya decide they must end their relationship and go back to their respective spouses, but first they must tell them the truth about their extramarital affair, because neither of them would be able to move on with their spouses in the shadow of dishonesty.

Kamen Rider Kabuto: God Speed Love
 In 1999, an enormous meteor crashed onto Earth and caused a global calamity that depleted the planet's waters. Furthermore, the meteor carried extraterrestrial creatures known as the Worms who proceeded to kill humans and assume their identities. In order to counter this new threat, ZECT was formed, who in turn created the Masked Rider System to combat the Worms. The battles lasts over seven years, depleting Earth's resources and turning it into a barren wasteland. By present time, power struggles in ZECT have caused Hidenori Oda to establish a splinter group called Neo-ZECT with Daisuke Kazama and Shura Hokuto to fight against ZECT's authority. A mysterious youth named Souji Tendou arrives to the city and decides to sell his power to either Neo-ZECT or ZECT for his own personal agenda.  At the same time, ZECT has obtained intelligence about a large comet orbiting the vicinity of space. By building the Jacob's Ladder space station, they plan to capture this comet and spread its water throughout Earth, replenishing the Earth’s oceans. The space station includes a function that works in conjunction with the Rider System's Clock Up function. Tendou joins Neo-ZECT after telling Kagami that he will act as a double agent and report back what Neo-ZECT is currently planning while destroying the organization from the inside. Tendou, in turns, updates Neo-ZECT about ZECT's operation, effectively manipulating both groups while getting intel on ZECT's golden rider.  When Neo-ZECT's plan to take over the Jacob's Ladder is initiated, both groups’ true colors come to light. Tendou and Oda proceed to Jacob's Ladder while Shura and Daisuke act as a diversion. Daisuke transforms into [[Kamen Rider Drake]] and exploded a few gas tanks in order to gain attention. But The plan failed when Shura betrayed them, and Daisuke realizes it's a trap and ZECT already knows about their attack. Tendou and Oda are greeted by Yaguruma Sou and ZECTroopers, while Daisuke dies facing Shura and her troops. Meanwhile, Tendou and Oda are attempting to fight off Yaguruma. Oda tells Tendou to hurry ahead to the space station, and he will hold Yaguruma and his troops back. Yaguruma transformed into [[Kamen Rider TheBee]] before being killed by Oda as Kamen Rider Hercus. Tendou arrived on Jacob's Ladder first and is confronted by Tetsuki Yamato - Kamen Rider Ketaros. Kabuto's fight with Ketaros ends when they both fall off the space station due a shockwave caused by the comet being shattered by meteor that was dragged in by the Clock Up function. Kabuto survives by using the Kabuto Extender for a safe landing while Ketaros dies upon re-entry into Earth's atmosphere and Oda is killed by the mysterious golden rider Kamen Rider Caucasus.  Tendou and Kagami later receive news that Hiyori is on the point of dying due to the exposure to the meteor dust years ago and it is then that Tendou reveals he is Hiyori's brother. Holding the wedding ceremony in a hospital, Hiyori dies soon afterwards. At this point, despite being told that precautions to destroy the meteor will be executed, Shura learns that ZECT's higher ups have sided with the Worms and intend to have the meteor fall. Mortally wounded from an attempt to silence her, Shura lived long enough to call Tendou of the turn of events as he and Kagami take it on as their mission to save humanity from this disaster. Kabuto and Gattack reach the shuttle in time and meet Caucasus, who explains to them that the meteor is carried hibernating Worms. Furthermore, explaining he defends only those who deserve to be the superior form of life, and that missiles within the shuttle will be used to decimate the human population to enable the Worms' infiltration.  The majority of the battle is in Caucasus' favor due to the speed provided to him by the Hyper Zector: The item that Tendou was searching for the entire time. Caucasus was about to kill Kabuto with a Rider Kick when Gattack intercepts the attack, badly wounding himself while allowing Kabuto to take the Hyper Zector from Caucasus and force him out through the air-lock. Kabuto places the injured Kagami into an escape pod to send him to Earth, unaware that Caucasus is holding on Kagami's escape pod and intends to punch a hole into the window to kill the man for his interference. Kabuto luckily uses the Hyper Zector to become Hyper Kabuto and uses Hyper Clock Up to intercept Caucacus before he succeeded and Hyper Kicked him into the space shuttle, destroying him and the vessel.  Hyper Kabuto then uses the Hyper Zecter to send the second meteor back in time by seven years and force it to crash into the first meteor. The result is that only a small fragment of the original meteor hits Shibuya, minimizing the damage and erasing the future in which the Earth's oceans are dried up. But shockwave caused by the two meteors crashing knocks Tendou towards Shibuya, finding his past self in the same situation as in the previous timeline. But Tendou, in his final moments of existence, gives his belt to the younger Tendou to give the boy strength to save Hiyori. With the disastrous future erased, Tendou disappears as his younger self grows up and lives a better life in the [[Kamen Rider Kabuto#Story|new timeline]].

When she delivers a male child, her infant is swapped and a girl child is placed instead. This incident forces her to fight for her son.

Tammy gets drunk at a Christmas party and becomes unresponsive after the two drug her. Tammy is raped, and ends up getting sick while drugged, choking on her own vomit. Karla calls 911, and the two hide the assault evidence so her death would appear accidental. Afterwards, Paul beats Karla for "ruining his movie". Karla learns never to ruin Paul's "movies".  Karla tells Dr. Arnold that Paul became obsessed with Tammy, and kept watching the video after her death, even showing it to friends. Paul also threatened to reveal Karla's role in her sister's [[murder]], if he should get into any more trouble, but Karla finally leaves him anyway. Paul is open with Karla about his crimes, yet Karla does not object to them, even when Paul begins to bring his victims home. Although disturbed at that part of Paul's life, Karla learns to accept it, knowing that she too will be killed if she does not. At Paul's request, Karla hesitantly participates in these assaults.   Paul kidnaps a young girl, "Tina McCarthy", and forces her to undress on camera. Karla witnesses this, but is too afraid to tell anyone. Tina is held for 3 days, and is raped repeatedly while Karla is forced to videotape it all. During one such assault, Paul [[strangle]]s Tina after she sees his face. Karla tries to convince him not to kill her, but he insists, telling her that Tina can identify them both.   He cuts the body into pieces and seals them in cement blocks, which he then dumps into a [[lake]]. On the day of Paul and Karla's wedding, the girl's body is discovered, and identified by dental records. Paul stops raping and abducting for a time, but his [[anxiety]] and pent-up [[frustration]] cause him to become violent toward Karla. Paul's friends see the change in his personality and break off from him. Meanwhile Karla, suffering from the abuse and desperate to reclaim his affections, helps Paul abduct and rape another young girl, "Kaitlyn Ross".  Kaitlyn is brutally raped by Paul. Karla watches the assault and begins to cry. Paul beats Karla and tells her that she is ruining his movie again. After Paul leaves, Karla is put in charge of Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn tells Karla that she is a victim too, and that this is not her fault. When asked why she stays, Karla simply says, "You don't understand". Karla explains to Dr. Arnold that she wanted to free Kaitlyn, but was afraid Paul would kill her if she did.  Kaitlyn's disappearance immediately attracts a storm of media and police attention, so Paul kills her, to be rid of her. As part of the investigation, the police arrive at Paul's house. Paul is very cooperative so the police leave satisfied, but, afterwards, he beats Karla mercilessly. Karla takes refuge with friends before reporting the assault. Paul is then booked under [[domestic violence]] but is released after only one night in [[jail]].  Back at the Regional Psychiatric Centre, Dr. Arnold asks Karla about her relationship with her younger sister, Tammy, and her [[jealousy]] towards her, because of Paul's attraction to her. Karla confesses that Paul wanted to take Tammy's [[virginity]] and that he wanted Karla to "give" Tammy to him. Karla agreed to help him rape her sister.  Shortly thereafter, the [[DNA sample]]s Paul provided as part of the Scarborough [[rape investigation]], are matched to the evidence found on one of the murder victims. Both Paul and Karla are subsequently arrested. During the [[trial]], Paul testifies that Karla killed Kaitlyn Ross with a [[mallet]]. Karla denies all the killings. Paul is [[convicted]] on two counts of murder without any possibility of parole. Karla is given a sentence of twelve years in exchange for a [[guilty plea]] for [[manslaughter]].  A note explains that Karla's parole was denied, as the [[psychologist]] found her artificial, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]],and without remorse.

He calls back his buddy Havildar Jaikumar ([[Jiiva]]) from his honeymoon because he has information about major activities of the militants; he feels Jaikumar is needed for the team. The commandos raid a mosque in civilian dress and seize a big collection of arms and explosives. Later, during an operation focused on some cottages near the [[Dal Lake]], a commando in the team is killed and an outraged Jaikumar shoots down a captured terrorist who challenges the commandos. A human rights activist ([[Shwetha Menon]]) learns about this and threatens to file a complaint with the government. She later understands the situation and the sincerity of the commandos and decides not to proceed with the complaint.  Meanwhile, a group of terrorists from [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] conspire to hit the [[Hazratbal Shrine]] with a missile; they think this will create unrest in the region and that the Indian army will be blamed. They hijack a house that offers a good vantage point on the shrine and plant the missile there. Some of them rape three girls in the house in front of their father and shoot a person who protests. A military patrolling vehicle hears the gunshot; as they approach the house, they are fired upon. The patrolling team intimates the NSG, and Mahadevan and his team immediately join the battle. After a long operation, the team kills the terrorists, frees the civilian hostages and disarms the missile. But a civilian informs that the chief of the terrorists is not to be seen among the corpses, and the commandos start a combing operation in the house. They locate the terrorist and Mahadevan recognises the man as the one who killed his wife and daughter. The terrorist is killed but he manages to shoot at Mahadevan. Mahadevan is covered by Jaikumar, who gets hit by the bullet and dies. Jaikumar is awarded the [[Kirti Chakra]] posthumously.  
Kenny (2006 film)
 ''Kenny'' is a [[mockumentary]] that follows the fictional Kenny through his daily life. His work and his personal relationships are explored as Kenny goes about his day-to-day activities and speaks directly to the camera and his audience. Kenny provides a most basic service to the community, [[portable toilet]]s. The audience sees Kenny interviewing potential clients and involved in major public events. It is important to Kenny to know the kind of food and drink to be served at these events as this will determine the level of service he provides. Never ashamed of his job, despite the disparagement of some (including his own family), Kenny regards himself as a professional. Even at the most prestigious events for which he caters, Kenny realises that the most glamorous will need his portable toilets. He sees life in all of its complexities through the need of his services. Kenny takes his son Jesse to visit his father, but is hampered by his ex-wife's uncooperativeness and his father's bitterness. When Kenny travels to [[Nashville]] to attend a toilet convention, he is thrilled to travel outside his native [[Melbourne]]. His ingenuity, friendship and commitment to his profession opens business opportunities in Japan and the potential for a new relationship with Jackie, a flight attendant, but he must return home prematurely when his father suffers a medical emergency. In an attempt at bonding, Kenny and his father and his wealthy brother David go camping. After half a day, David leaves in disdain, to which Kenny tries to defend prompting his father to tell Kenny to step out of his brothers shadow and stick up for himself, a conversation with his father back in the tent prompts Kenny to consider his life. He reveals that his success in Nashville has led to the offer of a promotion, and though his father urges him to accept, Kenny is unsure. When Kenny's ex-wife unexpectedly leaves him with Jesse on the day of the [[Melbourne Cup]], his busiest day of the year, Kenny finds Jesse to be an able and cheerful assistant. However, prejudice against his work again appears, with customers complaining that a child should not be made to clean toilets, and Kenny remands Jesse to the office. When he returns to find Jesse gone, Kenny searches the venue in a panic and eventually finds Jesse at the toilets, wanting to help again. That night, as he is about to drive away in his [[Cesspool emptier|septic tank truck]] after a long and exhausting day, Kenny's way is blocked by a luxury car whose driver insensitively brushes off his requests to move. Kenny eventually breaks habit to fill the man's car with human waste, a suggestion that perhaps Kenny has decided to stick up for himself a little bit more. Finally, Kenny declines the opportunity to become an executive and seeks out Jackie to renew their relationship.

Keroro Gunsō the Super Movie
 [[Keroro (character)|Keroro]] skips out on destroying military planes in a [[simulated reality]] in favor of buying the newest [[Gundam model]] with [[Fuyuki Hinata|Fuyuki]]. As they head home, they encounter a mystery shrine resembling a space fort. As Keroro prepares to give a monetary offering, he accidentally drops a 100-yen coin into the shrine, forcing him and Fuyuki to go after it. Inside the shrine is a prehistoric-looking jungle, where Fuyuki finds an ancient dome and a small glass container, inside it a glowing orb. As Keroro triumphantly finds his coin, he knocks over the container, which breaks, causing the orb to shine wildly. After Keroro attempts to fix the container with rubber cement, the duo dashes out of the shrine and toward home, leaving the remaining piece of the container to transform into a pink  As Keroro builds his new GM Sniper Custom model, he discovers a small red X on his face. He goes to both Fuyuki and Natsumi to tell them about his dilemma, but neither of them are of any help. That night, a menacing white Keronian appears from the mystery shrine, and gives numerous Earthlings the same red X. The next day, it is discovered that anyone who possesses this red mark gains telepathic powers named "Revocommi", allowing them to communicate with their minds. The X mark is also contagious: it can be spread from one person to another, allowing other people to become Revolutor. Keroro then orders Kururu to create an amplifying device, planning to use his new power to send amplified orders to the Revolutor of Earth, putting them under his control. That night, the white Keronian (who has taken residence on a tower) sends out a strange signal.  The next day, everyone has become depressed, this is because the Revolutor can sense each other's malicious thoughts, they're avoiding others, and begin to withdraw from society. What's more, because of telepathy, there's no need for cops, TV broadcasts, Internet, or cell phones, and the entire city shuts down. That night, strange green orbs emerge from the Revolutor's marks, and are fed to the white Keronian. On the same night, as Keroro's order-magnifying helmet is completed, the pink Keronian arrives in a gigantic Keronian statue. The Keronian introduces herself as Mirara, the Keron Army's ancient weapon researcher. She is fascinated by Keroro's helmet, but is frightened to see the X symbol on everyone, and tells them a story: The red X is a part of the Keronian weapon named Kiruru, which was sealed away in a vase by the Keron Army. It grows and multiplies from people's conflicts, pain, worries, and negative mental energy, after which it destroys the planet. The only thing that can reseal Kiruru is strong friendship and a heart of trust, but when Mirara reminds the group that invaders and invadees are sworn enemies, more negative energy is produced and Kiruru grows stronger. She turns to [[Momoka Nishizawa|Momoka]] and Tamama for help, but only ends up causing the same problem.  Having absorbed everyone's malicious thoughts, Kiruru transforms into a [[Kaiju|monster]] and rampages through the city. The [[Keroro Platoon]] decides to take matters into their own hands and send Giroro and Tamama to attack Kiruru, but even their most powerful attacks fail to put a scratch on Kiruru. Seeing no other alternative, Keroro dons the helmet, intending to enlarge himself and send orders to Kiruru. But when that fails, he decides to stall Kiruru while Fuyuki, Natsumi, and Giroro head for the mystery shrine and figure out a way to stop Kiruru. Back at the mystery shrine, Fuyuki and Natsumi discover that it was Kiruru that destroyed the dinosaurs, and when Kiruru absorbs enough dark emotions, he starts multiplying, and only Mirara can stop Kiruru.  Keroro finally admits defeat to Kiruru, who then absorbs his energy, transforming into a large tower. Keroro returns to see the Hinata household (and all of his [[Gundam model|Gunpla]]) in ruins. The good memories Keroro and Fuyuki share together cause the red X on their heads to disappear. Mirara appears and gives the group red circles, after which she transforms into a key, which will seal Kiruru if it is inserted into the gigantic X on the tower. Using Mirara's Keronian statue as a mode of transportation, Keroro and Fuyuki are close to approaching the tower, but as soon as they come into close proximity, Kiruru starts to clone himself and chases after them. The statue crash lands, leaving the others to take care of the situation. Keroro and Fuyuki find a new mode of transportation in the form of Mutsumi's giant paper airplane, but the Kirurus continue to multiply. After the key continuously switches between owners, Kululu finally tosses it towards the X, which is shielded by a barrier. The barrier is broken when Giroro flies his [[Mecha|mech]] into it. Natsumi and Giroro hold off the Kirurus while Fuyuki and Keroro go inside the tower. After a long stairway, the duo find a gigantic glass vase with a key-shaped slot. They finally seal away Kiruru, and the Kiruru Tower disappears in a brilliant yellow light, along with everyone's red X.

At a local school, student Katie is seen to suffer intense physical and emotional [[bullying]] by a group of girls, as well as by Sam Peel ([[Noel Clarke]]). When her father picks her up from school that day, Sam quietly threatens to kill her if she ever tells anyone. That evening, Katie's older brother breaks into her room to discover that she has [[suicide|hanged herself]].  The following morning, the students are informed of Katie's death and are given the day off to mourn. Trife and his best friends Jay ([[Adam Deacon]]) and Moony ([[Femi Oyeniran]]) decide to spend it smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]] and drinking [[alcohol]]. Alisa (Red Madrell), Trife's ex-girlfriend and also pregnant - supposedly with Sam's baby - decides to spend the day with her best friend Becky ([[Jaime Winstone]]). Becky performs [[oral sex]] on an older man in return for drugs, and aggressively coaxes Alisa into [[Handjob|joining in]]. The boys make their way to Sam's house on an [[Housing estate|estate]] to retrieve a [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] Sam had stolen from them earlier. Realising Sam is out, the boys also steal Sam's cannabis and Jay has sex with Sam's girlfriend Claire (Madeleine Fairley). Sam returns unexpectedly, but is beaten unconscious by the boys and they knock down Sam's mother as they flee.  Alisa and Becky unexpectedly run into some of Katie's bullies aboard a [[London Underground|train]]. Alisa, feeling bad that she was not there for Katie, berates the girls for the suffering they caused. Becky accidentally reveals that Alisa is pregnant, information that the bullies promise to spread around school in an effort to humiliate Alisa. At the next station, Alisa hurries off the train to [[Morning sickness|vomit]], whilst Becky scorns her for putting her life at risk. Having successfully sold the drugs they acquired earlier, they head to a shopping centre to buy dresses for a party later that evening. Becky makes demands of Alisa to buy a cheaper dress, before the pair meet up with the boys. Jay, convinced that Alisa's baby is Sam's, informs her that Trife wants nothing to do with her (although he does still care about her). Heartbroken, Alisa asks Becky if they can leave, however Becky refuses as she wants to go to the party.  At the same time, Trevor has gone to see his Uncle Curtis ([[Cornell John]]). Curtis presents Trevor with a [[revolver]], the same one Trevor had drilled the barrel for in the beginning of the film at school. Trevor is shown downstairs, where Andreas (a customer seen earlier to have missed a drugs payment) is tied and beaten by Curtis and Trevor. Curtis then orders Trevor to carve a "C" into Andreas' face with a [[Stanley knife]] in order to test him. Though visibly terrified, Trevor carries out his uncle's order, and flees the house traumatised. Trevor desperately tries to call Alisa, but is unsuccessful in doing so. On her way home, Alisa runs into a classmate and persuades her to go to the party with her. At the party, Becky is stood up by Moony and fails in an attempt to convince Jay to have sex with her.  Trevor interrupts Alisa and the other classmate who are kissing outside, and confesses his love for her. Alisa informs Trevor that the baby is definitely his - she had never slept with Sam. The two rekindle their love, but a vengeful Sam arrives at the party and attacks Trevor. Alisa hurriedly tells Jay and Moony, who intervene to help Trevor. Outside, Sam beats down both Trevor and Jay, whilst intimidating Moony into not interfering. Sam challenges all the other party goers who come out to watch, however Alisa, the only one unafraid of Sam, slaps him. When Sam grabs her by her hair, Trevor gets to his feet and fights him to the ground. Alisa pleads with him to stop, and he ambles over to her. However, Sam takes this opportunity to grab his [[baseball bat]], and deliver a critical blow to Trevor's stomach. As this occurs, a car pulls up to the party. Brandishing a gun, the assailant demands to know who Sam is - a friend of Katie's points out Sam to him when he pretends he isn't. Removing his scarf, the assailant is shown to be Lenny, Katie's older brother. Lenny forces Sam to his knees at gunpoint, and produces the [[suicide letter|note]] Katie wrote before she hanged herself. Lenny orders Sam to tell him why he shouldn't kill him. With his dying breath, Trevor shouts "cause he's not worth it". Sam is almost killed when he insults Lenny after the latter begins to walk away, however the gun fails to fire.

Khosla Ka Ghosla
 Kamal Kishore Khosla ([[Anupam Kher]]) is a middle-class man living in New Delhi. He is a simple man with simple tastes. The film begins with a dream sequence where Khosla sees his death, the irony being that nobody really cares about his demise; instead his children and neighbours are more occupied with banal small talk. Waking up from this nightmare, Khosla goes to visit a site where he has purchased a plot of land to build a house. He is accompanied by his family&nbsp;— wife, younger son Chirauonji Lal a.k.a. Cherry ([[Parvin Dabas]]) (who does not like his name and wishes to change it), elder son  Balwant a.k.a. Bunty ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), and his daughter. Kamal Kishore has invested all of his savings (Rs.3 million) into buying the plot; Cherry is not too interested in his father's future plans of settling together in the new house. He is a software engineer and, although a source of pride for his father, he finds his current lifestyle too drab and has planned to shift to the US by taking up a job there. However, he has not let his family in on his plans. The only person Cherry discusses his plan with are Asif Iqbal ([[Vinay Pathak]]), the agent helping him with his passport and visa paperwork. Much later, he shares this with his close friend Meghna ([[Tara Sharma]])&nbsp;— who has a very visible romantic interest in him (one which he does not seem to fully realise)&nbsp;— she, however, feels hurt and angered by his choice to desert her and his family.  Just when Cherry reveals his migration plans to his family, who are all disturbed by it, during a routine family visit to their land, they find the plot encroached upon by someone. Probing further reveals that the squatters are part of a property usurping nexus headed by the corrupt and powerful Kishan Khurana ([[Boman Irani]]). Upon being urged so by the property dealer who had facilitated the purchase of the plot, Kamal Kishore and Bunty visit Khurana. Khurana places before them, a demand for Rs.1.5&nbsp;million to vacate the plot, an amount which Khosla neither has nor agrees to pay. Kamal Kishore appeals to authorities and agencies, including the police, lawyers, political parties, NGOs and social activists for help. None of them offers more than to get the amount demanded by Khurana reduced by a few lacs, in exchange for a hefty commission for mediating, of course.  Spurred by his father's helplessness, Bunty gets help from a gang of local strongmen (pahalwans) who demolish the boundary walls built by Khurana's men and take possession of the plot back by force. This success is short-lived as the corrupt Khurana has the police in his pocket and Kamal Kishore is arrested on trumped up charges of trespass. Released at Khurana's guileful behest after spending a day in the jail, Khosla's will is broken and pride battered. After the catastrophic event Khosla tells his family (especially Cherry) to avoid taking any further action as he is not capable of fighting back and wants Cherry to concentrate on the job that he's arranging abroad. Cherry discusses the grim situation with Asif Iqbal who is revealed to have been an old partner of Khurana's and who has been cheated by him, usurping Asif's own ancestral land. Asif offers to help the Khoslas with a group of Meghna's friends, and they set up a plan to deceive Khurana. They portray a land (owned by the fisheries department, but which has been vacant since decades) as their own, and seek help of Meghna's mentor, Bapu ([[Navin Nischol]]) to portray himself as the owner of the land, who is looking for a buyer. The deal is almost finalised, and Khurana requests to visit the land. With the help of the rest of the theatre group, they manage to create a situation which makes Khurana believe of the authenticity of the land and its owner. They successfully turn the tables on Khurana, and dupe him of Rs 3.5 million in cash. From that money, Kamal Kishore pays the ransom 1.2&nbsp;million to Khurana and gets possession of his plot back, and the remaining cash is divided equally between Asif and the theatre group.  The turmoil suffered throughout by the family and the victory of their efforts stirs emotions that bring Cherry close to Meghna and his family. Cherry scraps his plans of migrating to the US, marries Meghna and settles with his family in their new abode built on their plot. As an additional favour, his father allows him to change his name from Chironji Lal to Chirag. As for Khurana, he is left looking bitter, having finally tasted his own medicine.

Kokoda (film)
 A motley crew of [[Australian]] militiamen or 'chocos' from the [[39th Battalion (Australia)|39th Battalion]] are stationed in a New Guinea village just after the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invasion. The 39th Battalion are the only troops available to hold off the Japanese advance until the [[Second Australian Imperial Force|AIF]] arrives to relieve them. The story centres on an infantry section of the 39th Battalion. The section with their platoon commander, an AIF lieutenant ([[Ben Barrack]]) who has served in North Africa, is on forward patrol when they are attacked by a Japanese force. The lieutenant is killed early in the battle and the section, led only by a recently promoted lance-corporal, Max ([[Simon Stone]]), decide to fall back. One of the men, L/Cpl Wilstead ([[Ewen Leslie]]), is bayoneted in the face by a Japanese soldier, and a Bren gunner called Blue ([[Christopher Baker (actor)|Christopher Baker]]) offers to stay and provide cover. However, the remaining men are cut off and surrounded in the dense jungle, with little hope of escaping. The Australians try to remain hidden until nightfall, when Darko ([[Travis McMahon]]) and Jack ([[Jack Finsterer]]) decide to go and find out where Blue is. They stumble across Blue, who is tied up and being tortured by Japanese soldiers. Darko and Jack look on helplessly as the Japanese soldiers bayonet him in the stomach and groin, and finally decapitate him with a sword. They return to their hiding place, shaken by what they have seen. The Japanese ambush the section and they run further into the jungle. Caught behind enemy lines in harsh terrain, Jack, to whom the others (including his brother, Max, have deferred) tries to maintain command of a small group of men. Suffering from [[malaria]] and [[dysentery]], the remaining six men decide to make their way to Isurava, where the remainder of the 39th are fighting a desperate battle.  One of the soldiers, Sam ([[Steve Le Marquand]]), has been injured in the leg and orders the rest of the section to leave him behind. They refuse and he struggles along with a crutch. After a full day of walking, the men are exhausted. The next morning they awake to find Sam gone, having hidden himself in a hollow tree stump to avoid holding them up.  The men continue and are ambushed by a Japanese patrol. The Japanese are all killed, but Max is badly wounded by a gunshot to the stomach and is unable to walk. He is carried by all the men.  The section makes it to a New Guinea village that has been destroyed by the advancing Japanese, and the Australians decide to take refuge. They bury the dead New Guinea villagers and an argument arises between Jack and Darko, a tough soldier who carries the section's Bren gun, over Max. Darko wishes to leave him behind as he is slowing the section down and they are needed at Isurava. Jack, however, wants to stay with him. However, Max decides to stay and let the others go and Johnno ([[Tom Budge]]), who has severe dysentery, stays with him. The men agree, and Jack, Darko and Burke ([[Luke Ford (actor)|Luke Ford]]), Darko's number two, head off to Isurava. The journey becomes treacherous and Burke's dysentery is getting worse.  Meanwhile, at the village, a few Japanese arrive to search the village and in a desperate attempt to save the life of his mate, Johnno fires at the Japanese and runs into the jungle; however, he is tracked down and gunned down by the Japanese. A day or so later a New Guinea tribesman comes back to inspect the village and finds a badly wounded Max in the hut.  After a gut-wrenching climb, Jack, Darko and Burke are found by the AIF, who take them to Isurava, where the situation is in dire straits. The AIF has arrived but they too are weak from the trek to Isurava. The 39th is no longer a fighting unit and almost all of the men are too sick or wounded to fight. The three men check themselves into a makeshift field hospital for treatment. However an AIF officer comes in and asks for any available men from the 39th to help hold the line. Jack, Burke and Darko volunteer and they are assigned to a position held by men of the 2/16th Infantry.  That night the Japanese attack in waves against the Australian positions. The Australians, who are only equipped with rifles and machine guns, desperately hold off the Japanese. The Japanese are gunned down by the superior firepower of the Australians, but in the final seconds of the fight Burke is shot through the chest and dies in Darko's arms as the fight rages on. The Japanese end the assault and the battle is over.  The next day, the scant remainder of the 39th is paraded at Isurava village. The men are tired and haggard and receive news that they will be taken off the line and that they have just saved Australia from an imminent invasion. After the speech by the 39th's colonel ([[William McInnes]]), Jack and Darko withdraw with the rest of the soldiers. (The Australians withdrew from Isurava to take up positions at Brigade Hill.) While withdrawing, Jack and Darko spot Max being carried by [[Fuzzy wuzzy angels]] to an aid station. He has survived.

Kuntilanak (film)
 Samantha "Sam" is an orphaned young woman who moves to an isolated boarding house in [[North Jakarta]], trying to avoid the advances of her pervert stepfather. The landlady of the house, Yanti, tells her that the house was previously a [[batik]] factory of Mangkoedjiwo family, with its current leader, Raden Ayu Sri Sukmarahimi Mangkoedjiwo having lent the house under a condition that the second floor is locked up with no one allowed inside. While listing other restrictions, including about a chair in front of a Javanese mirror in Sam's room, Yanti chants ''[[Javanese poetry#Sekar madya and tembang macapat|durmo]]'', a Javanese poem said to be able to summon [[Kuntilanak]], a female ghost with half the body of a horse rumored to be living in a [[weeping fig]] in front of the house. Meanwhile, Sam mentions her recurring nightmares of a woman in a fire with a Kuntilanak to her boyfriend, Agung. Agung learns from his eccentric friend, Iwank, and his mother that the Mangkoedjiwo is long rumored to be a [[black magic]] sect maintaining a Kuntilanak, itself can only be summoned by antique objects. At the house, Sam befriends Dinda, who tells her that there are actually three other mirrors identical to the one in Sam's room: two of which are in herself and Ratih's rooms.   One day, Sam breaks the rule about the mirror, glimpsing a Kuntilanak in the process. Her neighbor, Mawar, who is with her boyfriend (when males are forbidden to step on the third floor), threatens to kill Sam, but Sam suddenly enters a trance and chants durmo, making her puke maggots and materialize a strange scar as well as causing Mawar to have nosebleed. At a motel, Mawar is killed when an electric fan drops on her neck. The next night, Sam tries to peek on the second floor, but is harassed by a neighbor, Alfon. She enters into a trance and chants durmo again. Haunted by terrifying apparitions, Alfon tries to escape but is killed in a car accident. In the light of recent events, Sri Sukma pays visit to the house. Yanti apologizes for her foolish act in introducing durmo to Sam, although Sri Sukma says that it is her destiny to keep it. While reading a book about Mangkoedjiwo factory in Iwank's house, Sam spots the sentence ''Sing kuat sing melihara'' ("the strong one is the one that masters [Kuntilanak]"). During a conflict with Agung, Sam chants durmo; the next day, she learns Agung has disappeared. She hears Agung's faint cries from the second floor. Sam discusses Agung's disappearance with Dinda, but misunderstands Dinda's comfort as her being attracted to Agung. Chanting durmo, Sam passes out when Dinda goes out to take shower where she is killed by Kuntilanak.   Having had enough, Sam breaks over to the second floor and finds Agung bleeding in front of the fourth mirror Dinda previously forgot to mention. She is confronted by Sri Sukma, who explains that the Mangkoedjiwo does indeed maintain a Kuntilanak summoned by a ''wangsit'' (a supernatural mandate) kept by their heirs, but since Sri Sukma is [[Infertility|unable to bear children]], she has chosen Sam as the next carrier of the wangsit. When Sam refuses, Sri Sukma chants durmo to summon Kuntilanak, though Sam counters with her own durmo, eventually winning out when Sri Sukma has nosebleed. Pleading Sam not to kill her, Sri Sukma says that the Kuntilanak can be stopped by removing its entrance to the living world; by breaking all mirrors. Sam manages to break the mirrors in her, Dinda, and Ratih's rooms, but forgets the one in the second floor long enough before Kuntilanak kills Sri Sukma. Two ghost children appear to take Sam, who manages to break free, only to be cornered by Kuntilanak. However, she continuously chants ''Sing kuat sing melihara'' until the Kuntilanak obeys and goes back to the mirror. The next day, Sam decides to keep the mirror so she could use it for her own deeds, disturbing Agung. She happily chants durmo as apparitions of Kuntilanak come out of the mirror.

Draft:Kuntilanak 2 (film)
 After the event [[Kuntilanak (film )|in the previous film]], Sam ([[Julie Estelle]]) has cut her romantic ties with Agung and currently in a great dilemma for struggling to maintain her true self against the dark side within her that are growing strong through the wangsit (supernatural mandate) of Kuntilanak. Her dark side is poised to kill as many people she can by summoning the Kuntilanak. Sam also have recurrent dreams involving the victims murdered by the Kuntilanak, among others were her friend, Dinda, and the leader of the Mangkoedjiwo sect, Sri Sukma ([[Alice Iskak]]), who expresses  regret in her occult involvement pertaining to the  Kuntilanak. Presently, Sam lived in a rental room at the house of a Chinese-descent shop-owner. The family's young daughter, Yenny ([[Cindy Valerie]]), is frightened the moment she set her eyes at Sam, but her parents is puzzled at why. At the other side, the remnants of the sect of Mangkoedjiwo who just lost their leader Sri Sukma, now faced countless problem in their supernatural dealings (the sect operates for occult purposes such as preparing the "tumbal" or sacrifices as required by their client for magic rituals or plain murder-hiring using the Kuntilanak) because they can no longer control the Kuntilanak. The sect followers planned to force Sam who have the wangsit, making her capable of summoning and controlling the Kuntilanak, to join them in order to continue their abominable works by tracking Yanti, Sri Sukma's assistant and former manager of Sam's boarding house who has been hiding since the death of Sri Sukma. Meanwhile, Agung ([[Evan Sanders]]) became mentally disturbed after his experience of being kidnapped by the Kuntilanak. He is advised by his friend, Iwank ([[Ibnu Jamil]]), to find Sam and eliminate his fear from the root by researching the sect of Mangkoedjiwo. One night, Sam call Iwank's telephone and sings the chant. Iwank then died due to accident while cooking at the kitchen, perpetrated by the Kuntilanak. This tragedy motivated Agung to find Sam. Later on, Sam confronted her dark side who tries to took over her body but managed to be kept at bay by her.  After a long search, Agung managed to track down and find Sam who just went home from visiting the tomb of Mega N. Widjoko, her deceased mother. At first Sam didn't want Agung to be involved in the matter, but after been coaxed and thinking on her own, Sam agrees and the couple get back together. Through Iwank's research, Sam and Agung discover the writing of "Oejong Sedo" in the scattered manuscripts of Mangkoedjiwo that is said to be the origin place of the Kuntilanak's wangsit. Sam and Agung later meet Yanti ([[Lita Soewardi]]) who before this contacted Sam via supernatural telepathy, asking the girl to seek her. Yanti then divulges that the Mangkoedjiwo sect is now in frantic moves, searching for Sam to include her into their evil circle. The former also warned Sam of how the Kuntilanak is now unrestrained after the latter has destroyed the gateway mirrors and who may posed deadly threat on her. When Sam asked on how to end the curse, Yanti interjected her question by asking her when is the last time she visit her mother's tomb. Minutes later, three followers from the Mangkoedjiwo sect came and killed Yanti, but afterward Sam sings the chant to summon the Kuntilanak who killed two of them.  Sam and Agung later went to hide at her rental house. They was helped by Yenny's grandfather ([[Sutan Amanullah]]), but he was later revealed to be one of the follower of Mangkoedjiwo sect. After killing Yenny's parent, the followers of Mangkoedjiwo captured Sam, Agung, and Yenny, and the trio were brought to the sect's meeting place. There, Sam was forced to give in to her anger in order for the sect followers to place her under trance and properly summoning the Kuntilanak. Agung was fatally injured while been attacked by one of the sect follower, but he reassured Sam of her true, good inner self before dying. Determined to put an end to the sect, Sam sings the chant and  commanded the Kuntilanak to kill all the followers of Mangkoedjiwo sect while making her escape with Yenny. However when they reached the courtyard, Yenny was snatched by the Kuntilanak, leaving the dumbfounded Sam who suddenly meets her supposedly-dead mother, Mega ([[Ida Iasha]]).

Working off movie [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that Dury is the Symbolist, the smokers are the Guild, and Bell is the Healer.  Heep asks Story how to "practice" for the confrontation but nearly dies in the process, convincing him he's not the Guardian. The next night, Farber's bad advice leads to their plan's immediate failure. In the confusion, Farber is killed and Story is mortally wounded by the Scrunt. Dury suddenly realizes his son Joey ([[Noah Gray-Cabey]]) is the Symbolist. Interpreting the information on cereal boxes, Joey deduces the true Guild is composed of [[7 (number)#In religion|seven]] sisters, that two new men must be present, and that the Healer is male, soon revealed to be Heep. He goes about healing Story by "bringing forth [his] energy" (his repressed grief). Story's departure starts again, but the Scrunt attacks; it is stopped by the gaze of Reggie ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodríguez]]), a lopsidedly muscled tenant who is the true Guardian. Reggie's intense stare and stalking approach compel the Scrunt to slowly retreat, but he is distracted by the cry of the Great Eatlon (a giant eagle who will ferry Story home). When Reggie breaks eye contact, the Scrunt leaps, but the Tartutic arrive and drag it away. Heep thanks Story for saving his life as she hugs him goodbye. The Great Eatlon lands, enfolds Story in one of its wings, and takes flight. The film ends as each tenant watches as she is ferried into the storm.  
The Lake House (film)
 In 2006, Dr. Kate Forrester (Sandra  Bullock) is leaving a lake house that she has been renting in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] to move to [[Chicago]]. Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her mail, adding that the paint-embedded [[pawprint]]s on the path leading to the house were already there when she arrived.  Two years earlier in 2004, Alex Wyler (Reeves), an [[architect]], arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of paw prints anywhere. During the subsequent restoration of the house, a dog runs through Alex's paint and leaves fresh paw prints right where Kate said they would be. Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the paw prints since the house was unoccupied until he arrived. On [[Valentine's Day]] 2006, Kate witnesses a [[traffic accident]] near [[Daley Plaza]] and tries to save the male victim, unsuccessfully. She impulsively drives back to the lake house, finds Alex's letter and writes back.  Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watches its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other. It is in vain as they are alone at the mailbox. They then discover that they are living exactly two years apart. Their correspondence takes them through several events, including Alex finding a book, [[Jane Austen|Jane Austen's]] ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', at a [[train station|railway station]] where Kate said she would have lost it, and Alex taking Kate on a [[walking tour]] of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox. Alex eventually meets Kate at her boyfriend's party but he doesn't mention their exchange of letters to her because she did not "know" him at that time. She later remembered the meeting as a vague memory in the past. For Alex, the meeting happened in the present but for Kate, it had already taken place in the past without her knowing that it was Alex.  As Alex and Kate continue to write each other, they decide to try to meet again. Alex makes a reservation at the Il Mare restaurant for March 2007 — two years into Alex's future, but only a day away for Kate. Kate goes to the restaurant but Alex fails to show. Heartbroken, Kate asks Alex not to write her again, recounting the accident a year before. Both Alex and Kate leave the lake house, continuing on with their separate lives.  On Valentine's Day 2006 for Alex, Valentine's Day 2008 for Kate, he returns to the lake house after something about the day triggers a memory. Meanwhile, Kate goes to an [[architect]] to review the renovation plans for a house she wants to buy. A drawing of the lake house on the conference room wall catches her attention and upon asking, Henry Wyler informs her the artist was his brother, Alex, and Kate realizes that this was the same Alex with whom she had been corresponding. She also learns that Alex was killed in a traffic accident exactly two years ago to the day and realizes why he never showed up for their date - he was the man who died in Daley Plaza.  Rushing to the lake house, Kate frantically writes a letter telling Alex she loves him, but begs him not to try to find her if he loves her back. Wait two years, she says, and come to the lake house instead. Meanwhile, Alex has gone to Daley Plaza to look for Kate.  At the lake house, Kate drops to her knees sobbing, fearing that she has arrived too late to stop Alex. After a long pause, the mailbox flag finally lowers; Alex has picked up her note. Not long afterwards, a familiar mint-green truck pulls up. She walks forward smiling as the driver, clad in jeans and a familiar tan jacket, approaches. She and Alex kiss and walk toward the lake house.

Lage Raho Munna Bhai
 Murli Prasad Sharma alias [[Munna Bhai]], a gangster who is in love with the voice of Janhavi, a radio jockey, devises a plan to meet her when she announces a quiz contest featuring the life and beliefs of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], to be aired on 2 October, the [[Gandhi Jayanti|birthday of Gandhi]]. To prepare for the contest, Munna's sidekick Circuit kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna. After winning the contest, Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein he presents himself as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist. Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in her home, called the 'Second Innings House'. To prepare for this event, Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute. For three days and nights without food or sleep, Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi.  It is during this period he studies so much that he gets hallucinations of Gandhi, which he addresses by his nickname "Bapu" ("father"), appears and offers help and advice to Munna. Gandhi encourages Munna to tell the truth about himself to Janhavi, but Munna resists this advice. With Gandhi's help, Munna succeeds in impressing Jahnavi and cultivates a new [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] based upon [[Gandhism]]. Munna starts to co-host a radio-show with Janhavi and Gandhi's image, guiding his audience to use ''[[Gandhigiri]]'' to solve everyday problems.  Lucky Singh, an unscrupulous businessman, employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct [[Organised crime in India|underworld]] activities for him. His daughter Simran is engaged to marry Sunny, the son of the powerful businessman Kkhurana. Kkhurana is superstitious and his activities are controlled by his astrologer, Batuk Maharaj, whose particular use of [[numerology]] led Kkhurana to add an extra "K" to his real name (Khurana) as well as to the conclusion that the 'Second Innings House' would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live. Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a ''[[Mangal Dosha|manglik]]'' (an individual whose [[Hindu astrology|Vedic astrological]] makeup is believed by some to be devastating for marriage, mostly leading to the death of the spouse after a certain calculated period of marriage). Lucky tricks Kkhurana by saying that one of his typists had entered the wrong time of birth. Lucky appropriates the 'Second Innings House' by sending Munna to Goa (keeping him out of the way) and then blackmailing him to let the matter pass or risk losing his love Janhavi. In response, Munna launches a "non-violent" protest to reclaim the house. He calls this protest "Get Well Soon, Lucky" and asks his radio show's audience to send Lucky flowers to help him recover from the "disease of dishonesty".  During this time Munna tells Janhavi the truth (via a letter he gives to her). Heartbroken, Janhavi leaves Munna. Munna receives another setback when he is tricked by Lucky into revealing his conversations with Gandhi before a public audience. At this conference, Munna finds that only after he has learned something about the real Gandhi's life can the Gandhi image talk about it, which serves as proof for a psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is delusional.  Later, during Sunny and Simran's wedding, it is revealed to Simran that she is a ''manglik'' and she goes to the railway station adorned in her wedding dress to suicide as she does not want to start a relationship based on a lie. But the taxi driver is Victor D'Souza, a man whose problem was solved on Munna's radio show. He explains to her that suicide is not the right choice and contacts Munna for advice. He comes directly to the wedding and cleverly questions the astrological Maharaj and attempts to persuade Kkhurana to allow the marriage to happen. However, Kkhurana is not convinced due to his stubbornness and tells Sunny to leave with him in the car. Nevertheless, Sunny objects and Simran and Sunny exchange garlands.  Gandhi's monologue at the end of the film, however, questions this conclusion. Munna, despite these defeats, continues to use ''Gandhigiri'', a decision that transforms Lucky, revives Janhavi's affection. A Second Innings couple adopt Circuit as their son and Sunny and Simran had a happy life. Lucky, then begins studying Gandhism, Gandhi and Gandhigiri, resulting in him too hallucinating Gandhi. Kkhurana has also removed the extra K in his name to become Khurana only, denying Maharaj's false prediction.

Lady Chatterley (film)
 In an English country house, Sir Clifford Chatterley lives with his wife Constance. Severely wounded in World War I, he is paralysed from the waist down and confined to a wheelchair. Constance tries to be a good wife, but he is distant and her life is empty. One day the maid is ill and Constance goes to see Parkin, the gamekeeper, about some pheasants for the table. Approaching the hut in the woods where he works, she sees him stripped to the waist and washing himself: the sight perturbs her.   She is falling into a depression, for which the doctor says there is no physical cause, urging her to take charge of her life and not give in as her mother did. Told that the first daffodils are blooming in the woods, she ventures out to pick some, but the effort tires her and she has to sit. Parkin grudgingly lets her rest on the steps of the hut, where she falls asleep. Feeling relaxed there, she resolves to visit more often and asks her husband for a duplicate key. He says he has not got one, so Constance asks Parkin, who is reluctant but as an employee has in the end to produce one.   She starts going to the hut regularly, taking an interest in the taciturn Parkin's work. When taking hold of a recently hatched pheasant chick, the tremor of new life in her hand sets Constance weeping uncontrollably. Parkin comforts her and, with her mute assent, has brief forceful sex. He is uneasy afterwards, but Constance feels liberated and starts meeting him secretly for more sessions. As he gets more comfortable with her, their lovemaking becomes more tender and intense, one day cavorting naked in the rain and decorating each other with flowers.  Sir Clifford confronts Constance with a rumour that she is pregnant, which she denies. The two discuss the possibility of her conceiving a child with another man, giving her a baby and Sir Clifford an heir. She says she might do so when she goes on holiday with her sister to the Mediterranean. Taking more of an interest in life, Sir Clifford buys a motorised wheelchair and ventures into the woods, but it gets stuck and stalls. In rage and frustration, he will let nobody help him, though eventually Constance and Parkin do push him home.  Before going off on holiday, Constance spends the whole night with Parkin in his cottage, from which he has cleared all traces of his wife who has gone to live with another man. She tells him she has money from her dead mother and would like to buy him a small farm so that he could be independent. While on holiday, Constance gets a letter from Sir Clifford's nurse with all the local gossip. This includes the news that Parkin's wife, thrown out by her lover, returned to their home. Parkin went to court to get her thrown out, but was told he would have to divorce her first.   Constance heads back to England to find that Sir Clifford has been making further efforts to live more normally and has begun to walk on crutches. She also learns that in a fight with the lover Parkin was beaten up and, because of the scandal, has had to resign as gamekeeper. Going to see Parkin, she tells him she is pregnant, but he is not happy because the child will in law be Sir Clifford's. Having lost his job and his home, he will have to live with his mother and find work in a factory. He talks of emigrating to Canada, but Constance says that is no solution and wants him near her. Eventually he accepts her offer of buying him a small farm and agrees that they must part until the baby is born. If she then decides to leave Sir Clifford, he says he will take her.

The Last King of Scotland (film)
 In 1970, Nicholas Garrigan graduates from medical school at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]. With dull prospects at home, he decides to seek adventure abroad by working at a Ugandan missionary clinic run by Dr. David Merrit and his wife, Sarah. Garrigan becomes attracted to Sarah, who enjoys the attention, but refuses to engage in an [[extramarital affair]].  Meanwhile, General [[Idi Amin]] overthrows incumbent president [[Milton Obote]] in a ''[[coup d'état]].'' Garrigan sincerely believes Amin will help the country, while Sarah warns him of presidents who have taken over before.   Garrigan is called to a minor car accident where he treats Amin's hand. During the incident, Garrigan takes a gun and shoots a mortally wounded cow because no one else has the presence of mind to put it out of its misery. Amin is impressed by his quick action and initiative. Amin, fond of Scotland as a symbol of resilience and admiring of the Scottish people for their resistance to the English, is delighted to discover Garrigan's nationality and exchanges his military shirt for Garrigan's Scotland shirt. Later, Amin invites Garrigan to become his personal physician and take charge of modernising the country's health care system.  Garrigan soon becomes Amin's trusted confidant and is relied on for much more than medical care, such as matters of state. Although Garrigan is aware of violence around [[Kampala]], he accepts Amin's explanation that cracking down on the opposition will bring lasting peace to the country. Garrigan discovers that the polygamous leader has ostracised the youngest of his three wives, Kay, because she has given birth to an epileptic son, Mackenzie. When treating Mackenzie, Garrigan and Kay form a relationship and have sex, but Kay tells him he must find a way to leave Uganda. Eventually, Garrigan begins to lose faith in Amin as he witnesses the increasing paranoia, murders, and xenophobia. Amin replaces Garrigan's [[British passport]] with a Ugandan one to prevent him from escaping, which leads Garrigan to frantically seek help from Stone, the local [[British Foreign Office]] representative. Garrigan is told the British will help him leave Uganda if he uses his position to assassinate Amin, but Garrigan refuses.  Kay informs Garrigan that she has become pregnant with his child. Aware that Amin will murder her for infidelity if he discovers this, she begs Garrigan for a secret abortion. Delayed by Amin's command that he attend a press conference with Western journalists, Garrigan fails to meet Kay at the appointed time. She concludes she has been abandoned and seeks out a primitive abortion in a nearby village, where she is apprehended by Amin's forces. Garrigan finds her dismembered corpse on an autopsy table and falls retching to his knees, finally confronting the inhumanity of Amin's regime and decides killing him will end it all.  [[Operation Entebbe|A hijacked aircraft is flown]] to Entebbe by pro-[[Palestinians|Palestinian]] hijackers seeking asylum. Amin, sensing a major publicity opportunity, rushes to the scene, taking Garrigan along. At the airport, one of Amin's bodyguards discovers Garrigan's plot to poison Amin under the ruse of giving him pills for a headache. Garrigan is beaten by Amin's henchmen before Amin arrives and discloses he is aware of the relationship with Kay. As punishment, Garrigan's chest is pierced with meat hooks before he is hanged by his skin.  Amin arranges a plane for the release of non-[[Israel]]i passengers, and the torturers leave Garrigan unconscious on the floor while they relax in another room. Garrigan's medical colleague, Dr. Junju, takes advantage of the opportunity to rescue him. He urges Garrigan to tell the world the truth about Amin's regime, asserting that the world will believe Garrigan because he is white. Junju gives Garrigan his own jacket, enabling him to mingle unnoticed with the crowd of freed hostages and board the plane. When the torturers discover Garrigan's absence, Junju is killed for aiding in the escape. While Amin is being informed of Garrigan’s escape too late to prevent it, Garrigan boards the plane and tearfully remembers the people of Uganda.  
Last Holiday (2006 film)
 Georgia Byrd ([[Queen Latifah]]), an employee in the cookware department at Kragen's Department Store in [[New Orleans]], is a shy, unassuming woman who longs to cook professionally, and who records her dreams of a better life in a journal labeled "Possibilities". It is the Christmas holiday season. While flirting with a co-worker named Sean Williams ([[LL Cool J]]), she bumps her head on a cabinet door and is taken to the store's health center for a [[CAT scan]]. There she is told by company physician Dr. Gupta ([[Ranjit Chowdhry]]) she has several [[brain tumor]]s resulting from a rare neurological disorder called [[List of fictional diseases#In film|Lampington's Disease]]. Since her [[Health maintenance organization|HMO plan]] will not cover the exorbitant cost of an operation, Georgia resigns herself to the fact she has only a few weeks to live, quits her job, liquidates her assets, and sets off on a dream vacation at the deluxe [[Grandhotel Pupp]] in the spa city of [[Karlovy Vary]] in the Czech Republic.  Free of inhibitions and determined to live life to the fullest, Georgia checks into the Presidential Suite, buys a designer wardrobe in expensive boutiques, makes extensive use of the hotel's spa facilities, attempts snowboarding and [[BASE jumping]] off a dam, enjoys succulent meals prepared by world-renowned Chef Didier ([[Gérard Depardieu]]), and wins a small fortune playing roulette in the casino. She impresses the hotel's staff, with the exception of cantankerous guest services manager Miss Gunther ([[Susan Kellermann]]), with her naive manner and forthright kindness, and mingles with some of the other guests, including Matthew Kragen ([[Timothy Hutton]]), a self-help guru and coincidentally the owner of the store where she works; his assistant/mistress Ms. Burns ([[Alicia Witt]]); pandering Senator Dillings ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) from her home state of Louisiana; and prominent Congressman Stewart ([[Michael Nouri]]). Kragen is skeptical about Georgia's origins and suspects her of trying to sabotage his business, but the rest are charmed by her free spirit.  When Kragen bribes Miss Gunther to dig up information about Georgia's background, she finds a letter Georgia has written providing instructions for the disposal of her remains after her death. Miss Gunther is moved by the letter and realizes Georgia's self-confidence and sunny optimism have touched everyone who has met her since her arrival. She confesses to Georgia she found the letter and urges her to return home and spend her last days with those she loves. Georgia takes Miss Gunther's advice and heads for the airport, only to discover an avalanche has blocked the road. Unbeknownst to her, Sean—having learned of her diagnosis and ready to acknowledge his feelings for her—is in a taxi on the other side of the snowdrift, trying to reach her at the hotel.  Georgia returns to the hotel, and Sean starts across the snow on foot. At a New Year's Eve party that evening, Kragen exposes Georgia as a saleswoman in one of his stores. Georgia tells them that Kragen is right and reveals that she is going to die. Kragen's colleagues, disgusted by his insensitivity, embrace her and abandon him. Dejected and embarrassed, Kragen goes up to an upper floor of the hotel and sits on the ledge contemplating suicide. Georgia tries to persuade him to come down, suggesting if he were nicer and less driven and greedy, he would be a happier person.  Sean arrives at the hotel and joins Georgia and Kragen on the ledge. In the lobby, Miss Gunther finds a fax from Dr. Gupta, in which he tells Georgia she was misdiagnosed due to X-rays generated by a broken, outdated CAT scanner. Miss Gunther rushes up to the ledge to announce the good news. Georgia and Sean return to New Orleans where they later get married and open a restaurant, which is visited by Chef Didier and Georgia's long-time inspiration [[Emeril Lagasse]]. An epilogue sequence shows that Ms. Burns, Ms. Gunther, Dr. Gupta, and Matthew Kragen have all made better lives for themselves and are now happy, with Georgia changing her Book of Possibilities into the Book of Realities.  
Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector
 Larry is a big city health inspector with questionable practices and his own way of doing things. Larry's boss, Bart Tatlock ([[Thomas F. Wilson|Tom Wilson]]), in an attempt to acquire information on his activities in order to get him fired, assigns Larry a new partner, Amy Butlin ([[Iris Bahr]]), a by-the-book professional who takes the job seriously. She tries to learn the ropes of health inspection while putting up with Larry and his personality as well as getting the information Tatlock needs to get Larry fired.  As Larry and Amy do their job as city health inspection team, a serial criminal is poisoning four-star restaurants. Trying to avert a panic, and keep the matter of the poisonings under control, Tatlock puts his best people on the job, and not Larry. Larry and Amy are called in on one of the poisonings, but Tatlock forbids them from working on such an important case. Larry and Amy continue to inspect lower-profile restaurants, but the Mayor Maurice T. Gunn ([[Joe Pantoliano]]) is tricked into assigning Larry and Amy to the more important poison case, much to Larry and Amy's enthusiasm. Larry and Amy go undercover at one of the restaurants, and obtain a tape recording of a conversation between the Mayor Gunn and Chef Leon, in which the chef clarifies the Gunn's request that the food being prepared by Chef Leon be poisoned.  Larry and Amy interrupt the mayor during an interview with their evidence, but the mayor explains that Chef Leon was reacting to the mayor's instruction to put [[French's mustard]] on the Gunn's [[chicken piccata]], an act that the insulted Chef Leon viewed as a metaphorical act of "poisoning" to his life's work. When Larry speaks to Chef Leon over the phone, Chef Leon corroborates this interpretation. As a result, Tatlock fires Larry.  Despondent, Larry visits his old friend Big Shug, but ends up alienating him as well. Heading over to his romantic interest, Jane's ([[Megyn Price]]) house, Larry sees she and her mother ([[Lisa Lampanelli]]) are enjoying a friendly social visit by the mayor. Feeling as if his life has hit rock bottom, Larry resolves to solve the poisoning crimes. He confronts Mayor Gunn, who reveals that Lilly Michelli ([[Joanna Cassidy]]), the owner of Micelli's restaurant, had him make sure that Larry was assigned to the poisonings case. Larry and Amy realize that Michelli did this so to ensure that case was investigated incompetently, as she is the one behind the poisonings. At a taping of the television [[cook-off]] show, ''[[Top Chef]]'', Larry and Amy expose Michelli's culpability and arrest her, and are vindicated.  
Land of the Blind
 Hollander plays Maximilian II (often called ''Junior''), the ignorant, vindictive and petulant ruler of a troubled (but unnamed) country. Maximilian has two main interests: enjoying himself and running his country's movie industry. The output of the nation's film studios under Maximilian is limited to terrible action-adventure schlock with names like ''Out For Vengeance 4''. While it is heavily implied that Junior is a childish sadist, it is conceded that his excesses are only bolstered by the encouragement of his beautiful, yet cruel, wife Josephine (Boyle) and the violence dealt by anti-government terrorists.  Ralph Fiennes plays Joe, a prison warder working at the prison where John Thorne is held at the beginning of the movie. During this early period, Thorne is a wreck, squatting in a shabby cell, enduring frequent beatings from the other guards and writing revolutionary slogans on the walls with his own feces. Joe comes to learn from Thorne and respect him for his bearing and intellect, if not his message. Maximilian, trying to quash spiraling dissent, takes the risk of letting Thorne out of jail, hoping to have him thus become not a great folk hero but another greedy, dishonest politician. Joe, too, is soon promoted to one of the guards at Maximilian's palace and a position in the country's elite military unit. After seeing Junior's madness first hand, it is he who betrays his master by letting Thorne and his followers into the palace's inner chambers while he and Josephine are engaged in a revolting sex game. Thorne shoots the pair, and becomes a ruler governing a country as absolutely totalitarian, if not more so, than the deceased Maximilian. Thorne also encourages separating children from their parents, bans action movies and eliminates imported medicine all while sending the country's professional classes to grim re-education camps. Frightened females cower underneath [[burqa]]-like garments.  For his assistance in assassinating the dictator, Joe is hailed as a hero by Thorne. Nevertheless, as Joe realizes that his one-time friend is just as bad as, if not worse than, his predecessor, he refuses to ally with the new regime. For this, Thorne sends Joe to a re-education camp.  Subjected to numerous cruel beatings and isolation techniques, Joe continually refuses to sign his loyalty oath. At one point Thorne visits but does not recognize his old friend, even after Joe attempts to show him repeatedly who he is. Joe is also accused of being a member of a "hidden" conspiracy within the prison itself. One of his former co-workers, assumedly after being severely beaten, admits to the conspiracy's veracity and accuses Joe of being involved. Joe is quickly brought to the dreaded Room 12. It is there that the audience is revealed to a shocking twist: Joe is accused of never helping Thorne conquer the government, or being a commando in a covert-ops group, but rather a standard recruit in the armed forces discharged after the standard two years. During this, Joe seems to hallucinate heavily, his interrogators becoming characters dead and alive we have seen throughout the film, and is asked once again what is better than a big juicy steak (a recurring question with a wordplay answer). Throughout the scene it is suggested he may be being tortured mentally or is undergoing a paranoid or psychotic episode. His answer to any of the questions asked is never shown.  We then cut to Thorne being killed in his bath by one of his once loyal followers. The revolutionary government is quickly overthrown. Junior's in-laws and nephew are revealed to have escaped during Thorne's revolution and, having lived in exile, have returned to re-establish the old government (with an outside country's assistance). The head of the camp returns to being a doctor and denies having taken part in the tortures and excesses he ordered, while the tortured co-worker that accused Joe of conspiracy is given a government job. This ex-coworker makes a number of empty promises to get Joe out of the camp as soon as the "political climate" settles, but says that his confession to helping murder Maximilian makes him a sensitive case. For having destroyed the old government, but also never having 'played ball' with the new one, Joe is stuck in limbo, in a prison cell until the end of time. Twelve years later, we find Joe writing his memoirs in a white cell resembling that of a prison's or an asylum's, seemingly oblivious even to his daughter's visits. It is possible that he is insane, or that he is perfectly sane, but the woman that visited was an actor pretending to be his daughter to break him down. She leaves Joe writing his memoirs and exits his cell that is really located in some low end residential apartment complex implying that Joe is not a political prisoner but is under some sort of [[house arrest]] being taken care of by the State.  
The Last Drop
 The film is set against the backdrop of [[World War II]], during [[Operation Market Garden]], the largest full scale [[airborne forces|airborne]] [[invasion]] in history. Corporal Powell ([[Neil Newbon|Newbon]]), an [[undercover]] [[British Intelligence]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], has been given command of a small unit of men, codenamed Matchbox. Their assignment is to retrieve a hoard of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] gold and art treasures, plundered by the [[Nazis]], from a seemingly impregnable booby-trapped underground bunker. Simple enough, but when Matchbox is shot down short of the drop point their plan goes awry and Powell is forced to recruit the assistance of several colorful characters, including a smart-mouthed petty thief ([[Nick Moran|Moran]]), a drunken bomb disposal expert ([[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Flanagan]]), and a smooth talking pilot with a keen eye for smooth ladies ([[Billy Zane|Zane]]).  As Powell and his roving band of misfits fight their way through [[Germany|German]] [[counterattack]], members of the [[Dutch resistance]] ([[Lucy Gaskell|Gaskell]] and [[Coral Beed|Beed]]) have managed to pinpoint the location of the stolen loot, where it is about to be moved to [[Berlin]]  by the vile SS Major Kessler ([[Laurence Fox|Fox]]) and his troops. Risking their lives, they communicate this vital information to British Intelligence in a courageous attempt to liberate the occupied [[Netherlands]]. At the same time, renegade German forces race to get their hands on the loot as well. It’s a race against the clock, in the midst of a heated battle, ending with an enthralling climax.

The Last Kiss (2006 film)
 Michael and his live-in girlfriend Jenna appear to have the perfect relationship. Jenna is ten weeks pregnant, and her parents are pressuring the pair to get married, but Jenna claims that Michael's work pressures and her working on her dissertation render it an inopportune time for marriage. The real reason, unbeknownst to anyone, is that Michael feels trapped and scared. Although he considers Jenna an ideal companion, Michael is having second thoughts.  In a chance encounter at a wedding, Michael meets Kim, to whom he confides about his relationship. Kim guesses he is about to break up with Jenna and becomes flirtatious. While Michael is intrigued by Kim's youthfulness, openness, and spirit, he does not succumb to temptation. The two part ways with Kim telling Michael where she attends school and when and where she usually hangs out.  Michael eventually seeks her out at the [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|Memorial Union]] but tells Kim he was in the area only because of a client meeting. Kim senses his romantic interest and, while Michael drives her home, invites him to a party. Michael accepts. Back in the office, Michael constructs an excuse to be away from Jenna on the night of the party. He asks Chris, his friend and co-worker, to cover for him in case Jenna calls. Chris suspects Michael has met another woman and wishes to avoid becoming involved, as Chris himself has just left his wife; he knows first hand how painful a breakup can be. Michael denies the existence of another woman and merely says he will "be with an old college friend."  After the party with Kim—who Michael says makes him "feel ten years younger"—the two kiss several times, preceding Kim inviting Michael to her dorm for the night. Guilt over cheating on Jenna prevails over temptation, however, and he refuses. Unfortunately for Michael, the father of their mutual friend Izzy dies that night. Several friends and acquaintances, including Jenna and Chris, go to Izzy's home with their condolences. There, Jenna realizes Michael had not been, as he claimed, with Chris. Jenna confronts Chris but Chris refuses to answer her questions, which only fuels Jenna's suspicions that Michael has indeed gone astray.  When Michael arrives home that night, Jenna becomes confrontational;  Michael at first denies he was out with Kim, but eventually admits he had seen another woman. Although he points out he didn't sleep with her and that the outing meant nothing, Jenna is too enraged to believe him and kicks him out of the house, threatening him with a [[chef's knife]].  Alone, depressed, and desperate, Michael receives a call from Kim. Kim apologizes for being demanding earlier and asks him to come over for conversation only. Michael agrees. Upon arrival, the pair immediately have sex.  The next morning, Michael tries sneaking away without waking Kim but notices once he gets out the door that he left his keys behind. Upon his return, Kim demands to know why he hadn't said goodbye. Michael tells her simply that he did not want to wake her, as he had to be at work early. Kim takes the missing keys out of her pocket and returns them after Michael promises to call her.  At work, Michael plans on leaving early to seek out Jenna. On his way out, Kim visits his office unannounced, wanting to give him a mix CD.  Michael confides he still loves Jenna, who he informs Kim is pregnant with his baby. He apologizes to Kim for not telling her, and leaves her in search of Jenna.  Michael pulls up to Jenna's parents' home, and Jenna's father Stephen, gives a stern lecture about commitment and adulthood and offers advice on winning Jenna’s forgiveness. Stephen urges Michael to be completely honest and never stop trying. Equipped with his wisdom, Michael goes into Jenna's room. On the verge of reconciliation, Jenna asks if he was telling the truth about having sex with Kim. Michael says he was telling the truth (at the time)—but as a result of Stephen's advice he confesses he went back later that night. Despite Michael's pleas that he was just being honest, Jenna nonetheless becomes outraged and inconsolable, storming out of the house and back to their apartment.  Michael follows her back and finds himself locked out. He stakes out on the front porch until Jenna agrees to talk. Both day and night, wet and dry, Michael remains at the front door with many neighbors taking notice and some even providing beverages to him. Stephen even proceeds to drive by in his car and notices Michael, who sees him. A proud smile develops on his face as he drives off, acknowledging that Michael has taken his advice seriously. Slowly, she begins to relent, first tossing out a blanket during a cold evening, then dropping off a sandwich the next day. During the evening of what would have been his third night on the porch, Jenna breaks her silence and speaks to Michael through the closed door. She compares the painful "last romantic kiss" to her grandmother's death. She says it was a kiss with very painful feeling, and she laments about mourning the loss of the romantic relationship like the loss of someone's life. Later that evening, Jenna opens the door and Michael goes inside.

The Last Time (film)
 Ted Ryker ([[Michael Keaton]]) is the top salesman in the [[New York City|New York]] office of business machine company Bineview. The corporate stock lives by quarterly sales numbers, the competition is very intense, and the economy may be headed into a downturn. Ted's company is marking time until a revolutionary new product is ready, probably within a few months. Some competitors may know something about this secret innovation, through industrial [[espionage]], and fear its impact on the market.  A new company hire, callow [[Midwestern]]er Jamie Bashant ([[Brendan Fraser]]), has moved east with his lovely fiancée Belisa ([[Amber Valletta]]). Jamie and Belisa are a young couple just starting out, and Jamie has to learn the business as a trainee. Ted is very successful, but also cynical, hard-driving, profane, obnoxious, abusive, and a lousy team player. He has few if any friends in the company, but his shortcomings are tolerated because his output is so outstanding. Ted, assigned to train Jamie, watches Jamie struggle, failing with presentation after presentation; Ted tries, in vain, to help Jamie improve his performance and make a few sales, even giving one of his own sure deals to Jamie, who messes it up. Bashant and Ryker head to the sales conference and Ryker runs into Leguzza. Then, Ted is introduced to Belisa through normal company friendship, and discovers that he is now in love with her. Belisa is impressed by Ted's success and confident manner and also falls in love with him. They then have sex, and do their best to keep this secret from Jamie, who is worried about being fired because of his weak output. Ted and Belisa then go to Ted's place and sleep with each other, before going to [[Atlantic City]], and having sex in a hotel room. Ted confesses to Belisa that he has a failed love in his past, which affected him very deeply, leading to a career switch from college literature [[professor]] at [[Northwestern University]] near [[Chicago]] (a job he loved) to hard-driving star salesman in New York. Belisa does her best to comfort him. Later that night in bed after sex, the two discover a shared interest in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', which Belisa studied at college and Ted taught every semester.  Ted spends increasingly more time with Belisa and away from the office. Ted is falling hard for Belisa, who postpones her wedding to Jamie; the couple had planned a honeymoon to [[Jamaica]] and decides to marry Ted. But Ted's sales performance is dropping dramatically, and since his contribution to the company's profit is so important, the rest of the sales force feels even more pressure. Branch manager John Whitman ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) has prospered with Ted's performance, but starts losing confidence in Ted, and is mystified at Ted's lack of dedication, such a contrast from his previous strong effort. Belisa seems ready to end her engagement to Jamie in favor of Ted, as the two travel to [[Atlantic City]] for a getaway from the stress, and use Jamie's week-long absence at a training conference to deepen their relationship. However, the company is in trouble from plummeting sales, not just in New York but at its other locations as well, and downsizing and firings are imminent. Just as Ted's new relationship with Belisa is prospering, his career is sinking. He no longer cares about his career; he avoids the office, doesn't answer his phone or return messages, fails to close several critical deals, and this drives the company closer to ruin. However, his relationship with Belisa, who now promises to leave Jamie and get married to Ted, is creating real change in his life, healing his bitterness. Jamie, showing no improvement whatsoever in his job performance is fired just as Belisa breaks their engagement and asks him to move out. He becomes suspicious that Belisa is cheating on him and nears a [[nervous breakdown]]. Belisa becomes very concerned and meets with Ted to break off their affair so she can take care of Jamie, informing him they are returning to [[Ohio]] together tomorrow. Ted is devastated at Belisa's change of heart, but finally returns to the office the next day to find manager Whitman desperate for him to make some sales as his own career is on the line. Belisa surprises Ted in the parking lot, telling him Jamie went back to Ohio, but she has decided to stay in New York to marry him.  Ted goes to the office to find the company has been taken over by a competing firm that was able to buy the company cheap because poor sales at all the offices lowered the stock price drastically. The office is being closed with dozens of staff personnel being fired, including Manager Whitman. Despite the news, Ted is happy and leaves to go see Belisa at her home. When he gets there she is gone and her house is now empty except for a few boxes stacked in the living room. In the boxes Ted finds evidence that Jamie and Belisa were actually working together to destroy his sales performance. Jamie and Belisa are seen at a party with the president of the competing firm which has just purchased Bineview. It is revealed that the bumbling Jamie is actually a ruthless leader of a team of [[double agent]]s sent by this competing firm to infiltrate Bineview. The top salesperson at each office has been targeted by one of the double agents, each having their sales performance ruined in different ways, as part of a strategy to weaken the company in preparation for this corporate takeover.  Leguzza explains how he desired to purchase a company but wanted to get it at a cheap price. So  he put together a group to cull the company the animals in order to weaken their sales so he would be able to purchase the company. As Jamie explains how he and Belisa were able to distract Ted, destroying his sales performance, his gloating clearly disgusts Belisa who realises that Ted is her true boyfriend. She leaves the party to go to Ted who is seen packing up all his belongings. Jamie confronts his true employer, the corporate shark who masterminded the whole stratagem to gain control of a new, innovative, Bineview business machine, and demands his money using knowledge of the employer's embarrassing sexual proclivity as blackmail. When Belisa arrives at Ted's loft he is already gone, so she goes to her home to find him. As Ted is shown on the road to an unknown destination, she discovers a personal message from Ted in a volume of Wilde's novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' which he has left behind for her. With the knowledge that Ted knows the truth and is taking a break from her, Belisa is left broken-hearted. The movie closes with a smiling and contented Ted arriving at [[Northwestern University]] to return to the job he truly loves, teaching.  
Last Rites of the Dead
  An unexplained zombie plague breaks out, causing the recently deceased to continue walking the earth. Despite being undead, the zombies retain all of their senses and wits, including the ability to speak and think rationally. The only way to kill a zombie is to completely destroy the brain, preferably with shotgun or explosives. An international crisis develops and the world breaks up into several camps, including anti zombie militants, and zombie sympathizers.  On the first night of the outbreak, a young woman named Angela (Gina Ramsden) is shot in the head by her jealous boyfriend Josh (Joshua Nelson), turning her into one of the walking dead.  A few months later, as the world poorly adjusts to this new reality, Angela finds herself alone, depressed and suppressing a deep urge to eat human flesh.   She is attacked on the street by zombie hating strangers;  fired from her job by her boss ([[Sally Pressman]]) after a co-worker complains about her smell and appearance; she even begins to cover herself in a special brand of make-up for zombies called "Look-Alive". She finds comfort in a passive zombie support group called "Hugs for the Mortally Challenged" where she confesses her shame in being a zombie.  Meanwhile, Josh and his friends, Richie (J. Scott Green), Peter "Gooch" Guccione (Gaetano Iacono) and Malcolm (Constantine Josiah Taylor) join a radical zombie hate group, run by a ruthless army brat known only as The Commandant (Christa McNamee) where they commit several violent acts against zombies.  Josh, who still has feelings for Angela, hesitates in telling the Commandant, or his friends, about his undead ex-girlfriend. Josh and Angela have several run-in's as he calls her, stalks her, and openly expresses his love for her, much to her horror. Angela, in the meantime, finds herself being courted by one of the more outspoken members of her support group, Louis (Kevin Collins). Louis ultimately brings Angela into a new, far more radical cult of zombies who advocate zombie pride and practice the eating of human flesh. This cult is led by a zombie flower child named The Good Mother Solstice (Mary Jo Verruto), and appears to be responsible for acts of domestic terrorism. An early clash between the cult and the Commandant's army leaves several zombies as well as Richie dead. Angela survives the assault by hiding, but, in a moment of weakness, she devours the entrails of a disemboweled girl before she flees.  Ultimately, Josh breaks down and leads the Commandant to Angela's "Hugs for the Mortally Challenged" group, and most of them are taken out to the woods and beheaded. Angela is rescued by the Good Mother Solstice and her army of undead terrorists. Most of the Commandant's army is killed in the ensuing battle, although the Commandant and Malcolm escape unharmed. Josh escapes, only to realize he has been shot and is now one of the walking dead.  Angela awakens to find herself in Solstice's compound, where she is tied to the floor, drugged with a euphoria inducing concoction of liquified human flesh, and nearly brainwashed by Solstice and her chanting zombies. At the same time, the Commandant, distraught at losing her army, finds Josh and Malcolm, asking for their help in seeking revenge. When Malcolm refuses, he is shot dead. Josh agrees and calls Angela, luring the Good Mother Solstice and her army to his house.  The Commandant, who appears to be suffering from a nervous breakdown, disguises herself by chopping off her hair and dying it blonde. She shoots herself in the head, turning herself into one of the undead and poses as a victim of her own anti-zombie group.  She is eventually taken into Solstice's compound where she wreaks havoc. Josh follows her there, and sets off to kill Angela. As the Commandant fights her way through Solstice's zombie army, and Josh struggles to fight his way into the compound, Angela escapes from her bonds and battles with the Good Mother Solstice eventually injecting her with a full dose of her liquid flesh concoction, causing an overdose with messy results. Commandant ultimately kills most of Solstice's army, but not before being disemboweled and left partially paralyzed. Josh and Angela battle, and Angela blows Josh's leg off with a shotgun and castrates him.  Angela leaves, with Josh still professing his love for her. The Commandant turns up and blows Josh's head off with her shotgun, and then turns the gun on herself.  Angela returns to her home,  finds her LookAlive makeup has run off, leaving her pale zombie flesh exposed. She discards the rest of her LookAlive makeup and smiles.

The Last Winter (2006 film)
 The American oil company KIK Corporation is building an ice road to explore the remote northern [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] seeking [[United States energy independence|energy independence]]. Independent [[environmentalists]] work together in a drilling base headed by the tough Ed Pollack in a sort of agreement with the [[government]], approving procedures and sending reports of the operation. When one team member is found dead and naked on the [[snow]], the environmentalist James Hoffman suspects that [[sour gas]] ([[natural gas]] containing [[hydrogen sulfide]]) may have been leaked out as a result of [[runaway climate change]] ([[arctic methane release]]).  The sour gas might then be provoking [[hallucination]]s and [[insanity]] in the group.  After a second fatal incident, he convinces Ed to travel with the team to a [[hospital]] for examination. However, weird events end up trapping the group at the base.  One of the characters presently opines that Nature itself has turned against mankind. [[Documentation]] and research found in an abandoned [[shack]] in the middle of the Arctic by another team member suggest that the [[Earth]] is releasing 'The Last Winter'. This implies that the rapacious, virus-like behavior of oil-seeking humans has resurrected the 'ghosts' of the fossil-fuels being siphoned out of the ground. The chief catalyst here is allegedly the Spirit of the [[Wendigo]]. These ghosts and other bizarre occurrences kill off most of the remaining characters. In the penultimate scene, Hoffman must decide whether to fire a [[flare gun]] at a ghost stalking Pollack, or up into the air to summon help from a nearby town, opting for the latter. This action causes the [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] to focus on Hoffman instead of Pollack, and it grabs him and carries him off.  The scene then segues into a montage of past life images which interrupt themselves long enough to reveal Pollack being attacked and presumably killed by a trio of spectral creatures.  The ending scene is that of the only surviving researcher,  Abby Sellers, waking up alone in a deserted hospital with no recollection of arriving there. A news anchorman is broadcasting over a television in the waiting room about natural disasters occurring nationwide. She discovers a male [[employee]] who has committed [[suicide]] by [[hanging]] himself in one of the rooms. She proceeds outside, and the camera's perspective switches to a claustrophobic overhead shot that gives away very little of what she is witnessing. There are pools of [[water]] on the ground nearby. In the background she hears car alarms and the sound of the wind, as well as a fluttering noise similar to that made by the murderous "ghost" creatures further north in the Alaskan snow fields.  
The Legend of Seven Cutter
 The "Seven Cutter" is a legendary fighter throughout various high schools within Korea. His name is Jung Han-soo and he remains unbeaten by the toughest fighters from many different schools.

When a high schooler named Jung Han-soo arrives at Seong Ji High School, he is instantly mistaken for the "Seven Cutter." An innocent kid, at first he is blissfully unaware of why the other students are giving him such an icy reception. So when the toughest boy at Seong Ji High School challenges him to a battle for the title of the toughest guy in school, he has no choice but defend himself and fight. Then, when he accidentally wins, things start getting really confusing for him.  Soon, Han-soo meets tomboy Han Min-joo, who is not just a great, skilled boxer, but a tough, hard-to-deal-with knockout as well. After a few coincidences that make him look like a pervert, she also asks him for a battle for revenge. He defends himself by pretending to have a crush on her, even though he likes the pretty, but snotty, girl in school. Min-joo decided to accept his "love," and eventually starts to like his unique personality. Later, when Han-soo finally realizes he has fallen for her, Min-joo is heart-broken to find out that he likes the pretty girl, and that he never liked her. Then the bad guys arrive and try to kidnap Min-joo.

Left in Darkness
 A young woman, whose mother died giving birth to her, is facing eternal life in either Heaven or Hell. She must make the choice who to listen to, her guardian angel, whom she met when she was a child, or the evil ones.  
Leroy & Stitch
 With their mission to capture all 624 experiments and repurpose them on Earth completed, Lilo, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley are honored as heroes by the Galactic Alliance. Jumba is given the confiscated key to his laboratory again, Pleakley is offered a post as chairman of Earth Studies at G.A.C.C. (Galactic Alliance [[community college|Community College]]), and Stitch is made the Captain of the Galactic Armada and commander of his newly commissioned ship BRB-9000 (Big Red Battleship 9000). Lilo is made Galactic Federation [[Ambassador]] to Earth and sole guardian of Stitch's "cousins". Before they leave, Lilo gives Jumba her favorite Elvis record, Pleakley a [[paperweight]] (which is actually an Earth rock) and Stitch a necklace with a [[Kū]] [[tiki]] (the [[Hawaiian mythology|Hawaiian god]] of strength).  In his ship, [[Gantu]] has decided that since he failed in capturing all of the experiments (except for 625), he will break [[Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel|Dr. Hämsterviel]] out of prison. He takes the two-man [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]], leaving 625 alone and helps Hämsterviel escape from prison. Stitch is then assigned to recapture Hämsterviel. Hämsterviel and Gantu burst into Jumba's lab and force Jumba to create an evil twin of Stitch, [[Leroy (Lilo & Stitch)|Leroy]], to defeat the Galactic Alliance. Stitch arrives and after a fight, he is defeated when Pleakley appears at an inopportune moment, distracting Stitch long enough for Leroy to lock him in a glass [[:wikt:capsule|capsule]]. Hämsterviel reveals his plans to [[Clone (genetics)|clone]] an army of Leroys to take over the Galactic Alliance. Before leaving for Turo, Hämsterviel locks Jumba, Pleakley and Stitch in Pleakley's ship, and sends the vessel into a [[black hole]].  On Earth, Lilo decides to contact Stitch. Lilo realizes that the only intergalactic [[videophone]] on the planet available is in Gantu's ship. There, she finds 625 and asks to use the videophone. However, 625 says it is broken. Lilo then names 625 "[[Reuben (Lilo & Stitch)|Reuben]]". He thereafter consents to help Lilo. Once the videophone is fixed, Lilo contacts the BRB-9000. Leroy impersonates Stitch, using shape-shifting to disguise himself, but fails because he does not have Stitch's tiki necklace. Hämsterviel then commands Leroy to go to Earth and capture all of the other experiments to destroy them. Lilo, sensing Stitch is in trouble, asks Reuben for help in fixing Gantu's ship. As Jumba, Pleakley, and Stitch head towards the black hole, Stitch escapes and frees the others. However, the navigational computer is locked on course for the black hole and will teleport them to a volcanic planet where they will be vaporized, but if they can disrupt the [[event horizon]] by throwing a small object into the black hole, it will send them somewhere else. Pleakley pulls out the rock that Lilo gave him and asks if this will work. After Jumba says it is too heavy, Stitch takes a bite out of it, then crawls out the front of the vehicle and throws it at the black hole. There is a flash and the vehicle is sucked in.  On Earth, a Leroy clone obtains Lilo's scrapbook of "cousins" and quickly captures all of them (along with Mertle). Lilo and Reuben arrive at Turo, but they are too late; Hämsterviel has taken over, making the Grand Councilwoman his receptionist, and orders Gantu to lock them up. Gantu imprisons Lilo and Reuben, but decides to release them after Hämsterviel threatens to fire him. After a close call with several Leroy clones, they are trapped. All is lost until the G.A.C.C. van suddenly appears. With no time to explain, Lilo, Reuben and Gantu all climb in and head for Earth. On Earth, the original Leroy has herded all the experiments into a [[Aloha Stadium|large stadium]] where "Alohapalooza" will take place. The BRB-9000 appears and Hämsterviel prepares to obliterate all of the experiments, until a timely appearance by Lilo, Stitch and the others and destroy the BRB's primary cannon. Hämsterviel reveals that he brought along his Leroy army as backup. Stitch rallies his "cousins" and the battle begins. Despite some initial victories by the experiments, it soon becomes apparent that the adversaries are better than them. Jumba remembers that he programmed a secret shutdown command into Leroy: If he plays [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Aloha 'Oe]]", the others will deactivate. Stitch appears on-stage in his Elvis attire and plays "Aloha 'Oe" with Lilo and Reuben accompanying him, causing the Leroys to have violent [[seizures]] and shut down. With his plan foiled (again), Hämsterviel is recaptured.  Back at the Galactic Alliance HQ, they are proclaimed "Heroes of the Alliance." Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley ask to be allowed to return to Earth with Lilo. The Grand Councilwoman grants this and asks Gantu if he would like to be reinstated as the Captain of the Armada. Gantu agrees on the condition that Reuben be assigned as his galley officer. Back on Earth, Lilo sets up for one last picture. Mertle arrives with Gigi (during the battle, Mertle was with Gigi and was astounded when she found that Gigi could talk, being one of Jumba's experiments). Lilo's last picture in the album is of all of the experiments still on Earth, Mertle, Jumba, Pleakley, Nani, David and herself. Meanwhile, Hämsterviel is sent back to prison along with Leroy and all of his clones, who have recovered from their seizures, and are dancing to the song "[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]". As the credits roll, a full list of Jumba's experiments 001 through 626, and the names they were given by Lilo (and other characters in some instances during ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''), scrolls along the left side of the screen.  
Let's Go to Prison
 John Lyshitski ([[Dax Shepard]]) has spent most of his life in prison, serving three different sentences. Each of his three trials were before Judge Nelson Biederman III, who habitually imposed resentfully tough sentences. After being released from his third sentence, John decides to take revenge on Biederman. John tries to determine when Biederman will be presiding over his next case, only to discover that Biederman died three days before John's release.  He turns his attention to the judge's brash son, Nelson Biederman IV ([[Will Arnett]]). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John breaks into Nelson's [[BMW]], wrecks the interior and empties Nelson's emergency [[inhaler]]. After the ceremony, Nelson drives off and, finding his inhaler empty, [[Panic attack|panics]] and [[Hyperventilation|hyperventilates]]. He stops at a pharmacy and frantically searches through the shelves, desperately seeking a replacement for the empty inhaler, which he finds and immediately opens to use. The pharmacy owners think he's a [[Substance dependence|junkie]] seeking a fix. One owner mistakes the inhaler for a tiny [[pistol]] and calls the police.  Nelson is arrested and charged with assault and armed robbery. He demands that the Biederman Foundation do everything possible to have him acquitted. The board nearly complies with Nelson's demands, but, as they are fed up of him and his behaviour, they see an opportunity to be rid of him. They get him a terrible defense lawyer for the trial. Nelson is found guilty and sentenced to three to five years. John, not satisfied with Nelson merely going to prison, decides to join him in prison by committing a crime. At his trial before the same judge Nelson had, John pleads guilty and asks for the same sentence (3–5 years) at the same prison that Nelson is in. He manages to become Nelson’s cellmate, pretends to be his friend, and gives Nelson terrible advice on surviving life in prison.   Nelson gets himself out of the many situations that John's misinformation creates. He meets gang leader Barry ([[Chi McBride]]), an imposing, brawny [[Homosexuality|gay]] fellow who coerces Nelson into a relationship. Despite his intimidating appearance, Barry is a sensitive romantic – he likes smooth [[jazz]], he supplies potential romantic partners with his finest toilet-made [[Merlot]], and he has transformed his prison cell into a candle-lit, rose-bedecked passion parlour.  Nelson gets into a mess with the prison's "top dog" Lynard ([[Michael Shannon]]), who promises to kill him. Nelson instead gets his hands on a deadly chemical and a syringe with the intent of using it to commit [[suicide]]. Before he can do so, however, Nelson is attacked by Lynard in his cell, and just before Lynard can beat him to death he spots the syringe, assumes it to be heroin and injects himself with it, accidentally killing himself and earning Nelson the respect of and authority over his fellow prisoners, who believe Nelson had done the deed. Nelson reaches his one-year parole hearing not only relatively unharmed, but the new "top dog" in the prison hierarchy, after "killing" Lynard. Nelson, who initially submits to being Barry's partner out of fear, grows to care for Barry and continues to play along with the "relationship" to keep him happy, as well as safe from Lynard's former cronies who attack him in an effort to protect Nelson. However, John will not allow his target to escape prison so easily. He manages to get Nelson's parole denied. Enraged, Nelson confronts John who then confesses to putting Nelson in jail. The two get into a fight. John quickly realizes that he is now Nelson's target. The guards set up a death match between the two. However, John and Nelson secretly hatch a plan to inject each other with a [[coma]]-inducing drug. The guards and prisoners, believing that they are dead, bury the pair in the graveyard. Nelson, who had legally [[Adoption|adopted]] Barry to allow him to retake control of the Biederman Foundation, has Barry bribe the mortician to skip the autopsy. Barry later digs up John and Nelson. John, Nelson and Barry begin a new chapter of life, starting a [[winery]] (the product being "toilet wine").  The film ends with Nelson, Barry, and John now the best of friends, happily living free life in society.  
Lethal Angels
  A group of women with traumatic pasts who have been wronged by various men or groups are taken under the protection of a slightly older woman ([[Fei Lei]]), herself once beaten to a [[miscarriage]]. She trains these once mistreated women as [[professional killer]]s, using their looks to get close to targets, and sends them out on missions of [[revenge|vengeance]] against the people who wronged them. Their latest mission includes the killing of a 6-year-old girl, and one of the women ([[Tien Hsin]]) tries to find a way to avoid it. She is recognized by a young police officer investigating the murders as his college almost-girlfriend, and he approaches her with the intention of getting her to surrender to the police. In the end, two befriended women find that not all is as it seems, and that vengeance without conscience is worse than the acts committed by their targets. Deception, reversals, and betrayal on all fronts fill this journey into the minds of the abused and the world of the dark art of vengeance killing.  
Letters from Iwo Jima
 In 2005, Japanese [[archaeologist]]s explore tunnels on [[Iwo Jima]], where they find something in the dirt.  The scene changes to [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] in 1944. [[Private (rank)|Private First Class]] Saigo and his [[platoon]] are digging beach trenches on the island. Meanwhile, [[Lieutenant General]] [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] arrives to take command of the garrison and immediately begins an inspection of the island defenses. He saves Saigo and his friend Kashiwara from a beating by Captain Tanida for 'unpatriotic speeches', and orders the men to begin tunneling underground defenses into [[Mount Suribachi]]. Kuribayashi and [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Kazoku|Baron]] [[Takeichi Nishi]], a famous [[Olympic medalist|Olympic gold medalist]] [[show jumping|show jumper]], clash with some of the other officers, who do not agree with Kuribayashi's [[defense in depth]] strategy: Kuribayashi believes the US will take the beaches quickly, and that the mountain defenses will have a better chance for holding out.  Poor nutrition and unsanitary conditions take their toll; many die of [[dysentery]], including Kashiwara. The troops begin using the caves. Kashiwara's replacement, [[Army ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II|Superior Private]] Shimizu, arrives for duty. Saigo suspects that Shimizu is a spy from the [[Kempeitai]] sent to report on disloyal soldiers.  Soon, American aircraft and warships begin to appear and bombard the island, causing significant casualties. A few days later, the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] land. The American troops suffer heavy casualties, but the beach defenses are quickly overcome, as Kuribayashi predicted, and the attack turns to the positions on [[Mount Suribachi]]. While delivering a request for more machine guns from his commander to the Suribachi garrison, Saigo overhears Kuribayashi radioing orders to retreat. The commander, however, ignores the General and instead orders his company to commit suicide. Saigo runs away with Shimizu, convincing him to continue the fight rather than die. They find two other soldiers, but one is incinerated by an American flamethrower, and they witness a captured Marine being bayoneted to death.  Saigo and the soldiers in Mount Suribachi try to flee with Lt. Colonel Oiso at night, but they run into Marines, who wipe out all except Saigo and Shimizu. They flee to friendly lines, but are accused by Lieutenant Ito of [[desertion]]. Ito raises his [[katana]] to execute them for cowardice, but Kuribayashi arrives and saves Saigo again by confirming his order to retreat.  The Japanese attack US positions but take heavy losses. The survivors are told to regroup with Colonel Nishi while Ito heads to the US lines with three mines, intending to throw himself under a tank. Nishi converses in English with a captured Marine, Sam, until Sam eventually dies from his wounds. Later, blinded by shrapnel, Nishi orders his men to withdraw and asks Lieutenant Okubo to leave him a rifle. Upon leaving, the soldiers hear a gunshot from Nishi's cave.  Saigo plans surrender, and Shimizu reveals that he was dishonorably discharged from the Kempeitai because he disobeyed an order to kill a civilian's dog. Shimizu escapes and surrenders to Americans, but is later [[United_States_war_crimes#World_War_II|shot dead by his guard]]. Meanwhile, Ito, desperate and malnourished, breaks down and, when found by the US Marines, surrenders. Okubo is killed as he and his men arrive at Kuribayashi's position. Saigo meets up with Kuribayashi, and one last attack is planned. Kuribayashi orders Saigo to destroy all documents, including his own letters, saving Saigo's life a third time.  That night, Kuribayashi launches a final surprise attack. Most of his men are killed, and Kuribayashi is critically wounded, but Kuribayashi's loyal aide Fujita drags him away. The next morning, Kuribayashi orders Fujita to behead him; however, Fujita is shot dead by a Marine sniper before he can do so. Saigo appears, having buried some of the documents and letters instead of burning them all. Kuribayashi asks Saigo to bury him where he will not be found, then draws his pistol, an American [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] &mdash; a gift Kuribayashi was given in the US before the war &mdash; and commits suicide. A tearful Saigo then buries him.  Later, a US patrol find Fujita's body. One Marine officer finds Kuribayashi's pistol and tucks it under his belt. They search the area and find Saigo with his shovel. Seeing the pistol in the Marine lieutenant's belt, Saigo becomes furious and attacks the Americans with his shovel. Too weak to fight, he is knocked unconscious and taken to the [[Prisoner of war|POW]] beach. Awakening on a stretcher, he glimpses the setting sun and smiles grimly.  Back in 2005, the archeologists complete their digging, revealing the bag of letters that Saigo had buried, and open it. As the letters spill out, the voices of the Japanese soldiers who wrote them resound.  
Libertas (film)
 [[File:Libertas Medvesek Ceccarelli.gif|thumb|left|A romance between Marin Držić and Countess Deša forms a major subplot in the second half of the film.<ref name="Nacional"/>]] The film is set in mid-16th century, at a time when the entire eastern [[Mediterranean]] is dominated by two great empires, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], with the small but wealthy [[maritime republic]] of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]] (modern-day [[Dubrovnik]]) managing to maintain its independence through diplomatic agreements.  The film opens with a scene of playwright [[Marin Držić]]'s ([[Sven Medvešek]]) comedy ''Dundo Maroje'' being staged in front of the [[Rector's Palace, Dubrovnik|Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik]], during the traditional Feast of St. Blaise. Local aristocrats, ambassadors and the Rector himself ([[Miše Martinović]]) are attending the performance of the [[Comedy (drama)|comedy play]], which is an [[allegory]] about the hypocrisy and injustice of high society. The verses spoken on stage are met with disapproval by the noblemen present, and lead to the Rector getting up and leaving during the performance.  The Ragusan [[Éminence grise|grey eminence]], state censor Luka ([[Goran Grgić]]), decides to use this opportunity to crack down on Držić's company. Luka first confronts his [[patronage|patron]] Lord Zamagna ([[Radko Polič]]), a nobleman and former vice-admiral of the mighty Ragusan trade fleet. Luka charges him with conspiracy and gets him arrested. Zamagna's daughter Deša ([[Sandra Ceccarelli]]), a noblewoman and wife of the Spanish [[ship-owner]] De Cabrera, unsuccessfully tries to free her father, who eventually dies in a Ragusan dungeon.  Enraged by her father's demise, Deša joins the anti-government conspirators led by Lord Bučinić ([[Ljubomir Kerekeš]]) who plot against the Senate (the Ragusan parliament), and, hoping to gain political support abroad, leaves for the [[Duchy of Florence]], itself a powerful city-state in Tuscany in present-day Italy. Despite repression, Držić's company continues to stage plays and provoke local authorities.  The Senate gets increasingly intolerant to any form of criticism and the company soon find themselves in a difficult situation - as the censors had decided to sanction Držić's thinly veiled criticisms by increasing taxes on his stage productions, the company amasses a huge debt which leads to seizures of their property. Because of this, his close friend, actor Lukarević ([[Žarko Potočnjak]]), decides to leave Ragusa and emigrates to Florence.  Although Držić gains some support from his friend the poet [[Mavro Vetranović]] ([[Vlatko Dulić]]), he also comes into conflict with his brother Vlaho Držić ([[Livio Badurina]]), an acclaimed painter who openly supports the Senate's authority. Staying true to his [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] beliefs, and unable to continue his work, Držić also decides to join the conspiracy and leaves for Florence. After reaching [[Tuscany]], Držić mingles with other Ragusan [[exiles]], including Lukarević and Deša Zamagna. Inspired by the progressive society of 16th-century Tuscany, Držić pens a draft of a new Ragusan [[statute]], which he titles ''Libertas'' ([[Latin]] for "liberty"), which enshrines the freedoms of speech and creative expression.  Lord Bučinić, in an attempt to gain support for the conspirators' cause, tries to use Deša's and Držić's reputation in Florence and instructs them to turn to [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]] ([[Andrea Buscemi]]), the [[Duke of Florence]], but to no avail as he ignores their pleas. Meanwhile, the Ragusan authorities hire mercenaries to track down and assassinate them all. Ignored by Cosimo I, the plot is effectively terminated as spies locate and execute Bučinić and Lukarević. Držić and Deša then decide to escape to [[Venice]], hoping to find refuge in the city in which several of his works had been published, and that the [[Doge of Venice]] might be more understanding to their plight.  During their perilous journey, the friendship between them develops into a romance. Arriving in Venice, they try to hide but are nevertheless found by assassins. A manhunt through Venetian streets and bridges ensues, in which Držić deliberately draws the pursuers to himself to lure them away from Deša, before escaping by jumping into a canal. At dawn the following day, Držić is washed ashore. Exhausted and frozen, he is found by the city guards and taken to the [[poorhouse]]. As he floats between life and death in [[delirium]] he sees his ideals becoming reality. In the final scene, undertakers put his casket on a [[gondola]], which floats away across the lagoon.  
A Lesson of Belarusian
 In the documentary, 18-year-old [[Franak Viacorka|Franak Viačorka]], a youth activist with the [[Partyja BPF|Belarusian Popular Front]], prepares with his friends for the run-up to the 2006 presidential election. Their activities range from handing out newspapers, organising rock concerts, distributing flyers, composing protest songs and interviewing the opposition candidate, [[Alaksandar Milinkievič]]. Aside from the main theme of the elections, it also touches briefly on the incarceration of Franak's father, [[Vincuk Viačorka]], a professor at the banned [[Belarusian Humanities Lyceum]], where Franak and many of his friends were students.  Events come to a climax on the night of the election results, March 19. Following the suspicious landslide victory of Lukashenko, opposition activists and supporters [[Jeans Revolution|take to the streets in protest]], many of them setting up a 'tent city' in October Square in [[Minsk]]. By the night of March 23, riot police are deployed to clear the remaining protesters.  Two days later on March 25, [[Freedom Day (Belarus)|Belarusian Independence Day]] riot police clash violently with anti-Lukashenko demonstrators, detaining several, among them Alaksandar Milinkievič. By the end of the film, Franak's father has been released from detention, the battle has temporarily been lost, but the people's spirit is unquenched. According to Franak, the end is nigh for Lukashenko.  
Lentera Merah
 An employee of ''Lentera Merah'', the campus newspaper of the [[University of Indonesia]], is found dead in the office with the number 65 written in blood by his body. In the meantime, five students compete for a position at the publication: Risa Priliyanti (Laudya Cynthia Bella), Riki (Tesadesrada Ryza), Lia (Beauty Oehmke), Muti (Auxilia Paramitha) and Yoga (Zainal Arifin).  As part of their entrance test, they must cover supposedly haunted portions of the university campus. Another ''Lentera Merah'' staff member, Wulan (Firrina Sinatrya) is found [[hanging|hanged]] in the library. The rector forbids the test after these murders are known, but chief editor Iqbal (Dimas Beck) insists that the five students go through the initiation rites to show their mettle as journalists. Lia and Risa go with staff photographer Bayu (Saputra).  After several more staff members are killed, it is discovered that Risa is in fact the ghost of a former ''Lentera Merah'' staff member who was killed in 1965 after being accused of being a communist sympathiser; her body was later buried under the floor of one of the buildings. They realise that Risa is killing them because they are related to the staff members who killed her. Iqbal's father, a ''Lentera Merah'' staff member in 1965, comes to the campus to warn his son. As the remaining students leave to find Risa's body and give it a proper burial, Risa appears and strangles Iqbal's father. Having found closure, she vanishes.  
Legend of the Doll
 Ryōta, a collector of [[model figure]]s, receives a box with doll parts from a mysterious shop in Akihabara. After assembling and customizing them, the figurine magically turns into real, android-like, woman named Airu. After learning how to speak more naturally, Airu finds a picture of Ryōta's ex-girlfriend Yuria and tries to understand what happened in their past.  
The Libertine (2004 film)
 John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester (Depp), delivers a prologue of themes of his fondness for drink, his sexual proclivities, and his disdain for his audience.  King Charles II (Malkovich) retracts his banishment of the earl as he has need of him in the House of Lords. Back in London, Rochester finds his "Merry Gang" friends, [[George Etherege]] (Hollander) and [[Charles Sackville]] (Vegas), in a bawdy house. Rochester encounters on the street the thief Alcock (Coyle). Impressed by his dishonesty, Rochester hires him as his [[Valet#Domestic valet|gentleman]]. The Merry Gang introduce to Rochester who will be its newest member, 18-year-old Billy Downs (Friend). Rochester warns Downs, "Young man, you will die of this company."  The Merry Gang attend a play where the actress [[Elizabeth Barry]] (Morton) is booed off the stage, refusing to participate in a [[curtain call]], and is fired. Rochester is taken with Barry, secures her re-employment with the theatre company, and undertakes to coach her in acting. Barry's acting improves dramatically and she delivers a brilliant performance in her next production. The King approaches Barry to spy on Rochester as to the progress of the intended tribute to the French Ambassador.  Charles, in need of money from France, asks Rochester to write a play in honour of the French Ambassador's visit. The king requests it be a "testament" to his reign. Rochester writes ''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery]]'', a scathing satire of the king's reign, which he claims is "a testament to Charles" — just what the king had asked for. The play involves vulgar language, simulated sex acts, and Rochester portraying the king being serviced. At the premiere, the king interrupts the play and on the stage confronts Rochester. Downs is injured in a sword fight outside the home of a Constable; Rochester backs away from his dying friend, whispering, "I told you."  Hiding from the king in the English countryside and sick with symptoms of [[syphilis]], Rochester peddles phony [[gynaecology|gynaecological]] "treatments" for women, including the selling of "potions" made from Alcock's [[urine]]. Rochester's face has become disfigured by syphilitic [[gummata]], which he hides beneath a mask. Charles eventually tracks down Rochester, but decides that the worst punishment possible is to simply "let you be you." Rochester returns to his estate and wife, Elizabeth (Pike), admitting to having been constantly for five years under the influence of "the drink". Elizabeth declares her love for him.  Charles' choice of heir, his [[Roman Catholic]] brother [[James, Duke of York]], leads to a showdown with [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] with the [[Exclusion Bill]] that would deny James the throne. Rochester uses [[Foundation (cosmetics)|make-up]] and a silver nose tip to hide the indications of syphilis as he enters the House of Lords hobbling on two canes. His denunciation in the Lords of the bill ingratiates the appreciation of the king when it is defeated. When Rochester reveals his desire to have wanted Barry as his wife she reveals she never had the desire to be the wife of anyone, she had a daughter by him that he was unaware of, and this daughter is called Elizabeth.  Rochester returns to his estate where he is bedridden in the care of Elizabeth, his mother, a priest summoned to "bring God to him" as she did not want Rochester to die as an atheist, and Alcock. Before he dies, Rochester asks the priest to recite from [[Book of Isaiah]], chapter 53; he also asks his wife to retell the story of how he had abducted her when she was 18 years old and they fell in love. Rochester's death is followed by a scene of Elizabeth Barry is playing the role of his wife in ''[[The Man of Mode]]'', the play about him written by his friend Etheridge.  The [[epilogue]] is Rochester slipping into the darkness of an increasingly fading candlelight, asking "Do you like me now?"  
Lights in the Dusk
 Koistinen (Janne Hyytiäinen) is a lonely nightwatchman tasked with guarding a shopping mall. He attempts to socialize, but is treated coldly by his manager and subjected to mocking by his colleagues. While he is drinking alone in a bar, he catches the eye of some criminals headed by Lindholm ([[Ilkka Koivula]]) who learn of his occupation. Koistinen's only human contact is the grill vendor Aila ([[Maria Heiskanen]]) to whom he outlines his plans of starting his own company.  While at work, Koistinen notices a dog left outside a pub without water. While he is taking a break, Mirja ([[Maria Järvenhelmi]]) approaches him, saying he seems lonely. They agree to go on a date together. Returning from his break, Koistinen meets a young boy in front of the pub and asks if he knows the owners of the dog. Despite the boy's warning, Koistinen confronts the owners in the pub and is beaten off-camera.  Koistinen and Mirja go on a date. They talk little, and at a concert Koistinen watches as Mirja goes dancing on her own with other men. Despite this, they agree to meet again. Koistinen returns to Aila's grill and talks about his evening. Insulted, Aila asks him to leave and closes shop. Meanwhile, Mirja meets with Lindholm for her payment and ridicules Koistinen. Lindholm informs his contacts of an "open-door day."  Koistinen seeks a loan to start his own business, but is harshly refused at the bank due to his insufficient education and lack of guarantors. Later, Mirja unexpectedly joins Koistinen while he is taking his rounds. While Koistinen explains the mall's security system, Mirja memorizes the security code he uses. She gives the code to Lindholm, who tells her to start cooling the fake relationship off.  Mirja meets Koistinen at his place, but abruptly leaves when he attempts to put his arm around her. Koistinen begins to drink heavily, and ends up at Aila's grill. Aila walks him home and puts him to bed.  At work, one of Koistinen's colleagues mockingly asks about his successes with women. Koistinen grabs the man, but stops himself from striking him and goes to his rounds. Mirja meets him and asks him to come and talk. Koistinen signs off and leaves with Mirja in his car. Mirja drugs Koistinen and passes his keys to one of Lindholm's contacts. Using Koistinen's keys and security code, the thieves rob a jewellery store at the mall.  The police question Koistinen, but he claims to have been alone and drunk. He is released due to lack of proof, but is fired from his job. On Lindholm's insistence, Mirja meets with Koistinen at his apartment once again to plant evidence. Koistinen notices her hiding the evidence, but does not stop her and lets himself be arrested by the police. He is sentenced to two years in prison.  Koistinen initially remains lonely in prison, tearing up a letter Aila sends him. Just as Koistinen begins to have some contact to other inmates, he is released a year early on parole. He finds lodgings at a night shelter and gets a job as a restaurant's dishwasher. He runs into Aila, but soon excuses himself. However, Aila comes to see him at the night shelter and asks about his plans for the future. When Koistinen says he plans to open a garage once he's back on his feet, she congratulates him for not losing hope. They agree to see each other again.  Koistinen sees Mirja and Lindholm at the restaurant where he is working, but does not confront them. Lindholm calls up the head waitress and tells about Koistinen's criminal record, which results in him being fired immediately. Koistinen gets a knife from the night shelter and returns to the restaurant. As Lindholm and Mirja are leaving, he attacks Lindholm, but only manages to cut his hand while being disarmed and subdued by Lindholm's thugs. The thugs offer to kill Koistinen, but Lindholm refuses, saying he is a businessman and not a murderer. The young boy who warned Koistinen earlier sees the thugs take him away and finds Aila. They discover the badly beaten Koistinen in the harbour, along with the dog Koistinen attempted to help earlier. Aila offers to get help but Koistinen asks her to stay. When she asks him not to die, Koistinen replies "I won't die yet" and puts his hand on hers.  
Lifted (2006 film)
 A young [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]], Stu,<ref name=AWN2007OscarShorts></ref> is inside a [[spacecraft]] taking an [[alien abduction]] exam.  He must snatch a sleeping farmer named Ernie<ref name=AWN2007OscarShorts /> under the watchful eye of his impassive examiner, a gelatinous blob named Mr. B.<ref name=AWN2007OscarShorts /> Working from memory, Stu is expected to use an array of thousands of identical unlabeled [[toggle switch]]es for this purpose; Mr. B's neutral expression gives no hints of which ones to use.  Stu's hesitant flicks of the switches turn out to be wrong, causing Ernie to bump into the walls and ceiling, albeit without waking him up. As Stu grows increasingly frustrated, Stu yells and swipes randomly at the array. Ernie bounces randomly around the room like a pinball, knocking over the furniture in the process but remaining asleep. Eventually, after checking his notes, Stu does succeed in maneuvering Ernie out the window and up into the ship, but he shuts off the [[tractor beam]] without closing the cargo hatch. As Ernie plummets toward the ground, Mr. B takes over and catches him, he then pushes Stu far away from him and starts working the switches with incredible speed to put him back in his bed and clean up the mess Stu created.  Dejected over his failure, Stu struggles to hold back tears. With a sigh, the sympathetic Mr. B allows him to launch the spaceship for the trip home. Stu cheerfully grabs the steering yoke and begins to maneuver; a moment later the ship slams to the ground, crushing Ernie's house. When it lifts off, its underside is covered with dirt and debris, and nothing is left of the house except a tall pillar of dirt in the center of a crater, cut out by the open cargo hatch. Atop this, Ernie is still sound asleep in bed.  As the end credits run, the sound of Ernie's alarm clock is heard, followed by his yawn, a [[Wilhelm scream|scream]] and a thud – indicating that he has fallen into the crater.  
Like a Virgin (film)
 Chubby [[high school]] student and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]-devotee Oh Dong-ku is a [[trans woman]] living with her abusive, [[alcoholic]] father. Dong-ku works part-time to save money for the [[sex reassignment surgery]] she craves. Despite being told that she has the perfect physique for [[ssireum]], Dong-ku has no interest in taking up sports—but when she finds out about an upcoming ssireum tournament with a large cash prize going to the winner, she changes her mind and signs up for the team.  
The Life of Reilly
 The film begins with Reilly recounting his childhood and his parents in New York City and [[Connecticut]]. We meet his family—an institutionalized father, a racist, baseball bat-wielding mother, and a lobotomized aunt, amongst others. "[[Eugene O’Neill]] would never get near this family," Reilly declares.     Prior to being put into an institution, Reilly’s father, a [[Paramount Pictures]] poster artist and illustrator, was offered the chance to go into business with another illustrator with the intention of making their first animated film in color together. The catch was simply that the senior Mr. Reilly would have to move himself and his family to California. Perhaps a defining moment in young Reilly’s life, his father asked his mother her thoughts and she unceremoniously rejected the possibility. The other illustrator went west without the senior Mr. Reilly as a partner. That other illustrator was named [[Walt Disney]].     After this missed opportunity, Reilly's father began drinking heavily and eventually had a nervous breakdown. Upon being institutionalized, the family was forced to move out of the Bronx up to Connecticut to live with Mrs. Reilly’s family.     When Reilly turned eighteen, he moved to New York City. "If you wanted to be an actor in those days," he explains, "You did something that’s really unheard of today… you studied."  Young and hungry (literally), Reilly managed to find an acting class at New School. Its rather liberal open door policy allowed aspiring actors admission even if they didn’t have the money to pay.     Reilly’s class was taught by a young, award-winning, soon-to-be-legendary actress, [[Uta Hagen]]. In the class were such future stars and notables as [[Steve McQueen]], [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Anne Meara]], [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Jason Robards]], [[Geraldine Page]] and [[Gene Hackman]]. It was a group of future [[Academy Award]], Tony Award and [[Emmy Award]] winners, and, as Charles explains, "We wanted to go on the stage, none of us had any money, and this entire list… couldn’t act for shit."     It was about this time when a friend of Reilly's arranged a meeting with a powerful [[NBC]] executive. Reilly went in and was told, "They don’t let queers on television." In retrospect, Reilly describes it as, "A short meeting." Despite the apparent prejudice against him, his talent and tenacity landed him on Broadway, winning his first Tony Award for his role in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', as well as leading roles in the original Broadway casts of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''  Reilly went on to become a fixture in television appearing in numerous episodes of ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', ''[[The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (TV series)|The Ghost & Mrs. Muir]]'', and starring in ''[[Lidsville]]''. He also made hundreds of guest appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', second in number of appearances only to Bob Hope, and had a more recent [[Jose Chung's From Outer Space|memorable guest spot]] on ''[[The X-Files]]''. Over the years, he developed a habit of looking through the week’s ''[[TV Guide]]'' to see how many times he would be on TV that week. Coming in at over a hundred separate appearances, he reflected on the NBC executive who told him he would not be allowed on television—but now Reilly wondered, "Who do I have to fuck to get off?!"     Success came to Reilly’s professional life, and he has used all the knowledge and expertise he has gained through a lifetime spent acting to teach. His longtime friend [[Burt Reynolds]] gave him a theater in which to teach the craft of acting, and it has fulfilled Reilly ever since. As we leave him in what he calls "The twilight of an extraordinary life", we see a portrait of an artist, a victim of prejudice who rose above it, a trailblazing comedic personality, an entertainer, a son, a teacher, and a man laid bare for all to see.  
Like a Dragon: Prologue
 [[File:Kabukicho Gate at night.jpg|thumb|left|The movie was shot on location in [[Tokyo]]'s [[Kabukicho]] (歌舞伎町) district which itself served as a basis for the background design of the game's Kamurocho area.]]  During the 1970s, three children, [[Kazuma Kiryu]], [[Akira Nishikiyama]] (a.k.a. Nishiki) and his younger sister, Yuko Nishikiyama, are raised in [[Shintaro Kazama]] (a.k.a. Fuma)'s Sunflower Orphanage. In summer 1980, [[Yumi Sawamura]], a young girl whose parents were incidentally shot during a gang's [[shootout]], joins them in the orphanage. Following a ''[[yakuza]]'' tradition, the honorable Kazama secretly raises orphans whose parents he has directly or indirectly killed. In return, these children look at him as their father and he eventually introduces the teenagers in the [[Dojima Family]], a [[Tojo Clan]] affiliate.  Years later, the promising Kazuma Kiryu quickly rises the yakuza hierarchy and earns the nickname "the Dragon of the Dojima Family" for the Dragon ''[[irezumi]]'' tattoo on his back (hence the original title ). His childhood friend Nishikiyama is torn between loyalty for his ''kyodai'' (yakuza "brother") and jealousy against the one who has always been Kazama's ''protégé''. Another subject of rivalry between the two friends is their secret love for Yumi who looks up to them as her older brothers.

When Nishikiyama eventually reaches Dojima's office, he finds his boss raping Yumi and shoots him dead. Kazuma, who was at a meeting with Kazama had been called by Reina, arrives shortly after only to find Dojima on the ground, Nishikiyama and Yumi in shock.

Limit of Love: Umizaru
  Following the decommissioning of the patrol vessel ''Nagare'' (ながれ), Daisuke Senzaki, a Japan Coast Guard (JCG) rescue diver, is posted to the 10th Region Mobile Rescue Unit, based at Kagoshima Air Station. The film's opening sequence depicts a plane crash in stormy seas, where Senzaki battles the elements to keep two victims alive. The adverse conditions prevents the dropping of additional divers to aid Senzaki, and he struggles to keep all three of them on the floating wreckage which has become their lifeboat. Senzaki is only able to hold onto an adult male, while a young boy struggles to hang on by himself. At this point, the adult lets go of Senzaki's hand; a cue for him to grab hold of the boy instead. Senzaki manages to keep the boy alive, but the heroic gesture by the other victim meant that he himself drowns. Senzaki soon becomes plagued with guilt and self-doubt due to this episode, as he had once pledged not to let anymore victims die before his eyes.  Senzaki's girlfriend Kanna Izawa takes time off her job and travels a long distance by car to see him. As the couple check into a hotel, Izawa locks herself out of her room, thus inadvertently forces her to spring a wedding dress surprise on Senzaki. The fashion designer Izawa had made the long journey down with her own handmade wedding dress with the intention of fulfill the couple's plans of marriage. The mentally-traumatised Senzaki however, is not prepared for marital commitments, and his reluctance drives a wedge between the two. Izawa leaves heartbroken in spite of the best efforts of Senzaki's buddy, Tetsuya Yoshioka, to mediate.  While en route for a routine training exercise, news arrives that a passenger ferry, the ''Clover'', has run aground and begun its 4 hour long death throes. Senzaki and his buddy Yoshioka are among the first divers on site, having been deployed by helicopter onto the dying ship. Senzaki and Yoshioka's stark prognosis of the ship's fate is compounded by revelations from Coast Guard crisis command; 620 passengers, 195 fuel-laden vehicles, and rapidly diminishing time window for escape. His rescue efforts takes a dramatic turn when he discovers his girlfriend Izawa on board. The disheartened Izawa had chosen to take the ferry instead of driving home; a fateful decision. As per escape regulations, Senzaki tells Izawa to abandon her belongings and proceed to the lifeboats, including the handmade wedding dress. As the couple part ways, Izawa asks for Senzaki's reassurance that they will meet again afterwards. "Of course!" replies Senzaki, oblivious to the perilous dangers that will soon follow.  While attending to an injured pregnant staff member, Megumi Honma, Senzaki becomes separated from the rest of his team as the woman informs him of a faster route to the escape hatches. The shortcut brings them to the vehicle deck of the ferry, where they meet an irritable passenger, Shinichi Ebihara, tending his precious Ferrari. By then the ship's list has toppled several motorcycles, spilling petroleum across the deck; a disaster waiting to happen. A sudden lurch wreaks havoc on the vehicles and ignites the petroleum, causing a massive explosion which exacerbates the growing crisis. Yoshioka then joins the 3, having realised Senzaki had gone off on his own. The fire forces the strickened 4 scrambling for cover on another deck where they become disoriented; trapped with no idea where to go. As if their situation isn't bad enough, Ebihara suffers an injury to his left thigh. They radio for help and after a few frantic minutes, report that a duct in the room bears the markings "68-4T".  A frantic JCG crisis command centre tries to locate the room which the 4 are trapped in, and their discovery is grim. Burning decks above and flooded decks below; escape is impossible. Shimokawa and other officers pore over the schematics of the ship, desperate for some feasible route of escape. Shimokawa decides that the stricken 4 have no choice but to swim underwater to attempt an escape into another level of the ship. Despite the protests of the other HQ officers, Shimokawa insists that his route, which requires a swim of 30m, is the only option left. Senzaki and Yoshioka bring the pregnant Honma and injured Ebihara through the perilous underwater swim, while crisis command awaits their confirmation of success by radio. The 4 eventually complete the swim into another level which was yet unflooded, but as explosions rock the ship, their radio signals are unable to reach JCG command.  Meanwhile, the last of the passengers have been evacuated, leaving the 2 victims with Senzaki and Yoshioka the only ones unaccounted for. Shimokawa, since promoted to a shore command position from his days with Senzaki on the Nagare, is forced to grapple with a tough decision. To continue the recovery of the missing 4 with other rescue divers or to withdraw all teams to avoid suffering casualties in a likely fruitless rescue attempt. Further explosions and casualties force Shimokawa to withdraw the other divers; a decision met with great disdain and frustration from the on-site divers who comply with the greatest reluctance. Now safe on shore, Izawa notices the return of the rescue divers from the sinking ship and worriedly inquires the whereabouts of her boyfriend. Her worst fears are confirmed when JCG officials make the press release stating the names of the missing divers and passengers, and that rescue efforts have been suspended due to the danger posed to rescuers.  A distraught Izawa watches helplessly at the raging inferno that is now the Clover. A discouraged and frustrated atmosphere looms over the JCG crisis command centre. Cut off from radio contact with JCG command with little idea where to proceed, Senzaki and company are forced to struggle for their own survival with no outside help.  The only thing that can save them now is their will to survive - their will to return to their loved ones alive.

That night the guys go out to a club, but Jerome can not go because he is not old enough. So he goes to an amusement park with his friends, where they give him the streetball name Triple J.  Under Ray's encouragement, Jerome becomes a ball hog.  He fights with his friends, and his teammates start giving him the cold shoulder.

Outside Jerome has a talk with Ray, who reveals the extent of his power over Jerome, who also turns out to be the brother of an ex-boyfriend Jerome's cousin dated, betraying him. After Ray drives away, Jerome takes the bus home. Having lost his two best friends and Ray having hoodwinked him with a shady contract, Jerome tells his mom he's quit basketball. The next day, Jerome's mom, off-screen, kicks Ray out of the house, for his hateful schemes against her and Jerome. Then Jerome goes to the court and apologizes to his friends. They say they will see him at the King Of The Concrete Championships, but he tells them that he does not have the magic shoes any more and that he has quit basketball. One of his friends says that Jerome should just play for fun. After giving his friends some pointers, Jerome realizes they really should play again. They form a team called Triple Threat. Jerome's mom also finds the magic shoes in Ray's stuff.  The next day at the King Of The Concrete Championship, Ray has a new team called Ray On, composed of players which Jerome had shown up on other occasions. Triple Threat makes it into the finals thanks to Jerome, but so does Ray On, who ruthlessly beat the other teams. When Ray On goes up against Triple Threat, Ray deliberately messes up Jerome's sneakers and Nathan gets hurt. Then Jerome's dad leads them back at the final shot.

Little Children (film)
 Sarah Pierce is a hapless, stay-at-home mother in a small suburb of [[Boston]]. She had been working on a doctorate in English, but set aside her work to marry Richard, and raise their 3-year-old daughter, Lucy. Her marriage falls apart when she discovers that Richard is addicted to [[online pornography]]. Sarah meets Brad Adamson, a law student who brings his 4-year-old son, Aaron, to the park. Brad is married to Kathy, and although their marriage is loving and amicable, it has been lacking intimacy.   When Brad is supposed to be studying for the bar exam, he instead plays on a local football team or sits and watches teenagers skateboard outside his house, fantasizing about being young and carefree again. Brad and Sarah become friendly and, on a dare, kiss in the park, scandalizing the other park parents. They are instantly attracted to each other, but resolve to keep their relationship platonic. One day, several parents panic when they see Ronnie J. McGorvey, a [[pedophile]], who was recently released from prison, swimming in the pool with the children. After Ronnie is escorted away by the police, it begins to rain.   Sarah and Brad take Lucy and Aaron back to her house and put the kids to bed. Brad looks at one of Sarah's books and finds a photo of him in it. While Sarah is drying towels in her basement, Brad kisses her and they have sex. Brad's friend, Larry Hedges, is a former police officer who was forced to retire when he accidentally shot a teenager at a local mall. Now he is estranged from his wife and spends much of his time harassing Ronnie. Ronnie lives with his mother, May, who believes that meeting a woman his own age would cure him of his [[pedophilia]]. Ronnie knows this is futile, but agrees to go on a date May has arranged for him with a woman named Sheila.   During dinner, Ronnie tells Sheila about his criminal record, and Sheila in return tells him that she has had a series of [[nervous breakdown]]s. They seem to get on well, but the date ends badly when he has her drive by an elementary school playground so he can masturbate next to her in the car. When Brad skips taking the bar exam again, Kathy grows suspicious and tells Brad to invite Sarah, Richard, and Lucy over for dinner. The intimacy evident between Brad and Sarah confirms her suspicions, and Kathy arranges for her mother to come for an extended visit so Brad and Sarah can't see one another anymore. When Brad's football team plays its final game, Sarah attends and cheers as Brad scores the winning touchdown.   Afterwards, while Larry waits for Brad at a nearby bar to celebrate their victory, Brad and Sarah make out on the field. He admits that this is the happiest moment of his life, and convinces Sarah to run away with him. Larry goes to Ronnie's house and uses a bullhorn to taunt him. May comes out to confront him and has a heart attack. Larry is arrested and May is taken to the hospital. While Ronnie sleeps in the waiting room, May dies. When Ronnie goes home, he finds an envelope containing a letter written by his mother saying: "Please be a good boy." Distraught, Ronnie destroys much of his mother's collection of Hummel figurines, then takes a butcher knife from the kitchen.   That same night, Sarah and Brad agree to meet in the park to run away together. Brad tells Aaron he loves him before putting him to bed, writes Kathy a note explaining why he is leaving her, then sneaks out while she and her mother finish the dishes. Before he can get to the park, he is distracted by skateboarding teenagers, who convince him to try a jump himself. Brad does so, but falls and knocks himself out. When he regains consciousness, he asks the paramedics to call his wife and to meet him at the hospital. It turns out that he never left the note for her and tells one of the skateboarders to dispose of it for him.   When Sarah takes Lucy to the park, she sees Ronnie stagger by, and briefly feels afraid. When she sees him crying about his mother's death, however, she feels sorry for him. When Lucy disappears, Sarah panics and rushes to find her, forgetting about Brad. After Sarah finds Lucy and puts her in the car, Sarah starts crying, realizing her getaway with Brad is just a fantasy. Larry is upset about having indirectly caused May's death. He genuinely wants to apologize to Ronnie, but when he finds Ronnie in the park, he discovers that he has castrated himself and is bleeding to death. Larry races him to the hospital, and they arrive just as Kathy meets Brad at the emergency room doors.

Because they have little money, they go on an 800-mile road trip in their yellow [[Volkswagen Type 2]].  Family tensions play out on the highway and at stops along the way, amidst the aging VW van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20&nbsp; mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.  Throughout the road trip, the family suffers numerous personal setbacks and discover their need for each other's support. Richard loses an important contract that would have jump-started his motivational business. Frank encounters the ex-boyfriend who, in leaving him for an academic rival, had prompted his suicide attempt.

After a frantic race against the clock, the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant organizer that they are a couple minutes past the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on his own time. As Olive prepares for the pageant, the family sees Olive's competition: slim, [[hypersexual]]ized pre-teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large eyeglasses, and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.  As Olive's turn to perform in the talent portion of the pageant draws near, Richard and Dwayne recognize that Olive is certain to be humiliated, and wanting to spare her feelings, run to the dressing room to talk her out of performing. Sheryl, however, insists that they "let Olive be Olive", and Olive goes on stage. Olive's hitherto-unrevealed dance that her Grandpa Edwin had choreographed for her is performed to [[Rick James]]' song "[[Super Freak]]". Olive scandalizes and horrifies most of the audience and pageant judges with a [[burlesque]] performance that she joyfully performs while oblivious to their reactions. The pageant organizers are enraged and demand Sheryl and Richard remove Olive from the stage. Instead of removing her, one by one the members of the Hoover family join Olive on stage, dancing alongside her to show their support.  The family is next seen outside the hotel's security office where they are given their freedom in return for a promise never to enter a beauty pageant in the state of California again. Piling into the van with the horn still honking, they happily smash through the barrier of the hotel's toll booth and head back to their home in Albuquerque.

The Lives of Others
  In 1984 [[East Germany]], [[Stasi]] Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler ([[Ulrich Mühe]]), code name HGW XX/7, is ordered to spy on the playwright Georg Dreyman ([[Sebastian Koch]]), who has escaped state scrutiny due to his pro-Communist views and international recognition. Wiesler and his team bug the apartment, set up surveillance equipment in an attic, and begin reporting Dreyman's activities. Wiesler learns that Dreyman has been put under surveillance at the request of Minister of Culture, Bruno Hempf ([[Thomas Thieme]]), who covets Dreyman's girlfriend, actress Christa-Maria Sieland ([[Martina Gedeck]]). After an intervention by Wiesler leads to Dreyman's discovering Sieland's relationship with Hempf, he implores her not to meet him again. Sieland flees to a nearby bar where Wiesler, posing as a fan, urges her to be true to herself. She returns home and reconciles with Dreyman.  At Dreyman's birthday party, his friend Albert Jerska (a [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklisted]] theatrical director) gives him [[sheet music]] for ''Sonate vom Guten Menschen'' (''Sonata for a Good Man''). Shortly afterwards, Jerska hangs himself. Dreyman decides to publish an anonymous article in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', a prominent West German newsweekly. Dreyman's article accuses the state of concealing the country's elevated suicide rates. Since all East German [[typewriter]]s are registered and identifiable, an editor of ''Der Spiegel'' smuggles Dreyman a miniature typewriter with a red ribbon. Dreyman hides the typewriter under a floorboard of his apartment but is seen by Sieland. When Dreyman and his friends feign a defection attempt to determine whether or not his flat is bugged, Wiesler does not alert the border guards or his superior Lt. Col. Anton Grubitz ([[Ulrich Tukur]]) and the conspirators believe they are safe.   Dreyman's article is published, angering the East German authorities. The Stasi obtains a copy, but are unable to link it to any registered typewriter. Livid at being rejected by Sieland, Hempf orders Grubitz to arrest her. She is blackmailed into revealing Dreyman's authorship of the article, although when the Stasi search his apartment, they cannot find the typewriter. Grubitz, suspicious that Wiesler has mentioned nothing unusual in his daily reports of the monitoring, orders him to do the follow-up interrogation of Sieland. Wiesler forces Sieland to tell him where the typewriter is hidden.  Grubitz and the Stasi return to Dreyman's apartment. Sieland realizes that Dreyman will know she betrayed him and flees the apartment. When Grubitz removes the floor, the typewriter is gone—Wiesler having removed it before the search team arrived. Unaware of this, Sieland runs to the street and commits suicide by stepping into the path of a truck. Grubitz informs Wiesler that the investigation is over, his career is over and his remaining 20 years with the agency will be in Department M, a dead-end position for disgraced agents.  On November 9, 1989, Wiesler is steam-opening letters when a co-worker tells him about the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]]. Wiesler leaves the office, inspiring his co-workers to do the same. Two years later, Hempf and Dreyman meet while attending a performance of Dreyman's play. Dreyman asks the former minister why he had never been monitored. Hempf tells him that he had been under full surveillance in 1984. Dreyman searches his apartment and finds the listening devices.  At the [[Stasi Records Agency]], Dreyman reviews the files kept while he was under surveillance. He reads that Sieland was released just before the second search and could not have removed the typewriter. He is at first confused by the false and contradictory information regarding his activities, but when he reaches the final report, he sees a fingerprint in red ink. Dreyman finally realizes that the officer in charge of his surveillance&mdash;Stasi officer HGW&nbsp;XX/7 had concealed his illegal activities, including his authorship of the suicide article, and that he had removed the typewriter from his apartment. Dreyman searches for Wiesler, who now has a job as a postman. Unsure of what to say to him, he decides not to approach him.  Two years later, Wiesler still has the same job and, whilst on his rounds, passes a bookstore window display promoting Dreyman's new novel, ''Sonate vom Guten Menschen''. He goes inside and opens a copy of the book, discovering it is dedicated "To HGW XX/7, in gratitude". Deeply moved, Wiesler buys the book. When the sales clerk asks if he wants it gift-wrapped, he responds, "No. This is for me."

Love Com
 ''Love Com'' is a love story between a boy and a girl in [[Sakai, Osaka]]. The girl, Risa Koizumi, is  tall—much taller than the average [[Japanese people|Japanese]] girl. The boy, Atsushi Ōtani, is —way below the [[Human height|height]] of the average Japanese boy. Because of this, the pair are called the "[[List of Japanese comedians#A|All Hanshin Kyojin]]" after a popular comedy duo that has a similar height difference. The difference in their heights is extremely exaggerated (in the opening credits of the anime, for example, the top of Ōtani's head doesn't even reach Risa's chin when it should be approximately level with her mouth.)  During summer school, a very tall student named Ryouji Suzuki (from another class) shows up and Risa immediately falls for him because he is tall. There is a girl that Atsushi likes as well, so Risa and Atsushi decide to put aside their differences and help each other get their love interests. Their efforts fail spectacularly as Suzuki and the girl whom Ōtani had a crush on - Chiharu Tanaka - end up becoming a couple. All is not lost though, since Risa and Ōtani become close friends. As they get to know each other better, Risa's feelings for Atsushi begin to blossom, and her love life gets complicated from there on.  One notable fact about ''Love Com'' is that instead of speaking standard Japanese, almost all characters speak in [[Kansai-ben]].<ref name="kansai-ben"></ref> Many native Osakan voice actors are employed in the anime.  While having one or two characters speaking Kansai-ben is common in many anime shows, having all characters doing so is unusual in media produced for a nationwide audience.

Lovers, Liars & Lunatics
  Set mostly during one long day and night, ''Lovers, Liars & Lunatics'' follows a dysfunctional suburban Los Angeles family. Paddy Rayne (Vic Polizos) is the manager of a local retail store who is having an affair with his secretary Gloria (Mia Cottet). Paddy wants to leave his neurotic, highly contemptuous wife Elaine (Christine Estabrook) to live with his mistress. Unfortunately Gloria just wants Paddy's money. He hides the money at home. Gloria calls on her two "associates", Gloria's younger brother Louis (Michael Muhney), and his dim-witted girlfriend Justine (Amber Benson), to rob the Raynes when the house is empty that night.  Elaine figures out the affair and steals Paddy's money from the kitchen cupboard spice bottles. She plans to leave him in the morning. Both cancel their getaway plans to Bakersfield.   Later that night, Louis and Justine arrive at the house to rob it, only to be surprised by finding Paddy and Elaine still there, forcing the inept burglars to tie them up. But soon, Louis and Justine realize they cannot leave, for their getaway car is missing (Justine had accidentally left the drive gear on), plus Paddy's other car is gone (their son Gunner had taken it for his date with Sally). Soon, the couple is bickering at each other. Louis demands to know where they keep their money. Soon, Julian, the couple's other son, walks in and he too is soon tied up. When Gunner and a drunken Sally return from their late-night date, they are also caught at gunpoint and tied up by the increasingly desperate Louis and Justine.  Paddy, in the seclusion of a nearby bathroom, tells Louis that he will give him his wealth totaling $140,000 if he kills his wife so he can be free of her constant nagging, while Elaine later tells Louis that she will give him $15,000 of the store's retail profits if he kills Paddy's mistress, Gloria. But Elaine doesn't know that it was Gloria whom hired Louis to rob their house in the first place.  As the night drags on, the events lead to Gloria's arrival, wanting to know what is taking so long with the robbery, as well as the arrival of two persistent, but equally inept, policemen whom threaten to blow everything out of proportions. Justine literally shoots herself in the foot with the gun, forcing her to untie Elaine to tend to her wound. At the same time, Gloria has wild sex with Paddy in the bathroom to get to him to talk where he is keeping his money, which leads to him dying from a sudden heart attack. (Earlier that evening, Elaine had switched his heart medication with Viagra.) Gloria then learns from Louis about a $140,000 cashier's check and takes it from him. In another argument, Gloria accidentally shoots Justine, leading to chaos as Elaine takes advantage of it to untie everybody. Louis attacks Gloria, while Gunner intervenes, in which he slips and fatally hits his head against the kitchen counter. Elaine grabs a baseball bat and bludgeons Louis to death with it. While Julian flees, Sally runs outside to chase after the departing police, only to get accidentally run over by the cop car. The two policemen return to the scene, where they catch and arrest Gloria as she's leaving the house. Investigating, the two policemen find all the dead people with Elaine apparently the only one alive. But in an off-the-wall, final joke, it's strongly hinted that Elaine could get blamed for all the deaths because of her erratic personality, having been driven over the edge of sanity from this ordeal, with the final shot of her babbling to the two cops about her husband having an affair, and then she rants about not having the best TV sound speakers.

Later that night, Ari falls sick and is admitted back to the hospital. Jo-kang stands outside the hospital, getting wet in the rain. But when Ari's uncle tells him to come inside, Jo-kang replies that he's obeying Ari's instruction not to cross her line on the ground.  Jo draws designs on the grassy lawn, and takes Ari there against doctor's orders, telling her to fulfill her destiny to leave the planet. Ari passes the last moments of her life telling Jo-kang that she loves and pities him for believing everything she said. Jo-kang then sees a flying saucer appear in the night sky, signifying Ari's death.  In the final scene, Jo-kang goes on with his life, narrating in [[voice-over]] that the scent of love that Ari left still lingers. He prefers to believe that she's living on another planet, waiting for the day that they will meet each other again.

She also shares a room with Catherine, who tends to bully people, and Colins, a student with a nervous disposition.  Simone is a dependable and respectable teacher who occasionally bends the rules out of concern for her students. Her personal life is synonymous with abiding by the conventions of society and religion. Annabelle is her antiagent – with unrestrained behavior, unconventional choices and outright defiance for authority.  Annabelle receives a stern rebuke from the principal, Mother Immaculata, for audaciously flaunting her Buddhist prayer beads. Simone is given the responsibility of controlling her. At first, Simone requests that the principal move Annabelle to another dormitory but soon notices her maturity and sensitivity and convinces her to comply with the school regulations. In the process Annabelle falls in love with Simone.  Simone resists Annabelle’s delicate overtures until they are left alone at the school during spring break. Simone drives Annabelle to her beach house where Annabelle discovers painful personal details about Simone’s past. Annabelle holds Simone tightly in her arms as Simone breaks down. A deep emotional connection is established between the two.  Simone fights a hard battle with herself but is eventually overpowered by Annabelle’s relentless pursuit. At the annual school dance, Annabelle goes up on stage with her guitar and sings a song for Simone. Simone, who is confused, runs outside, but Annabelle catches up with her. They kiss and return to Simone's room to make love.  The next morning, Mother Immaculata walks in on them getting dressed and demands to see Simone in her office immediately. On being questioned if she did the right thing Simone admits that she loves Annabelle. Government officials arrest Simone, and just as she is leaving, Annabelle places her most prized possession &ndash; the Buddhist prayer beads &ndash; in her hands.  Annabelle tearfully looks at her pictures taken by Simone at the beach house while Simone is driven away.

Lucky Number Slevin
 Two bookies are separately ambushed and murdered by their unseen killers; elsewhere, a young man is killed by a sniper. In a bus terminal, a young man is approached by Goodkat, who tells the story of Max and the [[Kansas City Shuffle]]: two decades earlier, Max borrowed money from the mob to bet on a fixed horse race, only for the horse to die mid-race. To set an example to make sure nobody else would try to bet on a fixed race, the mob killed Max, his wife and young son Henry. Goodkat concludes that a "Kansas City Shuffle" is a misleading [[double bluff]], and so tricks and kills the young man, before loading his body into a truck.  In New York City, Slevin Kelevra is staying in his friend Nick Fisher's apartment and, upon being visited by Nick's neighbor Lindsey, discusses Nick's disappearance and why his apartment was unlocked. Lindsey suggests that Nick may be missing and, after she leaves, Slevin is kidnapped by two henchmen, who take him to "The Boss". Mistaking Slevin for Nick, The Boss orders him to repay a large gambling debt or kill the son of his rival, "The Rabbi"; The Boss believes The Rabbi is responsible for assassinating his son (seen in the intro), and wants The Rabbi's homosexual son, Yitzchok "The Fairy", to be killed in revenge. Slevin then returns to the apartment, but is kidnapped again by two Jewish henchmen working for The Rabbi. The Rabbi also mistakes Slevin for Nick, and also demands he repay a large gambling debt. Slevin returns to The Boss and agrees to kill The Fairy. Concurrently with Slevin visiting the mob bosses, it becomes apparent Goodkat is involved in both sides and is responsible for Nick's debts being called in, and he plans to kill Slevin after The Fairy dies and make it look like they were both killed by a jealous lover (though Goodkat's motivations as to why remain unknown).  Slevin and Lindsey go out to dinner, where Slevin arranges a date with The Fairy. Slevin is approached by Detective Brikowski, who is investigating The Boss and The Rabbi. The detective hassles him again later and Slevin reveals his full name. Slevin arrives at The Fairy's apartment and fatally shoots him, only for Goodkat to appear; rather than shoot Slevin, however, he finishes The Fairy, who pulls out a gun, revealing Slevin and Goodkat are affiliated. Slevin then brings the bus terminal victim's body, revealed to be Nick, into the apartment while Goodkat kills The Fairy's bodyguards. Together, they blow up the apartment and the bodies, faking Slevin's death in the process. Goodkat and Slevin kidnap The Boss and The Rabbi, with both awakening restrained in The Boss's penthouse. Slevin appears and explains the overarching twist: Slevin is Henry, the son of the ill-fated Max, and the mobsters who killed Max were The Boss and The Rabbi. Goodkat is revealed as the assassin hired to kill young Henry, who after an attack of conscience took him in and raised him instead.  Twenty years later, Goodkat and Slevin killed The Boss' son and both mobsters' bookies, stealing the bookies' ledgers in the process. After finding that Nick owed a great deal of money to both sides, they killed him and stole his identity. As gang warfare loomed, both mobsters went to Goodkat, who agreed to both kill and protect The Fairy on the condition they call in Nick's debts, granting Slevin and Goodkat unhindered access to the heavily guarded mobsters and Nick Fisher as an ally respectively. After revealing his plan, Slevin suffocates The Rabbi and The Boss by taping plastic bags over their heads, killing them the same way they killed his father. Since Lindsey earlier photographed Goodkat for Slevin, Goodkat shoots her to protect his identity. Finally, it is revealed that Brikowski killed Slevin's mother when his own gambling debts were called in by the mobsters; Slevin kills Brikowski as the pseudonym "Slevin Kelevra" is explained: "Lucky Number Slevin" was the horse his father had bet on, and "Kelevra" is Hebrew for "bad dog," mirroring Goodkat's name.  Sometime later at the bus terminal, Slevin is met by Lindsey, and it is revealed that Slevin, aware of Goodkat's intentions, explained his true identity to her and helped fake her death. Goodkat appears, aware of the trickery; since Goodkat spared Slevin as a boy, he sympathizes and agrees to let her live.

Macbeth (2006 film)
 In a cemetery the Weird Sisters, three school girl witches, are destroying and defacing headstones and statues, while close by Lady Macbeth weeps beside a headstone marked "beloved son" and Macbeth stands by. The three witches plan to meet with Macbeth later, and leave the cemetery.  Macbeth leads Duncan's gang to a drug deal with Macdonwald and his men. In a gunfight between the gangs, all of Macdonwald's gang are killed. While chasing two gunmen, Banquo and Macbeth are led to the Cawdor Club. They seize the club and kill the owner.  Duncan hands the club over to Macbeth, and Macbeth and [[Banquo]] celebrate by drinking the club's alcohol and taking pills found on a table. During this drug trip Macbeth meets the three witches, who prophesy that he will soon be in Duncan's position with control over the gang. He tells his wife this, though she doubts he has it in him to take over Duncan's position. Later when she learns that Duncan will be dining and staying at their house, she plots with her husband to kill him.  Lady Macbeth drugs Duncan's bodyguards, and while they sleep Macbeth takes their knives and kills Duncan, framing the guards. Macduff comes to Inverness and finds Duncan murdered in his bed. Before the bodyguards can profess their innocence Macbeth shoots them. Malcolm, Duncan's son, immediately suspects Macbeth as having something to do with his father's death and flees.  After Macbeth is hailed as the new leader by most of Duncan's gang Macbeth sends two murderers to kill Banquo and his son, Fleance. The murderers kill Banquo, but Fleance escapes. Macbeth holds a celebratory dinner, and after learning that Banquo has been killed, sees a vision of Banquo's ghost at the dining table. Macbeth is becoming shaken by his desire for power. Lennox, Ross and others suspect Macbeth of killing Duncan and Banquo.  Macbeth finds the three witches in his house that evening and, after drinking a foul potion and engaging in an orgiastic sexual encounter with them, asks the witches of his future. He is told to fear Macduff, but no man "of woman born shall kill you". Later it is revealed that Macduff is not a natural birth, but a caesarean section, which is not "of woman born". He is also shown a vision of Fleance being hailed as gang leader. These prophecies enrage Macbeth, as does the witches' quick disappearance, and he has the murderers go to Macduff's home and brutally kill Lady Macduff and her son.  Lennox and Ross go to tell Macduff who has gone to his uncle Siward. Malcolm convinces him that Macbeth has gone much too far in his quest for power and must be stripped of his leader status.  Lady Macbeth has become more insane, re-imagining the evening of Duncan's killing and tries to wash off his blood from her hands. A doctor sedates her, and Macbeth appears indifferent to her instability. He prepares for the impending attack from Macduff, Lennox and Ross. Lady Macbeth commits suicide in a bath tub by slashing her wrists, enraging Macbeth. The two murderers, realising the unlikeliness of surviving the attack, swiftly flee Dunsinane leaving Macbeth with only Seyton, his main bodyguard, and two others. The murderers run into Macduff and his associates at the edge of Burnham Wood and are shot.  Malcolm leads his men to Dunsinane where they ambush the house and a gunfight ensues. Macbeth is chased to the cellar where he faces off with Macduff and is stabbed in the stomach. He stumbles upstairs to his bedroom, where the body of Lady Macbeth lies, and dies at her side.

Madea's Family Reunion
 After [[Madea]] ([[Tyler Perry]]) violates the terms of her [[house arrest]] (which she was subjected to in [[Diary of a Mad Black Woman (film)|the previous film]]), [[Mablean Ephriam|the judge]] orders her to take in a troubled [[foster child]] named Nikki ([[Keke Palmer]]) in order to avoid jail.   Lisa Breaux ([[Rochelle Aytes]]), one of Madea's nieces, is engaged to Carlos Armstrong ([[Blair Underwood]]), an [[Domestic violence|abusive]] and controlling [[investment banking|investment banker]]. While she desperately wants to get out of the engagement, her mother, Victoria ([[Lynn Whitfield]]), urges her to go through with the wedding, telling Lisa to avoid doing things that make Carlos angry, because Victoria is a conniving gold digger. Vanessa (Lisa Arrindell Anderson), the other of Madea's nieces, who lives with her, has two children fathered by two different men, neither of whom is involved in their children's lives; Victoria regularly degrades Vanessa for this, even referring to her grandchildren as "bastards". Vanessa is successfully, though through some struggle, wooed by poetry-spouting bus driver Frankie Henderson ([[Boris Kodjoe]]), who is the single father of a young son, and has a passion for painting. As much as Vanessa likes Frankie, she is emotionally closed off and has a difficult time trusting him.   Lisa eventually leaves Carlos with the intention of calling off the wedding, temporarily moving in with Madea. Carlos, eager to move forward with the wedding, dispatches Victoria to bring her back to him. Victoria confronts Carlos about the abuse, suggesting that insecurity about his masculinity is causing him to act out and that he needs counseling. Carlos counters by suggesting that she's controlling every aspect of Lisa's life because she wants to make up for all of the shortcomings in her own. It is then revealed that Victoria, with Carlos's assistance, has stolen from Lisa's [[Trust law|trust fund]] over the years, leaving virtually no money left, and is now encouraging Lisa to marry Carlos in order to keep up her livelihood. Carlos makes it clear to Victoria that he will not bail her out unless the wedding goes forward. Victoria goes to Madea's house to fetch Lisa, only to end up in a passionate argument with Vanessa, who has become aware of Carlos's abuse and is eager to protect her sister.  During the confrontation, Vanessa reveals a shocking secret to her younger sister: Victoria allowed her second husband, Lisa's father, to [[rape]] Vanessa in order to keep him in the marriage. Vanessa states that the [[sexual abuse]] occurred on a regular basis after that, which as a result, left her closed off emotionally and unable to trust the men in her life, including Frankie. Even more shockingly, Victoria makes no attempt to deny Vanessa's accusations. Instead, she rationalizes her actions, telling her daughters that they would have been destitute if Lisa's father had left, and that after going through a previous divorce with Vanessa's father and working two jobs to support the family afterwards, she was tired of struggling and felt that she deserved better. She also reveals that her own mother, a prostitute and [[Addiction|drug addict]], regularly traded her for "ten dollars and a fix", essentially almost mirroring what she'd done with Vanessa and Lisa's father.  Victoria then states that she would not allow Vanessa to ruin her happiness, and that she would not apologize for the choices she'd made. She then turns on a horrified Lisa, demanding that Lisa begin taking care of her financially as she made sure that Lisa had the best of everything while she was growing up. Victoria then leaves and later lies to Lisa, telling her that Carlos has agreed to counseling. Lisa returns to Carlos and resumes her wedding plans. At the family reunion, held at the home of ninety-six-year-old Aunt Ruby (Georgia Allen), Vanessa and Victoria get into another verbal confrontation, which eventually turns into a physical fight after Victoria insults Vanessa about her relationship with Frankie in front of the family. The fight is broken up when Myrtle, ([[Cicely Tyson]]) Madea's daughter-in-law, and Aunt May ([[Maya Angelou]]) gather the family members to an old shack the family's ancestors grew up in. They, along with some of the older members of the family, express appellation and disappointment at how the family has turned out and Myrtle gives a long speech convincing them to act better to each other and to themselves.  On the day of Lisa's wedding, Madea tells her to stand up against Carlos and fight back. When he arrives at Madea's house, he asks that he and Lisa be alone. Madea asks Carlos if he'd like something to eat, and tells Lisa to give him some grits on the stove, noting to Lisa that they're ''hot''. When Madea leaves the house with Nikki, Carlos brutally slaps Lisa in the face, but then, in retaliation, she throws the pot of hot grits in his face, burning him badly, and then beats him with a frying pan, as Madea listens outside with laughter. She then takes off her ring and throws it at an injured Carlos before leaving.

 Tom Dobbs is host of a [[news satire|satirical news program]], where he taps into people's frustrations with the sharply divided, [[Special Interest Group|special interest]]-driven political climate. When an audience member suggests that he run for president, Dobbs laughs it off, but following an online groundswell of support, he announces on air that he will stand as a candidate. He gets on the ballot in 13 states and participates in one of the national debates with the Democratic incumbent, President Kellogg, and Republican candidate, Senator Mills.  Eleanor Green works at a the Delacroy voting machine company. Delacroy has been selected to provide machines for the Presidential election, driving its stock price higher. Shortly before the elections, Eleanor notices that the voting system does not work correctly and alerts the head of the company, James Hemmings, via an e-mail that he deletes.  Dobbs approaches the campaign seriously, to the chagrin of his manager, Jack Menken, and his show's producer, Eddie Langston. The night of the presidential debates, fed up with the other candidates' posturing, Dobbs finally shifts back into comedian mode, keeping the audience laughing while also making serious points. He continues his showman persona on the campaign trail, thoroughly shaking up the political landscape. While he surges in the polls, he only reaches 17% compared to the 40% each for Kellogg and Mills.  On Election Day, early returns show Kellogg beating Mills everywhere, exactly as Eleanor predicted the voting system would report. When results from the 13 states with Dobbs on the ballot start being reported, he sweeps them all, taking enough electoral votes to be elected President. When Eleanor confronts Hemmings that the results confirm the Delacroy computer error, senior executive Stewart turns her aside. While Dobbs and his team move from shock to celebration, Eleanor is attacked in her home and given an injection. The next day she displays dramatically erratic behavior and is sent to the hospital, where tests reveal high levels of multiple illegal drugs.  Her work mate, Danny, visits her in hospital and reveals he has been promoted, which she thinks is an effort to buy him off.  He tries to convince her that she has a drug habit and that no one will believe her if she goes public, but she decides that Dobbs will believe her.  Eleanor travels to Washington and impersonates an FBI agent in order to talk with Dobbs. She explains that she was recently fired by Delecroy, but Dobbs is pulled away before she can explain about the election results. Dobbs tries to contact Eleanor by calling Delacroy's headquarters, with Hemmings telling him that she was fired due to a drug problem.  Eleanor figures out the flaw in Delacroy's system &ndash; no matter the actual results, the system declares the winner as the name with double letters, in alphabetical order, so that Do"bb"s beats Kello"gg", which beats Mi"ll"s. Eleanor calls Dobbs and he whisks her off to a Thanksgiving celebration with his friends. He is smitten by her, and tells her he already knows about her drug problem. She denies any drug problem, and finally tells him that the election result was wrong, then leaves. Dobbs wrestles with the issue, then calls and tells Eleanor that he will break the news the next day. She calls and tells Danny, who provides the information to Stewart, who preempts Dobbs' public announcement by announcing that Eleanor was caught attempting to throw the election for Dobbs, but that her efforts had no impact on the polls. Dobbs' team turns against Eleanor, but Dobbs doesn't.  Eleanor sees the news and becomes increasingly concerned, a feeling that is soon justified when she sees Delacroy agents break into her motel room and take her computer.   Eleanor flees to the protection of a crowded mall, but is followed and apprehended by a Delacroy agent. She escapes and calls Dobbs from a pay phone, but another Delacroy agent drives his truck into the phone booth. Dobbs goes to the scene and talks with the injured Eleanor in her ambulance, where she convinces him with the logic about the double letters.  His friends tell him to just be president, since polls now show that 60% of the nation has decided that they want him. That night, invited onto the [[Weekend Update]] segment of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', he announces to the public that the Delacroy vote system was flawed, that Eleanor told her bosses before the election but they covered it up and silenced her, and that he will not run in the new election that must now take place.  President Kellogg wins a second term. Dobbs returns to hosting his satirical news program, with Eleanor as his producer and later as his wife. The Delacroy executives are arrested. [[Time (magazine)|''TIME'' magazine]] chooses Dobbs as [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]].

However, a series of disturbing, [[Graphic violence|gory]] [[homicide]]s begin to terrorize Víctor's community, and the news of a "killer on the loose" are quickly spread. The media warns about the killer's habit of dismembering victims to the point of leaving them unrecognizable, and that the killer is a master of [[disguise]] with more than 300 victims.  The authorities, on the other hand, don't really seem to care much about the wellbeing of El Barrio's inhabitants. But the rebellious Víctor, far from dismayed by this lack of government interest, decides he will investigate the matter personally, as according to him, these are not just dead people anymore - they're dead Latinos. After consulting El [[Godparent|Padrino]], a [[santería]]-practising wise man, Víctor teams up with his delusional and odd friends in order to stop the killer, "Manga Latina" style.  Víctor's group, besides of Chucho, consists of Bello (beautiful), thin and paranoid, who is sure that the killer is after him for no particular reason; Ricky, a [[pothead]] and green-haired man, who is worried that the killer will get him because of his lightheadness; and the Sisters C.C., Claudia and Camila, who just join in to protect El Barrio. Nevertheless, all they seem to be able to do is hang around Rafa's cafeteria, where coffee is always free no matter what, waiting for the latest news on the killer's attacks, and driving around Chucho's car with a [[megaphone]] telling people to stay home.  Eventually, the media starts to give out vague hints to recognize the killer, so vague that the killer could be anybody. Regardless, Víctor starts to suspect an unnamed [[piñata]] maker, or a [[United Kingdom|British]] musician, both of whom make life impossible for the other inhabitants from El Barrio (one with his deformed piñatas, and the other with his loud annoying music).

From here the misery of the army officer starts. A twist in the story sends him to prison for serving a life term. After completing the sentence his search for his daughter starts again. This story is all about love, passion, hatred, betrayal and romance. Motivated from a true incident, which the director came across in 1996, the film brings out various facts of human behavior in a true Punjabi flavour and spirit.  
Manodu
 The film narrates the story of a young man Viswam (Bharat) who rises from utter poverty to riches, by unfair means like charging commission from creditors for recovering their loans, though advised against it by his parents and friends. All that he treats as important is money and thinks that there is nothing he cannot achieve with money. Saying so, he walks out of home. What kind of problems he and his like-minded friends face is the subject of the film. These friends work under the leadership of one Raghu (Priyadarshini Ram). Obviously they are in a 'dandha', a name often used for collecting money by force to enjoy life. 'Mirchi' - a girl with a story of her own behind her, lives with Ram and half a dozen members of the dandha, two of whom are girls. Most of the dialogues in these scenes show their wayward behavior and carefree life. Their solutions to problems too are strange. When a girl is gang raped – as the young man pretending love for her takes her to a room to rape her, ten others in the room too rape her - the leader orders that the one who pretended love for the girl to marry her. This he feels will be a punishment for the young man because it would make him suffer as he would recall every day what he had done to her.  There are many such other strange punishments. But not always do the members of the dandha display this kind of social consciousness and sense of justice. They charge huge sums for settling issues. Even the police department and its high officials are at beck and call of this gang. A rival gang starts functioning. They await a chance to wipe off this gang. They get the chance when Viswam falls in love with a girl (Radhika). He is the son of a schoolteacher, respected by persons from all sections of life – right from the police to the bureaucracy. When the police arrest Viswam, the father to get him released, runs from pillar to post only to learn in the end how bad his son is, and how he extracts money from others. He is a disappointed man and dies of a heart attack. The commissioner of police, also a student of the teacher, helps his son's release. This begins the destruction of the network he works for and his realization that this kind of negative approach would never be acceptable to society.  The film's theme and narration are peculiar. It looks a bit eccentric. The screenplay is quite confusing for an ordinary viewer. In spite of it, there is a method in this madness. Everything moves back and forth. The scenes are littered with too many characters. All are new faces. You don't know who is who. Director Ram plays the crucial role of leader Raghu. Like a professional he displays tremendous ease in his performance. Free verse is used for poetic expressions, which starts from the teacher and ends with his last statement on a paper before he breathes his last.  After watching the whole movie one, however gets an impression that this is not a film simply to be brushed off. The mode of narration though sounds peculiar and at times focused on women, wine and wealth has a message. Those who could go to extremes of disorderly life could also return to normal life. This is the message. Though novices to the art of drama, these young artistes – boys and girls - look talented. So are the music director and the other technicians of the film.

Marie Antoinette (2006 film)
 Fourteen-year-old [[Marie Antoinette|Maria Antonia]] is the beautiful, charming, and naive Archduchess of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], youngest of Empress [[Maria Theresa]]'s daughters. In 1770, the only one left unmarried among her sisters, she is sent by her mother to marry the [[Dauphin of France]], the future [[Louis XVI of France]], to seal an alliance between the two rival countries. Marie Antoinette travels to [[Kingdom of France|France]], relinquishing all connections with her home country, including her pet [[pug]] "Mops", and meets the King [[Louis XV of France]] and her future husband, Louis Auguste. The two arrive at the [[Palace of Versailles]], which was built by the King's great-grandfather. They are married at once and are encouraged to produce an heir to the throne as soon as possible, but the next day it is reported to the king that "nothing happened" on the wedding night.  As time passes, Marie Antoinette finds life at the court of Versailles stifling. Her husband's courtiers disdain her as a foreigner and blame her for not producing an heir, although the fault really lies with her husband, for the marriage remains unconsummated for an inordinate amount of time. The French court is rife with gossip, and Marie Antoinette consistently ruffles feathers by defying its ritualistic formality. Marie Antoinette also refuses to meet or speak with [[Madame du Barry|Jeanne Bécu, Madame du Barry]], the mistress of Louis XV. Over the years, Maria Theresa continues to write to her daughter, giving advice on how to impress and seduce the Dauphin. Unfortunately, Marie's attempts to consummate with her husband fail and the marriage remains childless. Marie spends most of her time buying extravagant clothes and gambling. After a masquerade ball, Marie and Louis return to find that the King has [[smallpox]]; he orders du Barry to leave Versailles, and soon dies. Louis XVI is crowned King of France, with Marie as Queen.  Marie Antoinette's brother, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] comes to visit, counseling her against her constant parties; advice that she finds easy to ignore. Joseph meets Louis XVI at the Royal Zoo and explains to him the "mechanics" of sexual intercourse in terms of "key-making", as one of the King's favorite hobbies is [[locksmith]]ing. Thereafter, the King and Marie Antoinette have sex for the first time, and on 18 December 1778, Marie Antoinette gives birth to a daughter, [[Marie Thérèse of France|Princess Marie Thérèse of France]]. As the infant royal matures, Marie Antoinette spends much of her time at the [[Petit Trianon]], a small chateau in the park of Versailles. It is also at this time that she begins an affair with [[Axel Fersen the Younger|Axel Fersen]]. As France's financial crisis worsens, food shortages and riots increase, her public image has completely deteriorated by this point: her luxurious lifestyle and seeming indifference to the struggles of the French people earned her the title "Madame Deficit."  As the queen matures, she focuses less on her social life and more on her family and makes what she considers to be significant financial adjustments. A year after her mother's death on 29 November 1780, Marie Antoinette gives birth to a son, Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France on 22 October 1781. She also gives birth to another son, [[Louis XVII of France]] on 27 March 1785, and another daughter, [[Princess Sophie Hélène Béatrice of France|Princess Sophie of France]] on 9 July 1786, who dies on 19 June 1787, a month before her first birthday. As the [[French Revolution]] erupts with the storming of the Bastille, the royal family resolves to stay in France, unlike most of the court. Rioting Parisians force the family to leave Versailles for Paris. The film ends with the royal family's transfer to [[Tuileries Palace]]. The last image is a shot of Marie Antoinette's bedroom, destroyed by angry rioters.

He recalled how he had a lot of fun and happy times with Bo. Ah Wah called for a taxi on his cell phone at least four times. Each time, he begged the taxi driver about his story, and how Bo will act if there is no taxi. For the last time, Ah Wah had tears in his eyes, but it was no use.  Bo saw how Ah Wah was serious about their marriage and burst out in tears. The couple reunited.  Bo and Ah Wah went to [[Japan]] with a discounted price for their make-up honeymoon. They took pictures and displayed them in their living room. They seemed happy.  However, at the end of the film, the director reveals that Josephine and Ah Wah, and Bo and Philip are still communicating. Josephine [[text message]]d Ah Wah, and Bo wrote a note on a piece of purple tissue paper to Phillip. Ah Wah was afraid that Bo might see him sending SMS (cell phone message), so he deleted after replying to it. Bo was afraid that Ah Wah might see her contacting Philip, thinking they're together, so she closed the door, and the story ends there.

Mater and the Ghostlight
 The short film opens with Mater playing [[pranks]] on the other residents of [[Radiator Springs]]: moving Red's flowers, bursting out from a pile of tires to scare Guido and Luigi, dressing up as a cone vampire to scare Sally, attempting to scare Lizzie while she's sleeping (which is unsuccessful), moving Fillmore's gas cans back outside while he takes them in, and jumpscaring Lightning McQueen when he believes Mater is hiding behind a pile of cans ready to jump out (what was really behind the pile of cans is one of Mater's signs). This sequence culminates with Mater teasing McQueen as if he had seen "[[the Spooklight|the Ghostlight]]," a [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] legend recounted to [[Pixar]] by Dean Walker of the [[Route 66 association#Kansas Historic Route 66 Association|Kansas Historic Route 66 Association]].<ref name="joplin-globe"></ref>  [[Sheriff (Cars)|Sheriff]] admonishes him for mocking the [[urban legend]]. When McQueen asks about the Ghostlight, Sheriff explains that the Ghostlight is a blue paranormal orb of light that haunts Radiator Springs, but Mater reminds Lightning that it isn't real. Sheriff points out that it ''is'' real, shocking them. He then tells everyone the tale of the Ghostlight, explaining the disappearance of a young couple that encountered it, leaving behind two "out-of-state license plates" and that it hates the sound of clanking metal. At this point, Mater is so scared that he begins making the noise that the Ghostlight hates the most and tries to stop himself. Sheriff ends the story with a warning that the Ghostlight could be anywhere. The rest of the gang say goodnight and turn off all the store lights, leaving a nervous and scared Mater all alone in the dark. Nervous, he returns to the junkyard and sees a shadow of a monster and, in a sudden shock, shines his light on it, revealing it to be just a pile of junk. After his headlight breaks, he enters his wall-less garage and closes the door, which then falls down. A light suddenly appears in front of him and he panics, believing it to be the Ghostlight until he realizes it is just a lighting bug. Suddenly, a blue light appears behind him. After using his mirror to observe it, he runs for it, thinking it is that Ghostlight.   During the body of the short, mayhem ensues as Mater is pursued by the Ghostlight, ultimately revealed to be just a lantern affixed to Mater's towing cable by Lightning and [[Guido (Cars)|Guido]]. He drives into Willy's Butte and wakes Frank and his tractors and goes into slow motion where he sounds like a bull. The other residents of Radiator Springs watch as Mater drives around frantically with the "Ghostlight" on his tail, before Mater tires himself out and discovers the truth. The cars tell him it was all a prank to pay him back for all his pranks he played on them. Sheriff gently tells Mater that the only thing to be scared of on Route 66 is "his imagination." [[Doc Hudson|Doc]] jokingly adds that all Mater really had to fear was "The Screaming Banshee" before they all leave Mater, alone and frightened once again.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Mater actually sees The Screaming Banshee but, not realizing it is him, warns him of the Banshee before departing, leaving the monstrous truck confused.

Mata (film)
 Movie starts with a taxi driver Venkatesha ([[Jaggesh]]) welcoming Sister Martha (played by Pari) to Bangalore. He needs to drive her to a [[matha]] in [[Thirthahalli]] and he starts narrating a story to make the journey interesting, interspersed with sub-stories.  The fore-said matha has an asylum taking care of handicapped orphans and a rare temple of [[Lord Brahma]].He narrates about this matha, whose chief is a skirt-chaser and goes to the extent of playing the flute to girls over the phone just to impress upon them. Soon enough, the chief decides to part with the post in order join his wife back.  In unique circumstances, the manager and administrator of matha, Appayya ([[R. N. Sudarshan]]) advertises in news papers declaring vacancy for "Chief of Matha". At this point, breaking the fourth wall, [[R. N. Sudarshan]] enacting the role of Appayya declines to read out the dialogues about placing a news paper ad about vacant Chief of Matha position. Director [[Guruprasad]] makes a cameo entry bombarding Appayya to enact his role, as he is paid to do just that viz., read out the dialogues.  The introduction scene of the film is fabulous as all the characters are invited with vedic hymns, "Asathoma Sadgamaya", which signifies the light in all directions. Tabla Nani as Venugopala nickname packet, Sudheendra as Chintamani, Shashidhar Bhat as Shashidhar bhat, Mandya Ramesh as Mandya Nagesh, [[Vaijanath Biradar]] as Kosta alias Sidda and Jaggesh as Venkatesha take the film on their shoulders. It is a great master piece that has every essence from crisp dialogues to a meaningful and soul stirring script.  The characters are neglected by the society, their quest for a societal status and food drives them to do all kinds of things to just remain in the training period as they want to avoid destitution. Givne that it is a multi layered plot, the narrator (Jaggesh) infuses tit-bits of stories to the viewer and seamlessly weaves them with the main plot. For example, the comedy scenes involving Nagaraj Murthy as a desperate king, who wants to build a mausoleum for his wife, are hilarious and signifies the hold on making the audience waiting for the intuitiveness of the next scene. Sudarshan has given a great modification of a cool head who always emphasize Dharma, manager's role orchestrated by Sadananda, who is at his comical best.  The story progresses through the many travails of all the six apprentices, who fight for their place under the sun. This process takes them on a journey which transforms their previous meaningless lives into a completely different dimension. The plot also explores the many illegal activities that run behind the scenes in a mutt.  In the end, Jaggesh and the others realize the true meaning of life, and they each adopt a profession best suited to their personality. Sister Martha is revealed to be a guardian angel for the financially ailing mutt when she donates a substantial amount of money for its betterment. The movie ends with Jaggesh thanking sister Martha, and Guruprasad and Sudarshan sharing a small but lively conversation about the outcome of the story.

Memories of Matsuko
  The story begins with Sho cleaning out the remaining belongings of his recently deceased aunt Matsuko.  Sho gradually learns many details of his aunt's life, and it is through his investigations that the audience learns the story of Matsuko's past.  In the 1970 - 1971, Matsuko was a popular junior high school teacher in [[Ōkawa, Fukuoka]].  However, she was [[sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] by [[vice-principal]], and when one of her students (Ryu) committed a theft, and Matsuko took the blame for him, this had terrible consequences for her life.  The film also reveals some details of Matsuko's earlier life, including a troubled childhood, when she struggled to gain the attention of her father.  Matsuko's father's affection was mostly dominated by her chronically ill sister, which created an imbalanced rivalry where Matsuko's needs were less likely to be met.  Matsuko's relationships with men were generally troubled as well.  She moved from relationship to relationship with men who gave her some inkling of affection, though it was often accompanied by abuse.  She often found herself abandoned by the men she loved, who couldn't cope with her neediness.  She continued to pursue her dreams of perfect love, even as her life spiraled down, and she found herself working as a prostitute, and even imprisoned.  When Matsuko met later in life with Ryu, whom she saved from the charges relating to his theft, she found that he held affection and admiration for her.  She saw in him another chance for true love.  But Ryu, by this time, was deeply entrenched in a criminal life.  He decided that it would be best for him to disappear from her life, to protect her from the risks of life with a gangster.  This final abandonment was disastrous for Matsuko, who never knew to what extent she affected the lives of the men who loved her. In July 9 2001, Matsuko was beaten to death by a gang of junior high school students in a park near [[Kita-Senju Station]].

She is laid to rest in a coffin full of sunflowers. Kōji and Kaoru's friends and family listen as Kaoru's CD is finally released. In the final scene Kōji rushes towards the waves with his mind replaying her voice.

Minotaur (film)
 In the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Bronze Age]], a shadow loomed over the village of Thena. Every three years, under [[Deucalion of Crete|King Deucalion]]'s order, eight youths are taken from the village to the capital of the Minos' Empire. There, they are placed in an underground [[labyrinth]] to be sacrifices to the [[Minotaur]], the [[Minoan religion|Minoan]] god.  Theo, son of Cyrnan, the village chieftain, is haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice. A [[Lepra|leprous]] prophetess tells him that Fion is still alive in the labyrinth. Against his father's wishes, he replaces one of the sacrifices and is taken to the Minos Empire capitol. Other captives are Danu (Theo's best friend), Morna (Danu's love interest), Tyro (who initially resents Theo because of his standing), Didi (Tyro's love interest), Vena, Ziko and Nan.  After the group are dropped into the labyrinth, the Minotaur immediately begins hunting them and kills Nan. The survivors are approached by [[Ariadne|Queen Raphaella]], Deucalion's sister and unwilling [[Incest|lover]], who offers them a way out. Vena does not believe her, and when she attempts to leave the group, the Minotaur impales her with its horn. The rest of the group evade the Minotaur and, led by Raphaella, they get to a chamber at the center of the labyrinth. There, the monster lies asleep on its victims's remains, and a heavy wooden door leads out of the labyrinth. Raphaella had arranged for her servant Ramaya to open the door from the other side, but Deucalion catches the servant and has her executed. Desperate, the group attempt to break down the door. The noise wakes the Minotaur, which kills Ziko and splits up the group.  Theo, Danu, and Morna encounter Turag, a villager from a previous offering. Turag has managed to elude the Minotaur thus far, but has become slightly insane over the years. Looking at the map of the labyrinth Turag has drawn, Theo learns of Fion's supposed location and goes off alone to find her. However, he eventually discovers her corpse, and realizes that she was poisoned by an underground [[Natural gas|gas]] deposit. Meanwhile, Tyro and Didi find one of the holes that they were dropped through. Tyro climbs up and reaches down to pull up Didi. As the Minotaur arrives, Didi panics, loses her grip and falls onto one of its horns. The Minotaur then corners Danu and Morna, and Danu sacrifices himself to save his lover.  Raphaella reaches Theo again and explains the Minotaur's origin. Her [[Pasiphaë|mother]] gave herself to [[bestiality]] to create a living god, and gave birth to the Minotaur. As the monster grew, so did its appetite, culminating in it murdering Deucalion's brother. Theo's village was blamed for the prince's death, resulting in the human sacrifices to appease the Minotaur while ensuring Minos' own survival. Raphaella sent the leper to find someone in the village capable of killing the Minotaur, and thus the leper lied to Theo about Fion's survival to make him face the beast.  Theo discovers the underground [[natural gas]] vent in the labyrinth. When the Minotaur prepares to kill Theo, Tyro sacrifices himself to distract it. Theo tempts the Minotaur into attacking him, and lures it towards the gas vent. He then creates a spark with Fion's amulet. The gas ignites, engulfing part of the labyrinth, while Theo and Raphaella survives by diving into a pond of water. They emerge from the water as the flames die out, and find the beast still alive and enraged. As the Minotaur charges at him, Theo takes the monster's horn which was broken earlier, and impales it in the mouth. It keeps charging forward, and collides with a rock which drives the horn through its head, finally killing it.  Theo and Raphaella reunite with Morna and Turag and leave the collapsing labyrinth. On the surface, they find out that the explosion also collapsed the palace and fatally wounded Deucalion. Raphaella smothers him to death, ending the cycle of fanaticism. The Minos' empire ends with the deaths of the Minotaur and Deucalion; Theo becomes a legend for killing the monster.  
Miss Potter
 The story begins with [[Beatrix Potter]] nervously packing her portfolio and narrating that she is a London [[spinster]], and that her ambition to become a children's author meets with wide disapproval. She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her [[The Tale of Peter Rabbit|book]]. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure. The only reason they agreed to publish it is because they promised their younger brother, [[Norman Warne|Norman]], a project.  When Norman Warne visits Beatrix, they make decisions about her book regarding size, colour and price. Norman admits he has never done anything like this before but has given her book a great deal of thought. Beatrix realises what Norman's brothers have done regarding him and her, but they become determined to prove them wrong. Norman takes Beatrix to the printer, and she has her drawings reproduced and copies of her book sold. Thrilled, Beatrix and Norman visit the Warne family, where Beatrix meets the wheelchair-bound but lovely Mrs. Warne, and Norman's sister, Amelia, nicknamed "Millie". Millie has decided that she and Beatrix are going to be friends and is overjoyed that Beatrix is a spinster, as is Millie, who believes men to be nothing but bores. The family befriends Beatrix, yet Helen Potter, Beatrix's social-climbing mother, is unhappy about her daughter spending time in the company of 'tradesmen'.  When she returns home, Beatrix and Helen bicker about Beatrix's stubborn decision not to marry. Beatrix reminds her mother of the book she wrote, and her mother retorts she believes the venture will fail. However, the book sales are very successful and copies are displayed in many store windows. Norman encourages Beatrix to submit other stories for publication. Even Beatrix's father, Rupert, buys a copy of [[The Tale of Two Bad Mice|one of her books]] after hearing how his friends at the [[Reform Club]] were buying them. Encouraged by this success and her father's support, Beatrix invites Norman and Millie to her family's Christmas party, despite her mother's misgivings. At the party everyone enjoys themselves and Beatrix shows Norman a story she is writing especially for him, "The Rabbits' Christmas Party". She shows him a drawing from the story and shows him her studio where she writes and draws. Miss Wiggin falls asleep from too much brandy (a generous portion of which had been added to her coffee cup by Norman), and Norman plucks up the courage to propose to Beatrix. Mrs. Potter interrupts before Beatrix can reply, and they join the other guests in the drawing room. Beatrix confides in Millie about Norman proposing, and Millie encourages her to say yes. Beatrix then tells the guests of the stories she writes and they are delighted and amused. Mrs. Potter, however, can not see what all the fuss is about. As the guests leave, Beatrix whispers her agreement to marry Norman, who is overjoyed.  Norman visits Rupert Potter at his club to ask his consent, and is dismissed within minutes. At the Potter household, Beatrix and her parents argue about her decision to marry Norman. Beatrix is adamant and will not be dissuaded. Mrs. Potter tells her no Potter can marry into trade, but Beatrix reminds her that her grandfathers were both tradesmen. When Mrs. Potter threatens to cut her daughter off, Beatrix reminds them of her brother, Bertram, who married a wine merchant's daughter and was not disowned. She states she can survive on her own with her books. Mr. Potter attempts to reason with his daughter, but she tells him she wants to be loved and not simply marry someone because he can provide for her.  Beatrix inquires with the bank about her royalty earnings, wondering if she would perhaps someday be able to buy a house in the country. She is amazed and delighted to learn that her book sales have made her wealthy enough to buy several estates and a house in town if she wishes. When she returns home her parents offer a proposition: that Beatrix keep her engagement to Norman a secret and holiday with them in the Lake District for the summer. If she still wishes to marry him at the end of the summer, they agree that they will not object to the marriage. Beatrix agrees to the proposition and is quite convinced that she will not change her mind, telling her parents to prepare for an October wedding.  Norman and Beatrix kiss each other goodbye at the railway station and write many letters during their time apart, until one day a letter arrives from his sister Millie, informing her that Norman is ill. Beatrix travels back to London only to find that Norman has died. Overcome with grief, Beatrix shuts herself up in her room. She turns to her drawing, but discovers that her characters disappear off the page. Millie comes to visit and comfort her, and Beatrix decides she must leave the house.  Beatrix buys a farm in the country in the Lake District and moves there to resume her work. She hires a farmhand to run the farm and finds comfort in her surroundings. With the help of her solicitor, William Heelis, she outbids developers at auctions and buys many other farms and land in the area to preserve nature. In captions, it is explained that eight years after moving to the Lake District she marries William (to her mother's disapproval) and the land she purchased eventually forms part of the [[Lake District National Park]] in [[North West England]].  
Mini's First Time
 Mini Drogues ([[Nikki Reed]]) is a clever and adventurous [[high school senior]] who is bored with her life. Mini prizes her "unique experiences" (she calls them "firsts"). For excitement, and to add to her list of firsts, Mini decides to try being a [[call girl]]. Her first client, however, has a guilty conscience and can't carry through with the act, which disappoints Mini. Her second client is decidedly more exciting: her stepfather Martin ([[Alec Baldwin]]). Martin is initially shocked when he learns of her identity (he initially blindfolded himself during intercourse per Mini's request), but soon a torrid love affair blossoms between the two.  In order to be together, Mini and Martin concoct a plan to have Mini's mother Diane ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]) declared insane. When their plan fails, Mini convinces Martin to murder Diane, despite his initial resistance to the idea. They attempt to make it appear that Diane committed [[suicide]], but they soon attract the attention of a detective ([[Luke Wilson]]) who believes that Mini and Martin killed her. A nosy neighbor, Mike ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), is sexually obsessed with Mini, and when Martin learns that Mini had gone to Mike's house and had received sexual pictures from him, he and Mike get into a fight. Mini arrives to find Martin standing over the neighbor, ready to beat him into unconsciousness, and when the police arrive they arrest Martin.  Mini visits Martin in jail and admits that the sexual pictures sent were actually from her in order to get Martin to think that the neighbor sent them. She also reveals that she assumed the police would eventually believe he killed Diane (since he was the more likely perpetrator). Mini, therefore, ends up getting away with murder, and inherits her mother's fortune. The film ends with Mini giving a valedictorian speech, even though she is a C student; the school gave her [[Pass by catastrophe|straight A's out of sympathy]] for her mother's death. She offers advice to the graduating class about how to live a good life, that perversely alludes to her crimes without making her look too suspicious. The detective is present at the speech, clearly still suspicious of Mini, but knowing that he will probably never be able to prove that she was guilty of murdering her mother.

The Minder
 Rubén (Chávez) is excellent in his job, but in the midst of an [[existentialist]] crisis, he begins to suffer from the emptiness of his life - having sworn to protect Artemio (Núñez), a man who barely acknowledges his presence or merit; a man with whom, in fact, has little dialogue or contact throughout the movie, even when they share the screen most of the time.  Rubén has little to no private life as well: his sister is a wreck, her daughter, spoiled; he visits prostitutes in his spare time and is unappreciated by those who surround him at work. His only real relationship is Artemio's driver, Salinas (Adrian Andrade), whose simplicity does not suffice Rubén.  Eventually, Rubén snaps: tired of his boss' infidelity to his wife, his downright hypocrisy and disdainful manner towards him, he frequents an illegal arms dealer, purchasing a gun with a silencer. When his boss suffers a heart attack, Rubén is left to take care of him, and soon he shoots Artemio offhand - the one person who is supposed to protect him from a threat that remains invisible in the film. He then runs away to [[Mar del Plata]], where the last scene has Rubén contemplating the sea he never swam ([[foreshadow]]ed earlier in the movie, during a visit to the city).

Mission: Impossible III
 [[Ethan Hunt]] has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's true job. He is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner [[Luther Stickell]].  The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic [[microdot]] under the stamp.  IMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in [[Vatican City]] to obtain [[MacGuffin|a mysterious object]] called the "Rabbit's Foot". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.  On the flight back to the U.S., Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about the Rabbit's Foot, but Davian remains tightlipped. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel]] is attacked, and Davian escapes. Ethan races to Julia's workplace, only to find she has already been kidnapped. Davian gives Ethan 48 hours to recover the Rabbit's Foot in exchange for Julia's life, but Ethan is soon captured by the IMF.  Musgrave takes part in Ethan's interrogation but discreetly [[Lip reading|mouths]] that the Rabbit's Foot is located in [[Shanghai, China]], and provides Ethan with the means to escape. Ethan escapes IMF headquarters, travels to Shanghai, and acquires the Rabbit's Foot along with his team. As he delivers the Rabbit's Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, he realizes a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. The restrained Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit's Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves.  Musgrave arrives and explains that the woman killed was not Julia, but Davian's head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbit's Foot. Julia is alive and being held as hostage. Musgrave reveals himself as the mole. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit's Foot and sell it to a terrorist group, so that IMF would have reasons to launch a preemptive strike.   When Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan knocks him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave's phone to track the last call's location to find Julia. He arrives and finds the place, but encounters Davian. Davian triggers the micro-explosive in Ethan's head, but Ethan kills him and then jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Before electrocuting himself, he kisses Julia and teaches her how to use his [[Beretta 92]] to defend herself. While Ethan is unconscious, Musgrave and a henchman arrive and Julia shoots them dead. She successfully revives Ethan and he explains his true IMF career to her.  Back in the U.S., Ethan is congratulated by Brassel as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.

Preetam, unaware that Jaanu has vowed not to allow anyone near Nandini, trashes Jaanu and his gang in revenge.  In Madikeri, Preetam unexpectedly meets Nandini. He identifies himself and expresses his love towards her and offers to tie the watch as an indication for their marriage. Nandini, who is already engaged, rejects his request.

However, when Nandini walks towards him, offering an umbrella, he is under a state of intoxication and tells Nandini that he'd better stay away from Nandini to remain a decent boy, rather than to propose or elope with her.  Nandini is now in love with Preetam and is in a dilemma as her wedding is due in a few days.

After the three men leave, two of Dylan's delinquent friends are slain by Jingles while trying to steal his tombstone for a prank that they, Guinness's daughter Melanie, and a reluctant Dylan intend to play on Angie at a birthday party Heidi is setting up for her.  In his home, the stranger tells Guinness that he believes that it is not a [[Copycat crime|copycat]] and that Jingles has actually come back from the dead. The stranger (who reveals he was once employed at the penitentiary where Jingles was placed and witnessed the tortures inflicted on Jingles that drove him mad) presents occult objects that he found in Jingles's prison cell as evidence, prompting Guinness to remember that Jingles did chant something in a strange language as he lay dying. The two grab the items necessary to banish Jingles, who confronts them as they go to leave, killing the stranger, and wounding Guinness.  While Angie, Heidi, and Heidi's friends are partying in the Jameson house, Melanie dresses up like Jingles with the intent of crashing the celebration, only to be axed by the real Jingles. Jingles breaks in and kills Heidi, Dylan, and the rest of the revelers, leaving only Angie. An unknown amount of time later, Baines and two police officers enter the house, and find a hysterical Angie clutching Jingles's axes, making it appear as if she is the murderer.

She lives near a pond where there are two types of Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.  In the present, Ginko, to escape a blizzard, finds a village inn. After revealing himself as a Mushishi, he is asked to help several locals suffering from hearing loss. After he helps the locals, Ginko is asked by the innkeeper to look at her granddaughter, Maho, who is deaf, has horns on her forehead, and hears strange noises. Maho's mother had the same symptoms and was cremated after her death. Maho, however, kept her mother's horns, which turned out to be a disguised Mushi and the cause of her illness. Ginko heals the girl and then continues on his journey.  Ginko receives a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her to write about Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi who is trying to capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and [[gangrene]]. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.  Ginko faces the Tokoyami itself in the writings warehouse, while Tama and Koro try to remove the Tokoyami by [[bloodletting]]. The newly healed Tanyu accompanies Tama and Koro to the warehouse, where they find a collapsed Ginko. Tanyu begins to remove the writings from Ginko's body and reattach them to the parchments. After Tanyu removes the writings, Ginko awakens and continues on with Koro. The pair finds the rainbow-like Mushi. After this, they part ways, and Koro goes back to his hometown to build bridges. Ginko faces a Tokoyami-possessed Nui and carries her to the River of Light (or Koumyaku), a stream of glittering Mushi called Kouki—the origin of Mushi life.

Ignacio gets used to losing some fights, but after a while, he gradually grows annoyed with the consistent losses. Steven brings him to a water gypsy who tells Ignacio to climb to an eagle's nest, crack open the egg and swallow the yolk, claiming that he will gain the powers of an eagle. Ignacio completes the task, but still loses the next several bouts, frustrating him. He seeks advice from champion ''luchador'' Ramses, but Ramses is vain and in no mood to help aspiring wrestlers.  Ignacio's secret is finally exposed to the entire monastery when his robe catches fire during church, exposing his wrestling costume. He admits that he is Nacho and tells them that he intends to fight at a battle royale between eight luchadores for the right to take on Ramses, and for a cash prize, which he will use to buy a bus for the orphans. But the wrestler Silencio wins the match; Nacho comes in second place. Banished from the monastery, Ignacio leaves to live in the nearby wilderness.  The next morning, Steven comes to tell him that Silencio has been injured (Steven ran over his foot with Ignacio's bike) and cannot fight, meaning that Nacho—as the second-place finisher—receives the right to fight Ramses. Ignacio and Steven agree to team up again. That night, Ignacio sends a message via Steven to Encarnación, explaining his plan and confessing his love to her (as a sister).  Despite initial difficulty, Nacho does well in the match. When the crowd begins to support Ignacio, Ramses resorts to cheating. Nacho is nearly defeated—indeed, unmasked—by Ramses, when Encarnación enters the arena with the orphans. Elated and inspired, Nacho rallies himself and defeats Ramses.  Ignacio becomes a professional wrestler and, true to his word, buys a bus for the orphans with his prize money. The film closes with Ignacio, Steven and Sister Encarnación taking the children on a field trip to the city of [[Monte Albán]].

The Namesake (film)
 ''The Namesake'' depicts the struggles of Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli ([[Irrfan Khan]] and [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), first-generation immigrants from the [[East India]]n state of [[West Bengal]] to the United States, and their American-born children Gogol ([[Kal Penn]]) and Sonia ([[Sahira Nair]]). The film takes place primarily in [[Kolkata]], [[New York City]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] state suburbs.  The story begins as Ashoke and Ashima leave Calcutta and settle in New York City. Through a series of miscues, their son's nickname, Gogol (named after Ukrainian author [[Nikolai Gogol]]), becomes his official birth name, an event which will shape many aspects of his life. The story chronicles Gogol's cross-cultural experiences and his exploration of his Indian heritage, as the story shifts between the United States and India.   Gogol becomes a lazy, pot smoking teenager indifferent to his cultural background. He resents many of the customs and traditions his family upholds and doesn't understand his parents. After a summer trip to India before starting college at Yale, Gogol starts opening up to his culture and becomes more accepting of it.   After college, Gogol uses his "good name" Nikhil (later shortened to Nick). He works as an architect and dates Maxine ([[Jacinda Barrett]]), a white woman from a wealthy background, who is clueless about their cultural differences. Gogol falls in love with Maxine and introduces her to his parents, who struggle to understand his modern, American perspectives on dating, marriage and love. They are hesitant and guarded when meeting her. Gogol gets along with Maxine's family and feels closer to them than he does his own family.   Before he goes to Ohio for a teaching apprenticeship, Ashoke tells Gogol the story of how he came up with his name. Shortly after, while Gogol is on a vacation with Maxine's family, Ashoke dies. Grieving, Gogol tries to be more like what he thinks his parents want him to be and begins following cultural customs more closely. He grows distant from Maxine and eventually breaks up with her.   Gogol rekindles a friendship with Moushumi ([[Zuleikha Robinson]]), the daughter of family friends. They begin dating and soon after get married. However, the marriage is short lived as Moushumi, bored with being a wife, begins having an affair with an old boyfriend from Paris. Gogol divorces her, while Ashima blames herself for pressuring Gogol to marry a fellow Bengali. Gogol returns home to help Ashima pack the house when he finds the book Ashoke gave him as a graduation present. Searching for comfort, and accepting his new life alone, Gogol finally reads the stories written by his namesake on the train home.  As well as depicting Gogol/Nikhil's experiences, the film describes the courtship and marriage of Ashima and Ashoke, and the effect on the family from Ashoke's early death from a massive heart attack. Through experiencing his father's funeral rites on the banks of the [[Ganges]], Gogol begins to appreciate Indian culture. Ashima's decision to move on with her life, selling the suburban family home and returning to Calcutta, unifies and ends the story.

Looking for excitement in her life, she accepts a well-paying job in [[Istanbul]] at Suzer International, where she will begin by securing the Internet network of a Russian company. She tries to convince her boyfriend, James, to go with her, but he is reluctant and she breaks off their relationship. While she is talking to him at a café, her laptop crashes and then reloads, a small incident she ignores.  While flying alone the next day, she checks her bank account online. A friendly stewardess, Roxelana  ([[Şebnem Dönmez]]) serves her champagne and gives her a bracelet as a gift. As they talk, we see the money in her accounts drop to zero. When Hope arrives in Istanbul Airport, she is told by the immigration officer that she is having a tourist visa, which cannot be used for working purposes,  and is advised to go to the American consulate in order to have her soon expiring passport renewed. Exiting the airport she is approached by a taxi driver who takes her to the Sultanahmet Palace Hotel in Istanbul, where he says the Americans love to stay. She gets a room and as soon as she lies down the fire alarm rings, everyone has to go out, and she is told that the guests will have to stay out for almost an hour. She then meets an American known as Z.Z. Kelly Ross. They take a walk in the park and come across a seller selling scarves. When she returns to her hotel room to get her passport, discovers the new one issued by the American consulate contains the wrong name. It seems that her identity has been stolen.

She discovers $40,000,000 in her bank account and certain people are out to kill her. All people who knew her are found dead, including the taxi driver whom she met at the airport, who turns out to be a police officer. The police and Dr.Kavak don't believe her explanations, and accuse her for murdering the police inspector (the taxi driver) and the woman impersonating her, Z.Z.Kelly Ross. After an incident during her interrogation, she is given a shot,which puts her to sleep, and wakes up in a hotel room with her boyfriend, James, at her side. He calms her down that everything has been sorted out, but something in his speech makes her suspect him of taking part in all of this somehow. It turns out that he and Dr.Kavak ([[Demet Akbağ|Demet Akbag]]) are the people behind the conspiracy against her, and it all happened because those two wanted her skills in order to have money embezzled from Ivanakov, a Russian arms dealer. She is taken to the bank in order to withdraw the money, but on their way out they are waited by the Russians and she seems to be accidentally killed during a rampage. She is taken away in an ambulance, where she wakes up, never being hurt, but pretended to have been so that the mafia should stop hunting her. By her side is Roxelana, the stewardess, who is in fact an Interpol agent (and so is the skarf seller), who reveals that thanks to the bracelet she gave her in the airplane (which was in fact a homing beacon), her whereabouts were known to the police (for her protection) at all times.

Neelakanta (film)
 The film has the shades of his film 'Usire' and a Telugu film. Yet the film is tolerable because of the light up moment of glitz and glamour the mainstay of all Ravichandran films.

Neelakanta can give solution to any problems of his surroundings but he goes blank for his own problems. His mother disagrees to his accidental marriage and asks him not to see her face. On the other hand, his wife on compulsion suspects Neelanakanta to the extreme. That is because of Ganga in the house who has been brought to the house in her most difficult condition by Neelakanta. With no happiness around for him Neelakanta problems slowly dilute when his mother narrate the past of Neelakanta's master. How his wife Ganga change her track, what happens to Gowri, the sad end of mother and Neelakanta not able to see his mother, the putting down of goons in the meantime are all the remaining portions in the second half.

Night at the Museum
 Larry Daley is a divorced man from [[Brooklyn]], hoping to find a good job to impress his ten-year-old son Nick, but his ex-wife Erica believes he is a bad example for their son. Larry is hired at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to replace the retiring [[security guard]]s Cecil Fredericks, Gus, and Reginald. Larry meets the museum's neurotic curator Dr. McPhee, and very attractive [[museum docent]] Rebecca Hutman, who plans to write a [[dissertation]] on [[Sacagawea]]. On his first night, Cecil hands Larry an instruction manual on what to do in the museum, warning him not to let anything "in or out."  Larry soon discovers that at night, the museum's exhibits come to life and cause havoc for him. Amongst the lively exhibits are a playful ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' skeleton named Rexy; a mischievous [[capuchin monkey]] named Dexter who destroys the instructions; the warring miniature factions of [[cowboy]]s and [[Roman legion|legionnaires]] led by Jedediah and General Octavius; violent [[Attila the Hun]] and his army; a talking [[Easter Island Head]] that desires gum who calls Larry "dum dum"; the fire-seeking [[neanderthal]]s; and a wax model of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who is in love with Sacagawea.  Roosevelt explains to Larry that the exhibits have come to life every night since the arrival of an Egyptian artifact, the Tablet of Akhmenrah, the mummified pharaoh trapped in his sarcophagus. He also explains to Larry that as night guard, it is his job to make sure that no exhibit sets foot out of the museum, otherwise they will disintegrate into dust if the sun rises while they are outside. The next day, Cecil advises Larry to research history to make up for the instructions' destruction. He studies in libraries and from Rebecca. Larry puts his new knowledge to good use on his second night, but some of his plans backfire and the neanderthals set their exhibit on fire, leading to one becoming dust after venturing outside. After having doubts and almost getting fired the next day, Larry offers to introduce Sacagawea to Rebecca, but she thinks he is mocking her.  On his third night, Larry brings Nick to the museum to watch the exhibits come to life, but they strangely do not. They catch Cecil, Gus, and Reginald stealing artifacts, who explain the tablet's magic has allowed them to feel physically young in their old age, and plot to frame Larry for the theft while they enjoy a happy retirement. Nick activates the tablet, but Cecil steals it, locking Larry and Nick in the Egyptian exhibit. They free Akhmenrah, and rally the exhibits to stop the thieves and retrieve their colleagues who fled out into [[Central Park]]. Gus and Reginald are captured, but Cecil escapes by [[stagecoach]].  Larry and several exhibits give chase, where they stop Cecil and recover the tablet, using its magic to escort all of the exhibits back into the museum before sunrise. Rebecca witnesses this and makes amends with Larry and is subsequently introduced to Sacagawea. The next day, McPhee fires Larry after watching news reports of sightings of the exhibits last night, but once they start to leave the museum, they find out that the reports have caused an increased number of visitors, and Larry is immediately rehired. Near the end of the film, Larry, Nick, and the exhibits throw a party in the museum. During the credits, it is shown that Cecil, Gus, and Reginald have been forced to serve as museum janitors for their crimes.  
The Night Listener (film)
 Gabriel Noone ([[Robin Williams]]), a popular [[gay]] [[New York City]] radio show host, is dealing with a separation from his partner, Jess ([[Bobby Cannavale]]).

Diagnosed with [[AIDS]], the youth has been adopted by Donna Logand ([[Toni Collette]]), the [[social worker]] who handled his case.  Noone begins a telephone relationship with the boy and Donna. He and Pete become increasingly close and form a father-son relationship, much to the dismay of Jess, especially after he speaks to Donna and suspects she and the boy are the same person. Noone's personal secretary Anna ([[Sandra Oh]]) adds fuel to the fire by discussing her research into people who fabricate elaborate stories to get attention. Determined to prove the boy exists and his story is true, Noone decides to pay a surprise visit to Pete in his hometown in rural [[Wisconsin]]. Noone discovers the return address on Pete's correspondence is actually a [[Commercial mail receiving agency|mail drop]]. Soon after, while eating in a local diner, he overhears another patron and recognizes her voice as that of Donna. He's stunned to learn she's blind and uses a [[guide dog]]. Noone follows her home and Donna senses he has followed her. She invites him into her home and talks openly about Pete, who she says is currently in the hospital undergoing tests. She assures him he can visit the boy the following day, then suddenly becomes angry and tells him she will not allow him to meet her son. Increasingly suspicious, Noone contacts all the hospitals in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], the site of the nearest facilities, but none have the boy registered as a patient.  Noone's paranoia about the boy's existence grows and, hoping to find proof of his existence, he breaks into Donna's home. A [[police officer]] arrests him for [[breaking and entering]] and then, mistakenly believing him to be one of the boy's abusers, attacks him with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun baton]] before taking him to the station. Noone convinces the police he meant no harm and is released, only to find Donna waiting for him with the news that Pete is dead; also, that he was in a Milwaukee hospital, and was never in Madison. Distressed that Noone doesn't believe her, Donna collapses in the middle of a road and tries to hold him with her in the path of an oncoming truck. She then moves everything out of her home and disappears before the police can question her. Noone is now convinced that the boy is a figment of the deranged woman's imagination.  In response to a phone call from Donna, Noone goes to a motel where she was staying, and finds Pete's stuffed rabbit and a videotape under a blanket. He plays the video of a child, who seems to be Pete, but who could have been anyone. The phone rings and the caller claims to be the boy, waiting for his mother at the airport. The caller ends the conversation after Noone asks what happened in Donna's past and how she became blind. Pete's voice changes to sound more womanly, just as the conversation is cut off.  Noone returns to [[Manhattan]] and uses his experience to create ''The Night Listener'', a new radio story. In the final scene, Donna is searching for a new home in a coastal town, telling the realtor she needs it for herself and her son, who has just lost his leg but will be released the next day. She has drastically changed her appearance and no longer has a guide dog or dark glasses, revealing her blindness was also an act.

Nightmare Detective

Kagenuma is being haunted by the soul of a daughter whom his wife had aborted without his knowledge. Mitake refuses to help him.   Kagenuma wakes up in hospital next to the body of Mitake, and surrounded by Mitake's children. Kagenuma had been in Mitake's dream, to find out who should inherit his property, but cannot answer. As he leaves, Kagenuma telepathically hears the selfish thoughts of Mitake's children, and realises that a messy legal battle is about to commence.   Meanwhile, Lieutenant Keiko Kirishima (hitomi) has recently switched from the National Police Academy to a district police station. Her new colleagues, Detective Ishida ([[Ren Osugi]]) and Detective Wakamiya ([[Masanobu Ando]]) do not understand her, and are somewhat resentful of her qualifications. Her own prickly personality does not help matters; she interprets their casualness at crime scenes as a lack of professionalism. She is unable to stomach the gruesome scene at her first case, so Ishida mocks her.    Her first case is a young woman who has been found dead in her apartment, horribly slashed with a blade placed in her own hand. The fact that the apartment was locked from the inside convinces Ishida and Wakamiya that the case is a suicide; Kirishima is not so sure, as no note was left and a neighbour heard the victim crying out for help. Later, Kirishima's team is confronted by a similar case. A wife saw her husband slash himself to death while asleep in their bed.   Kirishima discovers a link between the two unrelated victims; both had last dialled the same number, a sequence not registered anywhere in the country. The recording of both conversations reveals a young woman saying "help me" over and over again. It is suspected that some form of hypnotic suggestion was used. Because of the strange nature of the cases, the chief of the division separates the investigators into two groups. One, led by Detective Ishida, is to carry out 'the standard procedure', while the other, led by Lieutenant Kirishima (and including Detective Wakamiya), is to investigate [[supernatural]] causes for the murders. This frustrates the rationalistic Kirishima. She and Wakamiya are directed to Kagenuma, who is described as a person with the power to enter dreams.  Kagenuma is very unwilling to help. He does not like to use his power. In fact he had just tried to kill himself, but kids from the neighborhood saved him. The police leave him.  Kirishima suggests calling the mysterious number. In the end Wakiyama makes contact but the woman (O) seems to know something is wrong. Soon after Wakiyama is attacked while asleep. Kirishima again asks the Nightmare detective to intervene. Wakamiya has fallen asleep on the couch in the police station. Kagenuma finally enters Wakiyama's dream and confronts O. Wakiyama is killed and Kagenuma ends up hurt. He want to escape, but Kirishima forces his hand by calling O herself. So he must enter her dream, or let her die. He reluctantly decides to try to save her. Meanwhile, the other squad is getting close to O in the real world.  As Kirishima is close to sleep, she speaks with O, wanting to know how he's able to go into minds. O reveals that he originally wanted to die alongside the first victim, but instead somehow crawled into her mind, feeling a rush and hunger to kill her. Wanting to feel the rush again, he continued to kill other people.  In the dream, Kirishima is chased around a derelict school, ultimately being confronted by her inner self, who berates her for her weakness. Eventually, O chases her into an old furnace, trapping her before being attacked by Kagenuma. Kagenuma unlocks a repressed memory of O, revealing that, as a child, his teacher locked him in the same furnace Kirishima is in, alongside his sister who is killed when trying to escape. (The little girl is revealed to be the one who originally said the repeated "help me.")

No Time for Nuts
 [[Scrat]], the [[saber-toothed squirrel]] (a fictional animal from the [[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age film series]]), while trying to find a place to hide his acorn, digs up a buried time machine over an ice-encased skeletal body of a human [[time travel]]er. The machine activates, stating the date that Scrat is in (May 26, One Million B.C.) While sniffing around the machine, he accidentally presses a button on it, and the machine powers up and then zaps the acorn. Scrat gets mad and tries to beat up the time machine, but it zaps him too, sending him to the [[Middle Ages]] in 1250 AD, where he finds the acorn wedged under a rock. Scrat sees [[Excalibur]], the sword in the stone, and decides to use it to move the rock and get back his acorn. He pulls out the sword but then finds himself under attack by a group of unseen [[Robin Hood]] archers, and uses the sword to block the arrows fired by the archers. He inadvertently frees the acorn in the process (and gets his tail wedged in the rock and having to yank it free) and takes it and the time machine and races off to find cover, only to hide in the barrel of a lit cannon. The cannon fires him into the path of hundreds of incoming arrows. The time machine zaps the acorn mid-flight and Scrat narrowly manages to activate the machine again for himself.  He materializes in the [[Coliseum]] during [[Ancient Rome]]. Scrat reaches for his acorn, but is dragged off when his tail is caught by a passing horse-drawn chariot. Scrat tries to pull his tail off, and begins to enjoy the ride (as he is "laughing" as the chariot pulls him) just as his [[crotch]] bashes against a rock. He then finds his acorn just as a fanfare sounds. He thinks it is victory music and introduces himself to the crowd like a triumphant [[gladiator]], proudly holding up his acorn. Then he hears the growl of a lion coming from the tunnel behind him. He fires the time machine again before the lion can attack him, and lands on an [[ice field]]. He is overjoyed, thinking he is home, but he soon sees the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] appear out of nowhere, heading straight towards him; he was actually in April 14, 1912 A.D. and on the frozen [[North Atlantic]], the time and location of the ship's sinking. Scrat gets pressed into the iceberg that sank the Titanic by the ship's bow, and the time machine zaps Scrat and the acorn as they fall from the iceberg, taking Scrat to the time of the first ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'' movie, where he encounters his past self, and the two Scrats fights each other for the acorn ([[Manny (Ice Age)|Manny]], [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]], [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]], and [[List of characters in the Ice Age films#Roshan|Roshan]] are watching the fight going on). The time machine is caught in the fight, and it zaps the acorn out of sight yet again, much to the distress of both past Scrat and future Scrat. Shortly after, future Scrat also gets zapped (after past Scrat angrily kicks the machine).  Scrat is then sent to many dangerous situations where he would have been killed had he not activated the time machine in time; under a launching rocket during the [[Space Race]], in a dark, modern-day [[jewelery]] store (he sets off the security alarms and lasers when he picks up a diamond he mistakes for his acorn), in a girl's locker room in the present (where he is hit by a roller brush), in the [[French Revolution]] (where he appears under the falling blade of a [[guillotine]]), during [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s kite flying [[experiment]] (and almost gets electrocuted), in front of a [[wrecking ball]] demolishing a modern-looking building, in front of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima bombing]] during [[World War II]], on the tracks of an oncoming train in the [[Wild West]], and in front of the groin of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (this doesn't threaten him, but he is rather embarrassed).  Frustrated, Scrat punches the machine, which sends him into a strange dimension (possibly a [[time travel|time vortex]]) of floating timepieces. Scrat spots his acorn but gets hit split into clones by a clock and grabs it just before being drawn into a [[wormhole]] along with his acorn and the time machine.  The wormhole lands Scrat in front of an enormous [[oak tree]]. Overjoyed at the sight of so many acorns, he tosses away his own acorn, which lands on and almost causes the time machine to fire again, but not before Scrat pulverizes it. Scrat attempts to remove the nuts from the tree, but soon discovers that it is only a monument of some sort, with a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] on it reading "Here Stood the Last Oak Tree". Scrat is in the distant future, where oak trees (and therefore acorns) are extinct. He realizes that the acorn he brought with him is the only real one around.  He makes a dash for it, but the time machine somehow fires one final time, transporting the acorn right out of his paws right before the time machine collapses into pieces. Stranded in the acorn-less future, Scrat lets out a scream of frustration, ending the film. The forever-lost acorn ends up floating behind the credits.

Noo Hin: The Movie
  Noo Hin is a young woman living in [[Ubon Ratchathani Province|Ubon Ratchathani]] in [[Isan|Northeast Thailand]], and as the story opens, she is hunting for something to eat, and she spots a [[lizard]] (an animated character), which she chases throughout the countryside, causing a stampede of [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] and disrupting a village fair.  Noo Hin, it seems, is a constant troublemaker in the village, which as is typical for [[Isan]] is poor, with few prospects for jobs or a productive [[paddy field|rice crop]]. Because Noo Hin is essentially useless, she must be sent to [[Bangkok]] to earn money in a factory.  Her departure at the [[State Railway of Thailand|railway]] station is a cause for celebration. Even the village band turns out to add to festivities.  As she rides on the train, Noo Hin imagines getting a job in a glamorous factory, making trendy bags, T-shirts and shoes. Her fantasy is acted out in a musical song-and-dance number. But at the employment agency, all that's left is a job in a [[rat]]-trap factory, which is horrifying to Noo Hin.  But as luck has it, an attractive, tall and large-breasted young woman strides into the agency looking for a new [[domestic worker|maid]], and Noo Hin gets the job.  The young woman's name is นม, which Noo Hin thinks is funny as it has the dual meaning for both Milk and Breasts.  Noo Hin has troubles adapting to the city right from the start. She has never used a seatbelt in a car before. She is given some insect spray to get rid of bugs in her room. Its odor is pleasing, so she sprays so much that she faints from the fumes.  She also can't understand why Milk and her older sister, Som-O ([[Pomelo]]), are so obsessed with their appearance. Som-O is especially concerned, and is constantly exercising, using a piece of equipment or a vibrating belt she hopes will melt away any fat that might be on her waistline. Noo Hin is further mystified by the behavior of urban women, who fight over items in sales bins at [[Siam Center]] and use whitening cream to make their underarms sparkle.  The house is bigger than the provincial government building back home, but the resourceful Noo Hin settles in, wearing dust-mops on her feet, a head-dress of feather dusters and twirling a broom as she whips things into shape during another song-and-dance number.  Noo Hin also has time for romance, meeting Tong, who she sees at the house next door, working in the garden. She strikes up a friendship with him and makes him her special [[som tam]]. She is disappointed to find out later, however, that he is actually the son of the home's owners, and not a gardener from Isan.  With the housework in order and the family happy, Noo Hin sets her sights on her next project – making Milk and Som-O famous. So Noo Hin secretly enters both the girls in a "super model" contest, an idea that Milk and Som-O are angry about at first, but their social-climbing mother soon warms up to it.  At the contest, the girls catch the eye of a French designer's assistant, much to the dismay of jealous [[supermodel]] Sonia. But the event is marred when Noo Hin catches a young man snapping [[mobile phone]] camera pictures of Milk in her dressing room. Noo Hin accuses the man, but he turns out to be the son of an influential member of society (a hi-so, in Thai slang), and the case is swept under the rug and Noo Hin forced to apologize.  Still, both Milk and Som-O are sought after by the French designer, and as the sisters are being driven to another modeling appointment, they are [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] and held in a [[love hotel]]. Noo Hin, meanwhile, is spirited away to a [[sweatshop]] factory where Isan women are forced to sew stuffed animals under the supervision of men in black to the beat of a DJ playing [[techno]].  Eventually, Noo Hin is able to charm one of the guards (who turns out to be an Isan native) and mount a rescue of the enslaved factory workers, while neighbor Tong tracks down Milk's and Som-O's whereabouts. They make it to the modelling engagement in time, only to be confronted by supermodel Sonia, who it turns out was the mastermind of the kidnapping. She is further exposed in front of the fashion designer, when it is revealed that she wears silicone [[falsies]].  Milk and Som-O are then chosen to be the lead models for a new line of clothes by the French designer, which it turn out, have been inspired by Noo Hin's indigenous wardrobe. They are to be flown to France for further assignments, and Noo Hin will go along with them, likely stirring up trouble wherever she goes.

They come from different family backgrounds—Sairah from a broken home, with her separated parents ([[Aishwarya (actress)|Aishwarya]] and [[Suresh Gopi]]), Sridevi, from a happy, close-knit family, with her parents ([[Sukanya (actress)|Sukanya]] and [[Prem Prakash]]) doting on her, and Pooja, a day scholar living near the school with her mother ([[Seetha (actress)|Seetha]]), whom the trio depend on, when they have problem between themselves. But on other issues, they believe in solving the problems by themselves. Sreedevi falls in love with a schoolmate, Sooraj Menon ([[Skanda Ashok]]). Though hesitant at first, Sairah and Pooja approve their love after being convinced of Sooraj's sincerity.  During an excursion to Goa, Sreedevi and Sooraj have sex, and eventually she becomes pregnant, much to the shock of Sairah and Pooja, and moreover herself. They keep the news to themselves, fearing the sorrow and wrath of Sreedevi's parents; even Sooraj is kept in the dark, for fear that the news may leak out. They decide to go for an abortion in a small hospital near their school. During the Founder's Day celebrations at the school, the trio sneaks out of the campus, and reaches the hospital. Pooja keeps watch outside the hospital while Sarah and Sreedevi go in and they convince the gynecologist for an abortion by telling several lies, including that Sreedevi had been raped. During abortion, Sreedevi suffers excessive blood loss and dies. Sairah and Pooja flee the hospital in terror and return to school.  They are summoned to the principal's office the next day, and the doctor who came to the school as a part of an enquiry identifies Sairah. Sairah confesses that the rape story was a lie and Sreedevi actually had sex with somebody she loves, but she maintains she doesn't know who that is. Pooja, who considers her future as important, distances herself from the whole episode, leaving Sairah embarrassed and angry. The principal, who is concerned about the status of the school presses for not registering a police case, dismisses Sairah from the school. Pooja, now ashamed of and disturbed by what she did, tries to apologise to Sairah, but meets with hostility. Pooja loses her mental stability, unable to take the pressure of having lost two best friends together—one to death and the other to her own betrayal.  Years later, on Sairah's graduation day, she receives a letter that claims to be from Sreedevi. The letter informs her that Pooja was in a mental asylum for 6 years, and she needs Sairah's company. Sairah, returning to Ooty, finds out that Pooja has been discharged from the mental hospital. They realise how much they missed each other and return to their school campus to a tree they had planted years ago.

Nuovomondo
 The first major segment of the film introduces the poor Mancuso family (headed by the widowed Salvatore, [[Vincenzo Amato]]), from [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], at the turn of the 20th century residing in a rural mountainous region, who decide to emigrate to the United States after receiving a sign from God in the form of American postcards depicting giant produce and chickens.Their dreams about the land of opportunity where giant vegetables are grown, people swim in milk, and coins fall from the sky propel their decision, which gives the viewer insight into the unrealistic expectations that many immigrants held about America. Salvatore takes his family consisting of his two sons as well as his old mother, Fortunata, who we learn is the village witch doctor and involved heavily in mystique ([[Aurora Quattrocchi]]). The dramatic scene that opens up the next segment of the film, the boat trip, visually depicts a sea of people being separated , those on the dock and those on the boat metaphorically representing the departure of the old and the new world respectively.  While aboard the ship to America, a red-headed British woman named Lucy ([[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]), who is traveling alone, stands out as both an attractive and elusive woman, catching the attention of the men for her beauty and the women for her classiness and independence. Salvatore is immediately smitten with this woman throughout the journey. Upon arrival at Ellis Island, Lucy asks Salvatore to marry her purely for administrative reasons, as being a woman she is unable to enter the United States alone. He agrees; he understands that she is not in love with him yet, but expects that will come with time. Their complex relationship highlights the troubling dynamic of the time, as women must still submit to male authority in the new world in order to even hope for the lesser freedom they so desire.   At Ellis Island, the final major segment of the film, the family join the rest of the immigrants on board to undergo extensive and humiliating physical and psychological examinations and questioning. The value of class that separated the immigrants on the ship becomes irrelevant in this final segment, as all of the immigrant's places in the new world are not guaranteed; they are all deemed equal. The ending of the movie reveals a surprising transfer of power between Pietro and Fortunata, as Pietro voices to Salvatore that his grandmother wishes to return home. After the tests are conducted, Salvatore is informed that Pietro ([[Filippo Pucillo]]) is about to be sent back for being [[Mute (disorder)|mute]], and Salvatore's mother for insufficient intelligence. The viewers are then left with the dilemma of whether Salvatore chooses to return home with his family or enter the United States.

Offside (2006 Iranian film)
 Most of the characters in the film are not named.  A girl disguises herself as a boy to go attend the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Third Round#Iran v Bahrain|qualifying match]] between [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and [[Bahrain national football team|Bahrain]]. She travels by bus with a group of male fans, some of whom notice her gender, but do not tell anyone. At the stadium, she persuades a reluctant ticket tout to sell her a ticket; he only agrees to do so at an inflated price. The girl tries to slip through security, but she is spotted and arrested. She is put in a holding pen on the stadium roof with several other women who have also been caught; the pen is frustratingly close to a window onto the match, but the women are at the wrong angle to see it.  The women are guarded by several soldiers, all of whom are just doing their [[national service]]; one in particular is an [[Iranian Azeri]] boy from [[Tabriz]] who just wants to return to his farm. The soldiers are bored and do not particularly care whether women should be allowed to attend football matches; however, they guard the women carefully for fear of their "chief", who could come by at any moment. They occasionally give commentary on the match to the women.  One of the younger girls needs to go to the toilet, but of course there is no women's toilet in the stadium. A soldier is deputed to escort her to the men's toilet, which he does by an increasingly farcical process: first disguising her face with a poster of a football star, then throwing a number of angry men out of the toilet and blockading any more from entering. During the chaos, the girl escapes into the stadium, although she returns to the holding pen shortly after as she is worried about the soldier from Tabriz getting into trouble.  Part of the way through the second half of the game, the women are bundled into a bus, along with a boy arrested for carrying [[firework]]s, and the soldiers ordered to drive them to the Vice Squad headquarters. As the bus travels through Tehran, the soldier from Tabriz plays the radio commentary on the match as it concludes. Iran defeats Bahrain 1-0 with a goal from [[Mohammad Nosrati]] just after half time and wild celebrations erupt within the bus as the women and the soldiers cheer and sing with joy. The girl whose story began the film is the only one not happy. When asked why, she explains that she is not really interested in football; she wanted to attend the match because a friend of hers was one of seven people killed in a scuffle during the recent Iran-[[Japan national football team|Japan]] match, and she wanted to see the match in his memory.  The city of Tehran explodes with festivity, and the bus becomes caught in a traffic jam as a spontaneous street party begins. Borrowing seven [[sparkler]]s from the boy with the fireworks, the women and the soldiers leave the bus and join the party, holding the sparklers above them.  The film was filmed at an actual stadium during a qualifying match for the Iranian National team. Panahi had two separate outcomes to the film depending on the turnout of the match.<ref>Bradshaw, Peter, "Offside", in "The Guardian", June 8, 2006.</ref>

Meanwhile, photographer Keith Jennings ([[David Thewlis]]) finds that several of his photographs contain mysterious [[omen]]s, including premonitions of people's deaths. A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock ([[Mia Farrow]]), is hired. Tension rises when Mrs. Baylock starts to make decisions without the consent of the Thorns, including adopting a [[Rottweiler]] for Damien's protection.  Following an incident near a chapel in which Damien attacks Katherine, she begins experiencing vivid dreams about her son, one of these involving a red-hooded [[jackal]] skeleton. When the Thorns visit a zoo, the animals react violently at the sight of Damien. Katherine begins to wonder if there is something wrong with Damien. Father Brennan confronts Robert, telling him that Damien's mother was a jackal, and that the boy is the [[Antichrist]]. He explains that Damien must die and a man called Bugenhagen ([[Michael Gambon]]), located in [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], can assist. After being rebuked, Father Brennan is killed during a lightning storm.  Katherine discovers she is pregnant and is determined to get an abortion, in fear of having a child similar to Damien. Soon afterward, Damien causes an accident in which Katherine is severely injured, resulting in her [[miscarriage]]. While recovering in the hospital, Katherine confides in Robert her suspicions that Damien is evil. Robert decides to rendezvous with Jennings and search for Damien's biological mother. The pair discovers the hospital where Damien was delivered has since been demolished after a fire. They travel to Subiaco and meet Father Spiletto, who directs them to a graveyard. There they find the grave of Damien's mother, who is revealed to indeed have been a jackal. In the neighboring tomb, Robert discovers the corpse of his murdered biological son. He and Jennings are attacked by a pack of dogs and barely escape.  Mrs. Baylock visits Katherine in the hospital and causes her to have an [[air embolism]], killing her. Learning of Katherine's death, Robert goes to Megiddo, meets Bugenhagen, and receives instructions on how to kill Damien on consecrated ground with seven sacrificial daggers. Bugenhagen tells Robert to examine Damien for a birthmark in the shape of [[Number of the Beast|three sixes ("666")]]. However, Robert refuses to kill his son, and throws the daggers on the ground. While reaching down to pick up the daggers, Jennings is suddenly decapitated by a falling sign.  Robert arrives home and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock's Rottweiler, which he subdues. In Damien's room, he finds the 666 birthmark. Mrs. Baylock attacks Robert, but he fends her off; after running her over with his car, he escapes with a silver [[Lexus GS]]. Pursued by the police, Robert flees to a church to kill Damien, but is killed before he can by a [[Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection|Diplomatic Protection]] officer.

Omkara (2006 film)
 Omkara Shukla or Omi ([[Ajay Devgn]]) is a ''bahubali'', a sort of political [[Criminal|enforcer]]. He is the leader of a gang which commits political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]). Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyaya ([[Vivek Oberoi]]) are his closest [[lieutenant]]s.  The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a ''[[baraat]]'' and challenging Rajju ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]), the [[bridegroom]], to try and stop Omkara from abducting the [[bride]], Dolly Mishra ([[Kareena Kapoor]]). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place.  Dolly’s father [[Advocate]] Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as ''vakeel saab'' (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omi’s head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed. The director here references one of the most significant lines of the play Othello, with Dolly's father repeating the couplet almost verbatim, albeit in translation. The original lines read, "Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father and may thee."  After some crafty political arm-twisting, involving an [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] [[sex scandal]], Omkara eliminates a powerful [[electoral]] rival. Bhaisaab is elected for [[Lok Sabha|parliament]] and Omkara is promoted from ''bahubali'' to the candidate for the upcoming [[Vidhan Sabha|state]] elections. Omkara appoints Kesu over Langda as his successor once he enters politics himself. Langda, disappointed with Omkara's poor judgment and jealous of Kesu, his younger, less-experienced, superior, hatches a plot to avenge both his offenders. He first causes a violent brawl between Kesu and Rajju by taking advantage of Kesu's low threshold for alcohol. Such irresponsible behaviour by Kesu infuriates Omi, who now starts having doubts over his decision.   On the one hand, playing the role of a concerned friend, Langda convinces Kesu to appeal to Dolly, Omi's lover and newly wedded wife, to mollify Omi. On the other hand, he starts to disrepute Dolly by implicating Kesu's visits to her as an illicit affair between the two. A ''kamarbandh'' carelessly dropped by Dolly and stolen by Langda’s wife Indu ([[Konkona Sen Sharma]]), which eventually reaches Billo Chamanbahar ([[Bipasha Basu]]) as a gift from Kesu, plays an important part in the plot, as evidence of Dolly’s [[infidelity]].  During the climax, on the night of their wedding, Omi is convinced that Dolly and Kesu have been having an affair behind his back. In rage, he smothers his new wife to death. Langda [[shooting|shoots]] Kesu with a silent approval from Omi. Kesu is hit with a bullet on his arm. Hearing gunshots and in shock, Indu enters the room where Omi is sitting next to Dolly’s [[corpse]] in remorse. Indu notices the ''kamarbandh'' and confesses to stealing it; they both understand the fatal misunderstanding with Langda as its root cause.  In retribution, Indu slashes Langda's throat and Omi commits suicide. The movie closes with Omi lying dead on the floor and Dolly’s dead body swinging above him, while Kesu looks on.

Emiri reveals to Jin-wo that PAM is a nickname for Asuka to denote her status in their class (a diminutive of "Spam"), exposing the current Asuka as her impostor. She also reveals that Asuka became the target of bullying due to standing up for Emiri, who was originally the one bullied first. With Jin-wo's advice, Emiri apologizes to Asuka, awaking the real Asuka.

One Night with the King
 The movie is set in [[Susa]], [[Persia]] (modern-day [[Iran]]). [[Xerxes I|King Xerxes]] holds a great feast for all the people to attend. Hadassah (the main protagonist) longs to go to [[Jerusalem]] to see the Holy Land and prepares to leave with the caravan along with her friend, Jesse. They stop by the King's feast before he goes marching to war to avenge his [[Darius I#Death|father’s death]]. Hadassah and Jesse witness the King summoning [[Queen Vashti]]. Queen Vashti was opposed to the war, desiring King Xerxes to enhance his kingdom instead. She holds her own feast in protest to the war. When the king summons her to his own feast, she refuses to come stating, "I am queen, and I will not lower my dignity. Or shame my crown by wearing it before your drunk, and thinly veiled war council". Because of this, King Xerxes is advised to banish her and select a more worthy queen.  All beautiful virgin women in the stronghold of Susa are brought in so Xerxes could leave behind a queen to keep the kingdom unified. Under the command of her foster-father, "Uncle Mordecai" (who was one of the king’s scribes and worked in the palace), Hadassah does not reveal her nationality or family and changes her name to "Esther" (after the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] goddess [[Ishtar]]). She is taken in with the rest of the selected women and given cosmetics, perfumes, and treatments under the care of [[Hegai]], the king’s royal eunuch. Through her quick wit, intelligence, and integrity, she becomes Hegai's favorite contestant.  On their night with the king, each contestant is allowed to bring along whatever she wishes from the harem. She goes in the evening and returns in the morning to a second harem to another royal eunuch who is custodian to the concubines. She will not be able to return to the king unless she pleases him and he summons her by name. During their preparation, Hegai discovers Esther can read and listens to her reading to the other contestants. He admires her bravery. Late into the night, he brings her to King Xerxes to read to him. She starts reading from the assigned scroll and then begins telling the love story of [[Jacob]] and [[Rachel]] (from the Old Testament). He is amused and intrigued and dismisses her, saying she would read to him again. From this interaction, Esther falls in love with the King. When it is Esther's turn for her 'one night with the king', she only wears what Hegai advises. She wins the king's favor by revealing her heart to him. He chooses her and crowns her queen.  Simultaneously, Haman the Agagite is promoted to the highest-ranking official. He has all the king’s servants at the royal gate to kneel before him. Mordecai refuses, declaring he will only kneel before God and the king. He announces himself before Haman to be a son of Abraham, a Jew. Haman, filled with vengeance and hatred, seeks to destroy Mordecai and all his people because centuries earlier, Jews persecuted his forefathers.  Esther discovers the plot and breaks protocol by going before the king unsummoned, risking her life to plead for her people. The king lowers his scepter to her and spares her life out of his love for her. She invites the king and Haman to a banquet and there reveals her nationality and Haman’s plot to kill the Jews. The king, overwhelmed by her revelation, leaves the banquet. Haman then assaults Esther. The king saves her and, in his fury, commands Haman be hanged on the gallows he had erected to hang Mordecai for revenge. After Haman is taken away, the king goes to Esther's side. Esther asks, "What made you come back"? And the king responds with, "I saw the stars". Then King Xerxes kisses Esther, with the camera pulling away from the small temple.  The ending shows Mordecai being made a Prince of Persia, and issuing a royal decree in his own name, with flashbacks of Esther being made Queen, and the crowd of Jews cheering in the streets. The last scenes show the small temple and Mordecai saying, "Thus dictated, I order this decree sent out under the great seal of Mordecai, Prince of Persia, a Jew".

One Night with the King (2006)
  The story of Queen Esther composes one of the books of the Bible serving as the basis for many Christian foundations that have passed from generation to generation and that gave rise to the sacred Jewish feast of the Purin. Likewise, this is one mythical history that is considered sacred in the term of doctrine for Christians and Jews. The life of the young Hadassah was based on her worship of God and the fulfillment of her doctrines, the bases of  her salvation. Hadassah was educated by her uncle Mordecai about what was right or wrong based on the divine mandates according to the will of God. Born in poverty, Hadassah grows to become a beautiful young woman who catches the attention of powerful King Xerxes, to finally become his wife. A new name was given to Hadassah because of her origin, acquiring the new identity as Esther of Susa. The king chose Esther to be his wife without knowing that she was a Jew, initiating his sudden love in the sacred biblical story of Jacob and Rachel. Simultaneously, Haman the Agagite was promoted to a high official rank, remaining as a substitute for the king when he went to war. Haman's intentions were to kill all the Jews when the king left and execute Mordecai the Jew. The life of Hadasshawas in danger, since it has been decreed by Haman that all people of Jewish origin should be killed. Defying warnings to remain silent, the young queen, known as Esther of Susa, tried to save her people, having to hide her origin and keeping her faith and prayers to God. The queen Esther put her faith in God and breaking all the royal laws asked for one last night with the king. In Persian customs the king was not to be interrupted at one of his banquets if the person did not present a prior invitation. This ritual was sacred and had to be carried out with the death penalty for its violation. This was the time when the young queen experienced the power of God through her faith, who through her doctrines had promised that a purpose had been given to her life and would be fulfilled according to her will. Queen Esther of Susa saved the Jewish people from an unjust death and showed her uncle Mordecai how faithful God had been. The Queen gave him the opportunity to become a prince and serve the God of Israel through the teaching of Jewish religion. The naming of Mordecai as prince had a strong impact in the social community of Jews becoming a leader and creating sacred material that has been present in the Jewish society until today.

Only the Brave (2006 film)
 In 1953, Jimmy Takata (Nishikawa) suffers from "battle fatigue" ([[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]]), to the great concern of his wife, Mary (Tomita). Raised in [[Hawaii]], Takata and some of his friends enlisted in the 100th Battalion, serving in the [[European Theater of Operations]]. In a series of flashbacks, he remembers the war and events in his life surrounding it. Following a head injury, he begins to have visions, and believes that he is seeing memories of other men, including his friend Freddy Watada (Watanabe) as he courted Mary (who would later be Jimmy's wife) before entering the Army. Freddy receives a "million-dollar wound" (one which is serious enough to require evacuation to the United States, but not permanently disabling), and he shows Takata an engagement ring, purchased before being sent to Europe, which he intends to give Mary upon his return.  Takata's concern about the visions is dismissed as disorientation caused by the head wound by "Doc" Naganuma, the unit medic, a [[Medical Doctor]] who had likewise joined to help his friends. Takata also has a vision of his father, a [[Buddhist]] priest in Federal custody, and who tells him "You must accept your fate, here"—pointing to his head -- "the rest of you will follow, here," pointing to Takata's heart. Takata later learns that his father has died, 49 days earlier. Buddhists believe that a spirit will enter Heaven or be reborn 49 days after death.  When his unit is ordered to break through German lines and rescue the [[141st Infantry Regiment]], Takata is ordered by the doctor to stay in the rear area, due to his head wound. However, as the casualties mount, he defies orders and attempts to find a way through to the trapped men. He is joined by several of his men (including Freddy), who are also unwilling to wait in the rear as their friends face the danger. Asked by a newly transferred soldier if he's ever afraid, Takata confides that his fear is of losing more men.  Joining the rest of the Nisei, Takata and his men fight the Germans, as one-by-one Takata watches his men—nearly all of his friends—being killed in battle. Freddy throws his body on a grenade which had been thrown at Takata, and the men look into each other's eyes as it explodes.  The battle won, Takata accepts the thanks of the lieutenant commanding the rescued unit, and notes that 211 of the 275 had been saved, at a cost of over 800 casualties.  His thoughts return to 1953, where Mary's love and tears finally break through, and he is able to shed his own tears. A vision comes of his lost men and father, standing in the field hospital, and his father repeats his earlier encouraging statement.  Now Takata's vision comes of meeting with Mary after the war, and meeting Mary and Freddy's young daughter, Joanie. Joanie touches the scar on his temple, and as she smiles and looks into his eyes, he is reminded of a refugee girl that he had rescued in the battle which had resulted in the head wound. Takata gives Mary the engagement ring, and explains that, since Freddy had given his life to save Takata's, the least he could do is to bring it home for her. He comforts her as she cries.  As that vision fades, we see Jimmy placing the keepsakes from each of his friends in a suitcase and closing it. Mary, sitting behind the wheel of a car, looks up and asks (hoping beyond hope) if he is okay. He looks at her, is able to smile, and says that he is.

Origin: Spirits of the Past
 [[Genetic engineering]] on trees was conducted at a research facility on the [[Moon]] to produce trees capable of growing in harsh, arid conditions. The trees gain consciousness, obliterating Earth's civilizations and destroying the Moon. Three hundred years later, Japan is a [[dystopia]] covered by the Forest, a huge expanse of sapient trees, and ruled by the tree-like [[Dryad|Druids]], which inhabit the planet and control the water supply of both trees and humans. Agito, a young boy, and his father Agashi, as well as his friends Cain and Minka, live in Neutral City, a city carved out of the ruined skyscrapers which acts as both a buffer and a bridge between the Forest and the [[militaristic]] nation of Ragna. While the people of Neutral City co-exist peacefully with the trees of the forest, the nation of Ragna aims to destroy the Forest to restore the Earth.  One day, Agito and Cain race each other to see who can get to the water hole at the bottom of the city first. By disturbing the sanctity of the water hole and angering the Druids, the two boys are separated. After stumbling upon a large machine with cryogenic pods, Agito accidentally revives Toola, a young girl who has been asleep for the past 300 years, and brings her to Neutral City. The Forest is angered by Toola's awakening, since she carries a Raban—a portable personal electronic device, worn as a necklace, that can be used for communication and a variety of other tasks. The Forest fears that she will fall into the hands of Shunack, a soldier of Ragna and also a person from the past who was awakened from sleep, and that he will use her Raban to locate E.S.T.O.C., an "environmental defragmentation system" with the ability to wipe out the Forest and restore human control over the world.  Shunack finds out about Toola and arrives into Neutral City with his army to persuade her to join him. The Forest sends a giant creature to stop the meeting, but Shunack destroys it and reveals that he has been "enhanced"—he allowed himself to be genetically altered by the Forest to become stronger by using the power of the trees. Convinced that finding E.S.T.O.C. is the only way to restore the Earth back to the world which she once knew, Toola joins Shunack in his quest despite Agito's plea not to go. Agito consults his father Agashi, the founder of Neutral City who, as a result of being enhanced and having overused his powers, has turned almost completely into a tree. With few days left before becoming a tree completely, Agashi encourages his son to save the Forest from Shunack's plan, since destroying the trees would mean the destruction of mankind. Agito journeys to the Forest and allows himself to be enhanced, his hair turning silver as a result.  Agito follows Shunack and Toola to E.S.T.O.C., a giant volcano converted into a mechanized weapon. E.S.T.O.C. was created by Toola's father Dr. Sakul, the doctor who had begun the genetic research on the trees, as a safeguard against the new species. Betraying the Ragna army and focusing his attention on E.S.T.O.C., Shunack reveals that he worked on the original genetic alteration experiments on the trees. However, his impatience to speed up the alteration process resulted in the catastrophic invasion of the mutant trees. Shunack intends to activate E.S.T.O.C. to return the world to the way it used to be and so right the damage he had caused and the guilt that has plagued him ever since. However this will destroy the world that has formed in the old one's place. Shunack plans on activating E.S.T.O.C. near Neutral City, thus obliterating it. When Toola realises this, she fights Shunack to prevent him from activating E.S.T.O.C. As the Ragna army commences their assault on E.S.T.O.C., Agito faces Shunack. Agito transforms into a tree in a desperate attempt to save Toola, trapping Shunack within it. Toola shuts down E.S.T.O.C. and the weapon's self-destruct sequence is initiated. Having developed strong feelings for Agito, Toola is unable to leave without him.  Meanwhile, Agito's consciousness remains intact on another plane, and there the Forest reveals to him the truth about the relationship between itself and the humans. Agito learns that the genetic admixture that gives humans extraordinary strength and eventually turns them into trees is really a two-way exchange; it also changes the Forest, causing trees to give birth to new humans in giant fruits. Having become one with the Forest, Shunack is now at peace and no longer intends to fight Agito. Realizing that Agito can teach humanity that there is no need for either hostility or separation between themselves and the trees, the Forest returns Agito to his true form, allowing him and Toola to flee before E.S.T.O.C. is destroyed. With the humans and the Forest saved, Agito brings peace between humans and the trees. Toola finally lets go of her past by throwing her Raban off a ledge down into the depths of the Forest, learning to live in harmony with the trees at last.  
Opal Dream
 [[Image:Opaldream01.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Kellyanne ([[Sapphire Boyce]]) is led by her brother Ashmol ([[Christian Byers]]).]]The film begins by introducing Kellyanne Williamson, playing with imaginary friends Pobby and Dingan. The family of Rex Williamson—his wife, Anne, daughter Kellyanne and son Ashmol—have moved to [[Coober Pedy]], known as the "opal capital of Australia", because Rex believed he could make a fortune in mining [[opal]]. So far he's had little success. Ashmol, while he loves his sister, is frequently annoyed when she talks to her imaginary friends, and some of the kids at school tease the siblings because of them.  Rex and Anne decide it is time to separate Kellyanne from her invisible companions. Annie takes Kellyanne to a Christmas party at Annie's friend's house, Rex telling her that he will let Pobby and Dingan come with him to go opal mining. Upon Rex's return, Kellyanne says she can no longer see them and that they have disappeared. She insists on going to the opal mining area to look for them, accompanied by Rex and Ashmol. The family accidentally strays on to a neighbouring miner's [[Mining claim|claim]]. The miner, Sid, pulls a shotgun on Rex and calls the police, thinking that Rex was "ratting" on his territory - that is, [[Land claim|looking]] for opals on his turf.  Kellyanne is grief-stricken at the loss of her imaginary friends and takes ill, although doctors can find nothing physically wrong with her. Rex has to leave his opal claim. Annie loses her job at the local supermarket, thanks to the circulating rumours around Rex's arrest. Convinced that Kellyanne is faking her illness, Ashmol nonetheless goes along with her wish that he try to find Pobby and Dingan. He even comes up with the idea of putting posters around town. Ultimately, returning to his father's mine area, Ashmol finds two lollipop wrappers. Deeper in the tunnel, he finds a large opal which he takes back to Kellyanne. He tells her he has found Pobby and Dingan, and that they are dead.  Kellyanne, whose sickness has been worsening, has to go to hospital. Ashmol sells his opal and pays for a funeral for Pobby and Dingan. He has made friends with a lawyer, who takes Rex's case. Rex wins the trial.  Many people in town begin to feel that their attitude toward Kellyanne and her family may have contributed to her sickness. These people show up at Pobby and Dingan's funeral.  Kellyanne, though still sick, is there, and throws lollipops into her imaginary friends' graves. A short time later, Kellyanne herself dies, and is buried between her imaginary friends. Ashmol visits her grave. Rex gets his claim back, and Ashmol is allowed to accompany him on mining trips.  ===Ending=== In the original release of the film, the death of Kellyanne was not shown; after Pobby and Dingan's funeral, the screen fades to white, and the film ends. This cut was made against the wishes of the director and crew but did air uncut and as originally intended when shown on [[BBC Two]] in 2008.  
Open Season (2006 film)
 In the peaceful town of Timberline, 900-pound (408&nbsp;kg) [[grizzly bear]] Boog enjoys a captive, but pampered existence and spends his day as the star attraction of the town's nature show while at night living in the [[Garage (house)|garage]] of [[park ranger]] Beth, who has raised him since he was a cub. One day, the sadistic hunting fanatic Shaw drives into town with a one-antlered deer strapped to the hood of his truck. After Boog frees him, the deer follows Boog home to find him sleeping in the garage. To wake Boog up, the deer throws rabbits at the window and introduces himself as Elliot. He tells him to be "free" from his garage captivity and introduces Boog to a world of sweet temptations he has never known.  When Boog becomes sick from eating too many candy bars, events quickly spiral out of control as the two raid the town's grocery store. Elliot escapes before Boog is caught by a friend of Beth, police officer Gordy. At the nature show, Elliot being chased by Shaw, sees Boog, who "attacks" him. This causes the whole audience to panic. Shaw attempts to shoot Boog and Elliot, but Beth sedates them both with a [[tranquilizer gun]] just before Shaw fires his gun. Shaw flees before Gordy can arrest him for shooting a gun in the town. The two trouble makers are banned from the town and into the Timberline [[United States National Forest|National Forest]], only three days before open season starts, but they are relocated above the waterfalls, where they will be safe from the hunters.  Since he lacks any outdoor survival skills, Boog reluctantly takes Elliot as his accident-prone guide to get him back home to Timberline to reunite with Beth. But in the woods, they quickly learn that it is every animal for itself. The two run into their share of forest animals, which they think they are pests. The only forest animals they befriend are skunks, Maria and Rosie, ducks, Serge and Deni, various unnamed panic-stricken rabbits, the [[Scotland|Scottish]]-accented squirrel, McSquizzy, along with his roguish gang, Reilly, a beaver and his construction worker team, a porcupine named Buddy who is in search of a friend and the herd of deer led by Ian and his assistant, Giselle (who Elliot is in love with).  With each adverse encounter, Boog learns a little about self-reliance and Elliot gains self-respect and they start to become friends. The next day, Elliot attempts to lead Boog out of the forest, but it becomes evident that he has no clue where they are going. After causing a flood at Reilly's dam, Boog and Elliot are confronted by Shaw; Boog then loses his toy bear, Dinkleman, as the [[current (stream)|current]] makes the doll float out of Boog's paw. They end up in a waterfall, which floods and sends the forest animals falling down it.  At first, everyone blames Boog, who accuses Elliot of lying to him about leading him home. Elliot admits he thought that if Boog spent time with him, he would befriend him. Boog leaves to unwittingly find Shaw's log cabin. Shaw returns and talks to his [[gun]] "Loraine" and says he would take back what is his, discovers him (like [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]), and pursues him to the city road where Boog happens upon the glowing lights of Timberline. Instead of deserting his companions, Boog helps the other animals defend themselves using supplies taken from an RV owned by two people looking for [[Bigfoot]] named Bob and Bobbie's [[RV]] while their pet dachshund Mr. Weenie joins "the wilds".  The next day, Boog leads a revolution against the hunters, sending them running after McSquizzy blows up their trucks with a propane tank named "Mr. Happy" ignited by using an emergency flare. Shaw returns for a final confrontation and shoots Elliot in the process, which enrages Boog and leads him to tie up Shaw with his own gun. Boog rushes over to Elliot's body but soon finds that Elliot survived the shot, only losing his second antler in the fracas. The other animals thank Boog for his help and then proceed to take out their vengeance on Shaw by smothering him with honey and pillow feathers. Shaw flees from Beth who returns to take Boog back home where he will be safe, but he decides to stay with his friends, all of the animals in the forest. During an epilogue, Elliot and Boog became best friends, Giselle becomes Elliot's girlfriend, Mr. Weenie is McSquizzy's mode of transportation, Buddy uses lots of his friends as the friend he used to find, and Beth returns and says goodbye to Boog, ending the movie  
Open Water 2: Adrift
 A group of friends, Amy ([[Susan May Pratt]]), James ([[Richard Speight, Jr.]]), Zach (Niklaus Lange), Lauren ([[Ali Hillis]]), Dan ([[Eric Dane]]), and Dan's new girlfriend Michelle ([[Cameron Richardson]]) go for a weekend cruise on Dan's new yacht. Amy and James also bring their infant daughter, Sarah.  Most of the friends decide to jump into the water for a swim. Amy, who is hydrophobic after a childhood incident, refuses but Dan picks her up and dives in with her. However, nobody thought to lower the ladder to re-board the ship, and so everyone (except the baby) is trapped in the water with only two masks, a dive knife, and a toy dolphin float. Despite their efforts, the side of the yacht is too smooth to climb and the deck is too high to reach. They see a boat of teenagers heading towards them. The group try to grab their attention, but the teenagers think that they are just greeting them, and sail off. During the struggle, the group try using a phone to call for help, only to hear the voices of some well wishers, unable to get the caller's attention. The phone accidentally gets knocked in the water.  They are left to tread water disconsolately. The group resorts to removing and using their bathing suits to make a rope. After a couple of attempts they manage to get one end of the rope wrapped around a railing. Instead of having the lightest person climb up, Zach attempts to climb. He pulls himself up and his fingers brush the [[gunwale]] but the makeshift rope rips apart as he is too heavy. The group are now mostly naked and have only a partial rope.  Meanwhile, James goes underwater, and is fooling around with the prop, in an attempt to remove it and use it as a grappling hook, but he drops the knife. He swims down after it and manages to catch it, and desperately tries to swim for the surface. As he swims back up he crashes into the bottom of the boat, and is knocked unconscious. He resurfaces motionlessly and slightly bloodied with an apparent [[skull fracture]]. Zach gets the knife from James and starts stabbing the boat to climb back up. Dan tries to stop Zach, but accidentally stabs him, causing Zach to drop the knife.  In a fit of hysteria and fearing that sharks will be attracted by the blood, Michelle begins to swim away, but sinks underwater. Dan swims after her and sees her lifeless body drifting underwater. He dives after her, but he can't reach her, and her body disappears into the depths. After some time, Zach dies from blood loss in Lauren's arms. She reluctantly lets go of his body which floats away, face down. After much waiting, Lauren says she refuses to die treading water and attempts to swim back to shore to find help. Her fate after this is unknown.  Later that night, during a rainstorm, James dies from his head injury. Dan unsuccessfully searches underwater for the knife. He slams his mask on the hull in frustration and the [[Lens (optics)|lens]] pops out. Remembering Zach's attempt with the knife, Dan uses it to wedge in the crevice of the side door for the ladder, giving him a handhold. Amy climbs over his shoulders, finally stepping onto his hand wrapped around the lens,causing him to yell as his hand bleeds more and manages to grab the gunwale and pull herself back on board. Once on board, she lowers the ladder for Dan and tends to her baby, Sarah. Amy notices Dan swimming away to drown out of guilt. She jumps back in to save him, reminding her when she attempted to save her father in the same manner, at a young age.  The next morning, a fishing boat approaches the yacht, and notices the lowered ladder and life ring still floating in the water - no one had pulled them in. The yacht appears empty except for the sound of Sarah crying on the lower deck.  The film cuts to Amy standing on the boat in the sun, looking around appearing heartbroken. Dan is shown lying face down on the boat with a towel covering his lower half, seemingly sleeping.

Out of the Blue (2006 film)
 Aramoana, Tuesday 13 November 1990. [[David Gray (Aramoana massacre)|David Gray]], an unemployed man in his 30s who lives in his parent’s small holiday home, cycles into town where he has an argument with staff at a bank over a minor issue. Unstable & angry, he returns home where he has a cache of fire-arms, including a semi-automatic rifle.  Late in the afternoon, he notices children from a neighbouring house have wandered onto his yard and he angrily abuses them, sparking a heated verbal exchange with their father, Garry Holden. Gray goes inside his house and then quickly re-emerges armed with the SAR, shooting Holden dead.  Holden’s two young daughters, Chiquita and Jasmine, and his girlfriend Julie-Anne’s adopted daughter Rewa, witness the murder and flee inside Holden's house, attempting to hide. Gray enters and soon locates them.  Chiquita is then seen fleeing, having been wounded, trying to get help for Jasmine and Rewa (whose deaths occur off-screen). She reaches Julie-Anne and they both get into her van and drive towards the scene, trying to rescue the other girls, only to find Holden’s house has been set on fire. Julie-Anne is then forced to drive to safety as Gray fires at her vehicle.  Nearby residents hear the shooting and see the smoke, not yet comprehending what is happening. Gray enters a nearby house and shoots dead both elderly male occupants (their deaths occur off-screen). A utility with six people on board, including three children, drives up from the nearby beach, stopping near the burning house. Gray emerges and opens fire. The subsequent shootings are not shown, only the noise and the look of horror on the face of a nearby witness.  Elderly widow Eva Dickson, who recently has had hip surgery, ventures out with her walking frame to see what is happening and she is joined by a neighbour Chris Cole. Earlier, Dickson’s middle-aged son James had left the house, looking for his dog. An unseen Gray opens fire, hitting Cole and narrowly missing Dickson. Having collapsed and unable to stand up again, Dickson crawls inside her house to ring the police and then goes back to Cole, lying badly wounded but still conscious, to tell him that help is coming (Cole later succumbs to his injuries).   It is now getting dark and the Holden house is engulfed in flames. The first police to arrive are Sgt [[Stewart Graeme Guthrie|Stewart Guthrie]], Constable Nick Harvey and Detective Paul Knox. They arrive at Gray's and Holden’s houses, seeing the carnage around the utility. The police attempt to surround Gray’s house but the gunman surprises Guthrie from behind, shooting him dead. Harvey, armed with a rifle, briefly has Gray in his sights but hesitates, missing his chance.  Knox reaches the utility, discovering one of the occupants still alive- 3-year-old Stacey Percy, who has been wounded in the abdomen but is still conscious. Knox and Harvey enter Gray’s house but find it empty. They get into a car, Harvey nursing Stacey, trying to keep her conscious and Knox holding the bodies of the other two children from the utility, and drive to where a police cordon is being established, handing Stacey over to paramedics. Harvey is physically ill as he reacts to the fear and trauma.  Eva Dickson stays in her kitchen, keeping in touch with police by phone. Her dog comes back, stained with the blood of her son James (whose death has occurred off-screen). The police seal off the town, residents spending a fearful night in their homes with the gunman still at large. Gray enters a [[Bach (New Zealand)|crib]] and, finding it deserted, spends the night there.  The next day, police have arrived en masse and are combing the town, searching for Gray. [[Armed Offenders Squad]] (AOS) officers locate the crib and surround the small house. After a brief exchange of gunfire, the officers throw tear-gas canisters into the house. Gray abruptly emerges, screaming obscenities and firing wildly from the hip. The waiting officers open fire and hit Gray several times, the gunman collapsing. With difficulty, the AOS men restrain him and then wait nearby as Gray dies of his wounds.  A postscript follows, consisting of a montage of scenes, including the full squad of AOS officers escorting Eva Dickson from her home as a mark of respect for her bravery, Chiquita Holden and Stacey Percy in hospital, both recovering from their wounds, the deliberate torching of Gray’s house that occurred several days after the massacre and a list of names of the 13 people who died on 13 November.  
OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies
 The main plot starts with the disappearances of an [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] agent, Jack Jefferson, and a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] cargo ship in Cairo. Agent OSS 117 is sent to investigate the events, since he and agent Jefferson share a history, shown in a short opening sequence and in flashbacks throughout the film. OSS 117 stumbles into a web of international intrigue, that involves the French, the Soviets, the British, separate factions of Egyptians, a goofy [[Belgium|Belgian]] spy and even a splinter group of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] from the beginning.  Throughout the film the main character has two main romantic interests. The first is an Egyptian princess Al Tarouk, who can't resist the charms of OSS 117. The second is the former assistant of Jack Jefferson, Larmina El Akmar Betouche, who at first shows no interest in the main character - and in fact temporarily becomes a secondary villain due to OSS 117's continued crass statements about her religion - but warms up to him in the end. {{Quote|text= ''Hubert has woken up, having beaten up the [[muezzin]] during the night as he couldn't sleep with the noise.'' Hubert: By the way, I was woken by a guy screaming on a tower. I couldn't sleep... I had to shut him up.  Larmina: A muezzin? You shut up a muezzin?  Hubert: The...?  Larmina: ...Muezzin. He was calling for prayer.  Hubert: Oh, I didn't know. That's what the ruckus was. The screaming, the mike... Yours is a very strange religion. You'll grow tired of it. }} {{Quote|text= ''At a [[Suez Canal]] panoramic view point''  Hubert: It's breathtaking. I love panoramic views. This one is stunning. Your civilization truly is grandiose! To build this 4000 years ago was visionary.  Larmina: The Suez Canal was built 86 years ago. }}  
The Other Side (2006 film)
 Samuel North has returned from college to reunite with his girlfriend Hanna Thompson. On the night he is to have a romantic dinner with her on the banks of a river she does not show up, and he is run into the river by a large white van. His soul goes to Hell, aka "The Pit," where he is tormented by the worst memories of his life, including being bullied, finding his parents murdered, and the regretful taxi ride to college, which took him from Hanna. However, he experiences only a moment of torment before being rescued by other souls who have found a way out. He escapes and wakes up along with the other escapees in a hospital, where he learns that Hanna did not return home the previous night, and he is a suspect for her disappearance. Before he can find out any more, three bounty hunters dispatched from hell to retrieve them appear. Only Sam and two others escape. The duo, Mally and Oz, have both escaped numerous times only to be caught and brought back. They explain that two of the three bounty hunters are "Switchers," who can switch from dead body to body when their host body is killed. However their leader, a "Changer," does not need to change unless into its native demonic form. They escape to a motel filled with escapees, all scarred by the Mark of the Damned, which is how the Reapers track them.  Mally and Oz originally plan to escape to Mexico; however, Sam is determined to find Hanna. Mally wants to flee to Mexico, but Oz decides to help Sam find Hanna, believing that helping him may be their ticket to Redemption and out of The Pit for good. Mally relents and the trio go to the bar where Hanna worked. Sam discovers that Hanna was being sexually harassed by a regular named Isaac, and that one of Hanna's friends had told Isaac that Hanna was reporting him to the police. The friend further explains that Isaac followed Hanna out to her car and didn't return home that night.   The trio find Hanna's car in the woods near the river and a dead body next to it. Sam's police friend, Peter, informs him the dead body was John Rice, who drove a white van. However, he was pulled over and stabbed to death and his white van was hijacked. Later that night, while picking up a few items from his brother, David,  Sam is shot at by a man in the white van and his brother is injured. After dropping David off at the Emergency Room he breaks into Isaac's house and interrogates him, only to receive a truthful answer that Isaac left Hanna alone.  Sam returns to the motel just before it is attacked by the Reapers. Although many escapees are killed and sent back to The Pit, they succeed in sending one Switcher back to Hell. Mally and Oz, tired of fighting, decide to leave for Mexico. But before they can leave Sam reveals the sin for which he went to Hell: murder. Despite this, Oz and Mally leave Sam alone to fight the Reapers. Later on Sam is attacked by the Reapers, but manages to send another Switcher back to Hell. Meanwhile, Hanna's body is found in a river, and the search is called off.  David, meanwhile, is let out of the hospital, and Peter offers to drive him home. On the way he sees the white van and finds the driver has entered a motel. Before he can call in backup, David shoots and kills him and confronts the man in the white van. It is revealed that David hired the man to kill Hanna and Sam. He berates him for being careless and not burying the body and ditching the van. The man forces David to arrange a meeting at the Church between him and Sam. They meet, and it is revealed the man is William Cain, the man who murdered Sam's parents and who Sam—in revenge—killed as he was trying to escape. William also escaped from Hell and offered to kill Sam and Hanna so that David could claim the inheritance, because their parent's will left everything to Sam, and Sam's will left everything to Hanna. Before Will can kill Sam, the final Reaper—the Changer—arrives and attacks both of them and kills William, but not before he tells Sam that David hired him to kill him. Now in its natural form the Changer nearly kills Sam before being killed by Mally and Oz, who have returned. Oz confesses that Sam didn't escape by accident and was in fact broken out by Oz, who is a Guardian Angel. He offers to take Sam down to Mexico, but Sam stays to confront his brother. David admits not only to having Will kill Sam and Hanna but also having their parents murdered by Will because he was jealous of both his parents' treatment of Sam as well as the inheritance money. Following their argument, Sam is shot by David. In a brief struggle Sam gains the upper hand and spares his brother, only to be shot in the back as he is leaving. As the police arrive to arrest David, Sam has the opportunity to fire back at David; however, he instead spends his final moments staring at a picture of him and Hanna happily together. For this act Sam gains redemption for his previous sin. After he dies, he awakens in heaven with Hanna, where they spend the rest of eternity happily ever after.

RJ accidentally wakes Vincent from his [[hibernation]], and in a race to escape, causes the stash to roll out onto the nearby highway and get run over by a large truck. To avoid being eaten himself, RJ promises Vincent that he will completely replace the stash within the week.  RJ heads towards a recently built suburban [[housing development]] in [[Chesterton, Indiana]], separated from a forest glade by a large hedge. There he discovers a pack of animals recently awoken from their hibernation, led by Verne the turtle; the others include squirrel Hammy, skunk Stella, porcupines Penny and Lou, along with their triplet sons, Spike, Bucky and Quillo; and opossum Ozzie and his daughter Heather. The animals are scared, as the development had been built during their hibernation and they fear they will be unable to forage for food in the small glade. RJ shows them the amount of food humans consume and waste and suggests they forage from the humans. Verne is hesitant but the other animals acquiesce. They make bold attempts to steal food directly from the humans, with RJ secretly guiding them to help collect the food he needs to replace Vincent's stash.  When the animals raid the trash cans of the [[Homeowner association|homeowners-association]] chairwoman Gladys Sharp, she calls an animal exterminator named Dwayne LaFontant, who offers to install in her backyard an illegal, lethal trap called the "Depelter Turbo". Verne sees this and tries to warn the others, but RJ insists they will be okay. Fearing for the safety of the pack, Verne attempts to return what they stole; he and RJ argue, causing a small rampage through the development and destroying the stash RJ had collected for Vincent. After a brief argument, RJ and Verne make up and RJ rallies the others to raid Gladys' home directly on the night before a large party.

RJ inadvertently reveals his duplicity to the animals, just as they are discovered by Gladys who calls Dwayne. RJ escapes with the food for Vincent but leaves the other animals to be captured by Dwayne.  As RJ returns the food to Vincent, he sees Dwayne's truck drive by and, consumed by remorse, uses the food to knock the truck off the road, enraging Vincent. Dwayne is knocked out while the animals get free, and Spike, Bucky and Quillo use skills they learned from a videogame to drive the truck back to the development. RJ pleads to be let in the truck as Vincent tries to catch him, but the others, angry at his treachery, refuse. Verne convinces the group to forgive RJ since he came back to save them. They return the truck to the development, crashing through Gladys' home, and the animals flee into the hedge. Gladys and Dwayne converge on the animals from one side with a [[String trimmer]] and a [[Cattle prod]] respectively, while Vincent tries to swipe at them from the other. To escape, RJ gives Hammy a [[Energy drink|caffeinated beverage]], allowing the hyperactive squirrel to move incredibly fast. Hammy is able to manipulate Dwayne into capturing Vincent, causing Vincent, Gladys, and Dwayne to be trapped by the Depelter Turbo while the animals escape. The police and animal control arrive, and Vincent is sent to the [[Rocky Mountains]] while Gladys is arrested for using the Turbo. Dwayne escapes when Gladys gets arrested only to get bitten by Nugent.

Pan's Labyrinth
 <!-- Read this before editing: 1. This is a synopsis; try to keep it as short as possible. Tiny details don't need to be added. 2. The spoiler warning is no longer used on Wikipedia. --> In a [[fairy tale]], Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the [[underworld]], visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and dies. The king believes that eventually, her [[spirit]] will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths (which act as portals) around the world in preparation for her return.  In post-[[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] Spain in 1944 (after [[Francisco Franco]] has come into power), protagonist Ofelia travels with her pregnant but sickly mother Carmen, to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal is the son of a famed commander who died in [[Morocco]], believes strongly in [[Falangism]], and has been assigned to hunt down [[Spanish maquis|republican rebels]].  A large [[stick insect]], which Ofelia believes to be a [[fairy]], leads Ofelia into an ancient stone [[labyrinth]], but she is stopped by Mercedes, Vidal's housekeeper, who is secretly supporting the rebels, who include her brother, Pedro. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it becomes a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets the [[faun]], who believes she is the [[reincarnation]] of Princess Moanna. He gives her three tasks to complete  in order for her to acquire [[immortality]]. Meanwhile, Vidal murders two local farmers detained (erroneously) on suspicion of helping the rebels.  Ofelia completes the first task—retrieving a key from the belly of a giant [[toad]]—but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a [[Mandrake|mandrake root]], which eases Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task—retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster.<ref name=voice>[https://www.voicemagazine.org/pdf/pdf2007/1543_Nov_16_07_VOICE.pdf "Books, Music, and Film to Wake Up Your Muse and Help You Change the World"] , ''The Voice'', Volume 15, Issue 43, November 16, 2007.</ref> Although she was warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.  Vidal tortures a captive rebel, and then kills Doctor Ferreiro&mdash;who is also a rebel collaborator—after he [[Euthanasia|euthanized]] the tortured prisoner. Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root. Carmen throws it into the fire, where it writhes and screams in agony. Carmen immediately develops painful contractions and [[Maternal death|dies giving birth]] to a son. Soon after, Vidal discovers that his housekeeper Mercedes is a spy. Ofelia is locked in her bedroom, and Mercedes is taken to be tortured. However, she frees herself, stabs Vidal, and rejoins the rebels.  The faun returns to Ofelia and tells her to bring her baby brother into the labyrinth. Vidal pursues her. The faun tells Ofelia that opening the [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent. The faun suggests a few drops of her baby brother's blood. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother; for further disobeying his orders, the faun refuses to help her.  Vidal finds Ofelia talking to someone (the faun) whom Vidal cannot see. Vidal takes the baby from her arms and fatally shoots Ofelia; then, when he reaches the labyrinth's entrance, he is surrounded by the rebels who have taken over the outpost. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, demanding that she tell his son the exact time of his father's death. Mercedes replies that the child will never know so much as his name, and Pedro kills Vidal.  Mercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts the dying girl. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the center of the spiral stone staircase onto an [[altar]]. Ofelia then appears in a golden throne room. The king of the underworld says that she passed the final test, which was to choose to spill her own blood rather than that of her baby half-brother. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, and addresses her as "Her Majesty". The queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia/Moanna to sit next to her father, and rule at his side. In the stone labyrinth, Ofelia smiles as she dies.  The epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she ruled wisely and left quiet traces of her time in the human realm, "visible only to those who know where to look".  
Paprika (2006 film)
 In the near future, a revolutionary new [[psychotherapy]] treatment called dream therapy has been invented. A device called the "DC Mini" allows the user to view people's dreams. The head of the team working on this treatment, Doctor Atsuko Chiba, begins using the machine illegally to help psychiatric patients outside the research facility, using her [[alter-ego]] "Paprika", a sentient persona that she assumes in the dream world.  Paprika counsels Detective Toshimi Konakawa, who is plagued by a recurring dream. Its incompleteness is a great source of anxiety for him. At the end of the session, she gives Konakawa a card with a name of a website on it. This type of counselling session is not officially sanctioned, so Chiba, her associates and Konakawa must be cautious that word does not leak out regarding the nature of the DC Mini and the existence of Paprika. Chiba's closest ally is Doctor Kōsaku Tokita, a genius man-child and the inventor of the DC Mini. Because they are unfinished, the DC Minis lack access restrictions, allowing anyone to enter another person's dreams, which poses grave consequences when they are stolen. Almost immediately, the chief of the department, Doctor Toratarō Shima, goes on a nonsensical tirade and jumps through a window, nearly killing himself.  Upon examining Shima's dream, consisting of a lively parade of objects, Tokita recognizes his assistant, Kei Himuro, which confirms their suspicion that the theft was an inside job. After two other scientists fall victim to the DC Mini, the chairman of the company, who was against the project to begin with, bans the use of the device completely. This fails to hinder the crazed parade, which manages to claim Tokita, who went inside Himuro's dream trying to find answers and intruded into Konakawa's dream. Paprika and Shima take matters into their own hands and find that Himuro is only an empty shell. The real culprit is the chairman, with the help of Doctor Morio Osanai, who believes that he must protect dreams from mankind's influence through dream therapy. Paprika is eventually captured by the pair after an exhausting chase. There, Osanai admits his love for Chiba and literally peels away Paprika's skin to reveal Chiba underneath. However, he is interrupted by the outraged Chairman who demands that they finish off Chiba; as the two share Osanai's body, they battle for control as they argue over Chiba's fate. Konakawa enters the dream from his own recurring dream, and flees with Chiba back into his. Osanai gives chase through Konakawa's recurring dream, which ends in Konakawa shooting Osanai to take control of the dream. The act actually kills Osanai's physical body with a real bullet wound.  Dreams and reality have now merged. The dream parade is running amok in the city, and reality itself is starting to unravel. Shima is nearly killed by a giant Japanese doll, but is saved by Paprika, who has become an entity separate from Chiba thanks to dreams and reality merging. Amidst the chaos, Tokita, in the form of a giant robot, eats Chiba and prepares to do the same for Paprika. A ghostly [[Ghost|apparition]] of Chiba appears and reveals that she has been in love with Tokita this whole time and has simply been repressing these emotions. She comes to terms with her own repressed desires, reconciling herself with the part of her that is Paprika. The chairman returns in the form of a living nightmare, reveals his twisted dreams of [[omnipotence]], and threatens to darken the world with his delusions. Paprika returns to Tokita, throwing herself into his body. A baby emerges from the robotic shell and sucks in the wind, aging as she sucks up the chairman himself, becoming a fully-grown combination of Chiba and Paprika. In this new form, she is able to consume the chairman's dream form and end the nightmare he created before fading away.  In the final scene, Chiba sits at Tokita's bedside as he wakes up. Later on, Konakawa visits the website from Paprika's card and receives a message from Paprika: "Atsuko will change her surname to Tokita...and I suggest watching the movie ''Dreaming Kids''." Konakawa enters a movie theater and purchases a ticket for ''Dreaming Kids''.

Kitty meets Charles Townsend ([[Liev Schreiber]]), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of [[adultery]], if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of [[Republic of China (1912-49)|China]]. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked [[cholera]] [[epidemic]] sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating "Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.  She is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near-squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with Wan Xi (Lu Yan), a young Chinese woman, in relative opulence.  Walter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter – in love with Kitty again – assures her it doesn't matter.  The cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease<ref>[[John Snow (physician)]]</ref>) cholera-carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.  Five years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might be the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies "No one important, darling".

The Paper Will Be Blue
 The film begins with a scene of an [[armored personnel carrier|armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) and a military checkpoint in the background. Two men come out of it, one in civilian clothing, the other in a [[Militsiya|Militia]] (''Miliţia'') uniform, and light up cigarettes. Suddenly, the soldiers manning the checkpoint open fire and kill all of the APC's occupants.  The film then cuts to a Militia night patrol in Bucharest. Out of enthusiasm, one of the men, Costi Andronescu, abandons the mission and decides to fight for the cause of the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Revolution]] at the Television building. His [[Commanding officer|CO]], Lt. Neagu and the rest of the [[fireteam]] search for him during the confusing night of 22 December 1989.  Costi meets a group in a truck on their way to defend the TV station. He is in uniform and greeted as a brother and told "you are a civilian now" and he swaps items of uniform with the other men for civilian clothing. He and an unnamed Gypsy are asked to step down as they need to take an injured soldier to hospital after the truck is flagged down.  Costi and the Gypsy end up in a villa with soldiers and fighters under Army command. The villa is under attack by what are presumed to be forces loyal to the Communist regime and the two men are ordered to defend it. At one point, however, they realize that the "enemy" are also Army soldiers and try to explain the situation to one of the officers at the scene, only to be branded "terrorists" and "Arabs". Costi is found to be partly in uniform, which further aggravates their situation. He receives a mild beating and the two are confined in the cellar. Later a Colonel checks out Costi's bona fides and he is allowed to go. Meanwhile, his CO Lt. Neagu (who treats Costi and his men like sons) has been driving all over the city until he calls at Costi's mother's place where they watch TV, smoke cigarettes and wait for him to turn up, fearing he is dead.  Eventually he turns up, they drive back to base. The film ends with them in the same standoff seen at the beginning, sitting in their APC while regular army soldiers ask them to identify themselves at the checkpoint. The men are unsure what to reply, but decide to give their Militia password several times ("the paper will be blue"). The film ends just before the soldiers start shooting.

The story has a lot of potential with a relevant political issue and there are some political comments too—like hints at the failure of the government machinery and religious institutions, which ought to come to the aid of the peasants. The film opens with the protagonist Nandakumar ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran|Prithviraj]]), who is a reporter of the television channel ''Kerala Today'', being sent to ''Pannakamkudi '' to do a regular series on the plight of the farmers of the area. He alights on the mission with his cameraman Abu (Sudheesh) to the high ranges, delivering daily reports in the prime time news about the crop failure, low prices for agricultural products, inability to repay loans issued by banks and cut-throat interest rates charged by private financiers, which eventually force the peasants to commit mass suicides.  Nandakumar and his crew meet 87-year-old Kochuthekkethil Kunjappan ([[Thilakan]]) in the verandah of the village office. He is one of the early settlers of the region and has been demonstrating before the village office since 14 years seeking justice from the authorities who seize his farmland, branding him a millionaire. And from the directives of the old man and the local priest Abraham Thekkilakkaadan, they meet Thenginthottathil Joseph ([[T G Ravi]]) and his family members, who are in the grip of severe financial problems and on the brink of desperation and even suicide. Joseph's eldest daughter Merlin (Sreeja Chandran) works for a private exporting company and his second daughter Celine ([[Jyothirmayi]]) is a medical student who is currently pursuing her final year house surgeonship. The family and the villagers pin all their hopes on Celine, who will be the first doctor from the village. Joseph who had to borrow loans from four different banks for his daughter's educational expenses finds it hard to settle the accounts.  Slowly the media team becomes a part of the village, and their serialized investigative reports on Kerala Today, start to cause many people in the government circles and the local heartless money lender Ummachan ([[Jagadish]]), lose their sleep. The crew faces many hardships in the village as many even manhandle the team.  The media management goes a step further and asks Nandakumar to stop reporting on the issue and to return to the city. But he turns down the request and continues there. But as days pass by, the villagers’ plights become more hapless as many more suicides follow, including that of Merlin and Joseph. What follows in the film is how Nandakumar, with the support of Celine and other villagers, finds ways to rescue the villages from the chaos that they face.

Seetha moves to the house opposite to Sumathi's house. Her husband and son are still back in their city, waiting to finish training. Sumathi approaches her to work as a maid. Seetha becomes impressed at first sight by Sumathi's wise and sensible character and takes her as her maid. After a few days, Seetha comes to know that the house she has moved into, was initially owned by Sumathi's family. She soon gets influenced by Sumathi’s modesty, kindness, and good nature. Sumathi also had the habit of writing novels, one of which she shared with Seetha. Seetha imagined her son and Sumathi as the characters in the story, which gave her the opportunity to react differently. Assuming that her son and Sumathi are fictional characters in the story, she expresses her desire to make Sumathi her daughter-in-law. At first Sumathi is shocked, but later accepts her request happily.  Seetha communicates this arrangement over the phone to her husband and son, that she has chosen her daughter-in-law. However, she did not reveal the name or identity of Sumathi, because she wants it to be a surprise when they meet her in person. Unfortunately, Seetha dies in an accident before her husband and son's arrival, which leaves a suspense to who the daughter-in-law is.  After his mother's death, Surendhar vows to locate and marry a girl identified by her mother. Since Sumathi is a maid in the house and is much poorer compared to Seetha's family, she does not reveal that she's the one. Sampooranam ([[K. Bhagyaraj|Bhagyaraj]]), Surendhar's close friend moves into their house to snoop around and find out the girl identified by Seetha. As a father, Santhosh didn't have patience and wanted his son to have a good life. This led him to choose a rich girl, completely opposite of what Seetha would have chosen.  Passed many twists and turns, Sampooranam finally succeeds in identifying that Sumathi was the girl Seetha chose. His main evidence was Sumathi's published novel, the one she shared to Seetha.

The story ends with Sumathi remembering the words of Seetha, that she has always imagined Sumathi to be the wife of her son.

Meanwhile a  software firm (named Underware Hardware and Software Company!) headed by Dr. Rajendra Prasad ([[Brahmanandam]]) is facing a hostile take over by another firm. Rajendra Prasad had to build the world’s fastest supercomputer in time to halt the takeover. But the rival firm sabotage his invention. Rajendra Prasad had no option but to sell his company to his rival, but decides not to and explores more options. Meanwhile Nani and Bujji worm their way into Rajendra Prasad’s company promising to give him the technology for a talking computer (named Bujji Babu 007) that would bring him the much needed millions. But Rajendra Prasad is assassinated while in their company. Fearing that fingers would point to them, they hide his body. A look alike takes Rajendra Prasad’s place and tries to sell the company as quickly as possible so that he would get the interest of ₹20 crores. Rajendra Prasad’s daughter Madhu (Madhu Sharma), meanwhile, falls in love with Nani. What follows is a series of anecdotes that lead to the unraveling of the mystery of the killer of the original Rajendra Prasad and preventing the rival company Wonderware from taking over Underware thus keeping to the wish of the original Rajendra Prasad.   The plot moves with interesting references to the world of computers with names borrowed from the terminology used by geeks in the IT campuses, like Microchip and Potato chip are the code names used by two employees ([[Ravi Prakash]] and his assistant) to sabotage the work of the company run by Rajendra Prasad. The role of a professional killer is played by [[Ravi Babu]] who kills only humans and not animals. But to his bad luck he ends up killing animals, accidentally, every time he tries to kill someone and is heart broken. This is a slapstick comedy with many inter-connected sub-plots that keep complicating the plot and adding to its hilarity. Lots of corporate espionage, sabotage, comedy and romance with a happy ending – that is the story of ‘Party’.

Penelope (2006 film)
  Penelope Wilhern ([[Christina Ricci]]) is a young woman from a wealthy family. What sets her apart is that she [[Pig-faced women|has the ears and nose of a pig]].  Generations ago, an embittered and vengeful [[Witchcraft|witch]] ([[Michael Feast]]) placed a curse on the Wilhern family after their son had an affair with her daughter, one of the Wilhern servants, and, talked out of marrying her by his arrogant and disapproving family, abandoned her and married someone of his own status. The heartbroken and pregnant servant girl then threw herself off a cliff. Furious, the witch then cursed the Wilherns so that the next daughter to be born into the affluent family would have the face of a [[pig]]. For five generations, the Wilherns produced only sons, until Penelope was born with her “ugly” face, stricken with the curse. It is said that the curse can only be lifted if 'one of her own kind' learns to love her, which her parents interpret as meaning that Penelope must marry a man of [[aristocracy|noble birth]].  A tabloid [[Journalist|reporter]] named Lemon ([[Peter Dinklage]]) begins [[stalking]] the family to get a photograph of the infant Penelope resulting in Penelope's mother Jessica ([[Catherine O'Hara]]) blinding his right eye after he breaks into their house. Then Jessica and Franklin ([[Richard E. Grant]]) decide to fake their daughter's death and cloister her away in their mansion where Penelope spends her life immersing herself in intellectual pursuits such as literature, [[horticulture]], and music. When Penelope becomes an adult, her parents attempt to introduce her to possible suitors, hoping that one of them will fall in love with her and break the curse, with the help of a matchmaker named Wanda ([[Ronni Ancona]]). Unfortunately, every man who lays eyes on her flees in terror, including Edward Humphrey Vanderman III ([[Simon Woods]]), a spoiled, arrogant snob who finds her repulsive. Normally, Jessica and Franklin's butler Jake (also [[Michael Feast]]) catches them before they leave, but he fails to catch Vanderman.  Vanderman's panicked flight from the Wilhern house results in a newspaper article dubbing him insane. To redeem his name, Vanderman decides to team up with Lemon (who is now wearing an eyepatch over his right eye) in an effort to get a photograph of Penelope. The two of them track down Max Campion ([[James McAvoy]]), a young blue blood disowned by his family because of his gambling problem and in desperate need of money. Lemon and Vanderman pay Max to pose as a new suitor for Penelope, hiding a camera in his jacket so that he can steal a picture of her. After talking to Penelope through a one-way mirror, Max is unexpectedly caught off guard by her sweetness and charm, and Penelope also trusts him enough to show him her face. Though Max is not frightened of Penelope, he accidentally triggers the camera in his jacket, which causes him to retreat.  A heartbroken Penelope believes that Max too finds her monstrous and instead begs him to marry her simply for her status and in order to break the curse, even promising to [[suicide|kill herself]] if the marriage doesn't break the curse. Max, though obviously torn, insists that he cannot marry Penelope. He then calls off his agreement with Lemon and Vanderman and destroys the camera, realizing that their attempt to exploit Penelope is wrong.  Meanwhile, Penelope, inspired by Max's conversations about the outside world, decides to flee the protection of her parents' home, and journeys out into the city, naive and ignorant about normal life. She uses a [[scarf]] to cover her face. Penelope's courage in going out to the world then acts as an inspiration for Max, who quits gambling and starts work in an [[Wilton's Music Hall|old theatre]].  While at a bar, Penelope ends up befriending a [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery girl]] named Annie ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) who becomes her "real world" mentor and best friend. Having no money and seeing that Lemon and Vanderman are offering a reward for a photograph of her, she decides to collect on the reward by producing a photo of herself. When her parents see Penelope, she runs from them and then passes out in the bar that Annie is in causing Penelope's scarf to be removed. To her surprise, Penelope becomes an overnight celebrity, flocked by adoring fans who are not disgusted by her face.  Meanwhile, Vanderman's father Edward Vandermann II ([[Nigel Havers]]), seeing the public's fondness for Penelope and embarrassed by his son's vocal cruelty toward her, coerces Edward into proposing to the girl. Lemon eventually discovers that the man he and Vanderman recruited to photograph Penelope is not Max Campion, but actually another man named Johnny Martin who took the job for money while the real Campion ([[Nick Frost]]) is in jail. On Penelope's wedding day, he provides the information to Jessica and Wanda. Though Wanda wants to tell Penelope the truth, Jessica forces her to keep it a secret, believing that Edward is Penelope's only chance to break the curse. Penelope nearly marries him, but backs out of the wedding at the last minute when she realizes that she does not want to marry simply to break the curse. Though Penelope's mother urges her to marry Vanderman and at last lead a 'normal life', an exasperated Penelope says that she likes herself the way she is. This breaks the curse, as Penelope has at last been loved by 'one of her own kind' – herself – and her [[pig]] snout and ears disappear.  As the months pass, Penelope moves on with her life, becoming a [[Horticulture|horticulturist]] and [[teacher]], and the spectacle of her former appearance is gradually forgotten by the public even when the news of a [[gorilla]] boy being found in a laundry hamper eclipses it. After he quits his job after 25 years, Jake is revealed to be the witch who had cursed the family long ago and renders Jessica unable to speak with magic. After realizing that Jessica can no longer speak, Wanda breaks down and tells Penelope about Johnny Martin. That Halloween, Penelope finds several of her students dressing up as her old pig self, and dons a "Penelope" mask as she goes to reunite with Johnny, who she discovers lives nearby. Johnny, not knowing that the curse has been broken, kisses Penelope and apologizes to her, saying that he does not have the power to break the curse. Penelope then reveals that she had the power to lift the curse all along, and the two share a passionate kiss, beginning a romantic relationship.  In the final scenes, Penelope concludes telling her story to a group of children in a park-like area. When Penelope asks her class what the moral of the story is, they give out answers like “rich people stink” and “it’s always the mother’s fault”, until one bright boy replies, “it’s not the power of the curse, it’s the power you give the curse”, Penelope acknowledges the answer. After the children are dismissed, Johnny and Penelope walk up the hill to a swing, where he is seen happily pushing her. Meanwhile, on a nearby lake, Lemon rows up in a small [[Watercraft rowing|rowboat]] and is about to take a picture revealing to the world what has happened to Penelope. Observing their happiness, Lemon decides to leave them alone as he rows away.  
Pehla Pehla Pyaar
 Zimmy ([[Ali Tabish]]) and Tina ([[Resham]]) belong to middle-class families; live and study in [[Dubai]], and fall in love after initial indecisiveness. Zimmy becomes a famous singer thanks to Tina who appears in his first music video as a friendly-cum-romantic gesture. Seth Tahir Dawood ([[Nadeem Baig (actor)|Nadeem]]) in Bangkok catches a glimpse of Tina on TV and asks his personal secretary, played by Kanwal, to arrange his meeting with her. The secretary is helped by Sweetie ([[Sajid Hasan]]), Tina's brother - a drunkard and a gambler - who manages to convince her mother that the 40-something Seth is the perfect match for Tina. Zimmy returns from an outdoor shoot to learn of the marriage and heartbroken, vows never to get married. But unknown to him, he is admired by Haya ([[Zara Sheikh]]), the daughter of Seth Dawood and Tina's step daughter.  The film moves at an amazingly rapid pace in the latter half, but sadly in no particular direction. People die as if there is they have some kind of death wish, and the abrupt conclusion confirms that the director, for reasons better known to him, was in a rush to wrap things up.  
Peaceful Warrior
  Dan Millman is a university student as well as a locally famous gymnast who dreams of winning a National Championship competition. He suffers from restlessness, and on one occasion, Dan attempts to compensate for the restlessness by running along streets before sunrise. At a car-service station, he encounters an old man who seems to know more about Dan's problem than Dan himself knows, whom Dan later nicknames "Socrates". Dan is unsettled by Socrates' knowledge; by the fact that Socrates had appeared in a nightmare as a faceless janitor, clad in mismatched shoes (by which he is identified in waking life), who sweeps up the pieces of Dan's shattered leg; and by the old man's extraordinary speed, agility, and coordination. As a result of his exposure to the last, Dan seeks to learn the secret behind it.  Socrates, prodded by the impatient and defiant Dan, gives the boy a series of tasks and lessons. The central concept of "Soc's" philosophy is this: that one must live entirely in the present moment. Other ideas include the related notion that at no time is "nothing going on" and the idea that an appropriate time exists for fighting and another for abstaining from violence. These lessons are conveyed through practical lessons, long contemplation, and one spectacular mystical experience. Dan gradually learns to appreciate every moment; to view the journey toward a goal as more meaningful and significant than the attainment; to pay attention to that which he is doing &ndash; thus increasing his gymnastic prowess; and (to a slightly lesser extent) control himself. Throughout the lesson, Dan learns virtually nothing about his mentor, other than the philosophy, Socrates' belief that service is the most noble action possible (hence his choice to work as a car serviceman), and the presence of another [[protégé]].  This protégé, a woman of Dan's own age named Joy, has learned and integrated Socrates' philosophy into her life, to the extent that she seems as wise as Socrates himself. Dan attempts to ask her for information regarding Socrates, but receives little. Joy treats Dan indulgently, though she evidently respects him.  One day, Dan drives recklessly, and his motorcycle collides with a car that ran a red light, causing his right [[femur]] bone to shatter. He is rushed to a hospital, where a metal bar is placed in his leg to maintain its integrity. As a result, his gymnastic coach believes that Dan cannot compete in the National competition. Dan, hurt by this lack of faith, recovers from the injury and resumes his training under Socrates' tutelage. Eventually, he is restored to full health and strength, while his coordination improves and his mind is set entirely on the present moment. He competes in the U.S. Trials for the Olympics and achieves a victory.  Slightly before the competition, Dan diverts the bus he is riding to Socrates' station, only to find that Socrates has vanished without a trace. At the arena, he attempts to teach his teammate Tommy what he has learned, but fails due to Tommy's emotional insecurity and lack of comprehension. Dan then is called upon for his turn to perform on the [[Rings (gymnastics)|still rings]]. While he does his routine, Dan performs flawlessly just like Pommel Horse tryouts. Moments before he completes his routine, Socrates is in his thoughts asking him three questions: "Where are you, Dan?" "Here." "What time is it?" "Now." "What are You?" "This Moment." Dan then performs his triple consecutive flips, the Commentators frantically speaking, and the judges staring at him in amazement. He then dismounts, while the rings swing outwards, eventually touching each other. The screen goes black, leaving his last moment unknown.  The postscript states that Dan and his Berkeley Gymnastics Team won their first National title. It is implied at the end, in a postscript appearing on screen, that Dan of the film and Dan the author of the [[Way of the Peaceful Warrior|book]] on which the film is based are one and the same. It is also stated that the latter Dan lives with his wife Joy.  
Pattiyal
  Kosi ([[Arya (actor)|Arya]]) and Selva ([[Bharath (actor)|Bharath]]), are [[contract killer]]s working for a middleman with the ironic name of Sami ([[Cochin Haneefa]]). Director Vishnuvardan portrays this morbid telling of two orphaned youths with incredible realism of trust, friendship, and ultimate betrayal masterfully. Kosi is an unblinking man with a stubborn feel for life thereby refusing to love and be loved. Selva, deaf and dumb, is equally intrepid although he has a heart ticking beneath the dark, dire exterior.  Saroja ([[Padmapriya Janakiraman]]), a salesgirl at a garment company, is an outgoing, sprightly girl and a friend of both Kosi and Selva. She is in deeply in love with Kosi, but the latter only finds her presence as a nuisance, whereas Saroja's chief manager stubbornly tries to make Saroja sleep with him. In stark contrast to this romance is the love between Selva and Sandhya ([[Pooja Umashankar]]), who are smitten with each other after some fate-based encounters that bring some lighthearted humor to the film. As the film progresses, Kosi and Saroja end up sleeping together when Kosi begins to drink excessively, promptly making him start to realize his feelings for Saroja. Unfortunately, this newfound happiness does not last as their profession does not allow it to.  Kosi and Selva set out to assassinate Avinashi Nachimuthu Gounder ([[Santhana Bharathi]]), a business tycoon and uprising politician, as instructed to do so by Sami. Kosi and Selva mutually agree to make this assignment their last, and to begin leading normal lives with their newfound loves Saroja and Sandhya respectively. A new twist occurs in the story where the people who hired Saami told him to finish off Kosi and Selva once the job is completed.  Upon preparing for the assassination, Kosi becomes unable to think as he finds himself overwhelmed with feelings of love, at which point Selva decides that he should finish the execution himself and Kosi should go speak with Saroja. Kosi visits Saroja at her home where he finds her shivering and with bruises. Saroja then tells Kosi how her chief manager intruded the house and sexually violated her after she refused to love him. Infuriated at this, an emotionally shaken Kosi finds the manager and beats him to a horrific death. Meanwhile, Selva had cunningly assassinated Avinashi Nachimuthu Gounder and is returning home. The manager's boss, who happens to be a big don himself, finds out that Kosi is the one responsible for the manager's death, and seeks out revenge. He gets hold of Saami and blackmails him to bring Kosi to him for his life. Unknowingly, Kosi goes with Saami and is killed in the ambush from a gunshot to his head.  Selva, who returns later, finds out about this unfortunate event and seeks revenge. He visits Sandhya and questions her about Kosi's murder and the people responsible for his death. He intrudes the don's house and kills everyone in his way including the don. When Selva returned home, Sandhya was shocked to see him with many injuries. Sandhya tells Selva to wait by the door while she went to call for an auto rickshaw to get them both to the hospital. Meanwhile, the irritating boy who appeared before begging for a job, stabs Selva in the same approach as Selva did in the introduction scene in the hotel room. The boy who was still recovering for the shock that he actually stabbed Selva, stabbed him again multiple times when he saw Sandhya rushing towards him. Selva dies from multiple wounds and falls on Sandhya's lap. In the scene before the credits, a scene is shown where Saami is having a chat with the boy who committed the murder. The scene is shown as a deja-vu where Saami convinces Kosi and Selva that they're all part of this scheme together. Saami uses the same dialogue to the boy letting the audience connect that the boy will end being killed too.

After making Sivapprakasam ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]) and Ilakkiyan MLAs, he falls out with them and they murder him. Perarasu, who has seen this murder, now wants to take revenge.  In the end, Perarasu fits a bomb on a chair in a meeting on which Ilakkiyan sits. Kasi, desperate to save Ilakkiyan, goes into the room and prefers to die with Ilakkiyan. Perarasu feeling proud for his brother preferring to give up his life for his duty, saves both of them, but is shot by Ilakkiyan. Kasi then shoots Ilakkiyan, and Perarasu takes the blame before dying. The film ends with Kasi marrying the heroine and returning to become the next chieftain of his native village.  
Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)
  The film begins with the sentencing of [[Jean-Baptiste Grenouille]] ([[Ben Whishaw]]), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner's]] apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl ([[Karoline Herfurth]]) selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.  After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), with his ability to identify and create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to preserve scents. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. Grenouille continues working for Baldini but is saddened when he learns that Baldini's method of [[distillation]] will not capture the scents of all objects. Baldini informs Grenouille of another method that can be learned in [[Grasse]] and agrees to help him by providing the journeyman papers he requires in exchange for 100 new perfume formulas. Right after Grenouille departs, Baldini dies when the shaky building, along with his studio, collapses. En route to Grasse, Grenouille decides to exile himself from society, taking refuge in a cave. During this time, he discovers that he lacks any [[body odor|personal scent]] himself, and believes this is why he is perceived as strange or disturbing by others. Deciding to continue his quest, he leaves his cave and continues to Grasse.  Upon arrival in Grasse, Grenouille catches the scent of Laura Richis ([[Rachel Hurd-Wood]]), the beautiful, redheaded daughter of the wealthy Antoine Richis ([[Alan Rickman]]) and decides that she will be his "thirteenth scent", the linchpin of his perfume. Grenouille finds a job in Grasse under Madame Arnulfi ([[Corinna Harfouch]]) and learns the method of [[enfleurage]]. He kills a young lavender picker and attempts to extract her scent using the method of hot enfleurage, which fails. After this, he attempts the method of cold enfleurage on a prostitute he hired, but she becomes alarmed and tries to throw him out. He murders her and successfully preserves the scent of the woman. Grenouille embarks on a killing spree, targeting beautiful young women and capturing their scents using his perfected method. He dumps the women's naked corpses around the city, creating panic. After preserving the first twelve scents, Grenouille plans his attack on Laura. During a church sermon denouncing and [[excommunication|excommunicating]] the murderer, it is announced that a man has confessed to the murders. Richis remains unconvinced and secretly flees the city with his daughter, telling no one their destination. Grenouille tracks her scent to a roadside inn and sneaks into her room that night, murdering her.  Soldiers capture Grenouille moments after he finishes preparing his perfume. On the day of his execution, he applies the perfume on himself, forcing the jailers to release him. The executioner and the crowd in attendance are speechless at the beauty of the perfume; they declare Grenouille innocent before falling into a massive [[orgy]]. Richis, still convinced of Grenouille's guilt, threatens him with his sword, but he is then overwhelmed by the scent and embraces Grenouille as his "son." Walking out of Grasse unscathed, Grenouille has enough perfume to rule the world, but has discovered that it will not allow him to love or be loved like a normal person. Disenchanted by his aimless quest, he returns to the Parisian fish market where he was born and pours the remaining perfume over his head. Overcome by the scent and in the belief that Grenouille is an angel, the nearby crowd [[cannibalism|devours]] him. The next morning, all that is left are his clothes and the empty bottle, from which one final drop of perfume falls.

Phir Hera Pheri
 ''[[Hera Pheri (2000 film)|Hera Pheri]]'' ended with the trio of Raju ([[Akshay Kumar]]), Shyam/ghanshyam ([[Sunil Shetty]]), and Baburao Ganapathrao Apte ([[Paresh Rawal]]) rich and rolling in money. ''Phir Hera Pheri'' tells the story of what happens after they become rich.  The film opens with a prologue bringing the audience up to date, stating that each has suffered a personal loss despite their new riches. Shyam lost his love, Anuradha ([[Tabu (actress)]]), in an automobile accident, Raju's mother died after battling a disease, and Baburao - having nothing to lose in the first place - lost the little traces of common sense that he did possess.  The three men are living a king's life in a massive [[bungalow]] and splurging on various luxuries. Raju hears about an idea for doubling his wealth from a [[confidence trick|con woman]], Anuradha ([[Tabu (actress)|Bipasha Basu]]), who is claiming to be a bank manager, and he convinces Shyam and Baburao to go along with it. Raju first arranges for 30 [[lakh]] from Shyam and Baburao and then a further 50 lakh by selling their bungalow. He convinces a small-time goon, Pappu ([[Rajpal Yadav]]) to contribute the remaining balance of 20 lakh so that he can come up with the minimum deposit of 1 [[crore]], which Anuradha has promised to double.  The trio invest the money and three weeks later realise that it was all a scam and that they are now penniless. To make matters worse, they do not even have possession of their bungalow, which Raju had sold off in order to arrange the last bit of money needed, and have to live in a chawl (tenement). Pappu shows up to the bungalow the next day to pick up his portion of the money, but is shocked to learn that Raju has left and the bungalow is now in possession of a gun collector ([[Dinesh Hingoo]]). Pappu is now in trouble because he had borrowed money from a [[lisping]] but dreaded gangster, Tiwari ([[Sharat Saxena]]), who will kill him if he doesn't pay up. He comes across Raju one day, and upon hearing of the scam pretends to be sympathetic. He tricks him and brings the three to his boss, telling him that they are the ones who took the money. Tiwari threatens them and tells them they have to come up with the money or else they will die. As they are being taken home by some of Tiwari's goons, the three manage to escape. Raju, Shyam and Baburao are about to leave the city when Raju remembers that he owes money to a woman named Anjali ([[Rimi Sen]]). The three head over to her house and are surprised to find that she is Pappu's sister. Tiwari's goons show up and kidnap Anjali because Pappu has not returned the money. Feeling guilty that he is the one who got Anjali in trouble, Raju decides that he will go to Tiwari and try to get her freed. Shyam and Baburao refuse to leave without them and decide to stay as well. The three go back to Tiwari to ask him to release Anjali, and Tiwari tells them to bring the money, releasing Anjali.  Raju, Shyam and Baburao now have three days to come up with 40 lakh to pay back the goon or else they will themselves be killed. Raju overhears the neighbor, Munnabhai ([[Johnny Lever]]), plotting to steal drugs from another gangster, Nanji Bhai ([[Milind Gunaji]]), and wrongly assumes they are talking about stealing money. Raju hatches a plan for the three of them to steal from Munnabhai. The three manage to barely succeed, but are confused when they do not find money inside. Raju recognizes the stuff as drugs and tells them that they are worth at least 3 crore (thirty million). They think that if they can sell them to Kachara Seth ([[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]]) and pay off Tiwari, they can also become rich, but their neighbor once again steals the drugs from them. They then run into Anuradha and she tells them that the entire scam was hatched by Kabeera (the gangster from the first ''Hera Pheri'') to get revenge on the trio, and that the only reason she went along with it was because they were holding her niece hostage (Anuradha's sister was Kabeera's gang member and part of the first movie's kidnapping plot). Their money was converted to diamonds to pay the ransom, but she fled with them once she discovered her niece had escaped and hid them under a decoration of a circus float.  In the end, all the guys end up in a [[circus]] show where they attempt to get hold of the diamonds. These are strewn all over the ground in public by a [[gorilla]]. Raju escapes with Pappu's cellphone and three antique guns with him, which are worth 5–6 crore, though he does not know about it. Pappu informs Shyam and Baburao about the guns, after which they try to call Raju on his cellphone. The film ends in a cliffhanger where Raju is about to throw the guns in the river with his cellphone ringing in his pocket.  This movie is an adaptation of the Hollywood film, ''[[Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'', starring [[Jason Statham]].

Peter and the Wolf (2006 film)
 On the edge of the vast forests of Russia, where wolves still roam, lies a little cottage surrounded by a big, high fence. This is where Peter lives with his grumpy Grandfather. Pete is a 11-year old boy who is constantly picked on by the town's people and his Grandfather will not let Peter go out into the forest. Peter has a friend, the lovable Ducky (a [[Indian runner duck|runner duck]] in this version), with whom he hangs around Grandfather's yard. A Bird (a [[hooded crow]] in this version) with a broken wing arrives in the yard. Bird is very impatient with Peter and signals to go into the forest. His heart beating fast, Peter tiptoes into the cottage and reaches over his sleeping Grandfather and his snoring, overweight tabby cat. Ever so carefully Peter takes the keys to the gate.  Peter has the time of his life playing in the forest with his friends. He helps Bird to fly, using a balloon and some rope.  Then everyone skates on the frozen lake. Everyone, that is, except the cat. She lunges at the Bird to eat him, but is so fat that she crashes straight through the ice and into the freezing water. Grandfather awakes and sees that Peter is in the forest. Very angry, he grabs his gun and rushes outside. He grabs Peter off the ice, drags him back into the cottage and locks the fence. Suddenly the forest goes quiet. Peter looks out through a hole in the fence and sees the Wolf on the edge of the forest. The Cat manages to climb up the tree for safety, but the Wolf swallows the Duck whole. Peter slings a heavy net over his shoulder and climbs up the fence and into the tree. Peter falls from the tree and the Wolf attacks him. Eventually, after a long and fierce struggle, Peter catches the Wolf in the net.  Peter's Grandfather drives into town with the captured Wolf, Peter standing, triumphant, on top of the Wolf's cage. However, the people do not acknowledge Peter's success and his grandfather takes credit for the wolf's capture. The Bird's broken wing heals and is able to fly again. The town bullies (the very same who pick on Peter) arrive and chastise the defenseless Wolf with a gun. After looking into the Wolf's sorry eyes and having become disillusioned with both his grandfather as well as the town for its poor treatment to them both, Peter opens the cage and the Wolf races back into the forest.  The ending is a complete departure from the original, in which the wolf is presumably left caged in the zoo. Throughout the latter parts of the story, the duck can be heard quacking inside the wolf, implying it is still alive.

  The wedding of [[Will Turner]] and [[Elizabeth Swann]] is halted when Lord [[Cutler Beckett]], chairman of the [[East India Company|East India Trading Company]], arrives with [[arrest warrant]]s for them, and also for Commodore [[James Norrington]], who allowed Captain [[Jack Sparrow]] to escape. Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's flagship, the HMS ''Dauntless'', in a hurricane while pursuing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father, [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]], aboard the ''[[Black Pearl]]''. Bootstrap is now a crewman on the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'', captained by [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Jack previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the ''Pearl'' from the depths; now Jack must join Jones' crew or be dragged to [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Davy Jones' Locker|Davy Jones' Locker]] by the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]. Beckett, meanwhile, promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magic compass which points to whatever the holder wants most.  Will finds Jack and the crew on an island and frees them from [[Cannibalism|cannibals]]. Shortly after, [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Governor Swann|Governor Swann]] frees Elizabeth from jail, but he is then captured. Elizabeth bargains with Beckett to find the compass. Disguised as a cabin boy aboard a Scottish merchant vessel, she makes her way to Tortuga where she later finds Jack and also a drunken Norrington. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit [[wikt:voodoo|voodoo]] priestess [[Tia Dalma]], who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, which is locked within the Dead Man's Chest. Jack must find it and the key that opens it. Locating the ''Dutchman'', Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass. Jack tricks Will, who is [[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] into service aboard the ''Dutchman''. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain in exchange for one hundred souls. Will meets his father aboard the ''Dutchman'' and learns that Jones possesses the key to the chest. They play a game of ''Liar's Dice'' against Jones to try and win the key, but they lose. Despite this, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him, sinking the ship, but Will escapes.  In [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Tortuga|Tortuga]], Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, they are able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on [[List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean#Isla Cruces|Isla Cruces]], where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken; Will wants to rescue his father; and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away the ''Dutchman''s crew. Jones attacks the ''Pearl'' with the Kraken, which devours most of the crew and destroys all but one of the ''Pearl''s lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and rum.  Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the ''Pearl'' to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the [[Letters of Marque]] meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The ''Pearl''s crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain who will guide them: the resurrected [[Hector Barbossa]].  In a [[post-credits scene]], the cannibalistic tribe now worships the prison dog in replacement of Jack.  
The Pink Panther (2006 film)
 Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus narrates a flashback of a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] semi-final match between [[France national football team|France]] and [[China national football team|China]]. French coach Yves Gluant enters the stadium, wearing the Pink Panther diamond ring, which is seen by his team as a symbol of pride and victory. He kisses his girlfriend, pop star Xania, and whispers something to her. After France wins the game in [[Golden goal|sudden death]], Gluant is killed by a poison dart, with the Pink Panther diamond nowhere to be found.  Eager to win the [[Légion d'honneur|Medal of Honour]], Dreyfus promotes a clumsy small-town policeman and "[[village idiot]]", [[Inspector Clouseau|Jacques Clouseau]], to the rank of Inspector and assigns him to the Pink Panther case. Dreyfus simultaneously assembles a secret team of top investigators to crack the case, allowing Clouseau to serve as the public face of the investigation and draw all the media attention. Dreyfus assigns Gilbert Ponton to be Clouseau's assistant, instructing him to keep him informed of Clouseau's actions. Despite his orders, Ponton quickly befriends Clouseau, as Clouseau attempts to solve the case by looking for clues and interviewing people close to Gluant, though not without being clumsy and foolish during his work. All throughout this, Clouseau also works alongside secretary Nicole Durant, and starts to fall in love with her.  Bizu, a French soccer player who had an affair with Xania and therefore is the prime suspect in Gluant's murder, is shot in the head and killed in the team's changing room. While at a casino to gather information, Clouseau encounters British Agent 006, Nigel Boswell. Boswell foils a robbery at the casino by the "Gas Mask Bandits", using Clouseau's trench coat to hide his identity. Clouseau mistakenly receives credit for the deed and is subsequently nominated for the Légion d'honneur, much to Dreyfus' dismay.  Clouseau and Ponton follow Xania to [[New York City]], suspecting that she knows more than she is telling. However, despite Ponton's insistence that she is most likely a suspect because Gluant cheated on her, Clouseau decides Xania is innocent. While in New York, Clouseau and Ponton eat hamburgers, and Clouseau discovers his love for the sandwich, which he had assumed to be nothing more than "disgusting American food". Meanwhile, because the poison that killed Gluant was derived from Chinese herbs, Dreyfus concludes that the killer is a Chinese envoy named Dr. Pang.  Ready to take charge of the case and win the Légion d'honneur, Dreyfus has one of his officers swap Clouseau's bag with one full of weapons at the airport. The bag sets off the metal detector at security control, causing the guards to be suspicious of Clouseau who is eventually arrested because of his inability to pronounce "hamburger" correctly (he tried to smuggle some for the flight home due to his personal dislike of in-flight meals). Upon his return to France, the press vilifies him and Dreyfus strips him of his rank of Inspector. Dreyfus now plots to publicly arrest Dr. Pang at the Presidential Ball, where Xania will also be performing.  Clouseau returns home and happens to see an article about his arrest online. He deduces from the photograph in it that Gluant and Bizu's assassin will target Xania next, and he phones Ponton and Nicole. The trio hurry to the [[Élysée Palace]] and sneak into the Presidential Ball. While Dreyfus publicly arrests Dr. Pang for Gluant's murder, Clouseau and Ponton save Xania's life by capturing her would-be assassin, Yuri, the trainer of the football team. Jealous of Gluant and believing he should've taken credit for the football team's success instead of Gluant, Yuri used his knowledge of Chinese herbs, mandated by a soccer statute, to kill him. After overhearing Yuri's rants, Bizu blackmailed him, so Yuri killed Bizu using Russian military tactics to target the latter's [[occipital lobe]]. Yuri targeted Xania because she ignored him while she dated Gluant. Clouseau reveals the Pink Panther was not stolen but instead sewn into the lining of Xania's purse. He discovered this after the photograph of his arrest also showed an X-ray of the purse going through airport security. Xania confessed that she received it from Gluant as an engagement ring — he had whispered his proposal to her prior to the football match — but she hid this fact because she thought it could implicate her as the killer. Clouseau concludes that Xania is the ring's rightful owner, while Yuri is taken into custody.  For successfully solving the case, Clouseau wins the Légion d'honneur. While leaving the ceremony with Ponton, Clouseau gets Dreyfus' suit caught in his car door; he remains oblivious to Dreyfus' screams as he drives away. Clouseau, Ponton and Nicole later visit him in the hospital. After Clouseau wishes him well, he accidentally releases the brake on Dreyfus' bed; the bed races through the hospital corridors and throws Dreyfus into the [[Seine River|Seine]], and he shouts Clouseau's name in anger as he is plunged into the river.  
The Pink Mirror

Pirates of Treasure Island
  The story opens on Skeleton Island, an uncharted island somewhere in the [[Falkland Islands]] chain, where [[Long John Silver]] ([[Lance Henriksen]]) and [[Billy Bones]] (Justin Jones) have staged a successful mutiny against [[Captain Flint]] ([[Chriss Anglin]]). The group is attacked by gigantic insects, and retreats back to the ship. In the chaos, Long John has one of his legs torn off by a giant beetle.  In the United States in 1782, [[Jim Hawkins (character)|Jim Hawkins]] ([[Tom Nagel]]) is the owner of the ''Admiral Benbow Inn'', but has grown tired of a life of monotony and seeks adventure. One of his customers, Billy Bones, dies in his inn and leaves Jim a treasure map showing the way to a treasure buried on Skeleton Island.  After gaining the help of Dr. Livesey ([[Jeff Denton]]), Jim and Livesey recruit French mariner [[Captain Alexander Smollett|Captain Smollete]] ([[James Ferris]]), the captain of the schooner ''Hispaniola'', to sail out to Skeleton Island, under the pretence of going to collect specimens of local wildlife. Jim and Livesey recruit Long John Silver, now using the alias of Barbecue, to act as ship's cook, with Long John providing the rest of the ship's crew.  As the ''Hispanola'' makes its way to the island, Hawkins unintentionally discovers Long John's true intentions: to steal the map and to hijack the ''Hispaniola'' on behalf of his own band of pirates, whom make up the ship's crew. Long John plans to stage a mutiny upon arriving at Skeleton Island, and to kill the captain, Hawkins and Dr. Livesey so that all of the treasure will belong to the pirates. However, Hawkins is discovered, along with [[Anne Bonny]] ([[Rebekah Kochan]]), who had followed Jim from the inn, and gives him protection from Long John.  On reaching Skeleton Island, the ''Hispanola'' is hijacked by Silver, with Smollette, Livesey and an American government official on the voyage kept prisoner on the ship whilst the others go ashore. With the help of marooned mariner [[Ben Gunn (Treasure Island)|Ben Gunn]] ([[Leigh Scott]]), Jim and Anne Bonney escape, and race to beat Long John and the pirates to the treasure.  
Pirates of the Great Salt Lake
 Captain Kirk Redgrave and his first mate, Flint Weaver, are two pirates who set out to be the fiercest pirates on the Great Sea ([[the Great Salt Lake]]). The movie begins with a man in white using a metal detector on the beach. He happens upon a sleeping Kirk and begins to tell the audience the legend of a young man who wanted to find his fortune. On his journey, the young man meets a [[Cartographer|mapmaker]] and ends up at a cursed mountain cave filled with treasure. While taking the riches, he is attacked by the skeleton in the cave and killed, ripping the map in his attempt to escape.  Back at the Great Sea, after  Flint and Kirk "raid" a boat, Kirk finds a map tucked into the inside of a shoe Flint fished out of the lake. The two can't help but plunder an unattended corn stall on their way to bike to the library to find the origin of the mysterious map. Once there, a librarian aids the boys by telling them "either it's real, or it's fake". She shows them a page in an encyclopedia containing the second half of the map. Unfortunately, the book is from "General Reference" and cannot be checked out, much to Kirk's irritation. While trying to tear the page out of the book, Kirk notices an unattended photo copying machine, which they use to photocopy the page and their faces. Later, Kirk becomes frustrated and throws away the map, complaining he can't decipher it because a "pirate map is only good to the pirate who made it". Flint saves the map.  While camping outside on the beach, Kirk recounts the story of how he became a pirate three weeks ago (Skulls & Crossbones in the Closet). His mother walks in on him dressed as a pirate, wearing makeup, watching pirate movies and fashioning his own sword, all while speaking in an English accent. She is disgusted and announces she is taking him to the doctor because this "perversity" is "not natural". After she says he's not a pirate, Kirk takes his leave, putting on his eyepatch and tucking in his sword. He steals a tandem bike and disappears off into the night. As he continues to talk with Flint, they come across the problem of their ship, Jolly Old St. Nick, which has a large hole in the bottom of it. Kirk maintains the ship is "hardly scratched" (Holy Ship).  The next day, while relaxing in the hot sun, Flint speaks more of the map, but he is cut off by Kirk, who notices an elderly woman and her father picnicking. They run across a large expanse of land before approaching the two picnickers, completely exhausted and out of breath. The woman congratulates Kirk and Flint on their good acting before giving them drinks and food. Kirk becomes irritated when the woman isn't intimidated by their pirate ways and walks off in exasperation. Flint explains how Captain Kirk can't eat any thing he doesn't steal, because "it's the pirate's way". While the old man complains how he hates [[Star Trek]], the woman revokes her offer with a wink before handing Flint the food and watching him run off to tell Kirk how he stole the food while her back was turned. Kirk then complains about how pirates are no longer menacing because of "that damn [[Johnny Depp]]". He admits "maybe it's time to lower the flag". Flint again mentions the map and how it could solve all their problems; they could hire a menacing, bloodthirsty crew, buy a real ship and swords and girlfriends. Kirk then claims he's been thinking about the map, and he thinks it's time to start an expedition. They plunder a child's cookie and juice stand and are chased by a mother with a newspaper. While enjoying their rewards, Flint accidentally spills juice across the map, revealing a coincidental symbol. It is identical to the symbol on the Mount Crevice Real Estate sign Flint had fished out of the lake at the beginning of the movie. After calling the number and arguing about whether the Great Salt Lake is a sea or an inland lake, Flint realizes it's not Mount Crevice Real Estate they're after, it's Mount Crevice herself.  While walking back to the beach, they pass [[McGrath's Fish House]], where Flint and Kirk first met (Eye for an Aye). Flint recounts how he met a girl named Ruby while having crab. He asks her out, but she turns him down because he's "too nice a guy". He steals her megaphone and leaves, meeting up with Kirk on his tandem bike. Kirk hands him his eyepatch as a symbol of friendship, and the two ride off together. In real time, Flint takes a moment to visit Ruby again, who comments on his sexy pirate outfit before leaving with her boyfriend.  The next day, Kirk breaks in to his own house, pretending to break a window by smashing a bottle on the ground. They raid the house, stealing everything from cold pizza to silverware to the pirate memorabilia in Kirk's room. They bring everything to a pawn shop, where they sell it for 155 dollars in store credit. While shopping, the pawn shop owner, Drake, offers to buy the treasure map for five hundred dollars cash. Just before setting off, Kirk drinks some old water that makes him sick. Flint pawns the bike for fifty dollars. After being provoked and called a fake, Flint announces the whereabouts of the boat. While shopping for food and medicine at the grocery store, Drake calls in someone to watch the store so he can go down to the lake and harass Kirk and Flint for the treasure. After receiving no answers about the whereabouts of the map, Drake shoots Kirk in the shoulder before threatening to kill him. Kirk asks to be killed by walking the plank, which Drake exasperatingly agrees to. Once entering the Great Sea, Kirk complains about the salt water entering his wound and wishes to choose a different form of death. Drake shoots him, and in a fit of rage, Flint cuts off Drake's hand, stabs his side and knocks Drake unconscious with a boot. Flint takes Kirk's dead body to the shore and begins to dig a grave.  The man in white from the beginning of the movie once again appears, to say a short proverb about death and its inevitableness. Flint sees and talks to Kirk's ghost, who convinces Flint to keep searching for the treasure. Drake, who appears to still be alive, sews back on his hand with a needle and rope. He also burns his side wound to temporarily seal it.  Later that night, Kirk and Flint talk about how they envisioned their death, and Kirk reveals his father was trampled to death by lions. Flint pulls out a letter from Kirk's mother, Catherine Lynn Redgrave, to Kirk and reads it to him. She apologizes to Kirk for her behavior and promises she will always love him, unless he becomes a convicted [[serial killer]] or a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. She warns him there is no place in [[heaven]] for pirates. Kirk and Flint speak more about whether or not there's a place in heaven for pirates, and if that's why Kirk is a ghost instead of in heaven.  Continuing on further to Mount Crevice, Flint and Kirk happen upon an old mapmaker, who appeared in the story at the very beginning of the film. He is excited to see that Flint and Kirk, who have never seen this man before, have returned. The mapmaker prints out a picture, taken "before cameras existed", of two pirates who look identical to Flint and Kirk. In a flashback (Cutthroat's Debt), it is revealed that the pirate Cutthroat Dan, Flint's [[doppelganger]], had a map made years ago, but the bill for the map was never repaid. Cutthroat stabs the mapmaker and kills his first mate, Kirk's doppelganger, before stalking off with his map. The mapmaker places a curse on the map, so that anyone who touches Cutthroat's treasure will die, and the curse can only be lifted if the debt is repaid. However, because of the rate of interest, the debt is almost four million dollars. Flint gives back the map and goes back home, where he gets rid of all his pirate [[paraphernalia]]. Flint delivers Kirk's dead body to Mrs. Redgrave before hanging up his pirate lifestyle for good. Flint goes back to the McGrath's Fish House and begins an innocent relationship with Ruby. The Fish House is visited by Detective Anderson, a detective working for Mrs. Redgrave and searching for Flint Weaver. Ruby lies and says she hasn't seen him around. Ruby goes to talk to Flint, calling him her "crab-loving bad boy", but he seems to have disappeared abruptly. Anderson also visit's Flint's grandmother, claiming Flint blew a man's brains out. This causes Flint to take "precautionary measures"; he begins wearing a fake beard and a robe.  During this time, Drake, too, happens upon the old mapmaker, where he tries to speak awful Spanish. He spies the map sticking out of a trunk with other maps, so he injures the old mapmaker and steals the map. He calls someone on the phone and talks about making a commercial. This commercial, which is advertising a treasure hunting expedition led by the Good Pirate Drake, is seen by Flint and Kirk, who are shocked that Drake is alive and has the map.  After an unsuccessful visit to Kirk's mother, Flint and Kirk are back at the old corn stand, where they are visited by the mapmaker, who can apparently see Kirk and enjoys sniffing corn. The mapmaker, now "run out of business", offers to drop the two pirates off somewhere, but they decline. After departing, the man in white appears again, with a horse, to provide an insight on how a man in search of a cursed treasure is liable to get stuck in limbo until the curse is broken. Kirk approaches the man, unaware of the audience, and asks who the man is speaking to. Flint has a revelation and takes off to the Redgrave house, where he kidnaps Mrs. Redgrave. He signs up for Drake's treasure hunting expedition under the alias Harold and Maude Hogan, and convinces Mrs. Redgrave to go along with the fiasco. Mrs. Redgrave has a flashback (Why She Hates Pirates So) of herself as a young girl on Halloween that explains why she hates pirates to much. In the flashback, she is harassed by a pirate waiter at McGarth's, attacked by teenagers in pirate costumes, and comes home to find her father dressed as a pirate and fashioning his own sword in her parents' room.  During the expedition, Drake is repeatedly injured. He is hit in the eye and has a trap caught on his leg, all while only twenty feet from his car. The only other person on the expedition, Lance, questions why Drake works in a pawn shop if he is so rich from the treasure hunting expeditions. As he realises it's all a sham, Lance accidentally rips off Drake's hand again and runs off into the forest by himself. Finally, they arrive at the treasure, and Cutthroat is discovered to also be a ghost, but a ghost only visible to Kirk. Cutthroat reveals not all of his treasure was cursed (Nosebeard's Blunder). Cutthroat's first mate, Nosebeard, bought a weak boat in an attempt to keep money for himself, which only succeeded in a box of six hundred pounds of gold bars sinking to the bottom of the Great Sea. Mrs. Redgrave also enters the cave, but she falls prey to the [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]'s call of the treasure, and she, too, dies. Drake reveals he has known Flint's true identity the whole time, and he was using Flint to lead him to the treasure. Flint stabs Drake once more, leaving Drake injured in the cave. Flint steals Drake's car and drives to McGarth's, where he picks up Ruby before driving down to the lake.  Detective Anderson, who is searching for Mrs. Redgrave, also known as the Redgrave Hostage, begins searching for them. He is at the corn stand when Flint drives by, and he follows them. Anderson confiscates a blow-up raft from a man in order to follow Flint across the lake. Once they have arrived at the opposite shore, Cutthroat's ghost and the man in white's metal detector lead Flint to the same spot he had begun to dig Kirk's grave. The man in white appears for the last time to recite a proverb about looking for what we already have. Flint digs up the gold and pulls out a few gold bars, just enough to pay the debt. Ruby begins to beat Flint with a shovel until Detective Anderson appears just in time to arrest her. While Anderson tries to arrest Flint, he is knocked out by a bar of gold. Flint delivers the rest of the gold to the mapmaker, who lifts the curse. Of course, just as the curse is lifted, Lance discovers the cave and all its treasure.  The mapmaker, after being injured by Drake, had been helped by the man in white. He also placed a curse on Drake, so Drake will forever be a pitiful pirate (The Final Curse). After this was revealed in a short flashback, Drake is seen to still be working as a pawn shop owner. He is visited by Lance, who is now extremely rich and wants to pawn off Drake's hand.  In the last scenes of the movie, Flint is walking along the beach, where he gives his eyepatch to a man watching the sea. This is a repeat of how Flint and Kirk's friendship began. The man, also played by [[Kirby Heyborne]], follows Flint onto a real ship. Flint takes Kirk's ashes from the cabinet in the hull of the ship and spreads them to the waves. At the same time, Kirk and his mother are in heaven, walking together. They come upon [[St. Peter]]. Mrs. Redgrave is led to the [[Pearly Gates]], and Kirk is led to Pirate Heaven, which is to the left.  
La piste
  When her mother died, Grace returned to live in Africa with Gary, her geologist father, whom she had not seen much of since the divorce of her parents. One day he was advised not to fly due to bad weather. As he was excited by his forthcoming re-union with his daughter, he ignored the warning and took off. The plane crashed in the desert near the [[Skeleton Coast]] and Gary  was captured by a band of guerrillas who were searching for diamond resources in the region. Police investigations were sluggish and Grace herself started an adventurous journey through the desert with a guide. [[Eriq Ebouaney]] enacted the role of the guide.  
Piranha (2006 film)
 Under the guise of a joint holiday, police agent Kirill Mazur and his colleague Olga are sent to the Siberian taiga to liquidate a chemical weapons laboratory flooded at the bottom of the lake in a territory that will soon be abandoned to neighboring China. 
Played (film)
  The story opens in Los Angeles with Dillon ([[Val Kilmer]]) who receives a phone call from Ray Burns ([[Mick Rossi]]) who has just been shot and desperately needs help. Dillon is a [[cleaner]] for a gangster named Eddie ([[Gabriel Byrne]]) and has been sent to assist Ray should he require it. After a colorful opening title sequence which follows Dillon's drive to the house, he finds Ray almost bleeding to death on a sofa. Removing all of the evidence, Dillon leaves carrying Ray to his car but not before he torches the house, destroying any evidence of Ray's presence. As Dillon and Ray drive away, Dillon struggles to keep Ray conscious and relates to him a story of a humorous encounter with a Mexican auto mechanic, which coins one of the catchphrases of the film: "I'm not gonna taco".  The story then flashes back to eight years earlier and introduces Riley ([[Patrick Bergin]]) as he admires some artwork in a London gallery. He receives a call on his cell phone from the crooked Detective Brice ([[Vinnie Jones]]), who informs Riley that there is a shipment of [[heroin]] coming in, and that he wants Riley to get a team together and steal it for him. Riley agrees to the job and tells Brice that he has just the man to do it, a petty thief named Ray Burns. Riley gives a menacing stare to the gallery attendant ([[Caspar von Winterfeldt]]) in one of the films funnier moments before leaving to meet with Ray.  After they discuss the details of the job at hand, Ray agrees to do the job and meets up with his team, which consists of Nathan ([[Sean Power (actor)|Sean Power]]) and Terry Rawlings ([[Trevor Nugent]]) son of infamous moblord Jack Rawlings ([[Roy Dotrice]]) and Terry's girlfriend, Cindy ([[Patsy Kensit]]). Together they begin plotting the heist: Nathan will go up to the roof and act as lookout while Ray and Terry break into the warehouse to steal the heroin. Unfortunately, during the heist, Nathan loses his footing and tumbles to his death, falling through a skylight and triggering an alarm, alerting the guards. Ray and Terry manage to escape with the drugs, but lose contact with each other.   Shortly thereafter, Brice calls Riley to inform him that the heist went terribly wrong, and that Nathan is dead. To cover his own tracks, he tells Riley to find a scapegoat, and Riley immediately names Ray. Meanwhile, Ray, who has gone into hiding, tries to call Terry but doesn't get an answer. He turns to Riley to find out what happened. Riley tells Ray that Nathan is dead and that Scotland Yard is looking for him, omitting the fact that Terry has handed over the drugs and that Brice is behind the whole heist. Ray decides he needs to disappear for a while and attempts to go underground, but before he can do so the police pick him up on an anonymous tip from Brice. Ray is convicted for the robbery and the manslaughter of Nathan, and is subsequently sentenced to eight years in prison.  Ray serves his time, but has no contact with the outside world, denying even his closest lover and girlfriend Maggie ([[Joanne Whalley]]) a visit. He also learns by reading the paper that Terry has died of a drug overdose. Saddened by the news, Ray vows to get revenge on Brice and Riley as soon as he is free.  While Ray is serving time, Riley and Brice continue their crooked ways, and Brice informs Riley that he has an incriminating video tape of London Charlie ([[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]]) that could be worth some cash. He dispatches Riley to Los Angeles to blackmail London Charlie. Riley arrives in Los Angeles along with his girlfriend Samantha Fay ([[Sile Bermingham]]) in order to pick up the cash from Brice. Meanwhile, Ray is released from prison and contacted by London Charlie, who realizes that the only way he can escape his dilemma is to have Riley terminated. He knows Ray is out to avenge his time in prison and so pays him $100,000 to come to Los Angeles. Brice, aware of Ray's release and suspicious that he may be up to something, instructs an underling, Danny, ([[Andy Nyman]]) to keep an eye on him and find out what he can about his plans. Danny confronts Ray in a busy London street and brings the situation to a head when he makes a comment about Ray's former girlfriend Maggie, whom Ray has not seen since he went to prison. Ray angrily headbutts Danny, telling him to leave him alone. Danny reports this back to Brice, who still believes Ray is up to something.   Ray is soon contacted by Jack Rawlings, Terry's father, who beckons him to come and visit. The two have a long talk about Terry and Ray tells Jack how sorry he is for Terry's death. Jack feigns compassion and tells Ray that he wants him to go after the guy who set them up, namely Riley, and gives him a contact in Los Angeles, Eddie, who can help him with the job. Ray is to pick up $100,000 at Jack's club from Big Frankie ([[Adam Fogerty]]) and then get on a plane to Los Angeles to hunt Riley down.  Upon arrival, Ray immediately goes to London Charlie's house (which is revealed to be the one seen in the beginning of the film) to meet with him. Ray is told that there is $100,000 in a bag that he is to take to Riley and use to recover the tape. Once he has the tape, Ray is to kill Riley and bring the tape back to London Charlie. Ray leaves and begins to cover his tracks by checking into two separate motels. He then makes a call to Eddie to pick up a car for use in Los Angeles. That night he picks up the car and meets Eddie, who is waiting for him in the back seat. Eddie tells him there is a pistol in the glove box and that he doesn't want to get involved in any of the nasty business. Ray acknowledges the request and takes off into the night.  The next day, Riley is waiting to meet with London Charlie. He is surprised by Ray, who shows up at his door carrying a bag of cash. Ray has hidden the pistol outside of the apartment and so is clean when he is frisked by Riley. The two have a heated discussion about what happened eight years ago and Riley makes light of Terry's death, much to Ray's chagrin. Ray gives the bag of cash to Riley, who angrily informs him that the amount is only half of what he and London Charlie had agreed to, and ordering him to get him the rest if he wants the tape. Ray exits the apartment, retrieves his pistol, then goes back inside and demands the tape from Riley at gunpoint. Riley refuses, and Ray shoots him once in the chest, then once in the back of the head, killing him.  Ray searches the apartment for the tape, but only finds a key to a room at a nearby hotel. Ray returns to his first hotel to wash Riley's blood off of himself before he goes to check out the other hotel. Meanwhile, police are investigating the shooting death at Riley's apartment. Detective Allen ([[Bruno Kirby]]) arrives on the crime scene and discovers that there is a link to a nearby hotel—the same hotel Ray is also heading to. Detective Bartow ([[Mark Siciliani]]) and Officer Chris Anders ([[Aaron Gallagher]]) are dispatched to investigate. At the hotel they find Samantha Fay, who is startled by their appearance. When the officers inform her that there has been an incident and they need to take her to the station to answer some questions, she reluctantly agrees. Officer Anders escorts her out, leaving Detective Bartow to search the room. Ray arrives as they are leaving, running into Bartow as he attempts to enter the room. Ray attempts to keep his cool, especially when Bartow tells him he is a police officer. He questions Ray as to how he knew Riley, and Ray innocently says they recently met and that they had arranged to grab a drink. Bartow is suspicious and asks Ray if he would have any objections to coming down to the station for some questioning. Ray has no choice but to agree, and they leave together.   At the station, Ray and Samantha are questioned for hours and hours by Detective Allen and Detective Drummond ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]). The situation is tense, and they both have a tough time keeping calm. Eventually they are both let go, but not before Samantha is told that Riley is dead. Both leave the station within a couple of hours of each other and head in different directions, Ray to pick up his things at the second motel, and Samantha to pick up the tape and a gun which Riley had left in a safety deposit box earlier that day. Samantha then heads to London Charlie's house to square things away with him and avenge Riley's death. She shoots London Charlie dead in his pool just as Ray arrives to say goodbye. Ray and Samantha have a Mexican stand-off. The now-useless tape is thrown into the pool, and Samantha slowly backs out of the house, leaving Ray to sort out the mess. As Ray sits to contemplate his next move, he doesn't notice Samantha sneaking back inside, who shoots Ray in the back. Samantha leaves and Ray is left in a pool of blood, but still alive. The scene from the film's opening replays as Ray picks up the phone to call Eddie and reaches Dillon, who comes to clean up his mess.   Dillon finally gets Ray to a secure location, and Ray pays him off so that he can return to London, where he recuperates for several days in the care of Maggie. Ray thinks quickly about what he should do when he receives a phone call from Eddie, telling him that Jack Rawlings wants to see him on the rooftop of a car-park in Chinatown later that evening. After Eddie hangs up, he anonymously calls Brice and tells him about the meeting. Brice is confused, but eager to settle the score with Ray. He calls Danny to tell him that he should follow Ray to the meeting and kill him.  While Danny circles the streets of London in an attempt to find Ray, he stumbles on Maggie and follows her back to her flat. Ray, meanwhile, is visiting with Cindy, whom he had rescued from the streets prior to his departure to Los Angeles and had given shelter to while she attempted to recover from her drug habit. Danny forces his way into Maggie's apartment and, after roughing her up, takes Ray's remaining money and returns to his place. When Ray returns, he grabs Maggie and they head over to Danny's flat. Ray breaks in and finds Nikki ([[Meredith Ostrom]]) clutching the bag of money and Danny jamming on drugs. Ray also hears a recording on Danny's answering machine of Brice telling Danny to kill him. Ray kills Danny, then takes the tapes from the answering machine and the bag of money. He and Maggie then leave to head to the rendezvous in Chinatown.   Brice arrives at Danny's place a little later after Nikki has called the police, and finds Danny dead. Brice also notices that the tapes from the machine are missing and now has no choice but to show up on the car park rooftop for the inevitable showdown.  
The Plague (2006 film)

During this state, the children experience seizures twice a day and seem to develop [[superhuman strength]]. By 1993, all the children wake up, hellbent on killing all adults. Things get even worse when the adults realize the children have a sort of [[Group mind (science fiction)|collective brain]]—what one learns, they all learn. The children get smarter by the hour, first they dismantle the engines in almost every car and set up road blocks to stop the adults from escaping. Then they learn how to use firearms. The children also take the souls of the ones they kill as a part of deliverance. The adults must find a way to stop them before it's too late.  
Playing the Victim (film)
 Valya, a 30-year-old university drop-out, works for the police acting out murder victims during reconstructions of crimes. His co-workers are a charismatic straight-edge captain, camerawoman Lyuda, and a dim-witted sergeant. At home, Valya's widowed mother has started a relationship with Valya's uncle, who considers Valya to be a "punk" and thinks he should get a normal job. At night Valya has recurring nightmares of his father, who also seems to disapprove of him.  Throughout the film we see the reconstructions taped by Lyuda (from the perspective of her camera), in which the captain has the accused recreate their actions step by step. These scenes are often riddled with absurdly comical situations that contrast the grim nature of the work being done. Valya does not seem to take anything seriously, which irritates the captain, amuses the sergeant, and infuriates his uncle/stepfather.  As the movie progresses, the strain of work causes the captain to lose his temper. This culminates in a 5-minute profane rant about the state of Russia's new generation and football team. Later on, Valya feeds poisoned Japanese food to his family and recently pregnant girlfriend. In the recreation, three other people play the victims while Valya is the accused. When asked what he did as they were dying, he says that he was taking everything in so that he could accurately reconstruct what happened. In the final scene, Valya has a flashback where his father throws him out of a rowboat to teach him to swim, an event mentioned earlier in the film by his mother.<ref></ref>  
Podokkhep
 At the end, the only love which lasts is the love that has accepted everything, every disappointment, every failure and every betrayal, which has accepted even the sad fact that in the end there is no desire as deep as the simple desire for companionship."  Inspired by this Graham Greene quote, "Podokkhep" is the story of an unusual bond between a retired man and a 5-year-old girl where he rediscovers life in his twilight years through this friendship.  
Piter FM
 Masha is a young woman working for a popular [[St. Petersburg]] radio station as a [[Disc Jockey|DJ]]. Maksim is a young man with a degree in architecture who has moved to St. Petersburg from [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and who works part-time as a street sweeper. Although Masha and Maksim have never met, they share a common trait: both have a tendency to be clumsy in daily life, always dropping and spilling things. Each is also at a crossroads in their lives. Masha is getting ready to marry her old schoolmate, Kostya, while Maksim has just won an international architecture competition and is preparing to move to Germany for a new job.   The two young people accidentally bump into each other in a crowd. Masha drops her cell phone and Maksim happens to pick it up. He wants to return it, but each time they try to meet, something happens to waylay their plans. The two keep ending up in the same places, but not knowing what the other looks like, they keep unwittingly passing by each other. In the meantime, Masha begins to realize that she is not in love with Kostya and agreeing to marry him was a rash decision on her part, while Maksim starts to think that he would rather live in St. Petersburg than move to Germany.  
Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea
 An egg belonging to the Mythical Pokémon Manaphy is found floating in the sea by mercenary Phantom the Pirate, but it is subsequently stolen from him by Jack "Jackie" Walker, a Pokémon Ranger disguised as one of Phantom's crew members. Walker escapes Phantom's ship and joins the Marina Group, a traveling circus family that specializes in Water-type Pokémon, to deliver the Manaphy egg to Samiya, an undersea palace built by the People of the Water, whom the Marina Group are descendants of. Pokémon Trainer Ash Ketchum, his Pikachu, and their friends Brock, May, and Max become lost on their journey and encounter the Marina Group in their search for water, inadvertently becoming involved with Walker's mission.  When Phantom leads an assault after the Egg, Manaphy hatches in May's arms, who presumes she is its mother. The group eventually escapes Phantom by running into a network of ruins belonging to the People of the Water, where Ash and his friends learn about Samiya. Walker declines Ash and his friends' further involvement with his mission and departs in a boat with the Marina Group toward Samiya. However, Manaphy shows discomfort and starts crying without May's presence, forcing Ash and his friends along anyway. Manaphy's natural instincts lead the boat toward Samiya, and to Walker's dismay, May and Manaphy bond closer. Walker warns May of Manaphy's destiny to become Samiya's leader and that she will eventually need to part ways with it. May understands, but is distraught nonetheless. Lizabeth, the Marina Group's daughter, comforts May and gives her a bracelet known as the People of the Water's Mark as a memento of her time with Manaphy. One day, May loses her bandanna to the wind and Manaphy embarks far into the ocean to retrieve it. Ash and his friends, board a submarine operated by Lizabeth to search for Manaphy, eventually finding it along with Samiya during the expected lunar eclipse. Unbeknownst to them, Phantom had been in pursuit the whole time.  While exploring Samiya, the group encounters Phantom, who is able to open the chamber to the Sea Crown, the temple's central artifact consisting of numerous large crystals. Phantom begins to remove the crystals, causing Samiya to flood and sink deeper into the ocean. The group escapes to the submarine while Walker confronts Phantom, reconnecting most of the crystals to the crown before he, Phantom, and one of the crystals are washed away by the flood. Determined to save its home, Manaphy returns to the Crown's chamber with Ash, Pikachu and May in tow, while Lizabeth, Brock, and Max are forced to depart in the submarine. Ash and May reconnect the remaining crystals but notice one is missing. While escaping the flood, Ash finds the last crystal in a fountain. He puts Pikachu, May, and Manaphy in an air capsule that used to be part of Phantom's submarine before diving into the completely flooded crown chamber and reconnecting the crystal, causing Samiya to rise to the ocean's surface.  While May and Pikachu mourn Ash's apparent sacrifice, Phantom appears and kidnaps Manaphy. Ash, surrounded by a glowing aura from the newly rebuilt Sea Crown, pursues Phantom and retrieves Manaphy. Phantom returns with his ship, but Manaphy leads an assault with several wild Water-type Pokémon to destroy the ship and subdue Phantom in its rubble. With Phantom arrested, Walker is able to deliver Manaphy safely to Samiya, completing his mission. May and Manaphy share a heartfelt farewell before the group watches Samiya return to depths of the ocean. Ash and his friends separate from Walker and the Marina Group and continue on their journey.

Population 436
 Steve Kady ([[Jeremy Sisto]]), a [[US Census Bureau]] researcher is sent to the remote and seemingly idyllic village of Rockwell Falls, North Dakota,<ref>License plate shown on the truck is old North Dakota base and has "Peace Garden State" at the bottom, 01m 31s into movie</ref> to interview residents concerning the population. On the way to Rockwell Falls he is distracted by a woman falling off a horse and his vehicle hits a pothole and bursts two tires. He is eventually picked up by Bobby Caine ([[Fred Durst]]), the Sheriff's Deputy, who drives him into Rockwell Falls and helps him find a place to stay.  During his stay, Kady notices a number of increasingly strange things about the town, people acting awkward, and strange. People make vague allusions to 'the fever', and several residents treat him as though he were not just a visitor, but has moved to Rockwell Falls permanently. His research reveals that the town's population has remained at exactly 436 for over 100 years. People who try to leave Rockwell Falls seem to meet with bizarre and deadly accidents, or just vanish, which the residents believe to be the work of [[God]]. Kady also begins to have eerie dreams about a truck, a cross and a doll.  Kady becomes romantically involved with Courtney Lovett ([[Charlotte Sullivan]]), a local woman and the daughter of his host, much to the chagrin of Caine, who is also in love with her. He also befriends Amanda, a young girl whose father was killed trying to escape from the town and who is being held at the clinic of Dr Greaver, the town doctor, on the pretext of treating her for [[schizophrenia]]. Courtney and Amanda both express a desire to leave the town, but are afraid of the consequences of trying.  After stumbling upon some books on Biblical numerology, Kady realizes that the townspeople attach a mystical importance to the number 436 and are willing to go to extreme lengths to keep the population at exactly that number, including executing surplus residents. Anyone who expresses a desire to leave is treated for the 'fever' by Dr. Greaver with [[electroshock therapy]] or, in extreme cases, [[frontal lobotomy]]. It gradually becomes apparent to Kady that the residents of Rockwell Falls have no intention of allowing him to leave.  After witnessing the execution of a seemingly willing woman at a town feast, Kady becomes hysterical, and is taken to the clinic to be treated for the 'fever'. He escapes from the clinic, and is sheltered by a sympathetic resident who reluctantly helps him plan his escape. After setting fire to the town garage as a diversion, Kady rescues Amanda from the clinic, but is forced to leave Courtney behind after discovering that she has been lobotomized by Dr. Greaver. As Kady and Amanda flee the town in a stolen tow-truck, a rainstorm is brewing and, after a lightning strike, the cross from his dream appears in the truck hanging from the mirror. It is followed by the doll from his dream appearing on the dashboard with the next lightning strike. While he is distracted by these, the truck veers into the path of an oncoming semi-trailer truck, killing them both.  The film ends with one of Kady's co-workers ([[Christian Potenza]]), who has come in search of him, being picked up by a police officer after his car hits the same pothole that Kady's did, blowing his tires, echoing the beginning of the film.  
Poseidon (film)
 The ''[[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]]'' [[Poseidon (fictional ship)|''Poseidon'']], a luxury [[ocean liner]], is making a [[transatlantic crossing]]. Former [[New York City]] [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] and [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] firefighter Robert Ramsey ([[Kurt Russell]]) is traveling with his daughter Jennifer ([[Emmy Rossum]]) and her boyfriend Christian ([[Mike Vogel]]) to New York, soon to be engaged. Also on board is former [[United States Navy|Navy]] submariner-turned-professional gambler Dylan Johns ([[Josh Lucas]]), [[architect]] Richard Nelson ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]), Maggie James ([[Jacinda Barrett]]) and her son Conor ([[Jimmy Bennett]]), stowaway Elena ([[Mía Maestro]]), and waiter Valentin ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]).  As the passengers are enjoying a [[New Year's Eve]] party, officers on the bridge see a huge [[rogue wave]] bearing down on the ship. To survive the wave, they try to steer the ship to take the wave bow-first, but it does not turn fast enough. The wave swamps and capsizes the ship, killing the bridge officers along with many passengers and crew. In the ballroom, a badly injured Captain Bradford ([[Andre Braugher]]) attempts to restore order and assures the surviving passengers that help is on the way, and tries to persuade them to stay put. Unconvinced, Dylan leads Conor, Maggie, Robert, Richard, and Valentin towards the bow, where he believes they will have the best chance of escaping from the capsized liner.  As they head up, they have to cross an elevator shaft, into which Valentin falls before being crushed by the falling elevator. They reunite with Jennifer, Christian, Elena, and gambler Lucky Larry ([[Kevin Dillon]]), who had all been in the [[nightclub]] section of the ship, and who are the only survivors out of all of the occupants in the nightclub. The group crosses a makeshift bridge across the lobby, where Lucky Larry gets crushed by the engine. The pressure from the water finally cracks the ballroom windows, drowning and killing its occupants, including Captain Bradford. With the water rising rapidly, the group is forced to escape through an air duct and some ballast tanks, although Elena hits her head underwater and drowns.  With the ship slowly sinking, the survivors soon find themselves in a crew lounge where they find the bow section is flooded, until an explosion of the engine room lifts it out of the water. The group enters the bow thruster room and are horrified to find the thrusters still running. With their path blocked by the propellers, and knowing that the control room is submerged in water, Robert swims away to turn off the engine. He finds the 'shut off' switch to be broken, but presses the reverse button instead, before drowning.  With the propellers now spinning in the other direction, Dylan throws a nitrogen tank into it, causing an explosion that destroys the engine, and leaving an opening for them to escape through. The group jumps out the thruster and swim to a nearby inflatable raft, and as they are getting into the raft, the ship starts to right itself. As they are paddling away, the waves push the raft further and further away from the sinking liner. Across the water, the survivors look on as the stricken ship sinks stern-first into the Atlantic. After firing a [[flare]], two helicopters and several ships arrive to rescue the six survivors, having tracked the location of the ''Poseidon'''s [[GPS]] beacon.  
Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead
  ''Poultrygeist'' follows a group of consumers and ordinary citizens who are trapped inside a [[New Jersey]] [[fried chicken]] fast food restaurant – the American Chicken Bunker – which is being attacked by a [[chicken]]-possessed [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] [[demon]]ic [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] spirit because the building is erected on top of a sacred Native American [[burial ground]]. The protagonist is Arbie ([[Jason Yachanin]]), an ACB employee trying to win back the heart of his ex-girlfriend Wendy (Kate Graham), an [[activism|activist]] protesting against the restaurant, who has left Arbie [[Lesbianism|for another woman]].  High school sweethearts Arbie and Wendy meet the day before Wendy's departure to college to consummate their relationship in the Tromahawk [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] [[burial ground]], promising to each other that no matter what happens, they will always stay faithful to each other. She is grossed out after finding a man jacking off to their lovemaking, but he's later killed by zombie hands spouting from the ground which tear through his system and out of his mouth, grabbing Arbie's underwear that he was masturbating with. One college semester later, when Arbie returns to the spot of his one and only sexual encounter, he is shocked to discover two unsettling realities: not only has the burial ground been bulldozed and replaced by an American Chicken Bunker, a mega-conglomerate [[fast food]] [[Franchising|franchise]], but college has turned his dear Wendy into a "[[Left-wing politics|leftist]], [[Lipstick lesbian|lipstick lesbo]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]", protesting the construction of the fried chicken menace with her [[Activism|activist]] girlfriend Micki (Allyson Sereboff).  Disillusioned and out for revenge, Arbie decides to get a job at the American Chicken Bunker. Under the supervision of paranoid manager Denny, Arbie is thrust into the monotony of minimum wage with a variety of colorful co-workers: the effeminate Mexican Paco Bell (Khalid Rivera), the [[Bestiality|animal-loving]] [[redneck]] Carl Jr. (Caleb Emerson), the [[burqa]]-clad [[Muslim]] Hummus (Rose Ghavami) and a mysterious 60-year-old man in the restaurant's basement who has worked as the restaurant's costumed [[mascot]] all his life and has a virtually identical background to Arbie.  However, strange things are afoot at the American Chicken Bunker. While grinding meat, Paco is pushed into the meat grinder by an uncooked chicken. General Lee Roy decides not to do anything, and lets Paco get turned into sloppy jose. Arbie begins to unravel a sinister plot involving the spirits of disenfranchised [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the billions of slaughtered chickens sent to the "concentration [[chicken coop|coops]]" who plan on exacting their revenge in the most gruesome ways possible, after being told so by Paco (who is reanimated as a sloppy jose). Carl Jr, who is having [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with an uncooked chicken in the storage room, fights the uncooked chicken when it starts biting his penis. Hummus manages to kill the uncooked chicken by shoving a broom up Carl's backside, though it tears off his penis. General Lee Roy tells them not to take him to a hospital.  He instead tells them to give the chicken (which has been sprayed with blood and green ichor) to the protester outside. Carl Jr. is killed when Arbie gives him alcohol to drink. After Mickie tells the protesters that the chicken tastes good, the protesters go inside the restaurant to eat chicken. Wendy finds out that Mickie has been paid by General Lee Roy to say that the chicken tastes good; she breaks up with Mickie and returns to Arbie. General Lee Roy gets diarrhea after being force-fed eating a piece of chicken. General Lee Roy lays an egg in the bathroom and is attacked by the chicken that hatches from the egg. He rips off the chicken's head with his teeth and is sprayed with green blood.  He becomes a giant egg and hatches into a chicken zombie. He then decapitates Denny (who is telling a story about the first time he encountered a chicken).  The customers, workers, and protesters then all turn into zombie chickens. The mascot (Lloyd Kaufman) shoots all the chicken zombies inside with an M-16 machine gun.  The General Lee Roy zombie returns, but is shot down by the mascot.  As the old man approaches the General, he gets his nose ripped off by a now zombie chicken Denny. Arbie then shoots and kills Denny. Wendy turns the open/closed sign to "closed", which keeps the chicken zombies at bay. The mascot, who is still alive, tells Arbie that he is his future self. He then turns into a chicken zombie. Mickie, who attempts to escape, is turned into a zombie chicken. She and the Mascot chicken zombie chase after Arbie and Wendy. Hummus drinks meat steroid in an attempt to save them and accidentally kills herself in the process. Arbie and Wendy realize that beer kills the chicken zombies and then kill the Mickie and mascot zombie. They run out of beer and are saved by Hummus (who is still alive, despite having exploded a few minutes earlier). They find a child hiding in the storage room and are attacked once again by the General Lee Roy chicken. It is then killed by the Paco sandwich. Hummus is then shown to have C-4 strapped to her body and tells them that she will sacrifice herself. Wendy, Arbie, and the little girl escape as the building explodes. While being driven home in a car, the child experiences stomach cramps after drinking a can of beer and eventually starts clucking like a chicken thus laying an egg, frightening her, Arbie, and Wendy. The guys eventually lose control and crash, resulting in the car back-flipping before landing on the ground and exploding, thus killing all inside.  In a post-credits scene, the zombified chickens are shown dancing as a reprise of the ''Poultrygeist'' theme song plays.

The Possible
 In 1969 in [[Thailand]], The Possible are the most popular band. But the fame has caused the band members to have big [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]s. They ignore their fans. The lead singer, Toi, is cavorting with a [[farang]] woman, and is caught by his Thai girlfriend, Straw.  One day, on the way to a concert, Toi finds a present that has been given to the band by a fan. It is a pink [[microphone]] called a "Hit Tester". He tries it out at first at another show being given by an upstart rival band, [[The Impossibles (Thai band)|The Impossibles]], singing vulgar lyrics as they play one of their hit songs and disrupting the gig.

With the energy ample, the pink microphone is able to function and transport The Possible back to 1969, where, having seen the error of their ways, the band members reform their personal habits and embark on a career that concentrates on their talents, rather than fame, which will ensure their place as one of the legends of the Thai rock music scene.

Porn of the Dead
  ''Porn of the Dead'' has no overarching plot or storyline; instead it consists of five unconnected sequences which depict people having [[Necrophilia|sex with the undead]] in a world which appears to be experiencing the onset of a [[zombie]] plague.  The film begins with a man finding a dazed, emaciated, and filth-encrusted woman in a waitress's uniform stumbling down a road. The man forces the woman into his car, and takes her to a house, where he strangles her in a pit full of plastic, newspapers, and body parts. The killer leaves to get a protective suit and an axe, and when he returns he finds nothing but the woman's discarded clothing in the hole. As the man scours pit in confusion, the now undead woman reappears, and attacks him, ripping off his gear, and performing [[fellatio]] on him. The man and the zombie have rough sex, which ends when the zombie bites the man's penis off, resulting in her being "[[Facial (sex act)|facialized]]" by blood.  A girl is then shown in her bedroom, masturbating with a toy while fantasizing about being intimate with a male zombie. The girl and the zombie have sex, and the daydream concludes when the girl has an orgasm in real life. Out in the woods, a group of people are in the middle of filming a porno, when three naked male zombies crash the set. The cast and crew members are either killed (one has his heart ripped out and eaten in front of him) or scared off, leaving the female star of the film to be [[Gang bang|gangbanged]] by the ghouls. In a [[morgue]], an employee places a female body on a table, and begins molesting it. The corpse eventually reanimates as a zombie, which the attendant has sex with.   At a [[psychiatric hospital]], an orderly enters a room covered in drawings of [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses]], and discovers the female resident lying on the floor, having seemingly killed herself via self-induced head trauma. The orderly removes the patient's [[straitjacket]], and decides to have sex with the body before alerting anyone about the suicide. The girl returns to life as a zombie mid-coitus, and bites one of the orderly's fingertips off, angering him, and prompting him to get rough. After the orderly ejaculates, the zombie rips his innards out with her teeth, and gnaws on them as the man expires.

Caldlow reveals that he is Angier and Borden begs for his life, but Angier ignores him. When Cutter realises that Angier is still alive, he is disgusted that he allowed Borden to be sentenced, but agrees to help him dispose of Tesla's machine. Borden is hanged for Angier's murder as Cutter and Angier watch.   A stranger enters the theater and shoots Angier. He reveals himself as Fallon, Borden's twin brother; he and Borden shared the Borden identity and performed the original Transported Man together.

Finally, he tells Kaidoh he has their opponents' data and they win the match 7-5. Kawamura plays Singles 3 and tries his Hadokyuu, but his big opponent copies the move. They both keep using Hadokyuu until Kawamura does the unthinkable: the dangerous one-handed Hadokyuu.

Tezuka continues to play as Echizen takes off his jacket, revealing his Seigaku uniform, and goes to practice. Tezuka loses in the tiebreak, 6-7.

Remembering his vow to become stronger, Echizen surprises everyone by using the COOL Drive attack to come back, break the eclipse, and won. Shioin finally cheers.

They forget the coins in Larry's car, and in a panic they run from the bus station with the money, with Ice Killa chasing them.  They go back to Big Daddy's, where Ice Killa, who has a great [[fear of dogs]], is chased up a tree by Big Daddy's trained guard dog.  Larry, Rico, and Big Daddy then find out that Elise and Ice Killa were trying to steal the coins.

The Pursuit of Happyness
 In 1981, San Francisco salesman Chris Gardner invests his entire life savings in portable [[bone density]] scanners, which he demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy [[Paradigm shift|quantum leap]] over standard [[X-ray]]s. The scanners play a vital role in his life. While he is able to sell most of them, the time lag between the sales and his growing financial demands enrage his already bitter and alienated wife Linda, who works as a hotel maid. The financial instability increasingly erodes their marriage, in spite of them caring for Christopher Jr., their soon-to-be five-year-old son.  While Chris is trying to sell one of the scanners, he meets Jay Twistle, a manager for [[Dean Witter Reynolds]], and impresses him by solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] during a taxi ride. After Jay leaves, Gardner lacks money to pay the fare and chooses to run instead, causing the driver to angrily chase him into a [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station. Gardner boards a train but loses one of his scanners in the process. His new relationship with Jay earns him the chance to become an intern stockbroker. The day before the interview, Gardner grudgingly agrees to paint his apartment so as to postpone [[eviction|being evicted]] due to his difficulty in paying the rent. While painting, Gardner is greeted by two policemen at his doorstep, who take him to the station, stating he has to pay for the numerous parking tickets he has accumulated. As part of the sanction, Gardner is ordered to spend the night in jail instead, complicating his schedule for the interview the next morning. He manages to arrive at Dean Witter's office on time, albeit still in his shabby clothes. Despite his appearance, he impresses the interviewers and lands an unpaid internship. He would be amongst 20 interns competing for a paid position as a stockbroker.  Gardner's unpaid internship does not please Linda, who eventually leaves for New York City because she might get a job at her sister's boyfriend's new restaurant. After Gardner bluntly says she is incapable of being a single mom, she agrees that Christopher Jr. will remain with his dad. Gardner is further set back when his bank account is [[garnishment|garnished]] by the [[IRS]] for unpaid income taxes, and he and Christopher are evicted. He ends up with less than $22, resulting in them being homeless, and they are forced at one point to stay in a restroom at a BART station. Other days, he and Christopher spend nights at a [[homeless shelter]], in BART, or, if he manages to procure sufficient cash, at a hotel. Later, Gardner finds the bone scanner that he lost in the BART station earlier and, after repairing it, sells it to a physician, thus completing all his sales of his scanners.  Disadvantaged by his limited work hours, and knowing that maximizing his client contacts and profits is the only way to earn the broker position, Gardner develops a number of ways to make phone sales calls more efficiently, including reaching out to potential high-value customers, defying protocol. One sympathetic prospect who is a top-level pension fund manager even takes Chris and Christopher to a [[San Francisco 49ers]] game. Regardless of his challenges, he never reveals his lowly circumstances to his colleagues, even going so far as to lend one of his bosses $5 for cab fare, a sum that he cannot afford. Concluding his internship, Gardner is called into a meeting with his managers. One of them notes he is wearing a shirt. Gardner explains it is his last day and thought to dress for the occasion. The manager smiles and says he should wear another one tomorrow, letting him know that he has won the coveted full-time position and giving him back his $5 as he promised. Fighting back tears, Gardner shakes hands with them, then rushes to his son's daycare to embrace Christopher. They walk down the street, joking with each other (and are passed by the real Chris Gardner, in a business suit). The epilogue reveals that Gardner went on to form his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm.

Mattie and her friends begin to receive online messages from Josh asking for help but assume that Josh's computer is still on and that a [[Computer virus|virus]] is creating the messages. Mattie learns that Josh's computer has been sold to Dex McCarthy ([[Ian Somerhalder]]), who finds a number of strange videos on the computer. Mattie receives a package that Josh mailed two days prior to his death. Inside are rolls of red tape and a message telling her that the tape keeps "them" out, although he does not know why. Later, Dex visits Mattie and shows her video messages Josh was sending to Ziegler. Josh had hacked Ziegler's computer system and then distributed a virus. This virus had unlocked a portal that connected the realm of the living to the realm of the dead. Josh believed he had coded a counter to the virus and wanted to meet Ziegler at the library. Josh's counter-program is found on a [[USB flash drive|memory stick]] taped inside the PC case with red tape.  Dex and Mattie visit Ziegler and find his room entirely plastered in red tape. They believe the red tape keeps the spirits out. Ziegler tells them of a project he worked on where he found "frequencies no one knew existed." Opening these frequencies somehow allowed the spirits to travel to the world of the living. Ziegler also tells them that these spirits "take away your will to live" and where to find the main server infected with the virus.  Dex and Mattie find the server and upload Josh's fix, causing the system to crash and the spirits to vanish. Moments later, however, the system reboots and the spirits return leaving Mattie and Dex with no option but to flee the city by car. Over the car radio, Mattie and Dex hear a report from the Army announcing the location of several "safe zones" where there are no Internet connections, cell phones, or televisions. As Dex and Mattie drive to a safe zone, the film concludes with a [[voice-over]] from Mattie saying "We can never go back. The cities are theirs. Our lives are different now. What was meant to connect us to one another instead connected us to forces that we could have never imagined. The world we knew is gone, but the will to live never dies. Not for us, and not for them." Clips of abandoned cities are shown, including a window of an apartment with Josh looking through it.

Purple Heart (film)
 The film is the story of Sgt. Oscar Padilla, member of an elite military unit designed for covert operations. His first mission: assassinate [[Saddam Hussein]] prior to the beginning of the 2003 [[Iraq War]]. Unfortunately the mission is compromised; Padilla is captured and tortured by the Iraqis. Later, Padilla is rescued, but is severely damaged by his ordeal. Back in the [[United States]], he escapes from the lock down ward of the military hospital where he is being treated. Given what he knows about the illegal attempt at political assassination, he is considered dangerous. As the leader of the unit that trained Padilla, Colonel Allen is sent with specific orders to go find him and "solve the problem" permanently. Allen intends to convince Padilla to come back. As it turns out, there was no real-life mission at all: it was the final, most severe training exercise that broke Padilla's soul – and mind. The film raises questions about the moral obligations of the use of military power, and the methods that the U.S. uses to train and ultimately sacrifice its own soldiers.

Upon their arrival, one of the criminals, whose name is Ryu, enters the warehouse to discover, to his horror, that the man in which they were supposed to pass the bonds off to now is a charcoaled corpse lying in the middle of the floor. The other three criminals enter as well and are shocked as well at the sight.   Questions begin to arise: what is their next plan of action? Do they wait until the mysterious man who hired them arrives, whom none of the criminals have met? Do they simply split the bonds and make a run for it? But soon the questions give way to accusations as the criminals begin to turn on one another, suspecting that one of them may, in fact, be the very man who hired them, and who must have set ablaze the now smoldering corpse.

After a few unsuccessful auditions in search of the actors, Sue finally casts Sonia's friends, four young men&nbsp;– Daljit "DJ" Singh ([[Aamir Khan]]), Karan Singhania ([[Siddharth Narayan]]), Aslam Khan ([[Kunal Kapoor]]) and Sukhi Ram ([[Sharman Joshi]])&nbsp;– to portray the revolutionaries.  Though they aren't very enthusiastic at the idea of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey ([[Atul Kulkarni]]), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realise that their own lives are quite similar to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.  Meanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod ([[R. Madhavan]]), a [[flight lieutenant]] in the [[Indian Air Force]] who is Sonia's fiancé, is killed when his jet, a [[Mikoyan MiG-21|MiG-21]], crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, they claim that he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives that would have been lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt [[defence minister]] Shastri ([[Mohan Agashe]]), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organising the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania ([[Anupam Kher]]).  Angered by the situation, the group and their supporters decide to protest peacefully at [[India Gate]], a [[war memorial]] in [[New Delhi]]. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother ([[Waheeda Rehman]]) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister is reported to have been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the [[All India Radio]] station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight. The first to be shot is Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable to control his anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying to lock the terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a [[grenade]] and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of [[Ram Prasad Bismil]] and [[Ashfaqulla Khan|Ashfaqullah Khan]].  Daljit manages to crawl to the recording room, where Karan is still on air. When Karan understands that he has been shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her. They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.  The film comes to an end with Sue describing the impact of the boys on her life. As she and Sonia watch from the rooftop that Ajay proposed to her on, they have a vision of the boys running in the fields, singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air, acting as if they are celebrating life itself, as if the ebb of their once-there vitality still reverberates in the places where they once used to go, and a wave of melancholy comes over the two surviving women.  In an afterlife-like state, the boys watch as a father tells his son (a young Bhagat Singh) about gardening. They watch over him with smiling faces, then depart as friends for eternity.

Re-Animated
 Jimmy Roberts ([[Dominic Janes]]) is a 12-year-old boy who can't seem to say "no" to anybody, and as a result, ends up getting taken advantage of on a regular basis, even by his best friend Craig (Micah Karns). This problem continues during his class trip to Gollyworld, where he misses out on many of the rides because Craig tells the popular kids that Jimmy will hold their items for them. The popular kids then, on Craig's suggestion, tell Jimmy to go try to find [[Fred Willard|Milt Appleday]]'s frozen brain, which supposedly is hidden somewhere in Tux's Arctic Adventure. As usual, Jimmy unwillingly gives in, and once there, bumps into Milt's middle-age clumsy son Sonny ([[Matt Knudsen]]), who is attempting to retrieve the brain from underneath the ice. After being spotted by Sonny, Jimmy quickly flees and during his escape, accidentally runs onto the path of an oncoming train and is sent to an on-premises hospital staffed by park staff who are also secretly certified physicians, where Milt's brain (which one of the doctors keeps in his lunch cooler) is transplanted into his head. He makes it out of the operation just fine with his personality intact (explained by the doctors salvaging his "personality gland") but, he can now see all of Appleday's characters in real life, while no one else can.  With the help of his crush, Robin ([[Eunice Cho]]), who is also Craig's sister, Jimmy and the characters learn that the reason they've lost their popularity is thanks to Sonny, who unwittingly ruined their cartoons through his own ideas, especially Golly who is crushed to learn that his top spot as most popular cartoon character in the world has been reduced to nothing, but he figures with Jimmy now at the helm, he can quickly make him a star again. Now that he's president of Appleday Pictures. Sonny was fired by the Chairman of the Board, Jimmy is immensely popular, but no longer has time for school or his friends.  Meanwhile, Sonny has rented out a room in Jimmy's house and now lives with his family because Jimmy's dad allows him when it is obvious that Sonny is deceiving the family. Sonny has dinner with them and meets Jimmy's alien sister, Yancy (Rhea Lando), all the while constantly scheming to get Milt's brain out of Jimmy's head and for himself. And without the brain, Jimmy would die. He devises a plan to modify Crocco's train to include several dangerous devices on it that will decapitate Jimmy and get him what he wants. However, he says this plan out loud (yelling it at the top of his lungs) and Yancy catches on.  Eventually, Robin attempts to point out to Jimmy that the cartoons are walking all over him just like everybody else used to, but he denies this, adding that the only reason Robin even liked him was because of him having Milt's brain. He takes off for his television debut, leaving her behind to encounter Sonny, who says that since she knows his plan, he'll have to do away with her. At the studio, Jimmy tells the ego-maniac Golly that all that the Presidency of Appleday Studios has gotten him isn't what he really wanted, which drives Golly to get angry at him and shout at him that it is impossible for him to say no to anybody. Jimmy finally realizes Robin was right and denounces his position as President on-air. Sonny, however, still wants the brain, and has tied Robin down to the train tracks, forcing Jimmy and the characters (even Golly who apologizes along the way) to go save her. Golly temporarily changes Jimmy into a cartoon "Knight in shining armor".  Robin is saved from being run over after Jimmy goes inside the train and destroys the engine. Sonny's plan is foiled. Jimmy dresses up as Milt to hide from Sonny, and Sonny is momentarily distracted by his affection for his father. Yancy saves Jimmy just in time by using her power of teleportation. Robin and Jimmy return to Craig's house, where he was planning to throw a party with Jimmy as the guest of honor, and everything is patched up between them. However, since the partygoers were watching the show he was on, and saw him talk about the importance of friendship, they figured Jimmy wasn't cool, and instead just stupid at giving up all that fame, and leave the party.  In an epilogue, Jimmy is leaving for school. Sonny still wants the brain and is seen hiding behind a curtain. He has a device that can grab his head. Sonny almost succeeds, but the crane misses its target. He laughs evilly in the end, with Yancy telling him to shut up.  ==="Golly Gopher: Hero in Train-ing"=== It is an exclusive animated short produced by [[Renegade Animation]], imaginarily credited as Appleday Studios, which is included as a bonus on ''Re-Animated'' DVD; an extract was shown in the movie itself but only after the intro.

Renaissance (film)
 The film opens in a future Paris with scenes establishing the kidnapping of 22-year-old scientist Ilona Tasuiev, who works for the [[megacorporation]] Avalon. The focus transitions to police captain Barthélémy Karas, as he defuses a hostage situation by killing the hostage-takers. Afterwards Karas is given the job of solving the mystery surrounding Ilona's disappearance. Karas begins by contacting Dr. Jonas Muller, a former Avalon scientist familiar with her.  Muller had been working to cure [[progeria]], a genetic condition which affected his brother. Muller worked for Avalon as their top scientist but left after he failed to find a cure and his brother died. He took up new work at a free clinic. Muller tells Karas that "No one ever leaves Avalon", throwing the corporation under suspicion. Karas visits Paul Dellenbach, one of Avalon's CEOs and questions him about Ilona. On suggesting he may have been sleeping with her, Dellenbach replies "I sleep with my wife, I sleep with my secretary, I even sleep with my sister-in-law but I would never sleep with one of my researchers".  After following a series of dead ends, control tells Karas they are tailing Illona's car through Paris. Eventually he captures the driver after a chase which ends at the [[Eiffel Tower]]. The man turns out to be a henchmen of Farfella, an Arab Muslim mobster and a childhood friend of Karas. The police captain returns the criminal to Farfella who in return gives him security footage of Illona's kidnapping; it shows her car being stolen by an incredibly old man.  Karas asks Ilona's sister, Bislane, who works for Avalon to break into the company's Archives to discover what Muller was researching. The sister discovers that a Dr. Nakata worked with Muller in a quest to find a cure for progeria. But they destroyed all evidence of their work when some of the children they were testing on started to mutate. Karas and Bislane then escape because accessing the closed file has alerted Avalon security.  Later Karas opens up to Bislane and tells her that he and Farfella were raised in the [[casbah]] where they worked with gangs. After a drug run went wrong, they ended up in a holding cell. Farfella escaped but Karas was left to the mercy of the other gang. Karas puts Bislane under false arrest to protect her from Avalon. Meanwhile, Ilona is shown confined in a cyber ball which is being controlled by the old man.  Eventually Karas tracks down Muller. He explains that he took Ilona because through her research she has discovered the secret to eternal life (as he himself did 40 years ago); but knowing what the consequences would be if Avalon acquired such knowledge, he kidnapped her. Karas tries to encourage the old scientist to hand himself in but Muller is mistakenly shot by a police marksman. Karas then deduces that the mysterious old man is Muller's younger brother: now immortal but trapped in an elderly body.  Karas calls on Farfella who hides Bislane from Avalon while also getting a fake passport for Ilona. However the mega-corporation's security are also closing in on the Parisian sewer where Ilona is being held captive. After a short battle, Karas is mortally wounded rescuing Ilona. However she refuses to take the fake passport to start a new life. Instead she tells Karas she wants immortality by giving her discovery to Avalon. Reluctantly Karas shoots her in the back as she walks back towards Avalon security. CEO Dellenbach watches all this happen through a live feed from one of his men's helmet camera.  As Karas lies mortally injured from a gunshot wound, he imagines himself apologising to Bislane for killing her sister for which she forgives him. The film closes with Muller's little brother living as a tramp, throwing his picture of him and his brother into a burning bin. The final scene shows an advert for Avalon with an old woman becoming young again saying, "With Avalon, I know I'm beautiful and I'm going to stay that way."  
Rendu
 Shakti ([[R. Madhavan|Madhavan]]) is a young man from a village with no job but much ambition and dreams. As he sees his life pass him by, stuck in a rut in his hometown, he decides that he will try his fortunes elsewhere. Chennai beckons him and off goes Shakti to join his uncle Kirikalam ([[Vadivelu]]), who has a stall of magic tricks at an exhibition. Kirikalam is not really a [[Illusionist|magician]], but is posing as one, and his amateurish tricks don't exactly bring in big [[crowds]].  Next door to Shakti and Kirikalam's stall though, is one ever-populated with visitors. The reason: it's an all-girls stand, with [[mermaid]] costumes as the theme. Velli ([[Reema Sen]]) is the 'head mermaid' at this stall run by her sister, and bitter quarrels between her and Shakti ensue, when he feels that she and her team are unfairly taking their customers away, and she has this impression of him being an unsavory character. This misunderstanding is seen at different occasions where Velli and Shakti just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time&nbsp;— be it when Shakti gets off the bus from his village, asks for directions and is told to follow Velli, walking in the distance (Velli thinks he's a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womaniser]]) or when Shakti finally catches up with a miscreant who had picked his pocket and demands his money back — only Velli walks into the scene only at the demanding part. This whole [[collage]] of scenes is animated, with Kirikalam and Shakti trying to woo customers back to their stall, Shakti and Velli getting into arguments, and a general state of "fun" ruckus. Of course, love has been brewing as an undercurrent between the two young people.  The [[exhibition]] grounds owner ([[Manivannan]]) keeps harassing Velli under some pretext or the other, like the rent not being paid on time. In fact, he has a soft spot for her, feelings thoroughly rejected by her. He finally abducts her, but Shakti rescues her. Similarly, Velli's plight is repeated when her "mora maapillai" (betrothed suitor) enters the scene and tries to force her to be with him, and Shakti steps in once again to save and protect Velli. The undercurrents of love blow up into a full-fledged torrent, and Velli and Shakti make up for all of their lost time professing their love for each other and romancing their way happily through the exhibition.  Meanwhile, we see a series of murders in different towns of the state and two perpetrators of these crimes slinking away from each. Not every time is it [[Idiot proof|foolproof]] though, and at one crime scene, a witness spots the main culprit. He is instructed by the police to sketch and give them a pictorial description of the murderer, when it comes to the police's knowledge that both the criminals have been seen at [[Kumbakonam]] some time ago. Going through various fact files, the police come across the incident of a bad fire at a marriage hall in Kumbakonam ,and as the officer in charge of the investigation ([[K. Bhagyaraj|Bhagyaraj]]) flips through the picture files of the deceased, Kannan's (Madhavan&nbsp;— the 2nd) face is shown, and the witness jumps. He tells the police he doesn't need to sketch anything when the face of the main murderer itself is staring them in the eye&nbsp;— he points to the photo of Kannan - it is the face of Shakti, only this one has light eyes. Investigations into the murder lead the police to Chennai. As luck would have it, Shakti is spotted, recognized, and arrested. Kannan, on the other hand, follows the murder investigation and is upset to find that an innocent man has been captured for crimes he has committed. He meets Kirikalam and Velli and plots to help Shakti get out. And so he does, and Shakti and he escape by the skin of their teeth. After much chase-and-hide, Kannan tells the story of what led him to murder all those people.  Kannan, his elder brother, and his father were renowned caterers and were commissioned to cook for a marriage function in Kumbakonam. The host was Kannan's father's friend and this gentleman's daughter Manjula ([[Nikita Aria|Nikita Palekar]]) was going to be married in a joyous ceremony. There, Kannan meets Jyoti ([[Anushka Shetty|Anushka]]) and falls in love instantly. At first he panics that Jyoti is the bride at the function but is vastly relieved when he finds out she is not. She really likes Kannan too and it all seems like Wonderland. Unfortunately, the groom creates trouble at the wedding and walks out, leaving the family distraught and desperate. Suddenly Kannan makes a suggestion, "Father, this is our friend's wedding and the bride is a wonderful girl. Why can't Anna (elder brother) marry her?" A brilliant idea and it is decided - only fate has to fell her axe right then, when all hell breaks loose and a raging fire attacks the marriage house. The father of the bride is a good man, and a dignitary in the town of Kumbakonam. He comes to know that a bunch of powerful thugs and gang leaders have sold a large piece of government property to a north Indian businessman, completely illegally at exorbitant prices, with no gain for the townspeople themselves. He strongly opposes them and all their mischief comes to public notice and foils their plans. They want his blood as revenge.  They set fire to the building of the wedding and kill every single inmate inside&nbsp;— but two people escape, Kannan and his friend. Kannan, whose light eyes are a result of the fire (he walks with help and not very clear sight) is heartbroken and devastated at the loss of his entire family and lady love at what was to be a joyous, happy occasion. He vows retribution on the villains and sets about cold-bloodedly fulfilling this. Shakti decides to help Kannan achieve his revenge with the help of Velli and Kirikalan. At the end, however, Kannan sacrifices his own life to kill the final baddie, and he reunites with his family and lady love in heaven.

They follow him home and cause chaos to his normal life. There are frequent references to the movie ''[[Mother, Jugs & Speed]]'' used by the characters in the film.  
Reprise (film)
 Two 23-year-olds, Erik and Phillip, dream of becoming successful writers. They idolize the reclusive writer Sten Egil Dahl (a character modelled on [[Tor Ulven]]<ref></ref>). When they both try to get a manuscript published, Erik's is rejected. Phillip's, on the other hand, is accepted and he becomes a star of the Norwegian literary scene overnight. Phillip meets Kari, with whom he falls in love after inviting her on a trip to Paris. Six months later, Erik and his friends pick up Phillip at a psychiatric hospital to bring him home after a long treatment for his psychosis that was triggered by his obsessive love for Kari. Erik still hasn't given up his dream, but Phillip isn't able to write anymore, although his friend encourages him to make a new effort. Instead Phillip tries to get his ruined relationship with Kari to start over again from the beginning by asking her to return with him to Paris in a futile attempt to replicate their first trip. But once Philip realizes he doesn't love Kari anymore, they go their separate ways.  Meanwhile, Erik's revised manuscript gets published, but is met with poor reviews, and his girlfriend dumps him for neglecting her. The same day, Philip asks Erik to read his new writing and give feedback. Erik is honest and tells Philip it isn't his best work, needs improvements, but has potential, and he's glad Philip has started writing again. Philip lacks confidence in his writing, saying it's just recycled Dahl and Ulven, and is upset with Erik because he believes Erik is just trying to avoid hurting his feelings with nice comments. After Philip also calls Erik's novel recycled Dahl, Erik angrily leaves. Disgruntled by these events, Erik expresses his anger by kicking some parked vehicles and gets knocked out by one of their owners. He then goes to a park, only to be knocked out again by Sten Egil Dahl's dog. Erik wakes up in Dahl's home, and Dahl provides Erik with constructive feedback on his writing, including insights on how to write more authentically. This renews Erik's self-confidence, while prompting him to realize he must get out of Oslo to become a successful writer. Meanwhile, Philip, regretting his mistakes with Kari, goes to her workplace and tells her that he loves her and their love was always meant to be. But when Kari responds that she can take no more, he collapses on the floor. Erik goes to visit Philip at the hospital, but decides against meeting with him.  Erik moves to Paris without saying any goodbyes and imagines a succession of future events: he writes a second novel, which is a huge success back in Norway; after a year of living abroad, he decides to return home for a friend's wedding and reunites with his friends, including Philip, who is together with Kari again; Philip tells Erik he and Kari are happy and he likes his new book; Philip says he is most likely not going to write again, unless "the spirit will move him again"; Philip's comments inspire Erik to continue work on his next novel; Erik flies back to Paris.  
The Remake
  In the middle of the night, Harold Dingle, the owner of a website dedicated to [[slasher film]]s who has been hired on to Perimount Production's upcoming remake of the [[Cult film|cult classic]] ''Slaughter Camp 13'', has his throat slit by a hooded assailant.  The next day, the crew of the ''Slaughter Camp 13'' remake head out to the shooting location early, as a part of a bonding exercise. The group are followed by Harold's killer, who had murdered and carjacked the clerk of a store the crew stopped at. After the group reach their destination and set up, the killer spies on them, garrots Kevin with a cable when he goes off for some solitude, and impales Ron with a pipe while he is using the outhouse. By nightfall, the other crew members become worried about Kevin and Ron, so they pair off and go in search of them. After becoming separated from his search buddy Tom, Ari is hacked in the face with a machete by the killer. The next to die is Amy, who is forced to ingest cleaning chemicals when she wanders off alone to snort cocaine.  Back at the campsite, Marco and Sally Anne (who had stayed behind in case Kevin or Ron came back) are stabbed to death with a pole while having sex in their tent. Their bodies are found Seanna, Adrienne, and Peter, who cannot get any cell phone reception, or drive away because all the vehicles have been sabotaged. The trio decide to go to the camp tool shed to see if it has anything that can fix the cars, and are beaten there by Tom, who is beheaded with a shovel by the killer. Moments later, the remaining crew members arrive, with Peter gathering up supplies and heading back to the cars alone, instructing Adrienne and Seanna to stay behind and barricade themselves in the shed. When Peter returns to the vehicles and tries one after tinkering with it, he is knocked out by the killer, who was hiding in the backseat.  Seanna becomes hysterical and runs back to the campsite, where the killer ambushes her, burns her face on the gas grill, and jams [[kebab]] sticks down her throat. Adrienne goes after Seanna, and sees what looks the killer seated on a log at the campsite. She attacks the figure with an axe, only to discover that it was a bound and gagged Peter. The blood splattered killer then appears and beheads Adrienne. Afterward, he turns to a hidden camera and proclaims, "No more fucking remakes!" The killer sends the tape to Steve Lehman, a Perimount Pictures executive, who calls the studio and orders that production of ''Slaughter Camp 13'' be halted.  Twenty-eight days later, the killer reads an announcement on the internet that another classic slasher, ''The Babysitter Murders'', is being remade. Enraged, the killer opens a trunk full of horror film memorabilia, grabs replicas of [[Michael Myers (character)|Michael Myers]]'s mask and knife, and heads out.  
Rescue Dawn
 In February 1966, while on a combat mission, Lt. [[Dieter Dengler]], a German-born [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] pilot in squadron [[VA-145 (U.S. Navy)|VA-145]], flying from the carrier [[USS Ranger (CV-61)|USS ''Ranger'']], is shot down in his [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider]] over Laos. He survives the crash, only to be captured by the [[Pathet Lao]]. Dengler is offered leniency by the province governor, if he will sign a document condemning America, but he refuses. Dengler is tortured and taken to a prison camp. There he meets his fellow prisoners: American pilots [[Eugene DeBruin|Gene DeBruin]] and [[Duane W. Martin]], Y.C., Procet and Phisit, some of whom have been captives for years.  Dengler immediately plans to escape, but receives only grudging approval from the others. All are suffering from malnutrition, unhygienic conditions and abuse by the guards. After some months the food supply worsens further, and they learn that the starving guards are planning to kill them and return to their village, so the prisoners agree to put the long-prepared plan into action. This involves escaping through a weakened place in the perimeter fence, dividing into two groups, circling the perimeter fence in opposite directions, converging on the guard hut during the lunch hour to overwhelm the guards, and contacting the American forces for rescue.  Due to one party of prisoners disobeying Dengler's orders, the escape does not go to plan and nearly all the guards end up being shot. With insufficient equipment and supplies, the prisoners disperse in the jungle. Dengler and Martin form one group, while Gene and Y.C. leave together to an uncertain fate.  Dengler and Martin try to reach the [[Mekong River]] to cross over into Thailand, fashioning a crude raft, but are caught in rapids and a waterfall. After losing their raft, Dengler and Martin are soon found by a mob of angry villagers, who kill Martin. Dengler escapes and flees back into the jungle, hiding from the pursuing villagers. A few days later, he is rescued by an American helicopter. Back at the U.S. compound he is taken to, Dengler is kept isolated in a hospital for debriefing due to the classified nature of his mission. He is visited by some of the men from his squadron, who covertly take him back to his ship, where he is welcomed as a hero by the crew.  
Rest Stop (film)
  Jess picks up his girlfriend, Nicole, in his convertible to head out to California. On the way, Nicole complains she needs to urinate and she urges Jess to find a rest stop. After she exits the building she finds her boyfriend gone. A deranged truck driver with license plate KZL-303 throws her the red cell phone that was in the convertible, convincing her he has Jess. Nicole goes to look for help and notices an [[recreational vehicle|RV]] and bangs on the door and asks for help. She has a short eerie ride with the passengers until she is eventually thrown out for looking at the deformed individual hidden behind curtains at the back of the vehicle.  She then returns to the restroom where she hears a girl coughing up blood (Tracy) with cuts all over whimpering in the maintenance room.  She cautions Nicole about the deranged killer who tortured her. The girl then bleeds profusely and as Nicole's attention is diverted she disappears, blood and all. Nicole finds Tracy's missing person poster and discovers the girl has been missing since 1971.  The man in the yellow truck continues to elude Nicole, until a cop arrives via motorcycle. The cop soon falls victim to the driver of the yellow truck by being run over. The officer's legs are run over repeatedly and injured severely in the process.  Nicole is able to drag the officer to the rest room, where the two seek refuge from the psychopath. Eventually, the driver of the truck returns and locks Nicole and the officer in the restroom. Nicole, thinking the man has left, attempts to open the lock. The driver appears out of seemingly nowhere, and bites Nicole's finger off. The officer realizes that Nicole is going into shock and commands Nicole to shoot the driver when he returns. She fires four shots out of the officer's revolver into the door but is unable to see if she has struck the driver. The driver then drops a camera into the restroom via the open window. The video is of Jess being tortured with a knife. The last shot of Jess shows him having his tongue cut out. The driver feeds a hose through the window and starts pouring gasoline into the room. Nicole tries to find an escape and is able to open a hatch in the ceiling. Realizing there is no way for her to get him out of the building the officer tells Nicole to use the two remaining bullets in his gun to kill him because he would rather die that way than be burned alive. She fails at first but eventually succeeds in the grisly task. The driver lights the gasoline and Nicole hurries to get out of the building. As Nicole is escaping she notices that the officer's body has mysteriously disappeared. Nicole is able to jump from the roof before the building explodes.  Once she is on the ground Nicole encounters the man in the yellow truck once again.  He exits the truck, and she sneaks up behind him, striking him with a tire iron repeatedly. She turns him over and is shocked to discover it is actually Jess, with his mouth sewn shut, sporting other visible wounds. Nicole sneaks to the convertible where she fills a whiskey bottle that she had retrieved from a nearby Park Ranger's station and fills it with gasoline in order to concoct a makeshift [[Molotov cocktail]]  to use against her attacker, should he return.  Morning approaches, and she walks down the highway with the driver of the truck approaching her at a rapid speed.  After some fumbling, she is able to strike a match and light her Molotov cocktail. She hurls the bottle at the truck and almost instantly it is consumed by flames, followed by a large explosion. She investigates the truck but finds no body. After a few moments, she turns around and the man in the truck is behind her.  As an epilogue, the film ends with a different girl going to the same rest stop, after it is renovated due to the fire.  She discovers Nicole in the maintenance room and runs out to the Park Ranger (who has returned to his post) to inform him of her discovery.  He goes into the room, after unlocking it, and no one seems to be present.  After he leaves, Nicole is shown behind some janitorial equipment calling out for help and vomiting blood.  The next scene is from the view of a video camera. It shows the father from the RV burying the body of Jess. The man, realizing he is being taped, goes into the RV and tells his deformed son "This is our little secret." The yellow truck is then shown driving down a deserted road.

She was drowned on the Tokyo waterfront, but an autopsy reveals that her stomach is full of seawater. Moreover, all the clues he finds relate to himself: A button found at the murder scene matches one that is missing from his own coat, and fingerprints found match his own. Yoshioka realizes that the only viable suspect is himself; but he doesn't remember a thing.   A [[ghost]] in a red dress soon starts appearing to him. As these apparitions become more intense and bizarre, similar murders occur with people killing loved ones for small infractions. All the perpetrators are found by Yoshioka as he searches for clues about the original murder. Eventually the drowned woman is identified. Yoshioka visits her parents, only to find she had a boyfriend who was extorting her parents, who happens to visit the house at the same time. He quickly confesses to the crime.  Yoshioka is visited by the ghost again who reveals that she is not the murdered woman, but a ghost of a woman whom he saw in the window of an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]] fifteen years ago who has died. All of the murderers took the ferry past the same asylum. Yoshioka sends his girlfriend away, afraid of what he might do to her. He goes to the asylum, where the woman in red agrees to forgive him for not helping her 15 years ago.  He goes home, only to discover that he murdered his girlfriend 6 months ago. Going [[insane]], he tries to forget. He collects the bones, and goes to the asylum to pick up the ghost's bones. His partner arrives at his apartment and finds the empty bowl Yoshioka used to commit the murder. The ghost stalks him in the background. As an [[earthquake]] occurs, the bowl is now filled with water. The ghost suddenly appears above him and dives down dragging them both into the bowl. The film ends with Yoshioka walking in the street holding a bag containing his girlfriend's and the ghost's bones, with the ghost repeatedly saying: "I am dead. So please, I want everyone to die too".

Right at Your Door
  The film opens with Brad ([[Rory Cochrane]]), an out-of-work musician, making coffee for his wife, Lexi ([[Mary McCormack]]), who is still in bed. She leaves for work and Brad is left home alone. Over the radio, he hears that several suspected [[dirty bomb]]s have been detonated across Los Angeles. He exits his house and sees large amounts of smoke rising from the city. Brad gets into his car and drives to the city to find Lexi. Brad tries to contact her through her cell phone, but only receives a busy signal. He soon finds that all roads now have [[blockade|police blockades]].  An ash-covered car is stopped by the police. One officer notices Brad watching from inside his car and goes over to him to tell him to go back home. The police officers aim their weapons at the driver as he gets out and demand that he get back into his car. He ignores their warning and is shot down by the police. Brad decides to leave and go back home when he encounters a small boy called Timmy (Scotty Noyd, Jr.), who is watching the rising smoke from the city. Brad tells him to run home, and continues to his house.  Once home, Brad sees Alvaro ([[Tony Perez (actor)|Tony Perez]]), in the house. Alvaro asks Brad if he can stay with him as there is no one at the neighbor's house where he was working. Over the radio, they hear that survivors of the blasts are being [[quarantine]]d due to the bombs' deadly toxins, and that the authorities advise people to seal up their homes before the toxins reach them. Brad and Alvaro then proceed to seal up the house with duct tape and plastic. As it becomes increasingly obvious that Lexi might not come home, he takes some of Lexi's clothes and leaves them outside the back door with some food and water. Radio newscasts claim that the bombs contained several toxins and an unknown viral strain.  Lexi has been involved in a car crash but is still alive. She walks home, still covered in the dust. Brad, who sees her, realizes she could infect both himself and Alvaro so he does not let her in. Lexi becomes desperate after being locked out. She loses her temper and throws her cell phone at one of the door panes, breaking it. Brad and Alvaro both rush to cover up the breakage and seal it off. Together, they manage to calm Lexi down.  Brad then seals off the main bedroom from the rest of the house so that Lexi can get into it. Lexi receives a call from her mother, who realizes that she was near the explosion and is probably infected. Her pleas for Lexi to go to a hospital fall on deaf ears as Lexi tells her that the rest of the country is seeing news that doesn't all reflect the truth of the situation. A car alarm goes off nearby, and Timmy is seen next to it. Lexi calls him over and Brad seals off another part of the house in order for Lexi and Timmy to clean off the ash in the bathroom. Alvaro decides to leave the house, saying he needs to be with his wife. Brad tries to convince him to stay, but Alvaro leaves anyway and is seen slowly walking away through a downpour of toxic ash.  Lexi hears a noise from the back and alerts Brad. A masked man appears, who introduces himself as Rick ([[Jon Huertas]]). He tells Lexi that there is a ship on the coast that has medical supplies and is helping people. Lexi, Rick, and Timmy leave for help and Brad hears newscasts on the radio that elaborate on the unknown viral straining, saying it is hybrid and attacks the respiratory system. That same night Brad is visited by a Corporal Marshall ([[Max Kasch]]) and his men. He asks Brad several questions, such as how well his house has been sealed, who else is currently or recently been there, and if there has been any contact between him and anyone on the outside. Brad mentions the phone that Lexi threw the door window and the Corporal demands a sample of the dust off the phone. He tells Brad that he will soon be back with the results and that his wife under no circumstances should be let into the house. As he leaves, he is heard reciting the home's address, and then saying, "red tag."  Lexi returns home the next day without Timmy or Rick and sees the red tag placed outside the house. Lexi tells Brad that Timmy was treated with other children and that she saw police assault and arrest five people. Lexi calls her brother, Jason, ([[Will McCormack]]) so that she can have someone to talk to due to her mother being frantic with worry.  The next couple of hours are spent with Brad and Lexi on their respective sides of the door, who talk about what they will do assuming they survive. Brad imagines that after this they will both probably end up on one of those morning talk shows where everyone goes to reveal their woes. Suddenly, soldiers appear and grab Lexi, and prevent Brad from coming outside. One soldier manages to calm Brad down and explains to him that because he did such a good job sealing up the house, there is no new air to circulate through, but also explains that, unfortunately, when Lexi broke the door window, the virus was brought inside and has now multiplied to lethal levels, making the air inside extremely dangerous. Brad doesn't understand what the soldier is saying and insists that they bring his wife back. A large heavy piece of plywood is put over the back door, completely covering it. A hole is drilled through the wood and a pipe appears through which a gas starts to be pumped in. More boards seal the windows and doors but Brad manages to break down the plywood covering his front door, only to discover that a fumigation tent has been erected over the whole house. He tries to tear through the tent and is knocked unconscious by a soldier, as Lexi screams Brad's name. The camera cuts to Brad as he takes his last few breaths.  Lexi is later seen sitting in an ambulance, being attended to by a nurse. The film ends with Lexi in too much shock to say anything, her cell phone ringing.  
The Return (2006 film)
 Joanna Mills ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]), a travelling rep for a trucking company, is dedicated to her successful career but something of a loner.  Since the age of 11 she has been a troubled person, with episodes of [[Self-injury|self-mutilation]] and menacing [[Hallucination|vision]]s.  Normally she avoids returning to her native Texas, but agrees to a trip there to secure an important client.  During the trip her visions, which take the form of memories of events not from her life, increase in intensity.  She sees a strange face staring  back at her in the mirror.  Her truck radio plays [[Patsy Cline]]'s "Sweet Dreams" no matter what station she selects.  She stops at the scene of an accident that, on the following day, seems not to have happened.  Joanna cuts herself in a bar restroom and is narrowly rescued by a friend.  She visits her father, who observes that from age 11 she was "a different girl".  The visions continue, becoming both more specific and more threatening, centering upon a menacing man she does not recognize and a bar she has never seen, but a picture of which is in one of her catalogs.  Drawn by the image to the Texas town where the bar is located, a place she has not been since childhood, Joanna meets a man named Terry Stahl, whose wife, Annie, was stalked, brutally assaulted, and left to die fifteen years before, a crime of which Terry was suspected but not convicted.  Joanna continues to have visions of this crime and the events that led up to it, and to discover other links between Annie's life and hers.  She meets the real killer and is led by what she has seen in her visions to recover the knife he used from its hiding place.  She is then stalked, herself.  She finds herself drawn into a repetition of the crime, but this time she stabs her assailant with the recovered knife, using the original weapon to avenge the original crime.  The story ends with the revelation that Annie, clinging to life as Terry drove her to the hospital after the original assault, died when his car crashed into one driven by Joanna's father, in which the eleven-year-old Joanna was a passenger.  After momentary unconsciousness, the young Joanna seems to have survived the crash. A silent Joanna is seen reflecting on who she is and what has happened to her.  She seems to reach an inner resolution of these questions.  An alternative ending included on the DVD release more straightforwardly supports the interpretation that Annie's soul has been placed in Joanna's body.

Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles
   ===Background===   In June 2044, the [[Robotech Expeditionary Force]] (REF) fleet gathers at Moon Base ALUCE for its final attempt to drive the alien [[Invid (Robotech)|Invid]] from the Earth. This time, the REF has important technological advantages thanks to the help of the Sentinel races; the Karbarrans provided the industrial resources to construct this armada, while a secretive and highly advanced cybernetic race known as the [[Haydonites]] have provided advanced technology including Shadow devices, which make REF ships invisible to Invid sensors, and Syncro-Cannons, which are significantly more powerful than the REF's earlier weapons. The REF fleet is led by newly completed [[SDF-4 Izumo]], a Super Dimensional Fortress over 1.3&nbsp;km (0.8 miles) long under the command of General Gunther Reinhardt.  Resistance forces on Earth, now aided by REF Commando units secretly dispatched in advance, are prepared to launch a simultaneous ground assault against the primary Invid hive at [[Reflex Point]] while the Invid's main forces engage the REF fleet. If both of these attacks fail, the REF has been authorized to use the devastating Neutron-S missiles as a last resort - although these missiles are more than capable of destroying the Invid, they will also wipe out most (or possibly all) life on earth.  Among the REF fighter pilots are [[Maia Sterling]], [[Marcus Rush]] and Alex Romero, all of whom were born in space during the REF mission and have never seen Earth. Lieutenant Commander [[Maia Sterling]], a daughter of famed pilots [[Max Sterling]] and [[Miriya Parina Sterling]] and sister of [[Dana Sterling]], has just been given command of the famed [[Skull Squadron (Robotech)|Skull Squadron]]. Marcus and Alex, both lieutenants, are part of Wolf Squadron under the command of Captain Daryl Taylor. When Marcus first sees Maia, he finds himself attracted to her but only manages a bungled pass. Marcus, whose sister Marlene was killed in a previous REF assault on Earth two years earlier, harbors a deep hatred of the Invid.  As the film opens, General Reinhardt sends [[Vince Grant]], captain of the ''Icarus'', one of the REF's five newly completed [[List of Robotech vehicles#Shimakaze-class Battlecruiser|''Shimakaze''-class battlecruisers]], on a rescue mission to look for the SDF-3 and Admiral [[Rick Hunter]], chief military commander of all REF forces. In its last transmission to the REF, it seems that the [[SDF-3 Pioneer|SDF-3]] was involved in an accident of some kind while overseeing the test of the Neutron-S missile in the Omicron Sector.  Despite the disadvantage of not having the SDF-3 and its powerful arsenal, General Reinhardt is forced to begin the attack. The assault initially goes well as the REF capital ships fire their massive Syncro-Cannons, which destroy many Invid Carriers<ref>[http://www.robotech.com/infopedia/mecha/viewmecha.php?id=27&seriescode=NGE Invid Carrier specifications] at Robotech.com.</ref> before they can launch their fighters. REF fighter squadrons, armed with advanced weaponry and utilizing the Shadow technology that makes them invisible to the Invid sensors, easily cripple the first wave of the Invid attack. On the ground, the resistance forces and REF commando units push forward and approach within striking distance of Reflex Point.  However, the Invid Regis, obsessed with holding on to Earth no matter the cost, launches all of her remaining forces in one final attack wave. All Invid fighters capable of space combat are sent against the REF fleet and all remaining Invid ground forces are ordered to retreat to [[Reflex Point]] for a last stand. When Reinhardt tries to get an update from the ground forces, he makes contact with resistance leader [[Scott Bernard]], a survivor of one of the previous failed REF assaults. Scott informs Reinhardt that the attack is going poorly and that the REF ground forces have been forced to halt their advance while still out of range of Reflex Point. Ending the communication, Scott meets with [[Ariel (Robotech)|Ariel]], an Invid princess that looks like a young human woman, and Scott's love interest. Ariel hopes to convince her mother, the Invid Regis, that the humans and the Invid can live in peace. However, the Regis is skeptical of Ariel's words as she recognizes the Humans' new Shadow technology as something used by an ancient enemy of the Invid &mdash; the "Children of the Shadow", and remains determined to fight to the bitter end.  In space, REF fighter squadrons, despite their technological advantages, become overwhelmed by sheer Invid numbers and begin taking heavy losses. Invid fighters begin punching through the frontlines of the fleet and attacking the REF capital ships, further straining the ability of the REF to continue the battle. General Reinhardt is informed that the fleet is taking heavy losses and further attempts to contact the ground forces get no response. Meanwhile, more Invid Carriers arrive in orbit, and begin launching thousands more fighters against the already overwhelmed REF fleet. With the ground offensive stalled and the REF fleet hopelessly outnumbered, Reinhardt authorizes the use of Neutron-S missiles, but is unaware of the missiles' true power. However, the Regis' daughter [[Ariel (Robotech)|Ariel]] finally convinces her mother to leave Earth rather than allow both races to be destroyed. This request, combined with the Regis' knowledge of the true power of the Neutron-S missiles, convinces the Regis that her race no longer belongs on Earth. She realizes that the REF has been fooled - if the REF had known how powerful the missiles were, they never would have used them. The Regis transforms the Invid race into a massive phoenix of pure energy, in the same manner by which the Invid first arrived on Earth, and ascends into the sky. As a parting gift to Ariel, who chooses to remain behind, the Regis destroys the Neutron-S missiles. The Invid stream of light flies off into space in search of a new planet on which to continue their evolution, thus ending the [[Third Robotech War]].  Meanwhile, in the Omicron sector, the ''Icarus'' arrives and locates the SDF-3 near a newly created [[black hole]]. The ''Icarus'' barely escapes the massive gravational pull of the black hole - but sustains damage to all of its Shadow technology, including the Shadow device and its Syncro-Cannon. A sensor scan then reveals that both the SDF-3 and the science vessel ''Deukalion'', have been badly damaged by an accident involving the testing of the new Neutron-S missiles. Captain [[Vince Grant]] makes contact with [[Rick Hunter|Admiral Rick Hunter]], who explains that they have discovered a critical flaw with the Neutron-S missiles and that the REF must be warned that the missiles cannot be used on Earth under any circumstances. He also orders Grant to take the ''Deukalion'', which has recorded critical information. After securing the ''Deukalion'' with the ''Icarus' '' clamps, Grant moves the ''Icarus'' close to the SDF-3 so that its hyperspatial fold-sphere will encompass both ships and enable them to return to Earth. However, a group of unknown alien warships attack the ''Icarus''. Just as they are about to initiate the fold-sphere, one of the alien vessels rams the SDF-3, pushing it out of range of the sphere and toward the black hole. Grant, following Hunter's orders that the REF must be warned about the true nature of the missiles, engages the ''Icarus'''s hyperfold drive and races back to Earth. The SDF-3 is left behind, adrift in space and caught in the black hole's gravitational pull.  With the battle over, the REF orders its damaged ships to Space Station Liberty for repairs. Since Earth will be vulnerable while the REF rebuilds, the fighter squadrons will remain at Moon Base ALUCE. However, the Invid took all of the Protoculture with them and the REF only has enough power to last a little less than a year. The only way to generate more power is with the Protoculture Matrix on board the SDF-3. Due to the heavy losses (including the death of Wolf Squadron commander Daryl Taylor), Wolf Squadron, home of [[Marcus Rush]] and Alex Romero, is folded into [[Maia Sterling]]'s [[Skull Squadron (Robotech)|Skull Squadron]].  Back on Earth, Scott is surprised to find that Ariel has stayed behind. Despite his feelings for her, Scott decides to leave and try and convince the REF leadership that humanity can co-exist with the Invid. As he flies to the main REF base at Moon Base ALUCE ('''A'''dvanced '''LU'''nar '''C'''hemical '''E'''ngineering), he stumbles upon the just-arrived ''Icarus'', and several unknown alien fighters that it accidentally brought with it. He helps the ''Icarus'' against the fighters, and then escorts it to ALUCE. Once there, he is reunited with Marcus, who is the younger brother of Scott's late fiancée, Marlene, who was killed in a previous REF assault two years earlier. Marcus is overjoyed to see Scott again, and Scott is impressed that Marcus has become a skilled fighter pilot. However, Marcus' joy at seeing Scott again is soon tempered when Scott confirms that Marlene did not survive.  The ''Deukalion'' is examined, and the only surviving crew member is [[Janice (Robotech)|Janice Em]], an gynoid that uses a holographic overlay that makes her look like a young woman. Louie Nichols, a scientist and veteran of the Second Robotech War, takes Janice to the science lab, and the two go over the test data to try and figure out what went wrong with the missile test. While there, Louie learns from Janice that the Haydonites aided the REF because they'd also suffered greatly at the hands of the Invid. Janice herself is a combination of Human and Haydonite technology, built to act as an emissary for the two races, as the Haydonites prefer not to deal with outsiders directly (as established in the prelude comic, only the most senior members of the REF are even aware of the Haydonites' existence).  Ariel, after using her teleportation power to travel to Moon Base ALUCE, suddenly walks up behind Scott, and surprises him. In an empty room, Ariel informs Scott that the reason she came to see him was because she had a vision. The Children of the Shadow are planning on attacking the REF. The Children destroyed the first Invid homeworld because they fear the power of Protoculture, and they will attack the Humans for the same reason. The discussion is interrupted by Marcus and Alex, and Marcus realizes that Ariel is an Invid. Scott is arrested and interrogated, where he warns of the impending attack, and reveals the Children's connection to the new REF technologies. The name Scott uses for the alien race is unfamiliar, while Reinhardt suspects that the warning is an attempt by the Invid to drive a wedge between the REF and the Haydonites.  Suddenly, all contact with Space Station Liberty is lost. When the ''Icarus'' arrives, Liberty is under attack by a large fleet of alien ships which have jammed all communications. The battle is going poorly for the REF; capital ships are being destroyed with just one hit by a disrupter wave emitted by the enemy fleet which causes the REF's Synchro-Cannons to overload and explode. Instead of charging into the battle, Vince sends Skull Squadron to collect information. While flying through the REF fleet, Skull Squadron records an REF carrier destroyed due to a single hit on its reflex furnace. Scans reveal that the Shadow device on the carrier caused its reflex furnace to implode when triggered by the enemy's disrupter wave. Janice sees the footage, and realizes that such an event should be impossible, due to the Shadow technology incorporated in all REF vessels. It then becomes clear that the Haydonites are in fact the mysterious Children of the Shadow, and that Ariel's warning was true. By now, 89% of the REF forces that engaged the Haydonites at Liberty have been destroyed. Captain Vince Grant, after watching the carrier explode, slams his fist as he realizes that every piece of technology the Haydonites have given to the REF contains some kind of [[Trojan Horse]]. Grant, suspecting that Janice may also be aligned with the Haydonites, orders her arrested and removed from the bridge. Unable to restore communications, Grant is unable to warn the remaining ships of these findings, and they are left to fight a hopeless battle.  [[Maia Sterling]] initially leads her Skull Squadron into battle, but is called back (since the Haydonite-supplied Syncro-Cannons equipped on the fighters will make any engagement futile) and is ordered to head to Space Station Liberty, and try to acquire fighters that don't incorporate Haydonite technology. As they approach Liberty, the squadron is pursued by Haydonite fighters. Alex Romero tries to engage them but his Syncro-Cannon, crippled by the Haydonite attack, malfunctions and his fighter becomes stalled. Despite the pleas of Maia and Marcus for Alex to eject, he flies into the enemy squadron as his fighter explodes, destroying himself and the enemy fighters. Maia is visibly upset by Alex's sacrifice while Marcus, who was Alex's best friend, is completely devastated.  Since the ''Icarus'', which is equipped with Shadow technology, is no longer a viable ship, Vince orders the ''Icarus'' to dock with Space Station Liberty. Louie scans Liberty's ship registry for capital ships that have no Shadow technology but finds only one: the massive colony ship ''[[Ark Angel (Robotech)|Ark Angel]]''. Vince orders the evacuation of all station personnel to the ''Ark Angel'', and gives Louie one hour to get the ship's inactive reflex furnace online. Ariel uses her teleportation power to assist in the evacuation after transporting Louie and his team immediately to the ''Ark Angel''. In the meantime, Skull Squadron has located brand-new prototype Advanced Shadow Fighters that haven't had the Shadow technology installed yet, and Maia promises to buy time for the evacuation.  As Janice is taken to a detention area, two Haydonite soldiers blast into the hallway and confront her. After Janice refuses to cooperate, the soldiers decide she is now expendable. Just then, Scott Bernard appears in combat armor and opens fire, killing one of the soldiers. The remaining soldier then removes his cloak, revealing the true form of the Haydonites. As it flies toward Scott, Grant also in combat armor, appears and opens fire, mortally wounding it. Realizing that Janice was also betrayed by the Haydonites (who now want her dead), Grant asks her to continue to serve with the REF, to which Janice readily agrees.  Scott and Vince board [[Cyclone (Robotech)|Cyclones]], and prepare to head into the space station. Liberty has the remaining stockpile of Neutron-S missiles, and Vince sets one to self-destruct. The ''Ark Angel'' is able to depart as planned, with the ''Icarus'' following closely. The Haydonites, unaware of Grant's plan, move their fleet towards Liberty to destroy the ''Ark Angel'' as Skull Squadron continues to engage the Haydonite fighters. During the battle, Maia's fighter takes damage and she is forced to eject. Marcus uses his fighters' robotic hands to grab Maia's ejection pod and throw it towards the ''Ark Angel'' as it prepares to enter a spacefold. Marcus, deciding he has no reason to live, holds down his weapon triggers and launches a suicide run against the Haydonites to hold them off long enough for ''Ark Angel'' to escape. Just as the ''Ark Angel'' initiates a spacefold, the Neutron-S warheads detonate with a massive explosion, destroying Liberty and the entire Haydonite fleet.  Marcus sees a white light and has a vision of his sister Marlene, who tells him it is not his time to die and that she will always be with him. Marcus begs her not to leave him, before he wakes up on board the ''Ark Angel'', with Ariel by his side. [[Ariel (Robotech)|Ariel]] then reveals that she used her teleportation power to save him. Marcus, almost angrily, asks Ariel why she saved his life, since he has so much hatred for the Invid. Ariel simply tells him ''"hatred can only breed more hatred. It is not what we seek... any of us"'' and Marcus is left at a loss for words.  As the ''Ark Angel'' approaches Earth, Maia and Marcus console each other over the recent events. Marcus is despondent as he states that everyone he has been close to; his sister Marlene, his former commanding officer (Daryl Taylor) and his best friend (Alex Romero) have been taken by war. Maia is also despondent as she states that most of her family was aboard the [[SDF-3 Pioneer|SDF-3]], which is lost in space and may have been destroyed. Maia puts her head on Marcus' shoulder and the two look out a viewport as the ''Ark Angel'' flies over Earth's surface, which neither of them has seen until now.  General Reinhardt gives Vince his new orders: Vince and his crew are to take the ''Ark Angel'' and attempt to locate the SDF-3, which may not have been destroyed as initially thought. As Scott and Ariel share a kiss, Louie does his best to reassure a confused and uncertain Janice that [[Robotech music#Robotech: Perfect Collection|"We will win."]]  
Rocky Balboa (film)
  Rocky Balboa, now in his late fifties and retired from boxing, lives a quiet life as a widower, [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian]] having died from cancer four years prior. He now runs a small but successful Italian restaurant named after her, where he regales his patrons with stories of his past. He also battles personal demons, involving his grief over Adrian's death, the changing times, and his eroding relationship with his son Robert, who has moved out to become a struggling corporate employee. [[Paulie Pennino|Paulie]], Rocky's brother-in-law, continues to support him whenever he can, but is constantly riddled with guilt over his poor treatment toward his late sister.  Late one night, Rocky reunites with a woman named Marie, who was once a mischievous neighborhood girl long ago. Marie now works as a bartender at the Lucky Seven Tavern, and is a single parent of a teenage son born out of wedlock named Stephenson, nicknamed "Steps". Rocky's friendship with Marie (where Steps takes to Rocky as his father figure) quickly blossoms over the following weeks, providing him a much-needed buffer for his anguish.  Meanwhile, on the professional boxing circuit, Mason "The Line" Dixon, reigns as the undefeated, yet unpopular heavyweight world champion, often ridiculed for defeating only "bum" competitors, having never gone up against a true contender. This leads to tension with the public and his promoters, and encourages him to return to his roots, the small gym he first trained in, as well as his old trainer who sagely tells him that, inevitably, he will earn back his respect through a true opponent. Their relationship mirrors Rocky and Mickey.  [[ESPN]] later broadcasts a computer simulation of a fight between Rocky (in his prime) and Mason, likened to a modern-day version of [[The Super Fight]] that ends in a disputed KO victory for Balboa, further riling the champ. In contrast, the simulation inspires Rocky to take up boxing again—an intention that goes public when he successfully renews his boxing license. Dixon's promoters thus pitch the idea of holding a charity exhibition bout at the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to bolster Dixon's floundering popularity.  With some hesitation, both men agree to the match, creating a media buzz that stabs at Rocky's has-been status and Dixon's credibility. Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice; that to succeed in life, "it ain't about how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can ''get'' hit, and keep moving forward", and that blaming others won't help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky's side. Rocky sets straight to training with [[Apollo Creed]]'s old trainer, Duke, who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible.  The bout itself is a back and forth affair, with Dixon easily dominating the first round, only to injure his left hand in the second one on Rocky's hip. Rocky then makes a dramatic comeback, knocking Mason down, and surprising the audience with his prowess and [[chin (boxing)|chin]], despite his age. The two combatants beat each other severely throughout the full ten rounds, ending with both men still standing, although Rocky gets the last punch. Rocky thanks an appreciative Dixon for the match and tells him that he is a great champion while the audience applauds the two fighters. The result is announced as Rocky exits the ring to the adulation of the crowd: it is a win for Dixon by a close split decision, but Rocky clearly doesn't mind the outcome.  In the closing shot, Rocky returns home and visits Adrian's grave again, thanking her for helping him; "Yo Adrian, we did it. We did it."  
Rob-B-Hood
 Friends Thongs and Octopus evade security guards in a hospital, having stolen money and cancer medication from the safe. Meanwhile, a newborn baby to the wealthy Lee family is snatched by Max, the mother's ex-boyfriend, prompting the security guards give chase, ignoring the burglars, and corner Max on an escalator. Following a violent struggle, Max and the baby fall over the side—the baby is caught by Thongs, while Max plummets to his death. While the guards are distracted, Thongs and Octopus leave in the Landlord's [[minivan]].  A few months later, the Landlord finds his flat burgled, his life savings gone. He receives a phone call from his middleman Uncle Seven, offering him a job to kidnap baby Lee on behalf of a triad boss, who claims the baby is his grandson. Enticed by the HK$7 million reward, Thongs and Octopus accept the job without knowing its objectives, finding out only after the Landlord has fled the Lees' mansion with the baby. Disgusted by the idea of kidnapping a baby, Thongs threatens to return him, but relents after the Landlord tells him of his predicament. En route to their rendezvous point in [[Sai Kung]], the trio encounter a police [[Roadblock|road block]] which the Landlord attempts to outrun, only to crash his van down a hill. As the police close in on them, the stuck Landlord instructs Thongs and Octopus to leave with the baby. While in custody for [[reckless driving]], the Landlord learns of the baby's value through the news. He phones Thongs, instructing him not to hand the baby over to anyone prior to his release so he can jack up the price. Over the next few days, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby, developing a strong bond with him. The two begin to regret their vices: Thongs resists the urge to gamble, while Octopus feels sorry for cheating on his wife. Meanwhile, both the triads and the police are after the baby. The triad boss, enraged by the non-delivery of his "grandson", sends his men to retrieve the baby from Thongs' flat. Confronted by both the triads and Police Inspector Mok, Thongs and Octopus go into hiding with the baby.  Shortly after his release, the Landlord is brought to the triad boss, who increases his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus are more concerned about the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them with the rest of the money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a [[blood sample]] is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.  Thongs and Octopus are taken to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the [[blood test]]. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, prompting Thongs and Octopus to fight for the baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift [[defibrillator]] powered by a [[car battery]] from a [[Pagani Zonda]]. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the [[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Department of Justice]]. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord then see the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.

Road House 2
 [[D.E.A.]] agent Shane Tanner ([[Johnathon Schaech]]), is the son of a legendary cooler named James Dalton (played by [[Patrick Swayze]] in the original film). Nate Tanner ([[Will Patton]]) is Shane's uncle, and the owner of the Black Pelican, a bar located in Nate's new permanent town of Tyree, [[Louisiana]]. Nate gets a call from his rival, who's nicknamed "Wild Bill", the former Black Pelican owner who has been trying to get the bar back. Wild Bill asks Nate to meet him at a pier, supposedly to discuss a truce. Nate goes to the pier and gets ambushed and beat up badly by Wild Bill.  Meanwhile in [[New York City]], Shane, along with other agents, bust drug dealers in a [[night club]]. Shane later gets a phone call about his uncle being in the hospital and getting badly beaten. Shane gets his uncle's location and leaves for Tyree. Shane takes off for local authorities to find out who ambushed Nate. Shane decides to stay in Nate's house and run the Black Pelican in Nate's absence, much to the dismay of Wild Bill. The location is best for drug-running, as the Black Pelican is close to the border. However, like his uncle, Shane refuses to sell the bar and damages the numerous thugs that Wild Bill sends his way.  A small subplot involves Shane still looking for the murderer who killed his father, the legendary Dalton, many years ago when Shane arrived home from work (Shane was a Rookie Louisiana State Trooper). After Dalton's murder, Shane left town and joined the DEA as a field agent. Now, Wild Bill's boss, Miami crime syndicate kingpin Victor Cross ([[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]]), decides that it's time to handle matters personally, since Wild Bill's men have not been doing a good job of taking care of Shane. Shane is soon faced with impossible odds and a low number of staff members at the Black Pelican.  To rid Louisiana of Victor, Wild Bill, and their organization, Shane teams up with local school teacher Beau Hampton, who has a military background. Soon, Beau and Shane team up and take down Wild Bill and Victor. In the end, Victor is badly beaten and left at Beau's house and Wild Bill is impaled by the symbolic black pelican at the bar.  It is revealed that Victor had wanted Shane dead for a drug bust he did on Victor long ago as a Rookie State Trooper. Victor had hired Wild Bill, then a cooler at the bar, to kill Dalton. Shane decides to stay in town since he can finally be at peace after finding his father's murderers and exacting justice on them.

Romance of Darkness
 It happened in a blink of an eye.  '''Rikka Nikaidō''' is a normal school girl whose life is thrown into chaos when her bus flips into a lake while on a school field trip. She is the sole survivor. Once she is released from the hospital, she tries to regain a regular life and even starts up swimming again. However, a black haired woman attempts to attack Rikka repeatedly while in the water. She is '''Rikka Mizuchi''', a girl who has lived for centuries with the help of a golden seed that her lover '''Izumi''' gave her every forty nine years. This year, Izumi gave Rikka N. the seed, and Rikka M. is determined to kill the other Rikka before the girl is fully assimilated with water.  '''Yuzuru''', Rikka N.'s weak, university student cousin she's loved since childhood, learns about the other Rikka. But it turns out that Yuruzu may not be so human after all.  A long, long time ago, there was a white dragon and a black dragon. They fought to see who would rule which part of the sky. And the white dragon fell, and the black dragon assumed he was dead, and soon forgot about him. But the white dragon had gone down to the humans, and became one of them. A story told to the first born sons of the Nikaidō family, who have dragon blood running through their veins. One day, with the help of a female relative who would be named Rikka, the white dragon would be revived. As it turns out, the black dragon is Izumi and the white dragon's reincarnation is Yuzuru. However, he kept his feelings for Rikka a secret, because the way to revive the white dragon is through sex, where the white dragon would devour the girl's life. He tells her the way to revive the white dragon after rejecting her when they were about to have sex, Rikka already realizing that sex was how to revive him.  But as Izumi causes climate disasters, trying to force the white dragon to do something about it and fight him, Yuzuru refuses to devour Rikka in order to fight back. Rikka M. learns that she also has Nikaidō blood coursing through her, and offers herself to Yuruzu. Rikka N. stops her. As floods happen and the rain is boiling hot, Yuruzu asks if Rikka would give herself to him and she agrees. He devours her, and the white dragon is revived.  After going to the lake where the seed came from and freezing her, the white dragon and the black dragon finally have their rematch, the one Izumi wanted so desperately. When Rikka M. realizes that the white dragon and the black dragon have equal power, she offers herself to be devoured by Yuruzu, who agrees after nearly having his arm bit off by Izumi. With the new power, he defeats Izumi, and as the two go back to human form, Izumi is bleeding furiously from a neck bite, but Yuruzu refuses to finish him. As Izumi watches, Yuruzu grows two more golden seeds, and in turn feeds them to Rikka M. and Rikka N. They come back to life.  When she learns that another seed won't expand Izumi's life, Rikka M. kills him as he yells for the white dragon to finish him. Yuruzu informs her that the lake's flowers will be in blossom all year, with golden seeds. She can take a seed any time she wants, and even live forever. Realizing she can live even longer than Izumi had, she leaves.  Yuruzu asks Rikka N. what she would like, and she tells him she just wants a normal life with him.  
Romeo & Juliet: Sealed with a Kiss
 Warring Capulets (Michael Toland) and Montagues (Stephen Goldberg), portrayed as [[Steller sea lion|Steller]] and [[California sea lion|California]] [[pinniped|sea lions]] respectively, have their feud watched sadly by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet (Patricia Trippett). A fight on the shore is ended when the Prince ([[Phil Nibbelink]]), a large and monstrous [[Northern elephant seal|elephant seal]], appears and warns the two groups that, should there be any more disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island, a fin shaped rock where a [[Great white shark|shark]] lives. Romeo (Daniel Tripett), Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing to fall in love with someone. His humorous friend, Mercutio (Chip Albers), urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio (Sam Gold), to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in white sand to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight. Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, who attends the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she will not have to marry the Prince.  Romeo begs Friar Lawrence, a [[sea otter]], to wed them. After some thought, the friar believes their marriage will end the feud between their families, and agrees. Romeo and Juliet are wed that morning and traverse the sea in their happiness. However, even the other sea and land animals strongly oppose their being together. A fish finds them a lovely couple, but warns them that they will be in big trouble if the Prince finds out. Back on the beach, Mercutio is telling many jokes, which leads to him making insulting jokes against the Capulets, and the Prince is headed in that direction. When he arrives, Mercutio mocks him as well. Romeo rushes to aid his friend, but after a struggle Mercutio falls off the cliff where Juliet met Romeo the previous evening, and everyone thinks that he is dead. The Prince, jealous of Juliet's affection for Romeo, exiles Romeo to Shark Island. In despair, Juliet seeks the Friar's help, and he gives her a potion to put her in a deathlike state. Mercutio is revealed to be alive and sees the whole thing, remarking, "What a tangled web we weave."  Lawrence shows the Capulet seals that Juliet is "dead", right as they were celebrating the marriage. But Benvolio sees her as well, and swims to Shark Island to tell Romeo. The Friar chases him to stop him, but is attacked by a shark. After receiving the terrible news from Benvolio, Romeo heads to the shore to see if Juliet is truly dead. Friar Lawrence arrives too late and tries to follow Romeo, only to have his tail maimed by the shark. After an undersea chase and some help from the fish Romeo and Juliet met earlier, Lawrence escapes and heads to the beach.

She reports gunshots, hangs up, then murders them both.   Throughout all of this, Joey has been tracking down the missing gun, and is about to finally get it back. But just before he can, he is foiled by the presence of Tommy, who takes him and Oleg to a remote landfill and ultimately threatens Joey with a gun.

When he ultimately refuses and attempts to walk away, Ivan shoots him in the back, killing him. When Ivan goes to kill Oleg himself, Joey says in desperation that the gun is in fact Tommy's. Enraged, Tommy then attempts to kill him, but is instead killed by a Russian mobster when another shootout ensues. In the ensuing chaos, Frankie and Ivan go against each other in a bloody brawl, which results in the latter being killed. Frankie then confronts Joey at gunpoint, at which point Joey reveals a hidden wire under his shirt, thus revealing his FBI cover. Just before Frankie can kill Joey, Oleg helps to distract Frankie so Joey can disarm him, who then kills Frankie. Joey and Oleg then leave the hockey rink just in time to see the FBI storm the building.  Joey and Oleg then go to a diner for breakfast before heading home.

Saikano
 The story begins with , a high school student in a [[Hokkaidō]] coastal city, walking up to an observatory and reminiscing about his girlfriend, ; there he finds her [[Personal journal|exchange diaries]] that she purposefully left behind. The ensuing story is narrated by Shuji through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s while reading Chise's diary. Chise, a fellow student in his class, declares her love for Shuji at the beginning of the series. However, Chise is very shy and Shuji is insensitive: neither know how to express their feelings very well, but they do indeed have feelings for each other.  One day, while Shuji is [[shopping]] in [[Sapporo]], unknown [[bomber]]s attack the city in broad daylight. He and his friends run for cover, but notice a fast and small flying object shooting down the enemy bombers. Separated from his friends, Shuji wanders through the wreckage—only to stumble upon Chise; here she has metal wings and weapons—apparently grafted onto her body. She tells him she has become the ultimate weapon, without her knowledge or consent, and that she is seen by the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF) as the last hope for defending Japan. In the anime, it is not apparent why Chise was chosen to be the ultimate weapon or why the country is under attack. It was not until the [[OVA]] episodes were released that an explanation for Chise being chosen was offered: her body has the highest degree of compatibility with the weapon system.  This story focuses primarily on Chise's fading humanity as her condition worsens. The main conflict is within Chise herself; she questions whether or not she is human. Her soul is constantly trying to be a normal girl, while her body succumbs to the devastating effects of the weapon cell within her. Fundamentally important to the plot is the relationship between Shuji and Chise. From this, the resolution of the conflict follows. In the end, she is able to realize who she truly is.  A number of minor characters who do not necessarily know of Chise's role in the war have sub-plots that concern everyday people in the context of war: a woman whose husband is constantly away from home, a school boy who joins the army to protect his girlfriend, a girl whose civilian boyfriend is killed in a bombing, and others.

At a company picnic, Bob is embarrassed in front of his self-absorbed boss Todd Mallory ([[Will Arnett]]) by Cassie's militant friend Gretchen, who hurls a bottle of slimy fat all over Todd for putting unhealthy drinks in schools. Looking forward to a big family vacation in Hawaii, their trip is cancelled when Todd, out of spite, tells Bob that he has to attend a meeting with the Alpine Soda company in [[Boulder, Colorado]] instead, or else he will be fired. Concealing the real reason for going there, he rents a garish [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] from the dodgy dealer Irv ([[Barry Sonnenfeld]]) and tells his family they are traveling to the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]].  On their trip, Bob and his family encounter many mishaps. These include him damaging the parking brake, crashing into and running over objects such as shopping carts, flushing out a trio of raccoons with a [[stink bomb]], and fixing a clogged sewage system. Along the way, they meet another traveling family, the Gornickes, consisting of Travis ([[Jeff Daniels]]), Mary Jo ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), and their children, Earl ([[Hunter Parrish]]), Billy ([[Alex Ferris]]), and Moon (Chloe Sonnenfeld). Earl develops a romantic interest in Cassie and Carl starts to like Moon, but thinking that the Gornickes are too strange for them, Bob and Jamie decide to ditch them; when the Gornickes reappear at another stop, the Munros believe they are stalking them.  Meanwhile, to disguise his business trip, Bob tries to e-mail a proposal outline from his [[laptop]], working in restrooms; eventually, a hitchhiker steals it, leaving him with only a [[BlackBerry]] PDA, which he does manage to use to compose and wirelessly send his proposal to his company. The Gornickes then recover his stolen laptop after picking up the same hitchhiker, and pursue to return it to him.  Eventually the Munros begin to enjoy their vacation. In order to attend the Alpine merger meeting, Bob distracts his family by faking illness and sends them on a hike. The meeting with Alpine Soda is a success, but Bob is invited to talk to the whole company again the next day. Rushing back to his family in the RV, he takes a treacherous [[4 wheel drive]] trail, and gets the huge vehicle stuck atop a jutting boulder in the middle of it. He eventually manages to dislodge it from there by getting on the front and rocking it until it eventually wobbles and tips forward enough to slide down from atop the boulder. Now riding on the front while it is traveling at a frenzied pace, he barely manages to return to his family in time, succeeding in fooling them, but while he is attempting a similar ruse the next day, the parking brake fails again and the RV rolls into a lake. He lets it slip about the real intentions of the vacation, and his family is upset that he would use them like that. Still needing to get to the meeting, he retrieves one of his family's bicycles from the lake where the RV fell and pedals off. Jamie, Cassie, and Carl are then picked up by the Gornickes, and soon realize how well they get along, when Bob appears again, climbing atop the moving bus. Bob apologizes to his family, and they, in turn, apologize to him for their selfishness and reveal that they love him more than the lifestyle his job gives them. Bob is just about to blow off the meeting when it turns out that he's right outside the headquarters.  At the second meeting, Bob starts his speech and it goes well, but then he has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] and so he recommends against the merger, realizing that Todd's selfishness would destroy a great independent company. Carl gets angry at Todd and flips him over his shoulder, onto the ground. Bob is then fired, but he quits anyway, and soon retrieves the sodden-but-still-operable RV from the lake. At the end, he is offered a job by the owners of Alpine Soda, who want to go national independently. In addition, at the same time, the parking brake fails once again, causing the RV to roll backwards flattening both the police car and that of the owners of Alpine Soda. As the credits roll, the two families are shown dancing to and singing the song, "[[Route 66 (song)|Route 66]]" (RV Style).

The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause
  Carol/Mrs. Claus is teaching a class of young elves and begins telling them a story of her life with Scott Calvin/Santa Claus. The couple are expecting their first child as Christmas Eve approached. Scott invites his in-laws, Sylvia and Bud Newman, to the North Pole, along with Scott's former wife, Laura, her husband, Neil, and their daughter, Lucy. Meanwhile, he is summoned to a meeting of the Council of Legendary Figures, consisting of Mother Nature, Father Time, the Easter Bunny, Cupid, the Tooth Fairy, and the Sandman. Jack Frost also arrives, jealous that he has no holiday or special occasion in his honor. Because he has been promoting himself during the Christmas season, Mother Nature suggests sanctions against him. When Santa says he is dealing with how to get the in-laws to come without revealing that he is Santa, Jack Frost negotiates a light sentence of community service at the North Pole, helping Santa and the elves put up various Canadian-themed paraphernalia, as Carol's parents believe Scott is a toymaker in Canada.  However, Frost's ultimate goal is to trick Santa into renouncing his position. When elf Curtis inadvertently reveals the Escape Clause, Frost sneaks into Santa's hall of snow globes and steals one containing Scott as Santa. If Scott holds the globe and says, "I wish I'd never been Santa at all," he will go back in time and undo his career as Santa. When Lucy discovers this, Frost freezes her parents and locks her in a closet. He then orchestrates situations that make Scott think he must resign to make things better.  Frost tricks Scott into invoking the Escape Clause and both are sent to Scott's front yard in 1994, when Scott caused the original Santa to fall off of his roof and had to replace him. Frost causes the original Santa to fall off the roof and grabs Santa's coat before Scott can, making Frost the new Santa. Scott is sent back to the present day, where he has been CEO of his old company for the last 12 years and business takes priority over family. He also discovers that the new timeline has affected other people as well. Scott also learns he and Carol never married and Carol moved away years ago.  Scott goes to find Lucy and Neil, who are vacationing at the North Pole, which Frost has turned into a tourist resort. Christmas is now "Frostmas", the elves are miserable, and the reindeer are confined to a petting zoo. When Scott finds Lucy and Neil, Neil expresses his resentment for Scott's causing the separation between him and Laura. Scott confronts Frost as Santa Claus and tricks Jack Frost into recording his voice stating the Escape Clause. Scott has Lucy steal Frost's snow globe and bring it to him; when Frost finds out and takes the globe back, Scott plays the recording of Frost saying, "I wish I'd never been Santa at all", invoking the Escape Clause and causing Scott and Frost to be sent back again to 1994. Scott restrains Jack long enough to let the Scott Calvin of 1994 get the coat, making him Santa Claus again and taking him back to the North Pole in the present and the family where no time has passed.  Scott as Santa reconciles with his family and Jack is arrested by elf police. He reveals he cannot unfreeze his victims unless he is unfrozen himself. Scott convinces Lucy via a snow globe he had given her earlier of her warmly hugging a snowman, to give Frost a "magic hug" to unfreeze and reform him. The "Canada" ruse is dropped and Scott appears as Santa to Carol's parents. With two hours remaining before Santa must leave for his Christmas deliveries, Carol goes into labor.  Back to the present time, while Carol is telling the tale to her students, Scott walks in to reveal his baby boy, Buddy Claus.

Later, as Saravana and Sadhana go to a restaurant to eat, a gang comes. Saravana chases them for a while and beats all of them up. Realizing he has left Sadhana behind, Saravana returns to the restaurant. However, Sadhana is not there. Frightened, he returns home to find her there. She was rescued by her brother's assistant.

When he arrives at the village, Saravana is greeted by Krishna's elder brother Soundarapandi ([[Prakash Raj]]). Soundarapandi's wife ([[Easwari Rao]]) treats Saravana like a brother and dotes on him. Eventually, Saravana is told about the caste clashes occurring in the village.  Soon, Sadhana arrives. Saravana tries hard to impress her but faces many difficulties. Strangely, he does not tell her about his love and devotion. However, the other family members eventually become aware of his love, and they approve of him. When Sadhana takes Saravana to the temple for a visit without anyone's knowledge, the rival group is attacked by Sadhana's brother's gang. The rival then holds Sadhana hostage and threatens to kill her. In a swift action of bravery and skill, Saravana knocks down the rival group member.  After this incident, Soundarapandi tells Saravana why things are so violent in the village.

He wants to seek the blessings of the goddess Amman for the marriage. However, Sadhana is unaware of this. Trouble ensues when the rival gang kills the rest of Sadhana's family, forcing Saravana and Sadhana to flee the village. Soundarapandi's last wish was for Saravana to take care of Sadhana and marry her.  The story shifts back to Saravana's household, and Saravana plans to send Sadhana to London. This is because the enemy will not be able to find her there. His family does not approve because they know of his love for her. By now, Sadhana has also fallen in love with him and his family. However, she agrees to leave because she thinks that he has no such feelings for her. Soundarapandi's assistant, who managed to escape the village, gives Sadhana the green saree, saying that it was supposed to be her brother's gift to her.  On the day Sadhana is supposed to leave to London, she wears the green sari. At the airport, she meets Saravana's college mate. The girl tells Sadhana about Saravana's devotion for her. She also tells her that the green sari was bought by Saravana after much deliberation, and that she had to endure his torture of visiting many shops to find the perfect sari. Sadhana is surprised.

A Scanner Darkly (film)
 The United States has lost the [[war on drugs]]. Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants.  Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor abandoned his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in [[Anaheim, California]]; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a "scramble suit" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and he is known only by the code name "Fred." Arctor's senior officer, "Hank", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other.  Since going undercover, Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D and has befriended the main woman he has been spying on: a cocaine addict and Substance D supplier named Donna. Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of Substance D from Donna so that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier, but he has also developed seemingly unrequited romantic feelings towards her.   At work, Hank orders Arctor to step up surveillance on Arctor himself and his associates; however, Arctor's house is now at the center of his own investigation, since this is where Donna and the other addicts in her and Arctor's life now spend most of their time. Arctor, therefore, has to carefully plan his double life, though his prolonged use of Substance D is damaging his brain, causing him to sometimes forget his own identity. Meanwhile, the justified paranoia of Arctor's housemates reaches extreme levels, and Barris secretly communicates to the police his exaggerated belief that Donna and Arctor are terrorists; Barris unknowingly conveys this information in the presence of Arctor himself, whose identity at the time is hidden behind his scramble suit.  After Barris supplies the police with a faked recording allegedly proving his claims about Donna and Arctor, Hank orders that Barris be held on charges of providing false information. After Barris's arrest, Hank reveals to Arctor that he has deduced him to be the true identity of "Fred" by a process of elimination. Arctor seems legitimately surprised and repeats his own name in a disoriented, unfamiliar tone. Hank informs him that the real purpose of the surveillance was to catch Barris, not Arctor, and that the police were deliberately increasing Barris's paranoia until he attempted to cover his tracks. Hank reprimands Arctor for becoming addicted to Substance D, and warns him that he will be disciplined, likely with just a fine but possibly a few months of [[penal labor]]. Hank "phones" Donna, asks her to take Arctor to New-Path, a corporation that runs a series of rehabilitation clinics, and Arctor, who is rapidly becoming more disoriented, leaves Hank's office, cursing Hank aloud. Afterwards, Hank enters the locker room and removes his scramble suit, revealing his true identity to the audience: Donna. At the New-Path clinic, Arctor experiences the symptoms of Substance D withdrawal, including more severe brain damage. He mindlessly repeats what others tell him and utters mostly simplistic responses.  Some time later, Donna (revealed to be another false name) converses with a fellow police officer, Mike, and the audience learns that New-Path is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of Substance D; they use victims of the drug to tend their crops, since (being nearly mindless) they can be trusted not to reveal New-Path's secret. Donna expresses her growing ethical aversion to their police work, in which they deliberately selected Arctor—without his knowledge—to become addicted to Substance D all along; his health was sacrificed so that he might eventually enter a New-Path rehabilitation center unnoticed as a genuine addict and collect incriminating evidence of New-Path's Substance D farms. Donna and Mike debate whether Arctor's mind will recover enough so that he grasps the situation and returns from serving his sentence with substantial evidence to shut down New-Path.  In the final scene, New-Path gives Arctor a new name "Bruce" and sends him from the clinic to a labor camp at an isolated New-Path farm, where he spots rows of blue flowers hidden between rows of corn. These flowers, referenced throughout the film, are the source of Substance D. As the film ends, Arctor hides a blue flower in his boot, apparently prepared to hand it over to the authorities during his upcoming Thanksgiving respite, though it is not at all clear whether he has recovered enough of his mental faculties to do so.  ===End credits=== The end credits feature an abridged version of the afterword of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel, in which Dick lists people he knew who have suffered serious permanent physical or mental damage (brain damage, psychosis, [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] trauma, etc.) or death as a result of drug use. Dick includes his own name on the list, as "Phil", a victim of permanent pancreatic damage.  Linklater adds another name to the credits and dedicates the film to the memory of [[Louis H. Mackey]], an influential philosophy professor at the University of Texas at Austin; he had appeared in two of Linklater's previous films. Mackey died in 2004.

Cindy manages to get through Billy's challenge, but is threatened with the safety of Tom and his children, who are put to traps. Looking at a toilet with the "heart" nearby, Cindy realizes that Billy, through Henry's wife, is the true father of Toshio. Seeing how far Tom would save his children, Billy apologizes for the invasion and releases them.

She is instructed by Amanda to keep him alive until another victim has completed his game. The other victim Jeff, wakes up in a box and learns that he must undergo tests which will lead him to the man who killed his son Dylan in a drunk driving accident. Jeff became unstable and vengeful as a result and now neglects his daughter.  Jeff's first test leads him into a meat freezer. He finds Danica Scott, the only witness of Dylan's death, who refused to testify in court; she is stripped naked and chained at the wrists between two poles which begin spraying her with ice-cold water. Jeff attempts to reach the key which is behind the frozen bars as Danica manages to convince Jeff to help her, but she freezes to death before he can retrieve it.

It is only when John suffers a seizure that Amanda is willing to cooperate with Lynn. During the surgery, John hallucinates about [[Jill Tuck|another woman]] and declares his love out loud. This upsets Amanda and when she leaves, she finds a letter which drives her to hysterics. Amanda returns with the news that Jeff has completed his tests, but refuses to remove Lynn's collar. She reveals that she no longer believes in John's philosophy which is why her traps are inescapable. She also reveals that she fought with Detective Matthews after he escaped the bathroom and left him for dead.  Refusing to listen to John's warnings, Amanda shoots Lynn just as Jeff arrives. The latter, who is revealed to be Lynn's husband, retaliates by shooting Amanda with a gun provided by John after his tests. As Amanda dies, John reveals that Lynn's test was actually hers: aware of her modus operandi, and unwilling to allow a murderer to inherit his legacy, he decided to test her. John then addresses Jeff, offering to call an ambulance for Lynn if he accepts one last test: he can choose to kill John or forgive him. Jeff tells John he forgives him, but slashes his throat with a power saw. The door to the room seals as John plays a final tape, which tells Jeff that he has failed his test by killing John, the only person who knows the whereabouts of his daughter. The tape ends as John dies, and the collar detonates and kills Lynn, leaving Jeff trapped in the room.

Save the Last Dance 2
 The film continues the story of Sara Johnson (originally played by [[Julia Stiles]] and now portrayed by [[Izabella Miko]]). She recalls how she was born to be a dancer. Her mother would often comment that she knew how to pirouette before she could properly walk. From her earliest memories Sara always wanted to be a ballerina, a graceful dancer who could glide across the stage. It seemed that there was something that caused conflict in Sara’s ambition. She also loves the urban dance form of hip-hop. While ballet is highly structured, full of rules and standards, hip-hop gives Sara a chance to let go and follow the beat. Sara wants the best of both worlds but the conflict between structure and independence affects her performance in both genres.   The film is set soon after the original. Sara has made the first part of her dream come true. Her audition with the [[Juilliard School]] of Dance worked out well and she was accepted, resulting in her moving from Chicago to New York City. Sara would soon find out that as rough as it was to get there, staying would require raising the bar to almost painful heights. Her idol and ballet instructor, Monique Delacroix (Jacqueline Bisset), is old school when it comes to demanding each student master the traditional and arduous curriculum. She has little to no use for the influence of any other form of dance on ballet, so the concept of hip-hop is not only foreign to the staid teacher, it is repugnant.   During orientation on her first day at Juilliard, Sara meets Miles Sultana (Columbus Short), who takes her for a trombone player. When she tells him she is there for ballet, he questions whether she is a ballerina. Sara boldly states that she is already a ballerina; she is there to become a prima ballerina. This sets up a playful antagonism that later develops into a romantic relationship. Sara also has to deal with the students at her new school. In a high pressure school like Juilliard, the more favor you gather with the teachers the more jealousy you encounter from the students. It is a cut-throat environment with an extremely high failure rate.  Among her new classmates is Marcus (Matthew Watling), who infuriates Delacroix the first day for wearing pants that 'swish'. Then there is Katrina (Maria Brooks), who is destined to be the main rival for Sara. It also turns out that Miles is actually her guest lecturer for 'Introduction to Hip-Hop Theory'. Miles invites Sara and her new roommate Zoe to a club, where Sara demonstrates her skills by having a dance off with local dance star and club favorite Candy (Tracey "Tre" Armstrong). Due to her late night partying, she is late for her ballet class and is scolded and punished by Ms Delacroix.  Struggling to stay, Sara tries to save herself from being dismissed by working extremely hard, which makes her decline Miles's request for her to design choreography for an art exhibit he's involved with. In pain and desperation, Sara takes pills offered to her by Katrina to lose weight and relieve the pain in her joints. After vomiting in Delacroix's office and having the pills noted in the bucket, she is assured that she is not being cut and advised not to take them anymore. She continues to work hard and improves daily. She also agrees to help Miles with his project.   Delacroix properly supports her after Sara demonstrates her talent, causing Katrina to become even more jealous. Katrina gets the lead in ''[[Giselle]]'', but is injured during practice. Sara must now take her part, which is extremely technically demanding. Sara works relentlessly, struggling between her two commitments. Katrina, in a final act of revenge, reveals Sara's relationship with Miles to Delacroix. It is revealed that Delacroix is Miles's mother. She discusses Sara's future with Miles and encourages him to end their relationship so it doesn't interfere with her fulfilling her dreams.  Sara withdraws from her participation in the gallery project and focuses on the ballet performance. During rehearsal, she is confronted by Zoe and Miles's friend Franz (Ian Brennan) about refusing to assist with the gallery project even though Miles is struggling. Zoe angrily accuses Sara of becoming Delacroix. Sara is also informed that the dress rehearsal for the gallery project is on the night of her ballet performance and no one from that group will be able to see her as Giselle. Right before the ballet performance, Zoe comes and apologizes for her behavior and delivers a CD from Miles of him playing piano. She performs her role as Giselle flawlessly, but finds in the end that she feels nothing despite her tremendous success. She declines to attend the afterparty full of industry luminaries and tells Delacroix that she is not willing to sacrifice love, friendship, and happiness for ballet. She leaves and goes to the dress rehearsal, makes up with Miles, and performs the piece she choreographed, finally looking happy.

Scoop (2006 film)
 Following the memorial service for investigative reporter Joe Strombel (McShane), Strombel's spirit finds himself on the [[Charon (mythology)|barge of death]] with several others, including a young woman who believes she was poisoned by her employer, Peter Lyman (Jackman). The woman tells Strombel she thinks Lyman, a handsome British [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] with political ambitions, may be the [[Tarot]] Card Killer, a notorious [[serial killer]] of [[prostitute]]s, and that he killed her when she stumbled onto his secret. The Tarot Card Killer left a card on each murder victim's body.  Sondra Pransky (Johansson) is a beautiful but awkward American journalism student on vacation in [[London]]. Pransky attends a performance given by magician Sid Waterman (Allen), aka "The Great Splendini", and agrees to participate onstage. While in a booth known as The Dematerializer, Pransky encounters Strombel's ghost. The ghost has escaped the [[Grim Reaper]] himself to impart his suspicions of Lyman to a journalist who can investigate the story. Sondra decides to infiltrate Lyman's privileged world and find out if he truly is the dreaded criminal, enlisting Sid in the process and taking advantage of his powers of deception.  Sondra catches Lyman's attention by pretending to drown near him at an exclusive club's swimming pool. When he rescues her, she introduces herself as Jade Spence, daughter of a wealthy oil family from [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]]. While Sid poses as her father, "Jade" begins dating Lyman. Sondra is convinced Lyman is the murderer, but Sid finds it hard to believe. Sondra gradually falls in love with Lyman and begins to trust him. Sid meanwhile becomes less sanguine about Lyman as he notices more and more inconsistencies, especially after Sondra finds a [[Tarot]] deck hidden under a French horn in Peter's vault, a climate-controlled music room containing expensive antique musical instruments. Sid finally prevails upon Sondra to write a news story implicating Lyman, but the newspaper editor rejects the story because of Sondra's lack of proof. Throughout their investigation, Sid and Sondra have a relationship that is in turns friendly, paternal, and antagonistic—fueled largely by Sondra's annoyance that her smooth "Jade Spence" charade is being compromised by Sid's obnoxious attempts to act the part of a nouveau riche oil baron.  Soon the police arrest the real Tarot Card Killer. Sondra, relieved that her suspicions were for naught, reveals her real name and the deception she and Sid had practiced. Lyman is surprisingly gracious, and tells Sondra he wants to keep seeing her. They plan to spend the weekend at Lyman's isolated country estate. Later, Sid (at Strombel's urging) suggests that Lyman used the Tarot Card murders to cover up a murder he committed.  While Sondra and Lyman vacation in the country, Sid continues to investigate this theory. He finds that Lyman did frequent a prostitute, Betty Gibson, who was later killed, apparently by the Tarot Card Killer. Gibson is described as a "baby-faced blonde" (just like Sondra) before Lyman convinced her to dye her hair, presumably to match the profile of the other Tarot victims. When Sid calls Sondra with his findings, she waves them off. Unbeknownst to her, Lyman is listening in on another extension.  Sid breaks into Lyman's vault again, this time finding a mysterious key, which turns out to be to Betty Gibson's flat. Meanwhile, in a rowboat on Lyman's lake, Lyman confesses to Sondra that he killed Gibson to stop her from blackmailing him and used the Tarot Card pattern to allay suspicion, just as Strombel had told Sid. Lyman comments on the irony that he first met Sondra by saving her from drowning, and now she really would drown. He would kill Sid later; no one would connect an obscure stage magician's death to that of a clumsy journalism student. This scene is intercut with shots of Sid driving madly to the Lyman estate to rescue Sondra, ultimately ending in a car crash.  After his confession, Lyman throws Sondra into the lake and watches her go under. He then calls the police to report her drowning death. When they question him, he tells them Sondra was a terrible swimmer and almost drowned that first day at the pool. Suddenly, Sondra enters, soaking wet but smiling cheerfully. She informs Lyman and the police that the drowning had been an act to get his attention, and actually she was a very good swimmer.  Back in the newspaper offices, the editor who previously rejected Sondra's article now congratulates Sondra on a brilliant piece of investigative journalism, the start of a promising career. Sondra seems flattered, and says she must also credit Joe Strombel and the late Sid Waterman, Splendini, who is now a passenger on the Reaper's ship, performing for his fellow spirits the same magical gags and comedy routines he did in life.  
The Science of Sleep
  Stéphane Miroux is a man whose vivid dreams and imagination often interfere with his ability to interact with reality. He is coaxed back to his childhood home after his divorced father passes away and his mother, Christine, finds him a job in a calendar printing company in [[France]]. His mother implies the position is a creative role, and he prepares colourful drawings, each showing a disaster, for his "disasterology" calendar. However, nobody appreciates his talents and it transpires that his mother had led him on - the real vacancy is for nothing more than mundane [[typesetting]] [[Wage labour|work]]. While leaving his apartment to go to work one day, Stéphane injures his hand helping his new neighbor move a piano into her apartment. The new neighbor, Stéphanie, invites Stéphane into her apartment (unaware that he lives next door) where her friend Zoé tends to his wound. Stéphane initially forms an attraction to Zoé, though he suspects it is instead Stéphanie who likes him.  Stéphane realizes that Stéphanie, like him, is creative and artistic. They plan a project for use in a short animated film. Following the advice of Guy, Stéphane's sex-obsessed co-worker, Stéphane pretends that he isn't Stéphanie's neighbor, pretending to leave the building when he leaves her apartment. That night, when he is sleepwalking he writes a confusing note to Stéphanie that asks for Zoé's phone number. Stéphane realizes his mistake upon waking and retrieves the letter with a coat hanger, unaware that Stéphanie has already read it.  [[Surrealism|Surrealistic]] and [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] elements begin to overlap, and the viewer is often uncertain of which portions constitute reality and which are merely dreams. One such sequence, in which Stéphane dreams his hands become absurdly giant, was inspired by a recurring nightmare director [[Michel Gondry]] had as a child.<ref></ref> As this line gradually becomes more blurred, Stéphane becomes more enamoured with Stéphanie the more he spends time with her and shares his many inventions with her, such as the "one-second [[Time travel|time machine]]," a device that can go either forward or backward in time by only one second. Stéphane's dreams encroach on his waking life as he tries to win Stéphanie's heart and misses time at work. He breaks into her apartment, taking her stuffed toy horse, and implants a mechanism inside of it that will make it gallop. While putting it back into her apartment, Stéphanie arrives and catches him, demanding he leaves and becoming more upset with him. Embarrassed and heartbroken, Stéphane retreats to his own apartment where he receives a call from Stéphanie, who apologizes and thanks him for the gift she discovers: a galloping version of "Golden the Pony Boy," who she reveals was named after Stéphane.  As the months go by, waking and dreaming become even more intermixed. To Stéphane's surprise, the calendar manufacturer accepts his "Disastrology" idea and it becomes a great success. A party is thrown in his honour, but he becomes depressed and begins drinking excessively after he witnesses Stéphanie dancing flirtatiously with another man. The next day, Stéphane and Stéphanie have a confrontation in their hallway when Stéphane announces that he doesn't want to be Stéphanie's friend any longer. Stéphanie becomes very upset, offering Zoé's phone number and reciting Stéphane's note. Stéphane, still unaware that Stéphanie has read the note, assumes that they are connected through "Parallel Synchronized Randomness", a rare phenomenon he has examined in his dreams. Stéphanie offers that they discuss their issues on a date, but on Stéphane's walk to the café to meet her, he has a frightful vision that she isn't there and she doesn't love him after all. He runs back to her apartment and bangs on her door, demanding that she stop torturing him; in actuality, she is indeed waiting for him at the café. Stéphane runs at her door, attempting to break it down, but winds up bashing his head and collapsing in the hall, where his mother eventually finds him bleeding.  Tired of waiting, Stéphanie returns home while Stéphane, coaxed by his mother and her friend, decides to move back to [[Mexico]].  Before leaving, Stéphane's mother insists that he say goodbye to Stéphanie. In his attempt to do so, he becomes extremely crass, making sexual and offensive jokes to her, and accusing her of never being able to finish something she starts. However, he reveals that he is truly interested in her because she's different from other people. As his antagonistic behavior pushes her to her breaking point, Stéphanie asks Stéphane to leave but he instead climbs into her bed and yells at her, before spotting two items on her bedside: his one-second time machine, and the finished boat they had planned to use in their animated film. Stéphane falls asleep in Stéphanie's bed. As she checks on him to see why he has become so quiet, she gently strokes his hair. The film closes with Stéphane and Stéphanie riding Golden the Pony Boy across a field before sailing off into the ocean's horizon in her white boat.  
Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy!
 Fred is treating the Mystery Inc. gang to share in his birthday present: a mystery cruise, compliments of his parents Skip and Peggy. While preparing for the ship launch, Scooby and Shaggy have a creepy encounter with a sinister-looking cloaked man, whom the duo are sure is up to no good. The gang meet the hyper Cruise Director, Sunny St. Cloud, and the captain, Captain Crothers. The Captain says they are bound for the Bermuda Triangle, and St. Cloud promises some creepy intrigue. A montage of sloppy "mysteries" that are staged by St. Cloud and Captain Crothers follow, which the gang solves with ease. This peeves the other guests, who have no mysteries to solve now. Soon they rescue Rupert Garcia, a man lost at sea, who tells of an encounter with ghost pirates. The gang naturally assumes that this is a setup to another mystery. He is taken below deck as a man in a jetpack appears from the sky and lands on deck. He turns out to be Biff Wellington, an English billionaire who is known to be fun-loving yet eccentric. He plans to stay on the ship as well.  That night, the gang attends a costume party dinner. The creepy cloaked man appears on stage, who turns out to be Mister Mysterio, a famous hypnotist. Shaggy and Scooby are picked from the audience to demonstrate his powers, but they prove immune to his hypnotism: yet the audience falls under the trance. Mysterio dispels the hypnotism and disappears in a puff of smoke. The creepy fog then engulfs the cruise ship. The ghost pirates wreak havoc, chasing the cruise guests, who all mysteriously disappear. Skip and Peggy are kidnapped, and the pirates retreat back to the galleon and leave (after destroying the cruise ship). At this time, the gang realizes it is a real mystery, and they and Garcia are the only ones left aboard the damaged ship.  With his help, they follow the glowing trail left behind by the galleon and arrive in a secret harbor. There, they find Garcia's old ship, and then are captured by the ghost pirates, who take them aboard their galleon. The pirates are looking to find a meteor of mystic power, which fell into the triangle ages ago and could be pinpointed using Garcia's map. The gang is tied to the mast along with Skip, but there are no other cruise guests around.  The galleon enters the heart of the triangle, and begins to see past ghosts from the triangle: The [[USS Cyclops (AC-4)|USS ''Cyclops'']], [[Flight 19]], even a sea serpent. Amidst this, the gang manages to escape and explore below deck. They find a lot of modern equipment that was  used to project the ghostly images just witnessed. The ship enters an odd ring of rocks, and pulls up the meteor, which glows golden yellow.  The gang then engineer a trap, which fails. The pirates then attempt to re-capture the gang, leading to a trademark Scooby-Doo chase sequence, in which the entire pirate crew are captured by Scooby and Shaggy. Captain Skunkbeard is revealed to be Wellington, and Wally is revealed to be Mysterio. The rest of the pirates turn out to be the cruise guests (including the Captain, St. Cloud and Peggy), shipmates of Garcia, and past conquests of the pirates. Wellington explains that Mysterio convinced him that he was the reincarnation of a pirate years ago, and could use the meteor to teleport back in time. The crew were just hypnosis victims under Mysterio's power. Mysterio's motive was that the meteor itself was pure gold and he was going to steal it to make himself rich. Mysterio, still free, attempts to take the meteor for himself, but is stopped by Scooby.  At this time, a fierce storm hits, and the gang deduces the forces of the triangle want the meteor back, so they drop it back in the water, and some steering by Fred narrowly gets the galleon out of the ring as it crumbles into the sea. The cruise guests use the galleon as a large party boat as they sail back to Miami to drop off the villains to the authorities.  
School for Scoundrels (2006 film)
 Roger ([[Jon Heder]]) is a downtrodden [[Meter maid|meter reader]], subject to ridicule from co-workers and regular denizens, who dreams of dating the [[Foreign exchange student|foreign graduate student]] who lives in his building, Amanda ([[Jacinda Barrett]]). To overcome his lack of self-esteem, he signs up for a course taught by Dr. P ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) where Roger and his classmates are constantly bullied by Dr. P and his assistant Lesher ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), who likes to use outrageous and unethical methods on them, including humiliation. Some tasks they are required to do are quite cruel and primitive – like the task to start a conflict or even a fight with somebody they meet just to prove they are fearless. However, nobody intends to quit the course because Dr. P says he won't give a refund of $5,000 to anyone who quits or disobeys the orders given to them. The classmates even warn Roger that Dr. P will destroy him if his progress is too fast, just like he has done to one of his former students.   While participating, Roger begins to develop a sense of personal pride and finally asks Amanda for a date where he uses tricks he learned during the course. Wanting to prove that he's still got his edge, Dr. P starts competing with Roger for Amanda. He approaches her with a false story that he is a successful and child-loving surgeon whose wife has died, and Amanda, who is a voluntary caretaker for animals, is immediately attracted and starts dating him. When Roger begins to see what's happening, he decides to take action to get Amanda back, although his actions are futile. After a competitive tennis match in which Roger humiliates him, Dr. P enlists the talents of Roger's classmates to break into Amanda's apartment and paint graffiti on the walls so he could frame Roger as a [[Stalking|stalker]]. Roger uses his authority as a meter reader to impound Dr. P's car, and in retaliation Dr. P gets Roger fired from his job.  Roger learns of Dr. P's plans for Amanda, from Lonnie ([[Ben Stiller]]), a depressed former student, whose girlfriend was also led astray when he was humiliated by Dr. P. Lonnie shows Roger a [[fascicle (publishing)|fascicle]] full of evidence that Dr. P is a fraud, who uses [[Multiple identity|multiple identities]] and false stories to attract or distract his victims. After learning that Dr. P invited Amanda to Miami, Roger is determined to stop him once for all. He heads for the airport where Dr. P tells him he is a winner and grants him two tickets – one for him and one for Amanda. However, Roger at first doesn't know that Dr. P has sent him to the wrong gate. After realizing he was again tricked by Dr. P, Roger heads to the right gate and boards the plane to Miami in the last moment. With the aid of Lonnie and classmates, he finally exposes Dr. P's duplicity, it's revealed that Dr. P isn't a doctor or surgeon (he wanted to use a [[defibrillator]] on Roger who just fainted, but was truly faking) and that his wife is still alive. Amanda finally realizes she was wrong and returns to Roger. When meeting Roger after some time, Dr. P grants him a diploma for passing his course – the first diploma ever issued by him. He also invites Roger to attend one of his future courses as a guest, but Roger refuses. The film closes with a summary of what happened to most characters after the film's events.

He-Man confronts Adora and the Sword of Protection glows in her presence, revealing that she is the one he's looking for - unfortunately this distraction allows the Horde to knock He-Man out and capture him.  Madame Razz uses divination to discover that the Horde have taken He-Man to their prison complex on Beast Island and the Rebels head there to attempt a rescue.  In the prison, Adora interrogates He-Man and agrees that the sword seems to be meant for her, to which He-Man retorts that he is to give it to someone who serves good rather than evil.  As it turns out Adora thinks the Rebels are evil and the Horde the rightful, benevolent rulers of Etheria, although she admits to not knowing much about life outside the Horde's base.  When He-Man dares her to see for herself what life on Etheria is really like, Adora says she'll think about it.  The Rebels arrive on Beast Island and manage to get into the prison to find He-Man, only to get captured and imprisoned themselves.  Luckily, Kowl manages to elude capture and frees He-Man, who then frees the others and destroys the prison. In the meanwhile, Adora has ventured into the towns outside the Fright Zone and sees first-hand the cruelties Etheria's citizens are forced to endure at the hands of the Horde.  As Hordak and Shadow Weaver discuss how He-Man is too powerful a threat to ignore, they are confronted by Adora wielding the Sword of Protection.  She has discovered how cruel the Horde truly are, but Shadow Weaver enchants Adora into a mystic sleep that will make her forget what she learned and takes the sword, planning to learn its secrets.  Later, Hordak shows the Horde his latest weapon the Magna-Beam, a willpower-fueled transporter that will allow him to send the entire Rebel base into exile forever.  However, none of the Horde's captives have sufficient willpower to fully charge the machine.  He-Man sneaks into the Horde base looking for Adora, but Adora once again thinks he's the villain and arrests him.  Hordak then has He-Man put in the Magna-Beam to charge it overnight.  Late that night, Adora has nightmares about He-Man's fate and hears a voice calling her name.  She discovers the Sorceress talking to her through the Sword of Protection and convinces her to help He-Man, whom the Sorceress reveals is not only the good guy but also Adora's twin brother.  Instructed to hold aloft the sword and say "For the Honour of Grayskull!", Adora is transformed into the superpowered She-Ra, Princess of Power.  After she rescues and revives He-Man, the pair destroy the Magna-Beam and make their getaway on Adora's horse Spirit, who in She-Ra's presence is transformed into a talking winged unicorn named Swift Wind.  She-Ra then reveals that she is He-Man's sister, leaving him confused as he's sure he doesn't have a sister.  When She-Ra explains that she was told by the 'woman in the sword', He-Man uses the Sword of Protection to contact the Sorceress and she explains everything:  When Adam and Adora were born to King Randor and Queen Marlena, Eternia was invaded by the Horde.  Unable to defeat the combined might of the Eternian army and the magic of Castle Grayskull, Hordak plotted to demoralize them by kidnapping the newborn royals, aided by his favorite pupil (and He-Man's future archenemy) Skeletor.  Although the kidnapping was interrupted by Man-At-Arms, Hordak escaped with Adora and ultimately fled through a Time Gate.  The Sorceress was unable to discover which dimension Hordak took Adora to, so she cast a spell that wiped all memory of Adora from the people of Eternia except for herself, Man-At-Arms, King Randor and Queen Marlena. Thus Adam was raised unaware of his sister's existence.  Convinced by the Sorceress' story, He-Man happily accepts She-Ra as his sister.  Returning to the Rebel camp as Adam and Adora, the Rebellion accept Adora into their ranks after learning that Adora was mind-controlled into serving the Horde.  The Rebels have also discovered that Queen Angella, rightful ruler of the kingdom of Bright Moon, is being held prisoner on nearby Talon Mountain, so Adam and Adora volunteer to rescue her.  As He-Man and She-Ra, they defeat Queen Angella's jailer Hunga the Harpy Queen and reunite her with her people (including her daughter Glimmer).  Adam takes Adora back to Eternia to reunite with their parents, but Hordak has found out that Adora is with the Rebels and pursues them through the Time Gate.  Finding himself  back on Eternia, Hordak goes to his old base on Snake Mountain and discovers that Skeletor is now the principal villain of Eternia.  Skeletor is not pleased to see his old mentor, but upon learning that Hordak is after Adora agrees to help him to be rid of him.  Magically disguised as cooks and with Hordak hidden inside a giant cake, Skeletor and his henchmen manage to infiltrate the royal palace and kidnap Adora.  As Man-At-Arms, Teela and He-Man reassure the distraught king and queen that they will save Adora, Skeletor betrays Hordak and forces him back to Etheria, planning to ransom Adora himself.  However, Adora manages to outwit her captors and, reclaiming her sword, deals with the villains as She-Ra before running into the rescue party.  As He-Man introduces She-Ra to the others and helps her to convince them that Adora is safe, Skeletor is left bemoaning "A female He-Man!  This is the worst day of my life!"  Adora decides to return to Etheria to aid the Rebellion, a decision accepted by her family, and the Sorceress sends Adora and Spirit back to Etheria, telling them they can use the Sword of Protection to summon aid from Eternia should they ever need it.  Adam and Cringer tag along, offering to "help [Adora] get the Rebellion off to a big start".  As He-Man and She-Ra, the twins help the Rebels liberate Bright Moon, learning more about She-Ra's powers in the process (including using empathy to communicate with the wild animals of the Whispering Woods and healing Swift Wind when he's shot by the Horde).  He-Man and Battle Cat then return to Eternia, while She-Ra and Swift Wind resolve to stay until all of Etheria is free.

Seducing Mr. Perfect
 Min-june ([[Uhm Jung-hwa]]) is a believer in true love and always very dedicated to her current boyfriend. However, men always break up with her - her latest boyfriend ends their relationship on his birthday. Distracted by the latest break-up, she bumps into a car and a man steps out of it - who turns out to be her new boss, Robin Heiden ([[Daniel Henney]]). Heiden has very clear ideas about a relationship and love: both are a game of power and Min-june seeks advice from him, as she doesn't want to get dumped again. However, when she starts to treat men like Heiden treats women, she realizes that she prefers her older behavior, even if that means that she gets dumped again; she doesn't see love as a game of power and never will. Heiden, who has to deal with his own heartbreak, as he loved a woman so much that she had to shoot him to get the message across that she wasn't interested in him, starts to soften at Min-june's attitude towards life. He eventually falls in love with her and both get into a real relationship and a happy ending of their own. Finally, Instead of trying to make her understand that love is a game of power, he learnt from her that it is the purest language of hearts; no need of rehearsals, judgements, hidings at all.   One of the unique concepts of the movie is that Robin Heiden speaks only English because he finds Korean hard to speak, while Min-june speaks mostly in Korean. The two seem to understand each other perfectly without any outside translation, although in the film it is explained by one of Heiden's employees that Heiden was multilingual and understood Korean but had difficulty speaking it. This was a new style of dialogue for Korean films, and it is partially credited for the film's success.

The Sentinel (2006 film)
 Pete Garrison ([[Michael Douglas]]) is a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and one of the personal bodyguards for [[First Lady of the United States]] Sarah Ballentine ([[Kim Basinger]]), with whom he is having an affair. He is one of the oldest and most experienced agents, having been involved in [[Reagan assassination attempt|saving Ronald Reagan's life]]. His close friend and fellow agent, Charlie Merriweather ([[Clark Johnson]]), is murdered. Garrison gets word from a trusted [[informant]] that the killing of Merriweather is related to an assassination plot against the President. The intelligence provided by the informant reveals the presence of a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] with access to the President's security detail.  The Secret Service Protective Intelligence Division, led by Garrison's estranged friend and former [[Mentoring|protégé]] David Breckinridge ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]), with [[rookie]] partner Jill Marin ([[Eva Longoria]]), is tasked with investigating the plot. Breckinridge orders every agent to be subjected to a [[polygraph]] test. Meanwhile, the mole discovers the discussion with the informant and Garrison's affair with the first lady, and attempts to blackmail Garrison by luring him to a coffee shop known to be a meeting point for a Colombian cartel. After delaying for some time, Garrison is subjected to a polygraph. The agent in charge of the Presidential Protective Division, William Montrose ([[Martin Donovan]]), decides to randomly select the means of transporting the president using a coin toss. As the President and first lady visit [[Camp David]], Garrison's informant calls, demanding that his payment be made at a shopping mall food court. Garrison goes to meet him, but he disappears in the crowd, and an assassin tries to kill Garrison. The agents pursue the assassin, but he escapes. Simultaneously, the [[Marine One|presidential helicopter]] is shot down by a surface-to-air missile outside of Camp David, though neither the President nor his wife were aboard (due to Montrose's coin "deciding" to use the [[motorcade]] instead).   Garrison failed the polygraph test due to concealing his affair with the First Lady. Breckinridge confronts him at his home and interrogates him, pinning him as the prime suspect. The source of rancor between them comes to light: Breckinridge believes Garrison had an affair with his wife and caused the breakup of their marriage, which Garrison denies. Garrison escapes capture and conducts his own investigation of the assassination plot. He tries to contact the informant who gave him the tip, but finds that he has been killed. In pursuit, Breckinridge gets the drop on Garrison but is unable to kill him, despite having given other agents "shoot to kill" orders. Using his contacts with sympathetic agents and family members, Garrison tracks down the location of one of the assassins, whom he kills in a firefight. He searches his apartment, finding evidence that shows the perpetrators are headed to [[Toronto]] to attack the president at a [[G8]] summit. He leaves it in the apartment and tells Marin about it, but the Secret Service find the evidence and body of the assassin were removed before they arrived.  The President's wife discloses her affair with Garrison to Breckinridge, who now understands why Garrison failed his polygraph test. Together in Toronto, Garrison and Breckinridge discover the identity of the assassins and the mole, senior agent William Montrose ([[Martin Donovan]]), who was never polygraphed. Montrose is in charge of directing security at the summit. The leader of the assassins ([[Ritchie Coster]]) blackmails Montrose into helping him, threatening the agent's family. Emotionally torn, Montrose is instructed to jam Secret Service's radios, and leave the summit with the President via a specific route.  On the night of the President's speech, Breckinridge and Garrison race to the summit. The assassins, posing as [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] [[Emergency Response Team (RCMP)|Emergency Response Team]] officers, kill several agents and corner Montrose and the President in a subterranean tunnel. Montrose reveals his treason to the President and purposely steps in front of one of the assassins, who kills him. Garrison, Breckinridge and Marin arrive, rescuing the President and the First Lady and killing the assassins. As they reach the ground level, Montrose's handler comes forward dressed as an RCMP officer to personally perform the killings. He takes Sarah hostage and aims his pistol at the President, but Garrison shoots him dead. In spite of these events, Garrison is forced to take an early retirement due to the disclosure of his affair with the first lady, who looks on sadly from her window as Garrison leaves the [[White House]]. He does, however, make peace with Breckinridge, who finally realizes that Garrison did not sleep with his wife. Breckinridge tells Garrison that he has a date with her that evening.

Severance (film)
 The film opens with George ([[David Gilliam]]) and two women (Juli Drajkó and Judit Viktor) running through the woods. The women fall into a large [[trapping pit|pit trap]] while George is caught by a [[Snare trap|snare]]. As he hangs helplessly, a masked man approaches and disembowels him with a knife.  What is later revealed as some days prior to this, the European Sales division of Palisade Defence military arms corporation are on a bus to a team-building weekend at a "luxury lodge" in the [[Mátra]] Mountains of [[Hungary]]. When a fallen tree blocking the road halts the bus's progress, the driver (Sándor Boros) refuses to take a dirt road through the woods and, after an argument, drives off leaving the group to walk the remaining distance to the lodge.  Eventually the group reaches the lodge, which is old and in serious disrepair, but the manager Richard ([[Tim McInnerny]]) convinces the wary but tired group to enter. Inside, Harris ([[Toby Stephens]]) discovers a file cabinet full of cryptic Palisade documents, written in Russian. The group discusses the documents, leading Harris to relate a story he'd heard about the lodge: the lodge was previously a mental institution, and in the early 20th century a Palisade-made [[nerve gas]] was used to clear it out after the inmates took over. Jill ([[Claudie Blakley]]) responds with the story she'd heard: the lodge was a "reeducation center" for Russian war criminals, and after an escape a Palisade-made nerve gas was used to clear escapees out of nearby buildings. Both mention a lone survivor who swore revenge on Palisade. Steve ([[Danny Dyer]]) starts to tell his own story about the lodge's past as a clinic staffed by busty nurses when he finds a human tooth in the meat pie the group is eating for dinner. Chastising Gordon ([[Andy Nyman]]) for serving a pie he just found in the kitchen, everyone goes to bed.  That night Jill sees someone looking into the lodge from the trees. Though nobody is found outside, everyone but Richard agrees that they should leave the lodge. The next morning Richard grudgingly sends Harris and Jill to the top of the hill to call the bus driver back, on the condition that the rest participate in a team-building game of [[paintball]]. Reaching the hill, Harris and Jill find the bus abandoned and the bus driver dead in a nearby creek. Back at the lodge, the game of paintball has just finished when Gordon steps into a [[animal trapping|bear trap]]. After several failed attempts by Steve and Billy (Babou Ceesayu) to pry the trap open, Gordon's left leg is cut through completely under the knee. Harris and Jill arrive in the bus, load everyone in and head back for town. On the way, a [[spike strip]] is thrown in front of the bus, which causes it to crash. Harris is thrown clear of the bus in the crash, and is decapitated by a masked killer with a [[machete]]. Jill is captured and tied to a tree, then gagged, doused with gasoline and burned alive. The rest discover Harris's body, prompting them to head for the lodge to hide for the night.  While Steve and Maggie ([[Laura Harris]]) smoke, a masked figure (Levente Törköly) "quietly" grabs Gordon and carries him into the basement. Discovering Gordon's absence and a newly opened door, the four head into the basement which leads to an underground prison. Through one door Billy and Maggie find the now-dead Gordon who has had the Palisade logo carved into his torso and a now-unmasked killer who fires a [[shotgun]] at them. The two hide in a nearby cell, where Billy dies from a chest wound. Steve hides on the second floor while Richard escapes out the back into the woods. While the killer searches for Steve, Maggie sneaks up on him with a large knife she took from the prison in the basement, but she falls through the rickety floor. The killer turns round and takes aim at Maggie, but, at the last second, Steve saves her by impaling the killer through the back. The killer falls down and becomes lodged in the main level floor, and Maggie takes his shotgun and shoots the killer in the head.  Maggie and Steve exit the lodge believing they are safe, but discover that a group of several more armed, Russian-speaking killers are awaiting them outside. Maggie shoots one before he can fire on them, and the two run into the woods. They come across Richard, who has stepped on a Palisade-made [[land mine]] and cannot move without detonating it. Richard guides Maggie and Steve through the minefield. The killers know that the area is a minefield and do not enter; they use a fallen branch to pass over the minefield close to Richard and torment him with insults and stones as they pass overhead. Accepting his situation Richard does his best to save the others and steps off the mine, blowing up himself along with two of the killers. Steve and Maggie come to another lodge, the ''real'' Palisade lodge. Inside they find their boss George, who is partying with two escorts Steve ordered via the Internet earlier. George brings out a prototype missile launcher and fires it at the approaching killers, but the missile locks on to a passing commercial jet instead, destroying it. The five run into the woods, leading to the events shown in the beginning of the film.  Maggie is snared, then about to be molested by a killer, but manages to smash his head with a rock. Steve encounters two attackers and gets beaten and stabbed, but eventually kills them both with a knife and a [[submachine gun]]. Maggie is chased by a [[flamethrower]]-wielding killer into an abandoned prison camp, filled with crates bearing the Palisade logo. There, Maggie breaks her leg, but is saved when one of the escorts, rescued by Steve, arrives and shoots the man. Steve, Maggie and the escorts make it to a rowboat on the shore of the nearby lake, and as they paddle off to safety Steve jokingly quips, "[[Foursome (group sex)|Foursome]]?"

Forrester denies this, but claims that Grant and Strictland have been engaging in illegal [[animal experimentation]]. This distances Douglas from his daughter Carly ([[Zena Grey]]), one of Forrester's students. As Dave is also a workaholic, his relationship with his wife, Rebecca, and son, Josh, are also strained, although Dave and Rebecca's marriage were already on the rocks, as Dave committed adultery merely only six months prior to the prosecution.  The greedy [[geneticist]]s working for Mr. Lance Strictland ([[Philip Baker Hall]]), led by Dr. Kozak ([[Robert Downey, Jr.]]), have stolen a 300-year-old [[Vajrayana Buddhism in Southeast Asia#Candi Sukuh|sacred dog]] named Khyi Yang Po (a [[Bearded Collie]]) from a [[Tibet]]an monastery. The scientists determine that Khyi Yang Po's genetic sequence, when isolated and put into a vaccination, invades and alters the cells and DNA of a victim. They continue their experiments two of which are a frog-pug hybrid and a cobra-dog hybrid in hopes of uncovering the genetic component that allows Khyi Yang Po such a long life, potentially immortality. Khyi Yang Po escapes the lab and is picked up by Carly, who was protesting with her friends and classmates outside Grant and Strictland.  Carly brings Khyi Yang Po home. When Dave returns from work, he takes Khyi Yang Po out in the garage, then the dog runs to get the newspaper. Khyi Yang Po gives him his newspaper, and Dave reaches for it, only to be bitten on the hand by Khyi Yang Po. Khyi Yang Po's saliva infects Dave. Over the next few days, Dave realizes that he uncontrollably transforms into a sheep dog exactly like Khyi Yang Po when prompted by distractions and activities typical of a dog, such as a stick thrown through the air. These transformations can be reversed by sleeping, but Dave's human absence from his family further strains his relationships. During this time, his family, unaware of Dave's condition, continue housing Dave as a dog, thinking it's Khyi Yang Po. Dave slowly learns just how little he understands his kids and wife and resolves to make amends.  In the ongoing trial, Forrester testifies seeing the animals behaving like dogs and the presence of a bearded collie he identifies as a giant sheepdog, which sparks Dave's suspicions about Grant and Strictland. When his dog-like behavior annoys the judge, Dave is removed from the case. Seeking answers to his transformation, Dave heads to Grant and Strictland. He has a janitor help him transform so that he may sneak in through a vent. Hidden in the laboratory, Dave witnesses Dr. Kozak injecting company president Lance Strictland with a [[Induced coma|drug that will paralyze him]] for several months, giving Kozak enough time to usurp control of the company. After viewing security cameras, Kozak and his minions realize that Dave is capable of transforming into a copy of Khyi Yang Po.  When Dave comes home, still in his canine form, he overhears a conversation between Carly and Josh that he and Rebecca may be splitting up. After hearing this, Dave then knocks over a [[Scrabble|Scrabble game]] and uses the letters to reveal his identity to his kids. But when Dave gets out of the house, he is captured by Kozak's minions. His kids attempt to save him, but end up picking up the real Khyi Yang Po instead and rush to their mom at work to report recent events.  Dave is taken to the lab to be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]], but Kozak has a court summons, and must deal with Dave later. Right before he exits, Kozak mocks Dave in canine form and Dave bites him in response. The other mutated animals in the lab tell Dave to meditate to reverse his transformation. Dave succeeds in returning to human form, and is able to escape with all of the other animals. He drives to the courthouse and calls his wife to ready a change of clothes for him at the courthouse, but is forced to abandon the car with the animals when they get stuck in traffic. Dave runs on all fours to trigger his transformation to get to the courthouse in time. At the courthouse entrance, his attempts to tell his wife that he loves her allows him to transform back.  In the courtroom, Dave calls Kozak back to the stand and tries to get him to admit what he has done, but Kozak manages to hide his secret. Thinking quickly, he mocks Kozak by implying he was working under Strictland's shadow, and angers him. The two begin growling at each another, and the judge, exasperated by Dave's canine behavior, orders the [[bailiff]] to remove him. Dave grabs the baliff's baton and tells Kozak to fetch, triggering a partial transformation in him and thus implicating him of illegal and unethical experimentation. The pharmaceutical company is returned to Strictland, the mutant animals enter protective custody, and Dave finally makes amends with his family.  The movie ends with the family vacationing in Hawaii with Khyi Yang Po. Josh tells his dad to fetch a frisbee he just tossed, and Dave catches it with his mouth.  
Shadow Man (2006 film)
  Widowed former CIA agent Jack Foster (The Shadow Man) is an enigmatic Fortune 500 business owner, and is the father of an 8-year-old daughter named Amanda. It's the anniversary of the death of Jack's wife, and Jack is taking Amanda to Romania, which is the birthplace of Amanda's mother, who died 5 years ago. But upon arrival at the airport in Bucharest, Romania, a car bomb blows up his CIA agent father-in-law George's limo, and Amanda is kidnapped. In the chaos, Jack reunites with Harry, a former CIA buddy who has mysteriously reappeared after not seeing Jack for about 7 or 8 years. They take off to track Amanda down, but they lose her—and Jack is suspicious of Harry.  At a safe house, Harry leaves Jack locked in a secured room, and sends four men after Jack. Jack kills them, and then he escapes. Outside, Jack forces Harry to get inside of an SUV. Harry explains that it has to do with a biological weapon called MK Ultra. It's a virus that causes the infected person to come down with things like influenza, various forms of cancer, you name it. The infected died in 6 months to a year, and the virus is untraceable. George had the formula—he lifted it from the Black Ops section. He was planning on selling it to the highest bidder—the FSB, a new branch of the KGB. And now the FSB thinks George slipped the formula to Jack. Harry tells Jack that the FSB doesn't intend to let Amanda go until they get the formula.  Jack puts a gun to Harry's head, and gives Harry two hours to find Amanda. They go to the U.S. Embassy, where he talks to Ambassador Cochran, who wants him to find Amanda. Outside, two Romanian cops named Seaka and Urich put Jack in a car, and take him to the station. They introduce Jack to a woman named Anya, and Jack recognizes Anya as the woman who kidnapped Amanda. Jack is forced to beat up Seaka and Urich while Anya escapes. Later, Jack goes to a building where he is to meet with Harry, who has two men named Schmitt and Chambers with him. Chambers kills Harry, and Jack kills Chambers and exchanges gunfire with Schmitt, who escapes. At the place where Amanda is being held, Anya and Amanda talk, with Anya explaining that she took Amanda in order to protect her. Anya explains that her husband and daughter died three years ago while she was an intelligence agent in England. Her husband and her daughter were killed by people from her own agency.  Since Anya is a cab driver, Jack has a cab driver take him to Club Lido. Seaka and Urich get wind of it, and decide to send a couple of patrol cars to Club Lido. At the club, Jack sees Anya, and he confronts her in the women's restroom as Seaka, Urich, and the patrol cars arrive. Anya pulls a gun and demands a passport and passage to America in exchange for Amanda. Jack takes Anya to a different room, ties her to a chair, and demands answers. Schmitt arrives at the club and runs the cops off. A man named Jensen enters the room just as Jack hides, and demands to know where Amanda is, and then he wants to know where Jack is. Jensen and one of his men start looking for Jack, while Jensen's other two men stay with Anya. Jack and Anya beat up the two men, and head to Anya's car.  Seaka and Urich go to Anya's apartment, and tear the place apart, finding no one there. After Seaka and Urich leave, Jack and Anya arrive, and see a patrol car outside the building. They go around back. Once inside, Anya grabs some documents, and they ditch the two cops. What Jack and Anya don't know is that Schmitt is working for a corrupt CIA agent named Waters, who wants to sell the MK Ultra to the highest bidder. Seaka and Urich want to get their hands on the MK Ultra for the same reason. And it was Schmitt who oversaw the bombing of George's limo. Jack and Anya lie low for a night at a large house. On the next day, Schmitt and one of his men track down Cyrell, a wheelchair-using man who is watching over Amanda for Anya. Not long after, Seaka and Urich get there, and a few minutes later, Jack and Anya get there.  Jack and Anya go inside and find Cyrell dead. Amanda is not there. But Jack does find Amanda's backpack. Seaka and Urich come in, and Seaka grabs Anya and puts a gun to her head. Seaka tells Jack to give him the MK Ultra, or Anya dies. Jack shoots Seaka and Urich, and Jack and Anya escape. Seaka dies, and Urich calls Jensen and asks for a meeting on the roof of a parking garage. Back at the large house, Jack calls his CIA friend Rogers, who is a hacker. Jack asks Rogers to hack into the MK Ultra project and stop it for good. On the roof of the parking garage, Urich meets with Jensen, the man that Urich and Waters each want to sell the MK Ultra to. Jensen and his man start beating Urich up.  Anya calls Jensen's cell phone number. As part of a plan to set Jensen up, she tells him that Jack is meeting with Waters and Schmitt in the central library. After they hang up, Jensen's man kills Urich. Just as Jack and Anya are leaving the large house, a man in a helicopter opens fire on them. The man is working for Waters. Jack and Anya run back inside and exit out the side door to Anya's cab. As they leave, the helicopter gives chase, and Jack and Anya hide the car in some woods. Jack gets out and fires several shots, causing the helicopter to explode. At the embassy, Jack waits for Ambassador Cochran in her office. Jack tells her to tell Waters to meet with him at the Central Library. At the library, Jack sees Schmitt and Waters.  Jack sits down and tells Waters that Waters won't get the MK Ultra formula until he (Jack) sees Amanda. Waters has one of his men show her to him on a balcony above. Water tells Jack that he has 60 seconds to give up the formula, or Amanda will be thrown off the balcony. All of a sudden, Jack fatally shoots the man who is holding Amanda. Schmitt tries to shoot Anya. Jack grabs Waters' hand, and forces Waters to fatally shoot Schmitt. Jack then fires five shots, killing Waters. As Anya tries to get Amanda to safety, Jensen's two henchmen open fire on Jack. Jack kills one of them, and then confronts Jensen and his other henchman. Jack grabs Jensen's gun hand and causes Jensen to fire two shots, killing the henchman. Then Jack puts Jensen's eyes out, leaving him to die. As Jack leaves, George steps in front of him with a gun.  George, who is the man behind everything, wasn't in the limo when it exploded. Jack kills George by using a martial arts move, a special hit to the chest, that sends George backwards into a wall, and there is blood on the wall as George slumps down. Rogers hacks into the MK Ultra program and puts an end to the project, and Jack is reunited with Amanda. Later, Ambassador Cochran gives Jack a passport to give to Anya so she can go to America. After Jack and Amanda get back to the USA, Jack gets Amanda a horse for being so brave in Romania.  
Shark Bait
 Pisces, or Pi ([[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]]), is a 5-year-old orange fish that lives happily with his parents Pike and Piper in the polluted harbor of [[Boston, Massachusetts]], until a fishing boat scoops them from the sea. Pi's parents manage to help him escape, but cannot escape themselves. Before Pi's parents are taken away, Piper tells Pi to promise her he would go live with his aunt. Pi's porpoise friends Percy ([[Trent Ford]]) and Percy's mother Meg ([[Megahn Perry]]) agree to take him, but Pi refuses to leave in case his parents return, Meg sadly tells him that once anyone is taken by a net they can never come back; Pi is heartbroken that he is now an orphan.   Meg and Percy take Pi to live with his aunt Pearl on an exotic reef. When Pi reaches the reef, he is 18 years old and has stayed with the porpoises for most of his life. As he tries to settle himself in this new world, the sweet and well-meaning Pi makes some good friends in his new home, the first residents Pi comes across are three elderly [[marlins]] named Moe, Jack, and Manny, which direct him towards Pearl's home. On his way there, Pi immediately falls in love with Cordelia ([[Evan Rachel Wood]]), a celebrity fish that has appeared on the front cover of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. He also meets his cousin Dylan ([[Andy Dick]]), that quickly becomes Pi's best friend.  However, Pi soon encounters Troy ([[Donal Logue]]), the meanest, toughest [[tiger shark]] in the ocean, is not only terrorizing everyone in the reef community, but also has his eye set on Cordelia to become his mate. Pi confronts Troy, only to have him smack Pi with his tail. Cordelia tells Pi that Troy is her problem, and to not interfere. Pi and Dylan find their way home, where Pearl ([[Fran Drescher]]) is excited to see that Pi has arrived. She is a fortune teller using a pink pearl that Dylan's deceased father gave to her. Pearl reads Pi's future and is surprised, saying that he is destined for great things and that the reef is the best place he will be able to find it. Pearl then tells Pi that he can go anywhere on the reef excluding an old pirate wreck and a forbidden place called "flat bottom". While out on a swim with Pearl and Dylan, they meet Buddy a [[decorator crab]] and Lou a [[sawfish]]. After Pearl leaves Dylan in charge of showing Pi around. Pi is told by Dylan about Nerissa ([[Rob Schneider]]), a wise old hermit [[loggerhead turtle]] that lives in the old shipwreck and practices martial arts, leading to rumors that he is a wizard. Eventually they stumble upon flat bottom, the open sea which is outside of the wildlife sanctuary free for humans to come with their fishing nets.   Dylan leaves after a close encounter and Pi sees Cordelia, but per her instructions does not interact. Until he hears her scream after getting a lure stuck in her fin and swears to help her. Pi brings Cordelia to Buddy and Lou who successfully remove it, she invites him to go to a concert with her. Beforehand, Pi meets Dylan once again and they observe Nerissa defend his blue pearl using the sea from a gang of squid nappers.   At the amphitheatre that night with Cordelia, Pi learns about the performer Thornton ([[John Rhys Davies]]) a [[harbor seal]] that tangled with a large creature. Afterwards, Pi and Cordelia look at the stars and she falls in love with him. Suddenly, an enraged Troy arrives and starts abusing Pi worse than ever, until Cordelia makes a deal with him: if he leaves Pi alone, she will marry Troy (which, in this case, is done when someone "accepts someone else's pearl"), Pi is knocked unconscious by Troy and is carried to Nerissa's shipwreck by a current.  When Nerissa tells Pi the following day, he decides he has had enough of Troy's abuse towards him, and asks Nerissa to teach him the ways of the ocean to combat Troy. Nerissa refuses, telling Pi to fight his own battles. Pi asks other residents to help him, but the marlins are too afraid and think because of their age, they won't be useful. Pi asks Thornton, he states Pi must be crazy, Pi only reminds Thornton of his tale of his encounter with a sea monster. However, he states that he did not actually fight a monster, but since he said it in rhyme, it did not count as lying due to his "poetic license".   Meanwhile, Troy's henchmen Bart and Eddie try to steal Nerissa's pearl, but are frightened away by Pi and Dylan. Nerissa arrives and is impressed with Pi's skills, agreeing to train him the next morning.   On Pi's first day of training, Pearl tells Pi that she could not live with herself if Pi were killed. Pi then reminds Pearl how she said that he would find his destiny on the reef, and he did when he met Cordelia. Stating now he is about to lose her just like how he lost his parents, Pi tells Pearl how he could not do anything to save them, and maybe he could not save Cordelia, but he will not give up without trying. Nerissa starts by telling Pi that Troy picks on anyone smaller than him, and he has never learned about things bigger than him, Nerissa says the ocean itself is bigger than Troy and if Pi can use the ocean against him, his own size would not matter. Nerissa leads Pi down a valley with obstacles, including razor-sharp [[elkhorn coral]], burning [[fire coral]], a long, narrow tunnel known as Bottleneck Alley, and finally a current known as the West Indies current, full of [[Portuguese man o' war]] that could kill someone Pi's size.  Meanwhile, Cordelia is informed by Buddy and Lou about Pi's upcoming battle with Troy. Nerissa reveals the story of his blue pearl to Pi and he gave it to his wife, but she got hooked in the open sea. Nerissa desperately tried to call for help, but no one was brave enough to help. Pi understands, but wonders how he can stop Troy for good; Nerissa tells him to offer Troy something he wants and then give him something he doesn't want. Cordelia finds Pi and repeatedly tries to convince him to reconsider, believing what's done is done. That night Pearl's pearl has been stolen by Troy's henchmen. She is heartbroken, being as Dylan's father gave her the pearl. Pi realizes that he cannot back down now no matter how much everyone else doubts him.  After mastering the ways of the ocean, Pi's friends Thornton, Buddy, and Lou, and Moe, Jack, and Manny (three marlins that were friends of Nerissa's), Cordelia and Dylan decide to band together to stop the abuse and terror that has caused fear within the reef's population. After training his friends, Pi leads the charge and they deal with Troy's crew in a final showdown.  Pi initiates a chase with Troy. As Pi swims away from Troy through the valley Nerissa instructed him to take, Troy is hit by all of the obstacles until they get to the open sea. Nerissa tries to help by throwing an old boot at Troy's henchmen Bart and Eddie, and Dylan shoves them down a lobster hole, retrieving his mother's pearl in the process. Pi is then swatted by Troy's tail into a cliff, burying him in rocks. Nerissa attempts to help him, but is hit by Troy; just as all seems lost Moe, Jack, and Manny arrive to fight Troy and apologize to Nerissa for not having his back when he needed them.   Percy and Meg return and free Pi. Troy then sets Percy as a target. Pi sees a net and plans to trick Troy into it. Pi distracts Troy long enough to allow Percy to escape. Troy targets Pi and believes Pi is doomed since they are now in open water. Troy chases him up to the surface, where he manages to lead Troy into a fishing net and narrowly escapes the shark's jaws as he leaps through the top of the net. Troy, trapped in the net, is lifted from the sea. Pi is proclaimed a hero by the population of the reef. Nerissa gives Pi his pearl because Nerissa sees Pi as his son and if he had one himself he would have given it to him. Pi is honored and does not know what to say. Nerissa states that Pi knows exactly what to say, but he is just not the one to whom he needs to be saying it. Cordelia accepts the pearl that Pi gives her and they share a kiss as the reef celebrates, along with Bart and Eddie, which rejoice that they are all free from Troy.  In a mid-credits scene, Thornton tells Pi's story to everyone on the reef, proud now that he can tell a true story about himself ending with "Pi was determined, he refused to despair, I know it's all true, for you see, I was there..."

James and Jamie meet a young ex-model and aspiring singer named Ceth (pronounced "Seth") and portrayed by [[Jay Brannan]]) and the three begin a sexual relationship. Meanwhile, James and Jamie's life is being closely watched by their across-the-street [[Stalking|stalker]] neighbor, Caleb ([[Peter Stickles]]). Caleb fears the inclusion of Ceth in James and Jamie's relationship might break them up and thus destroy his ability to live vicariously through them, so he attends Shortbus, where he confronts Ceth. Sofia begins to go daily to a spa with a [[sensory deprivation tank]] to meet with Severin, and the two begin to have intense conversations. Severin begins to help Sofia loosen up sexually; Sofia helps Severin achieve a deeper human connection than she had experienced before. One evening at Shortbus, Severin discusses with Sofia the idea of giving up sex work to pursue her dream of being an artist. The two then have an unplanned sexual experience, and once again Sofia is left unsatisfied.  Throughout the film, James is seen making a film about himself and his relationship. It turns out to be a suicide note. He attempts to take his own life and is rescued by Caleb, who calls for help, but is too embarrassed to wait with James for the help to arrive. He writes his phone number and email address on James' face while he is unconscious. When James wakes in the hospital, he calls Caleb. James goes to Caleb's home to be consoled, but does not contact Jamie or Ceth, neither of whom can understand why he wouldn't call them or come home.  There follows an interlocking trio of scenes showing connections between the characters' emotional problems and their sexual lives. * At Caleb's house, he and James have sex, and James allows Caleb to penetrate him, something he has never allowed anyone to do before. Afterward, in a dramatic revelation, James is seen in the window of Caleb's apartment by Jamie, who realizes in that moment that James is alive and okay. * Rob and Severin have a paid encounter where Rob asks to be flogged, something he couldn't ask Sofia to do. As this progresses, Severin loses control and Rob tries to comfort her. * Sofia seems to have a dream of struggling through an overgrown, wild forested area to a gentle seashore where she tries to achieve orgasm again. On failing, she screams, and in the real world [[Northeast blackout of 2003|the lights go off]] across the city, seemingly caused by the simultaneous and collective frustration of the characters.  The film ends with a song by Justin Bond at Shortbus during the blackout. Sofia arrives and finds Rob with Severin and after acknowledging him sits down by herself. James and Jamie also arrive followed by Ceth and Caleb. Justin's song starts on a wistful note, but as it progresses it becomes more energetic and positive thanks to the arrival of the [[Hungry March Band]]. This is mirrored in the actions and emotions of the actors. Jamie and James make out on the floor, and Ceth and Caleb start to hit it off. Rob seems to find a friend, and Severin progresses from nervous anxiety to happy elation upon the arrival of the band. Sofia engages in a threesome with a couple she has seen several times before and who appear to meet her prerequisite of "just beginning to experiment sexually" (Nick and Leah, played by Jan Hilmer and [[Shanti Carson]]), and finally achieves an orgasm, and the blackout affecting New York ends, as does the film.

  At a lake, the mentally handicapped Nina spots her brother Jacob, his girlfriend Jamie, and their friends Tony and Sammy [[Nude swimming|skinny dipping]]. Nina follows Jacob and Jamie into the woods, observes them having sex, and is dragged off by Tony and Sammy. When Jacob and Jamie finish, Jamie goes off alone, and is chased by a man who has murdered Tony and Sammy. The man drowns Jamie in the lake, while Jacob (who was looking for Nina) watches in shock. Jacob goes to the police station, where he tells the chief that he received a call from his father, Willy, who he thinks has committed suicide.  While doing a feature for the news, reporter Sabrina Meyers (the chief's daughter, who glimpsed a bloodied Jamie the night she died) finds Jamie's necklace in the lake, theorizes Jacob (who says Nina was found and placed in a sanitarium, while Jamie went back home) murdered her, and asks around about him. Meanwhile, Sabrina's boyfriend Matt and three others (Joe, Cindy and Dana) are getting a summer camp ready. Sabrina uncovers more circumstantial evidence that something happened at the lake, but no one believes her stories, though her investigation draws the ire of the killer (who murders Sabrina's cameraman Andy and his girlfriend Jennifer) and his accomplice, a figure dressed in white that attacks Sabrina, but is scared off by her father.  People take Sabrina seriously when Jamie's body is discovered (only to be stolen moments later) and a waitress Jamie had sought help from the night she died is found dead from bee stings (something arranged by the killer). The chief questions Jacob, and finds holes in his story, the main one being Nina's whereabouts. When her father finishes, Sabrina interviews Jacob herself, and goes home, where her father has stationed an officer to guard her. Matt stops by, and while he and Sabrina argue over her visiting Jacob, the white figure knifes the officer and Matt, and abducts Sabrina. The chief realizes something is wrong when he calls Sabrina's cellphone, and a dying Matt answers.  Sabrina regains consciousness and sneaks away from the white figure, revealed to be Jacob. Jacob and the main killer, his father Willy, are committing murders because Nina was raped and accidentally killed by Tony and Sammy. The two are wiping out witnesses to the duo's crime, and their own homicides. Jacob and Willy realize Sabrina has escaped, and follow her to the summer camp, where they murder Dana and Joe. Sabrina and Cindy are forced into the back of Sammy's stolen van by Jacob, who tries to poison them with exhaust fumes. As Jacob is driving, he is forced off the road and fatally shot by the chief, who revives Sabrina and Cindy. The film ends with Willy's whereabouts unknown, and Sabrina giving an interview to the media.  
Silent Hill (film)
 Rose Da Silva and her husband Christopher are deeply disturbed by their adopted daughter [[Heather Mason|Sharon]]'s constant [[sleepwalking]] and nightmares about Silent Hill, a town that was abandoned 30 years ago due to a massive [[coal seam fire]]. Against Christopher's wishes, Rose takes Sharon on a trip to Silent Hill to find answers. Her erratic behaviour concerns police officer [[Cybil Bennett]]. Rose flees from Cybil, but when a [[Alessa Gillespie|girl]] steps out into the road, Rose crashes and blacks out. Waking up some time later, Rose finds herself in the foggy dimension of Silent Hill and realizes that Sharon is missing.  Searching the town for Sharon, Rose pursues the same girl she encountered prior to the crash, who turns out to resemble Sharon in appearance. At various points, the town transitions into a nightmarish dimension inhabited by inhuman monsters, including the fearsome [[Pyramid Head]]. Rose survives the transitions and consequently learns of the existence of [[Alessa Gillespie]], a young girl [[witch hunt|burnt]] by the Brethren, the town's fanatical cult. Her mother [[List of Silent Hill series characters#Dahlia Gillespie|Dahlia]] wanders the streets as an outcast, guilty for her negligence that led to Alessa's doom. Rose is later joined by Cybil, also trapped in the foggy dimension of the town due to a giant [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]] isolating Silent Hill. Meanwhile, in the real world, Christopher searches the abandoned town with policeman Thomas Gucci, but their search is in vain. Upon finding a photo of Alessa, Christopher goes to the [[orphanage]] where Sharon was adopted. Gucci appears, revealing he lived in Silent Hill and saved Alessa from the fire. He encourages Christopher to end his futile search and go home.  In the Silent Hill dimension, Rose and Cybil explore a hotel the Brethren once used, accompanied by Anna, a Brethren member, where they find the burnt remains of a ceremonial chamber. Rose also encounters the girl, revealed to be an aspect of Alessa. When the town transitions into the dark dimension, Rose, Cybil, and Anna flee to an old church but Pyramid Head emerges and skins Anna alive. Inside, Christabella, the [[high priest]]ess of the Brethren, and Alessa's aunt, suggests a "[[demon]]" knows where Sharon is. Her followers lead Rose and Cybil to a hospital, claiming the demon is in the basement. Christabella sees a photo of Sharon from Rose's locket and brands Rose and Cybil as "witches" due to Sharon resembling Alessa. Cybil fights the Brethren members but Christabella orders them to violently beat her.  Rose enters the basement, but she is barricaded by a group of weapon-wielding nurses who appear to be almost completely blind due to their disfigured, covered faces. Although light and sound attract them, Rose manages to sneak through them, inadvertently startling them into attacking each other. She flees and enters Alessa's room. In a flashback, it is revealed that Alessa was stigmatised by the townspeople for being a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]]. Christabella convinces Dahlia, a formerly devout Brethren member, to "purify" Alessa, after Alessa is raped whilst attempting to hide from her tormentors. Christabella immolates Alessa during a ritual but Dahlia realises this and alerts Gucci. They arrive too late as the ritual goes awry, igniting the infamous coal seam fire. Hospitalised, Alessa's rage grew and manifested as Dark Alessa, who is responsible for the shifting dimensions of Silent Hill. Her remaining innocence is later manifested as Sharon, who is taken to the real world to be adopted. Desperate to find Sharon, Rose allows Dark Alessa to grant access to the church by fusing with her body. Meanwhile, Sharon, protected by Dahlia, is captured by the Brethren.  In the church, Christabella burns Cybil to death and plans to do the same to Sharon. Rose intervenes and confronts Christabella in regards to her crimes but Christabella stabs her in the heart in retaliation. Rose's blood summons both the original Alessa and Dark Alessa, who bisect and kill Christabella and her followers, except for Dahlia, with razor wire. Rose rescues Sharon, and, upon seeing Dark Alessa, Sharon and Alessa/Dark Alessa reunite into one body. Rose and Alessa leave the town and return home. When they return home, it is revealed that they are still in the foggy dimension, separated from reality.  Meanwhile, Christopher is alone in the real world but discovers that the front door has mysteriously opened.

Simon Says (film)
 Five teenagers — Kate ([[Margo Harshman]]), Zack ([[Greg Cipes]]), Vicky, Riff, and Ashley — are on their way to pan for gold during Spring Break when they make a wrong turn. They encounter two strange men, Pig and Garth, who warn them to return home, saying there have been murders in the area. Making their way into town, four of the teens head inside a store, where they meet brothers Simon ([[Crispin Glover]]) and Stanley.  Simon is unhelpful, denying the teens requests to buy anything. Frustrated, the group leaves and finds a campsite. Unbeknownst to them, there is someone observing the teens, dressed in a [[ghillie suit]]. He chases Ashley through the woods before realizing that she is not 'dream girl' and murders her. The attacker - revealed to be Stanley - begins to cut up her body, saying that he will make her into a present for 'dream girl'.  Back at the store, Zack arrives to find it closed and empty. He lets himself in and discovers numerous bodies hanging from the ceiling, including those of Pig, Garth and Clay. Zack pulls several newspaper articles off the bodies, as he then flees the store. After dark, Simon arrives and tells the teens Stanley is missing. At this moment, a terrified Zack arrives and manages to convince Simon to leave. The teens find their van's tires punctured, stranding them.  The group heads into the forest to look for Ashley and discover that Stanley has made a 'doll' out of Ashley's head, hands, and feet. They are watched by Stanley, who kills Riff, while Simon kills Vicky. Kate is stopped by Simon in his truck, who lies and tells her that the others are safe at his store. Zack sneaks up and climbs into the truck bed as Kate gets into the truck. While they are driving, Simon explains that he and Stanley have lived in the area their entire lives with their parents Quinn and Carrie, and took over the gas station when Quinn and Carrie died. Simon takes Kate to an old campsite where two long-decayed bodies are sitting at a picnic table. He ties her to the table when Stanley appears in his ghillie suit. Suspicious, Simon chops off several of Stanley's fingers with a cleaver, and it's revealed that it is actually Zack in the suit, trying to masquerade as Stanley.  Simon ties Zack to a tree and tortures him. Zack confesses his love to Kate calling her his 'Dream Girl.' This angers Simon and he burns Zack alive. Turning back to Kate, Simon announces that he is also Stanley, having taken over his brother's identity after murdering Quinn and Carrie while the real Stanley is in a coma.

Simon goes into the back room and opens a trapdoor, revealing Kate tied up with infant twins before the screen cuts to black.  
Singapore Dreaming
  Poh Huat (Richard Low), the father of the Loh family, works as a lawyer's [[law clerk|clerk]]. He is married to Siew Luan (Alice Lim), a [[housewife]] who likes to brew ''liang teh'' ([[herbal tea]]) for the family. Poh Huat has a habit of buying [[lottery]] tickets in hope of winning and enjoying a better life. He also keeps newspaper cuttings of [[car model]]s and [[condominium]]s and stores them in a box in his room.  The family has one son, Seng (Dick Su), and one daughter, Mei (Yeo Yann Yann). Despite Mei's superior academic performance, the family has consistently shown favouritism for Seng. Even though he was ostensibly the academically poorer sibling, dropping out of school in [[secondary education|Secondary 3]], his parents still chose to fund his overseas [[institute of technology|polytechnic]] education instead of furthering his sister's education. Seng is due to return after two years at Dubois Polytechnical University (at Idaho). To fund his overseas studies, he had to borrow extra money from his [[fiancée]], Irene (Serene Chen), who stays with Seng's parents.  Mei works as a [[secretary]] who maintains a friendly working relationship with her boss. She is due for [[childbirth|delivery]] in two months' time, and for [[maternity leave]] in a month's time. Her husband, Chin Keong (Lim Yu-Beng), quit his job in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] a month before and is now selling [[insurance]], though unsuccessfully. He is therefore belittled by Mei. Even though they cannot afford it, they frequently go to a condominium [[showroom]] to take a look, revealing their aspirations for a more luxurious lifestyle.  Seng returns from the [[United States]]. Tensions escalate in the family between Mei and Seng, due to the family's apparent favouritism for Seng. Seng goes for several [[job interview]]s, but is unsuccessful. He becomes immensely disappointed, and lies to his family about the sanguinity of his job prospects.  Poh Huat strikes the [[Toto (gaming)|Toto]] lottery, winning S$2 million, and the family is ecstatic. Seng decides that he wants to try starting a business. He gains his father's approval, who gives him effectively unlimited funding through a [[credit card]]. Seng also buys a car, without Irene's knowledge. Irene is infuriated when she learns Seng has been overspending without working first.  Initially thrilled by his sudden elevation to the higher social class, Poh Huat dies suddenly of a [[heart attack]] while he was at a [[country club]] for a membership interview. Siew Luan goes into [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|shock]]. At the [[funeral]], Seng quarrels with Mei over the funeral expenses. Mei vents her anger on Chin Keong, who shows his displeasure by throwing the carton of drinks on the floor and storming off. Mei is called back to work one afternoon, even though she is still managing the funeral. Chin Keong expresses his outrage at this unreasonable request, but Mei says out of frustration, "Singapore is like that, everywhere is like that, do we have a choice?" and returns to work. At work, Mei's boss, frustrated at the incapable temporary secretary, vents his anger at Mei and demands her to photocopy a stack of documents and brew coffee for him. Mei flips at the triviality of the task.  Back at the funeral, Mei realizes that S$500 has gone missing from the ''pek kim'', and wrongly accuses her [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[maid]], Pinky, of stealing the money. Chin Keong reveals shortly after that the money is actually with him. Pinky, indignant at the wrong accusation, spits at Mei. Chin Keong goes to a nearby [[café|coffee shop]] for a drink. A beer girl from [[Mainland China]] approaches him at his table to talk to him, and Chin Keong ends up confiding his worries about life. The girl notes, "You Singaporeans are always complaining. Do you think your life is tough?". During the funeral wake, Seng reveals to his family that he did not graduate. Initially unbeknownst to him, Irene is standing nearby at the door, and hears his confession. Irene is greatly disappointed with Seng, and resolves to leave him.  A few months later, Chin Keong, Seng and Mei, with her newly-born son, are called to a lawyer's office. It is revealed that Poh Huat's [[will (law)|will]] has been found (made before either of them are born): he had left all his assets to his wife Siew Luan. However, the family has chalked up a [[debt]] of S$800,000 in sending Seng overseas. Siew Luan is absent from the meeting, so the lawyer announces that, of the remaining S$1, 200,000, Mei is getting S$300,000, while Seng is getting S$1,000. At the movie's end, Siew Luan hands some money over to Poh Huat's mistress and illegitimate son in a show of benevolence, and leaves Seng to stay in rural [[Malaysia]]. Irene decides to go abroad to pursue a degree in [[photography]].  
Silk (2006 film)
 In [[Taipei]], a team of ghost hunters pay a freelance camera man to photograph places looking for paranormal activity. From the sounds of things, previous attempts have been unsuccessful. The camera man is taking his pictures and this time captures a picture of a boy in a seemingly empty room. The team of ghost hunters are thrilled and take it upon themselves to further investigate.  They bring a police officer, a sharp shooter and a lip reader for further help in their investigation for further study of Ghost. The officer has a sick mother who is in the state of coma and has a decaying body. Though the officer refuses to offer help in the initial stages, he accepts the case due to curiosity. On the other side the director of this entire program calls the team to give up their research as it seems worthless and is costly to the Japanese government. The team reveals a magnetic cube which can split itself and capture energy of any form. Its capacity to hold energy is such that it can withstand the force of gravity and float in air. The director obviously agrees to offer further support. It is further revealed that the walls of the room of the captured ghost are packed with thousands of such cubes to obstruct the movement of the ghost boy.  The inclusion of a police officer angers one of the teammates who decides to take revenge on the team. She steps into the room of the captured ghost and sprays an energy synchronizer which allows her to capture the ghost inside her pocket. The team which arrives later is shocked at the missing ghost and demands she tells the truth. In the meantime, the ghost escapes from her pocket and kills her. Her soul appears for a short span of time and vanishes. It will be quite astonishing as to why the soul of the boy is still persisting.  Further observation reveals that the captured ghost follows a fixed pattern of activities like staring out of the window and trying to walk through a door at a particular time. This causes the team to set the ghost boy free into the open world to trace his activities. The police officer follows the boy to his school which apparently was the place of his suicide. The ghost boy was also found to leave a trace of silk strands along his foot steps.  Investigation in school reveals clues pointing to the place and cause of his death. They follow the clues to a dead body and conclude that he was strangled to death by his own mother. This produced a strong hate in him which has made his soul restless. Furthermore, the body of this dead boy is found to be in the center of a nuclear fusion reactor whose magnetic flux is also found to have caused his unstable soul.  The police officer doubts a relation between the ghost boy and the silk strands. He follows the silk strands which leads him to an unwell women in an hospital, who dies shortly afterwards. On the other side the director issues orders to seize the project which angers the team leader. The team leader captures the soul of the boy in a magnetic cube and leaves without a trace. This causes the soul of the boy's mother to take revenge on all the people involved in the team by killing them.  The mom tries to kill the police officer's girlfriend. The police officer arrives at the scene with a sniper rifle and sprays the bullets with holy water. The police officer saves his girlfriend but the ghost mom is chases after him. He drives away and crashes his car into a subway entrance. He escapes into a train but the ghost mom manages to catch him. His girlfriend calls him and he tells her to check on his mom, who has been hospitalized. He says sorry and prepares to be killed by the ghost mom. She reaches into his heart and stops it.  The team leader sets the ghost boy free and kills himself in the same spot as of the boy so that he can turn into a ghost. The boy, now released, goes to where the police officer is and reaches into his heart and revives him. He and his mother, both as ghosts, hug. The police officer then calls the team leader to tell him that the team leader was wrong. The boy's energy wasn't stuck in the world because of hate, it was because of his bond with his mother. The police officer returns home. He finds his mother's ghost sitting in his living room. He asks if she is angry at him. She doesn't reply and stands up, puts an egg into a pot, and disappears. The police officer stares at the egg in the pot, and it disappears just like his mom. It is revealed that his girlfriend signed her death certificate at the hospital as the patient's daughter-in-law.

SistaGod
  The film begins during the early 1990s. A white American soldier, serving in the [[Gulf War]] as a [[sniper]], is washed ashore on Trinidadian soil. He is shell-shocked from the war, with the mindset of a 12-year-old child. He is taken care of by an Afro-Trinidadian nurse, who helps rehabilitate him. Eventually, they fall in love.  Mari, the daughter of the soldier and the nurse, was conceived in a cemetery. Because the girl is dark-skinned, the soldier denies that she is his child, and leaves the mother. The nurse goes insane and is taken to an asylum, where she spends day after day staring at photos of her and the soldier. Mari is taken in by “Nan”, her adopted Hindu grandmother, in St. Joseph, Trinidad. They live near the cemetery where she claims she hears the souls of the dead trying to resurface.  One day, out of curiosity, Mari picks a bunch of poisoned berries from a tree and eats them. She does not die, but her tongue is darkened black. Nan creates an antidote for the poison, using medicinal herbs.  Her mother is eventually released from the asylum and takes Mari to church one day. When reaching the church, they view a woman and her three children. The woman, in Mari’s opinion, looks like [[Miss Universe]]. The three children (two boys and a girl) are her half-brothers and half-sister respectively. The two women stare at each other, frozen in the middle of the street. Mari’s mother walks off, leaving the family to walk the other way.  At age eighteen, while Mari is sleeping one night, he has a premonition of the future. After this dream, she realizes that she is the New [[Messiah]]. Her presence on Earth will herald an event known as the “Apocalypso”, after which “everyone will disappear”.  Believing that Mari is possessed by a spirit, Nan hires a popular [[televangelist]] to [[exorcise]] her. Mari remains on her bed as the televangelist begins. As he speaks to her to be released from the spirit, she suddenly goes into [[convulsions]] and light illuminates from her mouth. The televangelist ultimately gives up, and assumes that Nan’s house is possessed and is causing her adopted granddaughter to act strange. The decision is made to burn the house down, forcing Nan to stay by her sister’s house. The loss of her home affects Nan, who dies a few days later. She is buried in a funeral [[pyre]], using scraps from her house.  The televangelist returns to complete the demolition of Nan’s house.  He tries to console Mari by giving her an [[iguana]] that he caught.  She eventually frees the iguana, after which it is run over by a vehicle. She glances into the car, and sees the face of her father. Her father had returned to Trinidad years ago to open a pub, with its walls painted with images from the Gulf War.  Days later, Mari becomes pregnant. The mother, after hearing this shocking news, threatens to fling herself off the top of a waterfall located near her hometown. Instead, she designs a Baby Doll costume for her daughter to wear. The Baby Doll, in Carnival mythology, is a teenage girl dressed in all white who wears a white mask to hide her shame for being pregnant at such an early age. Now in costume, Mari has adopted a new persona - SistaGod.<ref></ref>  One day, Mari has a dream in which she is wearing the Baby Doll costume (which she wears throughout the rest of the film) and “floating through the trees”. Her adopted grandmother floats with her, followed by her father, and the televangelist who has his arms outstretched with a Bible in his left hand. All four of them are now aligned, still floating. The dream ends, and Mari is shown walking away from the waterfall. Her mother arrives afterwards, walking towards it. She capsizes her head face down in the pool, with her hands outstretched, and drowns herself. The next day, Mari rushes to her father’s home to tell him about her mother’s death. Days later, he visits her grave. Mari arrives in the night, leaving candles to illuminate the tombstone. She then remembers her mother telling her that she will return to Earth in fire.  The next morning, a Carnival procession begins. This is the day before the Apocalypso – the end of humanity. All the participants are dressed as traditional Carnival characters such as Burrokeets, Bats, Midnight Robbers, Bookmen, Dame Lorraines and the bizarre Blue Devils. As a child, Mari could not take part in Carnival, but can only watch in fear and awe. On this day, she is simply observing the festivities. The celebrations become more intense and more frightening as the Blue Devils enter. Realizing that the end is near, Mari asks a nearby Bookman(who is holding a book containing names of souls going to Hell) if there is any room there for the rest of humanity. He tells her that Hell is currently overpopulated.  Night creeps in and the Blue Devils continue their ranting and raving. The Apocalypso then begins.  The next morning, Mari is seen standing near a wall. The entire wall is scribbled with names. She is the human survivor of the Apocalypso and begins to walk through the empty streets. She assumes that the gods are the only other survivors, as she passes a gigantic statue of the Hindu monkey-god [[Hanuman]].  She continues to walk aimlessly until she sits down in front of a tree. She is in pain, as her water just broke. She gives birth, as is symbolized by a light (similar to the one that illuminated her mouth during the exorcism) between her legs. The screen fades to black, with the words “The End of the Beginning” being shown. These words fade, after which we hear the crying of Mari’s newborn child.

Slither (2006 film)
 A [[meteorite]] housing a malevolent, sentient [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial parasite]] crashes into the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina. While frolicking in the woods with Brenda, local car dealer Grant finds the parasite and is infected by it. The parasite takes over his body and absorbs his mind.<ref></ref> With the alien now in control of his body, "Grant" begins to slowly change into a tentacled, slug-like monster. Many pets soon disappear but Grant is not suspected. However, his wife Starla begins to question his health; he explains the initial changes in his appearance as an allergic reaction to a bee sting, saying that a doctor has already given him something for it, but Starla soon learns this is a lie. Starla contacts the police chief Bill Pardy – her childhood crush – who attempts to reassure and comfort her while not acting on his feelings.  Grant infects the lonely and neglected Brenda and hides her in an isolated barn and feeds her raw meat to breed hundreds of alien slugs inside her. In the night, Starla is attacked by the infected Grant. Bill and the police try to shoot Grant but Grant escapes. Bill leads a small group of officers on a hunt for Grant; they find Brenda in the barn, where she has become a massive blob of flesh due to Grant's infecting her. The group barely has time to do anything before Brenda explodes, releasing hundreds of the alien slugs. Most of Bill's group are infected by the slugs and become Grant's [[Zombie (fictional)|puppets]], speaking as if they were Grant and obsessed with bringing Starla home and holding her to her wedding vows. Everyone in town is quickly eaten by others infected with Grant's offspring, or absorbed into Grant's [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] except Starla, Bill, mayor Jack MacReady, and a teenage girl, Kylie, who had escaped from her family that were also infected by the parasites. She tells them of how she saw the slug's memories; it moves from planet to planet, eating or absorbing all life it finds there. The parasite's consciousness, however, is influenced by the real Grant's memories and his love for his wife, Starla.  The survivors try to escape detection and kill Grant. The townspeople attack their vehicle, capturing Starla and Jack. Bill and Kylie track Starla to her home, and find that the infected are melding into one giant creature. They must risk their lives to stop the infestation from spreading any further. Jack awakens in the house's basement, where several of the infected are eating; he tries to escape but becomes infected by Grant as he reaches the top of the stairs and opens the door. Starla charms the monster by calling him "Grant" and telling him they can be together, but as they get close to each other, she pulls a hairbrush handle from her underwear and stabs him in the chest with the pointed handle. He slaps her with a tentacle and knocks her across the room. Bill arrives; Jack begs to be killed, and Bill shoots him in the head. He tries to kill the monster with a grenade, but another tentacle knocks the grenade into the pool, where it detonates. The monster sends two tentacles to stab Bill and infect him the same way he infected Brenda; one is lodged in his abdomen, but Bill attaches the other to a small propane tank, filling Grant with gas, and Starla shoots the monster, causing it to explode, whereupon all the infected die. The three survivors walk away to find a hospital for Bill.  In a [[post-credits scene]], a cat approaches to feed off Grant's remains and is infected with the evil parasite.

Snakes on a Plane
 After witnessing California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a [[Boeing 747-400]] to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' [[Lei (garland)|lei]]s with a special [[pheromone]] which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the [[Viperidae|viper]] that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a [[heart attack]] and continues toward LAX.  Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable [[liferaft]]. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with [[ophiology|ophiologist]] Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects the injured dealer with the antivenom and commandeers his supply of antivenom for the victims on the plane based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.  Harris contacts Flynn, telling him that antivenom will be ready for the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to [[Uncontrolled decompression|depressurize]]. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game [[flight simulator]]. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and antivenom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a [[ballistic vest]]. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to [[Bali]] and teaches him how to surf.

Smokin' Aces
 Las Vegas magician and wannabe gangster, Buddy "Aces" Israel ([[Jeremy Piven]]) is hiding out in a Lake Tahoe hotel penthouse with his entourage. His agent, Morris Mecklen ([[Curtis Armstrong]]), discusses a potential immunity deal with [[FBI]] Deputy Director Stanley Locke ([[Andy Garcia]]). [[Special agent|Agents]] Richard Messner ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) and Donald Carruthers ([[Ray Liotta]]) learn that ailing Las Vegas mob boss Primo Sparazza ([[Joseph Ruskin]]) has issued a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Israel worth one million dollars, and involving a mysterious assassin known only as The Swede, stipulating that he will bring Sparazza Israel's heart. A number of assassins also seek the reward, including Lazlo Soot ([[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]), who specializes in disguises and impersonations; Sharice Watters ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) and Georgia Sykes ([[Alicia Keys]]), two hitwomen hired by Sparazza's underboss; Pasquale Acosta ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), a calm torture expert and mercenary; and the psychotic [[neo-Nazi]] Tremor brothers, Darwin ([[Chris Pine]]), Jeeves ([[Kevin Durand]]), and Lester ([[Maury Sterling]]).   Locke dispatches Messner and Carruthers to take Israel into custody when the deal is struck. Meanwhile, a team of bail bondsmen, Jack Dupree ([[Ben Affleck]]) and his partners, "Pistol" Pete Deeks ([[Peter Berg]]) and Hollis Elmore ([[Martin Henderson]]) have been hired by the firm that posted Israel's bail to bring him into custody. The bondsmen are attacked by the Tremors, and only Elmore escapes alive. Messner is dispatched to the murder scene while Carruthers proceeds to Israel. At the same time, each of the assassins gain access to the hotel in their own various ways.  Carruthers encounters Acosta, disguised as a security officer, in an elevator at the hotel. Carruthers senses something is wrong and both are mortally wounded in a gunfight. Meanwhile, Soot gains access to the penthouse by posing as one of Israel's henchmen. Israel's second-in-command, Sir Ivy ([[Common (artist)|Common]]), learns that Israel agreed to inform upon Ivy as part of the plea deal and attempts to kill him, but Israel injures Ivy long enough for the hotel security team to restrain Ivy. Georgia finds Carruthers and Acosta in the elevator, but assumes Acosta is Soot. In Los Angeles, Locke abruptly withdraws from the deal with Israel and orders that Messner and Carruthers are not told. The Tremor brothers reach the penthouse floor, where they engage in a shootout with the security team and Ivy, who manages to kill Jeeves and Lester. Israel, learning of the FBI's new position, attempts [[suicide]].   Messner arrives at the hotel and sets up a position around Georgia's elevator. Sharice provides cover from another hotel with a .50-caliber, [[Barrett M82|M82]] sniper rifle, outgunning the FBI agents. Acosta, still alive, shoots Georgia, but is shot by Carruthers. Sharice, thinking Georgia is dead, refuses to escape and keeps shooting at the FBI team. Georgia escapes to the penthouse, where she stops Darwin Tremor before he can kill Ivy. Tremor escapes, and Messner, distraught over the death of Carruthers, stops Ivy and Georgia on the stairwell, but lets them escape. Sharice, after seeing the pair alive and free through her rifle scope, is gunned down by the FBI.   Locke and a team of FBI agents descend on the penthouse and take Israel to the hospital, while Soot escapes by tearing off his disguise & dressing as a member of hotel security. Acosta, carted away on a gurney, is also shown to be alive. Darwin Tremor tries to escape, but is gunned down by Hollis Elmore.   Messner arrives at the hospital and learns the truth about the day's events from Locke. It transpires that the mysterious Swede is a prominent heart surgeon and that Soot was hired by Sparazza to get Israel's heart so it could be transplanted into the body of Sparazza. Sparazza is further revealed to be Freeman Heller (Mike Falkow), an FBI agent who went undercover and was thought to have been killed by the mob. The FBI had attempted to kill Heller, after they thought his assignment had blurred the lines between being a mobster or an FBI agent. But Heller survived and ended up taking on the role as Sparazza full-time. The mobster has agreed to expose the mob's operations in exchange for Israel's heart as he is Sparazza's love child and, thus, the most compatible donor.  Messner, furious over the unnecessary deaths, especially Carruthers', protests and is ordered by Locke to leave the hospital and go home to Washington, D.C, as he is no longer on the case. Realizing that the FBI will never admit what they did, he walks into the emergency room, locks the door and pulls the plug on both Israel and Sparazza, killing them both. He then lays his gun and badge on the floor while Locke and his men desperately try to break in, apparently resigning as an FBI agent.  
Snakes on a Train
 Although taking the same basic idea from ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (lots of deadly [[snakes]] loose on a [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], high speed means of transport), the background story of how the snakes end up on the train is completely different.   In the film, a woman has been put under a [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n curse which causes snake eggs to hatch inside her belly and eat their way out. In order to recover the "lost pieces" of herself (the snakes), she must travel to [[Los Angeles]] where a powerful Mayan [[shaman]] can lift the curse. She takes the snakes along with her in small jars. While on the train, bandits attack her, allowing the snakes to escape, endangering the rest of the passengers.  Eventually, and inexplicably, she herself transforms into a gigantic snake and swallows the moving train whole.  Six passengers manage to escape unharmed, and one of them performs a magic ritual which causes her to vanish. However, one girl is shown to have been unknowingly bitten, suggesting that the curse will remain.

Thomas Mellor that the war would be over before they could see action with the announcement that their battalion would soon take part in the ''big push''. The three men were among the volunteers that had joined up in 1914 in response to [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]’s call to make up the bulk of the [[British Army]]. To relieve the French at [[Verdun]], an Anglo-French diversionary attack is to be launched at the [[River Somme]]. German divisional commander Gen. Baron Franz von Soden relies on the experience of veterans such as Cpl. Friedrich Hinkel against the biggest British military deployment in the war thus far. The British go over-the-top at  on 1 July expecting little resistance after a 7 day's artillery bombardment of enemy positions but are met by machine-gun fire within minutes.  Cpl. Hinkel faces the [[36th (Ulster) Division]], which is quickly forced into retreat while  away Capt. Thomas Tweed leads the 2nd Salford Pals’ B-Company in an attack on the [[Thiepval]] Plateau that sees the death of Mellor. The Ulster division regroup to take the stronghold of the [[Schwaben Redoubt]] and Maj-Gen. Sir Edward Percival recommends committing the reserves to secure the position and take Thiepval from the north but corps commander Lt.-Gen. Sir [[Thomas Morland]] rejects the new plan. With two-thirds of his company dead or wounded Tweed takes refuge for two hours behind a bank in no-man’s land. Sharples disappears attempting to capture the enemy machine gun nest and Fiddis is wounded taking a message to battalion requesting withdrawal. Moorland, some  from the front, follows the failure of the first and second attacks on Thiepval by sticking to the battle plan and ordering a third. The more adaptive German commanders retake the Redoubt rescuing Hinkel’s position and forcing the Ulstermen into a bloody retreat.  The bloodiest day in British military history ends with  and  devastating communities like [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]] but this was just the beginning of a battle that would last for four months. The British learn from their failures and over the following month they make steady gains along the front, by removing inflexible commanders like Morland and delegating to officers on the spot such as Brig-Gen. Herbert Shoubridge, who commands the 26 September attack on Thiepval spearheaded by Lt-Col. [[Francis Aylmer Maxwell|Frank Maxwell V.C.]] The artillery fires the new ''[[creeping barrage]]'' with the 12th Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]] following immediately behind, easily to overrun the first German trenches but failing to keep up; Maxwell’s men comes under fire from Infantry Regiment 180. A slaughter is averted when British tanks arrive, forcing the terrified Germans into retreat only to be ditched and disabled a short time later.  Soden is distracted by an official visit from the Kaiser’s adjutant Gen. [[Hans von Plessen]] and when communication lines are cut he is rendered helpless. Meanwhile the British Generals are kept up to date by reports from artillery observers and air observations, allowing them to order re-bombardment of enemy held positions. Maxwell moves forward with his men to set up a command post at the Thiepval Chateau from where he controls the attack. With the infantry rapidly running out of officers it is left to the initiative of men from the ranks like Pvt. [[Frederick Jeremiah Edwards|Frederick Edwards]] to secure a British victory. Plessen waits for six hours at Soden’s HQ for news of the attack, by which time it is too late to order a counterattack and Thiepval is lost. The victory allows the British to secure all their objectives from 1 July and the French at Verdun are able to launch a counter-attack to push back the Germans. Thiepval is now the site of the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]] commemorating the  the  casualties with no known grave including Sharples, Mellor and Fiddes.

Southland Tales
 On [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4th]], 2005, in a fictionalized [[United States]] [[alternate history]] reality, two towns in [[Texas]] ([[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]]) were destroyed by twin nuclear attacks, killing thousands and triggering a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, sending America into a state of anarchy and hysteria, as well as a [[Third World War]] (a fictionalized version of what the nation may have become under the [[War on Terror]]), with the US government re-introducing [[Conscription|the draft]].  The [[PATRIOT Act]] has extended authority to a new agency known as US-IDent, which keeps constant surveillance on citizens—even to the extent of [[Internet censorship|censoring the Internet]] and requiring fingerprints to access computers and bank accounts. In response to the recent fuel shortage in the wake of global warfare, the German company Treer designs a generator of inexhaustible energy, which is propelled by the perpetual motion of ocean currents, called "Fluid Karma". However, its inventor Baron von Westphalen and his associates are hiding the fact that the generators alter the ocean's currents and cause the Earth to slow its rotation, and that the transmission of Fluid Karma to portable receivers (via [[quantum entanglement]]) is ripping holes in the fabric of space and time.  In near-future 2008, Los Angeles (referred to as "The Southland" by locals) is a city on the brink of chaos overshadowed by the growth of an underground [[neo-Marxist]] organization. The film follows the criss-crossed destinies of Boxer Santaros, an action film actor stricken with amnesia; Krysta Now, a psychic ex-[[Pornographic film actor|porn star]] in the midst of creating a [[reality TV]] show; and twin brothers Roland and Ronald Taverner, whose destinies become intertwined with that of all mankind. The Taverner twins are revealed to be the same person by the engineers of Treer, duplicated when Roland traveled through a rift in space-time, while Boxer has become the most wanted man in the world despite his political ties and his having the fate of the future, in the form of a prophetic screenplay foretelling the end of the world, in his hands.  
Spymate
 Minkey, a super-spy primate, rescues his partner Mike Muggins (Chris Potter) from Middle Eastern terrorists. Their secretary, Edith ([[Debra Jo Rupp]]) congratulates them as the two best spies in the business, but Mike informs her that he is going to retire to be with his wife and daughter. The movie flashes forward 10 years. Mike's wife had died, and his daughter, Amelia ([[Emma Roberts]]), is a [[child prodigy]], having invented a revolutionary oxygen iodide laser drill. Amelia is about to receive the National Scientific Achievement Award from the world's leading scientists, Dr. Robert Farley ([[Richard Kind]]) and Dr. Claudette Amour ([[Musetta Vander]]). Mike tells her how proud he is, and reminds her that Minkey is in town, now the star of a circus show. Mike offers to take Amelia to Minkey's show, but Amelia laughs it off, remembering those "silly stories" he used to tell her about life as a spy.   As Amelia leaves for school, Hugo ([[Michael Bailey Smith]]), a henchman, follows her and takes pictures of her. Amelia receives the National Scientific Achievement Award, although Dr. Amour is unable to be there. As she and Mike leave, Dr. Farley videotapes Mike with a pen-camcorder. The next day, Dr. Farley shows up in a black limousine and kidnaps Amelia, telling her that her father has a surprise for her. He has a manipulated video of Mike confirming this, and Amelia happily goes with Dr. Farley. Dr Farley takes her to Japan, explaining that it is a "top-secret government program." He has built a full-scale model of Amelia's drill, but it is not working properly; Amelia begins working on it. Meanwhile, Hugo delivers a package to Mike—it's a video of Dr. Farley, who promises not to hurt Amelia as long as Mike does not contact the authorities. Mike springs into action, contacting Edith and Minkey, persuading them to come out of retirement to help him save Amelia. Minkey's new friends from the circus are enlisted as spies; while Mike and Minkey fly to Jamaica to find Dr. Amour, Edith brings the performers up to speed on the project. Apparently, Minkey was genetically enhanced and specially trained as a part of operation SPYMATE, but when the Russians moved in on the project, Mike was ordered to terminate Minkey.   After Minkey exhibited formidable [[martial arts]] skills against KGB agents, Mike requested him as a partner. Meanwhile, Mike and Minkey find Dr. Amour, who tells them that Dr. Farley plans to use Amelia's drill to cut through the Earth's crust in a Japanese volcano and harness the [[heat energy]] of the Earth's core. However, according to Dr. Amour's calculation, the energy will cause a massive earthquake that could wipe Japan off the map. Dr. Amour agrees to take Mike and Minkey to Dr. Farley's drill site. Meanwhile, Amelia is becoming suspicious of Dr. Farley. She tries to escape, but is captured and held prisoner. Meanwhile, Mike, Minkey, and Dr. Amour parachute into the drill site.   Dr. Amour and Mike are captured, but Minkey escapes with the help of a Japanese [[ninja]] [[sensei]], who "has been awaiting him." The sensei and his students tell Minkey how to breach Dr. Farley's lab and promise their help. Dr. Farley threatens to kill Mike and Dr. Amour if Amelia does not fix the drill. Amelia reluctantly tells him to put an elastic band around the drill to dampen the [[sympathetic resonance]]. Dr. Farley begins drilling into the earth and tells Hugo to kill Mike and Dr. Amour. As Mike and Dr. Amour are escorted out, Minkey ambushes Hugo. Mike fights off the other guards while Dr. Amour and Minkey run to the drill chamber. Dr. Amour distracts Dr. Farley while Mike and Minkey take out the guards in the drill chamber and rescue Amelia. More guards pour in, but Minkey's ninja friends drop out of the ceiling. Dr. Amour and Amelia stop the drill, but this causes it to explode. Mike, Minkey, Dr. Amour, and Amelia barely escape the exploding lab. Outside, Amelia exclaims to Mike that he really is a spy. Minkey receives a call from the president requesting his services in a "delicate matter" and snowboards away to more adventures.  
Special (film)
 Comic book fan Les Franken ([[Michael Rapaport]]) signs up for an experimental [[antidepressant]]. Dr. Dobson (Jack Kehler) instructs him to take one pill per day. Les creates a diary for his experiences but feels no results. His lack of self-assurance keeps him from getting to know Maggie ([[Alexandra Holden]]), a quiet girl who works at a grocery store.  After several days of taking the pill, Les experiences supernatural powers, beginning with the ability to float. Paying a visit to Dobson, he sees himself floating, but Dobson sees him lying on the floor; Les has no powers at all. He explains that Les is having an adverse psychotic reaction to the drug and orders him to stop taking it. Les instead convinces himself that he has [[telepathy]] and Dobson is mentally telling him to continue taking the drug.  Gaining self-confidence, Les quits his job in order to become a crime-fighting vigilante. He gains a reputation for tackling people after stopping a gunman from robbing Maggie's store, believing he is picking up telepathic intent from would-be perpetrators. He confides his new gifts to best friends Joey ([[Josh Peck]]) and Everett ([[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]). Their initial reaction to his supposed ability to walk through walls is curiously ambiguous. The viewer only sees what Les believes he is doing rather than what his two friends actually witness. Les offers his services to the police but has to flee when he is recognized as the mystery "crime fighter".  After Dobson learns that Les is still taking the drug and getting worse, he calls on two representatives, Ted ([[Ian Bohen]]) and Jonas ([[Paul Blackthorne]]), to talk Les out of taking the drugs. Les believes they are there to take his powers away (as he is confronted by an alternate version of himself "from a future that will now never exist"), so his "future self" stabs Jonas in the ear and Les runs off with Ted in pursuit on foot. Les "teleports" behind Ted and knocks him out and then escapes again. Just how he actually accomplishes this highly improbable sneak attack is left for the viewer to grapple with. Les then joins Everett and Joey who believe "the suits" are just as much of an hallucination as everything else.   On the way to meeting with Dobson, Les astounds his two friends by stopping a purse snatcher. Dobson claims never to have met Les before but gives the two friends a liquid to flush the medication from Les's body. Les leaves all three and finds that Jonas and Ted have broken into his apartment and are reading through his diary, talking about kidnapping him for a few days for the drug to work its way out of his system.  Dobson confesses that Les's reaction could ruin the company if the word got out. While Dobson explains that he himself was only attempting to preserve his own career and life, Les takes the opportunity to swallow the remaining pills. After Les leaves and makes Ted and Jonas "disappear", the now-invisible pair beat Les to a pulp and utterly humiliate him in the process. With an unbelievable effort of sheer willpower, Les turns the tables and knocks both men unconscious. Realizing that he is losing his mind, he runs to Maggie for help. She reveals that she likes him but has been reluctant to speak to him because of a [[stutter]]. Les admits to liking her and requests to be locked up in the restroom until the drug leaves his system.  Les awakens the following morning to find he cannot float. As Les is walking home Jonas runs him down with his car. Jonas is about to leave Les for dead when, incredibly, Les raises himself up off of the asphalt and stands defiantly there in the middle of the street. Jonas angrily backs the car into Les and sends him flying over the roof again, presumably finishing him off. This is too much for Ted and he flees the scene on foot. But Les won't stay down. In yet another fantastic feat of willpower, Les drags himself up onto his feet and faces-off with Jonas's car. Jonas intends to run Les down once and for all, but, faced with Les's unbreakable spirit, his rage drains away.  Les turns and hobbles off, a smile spreading across his bruised face.

Stay Alive
  After playing a video game titled ''Stay Alive'', Loomis Crowley, his roommate and his roommate's girlfriend are killed in the same way as their character's were killed in the game. In Loomis' case he is pushed through a bannister and hung from a chandelier by a computerised woman in a red dress.  Whilst at work Hutch, a friend of Loomis' receives a call informing him of his death (which is ruled a murder). Hutch meets Abigail at Loomis' funeral and then visits an internet cafe owned by his friend, October and her brother Phineas, both avid gamers. Hutch had received a satchel bag containing some of Loomis' possessions at the funeral from his deceased friend's sister. Phineas, whilst rooting through the bag finds  the ''Stay Alive'' game and they decide to play it as a group. Abigail and another friend, Swink, join in, with Miller playing online from his office. The game is set in a derelict mansion on Garouge Plantation, but it will not start until the six players recite "The Prayer of Elizabeth," a request for "all who resist" to perish so that their blood might keep her young. The players then fight through a cemetery of evil ghost children, heading toward a [[mausoleum]] and tower. Miller is directed by the game to pick up a rose, as a reader of occult literature, October explains that undead spirits cannot move across wild roses. In the tower, Abigail locates Elizabeth's diary with the prayer inside it, while Hutch notices that all the mirrors in the game are broken. Separated from the others, Miller finds a basement torture room full of undead girls and throws the rose to dispel the spirits. Now out of roses, the woman in red stabs and kills Miller's unprotected character. The group decides to stop playing for the night. Minutes later, the woman in red appears in Miller's office and kills him by stabbing him in the neck with conjoined scissor blades like the ones in the game.  Two detectives, Thibodeaux and King, question Hutch about the homicides. Hutch realizes that Loomis and Miller played ''Stay Alive'' right before they died, and that they died the same way as their game characters. Later, October researches Countess [[Elizabeth Bathory]], the woman in red, a real-life murderer. Bathory would drain young women of blood, bathing in it to maintain her youth. Her weakness was mirrors, because she could not stand to see herself growing old. Elsewhere, Phineas decides to play alone. Before his character can be run down by a black horse-drawn carriage, Phineas pauses the game so his character does not die. Although he believes he is safe, he is ultimately killed in real life by the same horse carriage. The survivors agree to stop playing ''Stay Alive'' until they can learn more about it. However, Detective King, a former gamer, ignores Swink's warning and plays until Bathory rips his character's head apart with a trap. Undaunted, King tries to find ''Stay Alive'' at a gaming store, but the clerk has never heard of it. After returning to his car, King is killed the same way his character died in the game.  Hutch and Abigail search Loomis' house and learn that Jonathan Malkus is the creator of ''Stay Alive''. October has discovered that the real Countess Bathory was locked in the tower of her estate as punishment for her gruesome acts and vowed to return one day for revenge. A resurrected Bathory haunted the school at Garouge Plantation, killing many girls and keeping a diary. October reveals that the Countess can only be killed by driving three nails into her body to trap her evil soul. Outside Loomis' house, October sees the countess enter a house that is under construction and follows her inside. October tries shooting the countess with a nail gun but this is ineffective due to her being transparent. October is hung upside down and her throat is slashed, killing her. Hutch and the others arrive too late to save October, leaving Hutch devastated. The three survivors realize that once the game has begun, it can play by itself. Swink volunteers to stay in a van and play the game on his laptop to distract Bathory, while Hutch and Abigail search Malkus' house. They learn Malkus' house is actually on Garouge Plantation, Bathory's estate. Swink discovers he can cause items in the game to appear in reality.  Swink leads Hutch through the cemetery towards the tower, while Abigail returns to a hidden room she had found earlier in the game. Abigail finds the blades used by Bathory, who then attacks her. Swink guides Hutch to Abigail, while throwing roses at the Countess in the game to hold her off. The Countess begins to cheat and locks Swink out of the van, while her carriage rides toward his character. Swink breaks into the van and moves his character just in time, but Bathory and her carriage come to kill him in real life, even though his character is still alive. Swink runs across a field, and falls into a patch of rosebushes as the Countess exits her carriage, with her blades in hand. Hutch and Abigail return to the van to find Swink's character dead.  Hutch and Abigail take the laptop and some of the wild roses, which they drop to deter undead children as they cross the cemetery to a mausoleum-type passageway leading to the tower. Hutch and Abigail enter Bathory's torture chamber but become separated by a door. At Abigail's urging, Hutch continues without her to perform the ritual on Bathory's body. Bathory's phantom then attacks Abigail, who has one rose left. At the top of the tower, Hutch finds the preserved, inert body of Elizabeth Bathory and hammers three nails into it, after which the evil spirit stops attacking Abigail. When Bathory's body reanimates, Hutch retreats and knocks over an oil lamp, spilling oil across the floor. Recalling that the Countess hates mirrors, Hutch uses his reflective silver laptop to repel her before setting the room ablaze. Swink, still alive and carrying more roses, bursts in with Abigail and rescues Hutch. As Bathory's body burns, the three leave the tower.  Meanwhile, the gaming store clerk from earlier is excitedly unpacking a box full of the now newly released video game ''Stay Alive''.  
Starter for 10 (film)
 In 1985, Brian Jackson is a first-year university student and information sponge. Since his working-class childhood in [[Southend-on-Sea]], Brian has loved the TV quiz show ''[[University Challenge]]'', whose famous catchphrase—"Your starter for 10"—gives the film its title. Soon after arriving at [[Bristol University]], Brian attends a party where he meets the politically conscious Rebecca, with whom he seems to have an instant connection. Brian attempts to join their ''University Challenge'' team but narrowly fails to secure a spot when he helps another potential candidate, Alice, cheat on the qualifying test. Brian falls for the glamorous Alice and tries to date her, despite her multiple signals that she only sees him as a platonic friend. As the term starts, Brian is invited to join the ''University Challenge'' team after one of the other members falls ill. The captain of the team, Patrick Watts, is a stuck-up post-grad who has managed to remain team captain despite never having achieved success on ''University Challenge''. Brian immediately impresses the rest of the team with his wealth of trivia knowledge and uses his time with the team to get closer to Alice, eventually getting invited to her house for the Christmas holiday. Unfortunately, Brian embarrasses himself in front of her family by getting stoned while trying to impress Alice. He returns to Bristol to spend the rest of the vacation and meets Rebecca again. They once more hit it off, but as they are hooking up, he inadvertently calls her "Alice", offending her and ruining the moment. Following his romantic failures, he talks with Spencer, his friend from Southend, who tells him that he is in legal trouble on account of his criminal activities. Brian invites him to a party before he has to face the judge.  During the party, Patrick insults Spencer's upbringing and belittles him in front of the rest of the partygoers. In retaliation, Spencer hits Patrick in the face and disrupts the event. In the aftermath, Brian shares a drink with Rebecca and tries to apologise for his behaviour. However, Rebecca still feels that Brian is in love with Alice and encourages him to follow his heart and tell her how he feels. He takes her advice and arrives at Alice's flat to declare his love, but discovers Spencer already there. Excited by his violent behaviour at the party, she had invited him back to her place. Brian feels betrayed by both Alice and Spencer, especially since he had told his friend how he had felt about her. Brian falls into a depression and struggles with not only concentrating during ''University Challenge'' practices, but also with his studies, threatening his university place. Patrick becomes increasingly frustrated with Brian, and just as they arrive for their ''University Challenge'' match, berates him for his lack of focus. Brian headbutts Patrick in response, but only ends up knocking himself unconscious. He is revived backstage by Rebecca who has come to watch the show and gives him encouragement before he is escorted to the set. However, as he is being brought back to his team, Brian is briefly left with an open envelope containing the quiz questions. He reads one of the cards before putting it back in the envelope, and, inspired by the relative ease of the question, rejoins his team. The match starts off poorly, with nerves clearly getting to Patrick as he fails to answer several questions and puts the team in a hole. Brian slowly but surely digs them out of it, getting into his swing as he answers question after question. As the match is heating up and Brian's team has the momentum, Brian inadvertently gives the answer to the card that he had previously seen even before quizmaster [[Bamber Gascoigne]] has even begun to read the question (he has merely introduced it as "an astronomy question"). Realising that Brian has seen the cards, Gascoigne suspends the match and Brian's team is disqualified.  Brian returns home and falls back into another depression, sleeping all day and ignoring incoming calls. His mother tries to get him out of the house, but the only person who is finally able to reach him is Spencer. He tells Brian that Gascoigne had gone easy on him, and that he is sorry for his behaviour and proud of Brian for chasing his dreams at University. Inspired by his friend, Brian returns to his studies and meets with his tutor, promising him that he is back for good. He then stands Alice up to visit Rebecca at a demonstration against nuclear weapons. He asks her if it she could ever forgive him for all the mistakes he has made, and if they can start again. She replies that he already knows the answer, and they kiss as the film ends.  
Stalin (2006 film)
 The only mission in Stalin's ([[Chiranjeevi]]) life is to help others and to make the world a better place. It turns out that Stalin served as a Major in the Indian Army. Although a war hero, he had quit the army after a rift with Lt. Col. Iqbal ([[Mukesh Rishi]]) when he transfers him to administrative division from the battlefield as a disciplinary action. His family includes his mother ([[Sharada Urvashi]]) as well as his sister Jhansi ([[Kushboo Sundar|Khushboo]]), who is not in talking terms with their mother since she got married to a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]].  Stalin keeps helping a physically challenged girl Sumati to write her intermediate examination and her suicide disturbs him. The death occurs as none of the people around her extend help. Then Stalin plans a chain system. The theme works on a principle that everyone should help others and in return they should not seek a mere thanks but tell those who get the help to help three more, with a condition that those who get help from them should also demand the same. Stalin thinks that this chain will develop helping attitude among the people. But to his dismay, he finds that the chain did not work. On one occasion, he bashes a rich boy who injured a beggar.  This goes in chain reaction and the rich boy employs some goons to attack Stalin. As Stalin disappears from the scene, the goons take Jhansi and her friend Chitra ([[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]]) into their custody. Stalin reaches the spot and hacks the hand of one goon. That goon happens to be the henchman of an MLA ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), who is also the son-in-law of Home Minister Muddu Krishnayya ([[Prakash Raj]]). Muddu Krishnayya takes it as a prestige issue and tries to eliminate Stalin but loses his son ([[Riyaz Khan]]) in the process. When the Chief Minister intervenes to bring in a patch-up, the crooked Muddu Krishnayya plans to kill him and implicate Stalin in the murder, but Stalin takes away the injured Paul Matteo and saves him, but he gets a severe chest pain due to exertion.  The reason for the chest pain is a bullet, which remained in his chest, very near to the heart. Stalin sustains the bullet injury in the Kargil war, and that was why Iqbal shifted him to administrative department. Finally, the truth prevails and the Chief Minister returns to the hospital to visit Stalin, that the help three people concept was his brainchild, which saved him from death in the form of a school girl. Finally, the doctors successfully remove the bullet, in a very delicate surgery. Stalin comes to know that his "help three people" concept worked well and the same theme saved his life in the form of auto driver. He thanks all the people for making his concept a success.  
Sri Ramadasu
 The film starts with the penance of Sage Bhadra ([[Sarath Babu]]) who becomes a hill with the blessings of [[Lord Rama]]. In later centuries, Dammakka ([[Sujatha (actress)|Sujatha]]), the tribal lady, and worshiper of Lord Rama unearths and looks after the idols of Rama on the hill and awaits someone who can constructs a temple there. On the other hand, [[Kancherla Gopanna|Gopanna]] and his cousin Kamala fall in love and marry after a small conflict with their parents. After the marriage, Tanisha, the emperor of [[Golkonda|Golconda]], with the recommendation of Akkanna and Madanna (the uncles of Gopanna), appoints Gopanna as Tehsildar of Husnabad. Thus, a Muslim who had been the Tehsildar to the place is dethroned for the sake of Gopanna. That ignites disgust among a few groups who attempt to murder Gopanna. However, Dammakka saves him while he lies unconscious on the bank of [[Godavari]]. She shows him the place of Bhadragiri and Gopanna becomes an ardent devotee of Rama. After a series of incidents, he decides to construct the Rama Mandir on the hill. He collects funds from people and with the help of Kabirdas, his guru, completes the construction of the temple. Lord Rama, Lakshmana, Seetha, and Anjaneya live in invisible forms in the place during the construction. They keep on guarding Gopanna until he accomplishes his mission. Thus, with immense bhakti on Lord Rama, Gopanna becomes Ramadasu.  The enemies of Ramadasu pass on a negative message to Tanisha about him, stating that he constructed the temple with money taken from other people without the king's permission. Exasperated, Tanisha imprisons Ramadasu. After many ordeals faced by Ramadasu in prison, Lord Rama, and Lakshmana appear to Tanisha in a dream and pay the required amount to him. Then Tanisha releases Ramadasu from prison and discovers that the two who cleared the debt were Lord Rama and Lakshmana. After being released from prison, Ramadasu is frustrated that he never obtained a darshanam (appearance/glimpse) of Rama. He realizes that Rama is in his heart and cuts open his chest. Sri Rama and Sitamma appear from his heart and heal his wounds. Rama offers Gopanna the chance to go to Vaikunta as a living man, a boon granted to few. When Gopanna asks what is there in Vaikunta (The Highest Heaven), Rama says there is only happiness and no need to pray. However, Gopanna can only find happiness in saying Rama's name. As the only man ever to refuse Vaikuntha, Rama grants his wish: Ramadasu's spirit will remain forever in the [[Bhadrachalam Temple]]. The movie ends with [[Kancherla Gopanna]], now Sri Ramadasu, looking down fondly at the temple in the modern day.

Stick It
 Haley Graham ([[Missy Peregrym]]) is a rebellious 17-year-old who has a run-in with the law when she and two friends go biking through a residential construction site. Haley is arrested and forced by a judge to return to the regimented world of competitive gymnastics. Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. One year earlier, she made it to the [[World Gymnastics Championships|World Championships]], but she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed, making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.  Haley goes to the elite Vickerman Gymnastics Academy (VGA) in [[Houston]], her ultimate nightmare, run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman ([[Jeff Bridges]]). Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again&nbsp;– at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts&nbsp;– as well as her past&nbsp;– causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against.  At the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired&nbsp;– the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley says, "It doesn't matter how well you do. It's how well you follow ''their'' rules."  In addition, Haley is severely [[stress (medicine)|stressed]] by her domineering mother, who has arrived to watch the meet. Her conduct at the World Championship ("Worlds") has not been forgotten by the other athletes, and they treat her with open hostility. Haley finally breaks down in the middle of her balance beam routine and, in a repeat of the World Championships, leaves the arena before completing the competition. Before she leaves, she reveals to Vickerman the reason she walked out of Worlds: she had just discovered that her mother was having an affair with her then-coach, and her parents got divorced as a result.  Haley then goes back to the judge who sentenced her to the gymnastics academy to inform her that she has dropped out and wants to be sent to either a juvenile hall or military academy. But the judge tells Haley that someone (obviously Vickerman) had just paid off all of her debt for the property damages in her incident with the law, that she is no longer under any legal issues, and that having jerks for parents doesn't need to ruin her life. Haley then approaches Vickerman, who confirms it by claiming that he used the money that her father had paid him for her gymnastics training. Vickerman persuades Haley to remain with the academy a while longer so she can continue with her training to reach Nationals.  Although she did not complete the invitational, Haley continues to train and, with three of her teammates Mina (Maddy Curley), Wei Wei ([[Nikki SooHoo]]) and Joanne ([[Vanessa Lengies]]), qualifies for the National Championships. The biased judging leaves her far back in the all-around standings, but this does not keep her out of the event finals. In the first event final, [[vault (gymnastics)|vault]], Mina executes an extremely difficult maneuver perfectly but receives a low score (9.500 out of 10). When Vickerman questions the judges, he learns that Mina was penalized on the technicality of showing a bra strap. Haley is next up. However, instead of vaulting, she shows her bra strap to the judges and forfeits her turn in disgust (otherwise known as a "scratch"). One by one, the other gymnasts follow suit, earning a string of zeroes and forcing the judges to award Mina the vault gold medal anyway.  Haley's bold action sparks a movement. The gymnasts talk among themselves and realize that if they could choose the winner, the judging would be fair. They convince all the others in the competition to do the same, choosing one person from each event who they, by consensus, deem the best to be the "winner". The winner completes her routine; the others jump on and off the apparatus and scratch. It seems the movement will be ruined when Tricia Skilken, a longtime judges' favorite and Haley's former teammate and best friend, arrives and threatens the choice of winners by competing herself. Trisha finally comes to her senses, though, and realizes that scratching is for the good of the competition to make a point.  What started out as a gymnastics competition turns into a small revolution for the rules and Haley. Her talents are recognized once more and her future seems to be set with numerous colleges offering her [[athletic scholarship]]s to compete in [[NCAA Women's Gymnastics championship|NCAA gymnastics]].  
Step Up (film)
 Brothers Mac and Skinny Carter and their best friend Tyler Gage attend a party where they have a fight with their nemesis, PJ. Follow the party, the trio break into the Maryland School of Arts and trash the school's theatre, damaging many of the props. When a security guard appears, Tyler helps the two escape, accepting full blame for the vandalism himself. He is sentenced to 200 hours of community service, which is to be served at the school. While working, he peers in on a dance class and meets Nora Clark, a student preparing for her "senior showcase", an audition performance which could determine whether or not she is offered a job by any one of the professional dance companies who are attending the performance. When Mac and Skinny pay Tyler a visit on the school's lot, Nora watches curiously from a window as Tyler dances with his friends, mockingly incorporating a mashup of break-dance and the ballet moves he has recently observed. When Nora's dance partner, Andrew, sprains an ankle, Nora finds herself unexpectedly without a partner for her routine. Auditioning some sophomore students to replace him, she decides that none meet her expectations. Tyler offers to help, but Nora refuses. However, after Tyler demonstrates that he can handle the routine, Nora reconsiders and convinces Director Gordon to allow Tyler to rehearse with her. During their initial practice session, Tyler is antagonistic towards Nora as well as her boyfriend, Brett, both of whom respond with haughty attitudes. As they continue to rehearse, Tyler and Nora grow closer, each teaching the other about their respective styles of dance. Tyler also befriends a musician at the school named Miles Darby, who has a crush on Nora's friend, Lucy Avila.  Nora's bond with Tyler grows, and one day she takes him to a special spot on the waterfront near a company for which her late father used to work, revealing that this is where she first envisioned her routine. She confesses to Tyler that she had always imagined it as an ensemble dance, rather than a duet. Tyler becomes inspired to help her dream come true and begins recruiting younger dancers from the school to perform in her number. Brett signs a recording deal with a company, but in doing so, betrays his friend, Miles, to get the opportunity. Disgusted by his betrayal, Nora breaks up with Brett. Meanwhile, Tyler continues to attempt a balance between his new goals, his new friends, and nurturing a troubled relationship with his old ones.  Tyler asks Director Gordon if she will let him attend the school, and she advises that he must prove to her that he deserves a chance. Upon hearing this from Tyler, Nora suggests that the showcase could also be used as his entrance audition. After dancing together at a club where Miles and Lucy perform, Tyler and Nora finally move forward with a romantic relationship. Rehearsals continue as normal, until Andrew returns seemingly healed from his injury. Tyler feels that he is no longer needed in the routine, and angrily accuses Nora of treating him the same way that Brett treated Miles. He leaves the group and returns to janitorial work, his initial community service at the school. However, in the course of the training Nora has been incorporating many of Tyler's suggestions for the routine, and as a result now finds that the new choreography is now much too difficult for the original partner to perform. During one of their practice sessions, Andrew falls over and, realizing he can not cope with the dance, resigns himself from the routine, and Nora is, once again, left without a partner. Crushed, she considers abandoning her dance career and going to college after all, but Nora receives an emotional confession and strong encouragement from her mother, who once opposed her future in dance. Nora transforms the choreography into a solo piece.  Later during a party night at Omar's house, Skinny comes by despite being told to stay at home, but ends up getting kicked out by Mac and Tyler because they promised Mac's mother he'd stay home. Frustrated, Skinny sulkily walks back home in a huff, but spots PJ arriving at a store with his friend. Skinny steals PJ's unattended car and rebelliously drives back to Omar's place wanting to hang out with the girls. Mac and Tyler try to get Skinny to abandon the car when PJ and his friends arrive and fatally shoot Skinny. After the funeral, both Mac and Tyler realize that they need to make better decisions in their lives. Tyler surprises Nora by showing up, last minute, at the evening of the showcase. He tries to persuade Nora to let him perform with her, and to forgive him for his behavior. She initially declines, but suddenly changes her mind as Tyler wishes her good luck and walks away. When the curtain opens, Tyler, Nora, and the ensemble of students perform their original choreography against Miles' latest musical score. After the performance, Director Gordon is beaming and the crowd is blown away.  Backstage, a proud Director Gordon introduce Nora to a fellow director from a professional dance company, hoping to sign Nora. Meanwhile, Mac congratulates Tyler for his best performance.  Therefore, Director Gordon introduces Tyler also, as a "transfer". Nora is and embraces Tyler. She repeats her advice to him from their first rehearsal together that he'll need to get some tights, and the two share a kiss, hoping to dance together again even more.  
Still Life (2006 film)
 ''Still Life'' is set in [[Fengjie County|Fengjie]], a city upstream of the massive [[Three Gorges Dam]]. Now marked for flooding, the city undergoes a process of self-deconstruction. Into this dying town comes Han Sanming, a coal-miner from the province of [[Shanxi]] who has returned in search of a wife who ran away sixteen years ago. Upon arriving, he asks a local motorcyclist to drive him to his former address on "Granite Street." The driver takes him to the river bank, revealing that his entire neighborhood has been flooded since the building of the dam. After a failed attempt to obtain his wife's information from the local municipal office, Han Sanming settles into a local hotel. Sanming's next stop is a rickety boat owned by his wife's elder brother. The brother informs Sanming that his wife and daughter (the real reason for his return) work downriver in Yichang but that if he remains in the city, they will eventually return there.  Sanming then befriends a local teen, Brother Mark, who helps him get a job with his demolition crew. Together, the two spend their days tearing down buildings.  The film then cuts to a second story with the arrival of Shen Hong, a nurse. Shen Hong's husband, Guo Bin had left their home in Shanxi two years earlier and had made only token attempts to keep in contact. She eventually enlists the help of one of her husband's friends, Wang Dongming, who lets her stay at his home as the two seek Guo Bin.  Shen Hong discovers that Guo Bin had become a fairly successful businessman in Fengjie.  Dongming refuses to answer whether Guo Bin has another girl on the side, though Shen Hong later finds out her husband is indeed having an affair with his wealthy investor. When Guo Bin and Shen Hong at last meet, she simply walks away. As her husband pursues her, she tells him that she has fallen in love with someone else and wishes to divorce. When he asks with whom and when she had fallen in love, she responds, "Does it really matter?"  The film then cuts back to Sanming for the final third. He has been working at demolishing buildings for some time when Brother Mark is fatally injured in a collapse of a wall (or perhaps he was murdered during a "job" contracted out by Guo Bin to gather a gang of youths to intimidate the inhabitants of a rival piece of real estate). Soon afterwards, his brother-in-law calls informing him that his wife, Missy Ma has returned. Sanming and Missy then meet. Sanming asks why she left him, to which she answers, "I was young, what did I know?" She tells him that their daughter works further south, and that she works for a boat-owner essentially as an indentured servant due to her brothers debt. Sanming attempts to take his ex-wife with him, but is informed that he will have to pay 30,000 RMB to cover the debt. He promises to do so, and makes the decision to head back to Shanxi to work in the mines. His new friends and coworkers announce that they will be following, but Sanming reminds them of the intensely dangerous nature of the work. The film ends as Sanming prepares to depart.  
Stephanie Daley
  Sixteen-year-old Stephanie Daley collapses in a pool of blood while on a school [[skiing]] trip. A doctor discovers that in the blood is [[placenta|afterbirth]]. Soon afterward, the body of a newborn baby girl is found in a [[toilet]], its mouth blocked with toilet paper. Despite Stephanie's insistence that her child was [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] and that she had no idea that she was [[Pregnancy|pregnant]], she is arrested for the [[murder]] of the child and becomes known as the Ski-Mom.  Awaiting trial, Stephanie is interviewed by a forensic [[psychology|psychologist]], Lydie Crane, who is also approximately 30 weeks [[pregnant]] with a son. Lydie is hired by the Prosecution to make an independent evaluation of Stephanie. When Lydie first meets the Daley family, Stephanie's mother is quick to stipulate that Stephanie will not accept a plea bargain. Lydie is eager to get to know Stephanie.  Lydie suspects her husband is having an affair after finding an earring that doesn't belong to her in their home; their marriage has been on the rocks since she gave birth to a stillborn child three months before she [[conceived]] the child she is now pregnant with. As Stephanie discusses her sexual history and her relationship with her parents and her child, Lydie is forced to face her hitherto buried emotions about her own child.  Through her interviews with Lydie, Stephanie talks about the father of her baby, Cory, a boy she met at a party and then slept with and never saw again because he enlisted in the Marines. When Lydie asks Stephanie if she knew she was pregnant, Stephanie avoids the questions and claims she was being "punished" by God because she was "weak", and that the pregnancy was a "test". Visibly annoyed at this, Lydie reveals to Stephanie that she had a baby girl a year before who had been stillborn, and asks Stephanie what she thinks Lydie was being punished for. Stephanie replies "you tell me."  The truth is told through flashbacks, when Stephanie is on the ski trip at her school, (none of her friends know of her pregnancy; and she doesn't reveal it to anyone) she begins to go into labour and makes it to the bathroom, where she quietly but painfully delivers the child on her own, and it is revealed through Lydie's explanation that the baby fell into the leg of Stephanie's ski pants. Stephanie says she wrapped the baby in toilet paper and left it there, but still maintains she was dead.  Meanwhile, Lydie confronts her husband about the affair; he claims he has not slept with anyone, but has indeed thought about it. He also blames the problems in their marriage on Lydie having not properly grieved for their stillborn daughter (she confides in a friend that when their stillborn daughter was cremated, in a fit of anger during an argument with her husband on the drive home, Lydie opened the window and just tossed the ashes out) and says that she does not truly want the baby she is carrying. Lydie screams in his face that she does want the child.  Soon before her trial, Stephanie is getting a glass of water and a car drives by her house with drunk young men in it who scream out, "Be the mother of my baby!" and drive off laughing, Stephanie having gained notoriety as being the Ski-Mom. This event makes Stephanie break the glass in her hand and cut her palm, severely upsetting her mother.  Before the trial begins, Stephanie returns to Lydie and says she is going to accept a plea bargain. Lydie states that she thinks this is a good idea and reaches out to shake Stephanie's hand when she notices the cut and asks what happened. Stephanie then tearfully admits the truth to Lydie, that her baby girl was alive when she delivered her, but was so small, and "her breathing was all wrong", and so in her mind she told her child to die, and she did. Stephanie believes she did kill her baby with her mind. Lydie hugs Stephanie, then thanks her.

Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)
 Harold Crick, an [[agent (law)|agent]] for the [[Internal Revenue Service]], lives his life by his wristwatch. He is assigned to audit an [[tax resistance|intentionally tax-delinquent]] baker, Ana Pascal, to whom he is attracted. On the same day, he begins hearing the voice of a woman [[omniscience|omnisciently]] narrating his life but is unable to communicate with it. Harold's watch stops working and he resets it using the time given by a bystander; the voice narrates, "little did he know that this simple, seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death". Worried by this prediction, Harold consults a [[psychiatrist]] who attributes the voice to [[schizophrenia]], though they consider that if there really is a narrator, he should visit an expert in literature. Crick visits Jules Hilbert, a literature professor, and relates his story. When Jules recognizes aspects of a literary work in Harold's story, he encourages Harold to identify the author, first by determining if the work is a comedy or tragedy.  As Harold audits Ana, the two fall for each other, but when Harold refuses to accept cookies that Ana made for him because they could be viewed as a bribe, Ana tells him to leave, making Harold believe the story is a tragedy. On the advice of Jules, Harold spends the next day at home trying to control his destiny by doing nothing, but his apartment is partially demolished by a wrecking crew that mistook the building for an abandoned one. Jules believes that since Harold cannot control the plot, he should accept his impending death and enjoy whatever time he has left. Harold takes a vacation from work, develops his friendship with his co-worker Dave, fulfills his dream of learning to play the guitar, and dates Ana. Harold reassesses his story as a comedy. When he returns to Jules with this revelation, Harold inadvertently identifies the voice in his head from a television interview as author Karen Eiffel. Jules, an admirer of Karen's work, reveals that all of her books feature the main character's tragic death.  Karen struggles from [[writer's block]] and researches ways to kill the character Harold to complete her next book. Her publisher sends an assistant, Penny Escher, to ensure the book is completed. Harold finds Karen through her tax records. When Karen learns that Harold experiences everything she writes, she is horrified by the thought that her books may have killed real people. She tells Harold she wrote a draft of his death, but has not typed it up yet; the events in the book manifest when she strikes the period key. Penny suggests Harold read the drafted ending to get his opinion. Harold cannot bring himself to read it and gives the manuscript to Jules to review. Jules confirms its excellence, labeling it as Karen's masterpiece; Harold's death is integral to its genius. Though Harold is distressed over his fate, Jules comforts him by stating the inevitability of death: this one death, at least, will have a deeper meaning. Harold reads the manuscript, then returns it to Karen, telling her the death she has written for him is "beautiful" and she should keep it intact. He spends one last night with Ana.  The next day, Harold prepares to return to work, despite Karen's voice narrating as she types up her ending. Because Harold's watch is three minutes fast owing to the imprecise time given to him days ago, he reaches the bus stop early and watches as a young boy falls in front of the oncoming bus. Karen continues writing; Harold leaps from the curb and pushes the child out of the way, but is struck by the bus. Karen cannot complete the sentence confirming Harold's death, and Harold wakes up in a hospital, injured but alive. He learns that fragments of his wristwatch blocked the right [[ulnar artery]] in his body after the collision, saving his life. When Jules reads Karen's final manuscript, he notes that the story is weaker without Harold's death. Karen admits the flaw, but points out that the story was meant to be about a man that dies unexpectedly; with Harold sacrificing himself, the story would have lost its tragic impact. In place of Harold, his wristwatch—[[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] throughout the film—is the character who died tragically.

He is then recruited by his uncle's former employers, Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones of the Special Operations Division of MI6, who explain to Alex that his uncle has been training him as a spy. Alex initially refuses to cooperate but agrees when they threaten to not renew the visa and deport Jack as a result of her visa running out seven years before. Alex is then sent to a military training camp in the [[Brecon Beacons]], the home of the Special Air Service. At first, his fellow trainees look down on him because of his age, but he soon gains their respect for his capabilities.  He sets off on his first mission, aided by gadgets from Smithers. Billionaire Darrius Sayle is donating free high-powered computer systems codenamed ''Stormbreaker'' to every school in the United Kingdom. MI6 are suspicious of his seemingly generous plans and send Alex undercover as a competition winner to investigate. There, he meets Sayle himself and his two accomplices, Mr. Grin and Nadia Vole, and is shown the ''Stormbreaker'' computer in action. Later, while Alex is having dinner with Sayle, the suspicious Vole steals Alex's phone and tracks the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] to his house in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. She goes there and finds Alex's true identity; while there, she is disturbed by and consequently fights Jack. Despite being outclassed, Jack wins with the help of a [[blowfish]], leaving Nadia to flee the scene. That night, Alex sneaks out of his bedroom window to observe a midnight delivery of mysterious containers to Sayle's lair.  The next day, Alex finds himself in trouble when his cover is blown. After attempting to escape from the facility, he is captured, and Sayle explains his true reasons behind ''Stormbreaker'' – each system contains a modified strain of the [[smallpox virus]] which, upon activation in the ''Stormbreaker'' release, will kill all of the country's schoolchildren. Sayle leaves Alex tied up and departs for the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]]. Nadia drops Alex into a water-tank to be killed by a giant [[Portuguese Man o' War]], but he escapes using the [[Electrical discharge machining|metal-disintegrating]] [[spot cream]] supplied by Smithers, Nadia is subdued when she is hit by the jellyfish, rupturing the tank in the process. Alex then hitches a ride on a [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopter piloted by Mr. Grin, using a [[Sodium thiopental|sodium pentothal]] arrow to gain Mr. Grin's obedience. Alex parachutes out of the helicopter and lands just as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] is about to press the button which will activate the computers. Alex uses a rifle to shoot the podium, which destroys the button, and ruins Sayle's plan.  Furious, Sayle leaves to carry out his back-up plan, and Alex, with the help of school friend Sabina Pleasure pursues Sayle through the streets of London. Fifty floors up on one of Sayle's skyscrapers, Alex reaches him and unplugs his backup transmitter. Sayle chases him out onto the roof and pushes both Alex & Sabina off the roof, leaving them hanging by a dislodged cable. Unexpectedly, Yassen arrives in a helicopter and kills Sayle (in the same manner he did Ian) before rescuing Alex. Yassen then tells Alex that Sayle had become an embarrassment to his employers, and that Alex should forget about him, but Alex refuses saying that the killing of his uncle Ian means they are still enemies.  Alex returns to school; he and Sabina are talking about what happened and he says that it will never happen again. The film ends with someone observing Alex from a distance. He notices it and realizes that it's not the end.

Agnieszka helps to write and then distribute these underground newsletters to try and educate workers about what is really going on in the shipyards. The shipyard officials do not approve of her new activities, so she is put on lockdown during her shifts so she cannot distribute more pamphlets. They finally find a convincing reason for firing her, theft for not returning her deceased husband’s trumpet, and so they fire her. In response to her firing, the shipyard workers all go on strike. The strikes snowball, with many other shipyards and even streetcar drivers striking in solidarity with the Lenin shipyard workers. Talks are held, and Leszek agrees to simple compromises that only affect the Lenin shipyard.

The film is divided into two parts. The first begins in the late 1980s (subtitles inform the audience of the place and year at various points in the film), as Yu Hong enters the university. Lonely and isolated despite the cramped living conditions, Yu Hong eventually befriends another student, Li Ti, who introduces her to her boyfriend '''Ruo Gu''' (played by [[Zhang Xianmin]]), and Ruo Gu's friend Zhou Wei. Yu Hong and Zhou Wei embark upon a passionate but volatile love affair just as political forces are moving towards [[Tiananmen Square]].  Two events then bring the first half of the film to a close: First, Zhou Wei, incensed at the jealousy and emotional instability of his girlfriend, begins to have an affair with Li Ti; and second, the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|crackdown]] occurs on the students on Tiananmen Square and on the campus of Beida. During all of this, Yu Hong's old boyfriend '''Xiao Jun''' (played by [[Cui Jin]]) from Tumen arrives and the two of them leave, Yu Hong deciding that she will drop out from the university.  The film then fast forwards several years, as Lou Ye intersperses the travels of his three main characters with news footage of the end of the [[Cold War]], and the 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|Hong Kong handover]]. Yu Hong has left Tumen again, first for [[Shenzhen]], and then for the central China city of [[Wuhan]], while Li Ti and Ruo Gu have moved to Berlin. Yu Hong is unable to forget Zhou Wei, and has empty affairs with a married man and a kind but quiet mailroom worker. The film follows her disaffection with society and her use of sex as a substitute for contentment. Eventually discovering that she is pregnant, Yu Hong gets an [[abortion]] and moves to [[Chongqing]] where she marries.  Li Ti, Ruo Gu, and Zhou Wei, meanwhile, live a quiet life as expatriates in Berlin. While Li Ti and Zhou Wei still occasionally make love, the former quietly realizes that the latter does not love her. Though the three friends appear happy, when Zhou Wei plans to return home to China and settle in the city of Chongqing, Li Ti suddenly commits [[suicide]]. There he connects with former classmates who in turn point him to Yu Hong's email address.  After more than ten years, Zhou Wei and Yu Hong at last reunite in the resort city of [[Beidaihe]]. While they embrace, they ask each other, "Now what?" When Yu Hong leaves, ostensibly to buy drinks, Zhou Wei understands that they can never be together and leaves as well.

Jess, the eldest daughter, is a lesbian whose bitter luck in life is being unwanted by her own father. Yet she serves Mang Rudy to the hilt after he gets bedridden and makes the common sense of allowing her girlfriend Rowena to move in at the Manansala house, not so much for their own convenience as lovers but for Rowena to help in looking after Mang Rudy and in helping out with the household chores. But when a conflict arises between Lourdes and Rowena, Mang Rudy sends Rowena away. A year later, Mang Rudy succumbs to a second attack and when he dies several months later, Rowena sets foot on the ancestral house once more to pay her last respects.

Miriam is concerned they may take their relationship to a physical level, but André seems unconcerned.  One day, Nils and Livia go sailing, but Nils returns alone saying that Livia is still sailing with a man they met, Bill Ginger (Robert Seeliger), an American of German heritage. Bill brings Livia home and seems quite taken with her, and vice versa. Miriam is concerned by Bill's flirtation with the underage girl, finding it "a little weird"; André is unimpressed with Bill's fawning compliments. Soon Livia is spending all her time with Bill, while Nils sits at home watching war documentaries.  When Livia fails to come home one night, Miriam, feeling responsible for her summer guest, drives to Bill's home to confront them about their inappropriate behavior. When she arrives, Bill casually tells Miriam that Livia went for a walk after an argument. While they wait, Bill admits how much he's enjoyed his time and conversations with Livia, after his years in America where all talk is about "money and stupidity." He assures Miriam that he knows "when to stop" with the young girl. When Livia finally returns, Miriam drives her home and learns that Livia was disappointed that they didn't have sex.  The next day, Miriam, André, and Livia join Bill for a day of sailing; Miriam and Bill take the C55 catamaran, while André and Livia take the sailboat ''Bénéteou''. During a break from sailing, Miriam expresses interest in Bill's sex life, and as they relax on a beach she starts to seduce him, but he resists her advances. The next day, while Nils and Livia are out sailing, Miriam drives to Bill's house and they have sex. Afterwards, they see Livia waiting downstairs—apparently having heard their lovemaking.   In the coming days, the family spends time at a fair and visits the Landesmuseum at the [[Gottorf Castle]] to visit the [[Bog body|bog people]] exhibit. The relationship between André and Nils continues to grow strained. Mariam returns to Bill's house and they have sex again. Afterwards, Bill breaks off their relationship, saying he is in love with Livia. The next day, Miriam and Livia are out sailing when Livia is struck in the head by the main sail boom. Livia says she is okay, and they continue sailing. Miriam informs Livia she can no longer see Bill. When Livia says she's tired and asks to turn back, Miriam dismisses her, thinking she just wants to meet Bill. Later, Livia says she feels sick and collapses, hitting her head again.   Miriam returns to shore and brings Livia to the hospital, where she dies. At home, Nils asks his father why he lied about the timing of the incident, noting if Miriam had turned back earlier, Livia would still be alive. After Nils leaves, Miriam tells André that their son is right—that when Livia was initially struck, they were still fairly close to shore. That night, Miriam packs her things and André drops her off at Bill's house. Initially, Bill does not want to see her, but later they talk about Livia. After Miriam confesses there is no one she'd rather be with, they have sex.  A few years later, Miriam and Bill, who are now a couple, visit with Livia's mother and her new suitor in Germany. Miriam and Bill left Germany in 2004 and have been living in the United States and traveling. Livia's mother reads them a letter her daughter wrote to a friend in August 2004. In the letter, Livia mentions how Miriam and her husband do not belong together, and she thinks Miriam and Bill would make a good match. She thinks she can help bring them together, to be "the happiest couple in the world." Livia's mother asks them if they are now indeed happy, and Miriam says, "Yes, we're very happy."<ref name="dvd"></ref>

Superman Returns
 For the previous five years, Superman has mysteriously abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey into outer space to investigate what astronomers believed to be an intact [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. In his absence, journalist and past love Lois Lane wrote a scathing article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman", winning her the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. Lois is engaged to Richard White, the nephew of ''[[Daily Planet]]'' editor-in-chief Perry White, and with whom she shares a young asthmatic son, Jason. Notorious criminal mastermind Lex Luthor secured an early release from prison due to Superman not appearing as a prosecution witness during Luthor's fifth appeal trial. By seducing an old heiress, Luthor is able to inherit her fortune, giving him resources for his next scheme.  Superman returns to Earth, crash landing at the Kent farm, just as he did as a child. He reveals to his adoptive mother Martha Kent that he left hoping to find his homeworld, and expresses his dismay at being the only one of his kind remaining. Upon returning to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] in his human identity of Clark Kent, he is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance.  When a mysterious nationwide power outage causes catastrophic failures during a space shuttle launch, Clark realizes he must reemerge as Superman. Saving the shuttle and its ferry jet in highly public fashion causes a resurgence of media attention regarding Superman's return. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the [[Fortress of Solitude]].  Luthor sends his [[Gun moll|moll]], Kitty, to distract Superman, allowing him to steal a sample of [[kryptonite]] from a museum. Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the [[hypocenter]] to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor plans to use the Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress of Solitude to create a massive new continent which would swallow some of the current landmasses bordering the Atlantic. The world will then be forced to use his new land. Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the new land growth by launching it into the sea.  [[File:Design fortress1.jpg|thumb|right|The Fortress of Solitude as depicted in the film.]] Lois manages to use a fax machine on board the yacht to send their location to the Daily Planet headquarters, where it catches the attention of Clark and Richard. Upon discovering her attempt at subversion, one of Luthor's henchmen attacks Lois, causing Jason's powers to emerge as he crushes the henchman with a piano &ndash; revealing that the (no longer asthmatic) Jason is Superman's son. Realizing this fact, Luthor and his thugs escape by helicopter as the earthquake effects from the growing landmass span back to Metropolis. While Superman works to contain the damage in the city, Richard reaches the yacht by way of a [[floatplane]] and releases Lois and Jason from their locked room. The three become trapped when the yacht is split in two by the growing rock formations, knocking Lois unconscious and sinking the yacht. Superman rescues them and gets them to the safety of Richard's plane.  Superman pursues Luthor, who has made his way to the growing land mass. The kryptonite shell surrounding the crystal has caused the new rock formations to be infused with kryptonite, making the land itself toxic to Superman. Luthor's thugs beat Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Luthor impales Superman with a kryptonite shard and allows him to fall into the ocean, presumably to die.  Regaining consciousness in the escaping floatplane, Lois learns that Superman has gone to confront Luthor. Knowing of the kryptonite danger, Lois convinces Richard to double back to help him. Jason spots the Man of Steel in the water and Lois and Richard get him into the plane, where Lois removes the shard. Recovering, Superman flies high into the atmosphere to regain his strength by exposure to sunlight. Using his heat vision, he then tunnels deep under the new land mass and, using the last of his strength, is able to fly it off into space before it absorbs more land.  Escaping with Luthor in the helicopter, a disillusioned Kitty discards the remaining crystals and the two eventually end up on a deserted island when they run out of fuel. Complications from kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove more fragments from his skin, they cannot revive him. Lois visits him in the hospital and whispers into his ear while glancing at Jason. Soon after, hospital staff discovers his room empty. No longer feeling alone in the universe, Superman visits his newly revealed son in the boy's room and repeats to Jason the words of his [[Jor-El|own father]] as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled "Why the World Needs Superman". Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies off into space, where he gazes down at the world.  
Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut
 On the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], criminals [[General Zod]] ([[Terence Stamp]]), [[Ursa (comics)|Ursa]] ([[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]]) and [[Non (comics)|Non]] ([[Jack O'Halloran]]) are sentenced to eternal banishment inside the [[Phantom Zone]] by [[Jor-El]] ([[Marlon Brando]]) for [[insurrection]] and murder, amongst other crimes. Thirty years later, Superman ([[Christopher Reeve]]) diverts a missile into outer space, unknowingly freeing them from the Phantom Zone.  At the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' in Metropolis, Lois Lane ([[Margot Kidder]]) suspects that Clark Kent is Superman. She tests Clark by jumping out of a window, but Clark uses his powers to save her while appearing to have done nothing. Meanwhile, with the help of Eve Teschmacher ([[Valerie Perrine]]), [[Lex Luthor]] ([[Gene Hackman]]) escapes from prison, abandoning Otis ([[Ned Beatty]]). They find and infiltrate the [[Fortress of Solitude]], learning of the impending doom brought by General Zod. Lex resolves to meet Zod, and begins tracking him. On the Moon, Zod, Ursa, and Non ruthlessly kill a group of astronauts, discovering they have superpowers due to Earth's yellow sun.  [[Perry White]] ([[Jackie Cooper]]) has Clark and Lois pose as newlyweds to investigate a honeymoon suite scam at [[Niagara Falls]]. Superman's appearance and rescue of a small boy at the Falls renews Lois' suspicions, and she tricks Clark with a gun loaded with [[blank (cartridge)|blanks]] into admitting that he is Superman. He takes Lois Lane to the Fortress of Solitude, where the two spend the night together. Meanwhile, Zod, Ursa and Non arrive on Earth and conquer a small town in [[Idaho]]. After learning that the U.S. military takes orders from the President of the United States, the Kryptonians fly to [[Washington D.C.]] and invade the [[White House]].  Superman, unaware of Zod's release from the Phantom Zone and his subsequent rampage, decides to transform himself into a human and remove his super-powers by exposing himself to red Kryptonian sunlight in a crystal chamber. On their way back to Metropolis, Lois and Clark stop at a diner, where Clark gets beaten up by an obnoxious trucker and learns of Zod's conquest of the world. Realizing that humanity is helpless, Clark returns to the Fortress to reverse the transformation. Having anticipated this decision, Jor-El's artificial intelligence reveals it has been programmed to deal with this situation by sacrificing the remaining Kryptonian energy it needs to operate. To restore Clark's superpowers, it must be joined with him, making a reality of the Kryptonian prophecy concerning "the father becoming the son" and rendering the Fortress of Solitude inoperable.  Lex arrives at the White House. In exchange for Australia, he informs Zod that Superman is the son of Jor-El, and that he has the ability to find him. He takes the three Kryptonians to Metropolis to kidnap Lois as bait for Superman. Superman arrives and a fight ensues in and over Metropolis. After saving a bus full of civilians, Superman realizes he cannot win and flies to his Fortress, with Zod, Ursa, and Non in pursuit, bringing Lois and Lex with them. At the Fortress, Luthor shows the chamber that stripped Superman of his powers to Zod, who forces Superman to again undergo the transformation process. Superman, feigning defeat, reveals by crushing Zod's hand, that he has altered the process to expose everyone outside the chamber, removing the Kryptonian criminals' powers, while protecting himself. Zod, Ursa and Non are quickly dispatched. After destroying the Fortress of Solitude with his heat vision, Superman returns Lois to her apartment, where she wishes him a tearful goodbye, realizing she can never be with him. To undo everything, Superman spins the Earth back in time, restoring the past few days and placing Zod, Ursa and Non back into the Phantom Zone. Clark returns to work the following day as Lois and Perry experience a slight case of [[déjà vu]]. Clark revisits the diner with the obnoxious trucker to teach him a lesson in humility.

Superman: Brainiac Attacks
 Brainiac crash lands on Earth and hijacks Lex Labs to collect Earth's data and amass the power of its weapons systems. Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are sent to one of Lex Luthor's laboratories after Brainiac arrives on Earth on a meteor, successfully dodging the attempts made by Luthor's satellite to destroy any potential damage to the Earth in an attempt to boost his popularity against Superman as the true hero of the people. Superman shortly arrives and finds Brainiac downloading data from the computers with information relating the various forms of weaponry from LexCorp, including the laser-equipped meteor shield that had attempted to destroy Brainiac earlier. Using his ice breath, Superman is able to seemingly destroy Brainiac, after Superman and Brainiac had engaged in battle.  Witnessing the incident, and how his satellite could be used as an effective weapon against Superman, Luthor finds Brainiac’s still intact brain chip and takes it to LexCorp, where he reactivates Brainiac. He then proposes that Brainiac, with the technology of LexCorp as well as Kryptonite, defeat Superman, and then Luthor step in to chase Brainiac away from the Earth, in front of the world to make him appear as Earth's true hero, where he will then be free to conquer other planets, leaving Lex in charge of Earth. Brainiac accepts the agreement, and proceeds to rebuilding and improving himself.  Meanwhile, Clark Kent contemplates the idea of revealing his secret identity to Lois. The opportunity presents itself when editor Perry White, due to staff shortages, sends both Kent and Lois to review a restaurant in Metropolis. During this time, however, Brainiac returns. Among his improvements is the ability to track down Superman based on his DNA. After another battle with Brainiac, Superman has been significantly affected by Brainiac's kryptonite power rays, and Lois is critically injured in the process. It is revealed that her blood has been infected with a kryptonite, metallic-based poison, that is galvanizing her blood cells and if not treated, would prove fatal.  Feeling guilty, Superman obtains a sample of Lois' blood from the hospital and returns to the Fortress of Solitude where he analyzes Lois' blood using his Kryptonian technology. It is then when Superman discovers that the only cure for Lois' condition is to obtain a chemical substance, known as Argonium 44, from the Phantom Zone. However, Brainiac is able to locate Superman in his Antarctic retreat, and attempts to downloaded the information of Krypton from Superman's computer. Superman then initiates a self-destruct sequence. Brainiac, not being able to locate Superman, presumes that he has been killed in the explosion. Superman had, in fact, gone into the Phantom Zone in order to find the Argonium 44, which would not only cure Lois and heal himself, but provide him with increased strength against Brainiac by shielding him from his kryptonite blast.  Brainiac returns to Metropolis where Luthor awaits in order to fulfill their agreement. Jimmy investigates Lex and realizes that he is working with Brainiac. Brainiac, however, intends to kill Luthor in order to conquer Earth, and had even removed the self-destructive component that Luthor had planted should Brainiac double cross him. Superman seemingly returns through a portal and cures Lois, but when bringing her out of the hospital, he realizes this experience is an illusion created by the Phantom Zone when Lois repeated goad him to stay with her and not go after Brainiac. After this, he is chased and attacked by several Phantoms before he actually escapes the Phantom Zone.  Returning to Metropolis, Superman and Brainiac engage in a lengthy battle, during which Luthor is injured in the crossfire. Mercy discovers Jimmy looking for evidence against Luthor and brutally attacks him. Eventually he takes over one of Lex's large, robotic exoskeletons and knocks her unconscious. Unfortunately, his camera is destroyed by his attack, relieving him of the chance to photograph evidence of Lex's schemes, much to his dismay. Superman seemingly defeats Brainiac and then returns to the hospital in order to cure the ailing Lois. But before Lois can take the cure, Braniac, who is now only a head, attacks the hospital and smashes the cure. Immediately afterwards, Superman finally destroys Brainiac by breaking his brain chip.   With the cure now destroyed, Lois faces certain death. Superman, regretting never telling Lois his true feelings then embraces her. It is then that his tears, containing Argonium 44 that had healed him earlier, makes contact with Lois, curing her. She presumes him to be Clark, but Superman, (having changed his mind for her safety) tells her he is just Superman. Later, Superman recovers a piece of his destroyed Kryptonian technology where he aims to rebuild his fortress. He then vows to quit his job at the Daily Planet in an attempt to prevent future harm to his loved ones, should any of his enemies discover his secret identity.  The movie ends with an injured Luthor facing criminal prosecution after the discovery of LexCorp's involvement with Brainiac's attack, and Lois racing to cover the appearance of Mr. Mxyzptlk in Metropolis.

Takeru and Minoru later have a conversation, which reveals Takeru's thinly veiled contempt towards Minoru for not having the strength to leave their dead-end hometown, but Minoru tells him he doesn't understand how things are and besides, he's fine with the way things are. Takeru later learns that his brother has taken over their family business, a run-down garage, and that his ex-girlfriend, Chieko (Yōko Maki), now works there as a gas attendant.  Chieko and Takeru later meet for drinks, and proceed to have a one-night stand. In the morning after, she hesitantly suggests she would be happy to follow him to Tokyo when he leaves, but he pretends he doesn't hear her.  Minoru realises something has happened between his younger brother and Chieko, and suggests they all should go for a walk along the Hasami River in the mountains where Takeru could take photographs. Chieko, believing this would buy more time with Takeru, immediately agrees. Wanting to get away from their town's mundaneness, Takeru agrees.  During the trip, Takeru distances himself from Chieko by walking ahead of her and Minoru. Whilst on a forested mountain, he takes photographs and through his viewfinder, sees Minoru and Chieko talking on a suspension bridge over a [[gorge]]. He looks away to take photographs of flowers.  On the bridge, Minoru tries to catch Chieko when she stumbles, but she recoils from his touch as she shouts at him to get away from her. They stare at each other for a few tense seconds. Minoru asks if she's leaving him for Takeru. Chieko replies that she has no interest in him, and never will.  Takeru glances back to the bridge and sees Minoru alone on the bridge, looking down to the gorge below, and realises Chieko has fallen from the bridge. The police locates Chieko's body in the gorge and arrests Minoru for murder. His father rejects the charge, insisting Minoru isn't the type to kill, but Takeru isn't so sure.  As the case proceeds during a courtroom trial, Takeru begins to doubt his testimony when he realises hidden resentment and deeply buried anger between Minoru and himself, which may have affected what he witnessed on the bridge that afternoon.

Take the Lead
  A group of students are preparing for a school dance. Rock arrives with a damaged ticket and is denied entry by Mr. Temple and Principal James. After leaving, Rock is provoked by a group of thugs to vandalize the Principal's car. When Pierre Dulaine comes on the scene, they all run off.   The next morning, Pierre arrives at the school to see the Principal. After explaining that he witnessed her car being vandalized, Pierre offers to take over the detention shift and teach them ballroom dancing. She agrees, although she feels sure that he will not last more than a day. His first class goes badly due to the scepticism and uncooperative personalities of the students. When Pierre returns the next morning, Principal James explains that the reason LaRhette had refused to dance with Rock the day before was because Rock’s brother was involved in a gang war, in which one of the casualties was LaRhette's brother.  At Pierre's dance studio, Caitlin is under pressure to learn to dance because her [[Cotillion ball|cotillion]] is approaching. She feels a failure and envies Morgan for her graceful sensuality, remarking to Pierre that she is "like sex on hardwood." This gives Pierre an idea of how to reach out to the kids in detention. He invites Morgan to give them a demonstration of the tango, which inspires the students to be more willing to learn. Caitlin decides to join them for dance class and practices with Monster. Though the other students suspect her of wanting to "tell her [[upper class]] friends that she's slumming" at first, they learn to accept her when she admits that she feels better with them.  LaRhette, the daughter of a prostitute, cares for her younger siblings while her mother works the streets. One night, she runs out of the apartment and to the school after one of her mother's clients attempts to rape her. While practicing her dancing, she runs into Rock, who'd gone down there to sleep after losing his job and getting kicked out of his house after a physical confrontation with his drunken father. They fight and are caught by security. Principal James wants to suspend them both, but agrees to give them extra detention with Pierre instead.  Pierre tells the class about a dance competition that he wants them to enter. Gradually, the students begin to trust Pierre; Kurd even visits his apartment to discuss his sexual problems. When the detention basement is flooded, Pierre takes the students to his dance studio to practice. The youngsters become disenchanted by the skills of Pierre's students there as well as the $200 entrance fee for the contest. However, Pierre manages to inspire them again and promises to pay the fee. LaRhette and Rock, who have now learned to respect each other, are assigned to compete in the waltz, and rivals Ramos and Danjou learn to share Sasha during practice.  Mr. Temple complains about the school's resources being wasted on the dance program. When Pierre is brought to a meeting with the parents' association, he convinces them to keep the program going after demonstrating how ballroom dancing has taught the students "teamwork, respect, and dignity". On the night of the contest, Rock is told by the gang he has joined that he must participate in a theft. He intentionally shoots the sprinkler system, setting off the alarm, and all have to flee.  At the competition, it is announced that a $5000 prize will be given to the winning team. Monster intervenes in the cotillion and saves Caitlin from tripping. Sasha, Danjou, and Ramos perform an impressive three-person tango but are disqualified because the event is a [[partner dance]]. Morgan is awarded the prize but defuses the tension by calling it a tie and giving Sasha her trophy. Principal James is impressed with the success of the program and tells Pierre she is making it permanent. Rock arrives at the last minute to dance the waltz with LaRhette, whom he kisses at the end. The final credits roll as Pierre's students triumphantly dance to [[hip hop]] music, having tampered with the sound system.  {{Quote box  |title = Closing exposition  |quote = Since "Dancing Classrooms" was created by Pierre Dulaine, it has grown to involve 42 instructors and more than 12,000 students in 120 New York City public schools.

So he convinces Pam to teach him how to become the type of person that Cindy would like.  In a conversation with Elliot, Eugene admits that he has feelings for Pam.  Elliot is thinking about telling Natalie who they really are.  However, Pam overhears the wrong part of the conversation and thinks that Eugene doesn't like her.  Cindy manages to convince Doogie to take a large and valuable ring (a family heirloom) from a safety-deposit box.  While he is taking the ring to Cindy, Paul comes by so Doogie throws the ring in the back of a parked pickup truck.  The truck happens to be Eugene's which they drive off in before Paul can retrieve the ring.  Doogie does find the truck again, after it is parked again, and drives off in it himself.  Elliott and Eugene are able to follow the truck closely enough to hide close by while Paul is giving Cindy the ring.  While Paul isn't looking, Cindy switches the ring with a fake.  Shortly thereafter, the police arrive, having been called by Cindy.  Elliot and Eugene reveal themselves and explain that Cindy put the real ring in her purse.  The police search her purse and find the real ring.  Paul, Cindy, Elliot and Eugene are all taken into custody.  They wait in the police station while things are sorted out.  The Harris family comes to the police station to retrieve Elliot and Eugene.  Cindy, in custody, passes by and says, "It looks like I'm not the only on who's not what he appears to be."  At this time, Elliot decides that they must reveal who they really are.  Elliot and Eugene remain in town until the trial is over.  It turns out that Cindy works for the insurance company holding the policy on the ring.  She had all of the details so she had a fake ring made.  It didn't matter to her which brother she got to get the actual ring.  She was planning on switching the ring, having it found out as a fake, the Hamilton brothers would be arrested for fraud and she would have the actual ring.  Paul was convicted of stealing the ring (because his brother was the legal owner) and received a sentence of six months of probation.  Cindy was convicted of receiving stolen property and received a sentence of two years in prison.  Elliot and Eugene each decide to find work so that they can stay in town.  Natalie and Pam also decide to forgive the respective brothers and continue their relationships.

The Frenchman soon outperforms both Bobby and Naughton to become Dennit Racing's latest success story.

Tales from Earthsea (film)
 The crew of a [[war galley]] are up against a storm. Suddenly two [[dragon]]s are fighting above the clouds, during which one is killed by the other (an occurrence believed impossible).  News of the kingdom declining and nothing heard from Prince Arren troubles the King of Elad. The Wizard Root speaks of dragons and men being "one", divided by their particular desires (freedom and possessions respectively), which is the cause of the world's "Balance" weakening. Suddenly the King is fatally stabbed in a dark corridor by his son, Arren, who steals his father's sword and flees the palace while his father dies.  In the desert, Arren is rescued from dire wolves by the Archmage Sparrowhawk. Together they travel to the city of Hort Town. When Arren explores the town alone, he rescues a young girl named Therru from slavers, but is later captured by the same slave master, Hare. His sword is discarded in the sea. Sparrowhawk rescues Arren from the slave caravan and takes him to a farm run by Sparrowhawk's friend Tenar, who lives with Therru.  Sparrowhawk's intervention against Hare's slave caravan angers Lord Cob, a powerful wizard and the ruler of Hort Town, who wants the archmage brought to the castle. Meanwhile, Sparrowhawk tells Arren that he seeks a way to restore the upset Balance, then resumes his search in Hort Town. While there he buys Arren's sword from a merchant's stall and manages to evade capture from Hare whilst learning about Cob's castle.  Arren confesses to Therru that he killed his father and that he feels an unknown presence following him. Because of this, Arren leaves the farm, but is met by the presence, which is a mirror image of himself. Arren falls unconscious after stumbling into a swamp while fleeing from the image. Cob takes him to the castle, where he manipulates him into revealing his "[[Characters in Earthsea#Nom|true name]]", Lebannen, to control him. Meanwhile, Hare captures Tenar as bait to lure Sparrowhawk into the castle leaving Therru tied to a post as a messenger. She frees herself, and encounters Sparrowhawk, who gives her Arren's sword to give to Arren. Sparrowhawk breaks into the castle to save Tenar and confronts Cob. Sparrowhawk learns that Cob is causing the world's Balance to collapse by opening the door between life and death to try and gain eternal life. Sparrowhawk tries to warn Cob of the dangers of upsetting the Balance, and Cob sends Arren out to kill him. Sparrowhawk frees Arren from Cob's control but is captured by Hare, his power having been weakened within the stronghold of Cob's castle.  Meanwhile, Therru sees the same copy of Arren and follows him to the castle, where he reveals that he is the light within Arren and tells Therru his true name. Therru enters the castle and learns of Sparrowhawk and Tenar's sunrise execution. She finds Arren, guilty and hopeless, and brings hope back to him, calling him by his true name and confiding in him her own true name, Tehanu. They rush to rescue Sparrowhawk and Tenar. Arren confronts Cob, who tries to kill him, he fights back and finally unsheathes his sword, which was sealed with magic. Arren cuts off Cob's staff-holding hand. Unable to use his magic powers, Cob rapidly begins to age. He captures Therru and flees to the highest tower of the castle, with Arren in pursuit. Cornering Cob, Arren tries to explain what he learned about life and death from Therru and Sparrowhawk to Cob, but Cob refuses to listen and uses the last of his magic to strangle Therru to death. However, she does not die as she has eternal life, and instead becomes a dragon. Therru kills Cob by burning him alive and rescues Arren from the collapsing castle tower.  Sparrowhawk and Tenar leave the castle, and meanwhile Therru and Arren land in a field where Therru changes back into a human. Arren tells Therru he will leave for home to repent for his crime, but will come back to see her some day. After Arren and Therru reunite with Sparrowhawk and Tenar, the four of them spend time together. Arren and Sparrowhawk depart for Enlad, bidding Therru and Tenar goodbye. Therru looks up to see dragons peacefully flying in the sky, indicating that the world's Balance is returning to normal.

Takva: A Man's Fear of God
 Humble and devout Muharrem lives in a solitary and meager existence of prayer and sexual abstinence. His extraordinary devotion attracts the attention of the [[Sheikh]] of an Istanbul [[Sufi order]] who offers him an administrative post as a manager for the seminary properties that support a school for orphans and poor children. Muharrem's new job throws him into the modern outside world he has not experienced before. He soon witnesses conflicting attitudes and dilemmas towards alcohol, charity and honesty. He notices that he himself has become proud, domineering and even dishonest. To make matters worse, Muharrem's inner peace is unnerved by the tormenting image of a seductive woman who tempts him in his dreams, both night and day. With the balance of his devotion now upset, his fear of God begins to eat away at his senses. He remains steadfast seeking forgiveness from Allah and guidance from his Sheikh in whom he has complete faith.  The Sheikh is portrayed as evidence of how power can corrupt. Throughout the story the Sheikh guides Muharrem on the mystical path, however, Muharrem is confused by the Sheikh's uncharitable insistence that rent is collected from everyone, even those who cannot pay. When Muharrem faces his greatest spiritual crises, the Sheikh, being on retreat, is unavailable to counsel him.  However, it is possible as seeing the actions of the Sheikh as pushing his fuqarat (student) beyond his comfortable monastic boundaries. The teacher may have given Muharrem this test to help him to grow and as a test of his character. There is a saying along the lines of 'Money will reveal a person's true character, if they are generous, they will be more so, if they are greedy, it will be apparent'. Muharrem, at first, is fair with money. He has compassion for the family that cannot pay their rent. When he is pushed by the Sheikh to collect from everyone, even those who cannot pay, a shift happens as he is faced with the crisis of following his inner voice and the directions of his beloved Sheikh.  The film ends with him experiencing an excellently portrayed crisis of spirit, driven by his inner piousness clashing against the jarring change he sees in himself, brought upon by his new job that thrust him unprepared into the modern world. He ends up catatonic in bed, being cared for by the Sheikh's daughter, yet completely oblivious to her presence.

Condemned to performing menial duties for the officer and his family while sleeping in an unheated shack next to the latrines, Morosgoványi frequently escapes into fantasy. So realistic are these fantasies that in one ambiguous instance, Morosgoványi sleeps with and impregnates the lieutenant's wife and "wakes up" to find himself engaged in an act of [[sodomy]] with a slaughtered pig. Upon seeing this, the lieutenant promptly executes Morosgoványi and raises the son, Balatony Kálmán, as his own.  Decades later, Kálmán has grown into a champion Hungarian [[competitive eating|speed-eater]]. Coached and influenced by the strict Jenő, Kálmán's life revolves around training for the eventual day when the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] recognizes speed-eating as a legitimate sport. After a bout of [[trismus|lockjaw]] at a Soviet event and eloping with fellow speed-eating champion Aczél Gizi, Kálmán resumes his rigorous training, even as Gizi gives birth to their son, Balatony Lajoska.  Some years later, Lajoska has grown into a dedicated, professional [[taxidermy|taxidermist]]. In contrast to both his parents' girth, Lajoska appears pale and impoverished, with a thin anemic frame and haunted visage. When not working from his taxidermy shop or failing in his attempts to lead a normal life, Lajoska purchases groceries for his father Kálmán, who has grown so monstrously obese that he cannot leave the chair in his [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] apartment. Kálmán, who feeds butter to his caged cats, has nothing but harsh words for his son who, upon reaching his breaking point, abandons his father to his own prison. Returning later, he discovers that the cats have escaped their cages and, desiring meat, have eviscerated his father.  Lajoska stuffs his father and the cats.

Tathastu
 Ravi Rajput comes from a poor family; his father was a foreman at a mill, and could not afford to send Ravi to a private school. Ravi studied in a municipal school, got a job in a mill, married Saru, who subsequently gave birth to their son, Gaurav. The proud parents watch as Gaurav grows up, starting walking, talking, and feigning illness just to stay home and watch [[World Cup Cricket]]. Their lives are turned upside down when Gaurav faints while playing cricket.  They take him to the nearest hospital in [[Bandra]], where Doctors Nita and Sen inform them that their son is dying and will not survive unless he receives a [[heart transplant]], the cost of which is 15 lakhs rupees. A heart is available for transplant but the hospital will only perform the surgery on receipt of the money.  A desperate Ravi turns to his [[insurance company]], which declines to renew his policy citing an obscure clause; his employer, with whom he has worked for over 11 years, refuses to sanction above Rs.75000/-.  When nothing works out and Dr. Sen informs Ravi that his son will soon be discharged and will probably die soon after, he gets a gun, holds 30 people [[hostage]] in the hospital until the doctor agrees to operate on his son. DCP Rane is assigned to this matter and his orders are to kill Ravi and end this drama. Meanwhile the hostages realize how good a man Ravi is when he lets a pregnant woman deliver with full medical care, helps a woman facing [[domestic abuse]] as well as an elderly gentleman whose son values money more than his father. Outside, he becomes a dark hero when the media reports that he is doing it to save his son, with a huge crowd gathering in his support.  But Ravi persists and is finally told that Gaurav will soon be operated upon. Relieved, Ravi decides to release all the hostages.  He then sees that while a surgery is taking place, it is of an elderly politician (the President of the ruling political party, Narayan Swami), rather than his son. In desperation, he decides to end his life and give his heart to his son. After meeting his son for a few moments, he walks out with the hostages (who have all decided to support him) and his wife and proclaims to the world that he will end his life and give his heart to his son.  As he is about to shoot himself, the deputy leader of the ruling political party comes and asks him to listen to him. He informs him he has spoken to the President who has decided to forgo his life since he loves children, requesting that the heart be given to the child. He assures Ravi that it is true and also that the party will take care of all the expenses of the operation. The entire crowd applauds the deputy leader and Ravi lowers his gun. When the deputy leader's assistant comes to him and inquires (in a whisper) urgently that what will happen to the President and that the President said no such thing, the deputy leader tells him that this is politics. If they had operated and saved the President's life, then this entire crowd who is pro-Ravi would have thrown them out of power. Now by sacrificing the President, they have gained huge popular support and will win the next elections.  Ravi is arrested and taken to court. The judge takes a very lenient view of the situation based on the hostages' evidence and sentences Ravi to a light sentence of six months. DCP Rane leads the applause from the entire court as Ravi looks on. The film ends with Gaurav playing cricket and his parents watching him.

Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny
  As a young man, JB (Jack Black) leaves his religious family and oppressive Midwestern town for Hollywood on a quest to form the world's most awesome rock band. There he meets acoustic guitarist KG (Kyle Gass), who is performing on the street, and begins worshipping him as a rock god because of his skills and attitude. KG feeds JB's fantasy by pretending to be famous with a self-named band ("The Kyle Gass Project"), and exploits him to do work such as cleaning his apartment and buying him weed (under the promise that JB can audition for his fictitious band.) After JB learns KG is actually unemployed and living off his parents, the two become equal, and KG apologizes to JB by giving him a brand-new guitar. They create their own band: Tenacious D, named for birthmarks found on their buttocks. (JB has a birthmark which says: "Tenac", and KG has a mark which reads: "ious D".)  Soon JB and KG learn the deepest secret of rock: all the rock legends used the same guitar pick, "the Pick of Destiny," which has supernatural powers. It was created by a dark wizard from a piece of Satan's tooth, as a gift to a blacksmith who saved his life from the great demon. The pick gives its holder unnatural abilities with stringed instruments. Infatuated by the prospect of becoming the next great rock star, JB immediately sets Tenacious D on a quest to steal the Pick of Destiny from a rock history museum. Along the way, the band briefly splits up, when KG decides that sex comes first in "sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll" after getting invited to a party, while JB wants to stick to the mission at hand. They are eventually reunited after KG is kicked out of the party.  Later, the two manage to steal the Pick of Destiny due to incompetent security at the rock museum. Armed with this supernatural pick, they plan to use the winnings from a local bar's talent contest to pay their rent, but before they can go on stage, they argue over who gets to use the pick first, snapping it in half accidentally.  After a pep-talk from the bar's owner, they decide they are good enough to go onto the contest without the pick, not knowing that the owner is Satan in human form, looking for his missing tooth piece. Coming back outside (deciding they can both use half of the pick), they are confronted by Satan, who is "complete" when he places the Pick of Destiny back on his broken tooth, giving him the ability to use his supernatural powers on Earth.  He threatens to make Tenacious D his first victim.   To save their lives, Tenacious D challenge Satan to a "rock-off", which he cannot deny, as the "demon code" strictly forbids him from declining such a challenge.  As the bargain goes, if Tenacious D wins, Satan must return to hell on his own and pay their rent.  But if Satan wins, he gets to take KG back with him as a sex slave. Ultimately, they lose (KG sings, "That was a masterpiece! / He rocks too hard because he's not a mortal man."), and Satan attempts to shoot KG with a bolt of energy.  JB jumps in the way, and the bolt bounces off his guitar, blowing off a piece of Satan's horn. JB is able to send him back to Hell with a magical incantation. (As explained earlier, should Satan become "incomplete", he can be banished from the Earth with said incantation.)   The two turn Satan's horn into the "Bong of Destiny" and the movie closes with the two smoking from it as they write new songs.  
Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo
  Jump City is attacked by a Japanese ninja called Saico-Tek. The Teen Titans manage to capture him, having their tower damaged in the process. Under interrogation, Saico-Tek reveals the identity of the one who sent him - [[List of minor characters in the Teen Titans animated series#Brushogun|Brushogun]] - and then ruptures the room's fire extinguisher system and mysteriously vanishes. Subsequently, the Titans head to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], to search for his master.  Upon arriving Tokyo, after overcoming the [[language barrier]] and fighting a [[Gorgo (film)|Gorgo]]-like giant reptile, the Titans meet Tokyo's own supernatural defense force - the Tokyo Troopers - led by Commander Uehara Daizo. He shows the Titans around the Tokyo Troopers headquarters, and when Robin questions him on Brushogun, Daizo claims that Brushogun is nothing more than an urban legend.  Left with no villains to pursue, the Titans can do nothing but enjoy Tokyo as tourists. Robin and Starfire explore Tokyo, and while sitting on Tokyo Tower they finally start to express their feelings for each other. They are about to share a kiss together, when suddenly Robin starts to focus on Brushogun again, and tells Starfire that they are heroes and can't be anything more to each other. Upset, Starfire flies away. Investigating alone, Robin is attacked once again by Saico-Tek and they get into a violent fight, which ends with Robin pummeling the ninja into the ground. When Saico-Tek does not rise, the crowd watching believes Robin has killed him. Despite his protestations of innocence, Robin is apprehended by Daizo. Elsewhere, Starfire is approached and comforted by a little girl, helping Starfire to overcome her depression and make her realize that despite Robin's earlier objections, both of their romantic feelings for each other are indeed truly mutual.  The Mayor of Tokyo announces Robin's arrest and orders that the other Teen Titans must either turn themselves in or leave Tokyo at once. Starfire calls the other Titans for an emergency. They are about to regroup when Brushogun sends out his minions to destroy the Titans. Meanwhile, as Robin is being transferred to a more secure facility, a slip of paper bearing the name "Brushogun" fits into the armored car carrying him and explodes, freeing him. Now on the run, Robin co-opts the identity of a [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] mugger to collect information that Brushogun is in fact real, but the Tokyo Troopers cover up his existence to prevent inspiration for criminals. He is eventually found by the Tokyo Troopers, which leads to a car chase. Robin is surrounded front to back when Starfire comes to his rescue. Starfire takes Robin to a shrine hideout, where they try to kiss again when suddenly Cyborg, Raven, and Beast Boy, who have come back safely, barge in on them.  Cyborg then shows that he done a chemical analysis on the stains on Robin's uniform and discovered that it wasn't blood but ink, just like the similar stains the others got during their fights. Raven relates from a book she found that Brushogun was an artist who dreamed of bringing his beloved drawings to life using Japanese dark magic. The spell ultimately turned against the young artist, and he was transformed into Tokyo's first super villain, Brushogun, a being of paper and ink - capable to bring any creation he could imagine to life - until he suddenly disappeared. Robin realizes that he didn't kill Saico-Tek because he wasn't real to begin with, and he was set up to make him look like a criminal. Robin dons his costume again before they are discovered and chased around the city by the Tokyo Troopers. With the knowledge they've gained, Robin tracks Brushogun to a comic book publishing factory. Breaking in, the Titans discover the withered form of Brushogun, trap-wired into a cursed [[printing press]] that taps into his powers to create the enemies the Titans have faced. He reveals that he had sent the first Saico-Tek to the Titans to summon them to Tokyo in order to stop the real culprit who had enslaved him: Daizo himself, who used Brushogun's power to create both his Tokyo Troopers and the monsters that they captured in order to gain a reputation as a hero.   Daizo drops in on the heroes and forces Brushogun to create an army of animated ink minions. A mass battle ensues, culminating in Robin facing Daizo. With no options of escape left, Daizo hurls himself from a catwalk into the ink reservoir of the press, taking control of Brushogun's magic and transforming himself into a giant, hulking mass of ink and machinery, with Brushogun at the center. As the other Titans battle the creatures Daizo hurls at them, Robin frees Brushogun, causing Daizo to lose control of his power and burst. Brushogun dies peacefully in Robin's arms, disabling his powers and defeating Daizo. With the battle concluded, Robin and Starfire share a kiss.

The emperor's only son has recently been killed by the Turks and the [[Byzantine emperor]]  is too old  to lead his army in battle. Constantinople is under threat of an Ottoman invasion and therefore it is in desperate need of a skilful military leader. Upon arrival, Tirant is received by the emperor who makes him commander in chief of the Imperial army.  After he is presented to the empress, Tirant catches a glimpse of the breasts of the emperor's only surviving child, nosebleed-prone daughter Carmesina. A fanciful teenager who has just turned nubile, the beautiful Carmesina is also quickly smitten by the brave and handsome Tirant.

As brave and skilful military leader as Tirant  might be, he is neither of royal blood nor has a fortune of his own to aspire to marry the heiress of the empire. Carmesina's friends and confidantes, her maidens: Pleasure-of-My-Life and Estefania, think otherwise. Scared of a possible Ottoman invasion, Pleasure-of-My-Life,  the daughter of the court's poet, encourages Carmesina interest in Tirant as she is to inherit the throne and he is going to defend it. Estefania, another lady-in-waiting, supports Tirant's affair with Carmesina because she has fallen in love with Tirant's right-hand man Diafebus. Meanwhile, the Empress contemplates that Constantinople stands no chance against a Turkish onslaught and sees her daughter's marriage to the Sultan as the sole way to accommodate him.  In his first battle against the troops of Mehmed IV, nicknamed The Greart Turk, Tirant scores a triumph, but he returns to the Byzantine court with a wound in one shoulder and with the Ottoman threat still looming over Constantinople. Pleasure-of-My-Life tries to consolidate Tirant's romance with the princess awakening Carmesina's desire for him.

The next day, Tirant tries to hide what had occurred, simulating a fall from a horse, but he breaks his other leg and ends up bedridden.  Meanwhile, the Empress begins an affair with Hippolytus, a young member of Tirant's entourage. The couple barely escapes being found together in bed by the emperor. A Turkish emissary arrives  at the Byzantine court to ask for Carmesina's hand  in marriage for Mehmed IV. The Emperors asks for a day before he can gives his consent, but Carmesina takes matters on her own hands. In broad daylight, she goes to Tirant's tent and  has sex with the bedridden hero. When Carmesina refuses to marry the Great Turk because she has been with Tirant, war breaks out. In the decisive battle, Tirant kills  the Turkish sultan, but he returns from the battlefields badly wounded and dies on the way back. Carmesina dies of grief.

Thutturi
 Put a few children together to be themselves. Lo! They create a wonderful world of their own deriving immense pleasure in PLAYING - and 'learning' through it sub-consciously. Playing in open space is quite different from playing within the four walls of home. Open space provides greater scope for interaction, experimentation and learning besides multiplying the thrill of playing. There lies the imperative need for playgrounds. But where are the playgrounds! Thanks to the indiscriminate growth of concrete jungles of ever-growing cities, there is hardly any open space, let alone proper playgrounds - particularly in the localities where poor and middle class children reside.   This film Thutturi (The Bugle) is an attempt to highlight this problem to raise the consciousness of society about the imperative need of nearby playground for children in each locality.   The story goes like this. Confined to homes for most of the year with heaps of homework and preparation for dreaded examinations, children jump with joy with declaration of summer holidays. That is when they are 'allowed' to go out and play.   Lack of playground in the locality compels them to play in streets. Thanks to blazing publicity, cricket and computer games seem to be the only games these city children are exposed to. The arrival of a village boy opens them up to the joys of rustic village games. Broken glasses, obstruction to traffic etc. leads parents to advise children not to play in the streets. They go out in search of a place to play and find a vacant land full of stones & thorns. They plead with the owner of that land - a well-meaning lonely old man left to himself with a lot of riches and also a lot of health complaints. They get his permission to play there. Old man is quite impressed with the way children were clearing up the whole place. He becomes one with them in creating a beautiful playground there with novel ideas drawn from David Werner's famous book on creative use of readily available things around. He proclaims that the playground henceforth belongs to them. Mingling closely with children helps him regain his zest for life. In their company he finds a new meaning to his life. He starts spending more and more time playing and roaming around joyfully with children. His health starts improving.   Old man's only son (Hari), settled in America, is not happy with his father's association with 'street children' as he calls them. He arrives on the scene with his little son (Abhi). Abhi is quite attached to his grandfather. Abhi derives great joy playing with other kids, unmindful of Hari's objections. Hari's admonition of Abhi embarrasses and hurts the old man. To retrieve Abhi and old man from 'street children', Hari virtually orders them to pack-up and move to America immediately, much against his wishes. Hari's rudeness puts old man in a state of shock. He loses his speech and becomes bed-ridden. Hari cleverly uses this opportunity to keep the children away from Abhi and old man. Hari is unmoved by children's pleadings & parents request and, arranges for demolition of the playground to build a commercial complex. Unable to see their fruits of labor (playground) going out of their hands, children obstruct demolition. Children & parents are taken to police station. Embarrassed parents punish their children and order them to remain indoors...   Finally, these children manage to regain their playground with the help of old man. A realised Hari endorses the old man's gift of playground to children.   The film ends with the old man appealing to all parents for dealing with children the right way and grooming them for their all round development providing space for both studies and play.

Mi-Ja, the caretaker of her ex-teacher, Ms. Park, organizes a reunion with her ex-classmates: Se-Ho, Eun-Young, Dal-Bong, Sun-Hee, Myung-Ho, and Jung-Won. Each resent Ms. Park for different reasons: the couple Se-Ho and Eun-Young because of Ms. Park's belittling of their poverty; Dal-Bong because of his cast leg caused by Ms. Park punishing him to do repeated squatting after losing a relay during a track and field meet; Sun-Hee because of Ms. Park's criticizing of her former obesity; and Myung-Ho because of his trauma of Ms. Park sexually abusing him. The friendless and quiet Jung-Won, once ridiculed for defecating in the class, stopped attending school when his mother was hit by a car and has only recently met with Ms. Park again since the previous year. Nevertheless, they all try to maintain a facade of jolliness for the reunion.  One by one, though, tensions arise and the ex-students become more open about their anger. Se-Ho drunkenly explodes with anger during the barbecue party and accuses the others of lying to themselves. He heads for the beach where a bunny-masked figure attacks and drags him to the basement, where he is killed. Eun-Young tries to indirectly drown Ms. Park while the latter is bathing, though it fails due to Mi-Ja's intervention. She is attacked by the bunny figure at the bedroom and killed in the basement. Next, Dal-Bong tries to attack Ms. Park while the latter is vulnerable at the bed, but is attacked by the bunny figure, who inserts insects into his ear to kill him. Throughout the murders, flashbacks show the ex-students laughing at Ms. Park's deformed son who wore a bunny mask to hide his face. Only Jung-Won wanted to befriend him, but Ms. Park mistakenly assumed him as the bully and brushed him off. Sun-Hee and Myung-Ho talk at the beach about their traumatic experiences with Ms. Park. They are alerted by Mi-Ja discovering the other three's bodies at the basement. Sun-Hee uses this opportunity to take Ms. Park to the forest and tries to throw her off the cliff, but is interrupted by Mi-Ja. In the ensuing struggle, Sun-Hee falls off the cliff to her death. Mi-Ja drives Ms. Park back home but is knocked out by Myung-Ho, who would have immolated his ex-teacher alive if not for the bunny figure killing him. The figure, revealed to be Jung-Won, is stopped from harming Ms. Park further by Mi-Ja.  Detective Ma investigates Jung-Won's supposed apartment. All he finds is his mother's decaying corpse, women's clothing, and articles about the success of Ms. Park's ex-students, contrary to Mi-Ja's claims. It is revealed that there is no male ex-student of Ms. Park bearing the name "Jung-Won"; it is instead the real name of Mi-Ja. She fabricated the story about her life to her classmates: she was poor, obese, broke her leg after doing Ms. Park's punishment, and "defecated" in the class, which was actually her blood mixing up with dung during her first menstruation. Her mother was handicapped during the car accident and died when she was an adult. Jung-Won then took the identity of Mi-Ja and became Ms. Park's caretaker until she could kill her classmates at the reunion by poisoning them in front of Ms. Park.  Jung-Won drives Ms. Park to the beach and vents her frustration at her before committing suicide by jumping from the pier, which Ms. Park can only watch on. The film closes with Ms. Park's wheelchair lying empty on the pier.

Angry at Tom for not warning him about the curse (not knowing that he can't talk), Ron expects him to row all the way to the island where the treasure is buried. Tom, however, leaves Ron's men stranded and takes only himself and Jerry (who has the map on his forehead) to the island.  When they arrive, they meet Purple Pirate Paul, Ron and Bob's brother (who can, ironically, speak coherent English, whereas his parrot can't), who calls himself Barnacle Paul because he doesn't want be in the "color scheme name thing" his brothers are doing. He, too, is looking for the treasure, but is discouraged, having searched for over 40 years. Tom and Jerry are about to go on when Ron arrives and tells Paul that Tom has the map. Tom and Jerry run until they reach the entrance to the tomb of Don Diego.  A stone chicken guards the tomb, but Tom and Jerry defeat it. After maneuvering through many traps and tests, they reach the cave that contains the treasure. Tom rushes inside and is shocked to see the same giant squid standing guard. When it recognizes Tom, it shrieks in fear, and a [[stalactite]] crushes it. Tom and Jerry retrieve the treasure.  When Tom exits the tomb, Ron, Paul, and Bob begin to fight over the treasure. Jerry seizes this opportunity to sneak it away and onto Bob's ship, which has been fully repaired. Tom uses a palm tree to catapult himself onto the ship.  In the pirate ship, Jerry and Spike control it with Jerry being made to be the captain while Tom is made to swab the deck. Then the ship leaves leaving Ron, Bob, Paul and their crews behind. Meanwhile, they remain on the island, running from the stone chicken, which somehow reassembled itself.

 Transparent follows the lives of 19 female-to-male transsexuals as they recall their encounters giving birth to and raising children while transitioning. For most, they did not view it as a weird concept to explain to their kids, especially at a young age, because none of the politics had to go into their explanation, they could simply state the facts and the children were accepting of that. For example, the common explanation to their children was that they were “born with a girl body but a boy heart.” In addition, they still felt as though they were their child’s mother because biologically, they were, they just were no longer a mother figure. However, most of them were still being referred to by their child as “mom”.  Although most of them were in agreement about the issues discussed, the topic of how they felt during pregnancy was a little different. Some felt that it was the only time they felt right with their bodies and they enjoyed the experience overall, while others felt humiliated and like it was a slap in the face – concrete evidence this wasn’t who they really were.

[[Mark of Cornwall|Lord Marke]] of [[Cornwall]] plans to unify the peoples of Britain – [[Celts]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]] – under himself as [[high king]] to resist [[Ireland|Irish]] domination.  Most lords agree to this, as Marke is highly regarded and respected as a fair and courageous leader. The Irish king Donnchadh discovers this and sends troops to attack a [[Tantallon Castle|Jutish castle]] where a treaty between the British tribes is being discussed. The raid claims the lives of the castle's lord and his wife, but Marke manages to save their son, [[Tristan]], at the cost of losing a hand. Feeling compassion for the young boy, whose father loyally supported him, Marke welcomes Tristan into his home and regards him as a son.   Nine years later, Tristan has grown into a fierce, courageous warrior whose loyalty to Marke is that of a son to his father. Tristan and other Cornish warriors launch an attack on an Irish slave caravan. Tristan fights Morholt, the champion and leader of the army of Donnchadh, whose lord's daughter, [[Iseult|Princess Isolde]], has been promised to Morholt in marriage. Though Tristan kills Morholt and Donnchadh's forces are overrun, he is severely wounded in the fight and believed dead, though he is in fact only suffering the effects of Morholt's poisoned sword.  Tristan's body is put out to sea on a [[Ship burial|funeral boat]] which eventually washes up along the shores of Ireland. He is discovered by Isolde and her maid, Bragnae, who administer an antidote that revives him. Bragnae insists that Isolde conceal her identity so Isolde tells Tristan ''her'' name is Bragnae and that she is a lady-in-waiting. Tristan and Isolde fall in love as she nurses him back to health. The two lovers must separate after Tristan's boat is discovered. Tristan returns to Cornwall and receives a hero's welcome. A confused but overjoyed Marke welcomes him back with open arms.  Plotting to defeat Britain, Donnchadh proposes a peace treaty, promising his daughter Isolde in marriage to the winner of a tournament. Tristan wins the tournament on behalf of Marke, unaware that "the prize" is the woman he fell in love with in Ireland. When he discovers the truth about Isolde, he is heartbroken to see her betrothed to Marke, but accepts it since the marriage will end ''"a hundred years of bloodshed."''   Marke is kind to Isolde and genuinely falls in love with her and although Isolde grows fond of him, her heart still belongs to Tristan. Isolde tells Tristan that she is his anytime he wants. Tristan is torn between his love for Isolde and his loyalty to Marke. Marke is confused over what is tormenting Tristan and disappointed by the distance he is putting between them.  Tristan eventually gives in to Isolde; they renew their love and begin an affair, which is discovered by Lord Wictred, a longstanding dissenter to Marke's leadership. He informs Donnchadh and they conspire to use their love to overthrow Marke, with Wictred getting Marke's throne in exchange. Marke confides in Tristan that he believes Isolde is having an affair. Tristan is tormented by the guilt and burns down the garden where he would meet Isolde. After Marke and Isolde's coronation, Tristan attempts to end their relationship, but Isolde begs him not to leave her. They are caught in an embrace by Marke, Donnchadh, and the other British kings. Donnchadh pretends to be furious and ends the alliance. Seeing this as weakness on Marke's part, the other kings also decide to part ways with him.   Marke is hurt and furious over his wife and son-figure's betrayal. However, after Isolde explains their history, Marke relents. Tristan is taken to the river and Isolde tells him that Marke is letting them run away together. Tristan puts Isolde in the boat meant for their escape and tells her that if they leave they will be remembered for all time as those ''"whose love brought down a kingdom."'' Tristan pushes the boat away from the shore and runs off to the ensuing battle.  At the same time, Marke's nephew and Tristan's old friend, Melot, resentful of his uncle's long favouring of Tristan, shows Wictred an old passage into the Roman foundations of Marke's castle. Wictred had made Melot believe that he will become king when Marke is defeated. Once they are in the passage, Wictred stabs Melot and sneaks his army into the castle. Marke and his forces swiftly become pinned down by Donnchadh's army outside the castle and Wictred's men within.   Tristan sneaks back into the castle via the secret tunnel, which he used to carry out his affair with Isolde. On the way, he finds the dying Melot; the old friends forgive one another before he dies. Tristan emerges from the tunnel and attacks Wictred's men, allowing Marke's soldiers to secure the castle, but he is mortally wounded in combat by Wictred, whom he still manages to kill. Now outnumbered, Tristan, Marke and the soldiers loyal to him emerge from the castle and present Wictred's severed head to Donnchadh. Marke urges the British kings standing with the Irish to aid them in making Britain a single, free nation. Inspired by his words, the British kings and their men attack Donnchadh and his army.  As a fierce battle between the British and Irish erupts, Marke carries a dying Tristan to the river, where they are met by Isolde. Marke leaves to lead the British to victory, while Tristan dies in Isolde's arms after uttering his last words: "You were right. I don't know if life is greater than death. But love was more than either."  Isolde sees to his burial beneath the ashes of the Roman villa where they had met to be with each other. She plants two [[willow]]s by the grave, which grow intertwined. She then disappears from history and is never seen again. Marke, it is said, defeated the Irish, united Britain, then ruled in peace until the end of his days.

When Ye Guangrong, the nerdy and nervous local party secretary has had enough, he rounds up several other oppressed villagers including Tugua, an account, and Dawang, whose wife was raped by one of the brothers, to clean up the village.  Guangrong and his vigilante's quickly find themselves over their heads. Hiring less than savory characters like "Dog Balls," a [[kung-fu]] obsessed buffoon, Guangrong and his men give themselves officious sounding military titles. As events spiral out of control, a confrontation between the dangerous Xiong Brothers and Guangrong's vigilantes seems inevitable.

The father was supposed to be in New York for a period of time in the past, but returned early before the hit man could kill him.

The mother confronts the partner with a gun and an intense argument rages between the two causing the partner to accidentally shoot and kill the mother.  The FBI run in and shoot the business partner believing that not only did he kill the mother, but the daughter must be dead as well.  The father resigns from his job and apparently plans to leave the country hearing about the deaths of all of his loved ones.  Agent Jennifer Beck still feels that something is not right about this case.  By touching the different objects in custody such as the teddy bear and cell phones, she realizes the father set up the kidnapping after finding out his wife and best friend were planning his murder.  The girl is safe in the care of a nanny that had worked for the parents, but disappeared months earlier, in Chile.  The last scene shows the father meeting with the nanny in an outside Chile restaurant and kissing her. He then turns to watch his daughter walk towards him when an unknown adult blocks the daughter's way and gives her the teddy bear back. The daughter smiles in delight, but the father's face shows his confusion. The unknown adult turns and it is Agent Jennifer Beck.

True North (film)
 The film begins showing a group of farmers from China's [[Fujian]] province speaking to a [[Snakehead (gang)|Snakehead]] (a smuggler of people), telling him the false stories they will use for sympathy in the West.  The ''Providence'', a Scottish [[fishing trawler]] from [[Peterhead]], lands at the docks in [[Oostende]], [[Belgium]] where all of the crew but the Skipper ([[Gary Lewis (actor)|Lewis]]) debark. His son, Seán ([[Martin Compston|Compston]]), the ship's crewman, Riley ([[Peter Mullan|Mullan]]), and the cook ([[Steven Robertson|Robertson]]) then go to an all-night café before splitting up; Seán phones and goes to meet a contact, Riley visits a local [[brothel]] and the cook remains at the café. Seán meets his contact, a local man named Pol ([[Hark Bohm]]), in a dockside warehouse in the hope of being paid to smuggle cigarettes tax-free. Pol has no cigarettes, however, and instead offers Seán a large sum of money to smuggle a group of [[China|Chinese]] [[immigrants]] into the [[United Kingdom]]. Seán reluctantly agrees as he and his father are heavily indebted after failing to catch enough fish to pay the mortgage. Riley returns to find the Chinese aboard the ship, but he and Seán agree not to inform the Skipper or the cook.  The Chinese are kept below deck in poor conditions but one, a 12-year-old girl named Su Li (Angel Li), sneaks off and lives in another part of the boat. She begins to steal food from the kitchen but the slow-witted cook eventually notices that some of his food is missing. Seán insists they can't go home without a good catch as an empty boat would look suspicious and the cargo hold may be searched and the Chinese discovered. The nets come up near empty almost every time, however, and the conditions in the hold are beginning to deteriot rapidly. When one of the Chinese dies, Riley goes to the Skipper and confesses all. The Skipper confronts Seán but soon realises that he was simply doing what was in the ship's, and their, best interests. For the first time, the Skipper is forced to acknowledge that he's only making a loss by staying at sea. Broken, he gives the wheel to Seán, who turns for home.  Meanwhile, the cook discovers Su Li and comforts her, but does not inform anyone else of her presence on board the ship. The Skipper believes that if they return to Scotland, they will face certain arrest; he will lose his license, and the bank will foreclose on the boat. He drowns the Chinese without telling anyone. Seán and Riley then see the nets are full and pull them up. The crew is horrified to find the corpses of the Chinese. The cook attacks the Skipper with a chain and kills him, as he would have no choice but to kill Su Li also.  The film then ends with Riley and Su Li sitting at a bus stop in Peterhead, Scotland. Su Li gets on a coach and it drives away. Inside her bag is the large sum of money from the ship.

Turistas
 Three young American tourists, Alex, his sister Bea, and her friend Amy, are [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] in [[Brazil]]. They decide to go by bus and visit parts of the country instead of flying directly to the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern beaches]] they wish to visit. After a bus crash leaves all the passengers stranded, they are joined by two English men, Finn and Liam, and an Australian woman, Pru, who is fluent in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. The group find a cabana bar where several other tourists and locals are partying. After spending the day on the beach, they are served [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|drugged drinks]] and pass out.  The next morning, they awaken on the deserted beach, robbed of their luggage, money, and documents. Looking for help in the nearby village, they encounter conflict with locals as they see some of their belongings worn or lying around. Offering help, Kiko, a local who speaks some English, volunteers to take them to an isolated house in the forest, where they can wait for a helicopter. En route to the house, Kiko shows the group a cave beneath a waterfall, but, while diving into the water, he sustains a serious head injury. Proceeding to the house, they find food, clothes, and a number of prescription drugs, as well as a drawer filled with other people’s passports. They manage to heal Kiko's wound and reluctantly decide to spend the night.  They are awakened in the middle of the night by a helicopter bringing Zamora, a physician, and several associates and doctors, surrounded by armed henchmen. A woman who arrives advises them to flee, but they are confused and try to fight them, only to be beaten into submission. Zamora proceeds to a makeshift [[Operating Theater|operating room]] where he removes organs from a sedated Amy, while he explains to Finn, who is tied up, that [[organ theft]] for transplant from Brazilians by rich [[gringo]]s is part of a pattern of exploitation of Brazilian "resources", and that it is time to "give back." Victims' usable organs are being harvested and sent to the People’s Hospital in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and used for the benefit of the poor. After her liver and kidneys are removed, Amy dies on the operating table.  Meanwhile, the rest of the group outside manages to break free from cages they have been contained in, and fight and kill one of Zamora’s associates, with the aid of Kiko. While Bea and Pru flee into the jungle, Alex, Kiko and Liam attempt to raid the cabin. They successfully rescue Finn, but he is shot in the head while escaping. Alex flees, while Liam decides to stay behind to fight back, only to be shot and then taken away for his organs to be salvaged. Bea and Pru are separated in the jungle, and Alex and Kiko find Bea the next morning hiding near the river. The three head to the flooded cave, eluding one of Zamora’s associates, armed with a bow and arrows. They enter the cave where they find Pru hiding. Diving and swimming to the cavern's secondary entrance, they find Zamora is also there, and he shoots at them in the water, killing Kiko and injuring Alex.  The survivors are forced to backtrack into the cave. They become split up while stopping in pockets of air to breathe. Bea and the archer meet at the same breathing spot, but Bea wrests an arrow from the man, stabbing him in the neck and killing him. Alex, Bea and Pru escape the cave only to run into Zamora at the exit. Alex attacks Zamora and repeatedly hits him in the head with a rock, but is interrupted by one of Zamora's henchman who is armed with a rifle. Zamora instructs him to kill the foreigners. Seeing the trio of survivors vulnerable and scared, and Zamora in agony, the man hesitates. Pru tries to convince the gunman to spare them, pointing out Zamora's poor treatment of him. Zamora calls the gunman a coward, and is shot in the head by the gunman who turns and walks off. Soon after, the survivors, coming out of the jungle, meet local villagers who take them in.  Later, Alex, Bea, and Pru stand in line, waiting to board an airplane in silence while a couple of tourists behind them argue over going by bus. Alex turns and advises them to take the plane. The male tourist says "thanks man", and they all board the plane.  
Twilight Dancers
 Twilight Dancers offers a disturbing yet a humorous look at the country's social realities through the eyes of three macho dancers or male strippers.  One of them is Dwight ([[Tyron Perez]]), young and at the peak of his trade who loses the girl he loves to a politician's son. Then there's Alfred, who at 28, is past his prime and is kicked out of the club. Finally there's Bert, 30, who has long since given up dancing and is now the bodyguard-driver of a corrupt businesswoman. But Bert's boss, Madame Loca ([[Cherry Pie Picache]]), manipulates the events that push the three dancers to fight for survival, and to finally confront issues of love, friendship and betrayal.  Adding to these conflicts are a deaf-mute wife who refuses to go back to her macho dancer husband, a director who keeps promising stardom to a male dancer named Michael ([[Terence Baylon]]), a transvestite performer who fakes being a virgin as well, a tyrannical mayor who cross-dresses at his birthday party, and a union leader who gets shot by an assassin in broad daylight.  But as their club's manager Taurus always says, "They are only here to serve the carnal desires of men. The show has to go on." ''Twilight Dancers'' is the third movie from director Mel Chionglo about Philippine's macho dancer industry.

The Uchōten Hotel
 The plot involves numerous characters, the different problems or situations they face in the run-up to midnight, and the ways that these different storylines interact and are resolved.  The various storylines include:  * Shindo, who used to work in the theatre, and who tries to hide the fact that he is now a hotel employee when his ex-wife unexpectedly arrives at the hotel. * Shindo's ex-wife's husband, who is in the hotel to receive an award from a [[deer]] fertility research organisation, but is afraid his affair with Yōko will be found out. * Yōko, the call girl who is having an affair with Shindo's ex-wife's husband, and gets involved with Mutōda in the course of the night. * Takemoto, a chambermaid who is mistaken for the mistress of a wealthy elderly man.  The elderly man's son offers her money to leave his father; she tries to ensure that the couple can remain together. * Mutōda, a Senator who is in the hotel hiding from the media, following his involvement in a corruption scandal. He is also the father of Takemoto's son. * Kenji, a bellboy who wants to be a musician, but has decided to give up on his dream. * Zenbu Tokugawa, the veteran [[enka]] star who is suicidal when not performing on-stage.  
The Ugly Swans (film)
 The film's plot is loosely based on the novel, with some superficial differences. The story has been adjusted slightly to contextualize it in the "near future," with the main character Victor Banev recast as a [[UN]] envoy to the town of Tashlinsk, where a mysterious group has taken the town's children to an isolated boarding school. The major departure from the novel's plot is in the ending, in which the "Aquatters" ("Slimeys" from the novel) are all killed by the humans. The children are heroically rescued by Banev, but they are unable to reassimilate into society and are institutionalized.  A small role created for the film was a UN negotiator named [[Gennady Komov]], a reference to a popular character from the Strugatskys' other books.  
TxT (film)
 Joyce (Angel Locsin), a caregiver in a local elderly home, broke up with her obsessive boyfriend, Roman (Oyo Boy Sotto). As a final request, Roman asked Joyce to drive him home with his car. The two had a tragic accident killing Roman and leaving Joyce wounded.   Alex (Dennis Trillo), a call center agent and has feelings for Joyce, comforts her due to Roman's death. Days have passed and Joyce is receiving messages in her cellphone from Roman's number but dismisses it as a cruel prank. Roman's haunting continues by sending Joyce images of her current activities. Roman's haunting becomes more disturbing when Joyce starts receiving messages containing images of her acquaintances dead at exactly 3:29 am.   Aling Kuring (Eugene Domingo), a local eatery owner and one of the people in the sent images, receives a call from Roman. Thinking it as a prank, Kuring answered the phone causing her head to shake violently to death. Lola Lilia (Perla Bautista), Joyce's patient, is under the latter's constant watch after Joyce receives a text from Roman showing Lilia's death. Before 3:29 am, Joyce fell asleep and her phone began to ring, waking up Lilia. Unable to wake Joyce, Lilia answered the call killing her the same way as Kuring died.   Joyce noticed that Roman is killing the people who did not support their relationship. She sought the help of Dante (Dante Rivero), an anting-anting vendor and at the same time a witch doctor. Dante asked Joyce if Roman is doing any occult activities and asked for some of Roman's possessions. Joyce breaks into Roman's room but was caught by Edith (Bing Loyzaga), Roman's mother and also blamed Joyce for the death of her son. Joyce received another message from Roman showing an image of her best friend and next target, Ida (Julia Clarete). Joyce asked Ida to apologize to Roman for not supporting their relationship in an attempt to persuade Roman not to kill her instead, Ida berates Roman in his grave. Later, Joyce was arrested for trespassing and under Edith's request to detain her for the night. Joyce was able to bribe a policeman with a cellphone in order to escape and also asked help to protect Ida on her impending doom. Joyce was able to reach Ida in the latter's home and wait for the police to arrive. As the police is en route to Ida's house, their chief (most likely Roman's manipulation) ordered them to respond to a nearby accident. Joyce, in a panic as the police is diverting away, left Ida alone in her room and to be killed by Roman.  Joyce was able to obtain some of Roman's possessions, his bloodied phone and a piece of paper containing a picture of him with Joyce together surrounded by incantations and symbols, through his mother, Edith. Joyce gave these objects to Dante. It was revealed that before the car accident Roman forced Joyce to perform a blood pact, while driving, by spilling drops of their blood over Roman's phone. The ensuing struggle caused the accident. While Dante further analyzes the other object, Joyce received another message from Roman showing Joyce and Alex in a car accident causing Joyce to flee. Alex followed Joyce and the two had an argument. Joyce, wanting Alex not to be involved, tries to dissuade him but Alex insisted to be with her eventually confessing his feelings for her.  Dante realized that the incantation written on the paper means "shadow" and warns Joyce through a text that Roman's spirit follows her through her shadow. Roman took over Joyce's body and forced her to ride the car with Alex. Roman knocks both of them unconscious and took control of the car. Dante, driving a car, tries to warn Joyce through phone causing him to collide with the car containing Joyce and Alex. Dante's car fell off the cliff and Joyce's car crashed in a nearby post. Joyce, who is conscious, tries to save Dante but it is too late. Dante however managed to write the warning by typing a text message warning Joyce that Roman will take over Alex's body. Alex emerged from the top of the cliff and as the Joyce cries for mercy and the lightning strikes, he appeared closer to the screen revealing Roman successfully possessed him and the screed cuts to black.  
Udugan Yamaya
 Film is based on the experiences of a child caught up in the terror engulfed the country during the time of the JVP uprising.  
Ultraviolet (film)
 ''Ultraviolet'' takes place in 2078, in the years following a global epidemic that causes [[vampire]]-like symptoms, including super-human physical abilities, a healing factor and elongated [[canine teeth|canines]]. The infected "hemophages" die within twelve years after being infected. The "Archministry", a militant medical group headed by Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus, has taken control of the government and begun rounding up infected citizens and exterminating them in order to contain the virus.  Having been infected a decade earlier, Violet Song Jat Shariff has become a member of an underground resistance movement fighting to protect the hemophages from the government. Working with the resistance, Violet steals a weapon that was supposedly designed to exterminate all hemophages, only to discover that it is a young boy named "Six". Rather than kill the child, Violet flees with him, believing that a cure for the disease can be reverse-engineered from the antigens before he dies from them.  She eventually converses with Daxus, who tells her that the boy is his son, but she does  not believe him. Instead she takes him to her friend Garth, who tells her the boy has no antigens and he has no value to anyone. He also tells her that the boy has a tracking device embedded in him ("so hot he's nearly radioactive"), that they can track him easily and he has only 8 hours to live. In the meantime, Nerva reveals to Violet that the antigens in Six's blood are actually deadly to humans. Furthermore, Daxus clarifies that the boy is his clone, his previous claim to her being a ruse to earn her sympathy. Since the hemophages are nearly exterminated, the Archministry intends to engineer a new plague to maintain its power. When he refuses to give her the cure, Violet escapes with Six and lets him spend his last moments at a playground. Daxus arrives, shoots Violet, and takes Six's body for dissection.  Violet is revived in the facility run by Garth, and she realizes that Six might not actually be dead. She storms the Archministry and reaches a laboratory just as Daxus is about to begin the dissection. In the ensuing fight, Daxus reveals that he uses enhancements he gained from an accidental exposure to the hemophage virus to aid in his rise to power. Violet kills Daxus and leaves with Six's body. Six later wakes up, having been immunized by the hemophage virus in Violet's tears. It is theorized that Six might, after all, be instrumental in formulating a cure for the hemophages, although it may be too late for Violet (who is nearing the end of her 12 years).  
The Ultimate Gift
  When his rich grandfather, Howard "Red" Stevens ([[James Garner]]), dies, Jason ([[Drew Fuller]]) does not expect to inherit anything from his multi-billion-dollar estate. He strongly resents his grandfather because his father had died while working for him. There is an inheritance, in fact, but it comes with a condition: Jason must complete 12 separate assignments within a year in order to get it. Each assignment is centered around a "gift". Gifts of work, money, friends and learning are among the dozen that Jason must perform before he is eligible for the mysterious "Ultimate Gift" his grandfather's will has for him. Red's attorney and friend, Mr. Hamilton ([[Bill Cobbs]]), and his secretary, Miss Hastings ([[Lee Meriwether]]), attempt to guide Jason along the path his grandfather wishes him to travel.  On his return after completing the first task, everything he values is suddenly taken away from him – luxury apartment, his restored muscle car, and all his money – and he is left homeless. His trendy girlfriend, Caitlin ([[Mircea Monroe]]), ditches him when his credit card is rejected at a fancy restaurant. After his mother (Donna Cherry) tells him she cannot help him, as part of the agreement, he miserably wanders the city alone. While sleeping in a park, he encounters a woman, Alexia ([[Ali Hillis]]), and her outspoken daughter, Emily ([[Abigail Breslin]]). Jason befriends the two, and then asks them to go to the attorney's office and confirm themselves as his "true friends" in order to pass his assignment, but afterwards Jason walks away and ignores Emily's request to see him again. However, Jason accidentally discovers that Emily is suffering from leukemia, and sees a chance to develop a strong bond with someone.  From that point, he tries his best to help Emily have a great life while it lasts, and Emily encourages a romance between Jason and her mother. Another of his tasks requires him to travel to Ecuador and study in a library his father and grandfather built to help the people there. This brings him to address his resentment over the death of his father there, and he makes a trip into the mountains with a local guide to see where it happened. Jason learns from his guide that the story he had always believed about his father's death was a lie, fabricated by his grandfather out of guilt and shame for trying to push Jason's father into the oil business. Jason and the guide are captured there and taken hostage by [[Insurgency|militants]] for several weeks, until Jason manages to ensure their escape. He returns to America and discovers that Emily's condition has deteriorated, so he arranges for Gus the ranch-hand to host a belated Christmas celebration at his home for them.  Upon completing his twelve tasks, Jason is given a sum of $100-million to do with whatever he pleases, and all of his property is returned to him. His former girlfriend, knowing that he has regained his wealth, makes an attempt to win him back but he declines her offer. With his inheritance, Jason chooses to build a hospital, called Emily's Home, for patients with terminal illnesses, but before the building begins, Emily dies. After the groundbreaking for Emily's Home, Jason is recalled to the law firm for one more meeting and told he has exceeded the expectations of his dead grandfather, and he is given the final gift of $2-billion dollars, rewarding Jason not only for his completing the tasks, but for using the $100-million to help others. That night, Jason is seen sitting on a bench in the park, when Alexia joins him. He thanks her for the help that she and her daughter gave him. Then they kiss, as a butterfly, representing Emily, flies around them.

In the company of Khurshid ([[Ayesha Jhulka]]), Bismillah ([[Divya Dutta]]), and one of the courtesan's sons, Gauhar Mirza ([[Puru Raajkumar]]), Amiran learns the art of being a courtesan, or ''[[tawaif]]''.  The girl turns into an elegant, poetic beauty by the name of Umrao Jaan ([[Aishwarya Rai]]). Umrao's beauty and poetry is enough to catch the eye of Nawab Sultan ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]). The two begin a passionate romance but, when his father hears of their relationship, he disowns Nawab Sultan from his life, wealth and property. The penniless Nawab goes to stay in the house of his uncle, who is a judge in Ghari, to sort himself out; Umrao is left desolate without him and prays every day for his return.  In the Nawab's absence, Umrao catches the eye of Faiz Ali ([[Sunil Shetty]]). Though she rejects his romantic advances, he determinedly pursues her and eventually asks her to accompany him to his home in Daulatabad. Umrao accepts, but only after she learns that they will be travelling through Ghari. Along the way, the whole party is arrested after a confrontation between Faiz Ali's men and a group of state soldiers. Faiz Ali is revealed to be a dacoit whom the soldiers have pursued for years. Nawab Sultan hears that Umrao and Faiz Ali are in Ghari and goes to meet Faiz Ali in prison. Faiz Ali, who then realises that Umrao only accompanied him so that she could meet Nawab, manipulates the information concerning his time with Umrao and implies to the Nawab that they had a sexual relationship. The Nawab confronts Umrao and, feeling that she betrayed him, shuns her and sends her back to Lucknow. Heartbroken, Umrao returns to her old life, but fate has other plans for her.  In a drunken state, her childhood friend Gauhar Mirza ([[Puru Raajkumar]]), who has always been in love with her, becomes frustrated at her for rejecting his advances and rapes her. Soon after, the British attack the city and she is forced to leave Lucknow. She and the refugees separate after she decides to go to Faizabad, her childhood home. There, she learns that her father is long dead. She meets her mother and brother, but they refuse to accept her because of her profession. Umrao, rejected by her family and her lover, leaves to return to Lucknow. Then, fate plays another joke on her: On her way out of the city, she encounters Dilawar Khan, the man who kidnapped her and sold her to the brothel when she was a child. Poor, wretched, homeless and injured, the man begs her for money, not recognising who she is; she gives him her gold bangles and prays to God for his forgiveness. Ostracized by all and having forgiven those who destroyed her life, Umrao lives out the rest of her days in Lucknow with her poetry and ill fate.

Unaccompanied Minors
 Spencer Davenport and his sister Katherine must fly from [[California]] to [[Pennsylvania]] on Christmas Eve to spend the holidays with their dad, an environmentalist. Unfortunately, during their layover at the Hoover International Airport in [[Chicago]], a massive blizzard grounds all planes and cancels all flights, and the siblings are sent to the anarchic UM ([[Unaccompanied minor (passenger)|Unaccompanied Minors']]) room, where they meet Christmas-spirited smarty-pants Charlie Goldfinch, surly tomboy Donna Malone, arrogant rich girl Grace Conrad, and mysterious Beef Wellington.  Charlie, Spencer, Beef, Grace, and Donna sneak out, and proceed to enjoy themselves around the airport. When they are caught by the airport security guards and returned to the UM room, they find that the other minors, Katherine included, have been sent to a lodge down the road, and that the grouchy head of passenger relations, Oliver Porter — whose trip to Hawaii is among the canceled flights — intends for the kids to spend Christmas Eve in the UM room. Knowing that it will break Katherine's faith in [[Santa Claus]] if she does not receive a present by the next morning, Spencer asks the others to help him get a present for his sister in return for a plan to escape.  With Spencer's plan, the minors give Zach Van Bourke, the friendly clerk watching them, the slip, but Mr. Porter grows desperate to get the kids back, and sends all the airport guards to find them. After Donna and Grace get into a fight, Spencer decides that they're going to have to put their differences aside and work together, and Beef leaves to go and get a Christmas tree. Along the way, he reflects on how his step-father, Ernie, hoped to make him stronger by saying men are made, not born. Meanwhile, Spencer and Katherine's father tries to drive to the airport in his [[biodiesel]] fueled car, but it eventually breaks down at a gas station. Fortunately, the owner lets him borrow a [[Hummer]].  The minors head to a thinly secured exit in the back of the airport, letting a dog loose to distract the guards. While they hide from Mr. Porter in the baggage claim, Charlie, who is hiding in a suitcase, gets placed on a conveyor transport; Donna goes after him, putting herself on a wild ride. Spencer and Grace follow them to the unclaimed baggage warehouse, where they find many wonderful presents, including a set of walkie-talkies, and a doll for Katherine.  However, they are seen dancing to [[Lee Morgan]]'s performance of [[The Sidewinder]] on security cameras, and Mr. Porter and the guards chase the minors through the warehouse. Using a canoe, the minors take Zach captive and sled to the lodge while pursued by the guards, and manage to elude Mr. Porter long enough to find Katherine asleep in the lobby, and place the doll in her arms. While running around the lodge, Grace has to remove her contact lenses and put on glasses, which made her look like a dork in the past (but not to Spencer). With their mission completed, the minors go back to the airport with Mr. Porter quietly. They are placed under surveillance in separate rooms.  Using the walkie-talkies, the minors tamper with the security cameras and escape through air ducts. They find the Christmas decorations Mr. Porter confiscated, and Beef returns with a huge Christmas tree that he traded his prized Aquaman action figure for. With Zach's help, the minors decorate the airport, and take items from the unclaimed baggage warehouse to use as presents for the rest of the stranded passengers. Mr. Porter finds Spencer to admit defeat and reveals that he's unhappy because he never really gets to spend time with his family during Christmas. Spencer inspires some holiday spirit in the man with some friendly words and the gift of a [[snow globe]]. On Christmas morning, Mr. Porter dresses up as Santa Claus to hand out presents to the passengers, Spencer reunites with Katherine, their father arrives to pick them up, Beef tells a girl about his trek to find a Christmas tree, Charlie and Donna exchange phone numbers and share a kiss, and Grace accepts Spencer's invitation to spend Christmas with him and his family.

Underworld: Evolution
 In 1202, an army led by the three vampire [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] ([[Markus Corvinus|Markus]], [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]], and [[Amelia (Underworld)|Amelia]]) arrives at a [[Lycanthropy|Lycan]]-ravaged village. Viktor and Amelia capture their target, Markus's twin brother, [[William Corvinus]], the first and most powerful werewolf. Despite Markus's defiance, Viktor orders that William be imprisoned in a secret location forever.  In the present day, vampire [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] takes [[Michael Corvin|Michael]] to a safe house so that she can confront the vampire [[regent]] [[Kraven (Underworld)|Kraven]]; she knows that Kraven intends to kill Markus and plans to stop him. However, Markus has awakened before Kraven arrives. Markus kills Kraven and his men. Lorenz Macaro, an elderly man, sends in a team of "cleaners" to investigate the aftermath from the battle in the Lycans' lair. When Macaro examines Viktor's corpse he finds a metal disc inside which is the match to a pendant originally worn by [[Sonja (Underworld)|Sonja]]. The other half of the pendant is now possessed by Michael after the death of Lucian.  Markus tracks Selene and Michael down and attacks them, but they evade him and hide in a warehouse. There, Selene and Michael share their feelings and have passionate sex. Now knowing that the pendant is important to Markus, Michael and Selene set out to discover why Markus wants it. Selene recalls that she saw it as a child, but does not know its significance. They travel to the hideout of the exiled vampire historian Andreas Tanis.  Tanis reveals that Markus was the first vampire, one of the three sons of [[Alexander Corvinus]], the first immortal. Markus was bitten by a bat and became a vampire, while William was bitten by a wolf and became a werewolf. The third son remained human and gave rise to a line of mortal descendants including Michael, who became the first Lycan&ndash;Vampire [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]. The first werewolves created by William were entirely animal and unable to return to human form. Due to William's destructiveness, Markus approached Viktor, then a dying mortal warlord, and offered to turn him and his army into immortal vampires in exchange for tracking down and stopping William, and in destroying those he had infected. Viktor did not kill the brothers because he was led by Markus to believe that doing so would result in the immediate extinction of all other vampires and his Lycan slaves. Tanis further reveals that Selene's father was the architect who built William's prison and that the pendant is the key. Viktor killed Selene's family because they knew the prison's location, but turned Selene into a vampire with the location of the prison encoded in her blood. Tanis then refers Selene and Michael to Macaro for help. After Selene and Michael leave, Markus arrives and drinks Tanis' blood to learn Selene and Michael's location, killing Tanis.  Visiting Macaro, Selene and Michael discover he actually is Alexander Corvinus. Alexander reveals that he has devoted his entire immortal life to keeping the Vampire-Lycan war a secret. However, he refuses to assist Selene in killing his sons. Then Markus arrives, beats Michael and impales him. He learns the location of William's prison by drinking Selene's blood. He mortally wounds his father and obtains the other half of the pendant. He mocks his father's refusal to help William, revealing that he intends, with William, to rule the world as god-like master of a race of vampire-Lycan hybrids. On Alexander's bidding, Selene drinks his blood, enhancing her physical strength and healing abilities to a level equivalent to that of a hybrid. Afterwards, Alexander blows up his ship, killing himself.  Selene, aboard Alexander's helicopter, leads his cleaners to the prison to confront and destroy Markus, but he has already freed William. In the ensuing battle, William bites the cleaners who thus turn into werewolves. Michael, presumed dead and carried aboard the helicopter, awakens and joins the fight in his hybrid form, killing William by ripping his head off. Selene engages Markus in hand-to-hand combat, killing him by kicking him into the rotor blades of the cleaners' crashed helicopter.  After the battle, Selene realizes that Alexander's blood granted her hybrid abilities, including being immune to the effects of sunlight, which is lethal to vampires.

On United 93, a hesitant Jarrah appears to have second thoughts of initiating the hijacking plan. Impatient, the other three hijackers prepare for invasion themselves. al-Haznawi assembles a fake bomb out of clay and plastic during breakfast, then al-Ghamdi makes the first move and grabs hold of flight purser Debbie Welsh at knifepoint. After a passenger is fatally stabbed and the "bomb" is revealed, causing mass panic among passengers, al-Nami and al-Haznawi force the first-class passengers to the back of the plane.

After passengers arm themselves, pray, and make final phone calls to loved ones, [[Todd Beamer]] says "[[Let's roll#Flight 93|Let's Roll!]]" The group begin their counterattack, rushing down the aisle and overpowering Ahmed al-Haznawi; Mark Bingham crushes al-Haznawi's skull with a fire extinguisher, killing him. Seeing this, al-Nami alerts Jarrah and al-Ghamdi in the cockpit of the ongoing assault. Jarrah shakes the plane violently to throw the passengers off balance, but they continue their assault, overpowering al-Nami who is killed by Jeremy Glick snapping his neck. Seeing the passengers getting nearer, al-Ghamdi and Jarrah debate whether to take the flight down, realizing that their plan to reach their intended target will not succeed. The passengers then breach the cockpit with the food cart, and al-Ghamdi orders Jarrah to crash the plane. The passengers finally gain entrance into the cockpit and attack the two hijackers over the controls. As the passengers and hijackers struggle for control of the yoke, the plane violently turns upside down and nosedives toward an empty field before the screen cuts to black. Title cards explain that the plane crashed into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]], [[Pennsylvania]], killing everyone on board and preventing the terrorists from reaching their intended target.

Undisputed II: Last Man Standing
 Some years after fighting Monroe "Undisputed" Hutchens in prison, former boxing champion George "Iceman" Chambers visits the Russian Federation for a series of boxing matches, where he is subsequently framed for [[Possession of drug paraphernalia|possession]] of [[cocaine]] and once again sent to prison. There, he discovers a series of [[Illegal sports|illegal]] [[mixed martial arts]] matches dominated by inmate Yuri Boyka. The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters. Chambers shares a cell with Steven Parker, a British junkie.  [[Russian mob|Mob boss]] Gaga and Warden Markov tell Chambers that if he fights Boyka, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release. Chambers initially refuses, but after spending time in demeaning physical labor in the prison's sewer system and experiencing firsthand the brutality of the guards, he reluctantly agrees. He is rescued from both forms of humiliation by an inmate named Crot, who uses a wheelchair. Both fighters train hard for the match, though Chambers still relies on his boxing background while Boyka prepares a series of deadly kicks, throws, and grappling combinations designed to humiliate his opponent in the ring. Prior to the fight however, Boyka's gang force Steven, who is acting as Chambers' cornerman, to spike his water with a light sedative during the fight.  During the fight, Chambers is somewhat taken by surprise at the flurry and variety of Boyka's attacks, but manages to hold his own through the first round by keeping his distance, staying calm, and dealing out painful punching combinations whenever possible. At the end of the first round, Chambers takes a few sips of the spiked water, causing him to lose on the second round when he loses consciousness and falls to Boyka's [[flying kick]]. Following the match, Steven hangs himself out of guilt. Later, Chambers confronts Boyka over the sedative incident; after Boyka learns that his gang spiked Chambers' water behind his back, Chambers demands a rematch to ensure his release. Chambers receives training in mixed martial arts from Crot, who was a [[Soviet Armed Forces|former soldier]] and the one who trained Boyka in his [[Sambo (martial art)|fighting style]].  Once the rematch begins, it is apparent to all the viewers that the combatants are evenly matched and Chambers is more impressive in his style. The fight is long and intense, with flurries of combinations, grapples, and throws traded between the two. Eventually, Chambers realizes that Boyka will not lose consciousness, will not submit, and will likely knock him out if the fight goes on too long. Chambers alters his strategy and manages to get Boyka in a [[joint lock]] and ends the fight by breaking Boyka's leg, proving that he is the undisputed new champion of the prison. Shortly thereafter, Chambers is released from prison and uses his winnings to buy Crot's freedom as well.

Unknown (2006 film)
 In a warehouse, a handful of men regain consciousness; they have no idea who they are or what happened to them. One is tied to a chair ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), another has been handcuffed and shot ([[Jeremy Sisto]]), a third has a broken nose ([[Greg Kinnear]]), and the other two are also wounded ([[Jim Caviezel]] and [[Barry Pepper]]). Caviezel's character wakes up first. He makes sure everyone is alive, then discovers that the windows are barred and the only door has a mechanized lock. He finds a ringing phone and picks it up. The caller asks what is going on and Caviezel tells the caller that everyone is fine. The Caller tells him he will return in a few hours. Somewhere else, a money drop off is occurring. Mr. Coles has been kidnapped.  In the warehouse, Pantoliano's character asks to be untied. As Caviezel prepares to untie him, Pepper's character convinces him not to, telling Caviezel that Pantoliano is not on the same side, or he would not have been tied up. As Caviezel and Pepper look for the keys to release Sisto from the handcuffs and treat his wound, Kinnear wakes up and fights with Caviezel and Pepper. At the drop off, the signal in the money bag goes silent; the cops enter to find the money gone.  In the warehouse, the men find a newspaper featuring a story about the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman named Coles. The men suspect that they were involved with the kidnapping, but do not know what their involvement was. They begin to experience flashbacks.  A gun is recovered, and Caviezel wins possession of it. Various attempts to free themselves, including trying to attract attention through a hole in the wall, and shooting out a window, fail. The men decide to work together to fight off the criminals who are coming, so all of them can go their separate ways.  Sisto's character recalls a harrowing incident from his childhood when he was comforted by his friend. He claims Caviezel is his friend, but Caviezel cannot verify this. Sisto's character dies from his wounds.  The police piece together who they believe the kidnappers are. They show photos of the suspects to Coles' wife ([[Bridget Moynahan]]). Sisto, Pantoliano and Caviezel are among the photos.  At the warehouse, the gang returns from the money pickup. Pantoliano remembers he is part of the gang and tries warning them of the trap. In the confusion, he is shot along with one of the gang members. After Pepper is pushed out at gunpoint, the others surrender. Caviezel recalls that he is part of the gang, but cannot accept that he is a criminal. He is greeted by the gang leader and chastised for letting things go so wrong in the warehouse. A fight broke out between kidnappers and victims. Chemicals spilled during the fight rendered everyone unconscious and induced temporary amnesia.

Unrest (2006 film)
 The film revolves around a [[cadaver]] who seems to bring misfortune on those who come in contact with it.  Although there is very little corporeal manifestation of the [[ghost]]s, people seem to die when they enrage the spirit which is linked with a special cadaver&mdash;by disrespecting it or otherwise. The story takes place mostly inside a hospital, where a young medical student, Alison Blanchard, comes to learn anatomy. By observing the cadaver she was assigned, she discovers that the body had self-inflicted wounds and also had a child. She soon discovers that there is something wrong with the cadaver, which they have nicknamed "Norma." Mysterious deaths occur in the hospital, which include the fiancee of one of Allison's team members and several hospital employees.  It is revealed that the cadaver is a person named Alita Covas, who once led an archaeological expedition on an [[Aztec]] [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrificial site]]. There she uncovered 50,000 bodies which were offered to [[Tlazolteotl]], the Aztec god of fertility and prostitution. Afterwards, she herself became a prostitute, and started showing symptoms of mental imbalance. Later in her life, she committed murders and was subsequently put in a mental asylum where she died&mdash;presumably by her own hand.  Once Alison learns of the true nature of the cadaver, she decides the corpse must return to Brazil to satisfy the Aztec god. After a series of gruesome events, Alison and her classmate/love interest take Alita's now dismembered corpse and [[cremate]] her in the hospital. In the end, Alison heads to [[Brazil]] to spread the ashes in an attempt to put the spirit at rest; however, it is suggested in the final scene that the spirit remains in the hospital.

Varalaru
 Shivashankar ([[Ajith Kumar]]), a wheelchair-bound multi-millionaire, has a son, Vishnu (also Ajith Kumar) who is playful and irresponsible. To teach him a lesson, he sends Vishnu to Thottapuram to help the poor. Vishnu does not want to go, but a local pizza restaurateur convinces Vishnu and his friends that the village is one big brothel. In reality, Thottapuram is a sacred village and the restaurateur had purposefully deceived Vishnu and his friends. Also visiting the village are Divya ([[Asin]]) and her college classmates. They come for their social activity course to improve the village's health and hygiene. A large building is reserved for him and the girls are asked to stay in the poor families' houses. Vishnu and his friends arrive and start to woo the girls, whom they mistake for Thottapuram's prostitutes. When Divya discovers their plan, she and her friends decide to teach Vishnu and his friends a lesson.  Vishnu and his friends are wooed by Divya and the other girls. They are led to separate rooms where the girls inject a serum that makes them itch all over. They leave, screaming and scratching. Vishnu tells Divya to leave her profession and offers to save her honour by marrying her in the village temple the next day. Divya doesn't come, but Vishnu and his friends happen to see her leaving on a bus bearing the name of the girls' college, revealing that they have been duped. But, Divya got guilt ridden when she watches him carrying  [[mangala sutra]] and really got ready to marry her. Depressed and felt cheated, Vishnu returns home, Shivshankar discovers that his son has fallen in love. With his influence, Vishnu and Divya get engaged. Everything goes well until one night, Vishnu goes to Divya's house in a drunken state. Her family prevent him from talking to her. This eventually leads to a fight. Vishnu then goes to Divya's cousin's house to meet Divya and apologise for his behaviour, but suddenly attempts to rape Divya's cousin which Divya got horrified when noticing. Then on the same day at night, Vishnu tries to kill Shivashankar, but is stopped by Ko Thandam ([[Pandu (actor)|Pandu]]), Sivashankar's P.A., who got stabbed by Vishnu. Disappointed with Vishnu's behaviour, Shivashankar sends Vishnu to a psychiatrist .  It is then revealed that Jeeva (Ajith Kumar's third role), Vishnu's twin, had assumed Vishnu's identity, took money from the bank, got drunk and went to Divya's place and attempted to rape Divya's cousin. Jeeva hates Shivashankar for abandoning him and his mentally-challenged mother Gayathri ([[Kanika (actress)|Kanika]]). Later, Divya manages to sneak into Vishnu's room in the hospital and believes his explanation that he is innocent. She leaves and shortly afterwards, Jeeva appears, smuggles and dumps Vishnu out of the hospital, takes over his identity and goes to kill Shivashankar. The father notices that it's not his son and gets out of his wheelchair to defend himself much to Jeeva's surprise. Vishnu arrives at the scene, surprised that his father is able to walk and demands an explanation.  Shivashankar tells him that he was a [[Bharathanatiyam]] dancer who behaved effeminately due to dancing. His mother had arranged for Shivashankar to marry her friend's daughter (Jeeva's mother). He agreed but the girl rejected Shivashankar for being too effeminate and insulted him in front of the wedding crowd. Unable to bear the embarrassment, Shivashankar's mother died on the spot. Enraged, Shivashankar raped the girl, leaving her pregnant. The doctor refused to give her an abortion and so Vishnu was born. Shivashankar took his child from her mother saying the child would be the only hope of his life. Shivashankar says he is ignorant of Jeeva's existence and the reason for his resemblance to them.  Jeeva escapes and threatens Vishnu and Divya's wedding. Shivashankar attempts to stop him when Jeeva's grandmother arrives and explains that Jeeva is also Shivashankar's son and Vishnu's twin and that Jeeva's mother went insane when Jeeva was about to get hit by a lorry. Jeeva realises his mistake. He wants Shivashankar to shoot him, but the police misunderstand and think that Jeeva is pointing a gun at Shivashankar. They fire at Jeeva, but Shivashankar intervenes and is shot instead and killed. Jeeva accepts Shivashankar's apology and is then arrested. After a few weeks, Jeeva's mother does not accept food from anyone, until Vishnu comes dressed up as Jeeva and feeds her. The film ends with Vishnu stating that Shivashankar is the [[godparent|godfather]] of the family.  
Valley of the Wolves: Iraq
 The film opens with a fictional depiction of a real-life incident, the "[[Hood event]]". On July 4, 2003, the Turkish soldiers believe they are having an ordinary visit from their [[NATO]] allies, but a sudden change occurs, and 11 allied Turkish [[special forces]] soldiers and 13 civilians are arrested by Colonel Sam William Marshall ([[Billy Zane]]), in the northern Iraq town of [[Sulaymaniyah]]. They are forced to wear hoods while in detention, and are released some time later.  A Turkish officer named Suleyman Aslan, who was a member of the special forces troops involved in the Hood event, is unable to bear the shame of what happened, and commits suicide. Before doing so, he writes a letter saying goodbye to his friend, Polat Alemdar ([[Necati Şaşmaz]]). Alemdar is a former Turkish intelligence agent who has recently severed links to the government agency for which he worked. Determined to avenge his friend's humiliation, Alemdar travels to [[Iraq]] along with several of his colleagues, seeking vengeance on the American commander whose actions led to Aslan's suicide.  At a checkpoint, Alemdar and his team kill three Iraqi Kurdish paramilitary troops called "[[Peshmerga|Peshmerge]]". They attach explosives to the foundation of a hotel, to which they demand Colonel Sam William Marshall, who was responsible for the hooding incident, come. When Marshall arrives, Polat wants him to put a sack over his head and to publicly leave the hotel with him, allowing journalists to take photos, taking the same insult he committed to Polat's dead friend. The group threatens to blow up the hotel unless Marshall and some of his men let themselves be led out of the hotel while hooded. Marshall refuses and brings in a group of Iraqi children as [[human shield]]s. Alemdar gives in and leaves.  Marshall raids an Arab wedding on the pretext of hunting [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|"terrorists"]]. When the usual celebratory gunfire starts, one soldier states: "Now they are shooting, now they are terrorists"; they attack a wedding party, where a small child named Ali sticks a branch up the barrel of one of the soldiers' guns. At first, the soldier just hushes the boy away; the second time, he opens fire and afterwards looks astonished as he sees the little child dead. The rest of the soldiers panic and open fire on the wedding guests, beat up the bride, shoot the groom, the guests and children. The survivors are captured and forced into an airtight container truck and sent to [[Abu Ghraib]] prison.  En route to Abu Ghraib, an American soldier complains that the prisoners might be suffocating in the truck. One of Marshall's men then fires on the truck, spraying the detainees with bullets. "See, now they won't suffocate to death", he says. When the soldier threatens to report the incident, he is promptly shot. In Abu Ghraib, a group of American soldiers, among them the sole female Westerner in the film (a clear reference to [[Lynndie England]] and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib torture scandal]]), is making naked human pyramids from those arrested in the wedding, aided by an Arab interpreter. The prisoners are washed with high pressure nozzles in what appears to be cattle stalls.  In a later scene, the [[Daniel Pearl|execution of a Western journalist]] by Iraqi rebels is about to take place, but the [[sheikh]] Abdurrahman Halis Karkuki, who is esteemed by the rebels, prevents it, and offers the journalist the opportunity to kill the rebel who was about to kill him. The rebel does not resist, but the journalist declines the offer. Thereafter, the bride who survived the earlier massacre, Leyla, wants revenge by becoming a [[suicide bombing|suicide bomber]], but is talked out of it by the Sheikh. Leyla hurries to a market to stop her brother-in-law Abu Ali, the father of the child killed at the wedding, from blowing himself up in the place where Col. Marshall is having a meeting, but she arrives too late. Alemdar and his men, who are there to assassinate Marshall, are led to safety by Leyla.  Alemdar and his team then attempt to kill Marshall again by rigging a bomb in a piano (which once belonged to [[Saddam Hussein]]) that is being delivered to Marshall as a gift. The bomb explodes prematurely, and Marshall survives. Alemdar and Leyla then go to a mosque, to meet the sheikh. Marshall tracks them down, however, and a big firefight ensues. The entire village and mosque are destroyed by heavy gunfire. Together they manage to kill Marshall, but Leyla is also killed by Marshall.

Vanaja (film)
 [[File:Vanaja learns a Kuchipudi dance jati from Rama Devi.jpg|thumb|Vanaja dances a Kuchipudi [[Jati (music)|Jati]] (short sequence set to a staccatto beat) from Rama Devi.]] Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) is the 15-year-old daughter of Somayya (Ramachandriah Marikanti), a poor, low caste fisherman from rural [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Somayya struggles to support his family due to dwindling catches at sea and mounting debts. One day, Vanaja and her teenage friend Lacchi (Bhavani Renukunta) watch a theatrical performance by a former [[Kuchipudi]] (a native [[classical Indian dance]] form) great, Rama Devi (Urmila Dammannagari). The sequence of events lead to a [[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]] predicting to Vanaja that she will be a great dancer. With permission from her father, she goes to work in the house of the local landlady Rama Devi with the hope of learning [[Kuchipudi]]. While she is employed as a farmhand, she is entrusted with tending the chickens. When she gets caught playfully chasing them, she lies to conceal her pranks. Her vivaciousness and spunk soon catch the landlady’s eye. To keep her out of trouble, Rama Devi soon promotes her to a kitchen underhand where she meets Rama Devi’s cook, the old, crusty and extremely loyal Radhamma (Krishnamma Gundimalla).  After settling down at the landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited to play a game of [[ashta chamma (board game)|ashta chamma]] (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady. Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she deliberately gives up her game. This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government. Sexual chemistry is ignited between Shekhar and Vanaja (still a minor at 15) when flirtation and sexual innuendo bloom.  In the meanwhile, her father's fishing boat is taken away by creditors. He sinks into a state of sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s superior intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a [[Caste system in India|lower caste]]. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will grow up to be an upper caste boy.

However, when Taj arrives at Camford, he is told by Pip Everett, the [[Earl Grey|Earl of Grey]] ([[Daniel Percival]]), the arrogant leader of the Fox and Hounds, that there had been a mistake and he has actually not been accepted into the Fraternal Guild.  Heartbroken, Taj, with his faithful bulldog Ballzac in tow, instead takes the only housing opening available on campus and becomes the "Head of House" for a group of student misfits — Sadie ([[Holly Davidson]]), a gorgeous but foul-mouthed [[Cockney]] girl, Seamus ([[Glen Barry]]), an [[English people|English]]-hating [[Irish people|Irishman]], Gethin ([[Anthony Cozens]]), a [[nerd]], and Simon (Steven Rathman), a kid who rarely talks.  Stuck with a band of misfits, Taj considers what Van Wilder would do in the same unpleasant situation, and in classic "Van" fashion he decides to take on the challenge and turn the house around. At the campus Society Inaugural Ball, Taj announces to the pompous crowd that he and his new friends are starting their own exclusive society — the Cock and Bulls. In addition, the Cock and Bulls declare that they are going to compete in the venerable Hastings Cup, an ongoing series of campus academic events and athletic competitions.

Meanwhile, much to the fury of Pip Everett, not only are the Cock and Bulls catching up to the Fox and Hounds in the Hastings Cup, but Taj and Charlotte are spending a lot of time together.  Pip sets out to get rid of Taj by attempting to humiliate him at the Royal Literary Ball and then sabotaging Ballzac at the Camford Dog Show, but both cases backfire and Pip ends up the one embarrassed. Much to Pip's dismay, Taj and Charlotte are clearly falling in love and the Cock and Bulls are moving into a close second behind the Fox and Hounds.  Pip decides to set up Taj and the Cock and Bulls by planting stolen test exams in their house. The plan works temporarily, and they are about to get expelled until Taj steps up and takes the blame for the theft — on the condition that his team are allowed to stay in school. The school Provost agrees to the terms, and Taj has to leave Camford. Angst-ridden, Charlotte tells Taj she never wants to see him again.  The Cock and Bulls are now left to compete in the final event of the Hastings Cup without their courageous leader. But when Charlotte finds evidence that proves Taj's innocence, she and Taj rush to the Hastings Cup, just in time for Taj to compete against Pip in the final event — [[fencing]].  An angry and vengeful Pip makes sure that the fencing match degenerates into an all-out sword fight, but in the end, Taj defeats Pip and the Cock and Bulls win the Hastings Cup. Pip gets expelled for planting the exams while Taj and Charlotte happily begin a new life together.

The two set off for another monastery Jalan has heard of during his stay at the former one, where the Yogi prepares the [[Elixir of life]] for immortality by extracting the breath out of his pupils. Ushna is a bit reluctant and wishes to spend their lives in their natural spans together at the Valley of Flowers, where nobody could separate them. They however manage to steal the Elixir and consume it, preserving some for "days to come". The unfortunate lovers are confronted by Yeti early next morning direct from their sleep and Jalan in his pride of them attaining immortality shoots Ushna to make a display of it and Ushna in spite of having taken the Elixir is killed. Jalan is rebuked by Yeti for having tampered with things they ought not have. Now bereaved from his soulmate, Jalan is doomed to a vain life of immortality.  Then follows a transition of two centuries into the modern times in Tokyo. The shifting of landscapes and ages is depicted by the famous Time-Walk scene as Jalan's feet are shown to traverse diverse landscapes from rocky wildernesses to blooming pastures to war ridden lands strewn with havoc to modern [[Metalled road#Metalling|metalled roads]], accompanied by sounds describing the various ages in time.  In Japan, Jalan goes by the identity Jalan Otsal, the controversial Indian doctor who is a legalized practitioner of [[euthanasia]] and owner of the firm Valley of Flowers Corporation. He is despised by the people of the city and is stalked everywhere by protesters demanding him to leave Japan and leave death to Nature. Jalan creates news again by jumping from the 62-storey and yet surviving without even a scar, which is telecast live in the local news channels. Sayuri ([[Eri (Japanese Model)|Eri]]), the reincarnation of Ushna in this age, who is a singer at a [[pub]] is stopped during a performance by this telecast going on in the pub's television and she immediately rushes to the Police Station to rescue Jalan. They board a [[subway train]] where she tells Jalan that she has been serving her [[Karma]] ever since, this is her fifth reincarnation and that she has remembered him in each one of them, right from her birth, with the pain of separation and her aeonian longing living on with her soul and finally now she can't stand it anymore. Jalan and Sayuri unite in the empty train and rush to a temple where he gives her the Elixir he had preserved earlier. In the morning they wake up to find Yeti who reminds them of the Laws of [[Karma]] and [[Impermanence]] and of the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], "the one who can turn conflict into collaboration" and gives Jalan the symbolic White Flower. Sayuri starts to flee taking Jalan with her but they are hit by a flower delivery truck. This time Jalan is killed and his body is shown lying amid the flowers fallen from the truck. Sayuri rushes to Yeti in anguish and demands to know why he did this when he had promised her more time with Jalan. Yeti consoles her saying that true love lies in sacrifice. He says that he is just carrying out his duty to restore the balance. Sayuri breaks down at his feet and slowly dissolves in a sea of fumes. Yeti performs the symbolic [[Chöd]] rituals of parting by playing the [[Damaru]] and blowing the [[Kangling]]. He then retrieves the Demon mask which Jalan had found earlier in the movie when Ushna had appeared, from where Sayuri dissolved into fumes.  The movie closes with Yeti fixing the mask upon a stone statuette which is revealed to be its detached face. He wipes off tears from its eyes and walks away as the sea waves lash upon the shore where the two similar statuettes stand on either side of a [[Torii]] at the entrance of a cave.  The film has a lot unsaid, unexplained, left to the speculation of the viewers which triggers a lot of research and study into the various cultural, mythological and religious elements incorporated in the film. This mystery element in itself is the flavor of Pan Nalin movies along with the remarkable influences from [[Buddhism]] and [[Buddhist Philosophy]]. Breathtaking landscapes of the [[Ladakh]] plateau, which is another characteristic, adds further to the mood.

Maurice's friend describes the grand-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London to view his favourite painting, the ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'', by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]].  Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mishears this as "yodelling") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname "Venus". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have.  The plot comes to a head when Jessie becomes involved with a boy. The two young lovers persuade Maurice to take a walk so that they can have sex. Maurice initially obliges, but returns to kick them out of his flat. A scuffle ensues and the boy knocks down Maurice, injuring him. Jessie leaves with the boy but she later returns to check on Maurice. When the paramedics arrive, Maurice claims he cannot remember who attacked him, much to Jessie's surprise. Then Maurice calls for "Venus" to take care of him. Jessie, remorseful, agrees to look after Maurice. Some time later, after Maurice has at least partly recovered, he takes Jessie to the [[Seaside resort|seaside]] at [[Whitstable]] in Kent.<ref></ref> As they sit down by the water Maurice says to Jessie "Now, we can really talk", and dies, leaning on her. At the memorial services, Jessie meets Maurice's ex-wife Valerie, who could not find satisfaction in Maurice's love life either. The last scene shows Jessie and others posing as models for the Venus character.

Volver
 Raimunda ([[Penélope Cruz]]) and Soledad ([[Lola Dueñas]]) are sisters who grew up in Alcanfor de las Infantas, a small village in [[La Mancha]], but now both live in [[Madrid]]. Their parents died in a fire three years prior to the beginning of the film.  Sole (Soledad) returns to the village for the funeral of her elderly and dementia-stricken Aunt Paula ([[Chus Lampreave]]). Aunt Paula's neighbour Agustina ([[Blanca Portillo]]) confesses to Sole that she has heard Paula talking to the ghost of Sole's mother Irene ([[Carmen Maura]]). Sole encounters the ghost herself, and when she returns to [[Madrid]], she discovers that the ghost has stowed away in the trunk of her car. Irene has brought luggage, intending to stay with her daughter for a while, and Sole, though frightened, agrees to let her mother stay with her: Sole operates a hair salon in her apartment, and Irene will assist her, posing as a Russian woman to hide her true identity. Sole tries to determine why her mother's ghost has returned to Earth, asking her if she left anything undone in her life. Irene says that she does have issues to resolve, relating to the questions of why Raimunda hates her and why she is afraid to reveal herself to Raimunda.  Meanwhile, Raimunda and her daughter Paula ([[Yohana Cobo]]) have a different death to cope with. Paula's father Paco (Antonio de la Torre) attempts to [[rape]] her, claiming that he is not really her father, and Paula stabs him in self-defense. Raimunda quickly hides the corpse in the deep-freezer of a nearby restaurant with an absent owner. The restaurant owner, Emilio (Carlos Blanco), is out of town and entrusted Raimunda with the keys so that she can show it to prospective tenants. When members of a film crew happen upon the restaurant, Raimunda strikes a deal to cater for them, and suddenly finds herself back in the restaurant business.  Raimunda reveals to Paula that Paco was not in fact her biological father, and promises to tell her the whole story at a later time. Agustina is diagnosed with terminal [[cancer]] and must go to Madrid for medical treatment. Raimunda visits her in the hospital. Agustina asks Raimunda if she has seen her mother's ghost. Agustina hopes that the ghost will be able to tell her about the fate of her own mother, who disappeared three years ago without a trace. Raimunda undertakes the task of disposing of Paco's remains: she leaves Paula with Sole, rents a van and transports the freezer to a convenient spot by the river [[Júcar]], 180 kilometres away. While staying in Sole's apartment, Paula meets her grandmother's ghost and grows close to her. The next night, Agustina comes to the restaurant to renew her request to Raimunda to ask her mother's ghost about her own mother's whereabouts. She reveals two startling secrets: that Raimunda's father and Agustina's mother were having an affair and that Agustina's mother disappeared on the same day that Raimunda's parents died.  Sole finally confesses to Raimunda that she has seen their mother's ghost and that the ghost is, in fact, watching television in the next room with Paula. Irene admits that she did not, in fact, die in the fire, and reveals the whole truth. We learn that the reason for Raimunda and Irene's estrangement is that Raimunda's father [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] her, resulting in the birth of Paula; thus Paula is Raimunda's daughter and also her sister. Raimunda had been angry with her mother for never noticing and ending this abuse. Irene tells Raimunda that she had never understood Raimunda's anger and distance until her Aunt Paula told her about what her husband had done to her daughter, and Irene became furious with herself when she found out.  Irene explains that she found her husband in bed with another woman and started the fire that killed them both. The ashes that had been presumed to be Irene's were, in fact, the ashes of Agustina's mother, the woman with whom Irene's husband was having an affair. After the fire, Irene wandered for several days in the countryside, until she decided that she wanted to turn herself in. But first, she wanted to say goodbye to her sister Paula, who had lost the ability to look after herself and with whom Irene had been living prior to setting the fire that killed her husband. Paula, who was living in the past due to her senility, welcomed Irene home as if nothing had happened, and Irene stayed, caring for her sister and expecting that the police would come soon to arrest her. Due to the superstitious and closed nature of the community, however, the police never came and the residents, who are accustomed to tales of the dead returning, explained the rare sightings of Irene as "un fantasma", a ghost.  The family reunites at Aunt Paula's house. Irene reveals her presence to Agustina, who believes her to be a ghost. Irene pledges to stay in the village and care for Agustina as her cancer worsens, saying to Raimunda that it was the least that she could do after killing Agustina's mother. In the last scene Raimunda visits her mother at Agustina's house. The two embrace and tell one another that they now have time to repair their relationship.

Harischandra convinces Prem to meet Poonam first before deciding anything. Respecting his father's wishes, Prem agrees to meet Poonam, to get to know her better and then make a decision. They visit Krishnakant's family and let Prem and Poonam get acquainted with each other. Though their first conversation is awkward, Prem and Poonam agree to get married, as they are instantly attracted to each other. Prem and Poonam get engaged and set to be married in six months.

Prem and Poonam go through the most magical and romantic period of their lives. Coming from different sensibilities, both want their relationship to be very right for each other. Both realize the importance of the engagement rings that they have given to each other and the special right that they have got on each other in return. They begin to fall in love and become attached to each other (thanks to the gentle prodding of their respective siblings) and like the full title of this movie (Vivah — a Journey from Engagement to Marriage) says, this movie is about Prem & Poonam's journey and how their relationship & love evolves and deepens over the course of their engagement (and the rest of the film) until they are officially married.  But when tragedy strikes on the eve of their wedding, it could derail everything. Will it be the end of the "happily ever after" for Prem & Poonam?

Wag Kang Lilingon
  The plot is separated into three parts: Uyayi, Salamin, and the film's epilogue.  ===Uyayi (Lullaby)===  The Angel of Mercy Hospital is cursed by unknown spirits, most of them male patients. A nurse named Melissa ([[Anne Curtis]]) is haunted by these spirits and seeks help from her boyfriend, James ([[Marvin Agustin]]). Both Melissa and James conclude that someone from the hospital murdered these patients, and Melissa suspects that Dr. Carl ([[Raymond Bagatsing]]), one of the head doctors, is the killer. James offers to spy around the hospital, pretending to be a sick patient.  One night, another patient is killed, with some doctors speculating that he died during sleep paralysis. During the investigation, one of the nurses Melissa works with recognizes James as a former patient. Melissa is shocked and searches the hospital's files for James' documents. It is revealed that James was a former patient of the hospital who was taken in for psychosis after his girlfriend died due to a botched abortion. Melissa confronts James and begins distancing herself from him.  Melissa's sanity begins to decline after she finds Dr. Carl dead in his car at the hospital parking. She begins to panic and run away as a series of apparitions manifest around her. She eventually bumps into James', who comforts her.  At 3AM the next morning, the hauntings worsen. Melissa enters an elevator that begins to shake and the lights turn on and off. The elevator stops on a floor and opens to show James murdered and hanging from the ceiling. She becomes scared, gets off on the next floor, and calls James to meet her as she feels that his life is in danger. James meets up with Melissa, calming her down and formulating their next move. Melissa leads James to a room where she says he'll be safe.  Melissa soon begins an argument with James, saying that he doesn't believe her and that he thinks she's crazy. She turns her back from James and starts humming a lullaby. Worried, James asks her if she's okay. Melissa turns to James, asking him if he loves her, then tells him that if he loves her, he shouldn't look back. As James begins to look behind him, Melissa pushes him to a shelf full of chemicals, severely burning half of his face. Melissa then stabs him to death with a scalpel, revealing her to be the killer.  ===Salamin (Mirror)===  Rosing ([[Cherry Pie Picache]]), along with her daughters, Angel ([[Kristine Hermosa]]) and Nina (Celine Lim), begin a new life at their new home. The house is old and has been uninhabited for years. The caretaker, Nestor ([[Soliman Cruz]]), tells them the electricity doesn't work, while Rosing detects the smell of blood. Angel dismisses her mother, suggesting that it's just her sickness. The girls explore the rest of the house, with Nina trying to open a door leading to the basement, but to no avail.  That night, while making dinner, the mysterious door suddenly opens. The family goes down the basement and see an antique-looking mirror. Angel then tells Nina of a superstition: during a full moon, you light a candle in front of a mirror and, if you wish hard enough, you will see your future husband. Rosing objects to the idea, saying that it's dangerous and that they shouldn't be messing with stuff in the basement. The girls don't listen and they do the ritual. Nina becomes disappointed when nothing happens. The next day, strange things begin to happen, such as dead cats collecting outside their front door and apparitions suddenly appearing. Angel asks Nestor if anyone has died in the house, but Nestor replies that nobody died there.  The hauntings worsen and a frantic Angel seeks help from her psychic friend, Trixie ([[Dimples Romana]]). Trixie reveals that the mirror became a portal that opened after doing their ritual and that the spirits from the mirror were souls of the previous tenants of the house. Trixie suggests that they get rid of the mirror, with her and Angel dumping it in a river. Rosing decides to have the house blessed afterwards. Later on, Angel finds out that a former tenant, a woman, was murdered in the house. As she goes to visit the woman's grave, Angel sees Nestor and confronts him about lying to her about the house. Nestor rebuffs her, saying that all houses have ghosts. When Angel asks whether the killer was caught, Nestor reveals that he has been suspected, but was cleared of the charge.  One morning, another haunting incident occur and the family decide to leave the house for good. While departing, Angel sees the mirror that she and Trixie dumped in the river, and foresaw the death of her family. Rosing asks Angel what she was doing, but as Angel begins to explain and point at the mirror, the mirror was gone. The family goes to Trixie and asks if they can stay with her for a few days, to which she happily obliged. That night, the spirits have followed them and begins to haunt them relentlessly. After the haunting stopped, Angel decides to go back to the house to figure out a way to stop the spirits.   Angel arrives at the house, goes to the basement, and is shocked to see Nestor there. Angel figures out that Nestor was the killer. Nestor begins to chase Angel around the house, with Trixie, Rosing, and Nina arriving to come to Angel's aid. Trixie is bludgeoned on the head by Nestor and corners Angel, Rosing, and Nina. Rosing and Angel are stabbed, while Nina runs away. Nestor chases after her and Nina becomes trapped in the basement. Cornered, Nestor hums a lullaby (the same lullaby Melissa hums in Uyayi), telling Nina to come out. A bleeding Angel then hits Nestor on the head, his head bashing on a mirror, killing him. Angel then dies in Nina's arms.  ===Epilogue=== In a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that Nina became an orphan after the events of Salamin. She is placed in an orphanage and she changes her name to Melissa. She leaves for the [[United States]], where she studied nursing and worked there for the next 6 years, only to return to the [[Philippines]] to work at the Angel of Mercy hospital. It is then revealed that her childhood home was demolished and the hospital was erected in its place. The spirits that haunts the Angel of Mercy hospital are the same ghosts that haunted Melissa's old house.  Melissa is then seen driving James' body to Angel's dream house. During dinner, Melissa is seen talking to Angel, Rosing, and James, who is alive and well. A sad Angel then tells Melissa that she can't keep them in the mortal world and that she must let them go. As the camera zooms out, it is shown that Melissa is alone, with James' body on a dining chair, talking to herself and carrying the entire conversation.   The movie ends with Melissa hearing James whisper her name, leaning closer towards him. Suddenly, James awakens from his unconscious state and grabs her by the neck as she screams and the screen cuts to black.

We Are Marshall
 On the evening of November 14, 1970, [[Southern Airways Flight 932]], a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] chartered by [[Marshall University]] to transport the Thundering Herd football team back to [[Huntington, West Virginia]] following their 17–14 defeat to the [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina University Pirates]], clips trees on a ridge just one mile short of the runway at [[Tri-State Airport]] in [[Ceredo, West Virginia]], and crashes into a nearby gully, killing all 75 people on board.   The deceased include the 37 players; head coach [[Rick Tolley]] and five members of his coaching staff; Charles E. Kautz, Marshall's athletics director; team athletic trainer Jim Schroer and his assistant, Donald Tackett; sports information director and radio play-by-play announcer Gene Morehouse; 25 [[booster club|boosters]]; and five crew members.  In the wake of the tragedy, University President [[Donald Dedmon]] leans towards indefinitely suspending the football program, but he is ultimately persuaded to reconsider by the pleas of the Marshall students and Huntington residents, and especially the few football players who didn't make the flight, led by Nate Ruffin. Dedmon hires [[Jack Lengyel]] as head coach who, with the help of [[William "Red" Dawson|Red Dawson]] (one of two surviving members of the previous coaching staff) manages to rebuild the team in a relatively short time, despite losing many of their prospects to West Virginia University. Dedmon travels to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], where he pleads with the [[NCAA]] to waive their rule prohibiting freshmen from playing varsity football (a rule which had been abolished in 1968 for all sports except for football and basketball, and would be permanently abolished for those sports in 1972). Dedmon returns victorious.  The new team is composed mostly of the 18 returning players (three varsity, 15 sophomores) and walk-on athletes from other Marshall sports programs. Due to their lack of experience, the "Young Thundering Herd" ends up losing its first game, 29–6, to the [[Morehead State University|Morehead State]] Eagles. The loss weighs heavily on Dawson and Ruffin, who had been hurt in the first play of the game.

When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)
 On one side of town, a babysitter and the kids she is babysitting are brutally murdered outside a funfair. The police find that the murderer used his bare hands to tear them to shreds. The shot then changes to teenager Jill Johnson ([[Camilla Belle]]), who is going through a teenage crisis at high school: having her boyfriend, Bobby ([[Brian Geraghty]]), cheat on her with her best friend Tiffany ([[Katie Cassidy]]) and going over 800 minutes on her cell phone for which her father Ben ([[Clark Gregg]]), has her babysit for a wealthy family to pay off the debt causing Jill to be grounded for one month. The unfortunate timing causes Jill to miss out on a school [[bonfire]], which her other best friend, Scarlett ([[Tessa Thompson]]), is attending. Jill arrives at the elaborate Mandrakis House in Elan Valley, which has a [[greenhouse]] built in the center. It houses many birds and has a pool containing several fish. The parents ([[Derek de Lint]] and [[Kate Jennings Grant]]), show her around and tell her about their live-in housemaid Rosa Ramirez (Rosine Ace Hatem). Mrs. Mandrakis then gives Jill their numbers, stating that they won't be back until midnight. As the kids ([[Arthur Young (actor born 1995)|Arthur Young]] and [[Madeline Carroll]]) are seen to be upstairs asleep, Jill soon begins to receive anonymous phone calls.  Tiffany visits but Jill, fearing in getting into further trouble, asks her to leave. However, a tree branch, knocked down by the storm outside, blocks the road near the gate. When Tiffany gets out to move the broken branch, she is apparently attacked by an unknown figure. The calls continue, each one becoming more alarming, suggesting she is being watched. Jill calls the police, who tell her they can trace the calls if she is able to keep him on the line for one minute. While waiting for the phone to ring, Jill sees a shadow moving in the guesthouse. She goes there to investigate, but finds that the guest house is empty. After seeing a light switch on in the house, Jill quickly makes her way back to the main house. She then starts upstairs toward the maid's room when the phone rings again. The unknown stalker continues to remain quiet on the other end as Jill tries to keep him talking for 60 seconds so the call can be traced by the police. As Jill opens the door to the maid's room, where she hears the shower running, she asks the man on the phone "What do you want?!". He replies "Your blood.....all over me". As Jill hangs up instantly, the police call back right away telling her that the calls are coming from inside the house. The phone disconnects as Jill hears another phone ringing in the bathroom. She turns and finds Tiffany dead on the bathroom floor with her cell phone right next to her. Jill shrieks with terror to see her friend dead.  As Jill collects the Mandrakis children, she looks up to see the stranger looking down at her from the loft. Jill and the children run into the [[greenhouse]]. Jill discovers the housemaid Rosa dead inside the pool as the attacker breaks in. They quickly escape and Jill manages to lock the man inside the greenhouse, but he finds another way out and attacks her. During the ensuing struggle, Jill manages to burn the man's back with the fireplace and then stab him in the hand with an iron fireplace poker, before rushing out of the house into the arms of an Elan Valley police officer.  As the injured stranger is taken by the police, his face is shown by the moonlight staring at her. While recuperating, Jill awakens in the hospital and the phone rings. She lets it ring, worrying that the horrific events will reoccur. She waits for a time and leaves the phone ringing, the camera pans to her reflection in the mirror, revealing the stranger to be behind her. The man grabs Jill, who shrieks hysterically, waking her [[hallucination]] and finding herself still in the hospital while yelling that "he's in the house". The film ends with the doctors and her dad desperately trying to stop her frantic panicking, while the screen fades to black and the movie ends.  
Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior
 Wendy Wu ([[Brenda Song]]) is an average, popular, American teenager whose life is turned upside down by a visit from a young [[Buddhist]] monk Shen ([[Shin Koyamada]]). Shen claims Wendy is the reincarnation of an all-powerful almighty female warrior, and the only one who can prevent an ancient evil spirit from destroying the world. Shen begs Wendy to wear an incredibly strong and powerful amulet that will protect her from evil until he can fully train her in [[martial arts]].  Appalled by Shen's obvious lack of fashion sense - he usually wears what looks like a bath robe - Wendy is too busy campaigning for [[Homecoming Queen]] against her school arch rival, Jessica Dawson, to be bothered with rescuing civilization. Wendy's traditional grandmother knows that Shen is speaking the truth; her mother (Wendy's great-grandmother) was the previous Yin Warrior who ninety years earlier defeated Yan-Lo in China. However, the others in Wendy's family have lost touch with their Chinese heritage. Shen's discussion of Chinese culture inspire Wendy's mother, a researcher at Fair Springs National History Museum, and Shen's [[mooncake]]s do the same for Wendy's father. However, faced with the choice between fighting evil and going shopping, Wendy is off to the mall in a heartbeat with her best friends Tory and Lisa. Yan-Lo soon materializes, and sets out to destroy Wendy before she can attain her full Yin Warrior powers and abilities. In quick succession, the dark spirit possesses a security guard at the museum, Wendy's brother, her dog, her principal, her teachers, her best friend Tory, and even Jessica Dawson. Wendy breaks up with her boyfriend Austin after noticing how much of a jerk he is, and starts to bond more with Shen. With Shen's help, her teachers are possessed by the souls of the [[Five Animals]] of [[Chinese martial arts]] to help teach Wendy. Mr. Medina becomes the [[Hung Ga|Tiger]], Coach Gibbs becomes the [[Snake Kung Fu|Snake]], Mr. Tobias becomes the [[Fujian White Crane|Crane]], Mr. Garibay becomes the [[Leopard Kung Fu|Leopard]], and Shen himself becomes the [[Dragon Kung Fu|Dragon]]. Wendy completes her training, and learns that she has become Homecoming Queen. She then discovers that the night she does battle is the same night as the Homecoming Dance. Feeling betrayed, she opts out. On the night of the Homecoming, her grandmother insists that Wendy fulfill her destiny, but Wendy refuses.

Though something of an idol amongst his female audience he has a melancholic awareness of the slow disappearance of that audience and of his advancing years. He is completely knocked off balance when he meets strikingly attractive and much younger businesswoman Marion.

Whirlygirl
  The Whirlygirl (Mazur) is a [[professional]] [[exotic dancer]] that travels to all-male schools and entertains her audiences.

Raol enlists the aid of his friend James Edwards (Morris) to formulate plans for a successful event that will feature the Whirly Girl.  The party goes off without a hitch and the boys celebrate and praise James for his efforts.  During the celebration, though, James realizes that his dead dad's watch has gone missing and suspects the Whirlygirl has stolen it.  He tracks down Alice (the actual name of the Whirly Girl) to her New York City apartment and confronts her.  He recovers his watch and divulges its sentimental value to Alice. During this confrontation, James and Alice make a connection and the remainder of the film follows the growth of their relationship, which endures a number of trials.  Along the way, Alice helps the typically strait-laced, obedient James take more risks &mdash; which in the film includes skipping school, partying, and dodging police officers.  Reciprocating, James helps the wild Alice reconnect with her family, end her scandalous relationships, and realize her dream of becoming a professional (non-exotic) dancer.  Late in the film, James faces expulsion from his school for his unusual behavior and repeatedly skipping class.  Alice comes to his rescue and persuades the school to give him a second chance.  At its conclusion, Alice decides to leave her former life behind and start fresh in another town.  She invites James, but he decides it's best to finish his education first.  As a memento of their experiences together, James gives Alice his watch and Alice promises to one day return it.  As she drives away, James simply says, "I know you will."

 Two best friends from the province of [[Iloilo]], Pearl ([[Pauleen Luna]]), a simple and smart girl, and her longtime best friend Jonathan ([[Gian Carlos]]), who secretly harbors romantic feelings for her, arrive in Manila to study in an Arts Academy. Upon enrollment, a clique of students led by Mimi ([[Iwa Moto]]), takes interest in them. Mimi is a pretty, rich and popular girl who gets her way through bullying others. Her minions consist of her right-hand woman, painter Eva (Katarina Perez), basketball jock Joshua ([[Jason Abalos]]), film and photography major Jowee ([[Glaiza de Castro]]), and delinquent band frontman Hector ([[Ketchup Eusebio]]).  Mimi takes Pearl and Jonathan into her fold, befriending them in exchange for academic favors from the smart and studious Pearl. However, Pearl rebuffs the clique after realizing their deceptions; while Jonathan, on the other hand, is seduced and swayed by a prominent fraternity. Soon after, Pearl and Jonathan's close friendship becomes estranged.  One night, Pearl experiences strange paranormal occurrences in the campus and has visions of a woman in white singing a folk lullaby. She and Jonathan learn from others of the story of a white lady which has been rumored to have frequented the school grounds. A carpenter reveals to Jonathan about a storage shed that burnt down and a vision of the said woman at the same spot. Pearl meets and befriends Tasya, a kindhearted [[Guimaras]]-born elderly woman residing in a house situated on the Academy's vast campus. Tasya tells the story of her granddaughter Christina ([[Angelica Panganiban]]), a simple girl also hailing from Iloilo and Guimaras who was reportedly driven into hiding by Mimi’s pompousness. Pearl immediately feels an affinity towards Christina since both girls have been on the receiving end of Mimi’s dirty actions.  The haunting worsens when Pearl lands the highly coveted lead role in the school play, which also earns her the brunt of Mimi’s ire since Mimi had wanted the role for herself. On top of everything else, a burgeoning relationship begins to kindle between Pearl and Robbie ([[JC de Vera]]), the rich, athletic and most popular guy in school, whom Mimi also desires.  Flashbacks show the story of Christina. Robbie befriends her after rescuing her from bullies and Mimi's gang. The two begin a relationship which his father opposed and forced them to separate and have Robbie choose Mimi. Soon thereafter, Mimi's friends begin to torment her frequently. Christina shuns Robbie after being having her way by his and the gang's actions. After the gang imprison her in a storage shed, Mimi poisons a janitor to silence him and Robbie, under her influence, murders Christina by setting the shed on fire.  In a series of intense ghostly appearances, the white lady manifests herself to the "in" group, letting them experience her wrath one by one. Hector is suffocated by rats when he falls into a hole after encountering the entity dissolving to rodents, Joshua falls from Mimi's bedroom window after a possessed doll chases him, Eva's arm is severed when she tries to escape an art room where she tries to finish a painting, Jowee is blinded by flashes in a [[darkroom]] and gets hyperventilated, while Mimi is hit by shattered mirror shards in a dressing room during a concert's premiere.   During a Halloween feast, Pearl receives news that her mother is suffering from leukemia and reveals to Robbie that she is returning to Iloilo. Robbie grows overzealous and disoriented after seeing Christina's vision in his cellphone. Pearl escapes to a gypsy tent wherein she is drawn to a vision that relives the final moments of Christina. It is from here that she learns of Robbie's crime and she shuns Robbie.  While on the run, Pearl is captured by Robbie and dragged to the storage shed. Jonathan witnesses this and intervenes only to be subdued by Robbie. In an attempt to silence them, Robbie sets the shed on fire and flees the scene on a motorcycle. The white lady, now revealed to be Christina, appears and causes his motorcycle to crash. He flees to a carillon wherein bells play a lullaby and Christina causes Robbie to fall to his death. It is then revealed that Pearl and Jonathan manage to survive and escape the shed fire unharmed due to Christina's soul diverting the flames. Later on, Christina walks to a light in a field, presumably the gate of Heaven, where God's spirit awaits her.  Later on, Pearl returns to the province and visits Tasya wherein she reveals that her mother has died of the ailment. As Tasya reveals that she sees Christina's soul departing for the after life, Pearl states that despite their losses, they vow to take care of each other. As they comfort each other, Christina's voice sings her lullaby as she gazes down from Heaven with God on the two in the form of wind and sunlight.

Wicked Little Things
 In 1913, in Carlton, [[Pennsylvania]] (shot in [[Bulgaria]]), the cruel owner of the Carlton mine exploits poor immigrant children. In order to excavate a new shaft quickly, he employs a dynamite charge, but the explosion causes the mine to collapse, burying a large group of the children alive. Following his later trial for wilfully causing the death of his workers, Carlton is acquitted and the mine closed down.  In present day, eighty years later, Karen Tunny has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease and has inherited his birthhome near the since-abandoned Carlton mine. She moves to the house with her daughters, Sarah and Emma. The three stop by the local market for supplies and are told by Walter, the shopkeeper, that he doesn't deliver to the area they live in. While driving, Karen has a near miss with a man crossing the road. She exits the car, looking for the man, but he's nowhere to be found. They arrive at the house and Sarah points out the blood on the door while Karen declares it's just "paint."  When Emma hears children giggling, she leaves the house, following the sound of it. Karen goes out looking for Emma and finds her in an old mine. As they try to find their way back to the house, it becomes nightfall and they get lost. They find a house, which is occupied by Hanks, and enter. Karen is advised by Hanks to stay at home during the night, and he also tells her that there is no need to thank him for the blood smeared on his and the Tunny's door.  William Carlton, the last surviving heir of the Carlton estate, which has owned the mine since 1913, is hungrily devouring property and kicking people off his own property. Meanwhile, the zombie children begin to kill, which is dismissed among the community as disappearances, though it is hinted that most of the community is aware of the presence of the children.  As it turns out, the Tunny and Hanks families are relatives of the zombie children who happen to leave blood relatives alive while killing all others. Emma, who has had friendly contact with a less-violent zombie named Mary, informs her mother that the zombies won't eat her, and that Mary would not directly hurt her mother (who is not a direct Tunny blood relative), but passes on the warning that the other children might. Karen finds some old family photo albums in the basement that contain pictures of her late husband, as well as the Tunny and Hanks children who died in the mine disaster, thus revealing that the family is related to some of the children who died in the mine.  Karen and Sarah leave the house to go look for Emma. As they exit the mine, not being able to find Emma, they become surrounded by a dozen of the children. They escape, with the children pursuing them, and find a car passing through with Carlton inside. They enter, telling him to drive, but the tires are slashed before they can pull away.   Karen and Sarah run to Hanks' house, unsure of what to do. Soon enough, Karen figures out that Hanks' blood has a supposed repellent effect on the zombie children. As both Hanks and Carlton attempt to shoot the children, they realize the bullets are ineffective, and run to the barn.   Hanks realizes that, as he and Emma are direct blood relatives, it turns out Mary has an older brother that's also a Tunny, and Karen is in some way protected by Emma's relationship with Mary. The children are really after Carlton, as they blame his family for the mining accident that killed them.   After Carlton is killed by the children, Emma remarks that they won't be hurting anyone anymore.   At the end, the Tunny family drives away and reveals that the house has not been sold. Now, Mary lives in the house, with the bear that Emma gave her, and a few of the other children as well.  
The Wicker Man (2006 film)
 Policeman Edward Malus ([[Nicolas Cage]]) receives news from his ex-fiancée, Willow Woodward ([[Kate Beahan]]), that her daughter, Rowan (Erika Shaye Gair), is missing. He travels to the western United States and takes a ferry to a coastal area where he gets a pilot ([[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]]) to take him to an island off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] where a group of [[Modern paganism|neo-pagans]] live.  The island is led by Sister Summersisle ([[Ellen Burstyn]]), an elderly woman who supposedly represents the [[goddess]] they worship. Sister Summersisle explains to Edward that her ancestors had left England to avoid persecution, only to settle near Salem and find renewed persecution in the [[Salem witch trials]], before arriving on the island. Sister Summersisle explains that their population is predominantly female as they choose the strongest stock&mdash;evading Edward's concern about the birth of unwanted males. The economy of the island relies on the production of local honey, which Edward learns has declined recently.  Edward asks the villagers about Rowan, but they give him evasive answers. He later sees two men carrying a large bag that appears to be dripping blood, and then he finds a fresh, unmarked grave in the churchyard. The grave turns out to contain only a burned doll, but Edward finds Rowan's sweater in the churchyard.  At the village school, teacher Sister Rose ([[Molly Parker]]) tries to prevent Edward from seeing the class register. When he sees that Rowan's name has been crossed out he becomes enraged at the teacher's and Rowan's classmates' lies. Rose demands Edward talk outside and, after a short discussion of the island people's view of death, Rose explains that Rowan is "letting it snow". Edward asks how Rowan died and Sister Rose tells him first that "She'll burn to death". When Edward catches the tense she used, Sister Rose corrects herself quickly, saying, "She burned to death", and rushes back to her class.  When Edward questions Willow about the grave, she reveals that Rowan is his daughter.  As Edward searches through the island for clues and answers, he eventually grows to realise the community is a [[matriarchal religion|matriarchal]] [[dystopian]] society.  On the day of the [[fertility rite]], Edward frantically searches the village for Rowan. He attacks Sister Beech ([[Diane Delano]]), who has a bear costume for the ritual. Edward incapacitates Sister Honey ([[Leelee Sobieski]]), dons the bear suit, and joins the parade led by Sister Summersisle.  The parade ends at the site of the festival. Rowan is tied to a large tree, seemingly about to be burned. Edward rescues Rowan and they run away through the woods, but Rowan leads him back to Sister Summersisle. Sister Summersisle thanks Rowan for her help, and Edward realizes that the search for Rowan was a trap. Sister Willow is Sister Summersisle's daughter, and his fate was sealed many years ago, when Sister Willow chose him. The villagers attack Edward and overpower him, viciously breaking his legs with a mallet to prevent him from escaping. They then place a cage-like helmet on his head, and pour live bees into it, which sting him mercilessly. Throughout all this, he keeps asking how can he be a good sacrifice if he does not believe in their religion. The women carry him to a giant [[wicker man]] and shut him inside. Rowan sets fire to the wicker man and Edward is sacrificed amid his screams and a giant blaze. The crowd chants "The drone must die!", believing that Edward's sacrifice will restore their honey production.  Six months later, sisters Willow and Honey enter a bar and start talking with two off-duty police officers ([[James Franco]] and [[Jason Ritter]]). Sister Honey offers to go home with one of the cops, presumably in hopes of using them as they used Edward. The buzzing of bees and screaming from Edward Malus can be heard over Sister Honey as the film cuts to black.

Days later, Nigel goes mad and, under the impression they have hit an iceberg, jumps overboard, Only to discover that the ship has run aground in Africa.   In Africa,the group quickly discovers that all the animals in the area are being evacuated by the carriers, as a nearby volcano erupts. They witness Ryan escaping, but he runs into the jungle.

The rest of the group head back to the ship, but Samson decides to keep trying to find his son. While walking, Samson starts seeing plants and rocks change colors.   Nigel is captured by a herd of wildebeests who dwell in the volcano, and their leader Kazar, pronounces him 'The Great Him', based on an 'omen' he received when he was young: about to be devoured by lions, a toy koala fell from the sky (actually from a plane) and scared the lions away, saving his life. Kazar Has founded a cult intent on changing the food chain, Anticipating the day when "prey become predators" and vice versa. For this, he needs to eat a lion, Which he believes that Nigel's help will allow him to do. Bridget and Larry are also captured and held prisoner.  Ryan hides up an old tree, but is attacked by a gang of vultures led by Scab and Scraw acting under orders from Kazar. The branch breaks and traps his paw. Samson hears Ryan's cries and runs to save him, scaring off the birds. The two reunite, but are interrupted by Kazar's wildebeest minions led by Blag. Ryan is shocked when Samson tells him to run. The two retreat to a tree where Samson reveals the truth. He was born in the circus and like Ryan, was unable to roar.   One night, he was forced to appear in a show with the intent of him roaring at a mechanical bull but failed due to his inability to roar, much to the disappointment of the audience. Later, his uncaring father disowns him as a son and allows him to be sent to the zoo, claiming that he would know how to roar if he were born in the wild. After becoming an orphan, he lied to avoid the shame. The wildebeests discover them and, in the scuffle, send the tree over the cliff with Samson still hanging on. Ryan is captured and taken to the volcano.  Benny finds Samson and encourages him to be himself, even if he's not from the wild. They find two chameleons, who were leading Samson to the volcano and are also trying to defeat Kazar's army of his kind. Samson uses the chameleons' camouflage abilities to slip into Kazar's lair. Nigel tries his best to stall the wildebeests from cooking his friends, and eventually Samson fights Kazar but is overwhelmed. Ryan, seeing Samson in danger, climbs onto a catapulting device and launches himself at Kazar, finally letting out a roar.   With Kazar distracted, Samson manages to defeat him. Ryan tells Samson that he is happy to have him for a dad. The other wildebeests are touched by this and refuse to serve Kazar any further. Samson gains the courage he has needed after seeing the illusion of the mechanical wildebeest over a charging Kazar and roars powerfully enough to push him back. The animals, along with the wildebeests, flee except Kazar, who is trapped by the toy koala's pull-string and crushed to death in the erupting volcano. The animals and wildebeests manage to escape on the boat and travel back to the New York Zoo.  
The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)
 [[County Cork]], [[Ireland]], 1920. Dr. Damien O'Donovan is about to leave his native village to practise medicine in a London hospital. Meanwhile, his brother Teddy commands the local [[flying column]] of the [[Irish Republican Army]]. After a [[hurling]] match, Damien witnesses the [[summary execution]] of his friend, Micheál Ó Súilleabháin, by British [[Black and Tans]]. Although shaken, Damien rebuffs his friends' entreaties to stay in Ireland and join the IRA, saying that the war is unwinnable. As he is leaving town, Damien witnesses the [[British Army]] vainly trying to intimidate a railway personnel for refusing to permit the troops to board. In response, Damien decides to stay and is sworn into Teddy's IRA brigade.  After drilling in the mountains, the column raids the village's [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks to acquire revolvers, then uses them to assassinate four [[Auxiliary Division|Auxiliaries]]. In the aftermath, [[Anglo-Irish]] landowner Sir John Hamilton coerces one of his servants, IRA member Chris Reilly, into passing information to the [[British Army]]'s [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]]. As a result, the entire brigade is arrested. In their cell, Damien meets the train driver, Dan, a union official who shares Damien's [[socialist]] views.  Meanwhile, British officers interrogate Teddy, pulling out his fingernails when he refuses to give them the names of IRA members. Johnny Gogan, a British soldier of Irish descent, helps the prisoners escape, but three are left behind. After the actions of Sir John and Chris are revealed to the IRA's intelligence network, both are taken hostage. As Teddy is still recovering, Damien is temporarily placed in command. News arrives that the three remaining IRA prisoners have been tortured and shot. Simultaneously, the brigade receives orders to "execute the spies".  Despite the fact that Chris is a lifelong friend, Damien shoots both him and Sir John. Later, the IRA ambushes and wipes out a convoy of the Auxiliary Division, and in retaliation another detachment of Auxiliaries loots and burns the farmhouse of Damien's sweetheart, [[Cumann na mBan]] member Sinéad Sullivan. Sinéad is held at gunpoint while her head is roughly shorn, her scalp being wounded in the process. Later, as Damien treats her, a messenger arrives with news of a formal [[ceasefire]] between Britain and the IRA.  After the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] is signed, the brigade learns that a partitioned Ireland will only be granted [[Dominion]] status within the [[British Empire]]. As a result, the brigade divides over accepting the terms of the Treaty. Teddy and his allies argue that accepting the Treaty will bring peace now while further gains can be made later. Others oppose the Treaty, proposing to continue fighting until a united Irish Republic can be obtained. Dan and Damien further demand the [[collectivisation]] of industry and agriculture. Any other course, declares Dan, will change only "the accents of the powerful and the colour of the flag".  Soon the [[Irish Free State]] replaces British rule, and Teddy and his allies begin patrolling in [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] uniforms. Meanwhile, Damien and his allies join the [[Anti-Treaty IRA]]. When the [[Battle of Dublin (1922)|Battle of Dublin]] launches the [[Irish Civil War]], the Anti-Treaty column commences [[guerrilla warfare]] against Free State forces. As the violence escalates, Teddy expresses fear that the British will invade if the republicans gain the upper hand. His position is: "They take one out, we take one back. To hell with the courts."  Soon after, Dan is killed and Damien is captured during a raid for arms on an Irish Army barracks commanded by Teddy. Sentenced to [[summary execution|execution]], Damien is held in the same cell where the British Army imprisoned them earlier. Desperate to avoid executing his brother, Teddy pleads with Damien to reveal where the Anti-Treaty IRA is hiding the stolen rifles. In return, Teddy offers Damien full amnesty, a life with Sinéad, and the vision of an Ireland where Pro- and Anti-Treaty Irishmen can raise families side by side. Insulted, Damien responds by saying that he will never "sell out" the Republic the way Chris Reilly did and Teddy leaves the cell in tears. Damien writes a goodbye letter to Sinéad, expressing his love for her, and quote his brother's words '''''"It's easy to know what you're against, quite another to know what you're for"'''''. But he says that he knows what he stands for and is not afraid to die for it and tells Sinéad to look after Teddy. At dawn, Damien dies before a [[firing squad]] commanded by a heartbroken yet obstinate Teddy. Teddy delivers Damien's letter to Sinéad who is distraught and heartbroken. She attacks Teddy and orders him to leave her land.

The Woods (2006 film)
  In 1965, after burning down a tree in her yard, rebel teenager Heather Fasulo ([[Agnes Bruckner]]) is sent to the [[boarding school]] Falburn Academy in the middle of the woods by her estranged mother Alice Fasulo (Emma Campbell) and negligent father Joe Fasulo ([[Bruce Campbell]]). The headmistress, Ms. Traverse ([[Patricia Clarkson]]), accepts Heather in spite of her father's bad financial condition. The displaced Heather becomes close friends with Marcy Turner ([[Lauren Birkell]]), while they are maltreated by their abusive classmate Samantha Wise ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]). During the night, Heather has a nightmare of a student named Ann, covered in blood, and hears voices that seem to be coming from the woods. The next day, Marcy tells Heather that Ann was taken to a mental institution after attempting to commit suicide, and that she'd been covered in blood.  With the help of Marcy, Heather eventually learns to adjust to her new school, even having fun at times and making more friends. Ms. Traverse subjects Heather to special tests to see if she is "gifted," telling her that it is all part of her scholarship to the academy. The girls tell Heather a spooky story about the history of Falburn, which includes three young redheaded sisters who arrived at the school and turned out to be witches, killing the headmistress before leaving to the woods. Meanwhile, Samantha continues to torment Heather, who comes to despise her and fights back. Ann returns from the mental institution, and Heather finds her one day, rocking in her bed. Ann reveals that she is afraid she will be taken by the witches. She says she is cold, so Heather climbs on a trunk to try and close the open window over Ann's bed. A low fog rushes into the room and knocks Heather down, twisting her ankle, and she is taken to the infirmary. The next day, Heather finds Ann's bed empty, her place filled with dead leaves. She witnesses the headmistress lying to the police about Ann's disappearance, remarking that she is being taken care of.  This leads her to become suspicious and she tries to talk to Marcy about it. But Marcy acts strangely, and is shadowed by one of the teachers. Soon after, Heather finds Marcy's bed empty and covered in leaves. Later, she is confronted in the woods by Samantha, who reveals that she has actually been trying to protect Heather with her antics. She tells Heather that the school is led by a coven of witches who want to take all of the girls away. Samantha explains that she has called Heather's father to help her escape and that the milk is poisoned. The girls are both caught by a school mistress, who promptly takes Samantha away. Samantha is later found hanging from a long noose in the cafeteria. When a police officer comes to investigate, Heather tells him of the missing students. The officer confronts the headmistress, but she claims that the girls ran away. Another mistress "leads" the officer into the woods to find the girls, where he is killed by the living vines of a tree.  Heather's parents show up to take her home, though the headmistress tries to persuade them otherwise. On the way home, their car is mysteriously flipped and Heather is knocked unconscious. Alice is dragged out of the car by a living vine and kicks Joe in the head, knocking him out. Heather and Joe wake up in a nearby hospital. Before they can reach each other, Ms. Traverse has Heather dragged away, then slits her own hand and forces her black blood down Joe's throat, which puts him into a catatonic state. Heather returns to the school in despair. She drinks the milk that evening, but later vomits it back up, finding tree bark in it. Back at the hospital, Joe wakes up and vomits up Ms. Traverse's black blood, which also has tree bark in it. He quickly escapes and goes to find Heather. That night, Heather begins to hear voices again, and when she attempts to leave, a living vine captures her.  When she awakens, she is wrapped in vines in a large foggy room, next to Ann and Marcy, who are also held captive. All of the teachers appear and reveal themselves to be witches. Ms. Traverse is their leader, and she explains that their spirits have been trapped in the woods all these years, and they need to inhabit the bodies of young women to escape their imprisonment. Heather appears to be the centerpiece of her plan because she has the strongest powers among the gifted students. Heather is coerced into completing the ritual, and the vines begin to mummify all of the girls in the school. Before it can complete itself, Joe breaks into the room with an ax and begins to kill the witches. Heather breaks free from the vines and grabs the ax, proceeding to chop all of the witches into pieces. Heather and Joe then leave with all of the girls, walking down the road into the daylight as the school burns in the distance behind them.  The end of the movie states that Falburn Academy burned to the ground in 1965, while the surrounding woods were strangely left untouched.  
Het Woeden der Gehele Wereld (film)
 The film is set in [[Maassluis]] and [[Leiden]], in the time of the German occupation (see [[The Netherlands in World War II]]) in the 1940s, and in the 1950s. It is about the [[coming of age]] of Alex Goudveyl ([[Maarten Heijmans]]), and about a murder.  For profit, in May 1940 Joost Vroom ([[Cees Geel]]) takes refugees (mainly Jews) on his boat to escape to England. However, the boat is attacked by the Germans. They survive, but the escape fails and the boat and the money is lost.  The Goudveyl couple has a business of second-hand goods, and profits from the [[The Netherlands in World War II#Persecution of Jews|persecution of Jews]] by cheaply buying goods of Jews who have to flee the country.  Vroom becomes police officer, first under the German occupation. He betrays Jews for profit, to recover his loss on the boat. After the war he remains police officer.  Alex loves playing piano, and is very talented. Very inconsiderately his father sells the family's piano when he is offered a good price for it, much to Alex's regret. Sometimes Alex can play piano or organ elsewhere.  Vroom is [[ephebophile]] and, for example, pays Alex for simulating masturbation with an [[eel]] between his legs substituting for his penis, so that Vroom can film it (in the book Vroom pays for seeing and touching boys' penises; the film's variation may have been chosen to allow visualisation, while keeping it decent). Alex has a gay friend William Keenids, who sometimes likes to [[cross-dress]]. We see a scene where William is in Vroom's home, with the little film of Alex being projected on a screen, and William willingly starting to undress while Vroom is filming. It is not revealed whether this is for money. In another scene, William tries to have some physical intimacy with Alex, but Alex rejects it, arguing that he is not Vroom.  Aaron Oberstein's wife died in the war. He does not know what happened to his baby son. In 1956 Vroom claims he knows who and where he is and offers to tell it for a large sum of money. Aaron brings the money at the agreed place, the warehouse of the Goudveyls. An evangelisation campaign is going on outside, while Alex plays the piano inside. Vroom is murdered by a gunshot. Alex is witness of the murder, and is afraid he will be killed later because of that.  As a student, Alex has sex with Yvonne, assistant of the professor, in an empty lecture room, at her initiative. At first Alex is willing, but when she wants more he walks away. On a second occasion, when he has Joanna Oberstein as girlfriend, he refuses sex with Yvonne. Now she threatens him with a knife. Then her boss enters the room and Alex can escape. Yvonne is fired.  Alex's parents confess to Alex that in the war they could buy their business cheaply, because the owners were deported Jews. The parents say there is another important thing to tell, but they hesitate and do not tell it yet. Soon after this, Alex's parents die of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].  It turns out that Alex's parents were not his biological parents. His biological mother died in the war, his biological father is Aaron Oberstein, the father of Alex's girlfriend. Thus Alex's girlfriend is his half-sister.  Aaron did not know that Alex was his son. The Goudveyl couple was childless, and Alex was illegally supplied to them by Vroom for profit. The couple was blackmailed by Vroom regarding this. Therefore Alex's foster mother murdered Vroom. Since she is dead now, the case is closed.  
Woman on the Beach
 Film director and screenwriter Kim Jung-rae asks his friend Won Chang-wook to drive with him from their homes in Seoul to the resort town of Shinduri, on the western coast of South Korea. Chang-wook initially resists, but accepts the request on the condition that he can bring Kim Mun-suk, a composer and aspiring singer whom he describes as being his girlfriend.  Jung-rae is writing a treatment for a film titled "About Miracles," concerning the mysterious connections that secure everyday life—themes that play a major role in the work of Hong Sang-Soo. Mun-suk quickly makes clear that she does not consider herself Chang-wook's girlfriend, and she finds herself and Jung-rae increasing drawn together. As the three drive on, Mun-suk discusses her years living abroad in Germany and reveals that she has had a number of relationships with Europeans, a fact that greatly disturbs both Chang-wook and Jung-rae.  Mun-suk is particularly disappointed in Jung-rae's reaction, claiming, "You're not like your films."  Nevertheless, Mun-suk and Jung-rae later kiss on the beach and then sleep together in a low-rent hotel room.  The next day as the three drive back to Seoul, Jung-rae pulls back from his intimacy with Mun-suk and returns to the beach alone two days later. Missing Mun-suk despite his actions, Jung-rae hits on two women, one of whom vaguely resembles Mun-suk, by introducing himself as a film director and asking to interview them for his screenplay. Jung-rae proceeds to seduce Choi Sun-hee in much the same fashion as he had Mun-suk just a few days prior. While sleeping with Sun-hee in the same beachside motel where he'd been with Mun-suk, Jung-rae is surprised to find that Mun-suk has returned to Shinduri, found his room, and started banging on the door loudly and very late at night. Jung-rae sneaks Sun-hee out of his room through a separate exit the next morning as Mun-suk sleeps at the foot of his door with a terrible hangover.  Jung-rae attempts to reconcile with Mun-suk and lies about his night with Sun-hee, although his lie is increasingly transparent to all concerned. Having alienated Mun-suk and left Sun-hee without a goodbye, Jung-rae returns to Seoul with a creative breakthrough on his screenplay.

Wolfhound (2006 film)
 The setting of the film is a [[high fantasy]] [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] [[Europe]], in which desperate and bloodthirsty warlords fight brutal battles in their eternal quest for overlordship. Yet their swords, shields, lances, spears and arrows are all brittle, prone to wear and tear, and dull, protracting their campaigns against each other without end. Word spreads of a man in one of the [[Nordic countries|Northern tribes]]: an adept [[blacksmith]] capable of crafting far hardier, stronger, sharper, and more durable weapons than any other known to exist, with aid of [[alchemy|a mystical element]]. The warlords search for the enigmatic master of weapons to no avail.  A former [[druid]] chieftain named Zhadoba, jaded by years of warfare and believing the Radiant Gods have abandoned him, learns of the identity and whereabouts of the blacksmith and his coveted weapons, more valuable than any gold in such a time. With this knowledge, Zhadoba's heart is hardened to mercy and replaced with greed and bloodlust. Bringing even the feared warlord, the Man-Eater, under his spell, Zhadoba massacres an entire people, the Clan of the Grey Hounds, including their blacksmith, and takes his legendary weapons. The only survivor of the tribe, the blacksmith's fair-haired son, witnesses the slaughter and bites at Zhadoba's tattooed hand. Instead of killing the boy, Zhadoba orders the boy to be sent into the savage [[mining|mines]] of the Crystal Mountains and to live a life of hard labor there, in conditions which will no doubt kill the boy anyway.  Against all odds, the boy cheats death through sheer determination and will, his strength becomes powerful through many years of hard labor, scarred by violence, and his prowess honed by a hunger for revenge. For many years his only companions were disheartened, tortured slaves and a strangely intelligent [[bat]], Ragged Wing, who is destined to become his constant companion. After killing his overseers with weapons created using his father's secret techniques and escaping the mines, he becomes a wanderer known as Wolfhound: a great and fearless warrior, as well as a true master of weapons like his father before him.  After making the long journey to the Man-Eater’s castle, Wolfhound finally conquers his archenemy. He also frees two prisoners, the sage and healer Tilorn and slave-girl Niilit. Wolfhound accompanies them to their home city of Galirad, which has been thrown into turmoil. The power-crazed forces under Zhadoba are poised to attack the city with their superior weapons at any moment. With enough bloodshed, and the right ritual involving royal blood, Zhadoba believes he can resurrect the ancient Dark Goddess Morana from the Celestial Gates and draw power from her. The King of Galirad, to save the city from destruction, is [[political marriage|giving his daughter away in marriage]] to Vinitar, a young warrior-prince who promises to protect Galirad - and who also happens to be the son of the late warlord, the Man-Eater. Princess Elen must travel to the land of her husband-to-be, and asks Wolfhound to be her guard in this dangerous journey. Wolfhound agrees to serve the princess and is caught up in a whirlwind of mysterious events, as the true purpose of the journey is gradually revealed, a secret which could plunge the world into an eternal living nightmare...

X-Men: The Last Stand
  Twenty years in the past, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] meet young [[Jean Grey]] at her parents' house to invite her to join their school, the [[X-Mansion]]. Ten years later, the industrialist father of [[Warren Worthington III]] discovers his son is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] as Warren tries to cut off his wings.  In the present, Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] their abilities, and offer the "cure" to any mutant who wants it. The cure is created from the [[genome]] of a young mutant named [[Leech (comics)|Jimmy]], who lives at the Worthington facility on [[Alcatraz Island]]. While some mutants are interested in the cure, including the [[X-Men]]'s [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], many others are horrified by the announcement. Lehnsherr re-establishes his [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] with those who oppose the cure, warning his followers that the cure will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race.  With help from [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]], Lehnsherr recruits [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and several other mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her, also freeing [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Jamie Madrox|Multiple Man]]. Mystique saves Lehnsherr by taking a shot of the mutant cure aimed at him, rendering Raven Darkhölme human. Hateful of humans, Lehnsherr abandons Darkhölme, much to her shock and disappointment. Meanwhile, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]], still distraught over [[X2 (film)|the loss]] of his fiancée, Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] to investigate. When they arrive, they find only [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.  When they return to the X-Mansion, Xavier explains to Logan that when Jean sacrificed herself to save them, she also freed the "[[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]", a dark and extremely powerful [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] which Xavier had telepathically repressed, frightened by the Phoenix's godly destructive potential. Logan is disgusted to learn of this psychic tampering with Jean's mind but, once she awakens, he discovers that she killed Summers and is not the Jean Grey he once knew. The Phoenix emerges, knocks out Logan, and escapes to her childhood home.  Lehnsherr learns of Jean's resurrection through Callisto, and the X-Men arrive at the Grey home at the same time as the Brotherhood. Lehnsherr and Xavier go in alone, and both vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys the house and disintegrates Xavier before Lehnsherr and Logan could save him. The scared Jean leaves with Lehnsherr. The Brotherhood decides to strike Worthington Labs, and the government sends multiple teams to attack the Brotherhood's base in the forest, with information gained from Darkhölme, furious over Lehnsherr's betrayal. However, the life forms in the camp are all copies of Multiple Man, and Lehnsherr uses his powers to move the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] so he and his army can get to Alcatraz and facilitate the attack on Worthington Labs. The remaining X-Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood.  During the fight, [[Kitty Pryde]] saves Jimmy from Juggernaut, who had been sent to kill him. Logan has Colossus throw him at Lehnsherr and distract him long enough for [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] to inject Lehnsherr with the "cure" and thus nullify his powers. Army reinforcements arrive and shoot at Jean just as Logan had calmed her down. The Phoenix is awakened by the attack and disintegrates the troops in retaliation. The Phoenix then begins to destroy Alcatraz and anyone within range of her powers. Logan realizes that only he can stop the Phoenix due to his healing factor and [[adamantium]] skeleton. When Logan approaches her, Jean momentarily gains control and begs him to save her. Logan fatally stabs Jean, stopping the Phoenix, but mourns for her death.  Sometime later, mutant rights are finally obtained and Xavier's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress. The President of the United States appoints [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] as ambassador to the [[United Nations]]. Rogue reveals to [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]] that she has taken the cure, much to his disappointment. Meanwhile, Lehnsherr sits alone at a chessboard in a San Francisco park. As he gestures toward a metal chess piece, it wobbles slightly; his powers may be returning.  In a [[post-credits scene]], [[Moira MacTaggert]] checks on a comatose patient<ref>On the DVD Commentary, it is revealed that the patient was "P. Xavier", Charles Xavier's braindead twin brother, whose character was written for the scene. Earlier in the film, MacTaggert spoke in a video about the ways of using mutant powers, such as transferring the mind of a dying man into the body of a patient with no higher brain function, giving an explanation for his resurrection.</ref> who greets her with Xavier's voice, leaving her startled.  
The World's Best Prom
 The "mega prom" was introduced to Racine almost 50 years ago by the city's [[Rotary Club]] after an alcohol-related car accident. As a result, the Rotary decided to sponsor a post-prom party for the city's high schools as a safe alternative for prom-goers. The film focuses on the prom-obsessed residents of Racine, and in particular, two very different girls and one boy (Tonya, Dori, and Ben) who are followed in the days and nights leading up to their prom night.  Racine is a racially mixed population with a similar socio-economic status. The film portrays the long history of its one-of-a-kind prom.  Some of the students are going to college after graduation; others are headed to the military. The film gives an inside look at everything from the students' selection of gowns to dinner. The celebration begins with a rowdy parade where students are shown riding fire engines, 18-wheelers, and even elephants through the city streets. Prom-goers from seven city high schools converge on one citywide prom to make red carpet entrances.  As the credits roll, we are given an update almost five years later about some of the people featured in the film. Several have not achieved their high school goals. Others have lost contact with their high school sweethearts. One heartfelt scene shows a couple going off to war.  
World Trade Center (film)
  On September 11, 2001, Port Authority Police officers [[John McLoughlin (9/11 attacks survivor)|John McLoughlin]] and [[Will Jimeno]] are patrolling the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]] when they see a plane fly dangerously low overhead. As all of the Police return to the station, they see on TV that the [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] has been hit by the plane. Sergeant McLoughlin assigns many of the officers to assist in a precautionary evacuation attempt of the North Tower and they board a Metropolitan Transit Authority bus. On the bus, they hear reports that the South Tower is also hit by another plane. When they arrive at the World Trade Center, they realize the extent of the disaster, and see one of the victims jump out of the towers to certain death. The men proceed to get safety equipment from [[Five World Trade Center|Building 5]] and enter the concourse between the towers.  The group consists of McLoughlin, Jimeno, [[Dominick Pezzulo]] and Antonio Rodrigues. Officer [[Christopher Amoroso]] appears to inform them of other events, such as the [[American Airlines Flight 77|attack on the Pentagon]], the second plane's hit on the South Tower and an attack on [[Israel]] though the group does not accept any of these as true. As the men prepare to enter the North Tower, the buildings begin to rumble. McLoughlin realizes that the South Tower is [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapsing]] onto them and that their only chance of survival is to run into the service elevator shaft. Amoroso trips and does not have time to get up, and Rodrigues is unable to get to the shaft in time, resulting in both deaths. McLoughlin, Jimeno and Pezzulo manage to escape the huge amounts of dust and rubble flying down from the South Tower. However, as the rubble continues to crush the elevator shaft, the three are trapped. As the cascade of debris subsides, Pezzulo realizes he can free himself and manages to move nearer to Jimeno in order to shift the debris covering his legs, but cannot make it to McLoughlin as he is trapped deeper in the rubble. Pezzulo tries but fails to shift the debris due to its weight, and is instructed by McLoughlin not to leave.  As Pezzulo becomes optimistic that they will live, the rumbling begins again as the North Tower starts to collapse. Although Jimeno and McLoughlin are not further harmed, Pezzulo is fatally injured when a concrete slab falls into the hole, crushing his torso. After he fires a gun through a gap in the rubble to try to alert rescuers to their position, he dies. Jimeno and McLoughlin spend hours under the rubble, in pain but exchanging stories about their lives and families. McLoughlin is particularly anxious to keep Jimeno from falling asleep and Jimeno also realizes that by straining to grab a metal bar above his body, he can make a noise that rescuers might hear. Two [[United States Marines]], [[Dave Karnes]] and [[Jason Thomas]], who are searching for survivors, do hear it and find the men, calling for help to dig them out. Jimeno is rescued first, and then hours later McLoughlin is lifted out of the debris, barely alive and in critical condition. They are then both reunited with their distraught families at the hospital. Two years after the attacks, McLoughlin and Jimeno attend a barbecue with their families: McLoughlin's wife Donna, Jimeno's wife Allison, daughter Bianca, and their newest addition Olivia.  The epilogue states that John and Will were two of the 20 people pulled out alive and are now retired from active duty. Dave Karnes re-enlisted in the Marines.  
Wristcutters: A Love Story
 After Zia takes his own life, he finds himself in an afterlife limbo much the same as life, just slightly worse. Here the color is dim, there are no stars, and no one can smile. This strange realm is populated by people who have died by suicide, such as Eugene, a Russian musician who lives with his mother, father, and brother – all suicide victims. Together they waste most of their afterlives in bars, until Zia learns from a friend, Brian, that his ex-girlfriend, Desiree, has also taken her own life. He and Eugene take to the road to find her, in Eugene's rundown car. Early on, it is revealed that Eugene's car has two idiosyncrasies: a sort of black hole underneath the passenger seat where items that are dropped disappear forever and broken headlights that cannot be fixed by even the most adept of mechanics. On their trip, they pick up hitchhiker Mikal, who insists there has been a mistake, and is seeking the "people in charge" (a.k.a. the PIC) in order to be sent back.  After a few adventures across the country, as the trio journey along a desolate highway, Mikal pushes a button, miraculously activating the broken headlights on Eugene's car. Shortly thereafter, they come upon a man lying in the middle of the dark highway, forcing them to veer off the road in order to avoid hitting him and wrecking the car in the process.  They discover the man, Kneller, an eccentric commune leader, had fallen asleep while looking for his dog. Kneller invites them back to his camp, where they quickly discover that minor "miracles" occur, as long as the campers remain apathetic about the result. The group stays with the camp longer than intended, and Zia begins to obsess over the miracles and his inability to perform them. When contrasting this to Mikal's obsession with the people in charge, she reveals that her death was an accidental overdose. Eugene meets a young woman, Nanuk, whom he romances. Just as Mikal and Zia discuss their plans to leave Kneller's camp, another camper, Yan, emerges from the woods with news that Kneller's dog has been abducted by a cult leader called "Messiah King". Kneller, Zia, Mikal, and Yan set off in search of King and Kneller's dog.  The group soon find themselves lost and decide to bed down for the night. Unable to sleep, Mikal and Zia discover a nearby ocean shore, where they kiss and spend the night together. In the morning, Kneller discovers them lying among a mass of (presumably used) condoms and needles. The group eventually reach King's camp, where they discover that King is readying himself for a "real" miracle – to separate his soul from his body. As Kneller confronts King, Zia discovers that his Desiree is a devout cult follower, having taken her own life for the purpose of following King into the afterlife.  As King is about to perform public, ritual suicide, Kneller reveals himself to be an undercover agent for the people in charge. King and Desiree are taken away, while Mikal leaves with them, promising Zia that she'll return.

The Year My Parents Went on Vacation
 The story takes place entirely during a few months in 1970, in the city of [[São Paulo]]. Mauro, a 12-year-old boy, is suddenly deprived of the company of his young parents, Bia and Daniel Stein, who are political activists on the run from the harsh [[Military dictatorship (Brazil)|military government]], which was strongly repressing [[leftist]]s all over the country. Against this backdrop of fear and political persecution, the country is at the same time bursting with enthusiasm for the coming [[1970 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], to be held in [[Mexico]], the first one to be transmitted live via [[satellite]].  Unable to take care of their only child, the Steins, who live in [[Belo Horizonte]], drive all the way to São Paulo to deliver the boy to his paternal grandfather, Mótel, who is a [[barber]]. To their son, they say they will travel on vacation and promise to return for the World Cup games. Unfortunately, however, the grandfather dies on the same day the boy arrives, and he is left clueless and without support in [[Bom Retiro (São Paulo)|Bom Retiro]], a working-class neighborhood inhabited mainly by [[Jewish]] people, many of whom speak [[Yiddish]], an unknown language to the boy. As his father is Jewish, the close-knit Bom Retiro community rally in support of the child and Shlomo, a solitary elder and religious Jew who was a close neighbor and friend of Mauro's grandfather, assumes the care of Mauro.  Mauro is a [[Football (soccer)|football]] enthusiast and wants to be a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. He gradually mixes in with other neighborhood children and becomes acquainted with a number of colorful characters, including Hanna, a girl his age; Ítalo, a politically active student from the [[Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo]]; Irene, a beautiful female bartender and her boyfriend, the [[mulatto]] ace goalkeeper of one of the local football teams; the local [[rabbi]] and assorted Jewish elders, [[Italian people|Italian]] [[immigrant]]s, and so on.  To Mauro's great disappointment, his parents neither appear as promised at the World Cup nor give any notice. Fearing the worst, Shlomo starts to investigate by himself and is arrested by the political police because of his meddling. Finally, he achieves the liberation of Mauro's mother, who is severely ill after the prison term. Her reunion with her child happens in the very same day of Brazil's final victory at the World Cup. (Mauro's father disappears while in the dictatorship's clutches, never to return.)  At the end of the film, Mauro says farewell to his recent friends and playmates as he and his mother leave Bom Retiro and prepare to go into exile.  
The Yacoubian Building (film)
  The film opens with a luff tracing the building's history, as wealthy expatriate and Egyptian residents give way, after the 1952 coup that overthrew [[Farouk I of Egypt|King Farouk]] and eventually resulted in the installation of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] as [[President of Egypt]], to new families, and as the rooftop storage rooms are converted into living space for lower-class families.   The rooftop community, effectively a [[slum]] neighborhood, is symbolic of the [[urbanization]] of Egypt and of the burgeoning population growth in its large cities in recent decades, especially among the poor and working classes.  In the faded apartments of the main floors and on the building's teeming roof, the films's principal characters are introduced: *'''Zaki Pasha el Dessouki''' ([[Adel Emam]]) &ndash; a wealthy and elderly foreign-educated engineer who spends most of his time pursuing women and who maintains an office in the Yacoubian, he personifies the ruling class prior to the Revolution: cosmopolitan, cultured, western in outlook, and not particularly observant of Islam *'''Taha el Shazli''' ([[Mohamed Imam]]) &ndash; the son of the building doorman, he excelled in school and hoped to be admitted to the Police Academy but found that his father's profession, considered too lowly by the generals conducting his character interview, was an obstacle to admission; disaffected, he enrolls at the University and eventually joins a militant [[Islamist]] organization modeled upon the [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Jamaa Islamya]] *'''Buthayna el Sayed''' ([[Hend Sabry]]) &ndash; initially Taha's childhood sweetheart, she is forced to find a job to help support her family after her father dies and is disillusioned to find that her male employer expects sexual favors from her and her female coworkers in exchange for additional money and gifts on the side, and that her mother expects her to preserve her virginity while not refusing her boss's sexual advances outright; embittered, she eventually comes to use her beauty as a tool to advance her own interests but finds herself falling in love with Zaki Bey el Dessouki, whom she'd been planning with Malak to swindle out of his apartment *'''Malak''' ([[Ahmed Bedeir]]) &ndash; a shirtmaker and petty schemer seeking to open a shop on the Yacoubian's roof and then to insinuate himself into one of the more posh apartments downstairs *'''Hatim Rasheed''' ([[Khaled El Sawy]]) &ndash; the son of an Egyptian father who was a noted legal scholar and a French mother, he is the editor of ''Le Caire'', a French language daily newspaper; more attention is paid to his private life, for he is a fairly open [[homosexual]] in a society which either looks the other way or openly condemns such behavior and inclinations *'''Hagg Muhammad Azzam''' ([[Nour El Sherif]]) &ndash; one of Egypt's wealthiest men and a migrant to Cairo from the countryside, in the space of thirty years he has gone from [[shoeshiner]] to self-made millionaire; he seeks an acceptable and legal outlet for his (temporarily) resurgent libido in a secret, second marriage to an attractive young widow, and also realizes his goal of serving in the People's Assembly (Parliament), but comes face to face with the enormous corruption, graft, and bribery of contemporary Egyptian politics. *'''Christine''' ([[Yousra]]) &ndash; a world-weary [[chanteuse]] who advises Zaki Bey on his love life and whose poignant singing of European songs like "[[La Vie en Rose]]" punctuates the film.  The stories of each of the primary characters are intertwined, at times colliding or converging with one another. Together, they give a biting condemnation of a nation that has squandered its promise and which has been forced to compromise its own principles, resulting in a corrupt and undemocratic political system dominated by a single party (the fictitious "Patriotic Party", a thinly-veiled version of Egypt's [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]]).  The unlikely pairing of the elderly roué and the disillusioned young girl that ends the film provides a closing grace note that can be seen as a ray of hope against the death and unhappiness that has befallen the other characters.

The yellow one developed the ability to think and learn, to the point that it escaped the [[Mossad|institute]] in which it had been created and became a part of society for 18 months. Rather than seeing humans as enemies or a threat to its own survival, it was "making decisions, and observing us and learning." A [[SWAT]] team is sent after Yellow, chasing him through several countries and finally tracking him down in Shanghai.

 Molly ([[Kate Hudson]]) and Carl ([[Matt Dillon]]) are preparing for their wedding day in [[Hawaii]], until Carl's friend Neil ([[Seth Rogen]]) interrupts to say that Randolph Dupree ([[Owen Wilson]]) got lost. They drive off together to pick up Dupree, who appeared to have hitched a ride with a light plane after landing on the wrong island. A day before the wedding, Molly's father, Bob Thompson ([[Michael Douglas]]), who is also CEO of the company that Carl works for, makes a toast with humorous remarks at Carl's expense, foreshadowing a conflict between the two. Later at a pre-celebration at a bar, Carl neglects Dupree to be with Molly. Carl and Dupree later make up on the beach, as Dupree apologizes for laughing at Molly's father's jokes. Carl and Molly get married. When Carl returns to work, at Molly's father's Thompson Land Development, he is surprised to find that Mr. Thompson has promoted him to be in charge of a design he proposed, though it had been altered somewhat.  Mr. Thompson makes absurd requests which proceed to get worse, starting with Thompson's drastic reimagining of Carl's new architecture project and that Carl get a [[vasectomy]] to prevent any future children with his daughter. Before returning home to celebrate his promotion with Molly, Carl stops by the bar, where he finds Neil and Dupree. After Neil leaves, Dupree reveals that he has financial problems, such as being evicted from his home and losing his job and car. Carl and Molly take Dupree into their home, though clearly they are frustrated as he is disruptive and messy. Molly sets up Dupree with a woman at her work, a primary school, who is a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] librarian. Dupree agrees, though Molly is shocked to find them having graphic [[sexual intercourse|sex]] when she comes home from dinner. Romantic candles burn down the front of the living room, and Dupree is kicked out.  Meanwhile, Carl is being continually stressed out from work, though he and Molly find time to go out for dinner. On the way back they find Dupree sitting on a bench in heavy rain with his belongings. Dupree reveals that the librarian had just dumped him. Feeling pity, Molly insists they take him back in. Dupree apologizes for being disruptive and agrees to mend his ways. The next day, Dupree makes amends, refurbishing the living room, and doing Carl's thank-you letters, as well as making friends with kids from the block. Dupree cooks a large dinner for Molly and Carl, though Carl is late again, so Molly and Dupree start without him. When Carl finally shows up, he is a little jealous that they were having dinner together, and have a fight. Carl kicks Dupree out, suspecting an affair, which shocks Dupree. The following night, Mr. Thompson comes over for dinner. Dupree attempts to sneak back in to their home to get some of his belongings, but fails and falls off the roof. He is found outside and is invited in for dinner.  After Mr. Thompson takes a liking to Dupree and asks him to go fishing with him, it enrages Carl because - even though he doesn't like fishing - it's Mr. Thompson's way of approving someone. Carl's fury boils over as he then imagines Dupree hanging out with Mr. Thompson and engaging in sex with Molly, causing Carl to jump across the table and attempting to strangle Dupree; Mr. Thompson hits Carl over the head with a candlestick shortly after. After returning from the hospital with a neck brace, Dupree and Molly confront Mr. Thompson about what he really thinks of his new son-in-law, while Carl had left. The next morning, Dupree gets all the local kids to search for Carl. Dupree eventually finds Carl in the bar, and convinces him to chase after Molly. Dupree helps Carl break into Mr. Thompson's office and confront him while Dupree himself distracts and evades a Samoan guard. Carl and Mr. Thompson finally reach an understanding and Thompson admits to his agenda of insulting Carl. Dupree and Carl return to the house, where Carl and Molly reunite, Carl apologizing, and agree to work it all out. Glad that he did his job, Dupree celebrates by leaping into the air with joy, until he falls to ground.  All turns out well, with Dupree becoming a motivational speaker, Carl and Molly spending more time with each other, and Mr. Thompson accepting Carl as family. In a post-credits scene, famed bicyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] is seen reading Dupree's motivation book, ''7 Different Kinds of Smoke: Living, Loving, and Finding your Inner "-ness"''.  
Yo-Yo Girl Cop
 Twenty years after the events of the original ''Sukeban Deka'', a Japanese girl by the name of "K" (Aya Matsuura) is captured in New York and put on custody after beating 11 policemen. Although held in a straight jacket and a cage, she escapes by dislocating her own shoulder and tries to exit the facility, but a moment of kindness to comfort a lost little girl gets her captured again. K is then informed by Japanese inspector Kazutoshi Kira (Riki Takeuchi) that her mother will be deported to Japan for both brutally beating down a mugger and living in New York with an expired visa, unless K accepts to work for them in the reactivated Sukeban Deka program. After accepting, not without hesitating for being in bad terms with her mother, K is given a hi-tech steel yo-yo weapon and a new name, "Saki Asamiya," and is ordered to infiltrate an elite high school in Japan. The school, named the Seisen Academy, is suspected to be the source of a website called "[[Enola Gay]]", which is rallying juvenile [[suicide bomber]]s across the country. She is also briefed that another Sukeban operative was sent earlier only for her to commit suicide like the juvenile terrorists, and that a counter for 72 hours has just appeared on the website.  Upon arriving the school, Saki learns that the entire school is dominated by a girl named Reika Akiyama (Rika Ishikawa) and her henchwomen, and she immediately saves a bullied student named Taie "Tae" Konno (Yui Okada) from them. Saki looks into the chemistry club, which the former operative was investigating before her death, and is forced to struggle to save two suicide bombers, Amaki and Higashiyama, who try to use Tae as a human shield. Asamiya captures Higashiyama, while Amaki is saved from her bomb by the school janitor Jirou Kimura (Shunsuke Kubozuka), who had become friends with Saki earlier. Kira interrogates Higashiyama and informs Saki that the Enola Gay website is run by a user named Romeo, but Higashiyama is abducted by a gang of thugs, despite Asamiya's efforts to fight them off. Afterwards, Tae tells Saki that he and a fellow bullied schoolgirl named Kotomi Kanda (Erika Miyoshi) used to run together an anti-bullying website until Kanda snapped and tried to commit suicide by bombing, being left catatonic in a hospital and leaving their site to be replaced by the Enola Gay website. Moreover, Reika interrupts them and reveals that Kotomi fell in love with a man who advised her to blow herself up. Going to the hospital, Saki and Tae visit Kotomi, who only says the name of Jirou Kimura. Now revealed to be Romeo, Kimura kidnaps Saki and ties her to a bomb, which she is left to escape from.  Meanwhile, Reika discovers herself as Romeo's lover and hosts an assembly on the school in front of all the students and teachers in order to celebrate his ideology. At the same time, Romeo and his gang are capitalizing on the event to rob a bank in Tokyo. Tae is brought to the room and strapped to another bomb, but after some dramatic exchanges she is saved by the returning Saki. The girl chases Reika, who still has Tae as her hostage and attempts to reunite with Romeo, and ends up facing her in a singles duel. It's then revealed that Reika is a former operative of Tokumei Keiji, a police program similar to Sukeban Deka, and that she has her own armed yo-yo, which sports blades. They have a duel, and although the less experienced Asamiya is initially overpowered when trying to user her weapon, she defeats Reika by burying her under metal pipes. Saki then confronts Romeo and his gang, who have seized Tae, Amaki and Higashiyama as bomb-strapped hostages, and manages to take the villains out thanks to a bulletproof uniform. Eventually Romeo, who wears a bomb strap as well, disables her yo-yo by slicing the string with his [[katana]], but she still knocks him out. Saki takes the artifacts off the hostages but leaves Romeo's to explode, killing him.  Later, Saki calls her mom (Yuki Saito), who is revealed to be the first ever Saki Asamiya. Kira then informs he has got another job for her, and she bids farewell to Tae and Kotomi before leaving the school.  
You Are the One (film)
 Cute and bubbly Sally Malasmas ([[Toni Gonzaga]]) reluctantly agrees to process her application for a visa, obeying her parent's wish that their small family be reunited. The rest of her family: mom, dad and older sister, Charry ([[Jodi Santamaria|Jodi Sta. Maria]]) are already residing states-side and they worry that she is lonely living in the Philippines by herself; but as far as Sally is concerned, her simple Philippine life surrounded by loyal, loving friends and co-workers is nearly perfect. However, during  the interview process for her Visa application, things goes awry and her application gets abruptly denied by the handsome, yet dismissive American consul, Will Derby ([[Sam Milby]]).  The next day, a bewildered Will wakes from a one-night stand with a girl he picked up from a bar the night before and due to the notorious Manila gridlock, he misses work. He finds himself instead diverted to the Census Bureau where Sally incidentally works. Seeing an opportunity for revenge, Sally buries Will's inquiry form beneath an already mounting pile of paperwork. As she expected, Will waits all day for his turn through sweltering heat and hunger until he gets fed up and finally confronts the scheming Sally. She gives him a dose of his own medicine and nonchallantly brushes him off, informing him that his form cannot be processed properly because it is incomplete and that he must return the next day since its time for her to go home.  An outraged Will cries foul to Sally's supervisor, who sides with him. Thus, in order to redeem the bureau's reputation, Sally is ordered to stay behind after hours until Will finds the information he needs.  As it turns out, Will's cold and sullen demeanor is due to him agonizing over the search for his birth parents and any remaining family members he may still have in the Philippines; but more importantly, the reason why he was given up for adoption, a question that has been gnawing at him for years.  Sympathizing with Will's plight, Sally takes it upon herself to help him find what he's looking for and through this common purpose the pair bonds and grows closer.  But it seems that each has a different idea of exactly what their new-found friendship means to the other. Will's casual relationships with women conflicts with Sally's more traditional, old-fashioned virtues. Together, they must set aside differences, overcome clashing cultural prejudices and ethnocentric beliefs; otherwise, unsettled issues may put a stopper to their blossoming romance before they get the chance to realize its full potential.

Yeti: A Love Story
  The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, [[New Hampshire]]. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil [[cult]] that worships a [[yeti]] that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the [[Himalayas]] and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically.  Five college students—[[fraternity]] brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called "Tentacle Boy" and displays it as a [[sideshow]], informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods.  Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a "Chosen One" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission.  Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location. Only Adam and Emily follow the redneck; Sally is sent back to their campsite, while Dick had left earlier, having met Debra.  As the sun goes down, the redneck brings Adam and Emily to the place where the cult reside before leaving. They spot Dick, but not as a sacrifice for the yeti; he′s standing off to the side with Debra, watching on as another young man is offered up to the yeti instead. The yeti appears and brutally rapes the young man, and once he′s finished, he makes off with Adam. Emily cannot kill the yeti because of this. Raymond, who had watched the yeti take Adam, is concerned about the yeti′s recent actions, but assures himself that he will return tomorrow night. Dick, still disturbed by the ritual, is assured by Debra that he′s not going to be a sacrifice, and that despite what he′d witnessed, the yeti is very gentle and will not hurt Adam.  Adam, meanwhile, is taken deep into the woods by the yeti. Adam becomes attracted to the yeti and the two proceed to have [[sexual intercourse]]. Not only do the yeti and Adam become lovers, but Sally and Emily, who have had their boyfriends run off, become a couple, while Dick and Debra become smitten with each other as well.  In spite of the new romances, the cult is still causing trouble. The priest that sent Emily on her mission reveals to her that Raymond was once a disciple of his. While traveling through [[Nepal]], the two had come across a monk who taught them about the legend of the yeti, who could be summoned by a magic [[gong]], which had been on display in a museum in Hong Kong. A special scroll called "The Book of the Yeti" was entrusted into the care of Raymond and the priest, but Raymond had become obsessed with the legend. He and the priest then stole the gong and found the yeti in a sideshow (the old man's sideshow). Raymond used the gong to free the yeti and, with the gong, the scroll, and control over the yeti, went on to found the cult.  The priest then reveals to Emily a special part of the prophecy that states that the yeti can be freed from the gong only through the power of love given by a "[[Sodomy|Sodomite]]," who turns out to be Adam. Upon leaving the priest, Sally and Emily go to the police, which proves to be of little help. A frustrated Emily storms off to the bathroom; Sally goes to comfort her. As the two agree to take down the cult by themselves, Sex Piss, a sex-obsessed man who tried to flirt with the girls and then physically assaulted Adam, Joe, and Dick when they first came to town, corners them with the intention to [[fingering (sexual act)|finger]] them. A fight breaks out that results in Sally's death, though Sex Piss doesn't die despite multiple wounds. Emily has to flee and find Adam and the yeti. Back at the church, the priest is confronted and killed by Raymond.  Back with the cult, Raymond confides with Debra that the gong isn't working on the yeti at all and he is worried that he is losing control over the beast. He also notes that Debra has been acting different since she's found Dick. Raymond orders Debra to find and place the yeti under their control once again, or face death. She manages to find Adam and the yeti, but they are in a moment of intimacy when she finds them. She goes back to Raymond and lies to him, claiming that the yeti is still under his control.  Debra then betrays Dick to the cult and he becomes the evening's intended sacrifice for the yeti. The gong is rung, the yeti appears, but instead of raping Dick, the yeti releases him. Adam and Emily show up, as do the old man and Tentacle Boy, who are in disguise as cult members and are here to reclaim the yeti. In the fight that ensues, several are killed, among them Raymond, Debra (killed by Dick), Tentacle Boy, and the yeti. Adam mourns the loss of his lover. Emily and Dick mourn their respective lovers as well.  So it seems that with Adam's yeti dead, the whole yeti species are extinct for good…or are they? Adam drops a hint that he is now pregnant with the yeti's child.  
Yonna in the Solitary Fortress
 Caution, '''this section contains spoilers''' if you have not seen the film yet.   As a young girl, Yonna and her older brother Stan were orphaned.  When it was discovered that they possessed magical abilities, the villagers believed them to be cursed and they were persecuted and ostracized, eventually even exiled.  A few years later, Stan has grown grim but still watches over Yonna.  They now live alone in an isolated old fortress where there are no neighbors to cast stones at them.  However, a government organization known only as "the Monarchy" is at odds with another organization known as "the Syndicate" and they both wish to capture the two magicians and use their powers to promote their own respective agendas.  Nobody from the Syndicate appears in this film, but the Monarchy sends two agents under separate sets of instructions to try to take Yonna back to their headquarters.  These orders put Piggot and Galda at odds with Stan, who will kill any intruders in his rage-fueled attempts to keep Yonna safe.  Piggot tries to be clever and talk sense into Stan before approaching Yonna, while Galda takes a more direct approach and confronts Yonna.  To his surprise, Yonna says she wants to stay in the tower, it is her choice because of the way people have treated her in the past.  Even so, she has mixed feelings about her brother because he gets homicidally over-protective of her.  But in the end, Galda plays the hero by giving Yonna her freedom instead of bringing her back to Monarchy HQ.<ref>http://www.crunchyroll.com/yonna-in-the-solitary-fortress/episode-1-yonna-in-the-solitary-fortress-505646</ref>  
Zodiac: The Race Begins
 The great [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] gave the eminent [[Jade Emperor]] the task of ruling the celestial and mortal worlds. However, mortal [[human|human beings]] did not have an awareness of time, which spelt calamity.  To avert this, the Jade Emperor gave a celestial order: "Let it be known in the mortal world, that I, the Imperial Jade Emperor, shall appoint 12 animals to ascend to the celestial world. These 12 species of animals shall represent a cycle of 12 years with each animal representing a year. Any humans born in a particular animal's year shall bear that animal's mark and his strength. This representation shall be known as the Zodiac."  But deep in the dark swamps, the thousand-year-old tree spirit, determined to thwart the plans of her long-time enemy, the Jade Emperor, sets forth to prevent the success of the Race by impeding the 12 chosen ones.  
The Zombie Diaries
 Soldiers of the British army clear a small collection of farmhouses with two scientists who take a tissue sample from a deceased civilian who appears to have been reanimated, then shot.  The film's first chapter, "The Outbreak", begins in the city of London, emphasizing both the dismissive and paranoid reactions of the population to an unspecified disease outbreak that is gradually making its way to Britain. The film then moves to footage of a documentary crew's travel to the countryside, where, in the process of filming material related to the virus, the characters encounter the zombie outbreak firsthand.  The story of these four individuals is revisited in the second half of the movie. The second chapter, "The Scavengers", takes place one month later.  Two men (one of whom is American) and one woman travel around in a small car armed only with a rifle, in search of food and radio parts.  The final chapter, "The Survivors", tells the story of a larger group of uninfected people who have set up camp on a farm.  They divide their time doing reconnaissance of surrounding areas, holding off the endless stream of incoming zombies, and bickering amongst themselves.  In the opening scene of the chapter, the audience watches as "the survivors" calmly execute the approaching infected.  By the conclusion, in which the film goes back in time to the first nights of the documentary crew at the beginning of the first diary ("The Outbreak"), the word "survivors" becomes an ironic title, as all but one are killed by two uninfected psychopaths.  Both of the murderers also survive, one having disappeared after helping slaughter the film crew and the other kills off the "survivors".  
Yuga (film)
 The story is about a scientist who stays at Kollimalai Hills to find ways and means to tackle the rocks that are to fall from moon and destroy the earth. The problems that he encounters in his mission forms the crux. It is a convoluted story that makes you to leave reasoning and logic in cold storage.  Narendran ([[Nassar]]) as usual, is good at his role. [[Swarnamalya]] gets an opportunity to show her acting talent. Unfortunately Rishi ([[Richard Rishi]]), who had a good outing in [[Naalai]], recently just plays a second fiddle. Charuhaasan has nothing much to do.  The movie begins with Professor Narendran, who finds out that rocks from lunar craters would fall on earth and destroy the world soon. Narendran and his assistant Swarnamalya choose to keep it as a secret and decide not to create panic in the earth. They are joined by a group of students which include Rishi and '[[Boys (2003 film)|Boys]]' Manikandan in accomplishing their mission. They come across a different problem. Swarnamalya's father ([[Charuhasan]]), led by a group of men forms a cult. They decide to die and plan to take revenge on the humans for polluting the world. Narendran and his team come to know of their plans. The rest is how they tackle both the problems.

Zoom (2006 film)
   Decades prior to the start of the film, the Zenith team are five young superheroes who fought to protect the world from evil, led by Jack Shepard, a.k.a. "Captain Zoom", who possessed super-speed, and his older brother, Connor Shepard, a.k.a. "Concussion", who could project sonic blasts. The American military sought to enhance the team's powers using an experimental form of radiation called "Gamma-13". This made Zoom faster and stronger, but it also turned Concussion evil. Thinking Zoom and the team betrayed him, Concussion went insane and killed his teammates Marksman, Ace, and Daravia. Concussion was believed to have been destroyed by Zoom at the cost of his powers, but was sent into another [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimension]] instead.  Thirty years later, Dr. Ed Grant, the scientist behind the original Zenith Project, discovers that Concussion is making his way back into their dimension. General Larraby, the military officer in charge of the Project, decides to form a new Zenith Team to fight him. Jack finds himself dragged back into the Project, this time as an instructor. He is told that a new team is needed to battle a great menace but is not told what it is. He is also told that if natural training does not prepare the new team in time, they will be exposed to Gamma-13. In their secret base, Area 52 (a reference to [[Area 51]]), he meets Marsha Holloway, who is a beautiful but clumsy psychologist, a big fan of Zoom's, and knows of him only through the comic book adaptations of the team's adventures.  The project holds an audition of would-be members, most of whom possess useless or disgusting powers. In the end, four are selected: Dylan West, a seventeen-year-old boy possessing invisibility, Summer Jones, a sixteen-year-old girl with telekinetic powers and empathic senses, Tucker Williams, a twelve-year-old boy who can enlarge and inflate himself at will and Cindy Collins, a six-year-old girl with super strength. All of them are shown as having problems adapting to normal life because of their powers. At first things do not go well, with Jack being bitter about the past, and his sarcastic attitude disappoints Marsha. Dylan keeps trying to escape, Tucker has self-esteem problems and trouble controlling his powers, and the kids are annoyed by Jack's attitude. The team eventually forces Jack to face the fact that he's not really putting his heart into their training. Slowly things begin to come together, as the new team's abilities improve, they adopt superhero identities.  Eventually, just as Concussion is about to arrive on Earth, it is discovered that Dylan also possesses a kind of [[clairsentience]], also known as mind sight, a rare power exhibited by a team leader that allows him to discover not Concussion's location and the project's true purpose. The team is meant merely as a distraction from the military's plans to capture Concussion in a special net that will cause his concussive blasts to reflect on himself, neutralizing him. Marsha also reveals that she secretly possesses a form of super breath, which appears as sparkly, rainbow-colored wind. She uses this to aid the team in their escape, when the military is about to transfer them to the Gamma-13 chamber for artificial power enhancement. Using the malfunctioning flying saucer stored in the base, which they repair on the way, Jack escapes with the team, including Marsha. He is dropped off at a point in a desert where Concussion will arrive, planning to try to talk to him. Jack tells the team to avoid, but they refuse.  When Concussion arrives, he refuses to listen to reason and attacks his brother with concussive blasts, while the rest of the team takes him on. Larraby orders the net to be fired, but Concussion blasts it away, and it almost lands on Cindy. This causes Jack to regain his powers, and he saves her. He then runs back to the base, puts on a new costume, and returns. Working together, the team (plus Marsha) guide Concussion into a vortex that Zoom creates by running around in a circle at super-speed in the opposite direction as before. Dr. Grant yells to Zoom that if he closes the vortex, they can save Concussion. The vortex ultimately removes the Gamma-13 from Connor and restores his powers to normal, thus turning him good again. Zoom and Concussion are reunited.  Three months later, Dylan is dating Summer, who is on the cheerleading team, using her telekinetic power to help build the pyramid. Tucker is the goalie on the soccer team, and Cindy is in a school play of ''[[Rapunzel]]'', using her strength to pull the "prince" up the tower. In addition they still work together with Zoom as the new Zenith Team.  
Zzyzx (film)
  Two friends are driving to Las Vegas for the weekend, and one of the men, Lou (Johnson) who is driving, asks his friend Ryan (Fox) if one could get away with killing someone in the middle of nowhere. As they explore [[Zzyzx, California|Zzyzx Road]], Lou teases Ryan by almost hitting a pedestrian. As Ryan complains about Lou's behavior, Lou doubles back and sets a crash course for the man that they saw on the road.

Lou used to be in the Army, after going to Iraq and coming back, Ryan said he was never the same. Lou consistently derides Ryan, and calls him Mitch because it rhymes with bitch. Ryan is found to be a very introverted person. Lou and Ryan keep an eye on Candice to make sure that she does not find out they killed her husband.  They eventually get drunk and they all take narcotics. Eventually Candice and Lou end up making out, while Ryan tries to pull Candice off of Lou. Lou storms out of the trailer after this, as he knows that Candice knows what happened. He throws the keys to the Winnebago into the desert. Candice finds the key to the car that Ryan and Lou drove into the desert, and she tries to steal the car. Much to her dismay, the car does not start. Lou tries to coax her out of the car, but he ends up getting stabbed in his cheek by Candice.  Ryan, thinking that Lou is to blame for the murder, helps Candice start the car. After Ryan fixes the car, Candice drives off while Ryan is still on the hood of the car, instead of driving off with him. Ryan, in retaliation, disables the car by ripping out some wires.  In the end, Ryan beats Lou to death with a golf club. He then proceeds to free Candice, and Candice offers to have sex with him in exchange. Afterward Candice gouges out Ryan's eyes, and sets him on fire. She finds her husband's body and cuts his leg off, revealing that he had $100,000 hidden in a prosthetic leg. Candice walks off into the distance with the leg, after betraying all those around her.
