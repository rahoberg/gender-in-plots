4 Days in May
 It is one of the last days before the capitulation of the German Army in May 1945. The setting is the Baltic coast in [[Pomerania]]. A unit of the Soviet army, comprising seven men and led by a captain nicknamed "Gorynych" ("dragon") (Alexei Guskov) by his companions, has left for reconnaissance and observation of the movements of the retreating Germans. The group is housed in a large building, a shelter for orphaned girls. A German Army [[Wehrmacht]] detachment is situated close by, awaiting transport for evacuation by sea to [[Denmark]], where they plan to surrender to the British. Both parties understand that the war is almost over; they do not want to engage each other and choose to wait things out. But resistance is not over for a teenage orphan Peter (Paul Wenzel), who was indoctrinated in the "no surrender" tradition of [[National Socialism]]. Soviet intelligence officers disarm him and patiently try to neutralize his youthful aggression.  On May 8, 1945, [[Victory in Europe Day]], a Soviet major who is commander of the division that includes the reconnaissance unit, arrives with Red Army troops. He was drunk on the occasion of Germany's capitulation. The major tries to rape one of the German girls, but the captain disarms him and stops the attempt.  Wishing to eliminate witnesses of his indecent behavior, the major said that the enemy, in disguise, infiltrated the building, and began an assault by his unit. The German detachment did not surrender but came to rescue the children. Then they made provisions for the safe withdrawal of the orphans on a fishing launch to Denmark.  
7 Khoon Maaf
  ===Prologue—Prem Pujari=== ''7 Khoon Maaf'' tells the story of an [[Anglo-Indian]] woman, Susanna Anna-Marie Johannes ([[Priyanka Chopra]]), who murders all her husbands. Susanna tries to find love, but six of her seven husbands have a flaw which proves fatal. The killings (and her yearning for love) are explained by the loss of her mother at a young age. The story is told by a young forensic pathologist, Arun ([[Vivaan Shah]]), to his wife, Nandini ([[Konkona Sen Sharma]]). Arun has watched Susanna since their childhood, and has a secret crush on her. He owes his life to her; she funded his education, making him what he is today. Arun tells his wife that Susanna has committed suicide, leaving him a note congratulating him on his marriage. The doctor must now confirm that the body found is Susanna's. Arun is unable to overcome his grief over her death and pours out his heart to his wife, who listens patiently.<ref></ref>  ===Adamkhor Major=== Susanna's ([[Priyanka Chopra]]) first husband—Edwin Rodriques ([[Neil Nitin Mukesh]]), an army major—is overbearing, jealous and possessive. Disabled, he cannot believe that a beautiful woman like Susanna would be faithful to him. Uncertain of his sexual potency, he takes out his anger on his wife. Although Susanna endures his mental cruelty, she cannot forgive Edwin for blinding her faithful, mute [[Groom (profession)|stableboy]] (Shashi Malviya) with a whip. Edwin is eliminated during a panther-hunting trip with the help of Susanna's faithful maid ([[Usha Uthup]]), butler (Harish Khanna) and the mute stableboy.  ===Ek Duje Ke Liye=== Susanna's second husband—Jamshed Singh Rathod ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), who renames himself Jimmy Stetson after their marriage—is a singer whose flaw is pride. The marriage begins well, but Jimmy becomes successful and misuses his new-found fame. He steals songs, dallies with other women and becomes dependent on drugs. Susanna wants to be lucky in love the second time; she tries to wean him from his addiction, but he continues in secret. She gives up, disposing of him with a heroin overdose. Police investigators find footprints near his body indicating that a person with six toes is the murderer.  ===Musafir Hoon Yaaron=== Susanna's third husband—Wasiullah Khan (also known as Musafir) ([[Irrfan Khan]])—is a soft-spoken, thoughtful poet by day and a [[sado-masochist]] by night. Susanna tries to cover her bruises with makeup; her servants cannot bear to see her mistreated, and advise her to get rid of him. Khan is ultimately interred in a snowy Kashmiri grave.  ===Amar Prem=== Her fourth husband, Nikolai Vronsky (Aleksandr Dyachenko), is a Russian spy leading a double life. When Susanna discovers he has another wife and family, her rage knows no bounds and he meets his end with the aid of Susanna's pet snakes. After Vronsky's death, Susanna no longer agonizes over eliminating anyone of whom she disapproves.  ===Pyaar Ki Keemat=== Her fifth husband, Keemat Lal ([[Annu Kapoor]]), is a police inspector who has shielded his "Madame" from prosecution for two murders in exchange for marriage. With a voracious appetite for sex, his dependence on [[Sildenafil|Viagra]] proves his undoing; one fateful night, Susanna mixes an overdose of the drug into Lal's drink.  ===Mushroom Da=== Modhusudhon Tarafdar ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) is a Bengali doctor who rescues Susanna from a suicide attempt (when she learns about Arun's marriage) and puts her on a mushroom-only diet. Although she does not want to marry him, Tarafdar persuades her with a promise that she will be the sole heir of his property. Actually bankrupt, he tries to poison Susanna with mushroom soup several years later for her inheritance. Her butler drinks it by accident and dies instead; in a state of shock, she shoots Tarafdar during a game of [[Russian roulette]]. That night, Susanna sets her house ablaze in another suicide attempt. Seeing the house on fire, her maid (who has six toes) tries to rescue her but dies in the attempt.  ===Epilogue—The seventh husband=== In the forensics laboratory, Arun discovers that the body is not Susanna's; however, he declares Susanna dead in his reports. He looks for her; when he finds Susanna, she tells him she is finally getting married the next day to someone who accepts her, knowing all her sins. In an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] she imagines [[Jesus Christ]] as her seventh husband, full of love and never hurtful; she becomes a nun and finding the love she sought all her life. Arun and Nandini return home after he tells her that Susanna is dead.  
7aum Arivu
 [[Bodhidharma]] ([[Suriya (actor)|Suriya]]), a master of martial arts and medical remedies, is the son of a great Tamil king of the [[Pallava dynasty]]. He is sent to China by his [[guru]], who requests him to stop the spread of a pandemic disease existing there from spreading to India. Initially the people in China treat him as an inferior, but later, when he cures a little girl from the deadly disease and fights against some people who ill-treated villagers there, the people of China began to respect and worship him. He begins to teach them how to cure many diseases, the skills of hypnotism, and the physical training of the [[Shaolin monks]] that led to the creation of [[Shaolinquan]]. However, after several years, when he expresses his desire to return to India, the villagers plot to poison him and bury him near the temple, believing that their place would be disease free if he is buried there. Bodhidharma agrees to die and subsequently becomes a fundamental figure in Chinese history, affectionately being dubbed as "Damo".  In modern-day China, Dong Lee ([[Johnny Tri Nguyen]]) is given the task of starting a government-planned biological war against India, known as Operation Red. Dong Lee arrives in [[Chennai]] and starts this operation by injecting a virus into a street dog. This disease was the one which occurred during the time of Bodhidharma in China. Meanwhile, Subha Srinivasan ([[Shruti Haasan]]), a [[genetics]] student researches that Bodhidharma can be brought back to life if his sample of [[DNA]] is matched with another sample of DNA which she finds in Aravind (Suriya), a descendant of Bodhidharma who is working as a circus artist nearby. Dong Lee finds out Subha's mission to revive Bodhidharma and plans to kill her first so that the disease cannot be stopped.  Subha approaches Aravind but begins to love and spend time with him, thereby forgetting about her mission. One day, Aravind's family sees Subha and clearly remember that she visited them a year before to find Aravind and know all about him for the Bodhidharma research. Saving herself, she lies by saying that she does not know them. Later that night, Aravind's uncle ([[Ilavarasu]]) explains all what happened one year before when they met Subha. Aravind goes and meets Subha, and is enraged upon realizing the truth. However the next day, he reconciles with Subha in a love failure mood and agrees to contribute to the research and hence save the country. The research begins of giving life to Bodhidharma and to end Operation Red. But Dong Lee, who is capable of doing anything, does all impossibly bad things, mastered in "Nokku Varmam" (hypnotism), a [[martial art]] which was actually taught to the Chinese by Bodhidharma.  Subha goes to her genetics department and announces that Operation Red can be stopped if they read and make use of the cures in a book written by Bodhidharma. However, the department laughs and refuses to believe her, claiming that an ancient book is of no use in modern times, much to her dismay. After some time, Subha and Aravind learn that Subha's professor from the genetics department is assisting Dong Lee in Operation Red. They sneak into the professor's apartment and learn about the operation. The next day, the professor is caught red-handed by Aravind, Subha, and her friends, but surrenders and explains that he received a huge sum of money from the China government if he carried out Operation Red. After the professor gives the gang more details about Operation Red and how to stop it, they leave. However, after a while, Dong Lee arrives and the professor once again teams up with him to save his own life.  Dong Lee causes numerous havoc in the city, which Subha, Aravind, and their gang barely escape. They finally locate a research center where they can activate Bodhidharma's DNA in Aravind and decide to hide there for a few days. They all deactivate their phones so nobody can trace them. But Dong Lee somehow traces Subha and the gang with the help of two of Subha's outside friends. However, he kills both of them afterwards. Dong Lee then locates the place of the research center. Subha and her friends in the research center escape in a van, but Dong Lee chases them and the van collapses. An unconscious Aravind gets beaten badly by Dong Lee at first, but then gains Bodhidharma's skills and kills Dong Lee. Aravind uses an ancient medicine to cure the disease. Subha and Aravind then get married and finally tell the press about the importance of our history.

 The film starts with a dream sequence depicting Sarah and David Crone being trapped and ultimately dying in their burning home at 11:11.  Joseph Crone wakes in his hotel room on November 7, 2011 at 11:11AM.  His manager, Grant, arrives and urges Joseph to write his next novel after telling him that his previous book sold over 5 million copies.  Joseph begins writing about how after his wife and son died, he lost all faith in a higher power and [[God]], and writes ''[[God is dead]], or maybe he was never alive.''  On November 8, 2011, Joseph attends his [[support group]] meeting where Sadie is telling her story.  Outside, Sadie tells Joseph that he should speak up, calling him good with words.  As Joseph departs, Sadie gives him a notebook.  Joseph is then immediately in a car accident.  At the hospital, he has an MRI Scan and the doctors reveal to him that he is perfectly healthy and uninjured while the other driver was killed in the crash.  Joseph tells Sadie that he feels that he has no purpose and prays for God to kill him every day.  He then examines his watch and sees that it stopped exactly at 11:11.  That night, Joseph gets a call from his estranged brother, Samuel, who is living in Spain with their father, Richard.  Samuel tells Joseph that their father is dying.  On November 9, 2011, Joseph goes to [[Barcelona]], Spain, to visit his father.  There, Joseph meets with Samuel, who uses a wheelchair. Samuel urges Joseph to put aside his hatred for the Church and asks Joseph to stay the night. Later Samuel tells Joseph that his congregation dwindled away, and asks him to try to get some of his fans to follow his church.  In Samuel's study, the local housekeeper Ana demands that Samuel show Joseph the ''video de los demonios''.  Ana shows Joseph a security video taken on November 3 that depicts the faint outline of what appears to be a demon at 11:11PM.  Joseph tells Samuel that he's been seeing the number 11-11 frequently in the past few days.  Joseph then goes to talk to Ana and finds a diary, only titled ''El Libro de Ana''.  When confronted about it, Ana tells Joseph that it's the gospel according to her.  That night, Joseph reads that people who frequently see the number 11-11 have been "Activated".  Joseph then saves Samuel, who is being strangled by demon-like creatures.  On November 10, 2011, at a meeting of Samuel's congregation, a man named Javier brandishes a gun at Samuel, dropping a camera in the process. Joseph disarms Javier, who runs off.  Joseph and Samuel then visit the cemetery where their mother, Lauren, is buried.  Joseph points out that Samuel's birthday and Lauren's death both took place on November 11.  Joseph tells Samuel that the attack the night before, Joseph's accident, David's death, and the apparitions all occurred at 11:11 on the clock.  Samuel urges Joseph to not look for meaning where there is none.  Joseph then goes to find a shop to develop the photos on Javier's camera, and they tell Joseph that the photos will be developed the next day. Joseph goes to an Occult Book Shop where the keeper reads a passage from a book, detailing that on November 11, 2011, a sacrifice will be made that will ''destroy faith and the Serpent will rise''.  Joseph becomes convinced that Samuel is a prophet to save the church and that on November 11, 2011, at 11:11, Samuel will be sacrificed by these demons for the [[devil]] to rise.  On November 11, 2011, Joseph finds that Sadie has arrived in Barcelona.  Joseph and Sadie are cornered in a maze by Javier, who brandishes the gun at Joseph before fleeing.  When Joseph and Sadie return to the house, they find that Richard has died. Joseph breaks into Javier's home, and finds Samuel's photos in a diary with the word ''SACRIFICIO'' scrawled on its pages, along with ''11-11-11''. Javier finds Joseph and shoots him.  Joseph comes to that night, calls Sadie, and tells her to get the photos that were developed as he runs back to the house.  He finds Samuel, who urges Joseph to save the notebooks that chronicle the church's history. Joseph and Samuel, with the notebooks, are cornered by the demonic beings in the house, and they take Samuel at 11:02PM.  Joseph attempts to find and rescue Samuel as Sadie gets the photos.  Joseph finds Samuel, suspended in the air, surrounded by the beings.  A sinkhole opens, causing Joseph to fall away from rescue. Joseph manages to crawl out of the sinkhole as one of the creatures readies a blade to stab Samuel. Joseph steps in the path of the blade exactly at 11:11, and the beings disappear.  Sadie, looking through the photos, burns them all. Joseph and Samuel lie out in the rain as Joseph begins to die. Samuel tells Joseph that 11-11 was not a window opening, but one closing, and that the end of the world could only be stopped then. Joseph finds the notebooks and reads one that Samuel wrote, depicting his own death.  Samuel stands, collects the notebooks, and leaves Joseph to die after revealing that the beings were, in fact, [[angel]]s and that ''he'' was the devil that needed to be stopped. A new religion will start, and Joseph's, Samuel's, Sadie's, Grant's, and Ana's books will become the new gospels.  Some time later, a large church is filled with Samuel's followers, each bearing a book titled ''The Book of Joseph''.

That night, Adam stays at Kyle's and finds a book entitled 'Facing Cancer Together' from their first trip to a bookstore where Kyle picked up the shop clerk—filled with notes, highlighted paragraphs and turned-down pages, proving that Kyle sincerely cares and has been simply continuing to treat Adam the same since his diagnosis.  The next day, Kyle drops Adam off, who embraces Kyle for being a good friend and apologizes for the previous night. After Adam says his farewells to family, he undergoes the surgery.

When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis assault him and knock him unconscious.  When Nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso, with both a timer and a cellular phone-activated trigger. Dwayne and Travis tell him his situation: the bomb will detonate unless he robs a bank within 10 hours. They also threaten to detonate the bomb if Nick notifies the police. He goes to Chet's school job and alerts him of the situation, to which he reluctantly accepts. En route to the bank, Nick manages to quit his job and then goes to see Kate for the last time. Nick and Chet hold up the bank and obtain money while the bank manager pulls the alarm, forcing Nick and Chet to flee quickly. Dwayne says he and Travis will meet Nick at an abandoned rail yard to make the exchange. Dwayne and Travis go to a restaurant instead as Dwayne calls up Juicy to get her hit-man ally and to head to the rail yard. Juicy and the hit man Chango ([[Michael Peña]]) arrive to pick up the money. Nick hands Chango the money and expects Chango to give him the code which will deactivate the bomb. However, Chet appears and strikes Chango with a metal bar while Nick incapacitates Juicy. The two grab the money and escape.  Overly frustrated by the turn of events and when Nick refuses to answer the phone again, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but Travis alters the numbers. Rethinking their plan, he and Dwayne head to Kate's apartment in their masks and kidnap her. Chango breaks into the Major's house to find information regarding Dwayne's location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. While there, the Major attacks him with a pen gun. The Major is then shot by Chango after a struggle. Upon applying some peroxide, Chango uses the information he found in Dwayne's room to head to the scrapyard. Dwayne threatens to kill Kate unless Nick meets up with him at the scrapyard.   At the scrapyard, Dwayne gives Nick the code 69 69 69 to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with just minutes to spare. Dwayne has them at gunpoint but Nick has Chet fake having a sniper on them by pointing with his laser pointer. After believing him, Dwayne and Travis drop their weapons and leave with the money. However, Nick is knocked out by Chango who now has Dwayne at gunpoint, demanding the money. Dwayne gives him the money but Chango decides to still kill him and is torched with a flamethrower by Travis. While being burned on the ground, Chango wounds Dwayne and shoots the gas tank on Travis's back, causing it to explode. Nick takes the money and leaves with Kate and Chet. Dwayne chases after Nick and steals the money and when he has Nick at gunpoint his van explodes, seemingly killing him. Nick reveals he reactivated the bomb and put it in Dwayne's van. While Chet looks at the money, it squirts blue dye on his face. In a [[post-credits scene]], Dwayne (who survived the explosion), Travis, the Major recuperating in a wheelchair, and Juicy are seen in an advertisement for their new family business called "Major Tan: Tanning Salon".  ===Alternate ending=== In the alternate ending, Nick, Chet and Kate drive off with the money and discuss what they will do with their new-found riches. Meanwhile, just miles behind them, Dwayne is revealed to have survived the explosion that occurred moments earlier. Annoyed with his plan's failure, he goes to his father's mansion to see if Chango successfully killed him. Dwayne finds his dad on the floor suffering from his gunshot wound and tells about his plans for the tanning salon/brothel. His father is excited and tells his son that he is proud of him. The final scene is at the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]] in Atlanta, where Kate is managing the special events program. She joins up with Nick and Chet, who are chilling out by the pool enjoying their new lives. In addition to this, the late Chango has been blamed for the bank robbery, so all is well.

23:59 (film)
 1983: A group of young soldiers are on the last leg of their national service, spending the last few weeks in a training camp on a jungle island. A rumour had been circulating like wildfire amongst the soldiers. A mad woman living on the island had died at exactly at 23:59 (11.59 PM), and it is believed that her spirit had returned to haunt them at exactly the same time. Tan, the introverted platoon outcast, is adamant that he will be the next victim. He tries to convince his buddy Jeremy that the woman's ghost has been visiting him every night. Jeremy laughs and dismisses Tan's concerns, telling his mate that it is just his overactive imagination.  When the platoon embark on a route march in the forest, Tan is found dead by the river, with his limbs contorted in a strange way and an expression of fear on his face. Overwhelmed with guilt, Jeremy decides to investigate Tan's death, convinced that it was not an accident as what the officers believe.  On the night of Tan's death, Jeremy has a nightmare where he sees the ghost of Tan pointing intently at Chester, another recruit with whom Tan was on guard duty with, dead. The next night, Chester started acting strangely and banging his head on his bed-side locker. When approached by the other recruits, he started acting very aggressively and had to be restrained until the next day when a medium was brought in.  That night, Jeremy confronted Chester about Tan's death, and found out that Chester and Tan were on the same guard duty. During the guard duty, Tan had rolled down a slope accidentally and was grabbed on the leg. Flustered, Chester hit the assailant repeatedly with the butt of his rifle, only to find the bloodied silhouette of the woman who had been haunting them since that night. Jeremy and Chester later returns to the location where Chester had assaulted the woman, only to find that there was no body.  Jeremy, convinced that Chester would be the next to die, asks a villager who has lived on the island since young about the woman. She reveals that the woman was a medium who had the power to control others, and had given birth to a deformed baby one fateful night when a ghost had allegedly possessed her baby. The baby was ostracised by the villagers' children for her appearance, which made the woman furious. It was later revealed that the villagers suspected she had placed a curse on the children, as the children died one by one.  While on their way to inform the Platoon Sergeant of their findings, they were distracted by a disembodied wailing sound. Jeremy notices Chester walking out towards the wilderness and follows behind, only to find Chester with a look of fear on his face as his right arm starts twisting itself, killing Chester. Jeremy sees the woman and runs away (hurting his leg in the process), but ends up at the woman's house. He finds the woman's skeleton on a rocking chair.  As he was about to run away, the woman enters the room and tells him not to be afraid. Jeremy asks why she killed the recruits, only to be told she was not the killer, and that the killer was her deformed daughter. As her daughter enters the room, Jeremy tries to escape again but was blocked by the woman.  The woman possesses Jeremy and apologises to her daughter. It was revealed that the woman had died in the hut from an illness some time earlier. The Platoon Sergeant and two other recruits enters the house in search of Jeremy, only to find him alone. It was later revealed that he survived the ordeal.  The film ends with a new batch of recruits discussing the story of 23:59 and dismissing it, until the door opens to the sound of wailing at 23:59.

Rui goes home to find his girlfriend Laura, but he is rocked when he finds out she has left him. He opens the computer and watches a video she made for him; it turns out the woman who took pictures of Rose earlier is his girlfriend.  Meanwhile, at Rose's house, we learn that she is married to Michael Daly, who had planned the liaison in Vienna. He's come home, and both of them then head out to their daughter's school play that night and tend to her after she forgets her lines. Later in bed, Rose then recalls Michael's voice messages the previous night, saying that he misses her and that he wished she could be there with him. He tells her that his next trip will probably be to Berlin. Rose exclaims that she has never been to Berlin and would love to go.  ===Colorado=== Sex offender Tyler is being released after being imprisoned for six years, and is afraid he's not ready to face life in the outside world due to his temptations.

They are both stranded in [[Denver]] due to bad weather. Meanwhile, Tyler speaks on the phone with the social worker about his stressful situation outside and how he could not control himself from his attraction. He and Laura bump into each other when Laura inadvertently sits at his table in a restaurant at the airport. However, they start a conversation when the drinks she has ordered for her and John are served. Laura seems attracted to Tyler and ends up offering him to stay with her in her hotel room. The intoxicated Laura then makes sexual advances toward him and asks him to kiss her. Instead Tyler controls himself and rebuffs her, locking himself in the bathroom.  The next day, John finds Laura who is about to board her connecting flight. They both tell how it was a pleasure meeting one another. Laura hugs John in a daughterly manner, which affects him. John arrives in Phoenix to examine in the morgue the unidentified remains which could be his daughter, but it turns out to be someone else. John later says in an [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meeting how he can finally accept his daughter's fate, whatever that might have been, and is willing to move on and let go. Next, a foreign woman named Valentina ([[Dinara Drukarova]]), just visiting Phoenix, shares her own story, where we learn that she was the same woman the Algerian man spied on back in Paris (unbeknownst to her).  She speaks about her husband, Sergei, who is too consumed with his job working for a crooked Russian businessman, to love her anymore. She says that she will plan to divorce him. She has feelings for another, her boss, and she is secretly in love with.  ===Back in Paris=== Valentina goes back home to her career-driven Russian husband named Sergei where she informs him she wants a divorce and how she is interested in someone else, but Sergei ignores her complaint and leaves. He drives away towards Vienna while Valentina prepares herself to look attractive, then goes to work in a dental clinic. Her boss, the Algerian man, is the dentist. He is quite nervous around her, making clumsy mistakes and errors. It's clear they both have feelings for each other, but they repress them. He then talks to her privately and, without telling her why, he suggests  it would be better if she looked for another job. Valentina is confused and sad, but leaves nonetheless and is seen walking away, without the red beret this time, her boss watching her from the window.  ===Back in Vienna=== Sergei fetches his boss from the airport and is treated harshly by him. His boss reprimands him when he learns he is learning English and states that it's irrelevant. Mirka and Anna are also riding a bus going to Vienna for another client of Mirka. Sergei stops Mirka on the street in front of the hotel and tells her she is here for his boss. He searches her and then tells her to go to the boss' hotel room. While lingering outside, Anna comes across Sergei, and they chat a bit. When it starts to rain he lets her into his boss's car. They start to develop a friendly relationship from their mutual love for books and learning English. Anna then persuades the ill-treated Sergei to drive around the city.  Back at the hotel, Mirka lets the boss know his time is up. She offers to stay for more money and he shows her a briefcase full of cash. Remembering Rocco's story from the photo shoot, Mirka texts Rocco while ordering from room service. While having Mirka perform fellatio, Sergei's boss reads Mirka's phone and discovers she has texted someone. Realizing she is involved in robbing him, he knocks Mirka unconscious and calls Sergei. When Sergei picks up his call, his boss tells him to come protect him in the hotel. Rocco and Sergei are in the elevator together and Sergei holds back watching Rocco go to his boss' door. The boss calls Sergei and Sergei tricks his boss into thinking he's at the door when in fact it's Rocco. The boss opens the door and a fight ensues. Sergei then leaves the hotel and picks Anna up and they drive away together, she reading to him. At no time is she aware Sergei was acting as 'enforcer' for his boss. Mirka regains consciousness after the attack, sees both the boss and Rocco on the floor, empties the briefcase of the money, and leaves the hotel. In voiceover, you hear Anna reading a goodbye letter to her sister using the same phrasing as at the beginning of the film.

Michael shows up at Wade's and both disregard Beau's barking. Michael clearly thinks the three left him and attended the party, since he couldn't help himself from getting high. The two hang out and start a conversation as Michael explains that he wasn't permitted to catch up at the party with the group since he didn't have a ticket and returned home.  Back at the sauna, the situation escalates as the group runs out of water to drink and Renee gets sick from the temperature. Renee ultimately decides to break the controller, thinking it would lower down the temperature, but is stopped by Jenna who inadvertently strikes her head, leaving her unconscious. Jenna starts freaking out and decides to break the controller herself, which does in fact increase the heat as Ian feared. Ian becomes hysterical and burns himself badly in an attempt to prevent the steamer from heating the room out of control. He fails and the steamer blows up, killing him. The explosion frees the door and Jenna steps out in shock and wanders the house before reality snaps her back from unconsciousness to the floor of the sauna. She finds Renee alive and lets her near the window to breathe.  Michael returns to the cabin where flashbacks shows him absentmindedly knocking over wooden steps and setting them against the door. It is revealed that the steps fall into place against a raised floor by the occupants as they talk and move the door themselves. Meanwhile, Wade arrives at the cabin and discovers the two girls, alive and calls the paramedics who take Jenna and Renee away on stretchers as they hold hands.  
4:44 Last Day on Earth
 Set in [[New York City]], the film focuses on the relationship between two people as they await the end of all life on Earth. Scientists and theologians alike have predicted that by the next morning at 4:44 a.m. Eastern Standard Time deadly solar and cosmic radiation will destroy the Earth's protective ozone layer, and along with it, all life on the planet. Mixed in throughout the film are news clips of various reporters, commentators and celebrities who contemplate what the end of the world will be like.  Cisco and Skye confine themselves to a loft in the city. Cisco is a successful middle-aged actor who just wants to spend his last hours with the woman he cares about, Skye. Skye is a young artist whose latest project, a large painting on the floor, serves as an outlet for her emotions.  Cisco and Skye notice how strangely calm the city is, aside from isolated reports of looting, protests and suicides. They occasionally break away from viewing the news to have sex, and, afterwards, Skye continues to work on her painting, always changing her clothes for each new layer of paint she adds.  They order Vietnamese food and give all of their money to the delivery boy. They allow him to use their laptop computer to talk with his parents in Vietnam. After the delivery boy leaves, Cisco and Skye each use the computer to talk with their families: Cisco talks with his ex-wife and his estranged teenage daughter, and Skye talks with her mother.  When the pair have an argument over their insecurities, Cisco walks out and goes to the apartment of two old friends, Noah and Tina, who are taking drugs in the company of a local drug dealer. After a long talk about life and being with the people they love, Cisco leaves to rejoin Skye at the loft, where they wait until 4:44 a.m. They die in each other's embrace, as Skye is reciting marriage vows.  
388 Arletta Avenue
 An unidentified stalker records video of married couple James and Amy Deakin as they hide their spare key outside their home.  When the couple leaves to go jogging, he uses the key to enter their home and set up hidden security cameras in each room.  He also makes subtle changes, such as setting their alarm to go off earlier and leaving a mix CD in their car.  Amy protests when the alarm wakes her up early, and the two argue over who recorded the mix CD.  When James finds the audio tracks on his computer, Amy considers the mystery solved, but James insists that he never downloaded them.  As they argue, James dismisses Amy's PhD research on Afghan culture as a waste of time, and she refuses to speak to him.  The next morning, as James leaves for work, he writes her a brief apology.  The stalker enters the house, reads the note, and records video of Amy's reaction to noise that she hears in the house.  When James returns home, he finds a note ostensibly written in Amy's handwriting in which she says that she has left to clear her head.  James attempts to contact Amy many times, but she does not answer her calls.  Worried, he calls her friends, including Amy's sister Katherine, with whom he has an antagonistic relationship.  James refuses to explain the situation to Katherine, and she becomes suspicious that something has happened between Amy and James.  James eventually turns to his friend Alex, who suggests that their childhood acquaintance Bill may be involved.  James contacts Bill, an Afghanistan veteran who now works nights at an animal shelter, and he apologizes for tormenting Bill mercilessly during their school years.  Although Bill accepts both the apology and a gift, a collectable baseball, he says little except that the apology does not negate the bullying.  Later, James comes to believe that his cat has been replaced when he receives taunting e-mails and the cat exhibits uncharacteristic behavior.  A police officer files a report but does not take James' claims seriously.  When James finds the remains of his decapitated cat and video surveillance evidence that an intruder entered his home, he contacts the police again, but the police remain skeptical, as the cat's remains have gone missing.  Convinced that the police will not act, James investigates the matter himself.  James receives a brief video that shows Amy bound and gagged before it deletes itself.  Frustrated, James demands the unseen antagonist reveal himself; immediately afterward, the collectable baseball is thrown through one of his windows, which initiates a violent confrontation between James and Bill.  Hidden video surveillance later depicts James as he digs a shallow grave.  James becomes erratic and paranoid, and, with Alex's help, he illegally purchases a handgun.  Katherine becomes increasingly suspicious of James and threatens to call the police, which James laughs off.  James attempts to make contact with his unseen stalker, who intentionally reveals himself as being in the house.  After a brief chase, James offers a deal: for Amy's safe return, James will stop investigating and not further contact the police.  At work the next day, James receives video footage of Amy asleep in their bed.  James leaves for his house at the same time that Alex, Katherine, and a policeman arrive.  As Katherine discovers Amy's body hidden in the basement, James attempts to confront the stalker, only to realize that he has been framed for her murder.  While still holding the pistol, James attempts to explain the situation, and the police officer shoots him dead. In his home, the still-unidentified stalker labels his surveillance tape as "388 Arletta Avenue" and sets it beside several other tapes.  He then starts the cycle again with a new family.  
Aadukalam
 In [[Madurai]], veteran rooster trainer Periyasamy (60) aka "Pettaikaaran" ([[V. I. S. Jayapalan]]) and Madurai Central [[Police Inspector]] Rathnaswamy (40) ([[Aadukalam Naren|Naren]]) are tough competitors in [[cockfight]]s, and it is often Pettai who wins because nobody knows his way of maintaining the quality of the birds. Rathnasamy and Pettaikaran were once proteegees of grand veteran Doraisamy, who has retired from active competition, but is the overlord of rooster fighting in South Tamilnadu.  Karuppu ([[Dhanush]]) (26) and Durai (30) ([[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]]) are the favourites in Pettai's team. Karuppu is very talented in breeding and training roosters, while Durai is very rich, owns three bars in the town of Thiruparangundram, and is also talented in cock training. Rathnaswamy keeps insisting on having one last fight to win and satisfy his old mother’s wish, but Pettai declines to have any more fights with him because he feels Rathnaswamy has lost faith in his roosters and will be using nefarious methods to win. Rathnaswamy keeps insisting and tries to make him accept the challenge through cajoling, threatening, bribing and other vile acts.  Karuppu falls in love with an [[Anglo-Indian]] girl, Irene ([[Taapsee Pannu|Taapsee]]), who dislikes him. He does not recognise this initially and keeps following her. One day, the residents of Irene's colony confront him and ask Irene to tell who she is in love with&nbsp;– Karuppu or Dinesh ([[Dinesh Ravi]]), another man in the locality. She points her finger at Karuppu and he goes into rapture. She explains later that she had to lie in order to avoid Dinesh who has been bothering her for a long time. Later, Irene too falls in love with Karuppu.  Meanwhile, Rathinasamy tries to cajole Ayubh, Pettaikaran's [[Veterinary physician|veterinarian]] for roosters, to get Pettaikaran to come for a competition against himself, in exchange for a heavy amount. Ayubh refuses and insults Rathnasamy. The same night, Ayubh is killed in a hit and run accident. Durai initially suspects Rathnaswamy, and all of Pettai's gang wants revenge. But, Pettai decides to conduct a state tournament in Ayubh's name and provide his family with funds, so that Ayubh's poor daughters can be married. He asks permission from Rathnasamy, as the police have to permit it, but Rathnaswamy refuses, manhandles and berates Pettai as a thief. In a rage Pettai, suspecting Rathnaswamy of the murder, agrees to the one-on-one rooster fight Rathnaswamy has been asking for so long. He bets that, he will field his roosters against every rooster Rathnaswamy's brings to the field in the following tournament and even if one of Pettai's roosters loose against Rathnaswamy's, Pettaikaran will tonsure his head and face, publicly apologise to him, and will quit rooster fights. But, if Rathnaswamy is not able to beat at least one of his roosters, the same conditions will be applied on him, at the end of the day. Finally getting his way, Rathnaswamy permits the tournament.  The grand state tournament is arranged by Pettai's team, getting heavy funds and an official permission. In the initial 11 fights, Rathnasamy's roosters are defeated soundly by Pettaikaran's. Rathnasamy brings high breed roosters from Bangalore, and enters them into the tournament. Seeing the quality of new roosters, Karuppu asks Pettai to let his rooster fight, but Pettai puts his rooster down and says he will choose the best competing rooster himself. Karuppu surreptitiously enters the contest as Pettai's team before Pettai can choose the rooster because he needs to repay Irene for the loan he took to prepare his rooster for the fight. Pettai does not believe in Karuppu and his rooster, announces that Karuppu will not represent Pettai, and the result of Karuppu's match will not be acknowledged by his team. The 'underdog' however emerges victorious in three consecutive rounds despite facing roosters spiked with steroids. Karuppu gets the best coach award of the tournament and his bet money of 3 lakh 10 thousand.  While initially happy that Karuppu won, Pettai is soon overcome with anger and jealousy. His ego is hurt by the fact that Karuppu earns both popularity and money, by refuting his judgement. Karuppu is not aware of the changes in Pettai's mind. Pettai is at first refusing to speak to anyone and then starts scheming. Karuppu gives to Pettai the money from the competition for safe keeping, in which he plans to use to start a business. But it suddenly goes missing. Pettai also starts spinning stories about his associates and makes everyone suspicious of each other. He incites Karuppu and Durai into pitting their roosters in a fight. Meanwhile, Karuppu's mother dies from the shock of losing all the money. Meanwhile, Pettai poisons all of Durai's roosters making him suspect Karuppu, who is arrested for this. Pettai then lies to Irene that his wife was in an adulterous relationship with Karuppu. Irene's family also pressure her to move to [[Chennai]] which pushes her into attempting to commit suicide. Pettai meanwhile calls Karuppu to a location near a temple and informs Durai about his whereabouts. When Irene gets better, she calls Karuppu and informs him that Pettai is badmouthing him. So, Karuppu goes to find Pettai and confront him. Karuppu finds that Pettai was the one who stole his money, and a guilt-ridden Pettai kills himself. Karuppu does not wish to reveal the fact to the public that Pettai stole his money and schemed against him, so he flees with Irene to start a new life in another city leaving the money with his friend.  
Aaranya Kaandam
 The film opens with the ageing gangster, Singaperumal, forcing himself on a young girl, Subbu. He is unable to perform, and vents his anger by slapping the helpless Subbu. Singaperumal is the grand don of crime in Madras. His lieutenant, Pasupathi, brings a proposal. A large stash of cocaine, worth about  2 crore, has entered the city. The guy bringing the stash wants to sell it for  50 lakh. Pasupathi sees the immediate easy profit, as well as the long term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such a large supply) and the recognition that they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash really belongs to their arch-rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary, and the venture is risky and likely to become messy. He decides to pass. Pasupathi dourly suggests Singaperumal is getting old and rusty. He asks Singaperumal to loan him the  50 lakh so he can do the job himself. Pasupathi is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits. Singaperumal agrees to the loan, but, instead asks Pasupathi to first get the stash and then think of the profit distribution. The money for the loan is brought to Singaperumal.  The film introduces Kalaya, a now destitute farmer, and his young, street-smart son Kodukapuli. They live in the slums and earn a meagre living staging cock-fights; as a coincidence, Singaperumal loves to watch these cock-fights. One evening, a man arrives to bunk with Kalaya for the night. This man is the cocaine courier. He routinely transports various stashes of drugs in and out of the city, and collects a relatively small fee ( 10,000) for each trip. That evening, after a long bout of drinking, he reveals that he has learnt the true value of the stash, and he now intends to sell it himself instead of delivering it to its true owner. He passes out.  Seeing Subbu in tears, Singaperumal asks one of his men, Sappai, to take her out and comfort her "so she is prepared to perform for him at night". Sappai takes her to the beach and tries to console her.  Pasupathi and the men meet with the tipster and drive off to retrieve the stash. En route in the car, one of the men receives a call from Singaperumal, who orders him to bump-off Pasupathi as soon as the stash is acquired. Pasupathi overhears this as the call is on speaker mode and gets into a [[Mexican standoff|Mexican stand-off]] with others. In a desperate ploy he deliberately provokes a cop at a checkpoint, getting arrested and then later making an escape. The other men kidnap his wife, Kasturi, and use her as bait to lure Pasupathi. Singaperumal orders them to bring Kasturi to him.  Subbu hates being a plaything for Singaperumal. She yearns to be free and live life on her own terms. She tries to persuade Sappai to think for himself and realise that Singaperumal is merely using them. Sappai, however, is too fearful and weak to oppose Singaperumal. Subbu and Sappai become unlikely lovers, and Subbu continues to hope for a way out. We learn that Subbu is somewhat educated, and learns whatever she can about the world outside Singaperumal.  Kalaya stages his cock-fight the following day. But this time, his prize cocks get killed. Kalaya is in serious financial trouble. Kodukapuli senses this and immediately goes to see if their visitor, still unconscious, has any money. They find out that the man had overdone his drink and died. Kalaya and Kodukapuli find the cocaine stash and the telephone number of a prospective buyer (Singaperumal and Pasupathi). Kalaya declares that his financial woes are at an end.  Singaperumal is worried. His stash has not arrived, nor has he got word that Pasupathi is dead. He gets an angry call from Gajapati (Gajendran's brother and right-hand man): if Pasupathi seizes Gajapati's stuff, Gajendran will unleash a terrible gang war. The cunning Singaperumal tells Gajapati that Pasupathi has gone rogue, and that Gajapati is free to take out Pasupathi. Singaperumal figures this will benefit him both ways: he will get the stash, and his avaricious general will be killed by Gajendran. Gajendran sends his thugs after Pasupathi. Pasupathi is on the run. Now that Singaperumal has become his enemy, Pasupathi figures that Gajendran could possibly become an ally.  Kalaya calls Singaperumal to meet and make a deal for the stash. While waiting for him, Singaperumal's thugs arrive and kidnap Kalaya at the rendezvous point. After continuous torture, Kalaya is unable to reveal anything as his son Kodukapuli has the stash. Kodukapuli ends up calling Pasupathi's number accidentally, and offers to trade the stash for his father. Pasupathi joins Kodukapuli and offers the same trade to Singaperumal: the stash in return for Kalaya and Kasturi. Pasupathi places a call to Gajendran and offers to reveal the location of the stash.  Gajendran and his gang arrive at the location to make the exchange with Pasupathi. Singaperumal's thugs also arrive at about the same time. Pasupathi pretends to offer the stash to Gajapati, but instead slices his throat right in front of Gajendran. An enraged Gajendran and his gang chase Pasupathi. Pasupathi leads them around the block where Singaperumal's gang lay waiting. Both gangs mistaking Pasupathi's loyalties charge at each other and ensue in a gang-fight. Pasupathi gets out of the fray, and watches as Gajendran and the key generals of Singaperumal's hack each other to bits. Pasupathi's plan to decimate the two strong factions has succeeded. He returns to finish Singaperumal.  Back in his rooms, Singaperumal discovers that the bag with the loan money is missing. He rushes to the conclusion that Sappai took it. When Sappai returns (having been sent by Subbu to fetch fruits), Singaperumal beats him up severely. Sappai's faith is shattered. In his first moment of independence, he grabs a pistol and shoots Singaperumal dead! Subbu emerges from the shadows. She is proud of Sappai, but in a stunning twist, she shoots and kills Sappai! When Pasupathi arrives, he finds Sappai and Singaperumal dead and Subbu in tears. Having always been sympathetic to Subbu's suffering with Singaperumal, he says she is free to go. Subbu leaves. Pasupathi summons the remaining thugs of Singaperumal's gang and assumes command. Kasturi is unharmed. Pasupathi gets the stash and pays Kodukapuli a fair commission.  It is finally revealed that Subbu had planned the whole thing. She sent Sappai with the bag containing the loan money to provoke Singaperumal's temper. She retrieves the bag with the loan money and quietly leaves the city to begin her new life. She remarks that the men basically mistrusted, misused and slaughtered each other. In her view, Sappai, too, was not really an innocent victim. She says Sappai is also a man, but all men are sappai (The word 'sappai' has varied meanings, but in this case, it means insignificant to the point of being [[contemptuous]]). The film ends with her line: The best thing about being a woman is that it’s a man’s world.

The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] grants reservations for [[Other Backward Classes]]. A large crowd of STM students, boisterously celebrating the ruling, arrive at the gates of STM and start a ruckus. Sushant gathers a group of upper-caste boys and tries to drive off the revellers. Dr. Anand hauls Deepak and Sushant, but is shocked to find that Deepak has turned on him. Poorvi later confronts Deepak and orders him to apologise to her father, but he refuses, leading to their break-up.  The backward classes welcome reservations because it provides additional opportunities for education. The upper classes are against reservations because they do not believe in effectiveness of Reservation System. These arguments are played out between Sushant and Deepak. The moderate STM administrators are afraid that college-level reservations may create conflicts between the students. When asked by a reporter, Dr. Anand shares his personal opinion – that some form of reservation, free of politics and economics, is good for society. The next day's headlines scream that Dr. Anand favours reservations. The STM board is outraged; Dr. Anand is warned that Mithilesh will use this to oust him. Dr. Anand resigns from STM, and Mithilesh is appointed as the new principal. Sushant soon realizes that Dr. Anand's intention is not bad and that he does not have caste feeling.  Dr. Anand to his shock finds that his house is being used for K.K coaching classes, which is linked to Mithilesh. Earlier Dr. Anand signs an agreement that he will be the guarantee for the bank loan taken by his friend, and allows his friend's sons to stay in that house for 2 years but they use it to earn money by allowing K.K coaching classes inside the house. Dr. Anand's house lands in civil court case and no lawyer is ready to go against Mithilesh. Meanwhile, Deepak who is in USA finds that Dr. Anand has resigned from STM, immediately comes to India, enraged Deepak goes to that house and takes law into his own hands by trying to evacuate people related to K.K coaching classes. Police arrest Deepak, but later Deepak is released on bail by Sushant.  Dr Anand resolves to take out Mithilesh with the only weapon left: teaching. He approaches his friend, Shambhu the cowherd, and takes shelter at the  (cowshed). He begins teaching small groups of needy and backward students from the  (nearby neighbourhood), at the cowshed. His first success is Muniya ([[Aanchal Munjal]]), Shambhu's daughter who comes in first place at the board exam. Muniya's principal offers to send more students to Dr. Anand's  school.  Deepak and Sushant return to Dr. Anand and join forces, teaching at the ta school. The  students fare much better at the exams than their classmates. The  school's reputation grows and begins to draw away students at Mithilesh's coaching class.  Mithilesh responds by obtaining a legal permit to demolish the cowshed. The situation is diffused by the arrival of Shakuntala Tai, the reclusive magnate who started the STM institutions. She calls the chief minister, who promptly averts the destruction of the cowshed.

Dr. Bennett gives Nathan the address of a safe house in [[Arlington, Virginia]] and tells him to trust only his biological father Martin and a man named Paul Rasmus. Kozlow's men follow them, but Bennett is able to help them escape. Meanwhile, Burton is warned by his superior to end the situation as soon as possible once he learns of the involvement of Bennett, who is revealed to be a former CIA operative.  Arriving at the safehouse: the two obtain money, a gun, a photo of Nathan's biological mother Lorna Price ([[Elisabeth Röhm]]), and a cell phone. Karen tries to call her family, but her call is intercepted by Burton and the CIA, forcing them to flee. Finding the address for his mother, the pair discover the address is a cemetery and that Lorna has died.  Nathan and Karen visit her grave and find fresh flowers there, and, according to the graveyard attendant, the sender is Paul Rasmus, who lives in Nebraska. The two take an [[Amtrak]] passenger train to get there using fake IDs provided by their friend Gilly ([[Denzel Whitaker]]). En route they confess their feelings for each other and share a passionate kiss. They are unaware that they are being followed by Kozlow's right-hand man who abducts Karen when she goes out for food. He leaves her bound and [[Gag (BDSM)#Tape|gagged with duct tape]] in a separate room, but she frees herself by using a piece of broken glass. Nathan fights the right-hand man and he throws him out the window. After the train stops the two make a run for it. Burton's team finds Kozlow's henchman and tracks them down.  Burton explains the data that Martin had stolen contains Burton's name on the list. As Burton tries to play that off, the agents are attacked by Kozlow's snipers. Nathan and Karen take off in a car before they can be caught. As they flee, the cell phone from Kozlow's man rings, the caller is Kozlow and he threatens to kill Karen's parents if Nathan does not hand over the data. Nathan gets Kozlow to agree to make the transaction at a [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] baseball game at their home stadium, the [[PNC Park]].  Nathan works with Gilly to obtain tickets and secures a gun to one of the seats with the intent to kill Kozlow. Martin calls Nathan and warns him off, but Nathan refuses to listen. When Kozlow arrives, Karen takes Kozlow's photo so Nathan can recognize him. The two meet and Kozlow tells Nathan how he killed his mother when Nathan was 3 after she refused to give up Martin's location. Kozlow grabs the gun from Nathan and demands the list, Nathan bolts and Kozlow gives chase, followed by CIA operatives who have seen them in the crowd. Nathan is able to escape and Kozlow is killed by Martin. Burton, his superior and his agents arrive. Burton asks for the cell phone, promising to give the decrypted results to his superior.  However, Martin had warned his superior about Burton's corruption and takes the phone himself while Burton is taken into custody. Martin calls Nathan, apologizing for not being the father he should have been, Nathan asks him to show himself but Martin refuses. Bennett arrives with Karen and says she has arranged for Nathan to live with her until he decides what to pursue in his life. As the movie ends, Nathan and Karen go on a date in the empty PNC Park.

Their son Sattar has migrated to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Middle East]] (as a part of the [[Kerala Gulf boom]]) with his family and has virtually discarded his parents. Now in their late 70s, the couple save money so they can attend Hajj that year.  [[File:Adaminte Makan Abu2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|alt=|[[Salim Kumar]] and [[Zarina Wahab]] as Abu and Aishumma, holding their new passports]]  Abu sells [[Ittar|''attar'']] (a perfume obtained from flowers), religious books and [[Unani]] medicines that nobody seems to want. Aishumma breeds cattle and chickens, helping her husband realise their shared dream. Abu feels as outdated and discarded by a fast-changing world as the traditional products that he sells.  A school teacher ([[Nedumudi Venu]]), Abu's friend, comes to his aid at his time of need. Hyder ([[Suraj Venjarammoodu|Suraj Venharammud]]), a local teashop owner also empathises with Abu who in turn is frequently given genuine advice by a mysterious saint known simply as "[[Ustad]]" (Tampi Antony). Good-natured people try to help Abu by offering to lend him the amount but, as this goes against the accepted Islamic practices, he refuses to take anything.  With the advancing years, Abu's desperation grows. Finally, in frustration and distress, he sells his cow and old [[jackfruit]] tree. Abu is helped by the manager of a travel agency ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]) to get flight tickets and other documents for his journey. A policeman (Sasi Kalinga) initially tries to reject Abu's passport application, but once he gets his usual bribe he becomes quite helpful. The couple begins their preparations which include attending the Hajj preparation classes conducted by the travel agency, being vaccinated for meningococcal meningitis and buying new [[Ihram|Ihram clothing]]. Abu pays off even the smallest of his old debts as part of the preparations and travels miles to seek forgiveness from Sulaiman, a previous neighbour with whom he once fought.  When the passports and the tickets are ready and a bus journey away in [[Kozhikode]], the sawmill owner ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]), while handing over the money for Abu's tree, says that its wood turned out to be rotten and useless. He insists that Abu take the money, however, since his cause is noble. Abu refuses it, saying that it wouldn't be [[halal]] and hence could anger [[Allah|God]]. When he is sure that he cannot fulfill his dream, Abu reaches another conclusion&nbsp;— that the tree too had life, and several lives must have died when he cut the tree in front of his house. Abu conjectures that maybe one of the reasons for his not being able to go on the journey. On the dawn of the Hajj, Abu tells his wife that they will go the next year; he plants a new jackfruit sapling and is seen going to the mosque to pray on the morning of Hajj.

As she prepares to declare him [[Declared death in absentia|dead ''in absentia'']], her sister Callie, a former addict, comes to stay with her. Together, they work to obtain Daniel's death certificate and find a new apartment for Tricia. As the date approaches, Tricia has terrifying nightmares and hallucinations about Daniel that her psychiatrist interprets as stress and guilt. While jogging, Callie runs into a gaunt man in a tunnel who seems shocked that she can see him. He introduces himself as Walter Lambert and begs her to contact his son, but she runs off. Later, she returns with food and leaves it in the tunnel, which she finds empty.  When Callie discovers a pile of small metal objects on their doorstop, she assumes they were left there by Walter, so she places them at the tunnel entrance. A man walking by advises her not to do so and deposits a trash bag in the same spot. She later finds the pile of metal objects on her bed. Detective Mallory, who has been investigating Daniel's disappearance and is romantically involved with Tricia, responds to the call and chastises the women for leaving their door unlocked in a dangerous neighborhood. In her restlessness, Callie secretly relapses into drug use. Tricia decides to finally sign Daniel's death certificate and go out on a date with Mallory, only to meet a bloody and barefoot Daniel suddenly appearing in front of her house.  At the hospital, doctors diagnose Daniel as severely malnourished, dehydrated, and physically abused. Daniel seems surprised that others can see him and can only explain that he was "underneath". He does not respond to any question and seems to be in deep fear of the tunnel in front of his house. Mallory comes by to talk with Tricia, attempting to convince her to leave Daniel and be with him. Though she refuses, the two kiss. At the same time, Daniel explains to Callie that he made a trade with an insectoid creature that hides in the walls of the tunnel. Callie investigates strange movement by the bathroom and is knocked unconscious. When she wakes, she sees a creature pull Daniel into the tunnel and through the tunnel's solid walls. Callie lies about her relapse in front of the detectives, but Tricia finds her stash and accuses her of hallucinating the incident. In response, Callie shows Tricia information she found on the internet about cases of people who went missing in the neighborhood from the past 100 years, including Walter; Lambert's son claims that he was taken by monsters.  The next day, the police discover Walter's bloody body at the entrance to the tunnel, while the man Callie saw earlier is revealed to be his son, Jamie. The police accuse Jamie of kidnapping local pets, and he implies that he has been offering them as sacrifices to recover his father. Tricia and Callie are attacked by the creature, who kidnaps Tricia. Callie files a missing person report before returning to the tunnel to offer her life in return for Tricia. To her shock, the creature interprets this as saying that she wants her nephew, so it takes out Tricia's unborn [[fetus]] instead. The creature proceeds to claim her before she escapes, leaving her empty shoe behind.  Mallory finds an envelope Callie left for him that contains her research. His fellow detective, Lonergan, assures him that they will keep the cases open indefinitely. He speculates that Jamie, whom he suspects to be a serial killer, may have killed Tricia and Callie, but Mallory chooses to believe that Callie ran away and Tricia is happily living off the land somewhere. While Mallory puts up posters, he sees an apparition of Callie standing in the tunnel, but when he investigates more closely, she is gone. As he walks away, Callie watches him from the tunnel as the creature's limb rests on her shoulder.

The Adventures of Tintin (film)
  Young journalist [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] are browsing in an outdoor market in 1950s [[Brussels]]. Tintin buys a miniature model of a ship, the ''[[Unicorn (ship)|Unicorn]]'', but is accosted by an [[Interpol]] officer, [[Barnaby (comics Tintin)|Barnaby]], and a ship collector, [[Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine]], who both unsuccessfully tried to buy the model from Tintin. Tintin takes the ship home, but it is accidentally broken in an incident between Snowy and a cat. A parchment scroll slips out and rolls under a piece of furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of a [[pickpocket]], [[Aristides Silk]].  After visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find that the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, suspecting Sakharine. He visits [[Marlinspike Hall]] and accuses him of the theft. After arguing, Tintin begins to notice that Sakharine's model is not broken, realizing that there are two ''Unicorn'' models. After returning home once again, Tintin finds out that his apartment had been ransacked. Snowy shows him the scroll but shortly after reading an old message written on it, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''. Tintin places the scroll in his wallet, but it is stolen by Silk the next morning, after a scuffle with the police detectives.  Later, Tintin is abducted by accomplices of Sakharine, and imprisoned on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take over control. On board, Tintin meets [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], the ship's captain. Haddock is permanently drunk and thus unaware of most of his past. Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy eventually outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship fails to ram their boat because they instead rammed an empty lifeboat the captain accidentally released during his escape. Presuming them to have survived by the number of lifeboats, Sakharine sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. The trio seizes the plane, and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]]. However, the seaplane crashes in the desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.  While trekking through the desert, Haddock hallucinates, and remembers facts about an ancestor of his, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], who was a 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn''. Sir Francis's treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a pirate ship, led by [[Red Rackham]] and after his eventual surrender, Sir Francis sank the ''Unicorn'', and most of the treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. It implies that there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.  The third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert that results in him successfully stealing the third scroll. After a chase through the city, he gains all the scrolls by having his men toss Captain Haddock and Snowy in the water, to force Tintin to go after them instead of saving the scrolls. After the boat leaves, Tintin is ready to give up but is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from officers Thompson and Thomson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine down, who is revealed to be a descendant of Red Rackham. They head back to port and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a final showdown. Sakharine and Haddock sword-duel with cranes and swords eventually resulting in Sakharine being defeated and pushed overboard by Haddock. When climbing ashore, Sakharine is arrested by Thomson and Thompson.  Guided by the three scrolls indicating the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin and Haddock find there some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''s location. Both men agree on setting up an expedition to find the shipwreck.  
The Adjustment Bureau
  In 2006, [[Brooklyn]] Congressman David Norris unsuccessfully runs for the [[United States Senate]]. While rehearsing his concession speech, David meets Elise Sellas. They share a passionate kiss, though he does not get her name. Inspired by her, David delivers an unusually candid speech that is well-received, making him a favorite for the 2010 race.  A month later, David prepares for a new job. At [[Madison Square Park]], near David's home, a man named Harry Mitchell receives an assignment from his superior Richardson. Harry is to spill coffee on David's shirt by 7:05 AM so that David will miss his bus. However, Mitchell falls asleep; David boards the bus, meets Elise and gets her phone number.  David arrives at work early and finds everyone in the building frozen and being examined by unfamiliar men. David attempts to escape, but is incapacitated and taken to a warehouse. Richardson reluctantly reveals to David the existence of the "Adjustment Bureau". As its employees, Richardson and his men ensure people's lives proceed following "the Plan", a complex document Richardson attributes to "the Chairman".<ref></ref><ref></ref> The Bureau confiscates and destroys the note that contains Elise's phone number, and David is warned that if he reveals the existence of the Bureau to anyone else, he will be "reset"—akin to being [[lobotomy|lobotomized]]. He is not meant to meet Elise again.  Three years later, David again encounters Elise on the bus; he tells her he spent three years riding that bus to work, hoping to see her. He learns that she dances for [[Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet]]. The Bureau tries to stop them from starting a relationship by altering their schedules and preventing them from meeting. David races across town, fighting the Bureau's abilities to "control his choices" to ensure he will meet Elise. During the chase the Bureau uses ordinary doorways to travel instantly to distant locations.  Senior official Thompson takes over David's adjustment and takes him to the warehouse, where David argues he has the right to choose his own path. Thompson says humanity received [[free will]] after the [[Pax Romana|height of the Roman Empire]], but then brought the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] upon itself. The Bureau took control after five centuries of barbarism, and created the [[Renaissance]], [[the Enlightenment]], and the [[scientific revolution]]. When free will was granted in 1910, it resulted in [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]], [[Fascism]], the [[Holocaust]], and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], forcing the Bureau to retake control. Thompson implies that without Elise's influence David might become [[President of the United States]], while Elise would become a world-famous dancer, and that being together will ruin both of their futures. Thompson causes Elise to sprain her ankle at a performance to demonstrate his power, and David abandons her at the hospital to save them from the fate Thompson described.  Eleven months later, Charlie tells David of Elise's imminent wedding as he campaigns again. Harry contacts David via secret meetings in the rain or near water, which prevents the Bureau from tracking them. Harry reveals that Thompson exaggerated the negative consequences of David and Elise's relationship, and teaches David how to use doors to [[Teleportation|teleport]] and evade the Bureau's adjustments. Just before the wedding David reaches Elise, reveals the Bureau's existence to her, and shows her how he travels through doors. The Bureau pursues them across New York City. David decides to find the Chairman to end the chase, with Elise accompanying him. They enter the Bureau's offices with agents in pursuit.  David and Elise find themselves surrounded on the [[GE Building#Top of the Rock|observation deck of the GE Building]]. They declare their love and kiss before David can be reset. When they let go of each other, the Bureau members have gone. Thompson appears but is interrupted by Harry, who shows him a revised Plan from the Chairman: one that is blank starting from the current moment. Harry commends them for their devotion to each other, then says they are free to leave. David and Elise walk down the street as Harry speculates that the Chairman's goal may be to prepare humanity to write its own "Plans".

 ''African Cats'', referred to as a "[[True-Life Adventures|true life adventure]],"<ref name="We Are Movie Geeks"></ref>  tells the true story of two [[animal]] [[family|families]] living in the [[wilderness|wild]] by using real-life footage.<ref name=Wired></ref> The film focuses on a young [[lion]] cub named Mara raised by her mother Layla, a mother [[cheetah]] named Sita who is raising five newborns, and Fang, the [[leadership|leader]] of Mara and Layla's pride, defending his family from a banished lion named 'Kali'.<ref name="Official page"></ref><ref name=JoBlo></ref> With so many species competing for space and food in the [[savanna]], the animals must figure out what′s the best way to survive.  The film begins by introducing Sita, a cheetah who lives in the vast [[plain]]s of the [[Maasai Mara|Maasai Mara National Reserve]], in Kenya, and has just given birth to five cubs to take care of. Then we see Mara, a six-month-old lion cub, with her mother Layla, who both belong to the River pride, which lives in the south of the [[national park|park]]. The pride′s leader is named Fang, an old male lion, who has a distinctive broken [[tooth]] because of an earlier fight. In the north of the Maasai Mara, Sita and her cubs coexist with another lion pride led by a large male named Kali, who wishes to expand his pride and territory by taking over Fang′s southern pride and territory, which however he cannot reach as the Pride Lands are divided by the [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] infested [[river]].  Sita's cubs are playing while Kali and one of his four sons are on patrol. Sita, seeing them as a serious danger to her cubs, goads them so as to lure them away. However, after the confrontation, the cubs have scattered. Sita desperately calls for them. As it gets darker, [[spotted hyena|hyena]]s are seen and heard. In the morning, three of the five cubs return to Sita. Although she continues to call for the rest of them, it′s clear that they have been killed by hyenas.  Layla was injured by a [[zebra]]'s kick while [[hunting]]. As the [[wildebeest]] begin to migrate to greener pastures, so does the River pride. However, due to her injury and old age, Layla has trouble keeping up. Mara stays alongside her mother and tries to help on her way. Soon, they begin to lose track of the pride. Knowing that Mara needs her family for her survival, Layla forces through her injury, and they soon find themselves within the River pride once more.  As time passes, Sita's cubs have thrived, and begin to show more of their cheetah nature. One day, a gang of three adult cheetah brothers roaming about zone in on Sita. Again, Sita finds herself having to divert attention from rivals so that they do not find her cubs. However, being fellow cheetahs, they do not tire as easily as lions do; and soon, the brothers separate Sita from her cubs. As they circle them, the cubs stand their ground and hiss at the [[bullying|bullies]], meaning they have inherited their mother's prowess and [[courage|bravery]]. Before the cheetah brothers can do anything, a passing [[African elephant|elephant]] chases them away – meaning that in the savanna, even bullies get bullied.  Some time later, the river has lessened. Kali and his largest son take advantage of it so they can cross and begin their [[assault]] on the River pride. They head towards the southern territory. Fang, upon seeing them approaching, runs for his life, but Layla does not back away – knowing that Mara could be killed should the assault succeed, she fearlessly attacks the rivals. Soon, the other lionesses, inspired by Layla's courage, join in the fight. Kali and his son are defeated, and return to the northern territory empty-handed. Victory completed, Fang returns, and life returns to usual for the pride as well. Meanwhile, hyenas approach Sita and her cubs, but the brave mother cheetah, having already lost two cubs to them, does not back away; sure enough, she attacks them fearlessly, not letting them anywhere near her cubs. Finally, the hyenas give up the fight and leave – Sita's bravery has kept the remaining cubs alive and free from danger.  Layla was injured ever further during the fight. Seeing that she might not make it, on a rainy day – which the lions take advantage of to bond with each other –, for Mara′s sake, she goes to her sister Malayka – who has cubs of her own – and reconnects with her so as to maintain a spot in the pride for Mara. Once she sees that Mara is accepted by Malayka, Layla slips away from the pride to find a nice quiet place to [[death|die]].  As time goes by, Kali reunites with his four sons. Although they have shown signs of [[betrayal]] with ideas of dethroning him, Kali is still strong, and shows them that he's the boss and that only he will wear the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]. Together, they are the most powerful force in the land. They return for another assault. Upon seeing them, Fang runs, never to be seen or heard from again – if he is to ever return again, he would be shown no mercy.  Kali takes over the pride and exiles Fang's cubs, including Mara – now a young adult. Her male cousins are seen as the number one threat to Kali and his sons, so they hunt them down. Seeing that they can no longer stay within their pride, Fang's male cubs have no choice but to cross the river, even though its level has grown and it is infested with [[crocodile]]s. As they get near the northern bank, one of them is nearly caught in the [[jaw]]s of a crocodile; nonetheless, they reach land unscathed. The lionesses refuse to admit Kali as their leader, the wound of losing their cubs still far too fresh in their minds.  Mara, banished from her pride, tries to live on her own and fend for herself. However, she was banished before she was taught to hunt, and finds her first attempts at catching meals on her own, even small [[warthog]]s and especially big [[black rhinoceros|rhinos]] and [[African buffalo|buffaloes]], humiliatingly unsuccessful. She learns that there are benefits in belonging to a pride.  Soon the wildebeest return, and the lionesses begin to hunt for their new cubs – Kali′s offspring, having made peace with him and his sons. Mara successfully hunts and feasts. Soon after, she proves herself to the pride, and is at last welcomed back – Layla's sacrifice for raising her cub was not in vain.  Sita's cubs are now young adults, and they′re thriving. They hone their hunting skills, they practice on a [[serval]] and a [[golden jackal|jackal]], and even get to cross the river. Afterwards, they encounter hyenas then Kali's pride, and learn to stand up to hyenas like a true brave cheetah does, and to avoid and outrun lions (instead of hunting them!). Finally, they successfully hunt an [[antelope]] for food. Sita, seeing that her cubs are now ready to forge their own path, leaves them and returns to the solitary life of a cheetah.  At the end of the film, the narrator ([[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the [[United States|US]] version, [[Patrick Stewart]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] version) shows Mara and Sita's cubs as the finest examples of a mother′s love.  During the credits, it is shown that Sita has become one of the most successful cheetah mothers to roam the plains, that her cubs went their separate ways, that Mara has been accepted by her pride and is now ready for [[mother]]hood herself, that Kali still reigns supreme on both sides of the river, and that the filmmakers are still looking for Fang.  
Age of the Dragons
 Harpooner Ishmael ([[Corey Sevier]]) joins Ahab ([[Danny Glover]]) and his crew on the ''Pequod'', in this instance an armored land boat that hunts for [[dragon]]s. The seven-strong crew ostensibly seeks the precious "vitriol", a highly explosive liquid substance found inside the fire-breathing winged creatures, which powers the mythical realm they live in. Ishmael joins their quest, and soon learns that in fact, Ahab's mission is one of revenge on a particular great white dragon that decades ago scarred and injured him, and killed his sister. Forced to hide from the sunlight due to the burn wounds on his body, Ahab now tries to kill all dragons, and especially the white one. Conflict arises through a romantic entanglement between Ishmael and Ahab's adopted daughter, Rachel ([[Sofia Pernas]]), which causes hostility from the jealous hothead Flask ([[Larry Bagby]]). In the white dragon's lair, Ahab's secrets are revealed and Rachel must choose between following him on his dark quest or escaping to a new life with Ishmael. She chooses the latter and in a final confrontation, Ahab's spear, which was tied to his foot, becomes entangled in the White Dragon's neck. The creature flies off with a screaming Ahab, until he is slammed against a rock pillar and silenced. The white dragon flies off into the distance, with Ahab's body clinging on to it.  
Age of Heroes (film)
 The film follows the exploits of Corporal Bob Rains ([[Danny Dyer]]) as he is inducted into the newly formed [[No. 30 Commando|30 Commando unit]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], after being freed from a war prison for cowardice and striking an officer during operations in France. Rains and the rest of the platoon are put through intensive training under the watchful eye of Major Jack Jones ([[Sean Bean]]), where their skills and endurance are pushed to the limit as they prepare for their first highly classified and dangerous mission: to parachute into [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]] and capture new [[Radar in World War II|radar]] technology from the Germans which could change the outcome of the war.  The newly formed band of brothers are joined in their task by Norwegian immigrant Steinar Mortensen ([[Aksel Hennie]]), now a [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] Lieutenant with vital knowledge of the terrain, and beautiful spy Jensen ([[Izabella Miko]]). All their lethal commando skills are put to the test as they attempt to escape fierce gun battles and attain the German radar technology. The mission objective bears much resemblance to [[Operation Biting]]. Their plan is thrown into crisis when their [[Extraction (military)|extraction]] is delayed and they must fight their way to the border of [[Sweden during World War II|neutral Sweden]]. With the Germans desperate to hunt them down and stop them, the commandos realise how important their mission is to the war effort.  After a long trek in the snow, the commandos try to resupply by returning to a previously visited farm. Its inhabitants had been shot by German units for aiding the British commandos. To make things worse, the Germans catch up with them at the farm, bringing Corporal Brightling ([[Stephen Walters]]), who was captured alive during the earlier fire fight. The Germans urge the commandos' surrender in exchange for the life of their captured comrade. The commandos refuse, and instead open fire on the Germans. Jensen and radar specialist Roger Rollright ([[John Dagleish]]) are ordered to make a run for the Swedish border, while the rest of the commandos provide cover for them.  Major Jones realizes that there are too many German soldiers pouring into the fire fight. He orders Rains and Steinar to run for the border, while two others stay to cover them. Those who remain at the farm are last seen firing on and suppressing the Germans. The Germans catch up to Rains and Steinar retreating; Steinar is shot and killed. Out of ammunition, and with several enemy soldiers advancing on him, Rains prepares to cut his own throat. But before doing so, Jensen and Rollright kill the two Germans, thus enabling  them to escape overland to Sweden. The last scene shows the two surviving team members and Jensen standing on a hill looking down into a snow-covered valley that leads to Sweden.  
The Ages of Love
 The film is composed of three episodes, connected through a young taxi driver who plays [[Cupid]]. Each episode is following a different couple:  *Giovinezza (''youth''): Roberto and Micol ([[Riccardo Scamarcio]] and  [[Laura Chiatti]]); *Maturità (''maturity''): Fabio and Eliana ([[Carlo Verdone]] and [[Donatella Finocchiaro]]); *Oltre (''beyond''): Adrian and Viola ([[Robert De Niro]] and [[Monica Bellucci]]).  In the first  story, Roberto is a lawyer sent to a rural town in [[Tuscany]] to convince a family of old farmers to sell their land. They are reluctant to accept the offer, so Roberto stays for a few days. He spends his time in a company of locals, where he meets Micol, a beautiful young woman who flirts with him. They have fun together and one night, they kiss and make love on a beach. But Roberto has a fiance, Sara, who calls him every day to say how she misses him.

Realizing they have no future together, Roberto and Micol part their ways. Sara comes to take him, and before leaving town, Roberto urges the farmers to stand for their land.  In the second story, Fabio (Verdone) is a famous news anchor on [[TG La7]]. At a party, he meets a pretty woman and they hook up. She offers Fabio casual sex, which leads to a few weird sexual encounters. When one of them ends with a damage to a police car, Fabio learns that Elaine is suffering from [[bipolar disorder]] and has a history of mental breakdowns. He tries to end the affair, but she begins to stalk him, threatening him with a home video recording of them having sex and finally tearing down his apartment. His wife and daughter leave after he discloses his infidelity, and Fabio has a breakdown on live air, which has him demoted to a field reporter in Africa. On his way to the airport, he is called to the mental institution where Elaine is now treated for a chronic depression. She bids him farewell and gives him keys to her apartment, where he retrieves the video recording and an awkward farewell poem. On his way out, he encounters Adrian, and it is later revealed that Fabio was taken hostage by Muslim terrorists.  In the final story, Adrian is a retired professor of art history from [[Boston]] who lives alone in his [[Rome]] apartment. His only friend is Augusto, the house concierge, who one day is visited by his daughter Viola, a beautiful fashion model from [[Paris]].

After he fights an abusive former boyfriend, Viola takes interest in Adrian and learns that he had serious health problems, having gone through a [[heart transplant]] operation which left him physically and emotionally scarred. After a fierce argument with her father, Viola knocks on Adrian's door, as she has nowhere else to go. Augusto comes to Adrian and is furious to disclose that Viola is actually a stripper girl and has incurred a large debt. Adrian and Viola spend an evening, revealing their stories. Adrian suffered from depression after his operation, which ended his marriage, and Viola tried to open a restaurant with a loan from local gangsters, but didn't succeed. They spend the night together. Viola wants to leave town, not wanting to cause trouble to anyone, but Adrian professes his love to her and they embrace. In the end, it is revealed they moved to a small town to have their first child, and Adrian secretly settled Viola's debt.  
Afghan Luke

They encounter Taliban raids, bombings and unfinished business with an Afghanistan businessman. Luke still makes his way through the wilderness with Canadian troops and Arabian guides to find out if his story is true or not. In the end, he realises that the rumour about Canadians mutilating fingers is a lie and that his people still have some morality in this war torn land. Just as he is about to leave, He and Sgt. Rick (a Canadian soldier who is the leader of the squad with whom he had been travelling) come under fire from a Taliban sniper, but the Taliban runs out of bullets and walks off, while Luke thinks he killed him. While they move back to the base, Luke runs into Matteen, where he finds out that they really do share a friendship. The last scene is where Luke decides to go home.

When Cathy begs to be released, Maggie agrees to let her go, but only on the condition that she be allowed to remove the bullet from Cathy's shoulder. The "surgery" that Maggie performs on Cathy exacerbates the girl's injury, and she dies from the combination of it and the mixture of [[vodka]] and pills that Maggie had given her as an [[anesthetic]]. While Maggie is asleep and Bill is out disposing of Cathy's body, Carla tries to run away, and stumbles onto her father's remains.

Albert Nobbs
  Albert Nobbs is a butler at the Morrison Hotel in late-19th-century Dublin, Ireland; his boss is Mrs Baker. Although he was assigned female at birth, Albert has spent the last 30 years living as a man. He has also been secretly saving money to buy a [[tobacconist]] shop to gain some measure of freedom and independence.  Recently unemployed Joe Mackins arrives at the hotel and cons his way into a boilerman job. He and a maid there, Helen Dawes, become lovers. Hubert Page, tasked with painting at the hotel, discovers Albert's secret. He reveals to Albert that he is keeping the same secret about himself, living as a man after escaping an abusive husband.

Albert tells Hubert the story of his life: born illegitimate and then abandoned, Albert was adopted by a Mrs Nobbs and educated in a convent before being expelled after his mother died. One night, aged 14 and still living as a girl, Albert was brutally gang-raped and beaten by a group of men. After hearing there was a need for waiters, Albert bought a suit, was interviewed and hired, and began his life with a male identity.  Believing Helen may be the ideal wife to run a shop with, Albert asks her out on a date. She refuses, but Joe, believing that Albert will give Helen money that could help the pair emigrate to America, encourages her to lead Albert on. She agrees to this approach, allowing Albert to buy her gifts. Helen is uncomfortable with Albert and the arrangement that Joe has persuaded her to make.

Meanwhile, Albert goes to Hubert's home one day and learns that Cathleen has died, leaving Hubert devastated. Albert and Hubert put on dresses made by Cathleen. Though both at first are extremely uncomfortable, they eventually spend a fun day together dressed as women. A stumble and fall by Albert on the beach brings them back to reality. The pair return to Hubert's, change back into their men's clothing, and go back to their lives as before.  Back at the hotel, Albert learns Helen is pregnant and offers to marry her. She refuses, saying Albert does not love her, though Albert voices a fear that Joe will leave by himself for America and not take her and the child. Later that evening, Joe and Helen get into a loud fight after Joe reveals he is indeed going to America alone. Albert attacks Joe when he gets physical with Helen, and Joe throws Albert against a wall, giving him a head injury. Albert retires to bed, forgotten in the commotion, bleeding from one ear. Helen angrily tells Joe she no longer wants to be with him anyway, and he leaves. Helen finds Albert dead in his bed the next morning.  Helen eventually gives birth to a son, Albert Joseph.

All-Star Superman (film)
 Dr. Leo Quintum and his team are exploring the Sun when they are sabotaged by a booby-trapped genetically-enhanced time-bomb clone made by [[Lex Luthor]]. [[Superman]] stops the clone but in doing so receives an overdose of solar radiation; it has given him increased powers, but at the cost of slowly killing him. Luthor, having orchestrated the death of Superman while under the employment of General [[Sam Lane (comics)|Sam Lane]], is arrested thanks to Clark Kent's article and sentenced to death. Superman asks Dr. Quintum to keep news of his impending death secret from the public. Wanting to spend as much of his remaining time as possible with [[Lois Lane]], Superman reveals to her that he is Clark Kent, but she initially doubts his revelation because she had been unable to prove Superman's "Kent" identity herself. Superman takes her to the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. During this visit, Superman's secretive behavior and her indirect exposure to alien chemicals heightens Lois' paranoia.  She is startled by Robot 7, shooting it and then Superman with a [[kryptonite]] laser. The solar radiation having made him immune to green kryptonite, Superman is able to calm her, explaining his caginess was to hide her birthday present, a serum granting her superpowers for 24 hours. Now as a [[Superwoman]], she and Superman stop an attack by Subterranosauri led by Krull in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] just as Samson (who tricked Krull into leading an attack on the surface world) and [[Atlas (DC Comics)|Atlas]] arrive. After the Subterranosauri are returned to the center of the Earth, their leader Tyrannko states to Superman that Krull will be dealt with. Samson flirts with Lois and gives her a necklace, the crown jewels of the Ultra-Sphinx. When Superman tells him to back off, he shows Superman a newspaper that reads "Superman Dead" and challenges Superman to contests to win Lois. The Ultra-Sphinx travels through time to reclaim the jewels Samson had stolen, placing Lois between life and death. Superman must answer an unanswerable question to save Lois. The unanswerable question is "What happens when the Irresistible Force meets the Immovable Object?" Superman beats Ultra-Sphinx's challenge with the answer being "they surrender". Superman then defeats Atlas and Samson in a double arm-wrestling match before spending the rest of the day with Lois as her powers fade.  Later, Kent meets Luthor in his [[death row]] cell for an exclusive interview. However, the energy in Kent attracts [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], who goes berserk. Clark stops him while not revealing his secret identity, with Luthor disclosing his respect for Clark as both a journalist and a man. Luthor then reveals a tunnel from his cell for Clark to escape through, aided by Luthor's delinquent niece Nasthalthia. Luthor chooses not to escape as the satisfaction of outliving Superman is rewarding enough. Clark tells Lois he's dying, before leaving to take the city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] to a new planet to thrive, despite it being permanently shrunk, as he does not believe he'll survive the trip back. Lois denies it, speaking of their future together with their super-children. Clark informs her that their biology is too incompatible for them to bear children. Clark leaves with Lois promising to wait for his return.  Two months later, Superman returns to find Metropolis has been repaired with [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] architecture and that Earth has been protected by Bar-El and Lilo, lost [[astronaut]]s from Krypton. They followed the trail of the vessel that brought Superman to Earth. To his dismay, the two have less altruistic goals and intend to turn Earth into a new Krypton. As they fight Superman outside of the Daily Planet, Bar-El and Lilo begin showing signs of illness: the two had passed through the remnants of Krypton and thus were saturated with Kryptonite. To save them and at their request, Superman places the two in the [[Phantom Zone]] until a cure can be found.  After settling his affairs, Superman proceeds to finish his last will and testament. Luthor reprogrammed one of the Fortress' [[Superman robots|robots]] to steal the serum he made for Lois' birthday. Having the powers of Superman, Luthor's death by electric chair failed and he escapes unfettered. He meets with Nasthalthia below one of his lairs to continue his plans. Superman finishes his will when he learns of Luthor's secret ally [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Solaris|Solaris]]; the tyrant star computer has betrayed Luthor by tampering with Earth's sun and turned it blue. With his robots, Superman engages Solaris in space. However, Solaris' raw power output vaporized all of the robots, with Robot #7 sacrificing itself to damage Solaris to redeem itself for being manipulated into stealing the super serum. All seems lost until Superman's pet [[Sun-Eater]] sacrifices itself to weaken the tyrant star, which allows Superman to destroy Solaris.  Clark returns to the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', very ill, and collapses upon completing his article, "SUPERMAN DEAD". When the staff tries to save him they realize that he has stopped breathing and his heart has stopped. But before they can do anything to help Clark, the super-powered Lex Luthor arrives and attempts to kill Lois. Clark revives and fires a gravity gun at Luthor. Superman tells Luthor that he has been on to him ever since Superman Robot #7 first malfunctioned. As his powers fade, Luthor briefly sees the world as Superman sees it and weeps as he gains a measure of understanding of the subatomic and how it interconnects. The gravity weapon has warped time causing Luthor's powers to burn out at a faster rate. As his powers drain, Luthor wishes the experience to continue. He believes he can solve the [[grand unification theory]] but when he reaches for his next vial of serum, he realizes that Superman has stolen his supply. Superman then destroys the serum over Luthor's protests, pointing out that if Luthor truly cared about solving the world's problems, he would have done so long ago. Luthor somberly admits Superman is right.  With Superman's body starting to turn into pure energy, he and Lois embrace one final time and he proclaims his love for her once and for all. He gives her his cape as a way to remember him before he leaves and flies into the Sun, seemingly sacrificing himself to save the Earth.  Later, when Lois sits on a bench in front of a statue of Superman, Jimmy invites her to attend a memorial service being held for Superman. Lois does not go as she believes that Superman is not dead and will return after he repairs the sun. Quintum visits Luthor in his cell. Now enlightened from his ordeal and accepting his impending death, Luthor presents Quintum with the only thing that could redeem him for his actions over the years....a formula to recreate Superman's genetic structure through a healthy human ovum. As Quintum leaves, he sadly muses "They always said they wanted children". The movie ends with a picture of Superman fixing the sun and Lois' voice once more stating "He's not dead. He's up there fixing the Sun. And when he's done, he'll be back".

 Jean (Bedos) is a romantic revolutionary, yet enjoys the spoils of a bourgeois lifestyle with his wife, Annie (Chaplin). Annie is a retired psychologist, who complains about not being able to see enough of her children and assorted grandchildren. Albert (Richard) is showing increasing signs of dementia; his energetic American wife Jeanne (Fonda) is a former university lecturer who is suffering from cancer but who assures her husband that she is cured, yet shops for a brightly-colored coffin.   Widower Claude (Rich) is an aging womanizer with an appetite for pursuits with prostitutes. Knowing how lonely he is at home alone after a previous heart attack, Jean suggests that the five friends should live together in their house, an idea that appalls Annie. Claude suffers another heart attack from walking up too many flights of stairs, on the way to visiting one of his lady friends. Albert is also hospitalized after his beloved dog knocks him down during a walk, though he claims he slipped on the sidewalk. Unable to see his dog be given away, Jeanne and Albert hire Dirk (Brühl), a German ethnology student, to walk him instead.  After seeing the sad conditions of Claude's retirement home, the friends decide to move in together on Jean's suggestion. Dirk, who has changed his thesis to reflect the condition of France's aging population, moves in with them as a caregiver. Meanwhile, Annie prepares to build a pool on her property in the hopes that it will attract her grandchildren. Jeanne becomes frustrated at Albert's worsening condition as he begins to forget that he is living with his friends instead of at his own home. Albert also speaks with Jeanne's doctor, who informs him that Jeanne's latest tests indicate that her cancer is not cured, but is worsening.   Jeanne strikes up a friendship with Dirk, giving him advice on troubles with his girlfriend and telling him that life is short and that he should be with someone who is more his type. She also reveals that she had a lover in the past, but is still good friends with him. One day she tells Albert that she is going out to walk the dog with him. Albert acknowledges this, yet forgets and goes off to find her, leaving the bath running. He finds them in a park together and accuses her of starting a relationship with him, angering her; he also forgets who Dirk is and why he hired him. The water overflows from the tub, ruining Annie's precious furniture, yet Albert does not know why she's upset.   Later, Albert brings Dirk along to help him with opening some old trunks.

He reveals this to Jean, who doesn't believe him until he accuses Annie and she confesses.

The friends make up that night while Jeanne is bedridden.  The next morning, the friends drink champagne and Jeanne succumbs to her illness shortly after. She is buried in a bright pink coffin, and, as per her requests, the surviving friends leave their champagne glasses on it. The pool is filled shortly after and Annie's grandchildren are finally spending time with her and Jean. Claude finds Dirk having sex with a new part-time caregiver, a girl Jeanne hired who is more of Dirk's type. Before they can toast to the new assistant, a confused Albert wanders in, asking after Jeanne; he still believes her to be alive.

All Superheroes Must Die
  The film opens with Charge/John (Trost), Cutthroat/Ben (Till), The Wall/Charlie (Valmassy), and Shadow/Jill (Merkley), waking up in a seemingly abandoned town, all bearing strange injection marks on their wrists. They soon discover television sets through which their nemesis, Rickshaw, whom the group thought Charge had defeated some time ago, explains to them that he has staged a game all across town with innocents' lives at stake, and that he has also taken away their powers. To prove this, he executes a civilian near Cutthroat's location, then instructs the heroes to head to a meeting ground. Once there, the four have a brief personal reunion, in which the group realizes that Charge still retains some of his abilities, before Rickshaw interrupts them, giving them new orders. Charge assumes command of the group almost unanimously, with the exception of Cutthroat, who appears disgruntled with the others' decision.  The group finds themselves in a hardware store, where Rickshaw instructs each of them to choose a weapon, then divides them into teams of two and orders them to a deathmatch with two of his goons in different parts of the town; Charge and Cutthroat head off to the lumber mill, while The Wall and Shadow go to the scrap yard. In the mill, Charge and Cutthroat find a group of civilians strapped to explosives with the fuse already lit, and Charge faces Sledgesaw, a goon of Rickshaw's, while Cutthroat tries to defuse the explosives. Charge defeats his opponent and they succeed in cutting the fuse, only for Rickshaw to remotely detonate the device moments after Charge saves Cutthroat and himself by pulling him away from the civilians. While surveying the wreckage, Cutthroat laments in his inability to save the civilians, stating that if he had his power of super speed, he could have saved them.   Meanwhile, in the scrap yard, The Wall and Shadow are attacked by Manpower, who wields a flamethrower against them. Once it runs out of fuel, The Wall charges him, only to be promptly taken down without his superpower (presumably some form of invincibility, which also renders him immune to physical pain). Shadow tries to help, but without her own power of invisibility, she is unable to prevent Manpower from stabbing The Wall in the stomach. Just as he turns to her, Charge and Cutthroat arrive and defeat Manpower. Charge then informs the group that The Wall only has moments to live, as his wounds are not treatable. He instructs Shadow, who presumably had an intimate relationship with him, to stay with The Wall until the end while he explains to Cutthroat that he has a plan to defeat Rickshaw and that Rickshaw does not care if they win or not, but will execute civilians merely to affect them; he is proven right when, moments after The Wall's death, he executes the trapped civilians and then gives the group the coordinates for a new, "Bonus Round".  The group arrives at a cabin where three civilians are held, and they discover three coffins with their names on them, as well as a single gun. Rickshaw appears and tells them that he will spare a civilian for each of them that commits suicide at their respective coffin, but Charge takes the gun and executes the hostages himself, much to the others' horror. He argues that Rickshaw would kill them anyway, and that he did it so none of the others would be tempted to take their own lives. Cutthroat tells Shadow that he trusts Charge to have a plan, noting that "...failure is just not an option to him." It is revealed through flashbacks that the four were close friends at some point, that Charge was the one who had urged the rest to become superheroes after they obtained their powers, and that Charge and Cutthroat were working as a team. It is also suggested that Charge and the Shadow had feelings for one another, but never acted on them. Rickshaw congratulates Charge on his actions, then orders them to head to a bar.  Once there, they find two guns next to the TV set. Rickshaw appears and reveals he has Cutthroat's sister hostage, then orders Cutthroat to kill the other two in order to save her. Charge and Shadow try to reason with him, but he attacks Charge, bitter about how he was always treated as a sidekick by him. While fighting, he picks up a pair of knives, throwing one onto Shadow's shoulder and slashing Charge across the chest with the other, before Charge drives it into his chest. Cutthroat dies, and, soon after, Rickshaw executes his sister. Charge and Shadow grieve briefly before Charge reveals that he loves Shadow, and that, unlike the other three who each got a power and agelessness from "that thing [that] fell out of the sky", he himself never had any special powers, which is why he had been constantly training and why he has aged over the time they had been apart. He reveals that he can locate Rickshaw and kill him, as he can see them but not hear them, but he needs the location of the next TV set to do so.  When they arrive at the location of the next TV set, Rickshaw orders one to kill the other. Charge tells Shadow that she needs to shoot him in a way that would make it seem as if he died, then he would find and kill Rickshaw while he was distracted monitoring her. She does, unwillingly, and heads out towards the "Last Round". Meanwhile, Charge triangulates his position, then storms his hideout. Rickshaw, shocked to see him alive, is shot by Charge with a shotgun, but manages to activate a failsafe device right before he dies. Charge tells Shadow to head out of town, but she frees the civilians of the Last Round and then finds his map, where he had marked Rickshaw's location. She finds him and helps him to his feet, and they leave the hideout as the timer counts down, with little more than a minute left.  In a [[post-credits scene]], a brief shot shows Cutthroat's eyes suddenly opening.

Android Re-Enactment
 Ermus Daglek (Jeff Sinasac), retired Empathtek Socionics Engineer, uses the defunct factory he's been given by the company in exchange for waiving the rights to his residuals, to manufacture [[android (robot)|android]]s based on his lost love, Candy Droober (Sarah Silverthorne), her father, Franklin Droober (Bill Poulin), her mother, Maureen Droober (Melissa Cline), and his romantic rival, Trace Mayter (Adam Buller).  Deciding that the key moment where he lost any chance of becoming Candy's lover was a dinner party where the real life Trace Mayter humiliated Ermus in front of Candy and her family, he recreates Candy's dining room in a test lab, and goes about simulating the dinner several times, trying different conversational tactics and outfits.<ref></ref>  Frustrated that no attempt yields any result but Candy and Trace becoming lovers, he reprograms the Franklin android to murder the Trace android over dinner.  Having vented his anger, Ermus repairs Trace and goes back to new simulations, unaware that the damage inflicted by Franklin has set off malfunctions in Trace, gradually allowing him to remember the prior simulations and realize what and who he is.<ref></ref>  Trace eventually goes berserk over dinner, beheading Franklin and damaging Maureen, before Candy and Ermus escape to the main laboratory.  Ermus deactivates Candy and, armed with an Ion Disruptor (a ray gun designed to disable androids), goes in search of Trace elsewhere in the lab.  After battling the headless Franklin android, he confronts Trace and forces him to deactivate himself.  Ermus attempts to repair the androids and reprograms Candy to be a [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]].  His attempted seduction of her fails, though, as, even though Ermus has wiped her memory banks, she retains preview files of Trace and is still in love with him.  Enraged, Ermus chains up Trace before reactivating him.  Trace tells Ermus that he's infiltrated the [[mainframe computer]] and broadcast his personality via wireless signal to all the androids.  Ermus sets about to dismember him to sell for scrap, but Trace seals the laboratory, cuts off the [[oxygen]] supply and begins filling it with [[carbon monoxide]].  He agrees to let Ermus live if Ermus will unchain him and re-initiate his motor functions, but when Ermus does so, Trace destroys the mainframe before escaping the complex.  Ermus is forced to call in Kray Facer (Todd Thomas Dark), an Empathtek android hunter, to retrieve Trace.  The two go in search of Trace, but can't find him.  Kray gives Ermus a revolver with explosive tipped bullets, instructing him to shoot Trace in the face if he sees him again.  Ermus returns to the lab which, after the mainframe was destroyed, lost all of its security systems.  He finds the doors unlocked and sees signs of an intruder within.  When he goes to the deactivated Candy android, he finds her inactive form being raped by an apparent transient (Dean Tedesco).  A fight ensues and Ermus winds up shooting the transient with one of the explosive shells.  He finds the transient to be wearing a gold cross which was always worn by Trace.  Not knowing that Trace had discarded the necklace after fleeing the lab, he comes to the idea that the transient must be Trace wearing a new facial mold.  Ermus drags the transient back to the lab and attempts to remove his main processor chip by drilling into the transient's ear.  He realizes his mistake when he finds only blood and brain matter within and, panicking, calls Kray again.  Kray shows up but refuses to have anything to do with what is a blatant murder by Ermus.  After Kray leaves, Ermus finds an empty photograph frame that used to contain a picture of the real Candy Droober, and realizes Trace has likely gone in search of his real-life counterpart's former wife and daughter.  Ermus rides his scooter to [[New Jersey]], where Candy lives with her daughter, Tristan.  The real life Trace died in a car accident some time ago.  Barging into their home, he doesn't find Trace, but Tristan lets slip that the android version was there previously and Ermus decides to wait for his return.  When Trace does come back, Ermus shoots him in the face, as instructed.  Trace says goodbye to his family before dying messily when his head explodes.  Ermus returns to the laboratory, and wires up the corpse of the transient to take Trace's place at dinner.  He recommences the simulations with his heavily damaged family.

Anonymous (2011 film)
 An actor arrives at a theater where he delivers a monologue [[Shakespeare authorship question|questioning]] the lack of manuscript writings of William Shakespeare. [[Ben Jonson]] is making ready to enter the stage.  In a flashback, Ben is running through the streets carrying a parcel and being pursued by soldiers.  He enters the theatre called [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose]] and hides the manuscripts he carries as the soldiers set fire to the theatre.  Ben is detained at the [[Tower of London]] to face the questioning of [[puritan]]ical [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]]. The writings by [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Edward de Vere]] that Robert Cecil thought Ben had, are not found on him.  In a flashback of five years, an adult Edward visits a public theatre, and comments as to how a play can sway people, and thinks that it can be used to thwart the influence of Robert Cecil with Queen Elizabeth concerning her successor.  Robert Cecil wants Elizabeth's cousin, [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]], crowned king.  [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], rumoured to be an illegitimate son of Elizabeth, proclaims to [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]] that he is the worthy heir to the throne.  When Henry shares Robert Devereux's plan with Edward, he warns him that Robert Devereux's actions could lead to civil war if not managed carefully.  Ben is to act as author of Edward's play, ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. At curtain call, William Shakespeare, a "drunken oaf", steps forward to be recognized as the author of the play.  Elizabeth accepts a gift that evokes a memory from forty years before, when the boy, Edward, performed in his own play, ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' as [[Puck (Shakespeare)|Puck]].  The teenage Edward must has secretly written his plays, when his education is entrusted to the puritanical [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil]], father of Robert.  During this time, Edward kills a spying servant and is forced into a marriage with William's daughter, [[Anne Cecil|Anne]].  Edward has an affair with a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth and is banished from court, and eventually learns the name of his illegitimate child with Elizabeth.  Shakespeare discovers that Edward is the real author; he then extorts money from him to keep the secret. Shakespeare builds the [[Globe Theatre]], bans any work by Ben to be performed there, and purports Edward's plays to be his own works.  [[Christopher Marlowe]] finds out about Shakespeare's deal; he is later found with his throat slit.  Ben confronts Shakespeare and accuses him of the murder.  Edward's ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' is to be used to incite a [[The Earl of Essex Rebellion|mob]] that is to march to the palace to champion Essex's claim to the succession.  Simultaneously, Edward would gain access to Elizabeth by sending her his ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' so that he could counsel her to support Robert Devereux.  The plan is set to fail when Ben makes Robert Cecil aware of the play. The mob is stopped at the Bridge, and Robert Devereux and Henry surrender in the palace courtyard when the soldiers fire on them from the parapet.  Robert Cecil tells Edward that Elizabeth has had other illegitimate children, Edward himself being one.  During the private audience with Elizabeth, Edward is told that she will spare Henry, but insists that Edward remain anonymous as the true author of "Shakespeare's" works.  After Elizabeth's death, James of Scotland succeeds as James I of England.  On his deathbed, Edward entrusts a parcel full of his writings to Ben to keep them out of the hands of the royal family.  Robert Cecil hears that the Rose has been destroyed by fire, and Ben is released. Ben finds the manuscripts where he hid them. At a performance of a "Shakespeare" play, James I remarks to Robert that he is an avid theater goer.  Ben would later write the introduction to the collected works purported to be authored by William Shakespeare.

Kaden ([[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]]), the executioner is doubtful of the fighting ability of a mere "doctor." David is locked in a small cell and befriends a fellow fighter in the cell next to his, Taiga ([[Daniel Dae Kim]]), who tells him that he was coerced into participating due to a threat on his wife's life. David reluctantly wins his first fight, and Milla becomes more invested in his success (as she gets paid when he wins). Logan tells David that he will set him free if he wins ten fights in a row.  In order to persuade David to fight again, Kaden reveals that Taiga's wife is in their hands and will be killed if he fails to win his next fight. After David wins, it is revealed that his opponent was Taiga, who was given the same task for his wife. Remorsefully, David kills Taiga, but not before incurring serious wounds of his own. It is then, that David officially accepts Logan's offer, (win ten battles and he will be set free), on one the condition: the tenth and final opponent must be Kaden himself.  Milla begins to feel bad for David after seeing how badly he is hurt and personally attends to his wounds. She becomes closer to him as he fights his next few fights and has him moved to a more comfortable room with more space and a bed. She brings him food and women. After each fight she personally addresses his wounds. Eventually she realizes her attraction to him, dyes her hair black(as was David's wife) and Milla and David have sex.  For the penultimate fight, Kaden arranges for the release of an international serial killer named Brutus Jackson, which leads Logan to believe that Kaden is afraid of David. Before the fight, David tells Milla to contact his brother Sam, who he has not seen since the car accident. She does so, but Sam does not seem to want to hear from David. David defeats Brutus in brutal fight, and Logan is distressed. Logan has a doctor create a serum to inject into David, which will slow him down and make him an easy victim for Kaden in their fight.  Large crowds watch online as Kaden initially pummels David, but much to Logan's surprise, David begins to gain the heavy advantage. As they fight, it is revealed through flash backs that "David Lord" is the assumed named of a secret government agent who was specifically sent to infiltrate The Deathgames. The phone call to "Sam" was in order to alert his superior, Agent McCarty ([[James Remar]]) about his location via phone tracing. It is also revealed that Milla secretly switched Logan's serum with a simple saline solution prior to the fight. A group of soldiers invade the facility and arrest Milla, Kaneko, and Kawaii. Filled with rage after defeating and killing Kaden, David hunts down Logan and corners him in a stockroom. As David is about to strike the deadly blow, soldiers arrive, snapping David out of his murderous fury. Logan escapes.  Agent McCarty consoles David as he deals with the fact that he had to kill so many people and assures him that Logan will be caught. Milla apologizes to David as she is escorted away, and McCarty assures David that she is in good hands.  
Apollo 18 (film)
 In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled ''Apollo 18'' mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. [[Commander]] Nathan Walker, [[Lieutenant colonel]] John Grey, and [[Captain]] Ben Anderson are launched toward the [[Moon]] to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending [[ICBM]] attacks from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].  Grey remains in orbit aboard the ''Freedom'' command module while Walker and Anderson land on the Moon in the lunar module ''Liberty''. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take rock samples. After returning to ''Liberty'', the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of ''Liberty'' despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet [[LK (spacecraft)|LK lander]], and a [[Lost Cosmonauts|dead cosmonaut]] in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission.  The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when ''Liberty'' suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to ''Liberty'' and their flag shredded Walter finds non-human tracks outside "Liberty" Walker cites them as evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of ''Liberty''. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a Moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.  Anderson speculates that the true intention of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices are the source of the interference, only to discover something has destroyed them when they attempt to switch them off. Walker shows signs of a developing infection and he becomes increasingly paranoid. The mission cameras capture the rock samples moving around in the interior of ''Liberty'', revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as Moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within ''Liberty'', but he accidentally damages the system controls, causing ''Liberty'' to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK is  their only source of oxygen, the pair travel to the LK lander in their [[lunar rover]]. Walker causes the vehicle to crash as he runs away, believing he should not leave the Moon, because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth.   Anderson awakens and tracks Walker to the crater where they found the cosmonaut. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but he is confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK. Anderson uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control who connect him to the Department of Defense. The deputy secretary informs Anderson that they cannot allow him to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and incorrectly believe he is also infected. Anderson manages to contact Grey and they make arrangements for Anderson to return to ''Freedom''. Anderson prepares the lander for launch, but Walker arrives, revealing he had survived the alien encounter earlier. However, he is now completely psychotic and demands to be let in. When Anderson refuses to let him in, he tries to break the lander's window with a hammer. Before Walker can enter the vehicle, he is attacked by a swarm of creatures inside his helmet, which causes his head to explode, killing him.  Anderson launches, but the DoD warns Grey that Anderson is infected and orders him to abort the rescue or communication will be cut off, without which the CSM will be unable to return to Earth. The lander's engines shut off as it enters orbit, and it is in free fall. Small rocks within the craft float in the air, some of which reveal themselves to be alien creatures. Anderson is attacked and infected by the creatures, preventing him from controlling the vehicle. Grey tells Anderson that he is moving too fast as the LK speeds towards ''Freedom'', and the space footage ends abruptly, implying a collision.  The film concludes with a statement giving the "official" fate of the astronauts, describing them as having died in various accidents that left their bodies unrecoverable. An epilogue explains that many of the rock samples returned from the previous Apollo missions are now missing.

Arthur (2011 film)
 [[Alcoholism|Boozy]] Arthur Bach and his chauffeur, Bitterman, dress up in [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] costumes for a formal dinner hosted by Arthur's mother, Vivienne. The dinner is intended to announce Arthur as the new chairman of her corporation, Bach Worldwide. Driving to the dinner in a [[Batmobile]], an intoxicated Arthur is chased by police, arrested and released the next day.  Vivienne forms a plan to have her shrewd assistant Susan Johnson marry Arthur to ensure stable leadership and help Arthur's reputation. Arthur initially refuses (citing that he and Susan have nothing in common for a loveless relationship), but is told that he will be cut off from his $950 million [[inheritance]] if he does not marry Susan. He reluctantly agrees and asks Susan's father, Burt Johnson, for permission to marry. Burt agrees, after forcing Arthur against a table saw and warning him not to embarrass Susan.  The next day, Arthur meets Naomi Quinn, an illegal tour guide to whom he becomes attracted because of her free-spirited nature. He arranges his wedding while sneaking around on dates with Naomi. Arthur's nanny, Lillian Hobson – who normally dislikes all of Arthur's choices in women – gets to know and likes Naomi. Arthur learns that Naomi would like to have her children's book about the [[Statue of Liberty]] published. He attempts to find employment and other options so that he will be able to keep seeing Naomi and not need the inheritance, but to no avail.  Hobson takes Arthur to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, where Arthur complains that it is depressing and makes him want to drink. He proclaims he is going to drink, unintentionally brags about his wealth, and turns to leave the meeting. Hobson stands up and takes the bullet, giving Arthur’s humiliating introduction in his place. Arthur, touched, states that if only she would do his drinking for him as well, he would be set.  Arthur goes to see Naomi at her house and tells her the truth – that he is engaged to Susan. Naomi then tells him to leave. Back home, Arthur calls for Hobson, only for Bitterman to come and tell him that she is in bed with a headache. Later, Hobson goes to Naomi and asks her to give Arthur another chance, but she again falls ill and is taken to a hospital. Naomi calls Arthur to tell him what has happened. He comes to the hospital, meets Naomi and is about to make up with her, but Susan arrives and tells Naomi that Arthur has bought the company that is handling the publication of her book. Upset, Naomi leaves the hospital. Hobson comes home and Arthur takes care of her. The two begin to get along better. However, a few days later, Hobson dies in her sleep and Arthur reverts to alcoholism to numb the pain of her death, losing Naomi, and being married to Susan.  At his wedding, Arthur gets drunk and finds Hobson's last letter to him in which she advises him to follow his heart. Arthur decides, during the vows, not to proceed with the marriage. Susan and her father become belligerent and begin punching him, which makes Vivienne realize that the ambitious and conniving Susan is only after her company. Vivienne stops the ruckus, but reminds Arthur of the agreed upon disinheritance if he pursues Naomi. Arthur strips nearly naked to emphasize that he wants no kind of dependency on his mother's money and runs to Naomi's apartment. He tells her that he just lost his mum (meaning Hobson, not Vivienne) but Naomi, still upset with him, says she can't replace Hobson and refuses any prospect of their getting back together.  Six months later, Arthur is now sober. He has got back his inheritance because he is managing the company's charity, and his mother is proud of him for finally taking something seriously (possibly indicating his love for Naomi). He goes to a bookshop to buy Naomi's book – which she has dedicated to him – and sees an advertisement for a book-reading she will be giving at a library. Arthur goes to the library and, this time, Naomi takes him back. The two leave the library and Bitterman drives them through the city in the Batmobile with the police following in pursuit.

Arthur Christmas
 On [[Christmas Eve]], hundreds of [[Christmas elf|Christmas elves]] helm the command centre of [[Santa Claus]]'s mile-wide,<ref name=WiredMaking></ref> ultra-high-tech sleigh-esque craft, the ''S-1''. The current Santa (named Malcolm) and the Christmas elves deliver presents to every child in the world using advanced equipment and military precision. These complex operations are micromanaged by thousands more elves, under the command of Malcolm's militaristic eldest son and heir-apparent Steve, and his obsequious elfin assistant, Peter, at mission control underneath the North Pole. Meanwhile, his younger son - the clumsy, fearful yet enthusiastic Arthur - devotedly answers the letters to Santa. During one of the delivery operations in Germany a child wakes up and almost sees Malcolm due to an accidentally activated toy; in the tense escape operation, a Christmas elf aboard the ''S-1'' inadvertently leans on a button, causing a present to fall from the supply line and go unnoticed.  Having completed his 70th mission, Malcolm is portrayed as far past his prime, and whose role in field operations is now largely symbolic. Nonetheless, he is held in high esteem, and delivers a congratulatory speech to the enraptured elves. Malcolm announces he looks forward to his 71st, much to the frustration of Steve, who had prepared to succeed his father as Santa at the conclusion of this mission. During their family Christmas dinner, Arthur's suggestion for the family to play a board game degenerates into a tense quarrel between Malcolm and Steve, while Malcolm's father and predecessor Grandsanta, bored by retirement, resentfully criticises their over-modernization. After Grandsanta knocks the board off the table, Steve's [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] (a high tech device named a 'HOHO') flashes and he leaves the table in a hurry. Later, their father shares with his wife Margaret his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire.  Arthur follows Steve, and the two learn that a Christmas elf named Bryony Shelfrey found the missed present - a wrapped bicycle for a little girl in England called Gwen, to whose letter Arthur had personally responded. Arthur alerts his father, who is at a loss as to how to handle the situation; Steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable error whose correction can wait a few days, citing this year's Christmas as the most successful in history. Grandsanta on the other hand, on learning of the dire situation, proposes delivering the gift using Evie, his old wooden sleigh, and the great-great-grandchildren of the original eight [[reindeer]], forcefully whisking away a reluctant Arthur and a stowaway Bryony. In the process the three get lost on three different continents, lose several of their reindeer, and land in danger several times, ultimately being mistaken for aliens and causing an international military incident. Through all this, Arthur eventually learns, to his compounding disappointment, that Grandsanta's true motive is to fulfill his ego, Steve refuses to help them out of petty resentment and the possibility of his brother being made hero overshadowing his work, and that his own father has gone to bed, apparently content even though a present was not delivered.  Finally, stranded in Cuba after losing the sleigh, Arthur renews his sense of purpose: that it all comes down to having presents delivered, regardless of how it is done and who did it. With Grandsanta's and Bryony's help, he manages to recover the sleigh. Meanwhile, the elves grow increasingly alarmed at rumours of the neglected delivery and the Clauses' unthinkable indifference, sending them into a panic. In response, Malcolm, Margaret, and Steve take the high-tech sleigh-craft to deliver a superior present... albeit to the wrong child.  Arthur and his company manage to reach England, but lose the remaining reindeer; furthermore a US Predator drone scrambled by Chief De Silva of UNFITA intercepts and opens fire on the sleigh believing them to be aliens. Grandsanta sacrifices the sleigh, while Arthur and Bryony parachute to the ground. Ultimately with Margaret and Bryony's help, all the male Clauses arrive at Gwen's house before she awakens, only to have all but Arthur quarrel about who gets to actually place the gift. Noticing that only Arthur truly cares about the girl's feelings, the elder Clauses collectively realize that he is the sole worthy successor. As a result, Malcolm gives Arthur the honour, and Steve, recognizing his own shortcomings, forfeits his supposed birthright and acknowledges his brother's worthiness to take up the mantle. In a fitting conclusion, Gwen glimpses a snow-bearded Arthur in a wind-buffeted sweater just before he vanishes up into the ''S-1''.  In a [[postscript]], Malcolm goes into a happy retirement with Margaret - where he also becomes Grandsanta's much-desired new companion - and plays Arthur's board game with him for many happy hours. Meanwhile, Steve finds true contentment as the [[chief operating officer]] of the North Pole. Bryony is promoted to Vice-President of Packing, Pacific Division. In a nod to traditionalism once neglected, the high-tech ''S-1'' is re-christened ''EVIE'' in honour of Grandsanta's old sleigh, and refitted to be pulled by a team of five thousand reindeer - led by the original eight, all of whom managed to return home safely via innate navigational abilities. Finally, Arthur happily guides the entire enterprise in the proper spirit as the new Santa.

The Artist (film)
 In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the [[premiere]] of his latest hit film when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' with the headline "Who's That Girl?" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a [[beauty spot]] on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.  Two years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film as well as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 Stock Market Crash]]. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.  Later, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the [[nitrate film]] quickly blazes out of control he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house, to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to sternly remind Valentin of his changing luck.  Peppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that it had been Peppy who had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it's no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a [[Musical film#The classical sound era|musical]] together.  Now the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, "Cut!" to which Zimmer adds: "Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me one more?" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies "With pleasure!" revealing his [[French accent]].<ref name="themarysue"></ref> The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.  
Assassin's Creed: Embers
 The short film follows an elderly Ezio, living a peaceful life in the Tuscan countryside with his wife Sofia and his children Flavia and Marcello and writing his memoirs. One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio then recounts his story of [[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin]], and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if "you lose your way". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.

Asmaa
 Asmaa (Hend Sabry) is a woman in her 40s living with her aging father Hosni (Sayed Ragab) and teenage daughter Habiba (Fatma Adel) in [[Cairo]], and struggling to support them with her meagre earnings from a menial job at [[Cairo International Airport]]. She is HIV-positive and requires surgery on her [[gallbladder]], without which she will die. Doctors refuse her surgery when, on the point of entering the operating theatre, she reveals that she has AIDS.  In a series of flashbacks, the film gradually reveals Asmaa's earlier life in the Egyptian countryside. As an independent, strong-willed, young woman helping her father sell rugs at the village market, she meets, falls in love with and marries Mosaad (Hany Adel), an army conscript serving in the [[Central Security Forces]]. Mosaad inadvertently kills another man in a brawl when he comes to his wife's support in a dispute over her stall at the local market. He is sent to prison for the killing, but the sentence is relatively short to take account of the circumstances. After his release, he refuses to have sex with Asmaa, but does not tell her why, namely that he has contracted AIDS in prison. Eventually his dark secret comes out, but Asmaa is still, lovingly, willing to fulfill Mossad's wish for a son. After Mosaad's death, while Asmaa is pregnant, she agrees that if she gives birth to a son, she will leave him with Mosaad's family, so that the family will have an heir for their land, but that if she gives birth to a daughter, she will leave and take the daughter with her.  The flashbacks contrast with the more subdued life of Asmaa in Cairo, where Asmaa joins an HIV/AIDS support group. The group is approached by self-promoting talk show host Mohsen el-Seesy (Maged el-Kedwany) who tries to persuade Asmaa to appear on his show and to reveal her true identity, arguing that this will enable her to have the operation that will save her life. Asmaa has been living for years with HIV, but only her father knows of her HIV status, and she is terrified to reveal it publicly, especially to her daughter Habiba. Asmaa has been having difficulties at work for a long time. Her employer insists on seeing her medical records, but Asmaa keeps making excuses. Assured that she cannot be legally fired for having AIDS, she finally produces the medical records. Instead of firing her, her employer asks her fellow workers whether they want to continue working with Asmaa, receiving a reluctant but overwhelming negative answer, so Asmaa effectively loses her job without being fired.  A charitable foundation offers to treat Asmaa, if she will say how she caught the disease, but Asmaa refuses. Asmaa is adamant that she won't reveal how she came to be infected by HIV, saying that everyone has a right to be treated. After a long struggle with her dilemma, Asmaa agrees to appear on Mohsen's television show anonymously, but Mohsen succeeds in persuading Asmaa to reveal her identity, leading to an emotional climax for the film.  
Aswang (2011 film)
 Gabriel and Ahnia are on the run from a trio of hitmen who killed their family. The kids attempt to go to their relatives' place to seek help but get lost along the way. They arrive at the wrong town, one that is being constantly attacked by unknown creatures. During one such attack, they are saved by Hasmin, the resident of a local private plantation in the outskirts of town. She takes the kids to her blind elderly friend and foster mother, Guada, who explains to them what the creatures are.  The creatures are called Abuwaks - a type of aswang that look like normal humans but can burrow underground to attack and transform into raven-like birds. It is later explained that the town's corrupt mayor and the Abuwaks have an agreement of sorts wherein the abuwaks pay him money in exchange for keeping the town underdeveloped and misinformed.  The three hired killers, Gido, Queenie and Daniel, arrive at the same town later on to finish their job. Daniel, a reluctant member due to his family being held hostage by their boss Eddie, meets Hasmin, who he tends to run into from time to time.  With the killers finding them, Hasmin decides to slip the kids into the plantation to avoid capture. However, the plantation turns out to be the nest of the Abuwaks, and Hasmin is one of them although she is benevolent towards humans and defiant of her heritage.  The hired killers then track the kids to the plantation and infiltrate the place. Queenie is able to find Gabriel and Ahnia, but she is caught and tortured by the Abuwaks while the kids escape. Hasmin is forced by their leader Moises to eat Queenie alive but she instead breaks her neck in defiance. Gido and Daniel encounter the other Abuwaks, forcing them to retreat. Gido calls Eddie for backup, which will arrive the next day.  Hasmin is able to find Gabriel and Ahnia, but they are caught during their escape. Moises decides that the kids will be eaten the next day - the day when Hasmin will be married to him.  The next day, Hasmin meets with Daniel to seek his help in getting the kids out of the plantation. Shortly afterwards, two Abuwaks enter the town to find Daniel and Gido. Hasmin changes into an Abuwak to cause panic and distraction, allowing Daniel to escape and Gido to kill the two creatures. The townsfolk evacuate in fear of further attacks - an event which aggravates the Abuwaks' existence due to their own dwindling numbers.  Gido, together with his expected backup, enter the plantation and attack. The attack allows Daniel to rescue Gabriel and Ahnia, and at the same time disrupts Hasmin's wedding.  During their escape, however, Daniel is mortally wounded by an Abuwak pursuer and Ahnia is captured. Hasmin arrives and a dying Daniel says that he is not ready to die as he still needs to save his family from Eddie. Hasmin, the only Abuwak with the power to turn humans into Abuwaks, reluctantly turns Daniel into one to allow him to live.  Daniel and Hasmin then attack Moises who is holding Ahnia hostage. They are able to defeat him and escape outside the plantation.  Gido and his team are overwhelmed by the Abuwaks, although they are able to kill most of them. Gido commits suicide by releasing a grenade as he is being eaten.  Daniel, Hasmin, Gabriel and Ahnia are cornered by Eddie outside the plantation. Eddie reveals that he has already ordered some of his men to kill Daniel's family, and that he plans to kill the four of them. Daniel and Hasmin attack and kill Eddie and his henchmen. Gabriel and Ahnia stay with Guada as Daniel and Hasmin travel back to Daniel's hometown.<ref></ref>  
As Luck Would Have It (2011 film)
 Roberto Gómez, a former advertising executive, has been unemployed for several years.  Though he is happily married, he is depressed and feels as if he has failed his family.  His wife, Luisa, attempts to cheer him up as he leaves for an interview with a former business partner and friend, Javier Gándara.  When Roberto arrives, his former co-workers are distant and cold.  Gándara tells him that there are no positions available, and Roberto leaves dejected.  Remembering that his wife wants to vacation at the hotel where they spent their honeymoon, he impulsively drives off to visit it, only to find that it is now the site of a museum and important archeological dig.  As Roberto wanders about the site during an important press event, he panics when he sees security guard Claudio and falls a great distance.  When Roberto discovers that he can not move his head, Claudio tells him that his skull has become impaled upon a spike.  Claudio leaves to get help.  Mayor Alcalde and museum director Mercedes attempt to delay the inevitable media frenzy, but the reporters eagerly descend upon Roberto once they realize there is a greater story than the archeological dig.  Rumors and speculation begin to spread throughout the press, and Roberto's accident is reported as a suicide attempt.  Roberto calls Luisa, and an emergency medical technician refuses to move him for fear of causing further injury.  When nobody will take responsibility for moving him, they call in a medical doctor, Dr. Velasco.  Velasco also refuses to move Roberto, and Mercedes and Alcalde debate how to resolve the situation without damaging either's career.  Due to his failure to provide for his family, Roberto resolves to exploit his situation to make as much money from it as possible.  He hires an agent, Johnny, and the two attempt to sell product placements and exclusive interviews.  Although Luisa is opposed to her husband's plans, she is unable to talk him out of it.  Johnny catches the interest of media executive Álvaro Aguirre, but Aguirre will only pay the sums that Johnny desires if Roberto stays at the site of the accident, as an interview at the hospital is worthless to him.  Aguirre offers several million euros for a posthumous interview, but Johnny is not able to convince him to invest the money without a guarantee.  Luisa becomes concerned that Roberto is spending too much time on financials and not enough on talk to his family; at her urging, he calls their children and requests that they visit him.  Mercedes offers to cut free the spike, but the others stop her when it becomes obvious that it will only injure Roberto.  After deliberating with another physician, Dr. Velasco decides to perform surgery at the site.  Before the surgery, Johnny approaches Luisa and tells her of the offer for the posthumous interview.  Enraged, she fires Johnny and threatens to attack him if he approaches Roberto again.  Roberto, not knowing that she has fired Johnny, inquires as to the progress Johnny has made.  Not wanting to upset Roberto, she tells him that Johnny has signed a contract worth hundreds of thousands of euros.  Happy to have finally provided for his family financially, Roberto gives a heartfelt interview to Pilar Álvarez, a local television reporter handpicked by Luisa.  Álvarez hands the tape to Luisa, knowing that it is worth millions to the proper buyer.  Roberto is lifted from the spike and becomes delirious. Brain damaged, he describes various smells as he bleeds profusely from the wound.  Claudio consoles Luisa as she waits for Dr. Velasco's report.  Some time later, Dr. Velasco grimly reappears.  Roberto's family rush to see him, only to find that he has died during surgery.  The crowd, which has swelled greatly during the media frenzy, collectively reacts with dismay, and many of the people cry.  Aguirre arrives at the museum and personally offers Luisa several million euros for the tape, which she silently and angrily refuses.  
Atlas Shrugged: Part I
 In 2016, the [[United States]] is in a sustained economic [[Depression (economics)|depression]]. Industrial disasters, resource shortages, and gasoline prices at $37 per gallon have made railroads the primary mode of transportation, but even they are in disrepair. After a major accident on the Rio Norte line of the Taggart Transcontinental railroad, CEO [[James Taggart (Atlas Shrugged)|James Taggart]] shirks responsibility. His sister [[Dagny Taggart]], Vice-President in Charge of Operation, defies him by replacing the aging track with new rails made of Rearden Metal, which is claimed to be lighter yet stronger than steel. Dagny, working for the sole purpose of fixing the rail, allows James Taggart to accept the appriasal of the major success.  Dagny meets with its inventor, [[Hank Rearden]], and they negotiate a deal they both admit serves their respective self-interests.  Politician [[Wesley Mouch]]—nominally Rearden's [[lobbyist]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]—is part of a crowd that views heads of industry as persons who must be broken or tamed. James Taggart uses political influence to ensure that Taggart Transcontinental is designated the exclusive railroad for the state of [[Colorado]]. Dagny is confronted by [[Ellis Wyatt]], a Colorado oil man angry to be forced to do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover [[Francisco d'Anconia]], who presents a façade of a [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] grown bored with the pursuit of money. He reveals that a series of [[Copper extraction|copper mines]] he built are worthless, costing his investors (including the Taggart railroad) millions.  Rearden lives in a magnificent home with a wife and a brother who are happy to live off his effort, though they overtly disrespect it. Rearden's anniversary gift to his wife Lillian is a bracelet made from the first batch of Rearden Metal, but she considers it a garish symbol of Hank's egotism. At a dinner party, Dagny dares Lillian to exchange it for Dagny's diamond necklace, which she does.  As Dagny and Rearden rebuild the Rio Norte line, talented people quit their jobs and refuse all inducements to stay. Meanwhile, Dr. Robert Stadler of the State Science Institute puts out a report implying that Rearden Metal is dangerous. Taggart Transcontinental stock plummets because of its use of Rearden Metal, and Dagny leaves Taggart Transcontinental temporarily and forms her own company to finish the Rio Norte line. She renames it the John Galt Line, in defiance of the phrase "Who is John Galt?"—which has come to stand for any question to which it is pointless to seek an answer.  A new law forces Rearden to sell most of his businesses, but he retains Rearden Steel for the sake of his metal and to finish the John Galt Line. Despite strong government and union opposition to Rearden Metal, Dagny and Rearden complete the line ahead of schedule and successfully test it on a record-setting run to Wyatt's oil fields in Colorado. At the home of Wyatt, now a close friend, Dagny and Rearden celebrate the success of the line. As Dagny and Rearden continue their celebration into the night by fulfilling their growing sexual attraction, the shadowy figure responsible for the disappearances of prominent people visits Wyatt with an offer for a better society based on personal achievement.  The next morning, Dagny and Rearden begin investigating an abandoned prototype of an advanced motor that could revolutionize the world. They realize the genius of the motor's creator and try to track him down. Dagny finds Dr. Hugh Akston, working as a cook at a [[diner]], but he is not willing to reveal the identity of the inventor; Akston knows whom Dagny is seeking and says she will never find him, though he may find her.  Another new law limits rail freight and levies a special tax on Colorado. It is the final straw for Ellis Wyatt. When Dagny hears that Wyatt's [[oil field]]s are on fire, she rushes to the scene of the fire where she finds a handwritten sign nailed to the wall that reads "I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours."  Wyatt declares in an [[answering machine]] message that he is "on strike".

Auschwitz (film)
  The film attempts to depict the harsh reality of the process inside the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] by using brutal imagery. Book-ended by documentary footage as well as interviews with German teenagers about what they know about the Holocaust, Boll's intention is to show viewers just how depraved and sadistic life in the camp was.  
Attack the Block
  Walking home on [[Bonfire Night]], Samantha Adams ([[Jodie Whittaker]]), a 25-year-old trainee [[nurse]], is mugged by a small gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest ([[Alex Esmail]]); Dennis ([[Franz Drameh]]); Jerome ([[Leeon Jones]]); Biggz (Simon Howard); and leader Moses ([[John Boyega]]). The attack is interrupted when a [[meteorite]] falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Samantha the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, eyeless dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the corpse to their acquaintance, [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] dealer Ron ([[Nick Frost]]), to get advice on what to do. He lives at the top of their [[tower block]], Wyndham Tower.  Moses asks Ron and his boss, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), to keep the creature in their fortified "[[cannabis|weed]] room" while he decides how to proceed. More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger, with spiky fur which is so black it reflects no light, huge claws and rows of [[Bioluminescence|glowing]] fangs. The aliens kill their dog too. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen and Moses is arrested, identified as the mugger by Samantha. The aliens, following Moses, maul the unarmed officers to death and attack their van, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the police van away, only to crash into a surprised Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman  Enraged by the damage to his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens, until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a recycling bin and Pest is severely bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building, force their way into her flat, and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a [[samurai sword]] through the head. Understanding that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha reasons that it is safer to stay with the gang than on her own and joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat owned by Tia (Danielle Vitalis), Dimples ([[Paigey Cakey|Paige Meade]]), Dionna (Gina Antwi), and Gloria (Natasha Jonas), believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, climbing up the side of the tower block and smashing through the windows, one of whom decapitates Dennis.  After Samantha saves Moses' life from one of the aliens, the girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. In the hall, the gang are attacked by Hi-Hatz and more henchmen. The gang escapes while an alien chases Hi-Hatz and a couple of henchmen into a lift. Hi-Hatz kills the alien, although his henchmen are killed, and continues his search for Moses. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome, however, becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat they find that Hi-Hatz is already there and has been waiting for them. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses but hordes of aliens smash through the window and kill him. Now joined by Brewis ([[Luke Treadaway]]), one of Ron's customers, Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.  Biggz, still trapped in the bin by a lurking alien, is saved by two unruly children, Probs (Sammy Williams) and Mayhem (Michael Ajao), using a water-gun filled with petrol and a flame to torch the creature from a safe distance. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the [[ultraviolet]] light. As a zoology student, Brewis theorises that the aliens are like [[spore]]s, [[Panspermia|drifting through space]] on [[solar wind]]s until they chance on a [[Habitable planet|suitable planet]]. After landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong [[pheromone]] which will attract the male creatures to it so that they can mate and propagate their species in their new world. Brewis suggests that the smaller, hairless alien which Moses killed in the beginning was such a female, and it had left a mating scent on Moses that the larger male aliens have been tracking throughout the evening. The gang form a plan for Samantha, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.  Moses forces Pest to return the ring they stole from her, feeling guilty for having mugged her. Samantha successfully avoids the aliens, turns on the gas, and leaves the block. Moses, with the dead female alien strapped to his back, rushes out of the weed room and into his flat, while the males converge on the scent and chase Moses through the block. Inside his flat he throws the female into the kitchen and the males follow. Using fireworks, Moses ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out of the window. The explosion engulfs the flat and the aliens, but Moses survives, clinging to a [[Union Jack]] hanging from the side of the building. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron are arrested and held responsible for the deaths around the block, including the two officers who had earlier arrested Moses. Samantha, however, comes to their defence. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses.  
Ausente (film)
 The director is vague on certain plot points. In the last images, for example, there is a shot of Sebastián gently kissing Martin on the lips. It is not clear whether this actually happened or only occurred in Sebastián's imagination. It is also unclear whether Martin accidentally fell to his death, or whether it was suicide, driven by Sebastián's rejection. The viewer is kept contemplating if a romantic relationship had occurred, and if it did, if it is immoral in itself regardless of consent.  Reception

The Awakening (2011 film)
 In 1921, Florence Cathcart ([[Rebecca Hall]]) is a published author who works with the police to debunk supernatural hoaxes and thus to expose charlatans. It is revealed that she lost her lover in the war and that she "hunts" ghosts in an attempt to see if it is possible to bring him back. She receives a visit from Robert Mallory ([[Dominic West]]), a teacher from a boys' [[boarding school]] in [[Cumbria]] which had been a private home until twenty years earlier. Robert explains that there have been sightings of the ghost of a child at the school and that such a sighting might have been the cause of the recent death of a pupil. Although Florence initially refuses to help Robert investigate, his concern for the children - whom he describes as being almost like orphans - at the boarding school causes her to change her mind, since she is an orphan herself. At the school, she meets Maud ([[Imelda Staunton]]), the housekeeper, who tells Florence that she has read her books. After she conducts an investigation on her first night at the school, Florence comes to the conclusion that the sightings are the result of a prank, as two pupils had bullied a third into dressing as a ghost. With regards to the recent death, one of the teachers admits that he had forced the deceased pupil to stand outside the school in order to "man up" after he claimed to have seen the ghost, thus scaring the young boy and causing him to have a fatal asthma attack. The school then closes for half-term with the only occupants being Florence, Robert, Maud, and Tom ([[Isaac Hempstead-Wright]]), a pupil whose parents live in India.  Her job done, Florence prepares to leave. Down at the lake, she drops her cigarette case, which belonged to her lover. As she reaches for it, a hand reaches for her from the water. She steadies herself but then allows herself to fall into the lake. Robert rescues her; although Florence assures them it was an accident, he and Maud become concerned about her mental health. Indeed, Florence decides to remain at the school. After chasing what she believes to be the ghost, she sees an apparition of a man with a shotgun, who appears to shoot her. She also hears a child calling "Mowa Zee," which she tells Tom was the nickname some Africans gave to her after she was rescued from the lion that orphaned her as a child. After growing closer, Florence and Robert have sex. But Edward Judd ([[Joseph Mawle]]), the groundskeeper who has a grudge against Robert for being a war hero, becomes jealous and attempts to rape Florence in the woods. Assisted by a supernatural apparition, she kills Judd in self-defence. She then returns to the school and tells Robert, who leaves to bury Judd and thus to cover up the incident. Florence asks Robert not to tell Tom what happened, but Robert tells her that there are no children at the school.  Florence then realizes that Tom is the ghost that is haunting the school. Buried memories begin to surface, and she remembers that her family lived at the boarding school when it was a home. As a child, she watched her father murder her mother with a shotgun before he attempted to kill her too. Florence hid inside the walls of the house as her father pursued her, calling out for his "little Mousy." Aiming for her, her father instead killed Tom, who is revealed to have been his illegitimate son. Her father then killed himself while Florence watched. Traumatized, Florence had replaced these memories with memories of a childhood in Africa. Back in the present, Florence learns that Robert can see the ghosts of his friends who died in the war, and she comes to the conclusion that ghosts reveal themselves to those who are very lonely. She also learns that Maud was her nanny as a child, as well as the mother of Tom. Maud explains that she arranged for Florence to come to the school in the first place because Tom missed her. Maud then poisons herself and Florence, intending for their ghosts to join Tom. Florence tells Tom that her soul will not rest if she dies now, so Tom brings her medicine.  The following scene shows Florence walking throughout the school. She passes by several adults on her way out, but none notice her. Florence catches up to Robert and shares a cigarette with him. Florence explains that being unable to see ghosts anymore is not the same as forgetting them. She then asks Robert to tell their driver to pull up to the end of the drive since she has always enjoyed the walk, and that she will see him on Saturday. The couple exchange a kiss, and Robert watches her walk away.  In an interview with director Nick Murphy, he has confirmed the status of Florence at the end of the movie:  "This film is about people seeing what they need to and seeing what they need to is carrying forth of the film and as such, I wanted to give audiences that chance at the end. Yeah, I know what she is. Rebecca and I decided she’s alive and then she smokes and she gets a car." <ref></ref>

Badri promises Alakananda that he would bring her back to [[Badrinath Temple]] for success in her love, unaware that he is the object of her love in the first place.  As per the promise, Badri goes to [[Bellary]] to free Alakananda from the clutches of Sarkar, who is planning to fix the marriage, and escort Alaknanda back to the holy shrine. Sarkar leads his goons to Badrinath and destroys Bheeshma Narayan's [[ashram]]. On the other hand, Badri fights with all the goons and escorts Alakananda to Badrinath. Sarkar vows revenge on Badri as Nani is severely hurt in the process by Badri. Subsequently, Sarkar and his wife ([[Ashwini Kalsekar]]) decide to go to Badrinath and take back Alakananda after killing him.  Feeling that Badri is the real traitor and loves Alakananda, Bheeshma Narayan orders Badri to vacate Badrinath Temple. Meanwhile, Alakananda is being taken away by Sarkar's men, and she proposes to Badri to which he rejects as he has dedicated his life to his guru. After seeing Alakananda's pure love for Badri, Bheeshma Narayan is moved and orders Badri to bring her back and marry her. Following his guru's orders, Badri fights off Sarkar and his goons, saves Alakananda, and finally marries her.

Bad Teacher
 Elizabeth Halsey is an immoral English teacher at John Adams Middle School (JAMS) in Cook County, Illinois. She is foul-mouthed  and greedy, drinks alcohol heavily, smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and shows movies while sleeping through class. She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fiancé Mark, but must resume her job when he dumps her after learning she is only after his money. Elizabeth tries to win over substitute teacher Scott Delacorte, who is also wealthy because his family runs a watch company. Amy Squirrel, a dedicated and enthusiastic colleague, also pursues Scott while the school's gym teacher, Russell Gettis, makes it clear that he is interested in Elizabeth romantically, and she is not interested in him because he is a gym teacher.<ref></ref>  Early in the film, Elizabeth plans to get surgery to [[Breast augmentation|enlarge her breasts]], and becomes all the more motivated to do so once she learns Scott's ex-girlfriend had large breasts. However, when she tries to schedule an appointment for her breast surgery, she cannot afford the $9,300 procedure. She feels worse when Scott admits that he is interested in Amy, and that he only likes Elizabeth as a friend. Elizabeth attempts to raise money for the surgery by participating in her 7th grade class car wash in provocative clothing and by manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy, acting on the growing resentment between them due to Elizabeth pursuing Scott and ignoring school rules, attempts to warn the principal about Elizabeth's [[embezzlement]] scheme, but he dismisses her claims as groundless.  Elizabeth later learns from her best friend, Lynn Davies, that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores will receive a $5,700 bonus. With this knowledge, Elizabeth decides to change her style of teaching, forcing the class to intensely read and study ''To Kill A Mockingbird'' for the upcoming test. However, the change is too late and insufficient. The students receive low scores on their quizzes, frustrating her even more. Meanwhile, she befriends Russell the gym teacher as Amy and Scott start dating. Desperate to pay off the procedure for her breast surgery, Elizabeth steals the state test answers by disguising herself as a journalist and seducing Carl Halabi, a state official who is in charge of creating and distributing the exams. Elizabeth gets Carl drunk and convinces him to take her to his office to have sex, but she spikes his drink and steals a copy of the answers. A month later, Elizabeth's class aces the test and she wins the bonus, giving her the funds needed to get her breasts enlarged.  When Elizabeth learns that Amy and Scott are chaperoning an upcoming field trip, she smears an apple with [[poison ivy]] and leaves it for Amy, who ends up with her face breaking out in blisters, so she cannot go. On the trip, Elizabeth seduces Scott. They [[non-penetrative sex|dry hump]] and Elizabeth secretly calls Amy using Scott's phone leaving a message recording all the action, ensuring she knows about the affair. However, Elizabeth ultimately finds Scott unsatisfying. On a field trip, her student Garrett is embarrassed and ridiculed by his classmates after publicly confessing his unrequited love for a classmate named Chase. Elizabeth consoles him afterwards and tells him how she is too superficial to return his interest, which causes Elizabeth to reflect on her own superficial ways. To stop the other students from making fun of Garrett, she helps by giving him her bra and telling everyone she caught a student from another school giving him a [[handjob]].  Left behind at the school, Amy switches Elizabeth's desk with her own to trick the janitor into unlocking Elizabeth's sealed drawer. Amy finds Elizabeth's journalist disguise and the practice test, which leads her to suspect Elizabeth cheated on the state exam. Amy informs the principal and gets Carl to testify against her. However, Elizabeth took embarrassing photos of Carl while he was drugged and, with the help of her roommate, Kirk, uses them to blackmail him to say she is innocent. Having failed to expose Elizabeth's cheating, Amy accuses her of drug use, based on a tip from a student. When the police arrive and bring their sniffer dog to search the school, they find Elizabeth's mini liquor bottles, [[marijuana]] and [[OxyContin]] pills in Amy's classroom, in a secret compartment in Elizabeth's desk which Elizabeth helpfully points out to the police. At the end of the school year, Amy is moved to another school in the county by the superintendent. Scott asks Elizabeth to start over, wanting a relationship with her, but Elizabeth rejects him to be with Russell, who she has learned she has a lot in common with.  When the new school year starts, Elizabeth has not gotten the breast enlargement after all, because she feels that she looks fine the way she is. She also has a new position as the school's [[School counselor|guidance counselor]].

As she dies in his arms, Mike notices she bought a pregnancy test, and assumes that she may have been having an affair. Overcome by grief from her death, Mike develops a case of writer's block. He suffers a series of nightmares about his wife and their summer home on Dark Score Lake in Maine. On advice from his brother, Sid, Mike takes a trip to the summer house.  Once there, he meets a young widow named Mattie Devore and her 6-year-old daughter, Kyra. Befriending them, he earns the ire of Mattie's estranged father-in-law Max Devore. Max has been trying to get custody of Kyra since Mattie shot his son Lance (Lance was trying to drown the child). Despite the turmoil, Mike begins to write again, but visions and nightmares lead him to believe he isn't alone. He finds that his wife's spirit is with him. He also detects the spirit of a 1930s singer named Sara Tidwell who plays records of her music. Sara also appears in dreams that Mike has of her last day alive in 1939. During his stay at the lake, Mike learns about "Dark Score Crazy," an apparent form of madness that caused several men in the town to murder their daughters by drowning them.  Max and his assistant attack Mike while he is in the lake. Afterwards, Max gives Mike an offer that he will stop the custody battle for Kyra if Mike agrees to leave them alone and not press charges. Mike agrees to it, and Max after that commits suicide. At the funeral, Mike meets Edgar White, an old friend of his grandfather. Edgar confesses to Mike that Edgar, Mike's grandfather, and two other men assisted Max with the rape and murder of Sara Tidwell and the drowning of her daughter, Keisha. With her dying breath, Sara cursed the boys' descendants to drown their own daughters in retribution for drowning Keisha. The boys buried Sara with her daughter in the woods.  Mike tells Mattie the story. Mattie concludes that since Jo was pregnant, she returned to Dark Score and spent time investigating the curse on Mike's bloodline, not cheating on him as he hypothesized. Mattie is suddenly shot and killed in a manner that Mike saw in a dream, but before she dies she begs him to take care of Kyra. Mike is chased back to his home by Mattie's killers who turn out to be descendants of Sara's attackers obsessed with fulfilling the curse, but he escapes when they are caught by surprise and killed by a falling sign during a storm. Mike tries to console Kyra and puts her to bed. Max's spirit angrily compels Mike to drown Kyra in fulfillment of the curse, but Mattie's spirit struggles to thwart him. Mike takes refuge in his office, where he finds clues left by Jo in the story he had been writing, directing him to douse Sara and Keisha's remains with [[lye]] to end the curse.  A tree that had been transformed into the figure of a woman marks the burial site. Mike returns to this tree to recover the remains, but the haunted tree attempts to deter him. Jo appears and distracts Sara, allowing Mike time to use the lye to dissolve the bones. Sara's spirit is appeased and the tree returns to normal. Mike says a final goodbye to Jo. He returns home to find Kyra in the bathtub, and he is attacked by Max's assistant who tries to kill them both. Mike kills her, and Mattie's spirit appears before them. Mattie tells Kyra that she is safe and that Mike will take care of her. The next morning, Mike announces that he intends to adopt Kyra as his own daughter.  
Baishe Srabon
 Several murders have taken place throughout [[Kolkata]], for which a [[serial killer]] is believed responsible. The murderer strikes in accordance with verses of [[Bengali poetry]], which he leaves next to the victims. The police are baffled; chief detective Abhijit Pakrashi ([[Parambrata Chatterjee]]) struggles to solve the case, which takes a toll on his relationship with girlfriend Amrita Mukherjee ([[Raima Sen]]). Pakrashi's superior ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]) brings back an ex-cop, Prabir ([[Prosenjit Chatterjee]]), to help solve the case. Prabir, earlier suspended for his violent methods, is notoriously ill-tempered and foul-mouthed. Prabir and Pakrashi work together, while Amrita (a television journalist) and colleague Surya Sinha ([[Abir Chatterjee]]) research serial killers for a series whose thirteenth-and-final episode will be about a contemporary murderer. Meanwhile, eccentric poet Nibaron Chakraborty ([[Gautam Ghosh]])—who considers himself part of the [[Hungry Generation]]—wanders Kolkata at night reciting poems.  Researching serial killers, Amrita visits a prison where the warden remembers Rafique Ahmed and his only confidant in 18 years of imprisonment: Nibaron Chakraborty. She and Surya go to Nibaron's house to question him; after being greeted by his servant, Swapan, they are convinced he is insane when Nibaron says he has a meeting with "Rabindranath". They almost succeed in learning about Rafique when Surya angers him by mentioning the book-fair arson for which he was imprisoned.  While investigating the case, Pakrashi sees Amrita and Surya together. Jealous and drunk, Abhijit goes to Prabir's house and pours out his heart; he tells Prabir that he lost his father at a young age, and tries to avoid alcohol because of what it did to his father. Prabir tells Pakrashi that he went to work the day after losing his wife and child, encouraging him to be strong. Surya takes Amrita to a cemetery, telling her he would propose in a few days. They end up in a police station after a police officer sees them (and is slapped by Amrita). Pakrashi, still tipsy, rescues them when the inspector recognises Amrita as his girlfriend and they reconcile.  The next day, while randomly discussing poets and poems, Prabir and Pakrashi deduce that the killer strikes on the death anniversaries of well-known Bengali poets. When they search all possible days the killer could strike, they discover that the next date is 29 June: [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]]'s death anniversary.  Amrita tells Pakrashi what she and Surya have been doing, including the interview with Nibaron. This convinces him that Nibaron is the killer, especially when Swapan tells Prabir he is now afraid of his employer.  Pakrashi and Prabir watch Nibaron's house on the fateful night. A hooded figure comes out; it is Swapan, fleeing. In the house they discover that Nibaron has committed suicide, and the case is closed.  After a month or so, [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s death anniversary (''Baishe Srabon'') arrives. Prabir invites Pakrashi to meet a man named Rabindranath, and Pakrashi is surprised that "Swapan" is Prabir's servant Kaanai. Prabir admits that he was the mastermind behind the murders, with Kaanai (an ex-convict) carrying them out. He wanted to avenge the police force for his suspension, which he considered an insult to his hard work despite the loss of his family. After saying that today's would be the final killing, he shoots himself.

Instead, she resides with her remarried mother and stepfather in a gated property on the outskirts of Lima, cared for primarily by servants while they travel abroad.  The film begins with a picture show and an unseen narrator recounting the fatal sacrifices former Peruvian military leaders made for their country. The scene then cuts to a classroom full of girls as a siren suddenly goes off and the children are evacuated from the building. A driver picks her up from school referring to her as Miss Cayetana, but she is unfazed by the status and remains mostly silent on the way home though at one point when a beggar approaches car she offers him her medication and comments that it suppresses the appetite.  At home later, Cayetana sits alone at the table in front of a full plate of food and doesn't touch it at all, until a maid scolds her and clears the table. The maids fuss over her in the morning so that she looks pretty for her mother's return, but she has to be dragged out of the closet in which she is hiding to go meet her mother because she doesn't want to see her. Eventually, she sits stiffly on her mother's lap as her stepfather looks on and gives her gifts,but the reunion doesn't last long when Cayetana reacts to her mother's pregnancy news by storming out of the room into her bedroom. She then decides to run away,but gets lost and is forced to return home. It is then she decides to punish her mother by withdrawing all affections and dying on the baby's delivery date.  At school, her cousin Jimena, who is chronically ill, is a source of companionship and reprieve, following her to the bathroom when she dumps her lunch in the trash and offering to share her own lunch. Cayetana withdraws even deeper into herself and begins to act out at home. Her worried parents' send her away on vacation to Lima with Jimena's family after the holiday festivities, not knowing what else to do with her.  The vacation is pleasant with boating, swimming, playing on the beach with Jimena, and leisurely meals. For the first time in a long while, Cayetana is truly content and happy, until her mother and stepfather arrive unannounced hoping to surprise Cayetana. She refuses to hug or even speak to her by now noticeably pregnant mother. Jimena suffers a medical emergency one night and is whisked off to hospital leaving Cayetana to wander the beach alone eventually climbing a very steep sand dune and experiencing a hallucination/vision of the Peruvian heroes and Jimena, who tells her that she loves and will always watch over her.  When Cayetana is dropped off at vacation's end it is obvious that the political situation has worsened significantly, as her house has been robbed. Soon Cayetana's mother and stepfather leave for the hospital, leaving her once again with the servants. A few days later, she is taken to the hospital and dropped off to see her newborn half-brother. While there she wanders the wards aimlessly ending up outside the door of Jimena's room where a doctor is testing the latter with coordination exercises and helps Jemina do the test by miming the actions unseen by the doctor. It is clear that Jimena's mind is no longer all there and she is incredibly weak, not recognizing Cayetana at all. When Cayetana finally makes her way to the maternity ward and nursery,she picks the wrong baby out as her mother's son for some reason and hisses with obvious jealousy that she will not be upstaged by him. She no longer wants to die. From there she goes into where the babies are kept in the hospital and finds her new baby brother.

One of the two reporting police officers shoot him and take him in their squad car, but a dazed and bleeding Wayne maneuvers his handcuffed hands in front of himself, and demands the police get out.

Batman soon works up the ladder, even attacking Flass while he was accepting a bribe.

Barbie: A Fairy Secret
 Barbie is at the premiere of her latest movie along with her actor friend Ken, when her rival and co-star, Raquelle, steps on her dress, ripping it. Her stylists, Carrie and Taylor, who are secretly fairies, use magic to mend it. Crystal, a photographer, greets Carrie and Taylor and, taking one last picture of Ken, leaves to go back to Gloss Angeles. Crystal shows Princess Graciella the pictures she took at the premiere. She gives the Princess some tea in which she secretly mixed a love potion. Due to the potion's effects, her eyes color changes from blue to purple. Crystal then shows the Princess the picture of Ken she took, and Graciella falls in love with him almost instantly.  The next day at Wally’s restaurant, Barbie angrily confronts Raquelle about the dress-stepping incident. During the facade, Princess Graciella, Crystal, and two assistant fairies unexpectedly show up and kidnap Ken. Carrie and Taylor sprout their wings and attempt to stop the Princess from taking Ken, but the portal to Gloss Angeles closes before they can enter it. The stylists attempt to dissuade Raquelle and Barbie of the fact that they just saw fairies, but finally admit their existence. They explain that Ken is in trouble because if a human marries a fairy, the human has to stay in Gloss Angeles forever. Meanwhile, in Gloss Angeles, Ken and the Princess arrive in the royal palace, where they meet Zane, Graciella’s boyfriend. Zane is outraged at Graciella's new love interest and challenges Ken to three consecutive duels.  Barbie, Raquelle and the fairies go to a clothing store, where they enter a Fairy Flyway (a fairy method of transport), which leads them to the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The fairies reveal that Lilianna Roxelle, a world famous fashion critic, is the oldest and wisest fairy living on Earth. After they arrive at Lilianna’s home, she informs them that Princess Graciella is under a love potion spell. She gives Barbie an antidote that will turn the Princess back to normal if it rains down on her. It is also revealed that Taylor and Carrie were banished from Gloss Angeles earlier due to some personal reasons. The girls then take Liliana's portal to continue their journey.  Barbie, Raquelle, Taylor, and Carrie make it to Gloss Angeles and they make a stop to Wings and Things in order to get wings for Barbie and Raquelle where they run into the human owner named Reena and her fairy husband Graylon. They then disguise themselves as cooks to try to reveal Princess Graciella about Crystal's love potion; however, Crystal reveals Taylor and Carrie by recognizing Taylor's shoes, and the princess locks the four in furyspheres. Barbie and Raquelle talk and finally figure out their misunderstanding. The reason Raquelle has always been so mean to Barbie is because she never got the chance to be Barbie's friend. They apologize to each other and become friends. Their reconciliation breaks the furyspheres and their wings become real, and they now realize that forgiveness lets them fly. The two then go to stop the wedding between Graciella and Ken, holding off the attendants and the princess. Finally, Barbie pours the antidote over Graciella, curing her from the love potion. Graciella realizes that it was Crystal who gave her the love potion and apologizes for the misunderstanding. She also explains that the reason she banished Taylor and Carrie is because the three of them were once friends but Taylor and Carrie started spending so much time together that she felt left out and betrayed. At the urging of Barbie and Raquelle, she lifts Taylor and Carrie's ban, and the three fairies forgive each other. Graciella then punishes Crystal by having her clean up after the ceremony, and goes to marry Zane.  After the wedding, Graciella tells Barbie and Raquelle that their wings will disappear when they and Ken go back to the human world, and then reappear when they return to Gloss Angeles. She also tells them that their memories of their adventures here will also be erased. Graciella sends them back to Earth with magical dust. The next morning, Barbie wakes up with no recollection of Gloss Angeles or the fairies, thinking it was a dream just as Graciella predicted. However, she and Raquelle are now friends. Back at Wally’s, Carrie and Taylor tell the two that they reconnected with an old friend (Princess Graciella) and are going back to their hometown (Gloss Angeles). In the last scene, Carrie and Taylor turn into fairies and fly back through the portal.

At the ceremony, Miss Privet explains that the princesses will get real crowns after successfully completing the semester. Another teacher at the school, Dame Devin, declares that she will quit her job instructing at the Princess Charm School after her daughter, Delancy, who is also attending the school, becomes the new princess of Gardania at the end of the semester. She goes on to explain that both she and her daughter have lived at the royal palace since her sister-in-law, Queen Isabella, and her family died in a car crash many years ago. Isla and Hadley, seated with the rest of their fellow students, tell Blair about a well known legend which claims that not everyone from the Royal Family had died in the crash.  After the ceremony, each student has a curtsying class before dismissal for the evening, and Blair gets distracted by Hadley and Isla's continued tale and bumps into Delancy, who seems to have already developed quite a strong dislike for Blair, and openly expresses her disdain over the school's lottery system of allowing commoners to enroll. Isla and Hadley comfort Blair, telling her that they are positive that Blair can do anything that Delancy can do.  The next day, Blair's momentary confidence instantly becomes unraveled upon witnessing Delancy being able to walk about with a tall stack of books on her head without any sort of difficulty during one of their lessons, when she, herself, can't even balance one. Many of the other girls, however, do have a few problems, themselves, but Dame Devin, the lesson's instructor, seems to be more keen upon singling out Blair the most. However, upon getting a better view of Blair's face, Dame Devin becomes immediately, and curiously shocked. She then ruthlessly tells her to get out of her class and states that a commoner like her doesn't belong at such an establishment.  Later on, at lunch, Delancy, inspired by her mother's viciousness, makes her sprite assistant Wickellia secretly tuck a piece of tablecloth into Blair's skirt while she, Isla, and Hadley unknowingly continue on within their meals. As a result, Blair ends up being further embarrassed with herself when she unexpectedly drags each girl's trays clear off the table upon standing.  Back within their dorm room, Isla and Hadley try to cheer up Blair by telling her that Dame Devin, herself, was once a lottery winner, as well. However, none of the princesses at that time had selected her to be their Lady Royal, not even Queen Isabella.  Afterwards, a knock upon their door is heard, and Hadley goes to open it, revealing a struggling Grace holding onto a large care package addressed to Blair, from her sister Emily. Inside are various letters and other items, including a drawing depicting a baby Blair being left on their mother's doorstep. Blair explains to her curious friends that she is adopted, and so is Emily, and that the drawing is in reference to a tale which is a favorite of Emily's (told to her by their mother), in which Blair had suddenly been found upon their mother's doorstep when she was just a year old. Miss Privet, who arrives at the girls' dorm room in order to tell Blair a bit of bad news regarding her continued enrollment, then stops herself from doing so upon unintentionally eavesdropping.  The following day, this time at a ballroom dancing class, Blair continually manages to step onto the toes of Delancy's friend, Portia, who is Blair's dance partner. As a result, Blair is kept behind after class by Miss Privet, who was the class instructor. Now alone, she tells Blair that Dame Devin wanted her to be expelled, a desire which had almost been granted; however, Miss Privet admits to Blair that she is aware of her personal reasons for wanting to become a Lady Royal (which is solely to support her family even better), and so decides to tutor her personally. She then explains to Blair that each lesson her students learn simply isn't for superficial reasons, but rather to instill a better sense of character and confidence within each girl.  As wintertime arrives, the Charm School students are one day joined by the young men from the "Prince Charming Academy" (the male counterpart to their own establishment) for one of their dance classes. Blair inevitably gets partnered with a young prince-to-be named Nicholas, who appears to be more or less similar to her. As a result, the two seem to hit it off, as they share various jokes with one another while dancing. Jealous, as she had been hoping to dance with Nicholas herself, Delancy trips Blair in order to once again humiliate her. Thankfully, Nicholas helps Blair to quickly recover, as the two lead the overall group (sans Delancy). When they are done, the men leave, much to the regret of the women, but Miss Privet assures them that they will again return in order to attend both the graduation ceremony and Delancy's coronation ceremony as the princess of Gardania at the end of the semester.  With the ceremony only two days away, where both the princesses and Lady Royals will be crowned, Miss Privet announces that the girls will get to spend another one of their table manners classes within the palace this time. Blair, Hadley and Isla go with their sprites (along with the rest of their fellow students) to pamper themselves within the school spa as a preparatory treat, while Dame Devin secretly instructs Wickellia to rip up the girls' uniforms (without which they cannot attend any class). Meanwhile, Isla and Hadley continue to tell Blair more legends about the Royal Family, including one about Gardania's magic crown, which lights up when put upon the head of the rightful heir to the throne.  The girls head back to their room to find their uniforms torn to shreds. As both Isla and Hadley lament over the fact that they cannot attend class without them on, and that missing any class will result within an immediate F grade, Blair, having now grown a bit more confident over time, creates some new, personalized uniforms using leftover fabric from the old ones.  Having made it to the palace in time, Blair, Isla, Hadley, and the rest of the students are awarded a bit of free time to explore the first floor before their class starts. While doing so, the trio mysteriously find a portrait of ''Blair'', which actually turns out to be Princess Isabella, when she was eighteen years old, the same age as Blair. The girls then see a portrait of the entire Royal Family: Queen Isabella, her husband, King Reginald, a puppy which Blair is stunned to realize is actually Prince, the dog, and a young baby girl in the Queen's arms.  Upon further inspection of the portrait, Hadley and Isla begin to surmise that perhaps Blair could be the baby from the picture, and proceed to ask her when exactly it was that her mother found her as a baby. Blair reveals the date to be April 26, a date which had also become her birthday when her mother found her on her doorstep, as she didn't know her actual date-of-birth. Stunned, yet now more convinced than ever that their suspicions are correct, both Isla and Hadley reveal to Blair that April 26 was the very same day that the Royal Family perished in that car accident. They then say that perhaps Princess Sophia didn't die with the King and Queen, after all, but rather had been found and left in front of somebody else's door to be raised.  This hypothesis also makes them realize that this was the most probable reason why Dame Devin and Delancy have continually been so unfair to Blair, because she and Princess Sophia are both the same person, and thus, is the rightful heir to the throne of Gardania. Unbeknownst to the trio, Delancy has eavesdropped upon the entire conversation, and promptly becomes disturbed by the news, as her mother had never told her these things.  Later on at class, Dame Devin reveals to her students her intentions for Gardania (which she passes off as Delancy's) once her daughter is made princess: to bulldoze the underdeveloped areas of the land and create parks in their place, in order to make the overall kingdom more beautiful. Blair is shocked by this, and informs her that her family lives there, but Dame Devin heartlessly remarks that she should have left the school immediately in order to move her family to a new home in time, not at all caring that such an act would be impossible for them, as they have no money. Blair attempts talk to Delancy to see sense, but she remains silent, worried about what her mother will further do when she is a princess.  Blair runs away to her room, feeling heartbroken and utterly devastated. She then packs up her belongings and prepares to leave the school once and for all; however, upon gazing at the drawing that Emily sent her before, she decides to stay and fight back against Dame Devin.  Meeting back up with Hadley and Isla, Blair informs them that she intends to locate the magical crown so that she can use it to prove that she is the rightful heir, and thus successfully foiling Dame Devin's plans for good. Her friends naturally volunteer to help, and so the trio plan to go back to the palace later that night to search for it, before the graduation and coronation the following day.  That evening, before the girls can leave, a fire alarm suddenly goes off. The students all go outside accordingly, while Dame Devin secretly places three pieces of her jewelery within Blair, Hadley and Isla's dorm room in order to implicate them and finally have them expelled. Delancy sees her leaving the room and becomes suspicious, but her mother quickly changes the subject by asking her why she suddenly has a customized uniform like Blair and her friends, to which Delancy coolly explains it's simply because she likes the way it looks.  A little more than half an hour later, the students can finally go back into their rooms, but Blair, Isla and Hadley are abruptly stopped by a guard, Dame Devin, and Miss Privet. They are then accused of stealing Dame Devin's jewelery, about which they naturally dispute. However, upon searching their dorm room, the guard successfully locates each missing valuable.  The girls are then to be detained until after the coronation ceremony. However, while the guard is taking them away, Delancy suddenly approaches and stops him, claiming that she wishes to carry out their punishment herself, and as she is to be princess within just a few hours, she says he will have to follow her orders. At first hesitant to listen to her, he obliges and she asks Blair if she is really Princess Sophia, to which Blair says that she believes she is. Delancy then quickly hands over a map of the palace basement where the magical crown is located, further revealing to them that she is assisting their efforts because she wants to do what is right for the kingdom. Before parting ways, she also tells them she will leave a window open on the third floor of the palace for them to enter through, and then runs off back to her room, as her mother believes her to be asleep.  Blair, Hadley and Isla head back to the palace, and find Prince thankfully distracting another guard for them. They then use a rope from their bag to climb up to the third floor window, before taking an elevator inside to the basement. Hadley notices devices on the walls within the room, and recognizes them as invisible laser alarms which will set off its detection if any are stepped through. Blair carefully blows a bit of makeup powder towards the lasers in order to make them become visible. Hadley, the most athletic of the three, uses some of her impressive gymnastic abilities in order to bypass the beams and make it to the other side, while both Blair and Isla make a far more slower trek across, with some help from Grace.  After clearing the lasers, there is a keypad which needs a password to unlock a vault door which most probably contains the magical crown, so they try the date of Delancy's coronation. However, the password is incorrect, and so they use the hint (''"The day it all fell into place"'') to figure out the real password. They then try the date of the car crash and it works. Inside the room are several of Dame Devin's possessions. Blair and her friends eventually find the magical crown, but Dame Devin finds them, and makes Brock, her guard, seize the crown from them. She then locks them inside and changes the password, with Isla memorizing the tune of the pressed buttons.  The girls are stuck within the vault for several hours, right up to when the coronation begins and Delancy is mere moments away from being officially crowned. Seeing that they have yet to arrive, she figures out how to stall the proceedings while Blair and her friends try to find a way to escape. Isla, meanwhile, keeps humming the tune of the keypad buttons, and Hadley, who had been attempting to pry open the vault doors with a sword she had found, accidentally knocks the cover off a nearby box of electrical wires.  Seeing this and realizing that it is most likely connected to the vault's stored password, they wire up Blair's phone to the keypad to use her phone buttons to enter the password from inside of the room. Isla, having memorized the new password, she carefully hums out the tune before entering it onto the phone. Successful, they finally make their hurried escape.  The girls arrive at the graduation ceremony just in time, and Blair confidently makes an open claim to the throne, stating that she is Princess Sophia. Emily and her mother, who are watching the action on TV, gasp in shock.  The royal judge, who crowns the princesses and Lady Royals, takes Blair seriously, but Dame Devin, now furious, tries to stop her. They begin to fight over the crown, before Delancy manages to catch it and then has to decide whether to give it to her mother or to Blair. In the end, she chooses to give it to Blair, and when she puts it on, it immediately illuminates and transforms her appearance magically, to look more like a princess, much to Dame Devin's shock. The students are convinced that Blair is Princess Sophia.  Dame Devin, amidst her outrage, unknowingly and publicly exclaims that she was the one who had Queen Isabella and King Reginald murdered in the car crash just so that Delancy could become the queen instead of Blair, shocking everyone (including Blair's mom and Emily). Dame Devin tries to say otherwise, but the judge who was angered by her involvement in Isabella's murder orders for her to be arrested. A disheartened Delancy watches on as Devin is dragged away as she swears vengeance. At Miss Privet's prompting, Blair makes a quick, introductory speech, telling the people of Gardania that she is honored to be their princess. Miss Privet then tells her that now is the time when she must select a Lady Royal, and Blair, in gratitude, chooses Delancy, who is delighted and then crowned.  Later that evening, at the graduation party, everyone dances to one of Isla's songs, "We Rule This School," which she was reluctant to play from the beginning. Even Miss Privet dances along with her students, while the now Prince Nicholas arrives and meets up with Blair again. He states that he is unsure of whether to call her Blair or Princess Sophia, but she assures him that she wants to continue going by the name "Blair."  The new Lady Royal, Delancy, then announces that the Princess has some special visitors, which are revealed to be Emily and her mother. Blair welcomes them to their "new home". Emily then asks Blair if, since Blair is now a princess, does that also make her one, as well. Blair warmly tells her: "Of course; there's a princess in every girl," before stating that she wishes to introduce both she and their mother to everyone as the credits roll.

Battle: Los Angeles
 On August 12, 2011, large masses thought to be [[meteor]]s land in the oceans near major [[coast]]al cities. The objects are discovered to be spacecraft containing hostile [[extraterrestrial life]]. As [[Los Angeles]] is being evacuated, Marines from [[Camp Pendleton]] arrive, including [[Staff Sergeant]] Michael Nantz, an [[Iraq War]] veteran. Nantz was to begin retirement, but because of the attack, he is made the acting [[platoon sergeant]] for 1st Platoon, Echo Company, of the [[2nd Battalion 5th Marines]].<ref name="film"/>  Under the command of [[2nd Lieutenant]] William Martinez, the platoon arrives at [[Santa Monica Airport]], now a [[Forward Operating Base]]. The alien ground forces have no apparent air support, so the Air Force prepares to carpet bomb the [[Santa Monica]] area, and the platoon is tasked with rescuing civilians from an [[LAPD]] station in West Los Angeles before the bombing in three hours. As they advance through LA, they are ambushed and suffer multiple casualties.  Nantz takes two survivors, Imlay and Harris, to look for Lenihan, who is missing from the group after having been wounded. After fighting off an alien, they regroup and team up with a group of [[Army National Guard]] soldiers from the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]], and an Air Force [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence]] [[United States Air Force#Technical Sergeant|Tech. Sergeant]], Elena Santos. At the police station, the platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian Michele, children Hector Rincon, Kirsten, Amy, and Hector's father Joe. A helicopter soon arrives to evacuate the wounded Marines, but fails to take civilians because of weight restrictions. During takeoff, it is destroyed by alien air forces, killing Grayston, Guerrero, Lenihan and Simmons.<ref name="film"/>  The Marines commandeer an abandoned [[town bus]] for evacuation. With the help of Michele and Santos, they also [[vivisect]] a wounded extraterrestrial and find a vulnerable spot in its abdomen, as well as realizing that the [[UFO]] [[aircraft]] are [[unmanned aerial vehicles|drones]] which track down victims using their [[radio transmission]]s. Santos reveals that her mission was to locate the aliens' central command center, believing that its destruction would deactivate the drones. On the [[Interstate 10 in California|I-10 freeway]], their bus comes under attack, as well as finding the freeway's off-ramp destroyed. The Marines release their civilians from the freeway by [[rappelling]] them. In the ensuing battle, Marines Stavrou and Mottola and the remainder of the Army National Guard soldiers are killed, while both Joe (who grabs a rifle and attacks one of the aliens) and Lieutenant Martinez are wounded. Martinez detonates explosives inside the bus, sacrificing himself to kill the aliens, leaving Nantz in command. Surviving troopers Nantz, Santos, Imlay, Kerns, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and the civilians escape the bombing zone. A news report speculates that the aliens are seeking Earth's water for fuel while attempting to colonize the planet and eradicate humans. The team prepares for the bombing, but nothing happens. Returning to the FOB, the Marines find it destroyed and that the military is retreating from LA. The Marines plan to escort the civilians to an alternate extraction point. Joe finally dies from his wounds, and Nantz comforts Joe's son Hector. Lockett confronts Nantz over his brother, [[Corporal#United States Marine Corps|Cpl]] Dwayne G. Lockett and the others who were killed during Nantz's last tour. They come to peace when Nantz explains that he continues to think of them, and recites each person's name, rank and serial number. Nantz then says that the surviving Marines deserve to move forward united to honor their fallen comrades, including Joe for his bravery. They reach the extraction point and evacuate by helicopter.<ref name="film"/>  In mid-air, the chopper experiences a brief loss of power. Nantz theorizes that they are hovering over a location occupied by the alien command center as it relays radio energy to its drones. He decides to reconnoiter the area alone, but Nantz's team insists on accompanying him. Searching underground, the Marines confirm the presence of a large alien vessel. Kerns radios in to request missiles, which Nantz manually directs using a [[laser designator]] while the others defend his position. Despite Kerns being killed when a Drone homes in on his radio signals, the Marines succeed in routing a missile to the command module, which is destroyed. The alien ground forces retreat as their uncontrolled drones crash. At a Temporary Operating Base in the [[Mojave Desert]], Nantz, Imlay, Lockett, Harris, and Adukwu, the survivors of the original platoon along with Santos, are greeted as heroes. Despite orders to rest, they re-arm themselves and join the rest of the Marines in retaking Los Angeles as other countries wage similar military operations against the hostile species.<ref name="film"/>  
Battle of Los Angeles (film)
 In February 1942, U.S. armed forces defend [[Los Angeles]] from [[unidentified flying objects]]. Seventy years later, the [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] invaders return to finish the attack.<ref name="ScreenRant"/>  In the near future, a large [[Spacecraft|spaceship]] arrives and hovers over Los Angeles. A human [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] squadron is scrambled, but their [[Air-to-air missile|missiles]] act erratically due to countermeasures being broadcast from the ship. The entire squadron is quickly destroyed, except for a female pilot named Lt. Solano, who ejects from her plane before it is destroyed.  Smaller alien craft suddenly attack a military base near Los Angeles. Marine Lt. Tyler Laughlin leads a group of survivors through the chaos following the attack, trying to find a safe haven. During their journey across the Los Angeles wasteland, Laughlin's group finds a surprisingly young World War II pilot named Captain Pete Rodgers. He claims his squadron was abducted by aliens back in 1942 while they were flying in the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Rodgers joins Laughlin's group, as well as Lt. Solano. Soon, the group encounters a sword-wielding special agent named Karla Smaith who takes them to a top-secret underground bunker. She reveals that a secret branch of the government has held an alien captive for the past 60 years after his spaceship crashed. Just then, Rodgers reveals himself to be an android. He kills most of the base personnel and reveals the alien's plans for the colonization of Earth and the extermination of the human race.  After destroying Rodgers, Laughlin, Smaith and Solano escape using the captured alien's spacecraft. They travel to the alien mothership over the city, where they plan to destroy it and stop the alien invasion. Once on board the mothership, they encounter a large dragon-like alien guarding the engines. The alien grabs Solano and Smith and Laughlin try to save her, but she orders them not to and leave her, in order to concentrate on destroying the ship with planted explosives. They escape just as the ship explodes, crashing down on Los Angeles. Smaith and Laughlin watch the destruction, knowing the rest of Earth is safe.

Aiden purchases a 1972 [[Buick Skylark]] and works on turning it into the fire blowing Medusa, while Woodrow continues to have sex with Courtney. Mike comes to Woodrow's to retrieve Milly's personal items, but Aiden intercepts him and tells him not to come around again or he'll kill him. Woodrow takes Milly's personal items, puts them in a box, walks them over to her apartment court with his flame thrower strapped to his back, and lights them on fire in front of her door. This inspires Mike to seek revenge, and he finds the Medusa muscle car in front of Woodrow's house and breaks a window with a baseball bat. Aiden stops him from creating further damage by wrestling the bat from him, and when Mike tries to get the bat back Aiden strikes him in the head. When Mike stops moving, Aiden runs.

When Woodrow wakes up and sees himself in the mirror he flies into a rage, tracks Milly down and has a screaming confrontation with her. When he tells her that he's been thinking of doing some "sick shit" to her all morning, she replies that she doesn't care and submits to his anger.

As Woodrow leaves Milly's house his shirt and hands are covered in blood, and he encounters Courtney in the street. She has a pistol and shoots herself in the head when he won't talk to her.

Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins
  The film opens with a prologue narrated by [[Stephen Fry]], introducing the audience to Benjamin Sniddlegass (Andrew Griscti), a nerdy redheaded orphan from [[Cockfosters]], UK, who lives with his domineering Aunt David Morrissey (Linda Newstead).  After discovering his Aunt has been hiding packages addressed to him, he sneaks down to the mailbox one morning and finds an envelope containing an [[iPhone]], which teleports him to [[Luna Park]] in Sydney, Australia. He's met by Mr. Pentangle (Alec Doomadgee), an imposing Aboriginal man, who reveals that Ben is part of an ancient magical sect of Wittertainers.  The pair journey to a small island off the Australian coast, which is home to Fairport Academy, the magic school that Ben will be attending. While moving into his dorm, Ben meets Scarlett McKenna (Catherine Davies), a gorgeous co-ed a few years his senior, who casts a spell curing his near-sightedness.  At the school assembly, Ben is ignored by the student population, but Scarlett comforts him. The new principal, Bavarian filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]] (Dorian Newstead), gives the opening address, warning the students that changes will be made with him in charge.  A musical montage shows the next three months Ben's school life. His initial classes with Professor [[Mumblecore]] as a disaster, and Ben is the subject of humiliating gossip among his fellow students. He takes advantage of a history project to deliver a presentation on his idol, [[skiffle]] legend Johnny Leroy, which wins over his classmates, who applaud him enthusiastically.  A chat between Ben and Scarlett shows their relationship beginning to grow closer, as Ben's confidence has grown. He is outfitted with a new wardrobe, and is given a suit belonging to his father as a going away present from Pentangle, who is swimming to Germany to take up his new post as headmaster of Werner Herzog's Rogue Film School.  Ben visits Principal Herzog, curious about the history of his family. Herzog tells Ben of his early life, fighting along Ben's father Percy (also Andrew Griscti), a secret agent employed by the British government. Percy's career was focused on defeating the machinations of the sinister Lord Emmerich, a vicious mastermind with the head of a gorilla.  In flasback, we see Ben's mother Lucy (Sarah Linnegar) held hostage by Lord Emmerich in his lair, inside a hollowed out Icelandic volcano. Percy breaks into the facility and confronts Emmerich, defeating him and rescuing his bride. Sensing his defeat, Emmerich sets the self-destruct sequence, causing the volcano to erupt and kill them all.  Ben relates his troubles to Scarlett over a game of [[billiards]] in the Fairport Academy bar. She reveals she lusted after Ben's father when she was growing up, and they trade innuendo as she beats him decisively. As they get more and more drunk, she delivers a rambling speech to him about hero worship and they almost kiss.  The next morning, Ben invites Scarlett down to the disused concert hall, and shows her his plan to resurrect the school's tradition of concerts, which used to be filled by the ghosts of dead rock stars. Ben's strategy is to run school talent quests, then start to bring in notable living performers, like [[Bruce Springsteen]]. An impressed Scarlett joins Ben on the stage and they perform a duet of the Fairport Academy School Song.  The print becomes scratchy and is replaced by a technical difficulties card. The projectionist (Max Newstead) phones the director of the film (Jeremy Dylan) and explains that he's lost the next two reels of the film. Dylan is concerned that this skips a number of important plot points, but they conclude that no one will notice. Kenneth restarts the projector.  [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Paul McCartney]] have just left the stage as Ben concludes his performance at the school talent quest to rapturous applause. Later, Ben sleeps uneasily.  Ben dreams he's back in the concert hall, watching Johnny Leroy and the Impulsives perform on stage. In the second verse, Leroy transforms into the Lord Emmerich, who leaps down from the stage and menaces Ben, demanding to know the 'secret of the cauldron of penguins'.  Ben awakes with a start. Scarlett comes to his door to check on him, but Ben assures her it was merely a bad dream. A concerned Scarlett calls Pentangle in Germany and relays the news.  Ben is plagued by another dream involving Lord Emmerich and the Cauldron of Penguins, this time more violent, and awakes in a panic. Scarlett comes to his door again, more concerned, and they sit together in his room and resolve to go to Principal Herzog for advice. She comforts him and they have [[sex]].  In his office the next morning, Herzog tells Ben of his concern that Emmerich is using Ben's dreams as a way to regain a footing in the physical world. The only solution is to keep Ben awake indefinitely and Herzog concocts a mixture of energy drinks, coffee and cocaine that Ben reluctantly drinks.  He heads to the school library with the mixture, researching penguins in hopes of discovering the solution to the mystery of the cauldron. As he ingests more the mixture and stays awake longer, he begins hallucinating a talking stuffed penguin (Lauren McKenna), who mocks him. Ben punches him repeatedly in the face.  Two weeks later, a concerned Pentangle arrives at the library, searching for Ben, who has become totally unhinged. Pentangle cleans him up and tells him that Scarlett and Herzog have been kidnapped by Lord Emmerich, and together they search for clues where they were last seen. Ben finds an [[iPhone]] and uses the transporter app to follow them.  He appears in Lord Emmerich's hollowed out [[Icelandic volcano]] lair, an exact replica of the room where he faced off with Ben's parents. Scarlett is bound and gagged on an operating table and Emmerich stands over her, threatening them with a pistol. He removes his gorilla mask to reveal that he is really Werner Herzog, who created the fictional persona of an eccentric Bavarian filmmaker to escape the authorities after surviving the destruction of his old lair. He reveals his overly elaborate plan in a long-winded speech, then prepares to shoot them both dead. Ben, remembering the layout from the earlier flashback sequence, activates the self-destruct sequence and transports him and Scarlett to safety

He explains that he once knew another man who wanted to marry a smart beautiful woman against his family's wishes. Sonny's mother interprets for Young Wasim, realizing he is talking about her, and she finally gives the couple her blessing. She asks Sunaina to take good care of her "favourite son". Before the remaining guests can leave, Muriel reveals that her experience running the family's household gave her the knowledge how to balance a budget and that the hotel can make a profit. She approaches Sonny's investor privately and then invites him to visit the hotel to discuss matters with Sonny.

He returns to the hotel just as Evelyn is leaving for work, and asks her out on a date. A closing montage with a voiceover shows Muriel checking in customers in an elegant renovated lobby, Madge dining with a handsome older Indian man, and Norman and Carol living happily together.

 [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Malcolm Turner ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is elated to learn that his stepson, Trent Pierce ([[Brandon T. Jackson]]), has been accepted to attend [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. However, Trent is uninterested and instead wants Malcolm to sign a recording contract for him since he is underage. When Malcolm refuses, Trent's best friends encourage him to ambush Malcolm on the job in order to obtain the signature.  Malcolm, in an attempt to capture Russian gang member Chirkoff ([[Tony Curran]]), uses an informant named Canetti to deliver a flash drive to the gang, while Trent attempts to ambush Malcolm on the job. Canetti ([[Max Casella]]) reveals that the flash drive is empty and a duplicate is hidden with a friend at the Georgia Girls School for the Arts.  During the exchange, Canetti's cover is blown and he is killed, which Trent witnesses. Malcolm eventually rescues Trent and they escape, but since Trent's car was left at the scene Malcolm knows the gang members will be able to track them down so Malcolm and Trent are forced to hide undercover. Malcolm once again becomes Sherry's grandmother, Big Momma, and also disguises Trent as an obese girl named "Charmaine", Big Momma's great-niece. Big Momma takes a job as a house mother at the Georgia Girls School for the Arts, while Charmaine is enrolled as a student.  Surrounded by attractive young women, Trent nearly blows his cover, but manages to befriend a girl named Haley Robinson ([[Jessica Lucas]]). The headmistress announces that a historic music box has been stolen from the library, and Malcolm deduces that this music box contains the flash drive. While scoping out the library, Big Momma encounters security guard Kurtis Kool, who attempts to woo her while giving a tour. Seeing a picture of Kurtis with Canetti, Malcolm realizes that he is the friend, and tries to find out more about the music box.  Meanwhile, the gang members approach Trent's best friends, posing as record producers, and encourage them to notify them of Trent's whereabouts. Charmaine sets up a date between Haley and himself, though she doubts she will be interested in the seemingly egotistical "Prodi-G," Trent's hip-hop alias. Trent reverts to his true self and the date goes well, but an encounter with Trent's best friends causes the gang members to tail them.  Trent helps Haley perfect her musical performance for the upcoming "Showcase" event, turning it into a duet, and the two exchange a kiss at the end of the date, while Haley encourages Trent to pursue college. Before the gang members can capture Trent, he changes into his Charmaine disguise, throwing them off. Learning of an exchange between two students and Kurtis Kool, Big Momma attempts to flirt with Kurtis in order to apprehend him for stealing the music box, but the secret exchange ends up being the stolen gamecock from the Ignatius Boys School.  During this encounter, Malcolm reveals his true identity to Kurtis. After gaining the favor of several students by offering sage advice and comfort to them, Big Momma finally learns the music box was actually stolen by Haley as a hazing to become a full pledged member of the "Divas", a group of top artists in the school. As she is about to perform her duet, Malcolm forces Trent to retain his Charmaine disguise, and he attempts to perform the duet with Haley as Charmaine, only to break disguise and ruin the performance. As Haley storms off, the gang members arrive and a chase ensues.  Trent accidentally draws their attention as he attempts to pursue Haley and explain himself. Just as he recovers the flash drive, the gang members catch up and hold him at gunpoint. Big Momma interferes and provides an escape, but all three are caught again and Malcolm's disguise is revealed. Just as Chirkoff is about to kill them, Kurtis arrives with a taser and saves the day.  Trent and Haley reconcile, and Malcolm signs Trent's record contract, only to have him tear it up and reveal his new plan to attend college. As the film ends, Malcolm and Trent make an agreement to keep the whole ordeal a secret from Sherry.

Black Butterflies
 As the movie opens, Ingrid and Anna Jonker are living in a seaside shack with their elderly grandmother.  One night, Anna rushes into the bedroom and tells Ingrid that their Grandmother is not breathing. As her body  is carried away in a hearse,the wealthy Abraham Jonker ([[Rutger Hauer]]) arrives and expresses shock that the girls have no shoes. When Anna asks what they are to call him, Abraham replies, "Call me 'Pa.'"  Decades later, in 1960, an adult Ingrid ([[Carice van Houten]]), is swimming against the ocean current when she starts to go under. Hearing her cries, a man on shore ([[Liam Cunningham]]) spontaneously dives into the water to save her. As the reach the shore, he introduces himself as the novelist [[Jack Cope]]. Overjoyed, Ingrid says that she read his novel. Looking shamefaced, Cope asks how she liked it. She replies that his novel saved her life and introduces herself to Cope, who is stunned to realize that she is, "the poet Ingrid Jonker."  Moments later, her sister Anna interrupts and says that their father is waiting for her. In his car, Abraham tells Ingrid that her estranged husband, Pieter, has asked for a ride to her house. When Ingrid gripes that she and Pieter have nothing in common, Abraham replies, "You married him."  Inside the lodgings Ingrid shares with Anna and her infant daughter, Pieter pleads for another chance. Then, Cope calls to invite her to a party with his friends. Spurning Pieter's pleas, Ingrid goes to the party.  Moments later, a Black writer arrives and laments that the Censorship Board has banned his unpublished novel and that the police have confiscated the manuscript. He laments that four years of his life have gone to waste.  As Cope and Ingrid drive the writer to the black township of Nyanga, the writer secretly tells Cope that Ingrid's father is the head of the Censorship Board and is the man who banned his novel. Cope responds that he thinks that Ingrid isn't like her father.  Back at Cop's flat, he tells Ingrid that he has two children and is going through a very ugly divorce. Ingrid shows him a poem that she had written in his honor and Cope is reduced almost to tears. When he asked why she wrote it, Ingrid says that his novel saved her life. Soon after,they are shown to have become lovers.  Soon after, Cope tells Ingrid that he is madly in love with her and asks her and her daughter to move in with him. Overjoyed, she accepts  It is passionate and they are deeply in love. But Jack refuses to marry her.  He doesn't say why (perhaps it is her attractions to, and flirtatious ways with, other men when she professes love to Jack [her sexual liberation before the sexual revolution]; perhaps it is how all consuming their passionate love and lovemaking is so that Jack finds himself unable to write [he says being with Ingrid "drains him"] though Ingrid's poems seem to keep flowing). He announces he will visit his two sons for 2 or 3 months (which will also include seeing their mother, who is still his wife, since his divorce from her was not yet finalized; the visit is partly so that he can start writing again). Ingrid is distraught at their being apart for so long and begs him not to go.  At the train when he departs she begs him yet again not go to or to take her with him.  It turns out that Ingrid was pregnant with Jack's child, though he did not know.  While he is gone, she has an abortion.  After he has been gone some time, Ingrid receives a phone call from him where she learns that he will be away for another month. In her sadness and anger at that news, she seduces a young writer (called Eugene Maritz in the movie and played by Nicholas Pauling, though in real life the writer's name was André Brink). In the movie, Eugene was a huge fan of Ingrid's poetry, and the playwright, Uys Krige (played by Graham Clarke), had just lauded Eugene as a huge new literary talent. When Jack returns, he finds a pair of Eugene's shoes in his closet, and kicks Ingrid out, though she comes back into his life many more times though only once more as his lover.  A pivotal scene in the movie (and in Ingrid's real life, though there it occurred much later there) is when Ingrid and Jack witness the police shoot into a car, killing a black child. This leads to Ingrid's famous poem, Die Kind, which is alluded to multiple times in the movie; a recording of [[Nelson Mandela]]'s reading of it in his address to the first democratically elected parliament is played at the end of the film. A subtext running throughout the film is [[apartheid]], its horrors, Ingrid and Jack's opposition to it, but Ingrid father's strong, unwavering support of it. Ingrid's father was Chair of the parliamentary select committee responsible for censorship laws on art, publications and entertainment. He is a cold, formal, tyrannical man, who never shows Ingrid any affection. He is grieved and embarrassed by Ingrid's opposition to his political views, support of writers whose work he has censored from publication, and her own writings.  At one point in the movie she asks him to read a poem she is particularly proud of; he reads most of the beautiful poem out loud, but is unable to stomach reading the whole poem and rips it up.  His rejections of his daughter throughout her life are extremely hard on her, and make her later rejections by Jack and Eugene also particularly hard on her. At one point her sadness and depression land her in Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital (where her mother had died several years earlier.) When Jack visits her there he learns for the first time that she had been pregnant with his child. It is a very moving scene. He asks why she had not told him. She says she tried to but if she had he would have married her (and unsaid but understood: she would not have wanted him to marry her for that reason though she had very much wanted him to marry her). Ingrid also tells him that they have taken all her poems away. Jack looks through the box of her possessions that the hospital has and finds a whole pocketbook stuffed full of poems Ingrid had written. He takes them. Jack and Uys cannot get over how good the poems are and stay up day and night feverishly working to compile them into a book for publication. Out of the hospital, Ingrid is thrilled when the book gets accepted by a publisher and dedicates the book to Jack and Uys. The book gets extraordinarily positive reviews, gets nominated for an extremely prestigious award (called the APB award in the movie), wins that award, and as part of winning that, Ingrid gets to go to Europe for the first time. (That book was Rook en oker and the prize was the Afrikaans Press-Booksellers literary prize.) Ingrid goes to see her father in his government office to tell him the wonderful news about the huge honor she has just received and to ask her father if he would accompany her to receive it, saying it would mean a great deal to her.  Her father does not congratulate her, informs her he already knew about the award, he saw nothing good in the book, had wanted to ban it and only had not done so because colleagues argued it would cause too much of a scandal, and to top it all off informs her he never wants to see her again.  Ingrid would have liked Jack to accompany her to Europe, and he would have, but the government would not issue him a passport because of his anti-apartheid views and advocacy. So Ingrid invites Eugene to accompany her, which he does.  During the trip he finds her writing a poem that states how much she loves Jack, which understandably hurts and upsets him; he announces he will be returning to South Africa soon. Ingrid's depression leads her to try to take her own life.  The hospital in Europe calls her father to ask for permission to give Ingrid electroconvulsive shock therapy. He gives his permission. That essentially ends her life because after that she is no longer able to write (whereas throughout the entire movie she had written prolifically throughout her life since childhood) and she is expressionless, never smiling again (whereas throughout most of the movie she had been brimming over with life and strong emotions). Before she commits suicide by walking into the ocean, she goes over to Jack's home and brings him her AFB medal along with a moving poem she had just written to Jack about her love for him and taking her life.

Blackthorn (film)
 Twenty years after his disappearance in 1908, an aged [[Butch Cassidy]] ([[Sam Shepard]]), living under the assumed name James Blackthorn in a secluded village in [[Bolivia]], decides to end his long exile and return to the [[United States]] after learning of the death of [[Etta Place]]. He writes to her son, Ryan, who is in fact his own son, telling him he intends to return. After years of raising horses and living a solitary life, Blackthorn sets off for [[Potosí]] to sell his horses. He tells his lover, Yana ([[Magaly Solier]]), that he will see her again before leaving Bolivia.  At Potosí, Blackthorn withdraws his savings from the bank, sells his horses, and then heads back to his village. Along the way, he is ambushed and nearly killed. He shoots his attacker, but not before Blackthorn's horse, Cinco, bolts off with his money. The shooter is Eduardo Apodaca ([[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]), a [[Spaniard]] mining engineer who claims he was shooting at pursuers. He begs Blackthorn to save him, and offers to share part of the $50,000 he stole from [[Simón Patiño]], a powerful Bolivian industrialist and mine owner. The money is hidden in an abandoned mine, and he will compensate Blackthorn for his help.  Blackthorn and the Spaniard set out across the desert plateau with Patiño's posse within a day's pursuit. They reach the abandoned mine and find the money, but the posse catches up with them. Following a shootout, Blackthorn and the Spaniard escape with the money. They make their way to Blackthorn's cabin, where the famous outlaw remembers his old friendships with the [[Sundance Kid]] and Etta Place, and how they escaped from Pinkerton Detective Mackinley ([[Stephen Rea]]). Yana joins the men at the cabin, and Blackthorn gives her a pocket watch he won in a card game. At first she rejects it as a "gringo machine", but then accepts the gift as something to remember him by.  Despite his asking her to spend one last night with him, she advises she must return to her own family.  Later that night, Yana returns to the cabin to stay with Blackthorn on his last night before leaving.  The next morning, two female members of the posse come to the cabin looking for the Spaniard, and in the ensuing gunfight, Blackthorn is wounded, and Yana is killed. A heartbroken Blackthorn and the Spaniard leave with the rest of the posse not far behind. They set out across the [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]] salt flats, hoping to reach the coast where Blackthorn can find a boat to take him home. Halfway across, the posse catches up to them, but Blackthorn and the Spaniard split up and are able to kill their pursuers and escape.  When he reaches [[Tupiza]], Blackthorn is treated by a doctor, who notifies former Pinkerton Detective Mackinley—now living a quiet life in Bolivia—of his famous patient. Mackinley confirms the man's identity. For years Mackinley claimed that the two bandits killed at San Vincente were not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and now he will finally be proven correct. But after initially notifying the Bolivian army of the discovered outlaw, Mackinley changes his mind, returns Blackthorn's pistol, and helps him escape. When Mackinley later discovers that Blackthorn was involved with the Spaniard, he reveals the truth to him about the Spaniard and his pursuers. Apparently, the $50,000 the Spaniard stole was not from the powerful mine owner, Patiño, but from the mining families who recently took control of the mines. The Spaniard stole the money from "the people"—something Butch Cassidy would never have done. Although disgusted with Blackthorn's involvement, Mackinley does not betray him.  In flashbacks to those days when he and the Sundance Kid rode together, he recalls how his partner, being wounded and near death, asks for Butch to "do it," and so Butch regretfully and lovingly takes the life of his best friend.  In the present, Blackthorn, distressed, tracks the Spaniard into the [[Andes]], with the Bolivian army not far behind. When Blackthorn catches up with him and confronts him with the truth, the Spaniard does not deny it, saying the money he stole was indeed from the mine owners—just "different owners." Blackthorn shoots the Spaniard in the leg and leaves him and the money for the Bolivian army, who soon arrive and kill the thief. The soldiers continue on with Mackinley until they reach a notoriously barren region, at which point the army commander leaves the detective alone and without a horse, as punishment for helping Blackthorn escape.  In the closing scene, Blackthorn, remembering his life and friends in better days, is last seen looking back over his shoulder and presumably escaping across the mountains.<ref name="dvd"></ref>   
Black Gold (2011 Qatari film)
  In the early 20th century, Emir Nesib ([[Antonio Banderas]]), Sultan of Hobeika, and Sultan Amar ([[Mark Strong]]) of Salmaah have been in a border war over a vast barren strip they call "The Yellow Belt". When Nesib wins he forces Amar to agree to a peace pact: the Yellow Belt will belong to neither, becoming a [[No man's land|no-man's-land]] between their territories, and Emir Nesib will take Sultan Amar's sons, Saleh and Auda, as hostages. Amar reluctantly agrees, knowing the hostages are a sacred trust which binds Nesib as well. They both swear to the pact before God. Nesib promises to rear Amar's sons with his own children, Tariq and Leyla.  Saleh, Amar's eldest son, is a free spirit interested in the traditional pursuits of an Arab emir, while Auda is a dedicated bookworm. Leyla and Auda become good friends, until they are separated at adolescence. Ten years pass. Auda ([[Tahar Rahim]]) is still a bookworm, while Saleh (Akin Gazi) longs to go home and be with his father.  Sam Thurkettle ([[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]]), a geologist working for the western "Texan Oil" company, surveys the Yellow Belt and is convinced there is high grade crude oil under its [[shale]]. He tells Nesib that the find will make him richer than the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of England]], and Nesib is more than willing to listen; he has had to watch, powerless and penniless, as his people suffered a [[cholera]] epidemic and his own wife died of it. Nesib allows Thurkettle's company to extract oil from the Yellow Belt - thus violating his peace pact with Sultan Amar.  Money pours in and Nesib starts to modernize his kingdom with schools, hospitals and electricity. He makes his son Tariq a Colonel, appoints Auda his national librarian, and sends an envoy to Amar to strike a deal to extract oil from the Yellow Belt. But desert tribesmen attack one of the oil sites and kill the crew. Their revenues threatened, Nesib sets about inducing the various tribes to accept the oil extraction, using lavish gifts and gold as inducements.  The envoy sent to Amar returns and reports to Nesib: Amar considers the exploitation of Yellow Belt a violation of their treaty. Saleh tells Auda that he can convince their father and decides to escape; he kills his guards while making his escape. He is caught, but Ibn Idris kills him in revenge for killing the guards, who were Ibn Idris's cousins.  Desperate to maintain the oil revenues, Nesib executes a brilliant political maneuver: he marries Auda to his daughter Leyla (Freida Pinto). At one stroke he has converted Auda's position from hostage to family member, thereby dissolving his pact with Amar and absolving himself from his religious oath. Auda reluctantly agrees, knowing it is a plot to prevent Amar from attacking Nesib. Nesib decides to send Auda to convince Amar for using the yellow belt. Auda meets Amar, who is surprised to learn that Auda has come as a representative of Nesib. Auda learns more about his father during his stay there. Amar tells Auda that Nesib offered 5%, then 35% of the earnings but he refused the offer. Nissib has even promised to throw in  Amar's sons as some kind of property value. When Auda tries to explain to him, he says that everything in his home is made either out of blood or love, but not money and that money has no value. The following day a meeting is held with Amar's allies. They say that by letting foreigners extract oil they let themselves be destroyed their culture will be gone, while Auda unsuccessfully argues by saying if god had not meant it for them to use, he wouldn't have given it in their soil.   Amar sends an envoy, Hassan Dakhil, to Nesib offering to cease all hostilities if Nesib agrees to shut down the oil wells and expel the foreigners. Nesib refuses and makes a counter offer to Hassan Dakhil. Later Amar receives a message from Hassan that seemingly indicates that Hassan has defected to Nesib. Following this setback, Amar makes a plan to send all of his prisoners into the desert with weapon props to act as decoys, in order to lure Nesib's army into the desert by while Amar takes his real army to capture Nesib's city, Hobeika. He offers the leadership of the decoy army to Auda. Auda protests, objecting that to send the prisoners into the desert would mean certain death, but in the face of his father's disapproval he reluctantly agrees and ventures out, accompanied by his half brother Ali, a doctor, who does not seem to share their father's xenophobic mindset. The plan works and Nesib sends six [[Armored car (military)|armored cars]] after them. However the heavy cars are stuck in the sands and Auda's men are able to overpower their occupants, though not without heavy losses. The camel carrying the [[Homing pigeon|carrier pigeons]] is killed and the pigeons escape. One of them manages to make it way back to Salmaah. The blood on the pigeon along with the absence of a written message leads Amar to believe that there have been no survivors. When the armored cars fail to return, Nesib sends a plane with Tariq on board to reconnoiter. Auda sets another decoy, having his men lie down and play dead around a destroyed armored car. When Tariq lands to investigate, Auda's men swarm him. Tariq manages to make it back to the plane, but Auda's men force it down. Auda finds his body in the ensuing wreckage and is overcome with remorse at all the needless deaths. He rallies the remaining prisoners and offers to divide the remaining water between them and set them free. The prisoners decide to follow Auda, who leads them to the sea believing that they would find water there, based from what he had heard from a dying camel rider.   The army, now Auda's army, finally arrive at the sea but are disheartened to find no fresh water, until Ali finds an underwater spring. Having refilled their water skins, the army moves away and comes upon a Beni Sirri slaver tribe. Auda leads a small group of men to meet the Sheikh of Beni Sirri tribe and during the meeting the Sheikh beats Aicha (Liya Kebede), a slave girl, brutally. The Sheikh seemingly holds the slave's Zamiri tribe in derision as the Zamiri are one of the few tribes that allow women the same freedoms that are given to men. Auda tries to protest and offers to buy the slave girl in exchange for his mother's ring, who belonged to the same tribe as the slave girl. An argument ensues, and the Sheikh reveals that Nesib has already bought the loyalty of the Beni Sirri and that they intended to kill him in exchange of a reward. The rest of Auda's men launch a surprise attack, surrounding and overwhelming the Beni Sirri, leaving Auda to handcuff and disgrace the leaders of Beni Sirri tribe and freeing the slaves. To add insult to injury, Ali relieves the sheikh of the gold watch given to him by Nesib at Auda's wedding. In gratitude for freeing the slaves, the other tribes pledge their own resources to Auda. Aicha offers to lead Auda back to her own tribe in order to enlist their aid. However Auda is mistakenly shot by one of the tribe and seems to have been killed, only to revive in the middle of his own funeral rites. Ali realizes that Auda's condition had in fact been a medical phenomenon known as mors putativa in which a [[Head injury|head trauma]] induces all the symptoms of death. However the tribals believe that Auda has been revived from death in the manner of the Islamic prophet Muhammad  and that he is the leader foretold in the legends of the Zamiri tribe. Ali, despite knowing the true nature of Auda's injuries, does nothing to dissuade this notion. The Zamiri tribe now rallies around Auda as their leader. One of Nesib's planes manages to track them down and opens fire. The tribals manage to shoot down the plane, but not before it fatally wounds Ali. Auda administers his last rites as Ali lies dying in his arms. With his last breath Ali makes Auda promise to 'overturn the chessboard' in effect asking him to depose both Amar and Nessib, thereby putting an end to the conflict.   Auda rides with his army to the gates of Nessib's city. Amar arrives and meets Auda, who reveals that he has united all the other tribes and intends to keep the Yellow Belt for them. Amar reveals that Nesib has agreed to Amar's conditions and demands that Auda turn over his army to Amar. During the discussion, Amar is shot dead by the sheikh of the Beni Sirri tribe, who had in fact been aiming for Auda. Auda's army is outraged, believing that Nessib had double crossed them and tried to kill Auda during the negotiations. Nessib's army commander realizes that with Amar dead, there is nothing to stop Auda from attacking. As the shells rain down, Auda gives up any hope for talks and leads his army to sweep over Nessib's defenses. Though Nessib has superior weaponry, the combined might of all the tribes in Auda's army [[Swarming (military)|overwhelms them by sheer numbers]].   Auda is knocked off his horse by a stray shell and beset upon by the Beni Sirri sheikh. The sheikh easily defeats him at close quarters  combat and mocks him, asking whether Auda learned to fence 'in a library'. Just before the sheikh can land the killing blow, Aicha stabs him in the back and saves Auda. Learning about the developments, Nesib abdicates the throne in favor of his only remaining child, Leyla. Auda, through his marriage to Leyla is now ruler of both cities. In the city, Auda's forces find Hassan in the dungeons, indicating that he had never betrayed Amar, but had instead been held prisoner by Nesib. Auda walks into the library where he finds Nesib, who compliments him on his achievements and asks what Auda intends to do. Auda replies that unlike his father, he does not dislike foreigners and that he believes that they have much to offer each other. On being questioned by Auda about what to do with Nessib, he admits that if he were in Auda's place he would have had him killed, quickly and painlessly. Auda instead opts to send him to [[Houston]] to sit on the Board of Directors of the oil companies, where he can protect the interests of their people. Auda offers him a backhanded compliment saying that 'he can't think of anyone more cunning' than Nesib to fill the role and that the oil company people 'deserve him'. The film ends with Auda holding a meeting with several foreigners presumably representatives of the oil companies.  
BloodRayne: The Third Reich
 [[Rayne (BloodRayne)|Rayne]] fights against the Nazis in Europe during World War II with the French [[French Resistance|resistance]], encountering Ekart Brand, a Nazi leader whose goal is to inject [[Adolf Hitler]] with Rayne's blood in an attempt to transform him into an all powerful [[dhampir]] and attain immortality.<ref>[http://www.destructoid.com/uwe-boll-making-another-bloodrayne-movie-164157.phtml Destructoid – Uwe Boll making ANOTHER BloodRayne movie]</ref>  The film opens with train cars full of humans being sent to concentration camps when they're intercepted by a French resistance group. Soon, [[Rayne (character)|Rayne]] (Natassia Malthe) arrives and kills most of the Nazi troops and corners their commandant in a train car. As the two talk, a Nazi shoots Rayne, splashing her blood on the commandant's face. Rayne kills the soldier before impaling the commandant on a pole and leaving him to die. Rayne soon converses with the leader of the resistance, Nathaniel, who is aware that Rayne is a dhampir. After finding the train cars full of prisoners, the resistance and Rayne decide to work together to fight the Nazis. After they leave however, the commandant is revealed to have survived his presumed death as a result of some of Rayne's blood getting in his mouth, implying that he is a dhampir.  Back at the headquarters of the Third Reich, a scientist named Mangler ([[Clint Howard]]) is torturing vampires as a way of studying them so he can make Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich immortal. A Third Reich lieutenant informs the doctor that the commandant was attacked by a 'vampire' in the daytime, intriguing his interest.  Elsewhere, Rayne heads to a brothel to get a massage when she overhears a soldier beating on one of the women. Angered by the beating interrupting her massage, Rayne easily beats the man down, forcing the owner of the brothel to close early, despite being warned that the Nazis would suspect something is wrong. She ignores the warning and angrily tells Rayne that she better not be a problem for her business. Rayne simply scoffs at the woman before walking off. As Rayne prepares to leave, a voluptuous woman stops Rayne and thanks her for saving the woman from before, taking off Rayne's robe. Another woman lights several candles as the woman continues to hit on Rayne. The woman walks out, telling Rayne and the busty woman to "have fun". Initially refusing her advances at first, the woman finally manages to seduce Rayne and has sex with her. As the woman sexually dominates Rayne, one of the women listens to their intercourse, smiling mischievously before walking out of the brothel. Rayne continues to make love with the woman, finally climaxing as she kisses down Rayne's body.  The woman that listened to Rayne's love session tells the commandant about Rayne assaulting the soldier from earlier in exchange for running the brothel she works at, since she hates the woman currently running it. The commandant flirts with the woman, commenting on her beauty before biting her.   Back at the brothel, Rayne is fully dressed, as Nazi soldiers have arrived to kill Rayne. After cutting them down with her swords, she is reunited with the commandant. Horrified to learn that she sired a Nazi commander, she flees. The Nazis fire at Rayne, managing to hit her, though she brushes it off and escapes. This angers the commandant, as he wants her alive. Dr. Mangler rushes to where Rayne was shot, and collects her blood for more research.  
Blitz (film)
  A serial killer is targeting police officers in South East London. After two police constables are shot dead and Chief Inspector Bruce Roberts (Rylance) is bludgeoned to death, the hunt for his identity begins.  Sergeant Porter Nash (Considine) is transferred to the South East London branch of the police to head the investigation, even though Nash is an outsider and widely ridiculed by his fellow officers for being openly gay. To his surprise he finds an unlikely ally in the hot-headed, gruff Detective Sergeant Tom Brant (Statham), who has a history of violent incidents.  While the investigation is ongoing, PC Elizabeth Falls (Ashton) is visited by a friend, a young gang member nicknamed Metal, who is afraid his gang might have actually killed someone. Promising him to look into the situation, Falls contacts Detective Inspector Craig Stokes (Evans), who agrees to help if Falls goes on a date with him.  One of Brant's informants, Radnor (Dennehy), points Brant and Nash towards a man named Barry Weiss (Gillen) who recently bragged about setting a police dog on fire, "for practice". Although Brant and Nash visit Weiss' flat, they cannot immediately find any evidence against him. Brant does recognize Weiss as the man he beat up in a fight in a billiard hall a year earlier. Unknown to either of them, Radnor decides to conduct an investigation of his own and eventually discovers the seemingly abandoned car where Weiss keeps the trophies of his kills, confirming that Weiss is the killer.   Meanwhile, Weiss contacts a newspaper reporter, Harold Dunlop (Morrissey), to make sure his murders get enough coverage in the press. Weiss promises to keep Dunlop updated about his murders and declares he wishes to be known as Blitz. Soon after, Dunlop is also contacted by Radnor who is interested in selling his information for a high price. Although Radnor leads Dunlop to Weiss' car, he is killed by Weiss before he can disclose Weiss' name. Dunlop then alerts the police to the car, but they find it empty.  Brant and a fellow police constable come to realize that all of Blitz's victims so far have been police officers who have arrested Weiss in the past and that PC Falls is most likely the next victim. Falls, after coming home from her date with Stokes, is attacked by Weiss but saved by Metal, who is killed in the ensuing struggle. Before Weiss can attack Falls again, the police arrive.  Brant and Nash decide to release a picture of Weiss to the media to flush him out, which eventually, after a lengthy chase, leads to Weiss' capture. There is no concrete evidence against Weiss however, so after 48 hours and an interrogation which does not yield results, the police are forced to let Weiss go. Exasperated, Brant and Nash devise a plot to trick Weiss, knowing that Weiss will want to take revenge on Brant for the billiard hall fight.  Weiss infiltrates the funeral of Chief Inspector Roberts, dressed in Roberts' uniform which he had stolen after murdering him. During the service, Brant leaves, followed by Weiss. Brant leads Weiss to the top of a parking garage, only to reveal that Brant and Nash had switched places along the route. Surprised by a hidden Brant, Weiss is overpowered and relieved of his gun. Explaining that they will never find enough evidence to convict Weiss legally, Brant concludes that they are now in a convenient situation: since Weiss is dressed as a police officer, and Brant has Blitz's gun, they can shoot him with his own gun, and it will look as if Weiss was just another of Blitz's victims.

Blind (2011 film)
 A [[missing person]] case involving a female university student and the victim in a [[hit and run]] case appears to be related. Detectives look for a witness.  Min Soo-ah ([[Kim Ha-neul]]) used to be a promising cadet at the police academy but after a horrific car accident which killed her surrogate brother Dong-hyun ([[Park Bo-gum]]) and caused her to lose her eyesight, her police career ended. Soo-ah reveals to Detective Jo ([[Jo Hee-bong]]) at the police station that on the night of the hit and run case she was picked up by a taxi cab driver. Soo-ah believes the taxi driver may be the perpetrator of the crimes. Initially, Detective Jo doesn't take Soo-ah's claims seriously because she is blind, but when Soo-ah displays her acute senses, the detective starts to believe her.  Detective Jo and Soo-ah then work together to find the taxi cab driver, but all their leads turn up empty. Then another witness comes forward, Kwon Gi-seob ([[Yoo Seung-ho]]). Gi-seob is a motorcycle delivery boy who claims to have also witnessed the hit and run incident. Gi-seob emphatically states that the car in question was not a taxi cab, but rather an imported sedan.  Meanwhile, Soo-ah finds herself being stalked by a mysterious man who turns out to be the killer, gynecologist Myung-jin (Yang Young-jo). Soo-ah, while in the car with him, remembered that he had a strong scent, he had a watch on his right hand, and he gave her an iced coffee drink in a glass can. While in the car with him, they hit a bump while in an argument. The body of the dead university student rolls out of the trunk and Myung-jin gets out to examine it. When Soo-ah goes out as well to inspect the damage done, he claims that he hit a dog, but she reasons with him, starting another fight. He leaves her in the rain when another car comes. The reason why she was in the car with him is because she needed a ride back from visiting the orphanage she used to grow up in.  One night when Gi-seob is walking home alone, he is followed by Myung-jin. Gi-seob at first runs away, but is snuck up on and hit by a brick. An ambulance comes and Detective Jo and Soo-ah drive to the scene. Gi-seob gets annoyed by Soo-ah's constant nagging, and on the day of his release, storms out in anger. When he reaches the nearly-empty subway station, he sees Soo-ah on the other side and then sees her ride the subway followed by the killer. He calls her on her phone and tells her urgently that the killer is in front of her. As he runs to catch up with her, she goes on [[FaceTime]] and shows him her location and surroundings. He guides her out of the subway and to safety, as well as her [[guide dog|seeing eye dog]], Seul-gi. She reaches into her handbag and sprays the killer's eyes with her pepper spray and runs off with Seul-gi. When she reaches the elevator, she thought that she'd be safe, but the killer quickly gets in and kills Seul-gi.  When Soo-ah wakes up, she asks for her seeing dog, but Gi-seob hands her the blood-stained leash. At home she gets a call from an unknown number. The caller warns her away from the case. "You can't see me, but I'm watching you." A few days later, Detective Jo finds the killer. They get into a violent fight, in which the detective dies and the killer drives off. Meanwhile, Gi-seob and Soo-ah visit the orphanage again when they're asked to watch over it while the school director takes the children out. The killer enters the living room and lights a cigarette and listens to some music. Soo-ah, annoyed by the music, goes downstairs to turn it off. She reprimands Gi-seob for playing it, but smells the cigarette smoke. Gi-seob goes upstairs and fights the killer while Soo-ah runs away, reaching the car and breaking its windows with the motion sensor. The killer attacks her but she hits him on the head, making him fall unconscious. The police find Detective Jo's body and other evidence implicating Myung-jin as the killer and he is put in jail. Soo-ah is re-admitted to the police academy and graduates, while Gi-seob also enrolls in the police academy.

Pushy takes a depressed Dana back to her place, a group of huts on the beach where she and other surfers live. Tara also lives there and continues to be mean to Dana. At the same time, policemen arrive and give the surfers one week to vacate the premises. Dana meets Tim (Ben Milliken) and he instantly takes a liking to her. After a nap there is a party that night and while Tim is trying to talk to Dana she spots Grant from the plane and dances and kisses him. The next day she tells them about her mom and how she wants to take pictures of herself at all the same places her mom did.

Zainab's mom keeps having babies that are born dead. Zainab arranges a [[tubal ligation]] for her. When Hakim ([[Manzar Sehbai]]) finds out, he becomes very angry.<ref>http://www.dawn.com/news/641475/bol-movie-review, Bol (film) movie review on Dawn, Karachi newspaper, Published 4 July 2011, Retrieved 21 April 2016</ref>  One day, Zainab sees Saifi dressed in women's clothes and gets very disturbed. Hakim owns a small traditional pharmacy and is approached by a man who asks him to teach The [[Quran]] to children, since Hakim is a very religious man who has bonds with the mosque. Hakim initially refuses because the man, Saqa (Ishaq), is running a brothel. Meanwhile, the mosque gives him some money to keep, since they believe him to be trustworthy. Mustafa ([[Atif Aslam]]), a neighbour, gets Saifi a job at a place where they paint trucks. There, Saifi is harassed because others discriminate against his identification.  One day Saifi is raped. Another [[intersex]], (played by Almas Bobby – who in real life is a transgender person), finds him and takes him home. Hakim overhears Saifi telling his mother and Zainab what happened. Later on, when everybody is asleep, Hakim suffocates Saifi to death with a plastic bag. He must bribe the police officer to keep it a secret with two lakhs. Hakim is forced to take money out of the [[masjid]] funds. The masjid asks for the funds, and Hakim doesn't have enough money. He is forced to go to the Saqa's house to get it.  Teaching children The [[Quran]] isn't giving him enough money, so Saqa gives him another option: Hakim must marry and have a baby with Meena ([[Iman Ali]]) who is one of the prostitutes and is Saqa's ([[Shafqat Cheema]]) oldest daughter. Hakim keeps having girls, and Saqa tells him that it is the men who decides the sex of the baby. Meanwhile, Zainab gets Ayesha ([[Mahira Khan]]) and Mustafa married since Hakim found another man at the masjid and wanted to get Ayesha married to that man. Simultaneously, Hakim marries Meena. When Hakim finds out about Ayesha's marriage, he is furious but can't do anything about it. Meena has her baby, and it is a girl meaning Saqa gets to keep it. Hakim begs Meena to give him the baby so that the child doesn't have to face a horrible future. Saqa overhears and kicks Hakim out.  Later on, Meena comes to give Hakim's family the baby. When Hakim's wife asks who that women was, he takes the baby and tells her that he married her. She screams at him, and he beats her up. The mother tells the kids what happened, and Zainab insists they all leave the house and move somewhere else to start a new life.  At night, Saqa comes to take Meena's daughter, since Meena was not supposed to give it to Hakim. Hakim tries to kill the daughter to keep her from a horrible future. He is killed by Zainab with a fatal knock on the head. They hide the baby. Zainab tells Saqa that Hakim killed the baby and threw her out somewhere; she tells him that she killed Hakim, which is why she is being given the death penalty.  Back in the present, a reporter keeps trying to prove that she is innocent but is unable to. Zainab ends by asking that why is only killing a sin? Why isn't giving birth, without any [[family planning]], a sin? Then she is hanged. The President ([[Rashid Khawaja]]) sees the reporter's newscast that ends with that question and schedules a meeting with the topic as the same as the question. In the end, the rest of the daughters open up a restaurant called Zainab's Cafe, which becomes very successful. They also raise their new half-sister, Meena's daughter.

Bombay Beach (film)
   The film uses an adamantly atypical and artistically innovative filmmaking to tell the story of three protagonists: Benny Parrish, a young boy diagnosed with bipolar disorder whose troubled soul and vivid imagination create both suffering and joy for him and his complex and loving family. "CeeJay" [[Cedric Thompson]], a black teenager and aspiring football player who has taken refuge in Bombay Beach hoping to avoid the same fate of his cousin who was murdered by a gang of youths in Los Angeles. And that of Red, an ancient survivor, once an oil field worker, living on the fumes of whiskey, cigarettes and an irrepressible love of life. Together they make up a triptych of American manhood in its decisive moments, populating the Salton Sea's land of thwarted opportunity. ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes, “[Bombay Beach] feels like a fever dream about an alternate universe. Suffused with a sense of wonder, it hovers, dancing inside its own ethereal bubble.”<ref></ref>  Har’el explains about the film, “This film can only serve to show glimpses into some of the larger issues one can pick out from these people’s lives and the way in which they live their lives in this particular place. All these things that can be perceived as wrong or right, or bad or good, all reside together, side by side. This is the human experience of life and that’s what I wanted to illustrate more than anything, how things co-exist, all the wrongs and the rights together, the love and the violence, the broken dream and the persistence of dreams. Even though the dream is broken, you can still see the people”<ref></ref>  From Salon: “You either like this kind of ambitious, brave, borderless experiment or you don’t, and I think it’s absolutely magical and tragic. Maybe it took a foreign-born Jewish filmmaker to make a movie that seems so positively biblical (…) about the current conditions of America.”<ref name="salon1"></ref>

Bridesmaids (2011 film)
  Annie Walker is a single woman in her mid thirties. Following the failure of her [[bakery]] due to the [[Great Recession|recession]], her boyfriend left her, and she lost her savings, forcing her to take a job as a sales clerk in a [[jewelry store]] and share an apartment with an obnoxious English immigrant roommate Gil and his sister Brynn. Her business failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. Annie has a [[casual sex|no-strings-attached]] sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted, but she hopes for something more from him. Her best friend, Lillian, is virtually her only source of happiness.  Lillian becomes engaged and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. At the [[engagement party]], Annie meets Lillian's bridesmaids: cynical, worldly, long-married cousin Rita; naïve and idealistic newlywed friend from work, Becca; the groom's decidedly unfiltered sister Megan; and Helen, the rich, beautiful, and elite wife of the groom's boss. Helen and Annie, who are jealous of each other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together.   Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a [[Churrascaria|Brazilian steak restaurant]] for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. Helen uses her influence to gain entry to the shop because Annie didn't make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the whole party— with the exception of Helen, who chose not to eat before the fitting —becomes sick from [[food poisoning]]. Later, Annie's suggestion of a [[bachelorette party]] at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to [[Las Vegas]] planned by Helen. Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in economy class although the rest of the party flies [[First class (aviation)|first-class]]. The trip is cut short by an outburst from Annie, who had accepted a sedative from Helen because of her massive [[Acrophobia|fear of flying]]. The plane makes an [[emergency landing]] in [[Casper, Wyoming]]; and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides that she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and the wedding.  Annie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but Irish-American Officer Nathan Rhodes, a friendly State Patrol officer who had earlier let her off without a ticket for broken tail lights, begins flirting with her. Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie declines. Following a romantic night together, Nathan buys baking supplies as a surprise, in the hopes that Annie will start baking again. Offended and overwhelmed, Annie leaves. Annie is later fired for being rude to a customer, and kicked out of her apartment by her roommates, forcing her to move in with her mother.  Annie travels to Helen's home in Chicago for the [[bridal shower]], which has become a [[Paris]]ian-themed event, an idea that Annie previously came up with but Helen turned down. Helen also upstages Annie's heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris, an idea Helen stole from Annie. Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme, Annie throws a tantrum. Lillian kicks her out of the shower and the wedding. On her way home, Annie is involved in a car accident due to her still-broken tail lights, but the other driver flees the scene. Officer Rhodes ends up being the responding officer, and he admonishes her for not fixing her tail lights and taking responsibility for her life. When Annie dismisses him by saying she "knows" he didn't want anything but sex from her, Rhodes is upset, and storms off when Ted arrives to give Annie a ride. On the ride home, Ted asks Annie to perform [[oral sex]] on him. Frustrated, she breaks off the relationship and walks home.  Annie becomes [[recluse|reclusive]], refusing to leave her mother's house and obsessively watching television. Eventually, Megan arrives and gives Annie a pep talk, telling Annie that she must stop blaming the world for her problems and take control of her life. Annie realizes her errors and begins to repair her life, beginning to bake again and getting her car fixed. She tries to make amends with Nathan, but he is still upset over her previous actions and ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep distraught; Lillian has disappeared, and Helen begs for Annie's help in finding her. While driving, Helen apologizes to Annie and opens up to her, revealing that people only involve her in their lives because she is good at planning events, but she does not have any true female friends, leading to something of a reconciliation between them. The two enlist Officer Rhodes to help, and he reluctantly agrees. The group finds Lillian at her own apartment, discovering that she ran from her wedding because of Helen's extravagant planning and from fear of leaving her life in [[Milwaukee]]. After reconciling, Annie helps Lillian prepare for her wedding.  Annie resumes her place as maid of honor. After the wedding, which Annie agrees with Helen is "perfect", Helen again apologizes to Annie, and states her hope that they can be friends in the future. Realizing that Annie and Officer Rhodes were falling in love, Helen also arranged for him to pick up Annie after the wedding. Officer Rhodes and Annie reconcile and the pair ride away in his police car.

Breakaway (2011 film)
 ''Breakaway'', or ''Speedy Singhs'' (the Hindi version of the movie), is the story of Rajveer Singh (Vinay Virmani), a young and dedicated teenager who gave up college halfway through due to his lack of interest, one of the many conflicts between him and his father Darvesh. Rajveer and Darvesh had never gotten along; though the family is [[Sikh]], due to a childhood incident, Rajveer has taken his turban off since a very small age. Rajveer still meets up with his Sikh friends, and when they get the time, they play hockey as a hobby. One day, while practising hockey, a few players on the Hammerheads insult the Singhs, and Rajveer and his friends beat the other players at hockey. Realizing how good they are, Rajveer decides to make a hockey team with his friends.  His father completely disagrees with this, and forbids him to ever play hockey again. Unwilling to take the sorrow, his friends convince him to join the team, and all together, they name their team, "Speedy Singhs". The Speedy Singhs turn out to be a huge commercial success, but they need to get into the Hyundai Cup championship to earn real fame, so using the help of Coach Dan Winters ([[Rob Lowe]]), they all start practicing day and night for the tournament. Rajveer lies to his family by telling them he is working extra at his job, but never has the courage to tell them that he plays in his own hockey team. The tournament begins, and during the first match Rajveer is caught by his businessman uncle, Sammy ([[Gurpreet Ghuggi]]). Sammy promises not to tell Darvesh, and so goes on the tournament with Speedy Singhs.  Whilst playing, Rajveer falls in love with Dan Winters' little sister, Melissa ([[Camilla Belle]]). The two love each other, and keep on meeting. A night before the hockey finals, Rajveer lies to his father and says he is going to New York for a job delivery, though his father spots him playing hockey in the semi-finals. When a night out celebrating with the team ends poorly, Raj winds up arguing with his father, losing his position as captain after arguing with the coach, and quitting the team.  Though the Speedy Singhs make it to the finals against the Hammerheads without Raj, Melissa reveals that the Speedy Singhs must wear helmets, which they cannot do unless they remove their turbans.  Inspired by the story of why Sikh men wear turbans, Raj obtains special helmets that will accommodate the team's turbans and pays for the legal fees to allow the special helmets.  He apologizes to Dan and the Speedy Singhs for his selfishness and they accept him back.  The day of the finals coincides with Raj's cousin Sonu's wedding, which many of the Speedy Singhs are attending.  When Sonu thanks all the guests, he brings up how the Speedy Singhs have become a source of pride for the community and encourages everyone to attend the finals.  Rajveer explains his passion about hockey to his father.  Though still angry, Darvesh lets him go but refuses to go to the game.  The Speedy Singhs do well in the game until the Hammerheads tie the game at the end of the third period, forcing overtime.  Darvesh, after listening to the game at the temple, arrives at the arena to show his support. Rajveer, with his father's acceptance, makes the winning goal and the Speedy Singhs win the game and later on hugs Darvesh in the rink.  
Breathing (film)
 Roman Kogler is a 19-year old prisoner in an Austrian juvenile detention centre. The movie appears to encompass a roughly two week period leading up to his parole hearing, during which time he starts a trial month employed as a mortuary attendant, a job being an important qualification for parole.  The protagonist, Roman Kogler, appears in every scene, and the narrative arc concerns his emotional awakening, explored in the actor's facial expressions and postures, reinforced by visual symbolism and a sparse dialogue with other characters.  Initially sullen, he's isolated from his fellow inmates, from the probation counselor who tries earnestly to help him, from the guards and from his new co-workers.  As Roman endures stubbornly, with the passive, stoic indifference to his own fate of the truly hopeless, and as he begins to learn his new job, small events seem to awaken emotions in Kogler, leading to a new interest in understanding his own past and in the possibility of sympathetic relationships.  The first scene introduces Roman Kogler as he is interviewing for a job in a metal-working factory, and he is lying about his welding skills to the foreman.  When the foreman moves to place a welder's mask on his face, he jumps back, uttering a stifled scream.  Next, we see a bleak and empty roadway stretching off to an empty horizon; after a few moments, a car approaches on the left and Kogler appears from behind the camera, walking determinedly away at the right edge of the pavement, no reachable destination in sight.  The car, having made a u-turn out of sight, returns to view and stops ahead blocking Kogler's progress and Kogler gets in the car, slamming the passenger door twice.  The car is driven by Walter Fakler, Kogler's probation counselor, who has come to fetch Kogler after the disaster at the metalworking job.  Sullen and laconic, Kogler is quietly, resentfully defiant with the earnest, exasperated Fakler.  Returning Kogler to prison, Fakler hands him a newspaper, and admonishes him to look through the want ads, warning Kogler that he will expect to meet with him on Monday.    The movie proceeds through a series of glimpses of institutionalized routine.  Returned to prison, we see Kogler disrobe and endure the ritualized strip search, which is apparently required at each re-entrance, administered with curt, routine efficiency by a uniformed officer and his assistant.  This strip search is repeated twice more in the film with slight variations in the dialogue that further the story's progress.  We see the end of the day along the prison hallway, as the solid steel doors of the cells are locked, and Kogler is left alone in his cell.  The one recreational activity the audience is shown is a visit of the juvenile prisoners to an indoor swimming pool; Roman dives in and swims laps, ignoring and ignored by the other prisoners -- this scene, too, will be repeated twice more with variations.  Every working day, he commutes on the train into central Vienna and passing a subway holiday ad that shows a woman in a South Sea paradise and reads: "Tauchen Sie ein Ins Abenteuer! ("Dive Into Adventure!").  The mortuary where he works is apparently Vienna's giant [[Bestattung Wien]] (Funeral Vienna), where he and his co-workers are involved in transporting corpses from place-of-death and from morgue to cemetery in a large-scale, routinized operation.  Initially, he is tasked only with observing.  In his first encounters with corpses, his disgust and horror is barely suppressed.  One of his co-workers seems actively hostile at first.   In one scene, Roman is working alone in a small workroom, wearing coveralls, removing the cases used to transport corpses from an industrial steam cleaning machine, and a small bird startles him.  He opens a door, squats down to let the bird free, and then follows it out; the door is labeled "Notausgang" ("Emergency Exit").  After a chance encounter on the job with the naked corpse of a young woman who shares his surname, Roman seems to panic at the idea that this might be his mother, dead.  Confirming that the corpse was not his mother leads Roman to locate his mother. He manages to find out where she lives and follows her into an [[IKEA]] store, where he sees her lying, like a corpse, on one of the beds. They later become re-acquainted and he tells her he's a diving instructor and soon heading to New Zealand (a reference to the subway ad). Back at her flat, he asks his mother why she gave him up and she tells him that it was the best thing she did in her life. She finds out his real occupation as an undertaker and confronts him after the end of his shift, outside the mortuary. She also confesses to him that the real reason that she gave Roman up was that, when he was a baby, she tried to suffocate him by placing a pillow over his face, to stop his crying.  The film ends with Roman leaving his parole hearing and visiting the grave of his teenage victim.  
The Brazen Bull
 An ice cold tale of misguided ambition and savage revenge. Set in the bowels of an iconic derelict Los Angeles high-rise, we follow Lauren and her real-estate investing fiancé as they discover first hand what happens when a madman leads not with emotion, but rather chilling rationality. The Man in question brings a heaping helping of sanity and jet-black humor to the crazy table. The result is a wonderfully off-kilter horror/thriller that never goes where we expect, but rather draws the audience deeper into a surprising world that has dark corners even in the brightest rooms.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1415284/.html</ref>  (The above plot summary needs editing. It has been copied word by word from the advertising text on the DVD cover.)  
The Boy Who Was a King
 The film tells the story of [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], the last Bulgarian [[Tsar]]. He assumed the throne at the age of six, when his father [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] died. However, the boy held the throne for only three years due to the establishment of a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|socialist regime]] in the country. The former Tsar was exiled and he spent the following decades in various countries across the globe.  A few years after the fall of the socialist regime in 1989, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha returned to Bulgaria for the first time since 1946. He was welcomed by wide-spread popular enthusiasm and was elected as a [[prime minister]] in 2001. In the harsh political climate of the country in its transitional period, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha's political career lasted only one term.  The film presents not only the life of the former Tsar, but also intertwines within the story vignettes of various Bulgarians, who were supporting him, sending him gifts, or merely tattooing his face on themselves. The story is told through own footage and vast amounts of archival material.

The Broken Tower (film)
 The film begins with a plot structure based on a progression of chapters titled as "Voyages" in Hart Crane's life loosely related to Crane's lyric poem of the same name. In the first "Voyages", a depiction is made of an early attempt by Crane to take his own life. Among the other opening "Voyages", the audience is also shown depictions of several same sex relationships which Crane had throughout his lifetime in semi-graphic portrayal consistent with the film's rating. Crane's life is shown progressing through the various "Voyages" in the film, largely portrayed through his troubled relationship with the father, his close relationship to his mother, and his frustrating relationship to his job in advertising as a copyrighter in New York City. In the final "Voyages", Crane's difficult relationship to alcoholism is depicted, ending with his final "Voyage" on a small cruise ship at sea in the vicinity of Mexico where Crane ended his life by his own hand.

Through a series of misunderstandings, he gets a job as a porn actor with fading director Miles Deep ([[Don Johnson]]).

Butter (2011 film)
 The film takes place in and around [[Johnson County, Iowa]]. Destiny ([[Yara Shahidi|Yara]] [[Yara Shahidi|Shahidi]]) is a ten-year-old foster child in Iowa who gets placed with Ethan ([[Rob Corddry]]) and Jill Emmet ([[Alicia Silverstone]]). While visiting the [[Iowa State Fair]] by herself, she wanders into the exhibit of the winning [[butter sculpture]], a life-sized [[Last Supper]], and skillfully finishes the [[Holy Grail]] cup, which impresses the sculpture's creator, Bob Pickler ([[Ty Burrell]]).  Bob has won fair's butter-sculpture contest for the past 15 years straight; because of his dominance, he is asked to abstain from future competitions to give others a chance.  Bob's wife Laura ([[Jennifer Garner]]), overly competitive and socially ambitious, goes to the home of the competition's organizer to protest. Bob goes to a strip club and solicits stripper Brooke ([[Olivia Wilde]]) for sex in his minivan. Laura discovers them and [[Side collision|T-bones]] the van with her SUV.  Laura decides to enter the county's preliminary sculpture competition herself because of the social status that comes with winning. Destiny decides to enter as well, as does Brooke, who just wants to harass the Picklers because Bob owes her $600. Despite practice, Laura comes in second to Destiny.  When Brooke appears at the Picklers' seeking her money, Bob's daughter Kaitlin ([[Ashley Greene]]) admits her and takes her up to her room. After talking a bit, Kaitlin challenges Brooke to a game of truth-or-dare which escalates to them having sex. Kaitlin is drawn to Brooke's alternative style and attitude; Brooke just wants the money (she ups the amount to $1200) and Kaitlin says she can get it. Meanwhile, Kaitlin's stepmom Laura is hooking up with Boyd Bolton ([[Hugh Jackman]]), an old high-school boyfriend who is now a used-car salesman. She's seducing him to get him to falsely testify to county officials that Ethan paid him to help Destiny in the competition. Laura suggests a rematch at the state fair. Destiny agrees; everyone else is disgruntled.  Brooke gets her money from an infatuated Kaitlin, meets Destiny after school, and takes her to the mall to buy her a $1,200 set of chef's knives to help her in the rematch with Laura. When Destiny gets home, a social worker informs her that her biological mother has died.  At the state fair, Laura carves a replica of John F. Kennedy's car immediately after his assassination complete with the president's blown-up skull and Jackie Kennedy and Clint Hill crawling onto the trunk; Destiny creates her biological mother holding her infant self in a rocking chair. That night before the judging, Boyd sneaks into the butter-sculpture room and defaces Destiny's sculpture with a blowtorch. Destiny, disappointed and expecting to lose now, encounters Laura in the restroom and offers the forgiveness of her handshake. Laura tells Destiny that winning the butter-sculpting contest means more to her than the little girl can comprehend. Laura feels she has little opportunity to distinguish herself otherwise, while Destiny has talent and her entire life to realize her own potential. Despite the damage, Destiny's sculpture wins. The sabotage of the piece is recognized as "higher art" as the judges believe the melted face lends the butter sculpture a greater depth. Destiny goes on to win in the state competition, where judges give a positive critique on her piece, deeming it an "angst-ridden exploration of post-natal abandonment."   Upon her victory, Destiny assures Laura that the butter-carving contest is "not all that you have." Laura kneels down to Destiny and hugs her, understanding that she must move on to greater triumphs that are her own.  Later, Destiny is officially adopted by the Emmets and Laura is running for Governor of Iowa, claiming that God appeared to her and advised her to run.

Captain America: The First Avenger
  In the present day, scientists in the Arctic uncover an old, frozen aircraft. In March 1942, Nazi officer [[Red Skull|Johann Schmidt]] and his men steal a mysterious relic called the Tesseract, which possesses untold powers, from the town of [[Tønsberg]] in [[German occupation of Norway|German-occupied Norway]].  In [[New York City]], [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] is rejected for [[World War II]] military recruitment because of various health and physical problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend, Sgt. [[Bucky Barnes|James "Bucky" Barnes]], Rogers again attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, Dr. [[Abraham Erskine]] allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a "[[Supersoldier|super-soldier]]" experiment under Erskine, Col. [[Chester Phillips]], and British agent [[Peggy Carter]]. Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side-effects.  Schmidt and Dr. [[Arnim Zola]] harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world. Schmidt discovers Erskine's location and dispatches assassin [[Heinz Kruger]] to kill him. Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with "vita-rays". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, an undercover Kruger kills Erskine and flees. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a [[cyanide]] capsule. With Erskine dead and his super-soldier formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as "Captain America" to promote [[War Bond|war bonds]] while scientists study him and attempt to [[reverse-engineer]] the formula. In 1943, while on tour in [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] performing for active servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes' unit was [[Missing in action|MIA]] in a battle against Schmidt's forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer [[Howard Stark]] fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt's Nazi division [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], freeing Barnes and the other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who removes a mask to reveal a red, skull-like visage that earned him the [[sobriquet]] "the Red Skull". Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers.  Rogers recruits Barnes, [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Gabe Jones]], [[Jim Morita]], [[Union Jack (comics)|James Montgomery Falsworth]], and [[Jacques Dernier]] to attack other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a [[Captain America's shield|circular shield]] made of [[vibranium]], a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, which opens a [[wormhole]] into space, sucking him into it. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.  Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] radio broadcast that something is wrong, he flees outside and finds himself in present-day [[Times Square]], where [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Nick Fury]] informs him that he has been "asleep" for nearly 70 years.

[[Lightning McQueen]], now a four-time Piston Cup champion, returns to [[Radiator Springs]]. However, Italian [[formula racing|formula]] race car, [[Francesco Bernoulli]], challenges McQueen to the newly created World Grand Prix, led by its creator, Sir Miles Axlerod. McQueen and his best friend Mater — along with [[Luigi (Cars)|Luigi]], [[Guido (Cars)|Guido]], [[Fillmore (Cars)|Fillmore]], and [[Sarge (Cars)|Sarge]] — depart for [[Tokyo]] for the first race of the Grand Prix.  Meanwhile, the lemons, who are led by weapons designer [[List of Cars characters#Professor Zündapp|Professor Zündapp]] and an unknown mastermind, are secretly plotting to secure their oil profits by using an [[electromagnetic pulse]] emitter disguised as a camera. They plan to use the emitter to trigger and destabilize the use of Allinol, an environmentally friendly fuel that was created by Axlerod and is required for racers to use in the Grand Prix. McMissile and his partner [[Holley Shiftwell]] attempt to meet with American spy car [[Rod "Torque" Redline]] at a World Grand Prix promotional event in Tokyo, to receive information about the mastermind. Redline is captured and killed by Zündapp's henchmen, but not before passing his information to Mater, who is then mistaken to be the American contact of Holley and Finn.  At the first race, three cars are ignited by the camera. McQueen places second in the race after Bernoulli, due to Mater accidentally giving him bad racing advice shortly after evading Zündapp's henchmen with help from Holley and Finn. Mater is soon abducted by Finn and boards his plane, where he helps to identify some of the information he was given. After traveling to Paris to collect more information from Finn's old friend Tomber, they travel to Porto Corsa, [[Italy]], where the next race is being held. During the race, Mater infiltrates the criminals' meeting, just as the camera is used on a few more cars, causing a multi-car pileup that allows McQueen to finish first. Due to increased fears over Allinol's safety, Axlerod lifts the requirement to use it for the final race. However, when McQueen decides to continue using it, the criminals plot to kill McQueen in the next race in [[London]]. This spooks Mater, causing him to blow his cover and allow him, Finn, and Holley to be captured.  Mater is taken to and tied up inside the clock tower of the [[Big Ben]]. Mater learns that the camera did not function on McQueen, but the criminals tell him they planted a bomb in his pits as a backup plan, spurring him to break free and escape. Finn and Holley escape soon after, but realize that the bomb is on Mater's air filter. Mater has already arrived at the pits when they tell him this, so he flees down the race course while McQueen chases after him. Finn apprehends Professor Zündapp at the finish line. The other lemons arrive and outnumber Finn, Holley, Mater, and McQueen, but they are soon rescued by the arrival of the other Radiator Springs residents. Mater then uses evidence he has seen to reveal that Axlerod is the mastermind of the plot who placed the bomb on Mater. Mater forces Axlerod to deactivate the bomb, and he and the other lemons are arrested.  Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen, while Sarge reveals that he changed McQueen's fuel from Allinol to gasoline, explaining why the camera did not work on him. Finn and Holley ask if Mater can join them on another mission, but he declines, and then participates with the World Grand Prix competitors in a race at Radiator Springs.

The conversation continues to decay into personal attacks and opinionated statements and, eventually, epithets are uttered (?).

Cassadaga (film)
 The film opens with a young boy wearing a dress while playing with a doll. He's discovered by his mother, who angrily destroys both the dress and the doll in front of him, bringing the boy to tears. This so traumatizes the boy that he castrates himself.  ''Cassadaga'' follows Lily ([[Kelen Coleman]]), a deaf woman who has traveled to [[Cassadaga, Florida]] in order to teach and grieve for her dead sister Michele (Sarah Sculco). She's also attending Cassadaga University on a scholarship provided by Claire ([[Louise Fletcher]]), who also allows her to live on her property with herself and her grandson Thomas (Lucas Beck). While staying in the town she begins dating Mike ([[Kevin Alejandro]]), the divorced father of one of her students Haley (Rachel Durose). Lily ends up visiting a psychic (Avis-Marie Barnes) after one of Mike's friends suggests it, during which time she makes a brief connection with her sister's spirit but also receives a warning about a female spirit that has attached itself to her. Soon after Lily experiences a series of terrifying visions. Meanwhile, the young boy, now an adult, is shown to be a grisly murderer that turns his corpses into marionettes.  Lily then ends up meeting Christian (Rus Blackwell), while he's inspecting a greenhouse he built for Claire, during which time he informs her that Jennifer (Amy LoCicero), the last person who won Claire's scholarship, ended up going missing. The police suspected that Thomas had killed her, but were unable to find enough evidence to arrest him. Correctly suspecting that Jennifer is haunting her, Lily convinces Mike to help her search for clues. Together they discover evidence that shows that Thomas was stalking Jennifer prior to her disappearance and also learn that Lily is unable to leave town until she puts Jennifer's spirit to rest.  Mike ends up leaving Lily because his ex-wife is using Lily's strange behaviors (due to the haunting) as a way to gain full custody of Haley. This saddens and infuriates Lily, who knocks over paintings she'd been making of her visions. Through this action she realizes that her visions have been of Claire's greenhouse. She investigates the building and finds both drugs and Jennifer's corpse. Lily is attacked by Thomas, who is promptly arrested by police arriving on the scene. While he is arrested for both the drugs and Jennifer's murder, the police discover that Thomas is not the killer. One officer, Officer Hall ([[Lucius Baston]]), goes to interview Christian, who he quickly deduces is the true murderer.  Christian murders the officer and abducts Lily, who he plans on turning into his next marionette. Lily initially manages to escape her captor and flee using a car, but is distracted and causes a car crash. As Christian approaches Lily, Jennifer appears in front of Christian, giving Lily the opportunity to attack him with a pair of scissors he dropped. This causes her to see a vision of her sister, signifying that she has come to terms with Michele's death.

 Naive and idealistic [[insurance agent]] Tim Lippe welcomes his former teacher into his home, addressing her as Mrs. Vanderhei.  After having sex with her, he reminisces about his experiences as her student. In his position as an insurance agent, he is sent to represent his company, Brownstar Insurance, at a regional conference in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], as a replacement for his co-worker, Roger Lemke, who died in an [[Erotic asphyxiation|auto-erotic asphyxiation]] accident. Tim idolized Roger, believing that his death was merely an unfortunate accident, and that he embodied all it was to be a moral Christian, the key criterion used to judge the winner of the coveted "Two Diamonds" award, which Roger had won three years in a row.   Tim's boss, Bill, pressures him to win again to ensure they keep the company afloat. At the conference, Lippe meets fellow insurance agents Ronald "Ronimal" Wilkes, Dean "Dean-Z" Ziegler, and Joan "O-Fox" Ostrowski-Fox. He also meets Bree, a sex worker who works the parking lot in front of the hotel. She affectionately calls him "Butterscotch" after he offers her candy. Initially wary of the conference-goers, he spends more time with Ron, Dean, and Joan, and develops genuine friendships, including a crush on Joan. All the insurance agents participate in a scavenger hunt. Tim is paired with Joan, and, after they win, they become intoxicated with Dean in the hotel swimming pool. Tim and Joan's sexual tension builds to a head and, after making out in the pool, they have sex in Joan's hotel room.  They were all seen in the pool by ASMI president Orin Helgesson.  The next morning, Tim is guilt-ridden and calls Vanderhei to confess, before desperately asking her to marry him. After explaining she has been sleeping with other people and desires freedom, she suggests to Tim that he take the opportunity to start a new life. Tim returns to Joan, who attempts to comfort him by telling him what Lemke was really like: she was his lover but left him after his sexual appetites became too twisted for her, and he bribed Helgesson for each one of his awards. Tim refuses to believe this and leaves Joan's room, accusing her of being a "prostitute" sent to destroy his life.  He runs into Dean and accidentally lets slip Lemke's bribery. As his friend, Dean swears to not tell anyone. After receiving advice from Dean, Tim goes to Helgesson for his assessment; it does not go well, and under the pressure he ends up also bribing Helgesson for the award, leaving him penniless and ashamed. Tim later comes across Bree and accompanies her to a party, where he gets high and inadvertently starts a fight. Ron, Joan, and Dean show up just in time to rescue him and Bree, who says she is in love with Tim.    The night ends as Bill appears at Tim's door to inform him that with the successful acquisition of another Two Diamond award, he has received a generous offer for the company; despite meaning the branch's closure, he has chosen to sell. While Bill formally announces the sale, Tim bursts in, takes over the podium, and reveals that his company has unethically acquired the award every year by bribing Helgesson and confesses to doing so himself. Helgesson flees the room, his reputation in tatters, and a furious Bill confronts Tim, his revelations having cost Bill the sale of his company. Tim responds by announcing his intention to leave the company and start another with his clients from Brownstar, 17 of which have agreed to stay with him. Bill storms off, dumbfounded.  As the four friends say their goodbyes and prepare to see each other next year, Joan and Tim are shown happy as friends, and Dean invites Ron and Tim to stay at a wealthy friend's cabin in Canada for the summer; both of them surprise Dean by gleefully accepting. The three of them go on to start their own company together called Top Notch, with Joan involved, too.

At home, So-yeon starts to have nightmares of a young girl with cat-like eyes. Later, she accompanies her friend Bo-hee to a run-down animal shelter, where she is going to adopt a cat. Bo-hee chooses a cat nicknamed "Dimwit" by the shelter staff. Alone in the cat room, So-yeon panics when the door suddenly slams shut and locks. She becomes disorientated and coughs up white hairballs, but Bo-hee soon comes for her. At the police station, Jun-seok and his fellow officers watch CCTV footage of the woman who died in the elevator. She is seen staggering and collapsing, and it's concluded that she died of a panic attack.  At the pet shop, So-yeon hallucinates seeing several dead cats in a closet. She visits Bo-hee, who is attempting to pamper Dimwit. The distressed Dimwit runs into a dark closet, but when Bo-hee follows him, she is killed by the cat-eyed girl. That night, So-yeon cuts her finger while preparing food for Bidanyi. She stains the sofa with blood, and Bidanyi licks her cut, and then the blood on the sofa, hissing aggressively when So-yeon shouts at him. The next day, she takes Bidanyi to the dead woman's husband, but he does not want him. He explains that in the days leading up to her death, his wife claimed to be haunted by a strange little girl. Disturbed, So-yeon leaves Bidanyi in a park, and helps a confused old woman to the police station. At the animal shelter, a staff member euthanizes and cremates a cat, but is pulled inside the furnace by an unseen force and burns to death.  Jun-seok and So-yeon go to the animal shelter, where they find several dead cats and the charred remains of the staff member in the furnace. Returning to the police station, So-yeon and Jun-seok learn that some time ago, there was an infestation of stray cats in the boiler room of an apartment complex. The doors and windows were cemented shut and the cats were left to suffocate. Two weeks later, a video was taken of the workers coming in to remove the dead cats, and So-yeon remarks the similarity of the recent murder victims all being found dead in a small enclosed space.  So-yeon is again approached by the old woman, who is looking for her granddaughter. When So-yeon takes her back to the police station, Jun-seok discovers that the old woman reported her missing granddaughter nine months ago, but her son closed the case. So-yeon escorts the woman back to her apartment - in the same complex where the stray cats lived in the boiler room - and Jun-seok gives her a photo of the granddaughter, who looks exactly like the cat-eyed girl. So-yeon sees the old woman's son beating his mother; he goes to confront her for watching but is killed by a horde of cats.   So-yeon goes to the complex's boiler room and is confronted by more cats. Bidyani appears, and So-yeon follows him to escape, but falls into a large canister. The cat-eyed girl appears and shows So-yeon how she died; she had once played with the cats in the boiler room, and upon hearing of the plans to kill them she attempted to hide them in the canister. While climbing out of it she fell and was paralysed, dying with the cats after the door and windows were cemented. Jun-seok arrives, finding the old woman sitting on the boiler room floor and So-yeon clutching the girl's corpse in the canister.  Having conquered her claustrophobia, So-yeon visits her father in a mental hospital, riding in an elevator for the first time without panicking. As she leaves, she and Ju-seok find a kitten underneath their car, and she kindly beckons it to come towards her.

Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay ([[Olivia Wilde]]).  However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno).  Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie ([[Leslie Mann]]) the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Dave has had a crush on.  After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Dave's life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm. On the night of her ballet recital, Cara, Dave's eldest child, is about to be pushed by another girl who has a habit of bullying her, but takes Mitch's advice and throws her to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells Mitch that she loves him and Mitch says the same thing, but feels guilty for doing so immediately after. That night, Mitch and Jamie begin to have sex with each other, but Mitch angrily finds that his guilt will not allow him to become erect, and he admits that he is not cut out for the responsibilities of an adult. Jamie comforts him, and he discreetly rests his head on her breasts.  The next day, Dave decides to take advantage of being Mitch and takes the day off. Dave does everything that he finds relaxing, including going to an aquarium and watching a showing of ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' at the theater and go-karting. After Dave finishes having fun, he calls Mitch to help show him how to act fun on his date with Sabrina that night. Mitch teaches Dave how to act like him, and finally shaves off Dave's pubic hair. Sabrina comes to meet him at a classy restaurant and, despite only originally going because Mitch told her to, they eventually legitimately start liking each other, and get tattoos. Dave walks Sabrina home, and she tells him to call her. Later, Jamie asks "Dave" about their anniversary party and he asks why Mitch was not invited. She says that he told her not to invite him because he was afraid Mitch would ruin it with his usual antics. Meanwhile, Dave is rollerblading through the park when he is called by the woman from the district manager's office and tells him that they found where the statue was moved to. Dave goes to meet Mitch and tell him, but when Dave gets there, he and Mitch imply that they want to stay each other and Dave leaves. However, Mitch forgets about the Dialogue Night that he and Jamie had planned and accidentally stands her up.  The following day, Mitch goes with the rest of the representatives to the new merger meeting between the two firms. The Japanese representatives only offer $625 million to merge, $75 million short of their hoped for $700 million. They are about to agree when Mitch says that he has noticed the firm's representatives have not started leaving, which means they are still willing to up the price, comparing the whole situation to sex and porn. He tells the moderator to tell the firm they demand $725 million and has Dave's firm's representatives begin to leave. They successfully scare the other firm into agreeing and celebrate. Mitch and Dave's family go to a gala being held by Dave's firm in honor of Dave being made partner, but Jamie is still upset over how she knows Dave will still never truly be happy.  Meanwhile, Dave and Sabrina are at a baseball game when a thunderstorm suddenly hits, and they decide to go to Mitch's house to wait it out. Sabrina tells Dave that she is going to have sex with him, and takes off her pants and bra, but when they begin, he notices a tattoo of a [[Piruna aea|many-spotted]] [[skipperling]] on her hip, the same type of butterfly his daughter said was her favorite, and regretfully leaves, saying he wants to go home.  Back at the gala, Steel is giving his speech about the amazing accomplishments Dave made over the years, and how the only thing he loves more than the law is his family. Mitch says to himself that he did not earn the title he is getting, as Dave quickly drives up to the gala, rushes in, and kisses Jamie, finally letting her know that he is who he said he was. He tells her that he loves her, and he and Mitch drive to the Peachtree Galleria, where the fountain was moved. They run in, planning to urinate in the fountain, but find it located in the center of the Galleria, where it is surrounded by hordes of people walking by. They decide to not wait and do it then, but Mitch finds that he is too embarrassed to urinate, especially after the crowd notices Dave doing so.  Mitch asks why Dave did not invite him to his anniversary party, and Dave admits that he was embarrassed of him, but has grown to respect him while he was in his body and this allows Mitch to relax enough to be able to urinate. Mitch and Dave try wishing for their original lives back, but it does not work. Security begins to come to arrest them, but on the third try the Galleria's lights go out, and they both run away before they turn back on. The confused crowd looks around, and the camera pans up to the face of the statue, once again smiling.  In the epilogue, Dave is awoken by his babies crying that night, thrilled to realize that he has finally returned in his original body. Dave continually kisses Jamie and happily goes to change the babies. At his home, Mitch awakens to enthusiastically admire himself and happily get breakfast with Sabrina, not realizing that the tattoo Dave got is a picture of his face on Mitch's back with the caption "I ♥ Dave". Mitch goes and speaks at his father's wedding and later attends Dave's anniversary a month later. In the post-credits scene, Dave and Jamie get high then go to the aquarium Dave went to earlier, while Mitch and Sabrina have sex for the first time and Mitch sends Dave the porno film he starred in.

Chhota Bheem Aur Krishna
  The movie opens with the massive army of Bhotakpur ready to battle. Their injured spy hurriedly arrives to inform them that the devil himself is coming their way. The commander shows immense bravery and commands his army to forge ahead, but within seconds he is killed by a huge dark figure who reveals himself as Kirmada. The king accepts defeat, but Kirmada says he should have done that earlier, and kills him. Terrified, the army flees.  King Indraverma is seated at his court with Bheem and his ministers, when a messenger of Kirmada arrives. He says Kirmada has ordered Induverma to open Dholakpur's gates the next day and accept defeat, the failure to do so shall seal their fate. Unmoved by his threats, Bheem says that the next day, just like any other day, Dholakpur would wake up independent. The messenger storms off, saying they would regret it later.  The next day, the army of Dholakpur arrives to battle, but to their surprise, there is no army to confront them. Bheem goes to consult the sorceress, who gifts him a magical sword, using which he would be able to defeat Kirmada. Bheem returns to the battlefield and uses the sunlight reflected from the sword to expose Kirmada's army. The battle commences; the army of Dholakpur gains an upper hand with Bheem leading from the front against Kirmada. But as soon as the sun sets, Dholakpur's army loses momentum and king Induverma is captured. Bheem is forced to surrender his sword, he and the surviving army are taken as prisoners of war. Bheem is offered to join Kirmada's army in return for his freedom, but he flatly refuses. He and his friends are sent to the dungeon where they would be fed only once in two days. They manage to fool a guard and steal a metal plate from him, using which they dig a way out of the dungeon, during the course of the next two days. While Bheem, his friends, and the general escape, Kalia, Dholu and Bholu fail to escape in time and they are captured. Bheem and his friends take refuge in a forest. They visit the sage for help, who narrates the history of Kirmada, and instructs Bheem and his friends to pray to Lord Krishna, who would surely help them.  Even after few days, when the situation is unchanged, Bheem gets tired of the same old routine and goes away to be alone for a while. When he is back, he finds his friends unconscious from consuming some toxic fruits. He hurries to fetch a doctor, but finds his way blocked by a herd of sheep and their shepherd, who reveals himself as Kanha. Bheem tries to fight him out his way, but almost falls off the cliff in the process. Kanha saves Bheem, and says he can save his friends as well. He uses some wild herbs to cure them, and humbly requests to join their circle. Resurrected, they resume their training with their new friend Kanha. Jaggu sees a small group of Kirmada's soldiers heading their way, whom they defeat easily. Kanha sets off to rescue Kalia, Dholu and Bholu (who were earlier sentenced to being fed to the tigers, for refusing to disclose Bheem's refuge hideout location). Kanha instructs Kalia to rescue King Induverma, princess Indumati and the soldiers in prison the following day, and lower the flag on the fort when they have completed their task.  With Kanha's blessings, Kalia is able to complete his job rather easily. On the other side, Bheem, his friends and Kanha are facing the massive army of Kirmada. Bheem is asked to accept defeat by Kirmada, but at exactly the same time Kalia completes his task and lowers the flag. Kirmada's army is attacked by Dholakpur's army and is defeated with ease. Kirmada goes underground and brings along a Brahmastra given to him by the devil. He hurls the weapon towards Bheem, but Kanha gets in the way. The Brahmastra on coming in contact with Kanha, turns into a garland around his neck. Kanha towers above everyone else in the battlefield, and reveals himself as [[Lord Krishna]]. On his command, Bheem finishes off Kirmada using the chariot wheel as Lord Krishna's [[Sudarshana chakra]]. The film ends with Krishna telling the viewers that whenever there is injustice and wrongdoing in the world, he will be there. All that needs to be done is to remember him, just like Bheem and his friends did.<ref name="Chhota Bheem aur Krishna"/>  
Children Who Chase Lost Voices
 Asuna Watase is a young elementary school girl who has been forced to grow up quickly ever since her father had died, while her mother, a nurse, works long shifts at a hospital. Asuna spends her solitary days listening to the mysterious music emanating from the [[Crystal radio|cat's-whisker receiver]] her father gave to her as a memento, accompanied by pet cat Mimi, who bears strange red markings on her fur.  One day, while walking to her [[wikt:playhouse|clubhouse]] across a bridge, she is attacked by a fearsome creature and saved by a mysterious teenage boy who calls himself Shun. Asuna treats Shun's wound from fighting the creature and later they both listen to Asuna's radio. Shun tells Asuna he is from another country called [[Agartha]] and that he came to this place to find something. He then gives Asuna a blessing in the form of a kiss to the forehead. Asuna leaves hurriedly and tells Shun she'll be back tomorrow. Shun, now alone, looks up at the stars and falls from the ledge to his death.  The next morning, Asuna hears from her mother that a boy was found dead in the river, but refuses to believe it's Shun. In school, Mr. Morisaki, a substitute teacher, is giving a lecture on a book which grabs Asuna's attention when he mentions Agartha, the land of the dead. After school, she visits Morisaki and asks him about Agartha. Morisaki explains that long ago when humankind was young, it needed the guidance of [[Quetzalcoatl]]s, keepers of the dead, until humans matured and no longer needed them. They went underground along with a few humans who joined them.  Afterwards, Asuna goes to her hideout to find another mysterious boy who looks like Shun standing on the ledge. Just then, a group of armed men called the Arch Angels appear, and attack the both of them. The mysterious boy hides in the underground entrance with Asuna, and the two proceed further into the cave when the cave's entrance is bombed. The two meet a Quetzacoatl who has apparently lost its physical senses and attacks the boy. He refuses to kill the gatekeeper, giving Asuna his clavis, a crystal, and fights back. The Arch Angels interfere, killing the gatekeeper. The Arch Angel commander captures Asuna and uses the clavis to open a gateway to Agartha. The commander and Asuna enter the gateway followed by the boy. Once inside the commander reveals himself to be Morisaki and the boy also reveals himself to be Shin, Shun's younger brother. Morisaki tells Shin that all he wants is to bring back his late wife from the dead. Shin leaves Asuna and Morisaki.  Morisaki tells Asuna that she can go back but she decides to accompany him. They both go into the realm via an underwater entrance. Once inside, they journey to the Gate of Life and Death which can bring the souls of people back from the dead, along with Mimi (who had snuck inside Asuna's backpack).  Upon arriving in his village, Shin is told he failed his mission to retrieve the clavis, because Asuna has unknowingly returned with a fragment of one. Shin re-embarks to stop Asuna and Morisaki from wreaking havoc in Agartha.  Along the way, Asuna is kidnapped by a race of monsters called the Izoku. She awakens in a closed area and meets a young girl named Manna; they both try to escape but are not able to. The day begins to darken and the Izoku begin to appear, but they can only move in the shadows. In their escape attempt they encounter Shin, who helps them but is wounded by an Izoku during the escape. Morisaki finds Asuna and Manna down the river as well as Shin with the help of Mimi. Shin tries to retrieve the clavis crystal fragment that belongs to Asuna. However, he is too weak to put up a fight and Morisaki easily defeats him. Asuna convinces Morisaki to take him with them while Manna leads them to her village.  Once there, the villagers are at first reluctant to help the "top-dwellers" but the village elder convinces the guards to let them in. The elder allows them to stay one night at the village because they have brought Manna back but they cannot stay more than that due to past history in that top-dwellers always bring bad luck to Agartha. Meanwhile, Asuna checks up on Shin but he yells at her to leave him alone.  The next morning, Asuna and Morisaki depart from Amaurot by boat, but Mimi no longer wants to accompany them. Shin wakes up later and finds that Mimi has passed; Shin, Manna, and the elder proceed to offer Mimi's corpse to the Quetzacoatl. When Shin sees the villagers riding away to kill them, he decides to follow, in order to protect Asuna. Morisaki and Asuna are walking towards a steep cliff when they are attacked by the villagers but they are saved by Shin. Asuna tries to climb down but is too scared, while Morisaki continues on, after trading his gun for her clavis shard and telling her to go back to the surface.  Meanwhile, Shin is fighting the villagers and is about to be killed when the villagers sense that the clavis crystal has reached the Gate of Life and Death. They leave Shin to let him wander aimlessly, having betrayed his country.  Asuna, following Morisaki's instructions to stay in the water during nighttime because of the Izoku, walks aimlessly and asks herself why she came to Agartha; she finally accepts that she came to Agartha because she was feeling lonely. When the water dries up, she is attacked by the Izoku but is saved by Shin again. The two return to the cliff after seeing the Ark of Life descending. They encounter a Quetzalcoatl who is about to die. Before he dies, the Quetzalcoatl sings its song to send all its memories into the world; Asuna now understands that the last song she heard in her world was Shun's song before he was to die. The Quetzacoatl offers to take them to the bottom of the cliff.  At the bottom of the cliff, they both find the Gate of Life and Death and enter it. Morisaki has already made a wish for his late wife Lisa to return, however, her soul requires a vessel. Asuna and Shin find Morisaki, who tells Asuna she shouldn't have come; she is soon possessed by the soul of Morisaki’s wife. But this price is insufficient; Morisaki also pays with the loss of an eye. To undo Asuna’s possession, Shin destroys the clavis crystal, despite Morisaki having a knife to his throat. Breaking the clavis brings Asuna's soul back to her body, after she has had a short reunion with Mimi and Shun. Before Lisa leaves Asuna's body, she tells Morisaki to find happiness without her. Asuna is now back to her normal self but Morisaki is devastated and asks Shin to kill him. Shin tells him that carrying the burden of a deceased loved one is humanity's curse, telling Morisaki to live on. Asuna heads back to the surface and is seen making her farewell to Shin and Morisaki, who chose to stay behind. The film ends with an older Asuna looking out her window at the cliff side where she had met Shun and Shin. She then says her goodbyes to her mother as she hurries to her graduation ceremony.  
Children (2011 film)
 The film is based on the true story of the [[Frog Boys]] of [[Daegu]]. On March 26, 1991, the local elections are being held. Since it is a school day off, the five boys set off to the nearby mountain and never return. Their parents try to get the police to investigate right away, but the authorities are more concerned about guarding the election poles. Days later, thousands of police set on the mountain to search for clues as to what may have happened but nothing turns up. The parents take their pleas for the boys’ return to the airways where their story captures the heart, mind and sometimes imagination of the nation. Various theories such as the involvement of North Korean spies and alien abduction comes up.   In 1996, a career-driven documentary maker, Kang Ji-seung is transferred to the small town after being disgraced for rigging an award-winning documentary. He then decides to investigate the case in the hopes of making a comeback. He teams up with an equally ambitious professor who hopes to make a name for himself by solving the crime where police failed. The professor’s theory, which seems to have quite a bit of compelling evidence behind it, takes the pair in a direction that the police were reluctant to investigate.   The professor has the telephone recording of someone claiming to be one of the missing boys calling up his parents' home. However, the mother does not appear to be shocked to receive a call from her son. This leads the professor to suspects that the father and mother of this boy may know more than they have been letting on. While visiting the boys' home, everyone, from the boy's parents to his grandmother act strangely. The professor convinces the authorities to dig up the boy's home, but they find nothing. Nevertheless, the accusation destroys the family's reputation and the father dies without having cleared his name. Kang Ji-seung is soon transferred back to the city while the professor losses his job at the university.   Then in September 2001, the remains of the children were found in the woods on the same mountainside the children said they were visiting by two men who were gathering acorns. At first police claim it seemed likely that the boys got lost and froze to death during the night. The parents refuse to believe this since their sons used to play in the area all the time. Also, the search party have searched this area as well but nothing came up at the time. After learning that the remains were found, Kang Ji-seung visits the forensic lab and learns that two of the skulls bear large holes and one has strange indentations made from an unidentified instrument. Their clothes were tied into knots used by sailors and bullet casings were found in the shallow, makeshift grave.   Meanwhile, [[Seoul]] is shaken by the news of the disappearance of two children in the city. Kang Ji-seung meets with the police officer who investigated the missing boys' case ten years ago. The officer reveals that on the night after the boys disappeared, he came across a mysterious young man who is always seen fishing in the area. However, the man fled in his jeep when the officer approached him. The officer decided to keep this a secret since Korea has a statute of limitation on major crimes and in 2006 it ran out on the case. Even if the killer was found at this point, he cannot be prosecuted. So, the officer decided to wait for him to commit another crime in order to trap him. To add to the mystery, the area where the remains were found had been searched numerous times since the boys were known to play there and yet, almost a decade later, their bodies suddenly show up there.   Through his license plate, Kang Ji-seung tracks the man down and breaks into his apartment when he is not home. To Kang Ji-seung's horror, there is a box containing little things owned by children. He also finds stacks of books tied up in knots used by sailors. Kang Ji-seung decides to wait for the culprit outside his apartment building to confront him when he gets home. However, Kang Ji-seung falls asleep and the culprit, realizing he is being watched, takes a picture of the reporter's car. The next morning, Kang Ji-seung's daughter goes missing. However, she is found soon after and claims she was helped by a man driving a passing by truck. Kang Ji-seung chases the truck down to a slaughter house. He confronts the suspect, who refuses to confess but hints that he might be the killer. Since Kang Ji-seung has no evidence to have the man arrested, he watches as the suspect walks away, presumably to escape from the city.

He announces that in a news telecast, all the stray dogs roaming about in residential buildings in Mumbai will be caught and terminated and gives an excuse that it is done so that Mumbai becomes safer- and declares the slogan as "Safe Mumbai and Safe Mumbaikar". He further informs that the dog can only be saved if the society files a NO OBJECTION CERTIFICATE within 1 month. Chillar party, shocked by this, strives hard to get the NOC- wherein they have to get at least more than 50% votes of the total residents in the society i.e. 31 votes.

Whilst all this chaos is going on, a t.v channel invites Bhide and the Chillar party for an interview. Seeing this as their last chance, they attend the interview which is being telecast across India. Knowing that that is the last day and dog catchers are after Bhidu, they pray hard to save him. During the interview they are constantly mocked by Bhide and asked if all these dirty tricks and uncultured techniques were taught to them by the textbook. As he asks to stop the telecast, Silencer, who doesn't speak at all, speaks for the first time. He opens his textbook and reads out loud "We must always help others" followed by others reading out "A friend in need is a friend indeed" and "We must do what is  right". Overwhelmed by this the whole audience gives them a loud round of applause. Whilst in the society, dog catchers are already searching for Bhidu. The paper containing 30 votes is before the secretary, Mr. Tandon while he's watching the telecast. He resents Chillar party and is a close associate of minister Bhide. He was asked to give away Bhidu since this issue originated in his society. Chillar party pleads to leave and the interviewers agree. When they reach the society, they are disheartened as there is no sight of Bhidu. Suddenly Bhidu comes jumping in, wearing a collar reading "Bhidu- Chandan Nagar Society". While they were happy seeing Bhidu, they see the NOC on the desk with 31st sign – belonging to Tandon.

Xiaoqian also falls in love with Yan, and while he feeds her candy, she says she will fall in love with anyone who fed her candy. After some time, she begs him to kill her because humans and demons are not supposed to be together. Yan stabs her with his magic dagger, which does not kill Xiaoqian, but causes her to lose her memory of their relationship. Yan arrives late for a battle against the Tree Demon, Laolao, and sees that several of his fellow demon hunters have already fallen. The last one, Xia Xuefenglei, embeds his arm into Laolao and tells Yan to chop it off, thereby banishing Laolao from the mortal world.  Many years later, a tax collector named Ning Caichen passes by a village near Black Hill and stops to drink from a well. He is surrounded by the villagers, who initially accused him of stealing water because they are experiencing a drought, but later mistake him for an official sent by the government to help them find a new water source. Glad to be free, Ning goes up the hill, accompanied by a guide and five convicts, the only men the villagers are willing to send away with him. They stop for a break in a glade, and Ning goes inside a hollow tree and offers candy to a tiny, pale fox he sees there. A strange wind blows and they all run up the hill to a temple called Lanruo Temple, where they find a well. While Ning investigates the well, the other men notice some beautiful women in the temple and follow them further in. The women are actually demons in disguise and they suck the life out of the men to feed Laolao with "life energy". Xiaoqian shows up and attempts to seduce Ning, but he rejects her. Yan Chixia arrives and starts slaying the other demons. Ning and Xiaoqian flee and hide in a tree, where he offers her candy.  The next day, Ning goes back to the temple with an underwater bomb, intending to blow up the well and release water for the village. He is attacked by two snake demons but Xiaoqian protects him from them and is injured herself in the explosion. Yan saves them, and he ties Ning to a horse and sends him back to the village while he uses his magic powers to heal Xiaoqian. Ning escapes, knocks Yan out and ties him to a tree. Laolao later insists that Xiaoqian feeds on Ning but she sends him away. Laolao punishes Xiaoqian while the villagers hold a feast for Ning. Ning leaves the village and frees Yan, who tells him that Xiaoqian is actually a demon. Ning still goes to the temple to bring Xiaoqian away with him. Laolao attempts to trap Yan by creating an illusion but Yan recognises the danger. In the meantime, Ning allows Xiaoqian to tap on his "life energy" to help her heal faster, after which they have sex.  The next morning, Laolao appears before Xiaoqian and tells Xiaoqian that her body is still in Lanruo Temple so she can never be together with Ning. Yan arrives and drags Xiaoqian away. Just then, Xia Xuefenglei and his younger sister Xia Bing show up and they defeat Yan and lock Xiaoqian in a magic cage. They tie up Yan in front of the cage so that he can watch Xiaoqian disintegrate before his eyes. Back in the village, the villagers start transforming into trees because the water they drank is cursed. While Xuefenglei goes to the temple to destroy Laolao and end the curse, Ning frees Yan and Xiaoqian.  Xuefenglei defeats the two snake demons but Laolao is now free. Yan shows up and rescues Xuefenglei. Xiaoqian, Ning and Xia Bing also arrive. While Yan and Xuefenglei fight with Laolao, Xia Bing uses magic to open the frozen well and Ning climbs inside to find Xiaoqian's body. Laolao absorbs Xiaoqian's spirit into her own body. Ning frees the spirits trapped by Laolao and they start attacking her. Yan uses his magic mirror to knock Xiaoqian's spirit out of Laolao and transfers himself into Laolao's body. Ning finds Xiaoqian's body in the form of the tiny, white fox. Yan and Laolao transfigure between each other. When Yan gains control of their shared body, he pulls his magic dagger out of Xiaoqian's head and she suddenly recalls everything about their past romance. Yan stabs himself with the dagger to kill Laolao, but he is also mortally wounded in the process.  Xiaoqian and a dying Yan are reunited again. Xiaoqian tells Ning to put her body down so that she can disappear together with the temple, which is now falling apart.

A Cinderella Story: Once Upon a Song
  In 2012, 17-year-old aspiring singer Katie Gibbs ([[Lucy Hale]]) is over-worked, bullied, and constantly harassed by her stepfamily—[[stepmother|mother]] Gail ([[Missi Pyle]]), teenage sister Bev ([[Megan Park]]), and young brother Victor (Matthew Lintz). Despite how badly they treat her, Katie does their bidding with no complaints in fear that they might put her in foster care and is only putting up their emotional abuse until she turns 18 and graduates from High School.  In a dream, Katie performs a music video for her hit single ("Run This Town"). Then Victor wakes her up, demanding breakfast. At the Wellesley Academy of the Arts, of which Gail is headmistress, Guy Morgan (Dikran Tulaine)—president of Massive Records, Inc.—enrolls his son Luke ([[Freddie Stroma]]). Katie, wanting to change her life for the better, sneaks her demo CD into Guy's briefcase. Guy wants Luke to produce an upcoming showcase at the Academy; Luke, however, is less than excited about following in his dad's footsteps.  Back at home, Bev ([[Megan Park]]) wants to win a recording contract with Guy. Bev, however, is a terrible singer; the more she practices, the worse she sounds. Guy calls Gail, who is shocked to hear that he loves Katie's demo. Gail lies, claiming it was Bev's demo and that Katie stole it. Meanwhile, Victor steals Katie's clothes and towel while she showers, locking her out of the house naked. Unable to get back inside, Katie trips over a visiting Luke; thinking fast, she covers herself up using the WELCOME mat. Amused by the situation, Luke gives her his jacket. While Bev welcomes Luke, Gail barges into Katie's room and forces her to sing. Then, after shoving Luke out of the house, Gail plans to get Bev a record deal by using Katie's voice. Bev is reluctant, but goes along with this in order to win Luke's affections.  At school, Katie and her best friend Angela ([[Jessalyn Wanlim]]) hear Luke singing. The entranced Katie writes a song of her own, for him, and admits that she likes him. Angela urges Katie to sing for him at the Bollywood Ball that night, and gives her a costume to wear. Then Gail barges in.  Gail orders Katie to babysit Victor tonight, since she wants ''Bev'' to win Luke over at the Ball. Katie pleads with Tony ([[Manu Narayan]]), Gail's guru (who is no real guru but just a method actor from New Jersey who needed the work) to watch Victor while she goes to the Ball. There Katie leads Luke outside and sings ("Extra Ordinary"). He is entranced by her voice. Angela challenges Gail to a [[Bollywood]] dance-off ("Oh Mere Dilruba"). Gail loses and then leaves the Ball. Katie tries to beat Gail home, but with no success. Now it's Katie's turn to get blackmailed: Gail vows to expel Angela from the Academy—which will ruin her chances of getting into [[Juilliard]]—unless Katie sings for Bev. To save Angela's dance career, Katie goes along with Gail.  Luke wants to find the girl who sang for him. In the music room, he sees Bev lip-syncing to Katie's voice ("Make You Believe"). Jumping to the obvious-but-wrong conclusion, Luke falls for Bev and invites her to write more songs with him. Much to Bev's horror, he treats her out to a restaurant that evening. Luke is amazed by Bev's musical aptitude, unaware that Katie is texting to her what she should say (because Bev forced her to help). The next day, Luke drops by Bev's house and hits it off with Victor, to whom he gives guitar lessons. Katie also reconnects with Luke, who doesn't like it when she has to head out again—this time, to throw away Gail's prized portrait, which Victor has ruined by cutting out her face. Bev cuts in on Luke, whom she then forces Victor to help her deceive by using miniature electronic-communication devices, so that Katie can coach her through another date. Katie puts together a song on the spot ("Possibilities"), which Luke sings, thinking it's Bev's. She and Luke kiss, which breaks Katie's heart. Victor takes notice of Katie's distress and sympathizes with her.  Luke falls in love with Bev, unaware that her singing and songwriting talents are actually Katie's. Later, Gail reveals that she has access to the savings account opened by Katie's late father; ergo, if Katie doesn't submit to her stepfamily's will, she'll be cut off without a cent. Victor also discovers that his family's money is rightfully Katie's. As it turns out, Victor himself is frequently mistreated by Bev and their mom; he shares no more affection with them than Katie does and he only went along with their mistreatment of Katie because he was afraid of his Mother and older sister and he was [[child abuse|afraid]] of what they would do to him if he did not go along with it. Feeling guilty over not having had a better relationship with Katie over the years—among other things, she's the only one who remembers his birthday—Victor agrees to help expose the fraud perpetrated by his family.    At the showcase, Victor sabotages Bev's performance of ("Make You Believe") by destroying her [[iPhone]], on which is Katie's recorded singing voice. After threatening to drown Victor in the kitchen sink for what he's just done, Gail forces Katie to sing live backstage. Luke trips over what's happening; he realizes at last that Bev is a fake, and that beautiful voice is actually Katie's.  During Bev's second performance, Luke steals a videocamera and films Katie singing backstage, thus exposing the whole charade. Gail tries to stop Luke, but Tony stops her first. Victor and Angela bring Katie onstage to perform another song ("Bless Myself"). Katie and Luke admit their feelings for each other. Guy also loves Katie's performance, and green-lights Luke to produce an album for her. He even agrees to help Angela get into [[Juilliard]].  In a [[mid-credits scene]], Guy vows to tell the school board what he thinks of Gail, who is removed as headmistress of Wellesley Academy. Even Bev is delighted to be rid of her mom, being no stranger herself to Gail's manipulative ways. Gail soon finds herself back to where she started 23 years before: singing (horribly) at a ranch, where she is bombarded with fruit and booed off the stage.

Codebreaker (film)
 The film starts in October 1952 after [[Alan Turing]] ([[Ed Stoppard]]) has been convicted. He is talking to his psychiatrist, Dr. Franz Greenbaum ([[Henry Goodman]]). Dr. Greenbaum and Alan continue to discuss; Alan informs Dr. Greenbaum that he cannot talk about his war time activities. Dr. Greenbaum informs him that he can talk about anything he wants. Sir [[Dermot Turing]], nephew of Alan, is shown and he goes on to explain how life was for John Turing (Alan's brother) and Alan Turing during their childhood. [[David Leavitt]] appears next and talks about Turing's school time activities. David further explains that Turing was good at mathematics and athletics. His favourite sport was running.  The scene shifts backs to the discussion between Turing and Dr. Greenbaum. Turing speaks about a school friend he was interested in, [[Christopher Morcom]]. They were in different houses so they could meet a couple of times a week. Turing worked on improving his handwriting because Christopher would make fun of it. Turing goes on to explain that he cared more about what Christopher thought about him than what he thought of himself. [[Christopher Morcom QC]] (nephew of Christopher Morcom) goes on to explain that Christopher and Turing became close friends during their school days. They were planning to join [[Cambridge University]] but on 13 February 1930 Christopher died.  The scene again shifts backs to the discussion between Turing and Dr. Greenbaum. Turing informs him that he wrote letters to Christopher's mother and even managed to acquire his photograph. He still has the photograph in his wallet, and he shows it to Dr. Greenbaum. Turing later goes on to publish his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]".<ref name=TuringArchive></ref> A computer in those days did not mean a [[computer|machine]], it meant [[a person who calculates]] or computes. Turing proposes automating these tasks, proposing a [[universal Turing machine]]. It involved performing [[mathematical operations using zeros and ones]]. This became the basis of modern computers. [[Steve Wozniak]] goes on to explain how normal people these days carry and use Turing machines in the form of mobile phones, cameras, computers, etc. [[Alma Whitten]] explains that there are almost no fields of modern science and everyday life which are not impacted by a Turing machine.  As World War II broke out, he was recruiting to be part of [[Government Communications Headquarters]] based at [[Bletchley Park]]. It was a diverse group of people consisting of mathematicians, chess players and crossword puzzle solvers. [[Asa Briggs]] goes on to say "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius".<ref name=huffingtonpost2></ref> The Germans were coding their messages using [[Enigma machine]], which the Germans believed was unbreakable.  Turing speaks about proposing to [[Joan Clarke]] and how he broke the news that he had [[homosexual]] tendencies. But midway through he realized he could not continue with the relationship and called off the engagement. Turing admits he knew it would hurt Joan but he knew it was better to hurt her now rather than cheat on her and hurt her later. David Leavitt goes on explain how Alan Turing goes on to decrypt the German messages. Alan Turing designs the [[Bombe]] to decipher German [[Enigma-machine]]-encrypted [[Ultra|secret messages]].  Turing and Dr. Greenbaum continue to discuss if something like human consciousness can be kept in an inorganic vessel. The documentary now concentrates on Turing's paper on [[artificial intelligence]] "[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]". The movie now concentrates on Turing's sexuality and his interaction with Arnold Murray which finally leads to his downfall. Turing and Dr. Greenbaum discuss Turing's relationship with Arnold Murray. Turing explains that Arnold had moved into his house and he felt Arnold was stealing money from him. One day when he came home he found his father's pocket watch and other items missing. When Turing asked Arnold, Arnold admitted his friend Harry committed the burglary. Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Dr. Greenbaum explains to him that he should not have told them bluntly that he was homosexual.  Turing entered a plea of "guilty", despite feeling no remorse or guilt for having committed acts of homosexuality. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation, which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. The documentary goes on to explain the impact of those events on Turing. During this stage Turing writes an article called "[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]" describing the way in which non-uniformity (natural patterns such as stripes, spots and spirals) may arise naturally out of a homogeneous, uniform state.  Turing was targeted by government officials, which led him to feel that he could never have a normal life. The hormonal treatment also started having impact on him. Turing admits to Dr. Greenbaum that he should have gone to prison instead of taking the hormonal treatment. During another interaction with Dr. Greenbaum, Turing speaks about killing himself by using a poisoned apple like in the story "[[Snow White]]". The movie explains that On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed. A post-mortem examination established that the cause of death was [[cyanide poisoning]].

Conan the Barbarian (2011 film)
 Conan is the son of Corin, chief of a barbarian tribe. The youth is a skilled but violent warrior, who his father believes is not ready to wield his own sword. Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria. The Mask, crafted by a group of sorcerers and used to subjugate the world, was broken into many pieces, scattered among the barbarian tribes. After locating Corin's piece of the mask, and murdering the entire village, Zym leaves. Conan, the only survivor, swears revenge.  Years later, Conan is a pirate but still seeks revenge. He encounters a slave colony and frees it by killing the slave handlers. In the city of Messantia, he encounters Ela-Shan, a thief being chased by Lucius, one of Zym's soldiers from years before. He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the prisoners escape and Ela-Shan tells Conan he will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon. Lucius is killed by the prisoners.  Zym and his daughter, the sorceress Marique, attack a monastery to find the pure-blood descendant. Sensing something is wrong, Fassir, an elderly monk, tells one of his students, Tamara, to run away and return to her birthplace. When Fassir refuses to reveal his knowledge of the descendant, Zym kills him. Marique slays several priestesses. Tamara's carriage is chased by Zym's men, but Conan rescues her, kills three of her pursuers, and captures Remo. After forcing him to reveal Tamara's importance as the pure-blood, Conan catapults Remo into Zym's nearby camp, killing him.  Zym and Marique confront Conan, who pretends to be interested in exchanging Tamara for gold. Conan attacks Zym, but Marique invokes soldiers made of sand, and poisons Conan with a boomerang sword. Tamara rescues him and they return to Conan's ship, where his friend Artus helps Conan recover. The boat is attacked by Zym's men, who kill several of Conan's men, but are defeated. Conan orders Artus to return to Messantia with Tamara and departs to confront Zym in his kingdom. Artus tells Tamara that Conan left a map behind and she follows him, meeting with him in a cave, where they have sex. The next day, as she is returning to the boat, Zym's men and daughter capture her.  Conan learns of Tamara's capture and departs to Argalon, where he asks Ela-Shan to help him break into Zym's castle. Zym prepares to drain Tamara's blood, mending the mask. He plans to use the girl's body as a vessel for his wife's soul. After confronting an octopus-like monster that guards the dungeons and killing its handlers, Conan infiltrates Zym's followers, kills a guard, steals his robe, and watches as Zym puts on the empowered mask. Conan releases Tamara, and she escapes as he battles Zym, reclaiming the sword Marique had stolen from his father. Marique attacks Tamara, but Conan hears Tamara's scream and cuts off Marique's hand. Tamara kicks her into a pit, where she is impaled. Zym swears revenge upon Conan.  Conan and Tamara are trapped on a bridge as Zym attacks. He uses the mask's power to call forth the spirit of his deceased wife, Maliva, a powerful sorceress, and her spirit begins to possess Tamara's body. She begs Conan to let her fall, but he refuses and instead destroys the bridge before jumping to safety with Tamara. Zym falls into the lava crying out to his wife.  Conan and Tamara escape and he returns her to her birthplace, telling her that they'll meet again. He then returns to Corin's village and tells the memory of his father that he has avenged his death and recovered the sword Marique stole from him, restoring his honor.  
Come Rain, Come Shine
 The film opens with a 9-minute [[long take]] of a married couple riding in a car together. After several minutes of small talk, the woman ([[Im Soo-jung (actress)|Im Soo-jung]]) tells the man ([[Hyun Bin]]) that she's leaving him for another man. The rest of the film takes place in the couple's home during a rainstorm on their last day together, as the husband helps his wife pack. Various quiet, introspective scenes show them doing things such as making coffee, smoking a cigarette, and reminiscing over nostalgic items. While eating together, the woman asks the man why he isn't angry with her, saying that he has a right to be. The man says that he knows she doesn't change her mind when she decides on something and feels that he is partially to blame for their rift. She then accuses the man of being selfish for acting as "the perfect man" during their breakup. Their conversation is interrupted by the meowing of a lost kitten outside. They bring it inside, but it escapes and hides elsewhere in the house. Soon, their neighbors come looking for the kitten and are invited inside. Strained conversation ensues, and the neighbors inform the couple that the rain has flooded the roads, preventing travel to Seoul. The husband answers a phone call from his wife's new lover and passes it to her. She tells him she'll have to put off leaving until the next day due to the flooding. He asks her, "Is there anything holding you back?" To which she doesn't answer. The neighbors leave without the kitten, telling the couple to call them when it comes out. Now unable to go to their planned dinner reservation, the couple prepares dinner together. The man begins sniffling while cutting onions, and goes to the bathroom to wash his eyes, silently standing while letting the faucet run. The film ends with the kitten coming out of hiding and the woman telling it that everything is going to be okay.  
Come as You Are (film)
 The [[Flemish]] boys Lars, Philip and Jozef are somewhere between 20 and 30 years of age and each has a physical handicap. Jozef is almost blind and needs to use a [[Magnifying glass|magnifier]]. Philip suffers from [[paraplegia]]. He can only move his head and can use one hand which gives him the strength to control his automated [[wheelchair]]. Lars has an incurable [[brain tumor]] a side effect of which is that he is restricted to a wheelchair as a result of his increasing paralysis.  The three are good friends and visit each other frequently.  Philip, who is able to control a [[computer keyboard]] with a mouthpiece, had a conversation with a man who lost his legs during his last holiday at the Dutch sea-side. That man frequently visits a luxury [[brothel]] in [[Spain]] which is specialized to host men with a handicap. Philip convinces Lars and Jozef to organize a trip to Spain "as they do not want to die as a virgin". Of course, they have to convince their parents but are afraid to tell them the real reason about the trip. That's why they deceive them and tell them that they are only going to visit some wine gardens in [[France]] and [[Spain]]. As Lars already made a well-organized plan about the trip and found a tour guide who is specialized in "holidays for people with a handicap" the parents eventually agree.  Some days before departure, Lars goes to his doctor for approval to make the trip, but it seems his brain tumor has grown. His doctor advises to cancel his trip. Philip and Jozef initially cancel as well since they do not want to abandon Lars. Lars however insists that the trip should continue, so they decide to leave sneakily. However, the tour operator can't make the trip any more as it was cancelled by the parents, and does not want to jeopardize his professional and private life by ignoring the wishes of the parents. The tour operator takes pity and decides to send Claude, who also owns a specialized bus.  They are surprised when Claude seems to be an oversized, unattractive, grouchy woman who does not understand [[Flemish]] ''(as she lives in [[Brussels]])''. Philip and Lars dislike Claude and always use abusive [[Dutch language]] to describe "the insensible [[mammoth]]-looking woman". Neither Philip nor Lars speak [[French language|French]], so Jozef becomes the interpreter. He is more friendly towards Claude and can't laugh with the remarks of Philip and Lars.  Claude seems not to be very sociable. She only drives the boys to their different destinations and separates herself during each break. She does want to help the boys, but is always refused. The three are convinced they do not need Claude as "a replacement for their parents" and can handle the situation. Soon, they discover this is not that easy.  Claude insists that the boys must accept her as they do need her help as a nurse. The three are surprised when they discover Claude does understand the [[Dutch language]]. They are embarrassed and ask Claude to forgive their misbehaviour, which she accepts. The following days are very entertaining and Claude decides to overnight in open sky. The next day, she drives them to a hotel. The three are led to a meeting room and are astonished when they meet their parents. They were able to locate their sons via the original tour operator who gave them the mobile number of Claude. Claude, who got a call of the parents, could not refuse the parents' request to drive them to this hotel. She is just out of prison due to maltreatment of her previous husband and does not want to get into new problems. The parents want to take their children back to [[Belgium]]. Philip and Lars get very aggressive and scream they do not want to be treated like children. Lars insists that his parents let them continue the trip. Eventually, they approve of their sons continuing the trip to Spain with Claude as a guide. Once they arrive Claude surprises them by taking them to a villa instead of the foreseen bungalow, which is a present from the parents.  The boys decide that they want to see the night-life of the Spanish town. Claude brings them to the centre and allows them to take off by themselves. They try to strike up a conversation with a couple of girls and invite them to go to a restaurant together. Although the girls provide them with a recommendation, they are reluctant to join and state they don't have enough time, so the boys take off on their own. On the way to the restaurant, Lars is taken aside by a different girl which he had met before in a shop. He instructs Philip and Jozef to continue without him and takes off with the girl. Later on they are talking but Lars gets sick and gets embarrassed. When Philip and Jozef return to the bus after dinner, they find Lars already there, clearly upset. Philip starts ranting about Lars ditching them, but Jozef tells him to 'shut up'.  The first visit at the brothel is a disaster as Lars gets ill. During their next visit, Jozef does not want to go as he fell in love with Claude. This seems to be mutual and the two have sex in the tour bus. Lars and Philip enjoy their visit in the brothel. That night, the group decides to sleep on the beach. Next morning, Philip finds a dead Lars. Philip is picked up by his parents to travel to Belgium by aeroplane, whereas Jozef decides to stay with his new girlfriend Claude who drives him back to Belgium on her bus.  
Combat Girls
 The film begins showing Marisa ([[Alina Levshin]]) dying on a cold shore somewhere in Germany. She and her friend Svenja (Jella Haase), who is with her, remember how it came to this. The film follows the journey of the two girls as they move into and out of a neonazi group.  As a little girl Marisa is taught by her grandfather (Klaus Manchen) how to carry a heavy sandsack. Only when she meets his expectations he gives his "combat girl" a loving hug. She has no clue her beloved grandfather used to harass and even beat Marisa's mother for being pregnant.  The twenty-year-old Marisa still lives in the same town and cherishes her grandpa. She visits him regularly in hospital where he lies ill, soon dying. Yet at the weekends she meets with her [[gang]] of violent nazis [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] [[Working class|lower class]] kids. She and her boyfriend Sandro (Gerdy Zint) who violently attacks ethnic looking passengers on a tram and moreover attack a conductor. After that [[police]] raids her house while she is watering her Grandpa's flowers. Both she and Sandro are arrested and Sandro consequently has to go to [[prison]].  Meanwhile, it is made clear that Svenja's stepfather is incredibly strict on her, which she rebels against. She meets a 19-year-old boy who works for her family in their garden and they start hanging out. He turns out to be friends with Marisa and a neonazi like her. Svenja is very intrigued by the violent, partying, in-the-moment life-style these young nazis live and slowly becomes more involved.  However Sandro is eventually about to be released. Marisa's mother (Rosa Enskat) cannot stand the thought of Sandro moving in with her daughter while Marisa even wants to have a child with him. Mother and daughter have a dispute over that matter in the local grocery shop. Marisa is the till girl of that shop. After her fight with her mother two young immigrants (Sayed Ahmad Wasil Mrowat as Rasul and Najebullah "Najeb" Ahmadi as Jamil) become the target of her bad mood. She refuses them as customers.<ref></ref>  Later Marisa and her gang enjoy themselves at the shore. They consume a lot of alcohol and chant aggressive [[slogan]]s about Marisa's two former customers, who happen to be there as well, however they stand their ground. Rasul and Jamil come around and are chased off the shore. The appalled Rasul breaks the side mirror of Marisa's car as he parts. Marisa runs to her car and follows them when they try to escape on Jamil's scooter. She uses her car as a weapon, rams them, pushing them of the road at high speed. Then she commits [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]]. Back with her friends she attempts to drown her qualms in alcohol. At this point Svenja and her new friend has also shown up at the beach.  When Marisa sees Rasul again at her workplace, he is short of money. Even so, she lets him do his shopping after all. But Rasul's situation exacerbates. As a result of the accident his brother Jamal's papers have been checked officially and he is deported. As a result, Rasul is supposed to live in an [[orphanage]]. He eludes his custodians and is caught red-handed during [[shoplifting]]. Marisa gets violent against her own mother just to free Rasul before she follows him to his hiding place where he offers her a drink.  Sandro leaves prison and Marisa picks him up and complies with his wish to visit a [[Neo-Nazism|neo-nazi]] party where Sandro buys the [[pistol]] of an old [[Austria]]n [[nazi]]. He frightens off another young man called Markus (Lukas Steltner) who sells drugs at the party. But little later Markus blindsides Sandro with some accomplices. Sandro receives a heavy trashing. He attempts to restore his self-confidence by forcing himself on Marisa. Afterwards he also threatens a number of immigrants with his pistol and beats up Rasul when he sees him in front of Marisa's House where Marisa invited.  Marisa decides to help Rasul to get to the country of his dreams, [[Sweden]], and accompany him. His uncle lives in Sweden. She also decides that her friend Svenja (Jella Haase) shall come with them because she recently ran away from home with a large sum of money. She uses a [[baseball bat]] on Sandro who opposes her plan to get away from him and take revenge. But Sandro catches up when they reach [[Rügen]] because Svenja calls him and asks him to pick her up. Instead he comes over and shoots Marisa dead minutes after Rasul leaves by sea.  
Conception (film)
 It opens with a group of students wanting to know where babies come from and the teacher not knowing exactly how to handle it. This bookends the various scenes with the nine couples.  Nine couples have their own different issues that they deal with and must deal with the notion of conceiving a child.  
Coriolanus (film)
 In [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], riots are in progress after stores of grain are withheld from citizens and civil liberties are reduced due to a war between Rome and neighbouring [[Volsci]]. The rioters are particularly angry at [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus|Caius Martius]] ([[Ralph Fiennes]]), a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the city's problems. During a march, the rioters encounter Martius, who is openly contemptuous and does not hide his low opinion of the regular citizens. The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius ([[Gerard Butler]]), who has fought Martius on several occasions and considers him a mortal enemy, swears that the next time they meet in battle will be the last. Martius leads a raid against the Volscian city of [[Corioli|Corioles]] and during the siege, with much of Martius's unit being killed, Martius gathers reinforcements and the Romans take the city. After the battle, Martius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which results in both men being wounded but ends when Aufidius' soldiers drag him away from the fight.  Martius returns to Rome victorious and in recognition of his great courage, General Cominius ([[John Kani]]) gives him the [[agnomen]] of "Coriolanus". Coriolanus's mother [[Volumnia]] ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]) encourages her son to run for consul within the [[Roman Senate]]. Coriolanus is reluctant but he eventually agrees to his mother's wishes. He easily wins the Roman Senate and seems at first to have won over the commoners as well due to his military victories. Two [[tribunes]], Brutus ([[Paul Jesson]]) and Sicinius ([[James Nesbitt]]), are critical of his entrance into politics, fearing that his popularity would lead to Coriolanus taking power away from the Senate for himself. They scheme to undo Coriolanus and so stir up another riot in opposition to him becoming consul. When they call Coriolanus a [[treason|traitor]], Coriolanus bursts into rage and openly attacks the concept of popular rule as well as the citizens of Rome, demonstrating that he still holds the plebeians in contempt. He compares allowing citizens to have power over the senators as to allowing "crows to peck the eagles". The tribunes term Coriolanus a traitor for his words and order him banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who will banish Rome from his presence: "There is a world elsewhere".  After being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of [[Antium]] and offers to let Aufidius kill him, to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus and allow him to lead a new assault on the city, so that he can claim vengeance on the city which he feels betrayed him. Coriolanus and Aufidius lead a Voscilian attack on Rome. Panicked, Rome sends General Titus to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance; when Titus reports his failure, Senator [[Agrippa Menenius Lanatus|Menenius]] ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) follows but is also shunned. In response, Menenius, who has seemingly lost all hope in Coriolanus and Rome, commits suicide by a river bank. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet with her son, along with Coriolanus' wife [[Virgilia]] ([[Jessica Chastain]]) and his son. Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome and Coriolanus makes peace between the Volscians and the Romans alongside General Cominius. When Coriolanus returns to the Volscian border, he is confronted by Aufidius and his men, who now also brand him as a traitor. They call him Martius and refuse to call him by his "stolen name" of Coriolanus. Aufidius explains to Coriolanus how he put aside his hatred so that they could conquer Rome but now that Coriolanus has prevented this, he has betrayed the promise between them. For this betrayal, Aufidius and his men attack and kill Coriolanus.  
Contagion (film)
 Returning from a Hong Kong business trip, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago to rendezvous with a former lover before returning to her family in suburban Minneapolis. She appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her six-year-old son from a previous marriage, Clark, also becomes symptomatic and is sent home from school. Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause.  Mitch returns home and finds that Clark has also died from a similar infection. Mitch is placed in isolation but seems to be immune to the disease. He is released and returns home to his teenage daughter Jory, though they are unsure if she has inherited his immunity. She decides to stay with her father regardless, since he's now all alone. Mitch struggles to protect his daughter from the risk of infection, while learning that his wife was unfaithful to him prior to her death. Meanwhile, everyone who had contact with Emhoff begins to spread the disease around the world.  In Atlanta, representatives of the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and express fears that the disease is a [[Biological weapon|bio weapon]] terror attack over the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an [[Epidemic Intelligence Service]] officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the U.S. outbreak to Emhoff, while also dealing with local bureaucrats who are initially reluctant to commit to a proper public health response. After successfully setting up [[triage]] camps in large venues, Dr. Mears becomes infected. Her evacuation is postponed, as airports begin to close in anticipation of a quarantine. She later dies and is buried in a mass grave. As more and more people become infected with no cure in sight, [[social order]] begins to decay, with rampant looting of stores and homes. The U.S. President is moved underground while emergency services suffer absenteeism and no longer respond. Mitch and Jory attempt to escape to Wisconsin, but the borders are closed.  At the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig and bat viruses. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a [[cell culture]] within which to grow the newly named [[Meningoencephalitis]] Virus One (MEV-1).  [[UCSF]] professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from the CDC to destroy his samples, and on Day 12, with over 8 million already infected worldwide, identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to start working on a vaccine. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by [[fomites]] with a [[basic reproduction number]] of four when the virus mutates, projecting that one in twelve of the world population will be infected, with a 25-30% mortality rate.  Conspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his popular [[blog]]. In one video, he shows himself sick and later claims he recovered using a [[homeopathic]] cure derived from [[forsythia]]. In a panic, people seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies.  Krumwiede's claims attract national attention. During a television interview, he reveals that Dr. Cheever had secretly advised his fiancé to leave Chicago just before the city was quarantined. Cheever is informed the government will investigate and may charge him for leaking information. Later, it is revealed Krumwiede had faked being infected in an attempt to increase profits for a hedge fund that paid him for advice on a cure, which he randomly stated was forsythia. Krumwiede is arrested for conspiracy, securities fraud and manslaughter, but is released when his many supporters successfully raise funds to provide for his bail.  Using an [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] virus, Dr. Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy testing process, she inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her father, a doctor suffering with MEV-1 after he refused to stop treating patients during the outbreak. Hextall does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success.  Even at full production rates, the vaccine supply can not match demand, so the CDC awards the vaccinations by lottery based on birth date; inoculations will take one full year to complete. First responders, doctors, and others designated by the government are vaccinated ahead of the lottery. Dr. Cheever gives his fast-tracked vaccination to the son of Roger, a CDC janitor who had overheard Dr. Cheever's phone call warning his girlfriend to leave Chicago. Meanwhile, Mitch and Jory reconcile with the hope of life going back to normal.  In the opening days, Dr. Leonora Orantes, a [[World Health Organization|WHO]] epidemiologist, traveled to Hong Kong to follow the Beth Emhoff lead. She collaborates with Sun Feng and other local [[epidemiologist]]s and public health officials; they identify Emhoff as [[index case|patient zero]], with security video showing her as the common contact with the next three known victims at a Macau casino. Before she can leave, Feng kidnaps Orantes to use her as leverage to obtain (anticipated) MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village. Orantes spends months living with the villagers until the vaccine is announced. Feng exchanges Orantes for enough vaccine for his village.  When her colleague reveals that similar kidnappings were widespread, and the doses were [[placebos]], Orantes rushes back to warn the villagers, exhibiting [[Stockholm Syndrome]].  By Day 26, the death toll had reached at least 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide. The discovery, production and initial deliveries of vaccine took until Day 133, with vaccinations to run until nearly Day 500. The final death toll is not mentioned.  Dr. Hextall places samples of MEV-1 in [[cryogenic]] storage, alongside samples of [[H1N1]] and [[SARS]].  The source of the virus is revealed to viewers. A bulldozer (coincidentally, operating for the company Emhoff worked for) clears some jungle and disturbs some bats, with one finding shelter and food in a banana tree. That bat then flies over a pig pen, dropping a chunk of banana from its mouth, which is then eaten by a piglet. A chef from the Macau casino chooses the piglet and returns to the casino. As he handles the carcass in the kitchen, getting abrasions on his hands, he only wipes his hands when called to meet a customer &ndash; Beth Emhoff. The chef shakes hands with Beth (Mitch views the handshake on her camera in a previous scene), giving her the mix of bat and pig viruses, making the chef [[index case|patient zero]] and Beth the second case.

When the police arrive, sheriff's deputies Adam Mitchell and Shane Fuller meet Hayes, discovering he is a new deputy, having recently moved to [[Albany, Georgia]].  The personal lives of these officers are observed: Mitchell adores his nine-year-old daughter, Emily, but is distant from his fifteen-year-old son, Dylan, because he doesn't share his son's interest in 5k runs. Hayes never knew his biological father, instead treating a neighbor as his father (even giving him [[Father's Day]] cards annually), but would risk his life to save his three children; however, his teenage daughter Jade (Taylor Hutcherson), resents him because he has a strict policy about [[dating]], and won't let her go out with her love interest Derrick. Fuller is divorced, as were his parents, and has joint custody of his son. David Thomson is young and single.   Javier Martinez (Robert Amaya) is an immigrant struggling to provide for his family after being laid off when a construction company went over budget. While job-hunting he walks down an alley asking God what He wants him to do.

After paying him for the job, Mitchell recommends him to a new full-time job, where he is hired.  One day, Emily is killed by a drunk driver, devastating Mitchell and his family. Following his daughter's death, Mitchell reads about fatherhood in the Bible. He decides he must be a better father and crafts a detailed "Resolution" to honor God in every aspect of his family.

As a result of the resolution, Mitchell and Fuller mend their relationships with their sons, Hayes with his daughter, and he also visits the grave of his biological father whom he had never met and forgives him. Thomson reveals that he fathered a child in college and deserted the mother after she refused to have an abortion. He writes the mother and seeks to mend their relationship and to see his child, after seeing that abandoning kids contributes to crime on the streets, and does not want that burden on her.   Martinez's manager offers him a promotion on the condition that he falsify inventory documents. After being given a day to think about it, Martinez refuses, maintaining that it would be wrong. Impressed, his boss promotes him and raises his pay, revealing that the condition had been a test of Javier's integrity, with Javier being the only individual to pass after many others had been tested.   Mitchell discovers that Fuller has been stealing drugs from police evidence to resell on the streets for money. Mitchell decides he must honor his Resolution and report the corruption. He sets up a sting leading to Fuller's arrest and imprisonment. Fuller explains his motives that he was doing it for his son, feeling that his yearly pay wasn't enough to provide for him. Mitchell visits Fuller in jail where Fuller admits to his mistakes and asks Mitchell to look after his son. During a minor traffic stop, Hayes and Thomson unknowingly confront the armed leader of a gang they have been repeatedly encountering. One of the gang members is Derrick, who stops the gang leader from shooting Hayes with a shotgun. After an intense firefight, Deputy Hayes asks Derrick what he's doing with the gang, and the later responds that he had no one else that cared about him.  At a Father's Day church service, the men present the Resolution and Mitchell urges the fathers in the congregation to be a godly influence on their families. Mitchell runs in a 5K race with both his and Fuller's sons, Hayes begins to teach and mentor Derrick in prison, and Thomson meets his daughter for the first time.

Cowboys & Aliens
 In 1873 [[New Mexico Territory]], an unnamed loner ([[Daniel Craig]]) awakens injured in the desert with no memory and a strange metal gauntlet. He wanders into the town of Absolution, where [[preacher]] Meacham treats his wound. [[Sheriff]] Taggart recognizes the stranger as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan and attempts to arrest him. Jake beats up the posse sent to take him in and nearly escapes, but a woman named Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) knocks him out. Taggart prepares to transport both Jake and volatile drunk Percy Dolarhyde to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] for trial.  Percy's father, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde ([[Harrison Ford]]), a ruthless [[Cowman (profession)|cattle baron]], demands Percy be released. He also demands Jake be released to him, since Jake had stolen gold from him. During the standoff, alien spacecraft begin attacking the town. Percy, the sheriff and other townsfolk are abducted by long, whip-like feelers hanging from the bottom of the ships. Jake's bracelet activates and becomes a weapon; he shoots down a ship, ending the attack.  Dolarhyde, Ella, and other townsfolk form a posse to track an injured alien that escaped from the downed ship. Meanwhile, Jake travels to an abandoned cabin and, in a flashback, recalls returning to it with stolen gold and then being abducted, along with a woman named Alice, by the aliens. His memories returning, Jake joins up with the posse. During the evening, the group comes upon a capsized [[Paddle wheel ship|paddle wheel]] [[steamboat]] that the aliens apparently dumped hundreds of miles from any rivers capable of holding it. They camp in it, and during the night the alien they were tracking kills Meacham, who sacrifices himself to save Emmett, Taggart's grandson.  By morning, most of the posse has deserted, and those remaining are attacked by Jake's former gang. Jake, who had stolen the gang's loot after their last heist, attempts to retake control but it is foiled. The aliens begin attacking them again and Ella is captured. Jake jumps aboard the ship and attacks the alien pilot, causing the ship to crash. The alien survives the crash, suddenly comes out of the water and attacks Ella, fatally wounding her. Jake then kills the alien with his wrist-blaster.  The remaining posse is captured by [[Chiricahua people|Chiricahua Apache]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], who blame them for the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and emerges from the fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had travelled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens, who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments to find humans' weaknesses, are far stronger and more durable than humans, and have superior weaponry, but are not invulnerable. They can be stabbed and shot to death, but only Jake's [[directed energy weapon|gauntlet weapon]] or a well-aimed shot with a rifle can kill them with a single blast. Ella tells them that the aliens which previously attacked them are just scouts.  She also claims Jake holds the secret to the aliens' whereabouts and argues that they must defeat the aliens before the invaders exterminate all life on earth. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches' [[medicine man]], Jake recalls that Alice was euthanized after she was used in an alien experiment, but he had escaped, inadvertently stealing the gauntlet-like alien weapon encasing his wrist. He then also remembers the location of the aliens' base of operations.  Armed with this knowledge, the group, now led by Dolarhyde, prepares to attack the aliens' grounded [[Mother ship#In science fiction and UFOs|mother ship]]. Meanwhile, Jake returns to his old gang and persuades them to join the fight. After the humans maneuver the aliens into a ground battle, Jake and Ella board the ship and free the captives, but Jake is captured. Dolarhyde rescues him, and both men escape from the ship after killing the alien responsible for Alice's death. As the remaining aliens are taking off in their damaged craft, Ella sacrifices herself by entering the ship's core and destroying it by using Jake's wrist gauntlet as a bomb, obliterating the ship.  With the aliens gone the abducted townsfolk begin to remember their pasts. Still a wanted man, Jake decides to leave, though the sheriff and Dolarhyde say they will claim he was killed in the invasion. The citizens intend to reconstruct their town.  
Crazy, Stupid, Love

After moving into his own apartment, son Robbie and daughter Molly staying at the house with Emily, Cal goes to a bar night after night, talking loudly about his divorce, until he attracts the attention of a young man named Jacob Palmer, a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] who beds different women each night, although a young woman named Hannah has recently rejected his advances. Jacob takes pity on Cal and offers to teach him how to pick up women. Using Jacob's teachings, Cal seduces Kate at the bar. After the encounter, Cal manages to successfully seduce other women at the bar. He sees Emily again at their 13-year-old son Robbie's parent-teacher conference. The interaction goes well until they discover that Robbie's teacher is Kate, who reveals to Emily that she and Cal have had sex together. Cal then confesses to having sex with nine women since their separation. Emily leaves in disgust and begins actively dating David. Meanwhile, Hannah, a recent law school graduate, is expecting her boyfriend Richard to propose marriage while they celebrate her passing the bar exam, but he does not, instead, offering her a position at his law firm. Offended and hurt, Hannah returns to the bar where she originally rejected Jacob's advances and kisses Jacob passionately. The two return to Jacob's home to have sex, but end up talking to each other all night and making a connection. Jacob starts a relationship with Hannah, and he becomes distant from Cal.  At the same time, Robbie makes numerous grand gestures to try to win the heart of his 17-year-old babysitter, Jessica Riley, who actually has a crush on Cal. On the advice of her classmate Madison, she takes nude photos with raunchy expressions of herself to send to Cal and tucks them away in an envelope inside her dresser drawer. Later, Emily calls Cal under the guise of needing help with the house's pilot light, but Cal sees through the ruse since he is secretly gardening at the old house in the night and sees that Emily did not really need any help. Realizing that she called just because she too was missing him, Cal decides to try and win her back. Meanwhile, Jacob returns Cal's calls and asks for advice about being in a real relationship and meeting his girlfriend's parents. Jessica's mother, Claire, friends with Emily, who dislikes Cal, discovers Jessica's naked photos in the dresser drawer and shows them to Jessica's father, Bernie. Bernie was Cal's best friend before Claire made him end their friendship in the aftermath of the breakup. Bernie rushes to the Weaver residence to confront him about the photos, with Jessica in pursuit. Cal and his kids create a makeshift mini golf set in their backyard to remind Emily of their first date. During the gathering, Jacob and Hannah show up at the house, and Hannah is revealed to be Cal and Emily's first daughter born to them right out of high school. Cal is appalled that Jacob is dating his daughter, and forbids her from seeing him. At that moment, Bernie shows up and attacks Cal. Jessica arrives and tells her father that Cal knew nothing of the pictures. Then David arrives on the scene to return Emily's sweater from a previous date. Jacob asks David if his name is Lindhagen and when David replies "yes," Jacob punches him in the face for the pain he caused Cal. Cal, Jacob, David, and Bernie then get into a scuffle which is soon broken up by the police. Cal starts spending time at the bar again and receives a visit from Jacob, who confesses that he is in love with Hannah. Cal replies that he is happy that Jacob is a changed man but does not approve of Jacob and Hannah's relationship, having seen Jacob's former lifestyle. Jacob resigns without harboring any ill feelings; rather, he expresses his respect for Cal and praises him for being a great father.  At Robbie's eighth grade graduation, Robbie is the [[salutatorian]] and gives a pessimistic speech about how he no longer believes in true love and [[soulmate]]s. Cal stops him and instead begins to recount his courtship with Emily to the audience, saying that, while he does not know if things will work out, he will never give up on Emily. With renewed faith, Robbie reaffirms his love for Jessica, to the audience's applause. After the ceremony, Cal gives Jacob and Hannah his blessing. Jessica gives Robbie an envelope containing the nude photos of herself that were originally intended for Cal to "get him through high school." Cal and Emily have a laugh talking about the events that have transpired the past year, hinting that they might get back together.  
Creature (2011 film)

While there, Oscar discovers a shrine to local legend, Lockjaw. The townies give the boys directions to a house built by "Grimley" himself, a local tourist attraction that they are hesitant to explore, only Oscar and Beth seem interested and convince the others to go with them. En route, Oscar tells them all the legend of Lockjaw:  A long time ago, Grimley Boutine and his sister Caroline were the last two remaining members of their clan. [[Incest]] was a part of their family and heritage, so it was no surprise that she was carrying his child and the two were madly in love and due to be married, but the day before their wedding, an [[albino]] [[alligator]] dragged Caroline off into the swamp. Grimley sought out the gator in the hopes that he would find her alive, but instead he came across her being devoured in a corpse-filled, half-flooded mine tunnel. Going insane with rage, Grimley killed the gator with his bare hands, before eating its flesh, then consuming the flesh of his sister, along with every other piece of flesh in the cave, slowly devolving, becoming half-man, half-alligator himself.  The others disbelieve the story, and they finally arrive at Grimley's house, unaware that they are being stalked by something in the swamp. They set up camp for the night near the Grimley house for an evening of drinking and having fun. Meanwhile, one of the shop patrons, Grover, is slaughtered by an unseen beast on the riverbank after ignoring warnings to not defy Grimley. Randy leaves the group to get more beer from the truck, returning just in time to interrupt Karen from taking advantage of a drunken Beth. Emily and Niles, having gone off on their own, admit their love and devotion to one another before making love, unaware that Oscar is secretly taking photos. Karen finds him, and masturbates him to [[ejaculation|climax]] as he continues to take photographs of the couple. When Oscar refuses to return the favor, however, she walks off and is knocked unconscious by Chopper, the owner of the store they'd come across. It is revealed that Oscar and Karen are both his children, and subservient to Lockjaw himself, he takes Karen away. Randy witnesses this and sees Lockjaw before running off into the woods. Oscar collapses on Emily and Niles, claiming that Randy had attacked him; Niles leaves Emily to treat Oscar's shock as he goes off in search of Randy. Randy and Niles both encounter Lockjaw and run, coming across a highway that they had supposedly gotten far off track from earlier; they return to look for Emily, only to be stopped by one of the shop workers who holds them at gunpoint. Niles is able to kill him, but Lockjaw gruesomely murders Randy.  Afterward, Beth awakens from her drunken unconsciousness, her tent having been moved into a deep dark cave. As she emerges from it she discovers Lockjaw eating one of his victims and lets out a horrified scream, being presumably killed by him. Karen, having been set up as a sacrifice to Lockjaw, has her feet cut off by her father to lure Lockjaw from the underground, saying that it must be done for the family. After he leaves, Lockjaw emerges from the cavern below the shack and seems to recognize her by the necklace Chopper put around her neck, the same one that belonged to his sister. Niles finds Karen dead when he comes across the cabin, and is attacked by Oscar but quickly dispatches him with a [[machete]]. Afterwards, he sneaks into Lockjaw's cave to save Emily, when they emerge they manage a brief escape before she is taken by Chopper and his followers, with Lockjaw throwing Niles into the river to drown or become food to the gators. Chopper says to Emily that Lockjaw has chosen her to become his next bride. Niles, who is alive, follows the party to a gathering ritual that will allow Grimley to impregnate Emily. During the ceremony, Niles attacks, and after receiving a brutal beating from the overpowering Lockjaw, he manages to knock him into a sinkhole to drown. He unties Emily but, as Niles is reviving her, Lockjaw attacks again, pulling Emily into the hole, with Niles following. Later, at dawn, Emily and Niles (who is holding the jaw of Lockjaw) emerge from the sink hole alive. They manage to make their way back to their truck and ride off into the rising sun.  Some time later, Chopper arrives at the refurbished Grimley cabin, which is hopping with family and friends in a huge celebration. It is revealed that Beth had survived her ordeals with Lockjaw and now has a baby, who Chopper seems sure is going to "grow up to be as strong as his daddy". It is shown that the baby's face is somewhat mutated and the screen goes dark.

Daddy J goes back upstairs to his office while Chicago continues to watch Chaka's performance. When he gets there, Pretty-Eyed Willy and his gang make a special and unwelcome appearance. Pretty-Eyed Willy tells Daddy J that he is prepared to take over his club. Daddy J orders Pretty-Eyed Willy to take his gang and leave, but they refuse. Pretty-Eyed Willy takes off his glove on his right hand and shows Daddy J his "death hand", chokes him to death and destroys his office.   Downstairs, Chicago meets up with Chaka and has a nice conversation with her. They go back upstairs and find Daddy J dead on the floor and Chicago tells Chaka to get help. The police arrive and one of the detectives (Cedric the Entertainer) says there's nothing that they can do. Chicago demands the police to find out what happened to his uncle, but it's no help. The next day, Chicago and Chaka go to Daddy J's funeral. Chaka asks Chicago if he will return to his hometown now that his uncle is dead, but Chicago tells her that he will not leave until he finds out who killed Daddy J.   Chaka goes up and sings a tribute song to Daddy J and suddenly Pretty-Eyed Willy shows up. He confesses in front of everyone that he killed Daddy J, which makes Chicago very angry and vows revenge against him. Pretty-Eyed Willy demands to know who Chicago is and someone yells out that Chicago is Daddy J's nephew. After hearing this, Pretty-Eyed Willy orders two of his men to kill Chicago. The two men chase Chicago to a park and beat him senseless. Suddenly, a man in a white suit and a white mask appears out of nowhere and beats up the two men, but Chicago is so weak from his wounds he passes out.   Chicago wakes up in the man's home and the man introduces himself as Julius Ho (Affion Crockett), a 75-year-old martial arts expert. Chicago tells Julius that he's trying to find Pretty-Eyed Willy, but Julius tells Chicago that Pretty Eyed Willy is not easy to defeat because he once trained him and Pretty-Eyed Willy used his moves for evil things, including trying to kill Julius. Due to the fact that Chicago can't fight, Julius tells him that he will teach him kung-fu.   Pretty Eyed Willy has now taken over the Tatou club and has called it Mascara Remixed. He fires Daddy J's employees, kidnaps Chaka and forces her to be one of his singers. Pretty-Eyed Willy's girlfriend, Vandetta, (Jennifer D. Johnson), warns Chaka that if she doesn't cooperate, she'll die just like Daddy J and the assumed dead Chicago.   Meanwhile, Julius starts training Chicago to learn kung-fu, but it turns out that Chicago is not kung-fu material. Chicago finds a radio and starts playing music. He starts dancing and Julius notices that Chicago's dancing moves seem similar to kung-fu moves. Julius sneaks up on Chicago with a long stick to test him out and Chicago blocks every move that Julius makes. Julius tells Chicago that he can only fight if there's music playing.   Chicago and Julius go to a mechanic shop and notices that one of Pretty-Eyed Willy's men is there. Julius sneaks in and begins fighting him. Chicago walks in and he somehow distracts Julius, which causes the man to pull out a knife and stab Julius in his back, killing him. The man grabs Chicago by the throat with his knife in the other hand and threatens to kill him. Suddenly, music starts playing and Chicago tests out his new fighting skills on the man, defeats him and runs towards Julius, who is lying on the ground. Julius tells Chicago that "the music is all around you" and dies.   The man that Chicago beat up before gets a call from Pretty-Eyed Willy's right hand man, Jamal (Ty Hodges), and the man tells him that Chicago is still alive and is on his way to kill Pretty-Eyed Willy. Jamal warns Pretty-Eyed Willy about Chicago. Pretty Eyed Willy gets angry and kills one of his men for lying to him. Chicago makes his way to his uncle's club, but on his way there, he runs into some more of Pretty-Eyed Willy's goons.   Chicago finally arrives at the club and runs into a fighting crack addict (Tommy Davidson) and kicks him off the balcony of a bar. He runs into two more guys and after defeating them, he is knocked out by the crack addict, who takes him to a basement and ties him to a pipe. The crack addict calls Jamal and tells him he has captured Chicago. Jamal arrives at the basement and tells the crack addict not to kill Chicago and save him for Pretty Eyed Willy. However, neither of them are aware that Chicago can hear music coming from the vent and he begins to untie himself. As the crack addict prepares to burn Chicago with an iron, Chicago becomes free and knocks the crack addict to the floor with the iron falling on him instead.   Chicago continues to search for Pretty Eyed Willy, but he is stopped by a group of fighting females and three other guys. While he's fighting, he's unaware that Pretty-Eyed Willy is watching. The DJ starts mixing up the music and Chicago has trouble fighting, which makes Pretty-Eyed Willy discover his secret.   After the fight, Chicago finally finds Pretty-Eyed Willy and notices that he has kidnapped Chaka. Pretty-Eyed Willy and Jamal take Chaka on the roof where Chicago follows them. Pretty-Eyed Willy pushes Chaka against a car, knocking her out. Chicago gets angry and prepares to fight him, but he realizes that there's no music playing. Pretty-Eyed Willy beats Chicago up and knocks him to the ground. He pulls off his glove and chokes Chicago with the "death hand", which is the same way he killed Daddy J. Pretty-Eyed Willy announces that he will take over the whole city, however, he gets disappointed in Jamal for letting Chicago in the club and knocks him out.   Wounded on the ground, Chicago starts having flashbacks and remembers what Julius Ho said before he died. Suddenly, Chicago starts hearing sounds from bottles, water drops, trash cans and other items and notices that all of them make a beat and he stands to his feet. Pretty-Eyed Willy turns around and is shocked to see that Chicago is still alive. Chicago starts dancing and beats up Pretty-Eyed Willy, but Pretty Eyed Willy continues to remain unharmed. Pretty-Eyed Willy shows Chicago his "death hand" and somehow Chicago takes full control of the "death hand" and forces it to choke and kill Pretty-Eyed Willy.   Chicago revives and rescues Chaka and the two of them head back to the club. Chicago becomes the new owner of the Tatou club and he and Chaka become a couple. He picks up a photo of his uncle and says that Pretty-Eyed Willy is gone and tosses Pretty-Eyed Willy's eye patch in a trash can.   Pretty-Eyed Willy's body is shown at a morgue and somehow his "death hand" comes alive on its own and injects him with a syringe, bringing him back to life. The movie ends with Pretty-Eyed Willy laughing as the "death hand" jumps in front of the camera and he says "Why am I naked?".

The Darkest Hour (film)
 Americans Ben and Sean ([[Max Minghella]] and [[Emile Hirsch]]) travel to Moscow to sell their social networking/party locating software. As they approach the airport, their plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. After arriving, they find their Swedish business partner, Skyler ([[Joel Kinnaman]]), has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie ([[Olivia Thirlby]]), an American, and her Australian friend Anne ([[Rachael Taylor]]). The lights go out in the club and everyone heads outside. There, they witness what appears to be an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]. Balls of light fall from the sky and then fade away. When a policeman investigates he is disintegrated, killing him instantly. The invisible entities begin hunting and killing people, sending them into a panic.  Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne, and now Skyler hide in the club's storeroom for seven days. With most of their food gone, the group plans to go to the American Embassy. They find the city full of scorched cars and cinders, but empty of people, except for a wary old woman who warns them of "the ghosts". Ben and Sean search for supplies in a police car near [[Red Square]] while the others hide in the nearby [[GUM (department store)|GUM department store shopping mall]]. While they are searching the car, a barking dog discovers and confronts an alien, but is killed. Ben and Sean successfully hide under the car as the alien moves closer, causing the car's lights and siren to turn on. The alien moves on and the men run to the mall. Sean realizes that light bulbs and other technologies give the aliens away. The group takes shelter in one of the mall stores. Sean and Natalie go to look for clothes and almost run into an alien who can't see them through a glass wall. Sean theorises that the aliens can only see their electrical charge, but not through glass or other insulators.  The group finds the American Embassy gutted and lifeless. All except Skyler go to the roof to get an aerial view. They find a logbook telling them that the invasion is worldwide. They also find a radio broadcasting a message in Russian, and hear gunfire. Ben and Sean go outside to help Skyler, but he is killed. The others see a light in a nearby apartment tower and go to investigate, bringing the radio they found. They find a young woman named Vika and a man named Sergei, an [[electrical engineer]]. Sergei has made his apartment into a giant [[Faraday cage]] that hides everyone from the aliens. He has also developed a microwave gun that weakens an alien's force field, so that it can actually be seen and killed. Vika and Sergei translate the message, which says that a [[nuclear submarine]] [[K-152 Nerpa]] is waiting in the [[Moscow River]] to take survivors to safety.  As Sergei shows the men the microwave device, Vika, Natalie, and Anne go to other apartments to gather supplies for the submarine journey. An alien senses them outside the Faraday cage and gives chase; Anne hesitates following Vika and goes another way, causing Natalie to follow her back inside. When they get to the apartment, Natalie is unable to close the door and the alien gets inside. Sergei shoots the alien with his gun and finds that it is only stunned. The alien kills Sergei while the others get out by the fire escape. Anne hesitates again and is killed while trying to escape. Natalie sets the apartment on fire as they climb down and meet up with Vika.  They meet up with a Russian police team with improvised armor led by Boris who manage to wound an alien with [[conventional weapons]]. Sean collects a piece of the alien's body. The small police band were also able to build another Faraday cage at the [[Russian State Library]]. Boris and his men eventually agree to help the remaining four to get to the submarine. The policemen believe that the aliens are strip mining for conductive metals since giant light columns can be seen drilling all over Moscow. As they move through the subway, an alien discovers them and they escape on the tracks. Vika hides behind a pillar, unable to join the others without being seen. Ben helps her climb down to the tracks, but is killed by the alien.  The survivors make it to a powerless patrol boat on the river and drift downstream to the waiting submarine. The boat nears the submarine but runs aground. As they attempt to push free, a new light beam destroys a large apartment building right next to the river, causing the boat to capsize. Sean and the policemen swims towards the submarine but upon reaching it discover Natalie is missing. They see a flare fired from Natalie's [[flare gun]] in a railway and bus yard near the river. Sean is determined to get her, possibly missing his chance to escape. The policemen agree to help him rescue her. The Russian submarine crew, after expressing doubt about the rescue, assist by building another microwave gun with stronger batteries.  After the team manages to destroy an alien, Sean finds Natalie on a bus while the policemen and Vika destroy three more aliens using the microwave guns and water. As Sean is about to get off the bus with Natalie, an alien climbs on board, locks the door, and sends the bus speeding around the bus yard. It grabs onto Natalie's leg, but Sean blasts the alien's shield with the microwave gun. He then discovers the alien's weakness when he throws a piece of the wounded alien he had collected earlier, and it destroys the unshielded alien. The two stop the bus and narrowly avoid a collision.  After returning to the submarine, the police team decides to stay and fight for the city, and Boris tells them that now the war has begun. Sean, Natalie, and Vika plan to spread what they learned about the aliens - the microwave guns and their vulnerability to pieces of other dead aliens - to the rest of the world. Sean and Natalie, the only survivors of the original group along with Vika, nearly share a kiss on the submarine. In a pre-credit scene, as the submarine cruises through the [[Caspian Sea]], they learn that survivors in [[Paris]] managed to destroy an alien mining tower.  
A Dangerous Method
 In August 1904, [[Sabina Spielrein]] arrives at the [[Burghölzli]], the pre-eminent psychiatric hospital in [[Zurich]], suffering from [[hysteria]] and begins a new course of treatment with the young Swiss doctor, [[Carl Jung]]. He uses [[word association]] and [[dream interpretation]] as part of his approach to psychoanalysis, and finds that Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child when her father spanked her naked.  Jung and chief of medicine [[Eugen Bleuler]] recognize Spielrein's intelligence and energy, and allow her to assist them in their experiments. She measures the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide [[empirical data]] as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. The doctors correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and Freud himself soon adopts Jung as his heir and agent.  Jung finds in Spielrein a kindred spirit, and their attraction deepens due to [[transference]]. Jung resists the idea of cheating on his wife, [[Emma Jung|Emma]], and breaking the [[taboo]] of sex with a patient, but his resolve is weakened by the wild and unrepentant confidences of his new patient [[Otto Gross]], a brilliant, philandering, unstable psychoanalyst. Gross decries monogamy in general and suggests that resistance to transference is symptomatic of the repression of normal, healthy sexual impulses, exhorting Jung to indulge himself with abandon.  Jung finally begins an affair with Spielrein, including rudimentary [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] and spanking. Things become even more tangled as he becomes her advisor to her dissertation; he publishes not only his studies of her as a patient but eventually her treatise as well. Spielrein wants to conceive a child with Jung, but he refuses. After his attempt to confine their relationship again to doctor and patient, she appeals to Freud for his professional help, and forces Jung to tell Freud the truth about their relationship, reminding him that she could have publicly damaged him but did not want to.  Jung and Freud journey to America. However, cracks appear in their friendship as they begin to disagree more frequently on matters of psychoanalysis. Jung and Spielrein meet to work on her dissertation in Switzerland, and begin their sexual relationship once more. However, after Jung refuses to leave his wife for her, Spielrein decides to go to Vienna. She meets Freud, and says that although she sides with him, she believes he and Jung need to reconcile for psychoanalysis to continue to develop.  Following Freud's collapse at an academic conference, he and Jung continue correspondence via letters. They decide to end their relationship after increasing hostilities and accusations regarding the differences in their conceptualisation of psychoanalysis. Spielrein marries a Russian doctor and, while pregnant, visits Jung and his wife. They discuss psychoanalysis and Jung's new mistress. Jung confides that his love for Spielrein made him a better person.  The film's footnote reveals the eventual fates of the four analysts. Gross starved to death in Berlin in 1919. Freud died of cancer in London in 1939 after being driven out of Vienna by the [[Nazi]]s. Spielrein trained a number of analysts in the [[Soviet Union]], before she, along with her two daughters, were shot by the Nazis in 1942. Jung emerged from a [[nervous breakdown]] to become the world's leading psychologist before dying in 1961.  
Dark Horse (2011 film)
 Abe (Jordan Gelber),  a man in his thirties who lives at home with his parents, meets suicidal Miranda (Selma Blair) who recently moved back home after a failed literary/academic career and a divorce. While waiting outside Miranda's house for their first date Marie (his secretary) runs up and tells him to give up the girl, he has no shot but then he wakes with a start revealing it was a dream.  At several points in the film Marie (his secretary who says she had twin children who would have been Abe's age but died) turns up in unexpected places and talks with him, often to discourage him from pursuing a relationship with Miranda or to take him away. The places include the car park outside the bar where he has just hit Mahmoud, his bedroom when he looks up hepatitis and on a street corner after an argument he has with his mother and brother in his car.  While Miranda has forgotten about their date Abe gives a speech about how he is a [[dark horse]] and proposes marriage. She refuses but a few days later, out of desperation and after having talked to her ex, Mahmoud, she changes her mind, saying that she does want to marry Abe. During the course of events, Miranda says she has [[hepatitis B]], and may have already put Abe at risk for catching it (since he used her toothbrush). He meets Miranda and Mahmoud (who is on friendly terms with her) at a bar and soon suspects that Mahmoud is the one who gave Miranda hepatitis. He beats up Mahmoud, breaking his jaw. Abe thinks he has driven away Miranda by this but she calls him and continues the relationship. Abe is fired by his father and is to be replaced by his cousin Justin. His mother tells him she knew about it and that they had long ago decided Abe was a failure.  He runs through the rain to the same toy store where, at the start of the film, he had previously tried to return a damaged toy but had been told that he couldn't because the toy is open and the manager is out to lunch. This time Abe tells the clerk he is looking for his fiancee who is in the store somewhere. He pulls out his waterlogged receipt to prove that he has purchased a fiancee there and he just wants to pick her up but he gets the same response from the clerk. The store manager turns up and turns out to be Mahmoud with a severe jaw injury and neck brace. Mahmoud gives a speech about how "he knows Abe is a loser" and "Miranda never really cared and would have been better off with his brother". The speech develops into a metaphor about life and how everyone has a receipt that is abruptly cut off mid-sentence.  The scene cuts to a shot of Abe in hospital surrounded by his family. He wakes up and they report that he has been in a coma for two months after being hit by a car in the office parking lot. Miranda is there and tells him that she didn't know him and was never attracted to him but then adds that she cares. She doesn't specify about what she cares and refuses to answer his questions about what. She leaves, saying that she is not pregnant despite Abe's mother's belief, and Abe flatlines. He recovers only to develop hepatitis and [[jaundice]]. He talks with Marie, forcefully kisses her (thereby contaminating her) and flatlines again.  Looking well he walks into his parents' house where he has lived his whole life. It is empty of people. He tears off a small section of wallpaper to reveal his childhood height recorded on the wall by his father with the label ''Abe, Dad's "Dark Horse"''.  At the uncovering of his headstone his family is gathered with Marie and a young workmate, who may be her [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|boy-toy]], as well as Miranda who is holding a young baby and who has Richard's arm around her. Richard points out the inscribed death date is wrong but his father says not to tell Richard's mother.  Marie slowdances with Abe by candlelight to a saxophone version of "[[When I Fall in Love]]" and the scene abruptly cuts to a shot of Marie sitting at work with a faraway, daydream look on her face casting into doubt the source of the story.

But Morten refuses and takes his daughter home where he cares for her twenty four hours a day. Similar attacks begin to happen in the area and new victims are found by the police who have no leads in these bizarre cases, except the fact that most of the victims have been drilled in the head and end as walking dead, vomiting black bile.  Johanna’s father takes it on himself to find out the truth. He embarks on a dark thrill ride of lost memories, conspiracy and zombie-like symptoms. Finding the mysterious darkness within is the source of the bizarre world he has uncovered.

Dead Space: Aftermath
  When contact with the USG ''Ishimura'' and the Aegis VII colony is lost, the Concordance Extraction Corporation sends the ship USG ''O'Bannon'' to investigate, but contact is lost with them as well. The [[Space marine|Marine]] battleship ''Abraxis'' is sent next. Despite the carnage of ''Dead Space'', four survivors are found: Nicholas Kuttner, a security officer; Alejandro Borgas, an engineer; Nolan Stross, [[chief science officer]]; and Isabella Cho, [[Chief Medical Officer|chief medical officer]]. The survivors are imprisoned in a holding cell while the ship is en route to the Sprawl, a station built on a shard of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The head interrogator is told by the Overseer he has seven hours to get information from the survivors.  Kuttner is interrogated first and gives his account of the events: he, Cho, Borgas, and Stross are assigned by the O'Bannon's commanding officer to stabilize the gravity on Aegis VII. Assisting are soldiers Rin and Sergenko, along with two additional engineers, Borgas' cousins Noah and Omar, a Unitologist. Campbell secretly tasks Kuttner's crew to bring back pieces of the Marker, which are worth millions of credits per kilo. The group land on Aegis VII, which is now unstable. While the engineers work the gravity stabilizer, Kuttner's crew separate. Kuttner finds a Marker shard, which causes a horrifying hallucination, making him murderously unstable. He damages the stabilizer before his teammates can tie him up in the shuttle. After finishing his interrogation Kuttner is able to escape and follows a phantom of Vivian out of an airlock, killing several marines.  Borgas is next to be interrogated and gives his account: the attempted gravity stabilization fails and the group is forced to make a hasty escape. Rin, Sergenko and Omar were killed but the rest managed to make it aboard the shuttle and escape the planet just in time. Borgas is forced to crash land the shuttle onto the ''O'Bannon''. Aegis VII explodes seconds before the ship can jump out of the system. The debris causes severe damage to the ShockPoint Drive. Borgas, enraged by his cousin's death, demands to know the importance of the shard. When the captain explains the shard's monetary value, Borgas assaults him. After Cho calms him down, he follows the captain's order to fix the drive. The interrogators determine Borgas did not come in contact with the shard and due to him knowing too much he is executed by the Marines. Stross is brought in next.  Stross' duties as chief science officer are putting a strain on his relationship with his wife Alexis and infant son, causing Alexis to suspect Nolan and Isabel are having an affair; this is true. After escaping Aegis VII, Stross begins to closely study the shard that Kuttner had collected. He unfortunately falls victim to the shard, causing him to obsess over it; to this end, he learns it can create Necromorphs, believing to have been designed by a higher power. Unfortunately, when he proves this, it causes an outbreak. Stross attempts to return to his quarters to protect his family but hallucinates that they are necromorphs and brutally murders them. The interrogators determine Stross to be of value and keep him for further study.  Finally, Cho is interrogated and reveals the finale of the events: just after the outbreak she and several other doctors arrived at the morgue. They find the bodies gone and several doctors killed. One of the bodies turns into a Necromorph, causing the group to flee. She releases Kuttner, who kills the Necromorph. They eventually meet up with Captain Campbell, who is fighting the Necromorphs with the security team including First Officer Leslie Pallas. As the group flees into the vents Leslie is caught by a Necromorph and killed. They make it to Stross' lab, where they meet with Borgas, and two officers from the bridge, Lieutenant Marcus and Lana. Stross explains that destroying the shard could stop the Necromorphs. Borgas says that throwing it into the portal drive could not only destroy it, but restart the drive. With weapons made by Borgas, they head to engineering. Lana is surprised to see that her roommate Jenny is still alive, however when she gets close enough against Isabel's warnings she sees she is a Necromorph. The Necromorph spits acid into Lana's face melting all the skin off her face. Lana begins screaming having survived the attack when she and the Necromorph are killed in a grenade blast. Debris from the planet causes a hull breach, damaging the outer door control for engineering. Lieutenant Marcus is almost saved by Kuttner but a Necromorph grabs him causing him to lose his grip and be blown out into space. Captain Campbell sacrifices himself to seal the door manually. The four survivors battle the Necromorphs to get to the portal drive. When Stross refuses to throw the shard into the drive, Cho does it. The drive's energy destroys the shard. The feedback from the destroyed shard causes all the Necromorphs to liquefy.  After giving her account, Cho is informed that the ''Abraxis'' has reached the Sprawl. Cho surmises that her superiors are aware of the effects of the Marker and are using those exposed as human guinea pigs. The Overseer accompanies Cho to the Sprawl and has the interrogator and his assistant killed. The Overseer offers Cho a position as head of the project, but Cho refuses after seeing what her superiors have done. She is lobotomised.  The Overseer and his assistant watch a news report where Cho is accused of being a terrorist responsible for the ''Ishimura'', Aegis VII colony, and ''O'Bannon'' disasters. They then discuss studying Stross, highlighting their luck in finding two people who have come into contact with the Marker. They proceed to store him in the lab where, in the slot next to him, is the other person - the crazed engineer that they found floating in a shuttle weeks ago who was responsible for destroying Aegis VII. The name of the engineer, Isaac Clarke, is then seen on a [[Holographic display|holographic monitor]], marking the beginning of ''[[Dead Space 2]]''.  
The Day (2011 film)
  The Day follows a group of five survivors in a post-apocalyptic world as they travel through a bleak environment in an attempt to find food, shelter, and a safe place to stop running from tribes of savage cannibals that roam the country-side. They hope to plant two jars of seeds that they either stole or found during their journey. There was at some point twelve in their group, but it is not known how the others died or how long the remaining five have been on the run.  One of the survivors, Adam ([[Shawn Ashmore]]), who we see in flashbacks, left his wife and daughter alone in the car outside while he searched for supplies inside an empty house located in a ravaged suburban community. His wife and daughter were attacked and either captured or killed. The rest of the group are Rick ([[Dominic Monaghan]]), Shannon ([[Shannyn Sossamon]]), Henson ([[Cory Hardrict]]) and Mary ([[Ashley Bell (actress)|Ashley Bell]]).   Seeking refuge in the countryside, the five decide to go to a nearby farmhouse for shelter, debating whether to stay until one of their group, Henson, has recovered from whatever has made him sick; or to rest there briefly and then move on to avoid attracting cannibals. The group separate: the men explore the house, while the two women head outside after their leader, Rick, asks them to try to trap some game. Instead, Mary goes to a nearby stream to clean up. While cleaning her dress, Mary hears someone moving toward her and realizes at the last minute that it's a scout for one of the tribes that live in the area. He chases her across the stream but she is able to reach her gun and shoot him.  Meanwhile, back in the farmhouse, Adam and Rick explore the basement and discover boxes full of tinned food. They yell out for Henson to come and look at what they've found but discover that the tins contained rocks, and inadvertently activate a trap that sets off an alarm, shuts the three men in the basement and kills Rick. Several cannibals show up and attempt to get to the men in the basement but are all killed by Shannon and Mary, who, hearing the alarm, rush back to the house where they find and confront the attackers. One of them recognizes a mark on Mary's thigh and identifies her as a cannibal from a rival tribe, then attempts to escape but is killed by Mary.  The women rescue the men from the basement and afterward, Shannon knocks Mary unconscious, having heard the cannibal question Mary about being one of them. The three decide to restrain her in a chair and question her aggressively about her past in order to learn who and what she really is. When she doesn’t speak, Adam, furious over Rick’s death, begins to torture her, while Shannon looks on, urging him to just kill her instead. After Adam cuts off the skin on Mary's thigh with her tribe mark and attempts to force feed it to her, Henson intervenes and stops Adam from going any further. Mary eventually gives in and tells Adam she was not responsible for killing Adam's wife and daughter. She explains that she massacred her own tribe while they were sleeping because they killed her younger sister who injured/broke her leg and would have died from infection in a week, so was immediately strung up and killed to be eaten. She insists that she was only trying to survive. She also reminds them that the tribe that set the trap is coming for them. After listening to the story, the three burn Rick's dead body while they debate whether to free her or kill her.  Meanwhile, the tribe of cannibals and its leader ([[Michael Eklund]]) swear to take back their house and supplies. The four barricade the entire house as they prepare themselves for the oncoming battle. Under cover of night, the tribe invades the house where the four are. As waves of attackers attempt to get inside, the group initially use weapons to stab or cut them, but eventually fire at them through the windows. Several men break through a barricade and drag Shannon outside, but she is saved by Henson, who is killed instead.  When Shannon unintentionally kills his young son, the leader of the attacking tribe is enraged and leaves his young daughter to avenge her brother’s death. In the morning, the remaining cannibals attack the house once again, igniting it with Molotov cocktails. Mary insists Shannon and Adam leave through the back and leave her to confront the remaining enemy clan members in front of the house, which they agree upon. After they leave, Mary realizes Shannon has taken the shells from her shotgun.  Mary is overpowered by the leader, only to be saved when Adam comes back to help her fight off the last few cannibals. During the fight, he sustains a series of wounds which lead to his death. Out in the woods, Shannon is attacked, and her throat is slashed by the leader’s daughter, who leaves her to die. At the farmhouse, Mary cremates Adam's remains, then starts to walk away only to encounter the leader’s daughter who pretends to be an innocent girl. As they both start walking, the girl reaches for a jagged blade to kill her but Mary is quicker and decapitates her, then continues walking away from the burning farmhouse.

The Debt (2010 film)
  The year is 1997 and Rachel Singer ([[Helen Mirren]]) is honoured by her daughter Sarah ([[Romi Aboulafia]]) during a release party in [[Tel Aviv]] for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David ([[Ciarán Hinds]]) is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan ([[Tom Wilkinson]]) waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck.  The film then flashbacks and it is 1965. A young [[Mossad]] agent Rachel Singer ([[Jessica Chastain]]) on her first field assignment arrives in [[East Berlin]] to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz ([[Sam Worthington]]) and Stefan Gold ([[Marton Csokas]]). Their mission is to capture [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[war crime|war criminal]] Dieter Vogel ([[Jesper Christensen]])—infamously known as "The Surgeon of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Birkenau]]" for his [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiment]]s on [[Jews]] during [[World War II]]—and bring him to [[Israel]] to face justice.  Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from [[Argentina]] and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's [[obstetrics and gynaecology]] clinic.  At her final doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as [[paramedic]]s and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at [Berlin Wollankstraße station]. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting [East German guards] to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents are left with no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.  The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel while leaving him chained to the wall heater. During his shift, David becomes violently enraged after Vogel explains his beliefs that Jews have many weaknesses, such as selfishness, making them easily subdued. David smashes a glass plate over Vogel's head and repeatedly beats him, only to be stopped and restrained by Stefan. Later on, Stefan and David go out, leaving Rachel home to monitor Vogel by herself. After managing to cut through his bonds using a shard of the broken plate, Vogel ambushes Rachel with the shard, leaving her with a permanent scar on her face and escapes.   Panicking and hoping to save face for both himself and for Israel, Stefan convinces Rachel and David to go along with the fiction that Vogel was killed. They agree to lie and use the cover story that Rachel shot and killed Vogel as he attempted to flee.  In the following years, the agents become venerated as national heroes for their roles in the mission.   At a dinner after their daughter's book release party, Stefan takes Rachel aside to set a meeting to discuss new information he has obtained. Later, at David's flat, Stefan provides evidence that Vogel now resides at an insane asylum in [[Ukraine]], and is soon scheduled to be interviewed by a local journalist.  David had been investigating the man at Stefan's request and, according to Stefan, killed himself out of fear that the lie would be exposed. Rachel refutes Stefan's explanation, recalling an encounter with David a day before his suicide, in which he revealed his shame about the lie and disclosed that he had spent years unsuccessfully searching the world for Vogel. He was further disheartened by Rachel’s admission that she would continue propagating the lie to protect those closest to her, particularly her daughter.  Nevertheless, at the direction of the modern day Mossad, Rachel finally feels compelled to travel to [[Kiev]] to correct the mistake made by the trio. She investigates the journalist's lead and is able to identify and travel to the asylum. She reaches the room just minutes before the journalist and discovers the man claiming to be Vogel is an ill old man not Vogel . Describing the encounter to Stefan over the phone, Rachel declares she will not continue to lie about the 1965 mission. She leaves a note for the journalist and prepares to leave, but suddenly spots the real Vogel (in his 80s by now) among the other patients and follows him to an isolated area of the hospital.  After a confrontation in which Vogel stabs her twice with scissors, Rachel kills Vogel by plunging a poisoned [[syringe]] into his back. Later Rachel's note is discovered and read by the journalist. It describes the truth of the mission, ready to be relayed to the world.

Death of a Superhero
 In the first scene, 15-year-old Don (Sangster) attempts suicide by the train tracks or gives the viewer the impression he intends to commit suicide. However, he lets the train rush past him and simply watches.  The next scene shows him getting therapy in a brightly coloured room. Don appears to have tuned out the therapist and simply jots down a drawing in his notebook. He then tears the page from his book and walks out the room leaving a puzzled therapist who eyes his drawing which features the therapist going 'bla bla bla bla bla'.  Don asks his brother about his relationship with someone who his brother thinks fondly of. His brother seems happy with her.  Don is a talented teenager who draws a lot of comic stories and since being told he had terminal cancer has lived in a world occupied by his superhero. Don frequently suffers from hallucinations and during a scan, sees a twisted woman (a cartoon and figment of his imagination) laughing hideously at him.  In the reception room, a boy named Billy won't stop staring at Don. Don is drawing a picture and then rips it out of his book and hands it to Billy, getting up and leaving. It is a picture of a boy standing in a hole in a cemetery. Behind him there is a grave with the name 'Billy' written on it.  In an effort to stop his suicide attempts, his parents send him to therapy. Eventually, he is sent to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Adrian King (Andy Serkis), one whom he initially does not like; but whom he forms a bond with quickly.  Don walks home from school alone and balances on the wall of a bridge as cars rush past below him. He cautiously walks across, unaware that he has been spotted by the therapist.  Don visually shows the therapist his opinion on his methods when he graffiti's a Skull 'n' Crossbones on his boat. However, later Don comes and cleans it off for him and his therapist offers love advice for his crush Shelly.  Shelly reads out an essay from her book. Don looks at it and realises she hasn't done her homework and is left amazed. The teacher is on the phone and hasn't been listening to her. On the way out of the classroom, Don tells her: 'nice essay' and she smiles knowing he knows too.  Don turns up at a party where he and his friends perfect a recipe for a drink made from alcoholic wines and beers. Grinning, Don takes a sip. On the way home he spots the woman again and it shows him spraying the air with something. In the morning there is graffitied woman on the school window which people crowd around taking pictures of.

During an English lesson Don and Shelly pass notes between each other and end up deciding to attend a party on the weekend. Don asks his therapist for 'love advice' and attends the party with Shelly. Before the party they both talk on top of a building admiring the view. Shelly tells Don she likes his drawings. Flattered, Don tells her she is the smartest girl in the class and really beautiful. Shelly doesn't think that is a 'talent' and would do anything for a talent like Don's. The party goes well until they discover a video of Shelly exposing her breasts and lying on the floor and beginning to strip off her clothes. Some one tells Don his girlfriend is 'dirty' and 'crazy' - intended as a joke. Embarrassed, Don claims she is not his girlfriend and they hardly know each other. Then he spots Shelly, who has heard what he said. She drives off on her motorbike without him.

His father decides to spend some time with his son smoking and the two get very emotional. When Don's mother finds out she tells the father to drive him to hospital.  Don has a conversation with a younger patient who has cancer too. She claims she wants to be a 'dancer' when she is older. Billy says he'll be a prince and Don reveals he wants to be a superhero.  Don's brother confesses to Don's friend that he doesn't want Don to die a virgin. They go around the school asking girls if they'll have sex with Don. All of the say that it sounds gross. Eventually they find some girls who are attractive and willing. Don is embarrassed when they show him pictures of the girls and ask for him to make a pick. Realising they've asked the majority of the girls in the school, Don hesitates. However, with the help of his therapist, they get one to agree.  Don is completely nervous during his conversation with them and they stumble across the subject of 'true love'. She then asks for Don to show her some of his pictures. She is impressed and tells him she would do anything for a talent like his. He is reminded of Shelly. In a hallucination he sees the medic woman who tried kill him with a kiss. He leaves her apartment and goes to Shelly and apologizes.  The two walk along a beach, hand in hand. Don makes her promise that if she's upset at all then she should go there and think of him. She promises. The scene fades and it shows Don on his bed dying in peace.  His therapist gets on his sailboat which he has painted and drawn a similar Skull 'n' Crossbones on to what Don drew.

Tashi's ditzy fiancée, Sonia ([[Shenaz Treasurywala]]), is an [[air hostess]] who agrees to deliver a package for Vladimir Dragunsky ([[Kim Bodnia]]) to Somayajulu ([[Vijay Raaz]]), without realizing its contents or that Somayajulu is a [[gangster]]. Sonia asks Tashi to deliver the package. Tashi, in turn, asks Nitin to do so. But Nitin is unable to do so as he is suffering '[[Traveler's diarrhea|Delhi Belly]]'. Nitin hands Sonia's package to Arup for delivery to Somayajulu, along with a package containing his [[stool sample]] for delivery to Nitin's doctor. Arup mixes up the two bags. Somayajulu, furious, tortures Vladimir to find his package.  Meanwhile, Nitin photographs his landlord with a [[prostitute]]. He sends an envelope with the photographs to his landlord to blackmail him. Tashi is with Sonia, when his colleague Menaka ([[Poorna Jagannathan]]) calls him on the pretext of work. When he reaches the place he realizes that it is just a party and Menaka called him just to have fun. Menaka's ex-husband Rajeev sees them together and punches Tashi in the eye in a fit of jealousy. Tashi retaliates and knocks Rajeev out. As Tashi and Menaka leave they are chased by a furious Rajeev and his friends who shoot at them. The duo barely manage to escape.  Vladimir informs Somayajulu that the mix-up must have been caused by Sonia as she didn't know what she was carrying in the package. Somayajulu calls Sonia, informs her about the mix-up and asks her to give him the address of the person who had delivered the package. When Tashi arrives into his apartment, he walks into Somayajulu who has Arup standing on a stool with a noose around his neck. On hard interrogation, Somayajulu discovers the mix-up and realizes that the package must be with Nitin's doctor.  Nitin gets the package from his doctor's office, wherein Somayajulu finds his thirty diamonds hidden inside. Upon recovering his booty, he orders his henchmen to kill the three roommates. One of them is about to shoot Tashi, when another kicks the stool on which Arup was standing to hang him. Luckily for the roommates, the ceiling of the apartment collapses, since it can't take Arup's weight. The cave-in knocks out Somayajulu and his men, leaving one with broken arms. Tashi, Arup and Nitin escape with the diamonds and spend the night at Menaka's place. The next day they sell the diamonds to a local jeweller.  As the roommates prepare to get out of town with the money, they get a call from Somayajulu who has kidnapped Sonia. He threatens to kill her if they don't return the diamonds. The trio try to buy back the diamonds from the jeweller, who demands double the sale amount.  Without the money, Tashi comes up with a plan. Nitin, Arup, Tashi and Menaka disguise themselves in [[burqa]]s and rob the jeweller, leaving him the bag of money. They flee in Tashi's car with the police on their tail and go to the hotel where Somayajulu is holding Sonia. As they are about to make the exchange with Somayajulu, the police arrive at the hotel room. There is a shoot-out between the police and Somayajulu's gang.  Nitin, Arup, Tashi and Sonia, who had hit the floor during the gunfight, are left as the only survivors. Menaka, who by now realises that she likes Tashi, is upset to learn about his engagement and walks away from him. Tashi breaks off his engagement to Sonia. Later, it is revealed that Nitin did not return the cash to the jewellery store owner, and had kept most of the money for himself (whereupon he abandons blackmailing the landlord). The film ends when Menaka comes to the roommates' apartment to return Tashi's car's hubcap lost while escaping from Rajeev. Tashi jumps into her car through the open window and kisses her passionately.  Producer-actor [[Aamir Khan]] is seen dancing in a song and dance performance as the credits start rolling.

For Freddie, that tumultuous mix of fear and excitement that was once in his life seems to be no longer present.  The majority of the film takes place during one day in Hester's flat, a day on which she has decided to commit suicide. Her suicide attempt fails and as she recovers, the story of her affair and her married life is played out in a mosaic of short and sporadic [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s. We soon discover the constraints of Hester's comfortable marriage, which is affectionate but without sexual passion.  As Hester's affair is discovered she leaves her life of comparative luxury and moves into a small dingy London flat with Freddie. Hester's new lover has awakened her sexuality, but the reckless, thrill-seeking Freddie can never give her the love and stability that her husband gave her. Yet to return to a life without passion would be unbearable.

The Descendants
 Matthew "Matt" King is a [[Honolulu]]-based attorney and the sole trustee of a family [[trust law|trust]] of 25,000 pristine acres on [[Kauai]]. The land has great monetary value, but is also a family legacy. While Matt has always ably managed his own finances, most of his cousins have squandered their inheritances. With the trust expiring in seven years due to the [[rule against perpetuities]], the King clan is pressuring Matt to sell the land for hundreds of millions of dollars. Amidst these discussions, a boating accident has rendered Matt's wife, Elizabeth, comatose. With Elizabeth hospitalized, Matt is forced to cope with his two troubled daughters, 10-year-old Scottie who seeks attention by bullying other children, and 17-year-old Alex who has a history of substance abuse and is away at a private boarding school on the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]]. Doctors determine that Elizabeth's coma is irreversible and her [[Advance health care directive|living will]] directs all life support to be discontinued. When Matt tells Alex, she reveals that she caught Elizabeth having an affair before the accident, causing a major rift between mother and daughter.  Two close family friends tell Matt that Elizabeth was unhappy and wanted to leave him for her lover, Brian Speer, a real estate agent. After Matt arranges for friends to bid Elizabeth goodbye, he decides Speer should also have an opportunity. He and the girls, and also Alex's slacker boyfriend Sid, travel to Kauai to find Brian. While there, Matt's cousin, Hugh mentions that Brian is brother-in-law to Don Hollitzer, the developer to whom the family wants to sell the land. Brian stands to make a small fortune from the sales commission. Matt confronts Brian and informs him Elizabeth is dying and offers him an opportunity to see her one last time. Brian declines, admitting that although Elizabeth was in love with him, it was only a fling to him; he loves his wife, Julie and their children, then apologizes to Matt for the pain he caused.  When Elizabeth is disconnected from life support, her father, Scott admonishes Matt for not being a more generous and loving husband. Choosing not to disclose the details of her affair to Scott, Matt agrees, but Sid and Alex both unexpectedly defend Matt. At the King family meeting, Matt overrules the majority of his cousins who favor selling to Hollitzer. Matt decides to keep the land and look for a different solution to the problem posed by the rule against perpetuities. Shocked, Hugh tells Matt that he and the other cousins will take legal action if Matt refuses to sell, but Matt is undeterred.  After learning of Brian's affair with Elizabeth and realizing that he will not visit, Julie comes to the hospital. She tearfully admits to Elizabeth that she wants to hate her for "trying to destroy" her family, but that she forgives her. Matt finally comes to terms with his wife's betrayal and her impending death. He kisses her goodbye, followed by Alex and Scottie, and later, they scatter Elizabeth's ashes in the ocean off [[Waikiki]]. Later, the three are at home sitting together sharing ice cream and watching television, all wrapped in the Hawaiian quilt Elizabeth had been lying in.

However, as Samantha is making a suicide diary in the college's dressing room, she is stabbed to death by a masked killer. After Ashleigh leaves her house, Kenny breaks in with his friend, Davey (Andrew Ellis), to set up cameras around her house, so the group's suicide can be recorded, and Davey can exclusively release the footage. Meanwhile, Archie and Jasmine start a romance, which leads to Archie suggesting he and Jasmine remove themselves from the suicide pact, but this repels Jasmine.  The following day, the group is shocked by the death of Samantha. At college, Jasmine is attacked by the killer, but manages to phone the police and lock herself in a room. Archie finds Jasmine, and as she is taken to the hospital, he is questioned by Bates and Mason ([[Reggie Yates]]) who seem to think Jasmine is suffering from a condition which made her imagine the attack.

Moments later, Jasmine emerges from the house distraught, while Bates enters the house and finds Archie dead.

Delicacy (film)
 Nathalie, a young attractive woman is in love with a young attractive man, François. He proposes and they marry (portrayed in something resembling a ‘dream’ sequence), honeymoon, and are immediately pressured by family to have children. Nathalie takes a new job, hired partially because her new boss is sexually interested in her. One day, François goes out to jog and is killed in a traffic accident. Nathalie is devastated.  After wallowing in pity from the tragedy for several days, she collects most of François' stuff (reminders of him) in their apartment and tosses it into the garbage. Her friends and family are very concerned about her. She eventually returns to work, exciting her (married) boss as to her new ‘availability’. Time passes. On the job for three years and focusing solely on her work, she has gone without any other romantic relationship. One evening her boss takes her to dinner to celebrate getting a big contract and he hits on her. She is not attracted to him, and tells him so, but that they can still respect each other and work together.  One day at work, Markus, a subordinate on her work-team (unseen until now) enters her office to discuss a case, and she, in a trance-like state, just walks up to him and passionately kisses him. He is pleasantly stunned, and later leaves work confident and happy, passing several beautiful women in the street as they (in his mind) ‘ogle’ him. That night, he thinks about what happened and tries to imagine what Nathalie is doing.  His confusion about this incident is because he is a native Swede (who has worked in France the past 15 years, with his parents living nearby), balding, an average looking guy, maybe 40 years old, and cannot possibly imagine why someone like Nathalie would be interested in someone like him.  The next day at work he asks Nathalie why she kissed him, and she seems to not remember. She tells him she must have been ‘elsewhere’ and to forget it. He tells her he cannot. She says her behavior was inappropriate and that she was daydreaming, and he leaves her office. She tells her friend about the exchange. The first thing her friend asks her is “Is he hot?”  The next day at 5 pm at work Markus goes to see Nathalie and kisses her; she is surprised, but then enjoys kissing him, as they embrace. He leaves, and she goes to find him. They talk and agree to go to dinner. They seem to connect well. Markus still cannot believe this is happening.  They go to a play together a few nights later.  As he walks her home, he realizes he is falling in love, and tells her that, and that it’s "ridiculous" and he doesn't want to get hurt, then runs away, leaving Nathalie puzzled.  The next day at work Markus purposely ignores her, to her annoyance. Nathalie lets slip to her assistant that they went to see that play, and office gossip about them being a ‘couple’ soon spreads. Nathalie goes to find Markus and tells him she enjoyed being together, but he still ignores her. Later that day, at an office birthday party for the assistant, Nathalie confronts Markus about his attitude in front of everyone, leading to further gossip. They reconcile, and he gives her a particularly sentimental gift. Later, Nathalie goes home to her father and cries.  Nathalie and Markus go on another date, where a guy openly hits on Nathalie, not believing she would be with a guy like Markus, and Markus and he fight. The next day at work, her boss asks about her new relationship, hinting at his disapproval, and infuriating her. The boss then calls Markus into his office to talk to him; they later have dinner, so the boss can figure out what Nathalie sees in Markus, discovering he is just a nice guy and a ‘poetic’ thinker. Markus puts the drunken boss into a cab, then goes to meet up with Nathalie at her friend's home, where there is a small party occurring. Nathalie is happy to see him and to introduce him to her 'crowd', but they, all ‘attractive people’, cannot see what she sees in him, either. Markus is very uncomfortable at this, and Nathalie senses that, so they leave and go home to her place, where they just fall asleep in separate chairs, holding hands.  At breakfast they talk about the "relationship" they are not having, which everyone else thinks they are in, and her annoying boss.  At work she confronts her boss about his meeting with Markus. Her boss calls Markus an “ugly, insignificant guy”, and she tells him off. After further insulting words are put forth, including a comment about her ‘unfaithfulness’ to her deceased husband, Nathalie walks out, ignoring a major project meeting. She drives to the countryside where she grew up and where François was from too, even though they did not know each other then. Nathalie phones and then picks up Markus in a small town, and takes him to the cemetery where François is buried, but it is locked. Then, in the pouring rain, she takes him to her grandmother's home, where they are both warmly welcomed, and her grandmother is impressed by Markus, as she tells Nathalie, “He is a good man.”  That night, after a simple soup dinner, they consummate their relationship. The next morning in the garden, as Markus plays hide-and-seek with Nathalie, he imagines her in various phases of her life in that garden, and hides amongst the many ‘hers’. Nathalie, counting, looks contented, enigmatically and wryly smiling into the camera.  
Demoted
 Rodney (Michael Vartan) and Mike (Sean Astin) are two of the top salesmen at Treadline Tire Company. Despite their mean treatment of both the secretaries, led by Jane (Celia Weston), and annoying co-worker Kenny Castro (David Cross), the two are well liked by their boss Bob Ferrell (Robert Klein) and after a great win in softball (which concludes with Mike giving Castro a wedgie), the duo spend a wild night at a strip club with their boss.  The next day, Rodney and Mike come into work to learn that Mr. Ferrell has died of a heart attack. Due to his seniority in the company, Castro takes his place. Rather than fire them, which would result in the two of them getting generous severance packages, Castro decides to "demote" the two to secretaries. Rodney is assigned to the sadistic Earl Frank (Ron White) while Mike is paired with new executive Elizabeth Holland ([[Constance Zimmer]]), whom Castro has a very one-sided crush on. At home, Rodney ends up lying to his beautiful fiancee Jennifer ([[Sara Foster]]) and her demanding father JR (Patrick St. Esprit) that he has received a promotion at work.  Desperate to reclaim their old jobs, Rodney and Mike decide to befriend the other secretaries, who happen to hate the obnoxious Castro as much as they do. While the group seeks revenge on Castro, eventually trapping him in a bathroom flooding with toilet water, the duo also help their new co-workers with their personal lives. For example, they help the overweight Betty (Cleo King) lose weight, confront another office worker who had a one-night stand with Tina (Jill Bartlett) and help the new girl Olivia (Cathy Shim) figure out the perfect anniversary gift for her husband (which they claim is a blow job). They also help the ladies' softball team win the Secretaries' League title. While Rodney (with the help of Jane) tries to keep the unsuspecting Jennifer under the impression he's been promoted, the womanizing Mike starts falling for Elizabeth, who eventually takes him out bowling.  All the while, Castro acts excessively mean to Rodney, Mike and the secretaries, moves that eventually cause him to blow a deal with Reilly Auto Parts, a national chain that would make Treadline one of the top tire brands in the country. The final straw comes when Castro destroys the secretaries' break room. Led by Mike and Rodney, the secretaries storm outside and protest, eventually forming a union. Unfortunately for Rodney, his secret is revealed when Jennifer and JR catch him participating in the protest on the local news. Rodney's lies lead to Jennifer calling off their engagement.  The next day, a defeated Rodney goes to Castro begging for his old job back, but Castro reveals that there was never a chance of that. Rather, desperate to make up the loss of the Reilly deal to corporate, Castro reveals that he will lay off the newly unionized secretaries at the end of the month. Along with Mike and Jane (who always wanted to be a salesperson), Rodney meets up with the Reilly executives himself, and the trio successfully close the deal just as a furious Castro bursts into the room. He challenges them to a fight and is quickly knocked out by Mike.  Finally receiving his old job back thanks to the Reilly deal, Rodney goes to apologize to Jennifer. He ends up stripping naked in front of her entire street proclaiming his love for her, fulfilling a promise he made earlier in the film. As Jennifer begs him to stop, it's revealed that all the secretaries have talked to her, telling her all the good he's done. Jennifer tells the now naked Rodney how proud she is of him, and the two reconcile.  In the end, Rodney marries Jennifer, Mike begins officially dating Elizabeth, Jane has become a sales rep for Treadline and the secretaries now have a new and much improved break room. In addition, Rodney and Mike are now running the company (which leads to Rodney finally winning JR's approval). When asked what happened to Castro, the duo reveal that instead of firing him, they gave him a job in the advertising department. The film ends with Castro dressed up in an embarrassing tire costume, dancing for traffic.

The Details (film)
 Jeff Lang ([[Tobey Maguire]]) and wife Nealy ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) are a young Seattle couple with a two-year-old son. Jeff is an OBGYN and Nealy owns a small shop. Considering a second child, they decide to enlarge their small home and also lay expensive new grass in their backyard. But there are worms in the grass and so raccoons regularly destroy it. Jeff goes to great lengths to get rid of the raccoons, including mixing poison with a can of tuna. Soon after, their neighbor Lila ([[Laura Linney]]), an older, lonely, cat woman, visits Jeff and reports that her cat Matthew, is missing.   Jeff not yet realizing the connection, hopes Matthew will turn up safe.   Jeff and Nealy have a huge argument over his growing raccoon obsession. Shortly after, Jeff meets up with his best childhood friend (and also his medical school buddy), Becca ([[Kerry Washington]]), who is married to Peter ([[Ray Liotta]]) for her advice. Meeting at a local bar, they have a few drinks, and decide to walk to Becca and Peter's near-by house. Becca shows Jeff the collectible car that is her husband's pride and joy. While sitting in the car, things begin to heat up, and they have sex in the garage. Not long after, neighbor Lila desperately needs to talk with Jeff, so she chases him to his office, where Peter is waiting for Jeff in the waiting room. Peter confronts Jeff about his affair with Becca, which Lila possibly overhears. Lila quickly leaves without talking to Jeff.    After work, Jeff goes to Lila's home to see why she'd followed him to work and what she'd overheard, if anything. Lila shows Jeff her proof that he'd poisoned Matthew, but admits she knows it was probably an accident. Becoming distraught, she tells Jeff that she knows he's a philanderer. She then blackmails Jeff into having sex with her right then and there, and gets so into it that she physically prevents Jeff from disengaging before the act is completed. As an OBGYN, Jeff knows the chances of Lila becoming pregnant are very slim.   Jeff comes home where Nealy tells him that Peter stopped by earlier. Jeff meets up with Peter at Peter's restaurant to see why he'd come by the house, and Peter gives Jeff the choice of calling Nealy right then to admit the affair, or pay him $100K hush money. Peter gives Jeff a little time for a decision.   Jeff meets Peter at a high bridge over a river, where Jeff gives him only $75K as he and Nealy are cash-poor at the time and he'd taken out a HELOC to get his hands on the 75K. After tossing the money off the bridge, Peter chastises Jeff for the decisions that he has made, and shares some tough life lessons of his own where he'd chosen to take the difficult path because it was the right ting to do. Peter also says that if Jeff keeps making the same decisions he made before, then his life will be completely ruined. This prompts Jeff to start making more moral decisions in his life.  Jeff's basketball pal and friend, Lincoln ([[Dennis Haysbert]]) had once been a basketball phenomena in his youth until a car accident ruined his chances of a basketball scholarship to college. Jeff finds out that Lincoln, now working a series of blue collar jobs, has renal failure from the long-ago car accident and is slowly dying. Jeff learns he is a perfect match, and offers Lincoln a kidney. Following the surgery, a groggy Jeff is recuperating in his hospital bed, where he receives a surprise visit from Lila, who giddily tells him that she's pregnant with his child. Dazed, Jeff doesn't immediately react, but meets with Lila later in a coffee shop, where he tells her that he will not be a father to the baby. Lila says she just wants Jeff to be around for the baby's sake. Jeff is not convinced about what she's saying, and he looks as if he is going to lose his mind.  Jeff reveals all of this to Lincoln, and also tells him about a strange dream he had that included Lila getting killed by an arrow. Jeff has no idea what the dream means. Lincoln, feeling beholden to Jeff for not only saving his life, but also helping him get a dream job as a basketball coach, decides on his own that Lila has to go. He does so by buying an archery set and hunting down Lila in a park.   Nealy calls Jeff and says that she had heard about Lila's death and the police are interviewing everyone on their block. A stunned Jeff starts to feel guilty. Lincoln's church honors Jeff's kidney donation to him with a special ceremony, and Jeff shares a silent exchange with Lincoln, knowing that it was he who killed Lila. On the way home after the service, his guilt gets the better of him, and Jeff tells Nealy everything, but not before he intentionally kills a symbolic raccoon crossing the road. In obvious shock, a hysterical Nealy laughingly tells Jeff of her own marital infidelity, which doesn't surprise Jeff too much as he feels that he deserves whatever Nealy throws back his way. Both of them decide to put everything behind them and move forward with a fresh start.  Some time later, the grass is replaced with flowers, the raccoon problem is thus fixed, and Nealy is pregnant. Jeff laments that perhaps things turned out for the better, but that he'd always be wondering and paranoid about getting caught.

The Devil's Double
 In 1987, [[Latif Yahia]] ([[Dominic Cooper]]), an Iraqi soldier fighting in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], is called to become a "''fedai''" ("[[body double]]" or [[political decoy]]) for [[Uday Hussein]] (also played by Cooper), the playboy son of Iraqi president [[Saddam Hussein]] ([[Philip Quast]]). Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened. Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's [[Ferrari Mondial#3.2 Mondial|Ferrari]] and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and given a whipping by Uday. After an appearance at a conference with several [[Kuwait]]i leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a [[Kurdish people|Kurd]]. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been [[directional drilling|slant drilling]] into Iraq's [[Rumaila oil field]]. The [[Gulf War|First Gulf War]] is launched with Uday proclaiming "The Age of the [[Sheikh]]s is over!"  Uday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14-year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party. At the party, based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s wife [[Suzanne Mubarak|Suzanne]], Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard [[Kamel Hana Gegeo]] ([[Mehmet Ferda]]). Uday believes Gegeo facilitated an affair between Saddam and [[Samira Shahbandar]], which devastated his mother, [[Sajida Talfah]], and he also expresses jealousy at the trust his father places in Kamel Hana. When Gegeo passes sarcastic comments about Uday's sexual advances towards his young victim, Uday butchers him with an [[electric knife|electric carving knife]] in front of all of the guests. The next morning, Uday's bodyguards are seen dumping the partially naked, beaten body of the young girl.  Latif, acting as Uday, is later sent to [[Basra]] to rally support among [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] soldiers as [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]] forces have taken control of the war. During the speech, Uday calls his brother from his mother's bedroom, playfully challenging him to tell the difference between Latif and Uday; his brother succintly replies that he can tell: "He's sober and he's not foaming at the mouth." At Basra, another attempt is made on Latif's life. To Uday's great concern, Latif nearly loses a little finger in the assault, which presumably would mean Uday would have to have his amputated to maintain their resemblance, but doctors are able to save Latif's finger. Later, Latif is confronted by the father of the young girl Uday killed. Uday eavesdrops on the conversation and is outraged by the man's pleas for "justice" and "compassion." Uday orders Latif to kill the man, but Latif refuses and instead slits his own wrists, to Uday's amusement. After Latif recovers, he confronts Uday at his birthday party. The confrontation escalates to a shootout and Latif escapes in Uday's [[Mercedes-Benz W126|Mercedes]] with Uday's lover, Sarrab ([[Ludivine Sagnier]]). The two escape to [[Valletta]], but Sarrab, fearing for her daughter in Iraq, calls Uday begging for the chance to return without being harmed. A would-be assassin sent by Uday just misses shooting Latif almost as soon as they arrive on the island. Uday calls Latif and offers him one final chance to return to Iraq, threatening to kill his father if he refuses. Latif's father encourages him not to return and he is killed.  However, Latif does return to Iraq, not to continue to serve as Uday's double, but rather to kill him, with the help of a man whose bride killed herself after being raped and beaten by Uday on her wedding day. In an adapted version of the attempt on Uday's life made by the [[Islamic Movement of the 15th of Shaaban|15th Shaaban]] in 1996, Latif and his partner ambush Uday while he is attempting to lure young girls into his [[Porsche 911|Porsche]]. They wound him severely, including mangling his genitals with a direct shot. One of Uday's bodyguards catches up to Latif as he flees the scene. However the guard, Ali, is one who Latif could have killed as he fled from Uday's birthday party before leaving the country but spared, and the guard extends him the same courtesy.  The movie ends by stating that Latif has been a very difficult man to find after these events. (Though apparently once spotted in Ireland with wife and two children.) Uday was permanently handicapped by the attack but survived until his killing by the U.S. forces in 2003.

During the party, his older brother [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Rodrick Heffley|Rodrick]] embarrasses Greg by suggesting that he ask Holly to skate with him and then interfering with Couples Skate by persuading a [[crowd]] of [[hooligans|violent teenagers]] to enter the rink, along with replacing "[[Always (Atlantic Starr song)|Always]]" by [[Atlantic Starr]] with a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] song. This prompts Greg's parents, [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Frank Heffley|Frank]] and [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Susan Heffley|Susan]] (who misunderstand this) to speak to Greg on the rink's [[public address system]] and then carry him off the rink. Greg, extremely angry with Rodrick for humiliating him, tries to tackle him, but he misses and in turn, lands in [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Taylor Pringle|Taylor Pringle]]'s [[birthday cake]].

On the morning of the first day of school, as Greg and Rodrick are about to leave, Susan makes an effort to have them bond by doing some things together by using her methods called "Mom Bucks", but it makes things worse as Rodrick cheats her system. At school, Greg's new teacher treats him like a bad kid and immediately dislikes him due to his relation to Rodrick much to his dismay. After school, a community [[talent show]] is advertised on TV; in which Rowley sees it as an opportunity to perform magic, and Rodrick sees it as a big break for his band, Löded Diper. However, Greg rejects the idea of doing the magic.  At church, Greg and Rodrick are grounded after a fight, causing Susan to get upset about what others think of her, and her family's reputation being ruined; after which, they are forbidden to go to a water park called, "Rocking Rapids", the following weekend, nor inviting people over, and told that they must bond. However, Rodrick defies his parents' orders, and throws a party. Though, the party causes Rodrick to be more friendly and open towards Greg.  The next morning, Susan calls and says that they will be home in one hour. Rodrick and Greg hastily erase almost all the evidence, but find out that the bathroom door is [[vandalized]] with graffiti; therefore, they replace it, but Greg finds out that the replacement door doesn't have a lock like the last one. Rodrick convinces Greg to deny everything as their parents and younger brother,  [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Manny Heffley|Manny]] arrive. Susan however, later slowly began to discover the difference and questions Greg and Rodrick. Though Rodrick denies this, Greg nearly reveals the truth and convinces Susan to not to punish Rodrick. Convinced that Greg didn't reveal about the party, Rodrick starts bonding with him as a gesture of gratitude.  One night, after coming home from a night out, they are finally exposed when Frank comes across photos of the party and the Heffley's reputation is ruined again, and no one will support Susan's articles about siblings bonding anymore. As Susan and Frank decide on the boy's punishments, Greg tries to apologize to Rodrick, but Rodrick gets mad at him for getting them in trouble. As punishments, Greg and Rodrick both get grounded, which includes Rodrick not being allowed to participate in the talent show. Completely devasted and heartbroken, Rodrick vows to get even with Greg.   The final part of their punishment is they have to stay at [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Grandpa Heffley|their grandfather's]] [[retirement home]], in which Greg finds out that Holly is visiting her grandmother. Holly tells Greg that she can relate to Greg about siblings giving her a hard time; however, siblings will eventually get over it. Holly also reveals she is more patient and mature than her two sisters.  The next day, to humiliate Greg, Rodrick reads and steals Greg's diary — in which Greg has written about his crush on Holly — and attempts to hand it over to Holly. Greg, with only his [[Undergarment|underwear]] on, chases after Rodrick and takes the diary back, but he accidentally hides in the women's restroom and a group of angry women in the restroom think he is a "peeping tom" and they attempt to catch him, but fail. When Greg returns, Rodrick reveals to him that he taped the whole incident on a VHS tape from the security cameras in the retirement home.  At the talent show a few nights later, Rodrick finds out that he has been booted from the band by [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Bill Walter|Bill Walter]], a band member who recently joined; Rowley isn't able to perform his magic tricks due to his assistant,  [[List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters#Scotty Douglas|Scotty Douglas]], having [[stage fright]]. Greg, with a change of heart, helps Rowley and Rodrick out by participating in Rowley's magic act in return for allowing Rodrick to perform his band act. In the middle of the performance in the talent show, Rodrick banishes Bill from the band for what he did. Before dropping Greg off at school the next morning, Rodrick gives him the tape from the retirement home in return for making it possible for him to participate in the show, symbolizing that they are not only brothers, but also friends.  In a [[mid-credits scene]], Greg and Rowley have just finished posting the video that Frank shot of Rodrick's music act with Susan dancing on [[YouTube]], and it goes viral, making Greg and Rowley an internet sensation. However, an enraged Rodrick, having seen the video, shouts at Greg off-screen, "Greg you are so dead."

The Devil's Rock
  On 5 June 1944, commandos are sent to the Channel Islands on sabotage and distraction raids, to draw Hitler's attention away from Normandy. That night, two New Zealand soldiers, Captain Ben Grogan ([[Craig Hall (actor)|Craig Hall]]) and Sergeant Joe Tane ([[Karlos Drinkwater]]), paddle in their [[Klepper canoe]] to Forau Island, landing on a beach covered in anti-personnel mines and tank traps. When they leave the beach and head inland, they begin to hear distant screaming and gunfire. They approach a German fortification and hear what they think is a man being tortured. They climb down into a large gun pit and place explosives on a large artillery gun but are disturbed when a German soldier ([[Luke Hawker]]) runs out of a tunnel pleading for help. Grogan stabs the soldier in the back of the neck and kills him. They hear a woman screaming, and Grogan decides to investigate while Tane remains outside. However, when Tane hears a gunshot he also enters the bunker to investigate. While looking for Grogan, he discovers a book of black magic and, distracted by its contents, is killed by an unseen assailant. Grogan, unharmed, later discovers Tane's body but is immediately knocked unconscious by the Nazi.  Grogan wakes and is briefly tortured by a Nazi, Colonel Meyer ([[Matthew Sunderland]]), who wants to know his mission. During the interrogation, Grogan hears a woman screaming from another room.  He eventually escapes and chases Meyer into the tunnels, shooting and injuring him. When he follows the sound of the woman's screams up to a room covered in occult symbols, he discovers that the woman is his dead wife, Helena ([[Gina Varela]]). Meyer enters the room and shoots Grogan in the leg, then shoots Helena in the head, apparently killing her. Grogan attacks Meyer, who explains the woman is a demon, summoned up from a book of black magic found on the island. Meyer proves this by offering her the leg of a dead German to eat; she changes into her true demon form as she eats the leg.  After Grogan removes a bullet from his abdomen, Meyer passes out. Grogan searches him and discovers a page torn from the book of black magic in a small pouch worn as a necklace by the Nazi. Grogan keeps the page after replacing it with another from the book. Soon after, Meyer recovers and explains the demon is a shapeshifter and a weapon the Germans plan to use against the Allies. He also explains that it is confined to the island because it cannot cross moving water.  However, Meyer now realizes the demon poses too great a threat to the world. Meyer offers to give the book to Grogan if he will help him escape from Germany. Meyer then persuades Grogan to help him perform a ritual to dispel the demon back to Hell. Meyer, believing he is protected with the incantation sheet from the book, betrays Grogan at the end of the ritual.  As Meyer reveals his true intent to use the demon for the Nazis, Grogan overpowers Meyer and throws him to the demon. She brutally kills Meyer while Grogan survives, protected by the incantation he has taken from Meyer. When she tries to convince him to take her with him as Helena, he tells her that she could never replace the real Helena he knew, taking the opportunity to chain her up again.  Unable to complete the ritual alone, Grogan takes the book and leaves the demon behind, to prey on any Germans that come to investigate; he explains to the demon that he intends to come back when the war is over to finish the ritual and to banish her forever. He leaves the key to the chain within reach as he leaves the demon in the bunker.  He steps onto the beach, buries the photo of his wife Helena he kept with him, then looks up and sees planes flying overhead and an armada heading towards France.  D-Day has begun.  One Nazi does fall prey to the demon, who masquerades as a German-speaking woman, Nicole, during a [[Post-credits scene|coda]] in the closing credits.

The Divide (2011 film)
 As [[Nuclear explosion|nuclear explosions]] ravage [[New York City]], residents of an apartment block rush downstairs to escape from the building, only to be forced into the basement by further explosions. Only eight of the residents – Eva ([[Lauren German]]) and her boyfriend Sam ([[Iván González (actor)|Iván González]]), Josh ([[Milo Ventimiglia]]) and his brother Adrien ([[Ashton Holmes]]), Josh's friend Bobby ([[Michael Eklund]]), Marilyn ([[Rosanna Arquette]]) and her daughter Wendi ([[Abbey Thickson]]), and Devlin ([[Courtney B. Vance]]) – manage to force their way into the building's [[bomb shelter]] before the superintendent, Mickey ([[Michael Biehn]]), seals the door. The group acclimatises to the cramped surroundings while Mickey asserts his dominance over the shelter and its denizens, much to the chagrin of Josh, Bobby, and Devlin. After some time, the shelter's door is broken open and the shelter is invaded by armed soldiers in [[NBC suit|biohazard suits]]; the men's speech is unintelligible and their allegiance remains ambiguous. The men attack the group and seize Wendi, leaving the shelter with her. Devlin and Mickey manage to kill three of the men and Mickey takes a rifle. Josh volunteers to use one of the dead soldier's suits to leave the shelter and search for Wendi.  Outside of the shelter, Josh finds the area entirely sealed off by plastic sheet tunnels connected to a laboratory. Josh's outfit allows him to explore the lab, where he discovers several unconscious children, including Wendi, in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] units; their hair shaved off and their eyes bandaged. One of the soldiers checks the ID on Josh's suit and, realising he is an imposter, tears out his breathing apparatus, exposing Josh to the air. Josh flees back to the shelter, killing two of the soldiers on the way. After Josh returns, the soldiers weld the door shut from the outside, trapping everyone within. Time passes; Josh begins to suffer the [[Nuclear fallout|effects of the radiation]] and admits to Adrien that he only went outside to find rescue for Adrien and himself. Eva, in a fractured relationship with the meek Sam, grows closer to Adrien. Bobby volunteers to hack up the bodies of the dead soldiers so their decaying remains can be thrown into the toilet's [[septic tank]]. Devlin grows suspicious that Mickey is hoarding resources. Marilyn, having been told by Josh that Wendi is dead, enters into a sexual relationship with Bobby.  Marilyn attempts to convince Eva to sleep with Josh, warning her that the men will want sex. The group grows increasingly angry with Mickey as resources grow scarce, culminating when Devlin discovers Mickey's locked safe room and threatens to [[taser]] him if he does not open it. A struggle ensues and Mickey shoots Devlin in the head with the rifle. The group do not believe Mickey's argument of self-defence, and an increasingly ill Josh, and an increasingly deranged Bobby, torture him to gain the code to the safe room. Eva throws the rifle down the toilet to stop Josh using it. Seizing authority, Josh and Bobby are physically and emotionally abusive of Marilyn. Josh makes it clear that he wants Eva, and Sam is unable to stand up for her. Eva and Sam try to protect Marilyn from Josh and Bobby, but are unable to. While Eva is tasked with watching Mickey, Mickey reveals that there is a gun hidden in his safe room.  Josh and Bobby force Eva to hack up Devlin's corpse when Sam cannot, leaving Eva distraught. Josh and Bobby, both losing their hair to radiation sickness, shave their heads. Mickey informs Eva that there is another way out of the shelter, through the septic tank to the sewer. Eva tries to retrieve the gun, but cannot get past the pair. She finds Marilyn's corpse, the two having beaten her to death. Eva notices her hair is falling out and realizes she is also sick; the shelter is not protecting them from the outside because of the broken door. Eva sends Sam to retrieve the gun while she cuts the power to distract Bobby and lures Josh away with the promise of sex. Josh grows suspicious and rapes Eva, but she fights him off with help from Adrien. Sam retrieves the gun, but as Bobby, Josh, Eva, and Adrien yell instructions at him, Sam shoots and kills Adrien. Josh brutally beats Sam. Bobby turns on Josh and is about to shoot him when Eva cuts his throat with a tin can lid. Eva frees Mickey, who shoots Josh. On his last action, Josh smashes an [[oil lamp]], setting himself alight and causing a fire in the shelter. While Sam and Mickey attempt to put out the blaze, Eva chooses to escape. Eva recovers the biohazard suit and locks herself into the safe room, leaving Mickey and Sam trapped inside the burning shelter.  Breaking through the toilet into the septic tank below, Eva drops into the tank and finds a ladder to the street. She emerges into the remains of the city and stares blankly at the total devastation.

She fails to impress a casting director, and he insults her for being unattractive and unable to act. Determined to secure a role, she spontaneously auditions for the position of a background dancer. However, she dances in a sultry manner, using erotic movements which annoys the film's director, Abraham ([[Emraan Hashmi]]). He edits out Reshma's entire dance sequence. The film fails at the box office, much to the dismay of the producer Selva Ganesh (Rajesh Sharma), who later recalls Reshma's performance and offers her a role in a song in his upcoming film. Selva also suggests that she now be referred to as "Silk", which is more exotic and captivating.  At the first shoot, Silk dances with veteran actor Suryakanth ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), her childhood idol. Enamoured with him, Silk gains his affection and attention by offering a long-term sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Abraham proposes a new film to Selva Ganesh and is keen to cast Suryakanth. However, Suryakanth's suggestion of adding sex and eroticism, to make the film more commercially viable, angers Abraham. Silk slowly builds a name for herself in the industry and goes on to do many more sexually charged films with Suryakanth, which catapults her into stardom. She gains many male fans and, in a short time, becomes immensely rich and popular as a Southern sex symbol.  Suryakanth's younger brother Ramakanth ([[Tusshar Kapoor]]) is an admirer of Silk and starts to befriend her. Silk develops a liking for him, after she realizes that he is the first man who loves her for more than just her body and sex appeal. At an awards ceremony Silk is praised for her performance but is insulted by Suryakanth who tells her that she is nothing more than everyone's "dirty secret". Hurt by his remarks, Silk announces that she will continue to make her "dirty pictures" and that she has no qualms in doing so. She begins to spend more time with Ramakanth and becomes the focus of tabloid gossip after noted journalist Naila ([[Anju Mahendru]]) criticises Silk for having a romantic relationship with both brothers. To avoid scandal, and also to get revenge, Suryakanth drops Silk from his forthcoming films, forcing her to work with smaller, unknown filmmakers. She loses interest in her work and begins to feel threatened by a younger aspiring actress, Shakeela. During a dance challenge she intentionally trips Shakeela, much to the embarrassment of Ramakanth who then decides to end their relationship.  To ease her heartbreak and the rejection from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, causing her to lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which turns out to be a huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape.  Abraham finds himself falling in love with Silk, even though he denies it first, as he struggles with this moral dilemma. During a phone conversation with Silk, Abraham becomes alarmed when she asks him to bid farewell to everyone for her. He rushes to her house, and finds her lying in bed dead from a sleeping pill overdose, along with a suicide note written by her.  The film ends with Abraham's narration, examining the life that Silk has led, and he questions whether the consequences she faced from her actions were justified or not. He concludes by realizing that we will never know if her way of life was right or wrong, or if we should judge her at all.

Don 2
 The film opens five years after the events of [[Don (2006 Hindi film)|Don]], with Don ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) narrating the story. The European drug cartel bosses meet in the [[French Riviera]] to discuss a new threat emerging from [[Asia]]: Don is jeopardising their business by undercutting their prices, and the bosses decree that Don must die. Living in [[Thailand]] for the last five years, he goes to a remote settlement to pick up a shipment of [[cocaine]]. Instead of the expected uneventful transaction, Don fights his way out. He returns to [[Malaysia]], surrendering to Roma ([[Priyanka Chopra]]), who has joined Interpol, and Inspector Malik ([[Om Puri]]). Don is sentenced to death and sent to prison, where he meets old rival Vardhan ([[Boman Irani]]). He offers Vardhan a partnership, and they escape from prison after poisoning the other inmates.  In [[Zurich]] Don meets trusted companion Ayesha ([[Lara Dutta]]), and they retrieve the contents of a locker accessible only by Vardhaan. In it is a tape of J.K. Diwan ([[Alyy Khan]]), vice-president of the Euro-printing DZB (''Deutsche Zentral Bank''), who was sent by Fabian Kohl to bribe Singhania ([[Rajesh Khattar]]) to kill a competitor. Singhania was killed by Vardhaan five years earlier. Don blackmails Diwan into giving him the bank's blueprints so he can steal the printing plates. Diwan misleads him and hires Abdul Jabbar ([[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]]), a deadly assassin. However, Don escapes, and baits Jabbar to working for him. With no other choice, Diwan gives Don the blueprints.  Don and his team plan and execute a bank robbery, taking hostages. After stealing the printing plates he is betrayed by Vardhaan and Jabbar, but escapes. However, Sameer (a team member) calls the police and Don is arrested; he threatens Sameer for informing on him. Unable to enter the bank and free the hostages, the police are forced to work with Don in exchange for giving him German immunity.  Don and Roma reach Vardhaan and Jabbar. When ordered by Vardhaan and Jabbar - and even Don himself - Roma is shot by Jabbar when she refuses to kill Don. She still has feelings for Don, although he killed her brother five years earlier, and she also refused to kill him because she refused to do it the illegal way. Don defeats Vardhaan and his thugs, and kills Jabbar. Don ultimately saves the entire team. Don obtains his immunity papers, surrendering the plates and a disc with information about his team. He brings Roma to a waiting ambulance, and they exchange glances before the doors close. Don later detonates a bomb planted earlier in Diwan's car.  In a final scene Don still has one of the currency plates, which the police think was destroyed by the explosion. Sameer was actually loyal to Don; informing the police was part of the plan. The disc Don gave them actually contains the names of the European drug cartel; when they are arrested, Don becomes king of the European underworld and tells Ayesha and Sameer they have no idea how rich they will become. When Ayesha tells him she was afraid he would be caught, he says: ''"Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai"'' ("It is not just hard to catch Don, it is impossible.") and the film ends with the song "Dushman Mera".  
Dolphin Tale
 Sawyer Nelson, a lonely 11-year-old boy, has fallen behind in school since being abandoned by his father five years earlier. His only friend is his cousin Kyle, a champion swimmer who hopes to compete in the Olympics. Kyle leaves to spend time in the army.  One day on his way to [[summer school]], Sawyer finds a fisherman attempting to help an injured dolphin tangled in a crab trap. The dolphin is taken for treatment to Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA), run by Doctor Clay Haskett. Clay's daughter Hazel names the dolphin Winter, after two prior dolphins, Summer and Autumn, had been treated successfully and returned to the ocean. Sawyer sneaks in to see Winter, and later starts to visit each day, being harassed by a roof-dwelling pelican named Rufus. Their respective parents are initially hesitant (Clay since Sawyer does not have any experience with marine animals, and Sawyer's mother, Lorraine, since Sawyer is skipping summer school without permission), but they realize that the friendship seems to benefit both Winter and Sawyer. Dr. Clay allows the visits to continue, and Lorraine withdraws Sawyer from summer school and lets him volunteer at CMA, and gives him a new wetsuit.  However, Winter's tail is damaged and must be amputated. Winter learns to swim without a tail by developing a side-to-side motion like a fish, but after an X-ray, Clay notices the unnatural motion is causing unnatural stress on her spine, which if continued will cripple and eventually kill her.  News comes that Kyle has been injured in an explosion and is returning home for treatment. Sawyer is excited to see him, but devastated when Kyle, depressed, skips his own welcoming party and stays at the local Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where Doctor Cameron McCarthy develops prosthetic limbs. Sawyer and his mother visit Kyle there, but Sawyer is affronted when Kyle asks them to leave. Not wanting to upset Sawyer, Kyle takes Sawyer for a walk and explains his situation and that he needs some time. Sawyer then asks Dr. McCarthy if he could make a prosthetic tail for Winter. McCarthy agrees to do so and convinces his prosthetic supplier [[Hanger, Inc.|Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics]] to supply the parts at no cost. Dr. McCarthy manufactures a "homemade" model tail while waiting for the real one to arrive, but Winter rejects it by banging it against the pool wall. Meanwhile, Kyle gets more depressed when his friend and swimming partner, Donovan Peck, beats Kyle's old swimming records. McCarthy persuades Kyle to go home.  Then CMH, already in financial peril, is damaged by a hurricane. The board of directors agrees to close up and sell the land to a real estate developer, and find homes for all the animals except Winter; due to her condition she is not wanted, and may have to be put down. Kyle visits CMH and sees that Winter is like him, with a damaged limb. However, inspired by a girl with a prosthetic limb from [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], who comes to visit Winter, Sawyer imagines holding a "Save Winter Day" to save the facility. Clay is not convinced, but he reconsiders after talking with his father, Reed. Kyle agrees to race Donovan Peck and persuades [[Bay News 9]] to cover the event.  The Hanger-supplied tail finally arrives; however, Winter rejects it too. Sawyer then realizes what the real problem is: the plastic base for the tail is irritating her skin. Therefore, McCarthy develops an alternative gel-like sock which he calls "Winter's Gel" (which is the real name of the Hanger product used to attach prosthetic limbs, developed during research with Winter). Winter accepts this new prosthetic tail.  At Save Winter Day, the work with Winter impresses everyone. Sawyer's teacher gives him school credit, allowing him to pass summer school. The fisherman who found Winter on the beach comes too. The real estate developer decides to keep CMH open and to support it financially.  With Winter's help, Kyle then wins a swimming race against Donovan.  The ending shows documentary footage from Winter's actual rescue, several of the prosthetic tails that Winter has worn, and scenes of real amputees visiting Winter at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.

Doraemon: Nobita and the New Steel Troops—Winged Angels
 The movie's plot involves Nobita, who throws a temper tantrum because he wants a really large RC toy robot in order to upstage the rich kid, Suneo, who has been showing off the new robot that his cousin made. His fit makes Doraemon angry and he uses his Anywhere Door to get anyway from the summer heat cool off at the [[North Pole]]. Sometime later, Nobita follows and a discovers a strange bowling ball-like orb which starts blinking with a pulsating light, and summons what looks like a giant robot´s foot. After Nobita uses the foot to sled down, crashing into his room through the Anywhere Door, the bowling ball follows him home through the door and another robot piece falls into his backyard. A frozen Doraemon follows soon after, covered in ice before being thawed out and with a cold. Learning of the robot parts, Doraemon admits to Nobita that he has nothing to do with it as the two use the Opposite World Entrance Oil and the Roll-Up Fishing Hole to enter the World Inside the [[Mirror]], an alternate mirror world without people. There, they built the robot which Nobita christens the name "Zanda Cross" as he believed the sphere summoning the parts is from Santa Clause.  Using a [[Neural oscillation|brain wave]] controller that Doraemon pulls out of his pocket, Nobita has the robot perform gymnastic maneuvers in a mirror world before bringing Shizuka Minamoto to join the fun. The trio enjoy this but later, however, Shizuka accidentally presses a button on the control panel that makes the robot fire a huge [[laser]] beam that destroys a whole skyscraper. The group realizes just how dangerous Zanda Claus really is, and they decide to return to the real world and forget about ever having found the robot. However, Nobita forgot about the sphere that has been sending [[Telepathy|telepathic]] messages to a mysterious girl named Lilulu. The actual owner of Zanda Claus, Lilulu seeks out Nobita when he accidentally lets slip all that he knows about the robot. After Lilulu proceeds to force him into showing her where it is, Nobita borrows the Roll-Up Fishing Hole from the spare pocket Doraemon keeps in the closet to take her to the World Inside the Mirror. She reclaims Zanda Claus while getting Nobita to let her borrow the Roll-Up Fishing Hole for a while.  After some time, Nobita is visibly nervous about what she is up to and, after seeing two [[Meteoroid|shooting stars]] in a row, he uses the Bamboo Copter to investigate the forest at Mt. Ura. There, Nobita follows another shooting star through the unrolled Roll-Up Fishing Hole and finds Lilulu building a massive robot army. Doraemon, having been suspicious of Nobita's peculiar behavior at home, follows him there. They enter the mirror world and see a massive base being built by humanoid robots. The duo then use a long-range Paper Cup Phone to listen in on Lilulu as she orders the robots to work faster. She is revealed to be a human-hating robot. When Lilulu discovers them, Nobita and Doraemon escape to their own world with the portal accidentally destroyed by Zanda Claus.  But the two have completely forgotten about the sphere that is still at home, before it suddenly wakes out and bounces around. After Doraemon puts Translation Jelly, the sphere introduces itself as the 'brain' of Zanda Claus, while alerting him about a giant robot army that intends to conquer Earth and enslave all humanity. They try to alert the authorities but in vain as none of them believes Doraemon or Nobita. With only Suneo and Gian believing him and Nobita about the robot army, Doraemon pulls out a special kind of [[Incubator (egg)|incubator]] and puts the sphere with the Translation Jelly in it, causing it to hatch into a yellow chick that is named "Pippo" (one of the [[onomatopoeia]]s to describe the sound a peep makes in Japanese).  They reenter the Mirror World through Shizuka's Bathtub by using a special oil but leave Shizuka out of the mission due to the risky nature of the mission. But they are captured by the robot army with only Pippo and Nobita escaping. Nobita decides to help his friends and thus goes to the base to rescue them. At the base they see the robot army disposing off Zanda Claus whose actual name is revealed to be Judo. Pippo enters Zanda Claus and creates a distraction and Nobita rescues his friends. Meanwhile, Shizuka comes to know of the Mirror World and enters it. She finds a girl (Lilulu) who is injured and takes her home. Later Nobita, Doraemon, Nobita, Suneo and Pippo rejoin with Shizuka. Shizuka uses Doraemon's machine first aid kit to repair Lilulu.  This helps the gang gain Pipo's trust Nobita becomes good friends with Pippo. Lilulu had some traumatic experiences as a child, and she holds a very deep distrust and resentment towards humans. The only individual with whom she feels connected to is Pippo, whom she fixed "on a whim" after he was broken by the other robots. Despite everything Nobita and the others do for her,Lilulu escape and decides to alert the rest of the Robot Army that they are in a Mirror World and not the real Earth. The gang locates her before the meet and Nobita tries to stop her but Lilulu shoots Nobita with a laser beam from her finger. Pippo jumps in front of Nobita and becomes very badly injured, which gives Lilulu a wake-up call as she decides to help the humans while not disclosing the reason for the lack of people.  However, the commander and the rest of the robot army chain her up for her [[heresy]] and proceed to torture her for what she knows. Luckily, Nobita, Doraemon, and the others arrive with Zanda Claus and rescue her. Back in the real world, Lilulu still feels conflicted as her willing allows Doraemon lock her up in a [[birdcage]] using the Small Light.  In the meantime, the robot army becomes suspicious because of the lack of humans in the world. They discover that they are in a fake world after analyzing the [[Satellite imagery|satellite image]] of the world and comparing the image to another image of the current world, and seeing how they are reversed. They return to the lake where they first entered the fake world, which they believe is the connection doorway. Doraemon and the group intercept the army at the lake.  Lilulu and Shizuka remain at Shizuka's house to have a talk, which gives Shizuka a brilliant idea to save the world. She re-enlarges Lilulu, using the Enlarging Torch Light, and they both use the Walk-In Mirror to return to the real world.  Using the time machine, they return to 30,000 years ago on Megatopia, attempting to talk to the professor who created the robots from which the robot army is descended. The professor plans to redo everything by removing the competition instinct from his robots, replacing those instincts with instincts of humanity and love. He collapses before he can finish his job. Lilulu, in order to complete the salvation, disregards the fact that she and Pippo will disappear after they alter history, and she continues the reprogramming with instructions from the professor.  Back on Earth in the present time, the robot army, larger in number, has taken the upper hand.  Zanda Claus is heavily damaged in the process of destroying the leading ship of the robot army. Lilulu, back at Megatopia, has nearly finished her job when the professor breathes his last. At first, she doesn't know what to do, then she figures out that she needs only to add her feelings, her love from Nobita and his friends, including Pippo. The job is completed just in time.  The robot army is reinforced and attacks en masse. The reprogramming is successfully completed, and the robot army is completely erased, as are Lilulu and Pippo. Shizuka uses the Anywhere Door to return to Earth, rejoining her friends with sorrow.  The next day, the group is back in the real world, and Nobita is back in school. This time, he chooses to stay, and Doraemon arrives to talk to him before going to the [[baseball field]]. While Nobita wonders if Lilulu and Pippo may ever be resurrected, a shadow crosses his eyes and Lilulu appears with [[wing]]s on her back.  The wings take the appearance of Pippo in the form of a giant [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]. They visit Nobita with cheers, then vanish once again into the air. Nobita believes it was Lilulu and Pippo who appeared, and he runs to the field to tell his friends.

He is introduced to a young FBI agent, Ben Geary ([[Topher Grace]]) who is an expert on a former Soviet operative known as Cassius. Geary reasons that Cassius is the assassin due to his signature throat-slitting (garrotting) method.  Paul and Ben visit Brutus ([[Stephen Moyer]]), one of Cassius's proteges, who is locked up in prison, to learn the whereabouts of Cassius. They provide him with a radio and leave. The prisoner then swallows the batteries from the radio and fakes a poisoning/upset stomach. Upon arriving at a hospital, he regurgitates and spits out the batteries, overpowers the medical staff, and escapes. In the basement's garage, he is attacked by Paul, who reveals himself to be Cassius himself, the very operative who had previously trained the fugitive. Cassius slits his throat. He then moves to eliminate Ben too, only stopping when interrupted by Ben's wife—Cassius is unable to murder Geary in front of his family. Upon investigating the crime scene, Ben grows increasingly suspicious of Paul. Meanwhile, a Russian terrorist and murderer, Bozlovski ([[Tamer Hassan]]), has entered the U.S.  As the investigation deepens, Paul warns Ben to pull out, due to the possibility of harm not only to himself but his family. Ben, who has become obsessed with the idea that Paul is Cassius, starts his own parallel investigation. Meanwhile, Paul tries to contact Bozlovski in a factory where he escapes after an intense firefight. Ben examines another throat-slitting murder of Bozlovski's associate at the same site and is now convinced Paul is indeed Cassius.  Ben pieces together the events of Paul's life and determines that not only is Paul actually Cassius, but also that he is systematically murdering the people involved in the death of his wife and child, who were assassinated by Bozlovski.  Paul has now tracked down Bozlovski to a shipyard warehouse. A while later, Ben also arrives at the building. After being confronted with the evidence, Paul confesses everything. Paul then confronts Ben with the fact that Ben is a Russian spy, which Paul learned at one of Ben's informant drop-offs. He is able to convince Ben that Bozlovski is the actual threat. When Ben reveals that he has plans to return to Russia after this is over, Paul tries to convince him to stay in the FBI and with the family he has grown to love.  Together they hunt down Bozlovski inside the shipyard's warehouse. Bozlovski attacks Paul and Ben, and in the ensuing struggle, a mortally wounded Paul slits Bozlovski's throat using his garrote-watch. However, Paul himself later succumbs to his own injuries. As the only witness, FBI agent Ben relays the incident to his superiors and claims that Bozlovski was Cassius, thereby securing Paul's reputation and recognizing his heroism. As Ben departs, the CIA director Highland asks him whether he would ever consider working at the CIA.  The film ends with Ben returning to his home as a now-defected man who is no longer a double agent.

Dragon (2011 film)
 In 1917 [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republican China]], Liu Jinxi and his wife Yu are an ordinary couple with two sons, Fangzheng and Xiaotian, living together in Liu Village, [[Yunnan]]. One day, two bandits enter the village and attempt to rob the general store. Liu  happens to be in the shop, and he fights and kills the robbers when they turn violent. During an autopsy, the detective Xu Baijiu, who is sent to investigate the case, discovers that one of the dead bandits was Yan Dongsheng, who is among the government's ten most wanted fugitives. The local magistrate is pleased, and his fellow villagers regard Liu  as a hero.  However, Xu becomes suspicious because he does not believe Liu could accidentally defeat such a formidable bandit. Xu notes signs of brain hemorrhaging due to an injury to Yan Dongsheng's [[vagus nerve]]. From this and other evidence, Xu concludes that Liu is in fact a highly skilled martial artist who conceals his talent through misdirection. Investigating further, Xu discovers Liu's true identity: Tang Long, the second-in-command of the 72 Demons, a group of vicious and bloodthirsty warriors. Liu admits his past but states that he has reformed. Xu, an uncompromising lawman, does not accept that people can change, but he is perplexed when Liu fails to kill him when they are alone.  Xu immediately returns to the county office to obtain an arrest warrant for Tang Long. The magistrate delays issuing the warrant, citing lack of evidence while actually soliciting a bribe from Xu. Xu eventually obtains the bribe money from his estranged wife, who blames him for causing her father's suicide. After issuing the warrant, the magistrate informs the Master of the 72 Demons of Tang Long's whereabouts, hoping to receive a reward. Offended, the Master reveals that Liu is his son, and he kills the magistrate. The Master sends his henchmen to Liu Village to capture Liu and raze the village.  While Xu and the constables are on their way there, two henchmen reach the village and kill a villager to force Liu to acknowledge his identity. Liu kills one of the two assailants and runs away. The other assailant, the Master's wife, chases Liu and fights with him in the buffalo shed, where she is crushed in a stampede and nearly falls into a river. As Liu attempts to save her, she tells him that he is still Tang Long. She falls to her death, and the remaining villagers flee to a fortress for safety. Xu's deputies decline to save the village, preferring to wait for Liu and the 72 Demons to kill each other.  Using his knowledge of physiology, Xu devises a plan to fake Liu's death. However, the ruse continues too long, and Xu is forced to revive Liu in front of the 72 Demons, who have assembled to pay respect to their fallen comrade. As a sign of his dedication, Liu severs his left arm, announcing that he has broken all ties with them. The 72 Demons accept his statement but tell him that he must speak with the Master, who is waiting for him at his house. After a tense dinner in which the Master has taken Liu's family hostage, the Master announces that he will allow Liu to leave the 72 Demons, but Xiaotian's (Liu's son) blood is forfeit.  Enraged, Liu attacks the master with a broadsword, but the Master uses [[qigong]] to protect himself from the blade. Xu infiltrates the house through a hatch and, from underneath the floor, weakens the Master's defense during the fight by piercing his heel with an acupuncture needle. The Master incapacitates Xu and proceeds to overpower Liu. Before the Master can kill Liu, Xu attacks the Master with another acupuncture needle to the neck. The Master fatally wounds Xu, but the needles act as a lightning rod and earthing wire, and the Master is killed by a bolt of lightning. With his dying breath, Xu announces the case closed. Liu returns to his home, where he lives a normal life.

Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock
 The story starts where the TV special leaves off, with [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Bardock|Bardock]] fighting against [[Frieza|Freeza]],  in an attempt to save his home, Planet Vegeta. He fails, as Freeza destroys the planet, killing all Saiyans on it – seemingly including Bardock. However, somehow he survives the blast and wakes up in a little village house. A purple-colored creature enters the room and introduces himself as Ipana. He also tells Bardock that he is on the , which – as the confused Bardock recalls – was the former name of Planet Vegeta. Suddenly the village is attacked by henchmen of the pirate Chilled, whom Bardock easily defeats, earning him the gratitude of the villagers. He ignores their thanks and states that he doesn't care if they lived or died and flies away into a nearby cave to recover. Doctor Ipana's son Berry comes and brings him food. At first he yells him to go away, but soon they form somewhat of a friendship as Berry keeps bringing him food.  After a while, Chilled comes to find out what happened to his henchmen. The people tell him that a man called Bardock rescued them. Berry sees this and quickly runs to Bardock, telling him that there are people looking for him. After the villagers fail to find Bardock, Chilled and his henchmen start attacking them and destroying the village. At first, Bardock refuses to save them, but after Berry begs him, he flies to the village and saves Ipana, who was going to be killed by Chilled. Due to the resemblance, Bardock at first mistakes Chilled for Freeza and attacks him angrily, but Chilled seems to have the upper hand. However, after Chilled fires an attack at Berry to warn him not to interfere, Bardock becomes angry and transforms into a Super Saiyan. Chilled laughs and says that changing hair color to [[blond]] doesn't do anything and attacks Bardock with his blasts, which have no effect on Bardock anymore. He asks who he is, to which Bardock replies that he is just a Saiyan. Chilled launches a final desperate attack in order to destroy the planet, but Bardock's attack overpowers it and sends the mortally wounded Chilled into outer space. The dying Chilled tells his henchmen to warn his family about Super Saiyans. This reveals that Bardock was the Super Saiyan that was encountered centuries ago, therefore making him partially responsible for the events of the entire series, as it was Freeza’s fear of the Super Saiyans that drove him to wipe them all out and lead to Goku being sent to Earth.

Dylan Dog: Dead of Night
 In [[New Orleans]], Dylan Dog, an ace detective whose specialty is paranormal cases, narrates how he helped people with their cases until his wife, Cassandra, was killed by vampires. Since then he has been doing regular cases with his "partner", Marcus Deckler.  One night, when teenager Elizabeth Ryan calls her father, without getting an answer, she goes to her father's room and finds him dead on the floor. She is then surprised, and almost attacked, by a strange, hairy, creature. The next day, Dylan is informed, by Marcus, that Elizabeth asked for (and later hires) him. When Dylan interrogates her, she explains that he is the only one that can help her and shows to him a card (that is his old detective card) that says "No pulse?, No problem". Dylan sees it, stands up and goes out, stating that he doesn't "do that" any more, followed by Marcus.  That night Marcus is attacked and killed by an unknown creature (who Dylan thinks is the same creature that killed Elizabeth's father). Dylan decides to officially help Elizabeth with her case. He retrieves an old forensics kit from under the floorboards of his office and rides to Elizabeth's house. After finding a hair sample in the tree outside her father's study, he tells Elizabeth that the creature that killed her father is a female, eighteen- to nineteen-year-old werewolf, who is a member of the Cysnos werewolf clan. Dylan visits the Cysnos leader, Gabriel - an old friend of his - and realizes that Gabriel's 19-year-old daughter Mara might be his main suspect, an idea that makes Gabriel very angry. After he is told off by Gabriel, Dylan is attacked by Gabriel's older son Wolfgang who is then knocked unconscious by Dylan (who was using a silver gauntlet).  Dylan then finds Mara dead in a warehouse and is briefly attacked by an unknown vampire. He then goes to Elizabeth in order to determine what connections may exist between those involved. She shows him a book of artifacts her father imported and indicates that one of the items pictured is now missing after having been smuggled into the country. The same vampire from earlier attacks Dylan and Elizabeth at her home along with two others demanding "The Heart." Dylan fends them off long enough for them to make an escape and continue the investigation.  Dylan then goes to the morgue (which is run by zombies) to see Marcus's wound and discovers that Marcus has been turned into a zombie (and he also has a missing arm). Marcus initially doesn't believe Dylan, but finally accepts his condition after Dylan shoots him to prove it. Dylan then takes both Marcus and Elizabeth to "the body shop", which is a black market for body parts. While Marcus looks for a new arm, Dylan talks with the owner and is informed that the vampires, led by Vargas, are after an artifact known as "The heart". Dylan then goes to the Corpus House, a nightclub owned by Vargas. He talks to Vargas, an arrogant young vampire who denies being involved with the murders and tells Dylan to go while he still lets him to do so.  Dylan then visits his old vampire friend, Borelli. Borelli tells Dylan that the artifact known as "The heart" is called "The heart of Belial", a cross-like relic that holds the blood of Belial, an ancient monster who cannot be killed unless his/her master is destroyed. After he finds the heart in the tomb of vampire elder known as Sclavi, Dylan is ambushed by Vargas' men. After he awakens, Vargas traps him and Marcus inside the crypt, and takes the Heart. Before sealing the pair up, Vargas reveals that he was the one who killed Cassandra years ago, thus provoking Dylan to kill the vampire elders and leave Vargas in charge. After Marcus digs himself out and releases Dylan, the duo goes after Vargas who has taken Elizabeth to the Corpus House. Vargas reveals to Elizabeth that he intends to turn her into a vampire and inject the blood of Belial into her. Dylan enters the Corpus House and finds that both Vargas and Elizabeth are gone.  On his way to find Elizabeth and Vargas, Dylan realizes that Elizabeth is the real enemy and wants to turn Vargas into Belial as a revenge for her father's murder. She tells him that the reason is not revenge, instead she explains that her family - an organization of monster hunters - are the "good guys" and that the "monsters" (vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc.) must be destroyed. Dylan says that she is wrong and that she is the monster. She injects the blood into Vargas's body and escapes, but before she can do so she is attacked by Marcus who is knocked down by her. Dylan fights off Belial (who is slowly taking over Vargas's body) when Elizabeth tries to stop Belial from killing Dylan, claiming he should do as she says because she is its master. Belial states the anyone who stops him, including his master, is his enemy. After knocking her away, Belial continues after Dylan while Elizabeth escapes while Wolfgang (who was called by Dylan before the battle) and his werewolf allies attack Elizabeth. They manage to subdue and kill Elizabeth, and at the same time Belial dies in front of Dylan leaving Vargas's unconscious body. Dylan gives the heart to Wolfgang, the only one that Dylan can trust to protect it, and goes with Marcus.  Finally, Dylan decides to revive his paranormal detective agency. Using copies of the same card that Elizabeth gave him earlier, calling Marcus "partner"; something that Marcus had wanted for a long time.  
Drive Angry
  John Milton ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is an [[undead]] [[criminal]] who has escaped [[Hell]] and stolen [[Satan]]'s personal gun, labeled the Godkiller, to kill Jonah King ([[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]]), a cult leader who tricked Milton's daughter into joining his followers in the wake of Milton's death 10 years prior, only to kill her and her husband and steal their daughter (Milton's granddaughter) to be sacrificed in a Satanist ritual. King believes that if he kills the baby, he will unleash Hell over [[Earth]].  After interrogating and murdering some of King's followers, Milton discovers that the ritual will take place in Stillwater, an abandoned prison in [[Louisiana]]. He heads there, but stops by a diner, where he meets Piper ([[Amber Heard]]), a waitress. Milton's car is damaged in the pursuit, so he sabotages Piper's car, a 1969 blue [[Dodge Charger|Dodge Charger R/T 440]] and follows her to fix it in exchange for a ride on the way to Stillwater to find King.  Entering her room, Piper walks in on her boyfriend, Frank ([[Todd Farmer]]), having sex with another woman. Piper beats the woman and assaults Frank, getting knocked to the ground. Milton, in a phone booth nearby, hears the commotion and comes to Piper's aid, kicking Frank in the face as he is about to continue assaulting Piper, and punching Frank repeatedly. Milton steals his car, taking Piper along with him driving to Stillwater. Meanwhile, a supernatural operative of Satan, The Accountant ([[William Fichtner]]), arrives on Earth with the mission to bring Milton back to Hell and take the gun back. After interrogating Frank, he discovers that Milton and Piper are heading to Louisiana, and murders Frank with a bat before tricking a pair of state troopers into helping him by impersonating an FBI agent.  At a shady hotel, Milton is attacked by King and his men, who heard about his return, but he kills most of them. The Accountant appears with the police and chases after Milton and Piper, who are chasing after King's van. Milton uses the Godkiller to shoot the Accountant out of the road. They then follow King to a church, only to find it filled with King's followers. They are ambushed and captured. Piper is kidnapped and Milton is shot in the eye and left for dead, but he awakens and kills King's men before pursuing the RV once again. Inside, Piper breaks free and fights King before jumping out of the RV and onto Milton's car. King then disables the car by repeatedly shooting its engine.  Milton and Piper then meet Milton's friend Webster ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), who provides them a new car, a 1971 red [[Chevrolet Chevelle#Chevelle SS|Chevrolet Chevelle SS]]. Piper discovers that Milton is literally undead and had to abandon his daughter to protect her from his former companions, which is why she was so easily manipulated by King. Webster reveals that he died 10 years prior in a shootout, and that Webster personally carried his coffin. She also discovers that the Godkiller was stolen by Milton from Satan himself and has the power to completely destroy one's soul, preventing it from going to either Heaven or Hell.   After arming himself, Milton tells Piper that he cannot guarantee her safety and that she should leave, but she assures him that she has never had a worthy cause to fight for until now, and that she is with him regardless of the consequences. Milton tells Webster to stay behind, not wishing him to die. With the help of the Accountant, they evade the troops of Sheriff Cap ([[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]]) and finally arrive at Stillwater. The Accountant captures Piper and forces Milton to give up the Godkiller before he can engage King, but he allows Milton to go into battle against King and his followers to save his granddaughter, noting that Satan is more of a well-educated, calm warden of a very large prison, rather than a face of evil, and that he actually despises the sacrifices of innocent lives in his name.  While Milton slaughters King's men before they can sacrifice the child, Piper escapes The Accountant's clutches with the Godkiller. King eventually gets the upper hand on Milton and savagely beats him. Piper fires the Godkiller at King, but misses and hits one of his few surviving men instead. She is knocked out by the gun's recoil. King orders one of his female servants to murder the child. However, the woman, who had been caring for the baby ever since King stole her, finds herself unable to carry out the deed, making King angry. The Accountant attracts King's attention, allowing Milton to grab the Godkiller and shoot King, destroying his soul.   The Accountant retrieves the baby and allows Milton to say goodbye to her. Milton gives her to Piper, who promises to care for and protect her. Webster arrives and looks on as Milton "dies". After both Piper and Webster have left, Milton is revealed to be still "alive" and with the Accountant.   Following this, Milton makes good on his earlier promise to Webster, and nonchalantly drinks a beer out of what is left of King's skull. He agrees to go back to Hell, but warns that if he is punished too severely for his actions, he will escape again. The Accountant claims that he looks forward to it, insinuating that chasing Milton is the most fun he has ever had, before he wiggles his keys and manifests a black [[Chevrolet Bel Air|1957 Chevrolet Bel Air]]. He throws the keys to Milton, who drives off into the gates of Hell.

Several years later, he is offered a job by the Chief Minister of Goa: to flush out all the drug gangsters in Goa, which he accepts. His success leads to a panic among the drug suppliers. The drug dealers gather for a meeting led by Zoey ([[Bipasha Basu]]). Zoey guarantees them that their drugs will be in safe hands if they are given to a mysterious person named Michael Barbosa. Kamath decides to chase Michael Barbosa and finds out about Ricky.  When Kamath reaches Ricky, he is already dead. Kamath finds out about his [[cocaine]]-[[smuggling]] and his girlfriend, Rozanna ([[Mariah Pucu Gantois Gomes]]). They reach the airport on the same day Lorry is about to leave. Kamath encounters Rozanna and finds a photo of Lorry in her phone. She is allowed to go due to lack of evidence. Kamath then identifies Lorry as the person he had seen in Rozanna's phone. They detain him and find cocaine stuffed in his bag. Lorry is sent to juvenile jail, where his friend, DJ Joki Fernandes ([[Rana Daggubati]]), tries to get him out. It is then revealed that Zoey and Joki used to date. Zoey wanted to be an air hostess, but failed. Joki introduced her to his boss, Lorsa Biscuita a.k.a. the Biscuit ([[Aditya Pancholi]]), who had worldwide contacts. With the help of his contacts, Biscuit got her a job in airlines, though she had to smuggle cocaine to international regions to repay him. She ended up getting caught and was sentenced to 14 years in jail. Biscuit's contact got her free in 14 days, but to repay him, she had to sleep with Biscuit. She broke up with Joki and made her life drug-dealing with Biscuit.  Joki meets Zoey and the two end up sleeping together. Zoey gives him a video of Biscuit announcing that he is going to have a [[rave]] in neighboring Karnataka, out of Kamath's jurisdiction and that Michael Barbosa will be bringing and exchanging drugs. Joki gives this tape to Kamath. When Biscuit comes to know about Zoey and Joki, he kills Zoey. After recruiting Lorry for help, Kamath attacks Biscuit's party and arrests the drug dealers. When Kamath's colleague Rane asks him about Barbosa, Kamath says that he knows the secret of Barbosa and Rane kills Kamath. It is revealed that Rane was always involved with Biscuit. Joki later finds out about Kamath's death and arrives at the crime scene, fitting together the pieces as Kamath has. Michael Barbosa is not a man but a gravesite Biscuit uses for storing drugs. We see Joki carefully storing the bags of cocaine somewhere, then calling Rane to arrange a meeting. Lorry is now free of the charge and he comes out of jail. When Joki and Rane are going to meet Biscuit, Joki kills Rane saying that he knows Rane is the person who killed Kamath. Kamath's body is being cremated in an electric furnace owned by Biscuit. We see that this is where Joki has put the drugs, and Biscuit arrives only too late. Having been brought down by the destruction of his stockpile, Biscuit is killed by a woman who may be Rozanna. Lorry comes to a beach party where Joki is singing, and Tani joins him in a joyful reunion. The film ends with Joki riding on his bike envisioning Kamath and Zoey.

Drive (2011 film)
 An unnamed mechanic, who is a stunt driver and criminal-for-hire getaway car driver, lives in the MacArthur Park neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]]. His getaway driver jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades [[Jewish-American organized crime|Jewish mobsters]] Bernie Rose and Nino to invest in a car for the Driver to race, promising a large portion of the proceeds if the Driver wins. The Driver meets his neighbor Irene and her young son Benicio, growing closer as he spends more time with them. Their budding relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison.  Standard owes [[protection racket|protection money]] from his time in prison and is beaten up by [[Albanian mafia|Albanian gangster]] Cook, who demands that Standard rob a pawnshop to pay off the debt. Cook gives Benicio a bullet as a symbol that he and his mother are in danger, which the Driver takes after seeing Benicio fidgeting with it. The Driver, concerned for the safety of Irene and Benicio, offers to act as the getaway driver for the pawnshop robbery. Cook assigns them Blanche, one of his female associates, to assist them in the robbery.   The Driver finds and steals a 2011 [[Mustang GT]] for the job. The heist goes awry when the pawnshop owner shoots and kills Standard after Blanche returns to the car with the money in a duffel bag. Pursued by an unrelated mysterious adversary, the Driver and Blanche escape with the money after an intense car chase. The Driver hides with Blanche in a motel, where he learns from a news report that the pawnshop owner claims that Standard performed the robbery by himself and that no money had been stolen. The Driver slaps and threatens to beat Blanche when he suspects her to be lying about being oblivious to the second car. She then admits that the bag actually contains a million dollars and that she and Cook planned to re-steal the money for themselves by using the car that chased them. Two of Cook's men ambush them in their room and kill Blanche before the Driver manages to kill them both.  At the auto shop, Shannon offers to hide the money, but the Driver refuses. He hunts down Cook in a strip club, smashes his fingers with a hammer, threatens to kill him, and forcefeeds him the bullet that was given to Benicio. Cook reveals that Nino was behind the robbery. The Driver decides to return the money, but Nino dismisses the offer and instead sends a [[hitman]] to the Driver's apartment building. The Driver discloses his part in Standard's job and asks Irene to run away with him and the money, but she slaps him in anger of her husband's death and the Driver's involvement. Entering the elevator with her, the Driver encounters the hitman. He kisses Irene and brutally beats the hitman to death, leaving her stunned and horrified. Surprised that Nino knows his address, the Driver confronts Shannon, who reveals that he also unwittingly mentioned Irene. The Driver advises Shannon to flee for his safety.  At the pizzeria, Nino reveals to Bernie that the pawnshop money belonged to a low-level [[Philadelphia crime family|Philadelphia wise guy]] who is making inroads into their territory. Bernie insults Cook and scolds Nino for stealing from the East Coast [[American Mafia|Italian Mafia]], noting that their lives will be in danger if word of their involvement ever gets out. Nino, however, is tired of being patronized and even [[kike|ethnically slurred]] by the Italian-American mobsters. Bernie finds the steady flow of money a redeeming quality in dealing with the East Coast mob, but Nino uses that argument to further his point: that they must kill everyone tied to the robbery, including the Driver and Shannon. Bernie promptly murders Cook with cutlery from the pizzeria, thereby proving that he accepts Nino's plan. Shortly thereafter, when Shannon refuses to divulge the whereabouts of the Driver, Bernie kills him at the auto shop with a straight razor.  The Driver, disguising himself with a rubber mask from his stuntman job, follows Nino from the pizzeria to the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]] and [[side collision|T-bones]] his car onto a beach; he chases Nino from the wreck to the ocean and drowns him.

The Driver goes to meet Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. He gives Bernie the money, but Bernie attempts to kill him by  stabbing him in the stomach. The Driver pulls out his own knife and fatally stabs Bernie. He abandons the money next to Bernie's corpse and leaves. Irene knocks on the Driver's apartment door but to no avail.

The Eagle (2011 film)
  In the year AD 140, twenty years after the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]] disappeared in the north of Britain, Marcus Flavius Aquila, a young Roman [[centurion]], arrives in [[Roman Britain]] to serve at his first post as a garrison commander. Marcus's father, who was the [[Primus Pilus|Senior Centurion]] of the ninth, disappeared with the [[Aquila (Roman)|eagle standard]] of the ill-fated legion, and Marcus hopes to redeem his family's honour by bravely serving in Britain. Shortly afterwards, only Marcus's alertness and decisiveness save the garrison from being overrun by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribesmen in local insurrection. He is decorated for his bravery but honourably discharged due to a severe leg injury.  [[File:The Silchester Eagle, found in the Basilica of the Roman town of Calleva (Roman Britain), Reading Museum (7923959750).jpg|thumb|The [[Silchester eagle]], found in [[Silchester]], inspired the original ''[[The Eagle of the Ninth]]'' novel]] Living at his uncle's estate near [[Calleva Atrebatum|Calleva]] (modern [[Silchester]]) in southern Britain, Marcus has to cope with his military career having been cut short and his father's name still being held in disrepute. Hearing rumours that the eagle standard has been seen in the north of Britain, Aquila decides to recover it. Despite the warnings of his uncle and his fellow Romans, who believe that no Roman can survive north of [[Hadrian's Wall]], he travels north into the territory of the [[Pict]]s, accompanied only by his slave, Esca. The son of a deceased chieftain of the [[Brigantes]], Esca detests Rome and what it stands for, but considers himself bound to Marcus, who saved his life during an [[amphitheatre]] show.  After several weeks of travelling through the northern wilderness, Esca and Marcus encounter Guern, a Roman born Lucius Caius Metellus, one of the survivors of the Ninth Legion, who attributes his survival to the hospitality of the [[Selgovae]] tribe. Guern recalls that all but a small number of deserters were killed in an ambush by the northern tribes – including Esca's Brigantes – and that the eagle standard was taken away by the Seal People, the most vicious of the tribes. The two travel further north until they are found by the Seal People. Identifying himself as a chieftain's son fleeing Roman rule and claiming Marcus as his slave, Esca is welcomed by the tribe. After allowing the Seal People to mistreat Marcus, Esca eventually reveals that his actions were a ploy and helps his master to find the eagle. As they retrieve it, they are ambushed by several warriors, including the Seal Prince's father, the chief of the tribe. Marcus and Esca manage to kill them. Prior to dying, the chief reveals that he killed Marcus's father, who apparently begged for his life. Further more, the chief is revealed to be wearing Marcus's fathers ring. Marcus does not understand Celtic and asks Esca to translate, but Esca never reveals the fate of Marcus's father. With the aid of the Seal Prince's young son, they escape from the village.  The two flee south in an effort to reach Hadrian's Wall, with the Seal People in pursuit. Marcus, slowed by his old battle wound, orders Esca to take the eagle back to Roman territory and even [[manumission|grants the reluctant slave his freedom]]. Freed, Esca still refuses to abandon his friend and instead heads out to look for help. He returns with the survivors of the Ninth Legion just as the Seal People catch up with them. Guern reveals to Marcus that he saw Marcus's father die; He assures Marcus that his father was not a coward and fought to the end. The legionaries, wishing to redeem themselves, accept Aquila as their commander and prepare to defend the eagle standard. As an example to those who would betray their people, the Seal Prince kills his young son in front of Esca, Marcus, and the legionaries. He then orders his warriors to attack. A battle ensues, in which all the Seal Warriors are killed, along with most of the Ninth Legion soldiers, including Guern. Marcus kills the Seal Prince by drowning him in the river. With the enemy defeated, the bodies of both Britons and Romans are laid out by the victors. As Marcus commends their valour, he lights a funeral pyre for Guern. As Guern is cremated, Marcus, Esca and the few survivors of the Ninth return to Roman territory, where Aquila delivers the eagle to the astonished [[Roman Governor|governor]] in [[Londinium]]. There is some talk of the Ninth Legion being reformed with Marcus as its commander. But when Marcus and Esca wonder what they will do next, Marcus leaves the decision to Esca.  ===Alternative ending=== An alternative ending is featured in the DVD. Marcus decides to burn the eagle standard on the altar where the final battle occurred, instead of delivering it to the Roman governor. He tells Esca that he does this because the eagle belongs to the men who fought for it. Marcus and Esca are then shown approaching Hadrian's Wall on foot and talking about their plans for the future.  
Eating Out: Drama Camp
 Filmmaker Jason (Garikayi Mutambirwa) is shooting a film featuring Zack ([[Chris Salvatore]]). Upon learning of a drama camp owned by Dick Dickey (Drew Droege), the pair apply along with Zack's boyfriend Casey (Daniel Skelton). Their applications are all successful and the group travel to the drama camp. At camp they meet Benji (Aaron Milo), an attractive camper who insists that he is not gay; Penny (Lilach Mendelovich), a sweet camp help who is an aspiring actress; Lily ([[Harmony Santana]]), a headstrong transwoman; and Genieveve (Marikah Cunningham), a rich and untalented actress who likes Benji. At orientation Dick enforces a no-sex rule at the camp—much due to Dick himself not having had sex for seven and a half years.  Jason confronts Benji about his sexuality who admits he is gay, but is lying due to his attraction to Zack despite him being in a relationship with Casey. Benji and Zack continue to bond, including Zack choosing to be partners with Benji instead of Casey during a class taught by Tiffani ([[Rebekah Kochan]]), resulting in Zack and Casey beginning to drift from one another. Casey becomes suspicious of Benji's sexuality when he refuses to kiss Genevieve in a class, and so enlists the help of Penny to help. The pair stumble upon Conor (Steven Daigle) about to engage in sex with another camper and blackmail him into a trap to find if Benji is gay, but this fails.  Meanwhile, Jason begins to produce a rendition of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''. He casts Zack and Benji in the leading roles, in which they share a kiss, and Lilly in the lead female role. Lilly, initially happy, gets mixed messages about Jason's personal feelings for her. As rehearsals begin, Casey becomes increasingly dissatisfied with his relationship with Zack, leading to Penny secretly rubbing Zack with poison oak so he can not rehearse. Casey stands in for Zack, and is shocked to find Benji becomes sexually aroused during their kiss. At first worried, Casey decides he and Zack are not meant to be together and the pair agree to break up, with Casey encouraging Zack to ask out Benji. However, Benji reveals to Zack he had been lying about his sexuality from the beginning, upsetting Zack.  As the night of the show arrives, the group do their final rehearsals. Lilly becomes enraged with Jason for not telling her if he likes her and angrily leaves. Jason chases after her before Zack and Benji rehearse their kissing scene. This quickly leads to the pair undressing one another with the encouragement of Casey who is attempting to get the right chemistry between the actors for the show. Dick discovers Zack and Benji and mistakes them for having sex and expels them from the camp. Realizing it is his fault, Casey asks Penny for help. They enlist the help of Conor once more who has sex with Dick in his office, loud enough for the whole camp to hear. After this Dick accepts sex in the camp and allows Zack and Benji to perform.  During the debut performance, Lilly breaks character and forces Jason to tell her if she likes him. He eventually admits he does and the pair make out on stage. Zack and Benji make up and start a relationship before beginning to make out too. Off stage Casey is happy to see Zack and Benji together, before he bumps into fellow camper Beau ([[Ronnie Kroell]]) who offers to be Casey's rebound. Casey agrees and all three pairs stumble on stage together before the curtain closes on the show. Dick awards the group with the best show and the prize of a vacation. Shortly after the new couples leave the drama camp.  
Eating Out: The Open Weekend
 Zack ([[Chris Salvatore]]) and his new boyfriend Benji (Aaron Milo) are setting off to vacation at an all-male resort in [[Palm Springs, California]], with their friend Lily (Harmony Santana). In light of the veritable smorgasbord of available men that are sure to be awaiting their arrival, Benji has proposed that he and Zack open up their relationship, just for the weekend. He is not ready to limit himself sexually and explains that this will be a good way for them to explore together. Zack is less than thrilled with the idea, but he's eager to keep Benji happy and, after all, he likes sex too. At the same time, Zack's ex, Casey (Daniel Skelton), is making his way to the same resort with his hag-in-training, Penny (Lilach Mendelovich). Knowing that Zack will be there with his new boyfriend, Casey immediately goes into panic mode, recruiting his new friend, Peter (Michael Vara), to be his pretend boyfriend for the weekend, proving to Zack that he has had no trouble moving on from their relationship. However, it is not long before all plans go awry, and Benji starts making eyes at Peter, while Zack realizes he might not be as over Casey as he'd thought. With the gay boys otherwise engaged, Lily and Penny are soon locked in combat for the attention of Luis, the resort's sexy bartender, who also happens to be the sole straight man in sight.  
Easy!
 A retired teacher and novelist (Bruno), who survives by private tutoring, is currently writing the biography for former adult star (Tina). He then discovers that one of his students (Luca), a teenager who is on the brink of failure at school, is actually his son.  
Egaro
 Egaro is also the first celluloid tribute to the eleven Mohun Bagan players who won the shield, ten of them playing barefoot clad in folded dhotis with just one of them, Sudhir Chatterjee, wearing boots against a team with the right kit, boots, dress, infrastructural support and the typical bias of the White rulers against the coloured Ruled. But Egaro is not just about football. It is about the patriotic passion that drove these eleven players to unite thousands of Indians from the entire eastern regions who flocked in from Dhaka, Burdwan, Midnapore crossing barriers of caste, class, community and language to watch the players kick and beat up the British teams on the playing field without being punished by the rulers because it was all in the game. It is about the killer spirit where the killer took prominence not because it was a fight to finish, but because the final match was a battlefield where the winning could speed the movement against Imperial rule and towards freedom. It did, in a manner of speaking. After the historic win on 29 July 1911, the British felt pressured enough to shift its capital from Calcutta to Delhi on 12 December the same year.  The film explores a parallel theme of an underground revolution brimming underneath following the Partition of Bengal in 1905 and the hanging of Khudiram Bose for attempting to kill Kingsford in 1908. Nagendra (Shankar Chakraborty) leads a group of young freedom fighters in a fight to eliminate high-ranking British officers with indigenous bombs and fire-arms without harming the old, the women and the children. He castigates one of his revolutionaries, also a [[Mohun Bagan]] player, for paying more attention to football than to the revolution. But over time, he is convinced that this final match is no less than the revolution he is leading. He comes to the finals and motivates the same member he threw out to rise and play when he faints during the match felled by one of the many false kicks of the British team.  [[Mohun Bagan]] had entered the finals after having vanquished strong teams of the British side such as Rangers, St. Xaviers and Middlesex which consolidated the team’s confidence that the British teams were not as unconquerable as they thought. East Yorkshire Regiment scored one goal before half-time sending the entire audience into a tizzy and depressing the home team. But after half-time, the team scored two goals one by Captain [[Sibdas Bhaduri]] and the other by Abhilash Ghosh, a striker. The preparation towards the final match spans a major slice of the film including family and personal hurdles the team members face. Abhilash is a student at [[Scottish Church College]], along with teammate  Rajen Sengupta. Abhilash’s father does not care about his brilliant son’s involvement in a game that might anger the British rulers. Abhilash himself begins to rethink his stance because football, he feels, has reduced his duties towards those he loves. Sudhir Chatterjee, professor in the [[London Missionary Society]] College is insulted in the staff room by his British colleagues for daring to participate in a match against a British team. The Principal suspends him indefinitely. But Shibdas is determined to win even if one or two of the team drop out at the last minute. They don't.  Two British citizens prove that they too, are human. One of them is the match referee Puller who refuses to bend under pressure by the powers-that-be to treat the match as a ‘must-win-or-else’ ego trip against native Indians. The other is Piggot, a player of the Middlesex team who was badly injured in one eye by an inadvertent kick delivered by Abhilash. He gives Abhilash a clean chit though the officers who visit him at the hospital urge him to pronounce the Indian team player’s kick as intentional.  ''Egaro'' is a sports film where reality has been intermixed with elements of fiction. This makes the film more entertaining and exciting, filled with moments of suspense, hilarity, drama and a bit of romance thrown in delicately between Abhilash and Bina and the one-sided attraction his British colleague, the beautiful Elina feels towards her colleague Sudhir. Her reactions on the field where she sits on the British side and when [[Mohun Bagan]] scores each goal, she begins to fan herself rapidly to express her joy. The reactions of the audience provide a wonderful sense of relief and bonhomie and solidarity and patriotism bonded as one. Though three of the eight players are professional football players, their acting is beyond par and one cannot make the difference between the actors and the players. The cameos are wonderfully portrayed by renowned actors of Bengali cinema, theatre and television. The revolutionary segment is a bit overdrawn and dramatic at times. The tremendous violence by the police who kill revolutionary Satyen’s grandfather in prison could have been cut out. The flames of his pyre arousing flames of anger within his granddaughter Bina is a powerful touch.  Gopi Bhagat’s cinematography in one word is brilliant. Indraneel Ghosh’s art direction reproduces the period with old mansions and homes with brick walls with the plaster peeling off, the roadside shop selling hot fritters, the college staff room, the prison cell with amazing accuracy. Mayukh-Moinak’s music is very good but the background score by [[Arijit Singh]] is a bit too loud drowning the ambient sounds and the dialogue at some places.  
Ee Sanje
 [[Sanjjanaa]] plays a dual character in ''Ee Sanje'' where the first half has some rural backdrop while the second half has the city life as backdrop. Aarya, a nephew of actor [[Sudeep]], makes his debut.

Adding to his dissatisfaction, Boyd has deep, unfulfilled dreams of making it as a star in Hollywood, a desire frowned upon by his retired policeman father ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]).<ref name=true />  In a moment of desperation, Boyd grabs an old pistol, disguises his face with theatrical greasepaint, and goes out to rob a bank; this sets off a series of events leading to one of Canada’s most infamous crime sprees.  Boyd forms a gang, which includes Lenny Jackson ([[Kevin Durand]]), Ann Roberts ([[Melanie Scrofano]]), and Val Kozak ([[Joseph Cross (actor)|Joseph Cross]]).  Jackson is also a veteran of WWII, and with his muscular build is the picture of the hardened criminal. There is an uneasy relationship between him and Boyd, given the attention lavished on the latter by the media; yet the two of them, both war vets, have a deep, unspoken brotherly bond. Val Kozak (Joseph Cross) is in a similar bind as Boyd, with a young wife and a desperate need to support his family. But he is also carrying on an affair with Mary Mitchell (Charlotte Sullivan), a fur-coat-wearing, flashy blonde party girl, whose flamboyant facade reveals a woman with past hurts and a deep-seated need for love and attention.<ref name=true />    The foil to the gang’s mayhem is Detective Rhys, ([[William Mapother]]).

Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters
 An Oregon-based Tetris enthusiast by the name of Robin Mihara, longing to track down the best Tetris players in the nation for the purpose of organizing a competition, happens upon a website called [[Twin Galaxies]] which has been tracking video game world records since the 1980s. From this website he learns of record-holders and top scorers like Jonas Neubauer & Harry Hong (both of whom have maxed out with a high score of 999,999), Ben Mullen (world-record holder for most lines with 296), Dana Wilcox, and Jesse Kelkar.  In addition, he seeks to reconnect with several of the top players from the heyday of NES and Tetris—competitors from 1990's [[Nintendo World Championships]]—Trey Harrison and Thor Aackerlund, the latter of whom claims to have reached Level 30. Little has been heard of Aackerlund since his rise to notoriety as the poster child for video gaming in the 1990s, and being successful at playing video games is described by Mihara in the film as "the cornerstone of a very difficult life [for Thor]."  Regardless of his reluctance, Aackerlund is able to put the past behind him and agrees to participate. With the addition of competitors like Matt Buco and Bay area Tetris Grandmaster Alex Kerr, the stage is set to for the top eight competitors to go head-to-head in Los Angeles, vying for the title of Tetris Champion in the first ever [[Classic Tetris World Championship]].

Flewin, multi-platform champion gamer Chris Tang, and a special appearance by [[The Tetris Company]] CEO [[Henk Rogers]].

He leaves immediately and kills the snipers watching the club of his weapons dealer, Jimmy ([[Kevin Bacon|Bacon]]), taking one of their cellphones. Church arranges a meeting with Rajahdon, but hides outside until Rajahdon leaves. Church follows him back to a [[brothel]] and pays for a room. After entering the room, he asks the girl if Rajahdon is the boss and where he is. He sees Mae riding a white elephant toward him and wakes up at his hideout. He tells Mae his business is finished in Bangkok. Church then wakes up and it is revealed the previous fight sequence was all just a dream.  Boss Katha and Advisor Bhun discuss how to find Church when Rajahdon walks in. It is then revealed that Rajahdon is Katha's son. The planned assassination of Bhun and the gang war was secretly intended by Rajhadoon as a means for him to ascend to power.

Elles (film)
 The film is set during the course of one day. Anne ([[Juliette Binoche]]) is trying to meet the deadline for her article about prostitution, while shopping and preparing dinner for her husband's boss and his wife. She is also worried about her two sons, the eldest of whom has been skipping classes while the younger appears to start being hooked on video games. This narrative is interrupted by the flashbacks to the conversations Annie has had with the two students, scenes from their lives, and the effect that their work in the sex industry is having on them and those close to them.  Anne interviews Alicja ([[Joanna Kulig]]), arriving from Poland to study in France, she not only lost her suitcase but found the student advisors to be less than helpful in her hour of need. Another student came to her rescue, but admitted that his generosity was part of the courtship. By the time we see her being interviewed by Anne, Alicja has earned enough to have a very nice apartment along with designer clothes and handbags. She is much more hedonistic than Charlotte and proceeds to get Anne drunk during the course of the interview in her apartment. When asked who her clients are, Alicja simply replies that they are bored husbands. For Alicja, being alone in a foreign country has led her to seemingly much more freedom than she enjoyed at home, but when asked if she wanted to stop, she admits that there is an element of addiction with the way she earns money.   Charlotte ([[Anaïs Demoustier]]) is quite a different person, she seems very relaxed about the sex she has with her clients. She has tried doing part-time work but found that her studies suffered so she turned to prostitution. But she still does the occasional shift as she needs to be able to explain to her family and boyfriend where the money comes from. These sexual encounters inevitably lead to conflict in her relationship with her boyfriend who at one point demands to know if she is seeing someone else. Her friendly, girl-next-door nature leads her clients to confide in her about their lives – their jobs, their wives – which has surprised Charlotte as she had imagined the work would have been non-stop sex.   How the students' lives turn out is left to the viewer to decide, with the end of the film focusing more on Anne's life and the effect these encounters with the two students have had on her and her relationship with her husband.

Her son and his family live in a crumbling apartment in the industrial suburb. After being approached by Elena, Vladimir makes it clear that he is not going to subsidize Elena's relatives, and informs her that he plans to make emendations to his will leaving his wealth to his only daughter from an earlier marriage with some residual monthly payments to be made to Elena. Elena is terrified by the prospects of such a new will and decides to murder him by switching his own medicines with Viagra, which is extremely dangerous in his post-infarct state. When he dies in bed, she then destroys the handwritten version of the new will which he had not yet been able to formalize with his attorney. Following the destruction of these handwritten notes she then calls officials to find the dead body in bed with her claim that she has no idea and no sense of how and why he died.  The death is found upon medical examination to have been caused by the foolish abuse of medications by Vladimir himself, and the actions of Elena as the culprit are completely overlooked. In the absence of a formal will, he dies intestate and Elena inherits half his estate with the other half going to his only daughter. Elena then takes a substantial amount of money to her son in order to pay for her grandson's education. She is thanked and receives the unexpected news that her son's wife is expecting another child.

Elevator (2011 film)
 Nine people board an elevator in a [[New York City]] skyscraper 52 stories tall: security guard Mohammed, television reporter Maureen and her fiance Don, comedian George, newly widowed Jane, overweight employee Martin, pregnant Celine, and the building owner Henry Barton with his spoiled ten-year-old granddaughter Madeline, who are on their way to a company party on the top floor.  On the way up, George, a claustrophobic, panics and, on the 49th floor, Madeline hits the emergency stop button to torment him. Henry presses the lobby floor button, but the elevator only descends by a few feet and stops. Henry presses the call button and alerts security. When the elevator fails to move, security dispatches a maintenance crew.  While waiting for help, the group talk with each other. Jane, who says that her son died in [[Iraq]] in the last year, confronts Henry and says her husband lost everything because Barton Investments pushed junk bonds. In her anger, she planned on "making a point" at the party. Suddenly, Jane collapses and dies of a [[heart attack]], but before she dies, she admits that she has a bomb. After arguing, Celine checks Jane's body and finds the bomb secured around her waist by means of a bike lock. Don tries to look for a way out via the ceiling, to no avail.  Don stops Celine from smoking, and she asks when he became a concerned father. Maureen overhears and demands an explanation; Don confesses he is possibly the father of Celine's unborn child. Maureen is distraught. Henry once again calls security, but he angers them and they stop responding. Maureen documents the events with her phone and sends them to her television station, which picks up the story and starts running the footage she has captured.  The other force open the doors, and Don attempts to climb out.  The opening is too small, but he uses Jane's walking stick to press the elevator call button. At the same time, Madeline presses several buttons on the control panel. The elevator's brakes deactivate, and Don's arm is severed as the elevator drops several floors. Mohammed uses a necktie as a tourniquet to slow the [[blood loss]]. Henry is left confused and dazed. George suggests that they pry open the doors again to see if the elevator has lined up with a floor in their drop, but they discover that the elevator stopped between floors, much to their dismay. Martin brings up the local news on his phone, and they watch a live interview with the bombmaker. The man was good friends with Jane's son and felt that he owed their family. He estimates it will detonate in ten minutes.  Desperate, George suggests dismembering Jane's body to separate her from the bomb and throw it down the shaft. When he loses his nerve, an angry Henry takes over and promises each person $1 million if they survive. While they are trying to tear the bomb off, a security guard on the intercom tells them that the bomb squad is there and lowering the elevator.

Paul, enamoring Jenna and befriending Dean, comes up with a plan to kidnap three kids of wealthy families for ransom.  The scene shifts to a lake house where two men, Clifford Jones ([[Stephen McHattie]]) and  Richard Nader ([[Ray Liotta]]) and a butler (Anthony Ulc) await a third man, and each of their kids. Elsewhere Jenna and Dean abduct the three kids Jeff ([[John Bregar]]),  Nick ([[Dustin Milligan]]) and Hailey ([[Laura Vandervoort]]) and bring them to a house. Paul reappears after other arrangements, calls Clifford's house and demands 1 million dollars from each father to be wired to an offshore bank account. Scared, Clifford pays right away and advises Richard to do the same. Richard's transaction does not go through as his agent tells him he does not have enough money. Bob has not yet come and they are unable to reach him.   The kids are locked, blindfolded and tied in a basement. Paul is shown to light a cigarette while telling Jenna to keep watch. Dean, wanting to derive some fun for himself with victims, is disappointed when he's not assigned. Paul calls the fathers and learns that the one million dollars will not be coming from Bob, who has not yet arrived to receive the message. Aware that Paul has decided to kill the rich kids regardless of whether the ransom is paid or not, antisocial Jenna gets carried away and shoots Bob's son, Jeff. Overhearing the shooting, the fathers learn Jeff is dead. Paul agrees to two million dollars and warns that if the money does not make it to the account he will kill the remaining two. When Bob ([[Victor Garber]]) does arrive, the fathers try not to tell him Jeff is dead for fear of jeopardizing their own children's lives, but are somewhat conspicuous in their efforts. Bob sends his one million dollars only to later learn that he paid instead for Hailey.  Paul, unhappy with Jenna, tells his co-conspirators that his intention was not to shoot their hostages but to blow up the house. Meanwhile, Nick and Hailey, distraught by Jeff's death and that his body lies beside them, manage to free themselves. Nick, recognizing the location as his father's home, decides they should break for Rick's house, which is nearby. The kidnappers discover the escape. Paul tells Jenna and Dean to find the kids, but only kill them if money is not received. Dean catches the kids in the woods and holds them at gun point. When the money comes in, Paul re-transfers it, calls the fathers and instructs them to stay put. He then calls Dean and tells him to let the kids go and rendezvous at the gas station as he has the money. Dean, upset about not being allowed to inflict damage, shoots Nick, loses his balance and falls over, discovering that the gun Paul gave him is loaded with blanks. The kids escape.  Jenna tracks the kids to the gas station. In self-defense and anger, Nick strangles Jenna. Nick and Hailey again escape and make it to Rick's house. Dean arrives at the gas station to find Jenna lifeless on the ground. Paul leaves the house, taking one of three beer bottles from the house. He confronts Dean and reveals that he has framed Jenna and Dean as obvious antisocial suspects.  Paul kills Dean, makes it look like suicide, and goes to Rick's house. Paul is the Butler's son and he plays the victim of a struggle. While awaiting the police, Paul lights a match that illuminates Hailey's face.

Eva (2011 film)
  The film is set in 2041, in the time when humans live along with machines. Álex ([[Daniel Brühl]]), a renowned cybernetic engineer, returns to his hometown of Santa Irene after a ten-year absence on the behest of the Robotic Faculty, led by Julia ([[Anne Canovas]]), his old mentor. Julia has commissioned him to finish the SI-9, a robot built to resemble a child -- a project that Álex abandoned prematurely after working on it with Lana ([[Marta Etura]]), his old lover, who is now married to David ([[Alberto Ammann]]), his brother, both of whom had given up researching to teach.  Álex visits Julia as she lectures students in a robotics laboratory. When a small robotic horse continually fails its tests, the pair of students decide to dismantle it with the phrase "What do you see when you close your eyes?" The robot falls to the ground, and Álex gently admonishes them, telling them that even if they restart the robot, it will never be the same; the phrase "kills" the robot by destroying its emotional memory, and thus, its soul.  Julia and Álex view videos of children, trying to find a suitable child to model the SI-9 off of, but Álex considers them all too ordinary, and they would only make an ordinary robot by proxy. When he returns to his deceased father's house in order to complete his work, he is met by SI-7 robot Max ([[Lluís Homar]]), who has been sent to cook and clean for him. Max is startled by Álex's robotic cat and is frustrated when it does not listen to commands; Álex tells him that it is a "free robot," illegal programming that allows it to act as a sentient being. Leaving Max to clean, Álex takes a drive to observe children in order to find a "unique" child to model the SI-9 off of. His attention is caught by the unusual Eva ([[Claudia Vega]]), a young girl who notices him and teasingly calls him a pervert when he admits that he was watching her. He asks if she'd like to be the model for his robot, but she refuses.  David presses Álex to visit for dinner, and when Álex arrives, he is surprised to discover that Eva is actually Lana's child and his niece. Eva later visits Álex at his house and assists Álex with modelling the SI-9 through emotional recognition. Álex is amused by her small tantrums and shows her the SI-9 in action. Later that night, as Lana gives Eva a bath, Eva asks her about Álex; Lana tells her that both she and David were hurt and saddened when Álex left abruptly in the middle of the SI-9 project. Eva asks if she loved Álex like David, and Lana replies that she did, "more or less."  Álex asks Julia if the SI-9 project should be modeled after a girl and not a boy, though Julia warns against the negative emotional side-effects of the change. Álex also meets with Lana, who says that she does not want Eva to be in Álex's project. Later, David invites Álex to the upcoming graduation party, and implies that he knows that Lana was Álex's first love and that he suspects lingering feelings between the two. Álex goes ice-skating with Eva, and she leads him up a cliff to look out at the city before pointing out her own house; she tells him that David and Lana do not live together. Álex, however, realizes that she is lying when he goes to visit Lana and David returns home. He asks Eva why she lied, and she tells him that it was because it was what he wanted to hear.  While experimenting with it, the SI-9 becomes hostile to Álex after he laughs at it in the same way Eva became upset. The SI-9 refuses to obey Álex's commands, and when it throws a weapon at him in a fury after he refuses to let it leave, he says the kill phrase and it "dies," along with all of his work on it, frustrating him. He later goes to the graduation party, where Lana and David are waiting; he slow dances with Lana, much to the annoyance of David, who leaves. Lana takes Álex with her to look for him, but when Álex impulsively kisses her, she leaves, disturbed. David, who had seen the kiss, attacks Álex and tells him that he already abandoned Lana once, and that he should go.  A disappointed Álex tells Julia that he is going to quit the project, and she accuses him of leaving another project half-finished. He also visits Eva to tell her that he is leaving, upsetting her. As he packs his things together back at his house, Álex is visited by Lana, who tells him that she does not want him to leave; they kiss, and after Eva approaches to see them through the lab's glass roof, Eva sees Lana tell him that Eva "looks like us because we both made her." Disturbed, Eva runs off. Lana pursues her, but tells Álex to wait back at the house for her to return.  Lana finds Eva unconscious in the snow and opens up a panel in her back, revealing Eva to not be her and Álex's child but a robot, and the product of their research on the SI-9 (literally made by them). She replaces a vial of fluid into Eva's back and Eva regains consciousness, but Eva is frightened and hostile; when Lana tries to grab her, Eva pushes her, and Lana falls off the side of the cliff. Eva returns to Álex's house alone and faints into his arms when he answers the door. At night, Álex gets a call from David that Lana is in the hospital, and he and Eva drive over, arriving just minutes before Lana dies.  Eva tells Max in private that she pushed Lana, and Max relays this to Álex. Julia visits Álex and tells him that Lana finished the SI-9 project after he left, but Eva could not pass the security test and thus wasn't considered safe enough to use; despite this, Lana insisted on keeping Eva, and Julia allowed it. Julia tells Álex that Eva cannot continue to live, and though Álex insists that she's only a girl, Julia reminds him that she killed Lana. Julia offers to "kill" Eva, but Álex tells her that he will do it.  Álex watches Eva skate one last time with Max, and he and David embrace in the shared loss of Lana. That night, Álex takes Eva to his room, preparing to dismantle her; Eva asks Álex to make sure that she doesn't do anything "evil" again, but quickly realizes that he can't fix her. Álex holds the frightened Eva tightly before saying the kill phrase, which ends her programming immediately. Álex looks on at the dead Eva with tears as the camera pans back, showing the "bulbs" of Eva's emotional memory shattering. The film ends with Eva narrating her dying dream -- what she "sees," in response to the kill phrase: playing on a beach forever, with Álex and Lana.

Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (film)
 Nine-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn), who has [[Asperger syndrome]], is the son of [[German American]] Thomas Schell ([[Tom Hanks]]). Thomas often sent Oskar on missions to do something connected with one of his riddles. The last riddle he gives Oskar proves that New York City once possessed a Sixth Borough. In a flashback, Thomas and Oskar play a scavenger hunt to find objects throughout New York City. The game requires communication with other people and is not easy for the socially awkward Oskar, who is told "If things were easy to find they wouldn't be worth finding".  On September 11, 2001, Oskar and his classmates are sent home from school early while his mother Linda ([[Sandra Bullock]]) is at work. When Oskar gets home, he finds five messages from his father on the answering machine saying he is in the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. When Thomas calls for the sixth time, Oskar is too scared to answer. The machine records a sixth message which stops when the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|building collapses]]. Oskar knows his father has been killed and falls to the floor. He replaces the answering machine with a new one and hides the old one so his mother will never find out.  A few weeks after what Oskar calls "the worst day", he confides in his German grandmother and they become closer. Oskar's relationship with his mother worsens since she cannot explain why the World Trade Center was attacked and why his father died. Oskar tells his mother he wishes it had been her in the building, not his father, and she responds, "So do I". After, Oskar says he did not mean it, but his mother doesn't believe him.  A year later, Oskar finds a vase in his father's closet with a key in an envelope with the word "Black" on it. He vows to find what the key fits. He finds 472 Blacks in the New York phone book and plans to meet each of them to see if they knew his father. He first meets Abby Black ([[Viola Davis]]), who has recently divorced her husband. She tells Oskar she did not know his father.  One day, Oskar realizes that a strange man ([[Max von Sydow]]) has moved in with his grandmother. This stranger does not talk because of a childhood trauma caused by his parents' death in World War II. He communicates with written notes and with his hands which have "yes" and "no" tattooed on them. As they become friends and go together on the hunt to find what the key fits, Oskar learns to face his fears, such as those of public transport and bridges. Eventually, Oskar concludes that the stranger is his grandfather and plays the answering machine messages for this stranger. Before playing the last message, the stranger cannot bear listening any longer, this message being his son's last words, and stops Oskar. Later on, the stranger moves out and tells Oskar not to search anymore.  When Oskar looks at a newspaper clipping his father gave him, he finds a circled phone number with a reference to an estate sale. He dials the number and reaches Abby, who wants to take Oskar to her ex-husband, William, who may know about the key. William ([[Jeffrey Wright]]) tells Oskar he has been looking for the key. William had sold the vase to Oskar's father who never knew the key was in the vase. The key fits a safe deposit box where William's father left something for him. Disappointed and distraught because the key does not belong to him, Oskar confesses to William that he did not pick up the phone during his father's sixth and final phone call and then goes home. He proceeds to write letters to all the people he met and thank them for their kindness.  Oskar's mother tells Oskar she knew he was contacting the Blacks. She then informs him that she visited each Black in advance and informed them that Oskar was going to visit and why. Oskar makes an artbook-like scrapbook filled with pop-ups and pull tabs like a children's book, of his scavenger hunt and all the people he met and titles it "Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close".

Ex – Amici come prima!
  Fabio's girlfriend Esther dumps him with a text message. Devastated, he attempts to jump from the roof terrace of his office but his colleagues manage to hold him back. However, in their grapple they knock over a flowerpot, which falls onto the street below, narrowly missing the car of lawyer Sandra. Just then Max pulls into the parking space which Sandra had meant to occupy, after half an hour of searching. After a heated discourse she finally arrives at her office, late for an appointment with Mrs Marangoni, who wants to file for divorce after her husband has left her. Believing he is cheating on her, she is seeking revenge. Sandra reveals her own recent breakup, and the two women quickly bond. Unbeknownst to Sandra, her client’s husband is no one other than Max.  Antonio, a pharmacist from [[Sorrento]] and newly elected [[Member of the European Parliament]], is celebrating his new position. His wife Nunzia appears to be more excited about it than himself, as she is seeking to exploit her husband’s position for financial advantage. As Antonio is approached by two old friends asking for “favors”, she demands 30% of any profit Antonio helps them gain. As she accompanies Antonio to the airport (not without lecturing him on what she expects him to do in [[Brussels]]), she wishes him a good journey, though he insists that her good wishes will bring him bad luck.  Newlyweds Floriana and Marco are also at the airport, leaving for their honeymoon. As Marco parks the car, he encounters his old flame Consuelo. They had planned to go on a date five years earlier but waited for each other in different locations, believing the other had lost interest. Consuelo is still single, and Marco claims the same. They exchange phone numbers.  Fabio, somewhat calmed down after the incident on the roof, has been accompanied home by his colleague Paolo, who tries to cheer him up by repeating to him the pleasures of the single life he is enjoying himself, but Fabio is not convinced. Upon spotting a photography of Esther, right after Paolo has left, he attempts to jump from the balcony of his apartment. This time, Professor Rinaldi, a psychiatrist who has his practice on the floor below Fabio's apartment, manages to stop him and convinces him to seek his professional advice.  Paolo is in a bar, trying to hit on a girl named Alessia. Sandra is in the same bar with a friend, who is looking out for male company and also trying to get Sandra hooked up with someone, but Sandra is visibly not interested and leaves soon after. It is raining, and there are no taxis available. She tries to grab a free taxi, only to discover that Max had the same idea at the same moment. Another argument ensues, and after discovering they are both going to [[Lungotevere]], they agree to share the taxi.  Paolo has been successful with Alessia and they arrive at her place. He is somewhat surprised to see that she lives with her parents, but she reassures him that they are “modern” and more worried about her not returning home at night that they are about her bringing a one-night stand home. Eventually she ends up summoning her entire family for help when Paolo has trouble putting on his preservative.  Antonio’s flight to Brussels has been forced to land in [[Munich]] due to the [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull|eruption of an Icelandic volcano]], in which Antonio sees the "curse" of his wife confirmed. In a crowded restaurant he encounters Olga, who is from the Baltics. The waiter, apparently from [[Campania]] like Antonio, had decided to serve Antonio first, even though Olga had ordered the same schnitzel almost an hour earlier. Antonio, put off by this favoritism, offers it to Olga, and they eventually agree to share Olga's schnitzel and Antonio’s bottle of wine. The wine and their shared passion for Italian opera break the ice between them and when, after a long and pleasant evening, Antonio locks himself out of his hotel room, they spend the night together. In the morning, however, she reveals to him that she is married.  Upon arriving at her place, Sandra discovers that she has forgotten her keys. Max takes her to his place, eventually offering her to stay for the night, and she realizes he is not as rude and arrogant as she first thought. They spend the night together. In the morning, Max runs off in a hurry to take his kids to school, but not before exchanging phone numbers—and names—with Sandra. As he is staying at the place of a friend, who is away in [[New York City]], Sandra does not recognize the name on the door and thus does not realize that he is the husband of her client. Even as they talk at the bar in the evening, and Sandra points out similarities between Max's divorce and her client, she dismisses the possibility.  Floriana and Marco are spending their honeymoon on a cruise ship, where Marco goes to great lengths to prevent his affectionate, albeit slightly suffocating wife from discovering his attempts to get in touch with Consuelo.  Fabio tries to start a new, active life, only to bump into Esther and her new boyfriend on his first day at the gym. He runs off to see Rinaldi. The latter is out of the office but is expected to be back in an hour. Fabio agrees to wait in his office while the receptionist goes on her lunch break. Just then, Valentina storms into the office. She has just been left by her boyfriend and threatens suicide if the professor (for whom she mistakes Fabio) will not listen to her immediately. Fabio plays the part and learns Valentina's boyfriend Guido has dumped her with a text message much like the one that Esther had sent him. Valentina is devastated, as she and Guido had agreed on everything, except for their choice of salad—the very difference Esther mentioned in her breakup message to Fabio. Realizing the professor will soon be back, Fabio interrupts the session and agrees to see Valentina again the next day, with whom he has fallen in love instantly.  It is Antonio's first day at the European Parliament and he encounters the other two Italian MEPs, Pasquale Lo Foco and Giovanni Ventolin. The first person to speak at the session is no one other than Olga Tammsaare, Antonio's acquaintance from Munich. Antonio is shocked to see her and learn that she is a prime minister. As the three Italians go for lunch, Lo Foco and Ventolin show Antonio the web sites of escorts the two are frequently seeing, but Antonio’s mind is occupied with Olga and he is, again, put off by the same attitude he has come to dislike in his wife. He reprimands his colleagues for their behavior and leaves the restaurant.  Floriana and Marco have returned from their honeymoon, and it is their first day back at the bank where they both work. Consuelo has just returned from Paris and invites Marco to her place. Marco obtains an alibi from his colleague Marullo so he can sneak away. However, right in front of Consuelo’s place, he is taken hostage by a terrorist trying to escape from the police. The hostage taking is televised live, and Marco scrambles to explain the incident to Floriana, who has followed it on TV.  Antonio receives a call from his wife, who lectures him once more and wishes him goodnight. The bad luck he expects it to bring about follows immediately: Lo Foco knocks on his door, asking him to hide an escort in his room, as his wife is coming for a surprise visit. He has just closed the door when Olga knocks outside, and Antonio tells the escort to hide under the bed. Olga, equally shocked upon seeing Antonio at the European Parliament, reminds him to not reveal to anyone what happened in Munich.  Valentina sees Fabio again and reveals that during a sleepless night she has decided to seek out one-night stands, as she has had only three men in her life. That night Fabio has a nightmare about Valentina making out with a plumber. He is woken up by a phone call from Valentina, who asks to postpone their next session because she needs to call the plumber. Terrified, Fabio tries to stop her until she reassures him that the plumber's visit will be a purely professional one. They meet again two days later, and Valentina reveals to Fabio (whom she still believes to be Professor Rinaldi) that she has fallen in love with him and wants to cancel their patient relationship, as the supposed professor's work ethics presumably prevent him from going any further.  Sandra is summoned to her boss's office, surprised to find Mrs Marangoni there, who has found out about her and Max through a detective. Her boss fires her on the spot, and she angrily confronts Max about it, believing he sought her out on purpose. Valentina has also discovered the truth when attempting to pay for her sessions with Professor Rinaldi, and makes Fabio an angry scene.  Antonio has travelled to [[Vilnius]] to meet Olga again, but she explains that her responsibilities make it impossible for her to continue their relationship. The same day, she phones him and unexpectedly invites him to spend the weekend with her. Antonio accepts, but to his surprise Olga's husband and two children are also present. During a conversation over dinner, both Olga and her husband mention the sacrifices Olga has made to enter politics, and that she cannot betray the trust her country has placed in her. Antonio is finally convinced not to pursue a romantic relationship with Olga any further.  After Consuelo has unexpectedly turned up at Mario’s workplace and stormed out angrily upon learning that Mario is married to Floriana, Mario continues to pursue her. She demands that Mario choose between Floriana and her. As Floriana is spending an evening out with her friends, he leaves her a note, declaring he is leaving her, and arrives at Consuelo’s door with a suitcase. However, when in an unattended moment he finds her diary, he discovers that she has worked as an escort, frequently changes partners and is just looking for financial security in him, already with no intentions of being faithful. Realizing what he has in Floriana, Marco remorsefully returns home, just in time to grab the note from the hands of Floriana (who has just returned home), "read" it to her—substituting the content with a declaration of his love for her—and swallows the letter.  Paolo, just having been turned down by a girl, receives a call from Fabio, asking him to deliver a eulogy if "something were to happen" to him. Fabio is ready to jump to his death from a bridge, but his plans are disrupted by the presence of Valentina, who is standing on the brim of the same bridge for the same reason. Fabio finally reveals how Esther dumped him the day before he met Valentina, the same way Guido broke up with Valentina, and falling in love with her kept him from committing suicide. As both abandon their suicide plans and slowly balance towards each other, Valentina slips and both fall off the bridge, only to land on a boat passing below.  As Sandra is collecting her things in the office, one of her clients comes in with a video of her husband that a friend of hers has filmed in a bar. Her boss is in court for the Marangoni case, so Sandra rushes there and presents the video. It shows Mrs Marangoni with her lover—the husband of her other client—discussing how Sandra and Max met by chance, neither of them knowing that Sandra represented Max's wife, and how they are going to use it against Max. Max ends up winning the case, and he and Sandra leave the courthouse together before parting ways, as Sandra is leaving the same evening for her new job in [[London]].  Antonio returns home, having resigned from his office, and receives a cold welcome from his wife, who disapproves of his decision. He lectures her on values in politics, and declares that he will return to his pharmacy and divorce her.  One year later, Valentina and Fabio are about to go on vacation. As Valentina enters a shop at the airport, Fabio runs into Esther, who expresses regret at leaving Fabio and suggests that they give it another try. However, Fabio tells her it is too late, as he is now very happy. Meanwhile, inside the shop, Valentina has a similar unexpected encounter with Guido, and Valentina and Fabio walk off together.  Floriana and Marco are leaving for their second honeymoon. At the airport they meet Consuelo, who reveals that she is going on honeymoon as well, having recently married Paolo.  Max, on his way to Berlin, bumps into Sandra at the airport, who is returning to London after a visit to her parents. They meet again at the security queue. Max announces that he has changed his flight and is planning to go to London with Sandra, only to learn that she had a similar idea and has booked a flight to Berlin. They spontaneously decide to rebook another time and go to [[The Bahamas]].  Antonio is enjoying the view of the sea from his favorite bench and is unexpectedly joined by Olga (whom he had told about this spot during their weekend in Vilnius). She is on her way to a G20 summit in Naples. Antonio reveals that he has resigned from politics and got divorced, while Olga is still married.

Balszack disappeared, and Cathy was supposedly briefly institutionalized.  Before the famine begins, Katie hides food in one of the gym washrooms, and while doing so is confronted by someone wearing the costume of the school mascot, a carpenter called The Nailer.

While he keeps on telling himself "in the beginning was the word", he gets to know the racketeer Mauricius (Anton Adassinsky), playing a worldly version of [[Mephistopheles]], who eventually contradicts him: "In the beginning was the deed". In spite of being amorphic, Mauricius considers himself an ''[[Übermensch]]''. Faust's obscure new friend takes him to the twilight zones of their small town.  In a bath, his attention is caught by the young Margarete (Isolda Dychauk), also known as "Gretchen". Later the two new friends are entangled in a pub brawl, Faust accidentally kills Gretchen's brother. Faust becomes obsessed with Gretchen, who appears to embody the beauty of blooming life. He indulges himself in thinking that studying her would be reasonable as a part of his research about what makes all the difference between life and death. When the aging Faust has become irreversibly infatuated with Gretchen, Mephistopheles offers him to let him have her.  Faust cannot resist the idea of spending a night with Gretchen. Yet Mauricius demands nothing less than Faust's soul in return. Faust even has to sign the contract with his own blood. Now living on borrowed time, Faust can hit on Gretchen, but he is haunted by penitence and fear.<ref name=venice /> Finally Faust cannot bear Mauricius' nihilistic comments anymore. Overwhelmed with wrath, he buries Mauricius under rocks and finds himself lost in the middle of nowhere.  
Federal Bank Heist
 In 2005, high-ranked criminal Barão ([[Milhem Cortaz]]) and his wife Carla ([[Hermila Guedes]]) are planning [[Banco Central burglary at Fortaleza|the heist that inspired the film]] - they need to dig a tunnel linking a house to the Banco Central's vault in [[Fortaleza]], where they'll steal millions of [[Brazilian real|reais]]. To accomplish their objective, they assemble a group of eight other criminals: Mineiro ([[Eriberto Leão]]), the couple's right-hand and chief of the band when Barão's not around; Doutor ([[Tonico Pereira]]), a [[communism|communist]] civil engineer; Tatu ([[Gero Camilo]]), the chief of the brickies; Caetano ([[Fábio Lago]]), Saulo ([[Créo Kellab]]), Décio ([[Juliano Cazarré]]) and Firmino ([[Cadu Fávero]]), all brickies; and Léo ([[Heitor Martinez]]), head of security and an ex-police officer, expelled due to corruption.  Before the group is assembled, Barão obtains vital security information from Moacir ([[Antônio Abujamra]]) and uses it later to plan the group's moves once inside the vault. Barão also arranges an old house as a HQ for his men and a second one under which the hole will be dug. He also settles a fake [[artificial turf]] company to cover the group's operations. Carla's [[evangelical]] brother Devanildo ([[Vinícius de Oliveira]]) later joins the group as the company's secretary. Though initially unaware of the true intentions of his colleagues, he later secretly sneaks down into the tunnel and discovers the gang's plan. He asks Barão to be allowed to leave but is forced to stay.  Alternating with these scenes, sheriff Amorim ([[Lima Duarte]]) and his assistant Telma ([[Giulia Gam]]) are show investigating the heist. They arrive at the Banco Central building and follow the tunnel back to the fake company. Amorim is also shown interrogating some members of the group that were later arrested.  Back to the time before the heist, the gang finally reaches the vault on August 6, 2005, after three months. Barão, Carla and Mineiro collect the cash and the group moves the R$164 million to their HQ, where each criminal earns R$2 million. Saulo, inspired by Doutor's communist ideals, protests against the unequal division of the money, but is shot dead by Barão. In order to bait the police away from his whereabouts, Barão has a large sum of money planted inside a car that is later loaded on a [[autorack]] headed for São Paulo. Police stop the autorack and arrest its driver, believing all the money was sent to São Paulo.  Later on, Léo is visited by his ex-colleagues from the police Robson ([[Marcello Gonçalves]]) and Vágner ([[Jorge Medina (actor)|Jorge Medina]]). They found out about his sudden enrichment and demand him to put them inside the scheme. Léo reluctantly admits he was part of the heist and agrees to sell his colleagues out. They start with Décio, whom Léo had some disagreements before the heist. Décio refuses to reveal the location of his sum and is shot dead by Léo. Some kids later sneak into Décio's yard and discover his cut buried there. Amorim arrives afterwards to investigate.  Meanwhile, Carla and Barão have an argument over whether or not they should start spending their money - Barão wants to lay low for a while until police heat is lowered. Unhappy with Barão's attitude, she decides to leave him and moves to the group's former HQ, where Mineiro now lives. Amorim pays Caetano a visit after he tries to buy a mansion with R$1 million worth of old R$50 bills - the same type of bills stolen during the heist. Caetano inadvertently reveals his connection to the heist and ends up cuffed by Amorim's men.  Devanildo reveals to his priest ([[Milton Gonçalves]]) that he earned a lot of money after working with people that "did not follow the Lord's words". The priest convinces him to donate all the money to the church, but Devanildo decides to keep a part of it for him. When returning from the church, he drops some bills and reacts strangely when a police officer picks it up for him, ending up arrested and later interrogated by Amorim. Amorim and Telma also arrest Firmino, mistaking him for Barão. Firmino initially denies his identity as Barão, but Barão's lawyer bribes him into assuming Barão's identity to lower Barão's heat.  Mineiro calls the remaining group members and arranges a meeting so they can discuss their next steps now that the gang leader is supposedly in jail. One night, Barão surprises Mineiro on his way back home and confronts him over dating his wife Carla after being informed by Martinho ([[Cássio Gabus Mendes]]), a detective he hired to keep watch of every gang member after the heist. Barão easily beats Mineiro and holds him at gunpoint, ultimately sparing him and stating that nobody will care about his death. Léo informs his police friends about the meeting and they plan to have the rest of the group taken out. However, Amorim and Telma taped Mineiro's phone and are also aware of the meeting. They assemble a group of special forces and break into the old HQ, arresting Mineiro, Léo, Tatu and Carla. Léo's police friends just watch before they can escape.  Upon interrogating Firmino, Amorim is interrupted and informed of his [[Mandatory retirement|compulsory retirement]]. Disappointed with the way crime is handled in then current times, he greets a recently promoted Telma as she announces she will take his place. Telma then escorts Carla to the back of a police SUV while Amorim watches. Barão infiltrates himself among the photographers and smiles at Carla, who smiles back at him in front of a confused Amorim.

Mary appears and throws Ahab's jar of syrup at the Fuchmanicus. Fuchman turns into a baby and is stomped to death by Chelsea.  Mary attempts to romantically reconcile with Ahab, but is rejected in favor for Chelsea (much to Mary's disgust). Chelsea declares her love for her brother, who vows never to leave her again, but the pair are separated when Chelsea's soul returns to Earth. The Devil is revealed to be God, and as she fades away John begs Chelsea to have an abortion in order to kill the potential Fuchman/product of incest growing in her womb.  Mary, Ahab and John left in hell question how they escape.

A friendly [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]], callsign Spectre 6-4, fires at the incoming waves of Russian troops in a large field outside a number of barracks.  After Spectre clears the way for the Task Force, Soap's team advances into the safehouse and kills all remaining soldiers inside. Roach plants a breaching charge on a wall, with Ghost entering the room first and killing the soldiers inside. The team enters the room after clearing it of the enemy, where there are pictures of an airport (hinting at the eventual [[Controversies surrounding Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|massacre at Zakhaev International Airport]]) and Bravo Six team. Soap and Price discover that the picture of Bravo Six team has several faces crossed out, implying each of the members have been executed. They then hear a [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] detonator beeping and escape before the blast can kill them.  The Task Force runs for a [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey|V-22 Osprey]] for exfil, while Spectre 6-4 provides covering fire for their escape. However, enemy [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] fire destroys Spectre 6-4, leaving the Task Force to fend for themselves.

As Price shouts for the Osprey to evacuate, Price is then shot and falls backward, struggling to get back up.  He pulls out his [[SIG Sauer P226]] sidearm and kills more soldiers before being shot again and overwhelmed by enemy forces.

The Flowers of War
 In 1937, Japan invades China, beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The Japanese Imperial Army overruns China's capital city, Nanking, in December and carries out the systematic and brutal [[Nanking massacre]].  As the invading Japanese overpower the Chinese army, desperate schoolgirls flee to the nominally protective walls of their [[convent]] at a Western-run [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral. Here, John Miller ([[Christian Bale|Bale]]), an American [[mortician]] on a task to bury the head priest, joins the group of innocent schoolgirls.  He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape.  After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a [[chorale]] for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the [[virgin]]al schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13.  When the [[de facto]] leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo ([[Ni Ni|Ni]]), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party. As there are only 12 prostitutes, George, the dead priest's adoptive son, volunteers as well. Miller initially opposes their self-sacrificing decision, but ultimately assists in disguising them, using his skills as a mortician to adjust their makeup and cut their hair to appear like schoolgirls. The prostitutes also create knives out of broken windows and hide them in their cloaks.  The next day, the "13 Flowers of Nanking" are led away by the unsuspecting Japanese soldiers. After they depart, Miller hides the schoolgirls on the truck he repaired and, using a single-person permit provided by the father of a schoolgirl, drives out of Nanking. In the last scene, the truck is seen driving on a deserted highway heading west, away from the advancing Japanese army. The fate of the 13 Flowers remains unknown, apparently martyring themselves for the students' freedom.

The failure brings misery and creates conflict between Andy and his brother, and between Karin and Emma. Andy refuses to face reality and struggles to keep the shop going, but he only succeeds in being left alone by everyone, specially by his girlfriend Karin and Emma who both go back to London to return to their previous job at Jimmy’s Fish shop.  However his mother - who keeps running away from him searching for her own homeland even being in Cyprus - inside her own house in Northern Cyprus which is now bought by a retired British old lady sold by his own brother behind his back.  The final blow for Andy comes when he finds that his real father was not killed during the war by the Turkish army as he was always believed but it’s Jimmy the owner of the fish shop in London.

Three years later, Boston-raised teenager Ren McCormack moves to Bomont to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins after his mother's death from [[leukemia]] and his father's abandonment. Soon after arriving, Ren befriends Willard Hewitt, a fellow senior at Bomont High, and from him learns about the ban on dancing.  He soon begins to be attracted to Shaw's rebellious daughter - Bobby's sister Ariel - who is dating dirt-track driver Chuck Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game involving buses and wins despite his inability to drive one. Shaw distrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the law and have a senior prom. After a while, Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, which results in a fight between her and Chuck. Later in church, Shaw finds out about the incident and demands Ren's arrest, Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren just like he did with Bobby. She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, which prompts Shaw to beg for her to not talk like that in church, having Ariel sarcastically ask Moore if he will pass another law, and how it didn't stop her and Chuck from having sex. Shaw slaps her without warning, which shocks Vi, Moore's wife, and prompts Ariel to tearfully and angrily criticize him for his domineering ways, and storm out of the church. Shaw tries to apologize, but Vi stops him. Being supportive of the dancing movement, Vi explains to Shaw that he is hardly being good to Ariel and that he cannot be everyone's father, adding that dancing and music are not the problems.  Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses that are given to him by Ariel, that describe how in ancient times people would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate, and/or worship. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. Despite the city council voting against him, an undaunted Ren convinces a cotton businessman in the neighboring town of Bayson to let the school have a prom in his mill due to the location being outside the city limits. Knowing that Shaw still has enough influence to pressure the parents not to let their teenagers come, Ren visits him and the two strike up a conversation. After Shaw tells the story of Bobby, Ren states that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the dance. He then asks Shaw respectfully if he can take Ariel, to which the latter agrees.  On the day of the prom, Shaw asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. Not long after Ren and Ariel arrive at the prom, Chuck and several of his friends arrive to instigate chaos. However, Ren, Willard, Rusty, and Ariel subdue them. Ren then flings confetti into a shredding machine and yells, "Let's dance!" The movie ends with everyone dancing to the opening song "Footloose".

Footnote (film)
 Eliezer Shkolnik (Shlomo Bar Aba) is a [[Philology|philologist]] who researches the different versions and phrasings of the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. He and his son Uriel ([[Lior Ashkenazi]]) are both professors at the Talmudic Research department of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].  Uriel, a charismatic academic, is extremely popular with the department's students and the general public, and is also recognized by the establishment when he is elected member of the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. The father, on the other hand, is a stubborn old-school purist in his research methods. He is unpopular, unrecognized, and frustrated by his would-be lifetime research achievement having gone unfulfilled, as a rival scholar, Prof. Yehuda Grossman ([[Micah Lewensohn]]), published similar results one month ahead of Eliezer. Eliezer is also highly critical of the new methods of research used by his son and other modern researchers, as he considers them superficial. His ambition is to be recognized by being awarded the [[Israel Prize]], but he is disappointed every year when he does not win it. His nature and the lack of recognition have made him bitter, anti-social, and envious of his son's popularity.  Eliezer receives a phone call from the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Minister of Education]]. She tells Eliezer that he was elected this year's laureate of the Israel Prize and congratulates him.  The following day Uriel is summoned to an urgent meeting with the Israel Prize committee. Uriel is told that an error had occurred and that in fact it was he, not his father, who was awarded the Israel Prize. The committee wishes to discuss ways to correct the error, but Uriel objects, saying the revelation would devastate his father. Uriel and the head of the committee, Grossman, argue over the issue until Uriel loses his temper and shoves Grossman. Regretting his outburst, Uriel relents, and asks that the committee permit him to break the news to his father personally. During the meeting Uriel says he has been submitting his father's name for the Israel Prize every year, and accuses Grossman of blocking that and other ways of recognizing Eliezer. According to Grossman, Eliezer never published anything significant in his career, and his only claim to fame is being mentioned as a footnote in the work of a more famous scholar.  Uriel goes to the National Library to break the news to his father but finds him raising a toast to winning the prize with colleagues. Unable to break the news, he once again meets with Grossman, asking that the prize be given to Eliezer. Grossman relents but with two conditions: Uriel must write the committee's recommendation and Uriel can never be a candidate for the prize. Uriel agrees.  Uriel writes the recommendation text, picking and choosing every word carefully; at the same time Eliezer, finally recognized, is interviewed by the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', during which he denounces the scientific and academic validity of Uriel's research.  When the interview is published, Uriel is angry but keeps his secret. Later, though, he whispers the secret to his mother. She does not disclose the truth to anyone else.  During preparations for a television interview, Eliezer is struck by an uncommon Talmudic expression in the Israel Prize committee's recommendation. He flees the television studio and returns to his study. He examines the expression, cross-checking its published uses, and realizes that the text must have actually been written by Uriel. Eliezer also reconstructs his phone conversation with the Minister of Education, realizing she had addressed him by his last name only. He concludes that the minister thought she was talking to his son when she broke the news about the Israel Prize.  On the day of the prize ceremony, Eliezer and his wife arrive at the [[International Convention Center (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem International Convention Center]] to prepare for the ceremony; Eliezer is stressed and distracted. The movie ends a moment before the laureates are called to the stage.

On his way home, Ed is confronted by Jerry, who claims that he has been watching Ed and has been aware of Ed watching him. Jerry soon chases Ed into a nearby pool and convinces him into believing that his life would be much better if he was a vampire. Ed succumbs and willingly allows Jerry to bite him. The next day, Charley realizes that Ed is missing and decides to investigate, starting to believe Ed's claims when he discovers video recordings of objects moving on their own, with Ed's voiceover revealing that he is recording Jerry to prove that his reflection doesn't show up in recordings. As Jerry begins to attack more people throughout the neighborhood, Charley sneaks into Jerry's house and finds out that he keeps his victims in secret rooms.

From Prada to Nada
 The film opens with [[Elinor Dashwood|Nora]] studying law and [[Marianne Dashwood|Mary]] shopping on Rodeo Drive. They head to their home, Casa Bonita, for their father's birthday. While the girls are dancing with their father, he collapses and dies.  At the funeral they meet Gabe Dominguez, an unknown half brother who resulted from an affair their father had years ago. At the reading of their father's will, they discover that they are bankrupt. Nora and Mary sell their house to Gabe, who lets them live with him and his wife, Olivia. They meet Olivia's brother, Edward, when he visits for lunch. During lunch, Olivia tells the sisters that she is moving them to the basement; refusing to be humiliated in their own home, Nora tells Mary they are moving out. Before they leave, their maid gives Nora a box left by their father.  The two sisters go to East L.A. to live with their maternal aunt, Aurelia, where they are introduced to Bruno, their aunt's neighbor. Nora opens the box and finds letters from her father to Gabe, which his mother returned unopened. Nora quits law school so she can find a job to help support herself and Mary, and tells Mary to finish college. Their aunt sells Mary's car and Prada purse as Mary's contribution to the family ('from Prada to nada'). Edward arrives and gives Mary and Nora stuff from their old home, offering Nora a job in his law office - which she declines. Nora responds to a job in the classifieds from a paper Edward gave her, and on the bus ride to work she meets a woman who has been fired from her job as a cleaning lady. Nora arrives at her new job and learns that her boss is Edward. They work together on the case for the cleaning ladies, winning a judgment when they discover that there has been a fraud with their payroll.  Mary returns to college, where she meets and flirts with rich instructor Rodrigo. She gets a ride home from him, directing him to a stranger's Beverly Hills mansion rather than her aunt's house in East L.A. They later share a kiss over lunch. After scoffing at her aunt's suggestion that she invite Rodrigo to the upcoming party at her aunt's home,  Mary approaches Bruno outside his house. She makes a deal with him that, if Bruno can make her aunt's backyard look good for a party dedicated to [[Mexican Independence Day]], he can have a dance with Mary. Mary invites Rodrigo to the party and admits to him upon arrival at her aunt's house that this is where she actually lives. After watching how Mary dances with Rodrigo, Bruno declines Mary's offer of a dance to complete the decoration agreement. Edward arrives at the party, and he and a drunk Nora kiss. When Nora becomes afraid of her feelings and that it would destroy her career, she coldly informs Edward that she is "just another girl who answered an ad in the paper" to him and drives him away. Outside, she and Bruno share a bottle of wine, sad over having to lose their chances with Mary and Edward.  When Nora receives a promotion and transfer away from Edward, she quits rather than have people believe she slept her way up. When Nora asks Mary if she loves Rodrigo, Mary tells her that she just wants to go back to Beverly Hills and that Rodrigo can make that happen. In an effort to prevent Mary from making a huge mistake,  Nora tells her that motivation makes her a whore, and Mary retorts that she would rather be that than a spinster like Nora. The sisters stop speaking to each other for a while. Nora opens a free legal aid service from her aunt's home.  Unaware of Nora's feelings for Edward, Gabe insists that Olivia send the Dominguez sisters an invitation to Edward and Olivia's best friend Lucy's engagement party at Casa Bonita. Nora is devastated that Edward is getting married, but Mary urges her to go to the party and be honest with Edward about her feelings, stating that if Edward announced an engagement so quickly "he is way more confused that you are". She offers to go with Nora for moral support and the sisters reconcile. At the party, Mary and Gabe go to their father's office, where Mary gives Gabe the letters from their father and he tearfully realises that their father wanted to be in his life. Meanwhile, Nora tells Edward she doesn't count on personal relationships due to losing both her parents and that her rejection of Edward wasn't because she didn't love him. Mary sees Rodrigo at the party with another woman who turns out to be his wife and learns that they are buying Casa Bonita. Heartbroken, Mary leaves the party and has a traffic accident after running a red light.  Gabe visits his half-sisters at the hospital and reveals, without sadness, that he and the shrewish Olivia split up. Mary returns home in a [[wheelchair]] sporting a [[neck brace]]. The next day, when she goes over to Bruno's house, Mary discovers detailed designs for the wheelchair ramp he made for her, sees that he still has the broken car mirror he replaced for her, and other signs that Bruno genuinely cares for her. Mary admits her feelings for him, and they kiss for the first time. Edward arrives with a moving truck full of new home and office furniture. He reveals that he bought the house across from her aunt and presents Nora the front door key, attached to an engagement ring. Family and friends are seen celebrating at Nora and Edward's street party wedding.  
From Up on Poppy Hill
  Umi Matsuzaki is a sixteen-year-old student attending Isogo High School living in 'Coquelicot Manor', a [[boarding house]] overlooking the [[Port of Yokohama]] in [[Japan]]. Her mother, Ryoko, is a medical professor studying abroad in the [[United States]]. Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings, Sora and Riku, and her grandmother, Hana. College student Sachiko Hirokouji, and doctor-in-training Miki Hokuto, also live there. Each morning, Umi raises a set of [[signal flags]] with the message "I pray for safe voyages".  One day, a poem about the flags being raised is published in the school newspaper. Shun Kazama, the poem's author and a member of the journalism club, witnesses the flags from sea as he rides a tugboat to school. At Isogo High, Umi meets Shun when he participates in a daredevil stunt for the newspaper, leaving Umi with a negative first impression. Umi later accompanies Sora to obtain Shun's autograph at the ''Quartier Latin'', an old and dilapidated building housing Isogo High's clubs. Umi learns that Shun publishes the school newspaper, along with Shirō Mizunuma, Isogo High's [[Student Government President|student government president]]. She ends up helping on the newspaper. Later, Shun convinces the other students to renovate the building after a debate on the future of the ''Quartier Latin'', which may be demolished. At Umi's suggestion, the female student body cooperates with the other students.  Back at 'Coquelicot Manor', Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men. One of these men is her deceased father, Yūichirō Sawamura, who was killed in the [[Korean War]]. Shun is stunned to see the photograph. At home that night, he opens a notebook to reveal he has a duplicate of Umi's photograph. He questions his father, who reveals that Yūichirō arrived at their house one evening with a young Shun, shortly after the end of [[World War II]]. The Kazamas had recently lost their infant, so they adopted Shun. Upon discovering that he is avoiding her, Umi eventually confronts Shun, who reveals they may be siblings. Having checked the city records, Shun discovers that both their names are in the Sawamura family registry. Umi is able to hide her feelings from Shun, and they continue as friends.  When the renovation of the ''Quartier Latin'' is complete, the [[Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education]] decides to proceed with the building's demolition. The students nominate Shun, Umi, and Shirō to visit Tokyo and meet with Tokumaru, a businessman and the school board's chairman. The trio travels through the city, which is in preparation for the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], and successfully convince Tokumaru to visit the ''Quartier Latin''. As Shirō leaves the group, Umi professes her love to Shun, and he reciprocates her feelings in spite of their situation.  After she returns home, Umi discovers that her mother, Ryoko, has returned. Ryoko reveals that Shun's father was Hiroshi Tachibana&nbsp;— the second man in the photograph. In 1945, Tachibana was killed in an accident on a [[History of Japanese nationality#Japanese Nationality and Repatriation after World War II|repatriation]] ship. Shun's mother died in childbirth, and his other relatives were killed in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]]. However, Ryoko was unable to raise Shun, as she was pregnant with Umi during her time as a medical student. Yūichirō [[Koseki|registered]] the child as his own to avoid leaving Shun as an orphan in the confused [[Occupied Japan|postwar years]], but Shun was eventually given to a local couple, the Kazamas. Umi, however, still has concerns.  Tokumaru visits the ''Quartier Latin'' the next day and, impressed by the students' efforts in renovating the building, he decides to cancel the demolition. Umi and Shun are soon summoned to the harbor. They meet Yoshio Onodera, now a ship's captain, who was the third man in the photograph, and the sole survivor of the three. Confirming that Umi and Shun are not related by blood, Onodera tells the full story of the three naval men in the previous era. With everything resolved, Umi returns to ''Coquelicot Manor'' and resumes her daily routine of raising the flags.  
Friends with Kids
 Jason (an advertising executive) and Julie (a charitable investment advisor), longtime best friends now in their mid-30s live in the same building in Manhattan. Not romantically involved, they are close friends with two childless married couples, the placid Alex and Leslie and the sex-obsessed Ben and Missy. During the next four years, after both couples have children, their marriages suffer. Following a chaotic birthday party for Jason at Alex and Leslie's place in Brooklyn, Jason and Julie discuss how it would be better to have children first, to 'get it out of the way' since 'time is running out', and only then meet the person that you wanted to marry.  After more discussion, they decide to have a child together, despite never having had romantic feelings for each other, and then to continue to date other people, to find 'their one'.  Although their friends predict disaster, Jason and Julie adjust to their new relationship with baby Joe far better than their friends had imagined.<ref name="thrinfo"/>  Jason and Julie begin dating again and enter into budding relationships with young actress Mary Jane and divorced father Kurt, respectively. During a couples winter getaway in Vermont, Ben calls Jason and Julie's thought process and parenting skills into question. In the ensuing argument, Ben decries their arrangement as untenable in the long term and humiliates Missy. Jason defends his decision to have a child with Julie, saying that he loves her deeply and that she was the soundest choice of person for him to start a family with.  After returning from Vermont, Ben and Missy separate and later divorce. Shortly thereafter, at Julie's birthday dinner out (about 18 months after Joe's birth), Jason is surprised to find that she invited only him. Julie tells him that Kurt wants her to meet his children that weekend but that this new degree of commitment has made her realize that she is in love with Jason, who, along with Joe, have become her closest family. A stunned Jason tells Julie that his love for her has never been romantic and has asked Mary Jane to move in with him. Heartbroken, Julie leaves the restaurant, and soon moves out of her Manhattan apartment to Brooklyn, putting some space between herself and Jason. A few months thereafter, Jason and Mary Jane break up over their differing feelings about children, and both Julie and Jason return to dating others. Several months later, at a bar with Ben, Jason confides that he does have feelings for Julie, but that their messy split makes acting on such feelings impossible. Ben disagrees, noting the differences between his and Missy's sex-based relationship and Jason and Julie's long-lasting friendship.  Shortly before Julie's next birthday, after dropping 2-1/2-year-old Joe off at Julie's house after a day out, Jason presents her with a present: a photo scrapbook of the couple, and then the three of them (that he'd made for her birthday prior, but she never received due to their abrupt parting), consistent with Julie's prior statement that Jason and Joe were her family. They reminisce over several of the photos and then put Joe to bed, after Jason says a few things about 'staying the night' (as Joe wants him to). Jason's emotional shift and words make Julie emotional and uncomfortable, so she sends Jason home. He leaves, but quickly returns, and tells her what he said to her a year ago was all wrong. He finally realized it—she is the love of his life, she is his 'person', "and that's just the way it is". She tells him she can't be with someone who isn't 'into' her, and he, after a passionate kiss, offers to have sex with her to prove he ''is'' into her, in every possible way. She accepts his offer, passionately kisses him back, and they tumble onto her bed.  
From the Rough
 Catana Starks is the coach for the women's swimming team at Tennessee State University. She meets her new boss, Kendrick Paulsen, who reveals the school is creating a men's golf team. Starks asks to be the team's coach and Paulsen agrees. However, Starks is angry when she learns Paulsen is giving the golf team very little funding, and even has to fight him just to get enough money to offer scholarships to players.  Starks attempts to recruit African-American golf players for the team, but is only able to get Craig, a talented former caddy, for the team. When she learns the school's soccer team has recruited German players, Starks goes international as well and recruits four young men from all over the world - Edward from London, Ji-Kyung (nicknamed Young Ji) from South Korea, Cameron from Australia, and Bassam from France. The team begins training and things are immediately difficult. Edward and Ji-Kyung act disrespectfully to Starks, especially after learning she has never coached a golf team before, Bassam is temperamental and has a constant bad attitude, and Craig's lack of confidence causes his game to suffer when playing in front of his teammates or a crowd. Edward develops a crush on Stacey, a medical student who is a former member of Starks's swim team.  The team play their first tournament and it is disastrous, and they come in dead last. Starks confronts the team about their poor teamwork and encourages them to give the game their all so they can win the upcoming Minority Championships, and begins helping Craig overcome his confidence issues. Stacey goes to Starks to ask for advice on her relationship with Edward, but Starks warns Stacey not to get involved with Edward. The team attends a party at a fraternity, where Stacey breaks up with Edward, who is upset to learn that Starks told her to do so. Bassam gets into a fight with two fraternity members, and as the men are leaving Cameron becomes furious that his actions could get them kicked off the team and shoves Bassam to the ground, reminding the group that golf is all they have. Paulsen meets with Starks to discuss the fight, and when Starks refuses to kick Bassam off the team without getting all the facts, Paulsen fires her due to his dislike of her constantly challenging him.  That night, Edward confronts Starks about Stacey and says she has no meaning in her life, causing her to break down in tears as she realizes just how much the team means to her. Starks speaks to each team member individually and connects with them. While speaking to Edward, she reveals that she once had a boyfriend who proposed to her just before he left to compete in a professional golf tournament, but Starks turned him down when he wanted her to choose between him or her own education and career. Starks explains she didn't want Stacey to experience the same thing. Starks invites the team to her house for dinner, where she reveals she has lost her job, but promises to help them win the championship. The team begin to bond and their performance at tournaments improves dramatically. During a meeting of the athletics board, Paulsen reveals he fired Starks, angering the rest of the members. Paulsen becomes overwhelmed with anger at getting no respect due to his wealthy upbringing, until Roger, a janitor and Paulsen's former football teammate, tells Paulsen that he needs to give respect to those who have earned it if he wants to get any respect himself.  At the Minority Championships, Craig competes in the first round and chokes after he is bullied by a member of a prestigious golf team. At dinner, Cameron accidentally eats shellfish and suffers a severe allergic reaction, meaning he cannot compete in the rest of the championship. Starks makes the four remaining team members how important it is for them to prove to the other schools that they have what it takes. The team supports Craig, and his confidence is boosted enough that he soon gets into the lead. When the rival golfer is putting, Edward distracts him using a technique he learned from Cameron, and he misses the shot. As a result, the Tennessee State University men's golf team comes in first place, impressing Paulsen enough that he agrees to let Starks keep her job and remain the coach.  
The Front Line (2011 film)
 Early in the [[Korean War]] in 1950, as the North is rolling through South Korea, South Korean Army privates Kang Eun-pyo ([[Shin Ha-kyun]]) and Kim Soo-hyeok ([[Go Soo]]) are captured in battle and brought to North Korean captain Jung-yoon. Jung-yoon declares to the prisoners that the war will be over in a week and that he knows exactly why they are fighting the war, before releasing the prisoners, so that they can help reconstruct the nation after the war.  Three years later, in 1953, the war has not ended. Despite ceasefire negotiations, the fighting continues around the hills on the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]], as each side fights to determine the future dividing line between North and South. The hills, used as bargaining chips in the negotiations, change hands constantly and so quickly that the ceasefire negotiators don't always know who controls them, yet they are coveted by both sides.  Amidst the fighting, a South Korean officer commanding 'Alligator' Company, fighting at the Aerok Hills, is found dead, killed by a Southern bullet. The now-First Lieutenant Eun-Pyo of the South Korean Army's Counterintelligence Corps (the precursor to South Korea's current [[Defense Security Command]]) is sent to investigate the murder and find an apparent mole there who had been mailing letters from Northern troops to into the South.  Eun-pyo arrives at the front lines accompanied by Captain Jae-oh, the replacement commanding officer, and new soldier Pvt. Nam Seong-shik. Eun-Pyo's perceptions change quickly upon arriving at the front. The acting commander, Captain Young-Il, though a skilled soldier, is addicted to morphine, the men actively wear captured enemy uniforms and use Communist vocabulary while talking. War orphans live among the soldiers, the discipline is lax, and the mental health of some men is questionable. Eun-Pyo's old friend Kim Soo-Hyeok reappears, now also a First Lieutenant. A far cry from the cowering incompetent Eun-pyo once knew, he has become a ruthless killer and expert platoon leader. The entire unit also seems burdened about something that happened in [[Pohang]] earlier in the war.  Their former captor, Jung-Yoon, is revealed to be commanding the North Korean forces against them; he too is severely strained by the war and is struggling to keep his similarly-battered veteran unit together. Captain Jae-oh makes a bad impression by ignoring the veteran officers' experience and makes serious tactical errors. Eun-pyo is stunned after witnessing Soo-hyeok murdering surrendered North Koreans as they do not have time to properly take them prisoner during a raid, before joining the rest of Alligator Company as they retake the hill from Northern hands. When the fighting ends, Eun-pyo discovers Seong-shik inexplicably drunk, leading him to discover Soo-Hyeok and other veteran soldiers enjoying the contents of a secret box buried within a cave in the hill that acts as a mail system and gift exchange between the opposing sides. Once a storage for the Southerners captured by the North, it was first used to trade insults, but evolved into exchanging pleasant letters and presents, with an occasional request for one side to send letters to their families in the other side; explaining the supposed 'mole' in the area. The veterans persuade Eun-pyo to keep quiet about their fraternization.  The winter turns to summer, but the fighting does not stop. During a patrol, Seong-shik is suddenly shot by "Two Seconds," a feared Communist sniper, so named due to the time between a victim being shot and the sound of the gunshot being heard. Although Eun-pyo attempts to save him, Soo-hyeok orders him to leave Seong-shik to die, baiting "Two Seconds" for an artillery strike that fails to kill the sniper. Eun-pyo attempts to hunt down "Two Seconds" alone, eventually subduing the sniper, only to find that 'he' is a female soldier named Cha Tae-kyeong, who is saddened by her having to kill Seong-shik, having recognized him over their battles and gift exchanges. He reluctantly lets her go. Eun-pyo confronts Soo-hyeok over his callousness, further inflamed when Soo-hyeok cruelly mocks one of the disabled children living in the camp, but their argument goes nowhere. Captain Young-il is wounded trying to calm a crazed veteran soldier demanding to see friends who died at Pohang. Upon Eun-pyo's questioning, Soo-hyeok reveals that the company had to abandon and kill many fellow soldiers during a rout at Pohang to save themselves, much to their shame and regret. The veteran is transferred out, doomed to a dishonorable discharge, and the orphans are evacuated as Soo-hyeok and Young-il re-install discipline and rebuild the men's will to fight.  Later, Chinese forces are deployed in human-wave tactics against the hill. During the battle, Jae-oh breaks under pressure and refuses to retreat, even as they are being overrun, over his subordinates' pleas. Soo-hyeok shoots Jae-Oh dead in front of Eun-pyo, takes command with Young-il, and leads the company to safety. Eun-pyo threatens to arrest him for Jae-oh's and the previous company commander's murders, but Soo-hyeok retorts that the two dead leaders were putting them at risk and had to be replaced for the good of the company. Soo-hyeok later falls victim to "Two Seconds," devastating Eun-Pyo and the others.  After the battle, the armistice agreement is signed, and celebrations start on both sides. North and South Korean troops encounter each other at a stream, but after a tense moment, quietly wave each other goodbye. However, the armistice will not take effect for another 12 hours. Both sides are ordered to capture and hold as much territory as possible, determining the final border between the two nations. In a savage climactic battle, everyone on both sides is killed, including Captain Young-il and Cha Tae-kyung the sniper, save for North Korean commander Jung-Yoon, albeit gravely wounded, and Eun-pyo.  The two men meet in the cave with the gift box. Eun-pyo asks Jung-yoon why exactly they are fighting. Jung-yoon replies that he knew once, but has now forgotten. They suddenly hear on the radio that the armistice has come into effect and all fighting is to cease immediately, to which they burst out laughing. They share a smoke, but Jung-Yoon succumbs to his wounds.  The film ends with a shell-shocked Eun-Pyo walking alone down the devastated, bloodsoaked hill covered by the corpses of all the fallen soldiers, leaving the ultimate fate of Aerok Hill unknown.  
Game (2011 film)
  Kabir Malhotra ([[Anupam Kher]]) is a billionaire tycoon who invites four people to his island home in Greece, by sending a different letter to each. The four people, who have never met before, are:  * Neil Menon ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), a drug lord in [[Turkey]]. He has financial problems with mob bosses that Kabir offers to help with. * Vikram Kapoor ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]), an actor with drug and career problems. Kabir writes to him that he wants to finance the biggest film ever made, and offers Vikram a role in it. * OP Ramsay ([[Boman Irani]]), a political leader in [[Thailand]]. His campaign is under threat of scandal, and Kabir offers to provide new funding to him. * Tisha Khanna ([[Shahana Goswami]]), a crime journalist in the United Kingdom who is looking for her big break. Kabir writes to her saying that he has a huge story and invites her to cover it.  The four guests arrive on the island, where they are greeted by Kabir's personal assistant Samara Shroff ([[Gauhar Khan]]) who takes them into a dining room that is being secretly filmed. There, Kabir reveals that he has invited them because of their link to his daughter, Maya ([[Sarah-Jane Dias]]), whom Kabir has spent years trying to find. Maya was trafficked as a child by OP Ramsay, as an adult brought into the crime world by Neil Menon, and in the end killed in a car accident by Vikram Kapoor. Kabir has gathered evidence against the three of them and invited the International Vigilance Squad (IVS) to the island to arrest them. Tisha Khanna, the only innocent one of the group, was invited because, previously unknown to her, she is Maya's fraternal twin sister and Kabir's only remaining biological child. Tisha rejects Kabir's attempts to forge a relationship with her, claiming that she doesn't want his fortune.  Unable to escape the island, the group await the arrival of the IVS. In the morning, they hear what sounds like a gunshot from Kabir's room. They find Kabir Malhotra dead in his study, seemingly having committed suicide with a gun.  The IVS, led by Sia Agnihotri ([[Kangana Ranaut]]), arrive on the island. She watches the video of the previous night's speech by Kabir, but as they are unable to find the evidence that Kabir claimed to have, they let the guests go. The case is declared a suicide, but Sia puts all four guests under surveillance.  Through flashback, it is revealed that Neil was in love with Maya, who saved his life during a shootout at his casino. In the present day, Neil takes revenge on OP Ramsay and Vikram for what they did to her, tricking them into giving public confessions of their crimes. Vikram commits suicide, and OP Ramsay dies of a heart attack (his medication being stolen by Neil). Sia, who has been monitoring Vikram and OP Ramsay, knows that Neil is responsible.  It is revealed that Neil is also an officer of the IVS. His real name is Major Arjun Singhania, and has been in deep cover for many years in the Turkish drug cartel. He, too, doesn't believe that Kabir committed suicide, and works together with Sia to find the true culprit. Neil noticed that Kabir was left-handed, yet the gun that killed him was in his right hand.  Tisha, as Kabir Malhotra's only child, is to inherit Kabir's fortune, but Neil and Sia receive news that Tisha attempted suicide. When Tisha wakes up, she tells them that it wasn't suicide, but someone attacked her in her house. Meanwhile, Neil has found that Kabir has a brother, Iqbal, who is next in line to inherit his fortune. Sia and Neil travel to the missionary where Iqbal lives, but they find him too ill to speak to them. A nurse tells them that Iqbal had a daughter who died, but Neil notices that there are letters sent to him dated after her supposed to death, so she must still be alive.  Neil and Sia travel back to the island, where they confront the late Kabir's personal assistant, Samara. It is revealed that Samara is Iqbal's daughter and Kabir's biological niece, though Kabir never knew. Neil realised that there was foul play when, at the missionary, he saw a picture of Kabir and Iqbal when they were children, and they were identical twins, so the man in the missionary couldn't have been Kabir's brother. Iqbal reveals himself, explaining that he's been working with Samara to get Kabir's fortune. Tisha was a surprise they hadn't anticipated, so they had to take her out of the picture. They used Kabir's three guilty guests to deflect suspicion from Samara, predicting correctly that the police would suspect one of the guests as responsible for Kabir's murder.  Iqbal attempts to kill Neil and Sia, but Neil resists, which results in Iqbal being killed and Samara arrested.  
Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos
 The movie begins with a young girl, Julia Crichton, waking up from a dream about the day her family was forcibly taken from her home by soldiers beside her older brother Ashleigh, who is currently studying their parents' alchemy books. Ashleigh then shows his sister some pages and explains that with the alchemy in the book, he hopes to make a world that no one's seen before. Soon after discovering two strange rubbed-out pages, the siblings hear some strange noises and Ashleigh goes ahead to investigate, but a worried Julia follows to a room where she finds the bodies of her parents hung up and dripping blood. She watches in horror as her brother is attacked and presumably murdered to which she faints.  Years later, a criminal breaks free from prison in Amestris, and the Elric brothers, [[Edward Elric|Edward]] and [[Alphonse Elric|Alphonse]], join the effort to recapture him. The duo confronts the escapee who proves himself a dangerous opponent able to create ice and lightning from the alchemy circles drawn in blood on the palms of his hands. Despite the Elrics' efforts to capture the criminal, he ends up escaping, and after some investigation with Edward's superior [[Roy Mustang]] and his lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, they learn that the fugitive, Melvin Voyager, escaped with only six months remaining of his five-year sentence. Among his belongings, they find a newspaper page with a piece cut off, and comparing with an intact copy of the same page, they find that the missing piece is a photo of a young woman named Julia Crichton who was arrested while entering illegally in the remote Table City, set in the border between Amestris and Creta.  Intrigued by the alchemy used by the criminal and his connection with Julia, the Elrics board a train to Table City to investigate further, but the train is attacked by an unknown individual who transforms into a wolf-chimera and takes control of the locomotive. While trying to retake the train's control from the Wolf-Chimera, flying soldiers called the Black Bats attack the train, attempting to rescue what they think are ordinary citizens, but they fall back after finding out the prisoners were Amestrians posing as prisoners as a trap. Meanwhile, Melvin finds his opportunity and escapes, followed after by the Elric Brothers. Ed and Al arrive at a prison, where Melvin destroyed the prison walls to find Julia. Melvin attempts to retrieve Julia, but is interrupted by Miranda, the leader of the Black Bats, who tries to rescue Julia as well. Ed then challenges Melvin while Alphonse goes to save Julia. She and he fall into a village in a vast chasm (The Valley) that surrounds Table City, where Melvin follows and reveals his true identity as Julia's brother, Ashleigh Crichton. Ed then ventures down to The Valley in search of Alphonse, where he learns that Table City was originally the Hill of Milos, until Creta and later Amestris invaded the city and occupied it, forcing the Milosians to live in The Valley, in poverty.  Inside the Black Bats' secret base, Julia and Alphonse develop a friendship while Julia learns about Al and Ed's tragic past of human transmutation. Later, when Ed meets up with Al in the Black Bats base, they find themselves hunted down by wolf chimeras from the Cretan secret police dispatched by Colonel Herschel, the Cretan commander of the area, prompting them to retreat further. They and the Elrics arrive in a room with maps and locations of Table City, where Miranda explains to the Elrics their mission: to reclaim Milos by using the Sanguine Star to control a powerful heat source called Magma. Miranda also explains that the Sanguine Star was a 'red glowing stone of power'. Shocked by the description, the Elrics reveal that the Star might be a Philosopher's Stone, which requires human sacrifice to create. Though shocked at the revelation, Julia is determined to do anything to secure the Milosians' freedom, and Ashleigh agrees to help her.  Wanting to avoid a bloody war, Ed and Al return to Table City in an attempt to find the Star and destroy it. Later that night, the Black Bats begin their assault on Table City. Miranda, Ashley, and Julia then venture to the main tower, where, suddenly, Ashleigh fatally injures Miranda and explains to Julia that the use of Miranda's blood activates a three dimensional transmutation circle drawn in blood to create the Sanguine Star. Julia then realizes that he is an impostor, Security Chief Atlas, who was enveloped by alchemy's potential of creation and power and killed Julia's parents for it. He explains that he tore off the real Ashleigh's face and the skin from his lower left side to deceive Julia and create the Star. Ed and Al arrive to rescue Julia and confront Atlas, who escapes to the location of the Star. As Ed, Al, and Julia chase after Atlas, Herschel detonates a Cretan thermal power plant, pouring out a massive amount of lava towards the Valley. Al goes to help save the valley while Ed and Julia go after Atlas. Atlas nearly attempts to retrieve the Star, only to be confronted by Ed and Julia. Julia retrieves the star and decides to save the Valley by swallowing it to use its power.  Meanwhile, Alphonse's attempt to stop the lava are futile until Julia arrives to help him stop the lava. Atlas arrives to take back the Star, only to be confronted by Colonel Herschel, who reveals himself to be the real Ashleigh Crichton. He survived by swallowing a Star and using its power to heal his wounds. Ashleigh then kills Atlas in revenge for the death of his parents. Confirming his identity to Julia while apologizing for leaving her alone for so long to keep her safe from Atlas, Ashleigh tells Julia to come with him to Creta so they can make a world that no one had ever seen before. Julia refuses and decides to fight her brother, with Ed and Mustang arriving to provide assistance. Julia ends the fight by destroying one of Ashleigh's arms. Then, together with Ed and Al, she manages to stop the flow of magma into the Valley. With the Valley safe, Julia uses the rest of her power to heal Ashleigh, restoring his face and saving his life. However, both Ashleigh and Julia's Stars disintegrate, and Julia sacrifices her left leg and glimpses the Gate of Truth. Meanwhile, on the Cretan side of the border, Milosian resistance fighters seize Creta's main base and declare independence. Without Colonel Herschel to lead them, the Cretan forces retreat.  The next morning, Ashleigh wakes up in a hospital bed alongside Julia and is surprised to find his face restored. When Julia wakes up, she is informed that Ashleigh had already left, and is given an automail leg. She then meets Ed and Al as they prepare to leave Table City. Ed chastises Julia, saying that her decision to use the Star was wrong, but he doesn't think she's a bad person. Al promises to Julia that after he and his brother get their bodies back, they will be sure to visit. Julia tells them she will be waiting, as she must stay to lead the Milosians and preserve their newfound independence. Meanwhile, Ashleigh is seen donning his Cretan uniform and returning to Creta. Ed and Al then board a train to Central and take one last look at Table City before leaving.

Funkytown (film)
 Set in [[Montreal]] during the [[disco]] era, the film revolves around the Starlight, a fictionalized version of Montreal's famed Lime Light [[discothèque]]. It depicts this world starting in 1976, when Montreal was considered one of the world's top [[nightclub]] destinations, through to 1980, when the fashion for disco was about to experience a sharp decline.

Professor sent his assistant to find one.  The next day, Stefan and Zenek attacked Jerzy and his lover Yola, but they were defeated. They were approached by the assistant, who offered them a job. He took them to the Professor's lab and told them to acquire Jerzy's DNA, then kill him. They secured the DNA and created a clone, but Jerzy survived. The assistant explained that from their analysis it seemed Jerzy had the full potential to become a pop star, but there was a problem: he couldn't be contained.  Jerzy met up with Yola, but the clone appeared and assaulted Yola. She became angry and left. As Jerzy tried to explain, he's captured by the assistant, who had mistaken him for the clone. He escaped, but he was seen by Stefan and Zenek, who collided with the clone and beat him, before being stopped by Yola. She drove the clone home, thinking he's the original Jerzy. However, as the clone abused her again, she threw him out of the taxi and drove home.  The true Jerzy was waiting there, but Yola didn't listen to him. Zenek asked Jerzy to meet under the Poniatowskiego bridge by pretending to be Yola. There, Jerzy was knocked unconscious and thrown into the river. He was eventually rescued by the prostitute Lilka.  The clone became an international celebrity. Yola wanted to come to terms with Jerzy. She met Lilka, who started to suspect the truth. Jerzy decided to regain his good name. He broke into a concert where the clone was performing and revealed the truth. A fight ensued, and a beam fell and crushed the clone.

Generation P (film)
 "Generation P" follows the strange adventures of Babylen Tatarsky as he evolves from a disillusioned young man in the drab days of post-[[communism|communist]] [[Moscow]] to the chief “creative” behind the virtual world of [[Government of Russia|Russian politics]].  When Babylen was a [[Young Pioneer]], his generation received a gift from the decaying [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] state in the form of a bottle of [[Pepsi]], of Russian manufacture. Not just a beverage, it was also a symbol of hope that some day a new, magical life would arrive from the other side of the ocean. The arrival of this life, and the way it transformed these ex-Pioneers, is what the film is about. In the early Nineties, Tatarsky, a frustrated poet, takes a job as an advertising copywriter, and discovers a knack for putting a distinctively Russian twist on Western-style ads. But the deeper Tatarsky sinks into the advertising world, the more he wonders if he has sacrificed too much for money. His soaring success leads him into a surreal world of [[spin doctor]]s, gangsters, [[drug]] trips, and the spirit of [[Che Guevara]] who, via a [[Ouija Board]], imparts to him the dazzling theory of WOWism, about how television destroys the individual spirit. Though named in honor of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], Babylen opts instead to believe in his “[[Babylon]]ian” destiny, and secretly searches for the beautiful goddess [[Ishtar]], who becomes for him a symbol of fortune. Meanwhile, the people around Babylen - clients, colleagues - perish in the violent dog-eat-dog world of new Russian capitalism. In Nineties Moscow, this is taken as the ordinary course of daily affairs. Tatarsky is invited to join an all-powerful PR firm run by a cynically ruthless advertising genius, Leonid Azadovsky, who invites Tatarsky to participate in a secret process of rigged elections and false political advertising. And as a result of his brilliance, Tatarsky achieves the ultimate, as he creates and gets elected a "virtual" president. But like Faust selling his soul to the devil, this ex-humanist gradually descends to the level of a reprobate, finding that he no longer belongs to himself, but is trapped in a virtual world of his own creation. Babylen returns to his [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] friend Gireyev and takes [[hallucinogen]]ic [[mushroom]]s, in attempt to re-create his previous experience. In a ritualistic Sumerian initiation, Babylen replaces Azadovsky as head of the Agency and becomes the earthly husband of Goddess Ishtar, the object of his obsession. There, he is offered control of the mechanism that produces “simple human happiness” - and can control the world.

Genji Monogatari: Sennen no Nazo
 "Why did Murasaki Shikibu write ''The Tale of Genji''?" is the core concept behind ''Genji Monogatari: Sennen no Nazo''. Throughout the film scenes from both Hikaru Genji no Monogatari (光源氏の物語　Hikaru Genji's story) and [[Murasaki Shikibu|Shikibu]] no [[Monogatari]] (式部の物語　Shikibu's story) are intertwined together. The film Speculates as to why Murasaki wrote ''The Tale of Genji''.  The story begins with [[Murasaki Shikibu]] obtaining instructions from [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] to write a tale in which would educate his daughter, Fujiwara no Sōshi, so that his ‘blood’ may enter the bloodline of the Emperor’s. Murasaki then begins to write The Tale of Genji and reads it out to Michinaga, Sōshi, and others.  With Murasaki narrating the story, we learn about Genji’s past, from his mother, [[Kiritsubo Consort]], to his coming-of-age and his looks charming those at court. Genji was unable to become the crown prince due to the lack of support from the court, but was allowed to live in the inner court. He is then married to the daughter of the Minister of the Left, [[Aoi no Ue]], who does not open up to Genji so easily.  Genji then has an affair with [[Lady Rokujo]] and Yugao. Lady Rokujo was still mourning the loss of her husband, but Genji expressed his affection and wooed her. Lady Rokujo being a woman of pride and jealously, is deeply hurt by Genji’s relationship with Yugao and Rokujo’s spirit ended up killing Yugao. Rokujo’s spirit returns later on to also kill Aoi.  During Aoi’s pregnancy the world of Genji and reality merges as [[Abe no Seimei]] enters The Tale of Genji in order to prevent Rokujou from killing Aoi while she was giving birth. Here Seimei warns Michinaga that Murasaki’s wickedness will come alive and harm them, which is not the first time Seimei has mentioned to Michinaga about this ‘wickedness’ in Murasaki. Michinaga responds with the simple statement that he was the one that started her ability to write such a tale, therefore he must take responsibility for it. Despite Seimei’s efforts to save Aoi from Rokujo’s spirit, Aoi is still killed by the spirit.  Genji, having a long time love for [[Lady Fujitsubo]] had an affair with her in which led to her being pregnant with his child. Emperor Kiritsubo comments on Fujitsubo’s pregnancy calling her his light (hikaru), which is ironic as it is also Genji's name. Upon the birth of the child, the Emperor also mentions how the baby has a strange resemblance to when Genji was an infant. Not too long afterwards, the Emperor passes away, noting to Genji that if Genji were appointed as his successor as he wanted, then both of them wouldn't have had to suffer. All these facts adds up to the belief that the child that Fujitsubo gave birth to is not the Emperor's, but Genji's.  Upon the deaths of Yugao and Aoi, Rokujo tells Genji that she will leave in order to protect him because if she were to stay he would just continue to suffer. Respectively, Murasaki also informs Michinaga of her departure in which Seimei states, "She withdrew herself before her soul turned evil."  In the last scene we find Genji and Murasaki crossing paths. He confronts her, asking: "When will you stop torturing me?" In response Murasaki answers that his happiness is not possible and continues on her way.  This rendition of the story focuses greatly on the possibility that Murasaki wrote ''The Tale of Genji'' as an outlet for her extreme feelings and desires for Michinaga. As Michinaga mentions when Murasaki declines his invitation, what will win? Desires or the mind?

Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver
 At the Scientific Research Institute for the study of Homicidal Baked Goods, The Gingerdead Man is visited by a woman from the FBI (Laura Kachergus), who is revealed to be the sister of Toothless McHomeless of [[Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust|the second one]], who was driven to suicide by the previous Gingerdead cookie. As she's about to take her revenge on this "half baked piece of shit", a group of activists for [[animal rights]] break into the institute, overpower her, and release the Gingerdead Man and the rest of the baked inmates. The killer cookie comes across the "Time Travel Studies" room, shoots the two scientists, and is sent back through time as security tries to kill him.  He is sent back to a Roller Disco Beauty Pageant in 1976, and can not get the remote to work to get him out. He then goes on a massive killing spree, killing three car washing bimbos (Jonona Amor, Elizabeth Bell, Junie Hoang) by hooking up the hose with [[hydrochloric acid]], melting all three of them. He heads back inside, and when he tries to get one of the employees, Ingrid Harshman (Muffy Bolding) to suck his through a [[glory hole (sexual slang)|glory hole]], spoofing shower room scene, with  Beulah Balbricker, from the 1982 [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian]] film, ''[[Porky's]]'', she rips it off and eats it. He continues on and discovers the Club's ugly janitor having a threesome with two drugged teens (Jacqui Holland, Jonny J.) and kills them by piercing them with a nail gun. He then kills one of the Clerks (Travis Walck) with a meat cleaver, and mixes up the DJ ([[Selene Luna]])'s cocaine with cleaning product. Meanwhile, two kids, Pickles (Zachery Haas) and Tina (Alexis Marie Colcord) discover the remote, manage to get it working, and they are sent traveling through time.  Meanwhile, the club's owner ([[Jackie Beat]]) has to close it down due to taxes, and invites her odd niece (Paris Wagner), who possesses the power of [[telekinesis]], to help her pack up her office. While there, she meets one of the clerks (Steve-Michael McLure) and skates with him, and is recognized as one of the best skaters at the club, to the dismay of both the aunt, who because of her skating talent, caused the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and the four-year winning champion (Kimberly Pfeffer). When she discovers she'll lose the vote, she has her boyfriend (Justin Schwan) set up a bucket of pig blood to fall on the niece's head during the ceremony, spoofing the 1976 [[Sissy Spacek]] film, ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]].'' The Gingerdead Man messes up the prank and the bucket falls on her instead. The cookie then kills her and her boyfriend in front of everyone with a meat cleaver, and shoots three people (Tiffany Danielle, Stephanie Phrommany, Jean Louise O'Sullivan) dead. When the cookie shoots the owner in the shoulder, the niece freaks out, locks everyone in the club and electrocutes them all, killing everyone except herself, her aunt, the clerk and Ingrid.  As the cookie's about to finish them off, Pickles and Tina return from time-traveling with the FBI Agent and Security, along with [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Charles Manson]], [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], and [[Lizzie Borden]]. All six time travelers overpower the cookie, and shove him into a cookie jar, killing him. Pickles and Tina reveal to the aunt the winning numbers for the lottery, which is enough to keep the club up and running. Pickles and Tina also reveal that because they warned the FBI Agent about the attack on the Institute, the events of the entire film never happened. Everyone who has died comes back to life, and the time travelers go back to their own time period, including the aunt, who goes back in time to prevent herself from causing Pearl Harbor.  
Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance
  In [[Romania]], a French priest named Moreau warns the monks of a monastery about an impending attack by the devil's forces to obtain a boy named Danny. The monastery falls under attack; Moreau tries to help the boy and his mother Nadya escape, but the distrusting mother shoots at Moreau and flees with her son. Moreau manages to distract the men chasing Danny and Nadya, but nearly dies in the process and loses them. He believes that only the Ghost Rider is capable of protecting the boy. He finds the Rider and seeks his help.  Eight years have passed since [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] became the [[Ghost Rider]] – a [[Vengeful ghost|vengeful, fiery spirit]] who feeds on the evil of his victims and consumes the souls of sinners. No matter how big or small the infraction — anything from [[genocide]] to a [[white lie]] — the Rider does not differentiate. This drives Blaze into hiding, fighting the evil spirit within him. Moreau finds him and convinces him to save the boy in exchange for his priesthood's ability to restore Johnny's soul and remove the Ghost Rider's curse. Meanwhile, pursuers force Nadya and Danny from the road and bring them to their leader: her former boyfriend Ray Carrigan. Carrigan has Danny tied up and is about to execute Nadya when the Ghost Rider appears; the Ghost Rider kills several of Carrigan's men and then moves in on Danny. Nadya distracts the Ghost Rider, who then is shot with grenades into submission.  Johnny awakens in a hospital. On the way out, he convinces Nadya not to trust him, but to accept his help to find Danny. Carrigan tells [[Mephisto (comics)|Roarke]] about the Rider, and Roarke speaks an incantation to Danny via phone, which effectively puts up a "firewall" preventing the Rider from sensing Danny's whereabouts. He warns Carrigan it will not shield him from being sensed and gives him instructions to deliver Danny. Nadya later tells Blaze that as she lay dying, she made a deal with Roarke: her life in return for him impregnating her with Danny, making Danny a direct vessel for Roarke and the potential for him to have unlimited power on the surface world. Roarke lacks this power so far from [[Hell]]. Danny nearly escapes, but breaks his ankle and is recaptured. That night, Nadya and Johnny interrogate a known contact of Carrigan's. Johnny takes off ahead of Nadya to deal with Carrigan. Nadya saves Danny as the Rider converts a mining machine (a [[Bagger 288]]<ref name=InterviewNeveldineTaylor></ref>) into a massive fiery machine, destroying their hideout complex and mortally wounding Carrigan. When Ghost Rider catches up to Nadya and starts to use his Penance Stare on her, Danny is able to stop the Rider with a word, exercising his hidden power. [[File:Bagger-garzweiler.jpg|thumb|290px| A special prop: The [[Bagger 288]], the heaviest land vehicle in the world from 1978–1995]]  Moreau catches up with the group as they ride off. Roarke is not done with Carrigan; using his power, he turns Carrigan into a demon called [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] capable of instantly decaying anything he touches while shrouded in darkness. Johnny and Nadya bring Danny to Moreau's monastery with warm reception. Moreau explains that the Ghost Rider is the twisted incarnation of the Spirit of Justice, [[Zarathos]], after being captured and tortured to madness while in Hell. Moreau tells Johnny that he can exorcise the spirit from him if Johnny tells a secret that only he knows of. Johnny confesses that his deal with Roarke was really a selfish one: his stepfather had accepted his [[cancer]] and was ready to die; Johnny was the one who did not want him to go. With this confession, Moreau exorcises Johnny of the spirit and Johnny becomes human again. The head monk Methodius proclaims that Danny will never be safe from the influence of evil and says he must die, taking Johnny, Moreau, and Nadya captive in order to execute the boy. Carrigan intervenes, killing the monks and taking Danny captive again to deliver to Roarke. The others follow, with Johnny not wanting to desert Danny after having promised to protect him. With the ritual to transfer Roarke's spirit and power into Danny underway, the three infiltrate the compound to save him. Carrigan kills Moreau, but Danny (who Roarke states has the same powers as he does) gives Johnny back the power of the Ghost Rider. Roarke manages to escape with Danny and the Ghost Rider and Nadya give pursuit. After a vehicular struggle, Ghost Rider manages to defeat Carrigan and causes the SUV carrying Roarke and Danny to crash. The Ghost Rider sends Roarke back into Hell while Danny, who had died in the accident, is returned to his mother. Channeling the blue flame of Zarathos, Johnny manages to revive Danny and assures him of his safety.  As the film closes, the angelic blue flaming Ghost Rider rides off on his motorcycle, saying: "My name is Johnny Blaze. I'm the Ghost Rider."

Actually, the truck had teapots, and a blue teapot fell out.

He and Featherstone eventually reaches the park where Gnomeo climbs onto a statue of [[William Shakespeare]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and tells him his story. Shakespeare tells Gnomeo that his story is very [[Romeo and Juliet|similar to his own writing, of Romeo and Juliet,]] and that it is likely Gnomeo's will have a sad ending as well, the same ending as Romeo and Juliet, where the two lovers die.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011 film)
 In [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], divorced journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]] ([[Daniel Craig]]), co-owner of ''Millennium'' magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström ([[Ulf Friberg]]) . [[Lisbeth Salander]] ([[Rooney Mara]]), a brilliant but troubled investigator and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger ([[Christopher Plummer]]), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to move to the Hedestad and investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago, to the disappointment of Blomkvist's long-term lover and business partner Erika Berger ([[Robin Wright]]) who wants him to stay in Stockholm. After moving to the Vanger family's estate, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.  Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman ([[Yorick van Wageningen]]) in control of her finances, after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a [[stroke]]. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing she is secretly recording the assault with a camera on her bag. At their next meeting, Salander exacts revenge by incapacitating Bjurman with a [[taser]], binding him to the legs of a bed, [[rape|raping]] him with a [[dildo]], and then [[tattoo]]ing a statement on his chest permanently marking him as a rapist. She coerces him into using his authority to have her incompetency diagnosis invalidated and leave her in control of her finances, threatening to upload the video of his assault to the Internet if he fails or refuses.  Blomkvist's daughter Pernilla ([[Josefin Asplund]]) visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode ([[Steven Berkoff]]), that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through to 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of a cat he'd been tending to and one night while walking, he is shot at and narrowly escapes. While Salander tends to his injuries, they have sex and become lovers. Henrik's openly [[national socialist]] brother Harald identifies Martin ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.  Blomkvist breaks into Martin's house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV. He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12 which led to her being under state care.  Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita ([[Joely Richardson]]) probably knows where she is. They travel to London where Anita has been living since leaving Sweden and he and Salander monitor her, waiting for her to contact Harriet. When nothing happens, Blomkvist confronts her, deducing that the woman posing as Anita is Harriet herself. She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years, and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity when she moved to London. Finally free of her brother Martin, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.  As promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerström, but it proves worthless. Salander hacks into Wennerström's computer and presents Blomkvist with evidence of Wennerström's crimes. Blomkvist publishes an article that ruins Wennerström, who flees the country. Salander hacks into Wennerström's bank accounts and, travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts. Wennerström is found murdered. Salander reveals to her former guardian Holger Palmgren that she has made a friend (Blomkvist) and is happy. On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him together with Erika, though he had said he was going to see his daughter that evening. Heartbroken, Salander discards the gift and rides away.

Golconda High School
 Golconda High School's Board’s Trustees' member Kireet Das comes up with a proposal of turning the  cricket playground into an IIT coaching center. Principal K.Viswanath opposes that proposal vehemently with the support of few trustees. Kireet then tells the principal to show positive results in at least one sport if he wants to hold on to the playground. Viswanath comes up with a proposal that the playground should be retained if GHS’s cricket team manages to win the State level cricket league tournament. He summons his former GHS student, Sampath, an idealist who leads a dejected life. Sampath, after confronting Kireet, joins GHS as the cricket coach and he has three months to convert the disoriented GHS cricket team of 14 students into champions.  Led by Siddanth and their lack of discipline, the team initially resists Sampath's training. Despite trying to get under Sampath's skin, they fail to persuade their coach to change his methods. Frustrated, Siddanth challenges Sampath to a students vs. teachers cricket game—the deal being that if the students win, they will not follow Sampath's coaching anymore. Towards the end of the game, the frustrated Siddanth deserts his losing team. Gowtham subsequently takes over captaincy and the students manage to tie the game when Sampath purposely gets bowled out in the last over. The students get very impressed with Sampath's cricketing prowess and decide to follow his coaching despite Siddanth's opposition.  Later, after Sampath helps remove a police case against another student, Mikey, they realize his compassionate nature and embrace his coaching entirely. Siddanth too follow suit. The GHS team, after coming to know of the deal between Kireet and Viswanath over the cricket ground, get further motivated and raise their efforts towards winning every match. The team advance to the finals of the championship—the final match being against the very strong Everglades team. Right before the finals, the GHS boys come to know that the Everglades coach Sundar and Sampath share some bad blood from the past.  When Sampath refuses to reveal his personal history with Sundar, they start doubting Sampath and lose focus, letting their opponents amass over 190 runs in 20 overs.  During the break, Viswanath, coming to know of the misunderstanding between coach and team, tells the boys  exactly what had happened between Sampath and Sundar almost 15 years ago—Sundar, also an ex GHS student Sundar purposely got Sampath run out during the final championship match, where latter had played brilliantly. To attain personal glory, Sundar went on to black list Sampath, depriving him of any future in cricket.  The team, upon realising the truth, apologise to Sampath for misunderstanding him. Sampath motivates them with a stirring speech subsequently. GHS comes onto field with 10 batsmen as Siddanth suffers an injury during fielding. They virtually chase down the big score and the match is tantalizingly poised in the last over. Siddhanth, to the surprise of everyone, unexpectedly comes back from injury and wins the game for GHS on the last ball.  Golconda High School wins the championship for the first time in 15 years, and the cricket ground is saved.

Afterwards, Navi investigates the scene and finds the Gosei Knight key which Alata dropped.  As this all happened, after selling off some of his [[anpan]] at an elementary school and meeting a child with a well preserved [[Denshi Sentai Denziman#Mecha|DaiDenzin]] toy, [[Denshi Sentai Denziman#Denziman|Daigoro Oume]] makes his way to the next school before meeting [[Dairangers#Ryo|Ryo of the Heavenly Fire Star]] as he saves a salaryman from being unintentionally run over by [[Special Police Dekaranger#Umeko|S.P.D. Officer Koume "Umeko" Kodou]]. The three soon learn that the salaryman lost his job and his inability to sell off a toy replica of the [[Himitsu Sentai Gorenger#Mecha|Variblune]] made him consider suicide on the street. The heroes, however, encourage him not to lose hope as Ryo offers him a serving of his [[Jiaozi#Japanese version|gyōza]]. The three Sentai warriors, along with their various allies, witness the Black Cross King appearing in the sky as he announces that he has their powers and will soon acquire the powers of the Gokaigers and Goseigers before enacting his revenge.  Finding themselves in an office building, Marvelous and Alata find themselves needing to defeat Brajira while dealing with his Bibi Soldiers in order to return to their space. Doc, Ahim, Eri and Hyde have their trouble with Dagon and his Zobils while Joe, Luka, Agri and Moune contend with Yogoshimacritein and his Ugatz in a [[Feudal Japan]] movie set within a thirty-minute timeline. Despite their differences, the Gokaigers and Goseigers find common ground with each other and manage to defeat the three resurrected villains and return to their space where are welcomed back by Navi and a restored Gosei Knight. Deciding to accept a team up with the Gosei Angels, Captain Marvelous and his crew face the Black Cross King as he has them fight the animated Ranger Keys. After a grueling battle, the Gokaigers and Super Goseigers manage to revert their numerous opponents back into Ranger Keys. Upset by the turn of events, yet taking advantage of their weakened state, the Black Cross King assumes his full size to finish the two Sentai teams off himself. However, the Ranger Keys suddenly glow and enveloped the Super Sentai groups in a bright light.  The two teams find themselves surrounded by the Ranger Keys as they are spoken to in spirit by Tsuyoshi Kaijo, Sokichi Banba, [[Dai Sentai Goggle-V#Goggle-V|Kanpei Kuroda]], [[Kagaku Sentai Dynaman#Dynamen|Rei Tachibana]], [[Choudenshi Bioman#Biomen|Shirō Gō]] and [[Kousoku Sentai Turboranger#Turborangers|Riki Honoo]], who see the two teams holding the morals and values they themselves strive for. As they, Daigoro, Ryo, Umeko, [[Boukengers|Satoru Akashi]], [[Shinkengers|Chiaki Tani]], [[Shinkengers|Genta Umemori]] and [[Go-ongers|Saki Rōyama]] agree to letting him and his crew have their teams' Great Powers, Captain Marvelous demands all their aid. Answering his call, the Ranger Keys create the Super Sentai Bazooka which the Gokaigers and the Goseigers use to destroy the Black Cross King before the Ranger Keys fly back into the Gokai Treanger Box. The Black Cross King, however, reveals his true form as the Black Cross Colossus while proceeding to wreak havoc on Tokyo. Gokaioh, Gosei Great and Gosei Ground attempt to stop him, but they are overwhelmed by his attacks with Gosei Knight taken out of the fight. [[Goseigers#Nozomu Amachi|Nozomu Amachi]] and the salaryman, remembering the sentai heroes' words, urge the citizens not to lose hope and cheer for the two Super Sentai groups. This support restores Gokaioh and Gosei Great as they are joined by the main giant robots of the other 33 groups animated from various items including the salaryman's Variblune and a schoolboy's [[Denshi Sentai Denziman#Mecha|Daidenzin]] toy, as Gosei Knight proclaims it as "the greatest miracle in Earth's history".  Though the Black Cross Colossus attempts to counter with Brajira and his Buredoran incarnations, Dagon with fellow Hades Gods Cyclops and Ifrit, and Yogoshimacritein with two of his followers, they are all destroyed by the Sentai mecha. With the Great Power of the Gorengers, the Gokaigers have Gokaioh combine with Variblune to form Goren Gokaioh before executing the Gokai Hurricane Cassiopeia to destroy the Black Cross Colossus once and for all. With the battle over, the 33 past Super Sentai mecha vanish as the crowd thanks the Gokaigers and Goseigers for saving the day. Later, the Gosei Angels give the Goseiger Keys back to the Gokai Galleon crew while hoping the pirates would begin to love their planet while giving them their Great Power. As the Gokai Galleon sails off for another adventure, its departure is watched by [[Gokaigers#Gai Ikari|Gokai Silver]].  
God Bless America (film)
 Frank Murdoch ([[Joel Murray]]) is a middle-aged insurance salesman living in [[Syracuse, New York]], who is sick with how the United States has fallen into a state of rudeness based on [[Popular culture|pop culture]], [[talk radio]], television, and Internet influences. After a boring evening of watching television, Frank visualizes killing his loud and inconsiderate neighbors, whose baby's screams exacerbate his chronic migraine headaches and rob him of sleep. His ex-wife Alison ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]) has custody of their daughter Ava ([[Mackenzie Brooke Smith]]), who has become a typical spoiled brat. Matters come to a head when he is fired after 11 years' service at the insurance company for obtaining a female co-worker's address without authority merely to send her roses to lift her spirits; then told by his profane and uninterested doctor that he has an inoperable, terminal brain tumor.  Frank prepares to commit suicide but stops as his TV features a reality show starring Chloe ([[Maddie Hasson]]), an extremely spoiled teenager, and has an epiphany. The next day, he steals his noisy neighbor's car and drives to Chloe's school and, after unsuccessfully attempting to blow her up in her car, he shoots her at point-blank range. One of Chloe's classmates, Roxanne "Roxy" Harmon ([[Tara Lynne Barr]]), witnesses this and applauds him. Roxy follows Frank back to his motel where he is once again preparing to commit suicide; initially egging him on, Roxy then talks him out of it. Frank explains to Roxy that he only wants bad people to die – people who have committed blatant acts of cruelty and stupidity against their fellow man.  Roxy suggests they kill Chloe's parents and he agrees. Frank shoots Chloe's father ([[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]]) and, after a brief chase, Roxy stabs her mother (Dorie Barton). Roxy convinces Frank to take her along by painting herself the tragic victim of her drug-addicted mother and rapist step-father. They then decide to go on the lam, continuing their killing spree. They visit a movie theatre to watch a documentary about the 1968 [[My Lai Massacre]]. During the film, several teenagers enter the nearly empty theatre and immediately act obnoxiously, talking aloud and on their cell phones. One of them throws popcorn at Frank. Frank and Roxy shoot and kill all but the least aggravating of them, whom Frank thanks for not being rude. Subsequently, they kill several others, including a rude man who double-parks his car, several far-right religious protesters and Michael Fuller ([[Regan Burns]]), a popular, abrasive [[Conservatism|conservative]] political television commentator.  During an evening while they're lying low, Roxy suggests to Frank that they move to [[France]] and 'go legit', to raise goats and make cheese, and avoid prosecution for the murders they've committed.  Returning a phone message from his doctor, Frank learns there was a mix-up with his [[MRI]] results (the image was of another patient named Frank) and that he has no tumor and probably just suffers from any one of a number of relatively inconsequential ailments. Frank's new lease on life is spoiled when, while eating breakfast in the motel diner with Roxy and discussing their travel-to-France plans, a leering redneck at the next table labels Roxy an underage prostitute and Frank her pimp. The same day, Frank sees a TV news missing person report in which Roxy's parents (Andrea Harper and [[David Mendenhall]]) appear wholesome and concerned, a far cry from her description. Incensed at the deception, Frank takes out his anger on the leering diner, garroting him in his room. Frank takes the man's pickup truck and, as he is leaving, tells Roxy he knows the truth. She confesses but says she had to get away from a life of bland conformity and experience something 'un-normal'. Frank leaves her the stolen car and they split up.  Frank buys an [[AK-47]] assault rifle from an illegal arms dealer (Mike Tristano) and makes his way to Los Angeles. Frank sees another TV news report that shows Roxy back home with her elated parents and that he is wanted for abducting her. Unbeknownst to him, Roxy is ''not'' happy to be back home. Frank gains access into the ''American Superstarz'' studio, kills several audience members and one judge, and holds the other judges, contestants, and the audience hostage. As the [[SWAT]] team arrives, Roxy also appears and joins Frank on stage, apologizing for lying to him. Frank makes a brutally honest speech in front of the TV camera about the ridiculousness and selfishness that is promoted in today's American society and on television. Frank then tells Roxy she is a pretty girl, and they proceed to shoot the judges, contestants and several members of the audience before being gunned down by the police.

Nick helps Adam land a job with Jet Set Productions, a company that produces [[gay pornography]].  He is offered extra money to appear in the company's videos, but insists that he only wants to work behind the camera. However, Adam starts to struggle financially when Frank breaks up with Candy. Nick, who is now dating Adam, convinces him to appear in a solo [[masturbation]] video under the name "Andrew" in order to help pay his rent. After making more videos, his boss Ron tells him about his escort business where he pairs actors with high-profile clients.  Through his work, Adam is introduced to John, a successful actor from the popular television sitcom ''Life Lessons''. The two start to see each other regularly, and John offers Adam a job as his assistant, which he happily takes. He later encounters Nick, who begs for money after his addiction to meth caused him to lose his job. He also apologizes for how he treated Adam, and leaves.  Sometime later, Adam is then put into the public eye when his porn star career is exposed in several tabloids. While John later explains to him that he knows Adam would not tell anyone about their relationship, he can't risk losing his career by being associated with him. While Candy wants Adam to take advantage of his new found fame since John fired him, he says he could never hurt John. Adam then almost dies when he mixes alcohol and pills.  While in the hospital, John calls Adam to see if they can meet up without knowing about his accident. Adam then tells John that while he loves him, he can't go back to keeping their relationship a secret. Adam decides to move to Miami and figure out what he wants to do. While packing, John shows up at the apartment and says he wants Adam back into his life.

Martin becomes panicked and visibly anxious during the questioning, eventually locking himself in the bathroom and attempting to flush the diary down the toilet.

Grave Encounters
 Jerry Hartfield, the producer of ''Grave Encounters'', a famous [[ghost hunting|ghost investigation]] television series, explains that ''Grave Encounters'' was cancelled in 2003 after the fifth episode, when the cast and crew, along with the footage for episode six, mysteriously went missing. The footage was finally recovered in 2010 and brought to Hartfield. In it, the show's host Lance Preston, along with [[occult]] specialist Sasha Parker, surveillance operator Matt White, cameraman T.C. Gibson, and fake [[Mediumship|medium]] Houston Grey, investigate the abandoned fictional [[mental asylum]] Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital, where many instances of [[paranormal activity]] have been reported since its closure after the head doctor, Dr. Arthur Friedkin, is charged with inhumane experiments on the patients.  After taking a day tour of the hospital, the crew return for an overnight surveillance campaign while locking themselves inside. At first, everything is quiet, but soon, strange phenomena begin to occur, such as odd noises, doors and windows moving, and a wheelchair moving on its own. After recording a haunting where an invisible entity moves Sasha's hair, the group decides to finish their filming and wait for 6 AM when the caretaker will let them out. They begin gathering their belongings, but Matt disappears while retrieving the cameras alone.   Now becoming uneasy and with the caretaker nowhere to be seen hours after their agreed release time, the crew eventually break down the exit doors, only to discover that the exit mysteriously loops back into another hallway, and all exits either lead to more hallways or dead ends. Lance soon realizes that the sun has not risen, and it is still night outside, despite their cellphone clocks showing that it is well past mid-morning. The group attempts to find an alternate exit, but to no avail as the building seemingly changes around them, creating dead ends and false exits. While the group is sleeping again, someone scratches the word "HELLO" into Sasha's back. After the group encounters a young woman in a hospital gown whose face demonically distorts, Houston is separated and strangled by an invisible force. A flash of light follows, and Houston is thrown back, dead. While resting, the remaining crew awaken only to discover that they have somehow been fitted with hospital identification bracelets, each bracelet having their name inscribed on it.  Lance, Sasha, and T.C. eventually find Matt in a room, wearing a hospital gown and appearing to be mentally unstable. As the group leaves the room, T.C. notices Matt remaining in the room, staring at a blood-filled bathtub. He tries to pull Matt away, but is dragged by a dead patient into the bathtub in which they both disappear. With Matt in tow, Lance and Sasha find an elevator, and Lance goes alone to find something to wedge to elevator door open. After taking a pipe from an old hospital gurney he encounters a demonic patient. Lance panics, flees to the elevator, and pries the elevator door open. He is then attacked by the patient, but Sasha rescues him.  Meanwhile, Matt videos his suicide by jumping down the elevator shaft while Lance and Sasha are occupied. After climbing down a ladder in the shaft to the underground tunnels of the hospital, Sasha becomes violently ill and starts coughing up blood. The two stop to rest, and while they sleep, Sasha is covered by a strange mist and disappears. Lance alone wanders down the seemingly endless corridors as his mental health spirals downward, feeding on rats to survive.  Eventually, Lance encounters a door that appears seemingly out of nowhere, which leads to Dr. Friedkin's legendary secret operating room. There, he finds evidence of satanic rituals and black magic being performed on the patients. Lance then discovers a small sacrificial altar on the floor, after which he is attacked by the ghost of Friedkin, who drags him away as he screams, before the camera cuts out. The camera is turned back on, showing Lance alive, implied to have been lobotomized by Friedkin. He states to the camera, "He said I'm all better now...I can finally go home." Followed by his famous outro. "For Grave Encounters...Lance Preston signing off." The screen then cuts to black.

On a road game in [[Quebec]], after an opposing player concusses Laflamme with a heavy hit, Doug savagely beats the player unconscious and is suspended for the next game against Rhea and the [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] Shamrocks. Doug encounters Rhea at a diner, where Rhea dismisses Doug's claim that he is a hockey player, calling him a goon. Though Rhea acknowledges Doug's physical prowess and gives Doug his respect, Rhea warns him that if they ever meet on the ice, he will "lay [him] the fuck out." The Highlanders, with Doug suspended and Laflamme hospitalized, lose to the Shamrocks.  Doug reaches out to Laflamme and promises him he will always protect him on the ice; the incident touches Laflamme, who reconsiders his animosity towards Doug. In their next game, the Highlanders lead 1–0 thanks to strong teamwork between Doug and Laflamme. In the final seconds, Doug blocks a slapshot with his face and his ankle is injured in the ensuing scramble. The Highlanders win, but need a win against Rhea and the Shamrocks in their last game for a playoff spot.  After two periods, the Shamrocks are beating the Highlanders 2–0. Rhea and Doug mutually agree to fight in the third period; although Rhea manages to knock Doug down, and Doug re-breaks his previously injured ankle, Doug emerges victorious, knocking Rhea unconscious. Eva and his teammates help a seriously injured Doug off the ice and Laflamme, inspired by Doug's efforts and Rhea's defeat, scores a [[hat-trick#Variations|natural hat trick]], giving the Highlanders a 3–2 lead. As the game enters its final minute, Eva comforts Doug in the locker room as he comments, "I think I nailed him."

Green Lantern (film)
  Billions of years ago, beings called the [[Guardians of the Universe]] used the green essence of [[Will (philosophy)|willpower]] to create an intergalactic police force called the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. They divided the universe into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, [[Abin Sur]] of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors who had accidentally fallen into the dugout where Parallax was imprisoned on the  abandoned planet. Parallax feeds on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to find a worthy successor.  [[Hal Jordan]], a cocky test pilot working at [[Ferris Aircraft]], is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak [[Green Lantern#Green Lantern Oath|the oath]]. Jordan says the oath and is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of [[Oa]], where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members [[Tomar-Re]], [[Kilowog]], and Corps leader [[Sinestro]], who believes he is unfit and fearful. Jordan, disheartened by his extreme training sessions and Sinestro's doubts, quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.  Scientist [[Hector Hammond]] is summoned by his father, Senator Robert Hammond, to a secret government facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body under the watchful eye of [[Amanda Waller]]. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his [[Nepotism|father's influence]] and not for his own abilities, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a massive party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart [[Carol Ferris]]. Later, at the government facility, Hammond uses [[telekenisis]] to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller high above the floor. As she's falling, Jordan arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a pool of water which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.  On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one of their own until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing that the way to fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro requests that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earth's destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.  Jordan saves Ferris from Hammond after a brief showdown. Parallax arrives, consumes Hammond's entire life force, and then wreaks havoc on [[Coast City]]. After a fierce battle, Jordan lures Parallax away from Earth and toward the [[sun]]. Parallax is inadvertently caught in the sun's [[Gravity|gravitational pull]] while Jordan escapes, and is destroyed. Jordan loses consciousness after the battle and falls toward the sun, but is saved by Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re.  The entire Green Lantern Corps congratulates Jordan for his bravery. Sinestro tells Jordan he now bears the responsibility of protecting his sector as a Green Lantern.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Sinestro takes the yellow ring and places it on his finger, causing his green suit and eyes to turn yellow.  
The Green Hornet (2011 film)
  Britt Reid is the playboy son of James Reid, publisher of the Los Angeles ''Daily Sentinel''. They have an estranged relationship until James is found dead from an allergic reaction to a bee sting. After the funeral, Britt fires the staff aside from his maid, but later re-hires Kato, James's mechanic and a skilled [[Martial arts|martial artist]].  Britt and Kato get drunk together and, upon agreeing that they both hated James, visit the graveyard to cut the head off James's memorial statue. After they succeed, they rescue a nearby couple being mugged. When police mistake Britt and Kato themselves for criminals, Kato evades them in a car chase as he and Britt return to the mansion.  Britt convinces Kato they should become crime-fighters posing as criminals. Kato develops a car outfitted with several gadgets and weapons, which they call the Black Beauty. Britt plans to capture Benjamin Chudnofsky, a Russian mobster uniting the crime families of Los Angeles under his command, and whom his father was trying to expose. To get Chudnofsky's attention, Britt uses the ''Daily Sentinel'' as a vehicle to publish articles about a "high-profile criminal" he calls "The Green Hornet."  Britt hires Lenore Case as his assistant and researcher, and uses her unwitting advice to raise the Green Hornet's profile. Britt and Kato blow up several of Chudnofsky's [[meth lab]]s, leaving calling cards so Chudnofsky can contact them. Throughout all this, the ''Daily Sentinel's'' managing editor, Mike Axford, fears this single-minded coverage will endanger Britt's life, and District Attorney Frank Scanlon frets over public perception that he cannot stop the Green Hornet.  Britt asks Lenore out, but she rebuffs him and instead invites Kato to dinner, making Britt jealous. Kato learns from her that mobsters often offer a peace summit to rivals in order to get close enough to kill them; Britt then tells Kato that Chudnofsky has offered them such a meeting. Kato tries dissuading him, but Britt, feeling overshadowed, follows his instincts. This nearly proves fatal when Chudnofsky tries to kill them.  Barely escaping to the mansion, Britt and Kato argue and fight, and Britt fires both Kato and Lenore, who he believes are in a relationship. Kato receives an email from Chudnofsky on the Hornet's calling-card email address, offering $1 million and half of Los Angeles to the "Hornet" if he kills Britt. Meanwhile, Britt discovers that Scanlon is corrupt, and that he tried to bribe James into downplaying the city's crime level to help his career. Chudnofsky, meanwhile, suffers a midlife crisis and reinvents himself as the supervillain "Bloodnofsky".  Scanlon invites Britt to meet in a restaurant, where he reveals he murdered Britt's father. Chudnofsky arrives with his men to kill Britt, but Kato saves Britt and they escape. At the ''Daily Sentinel,'' Britt intends to upload a recording of Scanlon's confession onto the Web - which he belatedly discovers he did not manage to record. Chudnofsky and his men, who followed the duo there, engage them in a firefight, wounding Britt in the shoulder. Kato ultimately stabs Chudnofsky in the eyes with wood in self-defense and Britt guns him down. A SWAT team appears and fires at the Green Hornet and Kato, who use the remains of their nearly demolished Black Beauty to run Scanlon out the 10th-floor window, killing him. The Green Hornet and Kato flee to Lenore's house, and she helps them hide from the police.  The next morning, Britt promotes Axford to chief editor and stages being shot in the shoulder by Kato, further establishing the Green Hornet as a threat and allowing Britt to get treated by professionals in a hospital. Later, the two weld James' stolen head back onto his memorial statue. Now with Lenore to aid them, Britt and Kato vow to continue protecting the law by breaking it.  
Green Lantern: Emerald Knights
 The sun of the Green Lantern homeworld, [[Oa]], is becoming a gateway for [[Krona (comics)|Krona]], an anti-matter alien [[overlord]] that once [[Genocide|sought to destroy all life]]. As precaution the [[Guardians of the Universe]] decide to evacuate Oa of all valuables, such as the Central Battery. While in line to charge their rings before the Battery is taken away, Green Lantern Corps rookie [[Arisia Rrab]] converses with [[Hal Jordan]] and expresses her self doubts as the newest Green Lantern. In response, Hal tells her the story of the first Green Lantern:  ===The First Lantern=== Avra, a humble [[scribe]] to the Guardians, was chosen by the final of the first four power rings despite having no skill or aptitude as a warrior. Avra and the other three original Green Lanterns, [[List of Green Lanterns#G'Hu|G'Hu]], [[List of Green Lanterns#Wachet|Wachet]], and [[List of Green Lanterns#Blu|Blu]], were immediately tasked with stopping the [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]], an aggressive species which was invading solar system after solar system.  Blu was the first Green Lantern killed in battle, whereupon with defeat apparently at hand Avra used his willpower and imagination as a writer to continue the fight: He created the first construct from his ring, a [[sword]], which was used to wreak havoc amongst the alien war armada. Following Avra’s lead the other two Lanterns, G'Hu and Wachet, also created their own distinct power ring constructs, and the battle was won. The power to shape constructs from the power rings became standard operating procedure, and Avra rose in prestige among the growing Green Lantern Corps. After his death, Avra's ring was passed down and ultimately came into the possession of [[Abin Sur]], who was then succeeded by Hal Jordan.  Back in line at the Central Battery, Hal and Arisia meet [[Kilowog]], the head drill sergeant of the Green Lantern Corps. He antagonizes Arisia as a rookie, reminding her that she still has to attend [[Recruit training|boot camp]]. Hal tells Arisia not to fear Kilowog, and recounts the story of Kilowog's own trainer.  ===Kilowog=== [[Sergeant]] Deegan trained the rookie Kilowog and others by removing their power rings and putting them in deadly settings such as a [[volcano]] about to erupt. Angrily, Kilowog confronted Deegan and accused him of employing a reckless training method and of having no value for the lives of his trainees. They briefly fought until Deegan was called to deploy with his recruits when a nearby planet came under attack by the [[Khund]]s, as they were the nearest Green Lanterns in the sector. Deegan purposefully dropped Kilowog’s ring before departing with the other recruits, and Kilowog picked it up. In the battle Deegan ordered the rookies to protect the refugees as he would deal with the invaders. As Kilowog caught up, Deegan was mortally wounded. Kilowog destroyed the army and went to Deegan's side. Deegan told Kilowog he never would have let his rookies die and that he did what was best for their training. He passed his [[battlefield commission|authority]] to Kilowog, who completed the mission, thus ensuring his death was far from in vain.  Hal and Arisia arrive at a border patrol of the sun and await Krona's return. Arisia and other Lanterns hear a [[Delphic Oracle|Delphic]] prophecy from a Lantern named Laira who is levitating in the [[Lotus position]] (about which she remarks "That was strange."), whereupon  Hal shares [[List of Green Lanterns#Laira|Laira]]'s own story:  ===Laira=== Once a [[princess]], Laira was sent on her first solo mission to her homeworld to deal with charges that her people were attacking the [[Khund]]s unprovoked. Standing in her way, Laira quickly defeated her father's mistress and her belittling brother. But when she faced her father she was saddened to learn that the recent war crimes were his own decision. He has been driven into rage and jealousy by the embarrassing loss of honor that Laira's ring chose her and not him when the Khunds attacked Jayd. After a brutal showdown, Laira was able to defeat her father who admitted she has truly earned her adulthood. He then committed [[Seppuku|ritual suicide]] to maintain his honor. He died in his tearful daughter's arms claiming that she was the true protector of Jayd, not him.  Back at the border patrol of Oa's sun, every Lantern extant has been called to await Krona's return, with the notable exception of [[Mogo]]. Hal explains who Mogo is and why he is not present:  ===Mogo Doesn't Socialize=== Bolphunga the Unrelenting, a brutal warmonger, sought to fight and destroy all of the most powerful warriors in the universe. He was told, however, by his latest opponent (a volcanic being) that he would never defeat the Green Lantern Mogo. Bolphunga’s computer contained no data on [[Mogo]] save for his whereabouts on a mysterious green planet. Bolphunga spent weeks there tracking Mogo's plethora of power signatures, but never found the elusive Lantern. He then set explosives all over the planet in order to flush Mogo out, but was horrified when the planet extinguished all the bombs and Mogo was revealed to be the entire planet itself. He attempted to escape, but Mogo easily captured him.  At Oa's sun Hal and Arisia are attacked by Krona's Shadow Demons and rescued by [[Sinestro]]. Sinestro then speaks of the prophecy that Oa will be destroyed and relates a story of Abin Sur and the Lantern view on destiny:  ===Abin Sur=== Hal Jordan's predecessor Abin Sur fought [[Atrocitus]], a [[Megalomania|maniacal]] alien criminal speaking dark prophecies. Abin Sur was assisted by [[Sinestro]] in capturing the alien. Sinestro and Abin Sur then had a conversation relating to the warnings that Atrocitus spoke of and Sinestro insisted that he did not believe in destiny. Parting ways, Abin Sur took the criminal to the prison planet Ysmault where Atrocitus again spoke on Abin Sur's imminent death. He also warned Abin that Sinestro would [[Coup|rise against the Green Lantern Corps]] and create his [[Sinestro Corps|own lantern corps built on the power of fear]]. Abin Sur however refused to believe his friend would betray his Green Lantern duties and left Atrocitus imprisoned.  Krona finally arrives from the Oa Sun. All the Green Lanterns fight swarms of Shadow Demons as Krona, an enormous figure, rises from the sun. Many Green Lanterns are killed and all others fall back. It is Arisia who devises a plan: if Krona is made of anti-matter then an equal or greater amount of matter will destroy him on contact. The Green Lanterns fall behind the planet Oa and push it at Krona. Krona uses Shadow Demons to push back and the Corps finds itself stymied while taking casualties. However, [[Mogo|Mogo the Living Planet]] arrives and uses its own mass and Lantern Power to assist his comrades. Oa and Krona are forced into the sun and both are destroyed. The prophecy of Oa's destruction is fulfilled, but Krona is destroyed and the Corps is saved.  Mogo volunteers to be the Corps' temporary base as they build a new Oa. Arisia is honored with an official entry into the [[Book of Oa]] for her heroic ingenuity, although she still has to report for Kilowog's training.

The Guard (2011 film)
 Sergeant Gerry Boyle is an officer of the [[Garda Síochána]] in [[Connemara]] in the west of Ireland. He is crass and confrontational, regularly indulging in drugs and alcohol even while on duty. He is also shown to have a softer side, showing concern for his ailing mother, Eileen.  Boyle and his new subordinate, Aidan McBride, investigate a murder, with evidence apparently pointing to an occult serial killer. Shortly after, Boyle attends a briefing by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Wendell Everett, sent to liaise with the Garda in hunting down four Irish drug traffickers, led by Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, who is believed to be awaiting a delivery of cocaine. Boyle recognises one of the men in Everett's presentation as the victim of the murder he and McBride had been investigating. McBride pulls over a car driven by Sheehy and his lieutenants Clive Cornell and Liam O'Leary and is shot dead. McBride's wife, Gabriela, reports McBride's disappearance to Boyle, who promises to look into it.  The strait-laced Everett and the unorthodox Boyle are teamed up to track down Sheehy and his men but, while Everett makes the rounds, encountering language difficulties and uncooperative residents, Boyle has a sexual encounter with a pair of prostitutes at a hotel in town. On his way back from the hotel, Boyle spots McBride's Garda car at a "suicide hotspot" along the coast, but does not believe that McBride killed himself. Meeting Everett at a local bar, Boyle notices a [[CCTV]] camera and remembers that the original suspect in the murder case claimed to be frequenting the very same establishment at the time of the killing. Looking over the footage from the time of the murder, they see that the suspect's alibi is valid–and Everett also spots Sheehy and Cornell at the bar at the same time. Meanwhile, Cornell delivers a payoff to the Garda inspectors to keep them off the case, but Sheehy believes that Boyle will not be so easily swayed, after he meets with Boyle to half-heartedly attempt blackmail and then to offer a bribe, which is refused.  Tipped off by a young boy named Eugene, Boyle discovers a cache of weapons hidden in the marshes by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and arranges its return to an IRA member. After having her last wish to hear a live pub band fulfilled, Boyle's mother dies. Meeting at the bar again, Everett tells Boyle that Garda sources indicate Sheehy's shipment will be coming into [[County Cork]] and that he is leaving to investigate. Returning home, Boyle is confronted in his living room by O'Leary. Boyle pulls a gun and kills O'Leary, then calls Everett to tell him that the Cork lead is a decoy arranged by corrupt officers. Boyle drives to the local dock where Sheehy's vessel is berthed and Sheehy's men are unloading the cocaine. Everett arrives and is persuaded to give Boyle covering fire as he moves to arrest Sheehy and Cornell. Boyle kills Cornell before leaping onto the boat to deal with Sheehy. Everett’s gunfire sets the boat alight. Boyle shoots Sheehy and leaves him for dead in the main cabin as the boat explodes.  The next day, Everett looks out on the water where the boat sank, believing Boyle to be dead. Eugene, standing nearby, mentions that Boyle was a good swimmer, having claimed to have been placed fourth at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], a claim that Everett had dismissed. A young photographer comments that it would be easy enough to look up. Everett remembers Boyle’s remark that Sheehy’s backers would not forget Boyle’s actions, and that Boyle would have to disappear.  
Guerrero 12
 Beyond the fun and sporty, it is clear that football has become part of the idiosyncrasies of people. In Mexico it is a religion, it is a phenomenon that promotes an inexplicable passion.  
Guerrilla (2011 film)
 On the ominous night of 25 March 1971, a heinous military operation, the [[Operation Searchlight]] an operation designed to kill indiscriminately the innocent democracy loving millions, was initiated by the [[Pakistan Army]]. The hated operation was just the beginning of the worst genocide to follow, a brutal crime against humanity after the [[Second World War]]. On that very night, Hasan Ahmed, a veteran journalist of the country, husband of Bilkis ([[Joya Ahsan]]), simply vanished while on his way to his newspaper office to perform his journalistic duty. He is untraceable till date. Bilkis was in banking profession. She started a desperate search for her husband and at the same time got herself engaged as a collaborator to the [[guerrilla]] operations which were gradually gaining momentum. She was not affected by her personal loss and pain, rather, undaunted; she chose the hazardous path to carry on the fight for our liberation. With the guerrilla fighters like Shahadat, Alam, Maya, Kazi Kamal, Fateh Ali and others operating in [[Dhaka]], she started participating directly in many dangerous and successful operations. She was in constant touch with [[Altaf Mahmud]], the legendary personality of Bengali Nation's musical arena and scorer of many revolutionary songs. She thus became the central character in the movie, also a target to the enemy. Bilkis, Shahin and many others got involved in the publication of a secret English News bulletin The GUERRILLA, obviously from the underground. Incidentally, at a particular point of time, Taslim Ali Sardar, a traditional Chieftain of the old Dhaka's subsector (Moholla), who courageously sheltered ill-fated Bilkis, got brutally killed by the Pakistani Army and their lackeys--- the hated [[Razakars (Pakistan)|rajakars]]. At one point, Altaf Mahmud, [[Shafi Imam Rumi|Rumi]], Bodi along with some other freedom fighters were captured. Altaf and few others like him did never return, could never be traced, a tragic fact well known to us today. Bilkis, a lonely character now, could evade the worse, and tactfully leave the labyrinth- like barriers and traps set by the occupational army around Dhaka. She could get into a train to her home, Joleswari, a remote village at [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]]. The metallic train transforms into a character, a symbolic one, a moving replica designed to depict a catastrophic journey. The parents of Bilkis were killed in the communal riots of January '71 earlier.. She just was desperately longing to meet her own brother: Khokon at Joleawari. Khokon was then a commander of the local freedom fighters. Pakistan Army units were on the verge of collapse due to consistent fierce attacks initiated by those fighters. Khokon dynamited a vital railway bridge near Joleswari, interrupting all train movements. . She had to reach her brother. Nothing could deter her. She opted to walk. On her way, she got a young vibrant male companion, Siraj, a member of Khokon's fighting group. At one point Khokon was captured by the Pak Army. The brutal Army and Rajakar predators SLAUGHTERED him along with other captured freedom fighters. Bilkis wanted to have a glimpse of her dead brother, wanted to touch his apparently cold, inert body to feel the warmth of a loving brother, the heat of the fire inside him which no killer could extinguish. Khokon was a living, pulsating symbol of our ongoing freedom fight. She, risking her life, could enter the 'killing fields' of the occupants but was captured immediately by them. Bilkis was captured but she did never surrender to the heinous forces. For her country, for the entire freedom loving humanity, she did set up an example, a glorious one. She does not allow her body, the body of the fledgling Bangladesh, to be molested by the vultures of Pakistan. She blew herself up with explosives, destroying the surrounding mocking dogs in the process.<ref></ref>  
The Grey (film)
 John Ottway ([[Liam Neeson]]) works in [[Alaska]] as a marksman for an undisclosed oil company, killing grey wolves that threaten the drillers. On his last day on the job, he shoots one. That evening, Ottway writes a letter "without purpose" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesn't follow through.  The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. However, a young oil worker, Lewenden, dies of his injuries as Ottway sadly watches. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the [[grey wolf]] feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group soon surmises that they are in the wolves' territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators.  Later, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz ([[Frank Grillo]]) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon. The group then leaves the site.  While walking, Flannery ([[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]) falls behind, and is killed by wolves. One of them spots a pack of wolves approaching and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers. The group sets about producing makeshift weaponry. A stressed Diaz loses his cool somewhat and belligerently threatens Ottway with a knife, but is quickly disarmed and ultimately begins regretting his actions. As he's about to apologize, he's suddenly pounced upon by a wolf from behind. An [[Alpha (ethology)|omega wolf]] sent by the [[Alpha (ethology)|alpha wolf]] to test them, Ottway later surmises, after the survivors manage to kill it and then roast it for food. A bloodied and crazed Diaz, elated at having survived the attack, beheads the corpse and loudly howls like a wolf, then defiantly throws the severed head back at the pack. A move noted by the group as possibly unwise, as they accept a statement that "wolves are known to take revenge".  While sitting around the fire, Diaz tells the group of his [[atheist|atheism]] and Talget (Dermot Mulroney) states he believes in God and lovingly talks about his daughter. Ottway states he is also an atheist, but wishes he could believe or have faith; he then recites a simple poem written by his father. A blizzard approaches; some of the survivors set to maintaining the fire while the others get some rest.  The following morning, Burke ([[Nonso Anozie]]), who had earlier been suffering from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], is found dead. The remaining survivors leave the camp and travel to the edge of a steep canyon. Hendrick ([[Dallas Roberts]]) secures a line across to a tall tree opposite and Diaz & Ottway traverse the canyon. Talget, however, is afraid of heights and with the added handicap of a bleeding mangled hand, when his foot becomes caught on a hook, in the ensuing struggle the rope breaks away. He falls to the ground, getting severely thrashed by tree branches on the way down; barely alive, he hallucinates a vision of his daughter, but is instantly set upon and dragged away by four wolves. While attempting to save Talget, Diaz falls from the tree and badly injures his knee.  Diaz, Ottway, and Hendrick continue and arrive at a river. There, Diaz, humbled by his journey and unable to walk on, explains that he can accept dying in the middle of nature and will not try to keep running. They part company, leaving a tearful Diaz contemplating the glorious mountainous vista, resigned to his fate. Reluctantly Ottway and Hendrick continue on together. Further along the river, Ottway and Hendrick are set upon by the wolves. In an attempt to flee, Hendrick falls into the river and in the chaos is trapped beneath the surface when his foot gets wedged between boulders. Ottway attempts to save him but unable to pull him loose, Hendrick soon drowns. Frustrated and now alone, Ottway looks up and angerily appeals to God for help, to "show him something real", but seeing nothing, he decides he will “do this on my own.”  Ottway, cold and wet, continues on alone.  Exhausted, he stops walking and begins going through the collected wallets of the others. Ottway then realizes he has stumbled right into the wolves' den - and that the team had been steadily walking towards, not away from, the source of danger. Surrounded by the pack and having the leader of the pack standing in front of him, he looks at his wife's photo in his wallet; it is then revealed that she was dying of a terminal illness (hence his own futility earlier) and that he was trying to kill himself earlier in the film but unable to do so. As the large, snarling alpha wolf approaches him, Ottway arms himself with a knife and shards of glass from small liquor bottles taped to his other hand. He recites the words "Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day."  In a brief post-credits scene, the alpha wolf lies on the ground, breathing slowly and deeply. Ottway lies against the wolf, viewed from the back - his fate is unclear.

The Hangover Part II
  Two years after the [[The Hangover#Plot|events of the first movie]] in [[Las Vegas]], Stu Price, Phil Wenneck, Alan Garner and Doug Billings travel to [[Thailand]] to celebrate Stu's upcoming wedding to Lauren. Much to Alan's dismay, they are joined by Lauren's younger brother, Teddy. At the rehearsal dinner, Lauren's father reveals his disapproval of Stu during a toast. Later that night, Stu hesitantly joins Phil, Doug, Alan and Teddy for a beer. Sitting at a campfire and roasting [[marshmallow]]s, the group toast to Stu and Lauren's future happiness.  The next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan, along with gangster Leslie Chow—whom Alan befriended after Las Vegas—and a chain-smoking [[capuchin monkey]], awaken in a dirty hotel room in [[Bangkok]]. Stu has a face tattoo (a replica of [[Mike Tyson]]'s) and Alan's head is completely shaved. They cannot find Teddy, and discover only his severed finger. Chow begins to relay the events of the prior night, but he seemingly dies after snorting a line of [[cocaine]]. Panicked, the trio dispose of Chow's body in an ice box.  Through a tip from Doug who is still at the resort (he left the campfire earlier than the others), they go to a police station to pick up Teddy but are given a wheelchair-bound elderly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, who knows more about what happened; however, he refuses to reveal anything, having taken a [[vow of silence]]. After finding a business card, they travel to the smoldering ruins of the business. They enter a nearby tattoo parlor where Stu got his tattoo, and they learn that they started a fight that escalated into a riot. The trio returns the monk to his Buddhist temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to meditate. Alan is able to recall that they had been at the White Lion strip club, where they learn that Stu was [[sodomy|sodomized]] by a [[kathoey]] [[stripper]] named Kimmy. Upon exiting, the trio are attacked by two [[Russian mob]]sters who steal the monkey, and one shoots Phil in his arm.  After Phil is treated at a clinic, Alan confesses that he had drugged some of the marshmallows from the previous night with [[muscle relaxer]]s and [[ADHD]] medication in order to sedate Teddy but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him. Phil breaks it up and tells them that they have to stick together. They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password by the next morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey (who had the code given to him and put inside his jacket for safe-keeping by Chow) back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured. After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, [[Interpol]] agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is.  Desperate and out of clues, Phil calls Doug's wife Tracy to tell her they cannot find Teddy. Stu decides to call off the wedding and live in Bangkok and say that Teddy died. While Alan is playing a game of [[Pac-Man]] the power goes out again. Stu suddenly realizes where Teddy is. The trio rushes back to the hotel to find Teddy who is in the elevator unharmed (albeit still missing a finger). Teddy had woken up in the middle of the night to get more ice for his severed finger (after the first bucket of ice had melted) but became trapped after the power went out. The four use Chow's speedboat, the ''Perfect Life'', the keys for which were in Teddy's pocket, to travel back to the wedding reception.  Arriving on land just as Lauren's father is about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech where he rejects being boring and instead states that he is in fact quite wild. Impressed, Lauren's father gives the couple his blessing. After they exchange their vows, Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the post-reception dance: a musical guest performance by [[Mike Tyson]]. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone. The group, along with Tyson, agree to look at the pictures together once (some of which reveal Teddy lost his finger playing the [[knife game]]) before erasing the evidence of their exploits once again.

They are both unhappy with their married lives and missing the old days when they were single. Realizing this, their wives talk to their friend Dr. Lucy ([[Joy Behar]]) and decide to give them a "Hall Pass": a week off from marriage during which they can have sex with other women. They are skeptical at first, but ultimately accept the offers and try to pick up women with their friends Gary ([[Stephen Merchant]]), Flats ([[J. B. Smoove]]) and Hog Head ([[Larry Joe Campbell]]). Maggie and Grace spend Rick and Fred's "Hall Pass Week" at Maggie's parents' house in Cape Cod, where Grace flirts with athlete Gerry ([[Tyler Hoechlin]]). She says that if their husbands have Hall Passes, so should they.  With their wives and children away, Fred and Rick check in at a hotel and prepare for their Hall Pass Week. On day one, they decide to eat before going to a local bar and get too tired to spend the night there, preferring to stay at the hotel.  On day two, they eat [[hash brownie]]s and decide to play golf, but get too high and wreak havoc on the golf course.  On day three, Rick and Fred go to a bar with their friends but fail to impress the women there. They decide to get drunk in order to become more loose, but go too far and wind up getting into a fight with other customers. They spend day four at the hotel suffering from a hangover.  On day five, Rick goes to a local coffee shop where he flirts with an attractive waitress named Leigh ([[Nicky Whelan]]), much to the annoyance of her co-worker Brent who insults Rick. When Rick answers him back, Leigh is impressed and tells Rick that they might see each other at the local gym. They later meet there, and Leigh invites Rick for a beer after they work out. Rick decides to sit in the hot tub instead, but falls asleep and stays there for several hours, ending up with his muscles too weak to use and forced to accept the help of two naked men to leave - much to his dismay. Meanwhile, Grace and Gerry get closer, while Maggie finds herself attracted to Gerry's coach.  On day six, Rick and Fred go to a bar called Enter the Dragon with their friend Coakley ([[Richard Jenkins]]), where Rick meets his children's babysitter Paige ([[Alexandra Daddario]]), who has just turned 21 and is with her aunt Meg. Paige is attracted to Rick, but he shoots her down to dance with Leigh. Brent, the party's DJ, is angry at this. After the party is over, Rick goes to party at Coakley's while Fred takes a girl to his hotel room. However, she feels sick, and after a minor incident in the bathroom, is sent back home by Fred before they can have sex. Later that evening, Meg shows up at the room and mistakes Fred for Rick, eventually seducing him. Fred begins to fake oral sex on her.  Meanwhile, Gerry's coach tries to seduce Maggie, but she rebuffs him. Grace, on the other hand, has sex with Gerry, but tells him it will be just that one time. On her way back home, she feels guilty about cheating on Fred and has a car accident.  At Coakley's house, Rick is approached by Brent, who is angry at Rick for going out with Leigh. Leigh calms Brent, then finds Rick alone in a bedroom and offers him a one-time fling. He initially wants to do it, but ultimately rebuffs her, unable to cheat on Maggie. After answering Fred's phone, Rick learns of Grace's accident and makes his way to the hotel to tell him. In the lobby he finds Paige, who thinks he was having sex with Meg. They enter the room and find Fred having fake sex with her. After finding out the truth, Meg kicks Fred in the face.  Upon hearing about Grace's accident, Fred tries to go to the hospital but finds Brent vandalizing what he thought was Rick's car. Upon seeing Meg, his mother, at the hotel, Brent thinks Fred has had sex with her and tries to kill him as well, but runs out of bullets and is tackled by Paige and Meg. Rick and Fred make their way to the hospital with Brent and the police chasing them. At the hospital, Brent is arrested for attacking them and Fred finds out Grace only broke her nose.  Rick goes back home to Maggie. He tells her he did not use the Hall Pass and remembers the time he lost his virginity to her. She is the only woman he has ever been with. Moved by his declaration, Maggie tells him she did not use her Hall Pass either, and they reconcile and have sex for the first time in months.  Fred and Grace also reconcile and decide to hide their cheating from one another. However, Fred ultimately confesses that he used his Hall Pass with Meg when Grace asks him to take her to see Kathy Griffin.  During the credits, Fred hosts a barbecue where he pays Kathy Griffin to be present. Noticing how happy Maggie and Grace are following the Hall Pass week, Gary's wife suggests that she give him a Hall Pass. After a fantasy where he sleeps with a married woman, resulting in the death of her, her husband, her grandmother and several innocent bystanders (and ending with him getting raped in prison), Gary agrees to "give it a whirl".

Happy Feet Two
   Erik, son of the penguins Mumble and Gloria, is unable to dance like the other penguins. Erik and his two best friends, Bodicea and Atticus, follow Ramon to [[Adélie penguin|Adélie]]-Land and find that Adélie-Land has been ruled by a [[wikt:godlike|God-like]] "penguin" named Sven. Sven is actually a puffin in Adélie-Land who survived the loss of his native fishing grounds due to his "miraculous" ability to fly. Erik instantly becomes enamored with Sven, who takes a liking to him. Sven and Lovelace tell the others that they were saved by humans. The two eventually flee (under Sven's mistaken assumption that the humans were going to eat them) and end up on [[Antarctica]], where Sven performs his first miracle by revealing moss to the local penguins. Sven uses his power of "Sven Think" to help Ramon find a mate. Ramon instantly falls in love with Carmen, another Adélie penguin who is uninterested. Mumble follows the chicks' footprints to Adélie-Land and orders them to return to Emperor-Land, but they refuse. Sven sends Erik back to Emperor-Land with Mumble.   Meanwhile, a couple of [[krill]] are in the midst of a swarm. Will is an adventurous and [[Existentialism|existentialist]] krill determined to discover what lies beyond the swarm. His boyfriend, Bill, reluctantly follows him to ensure his safety. Once separated from the swarm, Will and Bill realize that krill are at the bottom of the food chain, created to be eaten. Inspired, Will ventures out to evolve and "move up the food chain" by eating a real creature instead of being eaten.  Mumble tells Erik that he is unique to the world and that he will someday find his calling, but Erik is oblivious. While trying to cross a perilous ice bridge, the penguins encounter [[Elephant Seal]] Bryan the Beach Master and his two young sons, who refuse to let the penguins pass. Suddenly the ice gives away and Bryan is trapped in a deep crevice below the ice. Mumble sets out to free Bryan by luring a [[leopard seal]] to chase him down. Seeking acceptance from Erik, Mumble is devastated to learn Erik attributed the feat of courage to Sven Think. Bryan returns to the [[southern elephant seal]] beach.  When the penguins return to Emperor-Land they discover that a large iceberg has trapped the emperor penguin population below large walls of ice. Bo ventures out to Adélie-Land to recruit the help of Ramon, the Amigos and the Adélie penguins to bring fish to the doomed Emperor penguins. Meanwhile, Mumble, Erik and Atticus deliver meager supplies of fish to the trapped penguins. Erik attempts to deliver a fish to Gloria by flying and nearly tossing himself over the edge of the iceberg. Mumble scolds Erik for his beliefs, saying that no penguin can fly and that none of the emperor penguins will be able to escape. Once Erik realizes Emperor-Land is destined to die, he begins to break down. Gloria sends Mumble off to hunt for fish, calming Erik and the rest of the hysterical Emperor-Land. In the process, Bill becomes inspired to create another swarm of krill but Will refuses, preferring to adhere to his new predator lifestyle.  The next morning, a large flock of [[skua]] attack the trapped Emperor-Land. Noah the Elder encourages the penguins to stand up to the birds through perseverance and unity. When all hope seems lost, Bo returns with the entire Adélie-Land, led by Sven, to aid the trapped emperor penguins. Sven orchestrates a cooperative effort to feed the trapped emperor penguins through hunting and bringing back a flow of fish from the sea. Meanwhile, Will becomes increasingly agitated with Bill's behavior and leaves him into the Adélie feeding swarm, to join "fellow predators". In the process he is attached to a fish carried by Sven and down into the trapped Emperor-Land.   The humans who saved Sven and Lovelace come to Antarctica again to help the penguins find a way out. However, a blizzard approaches and causes the humans to flee and not return. Sven reports that the ocean has frozen over significantly and there is no chance of the humans returning or the Adélie penguins transporting food over such a distance. Erik urges Sven to teach the penguins how to fly, but Sven reveals that he is not a penguin but a [[Atlantic puffin|puffin]]. He admits that after the loss of Svenland, he was lonely and grew to love the penguins who accepted him as a family. Mumble, after watching snow fall into a crevice between chunks of iceberg, begins to tap-dance on the ice and lead the Adélie penguins in a dance to force snow between the ice and weaken it. The plan works until several chunks break loose, sending Bo, Atticus, and a portion of the Adélies as well as several [[Chinstrap penguin|chinstrap]], [[Little blue penguin|little blue]] and [[Magellanic penguin|Magellanic]] penguins into the doomed crevice. Erik and Lovelace tumble towards the edge, and Mumble grabs the thread from Lovelace's vest. The thread snaps and Lovelace falls on Sven. Mumble and the Amigos pull on the thread that Erik is holding onto and pull him up but Mumble injures his foot, unable to dance and lead the Adélies. Ramon realizes Carmen is trapped below and, risking his own life, jumps off the iceberg to be with her and professes their love to each other. Sven becomes aware of the dancing and proves himself to be a worthy dancer despite public outcry against him. He leads the remaining Adélies in dance while Erik and Mumble venture off to the elephant seal beach.  Meanwhile, Will, weary from the dangers he experienced as a predator on the surface, ventures back into the sea to find Bill, but not before experiencing the penguin's dancing. He is suddenly forced down a crack in the ice and into the sea beneath Emperor-Land. Reuniting with Bill and his swarm, the krill enter the inaccessible ice below Emperor-Land.   Mumble and Erik arrive at Elephant Seal Beach where Bryan is in the middle of a fight of dominance between another large male. Mumble pleads to the elephant seals to help free the emperor penguins. Hesitant to return a favor at such a pivotal time of the year, Bryan declines. Using his singing abilities, Erik commends Mumble for his bravery and lectures Bryan for his lack of kindness. The elephant seals travel en-masse to Emperor-Land. The penguins and the seals begin slamming the ice to the beat of [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] song [[Under Pressure]], joined by Will, Bill and their krill swarm below the ice. Finally, the iceberg crumbles enough for the emperor penguins to climb out of the crevice and reunite with their families.  
Hanna (film)
 Hanna Heller is a fifteen-year-old girl who lives with her father, Erik Heller, in rural northern [[Finland]], near [[Kuusamo]].  Since the age of two years, Hanna has been trained by Erik, an ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]] operative from Germany, to be a skilled assassin. He teaches her [[hand-to-hand combat]] and drills her in [[target shooting]]. He left the agency, going incognito into the Arctic. Erik knows a secret that cannot become public, and Marissa Wiegler, a senior C.I.A. officer, searches for him in order to eliminate him. Erik has trained Hanna with the intent that she will kill Marissa.   One night, Hanna tells Erik that she is "ready" to face their enemies. Erik digs up a [[Distress radio beacon|radio beacon]] that eventually will alert the C.I.A. to their presence. Although he warns Hanna that a confrontation with Marissa will be fatal for either her or Marissa, he leaves the final decision to Hanna, who activates the beacon. Erik leaves, instructing her to meet him in Berlin.  Hanna is taken to an underground C.I.A. complex in [[Morocco]] where a suspicious Marissa sends a [[body double]]. While talking to the double, Hanna starts to cry and crawls sobbing into the lap of the double, which makes her captors uneasy. They send some guards to her cell to sedate her.

Marissa hires Isaacs, a sadistic former agent, to capture Hanna. Hanna travels with the family as they drive north through France. Isaacs and two skinheads trail them and eventually corner Hanna and the family near Hamburg, but she manages to escape, killing one of the assailants. Marissa catches up with the British family and during interrogation finds out that Hanna is heading to Berlin.  Arriving at the address that Erik had given her, Hanna meets with Knepfler, an eccentric old magician and a friend of Erik's, who lives in an abandoned amusement park.

Later, Hanna goes to her grandmother's apartment where she finds Erik, who has unsuccessfully tried to kill Marissa in her hotel room. Hanna's grandmother has been murdered by Marissa. Erik admits that he is not her biological father. He once recruited pregnant women into a C.I.A. program where their children's [[DNA]] was enhanced in order to create [[super-soldier]]s. After the project was shut down, its subjects were eliminated.  Marissa and Isaacs arrive; Erik acts as a distraction to allow Hanna to escape. Erik kills Isaacs in a fight, but is shot by Marissa, who goes to Knepfler's house. Hanna is there, having just discovered Knepfler tortured to death by Isaacs. After a chase, Hanna kills Marissa.

Rehan's father suspects this as the doing of a rival real estate company, so he sends Rehan to investigate. He meets a [[rag-picker]] on the way who tells him that only he can do it. (It means that only he can stop the hauntings of the Glen Manor.) Mysterious things happen that night. Rehan sees a girl playing piano who vanishes when the door is opened; a book drops from a bookshelf on its own and Rehan finds a letter inside. The letter, written by Meera ([[Tia Bajpai]]), tells her story from 1936 when her parents left for [[Delhi]] and left her alone with her nanny Margaret ([[Achint Kaur]]), a servant and a driver. In the absence of her parents, her piano teacher Iyar ([[Arif Zakaria]]) tries to rape her. However, she saves herself by hitting Iyer with a candle stand on his head, which results in his death. Soon, the police corroborate Meera's story, as they find explicit sketches of her in Iyar's house. However, Iyer returns in the form of an evil spirit, killing both the servants and the nanny by cutting their heads. The spirit rapes Meera repeatedly, which leads her to commit suicide, but even after her death her spirit is tortured and trapped in the mansion by the evil spirit.  After reading the letter, Rehan feels sympathetic and brings a psychic ([[Prachi Shah]]) to help, but the lady leaves after realising how strong the evil spirit is and asks Rehan to do the same. Rehan ignores her warning and stays there, challenging the evil spirit by repeating its name as it is believed that saying an evil spirit's name makes it more powerful.  The next morning when he wakes up he finds the rag-picker in front of him, casting a spell. The spell sends him back 75 years to 17 August 1936, the day when Meera's parents leave for Delhi. Rehan befriends Meera by following her and pretending to be lost newcomer to the town. The next day, in order to prevent the death of Iyer, Rehan comes to Meera's house with a basket of chocolates as a gift for showing him the way to the city. Rehan says that he would like to listen to Meera's performance as he is also interested in music, but Iyer asks him to leave. Rehan insists on staying outside the door so that he will not interfere in their class and can still listen to the music. As Rehan listens to the music, Iyer hits him, throwing him out on the lawn. Iyer bolts the door from inside and tries to rape Meera while Rehan tries to prevent Iyer's death. But, as written in fate, Meera kills Iyer. A hurt Rehan is admitted to the hospital where he dreams about the evil spirit.  Rehan explains everything to Meera and asks her to meet him the next day at noon. The next day, Rehan, Meera and Margaret meet a priest ([[Mohan Kapoor]]), who tells them that far from the town there is a [[Dargah]], a mosque where there is a Sufi Baba who could help them. He tells them to start the journey at 3:00&nbsp;pm because spirits have the strongest power at 3:00&nbsp;am and are weakest at 3:00&nbsp;pm. As the travelling continues into dusk, the three stay in a hotel, but the evil spirit kills Margaret and tries to rape Meera. Rehan fights it and takes Meera the rest of the way to the Dargah. The next day, the priest is killed by a snake. Margaret's body, now possessed by the spirit, tries to stop them from entering the Dargah, but Rehan manages to put Margaret's leg at the doorstep of the Dargah thereby destroying her body. Inside they find the rag-picker who sent Rehan into the past.  He tells them that miles away is a town that was being chanted by Khwaja, and there is a well in which Meera has to show the way to Iyer's spirit, which is connected to Meera by a blood-stained pendant that Meera is still wearing. As they reach the town, Rehan has to drop the fire, mud, and the pendant. As Rehan is performing the act, Meera is attacked by Iyer, but Rehan manages to throw the pendant in the well. After saving her, Rehan falls into the well and reaches back to the year 2011. He finds another letter in the same place and discovers that Meera lived a happy life after that event. The house is no longer haunted.  
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2
   After burying [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] asks the goblin [[Griphook]] to help him, [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] break into [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s vault at [[Gringotts]] bank, suspecting a [[Horcrux]] may be there. Griphook agrees, in exchange for the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]. Wandmaker [[Ollivander]] tells Harry that two wands taken from [[Malfoy Manor]] belonged to Bellatrix and to [[Draco Malfoy]], but Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.  In Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]] killing goblins, including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at [[Hogwarts]] somehow connected to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. The trio [[apparate]] into [[Hogsmeade]], where [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] reluctantly instructs the [[Portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] of his deceased younger sister, [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]], to fetch [[Neville Longbottom]], who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.  [[Severus Snape]] hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after [[Minerva McGonagall]] challenges him to a duel. McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At [[Luna Lovegood]]'s insistence, Harry speaks to [[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed "dark magic" on her mother's diadem, which is in the [[Room of Requirement]]. In the [[Chamber of Secrets]], Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]] fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, [[Blaise Zabini]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a [[Fiendfyre]] curse and, unable to control it, is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement, where it is destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the [[Pensieve]]. In the chaos at Hogwarts, [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[Remus Lupin|Lupin]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]] have been killed.  Harry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father, [[James Potter (character)|James]], who had bullied him, he loved his late mother, [[Lily Potter|Lily]]. Following her death, Snape worked secretly with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in [[limbo]], where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all.  Voldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands they all surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the [[Sorting Hat]], Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many Death Eaters abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, [[Molly Weasley]] kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort vulnerable. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore, but instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and discards it.  Nineteen years later, Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their own children leave for Hogwarts at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]].  
Hawaiian Vacation
 A year later after the events from ''Toy Story 3'', it is winter break for Bonnie, who is going on vacation to [[Hawaii]] with her family. The toys are excited to have a week of relaxation, but Barbie and Ken reveal themselves to have stowed away in Bonnie's backpack, hoping to join her in Hawaii. Bonnie leaves them in her room, however, much to Ken's horror and disappointment when he realizes they are not going to Hawaii. Barbie reveals to Woody that Ken planned to have their first kiss on a beach at sunset (based on a travel brochure), inspiring Woody, Buzz, and the rest of Bonnie's toys to go all work together and recreate their own version of Hawaii for the two. After various adventures in "Hawaii", Ken and Barbie share their first kiss in the snow at sunrise, recreating the scene from the brochure. However, the two step off the edge of the porch without realizing it and end up buried in snow. In a post-credits scene, the other toys are trying to free them from a block of ice in which they are now frozen by using a hairdryer to melt the ice as Buzz describes it as the best vacation ever. Woody agrees with Buzz as Mr. Potato Head tries chiseling the ice with a screwdriver.

Haywire (2011 film)
 Former Marine Mallory Kane ([[Gina Carano]]) goes to a diner in [[Upstate New York]] to meet Aaron ([[Channing Tatum]]). He tells her to get in his car, but she refuses and they fight. He pulls out a gun, but she disarms and pistol-whips him. Scott ([[Michael Angarano]]), a customer in the diner, intervenes and Mallory demands his car keys and that he get in the car. As they flee, she explains who she is and what has happened to her. The [[In medias res|flashback sequences are intermixed]] with scenes of their flight.  Mallory tells Scott that she and Aaron work for a company that handles "[[black operations|operations]]". One week before, the firm's director (and Mallory's ex-boyfriend) Kenneth ([[Ewan McGregor]]) had attended a meeting in [[Washington, D.C.]] arranged by government agent Coblenz ([[Michael Douglas]]). Kenneth's firm was hired to rescue Jiang ([[Anthony Brandon Wong]]), who was allegedly being held hostage in an apartment in [[Barcelona]]. Also present at the meeting was Coblenz's Spanish contact, Rodrigo ([[Antonio Banderas]]).  Mallory and her team, which includes Aaron, travel to Barcelona and, despite difficulties, succeed in rescuing Jiang and delivering him to Rodrigo.  Back in the United States, Mallory is approached by Kenneth, who insists she undertake what he describes as an easy assignment: to pose as the wife of British [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent Paul ([[Michael Fassbender]]) during a mission in [[Dublin]]. Mallory agrees and accompanies Paul to a party at [[Russborough House]], where they meet with his contact, Studer ([[Mathieu Kassovitz]]). Paul meets with Studer again as Mallory watches from afar. She sees Paul go into a barn and after he leaves, she enters it to find Jiang dead, clutching in his hand a [[brooch]] which Kenneth had insisted she wear as a recognition signal for her initial contact with Paul. Mallory realizes she has been set up.  On returning to their room at the [[Shelbourne Hotel]], Paul attacks Mallory and they have a brutal fight; Mallory gets the upper hand and suffocates him near to death with a choke hold, then shoots him point blank in the face. She finds a missed call on Paul's phone and returns it. Kenneth answers and asks if Mallory has been taken care of, before realising who is on the other end. As Mallory leaves the hotel, she evades Kenneth's agents, who are tailing her. Heavily armed members of the [[Garda Emergency Response Unit]] (ERU) appear and try to arrest her. She escapes after a chase and sneaks onto a ferry to England.  Mallory calls Rodrigo and asks him whether it was he or Kenneth who set her up. Rodrigo calls Coblenz, who then calls Mallory. Coblenz tells Mallory that he has had suspicions about Kenneth for some time. Coblenz then contacts Kenneth and tells him to inform Mallory's father, John Kane ([[Bill Paxton]]), of her purported crimes.  Meanwhile, Mallory enters the United States and reaches the diner, expecting to meet Kenneth. Now on the road, Scott and Mallory are captured by the police. Both are taken into custody but the police are ambushed and killed by Kenneth's men. Mallory manages to kill one of them and flees with Scott in one of the police cars. She releases Scott and leaves to meet with her father.  Mallory reaches her father's house in [[New Mexico]] before Kenneth, Aaron and two other men arrive to interrogate John about his daughter's whereabouts. Aaron receives a photograph on his phone of Jiang lying dead, and it dawns on him that Mallory might have been set up. He tries to press Kenneth for the truth, but Kenneth shoots him and escapes, as Mallory takes out Kenneth's other men. Aaron apologizes to Mallory as he dies in her arms.  The following day, Mallory meets with Coblenz, who reveals that he told Kenneth to contact Mallory's father, expecting that Kenneth would go to her father's house and that she would kill him there. Coblenz also gives her Kenneth's present location. Before they part, he offers her a government job, but she says she will respond after she has found Kenneth.  In [[Mexico]], Mallory confronts Kenneth on a beach and they fight. Kenneth's foot becomes jammed between rocks. Unable to escape, he reveals that Jiang was a journalist who was being protected in a safe house after having exposed Studer's crimes. Knowing that Mallory planned to leave his firm, Kenneth arranged for her to kidnap Jiang and deliver him to Rodrigo, who delivered him to Studer, who killed him. Kenneth then framed Mallory, planning to cut all ties that could lead to him, and convinced Paul that Mallory was a double agent whom he should kill. Mallory leaves Kenneth to drown in the incoming tide.  A few days later, Mallory locates Rodrigo, who is on vacation in [[Majorca]]. The film ends as she confronts him, presumably intending to eliminate him as the last remaining link in the [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] against her.  
Headshot (2011 film)
 A cop-turned-hitman is struck in the head by a bullet and now sees the world upside down.  
Heaven's Lost Property the Movie: The Angeloid of Clockwork
 The film opens with [[Heaven's Lost Property#Tomoki Sakurai|Tomoki]] and the rest of the New World Discovery Club in the middle of another unusual, if not typical, situation. A giant chicken, about whom Tomoki apparently forgot, wreaks havoc on Sorami City, so Tomoki, via one of [[Heaven's Lost Property#Ikaros|Ikaros]]' cards, has  [[Heaven's Lost Property#Sohara Mitsuki|Sohara]] grown to giant size to fight the chicken, which she defeats, but then promptly steps on Tomoki for staring up her skirt. The film then switches to [[Heaven's Lost Property#Daedalus|Daedalus]] who explains more about the Angeloids and their history, and then to a scene where an Angel is asleep in a pod. On Earth, [[Heaven's Lost Property#Hiyori Kazane|Hiyori Kazane]], a resident of Sorami City and the film's main heroine, introduces herself and explains how she met and fell in love with Tomoki, while also narrating about how she took part in several events from the two previous anime seasons, all the while observing Tomoki and his friends, and even becoming acquainted with most of them.  After the recap, Hiyori decides she wants to be closer to Tomoki, so she asks to join the New World Discovery club, though [[Heaven's Lost Property#Eishiro Sugata|Sugata]] is against it, as he remembers seeing an Angel resembling Hiyori in Synapse (the same one from earlier in the movie) and is not yet sure what their reality is. He relents however, when [[Heaven's Lost Property#Mikako Satsukitane|Mikako]] mentions the clubs budget will increase with the new addition, which also means Tomoki must now fully participate in the club. Not happy with this, Tomoki decides to make Hiyori quit by subjecting her to various perverted, fake initiation tests, which Hiyori embarrassingly completes. Despite this, Hiyori's feelings for Tomoki remain unchanged and she is welcomed into the club and participates in many activities with them, with even Tomoki accepting her presence and spending much time with her. This makes Sohara,  [[Heaven's Lost Property#Nymph|Nymph]], and [[Heaven's Lost Property#Astraea|Astraea]] believe they are dating, but wonder why, so Mikako suggests that Tomoki is blackmailing Hiyori. When the three girls confront Tomoki on this, Hiyori, who overheard everything, clears the misunderstanding and also confesses to Tomoki. Tomoki is left unsure of what to do, while Nymph and Ikaros understand that a relationship between Tomoki and Hiyori is impossible. In Synapse, Sugata asks Daedalus about the relationship between Hiyori and the Angel that resembles her. When she does not answer, Sugata mentions that when he first met Tomoki, he briefly forgot that they had met and asks if that is related to Synapse, to which Daedalus confirms. Sugata decides to further investigate, while on Earth Tomoki goes to meet with Hiyori to give her a reply. On the way, Hiyori is run over by a truck and dies, causing her body to disappear and her existence to be erased from the memories of everyone not related to the Synapse. Realizing what is happening, Sugata desperately runs to where the Angels in pods are, but when he makes it he does not recognize the Hiyori in the pod. The [[Heaven's Lost Property#Master of Synapse|Master of the Synapse]] appears and taunts Sugata with his forgotten memories and mentions that Hiyori is awakening. Tomoki, unaware of Hiyori's fate, waits for her but when Nymph and Ikaros arrive, the former lies to him and tells him Hiyori will meet him tomorrow. To make up for her lying, Nymph spends the night with Tomoki and asks for the imprinting, but Tomoki explains that he wants her and the other Angeloids to be free. Nymph says she wants to be imprinted because she is in love with Tomoki, but before she can convey her feelings Tomoki experiences severe headaches from the memory wipe, so Nymph holds him, knowing that by tomorrow Tomoki will have forgotten Hiyori.  The next morning, Tomoki still clearly remembers Hiyori, while everyone else has forgotten her. Distraught, Tomoki runs over town searching for her, while in Synapse Hiyori is grief-stricken that her time on Earth has ended, so the Master of the Synapse offers her one more chance to see Tomoki. Tomoki confronts Ikaros and Nymph on what is happening, but Nymph explains they cannot tell him anything for fear of Tomoki learning that Hiyori is not the only part of his reality that isn't real. Tomoki collapses from the severe headache pain, so the two Angeloids including Astraea look after him. Nymph picks up something on her radar, so the three go to investigate, and find Hiyori. The reunion is cut short when, she is transformed into an Angeloid and is ordered by the Master of the Synapse to kill the three. Hiyori uses her ability of time manipulation to attack both Sorami City and the Angeloids, and easily overpowers the three. Nymph determines the only way to stop Hiyori is to kill her, though Ikaros objects, but Nymph reluctantly prepares to do so, until she is stopped by Tomoki, who swears to save Hiyori. The Master of the Synapse orders Hiyori to kill Tomoki, but Sugata arrives to help, while the three Angeloids stall Hiyori. They manage to destroy the structure that binds her, but it does not free her. Nymph also realizes that the dimensional mechanism system that produces Hiyori's time altering powers has reached the breaking point causing a process that will result in the area around Hiyori, Sorami City, to be blown away. Unable to stop the process, Ikaros traps Hiyori within her Aegis to contain the blast, but also traps herself in since she does not want Hiyori to be alone in her final moments. Tomoki however glides to them and is let into the Aegis, where he is able to bring Hiyori back to her senses. Hiyori begs for them to get away as it won't be long before she self-destructs, so she uses her hacking abilities to dispel the Aegis, and kisses Tomoki before leaving. She thanks him and remembers how they first met as children, and that it was because of him that she came to love Sorami City. She notes that while her time on Earth was short, she enjoyed her time with everyone and thanks her friends and Tomoki, and reaffirms her love for him before being destroyed. Tomoki breaks down in tears, and the film ends with him swearing that he will never forget Hiyori.  Near the end of the credits, Sohara is seen viewing the scrapbook, filled with pictures of the group having fun. As Sohara leaves, a picture where Hiyori had faded away due to the Synapse's deletion, is seen where Hiyori slowly fades back in, revealing that she has somehow been revived.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Tomoki stands at the spot overlooking the city where he and Hiyori first met and behind him a ray of light shines down with feathers falling from the sky. When he looks up, he smiles happily, and as the screen fades out, the sound of Hiyori's bell ornaments are heard, once again, implying that she has somehow been revived.  
Heartbeat (2011 film)
 Yeon-hee ([[Kim Yunjin]]) is the principal of a prestigious English-teaching preschool in [[Gangnam (Seoul)|Gangnam]]. She is a well-off widow, and a devout Christian. Yeon-hee remains hopeful in her faith that her daughter Ye-eun will be able to get a heart transplant surgery.  But Yeon-hee has hired black-market organ dealers to search a healthy heart for her daughter. One donor is a live illegal immigrant, and Yeon-hee cannot bring herself to take his life in exchange for sending money to his family abroad. Time after time, the donors slip through her hands. Tired of waiting, Yeon-hee takes matters into her own hands, and betrays her conscience. She pays an exorbitant amount of money to arrange a transplant: the donor is a patient in a [[persistent vegetative state]], and thus unable to consent.  Yeon-hee rationalizes to her doctor friend that the vegetative patient is an answered prayer and pleads him to perform the transplant. Out of her guilt, Yeon-hee monologues to the patient, and cries that she would even go to hell for the illegal surgery, if it could save her little Ye-eun.  When the time nears for her daughter's heart transplant surgery, Lee Hwi-do ([[Park Hae-il]]), the son of the woman in the vegetative state, suddenly appears to stop the transplant. In the past, Hwi-do was a bad son often leeching money off of his mother. He parted ways with his mother, but when he learns of the current situation he tries to protect his mother. With only a single heart, Yeon-hee and Hwi-do are both desperate to save the one they love. Just when Yeon-hee is about to carry the patient in an ambulance, Hwi-do shows up and gets into the ambulance with them. During the ride, he confiscates the transplant contracts from Yeon-hee (signed by Kang, who dated Hwi-do's mother for money), and takes over the driver's seat. Yeon-hee runs after the ambulance, but it is gone.  Hwi-do brings his mother to a hospital, but Yeon-hee tracks down the hospital. Hwi-do and his girlfriend visit Ye-eun's hospital room to take Ye-eun captive. Hwi-do decides that he won't abduct Ye-eun, until Yeon-hee calls him that she is sorry for taking his mother. He then kidnaps Ye-eun, of which Yeon-hee's doctor friend notifies Yeon-hee about.  Ye-eun records a conversation on her teddy bear while telling Hwi-do that her mother is not a bad person. Hwi-do and his girlfriend form a friendship with Ye-eun. Still, Ye-eun uses the girlfriend's cellphone to text Yeon-hee the consonants of the location of Hwi-do's [[auto repair shop]].  Yeon-hee receives the text, and discovers Hwi-do's place. She tazes Kang and offers Hwi-do an exchange of persons, which Hwi-do refuses. Hwi-do locks Ye-eun in his car and Yeon-hee keeps his mother in her van. Yeon-hee ambushes Hwi-do and beats him up with a plank from the street, while the organ dealers hired by Yeon-hee help carry Ye-eun to the van. Hwi-do and his girlfriend watch them drive off.  Injured, Hwi-do limps to the hospital, to beat up Yeon-hee. Meanwhile, Yeon-hee rushes Ye-eun to the emergency room. Ye-eun tells her on the rolling cot, "Why did you hit someone like that? What if he died? I'm scared of you, Mom..." Yeon-hee becomes weak in the knees and reflects. Hwi-do arrives and finds Yeon-hee sobbing and listening to the audio recorded by the teddy bear. Yeon-hee repents. She apologizes to Hwi-do and tells him that his mother would have done the same thing as she did, and that he should take his mother home.  Hwi-do then finds his mother, and asks her to move her hand. But her heartbeat fails. Yeon-hee weeps with him, and Hwi-do tells Yeon-hee that his mother wishes the transplant to happen.  Months later, during [[Christmas Eve]], Yeon-hee and a healthy Ye-eun are in a car on the way to a restaurant. Ye-eun says that the car seems weird, and needs to be checked out. They arrive at Hwi-do's auto shop, where Ye-eun gives her teddy bear as a present to Hwi-do's now-pregnant girlfriend. Hwi-do invites Yeon-hee for dinner. Yeon-hee quietly goes into the back of the shop and smiles at the picture of Hwi-do's mother.  
Hearts of Freedom
 After completing a tragic mission in which one of the band’s most beloved members is killed, the band’s loyalty to the cause is put to the ultimate test when their leader, Amir (Lukman Sardi) resigns from the Army in disgust. Leaderless and heartsick over their losses, the cadets carry their vendetta for revenge against the Dutch to the high seas in a dangerous mission to Bali, home island of the maimed mute Dayan (T. Rifnu Wikana), where they are sent to kill the Dutch militia Colonel Raymer (Michael Bell), who murdered the family of the band’s new leader Tomas (Donny Alamsyah) in the opening of RED AND WHITE. Facing the cannons of a Dutch PT boat, the hard-drinking playboy Marius (Darius Sinathrya) must overcome his fears as he rivals Tomas for the affections of the starchy aristocrat’s daughter Senja (Rahayu Saraswati).  Arriving in Bali, the band saves the woman Dayu (new cast member Ranggani Puspandya) from the ravages of Colonel Raymer’s KNIL militia, but one of the heroes is nearly killed. As their friend hovers between life and death, the band finds the underground caves of rebel leader Wayan Suta (played by the singer Nugie). Tomas clashes with their former commander, Amir (Lukman Sardi) as they plan a final assault against Raymer’s militia, raising the question: how far can the revolution go to defeat evil, and still retain its ideals?  
Headhunters (film)
 Roger Brown ([[Aksel Hennie]]), Norway's most successful [[Recruiter|headhunter]], supports his lavish lifestyle by stealing paintings from his clients; his partner, Ove ([[:no:Eivind Sander|Eivind Sander]]), works at a surveillance company and deactivates security at the victims' homes, allowing Roger to swap the art for a counterfeit. Asked to dinner by his mistress, Lotte ([[Julie Ølgaard]]), Roger declines and ends their relationship. Roger's wife and art gallery owner, Diana ([[Synnøve Macody Lund]]), introduces him to Clas Greve ([[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]), a former executive for [[global positioning system|GPS tech]] company HOTE, who wants to work for Pathfinder, whom Roger is recruiting for. Diana reveals that Clas has asked her to authenticate a lost [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] painting he inherited that is believed to be worth millions.  Roger takes Clas to lunch to discuss the job at Pathfinder, and soon learns Clas used to be a member of a special forces unit that specialized in tracking people. Despite his misgivings, Roger meets with Ove to work out details on stealing the painting. Roger manages to steal it from Clas' home, but he discovers Diana's cellphone beside Clas' bed. Later, after a seemingly successful meeting with Pathfinder, an upset Roger flippantly informs Clas that the company may be looking for someone else to fill the position.  The next morning, Roger finds Ove in his (Roger's) car, apparently dead from a poison syringe embedded in the car seat; when Roger dumps Ove in a lake, the water revives him, as he didn't get a full dose of the poison. Driving Ove to his cabin, Roger puts him in bed and ignores his demands for medical attention, as he does not want the police involved; Ove pulls a gun in response, causing a shoot-out where Roger accidentally kills Ove. Finding Clas has followed him to Ove's cabin, Roger narrowly escapes after a scuffle. Trying to lose Clas' tracking devices, Roger switches his car for Ove's and throws his clothes in a lake, changing into Ove's spare uniform and fleeing to a farm where Ove used to stay. Clas tails Roger to the farm with his dog and murders the farmer, but Roger evades them. Trying to escape on a tractor, Roger is attacked by Clas' dog, which he kills by impaling it on the tractor's forks. Roger, believing Clas is chasing him, drives erratically and falls from the tractor, only to find his pursuer is a stranger wanting to help.  Waking in a hospital, Roger learns the police think he is Ove, and arrest him for the farmer's murder when he tries to escape. Driving to the station, the officers pull over to block a truck reported stolen. Remembering that Clas developed a [[nanotechnology]] gel that is very difficult to remove, Roger realizes that he's being tracked through GPS gel rubbed in his hair by Diana, and Clas is driving the truck; despite Roger's protests, the officers ignore him, allowing Clas to ram the car off a cliff. Playing dead until Clas leaves the scene, Roger shaves his head and hides his hair on a body, then swaps clothes with a detective's disfigured body to fake his death.  Roger turns to Lotte for help, only to discover she has always worked for Clas, who is still a HOTE executive and trying to steal Pathfinder's secrets. Lotte admits that she put the GPS gel in Roger's hair, and that she suggested dinner so she could introduce him to Clas; since Roger ended their affair, Clas used a counterfeit Rubens painting to meet Roger through Diana. When Roger lets his guard down, Lotte attacks him with a knife, causing Roger to shoot and kill her in self-defense. Roger returns home and admits everything to Diana, who apologizes for her affair with Clas. The next morning, Roger goes to a morgue to retrieve his cut hair, while Diana contacts Clas to resume their affair.  While cleaning Ove's cabin of evidence, Roger is confronted by Clas, who was able to track the location transmitters in the cut hair. Clas gloats that Diana has returned to him, and tries to shoot Roger but fails. Roger fatally wounds Clas with Ove's gun, explaining that Diana only resumed their affair so she could load Clas' gun with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]]. Ove's home security records Clas involved in a shootout, though Roger stays in a camera blind spot near Ove. The footage, combined with evidence doctored by Roger, suggests Ove and Clas were art thieves who killed the farmer, Lotte, then finally each other after a dispute, and the police ignore the minor inconsistencies because they want the case closed. Later, Roger and a visibly pregnant Diana are shown selling their house, and Roger returns to work, giving the Pathfinder job to the client he rejected and robbed at the beginning of the film.  
Hell (2011 film)
 The film tells the story of a small group of survivors in post-apocalyptic [[Germany]] in the year 2016. Solar flares have destroyed the earth's atmosphere and global temperatures have risen by 10°C. The sun is so hot that travel outside during daylight hours is dangerous. Crops have failed, little water or food is available and there is a breakdown of social order. The film tells the story of a young woman named Marie, her younger sister Leonie and Phillip, a young man who is also romantically connected with Marie. The trio are travelling through the dry wasteland in a Volvo station wagon with metal mesh on the windows. To avoid the sun's harsh rays, newspaper and cardboard have been taped over the inside of the windows, except for a narrow strip for the driver to see. They are heading for the mountains, where rumor has it that water can still be found. They scavenge wrecked cars and gas stations for extra gas, water (from heating pipes and toilets) and food, always alert for hostile survivors who might attack them.  When the trio find a ruined gas station, Phillip tries to obtain gasoline from the station's underground tanks and from abandoned vehicles while the women scavenge for supplies in the buildings. While the trio are working away, a hooded man steals food and water from their car and then holds Leonie as a hostage. After Phillip and the attacker fight and the aggressor is subdued, they agree to a truce of sorts. The attacker, whose name is Tom, tells them he is a mechanic. Phillip agrees to bring Tom along as a passenger in the car, on their search for water, if Tom will repair the heat-damaged engine. The quartet drive along through the roads towards the mountains until they stop due to a huge metal structure that is blocking the roadway. The group work together to move the blockage and then three of the group climb down a hill to look at a wrecked car for items to scavenge, leaving Leonie in the car alone.  Suddenly, the group hear Leonie's screams, and they realize the blocked road was a [[ambush|trap]]. Leonie is abducted by [[carjacking|carjackers]]. Although the others try to help her, it is too late. When the trio of remaining survivors reunite in the woods, Tom convinces them to try to free Leonie. Tom spots smoke in the distance and encourages the group to investigate. The smoke is coming from a large fire at a survivors' encampment, where Leonie and other hostages are kept chained up. Tom convinces Marie and Phillip, who are both terrified of the abductors, that they should throw a [[Molotov cocktail]] to create a diversion so that Marie can take the car back and rescue Leonie. The rescue attempt misfires; Marie manages to get the car started and escape with Phillip, but Phillip could not break Leonie's chains so the pair leave without her; moreover, Phillip's foot is badly injured in a fight with one of the abductors. Phillip encourages Marie to consider Leonie a lost cause, but Marie insists on trying to rescue her. Marie leaves alone to search for Leonie. Marie falls asleep in a ruined church, and is awakened by a middle-aged woman. The woman offers Marie water and invites her to come to her family farm as a guest.  Marie sleeps in the woman's barn, only to awake to find herself locked in. Peering out the slats of the barn, she sees what looks like abducted captives being led about. The woman opens the locked door and tells Marie that Phillip will be used like livestock, in the absence of other food. The middle-aged woman tells Marie that she and Leonie will be forced to marry the woman's two adult sons. When one of the sons opens the door, Marie engages in kissing with him, but then strikes him with a large piece of wood. Injured, he tries to choke her, but then Leonie smashes a heavy object on him, knocking him out. Leonie escapes from the barn and hides in the woods, but Marie is bound and put in the [[slaughterhouse]], where she witnesses Phillip's execution. She manages to cut her ziplock cuffs and escape. She opens a locked door in the barn, where she finds many captives, including Tom. The captives flee from the farm, with the family in pursuit. Tom fights with and dispatches several of the farmers. Marie manages to escape and she runs through the woods in search of her sister. When she finds her sister, she is being bound by one of the middle-aged woman's adult sons. The middle-age woman confronts Marie, who kills the older woman and releases Leonie. The two sisters and Tom flee to the mountains, where they find water. Up in the sky, they see birds. Looking over the ridge at a chain of hills in hope of a better fate there, they can see nothing but even more blighted wasteland down in the valley.

The Help (film)
  In 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American maid in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and in intermittent voice overs she tells her "career" story to the aspiring writer Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, a recent graduate of [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]] and a friend of Aibileen's employer and fellow socialite Elizabeth Leefolt. Aibileen cares for the Leefolt's daughter, Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects. Aibileen's best friend is the plain-spoken Minny Jackson, who works for Mrs. Walters, the mother of Hilly Holbrook, the leader of the women's socialite group.  Skeeter is uncomfortable with the racist attitudes of her socialite friends towards their maids. She is shocked when Hilly forwards a letter to the Home Sanitation Initiative to install separate bathrooms for the help. Skeeter later learns that her mother Charlotte fired her childhood maid Constantine for unknown reasons.  During a terrible storm, Minny refuses to go out to use the help's toilet and uses the guest's bathroom, resulting in her getting fired by Hilly, who then slanders her name with claims of theft, rendering her essentially unemployable.  Minny eventually finds a job with Celia, wife of Johnny Foote, Hilly's former beau. The two become friends through Minny's cooking lessons, though they keep Minny's employment secret from Johnny. Celia suffers a miscarriage and reveals to Minny that she has suffered three previous miscarriages. Minny comes upon Skeeter's visiting Aibileen and joins in the book project effort. Skeeter is advised by her book editor at Harper & Row, Elaine Stein, that the stories of two maids are not enough, but potential retribution from the maid's employers hinders others from joining the project. Aibileen tells Skeeter about the pain she experiences about her son being fatally crushed while on the job. Aibileen has struggled to find closure from his death, and believes that helping with the book will enable her to find that closure.  Hilly refuses to lend more money to her replacement maid, Yule May, who is struggling to send her twin sons to college. One day, she discovers a discarded ring and pawns it. However, Yule May is brutally arrested after Hilly reports the theft. Following this and the assassination of [[Medgar Evers]], more maids come forward with their stories, believing the book would help put an end to the brutality against African-Americans.  Following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear that the maids' stories will be recognized. Minny then reveals the "terrible awful” that she did to Hilly: following her termination, Minny baked her renowned chocolate pie and gave it to Hilly. Minny, however, prevented Mrs. Walters from having a slice, and revealed that she baked her excrement into the pie. Its inclusion in the book would prompt Hilly to crusade in denial that the book is about Jackson.  Skeeter confronts her mother Charlotte about Constantine's termination. Charlotte reveals that during a lunch with the local chapter of the [[Daughters of America]], Constantine's daughter Rachel arrived. Rachel disobeyed Charlotte's orders of entering through the kitchen and embarrassed her. In order to save face, Charlotte fired Constantine and ordered them both to leave. Shortly afterward, Rachel took Constantine to Chicago, where she later died. Charlotte had every intention to bring Constantine back to Jackson.   The book is published anonymously, and it is a success. Minny reveals the "terrible awful" to Celia, who finally sees Hilly as the manipulative bully that she is. Celia lets on that she knows about the "terrible awful" by writing a check to one of Hilly's charity groups made out to “Two Slice Hilly”. Incensed, Hilly confronts and attempts to intimidate Skeeter through threat of legal proceedings, but she reminds Hilly that "that" is in chapter 12. Charlotte then intervenes, lets on that she knows about the "terrible awful" and orders Hilly off the property. Charlotte and Skeeter reconcile when Charlotte tells her how proud she is about her courage, the book and the job offer in New York City.  Johnny approaches Minny and reveals that he knew that she'd been working at his house, how appreciative he is about her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has permanent job security. This act of kindness gives Minny the courage to take her children away from her abusive husband and never look back.  In an attempt to seek revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to terminate Aibileen, with Hilly present and trying to frame Aibileen for theft. But Aibileen stands up to Hilly, calling her a godless woman, never satisfied until she gets what she wants. Elizabeth orders Aibileen to leave. Aibileen bids farewell to Elizabeth's daughter and pleads with Elizabeth to give her daughter a chance, as Elizabeth begins to cry. Aibileen reflects on the ordeal and finds closure. She looks to her future as a writer.

Hick (film)
 In the 1980s, a girl named Luli McMullen lives with her neglectful mother and alcoholic father in a small Nebraska town, where she's derided as a "bar baby" by the other kids. On her 13th birthday, she receives a revolver as a gift. Shortly thereafter, Luli sees a commercial for Las Vegas and decides to run away there. She hitches a ride from Eddie, an erratic drifter with a damaged leg. They argue and she leaves the car. She eventually convinces another passerby, Glenda, to give her a ride. They bond after Luli helps Glenda rob a store and spend the night in a trailer behind a bowling alley, where a little boy named Angel lives and who Glenda seems to take care of on some level. Luli again encounters Eddie that night in the parking lot of the bowling alley.  The next day, Glenda takes Luli to the house she shares with her husband, Lloyd. Luli discovers that Eddie works for Lloyd, and also that Glenda knows Eddie and is quite upset to see him. While Lloyd initially appears friendly, his true nature shows through when he viciously berates Eddie for a perceived mistake (Eddie retaliates by urinating in Lloyd's drink, which goes undetected by Lloyd). Eddie tells Luli that Lloyd and Glenda want to be alone, so he takes her to a bar. Eddie is interrupted while hustling pool by Luli, and when his hustle fails, the man that he was hustling makes a deal with Eddie on terms uncertain to the audience. The man then follows Luli into the bathroom and tries to rape her. She fights him before Eddie comes in and savagely beats the man to death.  As they leave the bar, Eddie says that Glenda has asked him to take Luli to a Motel 6 to meet Glenda because she got in a fight with Lloyd, but not before Luli walks in on Eddie doing drugs with two junkies. At the motel, Eddie tells Luli that Glenda actually gave him a thousand dollars to take her off Glenda's hands. Heartbroken by this news and unnerved by Eddie's behavior, Luli goes outside, where she meets a boy named Clement and has a nice time playing a drinking game with him. Eddie interrupts them in a drunken outburst, and the two leave the motel. When Eddie insinuates he's fallen in love with Luli, she tells him she will never love him back and asks him to pull over, leaving the car despite Eddie begging her to stay. While she's walking away, Eddie suddenly gets out of the car and chases Luli into a cornfield, where he rapes her off-screen.  The next day, Luli wakes up to find herself tied to a bed in a rented cabin at a resort and dressed differently, with shorter hair that's been dyed black. Luli shouts for help to no avail. Eddie arrives with flowers, unties her and professes his love for her, promising to never rape her again. They are interrupted by the proprietor, Beau, who briefly talks with both of them and leaves. The next day, Luli, tied up again, wakes up to find Glenda in the room. Glenda confesses that Eddie was her lover, that Angel is their son together, and that she's spent years running from him. Luli also finds out that Eddie lied about Glenda giving him money and that he essentially kidnapped her from Lloyd's house; Glenda has been looking for her ever since. They are soon caught by Eddie, who accidentally shoots and kills Glenda with Luli's revolver. Luli picks up the gun and kills Eddie before falling to the ground. Later, Beau happens upon the scene. He then feeds Luli eggs and talks about his sister and how "she always wanted a daughter," insisting that Luli "look her up."  Beau then drives Luli to the bus station, her plan being to reunite with her own family. After she calls home, she learns her mother was barely concerned with her being missing and her father has also disappeared, a fact also met with relative indifference by her mother. Luli realizes she will be no better off if she goes back. While on the bus, she looks through her notebook of drawings and finds a note from Beau reading "Dear Luli, in case you change your mind" on a picture he drew of his sister's home in Los Angeles with her address written on the picture. She manages to get off by telling the bus driver that she needed to take her medicine and simulates an epileptic attack. Once off the bus, Luli runs all the way back to the station and buys a ticket to Los Angeles.

Once Jimmy has a cast and sling on, however, he leaves with Fitz, taking a taxi ride to a bar named "Berlin" in Oakland.  At the bar, Fitz finds his estranged father, Arnie ([[Rich Fulcher]]) is the club owner and [[drag queen]] performer for the bar, but he thinks low of his dad. His girlfriend Monica turns up there as well and tells him she is pregnant from him, but he rejects the idea of fathering her child since she made out with her boss, before she storms off. Jimmy also admits his mom is dead. Upon the arrival of Jimmy's dad, James, and Officer Fogerty, a confrontation occurs where James attacks Fitz, believing in misinterpreted evidence he kidnapped and raped his son Jimmy. Jimmy opens up telling his dad the truth, thinking poorly of him for not being there to aid his problems, sharing the same feeling as Fitz about his father. However, they all reconcile in the end, with Fitz concluding that having a father rather than none is better. The next day, after turning down a promotion from her boss who ridicules Fitz for trying to make up with her, Monica reconnects with Fitz and the two later care for their newborn child.

Hobo with a Shotgun
  A [[hobo]] arrives by [[boxcar]] in the city of Hope Town, its welcome sign reading "Scum Town". The city is ruled by "The Drake" and his sadistic sons Ivan and Slick with [[crimes against humanity]]. The Hobo sees an [[amateur film|amateur]] [[Filmmaking|filmmaker]] shooting a "[[Bumfights|Bumfight]]" movie. A bloodied man, Logan, The Drake's younger brother, screams for help. The Drake and his sons arrive and, labelling him a traitor to the townspeople, publicly [[decapitation|decapitate]] him with a barbed-wire noose.  Wishing to buy a [[lawnmower]] in a [[pawn shop]], The Hobo begs for change on a sidewalk. However, after seeing a group of [[Punk subculture|punks]] drag in a homeless man, he sneaks into The Drake's [[nightclub]]. Inside, the brothers and their henchmen torture and kill homeless people in arcade-style games. Slick begins harassing a boy named Otis, who owes him money, and Ivan snaps Otis' arm. Abby, a prostitute, defends Otis. Slick prepares to kill her, but The Hobo knocks him unconscious and carries him to the police station. There, he learns of the police chief's [[corruption]] and complicity in criminal activities. The brothers and the chief carve "scum" into his chest and throw him into a garbage bin. He meets Abby, who helps him recover.  The next day, The Hobo goes to the filmmaker and completes a series of degrading acts, including chewing glass, to purchase the lawnmower. A trio of robbers enter and hold a woman and her baby hostage. The Hobo grabs a [[pump-action shotgun|shotgun]] from the shelf and kills the robbers. Realizing that Hope Town needs justice, he buys the shotgun, costing the same as the lawnmower, and kills dozens of [[criminal]]s, including the filmmaker, a [[pimp]], a [[Cocaine|coke]] [[Drug lord|lord]], and a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]] dressed as [[Santa Claus]].  The Drake, infuriated, lets his sons loose. They burn a school bus filled with children — who are friendly to hobos — and burst into a television station, killing the anchorman during a live broadcast — who had expressed his appreciation of the hobo; they demand that all homeless people be killed. The Drake then joins them and orders The Hobo be brought to him. A mass murder of the city's [[vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] begins.  As Abby is walking home, a cop attempts to rape her. The Hobo kills him and Abby smuggles The Hobo past a group in a shopping cart covered with the cop's remains. The pair are spotted by Otis, who informs Slick and Ivan. Back at her apartment, The Hobo tells Abby of his plan to start a lawnmowing business, which she enthusiastically supports. Ivan and Slick enter and attack the two, wounding Abby. The Hobo overpowers Slick, holds him at gunpoint, and forces Ivan to leave. The Hobo then shoots Slick in the groin and takes Abby to the hospital. Slick manages to call The Drake before he is taken to [[hell]] in a burning school bus. The Drake, mourning the death of his favorite son, summons "The Plague", a duo of armor-clad demons named Rip and Grinder. While Abby is recovering, The Hobo visits the maternity ward and delivers a monologue to the babies. When he returns to Abby's room, The Plague capture and deliver him to The Drake, who plans to publicly execute him.  Recovered, Abby returns to the pawn shop for weapons. Attaching an axe to The Hobo's shotgun and retrofitting the lawnmower into a shield, she arms a crowd to free The Hobo and bring down The Drake. She confronts The Drake, holding Ivan hostage; The Drake shoots and denounces him a disappointment. In the ensuing fight, Abby kills Grinder. Although The Drake severs Abby's hand with the lawnmower shield, she stabs him repeatedly with her exposed arm bone and incapacitates him. Rip tries to persuade Abby to be his partner, but The Hobo drives him off.  The Hobo spots The Drake crawling away to safety and prepares to execute him but a standoff between the armed townspeople and police initiates. Not wishing to let innocent people die for him and knowing The Drake must die for the town to heal, The Hobo shoots off The Drake's head and is gunned down by the police. Abby screams and the citizens kill all the police. Drake's rule is over. She later becomes a new plague member with the implantation on the arm.  
The Holding
  The film opens on the dead body of Dean (Christopher Brand) being dragged into a shallow grave in the dead of night by his wife, Cassie Naylor (Keirston Wareing) and the old farm hand Cooper (David Bradley). As they carry out a rudimentary and hurried burial, all the while they are unknowingly being watched by Cassie's 8 year old daughter, Amy (Maisie Lloyd).   The story then jumps to eight months later. Cassie is struggling; her relationship with her two daughters, Amy and Hannah ([[Skye Lourie]]) is fractious. She is struggling to run her farm and her financial situation is so bad that she can no longer afford to pay Cooper. She is visited by a sinister neighbouring farmer, Karsten (Terry Stone) who is eager to buy Cassie's farm and marry her, both of which Cassie declines.   Enter Aden (Vincent Regan), an old friend of Dean's who was passing. Quick to cover up her secret, Cassie tells Aden that Dean left. Aden asks if he can stay the night and after some convincing from Amy, Cassie reluctantly concedes. The next day Aden persuades Cassie that he can be of use to her on the farm and Cassie allows him to stay on, much to the displeasure of Cassie's 16-year-old daughter Hannah who immediately dislikes Aden, sussing out his intentions of getting "into my mum's knickers".   Karsten's interest in Cassie escalates as his jealousy of Aden mounts. He throws around irrational threats, gloatingly kills one of Cassie's calves and builds a roadblock denying Cassie access to the outside world. This is the last straw and Aden tells Cassie that he will "talk to Karsten". But instead Aden kills Karsten and his brother, Noah (Jake Curran) in cold blood.   Life on Cassie's farm settles down as she believes that Aden had a strong word with Karsten and she quickly falls for him. Aden helps Cassie out with her finances, making a good deal on cattle feed and suggesting that she get rid of Cooper as he is costing too much. It's after the firing of Cooper that Hannah confronts Aden, knowing that what he really wants is to control the family. Aden enjoys her teenage bravado, and quickly retorts with his knowledge of Hannah's deepest secret: Dean's [[abuse]] of her. Stunned and hurt, Hannah flees the farm.   What follows is Aden's irrational hunting of his "daughter", much to Cassie's shock. When he returns to the farm without Hannah, Aden strikes Cassie. He is clearly deranged and Cassie walks him off her property at gunpoint making it clear that if he ever came back she would kill him. She tracks down Hannah and for the first time in a long time, mother and daughter connect. Hannah promises to return in the morning. That night, Cassie finds Dean's wedding ring amongst Aden's things. Spooked, she traipses back to Dean's unmarked grave with shovel in hand and digs up the grave only to find it empty. She contacts Cooper stating that "there's no body".  The next morning Cooper and Cassie find her prized bull dead, throat slit. This is the last straw for Cassie and she marches up to Karsten's place determined to sell her holding to him, but what she finds is the rotting, fly-ridden bodies of Karsten and Noah, and Aden living in the house. Cassie tries to escape with Amy but Aden knocks her out and takes her and Amy back to the farm.  As Cassie comes round, Aden confesses all: Dean was not dead, but escaped from the grave and fled back to the [[oil platform|oil rigs]] - the only other place he knew. There he told Aden everything; the abuse of Hannah and his "murder". Aden tells Cassie of his disdain of the man who "had everything and pissed it away". Realising that she is now in the hands of a psychopath, Cassie tries to talk Aden round but all he wants is for them to be a family.  The moment Hannah returns home, Aden locks Cassie and her daughters in Hannah's room. It is here where the truth comes out and for the first time, as mother and daughter talk about Dean's abuse. Cassie confesses that she tried to kill Dean when she found out about him abusing Hannah, but he escaped and went back to the rigs. Amy admits to seeing her mother bury her father's body. Now with all the secrets out in the open, the three of them bond and unite.   What follows is Aden's attempt at playing "happy families", and the girls attempt at ridding themselves of Aden. Together they manage to lure him to the [[slurry]] pit. Little Amy surprises Aden and pushes him into the cavernous pit of cow excrement. In the final moments, Cassie spots Aden's lighter in the mud, she strikes it and lets it fall into the methane-filled cavity. The pit and the surrounding [[methane]] erupt in a massive explosion, leaving Cassie, Hannah and Amy clinging to each other, as a family.

Fred feigns a ventriloquist's act with E.B.'s cooperation as his dummy and they lead the show in singing, "[[I Want Candy]]".

Meanwhile, at the Hoff Knows Talent live show, E.B. is in his dressing room preparing for his performance but his reflection begins to berate him for acting selfish and leaving Fred. Just then a production assistant arrives to tell him that he is next to perform.

E.B.’s father and Fred are tied up with black licorice and are to be boiled alive; Fred eats through the licorice to allow them to escape, something his fellow captive was unwilling to do because of the poor taste of the candy. E.B. survives by dodging the blades.  Carlos, now a chick-bunny combination due to the magic of The Egg of Destiny, battles with E.B. and beats him with an elbow drop easily due to his size and then tries to lead the Egg Sleigh out with his sidekick Phil directing with light up wands, but E.B. improvises a drum session that makes Phil uncontrollably driven to dance to the beat and provides the wrong signals, causing a crash to subdue Carlos.  After being defeated, Carlos is made to pull the Egg Sleigh. E.B. then apologizes to his father for his selfishness, and he and Fred are crowned co-Easter Bunnies.

Home (2011 film)
 The Shamanov family lives in a two-story house in the middle of the Don steppes. Head of the family is the venerable Grigory Ivanovich ([[Bogdan Stupka]]), whom every member of the family respects and fears. Father of Grigory Ivanovich, Ivan Matveyevich (Viktor Khorkin), is a veteran of the First World War, chained to a wheelchair and almost unresponsive to the outside world who is preparing to celebrate his centenary. Everyone is busy preparing for the coming celebration.  Meanwhile, Viktor ([[Sergei Garmash]]) is coming from Moscow to his old home by train - the eldest son of Grigory Ivanovich, an authoritative criminal nicknamed "Shaman". He is accompanied by three accomplices-subordinates. Upon arrival at the house, the whole family sits down to dine, but the atmosphere at the table is tense, as everyone present knows that Viktor is a criminal. Grigory Ivanovich, on the contrary, is immensely pleased with Viktor's arrival, stressing that it was on him in his youth that he placed his highest hopes. However, Viktor's mother, Nadezhda Petrovna ([[Larisa Malevannaya]]), doubts that the reason for his son's visit was the anniversary of his grandfather.  In news reports there is information about the elimination of the major St. Petersburg crime boss Leonid Barygin nicknamed "Banker", and the accomplices understand that the next victim should be "Shaman". Viktor releases the associates and they in turn, leave him with a part of the arsenal brought with them, including a box of dynamite.  Meanwhile, several people are dressed in costumes at the Stepnaya Hotel, not far from the Shamanovs' house (according to Sergei Garmash, these are FSB officers)<ref></ref> who are searching for Viktor. Under the guise of electricians, they try to find out information about the whereabouts of the Shaman, but none of the family members admit that Viktor returned home.  The next night Pashka ([[Vladimir Epifantsev]]), one of the sons of Grigory Ivanovich, goes with Viktor to hunt. Left alone with his older brother, Pashka asks him about how he went to jail. Viktor tells that he stabbed his opponent "because of a woman", and her, he beat up. He later learned that she had a miscarriage because of what he did. Pashka asks Viktor to take him along to Moscow to join his gang. Pashka provokes a fight with Viktor and insists beforehand that Viktor take him along to Moscow if he wins. The fight ends with Pasha getting beat up and the bet is lost.  In the meantime, the militants accidentally meet at the restaurant with Viktor's accomplices and kill all three, first finding out where Shamanov is.  The hundredth birthday of Ivan Matveyevich is approaching. To the celebration the second son of the hero, Alexei Ivanovich ([[Pyotr Zaychenko]]), comes together with his wife (Tatiana Shankina) and children. After another quarrel in the house the youngest son of the Shamanovs Andrey (Ivan Dobronravov) secretly collects things from his relatives and, having borrowed money from Alexei Ivanovich, gets on a train to Moscow.  The battle group approaches the house and takes up positions. The sniper is located on a hill in front of the mansion, looking out for the target, the senior group enters imperceptibly into the house. Viktor feels that danger is near. In the courtyard at this time between the head of the family and his brother, a grand scandal unfolds, into which the rest of the relatives are drawn. A skirmish begins, as a result of which both enemies (both Viktor and the squad leader) are seriously injured. Shouts from the yard drown out the shooting, and no one notices that Viktor alone is in the house confronting the murderers. Finally, the bleeding Viktor notices Pashka. From the window, he opens fire on the machines of the servicemen, but kills only one of them. By order of the senior group, Pashka is killed by a sniper.  Having come to the conclusion that they have organized resistance, the senior group gives the order to open heavy fire around the house. The shelling ends with the death of all the members of the Shamanov family who remained in the house, except for Viktor, Natalia and her husband Igor. The children are also saved because they have left for the river sometime before. Shamanov manages to take revenge on the attackers with the help of Ivan Matveyevich, who, realizing that something was wrong, left the house in a wheelchair and, close to the car of the last survivors, blew up a box of TNT that Viktor hid in his room. Having given vent to his anger, Shamanov looks into the distance and sees a girl approaching him. He recognizes in her Sveta (Angela Koltsova) - his former bride. They have not seen each other since Viktor was in prison. Sveta puts a gun to him and shoots twice, taking revenge for her broken life and for the unborn child whom she lost because of Shamanov.  In the final scene of the picture, joyful children return home from the river by car.

Sometime later Carter is comforting Amy in her house. After inviting him to stay the night,  Amy reveals that Scott is still alive and pins Carter's hand to a table with a [[corkscrew]]. A burned Scott appears and the pair strap him to a chair in her garage where they kill him with an electric [[Cultivator|tiller]].  
Horrible Bosses
  Nick Hendricks and Dale Arbus are friends who despise their bosses. Nick works at a financial firm for the [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] David Harken, who implies the possibility of a promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant being [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris; she threatens to tell his fiancée Stacy that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman enjoys working for Jack Pellitt at a chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby, whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company.  At night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around. Initially hesitant, they eventually agree to kill their employers. In search of a [[hitman]], the trio meet Dean "Motherfuckah" Jones, an ex-con who agrees to be their "murder consultant". Jones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other's bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents.  The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an [[EpiPen]]. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.  Nick flees at high speed, setting off a [[traffic camera]]. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging a film. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness.  The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator, Gregory, reveals that it is his company's policy to record all conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing he murdered Pellitt. Harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic CEO, Kurt retains his job under a new boss, and Dale blackmails Julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient, while Jones secretly records the act.

 One night at the boys' [[hostel]] at Jaigarh University, a senior student Feroz ([[Mukesh Tiwari]]) and his goons [[harass]] freshman [[geek]] Vishnu Pandey (Subeer Goswamin), stripping him down, [[molesting]] him and forcing him to act like a dog. His cries for help fall on deaf ears. Karan ([[Vatsal Sheth]]), an [[engineering]] freshman, arrives at the hostel. He meets Vishnu, Nilesh (Ramesh Chandane) and Bobby (Nirmal Soni) and befriends them. That evening, Akshay, a gang leader, tries to extort money from him in front of dozens of senior males. When Karan refuses he is beaten and Akshay takes  him to Feroz. Feroz asks Karan to drink a glass of his [[urine]] and throws it at Karan's face when he refuses.  Vishnu tells Karan Feroz has deliberately been unsuccessful in his exams so that he can continue to live in luxury in the hostel and has become the general secretary by intimidating the students. He is politically well-connected, and is expected to stand for local elections within a few years. Karan is refused help by the corrupt hostel warden, Sharad Saxena, who is loyal to Feroz and Karan is beaten even more in his presence.  Feroz and his goons later ask Karan to do a [[striptease]]. When he refuses, they drag him out to the field, strip him naked in front of everyone and mock him. He is helped by Vishnu, Nilesh and Bobby. At the library, Karan breaks down crying as he recalls his humiliation. Science student Payal ([[Tulip Joshi]]) asks if he's okay and they become friends. Feroz's [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] activities escalate and he starts selling [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] to students. Meanwhile, Karan and Payal fall in love.  Once, when Karan is with Payal, Karan is called by one of the goons for ragging. Karan refuses, so Akshay comes to him with a mini-gang of five. They instigate Karan by trying to harass Payal. Karan retaliates and ends up beating them all,  particularly Akshay. Feroz asks Akshay to take help from a gangster of his contact. When the gangster arrives with his goons Karan explains and convinces him that Feroz is using them. The gangster then tells Karan to contact him if he needs help. After this damage caused to his reputation by Akshay,  Feroz expels Akshay from the gang and threatens him to leave the hostel within 24 hours. Feroz offers Karan Akshay's place but is declined. He tells Karan that they will no longer bother him as long as he minds his own business. Over the year he and his goons continue to torture freshmen. Some bear it without resistance while some leave.  After a year, a naïve and weak new freshman, Pawan (Vinamra) arrives. In his room, he finds the goons, with Vishnu, Nilesh and Bobby, who have been corrupted by Feroz and are now part of his gang. They now believe that ragging results in manhood and this strains their relationship with Karan who befriends Pawan. One night, Feroz brings a [[prostitute]] to the hostel and asks Pawan to have [[unprotected sex]] with her to be witnessed by the entire gang and the warden. Karan interferes, saving Pawan although he takes a beating from Feroz. He is advised by Vishnu, Nilesh and Bobby  to mind his business but he ignores them. Later he helps Pawan study for an exam while Feroz and his gang watch [[porn]]. When Karan leaves, Feroz and the gang, intoxicated and [[aroused]], enter Pawan's room and [[rape]] him.  A traumatized and pant less Pawan hangs himself from the [[ceiling fan]] with blood dripping down his legs, suggesting he was [[sodomized]]. The reluctant [[Dean (education)|dean]], under pressure from the [[trustee]]s, blames the suicide on Pawan's psychological problems. Feroz warns Karan not to go to the [[News media|press]] or he will rape Payal like he raped Pawan. Karan breaks up with Payal and sends her away to protect her. Later Karan procures a gun presumably from the gangster. That night, Karan locks all the hostel gates, goes to Feroz's room and shoots Vishnu, Bobby, Nilesh and the warden three times each. He gets into a fight with Feroz and his goons although he takes a vicious beating. Once he is holding the upper hand, despite the dean pleading with him not to kill Feroz as it will ruin his life, he shoots Feroz nine times, and ends the gang's reign of terror over the hostel.  
Horrid Henry: The Movie
 Horrid Henry uses his magnetic yoyo to steal cookies from Moody Margaret's Secret Club. Before he can eat them, his mother tells him to do his homework. The next morning, Henry searches for his homework, only to find that after he left it on the dining room table, the other members of the household variously spilled milk on it, stepped on it, and squashed it into the couch, leaving it a mess.   He leaves it behind and has his friend Brainy Brian forge a note from his mother saying his cat ate it. His teacher, Miss Battle-Axe, realizes the note is forged and that Henry did not do it himself, since Brian spelled "homework" correctly, something Henry is incapable of doing. With Henry in detention, his friends join him to practice for a talent contest. Miss Oddbod, the headteacher, and a pair of school inspectors walk in on their rehearsal.  Vic Van Wrinkle, headteacher of the exorbitantly expensive Brick House School, has been bribing the school inspectors to put pressure on Ashton Primary, the school Henry attends, in order to justify closing the school. Van Wrinkle stands to make a fortune from the resulting influx of pupils. Horrid Henry and Moody Margaret's misbehavior prompts Miss Oddbod to fire Miss Battle-Axe and Miss Lovely for failing to enforce discipline, and the school inspectors encourage Henry's pranks.  With Ashton Primary on the brink of closing, Henry's Great Aunt Gretta volunteers to put up the money to transfer Henry to an all girls school (since she thinks Henry is a girl) and his younger brother Peter to Brick House. Miss Lovely gets a job at Brick House, where she notices the school inspectors. Peter distracts the staff and pupils by performing numerous arrangements of "[[Frère Jacques]]" so that Miss Lovely can spy on Van Wrinkle and the inspectors. She is caught by Van Wrinkle, but covertly passes notes about his plan to Peter.  Meanwhile, Henry's new schoolmates immediately realize he is a boy and begin hunting him. Margaret, who has also been transferred to the school, comes to Henry's aid, and the two escape. The traumatic experience motivates them to work together to save Ashton Primary. Henry decides to win the talent contest with his 'Zero Zombies' band, in the naive hope that this will make them famous enough that they won't shut the school down.  After the band wins the contest, Miss Oddbod informs Henry that fame is irrelevant in this case. Henry is later invited onto television programme '2 Cool 4 School', where he can win a cash prize, which Margaret points out that they can use to bribe the school inspectors to leave Ashton Primary alone. In the final round of the competition he is confronted with Miss Battle-Axe, who challenges him to spell "homework". Recalling Miss Battle-Axe's early admonitions and using "Oh Henry, you horrid boy" as a [[mnemonic device]], he correctly spells "homework" with two "o"s for the first time.  Peter and his friends try to rescue Miss Lovely, but are captured by Van Wrinkle. Miss Lovely tricks him into explaining his plan while Peter has her mobile phone call the school so that Miss Oddbod can hear. Miss Oddbod calls the police, who proceed to Van Wrinkle's office. Vic attempts to escape but trips and falls since Peter tied his shoelaces together. Henry returns and offers the cash prize to Miss Oddbod, who declines it. At Margaret's suggestion, the money is used for the party of a lifetime instead.

Hugo (film)
 In 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret ([[Asa Butterfield]]) lives in [[Paris]] with his father ([[Jude Law]]), a kind, widowed clockmaker who also works part-time at a museum. One day, his father finds a broken [[automaton]] - a mechanical man designed to write with a pen - at the museum. He and Hugo try to repair it, with Hugo's father documenting the automaton in a notebook. When his father is killed by a fire at the museum, Hugo is forced to live with his resentful, alcoholic uncle Claude ([[Ray Winstone]]), and made to learn how to maintain the clocks at the railway station of [[Gare Montparnasse]]. When Claude goes missing for several days, Hugo continues to maintain the clocks, fearing that he would be sent away as an orphan by the vindictive Station Inspector Gustave Dasté ([[Sacha Baron Cohen]]) if Claude's absence is discovered. Hugo attempts to repair the automaton with stolen parts, believing it contains a message from his father, but the machine still requires a heart-shaped key that his father could not find.  Hugo is caught when stealing from the toy store owner Georges ([[Ben Kingsley]]), who looks through his father's notebook and threatens to destroy it. Hugo encounters Georges' [[godparent|goddaughter]] Isabelle ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), who offers to help get the notebook back. Hugo learns Georges has forbidden Isabelle from going to the cinema, and introduces the medium to her as his father had done for him. As their friendship grows, he shows her the automaton, and is astonished when Isabelle inadvertently reveals she wears the key as a necklace given to her by Georges. When started, the machine draws out a scene that Hugo recognizes from his father's description of the film ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. Isabelle identifies the signature, that of a "[[Georges Méliès]]", as her godfather. She sneaks Hugo into her home, where they find a hidden cache of more imaginative drawings of Méliès, but are caught by Georges, who banishes Hugo from his home.   Hugo and Isabelle go to the Film Academy Library and find a book about the history of cinema that praises Méliès' contributions. They meet the book's author, René Tabard ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), a film expert who is surprised to hear that Méliès might still be alive, as he had disappeared after [[World War I]] along with nearly all copies of his films. Excited at the chance to meet him, René agrees to meet Isabelle and Hugo at Georges' home to show his copy of ''A Trip to the Moon'', hoping it will invigorate Georges.  The next day, Hugo discovers that the key has somehow found its way onto the railway tracks in the station. As he drops onto the track to retrieve it, he is suddenly hit by and killed by an uncontrollable train that eventually smashes through the walls of the station. Hugo wakes up to discover that the harrowing events were just a nightmare. After noticing that a pocket watch hanging from the rafters of his home is missing, Hugo can still hear an ominous ticking emanating from near him. When he realises that the sound is coming from near his chest, he pulls up his shirt and is horrified to discover that overnight, his torso has been filled with uncovered hydraulics which seem to be what keeps Hugo alive. As he tests his limbs, they too become purely mechanical. When his head turns to metal, he discovers he is turning into his own automaton. As the final stages of the transformation end - his hair and eyeballs disappearing and his face forming into that of his automaton - Hugo wakes up again to discover that this was yet another nightmare, possibly and disturbingly symbolising Hugo’s belief of all beings having a sole purpose in life.  On the scheduled night, Georges' wife Jeanne ([[Helen McCrory]]) tries to turn them away, but René compliments Jeanne as [[Jeanne d'Alcy]], an actress in many of Méliès' films, and she allows them to continue. As the film plays, Georges wakes up at the sight, and Jeanne finally convinces him to cherish his accomplishments rather than regret his lost dream. Georges recounts that as a stage magician, he had been fascinated by motion pictures, and used the medium to create imaginative works through his [[Star Film Company]], but was forced into bankruptcy following the war, closing his studio and selling his films to be turned into raw materials. He laments that even an automaton he made that he donated to a museum was lost. Hugo recognizes this is the same automaton he has, and races to the station to retrieve it. He is caught by Gustave, who has learned that Claude's body was found some time ago, and threatens to take Hugo to the orphanage. Georges arrives and tells Gustave that he will now see to Hugo, adopting him as his son.  Some time later, Georges is named a professor at the Film Academy, and is paid tribute through a showcase of his films recovered by René. Hugo joins in with his new family as they celebrate at the apartment, where the guests include a mellower Gustave who has a new leg brace is clearly in love with Lisette ([[Emily Mortimer]]), flower seller at the station. As the movie ends, Isabelle starts to write down Hugo's story and the automaton is shown in Hugo's new room, staring into space.  
The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)
 In the tollbooth of a multistory carpark in [[East London|east London]], Martin Lomax ([[Laurence R. Harvey]]) is watching ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'' on his laptop, a film he is obsessed with. Overweight, asthmatic, and mentally challenged, Martin lives with his overbearing mother (Vivien Bridson), who blames him for having his father put in prison for physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes him heavy medication. Martin keeps a pet centipede, which he gleefully feeds insects to.  Martin acquires a dingy warehouse after killing the lessor and begins abducting people to use for his own human centipede. His victims include: an aggressive young man (Lucas Hansen) and his girlfriend (Emma Lock), two drunk girls (Kandice Caine and Georgia Goodrick) who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper, a man (Daniel Jude Gennis) and his pregnant wife (this couple has a toddler, whom Martin leaves in the back seat of their car uninjured), and another man. Martin also catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie (Gabe Kerr) having sex with a prostitute (Maddi Black), and proceeds to kill Sebring before abducting the cabbie and prostitute. When Martin's mother finds and destroys his scrapbook, Martin kills her by bludgeoning her head repeatedly with his crowbar until her skull caves in. He then lures his detested neighbour (Lee Nicholas Harris) to the scene, shoots, and kidnaps him. Martin's final victim is [[Ashlynn Yennie]], the actress who played "Jenny" in the first film (now playing herself, having been lured by Martin under the pretense of a film audition with [[Quentin Tarantino]]).  With twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his "centipede". He severs the ligaments in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, instead of actual surgeon tools, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; a grieving Martin places her in the corner. His "human centipede" is ultimately ten people long with Ashlynn in front.  After performing the crude procedure, Martin begins experimenting. Disturbed by Ashlynn's screams, he tears her tongue out with pliers. He then injects each victim with a syringe of [[laxative]], forcing each of them to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. After pausing, he then wraps his genitals in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the end of his "centipede". As he finishes, the pregnant woman awakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim's car and bears her child. She then gets onto the road, but as she starts the engine, she stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal. She still manages to escape.  The neighbour rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the "centipede" into two halves. Furious that his centipede is ruined, Martin shoots all the victims, and when he runs out of ammunition, uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As he advances on Ashlynn, he appears to give pause, and kneels in front of her. She punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into his rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs her in the neck and staggers out. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards.  The scene cuts back to the tollbooth, with Martin watching the credits of ''First Sequence'' on his laptop, with exactly the same reaction as the initial scene. However, the toddler left in the car from the previous kidnappings can be heard crying in the background.

Husk (film)
 Five friends are traveling through rural [[Nebraska]] on a weekend getaway when their SUV is suddenly attacked and forced off the road by a flock of wild crows. Upon waking up, they discover that one of their party, Johnny, is missing. Seeking help, Brian and Scott head through a cornfield to a nearby house, hoping to find Johnny there while leaving Brian's girlfriend Natalie with Chris at the car. As they near the house, they encounter a clearing with a scarecrow hanging on a scaffold in the center before finally leaving the field.  On entering the house, they find it seemingly abandoned and in a state of decay. Back at the road Nicole sees a young boy who disappears into the cornfield and immediately afterwards encounters another scarecrow lying beside the road. On further inspection she discovers to her horror that the scarecrow has teeth and when Chris doesn't believe her she runs into the field to find Brian. As Scott and Brian explore the house further, they find a horribly mutilated Johnny on the second floor working at a sewing machine and he ignores their terrified attempts to gain his attention. He suddenly stops working just as Natalie is attacked and killed by an extremely fast assailant and her body dragged away in front of a frightened Chris. Hearing her screams, Brian runs into the field only for him and Chris to find her now lifeless body strung up in the clearing. In anger, Brian chases after her killer, leaving behind Chris, who flees in terror on seeing a strange force entering Natalie's eyes. Brian tackles the murderer only for it to be revealed as a scarecrow as a second one attacks and forces him to run towards the house.  After regrouping, they discover that Johnny has disappeared and the shaken trio are forced to come to terms with their friends deaths. They then begin looking around for a means of escape through use of one of the abandoned cars littering the yard. In their search, Brian and Scott enter a barn where Scott hallucinates seeing a farmer and his two sons named Corey and Alex, the former of whom is physically abused by his father as his brother looks sheepishly on. After regaining his senses, the baffled Scott attempts to convince Brian of what he had seen. At the house, Chris sees the young boy as well and follows him towards the room that Johnny was found in and is thrown into a state of panic when the clearly dead Natalie walks into the room and sits down at the sewing machine. As she begins to make a scarecrow mask, the door slams shut, trapping the frantic Chris inside. Hearing his cries for help, Scott and Brian attempt to open the door to no avail and Chris finally manages to escape through the window but not before the panel slams shut on his hand, causing him to fall. Brian tries to stop Natalie before she disappears but is too late as she is already gone.  Later Scott suffers yet another vision and this time witnesses Corey kill his older brother with a pitchfork out of jealousy and anger of Alex's better treatment. He then dresses him as a scarecrow and leaves him in the cornfield, thus revealing that it is Alex's vengeful spirit inhabiting the scarecrows. On returning to the present, Scott realizes he has wandered into the clearing and is attacked by a scarecrow before being saved by Brian. The scarecrow chases them until they reach the edge of the cornfield and discover that it cannot leave the field and merely stares at them before leaving. Afterwards Chris attempts to convince Scott that Brian has become unstable in his attempts to find Natalie and to leave with him in the truck discovered in the barn. Scott refuses and leaves to find Brian in the house.  In the cellar, Scott witnesses Corey's spirit and he and Brian find his body, revealing he had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Outside, Chris hot-wires the truck and tries to escape through the cornfield only to be assaulted by Alex switching between numerous scarecrows at will. Chris rips the mask off of one and breaks the ghost's hold on the body, discovering that it is Johnny's corpse. Brian then saves him only to be killed by the scarecrow form of Natalie when he can't bring himself to shoot her. Chris and Scott then return to the house [[despondent]]ly and ponder their fate. Scott eventually figures out that the only time they are safe to enter the field is when Alex is busy possessing the body of a victim and sewing together a new mask as he can only occupy one body at a time. As he is busy possessing the newly deceased Brian, Chris and Scott put together a plan to burn down the corn field with gasoline. However Alex realizes that they are about to escape and finishes before they are ready. Immediately they are attacked by numerous scarecrows but they are all killed by Chris and they agree to split up to have better chances of survival. As Chris makes his way to the road, he is jumped by the undead Brian and is impaled on a fence. He then desperately tears off Brian's mask as he gets back up only to hear yet another scarecrow closing in on him. Hearing Chris's screams, Scott tries to set fire to the field only for Alex's original scarecrow body to suddenly appear and knock him unconscious.  On waking up, Scott finds himself in the clearing with Alex who has strung up Chris on the scaffold. Remembering  his vision, Scott finds the pitchfork dropped nearby and stabs Alex repeatedly with it only for him to get back up and attempt to kill him. Chris grabs Alex and holds him in place to give Scott enough time to escape. Alex then kills Chris and gives chase after Scott, who frantically runs towards the road. Scott finally manages to make it out of the field and collapses in exhaustion as he  sees a couple drive up and begin searching for the occupants. Due to his injuries, he is unable to speak and looks on in horror as he sees the scarecrow, who gives him a sinister glance before lying back down on the side of the road. The couple then see Scott as he looks at them in shock and the film cuts to black.

Hysteria (2011 film)
 Set at the end of 1880, the film depicts the invention of the [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]. [[Joseph Mortimer Granville|Dr. Mortimer Granville]] ([[Hugh Dancy]]) is a young physician who has difficulty with his occupation due to constant arguments over modern medicine. He gets a job assisting Dr. Dalrymple ([[Jonathan Pryce]]), whose practice specializes in the treatment of "hysteria", a popular diagnosis for women of that time. [[Medical practitioner]]s like Dr. Dalrymple tried to manage hysteria by massaging the genital area, decently covered under a curtain, to elicit "[[paroxysm]]al convulsions", without recognizing that they were inducing [[orgasm]]s. Granville meets Dr. Dalrymple's daughters, Emily ([[Felicity Jones]]), and her older sister Charlotte ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]), a [[suffragette|premodern feminist]] who runs a [[settlement movement|settlement house]] in a poor section of London.  Granville seems to be good at massaging, getting a sizeable following, while at the same time Dr. Dalrymple suggests he might eventually take over the business and marry Emily. One night after work, Charlotte comes in with her friend Fannie ([[Ashley Jensen]]), who has broken her ankle. After he helps treat her, Dalrymple forbids Granville from offering any future assistance to Charlotte, hoping to dissuade her from her work in the slums. Meanwhile, the increased clientele at the practice is hard on Granville, and his hand musculature is unable to keep up with the task; an attack of cramp results in his dismissal. Fortunately, his friend, Lord Edmund St. John-Smythe, has developed an electrical [[feather duster]], and its vibrations give Dr. Granville the idea of modifying the gadget for use as an electric massager. After successfully using it on the Dalrymple's maid Molly, he persuades Dr. Dalrymple to try the device on his patients, resulting in massive success. Mortimer and Emily then become engaged, while Charlotte struggles with supporting the welfare house.  At the engagement party, Charlotte is arrested while protecting Fannie from a police officer. Emily and Dr. Dalrymple urge Granville to testify at her trial that she is hysterical in order to prevent her from being sent to prison. During the trial, the prosecutor recommends that Charlotte be sent to a sanatorium and be forced to undergo a [[hysterectomy]]. As Mortimer speaks, he explains that the symptoms for hysteria are too common to be regarded as a mental illness, and that he himself believes that Charlotte is the most generous and caring person he knows. The judge agrees with Mortimer's argument, and Charlotte is sentenced to just thirty days in prison for her assault on the policeman.  Emily decides to end her engagement to Granville, after realising her only motive was to please her father. The vibrator now enters the stage as a medical device for the treatment of the condition, reducing treatment time while greatly increasing customer satisfaction. The royalties from its sale result in independent wealth for Granville, who has fallen in love with Charlotte. Pledging to use some of his wealth to establish a clinic at her settlement house, he proposes marriage to Charlotte and she accepts.  
The Hunter (2011 Australian film)
 Mercenary Martin David ([[Willem Dafoe]]) is hired by military biotech company Red Leaf to go to [[Tasmania]] and gather samples of the [[Thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]], with further instructions to kill all remaining tigers to ensure no competing organization will get their DNA.  Posing as a university biologist, Martin lodges in the home of the Armstrong family: Lucy ([[Frances O'Connor]]) and her two young children Katie ([[Morgana Davies]]) and Jamie (Finn Woodlock). Lucy is perpetually benumbed from prescribed medication, taken after the disappearance of her environmentalist husband, Jarrah Armstrong. Speculation surrounds Jarrah's disappearance, particularly with regards to a longstanding conflict between the local loggers who are in desperate need of jobs, and the 'greenies', a group of environmentalists who have set up road blocks to the forest to prevent its deforestation. Martin goes into the bush for twelve days at a time, setting up various steel traps and makeshift snares, while waiting patiently to see if a tiger will surface. During his short stays at the Armstrongs' to resupply, Martin slowly befriends the children, and discovers that Lucy's medication is delivered to her by Jack Mindy ([[Sam Neill]]), who has been unofficially looking in on the family. Martin confiscates Lucy's medication, and bathes her while she is unconscious, after realizing the detrimental effects of her dependency.  During one return from the bush, Martin finds Lucy has recovered from the symptoms of her addiction. Jamie provides Martin with a clue as to the tiger's whereabouts: a drawing of the tiger near trees and small bodies of water. From the drawing, Martin is able to deduce the tiger's location on his map. On his next trip out, Martin stumbles across Jarrah's skeletal remains and discovers that he had been shot through the head. Martin gives him a proper burial, but does not reveal his findings to the Armstrong family. On his return to the Armstrong house, Lucy informs him that Red Leaf had initially contracted Jarrah to locate the tiger, a pursuit he eventually abandoned in favor of taking up an environmental cause to protect wildlife and that Red Leaf wanted Jarrah to find the tiger because they believed that it had a paralyzing venom in its bite.  While hiking to check his traps, Martin is ambushed by a rival Red Leaf operative sent to replace him. The man binds Martin's hands and instructs Martin to lead him to the tiger's cave, but Martin instead leads the operative past one of his steel traps. The operative steps on the trap, and its metal teeth bind his leg. The operative drops both rifles. Martin frees his hands, picks up one of the rifles, and kills the operative just as the operative frees himself from the trap and lunges for the other rifle. Martin returns to the Armstrong residence to find it burnt down. Confronting Mindy, he learns that Lucy and Katie had perished in the fire that Mindy claims broke out by accident, but Jamie survived and was taken by the authorities. Martin sets out into the bush once more to find the Tasmanian tiger and put an end to Red Leaf's pursuit. He finally finds the creature and reluctantly shoots it, then proceeds to cremate it in order to remove all traces of its existence.  Martin returns to town and calls Red Leaf, informing them that what they are looking for is "gone forever". He then goes to a school where Jamie sits alone on a bench. When Jamie sees Martin, he runs excitedly toward him and the two embrace.  
Hunky Dory (film)
 Set in a Welsh [[comprehensive school]] during the long hot summer of 1976, keen drama teacher Vivienne ([[Minnie Driver]]) fights sweltering heat and general teenage apathy to put on a [[glam rock]] musical version of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[The Tempest]] of which [[David Bowie]] might be proud.<ref></ref> To engage her totally lackadaisical students, and get them to explore and express their emotions, she uses pop hits of the time, performed by a fresh young cast led by Davey ([[Aneurin Barnard]]). She hopes her more liberal approach to learning may stir them to discover they might be good at something, if once they let their inhibitions go, and might actually have fun creating something, and even absorb some of the dreaded Shakespeare after all. Her aspirations appear thwarted by her troublesome students who, raging with hormones, get up to various antics which seem destined to sabotage the musical. She also faces opposition from traditionally-minded, old-fashioned teaching staff, so getting the show to opening night is a constant challenge.   Later, a frustrated student sets fire to the whole school auditorium. Consequently, now minus a stage and most of the musical instruments, the show has to be promptly cancelled by the headmaster, despite his cooperation having earlier been bribed by his being cast in the part of [[Prospero]]). A side plot involves conflict between Vivienne's liberalism and the attitudes of her long-standing opponents on the staff, centring on discovering which "delinquent" student was responsible for the arson. Deflated, but ultimately unwilling to chart this mishap or her role as "music teacher" as yet another thing she's failed at in life, she manages to persuade both the headmaster and the students to continue with rehearsals, and go ahead with the show regardless, but re-siting it in an alfresco outdoor setting. So [[The Tempest]] is staged under moon and stars, set around a large theatrical looking tree on the school grounds. Her production is a triumph, much enjoyed by both the students and their families in the audience.  An end scene, just prior to the credits rolling, features a photo-montage of what became of each student post leaving school. Vivienne had remained as music teacher, directing a school play every year since, till, at the year of release of 'this very film', she retires from the job. <ref></ref>

Jonathan runs a successful medical practice, but all of his patients are wealthy drug addicts, he and his wife are divorced, and their young son identifies more with his mother's new husband than with Jonathan. Richard is a published author, but he has only written one book and now teaches high school English. Tim, an open bisexual, was until 5 years ago living in a happy relationship with a man, until accidentally causing the fatal car crash that took the lives of his boyfriend and his sister, Jill.  The four friends party for several days at a beach side mansion, during which the men consume massive quantities of drugs provided to them by Jonathan, including [[oxycodone]], ativan, dilaudid, adderall, ketamine, medicinal marijuana, hydrocodone, cocaine and morphine. After reminiscent conversation they head into town for food and to pick up women. Richard convinces a young waitress to bring her friends back to the house. Tim engages in a three-way with two of the revelers, during which they [[role play]] the parts of Tim's dead boyfriend and sister. Early in the morning, Tim hangs himself in the shower. Richard, Ron, and Jonathan find him, along with a note he left behind. The note contains the text of a suicide pact the men made in 1986, promising that they would kill themselves together if they found life unfulfilling in middle age. Afraid that the police will find the note and blame them for Tim's death, they bury him on the beach behind the house. Ron disagrees with continuing the fulfillment of the suicide pact, which results in Richard and Jonathan mocking him as a coward and a liar. Ron goes to an airport in an attempt to return home, but cannot bring himself to board the plane after listening to worrisome voicemails by his wife, indicating that federal agents are at their house and waiting to arrest him. He returns to the mansion and the three friends reunite.  Going into town for lunch, the men eat at a restaurant where an elderly man goes into cardiac arrest. Jonathan saves his life, drawing the attention of police Officer Boyde ([[Carla Gugino]]). Coming to the house to thank Jonathan, Boyde encounters an inebriated and agitated Ron. Believing that Boyde knows something is wrong, Ron attempts to get her to leave, raising Boyde's suspicions.   Later, Richard finds Ron in his room, unwilling to return home to the waiting federal agents. He tells Richard that he is frustrated with where his life has ended up, cannot face his wife and family, and no longer wants to live. Richard agrees to help him end his suffering and smothers him to death with a pillow. The next morning, Richard and Jonathan bury Ron beside Tim.   Richard and Jonathan go into town to party more, where Richard provokes two young men into beating him up. Jonathan, having decided to end his life, calls his son, asking the boy to promise him to remember who his real father was. After Jonathan's ex-wife interrupts, he uses a stethoscope to make a [[tourniquet]] and gives himself a fatal overdose of intravenous sedative, most likely a barbiturate. Richard discovers his body just after he intended to tell him that he couldn't go through with the suicide pact and buries Jonathan beside the others.  The next morning Boyde arrives at the house to check in on the men, the bar fight and Ron's suspicious behavior leading her to believe that something criminal is occurring. Entering the mansion, she finds a disturbed Richard has covered the inside of the house in artistic recreations of the text of the suicide pact. Richard tells that his friends are dead and then flees in a sports car, leading Boyde on a high speed chase to the [[Point Sur Lighthouse]]. When Boyde arrives, she finds Richard's car with the suicide pact on the front seat and Richard near the edge of the cliffs above the ocean. Boyde attempts to talk Richard away from the edge, but Richard states he would "miss his friends too much" and jumps while Boyde looks on in shock. The film ends on a close up of the suicide pact and the four friends each narrating a line.

Meanwhile, Manny brings the Christmas Rock out of storage, to Ellie's delight: the rock is intended as a surprise for Peaches, who comes sliding down a snow slope in a snowball fight with Crash and Eddie. Manny reveals that the Christmas Rock is the same one from his childhood, a family heirloom, and important as it lets [[Santa Claus]] find them to deliver presents.  Diego and Sid step in to see the Christmas Rock, with Sid deriding it. Manny will not let Sid near the Rock and Sid, to find his own means of decorations, decides to find a different decoration and chooses a tree. Crash and Eddie help him to decorate the tree with insects, small animals, and fish bones: to top the tree, Sid puts a star-shaped piece of ice on the top, which is accidentally flung off and hits the Christmas Rock, shattering it. Manny, furious at Sid, declares that Sid is on the "Naughty List". Manny dismisses the idea of Santa to Ellie, which Peaches overhears, and the young [[mammoth]] is shocked that Manny does not believe in Santa. Sid, in tears that he destroyed the rock, slides downhill as his tears freeze solid.  Scrat finds an acorn half frozen in a pond and steps onto the slippery surface to pull it out. After pulling it out successfully, Scrat begins to ice skate with the acorn, going through a log, where he misplaces the acorn and instead mistakenly holds onto a spider, which attacks him. Meanwhile, Sid, feet still frozen, sulks about being on the Naughty List until Peaches calls on him to snap out of it: she intends to head to the North Pole with Sid, Crash, and Eddie so as to convince Santa Claus to take Sid off the Naughty List, along with Crash and Eddie, who, despite their misdeeds, still want Christmas.  The four set off to the North Pole by following the Northern Lights, and move on until they reach a whiteout, which separates them for a moment until they find one another and move on, led by Sid, who mistakenly leads them off a cliff. As they fall, they are rescued by a flying reindeer, who takes them to the other side of the cliff and introduces himself as [[Santa Claus's reindeer|Prancer]]. Sid thanks the reindeer and moves on before he nearly falls down the cliff again and is caught by Peaches, who decides that the reindeer will go with them. Back at the village, however, Manny attempts to patch up the Christmas Rock with mud and sticks, to poor effect, when Ellie comes along, calling out that she cannot find Peaches, Sid, Crash, or Eddie. Diego states that the four of them headed out to the North Pole to find Santa; with that, Manny and Ellie move on to find Peaches and the others, led by Diego, who tracks them by, reluctantly, picking up Sid's scent. Prancer and the animals arrive somewhere near the North Pole, seeing sugar plums and peppermint bark. As they continue, they are stopped by a mini sloth and the "santourage", who keep out visitors to Santa. They move towards Prancer and the animals, causing him to fly up into a block of snow, and as they try to pull him out, the ice cracks, causing an avalanche, ruining Santa's work, and toppling the rescue trio. Santa invents the "naughty list" after Manny talks about it. All the animals fix the mess, but Santa has much more gifts than usual, so Prancer volunteers to fly the sleigh. He realizes he can't do it alone so he goes and gets his family, [[Santa Claus's reindeer|Dasher, Dancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen]]. Then, Santa leaves through the night sky, and everyone is back on the nice list.

Ice (2011 miniseries)
 By 2020, [[global warming]] has increased significantly. [[Southern Europe]] has turned into a [[desert]] since it stopped raining, and similar events now happen in [[Northern Europe]]. Only the [[United Kingdom]] and some parts in the [[United States]] are unaffected. Furthermore, a global energy crisis exists as [[fossil fuel]]s are running out.  The last known reserves are under [[seabed]] under [[Greenland]]'s [[glacier]]s. An American energy company, Halo, has the only licence to drill in Greenland.  Professor Thom Archer works at "Polar Alliance", a government service, whose purpose is to find connections between industrial activities in the [[Arctic]] and the melting of its ice. Thom tries to convince the authorities to revoke the licence of Halo. According to Thom the glaciers are melting very fast, and if they disappear the sea water will rise 7 metres, the [[North Atlantic Current]] will halt, potentially causing a new [[ice age]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Halo admits there is indeed a heating in that area but also claims Thom has no evidence there is a direct connection between the heating and Halo's activities. Therefore the government extends the licence.  As Thom's wife & daughter travel to visit his father in the UK for his daughter's birthday, Thom's colleague Peterson finds evidence that Halo's drills are responsible for the melting of the glaciers. Thom travels to Greenland only to find out Peterson was killed, apparently by a [[polar bear]], but later determined to be at Halo's hand.  Despite this, Thom finds Peterson's evidence, as a new drill by Halo opens a geothermic source in the seabed. This source melts down all the polar ice in only a few hours. Thom's prediction is now a fact: the northern hemisphere is rapidly covered by an enormous amount of snow and temperature decreases to -22° [[Fahrenheit]].   At Thom's insistence, the British Government advises the population to evacuate to the south, and they dismantle the apparatus of government. Meanwhile, Thom flies to the UK with ex-Halo environmental advocate Sarah Fitch, to rescue his family in a [[post-apocalyptic]] London.  
Immortals (2011 film)
 Before the dawn of man and beast, Immortals waged war against each other in Heaven. The victors declared themselves [[Twelve Olympians|gods]] while the vanquished were renamed the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and imprisoned beneath Mount [[Tartarus]]. The Epirus Bow, a weapon of immense power, was lost on Earth during the war.  In 1228 BC, the mortal king Hyperion<ref>This "Hyperion" in the movie is ''fictional'' and not [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion the Titan god]]</ref> of [[Heraklion]] searches for the bow, intending to use it to release the Titans to get revenge on the gods for failing to save his family from disease. Hyperion captures the virgin [[oracle]] [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], believing that she can use her visions to find the Epirus Bow's resting place.  In a small village nearby, the inhabitants prepare to flee to Mount Tartarus to avoid Hyperion's army. One inhabitant named [[Theseus]] is a skilled warrior trained by his mentor, a mysterious old man. Theseus and his mother Aethra, are considered undesirables because Theseus was born from Aethra being raped, and they are forced to stay behind by Athenian soldiers including Lysander. Theseus is able to beat multiple opponents until the Athenian officer Helios intervenes and discharges Lysander from the army for his actions. Lysander travels to Hyperion, offering his service and the village's location. Hyperion accepts, but hammers Lysander's testicles for being a traitor so he can never father children. Hyperion's forces attack Theseus's village, murdering the villagers and Aethra, and taking Theseus captive.  The old man is revealed to be [[Zeus]] when he meets with his fellow gods [[Athena]], [[Poseidon]], [[Ares]], [[Apollo]], and [[Heracles]]. Zeus warns them not to interfere in mortal affairs as gods unless the Titans are released, and that they must have faith in mankind to defeat Hyperion.  Theseus is enslaved alongside the thief Stavros. Phaedra, who is held captive nearby, sees a vision of Theseus. Phaedra organizes a revolt, using the chaos to escape with Theseus, Stavros, Dareios and the monk that had earlier cut off his own tongue so that torture wouldn't make him tell Hyperion who was the virgin oracle. Theseus decides to pursue Hyperion and attempts to capture a boat, but he and his allies are overwhelmed by Hyperion's forces. Poseidon disobeys Zeus' orders and dives from Olympus into the ocean, causing a tsunami that wipes out Hyperion's men. Phaedra tells Theseus of her vision and together they believe that the shrouded body is his mother and they must return home to bury Aethra. Even though Theseus doesn't believe in the gods, his mother did and so must be properly buried.  While laying Aethra to rest in the village's [[labyrinth]], Theseus discovers the Epirus Bow embedded in nearby rock. He frees the Epirus Bow, but is attacked by Hyperion's henchman the [[Minotaur]]. Theseus kills the Minotaur and uses the Bow to save his allies from being executed before collapsing from poisoned scratches inflicted by the Minotaur. Phaedra tends to Theseus and later falls in love with him. They make love to each other, stripping her of the visions she deemed a curse.  The group returns to Phaedra's temple while Hyperion and his forces are away at Mount Tartarus. At the temple, the monk followed by Stavros and Theseus are lured into an ambush and Theseus loses the Epirus Bow. Outnumbered by Hyperion's men, Ares directly intervenes to save Theseus, and Athena provides the men with horses to reach Mount Tartarus. Zeus arrives and angrily kills Ares for disobeying his command. Zeus tells Theseus and his allies to let Ares' death be a warning to both the gods and them that they will receive no more help from the gods, and he must justify the faith Zeus has in him alone. Before leaving with Athena, Zeus tells Theseus to prove him right. The lost Epirus Bow is brought to Hyperion.  Theseus, Stavros, and Phaedra travel to Mount Tartarus. Theseus tries in vain to warn [[Greeks|Hellenics]]' King Cassander of Hyperion's plans, but Cassander dismisses his talk of gods as myth, intending to negotiate peace with Hyperion. The following day, Hyperion uses the Bow to destroy Mount Tartarus' seemingly indestructible gate.  Theseus leads the Hellenic army to war against the Hyperion forces, killing Lysander. Hyperion ignores the battle, storms through to Mount Tartarus, and kills Helios and Cassander, using the Epirus Bow to breach the mountain and free the Titans before Stavros and Theseus can stop him. The force of the release knocks the mortals down. Knocked into the vault and unable to escape, Stavros retrieves the Epirus Bow and kills a Titan to buy Theseus time to get away, but is killed by the other Titans. Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Heracles, and Apollo arrive and battle the Titans while Theseus fights Hyperion. Zeus destroys the Epirus Bow, and the gods prove more than a match for the Titans, but they are overwhelmed by sheer numbers, with all but Zeus and Poseidon being killed. Theseus kills Hyperion while Zeus collapses Mount Tartarus on the Titans. As the mountain is collapsing, Zeus picks up Athena's body and ascends to Olympus along with a badly wounded Poseidon. The collapsing mountain wipes out all of Hyperion's men. The mortally wounded Theseus is also transported to Olympus for his sacrifice and given a place among the gods.  Several years later, Theseus' story has become legend, and Phaedra has given birth to Theseus' son [[Acamas (son of Theseus)|Acamas]], a gift from the gods. Acamas, an oracle like his mother was, is met by Zeus in his old man persona, who informs the child that in the future, he too will one day fight against evil and that he mustn't fear his visions. Acamas sees a vision of the sky filled with thousands of gods and Titans fighting (including Zeus and a fully healed Poseidon) with Theseus leading the charge.

The Ides of March (2011 film)
 Stephen Meyers is the junior campaign manager for [[Governor (United States)|Governor]] Mike Morris, who is competing against [[United States Senator|Senator]] Ted Pullman in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary]]. Both campaigns are vying for the endorsement of Senator Franklin Thompson, who controls 356 [[Delegate#Democratic Party|delegate]]s that would clinch the nomination for either candidate. Meyers is asked by Pullman's campaign manager, Tom Duffy, to meet in secret. Meyers calls his boss, Morris campaign manager Paul Zara, who does not answer. Meyers decides to meet with Duffy, who offers him a position in Pullman's campaign; Meyers refuses. When Zara calls back, Meyers does not tell him about the meeting.   Meyers starts a sexual relationship with Molly Stearns, an attractive intern whose father is the chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]. Meyers admits to an angry Zara that he met with Duffy, who said that Pullman will offer Thompson the position of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in exchange for his endorsement. Zara and Meyers discuss the matter with Morris, saying they must make the same offer to Thompson. Morris refuses on principle, as he thoroughly disagrees with Thompson and his policies, and wants a "clean" campaign without such deals.  While Molly is sleeping, Meyers finds that Morris is trying to call her after he picks up her phone by mistake. He discovers that they had a brief sexual liaison several weeks previously, and Molly is now pregnant with Morris's child. Molly needs $900 for an [[abortion]], but cannot tell her father because her family is [[Catholicism|Catholic]]. Meyers helps her with the money but warns her not to tell anybody, and fires her from the campaign to make the problem go away. Ida Horowicz, a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', reveals to Meyers that an anonymous source leaked his meeting with Duffy, and plans to publish an article unless Meyers gives her the details about the Morris campaign's overtures to Thompson.  After dropping Molly off at the abortion clinic, Meyers goes to Zara for help. Zara reveals that he leaked the meeting to Ida with Morris' approval as a pretext for firing Meyers over his purported disloyalty. An angry and desperate Meyers then offers his services to Duffy, who admits he only met with Meyers to influence his opponent's operation under the likelihood that either Meyers would come to work for him or be fired for taking the meeting. Duffy apologizes for using Meyers and advises him to quit politics before he becomes a cynic like him. Meyers offers to sell out Morris but Duffy declines, believing Thompson's endorsement of Pullman is assured.   Having been told that Meyers had threatened to take down the campaign, Molly fatally overdoses on pills in a hotel room. Meyers comes across the scene and steals her phone. Unbeknownst to the Morris campaign, he meets with Thompson to set the conditions for his endorsement and his delegates. Meyers confronts Morris and gives him an [[ultimatum]]: either give him Zara's job and offer Thompson his post, or Meyers goes the press with Molly's purported [[suicide note]] and expose the affair. Morris relents, giving up what is left of his personal integrity, and meets Meyers' demands. Zara takes his firing philosophically and is amicable when he chats with Meyers at Molly's funeral.  Thompson officially endorses Morris, making him the ''de facto'' Democratic nominee. Now senior campaign manager, Meyers is on the way to a remote TV interview with [[John King (journalist)|John King]] when Ida ambushes him and says her next story will be about how Meyers delivered Thompson and his delegates and got his promotion. He reacts by having security bar her from coming any further. Meyers takes his seat for the interview, just as Morris finishes a speech about how "integrity and dignity" matter, and is asked for insight as to how the events surrounding the primary unfolded.

In Darkness and in Light
 The film is a tale about a small band of contumacious boys and girls that live in a hidden village on a faraway beach; they are the Ivory Rebellion, a feral group of children that are fighting from oppression against an evil queen named Johanna, and her ruthless Onyx Empire. Like Peter Pan & The Lost Boys, the rebels have shunned society and live completely free of parents and authority figures. Their existence, albeit a simple one, is entirely devoid of technology, minus simple firearms and an ancient tube radio. Surrounding their beach is a border, the land across from which is forbidden and belongs to the Onyx Empire. For the longest time a treaty was set forth, stating that no one from either side shall cross said border, but in a last-ditch effort to induct the boys and girls of the Ivory Rebellion, Queen Johanna has halted all supply shipments into their village. The rebels are running low on food, and with the threat of starvation, are forced to make a decision that could cost them everything.  
In the Land of Blood and Honey
 In [[Sarajevo]], 1992, Ajla Ekmečić is an ethnic [[Bosniak]] artist and single mother of an infant child. One evening, she meets her boyfriend, ethnic [[Serb]] police officer Danijel Vukojević, at a club. They enjoy the evening together, but many of the patrons are killed and Danijel is badly injured when the club is destroyed by artillery fire, signifying the opening salvo of the [[Bosnian War]].  Some months later, Ajla and her sister Lejla prepare to flee the now [[Siege of Sarajevo|besieged]] city, but their neighborhood is occupied by the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] before they can escape. The men are separated from the women, and then taken away to be executed, while Ajla and several other younger, more attractive women are taken away on buses to a Serb [[Rape during the Bosnian War|rape camp]].   In the camp, the soldiers instruct the women on what life will be like and then ask the women what sort of duties they can perform. A doctor named Esma volunteers to perform medical services but an officer rapes her in front of the other women to demoralize them. Before another soldier can do the same to Ajla, the camp's commander takes her away, where it is revealed he is none other than Danijel.   The former couple struggle to grasp the magnitude of their predicament, especially given that inter-ethnic relationships are forbidden, and any evidence of such a relationship could compromise both Danijel and his father Nebojša, a General of the [[General Staff of the Army of Republika Srpska|VRS Main Staff]]. Danijel ultimately agrees to shelter her from sexual abuse at the hands of the other soldiers under the pretense of her being his "personal property." They begin an intense love affair, but Ajla is deeply disturbed by the horrors of the camp, and she subsequently makes numerous attempts to escape, all of which fail. The escape attempts greatly anger Danijel and compound his paranoia; he frequently lashes out at her.  Danijel's unit is involved in [[ethnic cleansing]] massacres directed by Nebojša, although these tactics do little to change the situation at the front line. A frustrated Nebojša learns of Ajla's existence and the special treatment she receives; he chastises his son for being affectionate towards "the enemy." Danijel remains coy, insisting he is doing his patriotic duty. Fearing the repercussions if their relationship is exposed, he allows Ajla to escape.   Ajla shelters herself in the forest outside the city, where she is found by Bosniak guerrilla forces, who take her back to their camp. In the camp, she happily reunites with Lejla, though this happiness is short-lived when Lejla informs her that her baby died some months earlier, sending her into inconsolable grief. Over a campfire, the guerrillas lament the paradoxical insanity of the war, one in particular pointing out that he feels he hates Serbs, yet his own mother is a Serb. Lejla blames Danijel, who has gained notoriety for his prominence in the siege amongst the anti-Serb forces. At this moment, Ajla informs the camp she was his prisoner, and the guerrillas concoct a plan for her to return to the camp and act as a [[mole (intelligence)|mole]].   Ajla returns to the camp claiming it's the safest place for her, leading a confused but grateful Danijel to rekindle their relationship. Shortly after her return, a soldier in the camp, Darko, is killed by an [[improvised explosive device]], orphaning his infant child. Nebojša, learning of her return, immediately suspects her involvement. While Danijel is at the front line, Nebojša visits Ajla and orders her to paint a portrait of him. While she paints, he criticizes the "Muslim decadence" of such a career, which contrasts starkly with his own mother, a lifelong farm labourer widowed during [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]]. Ajla counters that her grandfather was a [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]], and that he taught her as a child that the constituent peoples of [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] are all equal irrespective of ethnicity. Nebojša smirks at her observation then leaves her alone with a soldier, Petar, who violently rapes her.   Danijel returns from the front line to find a distraught Ajla crying in the shower. Believing that she has cheated on him, he assaults her, but then sees his father's unfinished portrait and knows what has transpired. Danijel lures Petar to a hill above the city, then kills him. He then confronts his father, who attacks him and berates him for disgracing the family, saying "your mother would turn over in her grave if she knew you liked to fuck Muslim whores."  A sense of normalcy descends on Ajla and Danijel up until the events at [[Srebrenica Genocide|Srebrenica]]. As [[NATO]] forces prepare to launch an [[Operation Deliberate Force|offensive]] against the Serbs, Nebojša convenes a meeting with other commanders at a church. Danijel narrowly avoids being killed alongside his father when a massive explosion destroys the church (whether or not Ajla had a role in the attack is left ambiguous).  In conjunction with the bombing, [[ARBiH]] forces simultaneously launch a counter-offensive. Danijel hastily organizes his troops to halt their advance, but the Serb forces are decimated and most of his men are killed. Danijel returns to the now abandoned camp and finds Ajla patiently waiting. Believing she helped orchestrate the attack, he beats her, then shoots and kills her.   Danijel wanders through the wreckage of the city, which is now near liberation. Perhaps realizing what the war has driven him to become, and that it was all for nothing, he breaks down in tears on the street. [[UNPROFOR]] personnel arrest him shortly afterwards.  
In Darkness (2011 film)
 ''In Darkness'' is a dramatization of a rescue of Jewish refugees during World War II in the German-occupied city Lwów (Lemberg in German, L'viv in Ukrainian). For over a year, a Polish Catholic sewer maintenance worker and burglar, [[Leopold Socha]] along with his friend and co-worker [[Szczepek Wróblewski]], hid and cared for a group of Polish Jews who had escaped the massacres and deportations during the liquidation of the [[Lwów Ghetto]]. At first the men demand daily payment for their help but they continue to aid the group long after the Jews' money has run out and aiding them had become ever more dangerous. The Jewish ghetto had been established in 1941 and the Nazis decided to liquidate it in June 1943. The Soviets took over Lwów city in July 1944, by which point Socha's band made up 10 of the fewer than 1,000 surviving Jews in the city. Socha's and Wróblewski's actions and those of their wives led to their recognition as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] recipients.  
In Love and War (2011 film)
 In a remote village called Seokjeongni, the residents manage to learn that North Korean troops have invaded the South via the chief’s radio. Normalcy nevertheless continues for the villagers, who are all preoccupied with more pressing matters: an arranged wedding. Just a few days before the ceremony the groom is forced to flee when news breaks that Northern troops are fast capturing cities and annihilating anticommunist activists. But Seol-hee ([[Jung Ryeo-won]]) has no time to brood over her missing, beloved husband-to-be. North Korean troops arrive in town and announce their holy mission to "liberate" the Southerners.  As the chief's granddaughter and town's only schoolteacher, Seol-hee must remain strong — but instead of resisting the unwelcome guests she joins the town's intricate survival scheme and zealously embraces the [[Marxist]] teachings. Hot-tempered widower Jae-chun ([[Yoo Hae-jin]]), quiet yet clever Baek ([[Kim Sang-ho (actor)|Kim Sang-ho]]), and even Seol-hee's unassuming grandfather ([[Byun Hee-bong]]) manage to feign unwavering loyalty. Then a rivalry ensues between Seokjoengni and a neighboring village to host the construction of a bomb shelter under the soldiers' supervision.  Meanwhile, the troop's officer, Jung-woong ([[Kim Joo-hyuk]]), is propelled by an ulterior motive. He wants to find the charming young girl he met twelve years ago when Korea was one country.  What begins as a facade, however, develops into genuine and strong feelings among people who would have been neighbors if it hadn't been for geopolitics. Obvious signs of intensely pure [[romantic love]] also blossom between Jung-woong and Seol-hee, but the peaceful coexistence proves all too fragile amid the realities of war.<ref></ref>

Searching the internet, John finds that Roxy's life hasn't been very well documented and comes across very little other than an unofficial fan page for the rock star. The owner of the site, Larry, agrees to meet with John but his mental instability becomes visibly clear during the interview and John decides to make a quick exit after obtaining the information he needed. John tracks down Archie Murno, a pub landlord who gave Roxy his first taste of music fame when he persuaded him to take part in a karaoke night. Archie gives John a history of Roxy's troubled upbringing on Pishi Island where the local economy was decimated by the actions of British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Without adequate means to make a living on the island, Roxy moved to Glasgow and managed to transform his life through his love for music. During the interview, John discovers for the first time that Roxy was in fact signed by two record companies instead of one. The first record label was run by Hector 'Blitzkrieg' Wallace who was a Nazi sympathiser and forced Roxy to sing songs about hatred. Roxy's time with Blitzkrieg was brief as he later jumped ship to Met Records run by Gary Pringle.  After speaking with both of Roxy's managers, John is made aware of Roxy's various battles with depression which often lead to long stays at rehabilitation units. Moving from sofa to sofa, Roxy's last known appearance was with his old roadie friend Shimmy Quiffer. Shimmy explains to John that he had been staying with him for six months during the early 1990s but upon returning home one day, Roxy was packed up ready to go but couldn't tell Shimmy where he was going. Thinking the trail has gone cold, John receives an unopened letter from Shimmy that arrived for Roxy shortly after his departure. The letter is written by Alex H. Croy, an old friend of Roxy telling him that the pair should meet up as he is now staying in a hospice not far from Shimmy's location.  John visits the hospice in the hope of meeting his idol but his hopes are dashed when it is revealed that Roxy La Che had died in 2002, twenty years after the release of his first album.

 Teenage friends [[Will McKenzie]], [[Simon Cooper (The Inbetweeners)|Simon Cooper]], [[Jay Cartwright]], and [[Neil Sutherland (The Inbetweeners)|Neil Sutherland]] have finished their [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] and are about to leave Rudge Park Comprehensive, much to the relief of [[Mr. Gilbert]], their [[Sardonicism|sardonic]] head of [[sixth form]]. Within their final week of school, Jay's grandfather dies; Simon is dumped by his girlfriend [[Carli D'Amato]]; Neil has a job as a fishmonger in a supermarket and Will's estranged father tells him that he has married his much younger mistress (who was responsible for Will's parents' divorce and is only four years older than Will). The boys decide to go on holiday together and Neil books them a holiday to [[Malia, Crete]].  The boys arrive in Crete and are disappointed by their shabby hotel. There, they meet Richard, a strange man who travelled to Malia alone. The boys reach the main strip and are amazed. They meet an attractive promoter who tricks them into visiting a quiet, unpopular bar. As they are about to leave, they meet four girls: Alison, Lucy, Lisa, and Jane. They dance in comical fashion until Will asks if they can join them. Will mocks Alison's Greek waiter boyfriend until he realises she isn't joking; Simon complains to Lucy about Carli leaving him and Neil and Lisa sit in silence before he goes off with an unattractive, middle aged Northern woman. Jay and Jane seem to get on but he tells her he already has a girl waiting outside for him (the one who duped them into going into the bar). Their initial meeting does not go smoothly, but the girls arrange to meet the boys at their hotel the next day. Outside the bar, Jay gets into an argument with the promoter after he tries to seduce her and Simon sees Carli across the street and talks awkwardly with her before being knocked down by a [[All-terrain vehicle|quad-bike]] driven by James, a cocky and arrogant club rep and Carli's new love interest. She reveals that she is going to an all-day boat party later in the week, and Simon promises to meet her there.  The next day, Will and Simon awaken to the noise of Neil having getting oral sex from the middle aged woman and find Jay had fallen asleep outside in an ant hill. The boys meet the girls at their hotel, only to be asked to leave after Will gets into an argument with the family of a disabled girl (as Jay had thrown their towels off of vacant sunbeds and into the pool), causing him to go into one of his rants and Jay throws a Greek child who can't swim into the pool. Jay and Simon get into an argument over Simon's continuing obsession with Carli and Jay's continual false bravado and they brawl in the street, embarrassingly until Will and Neil separate the pair. Desperate to buy a ticket for the boat party to try to reconcile with Carli, Simon naively sells all of his clothes to James, including the clothes that he is wearing, but receives no payment for it after waiting hours for him to "return". Meanwhile, Jay angrily tears up two of the four boat party tickets that he secretly bought for all of them the previous night as a surprise. Jay and Neil then go to a club where they see a man on stage performing autofellatio. They then encounter James and his friends and try to break the ice and befriend them, but James brushes them away and verbally abuses the pair and threatens to hurt Jay if they don't leave. Later that evening, the four boys meet back at the empty bar and make up. Simon borrows clothing from the others for the rest of the trip. The girls then turn up and suggest that they all go [[skinny dipping]] at the local beach. Jane attempts to kiss Jay, but when two men poke fun at her over her weight and Jay pulls away embarrassed, she leaves him behind. Will has better luck with Alison until she spots her boyfriend, Nicos, having sex with another woman, and she leaves distraught by what she's witnessed. In the sea, Lucy and Simon appear to be growing closer, and are about to kiss, but Simon sees Carli on the beach and leaves Lucy alone in the sea, angering her. The boys, feeling down, decide to go out and get drunk.  The following day, Will is hungover and the group meet the girls again at the beach. Alison gives Will Nicos' ticket, while Simon apologises to Lucy, and she offers him her boat party ticket so that he can be with Carli. On board, Simon witnesses an argument between Carli and James. Carli then kisses Simon passionately, and he is elated, until he realises that she is just using him to make James jealous. Finally seeing Carli for her true colours, he ditches her. Meanwhile, Jay apologises to Jane and they start a relationship as do Will and Alison, and Neil and Lisa. Later Jay and Jane encounter James who mocks Jane's weight and demands a €20 note from Jay so that he can snort cocaine. Jay gets revenge on him by taking a note that was secretly concealed in his anus for bribing "corrupt foreign police", and gives it to James. James then snorts cocaine unknowingly walking around with faeces suck to the end of his nose causing the girls whom he flirts with to walk away from him in disgust, much to his confusion. Lisa and Neil dryhump on the boatdeck but Lisa feels bad about Neil's girlfriend till he lies and tells her she dumped him before the holiday and that he was embarrassed to tell the others. Simon finally sees that Lucy is more worthy of his attention than Carli, and knowing that he has been less than kind to her, he decides to swim back to shore as a romantic gesture, but he struggles and nearly drowns. As he is loaded into an air ambulance and taken back to the beach, Lucy kisses him and they reconcile. After the boat party is finished, the other boys and girls visit Simon in hospital, and after his recovery, they all spend the rest of their holiday together as couples. The group finally return to England in tears (although the girls aren't). At the airport, the girls come through the same gate as the boys and meet the boy's parents before Neil quickly runs away after spotting his girlfriend who he had cheated on with Lisa. In the final scene before the credits, a drunken Mr. Gilbert is seen riding a [[quad bike]] through the streets of Malia in his boxer shorts with a [[Necktie|tie]] tied around his head in a [[John Rambo]] style.  
In Time
   In 2169, people are [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to stop aging on their 25th birthday. Everyone then develops a countdown on their forearm set for a year. When the clock reaches zero, that person "times out", or dies. Time has thus become the universal currency, and can be transferred between people or within "time capsules". Two major areas exist within [[Ohio]]: Dayton, a poor manufacturing area, and Greenwich, which is called New Greenwich, where people have enough time to essentially be immortal.  Will Salas is a Dayton factory worker living with his mother Rachel. He rescues a drunken man named Henry Hamilton from an attempted robbery by a gang of time-robbing thugs led by Fortis. Hamilton reveals to Will that the people of New Greenwich hoard most of the time for themselves to live forever, while constantly increasing the cost of living keeps poorer people dying. The next morning, Hamilton transfers 116 years of his time to the sleeping Will, before timing out and falling off a bridge. Raymond Leon, leader of the police-like Timekeepers erroneously assumes that Will played a part in Hamilton's death.  Will visits his best friend Borel. Borel warns him that having so much time within Dayton will get him killed. Will gives Borel ten years in return for their years of friendship before meeting his mother to leave for New Greenwich. Rachel uses all but 90 minutes of her time to pay off a 2-day loan and finds herself short for a bus fare to get home. She urges the bus driver to lend her 30 minutes, but he refuses and advises her to run. She dies in Will's arms before he can lend her time.  In New Greenwich, Will visits a casino and meets time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis and his daughter Sylvia. While playing poker with Weis, Will comes dangerously close to timing out but eventually wins more than a millennium in a flawless gamble. Sylvia, impressed, invites him to a party in the Weis mansion. Will buys a new sports car and drives himself to the party. After a quick dance, down at their private beach Will tempts Sylvia into a nude moonlit dip in the waves (her first brush with danger). Once back indoors, Will is surprised by the Timekeepers, there to arrest him.  Dismissing Will's claim of innocence, Raymond confiscates all but two hours of his time. When asked why he is investigating a suicide, instead the Timekeeper insinuates he knew Will's father. Left with little choice, Will takes Sylvia as a hostage and drives back to Dayton. They are ambushed by Fortis' gang, crash the car and are left with 30 minutes each. Will attempts to get some time back from Borel, but his wife Greta tells him that he has drunk himself to death, blaming Will for the stupidity of his generosity. Sylvia pawns her diamond earrings for extra time, and Will calls Weis to demand a 1,000 year ransom (to be paid into the time-mission for the desperate). When Weis refuses to pay, Will releases Sylvia anyway. She calls Weis from a pay phone, but they are ambushed by Raymond, whom Sylvia shoots in the arm to protect Will. They steal his car, and Will gives Raymond enough time to survive.  Will and Sylvia team up and rob Weis' time banks, giving the extra time capsules to the needy. After a decade reward is offered for their capture, Fortis' gang tracks them down to a hotel room. Fortis challenges Will to a "time-duel", which Will wins through a trick used by his father. Will shoots the rest of the gang while they are distracted by Fortis' death. The pair soon realize they cannot steal enough time to significantly change anything, as New Greenwich simply raises prices on Daytoners.  They rob Weis' personal vault and obtain a one-million-year capsule. Raymond chases them back to Dayton but is too late to stop them from distributing the stolen time. After chasing them to the city's outskirts, Raymond reveals that he came from Dayton and intends to stop other Daytoners escaping. He realizes too late that he forgot to collect his daily time allotment and times out. Will and Sylvia, each with just over a minute to live, race to Raymond's patrol car. Will collects Raymond's daily share and runs back to Sylvia in a scene reminiscent of his mother's death. This time, he saves her when her clock only has seconds left.  TV reports show factories in Dayton shutting down as everyone has enough time and abandon their jobs to go to New Greenwich. Will and Sylvia continue robbing banks as part of their efforts to crash the system, while the rich attempt to cope with the sudden surge of people infiltrating their zone.

 Claire ([[Sara Paxton]]) and Luke ([[Pat Healy (actor)|Pat Healy]]) are two young employees at the [[Yankee Pedlar Inn]], a once-grand hotel that is about to close. Claire and Luke are the only employees working during its final weekend of operation. Claire, who suffers from severe [[asthma]], has recently dropped out of college, and Luke runs a website chronicling the hotel's supposed hauntings. Both are [[ghost hunting]] enthusiasts and are fascinated by the hotel's supposedly haunted history, which includes the legend of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who hanged herself in the 1800s when her fiancé 'jilted her at the altar' and whose body was supposedly hidden in the basement by the hotel owners.  That afternoon, Luke checks in an older woman, whom Claire recognizes as Leanne Rease-Jones ([[Kelly McGillis]]), a former actress who is in town for an unnamed convention. While delivering towels to her room, Claire is starstruck and has an awkward encounter with Leanne, who is initially relatively cold toward her. The following night, while taking out the garbage, Claire notices Leanne watching from her hotel window. Claire waves to her, but Leanne ignores her and moves away from the window without acknowledging her. Claire hears noises coming from the hotel's garage, where there is a door leading to the basement. She padlocks the door and returns inside. She uses Luke's ghost-hunting equipment to record [[Electronic voice phenomenon|EVP]]s in various places around the hotel. While recording, she hears faint voices and music, and sees the grand piano in the lobby play by itself.  She runs into Leanne in the hallway. Leanne reveals she is actually in town for a [[psychic]]s' convention and that she has left her career as an actress to become a [[mediumship|medium]]. She warns Claire not to go into the basement. Early that morning, Claire awakens to Madeline's apparition in her room. Later that day, an elderly man arrives and asks for a room on the third floor. Luke explains that the third floor rooms have been stripped of their furniture due to the hotel's impending closing. However, Claire offers to provide the man with a set of sheets as the rooms still have their beds, and she takes him to the honeymoon suite he requested.  Luke and Claire decide to investigate the basement where Madeline's corpse was hidden. There they encounter disembodied voices and other paranormal activity and Luke becomes so frightened that he leaves the hotel. In a state of panic, Claire awakens Leanne and asks for help. Leanne goes to the bottom of the basement stairwell, where she makes contact with a spirit and then tells Claire that they need to leave the hotel immediately. Claire rushes upstairs to retrieve the elderly man, but upon entering his room, she finds a [[suicide note]] and discovers his body in the bathtub, his wrists slashed, with Madeline's apparition hanging from a rope. Panicked, she runs downstairs and finds that Luke has returned to the hotel. He goes upstairs to find Leanne and Claire hears more noises coming from the basement. She approaches the stairwell, where she is startled by an apparition of the elderly man. She falls down the staircase, injuring her head.   Disoriented by her head injury, Claire is followed by the elderly man into the basement and finds herself in the room where Madeline's body was kept. She tries to open the door that leads to the garage, forgetting she had locked it. Confronted by Madeline's apparition, Claire dies of an [[asthma attack]]. The next morning, Luke tells police he heard Claire's screams coming from the cellar but could not open the door to save her. Luke and Leanne leave with the police. Leanne tells Luke that Claire couldn't have been saved.  The film ends with a view of Claire's empty room where a barely-visible apparition of Claire appears, looking out the window. As she turns towards the viewer, the door slams shut by itself.

In order to make ends meet, the three also work in the cafeteria of an asylum for the criminally insane along with William (Marcus Garvey). George is the head chef and puts effort into preparing high quality food and being courteous to the inmates. The inmates are generally docile due to the pills they take, but one inmate in particular named Harry Green ([[Richard Brake]]) creeps George out. One morning after a late-night rock show, an exhausted George has to come in early to work in a torrential downpour.  Many bad omens occur, with the chicken meat still attached to the heads, George cutting himself, and later, he loses his temper at both his bandmates and Harry, who stares menacingly at him. George also thinks that he sees Harry convince a fellow inmate to spit out his pills. Max tells George to take a nap while he prepares dinner. A few hours later, however, an explosion is heard and Max wakes George up to tell him that the power has gone out in the building. Because the exterior doors are electronically locked, everyone is now trapped inside the building. Many of the inmates have already been brought into the dining room for dinner service and the head guard enlists George and William to help escort them back to their cells.  Unknown to those in the kitchen, several other inmates have seized the opportunity to overtake and kill the prison guards and nurses on the other side of the building. George and William succeed in getting the inmates to their cells, but they see that the inmates are growing restless and the locks on all the doors are not working. When they return to the kitchen, they find the head guard has disappeared and Ricky and Max have barricaded themselves in the freezer. Suddenly, several inmates walk into the dining area and begin trying to break into the kitchen. Max, William, and George manage to sneak out of the kitchen after the inmates break in, but Ricky refuses to come with them and remains barricaded in the freezer.  George sees Harry smiling at all of the mayhem, appearing to be the ringleader of the riots. The threesome run around the asylum, finding the head guard decapitated. They eventually make their way to the head guard's office and use the landline phone to call the police, but are told that the police will be unable to respond for at least an hour. Eventually, the prisoners capture Ricky and fatally impale him in front of George, Max, and William. At Harry's urging, the inmates storm the head guard office, although the cooks manage to kill all of the ones who attack however, Max's nose is bitten off in the struggle.  The three flee back to the kitchen, but eventually George is knocked out and Max is captured. When George awakens, he is naked and tied to a table. George is forced to watch as inmates burn Max alive on the stove top. One inmate also begins mutilating George, though eventually George convinces him to leave him alone. George is finally confronted by Harry, who begins to gleefully eat his own fingers. George screams at Harry to end the madness to no avail. George hears police sirens and soon, William leads the police into the kitchen, but Harry has disappeared.  As the medics begin wheeling George out of the asylum, he looks over to see the corpse of Harry, with all his fingers intact, apparently having been killed at the very beginning of the riot. Apparently, George has hallucinated Harry's presence throughout the night. The film jumps ahead to focus on George in a bed while Lynn cries at his side. George has a vacant expression, having seemingly been driven mad by his experience. The camera zooms into George's mind where he is still working in the cafeteria with his bandmates, and the inmates are still on the loose.

Driss learns the extent of Philippe's disability and accompanies Philippe in every moment of his life, assisting him in all the ways needed. A friend of Philippe's reveals Driss's criminal record which includes six months in jail for robbery. Philippe states he does not care about Driss's past because he is the only one that does not treat him with pity. He says he will not fire him as long as he does his job properly.  Philippe discloses to Driss that he became disabled following a [[paragliding]] accident and that his wife died without bearing children. Gradually, Philippe is led by Driss to put some order in his private life, including being stricter with his adopted daughter Elisa. Driss discovers [[modern art]], [[opera]] and even takes up [[painting]].  For Philippe's birthday, a private concert of classical music is performed in his living room. Feeling that the concert is too boring, Driss plays [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]'s "[[Boogie Wonderland]]", resulting in a less boring birthday for Philippe with the guests also enjoying the music.  Driss discovers that Philippe has a purely [[Letter (message)|epistolary]] relationship with a woman called Eléonore, who lives in [[Dunkirk]]. Driss encourages him to meet her, but Philippe fears her reaction when she discovers his disability. Driss eventually convinces Philippe to talk to Eléonore on the phone. Philippe agrees with Driss to send a photo of him in a [[wheelchair]] to her, but he hesitates and asks his aide, Yvonne, to send a picture of him as he was before his accident. A date between Eléonore and Philippe is agreed. At the last minute, Philippe is too scared to meet Eléonore and leaves with Yvonne before Eléonore arrives. Philippe then calls Driss and invites him to travel with him in his [[Dassault Falcon 900]] private jet for a paragliding weekend in the [[Alps]].  Adama, Driss's younger cousin, who is in trouble with a gang, comes to fetch Driss at Phillipe's mansion on the pretext of delivering mail. Overhearing, Philippe recognizes Driss's need to be supportive to his family and releases him from his job, suggesting he may not want to push a wheelchair all his life.  Driss returns to his urban projects, joining his friends and manages to help his younger cousin. In the meantime, Philippe has hired caregivers to replace Driss, but he is not happy with any of them. His morale is very low and he stops taking care of himself. He grows a beard and looks ill. Yvonne becomes worried and contacts Driss, who arrives and decides to drive Philippe in the [[Maserati]], which brings the story back to the first scene of the film, the police chase. After they have eluded the police, Driss takes Philippe to the seaside. Upon shaving and dressing elegantly, Philippe and Driss arrive at a [[Cabourg]] restaurant with a great ocean view. Driss suddenly leaves the table and says good luck to Philippe for his lunch date. A few seconds later, Eléonore arrives. Emotionally touched, Philippe looks through the window and sees Driss outside, smiling at him. Driss bids Philippe farewell and walks away as Phillipe and Eleonore chat and enjoy each other's company.  The film ends with shots of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou, the people on whom the film is based, together on a hillside, reminiscent of the paragliding scene earlier in the film. The closing caption states how the men remain close friends to this day.

Ironclad (film)
 A prologue describes how the barons of [[Kingdom of England|England]], aided by the [[Knights Templar]], fought against tyrannical [[John, King of England|King John]] in a [[First Barons' War|war]] that lasted more than three years. It ended with the King signing the [[Magna Carta]], a document granting rights to all English [[franklin (class)|freemen]].  King John regrets succumbing to the pressure of the barons to sign the Magna Carta.  Soon after, he hires an army of pagan [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] mercenaries under the leadership of a warlord, Captain Tiberius, to restore John's absolute authority over the kingdom, under the presumption that the [[Pope]] has agreed to keep Christian missionaries out of their lands in [[Denmark]].  The Abbot Marcus leads three Templar knights (who have taken vows of silence) on a pilgrimage to [[Canterbury]] and they take shelter from the rain at Darnay Castle. One of the knights, Thomas Marshall, is assured by the [[abbot]] that Marshall's release from the Templar Order will be sought at Canterbury. By morning, King John arrives at the castle with his army and mercenaries. Baron Darnay signed the Magna Carta and in retribution John orders him hanged. The Abbot attempts to intervene and the King orders that the abbot's tongue be cut off. Marshall and the two other knights fight the Danes, during which Marshall escapes the castle on horseback carrying the abbot; the two knights left behind are slain. The abbot dies before night of his wound, and Marshall breaks his vow of silence to swear that his sacrifice will not be in vain.  Once he has reached [[Canterbury]], Marshall meets with [[Stephen Langton|Archbishop Langton]], the author of the Magna Carta, and Baron [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]], a former soldier turned wool merchant. Langton reveals that the Pope has sided with King John and that he himself is to be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for writing the Magna Carta. The three men agree that John must be stopped, and that the place to do so is [[Rochester Castle]], the seat of Baron Cornhill and a strategic stronghold that controls southern England and allows access to [[London]] and the rest of the country.  [[File:Rochester Castle, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1582414.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Rochester Castle]]]] Aubigny persuades three of his men to join him, including his squire, Guy, and a petty criminal named Jedediah, but a fourth turns down the baron's call to arms. A party of seven finally leaves for [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] where, on arriving, they discover several Danish mercenaries have already claimed the [[Rochester Castle|castle]]; the fourth man had betrayed them to the king. Aubigny's party fights and kills the Danes, and then claim Rochester Castle in the name of the rebellion, much to the displeasure of Cornhill. When John's army finally arrives and lays siege to Rochester, the garrison holds fast and manages to beat the initial Danish assault. In the aftermath, Aubigny offers his men leave if they wish; none accept.  A second assault sees the Danes' siege tower destroyed by a [[trebuchet]] crafted by the defenders from within the castle. John's forces then attempt to starve out the defenders. The Archbishop is informed that Prince Louis is biding his time in France and negotiating with John, and sets off in haste to expedite affairs. As the season turns to winter, the hunger of the castle's occupants continue; Marshall leaves the castle under cover of night and then returns ahead of his pursuers with food stolen from the Danish camp. The castle morale is bolstered by Marshall's act and he gives in to the advances of Cornhill's young wife Isabel, breaking his Templar vows.  The Danish leader, Tiberius, threatened by John to take the castle or risk the King reneging on their bargain, adopts a different approach in his next attack and manages to sneak a small force of men over the walls before dawn to open the castle gates from within. Guy discovers the infiltrators and sounds the alarm, but it is too late. Tiberius leads the charge into the castle grounds while his Danes slaughter the garrison. During the chaos, d'Aubigny is wounded and left behind in the chaos of the retreat. Marshall recovers in time to don his knight's battle armour and charge the Danes on his war-horse, buying time for the survivors to pull back to the keep.  Aubigny is dragged before the King and forced to watch as the hands of two prisoners are chopped off. After a defiant verbal exchange with John, he is subjected to the same fate and then hurled by the castle trebuchet into a [[keep]] wall. Cornhill tries to surrender but is stopped; he goes instead upstairs to his bedroom and hangs himself. John's engineers have been preparing a mine under the keep's foundation, and they have a herd of pigs brought and put in the mine which is then stoked, set afire and the animal fat used to damage the keep's foundation, causing it to collapse; as the keep's walls come down, the final assault begins.  The last defenders are killed except Guy, Isabel and Marshall, the latter knocked unconscious by falling rubble. Guy goes out to die fighting where he encounters Tiberius and is almost killed, until a recovered Marshall intervenes. Tiberius challenges Marshall to single combat, and Marshall triumphs after a long and savage duel. Horns are heard in the distance as the combined English rebel and [[Kingdom of France|French]] army arrives at last, and John and the remaining Danes disperse in panic. Marshall meets Prince Louis and Archbishop Langton at the castle gates; the latter tells him that he is now free of the Templar Order. Acknowledging England's new king with a nod, Marshall rides off with Isabel, while Guy tells his dead baron that "We held".  The epilogue describes King John's death during his retreat and the reconstruction of [[Rochester Castle]], and how it, like the [[Magna Carta]], still stands.

She remembers her struggle, as a young lower-middle class woman, to break into a snobbish male-dominated Conservative Party and find a seat in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], along with businessman [[Denis Thatcher]]'s marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a "Lady Member" of the House, and as [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] in [[Edward Heath]]'s Cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with [[Airey Neave]], her decision to stand for Leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and eventual victory, and her voice coaching and image change.  Further flashbacks examine historical events during her time as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], after winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget (over the misgivings of "wet" members of her Cabinet – [[Ian Gilmour, Baron Gilmour of Craigmillar|Ian Gilmour]], [[Francis Pym, Baron Pym|Francis Pym]], [[Michael Heseltine]], and [[James Prior, Baron Prior|Jim Prior]]), the [[1981 Brixton riot]], the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|1984–1985 UK miners' strike]], and the [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing in Brighton]] of the [[Grand Hotel (Brighton)|Grand Hotel]] during the 1984 [[Conservative Party Conference]], when she and her husband were almost killed.

By 1990, Thatcher is shown as an imperious but ageing figure, ranting aggressively at her cabinet, refusing to accept that the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|"Poll Tax"]] is unjust, even while it is causing riots, and fiercely opposed to [[European Integration]]. Her deputy, [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigns after being humiliated by her in a cabinet meeting, Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership, and her loss of support from her cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but reluctantly to resign as Prime Minister after eleven years in office. A teary-eyed Thatcher exits [[10 Downing Street]] for the last time as Prime Minister with Denis comforting her. She is shown as still disheartened about it almost twenty years later.  Eventually, Thatcher is shown packing up her late husband's belongings, and telling him it's time for him to go. Denis' ghost leaves her as she cries that she actually is not yet ready to lose him, to which he replies "You're going to be fine on your own... you always have been" before leaving forever. Having finally overcome her grief, she contentedly washes a teacup alone in her kitchen despite saying it was a role she would never accept.

J. Edgar
  In 1919, after [[anarchist]]s attempt to assassinate Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], he puts his protegé [[J. Edgar Hoover]] in charge of a new division dedicated to purging radicals. Hoover quickly begins compiling a list of suspects. He meets [[Helen Gandy]], a new secretary at the Justice Department, and takes her to the [[Library of Congress]] to show her the card catalog system he devised. He makes an awkward pass at her, then proposes to her. She refuses him, but agrees to become his personal secretary.  Hoover finds that the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] refuses to deport anyone without evidence of a crime. Learning that [[Anthony Caminetti]], the Commissioner General of Immigration, dislikes the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]], Hoover arranges to make her eligible for deportation and thereby creates a precedent of deportation for radical conspiracy.  Following several such Justice Department [[Palmer Raids|raids]] of suspected radical groups, Palmer loses his job as Attorney General. His successor, [[Harlan F. Stone]], appoints Hoover as director of the Justice Department's new [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Bureau of Investigation]]. Hoover meets lawyer [[Clyde Tolson]], and hires him.  When the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] captures national attention, [[Herbert Hoover|President Herbert Hoover]] asks the Bureau to investigate. Hoover employs several novel techniques, including the monitoring of registration numbers on ransom bills and expert analysis of the kidnapper's handwriting. When the monitored bills begin showing up in [[New York City]], the investigators find a filling station attendant who wrote down the license plate number of the man who gave him the bill. This leads to the arrest, and eventual conviction, of [[Richard Hauptmann|Bruno Richard Hauptmann]] for the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh child.  After Hoover, Tolson, and Hoover's mother (with whom Hoover still lives) see the [[James Cagney]] film ''[[G Men]]'', Hoover and Tolson go out to a club, where Hoover is seated with [[Anita Colby]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and Rogers' mother Lela. Rogers' mother asks Hoover to dance and he becomes agitated, saying that he and Tolson must leave, as they have a lot of work to do in the morning. When he gets home, he tells his mother that he dislikes dancing with girls. She tells him she would rather he be dead than a "[[gay|daffodil]]". She insists on teaching him to dance, and they dance in her bedroom.  Hoover and Tolson go on a vacation to the [[horse race]]s. That evening, Hoover tells Tolson that he cares deeply for him, and Tolson tells Hoover that he loves him. Hoover panics and claims that he wants to marry [[Dorothy Lamour]]. Tolson accuses Hoover of making a fool out of him and they end up fighting on the floor. Tolson suddenly kisses Hoover, who says that must never happen again; Tolson says that it won't, and tries to leave. Hoover apologizes and begs him to stay, but Tolson threatens to end their friendship if Hoover talks about another woman again. After Tolson leaves, Hoover says that he loves him, too.  Years later, Hoover feels his strength begin to decline, while Tolson suffers a stroke. Hoover tries to blackmail [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] into declining his [[Nobel Peace Prize]], sending him a letter threatening to expose his extramarital affairs. King disregards this and accepts the prize.  Hoover tells Gandy to destroy his secret files after his death in order to prevent President [[Richard Nixon]] from possessing them. He visits Tolson, who urges him to retire. Hoover refuses, claiming that Nixon is going to destroy the bureau he has created. Tolson accuses Hoover of having exaggerated his involvement with key events of the Bureau. Moments later, Hoover tells Tolson that he needed Tolson more than he ever needed anyone else. He holds Tolson's hand, kisses his forehead, and leaves.  Hoover returns home from work, obviously weakened. Shortly after Hoover goes upstairs, his housekeeper calls Tolson, who goes to the house and finds Hoover dead next to his bed. A grief-stricken Tolson covers his friend's body. Nixon gives a memorial speech on television for Hoover, while several members of his staff enter Hoover's office and search through the cabinets and drawers in search of his rumored "confidential" files, but find nothing. In the last scene, Gandy destroys stacks of files.

Islands (film)
 The first scenes of the film are set in the historical center of the town of [[Termoli]]. A young illegal immigrant called Ivan is looking for a job. He is a bricklayer and lives in a small flat with his old and sick father. Precisely in with the intention to find a job he sets off to the [[Isole Tremiti]], [[Apulia]], but cannot not return as planned and had to extend his sojourn. There he meets two people who are going to help him. One is Don Enzo, an uncommon priest who lives in a small house and takes care of his bees. The other is Martina, a young woman who, since her daughter's death, has closed herself in silence, and lives in Don Enzo's house, her former tutor. Martina and Ivan become friends, and even don Enzo starts to feel some sympathy for the youngster.  The three protagonists have nothing in common, except for one thing: they live in isolation because they are different from other people. It is not by chance that the story takes place in an isolated place, in fact on islands. But precisely the fact of being different is at the origin of the mutual interest that over time becomes sympathy and friendship. In defining the [[Character (arts)|characters]] the director underscores the difference that often generates loneliness but may also bring people closer to one another. In a time where migration is a worldwide phenomenon Chiantini's analysis is interesting.  That description of the social relationship is completed by a last character, Father Enzo's sister. She is a selfish and greedy woman who, from the first instant, distrusts the young foreigner mainly because she is interested in the property of the Father. She symbolises the world around which is united against Ivan and Martina.

  Home videos show [[fraternal twins]] Jack and Jill Sadelstein growing up in New York City. Jack is the gifted twin, while Jill constantly tries—and fails miserably—to get his attention by injuring him and/or driving others away from him. In present-day Los Angeles, Jack is a successful advertising executive who lives with his wife Erin and their two kids Sofia and Gary, a Hindu child they adopted at birth. Jill never left the working-class neighborhood they grew up in; she recently inherited the Sadelstein home, having lived with their mother until her death a year ago.  As always, Jack is irritated by the upcoming [[Thanksgiving]] visit of his sister. Jill ruins Thanksgiving dinner by loudly embarrassing a homeless guest. Jack snaps at his sister, making Jill run into the woods with her pet [[cockatoo]] Poopsie. Erin demands that Jack apologize, which he unwillingly does. Jill has a list of things she wants to do while in Los Angeles: be on a game show (''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]'', which gives Jill a carload of prizes after she knocks herself out while spinning the wheel); go horseback riding (she proves too heavy for the pony, which collapses under her); and do a studio tour. Since Jill has an open-ended plane ticket, she decides to stay until after [[Hanukkah]], to Jack's horror. Jack encourages Jill to try [[online dating]], but she is unsuccessful until Jack alters her profile. When Jill's date "Funbucket" meets her, he hides in the men's room until she leaves the restaurant.  Jack's agency client, meanwhile, wants him to somehow get actor [[Al Pacino]] to appear in a [[Dunkin' Donuts]] commercial to promote a new coffee called the "Dunkaccino". Jack takes Jill to a [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] game where Pacino is supposed to be. Pacino ignores Jack but is taken with Jill and gives her his phone number. Jack hopes Jill will go home by [[New Year's Eve]], as the family is going on a cruise. Jack's friends and colleagues throw him a birthday party, extending the invite to Jill. Again Jill loudly disgraces herself, Jack, and the various celebrities in attendance. Pacino brings Jill to his home, but despite his infatuation with her, she is uninterested with him and soon leaves. Jack's Mexican gardener Felipe, also smitten with Jill, takes her to meet his family at their annual fiesta, where she hits it off with everybody, and tries Mexican food for the first time, acquiring a horrible case of [[diarrhea]].  Pacino refuses to do the commercial unless Jack gets him another date with Jill; to that end, Jack invites Jill on the cruise with his family. At sea, Jill refuses to see Pacino again, so Jack disguises himself as his sister and goes on her date with Pacino. Jill suspects that she was only invited just so Pacino would do the commercial; that is confirmed when she phones Jack, he answers as Jill, and hears Pacino in the background. Pacino, still believing Jack to be Jill, spells out that he sees Jill as an unrecognized woman proud of her brother's success. Feeling guilty, Jack returns to the ship, only to learn that Jill has gone back home to [[The Bronx]]. At a restaurant on New Year's Eve, toting a picture of her and Jack's late mother, Jill comes across a group of former classmates and bullies, led by Monica, who pick up directly where they left off until Jack, Erin and their kids show up. Jack and Jill converse in their made-up twin language (which even Jack finds incomprehensible). Monica attacks Erin and is cold cocked by Jill. Pacino also turns up at the party, dressed as the [[Man of La Mancha]], and tells Jill that while he has feelings for her, there is another man more worthy of her than himself. She goes home, where Felipe and his children await her arrival. Felipe professes his love for Jill, and the two begin a relationship.  The television commercial is made, with Pacino starring and singing a rap song. When Jack shows it to him, Pacino tells him to destroy every copy.

At the office one day Vaishakan comes in saying he wants to cancel his dreams of being a director and resume his job there. Priyadarshan becomes upset and goes to see Vaishakan and helps him get a producer.Priyadarshan is recommended by Meera, who is in love with him and his innocence. He makes changes in Vaishakan's script by making it heart touching about a father and son who live in a poor household.  Vaishakan quickly befriends Priyadarshan because with his help he got Achayan to sign the film to produce it. There on Priyadarshan and Meera fall deeply in love and meet quite often. One evening Meera's father ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]) come home buying Revathy (Sarayu) his friends daughter and Meera some dresses and she comes across a Saree. Meera's father informs her that his friend's son and family is coming over to see Meera for a proposal. Meera gets worried and refuses to get married, then Revathy tells Meera's father about Priyadarshan, in which he is not happy about. There becomes a conflict between Priyadarshan and Meera's father.  Priyadarshan gets upset and goes to his office asking some of them to come to Meera's house and show Meera's father that he has people who cares for him too. (Priyadarshan still believes Meera is a poor maid at that house.) There the head and Kannappan go to Meera's house, the head compliments about Priyadarshan to Meera's father believing that he is the house owner (not her father). The head says that it isn't right to marry off the maid to a wealthier man to Meera's father, Here Meera's father says that Meera is her daughter not the maid, and Priyadarshan didn't believe it at first thinking it was a drama to not give her to him until Meera admits it. Priyadarshan hearing this tears up then says "you were cheating me, weren't you?" and then apologizes to Meera's father. While Priyadarshan is about leave he says in tears that he has never lied to anyone and that he doesn't have many dreams but marrying Meera was the only dream in his life, which has been destroyed to the head. He leaves saying that he won't come to disrupt you again to Meera's father. There is a confusion drama in the end happening with Vysakhan falling for Revathy, who is actually from a poor household. Vaishakan comes to Meera's house believing that Meera's father was actually Revathy's father, but realizing she isn't he leaves and meets Achayan. Vaishakan questions Achayan about if he asked Priyadarshan to direct the film, Achayan replies saying the yes that was true. There shows a flashback With Priyadarshan and Achayan, in which Achayan says that he knew that the script that was presented to him was Priyadarshan's story and Achayan offers some money in advance for Priyadarshan to do the film. Also, Achayan says that [[Malayalam Cinema]] needs directors with good will, Priyadarshan replies if he takes this money and do this film. He'll have the money to pay back his father's loan but he wouldn't be a person with good will if he takes away the film Vaishakan intended on doing. Vaishakan realizes Priyadarshan's pure heart and tears up for thinking that he would take the film.  There it shows Priyadarshan leaving to his home in Thonakkad. While there he gets annoyed by comments hinting that he cheated the girl by the local people there. While reaching home he sees Revathy, was the one saying that she is his girl. He then tells everyone this is not his girl, then he realizes that he didn't fall in love with Meera the poor maid, but Meera the person within.  He sees a crowd of people and one man says that we all know that she isn't your girl, and they make way for Meera, her father, Vaishakan, the Head and Achayan.  The head says that you fell in love with her thinking that she was poor but she loved you knowing that your poor, so that shows she is in love with you more than you are in with her. Then Priyadarshan and Meera are seen going back to the city (showing that they got married) and there Vaishakan's car and production crew passes by, Vaishakan and Achayan wave at them and they wave back as the film ends.

There follow [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], to the ten-year-old Jane Eyre, an orphan, living with her late maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, at Gateshead Hall. Jane’s aunt, Sarah Reed, doesn't like Jane and is very cruel to her; Mrs. Reed's three children are also abusive towards her. One day, Jane is locked in the Red Room, where her uncle died, and which Jane believes is haunted. She knocks herself unconscious on the door, after a huge cloud of ash comes down the chimney.  Jane's aunt sends her to Lowood School for Girls, which is run by a cruel clergyman, Mr. Brocklehurst. Mrs. Reed tells him that Jane is a deceitful child and is not to be trusted. Jane tells her aunt how much she hates her and that she is a hard-hearted woman. At Lowood, while another pupil, Helen Burns, is being beaten, Jane accidentally drops her slate. Mr. Brocklehurst brands her a liar and makes her stand on a chair all day. Jane and Helen become close friends, but Helen later dies of consumption (tuberculosis).  Eight years later, Jane, now eighteen, leaves Lowood and takes up a post with Alice Fairfax of Thornfield Hall. She will be a [[governess]] to Adèle Varens, a young French girl who is Mr. Rochester's ward. When she first arrives at Thornfield, a gloomy, isolated mansion, Jane mistakes Mrs. Fairfax for her employer, but she finds out that she is only the housekeeper for her absent master. While Jane is walking into town to post a letter, a horse passes her and throws its rider. Jane helps the gentleman to his horse. Later, back at the mansion, she learns that the horse rider is Mr. Edward Rochester, master of the house. He jokingly tells her that she must have bewitched his horse to make him fall. They gradually fall for one another.  One night, Jane is awoken by a strange noise at her door, only to find that Mr. Rochester's room is on fire, which the two of them manage to extinguish. He thanks her for saving his life and holds her hand affectionately. The next day, Rochester leaves Thornfield to visit Lady Blanche Ingram, his future wife; he brings her back to Thornfield with him a few weeks later.  When a man named Richard Mason of [[Spanish Town]], [[Jamaica]], shows up, Jane can see that Rochester is disturbed. That night, a scream awakens everyone. Rochester assures his guests it is just a servant's reaction to a nightmare, but after they go back to their rooms, he secretly has Jane tend to a bleeding Mason while he fetches a doctor. Rochester has the doctor take Mason away.  Jane receives a letter from her old nurse, Bessie. Jane's cousin, John Reed, has committed suicide, the news of which has so shocked his mother, Sarah Reed, that it has brought on a stroke. Apparently, Mrs. Reed has been asking to see Jane. Jane returns to Gateshead, where her dying aunt shows her a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, John Eyre, asking for her to go to live with him in [[Madeira]]. He wants to adopt Jane and make her a beneficiary in his will. Jane notices that the letter was dated three years ago. Mrs. Reed admits to telling John Eyre that Jane had died of typhus at Lowood School. Mrs. Reed tells Jane that she feels cursed by her. Jane forgives her aunt and returns to Thornfield, having begun a correspondence with John Eyre.   Jane informs Rochester that she must leave Thornfield because of his impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. However, Rochester suddenly proclaims his love for Jane and proposes to her; they kiss passionately. During the wedding ceremony, Mr. Mason appears, along with a lawyer, declaring that Mr. Rochester cannot marry Jane because he is still married to Mr. Mason's sister, Bertha; he adds that his sister is still living at Thornfield Hall. Mr. Rochester admits this is true and takes Jane to meet his violently deranged wife, calling her his own demon; they find her locked away in a room at Thornfield. Rochester tells Jane that his father wanted him to marry Bertha for her money. Once they were married, he discovered that she was rapidly descending into [[Psychosis|madness]] and was forced to lock her away in Thornfield; she was the one responsible for the strange happenings in the house. Refusing to act against her principles, and despite her enduring love for Rochester, Jane leaves Thornfield in the middle of the night.  After struggling for days in poverty and starvation, Jane is discovered by a man called St. John Rivers, who saves her life by offering her food and shelter. After Jane regains her health, St. John goes on to find her a teaching position at a nearby charity school. One night, she hears knocking at her door and imagines it to be Rochester, but it turns out to be St. John at the door informing her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died, leaving her all his property and that she is rich, to the tune of £20,000 (). Jane offers to share the money with St. John and his sisters, suggesting that they live together at Moor House; they agree to the offer. St. John asks Jane to marry him and go with him to India. Jane agrees to go to India with him, but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting that they travel as brother and sister, as that's how she sees their relationship. On the moor, Jane suddenly hears Rochester's voice calling her name.  Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find the house a blackened ruin. She learns from Mrs. Fairfax that Rochester's wife set the house on fire and died, jumping from the roof. Jane finds Rochester, who has lost his eyesight in the fire. Jane reunites with him and they embrace.

He looks for his destiny in seemingly random occurrences. He finds inspiration in the feature film ''[[Signs (film)|Signs]]'', which reinforces his belief in this outlook. One day, he answers the telephone; it's a wrong number, from somebody asking for "Kevin," and Jeff contemplates the meaning of this, deciding it's a sign.  Receiving a call from his irritated mother asking him to buy [[wood glue]] to fix a door shutter or find a new place to live, Jeff boards a bus, where he sees a kid wearing a sports jersey bearing the name Kevin.  He follows Kevin (Ross) to a [[basketball court]], where he joins a pick-up game and the two bond.  Jeff agrees to smoke weed with Kevin, but discovers he has been tricked when he is beaten and mugged.  He happens upon a [[Hooters]] restaurant where he crosses paths with his older brother Pat (Helms), a successful [[yuppie]] struggling with a failing [[marriage in the United States|marriage]]. Pat's wife Linda (Greer) is spotted at a gas station across the street with another man. Jeff and Pat spend several hours following them, first to a restaurant and later to a hotel, with Pat's new [[Porsche]] being ticketed, crashed and eventually towed away at various points in the journey. The brothers also visit their father's gravesite and fight over their conflicting life philosophies.  Jeff sees a truck reading "Kevin Kandy" and runs off to hitch a ride, only to end up at the same hotel where Pat has found Linda in a room with [[adultery|another man]]. Jeff offers to break down the door. The man is a co-worker of hers named Steve (Zissis). Linda quickly ushers Steve out and then confronts Pat about his role in their problems.  Frustrated, she leaves, saying she will move in with her mother. Jeff and Pat reconcile. Jeff explains how he is struggling to find his destiny in life, while Pat admits he wants to fall in love with Linda again and for her to do the same with him.  Jeff encourages his brother to tell her that, and they hail a taxi to pursue her.  Interspersed within the main story is the story of Sharon, who is at work, frustrated with her unfulfilled life and dissatisfaction with her sons. The doldrum is interrupted when a paper airplane with a beautiful drawing of a flower lands in her cubicle, followed by an anonymous co-worker claiming in an instant message to be a secret admirer. Sharon spends the day trying to deduce the identity of her admirer. She confides her frustrations to colleague and friend Carol ([[Rae Dawn Chong|Chong]]), revealing that she has not dated since her husband's death. Carol encourages her to warm up to the attention she is receiving. Sharon is surprised and confused when the admirer turns out to be Carol herself, and though neither believe themselves to be attracted to [[lesbian|their own gender]], Carol appeals to Sharon's desire to become close with someone who truly understands her.  At that moment, a fire alarm goes off and ceiling sprinklers activate; this is an [[satori|enlightening moment]] for Sharon who sets off with Carol on a spur of the moment trip to [[New Orleans]].  Jeff, Pat, Linda, Sharon, and Carol all converge on a bridge, where they are stuck in standstill traffic.  Pat exits the taxi and runs through the traffic to tell Linda how he feels, passing Carol's car; Sharon sees her son and runs after him, followed by Carol.  As Jeff muses to the cab driver about seeking out his destiny only to find it isn't very exciting, he observes a helicopter flying overhead, jumps out of the taxi and also runs through the traffic, passing Pat, who was sharing his feelings with Linda when they were interrupted by the arrival of Sharon and Carol.  Jeff continues onward to discover that the cause of the traffic is an accident in which one car plummeted over the side of the bridge.  He dives into the water and rescues two children and their father; when Jeff then fails to resurface Pat dives in and rescues him.  The group reconciles after the ordeal, and the audience sees Sharon celebrating her birthday and Pat and Linda apparently faring better in their marriage.  Jeff sees a news report about his heroics and learns that the father of the kids he rescued was also named Kevin; now with a sense of purpose, he grabs some wood glue and fixes the door shutter.

Jock the Hero Dog
   
Johnny English Reborn
 [[Johnny English]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) has been training in [[Tibet]] following a botched mission in [[Mozambique]] when he is summoned by MI7. Under his new boss Pamela Thornton ([[Gillian Anderson]]), codename 'Pegasus', he is put on a mission to investigate a plot to assassinate the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] during scheduled talks with the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. He meets fellow agent and old acquaintance Simon Ambrose ([[Dominic West]]); MI7's resident quartermaster, Patch Quartermain ([[Tim McInnerny]]); and junior agent Colin Tucker ([[Daniel Kaluuya]]), who will be English's new assistant.  In [[Hong Kong]], English finds ex [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Titus Fisher ([[Richard Schiff]]), who reveals himself to be a member of Vortex, who were responsible for sabotaging English's [[Mozambique]] operation. Vortex holds a secret weapon that requires three metal keys to unlock. But when he reveals his key, Fisher is killed by a grey haired woman ([[Pik-Sen Lim]]) disguised as an apartment cleaner, and another guy steals the key.  English chases the thief across Hong Kong, but loses him when the culprit leaps over a ventilator. However, recalling his Tibetan training, English simply slips into the gap between the ventilator and a wall. He continues the chase by means of easy solutions to hazardous routes the thief takes - for example, when the criminal slowly climbs down bamboo scaffolding, English simply takes an [[elevator]]. However, on his flight back to London, English is tricked by another Vortex operative disguised as a flight attendant, and is humiliated in a meeting with the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and Pegasus when he attempts to present the key and the plans. He then mistakes Pegasus's mother to be the cleaner assassin and attacks her at Pegasus's daughter's birthday party.  Kate Sumner ([[Rosamund Pike]]), MI7's behavioral psychologist, uses [[hypnosis]] to help English recall his suppressed memory of the [[Mozambique]] incident, revealing another Vortex operative, Russian spy Artem Karlenko ([[Mark Ivanir]]), who is masquerading as millionaire Sergei Pudovkin. English and Tucker meet Karlenko at an exclusive golf course outside London. However, mid game, the cleaner assassin critically injures Karlenko. As English and Tucker fly by helicopter, the assassin shoots out the navigation system with a [[Gatling gun]] disguised as a golf bag. When asked by authorities about their location and altitude, they simply spot a street sign saying Runstock and say just that. They lower the chopper to less than a metre to easily identify altitude.   They simply follow a road at low altitude to the town of Dingham, where there is supposed to be a hospital. When Karlenko almost passes out, English and Tucker keep him awake with an awkward rendition of [[Don't Give Up on Us (song)|''Don't Give Up on Us'']]. After landing on a moving ambulance, the three finally reach Dingham Hospital. Atop the ambulance, Karlenko reveals that the Vortex third key holder is a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] inside MI7, and then dies.  At MI7, English learns that talks between Britain and China will be conducted at a heavily guarded fortress called Le Bastion in the [[Swiss Alps]], in order to gain assistance against the development of nuclear weapons in Southeast Asia. Over dinner, English confides with Ambrose about the mole, not knowing that Ambrose is the actual mole.  Ambrose tricks English into thinking Quartermain is the traitor, and despite Tucker confronting Ambrose in the bathroom, English dismisses Tucker and lets Ambrose go free, giving him Karlenko's key. At a church, English confronts Quartermain, but realises he has been framed as the traitor.  He escapes the MI7 operatives using Quartermain's enhanced wheelchair, and hides at Sumner's flat. After reviewing the footage of the Mozambique mission, Sumner realises the assassin behaved abnormally, and that Vortex has a drug called ''[[C11H18N2O3|timoxeline barbebutenol]]'' that makes the person suggestible to [[mind control]] before killing them. Ambrose picks up Sumner to go to the fortress event, knowing that English had been hiding in the flat.   When English realizes Ambrose's treachery is actually very real, he spots the cleaner vacuuming Sumner's flat. When he hides behind a door, a chainsaw attached to the vacuum cleaner saws straight through the door. Luckily, English escapes the assassin via a garbage chute and makes for Tucker's apartment. Not much later, Ambrose, accompanied with the other leader of Vortex, meets with Vortex's current client and agrees for 500 million USD to be transferred to Ambrose's bank account.  In Tucker's flat, English persuades him to rejoin him to infiltrate Le Bastion. After getting in the gates, English accidentally activates a distress beacon that alerts the guards of the fortress to their presence. On English's command, Tucker punches his superior several times and deliberately misses English with a gun, saying to the Swiss guards that he killed English. Having been taken to Le Bastion, English manages to get out of the bag that holds him. English warns Pegasus of the threat, but unknowingly imbibes the drink containing the drug. Ambrose tells English to subdue Pegasus, which he does with a punch to the face.   Assigning English to be the Prime Minister's bodyguard inside the safe room, he orders him to kill the Chinese Premier using a pistol disguised as lipstick, which was hastily used despite it being intended for Thornton. However, English attempts to resist the drug. Tucker arrives and interrupts Ambrose's communication feed with a radio channel playing the song ‘Word Up’, but Ambrose resets the communication, exposing himself to the Chinese Premier in the process. English resists again and shoots Ambrose, who dodges and escapes, but the chemical enters its lethal stage, and English falls to the floor. Sumner arrives and is able to revive English with a passionate kiss.  With Ambrose heading down the mountain, English pursues him by parachuting and then snowmobilling down a mountainside.

Upon opening it, he realizes the umbrella is not resisting the bullets, and, while trying to close it, accidentally triggers the umbrella, which is really the T2 rocket launcher, and destroys the lift, killing Ambrose. Later on, Vortex is shut down and English is to have his knighthood reinstated by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]].

The Journals of Musan
 The film's protagonist is a North Korean refugee named Seung-chul struggling to adjust to life in Seoul. He is sharing a small apartment with a fellow defector named Kyung-chul, a "broker" who helps refugees send remittances to their families in North Korea (later in the film he angers several of his friends by allegedly cheating them and stealing their money). While both face difficult circumstances in recovering from trauma and adjusting to a new life, Seong-chul and Kyung-chol react to their situations quite differently. Seong-chul is extremely shy and submissive to authority. Throughout the film he's portrayed as a diligent worker, doing thankless tasks and accepting criticism stoically. Kyung-chul, by contest, has few moral scruples, attempting to steal a pair of pants and taunting Seong-chul.  At the start of the film Seung-chul has a job pasting advertisements for sex shops throughout his neighborhood; he is repeatedly beaten up by thugs. Seeking more stable employment he applies for other jobs but is rejected when employers see his citizen registration number, which marks him as a North Korean defector. Finally he gets a night job at a karaoke bar; the bar owner's daughter, it turns out, is a woman named Young-sook who he recognizes from church. However, she asks him to pretend not to know her at church, because she's ashamed of working at a karaoke bar and doesn't want members of her congregation to look down on her; Seung-chul agrees not to say anything. Later in the film, when there are no customers at the bar, some of the female employees hear him singing church hymns as he works; after laughing at him for being out of tune, they offer to teach him to sing. However, when Young-sook walks in, she is angry and demands an explanation, asking why he would sing church hymns with karaoke girls. He tells her he doesn't know any songs other than hymns- the implication is that he doesn't know South Korean pop songs and it would be frowned upon to sing North Korean songs. Not realizing he's a defector, she assumes he is lying, and fires him.  The climax occurs at a prayer meeting which Seung-chul attends with Detective Park, the police officer assigned to help him adjust to life in South Korea. Up till now, viewers have known he is a defector only due to the numbers on his ID card; now they learn the details of his story. Born in Musan, in impoverished North Hamgyong province- he became severely malnourished and got in a fight with a friend over food. The next day he saw his friend lying on the ground, exactly where they had been fighting the day before; Seung-chul realized he was dead, and assumed the fight had killed him.  He became wracked with guilt; the pastor assures him that God will forgive him.  After the prayer meeting, however, Detective Park berates Seung-chul, asking why he told his story and saying "Who would want to be friends with a killer?" Seung-chul tells him he doesn't have any friends, and walks out of the church; as he's leaving, Young-sook, who was at the prayer meeting and heard his story, comes up to him and apologizes, explaining she "had no idea" he was a defector. She also offers him his job back at the karaoke bar and says she wants to be his friend; he walks away without answering.  Returning to his apartment, he finds his dog, Baek-gu, missing; while he was gone, Kyung-chul had attempted to sell it, but was told no one would buy it because it was a half-breed; he then abandoned it in the middle of a busy street. Seung-chul goes to look for the dog and finds it eating out of a garbage bag.  The next night, Kyung-chul apologizes- and asks Seong-chul to retrieve the money he's hidden in Baek-gu's doghouse, reassuring him that its "honest money"; he then reveals his plan to go to America. Seung-chul agrees to help him, but says their friendship is over and "this will be my last favor." Entering his apartment that night, Seung-chul is assaulted and beaten by Kyung-chul's clients, who demand to know where he is so they can force him to pay them back. Seung-chul refuses to tell them. The next morning, he goes to church, where Young-sook invites him to join her in the choir; he agrees. That night, while working at the karaoke bar, he leaves his dog Baeuk-gu outside to wait, because his apartment is no longer safe; somehow Baek-gu gets off his leash, and during a break, Seong-chul finds his body in the street, run over by a car.<ref></ref>  
Josef (film)
 In 1915, during [[World War I]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], [[Croats|Croatian]] soldiers serving in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] were sent on [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] to fight against [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]] and [[Circassians|Circassian]] bandits. An Austrian-Hungarian soldier who has survived the battle, a Croat, takes uniform and identification tag from a dead [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]].<ref name=Polimac/> Later, the Croat and a group of [[Royal Croatian Home Guard|Croatian]] and [[Royal Hungarian Honvéd|Hungarian]] deserters are captured by the [[Imperial-Royal Landwehr|Austrians]] led by Lieutenant Ali Tiffenbach. Before the Croat could be [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] with the rest of the deserters, he is mistaken for [[Zugsführer]] [[Josip Broz Tito|Josef]], the dead NCO whose identification tag he's carrying. The Austrian Colonel decides to spare the Croat because Josef is well known as a regimental [[fencing]] champion, much to the disappointment of Lieutenant Tiffenbach, who suspects that the Croat is an [[impostor]]. Tiffenbach later confirms his suspicions when he easily defeats "Josef" in a sword duel.  Later, Tiffenbach's unit is attacked and obliterated by a group of [[Circassians|Circassian]] bandits led by a Russian officer, Captain Seryoza. The Croat hides the severely wounded Tiffenbach in a shack and switches their uniforms, believing the bandits would spare him if he is dressed like an officer. However, the bandits kill the Croat the moment they see him. Tiffenbach, now wearing Josef's uniform and identification tag, is later found by a woman named Pelagija, who takes him to her cabin in the woods. Pelagija tends to Tiffebach's wounds for a few days but later betrays him to the Circassians in exchange for a horse.  Over the next few days, Tiffenbach and two other captured soldiers are physically tortured and forced to do heavy work in the Circassian camp. The Circassians join the regular Russian Army and Tiffenbach is thrown in a prison where he is left to starve. Soon the Austrian Army begins a great offensive, defeating the Russians and capturing their positions. Before the end of the battle, Captain Seryoza finds Tiffenbach and switches their uniforms, joining the Austrians. After the battle, the Austrians execute their prisoners, including Tiffenbach who is only half-conscious and unable to identify himself. Seryoza joins the Austrians as they return to their camp and takes a look at Josef's tag to see the name [[Josip Broz Tito|Josip Broz]], implying that he would one day become [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], the President of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

Joint Body
 While doing time in prison for a violent offense, Nick Burke ([[Mark Pellegrino]]) is visited by his wife who informs him that after waiting for seven years, she is divorcing him and has taken out a restraining order against him to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Sometime later, after accepting the parole board's condition that he relinquish all custodial rights of his daughter, he is given his freedom. Now in his mid-forties and determined to start a new life, Nick tries to find his way back into society and move beyond his violent criminal past. He meets with his parole officer, finds a small motel room, and attends an [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meeting.  Nick's younger brother Dean (Ryan O'Nan) visits him at the motel and describes his life as a newlywed and police officer, having just graduated from the police academy. Although their relationship seems strained, Nick still looks to connect with his brother, even though he never visited him in prison. Before leaving, Dean gives his older brother a gun for protection. Nick soon finds work at a manufacturing plant.  At the motel, Nick meets a lonely and troubled [[stripper]] named Michelle Page ([[Alicia Witt]]), whose isolated life is interrupted by the deaths of her elderly neighbors. Nick asks his attractive neighbor out for coffee, and the two begin to share their stories with each other.  One morning, Michelle's former acquaintance Danny Wilson ([[Tom Guiry]]), whom she hasn't seen in three years, shows up after his three-year tour of duty in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], expecting to rekindle their relationship. Michelle hardly knows this man who has developed an obsession over her. When Michelle rejects his advances and his demands for a personal reward for his service to his country, he sticks a gun in her face and brutally rapes her in her room. Hearing the commotion, Nick runs to her room with his brother's gun in hand. In the confrontation, both men are shot — Danny is mortally wounded.  In the coming days, Michelle visits Nick in the hospital as he recovers from his gunshot wound to the stomach. When he learns that Danny died from his wounds, and knowing that he violated his parole and would be sent back to prison—no matter how good his intentions in stopping the attack, Nick leaves the hospital with Michelle's help, and the two drive to the home of Nick's brother Dean and his pregnant wife. There they get a glimpse of a domestic life they have never known. The relationship between the two brothers remains strained, yet Nick reaches out to make some familial connection with Dean, whose only advice is to "disappear".  The next morning, Nick and Michelle leave in Nick's old truck, knowing they have become outlaws on the run. They find solace in each other's arms that night in a motel. Soon after, police detectives arrive at Dean's house with the gun he gave his brother. Convinced that Michelle gave the gun to police, when Nick calls, Dean tells him that she betrayed him. Later, Nick confronts Michelle about the gun, and she swears she did not give it to the police — that they must have discovered where she had hidden the weapon. That night they have sex.  In the morning, Michelle discovers that Nick has abandoned her, perhaps for her own protection. Later, back at her motel, Michelle is arrested by the police and she is taken to jail. Meanwhile, Nick drives to his daughter's school and meets one of her teachers, who tells him she is doing fine. After school, he observes his daughter leaving with her friends, but he does not approach her. Sometime later, on a quiet deserted lake, Nick floats across the water in his old boat.  
Journey to Jamaa
 After their HIV positive mother's death, Derick and Margaret collect wood and construct a human-length box with wheels. Then, they journey with it from Kampala to Kasangombe in a heartbreaking bid to overcome poverty and experience hope. The journey throws them dangerous experiences on unpredictable Ugandan roads. Their mother's dying wish had set them off on a seemingly impossible journey to find a relative they do not even know.  Before her death, she leaves them an envelope addressed to her sister (their auntie) who is married to a hard-working man living in a distant village called Kasangombe with their kids. Ingeniously, Derick creates a coffin using wood he collected from a rubbish dump and adds luggage bag rollers brought by Margaret. On their journey from Kampala City to their aunt’s place, they are offered a lift by a seemingly kind man (played by [[Joel Okuyo Atiku]]) in a truck who is amazed by their "box". He introduces them to a kid he had taken under his wings relaxing at the back and shows them a photo of a house they can possess if they work for him. At night though, Margaret sees a scary dream where their helper is not exactly as kind as he seemed so she runs out of the truck. Derick follows and the boy throws out their coffin before waving. They walk the rest of the distance.  Initially, their uncle (played by Isaac Muwawu) did not want them in his house because he thought they were HIV-infected. Derick overheard him quarrel with his aunt at night and shook Margaret in the morning from another dream (this time beautiful, where both siblings were smiling and enjoying a picnic in a glorious garden with their aunt, uncle, cousins, dead parents and some whites). Derick convinced her to walk away from the home with him but without a reason.   On the way, Margaret stops and taunts her brother to reveal why they were leaving or else she wouldn’t continue. When he said that he was going to the man who had given them a lift in his truck and work to get a big house like the one in the photo that flew out when they ran, Margaret revealed to him that she had seen a dream the previous night. Derick replied bluntly that her dreams never come true. So when she U-turned in defiance and saw her gleeful aunt coming, she happily ran towards her oblivious of the fact that there was danger lurking. At the T-junction near a bridge, a white Nissan Datsun pick up sped without warning and knocked her into a river, fulfilling the nightmare she had seen a couple of times from the start of the movie.  Her uncle helped to pull her out.  
Judas Kiss (2011 film)
 Failed filmmaker Zach Wells is asked by his friend and hotshot director, Topher Shadoe, to take his place as judge in the annual Keystone Film Festival, held in Zach's alma mater, Keystone Summit University. Zach is initially reluctant, as it brings memories of the festival defining his life for the worse: he won the festival 15 years ago, which convinced him to drop out of college and move to Hollywood, where his career struggled. The night before the judging, Zach goes to a gay bar where he has sex with a younger patron.  To his shock, Zach finds out that the patron is a participant in the festival. Even more puzzling, he is named Danny Reyes, Zach's birth name, and submits ''Judas Kiss'', the same film Zach submitted years ago. Zach suspects it as Topher's elaborate joke, but it becomes more and more real as the headmistress, Mrs. Blossom, dismisses his misgivings about Danny's identity. Zach is approached by Welds, the school's elderly security guard. Welds seems to understand the situation and tips him that Danny, with the help of his friend Abbey Park, cheats in order to increase his chance of winning the competition. He tells Zach that the latter's future depends on whether Danny wins or not.  Danny strikes a relationship with Chris Wachowsky, the winner of the previous year's festival. As he is preparing for the big day, he is approached by Shane Lyons, the son of famous Hollywood producers and self-proclaimed "emperor" of the college. Shane takes an interest in Danny and has sex with him, asking him to move to his residence regardless if he wins the festival or not. Chris warns Danny that Shane is only interested in him because he is a potential winner and will dump him – just as he did to Chris a year ago – if his parents disapprove his film. However, Danny is insistent about Shane's involvement as his abusive father, Daniel Sr., threatened to cut him off if he shows the film, straining his relationship with Chris and Abbey.  On the day of the awards ceremony, Zach presents evidence of Danny's deception to Daniel Sr., who in turn gives it to Mrs. Blossom. He tries to convince Danny to quit the festival, but the latter brushes him off. Welds appears one last time to Zach and reveals that he is actually Danny - and by extension Zach - as an old man. Danny's fraud costs him the award, but the other judges' assertions win him chance to play ''Judas Kiss'', an autobiography of Danny's abusive life after his mother died. He is given special recognition, but this ends his friendship with Chris and Abbey for good. Danny visits Zach in his compartments and shares his fears. Zach tells him that what already happened cannot change, encouraging him to craft a better life.  After the festival, Zach is working on his project while sitting on a roof, like he did in the beginning. Topher returns from his business and joins him. It is revealed that Topher is really Chris, having reconciled with Zach after the latter failed to break into Hollywood.

Pam becomes annoyed by Sabrina's acts of kindness and counts three strikes already against her. Sabrina talks to her friends during the cocktail party, one of them being her maid of honor Blythe ([[Meagan Good]]). While Blythe goes to get more wine, she meets Chef McKenna ([[Gary Dourdan]]), and both instantly feel a connection. Shonda also meets Sabrina's cousin, Sebastian ([[Romeo Miller]]), who is instantly drawn to her.

During the dinner at night, Pam gives a rude blessing and has a fight with Claudine but this is stopped by Greg. Claudine also says in [[French language|French]] that she thinks Greg is having an affair with his associate Amanda. While outside, Pam listens in on Geneva and Claudine fighting and finds out that Geneva is actually Sabrina's mother and gave Sabrina to Claudine and Greg after she was born.  During the bachelor party, Sabrina and Jason have a fight about his mother wanting them to be [[jumping the broom]]. Malcolm talks to Jason and complains and asks why he isn't the best man. Jason tells him that they haven't been best friends in years and Malcolm has only been there to ask for money. When Jason leaves and tries to apologize to Sabrina, Chef McKenna is busy kissing Blythe and not noticing the food which begins to burn which sets off the alarm. Sabrina closes the door on him but they make up through text; however, they have doubts about their wedding.  In the morning, everything begins normally. The boys have a friendly game of football, though Pam tries to tell Jason about Claudine and Geneva's secret. Blythe also talks to McKenna about the relationship. McKenna tells her that he thinks she is beautiful and a relationship is still an option. Greg reveals to Claudine that he is not having an affair, but has made some bad investments and lost most of his money. While Pam is getting fitted in her dress, she tries to confront Sabrina about the secret but is interrupted when Jason gets hurt when pushed by Malcolm. Pam tells Sabrina to ask her parents who are her real parents. Claudine and Geneva tell the truth which hurts Sabrina and causes her to drive off and cancel the wedding. Jason confronts his mother and tells her he is a grown man and to stop treating him like a little boy. Jason tells everyone to look for Sabrina and also punches Malcolm. Jason prays to God to help him.  Geneva is called by Sabrina who is at the docks in a boat. Geneva gives the story of Sabrina's father. He was a man in Paris whom she loved and planned to travel the world with but she soon found out he had a wife and child and she returned home alone and pregnant. Jason meets back with Sabrina and the two reconcile. Sabrina goes back home to dress. She gets a broom and a note from Pam saying she is returning home and is sorry. She chases down Pam and asks her to stay. They forgive each other and Pam agrees to stay. Jason and Sabrina have the wedding and also jump the broom. After the wedding, Sebastian kisses Shonda, finally winning her affections, and presumably begins a relationship. Greg and Claudine reconcile and she reveals she has secret funds, and that they are still wealthy.

At the end, the whole family happily does the [[Cupid Shuffle]].

But Frank was ruining all her plans because he knocked Judy off a tight rope, puked all over her on a roller coaster, and left the theater in the middle of a scary movie. All of her ideas go wrong, so she decides to stay in her room for the rest of the summer, until she hears the newscast in front of her house. She looks out of the window and discovers that Stink is going to be on the news, because of his search for [[Bigfoot]].

Juan of the Dead
  Juan ([[Alexis Díaz de Villegas]]) is forty years old and has devoted the majority of his life to living in Cuba doing absolutely nothing. He is accompanied by his bumbling sidekick, Lazaro ([[Jorge Molina Enríquez|Jorge Molina]]), who is just as lazy but the bigger fool (and accident-prone), on a makeshift fishing raft. Their line snags what they think is a corpse but it suddenly awakens and attacks them, ending with Lazaro shooting it in the head with his spear gun. They think nothing of it at first and go about their business as usual, which involves thuggish activity and associating with their less than reputable friends: Lazaro's vain, Americanized pretty-boy son Vladi California; drag queen La China, who is also an expert slingshot marksman; and China's hulk-like lover Primo (who faints at the sight of blood and has to wear a blindfold when fighting).  The only emotional bond Juan has is with his daughter Camila ([[Andrea Duro]]), a young and beautiful girl who wants nothing to do with her father because the only thing he does is get in trouble. Suddenly a strange series of events begin to occur: people everywhere suddenly become violent and attack each other at random. After an encounter with an elderly neighbor's reanimated body, Juan comes to the conclusion that it is not vampires nor possession by demons, but capitalist dissidents. Lazaro attempts to flee with a woman he and the others have rescued, but Juan follows him to the raft they are trying to escape on. The woman falls into the water and is lost to them, leaving Lazaro with little reason to refuse Juan's plea for him to stay, and that Juan needs his sidekick.  To Camila's dismay, Juan's idea to take advantage of the situation is revealed: He starts a business, which he rationalizes will also be a great help for other survivors, with the slogan: "Juan of the Dead: we kill your beloved ones. How can we help you?" For a price, the five men in the group enter homes and slay the zombified residents. Although extremely proficient in dispatching their quarry in open streets, they suffer from bad luck and high civilian and resident casualties on indoor missions. That, coupled with allowing their corruption to come out (by looting and even attacking humans that Lazaro claims owe him money) puts strain both on his relationship with his daughter, and the success of their business.  The group is later rounded up by a shady military group, forcing them to strip naked and get into a truck. It seems they are recruiting able-bodied males to fight the zombie threat but some of the others who were rounded up before were infected, and they reanimate, causing a riot in the back of the truck and flipping it over, enabling Juan's group to flee, and further blunders on the military's part remove any hope they have of any kind of rescue or victory over the undead. China, who was bitten during the truck incident, dies and reanimates while handcuffed to Juan, and Vladi and Camila struggle to figure out a way to extricate Juan from his predicament. Juan finally throws China off the roof of their safe haven and Camila throws him some oil to lubricate zombie China's hand, letting him slip out of the cuffs and fall.  The zombies have become too numerous to continue the group's business operations, forcing them to stay on rooftops for safety, sending Vladi out on one-man food retrieval missions which endears him to Camila. At this point the group is whittled down to Juan, Lazaro, Primo, Vladi, and Camila, the latter two having become romantically involved despite Juan's disapproval. Losing hope, they decide to try heading for the mountains which may be unpopulated and safer. An escape attempt via motor vehicle is thwarted by mechanical failure (and the fact that none of them knows how to drive), forcing them to flee on foot while pursued by hundreds of undead. Attempting to seek shelter in a bunker, yet another of Juan's ideas proves disastrous, as Primo, while prying open the door, reveals it is overrun and he is pulled in.  The remaining group makes their way to a basketball court where a miraculous feat of vehicular zombie-slaying by a middle-aged white man with a harpoon gun mounted on his truck saves them after they become surrounded. He tries to tell the group what he knows about the situation in English, but the language barrier between them prevents him from divulging his plan to end the disaster, which he believes has religious implications. He is then accidentally killed by another of Lazaro's spear gun incidents, forcing the desperate group to come up with yet another plan for escape, and berating Lazaro for his continual screw-ups.  Sheltering in a deserted parking garage the man had led them to, Lazaro amazingly comes up with a plan to make up for his repeated failures. According to his idea, they construct a flotation mechanism out of empty oil drums and attach them to a convertible, with the intention of attempting to drive through a group of zombies on the street and out onto the beach, where they can reach the water. They plan to float to Florida (where Camila's mother is known to be staying), hoping America might be safer. Lazaro confides to Juan that he had been bitten during their earlier escape, and they share an emotional goodbye while they wait for him to change, until it's revealed it was only a harmless scratch.  Juan and Lazaro fight the zombies standing in their way to clear a path to the water for the car to drive over. Juan hears a child's crying and goes to investigate. He rescues a little boy from his zombified father and brings him to the car. Lazaro and Juan create a ramp of bodies for the car to jump over the wall separating the street from the sand, and the car makes it into the water. Preparing to float to freedom, the group is shocked when Juan gets out of the floating car and heads back to shore, explaining to his comrades that he belongs in his homeland and convincing them that he's going to do what he's always done best: Survive.  The end credits are an animated cartoon showing Juan going through the horde of zombies. It is later shown that Camila, Lazaro and Vladi came back to join Juan in fighting the dead.

Just Go with It
 In 1988, Daniel "Danny" Maccabee ([[Adam Sandler]]), a 22-year old man, leaves his wedding right before the ceremony is about to begin after learning that his fiancee is cheating on him, and was only marrying him because he was going to be a doctor. He goes to drink alone at a bar, where a young, beautiful woman walks in. She sees that Danny has a wedding ring on his hand, and asks him about his wife, to which he explains how she recently left him for someone else, and the woman from the bar ends up sleeping with him.  Twenty-three years later, Danny (now 45-years old) is now a successful [[plastic surgeon]] in [[Los Angeles]] who feigns unhappy marriages to get women, and to avoid romantic commitment that may lead to heartbreak. The only woman aware of his schemes is his office manager and best friend Katherine Murphy ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), a divorced mother of two. At a party, Danny meets Palmer ([[Brooklyn Decker]]), a sixth grade math teacher, without his wedding ring on, and they have a connection together. The next morning, she finds the ring and assumes he is married. She refuses to date him because her parents divorced due to [[adultery]].  Instead of telling her the truth, Danny tells her that he is getting divorced from a woman named Devlin. Danny tells Palmer that they are getting divorced because she cheated on him with a man named "Dolph Lundgren" (not [[Dolph Lundgren|the actor]]). Palmer then insists on meeting Devlin. Danny asks Katherine to pose as "Devlin" and they go shopping for new clothes to dress like a [[trophy wife]].  A made-over Katherine/"Devlin" then meets with Danny and Palmer and gives them her blessing. However, after hearing Katherine talking on the phone with her kids, Palmer assumes that her kids are Danny's as well. Danny then privately meets with Katherine's kids, Maggie ([[Bailee Madison]]) and Michael ([[Griffin Gluck]]), to get them to play along and gives them the aliases of "Kiki Dee" and "Bart" respectively. Danny accepts their demands for being his fake children.  Palmer meets the kids at a play center where Maggie has adopted a fake british accent, and Michael acts very morose. They [[blackmail]] Danny in front of Palmer to take them all to [[Hawaii]]. At the airport, they are all surprised by Danny's goofball cousin Eddie ([[Nick Swardson]]), who has adopted an Austrian disguise as the "Dolph Lundgren" that Danny had made up earlier. To maintain the lies, Danny and Katherine are forced to bring him along.  At the resort in Hawaii, Danny tells Eddie that he is considering asking Palmer to marry him. Katherine and Danny also run into the real-life Devlin Adams ([[Nicole Kidman]]) and her husband Ian Maxtone-Jones ([[Dave Matthews]]). Because of Katherine and Devlin's long-time rivalry, Katherine introduces Danny as her husband rather than admit she is a [[single mother]]. Over time, Katherine is impressed by Danny and his way of fun with her kids.  Katherine again runs into Devlin, who invites her and Danny out to dinner. Eddie agrees to take Palmer out to dinner so that Danny can go with Katherine. Since he is supposed to be a sheep salesman, Eddie's cover is nearly blown when he is forced to save the life of an actual sheep who choked on a toy whistle. At dinner, Devlin asks Danny and Katherine to tell each other what they admire most about each other, and, as Danny and Katherine talk, they start to feel a connection. Later, when Palmer and Eddie return from their dinner date, Palmer suggests that she and Danny get married now, since a drunken Eddie told her about Danny's plans of engagement. Danny and Katherine are both surprised by her proposition, but Danny ultimately agrees. Danny later calls Katherine regarding his confusion, but Katherine says that she will be taking a job in [[New York City]] to get a fresh start to her life.  The next day, Palmer confronts Katherine about Danny's feelings for her, which Katherine dismisses. Katherine then runs into Devlin at a bar and admits that she pretended to be married to Danny to avoid embarrassment. Devlin confesses that she is divorcing Ian because he is [[gay]] and also that he did not invent the iPod, but made his money by suing the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] after getting hit by a foul ball. Katherine confides in Devlin about being in love with Danny, but then Danny shows up behind her, saying that he is not marrying Palmer and that he is in love with Katherine. Meanwhile, on the plane ride back to the mainland, Palmer meets a professional tennis player ([[Andy Roddick]]) who shares her interests. Sometime later, Danny and Katherine get married.

His co-worker, Sub-Inspector Bose (Prashanth), hates Armugam for his crimes but is unable to take any action because of Armugam's political powers. The assistant commissioner (Jai Jagadish), Kempegowda's senior, is on Armugam's payroll and takes care in concealing and eliminating the evidence of Armugam's crimes from the eyes of the law. The police commissioner also does not help Kempegowda as there is no evidence against Armugam and the assistant commissioner and in turn, warns him to stay away from Armugam's case.

Keyhole (film)
  The gang of Ulysses Pick ([[Jason Patric]]) shoots its way into his former home, which the police have surrounded, with a hostage and a stuffed wolverine (named "Crispy") in tow. Big Ed, the gang's second-in-command, then evicts the dead gangsters (who seem otherwise alive), after asking them to identify themselves: "Those of you who have been killed, stand facing the wall." They leave reluctantly, and the gang waits for Ulysses. The film's narrator, the ghost of Ulysses's father-in-law Calypso/Camille ([[Louis Negin]]), reveals that the house is haunted (and not only by him) because although a house's happiness is able to vacate the premises after its inhabitants have left, its sorrow is doomed to remain inside forever. This house had once belonged to Ulysses and his four children with his wife Hyacinth ([[Isabella Rossellini]]).  Ulysses himself arrives, carrying a drowned young woman named Denny. After entering the house, Denny is able to stand under her own strength, and seems alive although injured and blind. She reveals that she can hear the thoughts of Ulysses as he wanders through the house, examining the objects that he had previously left behind. Calypso reveals that Hyacinth remains in Ulysses's former bedroom at the top of the house, where she has chained him (her father's ghost). Ulysses and Denny join the gang, who are confused about their plan (and don't understand why the police haven't shot their way into the house). Ulysses deflects questions about the plan and claims that the police won't enter the house while the storm is still in force. Big Ed, annoyed at being kept in the dark, criticizes Ulysses for adopting Heatly after he killed one of Ulysses's sons, and is thrashed.  Calypso reveals that although he is chained to Hyacinth's bed, his chains stretch to unknown lengths, and torments Ed further through supernatural flogging. Ulysses collects the gang's guns and throws them into the ducts to be destroyed in the house's furnace. The gangster Ogilbe ([[Kevin McDonald]]) thinks he hears a noise and goes to investigate, exiting with a ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]''-esque "I'll be right back." He is immediately killed when he tries to have sex with one of the ghosts even though Ulysses just warned him not to bother the ghosts (upon contact with a washerwoman ghost, he's electrocuted—his ghost shortly completes the sex act). The bullets from the guns that had been thrown into the furnace begin to fire throughout the house (the laughing face of Calypso suggests that this is somehow the ghost's doing) and a stray bullet kills Heatly. As he dies, Ulysses reveals that he had at first adopted Heatly to torture him and himself as revenge for the death of his son but grew to love Heatly more than any of his sons. (Ulysses is unaware, as he says this, that the hostage who watches/hears is his only living son, Manners, having forgotten and failed to recognize him.)  Ulysses disposes of the corpses of Heatly and Ogilbe in the bog located in the house's centre (Hyacinth's secluded outdoor garden located in a quadrangle within the labyrinthine house). Ulysses gathers his scout knife, the stuffed wolverine Crispy, Denny and his hostage son and sets forth into the house to find Hyacinth, ordering his gang to stay put but leaving the untrustworthy Big Ed in charge. Ulysses orders Denny to stay focused on reading his memories and forget about drowning, since he has forgotten too much to find Hyacinth without her help. She recounts his memory of coming home early to find Hyacinth at home alone, running naked with the family's dogs. Ulysses remembers being distressed at how the episode revealed the extent to which Hyacinth was a stranger to him, even though at the same time this moment was when he loved her the most. Ulysses contemplates the first of the house's many locked doors (which "all have to be opened").  In her bedroom at the top of the house, Hyacinth is startled by Calypso screaming awake from a nightmare of a young girl drowning. Calypso begs Hyacinth for release from his chains, revealing that Hyacinth is now sleeping with Chang, and Hyacinth fondly remembers her son Manners. Calypso tells Hyacinth that Ulysses is in the house coming to either save or kill Hyacinth (or both). Ulysses himself then speaks to Hyacinth through the keyhole of the first locked door, offering her his scout knife and convincing her to pretend he isn't there, allowing him to open the door. Ulysses investigates the room (the blind, drowned Denny helps him "see" the room as it once was) and begins remembering past events. He discovers the ghost of his son Brucie masturbating/playing Yahtzee in a cubbyhole (but doesn't recognize him or his milk-drinking ghost son Ned). Calypso's narration reveals that the hostage is Ulysses's only surviving son, Manners (also unrecognized). Meanwhile, the gangsters have begun to construct an electric chair. Ulysses makes another offering to Hyacinth (of Ned's bowl) to have her allow him through a second locked door.  A doctor ([[Udo Kier]]) has been summoned to examine Denny. The doctor relates the tragic story of his only son's death, which occurred earlier that day from a fall that broke his neck and was followed by a wasp attack. In the next room (a bathroom), Denny bathes Manners while Ulysses remembers trying to console Hyacinth in her grief. The girl climbs into the bath with Manners, and Ulysses remembers accidentally breaking Ned's bowl after his death, upsetting Hyacinth. Denny discovers a secret passage that passes the "cyclops" (a penis sticking out the wall: "That penis is getting dusty," remarks Ulysses). Calypso begs Hyacinth to release him so that he can stop Ulysses, who he has discovered is "bent on forgiveness," a much worse scenario than the revenge he had feared.  As ghosts and gangsters mill about, attempting to restore the house to its former glory, the doctor examines Denny and declares the drowned young woman to be drowned, and therefore dead. Manners frees himself from his gag and reveals his identity to his father, and that he was in love with Denny but she broke up with him and then drowned afterward. Manners tries to revive Denny but fails, and Ulysses leaves the doomed lovers to return to his gang, who strap him into the homemade electric chair (which is powered by pedalling). However, electrocuting Ulysses fails since he is revealed to be already dead (having been, ironically, executed in an electric chair).  Having now fully recovered his memory, Ulysses has Big Ed electrocuted for insubordination and thrown with the chair into the bog. Ulysses takes Manners and the somewhat recovered Denny into the house's next room, where Manners relives a fond memory of Hyacinth. Calypso begs for release from Hyacinth before Chang returns, and she begins to file through his chains, while Manners leads Denny away to show her the desktop family organizer he invented to send messages between family members via pneumatic tubes. Ulysses interrupts Heatly about to have sex with his daughter Lota (a memory, he soon realizes). Lota, dying of cancer, throws herself into the bog to be reunited with Heatly in death. Ulysses tries to bond with Manners by playing catch with him, but Manners ignores his father. Calypso has been freed by Hyacinth, and Manners answers a ringing phone as Ulysses enters the master bedroom to find Hyacinth.  Ulysses kills Chang and Manners hangs up the phone to remember Denny heading out for a midnight swim. Manners heads upstairs to his bedroom (which the gangsters have restored) and remembers Ulysses praising one of his inventions while Hyacinth notes that she has rearranged the house while Ulysses was away. As Hyacinth smiles and looks on, Manners and Ulysses restore the room to the way it used to be. The gangsters and the rest of the ghosts fade away (even the bullet holes fade) and Manners is left alone with his memories, holding a gun, in the empty house, hand turning a doorknob but not fully, unable or unwilling to leave.

Kiba Gaiden
 Set around the final chapters of the "Black Fang" arc of ''Garo'', the 23rd episode in the first series, the movie is divided into three acts: Memory, Knight, and Makai.  Awakening after being kidnapped from Saezima Manor, Kaoru finds herself in a room with Barago and a Makai Guide, Elda, as she learns her part in the former's plan to summon the Horrors' source, Messiah. Demanding how Barago could be a pawn of evil, he explained that he freely chose darkness to become stronger. To clarify all mysteries, he actually takes the time to tell her about his origins.  Barago was born from a Makai family, his mother was a Makai Priestess and his father was a Makai Knight. Their family was once a happy one until Barago's mother fell ill. Her frailty gave him the drive to become a stronger person, to protect her as he trained to become a Makai Knight. Unfortunately, things take a turn for the worse when his mother is possessed by a Horror and Barago is forced to watch his father kill her before his eyes.  His mother's death drives Barago to hate Horrors and also convinces him leave home to become a stronger warrior. His father later dies fighting Horrors, but he admits that he felt no sadness for his father's death. He ironically hates Makai Knights more than Horrors. However, for the sake of power, he eventually found apprenticeship under Taiga Saezima. Barago still desires greater power and Taiga saw him unfit to bear the title of Garo. To that end, Barago finds the ''Madou Book of the Dark Arts'' and forms a contract with Messiah to absorb her. Christened as "Kiba the Dark Knight", Barago eventually breaks the limits of his armor and proceeds to devour many Horrors to reach his quota of one thousand in preparation of absorbing Messiah.  Soon after the story ends, a shocked Kaoru learns from Barago that he has also devoured Makai Knights and has intentions to consume Kouga in front of her. Kaoru becomes hysterical and is knocked out by Elda. Barago begins to remember one Makai Knight from his past: Bado the Storm Knight. The two fought many battles before, but in one final confrontation where Kiba won, he was covered in energy and was unaware of the effects of Bado's last attack.  Awake, again, Kaoru learns from Elda's past. She once loved a Makai Knight named Shinji, but they were star-crossed lovers. The two were ordered to find the remains of a Horror named Gyanon. While on the journey, for unexplained reasons, the two were struck down in an act of treachery by two accompanying Makai Knights (for reasons never specified). As Elda lay dying, aware that Gyanon's corpse has been [[Garo: Makai Senki|mysteriously taken away]] by reading her tarot cards earlier, she witnesses Barago arriving for the missing Horror and killing the two Makai Knights instead. Soon after, she agrees to become his follower and is reborn with a Horror influence.  Afterwards, Elda is tempted to harm Kaoru, but Barago arrives to reveal that Messiah is to enter Kaoru's body. Astonished by the girl's lack of memory, Barago explains to Kaoru that in one of their past counselling sessions, Messiah briefly took possession of her body. It is in that time Messiah opened Barago's eyes that Bado left an energy of light within him. Sent into the deep recesses of his mind, Barago proceeds to destroy the trace of light that has assumed the form of the Garo the Golden Knight. Donning his armor, Barago battles and defeats Garo in armored combat. However, as the story ends, Messiah takes over Kaoru's body again and it is revealed that there is still a faint light within Barago: the love for his mother. Driven by his convictions for power, Barago manages to destroy the last shred of light within him (cutting down his beloved mother, his last light) and proceeds with his descent to the very depths of darkness.

Khalifah (film)
 Khalifah (Marsha Timothy), a young, physically attractive woman, is working at the salon run by her deceased mother's friend Rita ([[Jajang C. Noer]]). After her shift, she goes home by bus and passes a group of three teenaged boys who make catcalls. Upon arriving at home, she talks with her father, Bilal (Brohisman), her brother Faisal (Yoga Pratama) and her father's friend Riko about Riko's nephew, Rasyid (Indra Herlambang). Khalifah is asked to marry him, and is told that it is her decision; after she sees that her father is considering selling his wedding ring to pay the rent, she agrees.  Khalifah and Rasyid are married and move in together. The two have very different habits, with Rasyid strictly following Islamic doctrine and Khalifah living a more metropolitan lifestyle; their relationship is also stressed by Rasyid often leaving for weeks at a time for business. Eventually, Rasyid convinces Khalifah to wear a [[hijab|headscarf]]; after she begins wearing it, her friends and colleagues compliment her on the choice. Meanwhile, she meets a new neighbour, the tailor Yoga (Ben Joshua), and begins to feel attracted to him; she does not act on this attraction.  Khalifah soon learns that she is pregnant. Rasyid is also overjoyed at the news, giving Khalifah a special tonic to help her with the pregnancy. However, when Khalifah [[Miscarriage|miscarries]] during [[salat|prayer]] while Rasyid is abroad, she is devastated; when Rasyid learns of the miscarriage, he says that it is because she has sinned and tells her to wear the [[niqab]]. Although initially displeased, she agrees. The following day, Rasyid leaves on business for two months, and Khalifah engages Yoga to make her niqab.  However, her life outside the house changes rapidly, with passersby staring, pointing, or even accusing her of being a terrorist. Although she initially attempts to quit her job at the salon as she cannot work with the niqab on and cannot be seen by other men with it off, Rita chooses to make the salon exclusively for women on Fridays and Saturdays; this results in another niqab-wearing woman, Fatimah ([[Titi Sjuman]]), to come to the salon. Fatimah is able to answer Khalifah's questions on the garment and its social context.  Khalifah learns that she is pregnant again, and tells Rasyid when he returns. Although he is at first happy, he becomes increasingly withdrawn; he soon leaves again. Yoga leaves for Saudi Arabia to work as a tailor there. Not long afterwards, as Khalifah is preparing to go to work, she is stopped by a woman on the street who accuses her of being a terrorist; Khalifah is soon picked up and questioned by the police, only to be released when the chief indicates that Bilal, his former teacher, is her father.  As Khalifah is recovering at her family's home, she sees on television that a group of suspected terrorists were caught in a firefight with police, and a niqab-wearing gunman was killed. Immediately afterwards there is a knock at the door, with the police having come to ask Khalifah to identify Rasyid's body; in the morgue, she meets Rasyid's other wife and child, of whom she had no knowledge. Upon returning home, she removes everything that connected her to Rasyid, including the niqab.  Several months later, with her baby already born, Khalifah receives a package in the post from Yoga; inside, she sees that it is a new niqab. Trying it on in a mirror, she takes it off and says "I am Khalifah".  
Key (film)
 A total of nine candidates gather together in a closed room for what seems to be a special kind of a test. The invigilator (Jagapathi Babu) arrives, tells them that his company intends to select only one candidate from them based on their answer to his question. He also lays certain conditions to write the answer, which look quite simple from the outside; anyone failing to meet the conditions will be disqualified. He leaves the people locked in the room, along with a watchman, but leaves out one important thing – he never gives them any question – or so it seems. The nine candidates first have to find the right question in order to give the right answer. Together they team up to find the question, with their analysis and expertise in their subjects. But with the countdown glaring at them and with the conditions seeming too ridiculous, their true characters begin to come out and candidates start getting eliminated. Who wins, and how does the winner find the ‘question’ is the ‘key’ to this story.  
The Key Man
   
Kill the Irishman
 In 1960 [[Danny Greene]] and his childhood friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen at the [[Cleveland]] docks.The members are exploited by corrupt union boss Jerry Merke, and the leadership of the [[International Longshoremen's Association|ILA union]] urges Greene to run against him. Sneperger cannot pay a gambling debt to [[Cleveland crime family|Cleveland Mafia]] Capo [[John Nardi]]. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Greene supplies Nardi's crew with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands a cut of Greene's profits, and then sends an enforcer to kill him. Instead, Greene beats up the enforcer, then beats up Merke, throws the union leader out of his office, and is later elected union president. He improves the working conditions at the docks while continuing his dealings with Nardi.  Greene's corruption is exposed by ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''. Cleveland Police Detective Joe Manditski, who grew up with Greene in [[Collinwood]], arrests him. Bankrupt and facing prison, Greene [[plea bargain]]s to lesser charges in return for becoming an [[FBI]] informant and being banned for life from [[organized labor]]. Greene is released and moves his unhappy wife and daughters back to Collinwood. Nardi gets him work as an enforcer for Hungarian Jewish [[loan shark]] [[Alex Birns|Shondor Birns]], and later helps pitch a deal to Mafia Capo [[Jack Licavoli]]: Greene will force the city's garbage haulers to join the union Licavoli controls. Greene, McComber, Sneperger, and ex-Hells Angel Keith Ritson terrorize many into joining, but Greene's friend Mike Frato refuses. Licavoli orders Greene to kill Frato, but Greene balks because Frato has ten children. Nardi tells him privately that, "You wanted to play in the big leagues. Sometimes you have to do things you don't wanna do."  As Greene prepares to kill Frato with a car bomb, he learns from the FBI that Sneperger has returned to gambling, and has become an informant for Manditsky. That night Greene assigns Sneperger to set the bomb under Frato’s car and presses the detonator as he does it. An enraged Frato later shoots at Greene in a park. Greene returns fire, kills Frato, and is arrested for murder, but released after Frato's driver tells Manditski that Greene acted in self-defense. Having had enough, Greene's long suffering wife leaves him and takes the children.  Greene sees his elderly Irish neighbor, Grace O’Keefe, being evicted. He intervenes, pays her rent, and she gratefully gives him her father's gold [[Celtic cross]] to wear for protection. Greene begins to use his money and connections to help other Irish-Americans in need, and earns the nickname "The [[Robin Hood]] of Collinwood".  Greene wants to open his own restaurant, and asks Shondor Birns to help him. Birns arranges a $70,000 loan from the [[Gambino Crime Family|Gambinos]], but Birns' courier buys [[cocaine]] with the money and gets arrested. Birns and Greene argue over which of them should pay back the money; when Greene refuses to pay, Birns hires a hitman to kill him. Greene narrowly escapes, and later kills Birns with a car bomb.  After Mafia boss [[John T. Scalish]] dies, both Nardi and Licavoli are considered for succession. Licavoli is chosen due to his closer ties to the [[Five Families]] and decides to charge Greene 30% "street tax" for doing business in Cleveland. Greene refuses to pay, crudely mocks Licavoli's Italian heritage, and vows, "The Irishman's in business for himself now."  An outraged Licavoli has Greene's house blown up, but he survives. He then attempts to demote Nardi and take away his crew, only to have the latter join forces with Greene. Vowing to take over Cleveland together, Greene and Nardi start by organizing the murders of Licavoli’s associates, many of whom are blown up. Thirty-six car bombings occur during the summer of 1976, drawing national attention and humiliating Licavoli. After failing multiple times to kill Greene, Licavoli is forced to humbly ask [[Genovese Crime Family|Genovese]] boss [[Anthony Salerno]] to help him kill Nardi and Greene.  Having learned of this from the FBI, Greene claims that he wants to leave Cleveland and buy a ranch in Texas, but needs to raise $2 million. Wishing to size up their enemies, Greene and Nardi travel to New York and invite Salerno to invest in the ranch. After they leave, Salerno orders his associates to hire hitman [[Ray Ferritto]] to kill them both. Nardi is killed in a car explosion, McComber dies in a bombing at the Cleveland docks, and Ritson is shot near his house. Detective Manditski lets Greene know that a master killer is after him. He offers Greene protection, but is told, "My enemies will be taken care of."  During a dentist's appointment on October 6, 1977, Greene notices a car being parked next to his but makes nothing of it because the man who left the car was unknown to him. Returning to his car, Greene is stopped by a small group of young boys riding bikes. In a gesture of admiration to the spunkiest of them, he gives the boy a necklace with a meaningful history to him. He notices Ferritto driving by slowly, and accepts that he is about to die, Ferritto detonates a bomb on the car next to Greene's, killing Greene instantly.  
Killer Elite (film)
 In 1980, [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] Danny Bryce ([[Jason Statham]]), Hunter ([[Robert De Niro]]), Davies ([[Dominic Purcell]]), and Meier ([[Aden Young]]) are in [[Mexico]] to assassinate a man. Danny is shot when he becomes distracted after realizing he has killed the man in front of the target's young daughter. Affected by this, Danny retires and returns to his native [[Australia]].  The following year, Danny is summoned to [[Oman]] to meet The Agent ([[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]). He learns that Hunter failed a $6 million job. If Danny does not complete Hunter's mission, Hunter will be executed. Sheikh Amr, a deposed king of a small region of Oman, wants Danny to kill three former [[Special Air Service|SAS]] troopers—Steven Harris ([[Lachy Hulme]]), Steven Cregg ([[Grant Bowler]]), and Simon McCann (Daniel Roberts)—for killing his three eldest sons during the [[Dhofar Rebellion]]. Danny must videotape their confessions and make their deaths look like accidents, all before the terminally ill sheikh dies. This will allow the sheikh's fourth son, Bakhait ([[Firass Dirani]]), to regain control of his father's desert region. Davies and Meier agree to help Danny for a share of the money.  Danny and Meier sneak into Harris's house. After Harris confesses on videotape, they take him to the bathroom, intending to make it look like he slipped and hit his head. However, Harris's girlfriend knocks on the door. While Harris and Meier are distracted, Harris attempts to break free, causing Meier to kill him.  In England, Davies questions bar patrons about former SAS members. This is reported to the Feather Men, a [[secret society]] of former operatives protecting their own. Their head enforcer, Spike Logan ([[Clive Owen]]), is sent to investigate.  Davies discovers Cregg preparing for a long nighttime march in wintry weather on the [[Brecon Beacons]] mountain range. Danny infiltrates the base, disguised in uniform, and drugs Cregg's coffee. Danny follows Cregg on the march and makes him confess before the drug sends him into shock to die of [[hypothermia]].  For their last target, their plan is to crash a remote-controlled truck into McCann's car. With the help of the inexperienced Jake ([[Michael Dorman]]), Meier kills McCann; however, Logan and his men were watching over McCann. A gunfight ensues, and Jake accidentally kills Meier. Danny and Davies part ways. Davies is tracked down by Logan's men, and is hit by a truck and killed while trying to escape.  Danny returns to Oman and gives the sheikh the last confession, which he has faked. Hunter is released, while Danny heads back to Australia and reunites with Anne ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]), a childhood acquaintance. Soon, he is informed by the Agent that there is one last man who participated in the sheikh's sons' murders and that this man, Ranulph Fiennes, is about to release a book about his experiences in the SAS.  Danny sends Anne to [[France]] so Hunter can protect her. The sheikh’s son confirms that Harris was innocent. Logan, meanwhile, traces Danny through the Agent and sends a team to protect the author, but Jake distracts them, allowing Danny to shoot Fiennes. He only wounds the man, however, taking pictures that appear to show him dead. Logan captures Danny, taking him to an abandoned warehouse, but then a government agent arrives and reveals that the British government is behind the events because of the sheikh's valuable oil reserves. A three-way battle ensues, with Danny escaping and Logan shooting the government agent.  In [[Paris]], the Agent tries to kidnap Anne for ransom, but Hunter beats the henchman and shoots the Agent in the leg. Hunter seems threatening at first, but spares his life.  Danny and Hunter head to Oman to give the sheikh the pictures. However, Logan arrives first, tells the sheikh the pictures are fake and then stabs him to death. The sheikh's son does not care; he gives Logan the money. Hunter spots Logan leaving, and they chase after him, along with the sheikh's men.  After stopping the sheikh's men, Danny and Hunter confront Logan on a desert road. Hunter takes some of the money for his expenses and his family. They leave the remainder, telling Logan that he will need it to start a new life after killing the government agent and acting against the wishes of the Feather Men and the British government.

 The story begins with Cyril, a 11-year-old boy in a [[children's home]] in the working class town of Seraing near Liege, attempting to reach his father by phone. His single father, no mother is ever mentioned, promised him that he would only live there for 30 days. The children's home staff tells him to hang up the phone since once again his father is not going to answer and go outside to play with the other children. Cyril refuses and when the phone is disconnected he bites a carer then runs from the director's office, attempting to abscond by climbing over a fence with two carers on his heels. He is pulled from the fence and restrained before being returned to the children's home, where he is later seen sleeping in a dormitory as forlorn music plays. Soon after Cyril absconds again successfully by lying to a carer that he needs the toilet one day after school, when he is supposed to be outside playing with the other kids. Instead he flees through a side door and takes a city bus alone in search of his father.  To get inside the building he uses the intercom to buzz the medical clinic and lies saying he fell off his bike. He goes directly to his father's apartment though and bangs on the door until a neighbor tells him to go away because no one is there. When the caretakers find him, Cyril flees to a doctor’s office that buzzed him into the building, where he grabs onto a woman in the waiting room. She says she doesn't mind if he holds her, only don't squeeze so tight. Trying to alleviate the situation, the caretakers take Cyril to the empty apartment, confirming that his father has really abandoned him.  The next morning, the woman from the doctor's office, Samantha, shows up with Cyril’s bike. She says she bought it from someone in the projects, but Cyril thinks it was stolen from his dad. He likes Samantha though, and asks if she would take him in on weekends. She agrees and Cyril begins to spend much time at home and in her beauty salon. Samantha and her partner Gilles are very good to Cyril providing for a carefree typical childhood experience. In the local neighborhood he enjoys playing with other children, running errands, and most of all riding his beloved bike for hours on end. Still his refusal to accept his father's abandonment continues to haunt him and prevent him from thriving in this healthy newfound environment even after discovering through an old personal ad that his father actually sold his bike. One night in Samantha's home, where Cyril has his own bedroom, he gets up and goes to Samantha's bedroom, only to run back to his own room when he sees Samantha and Gilles undressed in bed with implied sex. Samantha follows him back to his bedroom to find out what is his problem and he tells her that he is okay but just really wants his father. In response to this, without permission from neither the children's home director nor Cyril's psychologist, who has advised against doing so to protect his emotional stability, Samantha soon tracks down Cyril's father by contacting the police department and drives Cyril to see him in another town.  When Cyril's father does not come to meet with them at the agreed location and time, they go looking for him at Cyril's insistence. At his new address, they encounter a woman who is hostile and suspicious, but tells them Cyril's father is at her restaurant preparing for the day. At the restaurant, after much knocking and shouting, they finally come face to face with his father, who reluctantly invites Cyril inside while Samantha elects to remain outside to give them privacy. Inside the restaurant, Cyril follows his deliberately aloof father around the kitchen asking why he still has to stay at the children's home to which his father non-chalantly responds "What? They are not nice to you?" giving Cyril no indication of when he will live with him again. Finally, after giving him a snack and writing down his cellphone number to call later, he tells  Cyril he has to leave and let him work. He walks Cyril to the door and asks him to wait outside while he speaks privately with Samantha inside. Cyril's father admits to Samantha that he has no intentions of ever raising Cyril alone now that his grandmother is dead, has started a new life which has no place for Cyril, and tells her Cyril is her problem now asking that she tell Cyril this. Back outside Samantha asks Cyril what his father said to him about future contact then marches him straight back to the restaurant door demanding that Cyril's father be honest with his son. His father tells him he must stay either at the children's home or with Samantha, because he doesn't care to see him again. On the way back home, Cyril has such a severe nervous breakdown that Samantha has to stop the car and hold him until he calms down.  Cyril, heartbroken by his father's rejection, turns to Samantha for comfort. But despite Samantha's care, Cyril is soon taken under the wing of Wesker, - an adopted [[pseudonym]] from the [[Resident Evil]] [[Albert Wesker|character]] - a local [[gang leader]] known as "The Dealer". When Cyril stays out late one evening and does not even bother to use his cellphone to call to check in, Samantha and her partner go looking for him and are none too pleased that he's keeping company with ne'er do wells when they happen upon him. Cyril's fresh mouth doesn't help matters and this leads to an argument between the couple with Gilles demanding that Cyril apologize and telling Samantha she must choose between the two of them. Samantha chooses Cyril and Gilles gets out of the car furious. Samantha crying and upset then gets into the driver's seat to drive them home. Cyril still fails to understand how much Samantha cares for him however as he has no concept of unconditional love and continues to run wild with Wesker almost ruining his chance at a good life completely soon after.  One night rather than go out to a movie with his new friend and the boy's parents as he has been invited to do, Cyril throws a temper tantrum and demands to be allowed to go off out to roam the streets alone instead. He doesn't tell Samantha that he's supposed to meet Wesker to commit a crime of assault and theft, but she figures out that something is going on, refuses him permission, and tries her hardest to keep him indoors by blocking the doors. In frustration and uncontrolled anger, Cyril screams he does not want to be with Samantha anymore to try to manipulate her, but she tells him to go right ahead and call the orphanage's director to come pick him up if that's what he wants, but he won't be leaving the house to run the streets like a hooligan regardless. His anger boils over and in a last ditch effort to get his way, Cyril stabs Samantha on the arm with a pair of scissors and bolts out the door while she's crying and in shock. At The Dealer’s prompting, Cyril robs a [[newsstand]] owner and his son, knocking them down with a [[baseball bat]]. The Dealer, fearing Cyril had been identified, forces him to keep quiet and keep the money. Cyril tries giving it to his father only to be rejected and chased away as his father does not want to get caught by the law. Dejected, Cyril returns to Samantha and finally accepts her care for him. He apologizes for hurting her arm. The robbery is settled through [[mediation]], where Cyril with Samantha by his side apologizes personally to the owner, who accepts, but his son does not and, in a chance encounter, tries to get his revenge. Shortly after the case is sorted out, the shop owner's son against his father's wishes confronts Cyril as he is riding on his bike to buy charcoal for a cookout. In the ensuing chase, Cyril climbs a tree and falls when struck by a rock the son throws. While he lies unconscious, the owner and son discuss what lies to tell the police and dispose of possible evidence that could be used against them, because they figure Cyril is either dead or dying. While they're talking however, Cyril regains consciousness and declines the suggestion that an ambulance be called although he has been knocked senseless. The shop owner and son watch aghast as Cyril picks up the charcoal, gets on his bike, and pedals away as if nothing happened.

Despite the urging of his wife Shel, he has not worked since, and they are running out of money. Shel organises a dinner party to which she invites Gal and his latest girlfriend, Fiona, a [[human resources]] manager. During the evening, Gal reveals he has a new job for them, which Shel encourages him to take. Meanwhile, Fiona goes to the toilet, carves a symbol on the back of the bathroom mirror, and takes a tissue that Jay had used to mop up his blood after a shaving accident. Jay accepts the job, and the two meet the shadowy client, who has a list of three people he wants killed. The employer unexpectedly cuts Jay's hand and his own, so that the contract is effectively signed in blood.   Their first target, a priest, appears to recognise Jay and thanks him just before being killed. The second name on the list is an archivist who keeps a collection of horrific, sickening videos of an undisclosed nature. He also thanks Jay, who, out of disgust for the videos, tortures and savagely beats him to death with a hammer. Jay insists on chasing down and killing the archivist's associates, and as Gal looks into their files, he finds a folder on himself and Jay, including details of their Kiev mission. Although they do not recognise it, the file includes the symbol that Fiona carved in Jay's mirror.   Gal informs Jay that while raiding the safe in the home of the second target, he took enough money to cover the total sum they would receive for the contract. The pair decide to abandon the contract and return home. When his cut hand becomes infected, Jay visits his doctor, only to find that his regular doctor has been replaced by another man who will only give him cryptic advice. Jay and Gal return to their client and offer to find replacements to kill the last name on the list. The client refuses and says that both hitmen and their families will be killed if they do not complete the contract. Shel takes their son Sam to the family's cottage for safekeeping while Jay and Gal go back to work.   Their final mark is a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] who lives in a [[English country house|mansion]]. While observing the house, the pair witness a strange ceremony in the woods that culminates in [[human sacrifice]]. Jay opens fire with an assault rifle, and the leader of the ceremony presents himself for Jay to execute. The remaining masked cultists chase the hitmen into an underground complex, where Gal is disemboweled, forcing Jay to perform a mercy killing on his friend. Emerging from the tunnels, Jay flees to the family cottage and meets with Shel. When he goes outside, he sees that their car's tyres have been slashed and lit torches have been placed around the nearby field. Jay attempts to locate their attackers, but he is knocked unconscious. Inside the cottage, Shel arms herself and shoots several invaders.  Jay awakens in the field, surrounded by the masked cultists, who strip him and place a mask over his face. He is confronted by his last victim, "The Hunchback", a masked and cloaked person armed with a knife. After a brutal knife fight, Jay triumphs, only to discover that the Hunchback was his wife with Sam strapped to her back. Shel appears to laugh as she dies. The cultists applaud and remove their masks, revealing Fiona, the hitmen's client, and the man from the doctor's office amongst their number. Jay is crowned by the cultists.  
Killer Joe (film)
 In [[West Dallas]], [[Texas]], 22-year-old drug dealer Chris Smith comes to the house of his father Ansel and step-mother Sharla, after his mother, Adele, threw him out of her house. To make matters worse, Adele stole his cocaine money and spent it on fixing her car, and now Chris is desperate to pay off his debt to his dealer, Digger Soames, so he decides to murder his mother to collect the $50,000 [[life insurance]] of which his 20 year old sister Dottie is the sole [[beneficiary]]. Assuming Dottie would share the money with Chris and their father, Chris manages to rope the dim-witted Ansel into hiring Joe Cooper, a [[Police officer|police]] [[detective]] who has a side career as a [[Hitman|contract killer]], to kill Adele (Ansel's ex-wife) to get the money. Chris and Ansel decide that after paying Joe from the proceeds of the life insurance policy, they will split the remainder four ways between themselves, Dottie, and Ansel's wife Sharla. Dottie hears the plan as they are talking, and agrees that it's a good idea.  The plan almost fails when Joe demands all of the money in advance, which of course Chris and Ansel do not have. However, Joe is interested in the odd, childlike Dottie and offers to take her as a "retainer" until the insurance comes through. Through Dottie's interaction with Joe, it is revealed that Adele tried to kill Dottie once when she was an infant. Joe "dates" Dottie and then appears to be staying over at their home and having sex with her regularly. Chris has a change of heart and asks him to call off the hit, only to discover that Joe has already killed Adele. With Chris' reluctant help, Joe hides the body in a car and torches it.  After Adele's death is discovered, the family learns that the insurance beneficiary is actually Rex, Adele's boyfriend, rather than her daughter Dottie.  Chris then admits he originally heard the details about the policy from Rex, who also told him about Joe. Ansel then realizes that Rex duped Chris into hiring Joe to kill Adele. Immediately afterwards, Chris tries to talk Dottie into running away with him to escape Digger, who has already had two of his goons severely beat Chris up for not having repaid him. Dottie says she will go with him, but she must see Joe again first.  After Ansel and Sharla return home from Adele's funeral, they find Joe inside with Dottie. He comes out of her room and asks increasingly pointed questions of Sharla, which ultimately leads her to admit that she knew the policy was really $100,000 ([[Double indemnity|accidental death is double]]).  Joe shows them a check of that amount payable to Rex, as well as incriminating photos which prove Sharla was having an affair with Rex. Angered, Ansel declines to protect Sharla when Joe punches her and forces her to simulate [[oral sex]] on a fried chicken drumstick.  Joe knows Chris is coming to take Dottie away and he threatens to kill Ansel and Sharla if they don't stop him. After Chris is seated for dinner, Joe announces that he and Dottie will be married. Chris refuses to let them, ordering Dottie to leave with him; Joe tells her to stay where she is. For a moment Dottie sits there, then she gets up and turns and, while the men yell out at her, Chris threatens Joe with a gun and the two struggle. Ansel and Sharla jump in to assist Joe as he brutally beats Chris, not wanting to be killed by Joe if Chris flees with Dottie. In all the confusion, Dottie recovers the gun and, in a rage, she fires several shots, killing Chris and seriously wounding Ansel. Dottie turns the gun on Joe, telling him that she is pregnant. Joe appears overjoyed as he inches closer to Dottie. The film ends just as Dottie moves her finger back on the trigger.

When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a young woman Renuka 'Renu' ([[Karthika Nair]]) who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, he is able to secure the [[memory card]] of the camera. The police catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer, he shows the photos to them, who identify everyone except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, he again meets Renuka, who has newly joined as Article Editor. Saraswathi 'Saro' ([[Piaa Bajpai]]) also works in his office and has feelings for Ashwin, who does not reciprocate.  Settled in her new job, Renuka writes a cover story about a politician Aalavandhan ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), describing his [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|attempt to marry a minor]]. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Aalavandhan), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in [[Child marriage in India|child marriage]] in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Renuka to fall in love with Ashwin, which the latter reciprocates. Saro is initially jealous of the love between Ashwin and Renuka, but later accepts it and gets over Ashwin.  Meanwhile, Vasanthan Perumal ([[Ajmal Ameer]]), a recent graduate and engineer who is Ashwin's former college mate, strives hard to enter the politics by contesting the upcoming election. He is contesting against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money. No one cares about Vasanthan and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their party name is ''Siragugal'' (feathers). Ashwin and Renuka find out about Vasanthan's election campaign, and they and the entire ''Dina Anjal'' team extend their support to the campaign, covering it extensively, much to the chagrin of Aalavandhan and the Chief Minister Yogeswaran 'Yogi' ([[Prakash Raj]]).  One night, Vasanthan's party organises an election campaign meeting. Ashwin, photographing the event, receives a text message from Saro that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Vasanthan is speaking. Ashwin manages to save Vasanthan just before the bomb explodes. Later, Ashwin finds Saro fatally wounded near the blast site. Saro struggles to tell something to Ashwin and Renuka before she dies. Ashwin, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, finds out that Saro was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robbery and this unknown killer, concluding that the Naxalite leader killed Saro.  A few days later, Renuka notices that Vasanthan's photo in their newspaper was cut from a college class photo, where Ashwin is also present. Confronted by Renuka, Ashwin tells her that he and Vasanthan studied in the same college and were best friends. He also tells her that he is happy for Vasanthan's success and is wholeheartedly supporting his election campaign.  In the election, Vasanthan's party wins by a huge majority and Vasanthan becomes the Chief Minister. He orders the release of 20 naxals on [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]], citing humanity. Shocked on hearing this news, Ashwin rushes to the secretariat to meet Vasanthan. In Vasanthan's office, Ashwin notices that the Naxalite leader who killed Saro is there, talking with Vasanthan. Ashwin airs his grievances to Vasanthan, who ignores him. Ashwin then follows the leader to his hideout. At the same time, Vasanthan orders the Tamil Nadu Police to go kill the Naxals at their hideout and the Police Commandos surround the perimeter of that place. Ashwin, already at the hideout, confronts the Naxalite leader, whose name is Kadhir ([[Bose Venkat]]) and finds out from him that Vasanthan had made a deal with the Naxalites to help him win the election. They orchestrated events such as the burning of a hut and saving the woman in that hut (who was also a Naxalite) in order to win people's sympathy. In the same vein, they had planted a bomb on the stage where Vasanthan was speaking during his meeting. Saro had found out the truth about Vasanthan, but was fatally assaulted by him so that she does not reveal his character and intentions to anybody. Ashwin realises that Saro had tried to warn him and Renuka about Vasanthan's true character before dying and also that now Vasanthan is double-crossing the Naxalites and is planning to kill them as a show of achievement. Ashwin records this confession using his [[Camera phone|mobile phone camera]] and sends it to Renuka, who plans to publish this story in their newspaper. Vasanthan then arrives and kills Kadhir. He also tries to kill Ashwin. However, Ashwin triggers a [[land mine]] there which explodes, killing Vasanthan, while Ashwin manages to escape.  Vasanthan's party members arrive at the hideout on hearing the news that Vasanthan had died. Seeing their innocence, Ashwin forces Renuka not to reveal the truth about Vasanthan because his party members would get into serious trouble and lose their seats just for supporting Vasanthan. They did not know about Vasanthan's true character and intentions and supported him, believing his false claims of a "healthy government". Instead, Renuka publishes an article saying that Vasanthan had sacrificed his life fighting the Naxalites and died as a [[martyr]]. Ashwin and Renuka submit their resignations to the Editor for falsified reporting, but he rejects their resignations and tells them to cover the upcoming election.

The movie "Lanka" begins in the present day Mumbai with Anju ([[Tia Bajpai]]) narrating about her past. Jaswant Sisodia ([[Manoj Bajpayee]]) is the don of a small town in UP, India called [[Bijnor]]. He rules the place and the police and politicians support him. He is in love with Anju, a doctor. Her father ([[Yatin Karyekar]]) is the Chief Medical Officer of Bijnor. Anju is actually sexually exploited by Sisodia. Every night after taking drinks, he comes to her house and sleeps with her. She tries to commit suicide but her father stops her. She tries to run away but the house is guarded by Sisodia's men. Her father tries to meet the cops but they don't want to entertain him. Also, we never know how Anju became Sisodia's mistress.  The story takes a turn when Chhote ([[Arjan Bajwa]]) enters Sisodia's house. He is Sisodia's mentor's son and Sisodia loves him like his own brother. Chhote sees Anju and from the very moment gets attracted to her. He asks Sisodia who she is, but he gets no reply. Later, Sisodia tells him to take care of a property near the town. When he goes there, he is beaten up the nearby villagers who claim the land is theirs. Wounded, he fights back later at dawn, killing 7 people. Sisodia slaps him for the murders but then loves him and sees to it that he is left off by the court as innocent. Because of this, the villagers and the local cop, Sr Supdt of Police Bhup Singh ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]) start making a plan to kill Sisodia.  Meanwhile, Anju goes along with Chhote for her master's exams. After the exams, she requests him to kill her but he tells her that one needs courage to live and not to die. Slowly he starts to fall in love with her. With an inner fight between the right and the wrong, loyalty and empathy, he leaves Sisodia's house and comes and stays at his place. Sisodia, drunk and hurt comes to meet him, fights with him and when he's about to leave, he is shot by an assassin (sent by the cop and villagers). Chhote then protects Sisodia from the firing but gets shot in the back. Sisodia saves his life by taking him to the hospital and vows to take revenge.  In the meantime, Anju who works in the same hospital starts to fall in love with Chhote. Also, Anju's father has now joined hands with a crime branch officer of Lucknow Tyagi ([[Manish Choudhary]]) and files a case against Sisodia. Then Sisodia starts taking revenge by killing all the people involved and it ends by Chhote, who is discharged from the hospital killing the SSP in front of Sisodia.  Sisodia comes to know that Anju's father has filed a case against him. He along with Chhote takes him to a brothel and warns him to withdraw the case otherwise he'll make her into a prostitute and sell her in Dubai. Chhote is shocked to hear and Anju's father, who is unable to bear the shock and grief, commits suicide after reaching home.  Chhote, realizing that he has seen enough, goes to the crime branch officer Tyagi and files a case against Sisodia. The crime branch officer tells him that he would be termed a traitor by some and righteous by others but whatever he's doing is correct. Sisodia comes to know about Chhote's change of mind and in the night as Chhote and Anju are leaving Bijnor on their mobike, he confronts and stops them. Chhote tells him that he is wrong and needs to leave Anju. As Chhote turns and moves towards his bike, Sisodia shoots Chhote. But after shooting him, he realizes his mistake and goes towards Chhote. Chhote dies in Sisodia's arms. Sisodia then looks upwards to see that Anju is pointing the gun towards him. He begs her to shoot him as he cannot live without Chhote. She shoots him to death.  The movie ends with Anju thanking Chhote for saving her life and mentions that Ram is not required every time to save Sita's life. A Vibhishan is enough.  
Larry Crowne
  Larry Crowne, a middle-aged [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[veteran]], is fired from his job at a [[big-box store]] due to a lack of college education, despite his seniority and exemplary work.  Larry, who is divorced and lives alone, cannot find a job and could lose his house. Larry's neighbor, Lamar, advises him to enroll at East Valley Community College and get an education.  Subsisting on unemployment benefits and unable to afford to drive his [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]], Larry buys a scooter from Lamar. At the college, he becomes part of a colorful community of outcasts, also-rans, and the overlooked all trying to find a better future for themselves.  Two of the classes he takes are speech, taught by Mercedes Tainot and economics, taught by Dr. Ed Matsutani.  While he initially struggles in speech class, he does very well in economics.  Mercedes drinks at home after school because she is unhappily married to Dean, a former professor-turned-writer-turned-blogger.  In reality, Dean spends his days looking at internet porn.  Larry's economics classmate Talia invites him to join a club of scooter riders led by her boyfriend Dell Gordo. She also updates Larry's home decor, hair style, and wardrobe. Larry's friend Frank, who runs the diner, offers him a job to help make ends meet, as Larry had been a Navy cook.  After a night with Dean goes horribly wrong, Mercedes is left alone at a bus stop, where Larry and his scooter gang notice her.  Larry offers her a ride home, which Mercedes reluctantly accepts.  On their way home they witness Dean getting arrested for [[drunk driving]]. At her front door, Mercedes offers Larry to kiss her and they hug (Mercedes thinks that they are kissing). She wants to have sex as well, but Larry declines, not wanting to take advantage of her inebriated state.  When Dean arrives home the following morning he finds all of his possessions on the front lawn.  Realizing there is no way he will not lose his house, Larry uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to begin a [[strategic default|strategic foreclosure]]. Mercedes, meanwhile, warns Larry not to disclose the events of the previous night, and remains under the false impression that he is romantically involved with the much-younger Talia. It disappoints Larry, who had been excited about Mercedes' interest in him. He goes back to concentrating on his studies and his new job instead.  Mercedes runs into Talia, who is telling Frances, her English teacher, that she will be dropping out of college to start a [[thrift store]]. Mercedes finds out that Talia and Larry are just friends.  Later, Frances comes over to Mercedes' apartment to provide emotional support due to her divorcing Dean.  Finals now come, and Larry is scheduled last. His speech is about his travels around the world while in the Navy. Larry is given a big round of applause by his classmates and an A-plus grade from Mercedes, who is now happier in her life, and has rediscovered her passion for teaching.  A short while later, Mercedes and Frances show up at Larry's diner. She lets him know that he was an excellent student, to which he replies that she was an excellent teacher.  When the next term begins, some of the students from Mercedes' speech course register for her [[Shakespeare]] class, but Larry is not with them. He is seen taking Dr. Matsutani's second-term Economics class.  Mercedes walks to her office and sees a note from Larry on the door, which is an invitation for French toast, with the address to his new apartment. She drives there and they kiss.  
Largo Winch II
 [[Largo Winch (film)|3 years before his death]], Nerio Winch, while driving from a business meeting in [[Hong Kong]], informs Freddy, his bodyguard, that he found his son, Largo, in a village in [[Burma]], and orders Freddy to tail him. Meanwhile, Largo has just saved a group of villagers from a massacre caused by a local militia, led by General Min. While healing the locals on a secluded spot with his lover, Malunai, a French man named Simon Ovronnaz arrives in the village along with several survivors he picked up with his pick-up. However, when he informs them that he was employed by a man who worked for Min, the locals, led by Kadjang, severely beat him up. However, Largo steps by his side and accidentally wounds Kadjang with his own blade, and he is banished from the village, and Malunai denounces him. Largo leaves with Simon and they leave Burma, Largo going elsewhere, while Simon heads for [[Bangkok]].  In present day, Largo, [[Largo Winch (film)|gaining the leadership of the W Group]], announces that he is selling his entire company and all of its shares, and that he will donate all of the money of the shares to charity. He enlists the help of Alexandre Jung, his father's partner and childhood friend (and one of the few who knew of Largo's existence), also a former director of the [[Red Cross]], and W Group's current director, Dwight Cochrane. However, as he is signing the papers on Nerio's yacht, ''[[Neretva]]'', a Hong Kong special forces unit, led by an [[United Nations|UN]] investigator, Diane Francken, arrives, holding charges of [[crimes against humanity]] against Largo for cooperation for the massacre in Burma, since General Min was paid from Nerio's secret account called Pandora. While searching Largo's yacht, they also find Freddy strangled in his room. Largo realizes that, since Freddy was tailing him in Burma during the massacre and knew of his innocence, he was murdered.  As Francken publicly announces that she has a witness against Largo, he finds a phone number of a private bank in [[Switzerland]] and calls it, and he is given the information about the Pandora account and that it contains 68 million dollars. Holding this a secret, he, against the objections of his lawyers and Cochrane, books the flight to Bangkok to personally meet with Francken to meet the witness. He also instructs his personal butler, Gauthier, to go with him to Bangkok and to locate Simon, since he worked for General Min's associate. When they arrive in Bangkok, Gauthier leaves to find Simon while Largo goes to the UN embassy. Upon arriving, Largo is shocked to discover that the witness is Malunai, who falsely testifies against Largo for being involved in the massacre, and Francken also reports to him that General Min was paid from a secret account that Nerio owned, called Pandora. Largo violently objects to the accusations and strikes Malunai, and he is detained by Francken. However, Thailand ministry drops his charges and sets him free, and he is picked up by Cochrane. However, after getting his personal items back, he finds a "Sorry" note given to him by Malunai. He also finds out that she was deported back to Burma. Against Cochrane's protests, Largo leaves. Francken, angry for the deportation of Malunai and Largo's acquittal, finds out that Largo has contacted the private bank and goes to [[Zurich]].  Largo arrives in Burma, where the local militia awaits him to transport him to General Min. However, en route, the jeep transporting Largo is attacked by the local resistance movement led by Kadjang, who is seeking revenge against Largo. However, Largo tells him his story and convinces him to join sides with him. They head to General Min's base, with Kudjang and his men disguised as soldiers, and Kudjang's men detonate several gas tanks, creating a diversion, while Largo releases the prisoners, and also Malunai herself, who reveals that Min forced her to falsely testify with the threat that they will kill her son. They head to General Min's hut, only to find him with Malunai's son, Noom. Min reveals that, while he was paid half in advance to massacre the village, he never got the rest of the money, and orders Largo to make a 25 million$ to Min's account. Largo obeys, but as he completes the transfer, he attacks Min and takes Noom and Malunai, and they escape by boat.  Meanwhile, Francken, who ordered the executives of the bank to record their calls, finds out about Largo's call to transfer the money to Lin. Seeing this as evidence, she publicly announces this, causing W Group's shares to massively drop. Cochrane, much to his dismay, finds out that the W Group will be bought by a corrupt industrialist called Nazatchov, who is at odds with Largo since he once attacked him during a business meeting. Since the prices were lowered, Nazatchov now has enough money to buy the group and already pays 5 billion dollars in advance. In Burma, Largo and Malunai arrive at a local hotel, where they rekindle their romance, and she reveals to Largo that Noom is his son, having impregnated her before he left. Largo contacts Gauthier, who has found Simon, and instructs him to arrive at the hotel. Meanwhile, General Min, who escaped the base, arrives at a rendezvous point where he is picked up by a Serbian mercenary called Lazarevic, who informs him that he is not on Min's payroll, but actually is working for someone else, and strangles Min to death.  Gauthier and Simon meet up with Largo, and Simon reveals that he was paid by a man named Thomas to drive him through Burma. He arrived with him at General Min's base, where he paid in advance for Min to organize the massacre using the Pandora account. However, when Nerio found out about the massacre, he refused to let Thomas to pay the rest of the money, and he was shot by Min while Simon secretly observed this from the car while he was behind the walls. Simon left, picking up the rest of the survivors among the way, before he arrived at the village where Largo stayed at. Later on, Malunai reveals that she was abducted by Lazarevic's mercenaries, and Largo finds a tracking device in her. Just then, Lazarevic's mistress Anna and another henchman arrive, and Largo manages to kill both of them, but not before Anna strangles Malunai to death. Largo picks up Noom and he leaves with Simon and Gauthier. Soon after, Lazarevic arrives at the hotel, and, after finding his man and Anna dead, he swears revenge against Largo.  Largo contacts the private bank again and transfers only 7 dollars to another account, and then contacts Cochrane, who is in the car with Nazatchov, and informs him that he is heading to Zurich. Nazatchov, overhearing this, instructs Lazarevic to go to Zurich and kill him. However, Largo heads for Bangkok and secretly tails Lazarevic's group, who is departing in a private jet. He and Simon tie up the pilots in their hotel room and take their uniforms and await for Lazarevic, who board the plane, and they head for Zurich, intending to tail Lazarevic when they land. However, during the flight, Lazarevic finds out about the pilots and they corner Simon and Largo. They fight them, and Simon opens the plane doors, causing a decompression which ejects Simon out of the plane. Largo jumps out with a parachute, and Lazarevic follows them. In mid-air, Lazarevic fights Largo, who knocks him out and disables his parachute and saves Simon, while Lazarevic dies after falling on the ground.  Meanwhile, Francken finds out about the 7 dollar transfer and investigates Lazarevic's account, finding out that he was on Nazatchov's payroll, realizing that Largo is being set up. Largo and Simon go to Jung's house, and Simon stays in Jung's house while Jung takes him to Francken to clear out his name. However, when they arrive at the UN building, Jung injects him with a strong sedative, and reveals that Thomas is actually his son; Thomas worked for Nerio by making new deals across the world, and set up the secret bank account Pandora for Thomas to pay to the locals in exchange for information. Thomas instructed General Min to organize the massacre since the area was rich with [[nickel]]. However, Nerio was unaware of the massacre and when Thomas informed him about this, he refused to authorize him to pay the rest of the amount, disgusted by Thomas's actions.  Jung also reveals that he made a deal with Nazatchov, who would take over the company in exchange for help, and that Lazarevic killed Lin on Jung's orders, and that Largo was the scapegoat so he would be humiliated and sentenced to prison for life as a revenge.  Jung leaves to kill Francken to kill her so he could prevent her to clear Largo's name, while Largo lies sedated on the floor, unable to move. However, Simon, who found pictures of Thomas and realized Jung's plan, arrives at the UN building and gives Largo [[sugar]] to remedy the effects, and Largo instructs Simon to call the police while he heads to rescue Francken. He finds Jung holding Francken at knife point, and shouts about Thomas's immoral and unethical actions, which Jung refuses to accept, wanting Largo to beg for Francken's life just as he begged Nerio to save Thomas. However, Francken momentarily distracts Jung, and Largo runs up to him and knocks him over the stairwell, killing him.  In the aftermath, Largo is cleared of all charges by Francken, and Nazatchov is unable to buy the company since the stocks have raised high after Largo's name was cleared. Largo travels back to Burma, where he and Noom are standing by Malunai's grave while Gauthier and Simon are watching them, where Largo promises to take care of Noom and that Malunai is watching both of them, before they walk away together.

Leafie, A Hen into the Wild
 Leafie (잎싹, leaf (잎) + sprout (싹)) lives on a [[chicken farm]] with many other egg-laying hens that are in [[battery cage]]s. She dreams of being a mother, however she can't incubate her own [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s. Dreaming of having her own young,  she devises an escape plan; she faints, causing the farmer to think her dead and take her from the cage to dump with other dead hens. After the farmer leaves, Leafie escapes only to be confronted and threatened by a one-eyed [[weasel]] known as One-Eye (애꾸눈 "Aeggunun"). Her life is saved through the intervention of Wanderer (a [[mallard duck]], 나그네 "Nagnae") who helps her to escape but then leaves without a word.  Leafie returns to the Farm to join the group of farm animals who reside outside the egg farm in the yard, but the barnyard [[rooster]] argues with Leafie and refuses to allow her into his flock, insisting that her place is to simply spend her life laying eggs.  With nowhere else to go, Leafie leaves the Farm and arrives in the wild, where she meets Mr. [[Otter]] (달수 "Dalsu"), who has heard about Leafie and helps her find a place to live on Wanderer's behalf. The now wild hen meets Wanderer again, and discovers he has a mate. However, that very night, One-Eye attacks and Wanderer's mate tragically dies.  After hearing the commotion, Leafie enters the nest and finds a single egg. Wanderer accepts Leafie's intended care of the egg for a few days, meaning to exact revenge on One-Eye and ensure their protection. Wanderer instructs Leafie to take his unborn child to the everglades, telling her she will understand why in time. That night One-Eye returns, and Wanderer engages her in a fight to the death. Leafie witnesses the battle and Wanderer is killed by One-Eye, leaving Leafie upset.  After Wanderer's death, the egg hatches into a duckling that imprints on Leafie, thinking that the hen is his mother. Leafie names him "Chorok head" or "Greenie" (초록머리, 초록 in the movie), and together they head to the glade where Wanderer asked.  Leafie raises Greenie as her son and watches him grow up. Mr. Otter teaches Greenie to swim, and later enlists the help from a local [[bat]] and an [[owl]] to help a then-teenaged Greenie learn how to fly. One day, however, Greenie tries befriending some [[mandarin duck]]s who he meets, but they make fun of Leafie, who they think is crazy. Meanwhile, Leafie is saddened to learn the local water birds don't like or accept her in their community. She then meets up with Greenie, who has been teased by the other ducks and blames Leafie for him being an outcast. After discovering that they are indeed both different, Greenie leaves Leafie, feeling that he doesn't need her anymore.  Hearing about this, Mr. Otter attempts to comfort her by telling her about Wanderer - him having been the guard duck of his flock and of how he crippled his wing while fighting One-Eye, who lost one of her eyes in the struggle, and of how Wanderer was subsequently imprisoned by the farmer although only temporarily. Greenie then endures his own struggle with the Farm; after coming across it he is captured by the Farmer and only saved thanks to the interventions of Chirpie, a friend of Leafie's, who warns Leafie about what's happened.  To distract the farmer, Leafie, with the help of Mr. Otter, releases all of the hens from the chicken farm and she reunites with Greenie when Mr. Otter frees him by biting off the string that held him down. Rooster confronts Leafie before she could escape with Mr. Otter and Greenie, and in a short scuffle, all of the animals discover Rooster's comb is fake and forces him to work for them. Leafie escapes the farm with Greenie and Mr. Otter, and both Leafie and Greenie reconcile after Mr. Otter departs. The two are suddenly confronted by One-Eye, who then hunts down Greenie to eat him. Despite Leafie's intervention, the weasel managed to pin Greenie down on an old tree, which breaks off and sends the two plummeting over a cliff. Believing Greenie to be dead, Leafie mourns, but Greenie escaped certain death by successfully learning how to fly while One-Eye managed to save herself by grabbing hold of a ledge on the cliff.  A flock of ducks soon come during the [[autumn]] season, and Leafie realizes what Wanderer meant when he instructed her to take his egg to the everglades. An adult Greenie goes to meet the flock and learns about an upcoming contest to decide who will be the new guard duck of the flock. The ducks flee from Greenie after seeing the human string that was still wrapped around his leg from his past encounter with the farmer. Leafie gives Greenie her support and reassures him to participate in the contest after taking a portion of the human string from his leg just in time. Greenie returns to the flock and announced that he wants to be in the contest as well, quickly forming a rivalry with another duck named Red Head.  During the race, Greenie recalls the words of his mentors, and successfully wins the contest, becoming the new guard duck of the flock. After the competition, Leafie finds a nest of baby weasels which she begins to take care of. While Rooster is finding a home with Mr. Otter after escaping from the farm, Greenie tries to find Leafie to say his goodbyes but comes across One-Eye once again and saves a female duck from the hungry carnivore. Their brief scuffle lands them in front of Leafie and the nest of baby weasels, and One-Eye pins down Greenie, preparing to kill him. Leafie attempts to help Greenie, but One-Eye threatens her to not come near. During the confrontation, the baby weasels Leafie had been caring for are revealed to be One-Eye's offspring. This makes Leafie realize that the weasel who killed Wanderer and his mate, is now killing to provide food for her kits. After agreeing to not harm the weasel kits in exchange for letting Greenie go, Leafie and Greenie were allowed to escape. Before they leave, Leafie sees how One-Eye, who is malnourished due to the rough winter season, is unable to produce milk to feed her kits.  The flock of ducks prepare to leave the everglades, and Leafie and Greenie say their heartfelt goodbyes to one another before Greenie departs with his flock, now able to set out and see the world. Soon afterwards, One-Eye comes. Leafie, realizing that she's done the best she can do for Greenie, she may not survive the rest of the winter and One-Eye is still unable to produce milk from malnutrition, allows herself to be killed and eaten, so that the baby weasels won't starve.    After One-Eye tearfully kills her, Leafie is implied to be able to fly in spirit, gazing upon Greenie as he flies on.

The Ledge (film)
 Detective Hollis Lucetti ([[Terrence Howard]]) receives news from a doctor that he has been [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] his entire life. Upon reaching home, he questions his wife about who their children's father is.   The story switches to Gavin Nichols ([[Charlie Hunnam]]), an [[Atheism|atheist]], standing on a ledge as if to jump to his death. A small crowd forms below Gavin, and Hollis responds to the emergency. At first it looks like a regular suicide attempt. It is quickly revealed to be more complex than that, as Gavin explains to Hollis that he has no other choice than to jump, or somebody else will die.  The story flashes back and describes the story of the love triangle between Gavin, Shana ([[Liv Tyler]]) and Joe ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]). Shana is the new girl at the hotel where Gavin works. She lives with her husband Joe in an apartment just down the hall from Gavin's. Joe is a [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] who infantilizes Shana. During a visit one night, Gavin and Joe discuss religion. Gavin neatly picks apart Joe's [[Born_again_(Christianity)|born again belief system]], pointing out that most of the people on Earth would go to Hell, even Catholics, if Joe's faith were correct. Gavin points out that a Chinese child who dies in a traffic accident might never even know about Jesus, and therefore has no chance to be born again. Joe's response is that such an example is not proof of God's unfairness, but merely the reason why Christians are called to proselytize. Their discussion heats up into a full blown argument that ends when Shana asks Gavin to leave.  At work, Shana notices Gavin consoling one of his grief-stricken employees with talk about God. He puts on a genuine act as a believer which helps calm the employee down. On a walk with Gavin one day, she confides in him that she used to be a drug addict and a prostitute. She ended up with a [[Prostitution#Etymology_and_terminology|john]] one night who liked to have sex in empty churches. He beat her badly afterward, and Joe discovered her in the sanctuary. Joe helped her turn her life around, and she feels an immense debt of gratitude to him. She tells Gavin that Joe wants them to move to [[Uganda]] to spread God's word.   Gavin and Shana spend more time with each other, and they eventually begin an affair. Joe quickly deduces what is going on and witnesses their assignations. He confronts Gavin as he is leaving for work and insists that he join him for a talk. In his apartment, Joe tells Gavin that he previously had a wife and two kids, but he would leave them at night to score drugs and hookers and do all kinds of depraved things. He lost his family and was drunk in a gutter when he was born again. He believes that, after God had already given him so much, God gave him Shana to take care of. He quotes [[Psalm 23]] to Gavin and forces him at gunpoint to read [[Leviticus]] 20:10, "If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress are to be put to death."  Gavin counters with the story of the adulteress from [[Gospel of John|John 8]], whom Jesus saves by ordering only those without sin to cast a stone at her. Joe agrees that Gavin has a point, but he questions whether Gavin has the conviction to die for his beliefs. The next day, when Shana is supposed to leave Joe, Gavin is waiting for her to call. Joe calls Gavin instead and orders him to the top of a building. Joe has decided that, "I'm more of an Old Testament kind of guy", but instead of killing both Gavin and Shana, only one of them has to die. Joe has Shana at gunpoint and will kill her at noon if Gavin does not jump off the building.   Lucetti grows increasingly desperate to save Gavin. He tells him more about his story, explaining that his wife committed adultery out of love and fear that she would lose her husband.

Legend of the Millennium Dragon
  Legend of the Millennium Dragon (aka [[Onigamiden]]) starts off with a battle between samurai and [[Oni]], "visualized demons that seem to be made of smoke"<ref name=Webb></ref> .  It does not go well for the samurai and as the Oni prepare to make their final push to destroy a local temple, but Monk Gen'un wipes them all out in one blow with his magic powers.  The movie then shifts focus over to Jun Tendo, a shy teenage boy, who is transported 1200 years into Japan's past to the [[Heian era]]. There, he must enlist the aid of the dragon [[Yamata no Orochi]] to resolve a war between humans and Oni.  He is bullied over and over because of his weak appearance and lack of skills.  Jun is then followed and attacked by an Oni, which he runs away from.  While running, Jun finds himself hiding in the temple of Monk Gen'un and is confronted with the truth.  Monk Gen'un starts by telling Jun that he is being targeted by the dark monsters and about the war between humans and Oni back in the [[Heian era]].  Jun passes out and wakes up at the temple where he meets Raiko Minamoto, a highly skilled swordsman that fights alongside of Gen'un.  Jun is treated as royalty and is highly confused.  During the night the temple is attacked by Oni.  The humans retaliate and fight back to protect their temple and their "savior," Jun.  Jun is a descendant of the Magatama clan with a birthmark on his left shoulders.  Only direct bloodlines with that birthmark can awaken the full powers of a mystical dragon named [[Orochi]].  In order to summon the dragon to save Raiko and everyone else in the village, Jun must chant the incantation.  Jun sees that Raiko is in deep trouble and screams his name while awaking the powerful dragon in the process without the incantation.  Jun awakes finding himself riding on the back of Orochi, which becomes Jun's servant and source of power.  Jun comes in conflict with Mizuha, an Oni, and find out that they are not the demons that everyone makes them out to be.  Instead of being demons, the Oni are regular people that wears a mask which causes the visualization of the demons.  Jun shortly finds out a different story than what Gen'un has told him from the Oni and now wants answers.  He feels both side of the stories and does not know who to trust.  Mizuha singles out Jun and asked him to join them and fight to project their cause, but Jun refuses to make such a quick decision because he wants to trust both side.  Jun gets pressured by the Mizuha and calls upon Orochi to escape.  Mizuha jumps on Orochi and escapes with Jun, but they soon hit an Oni-free barrier and gets struck down by magic power.  Jun wakes up to find himself with Tsuna and Kinta, Raiko's fellow swordsman's, who has been searching for Jun to meet up with Raiko.  Gen'un is confronted by a counsel men of the temple and his true plans are exposed.  Jun becomes furious once he finds out that the counsel men dies and calls upon Orochi.  A battle between Oni and Human finally breaks out.  Jun orders to stop the battle, but is attacked by Raiko.  Jun does not recognize Raiko and is told by an Oni that Gen'un used his powers and turned Raiko and his friends into the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] "god-powered suits of armor".<ref name=Webb/>  Raiko and his friends do not have control over their bodies anymore.  Jun finally learns the evil plans of Gen'un and that the counsel men's assassination was Gen'un's doing.  Gen'un wants to obtain true greatness and powers of a God.  Before stopping Gen'un, Jun has to defeat Raiko first.  Jun knows that Raiko is not evil and has no control over his body.  Jun tries to talk Raiko out of fighting but there is no response until he brings up the death of Raiko's father and how they were ordered to death by Gen'un.  Gen'un notices that Raiko is starting to resist the powers given to him and strikes him down, destroying the power of the heavenly kings and defeating Raiko himself.  Jun begins to take the fight seriously and finally knows what he is fighting for.  Mizuha hands over a small mirror like item and a small dagger that contains his true power.  When placed next to each other, they merge and become a sword that Jun uses to fight.  Gen'un then transforms the Four Heavenly Kings into one giant beast and attacks everyone that gets into his way, even his own people.  Everyone tries desperately to take down Gen'un, but he is just too powerful.  Not wanting anymore bloodshed, Jun unleashes all his powers and begins glowing.  Orochi, who has power over the water and controls all water is transformed into its final form, the true Yamata no Orochi and defeats Gen'un. The film ends with Jun back in his own time and in his school uniform, now with confidence and moving on with his life.

Level Up (film)
 In an Air Force base, a sanitation worker accidentally launches a laser into space when trying to swat a fly. The laser hits a satellite and is sent to the Ross Server Farm, straight into the computer game "Maldark: Conqueror of All Worlds", hitting the game's main villain, Maldark.  In Daventry Hills, teenage braniac Wyatt Black ([[Gaelan Connell]]), wildman Danté Ontero (Connor Del Rio) and quarterback Lyle Hugginson ([[Jessie T. Usher]]) have nothing in common in real life: however, all three boys play "Conqueror of All Worlds" as elite team NeverFail (Wyatt as leader Black Death, Lyle as Wizza and Danté as Sir Bickle) though none of them are aware of their true identities. While playing the game one night, the boys push a rod down and soon encounter Maldark who opens a portal into the real world and sends a troll through.  The next day, the trio see the troll on the news and later discover the game is in ruins. Wyatt inadvertently reveals he saw the troll broadcast and the guys discover they all live in the same town. When they meet, they're stunned with each other's true identities and agree to find the troll but are easily outmatched. Upon realizing the troll is a leak from the game, Wyatt hacks the game, reopens the portal and brings out the team's weapons. Although they struggle to use their weapons, the troll is defeated and returns to the game: NeverFail soon finds a message orb from Maldark but Lyle and Danté don't take notice of the threat and the orb is destroyed.  Soon, multiple online ads as well as Wyatt's in-game Bard are released, along with ghouls at the school. After beating the ghouls, the guys find another orb where Maldark reveals his plan: to harness enough energy to leave the game and lead his army to conquer the real world. Afterward, the bard is sent back and the team tries to find a solution: Wyatt suggests finding Max Ross, the game's creator but no one knows where he is, so they decide to just destroy the leaks. At home, Danté is given a strike by his mother, Barbara (Rhoda Griffis), who states one more means he's off to boarding school.  As Wyatt researches Max, he learns his somewhat friend Angie Prietto ([[Aimee Carrero]]) is suspicious of what he's doing. Over the coming weeks, NeverFail continues to fight the leaks and soon find that Max ([[Eric André]]) lives in Daventry Hills: they soon learn by pushing the rod in, they opened the gateway in the process. Although he agrees with the team, Max refuses to help shut down the game.  In town, Danté stops a troll, but because it destroyed Vice Principal Lee's car, he is blamed for it and gets his third strike. At the same time, Lyle's father, the mayor (Geoffrey Williams), pressures him to stop whatever he's been doing to focus on the halftime speech he needs to give as the coming mayoral outcome approaches.

Angie confronts Wyatt on everything and they talk Danté into helping them but Lyle refuses to help any longer: Angie is recruited to take his place and given a glove known as the Fist of Schoolage by Danté, which he looted from the first troll earlier. As they storm the server farm to rescue Max, Lyle reveals his true self to everyone at the game during his speech and leaves to help the others. The sprawl replicates itself upon seeing NeverFail through the security system: the duplicate then sends Angie into the game through a portal, causing Wyatt to go rescue her without his weapon.

Wyatt and Angie escape the game and end up sharing a kiss on inpulse.  Max soon completes the program and Maldark (George Faughnan) is materialized: the former soon agrees to rebuild the firewall while NeverFail takes on Maldark. They soon remember to defeat Maldark, they need an ultimage weapon which Max reveals is all of their weapons combined though it comes at a cost: if they land a hit, the concussion of the blast will kill them. Fusing the Blast-o-Ton, Skullcracker and Thunder Pole into a large cannon, they fire a disco ball enduced twister, trapping Maldark long enough to send him back.  Afterwards, Max helps get Danté out of trouble by telling his mom he was helping out with a motion picture project, which works out .

La leyenda de la Llorona
 Beto and his little sister Kika are [[trick-or-treating]] in the village on a deserted, dark and foggy night. Kika very loudly begins asking for [[Candy|candies]], which causes Beto to become nervous. While waiting for Kika to come back from a house that is far down the street, Beto spots an eerie figure going in her direction. In order to save his sister, he calls out the ghost's name, "La Llorona"; she hears and precedes to chase after him. Kika finds Beto missing, looks for him, and finds him just in time to see him taken by La Llorona.  Some time later, a balloon with ship basket carrying five companions is flying over Xochimilco. The companions are Leo San Juan, a young boy, Don Andres, an old knight (similar to [[Don Quijote]]), Alebrije, a fire-breathing colorful [[dragon]]-like creature and Moribunda and Finado, two skeleton-like kids resembling [[calavera]] (sugar skulls). They're heading toward the village, [[Xochimilco]], in response to Padre Tello's letter which asked for their help. They summon a ghost friend Teodora, who helped them in previous adventure (''La Leyenda de La Nahuala''), but she disappeared right before the storm after teasing Leo. During the storm Moribunda fell out of the basket, and Leo saved her, but fell from the balloon into Kika's boat (she'd been sailing down a river at the time, possibly looking for Beto). Kika accidentally knocked Leo into the water, then discovered his letter from Padre Tello, and then accidentally hit him with her paddle, knocking him out (she pulls him out of the water offscreen). Kika sees the damaged balloon he'd fallen from heading toward La Isla de las Munecas (Puppets' Island).  San Juan wakes up at Kika's house under her mom's care. Kika's mother told him a story of La Llorona, whose name was actually Yoltzin instead of María. Yoltzin moved to Xochimilco with her two kids: Ollin and Tonatiuh. She sold flowers to provide for her family, and became well-liked in the village. Everything changed one day when they were coming back home to find their house on fire. Yoltzin jumped off the boat, desperate to save the house, but forgot her kids on the boat, which drifted away with them still on board. When she realized that it was too late and they disappeared without a trace. Villagers helped her searching for the kids. Days later, though, Ollin and Tonatiuh were found dead near a [[canal|channel]]. Yoltzin didn't accept her children's death. She was driven crazy with grief and remorse. After her death, the villagers started to hear ghostly moans. Yoltzin had become La Llorona, a specter who came out at night to kidnap children, though with no intent to harm them; rather, she seemed to want to take care of them, maybe to make up for failing to take care of her own children. Padre Tello followed La Llorona for years, trying to find out how to appease La Llorona, until he disappeared. San Juan left Kika's house to find his friends, and figure out the mystery of where Beto and the other kidnapped kids were with help of Padre Tello's journal. Kika followed him, telling Leo that he needs her. La Llorona attacks Leo and Kika, injuring Leo, but Kika helps him and listens to his plans to find the old church where Ollin and Tonatiuh's graves are. Padre Tello's book says that "Yoltzin has to see" the graves to be at peace. Once again, Leo and Kika were chased by La Llorona, but this time Kika is kidnapped and Leo loses her trail.  Meanwhile, at the island of the puppets, Andres was tangled in vines. After lot of screamming he was rescued from the puppets by Alebrije, who was all covered in green slime after falling in the lake. Andres and Alebrije freed an old man from a cursed hand puppet named Pecas, who was animated by the tears of La Llorona, and had been forcing the old man to make puppets for him. The old man thanked them and told them where to find La Llorona.  Leo San Juan asked Teodora to help him seek La Llorona and distract her while he looked for the old church where Yoltzin's kids were buried. Leo went into a sunken church, and inside he found Kika and other kids sleeping. He saw that La Llorona was taking care of them and that they were unharmed. He ran deep down in the church until he found the church's crypt and searched for Ollin and Tonatiuh's graves. He finds a broken part of the kids' graves when he's looking for his dropped necklace (with a picture of his mother inside) and puts it back into the grave, fixing it. Kika angers the La Llorona, telling her to let the other kids go, and she almost has her soul taken by La Llorona but Leo saves her. La Llorona grabs Leo and starts taking his soul, causing him to pass out, then captures his friends by animating vines that had overtaken the sunken church. When she is about to hurt them, Leo called out to her and showed her kid's name in the grave. When La Llorona saw their names, she became reunited with her kids and thanked Leo for his help. Leo saw his mom one last time while he was unconscious. Other kidnapped kids woke up including Beto. Back in the village Leo and his friends said farewell to the villagers, then get ready to go back to their hometown when Padre Godofredo appears and urges them to help another town in distress. He explains that Xochitl a friend of theirs, was taken captive by mummies in Guanajuato. They then sail off to Guanajuato in order to save her.

Returning to his apartment, Eddie takes the drug and discovers he now has perfect recall and the ability to cross-correlate information quickly. He cleans his apartment obsessively in a few hours and begins writing a new book.  The next day, the effects having worn off, he brings the pages he wrote to his publisher, who praises them. Eddie seeks out Vernon for more NZT-48, but while he is running errands for him, Vernon is murdered. Eddie locates Vernon's NZT-48 supply and begins ingesting the drug daily. With the help of the drug's effects, Eddie spends a few weeks cleaning up his life.  Testing his analytical skills on the stock market, Eddie quickly begins making large returns on small investments. He borrows $100,000 from a Russian loan shark, Gennady, and is hired at a brokerage firm, where he parlays this capital into over two million dollars in just a few weeks. He also resumes his relationship with Lindy. Eddie's success leads to a meeting with finance tycoon Carl Van Loon, who tests him by seeking advice on a merger with Hank Atwood's company. After the meeting, Eddie starts experiencing hallucinations and a sense of time skipping forward. When these effects cease, 18 hours have passed which he cannot remember.  Eddie goes through Vernon's ledger and learns that everyone taking NZT-48 is either in the hospital or dead. A man in a trench coat is revealed to have been following him. Eddie meets with Melissa, who informs him that she too had been on NZT-48, and that when she attempted to stop taking it she experienced a severe mental and physical [[rebound effect]]. Gennady later catches Eddie and demands the money be paid back with interest immediately. He then discovers and ingests Eddie's NZT-48, after which he begins using Eddie as his source for the drug.  Desperate for a pill after Gennady takes his last dose on hand, he asks Lindy to retrieve his stash from her apartment. While bringing the pills to Eddie, she notices the man in the trench coat following her. She calls Eddie for help and he encourages her to take one of the pills, which empowers her to escape. Lindy says she cannot be with him while he is on the drug because it makes him a different person.  Eddie experiments with NZT-48 and learns to control his dosage, sleep schedule, and food intake to prevent side effects. He hires a laboratory in an attempt to [[reverse engineer]] NZT-48, an attorney to keep the police from investigating Vernon's death, and two bodyguards to protect him from Gennady, who is threatening him to obtain more NZT-48.  On the day of the merger, Atwood's wife informs Van Loon that Atwood has fallen into a coma. Eddie recognizes Atwood's driver as the man in the trench coat and realizes Atwood is on NZT-48. While Eddie participates in a [[police lineup]], his attorney steals Eddie's whole supply of NZT-48 from his jacket. Soon afterward, Eddie enters [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], and hurries home after Van Loon questions him about Atwood's coma. Gennady breaks into Eddie's apartment, demanding more NZT-48, but Eddie kills him and his henchmen and escapes. Eddie meets with the man in the trench coat, surmising that Atwood had employed the man to locate more NZT-48. Once Atwood dies, they recover Eddie's stash from his attorney.  A year later, Eddie has retained his wealth, published a book, and is running for the [[United States Senate]]. Van Loon visits him and reveals that he has absorbed the company that produced NZT-48 and shut down Eddie's laboratory, offering Eddie a continued supply of the drug in exchange for becoming his personal lobbyist. However, Eddie tells Van Loon that he has already perfected the drug and weaned himself off it, retaining his abilities with none of the side effects. He leaves and meets Lindy at a Chinese restaurant for lunch, where he orders in fluent Mandarin, leaving it unclear as to whether or not Eddie actually weaned himself off NZT-48, or if he bluffed Van Loon and still needs it.

After graduation, Anna decides to spend the summer with Jacob rather than return to the United Kingdom, unaware of the consequences of overstaying her [[F visa|student visa]], which expired upon her graduation. After returning to London for a family engagement, Anna flies back to Los Angeles, where she is detained, denied entry, and deported to the United Kingdom by immigration officials.  The couple's love for each other grows strained by their separation and long-distance relationship. Despite her efforts at appealing the immigration decision, Anna is told she is banned from entering the United States. Meanwhile, Jacob leaves behind his successful design business and visits Anna in London for a few weeks. There, he learns that Anna's parents, Bernard ([[Oliver Muirhead]]) and Jackie ([[Alex Kingston]]), have hired an immigration lawyer to try to get the ban lifted. Bernard suggests that marrying may help their efforts. Jacob is uncomfortable with the suggestion, and the couple struggle with their feelings.  After Jacob returns to the United States, he and Anna grow apart, and Jacob begins a relationship with his colleague, Samantha ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]). Anna also tries to find a new life for herself, beginning work as a secretary for a magazine, but she is unable to abandon her feelings for Jacob. She eventually phones him from London and says that they will never find in others what they found in each other, and that they should marry. Soon after, Jacob breaks up with Samantha, returns to London and marries Anna in a small [[registry office]] ceremony with her parents as witnesses—both affirming that they will "never allow anything to destroy the feelings we share for each other". With a tearful parting, Jacob returns to his business in Los Angeles while the couple wait six months before they appeal the ban on Anna's visa.  Six months later, Jacob flies back to the United Kingdom for the appeal, but it is rejected. With their relationship compromised and no hope of resolving the visa issue, Anna and Jacob begin to fight with each other out of jealousy and frustration. Jacob goes back to the US, and continues his relationship with Samantha. Anna eventually gets promoted at work to the position of editor—something she wanted very much. Her love life, however, is not as positive or fulfilling—her new boyfriend Simon ([[Charlie Bewley]]) does not evoke the same feelings in her as Jacob, whom she still misses.  Sometime later, Anna is finally offered a new visa. She gives up her job, her current boyfriend and her apartment, and flies to Los Angeles to Jacob, who greets her with flowers at the airport where they have an awkward reunion. Jacob brings Anna to his house where he joins her in the shower, and as the water falls over them, they remember happier memories they had together at the beginning of their relationship, which has now become strained due to their indiscretions during the time spent apart.

A Little Bit of Heaven (2011 film)
 Marley Corbett is a quickwitted, carefree ad executive living in New Orleans, who embraces her easy going attitude, shuns any major responsibilities, and gains support and strength from a close circle of friends. She also enjoys casual dating and refuses to fall in love. One day, after an appointment, she is told by Dr. Julian Goldstein that she has terminal cancer. He is deeply impressed by the way Marley accepts the news with humour and dignity. While under anesthetic, God appears to Marley in heaven and asks her to make three wishes. She chooses to fly, to win a million dollars (not tax free), and a third that is later revealed.  Marley tells her friends the news, including her parents who separated years earlier and don't speak now. Her mother is persistent and overbearing, and instantly begins to smother Marley by visiting too often and making her meals to keep her strength up. Marley's father is the opposite; distant and reserved, and doesn't seem bothered with reconnecting with Marley with the time she has left. While driving through town one morning, Marley and her friend Sarah decide to take part in a radio call game where the 97th caller wins a prize. They get through and Marley is told she's won flying lessons - her first wish granted. Her other friend Renee is pregnant with her second child.  As the weeks go by, Marley's health starts to deteriorate and she visits Julian more and more. One night, they see each other at a band night at their local bar and decide to spend the rest of the night by going on a date. They start to develop feelings for one another.  Marley tells her boss about the cancer and he asks her about her life insurance plans, since their company has a policy that anybody who has a life-threatening illness can cash out, gaining a million dollars ($500,000 dollars after tax) instantly - her second wish.  After another date, Marley and Julian sleep together and begin a relationship. However, she soon starts to feel dismayed when she comes to the realisation that they won't have a future together, and flees quickly one morning before he wakes. That afternoon, they argue in the park and Marley breaks it off. She becomes distant from and jealous of her friends who are all going through positive changes. After visiting heaven in her dreams for a second time, God makes her realise that she needs to cherish what she has while she's still alive and, for the first time, Marley admits to being in love. Later that day, she visits Julian to rekindle their relationship, apologizes to the friends she has pushed away and even makes peace with her father.  At home over the following weeks, Marley is able to do nothing but lie in bed, and starts focusing on all of the things she is going to miss. She writes cards for special occasions she won't be around for in the future and writes letters to her loved ones, giving them all to her mother for her to give out at the right times.  One morning, Marley and Sarah sit in the park. Marley confesses to Sarah that she is no longer afraid to die, even though Sarah is terrified at the prospect of having to live without her. Marley drifts off and Sarah is unable to wake her. Knowing it's almost time, Marley is visited by everyone in the hospital who surround her bed and wait with her until the end. The exception is Renee, who is in labor with her son. Julian makes it in the nick of time to say goodbye and, in that final moment, Marley realizes her third wish was to fall in love. The film ends with Marley's funeral, a colorful celebration of her life with all of her friends and family.  
The Lion of Judah
 Follow the adventures of a bold lamb (Judah) and her stable friends as they try to avoid the sacrificial altar the week preceding the crucifixion of Christ. It is a heart-warming account of the Easter story as seen through the eyes of a lovable pig (Horace), a faint-hearted horse (Monty), a pedantic rat (Slink), a rambling rooster (Drake), a motherly cow (Esmay) and a downtrodden donkey (Jack). This magnificent period piece with its epic sets is a roller coaster ride of emotions. Enveloped in humor, this quest follows the animals from the stable in Bethlehem to the great temple in Jerusalem and onto the hillside of Calvary as these unlikely heroes try to save their friend. The journey weaves seamlessly through the biblical accounts of Palm Sunday, Jesus turning the tables in the temple, Peter's denial and with a tense, heart-rending climax, depicts the crucifixion and resurrection with gentleness and breathtaking beauty. For Judah, the lamb with the heart of a lion, it is a story of courage and faith. For Jack, the disappointed donkey, it becomes a pivotal voyage of hope. For Horace, the, well the dirty pig, and Drake the ignorant rooster, it is an opportunity to do something inappropriate and get into trouble.  
The Lincoln Lawyer (film)
 Criminal defense attorney [[Mickey Haller]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) operates around [[Los Angeles County]], mostly from the back seat of his black [[Lincoln Town Car]], chauffeured by Earl ([[Laurence Mason]]). Most of Haller's career has been defending garden-variety criminals, including a local [[Motorcycling|biker]] club led by Eddie Vogel ([[Trace Adkins]]).  A high-profile case comes his way and Haller is hired to represent wealthy Louis Roulet ([[Ryan Phillippe]]), a [[Beverly Hills]] playboy and son of real estate mogul Mary Windsor ([[Frances Fisher]]). Roulet is accused of brutally beating prostitute Regina Campo ([[Margarita Levieva]]). Roulet insists he is the innocent victim of a set-up. Haller and his investigator, Frank Levin ([[William H. Macy]]) analyze photos and evidence and find it similar to one of Haller's past cases that resulted in a life-sentence for his client, Jesus Martinez ([[Michael Peña]]), for murdering a woman, despite his repeatedly proclaiming his innocence.  Haller's ex-wife, prosecutor Maggie McPherson ([[Marisa Tomei]]), has never appreciated Haller representing guilty clients, though they remain close. Haller wonders if he should have done more for Martinez rather than persuading him to plead guilty to avoid the [[death penalty]]. Haller visits the prison, where Martinez becomes agitated when Haller shows him Roulet's photo. Haller now believes Roulet is the killer in the Martinez case, but, bound by [[Attorney–client privilege|attorney–client confidentiality]] rules, is unable to reveal what he knows.  Roulet breaks into Haller's house and nonchalantly admits to committing the murder for which Martinez was convicted. He makes veiled threats toward Haller's ex-wife and their daughter. Levin is found shot to death after leaving Haller a [[voicemail]] message claiming that he found Martinez's "ticket out of jail." Levin was shot with a .22 caliber pistol, and Haller discovers that his late father's .22 [[Colt Woodsman]] is missing from its box.  Detective Lankford ([[Bryan Cranston]]), who dislikes Haller, discovers the gun's registration and suspects Haller's involvement in Levin's murder. Haller is certain that Roulet stole the weapon when he broke into Haller's home.  Obliged to do his best for his client, guilty or not, Haller ruthlessly [[cross-examines]] Campo and discredits her in the jury's eyes. Haller then sets up a known prison informant with information on the previous murder. When the informant testifies, Haller discredits him, and the state's attorney ([[Josh Lucas]]) can only move to dismiss all charges. Roulet is set free, to his mother's delight, but the police arrest him immediately for the previous murder, based upon testimony Haller coaxed from the informant.  Haller acquires a pistol from his driver, Earl, for protection. Roulet is released due to lack of evidence and intends to kill Haller's ex-wife and daughter. Haller is waiting at Maggie's house when Roulet arrives. He mockingly tells Haller that he cannot guard his family all the time. The bikers whom Haller previously represented suddenly arrive and brutally beat Roulet.  Maggie discovers that Levin had found a parking ticket that was issued to Roulet near the previous murder victim's house. It is strong evidence against Roulet in his pending murder trial and will support Martinez's innocence. Upon arriving home, Haller discovers Roulet's mother, Mary Windsor, waiting inside. She shoots him with the Colt Woodsman, confessing that ''she'' murdered Levin to protect her son. A wounded Haller shoots her.  When Haller is released from the hospital, he learns that Martinez has been released, and that the District Attorney will seek the death penalty against Roulet. As Haller rides off to his next case, he is pulled over by Vogel and the biker gang, whose next case he takes [[pro bono]] due to their previous help.  
The Little Engine That Could (2011 film)
  In DreamLand, Little E. wakes the control tower and the other dream hauler engines up, so she can start work while also dreaming of being a dream hauler. She comes by the birthday train, which consists of a locomotive named "Red E. #35" and a wagon containing a female clown named "Beverly", a toy soldier named "Major", a toy plane who can fly named "Ace", a ballerina doll named "Jillian", two stuffed giraffes named "Lou and Bud" and a sock monkey named "Hudson". After finding the Caboose for it, Little E. attempts to follow it to the real world, but she is stopped by the Tower. Little E. then tries to pull several boxcars to Big L., but she ends up causing traffic for the other engines with the Tower reminding her that she is supposed to pull one boxcar at a time due to her small size. Little E. gets a little help from Rusty L., who is an old and wise engine.   In the real world, a boy named Richard shows his friend Marcus, his grandfather's watch. Two bullies named Scott and Stretch throw a snowball at Richard, which makes him slip and hand the watch over to them. He is worried that his dad would be unhappy that he lost the watch. Marcus tries to help him, but Richard does not want help from him at all. Richard decides to take a walk in the park, but trips over some train tracks he has never noticed before and find a train nearby. He boards one of its cars to take shelter from the cold, unaware that it is pulled by Rusty (who is sleeping on the job again) and suddenly wakes him up. He immediately returns to DreamLand (with the tracks appearing at the front and disappearing at the back of him) with Richard inside. While passing through the tunnel to DreamLand, the tunnel collapses, trapping Richard and the trains in DreamLand while the junction goes crazy. After Rusty informs the others what happened, Richard climbs out and is confused and scared by the talking trains. The Tower realizes that Richard's presence in DreamLand has damaged the dream-reality continuum and can only be fixed if Richard is returned to the real world. She sends some of the engines to dig out the tunnel and is forced to demote Rusty to a track-cleaner (in which he accepts the consequences), much to Little E's dismay. She then offers to take Richard home on the rumored tracks that lead over the mountain. The Tower, looking for a way to preoccupy Little E. and Richard while the other trains try to do the important work of clearing the tunnel, agrees, sending them both on their way while also promising to give Rusty his job back afterwards and even throw him a Ticker-Tape Parade. While searching for the track, they find themselves being chased by the Evening Express, who can't slow down to avoid hitting them. Richard, who suddenly believes that he is dreaming, tries to fly but ends up falling on the Evening Express. He manages to get back on Little E. but they are pushed off the track by the Evening Express. After rolling through the hills, they manage to get back on the tracks. They suddenly find the birthday train, which had derailed when the tunnel collapsed. Little E. decides to take the train to the real world herself and attempts to get information from the other engines about the old track, but they don't believe the track even exists. Little E., Richard, and the toys decide to find the track themselves.   Little E. manages to finds the track leading up the mountain.  Along the way, they come across an old bridge that partly collapses when trying to cross it. Richard nearby falls off but is saved by Little E. and Ace. They use an old cargo hook pole as a makeshift rail for the bridge to get across. Later, they enter a dark area in the mountain and while climbing up a hill, Little E. runs out of water due to a leak in her water tank, causing the train to roll backward until Richard manages to stop it by applying Little E.'s brakes. A black engine appears and offers to take them back to the real world for her. She agrees but he suddenly reveals himself as the Nightmare Train, an evil, nightmarish, locomotive who can create nightmares and plans to use Richard as a means to send nightmares to the real world and leaves after derailing Little E. and the birthday train. In the Nightmare Train, Richard is confronted by illusions of the bullies but the others encourage him to stand up to them. Ace escapes and goes to help Little E. After refilling her tank using water from a nearby water tower, she and the Caboose find themselves still unable to get back on the track. Little E. sees another stretch of tracks below and drops down the cliff, successfully landing back on the tracks. Meanwhile, Richard escapes and falls off the train after a failed attempt to uncouple the cars. Little E. finds him and they quickly chase down the Nightmare Train. While confronting him, the toys sneak out while Little E., Richard, and Ace trick him into speeding down a side-track at rapid speed. Major then uses his badge to plug the leak in Little E.'s tank (as well as admitting his feelings to Jillian) and they continue their way up the mountain. They eventually make it to the top and travel through a portal that leads them to the real world, where no time has passed at all.  Little E. returns to DreamLand, tells her story about her trip over the mountain, and is promoted to a dream hauler as a reward for her bravery while Rusty gets his job back. Once back, Richard has gained the confidence to confront the bullies and get his watch back and the bullies are caught by the principle, who is annoyed that they aren't in detention. During the credits, the following photos are shown: Richard showing his watch to his class, the toys with their new owners, the Nightmare Train defeated and derailed on a snow bank, Rusty's Ticker-Tape Parade, and lastly, Little E. taking more trains through the mountain.

The Lost Bladesman
 The film opens with a scene of [[Cao Cao]] attending [[Guan Yu]]'s funeral — Guan's severed head is buried with a wooden statue in place of his body. The scene flashbacks to 20 years before: After Guan Yu had been separated from his [[Blood brother|sworn brother]] [[Liu Bei]], he temporarily served Cao Cao while he waited for news of Liu's whereabouts. At the [[Battle of Boma|Battle of Baima]] between Cao Cao and his rival [[Yuan Shao]], Guan Yu slew Yuan's general [[Yan Liang]] and lifted the siege on Baima. As a reward, Cao Cao suggested to [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] to grant Guan Yu a marquis title and promote him to a higher rank.  Liu Bei's family, including his concubine Qilan, were staying in Cao Cao's base together with Guan Yu. Cao Cao showered Guan Yu with precious gifts, hoping that the general will be touched and will decide to remain by his side, but Guan refused to renounce his loyalty to Liu Bei. When Guan Yu received news that Liu Bei had taken shelter under Yuan Shao, he negotiated with Cao Cao to release Liu's family. Cao Cao agreed, but Qilan remained behind with Guan Yu. As Cao Cao was aware that Guan Yu was secretly in love with Qilan, he tricked Guan into consuming food spiked with [[aphrodisiac]], in the hope that Guan would express his feelings to Qilan and rape her when she was immobilised. However, Guan Yu managed to maintain his composure and refrain from dishonouring his sworn brother's concubine. He and Qilan made preparations to leave Cao Cao after he knew Liu Bei's whereabouts from a messenger sent by Liu himself.  Cao Cao's followers strongly opposed their lord's decision to allow Guan Yu to leave as they felt that Guan might become a threat to their lord in the future. Despite this, Cao Cao gave a strict order that no one was to stop Guan Yu. However, along the way, Guan Yu encountered resistance and had to fight his way through the passes. Guan Yu slew [[Kong Xiu]], [[Han Fu (fictional)|Han Fu]], Meng Tan, [[Bian Xi]], [[Wang Zhi (fictional)|Wang Zhi]] and [[Qin Qi]], consecutively after they attempted to stop him. It was eventually revealed that it was Emperor Xian, and not Cao Cao, who issued the order to kill Guan Yu. Before reuniting with Liu Bei, Guan Yu agreed to kill Yuan Shao but entered a dilemma on whether to stay or leave in favour of his relationship with Qilan. However, before Qilan left, she pretended that she loved Guan Yu and said that she would ask for Liu Bei's consent for them to marry. Her true intention, however, was actually to stop Guan Yu from helping Cao Cao. Guan Yu refused and was stabbed by Qilan before Emperor Xian sent assassins to kill him. After a final grim exchange of words, Guan Yu turned his back on Cao Cao and the emperor. He headed to reunite with Liu Bei, fighting against his lord's rivals for the next two decades until his death.  The scene then turns back to Guan Yu's funeral. Cao Cao is sad and sheds tears for the loss of his friend. Before the film ends, Cao Cao makes some final remarks on how not he, but others such as [[Sun Quan]], [[Liu Bei]] and [[Zhuge Liang]], are responsible for Guan Yu's death. In a post credits scene, Guan Yu is seen wielding his [[Green Dragon Crescent Blade]] upright and stroking his long beard.

The four rogues are sent on a mission to [[Pattaya]] to rob a house filled with priceless valuables. However, the quartet soon discover that the house they have been sent to rob belongs to a dreaded don named Lalla Bhatti ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), an unpleasant sod who doesn't think twice about breaking his own brother's arm ([[Shehzad Khan]]) for an unpaid debt. If robbing a don's residence was not enough, the quarter also manage to get in the way of a 'poetic' spouting Intelligence agent VP Singh ([[Ravi Kissen]]) keeping tabs on the don, an underworld patriarch Khan ([[Prem Chopra]]) and an East Asian thug named Asif trying to trace his stolen car.

In the climax, the quartet, with some help by a local hustler Varinder ([[Mika Singh]]) and his moll Sharmili ([[Kim Sharma]]) manage to set off the bad guys against each other. But soon enough, it is revealed that Batliwala was behind the whole thing, and wanted to set the quartet up to get revenge on his brother who is now in jail because of them. The quartet manage to save themselves and hire Khan to murder Batliwala.  
Love (2011 film)
 During an 1864 battle of the [[American Civil War]], a lone [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier, Captain Lee Briggs (Bradley Horne), is dispatched on a mission to investigate a mysterious object reported to Union forces. He leaves to venture on the mission.  175 years later, in the year 2039, United States Astronaut Lee Miller ([[Gunner Wright]]) is sent to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) as a one-man [[skeleton crew]] to examine if it is safe for use and to perform necessary modifications after it had been abandoned two decades earlier for reasons unknown. Shortly after arriving on board, tumultuous events break out on Earth, eventually resulting in Miller losing contact with [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator|CAPCOM]] and finding himself stranded in orbit alone, forced to helplessly watch events on Earth from portholes 200 miles above his home planet. Miller struggles to maintain his sanity while in isolation by interacting with [[Instant film|Polaroid]] pictures of former ISS crew members left aboard the ship.  When the station has some power glitches, Miller journeys into an [[International Space Station#Unpressurised elements|unpressurised module of the space station]] to perform repairs and discovers the 1864 journal of Briggs. Miller reads Briggs's account of the war and becomes enthralled by the mysterious object he is searching for, not realizing he will soon become more familiar with the very same object, and not by accident.  In 2045, six years after losing contact with CAPCOM and with a failing [[oxygen]] system inside the ISS, Miller puts on a [[space suit]] and goes for a [[Extravehicular activity|spacewalk]], deciding that it would be easier for him to detach his [[tether]] and slowly drift towards Earth and to burn in the atmosphere than slowly suffocate to death on board the ISS. He finds, however, that he is unable to go through with his suicide.  Miller is seen still aboard the ISS, presumably much later: his hair has grown extremely long, and he is extensively tattooed. He has drawn sketches of people and battles of the Civil War from the journal all over the interior of the ISS. The cramped quarters of the space station have become a rat's nest symbolic of his diminished sanity. He then seems to be contacted from outside the ISS, and to receive instructions to dock and transfer over. He does so, and seems to arrive in a giant uninhabited structure of distinctly human making. It is unclear whether this is reality or imagined by Miller, who is now insane.  Miller wanders around until he happens upon a server [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] where he finds a book titled "'A Love Story' As Told by 'You'". Inside this book, he finds pictures of Captain Lee Briggs with his discovery, a gigantic cube-like alien object that may have helped advance Human society. In the index of the book, Miller finds a reference to himself and types it into the computer prompt. He then finds himself inside a generic hotel room, where a disembodied voice says:    During the speech, we see the same cube-like object in space in the year 2045. The viewer is left to assume that this object has 'obtained' Lee Miller and is speaking directly to him. The film ends with the voice of a computer speaking of human connections and love.

She prepares to go out, has a coffee, and does a quick breath relaxation exercise.

Medina is with her friend Tesla (Romy Valentina), who tells her she is love with Medina's brother, Enzo (Francesco Plazza), and is thinking of getting engaged. Medina is a bit surprised, but congratulates her. They try to visit an art exhibit, but the female security guard kicks them out, as she remembers the duo's wild reputation. Medine is upset, but Tesla invites her and Enzo for drinks. Tesla and Enzo cheer Medina up with their light conversation.  [[File:loveeterne003.jpg|thumb|left|220px| Terilyn Marshelle-Fleming as Fera, and James Gill as Quinn]] Quinn (James Gill) looks depressed as he meets up with his friend Fera (Terilyn Marshelle-Fleming) at the street. He tells her that Nilda left him and took everything, including his possessions. He shows her the "[[Dear John letter]]" composed on bath tissue. Fera's husband, Camden (Jorell Stills Haigler), arrives and they explain the situation. Fera and Camden console Quinn but he leaves to clear his mind. They follow Quinn to make sure he does not do something regretful.  Tesla reminds Medina of an upcoming martial arts promotion test. Medina prepares by doing some stretching, practicing footwork, and twirling weapons including swords, staffs and spears. Meanwhile, Fera is increasingly concerned about Quinn. Camden notes that Fera and Quinn act like siblings, but for now, all they can do is continue to look after Quinn. They head to a show at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]].  For the promotion exam, Medina must knock Master down once before she is knocked down three times. In the first round, Medina goes down quickly after losing her balance from a kick to her thigh. In the second round, she falls from a palm strike to her chest. As she gasps for air, Tesla and Enzo show concern. Medina quickly plans a better offense, and wins the next round. Master promotes her and gives her some words of wisdom.  Some weeks later, Enzo and Tesla catch up to Medina and tell her they are now engaged. They are worried about Medina's isolation but Medina ensures them she is dealing with things. Enzo reminds Medina about the upcoming meeting at Françoise's restaurant. Camden and Fera look after Quinn, while Tesla and Enzo worry about Medina.  Medina visits Sidonia, who works as a psychic. Sidonia tells Medina she will meet someone and be happy, but she must allow herself to fall in love again. Medina meets her ex-boyfriend, Jarrod, who is engaged to Lumina. He shows Medina some pastries which he learned how to make back when they were a couple, and wishes her a happy thirtieth birthday by "toasting" her with [[cannoli]]s. Meanwhile, Quinn sniffs his Dear John letter one last time, and throws it in a garbage bin.  As she finishes a workout and prepares to leave, Medina senses a presence. She turns around and addresses the voice that sounds like Master, and is reminded of his advice at the exam. She encounters Sidonia, who is sitting on a chair, on the city sidewalk and meditating. Sidonia reminds her of the party later; Medina thanks her and walks off. Quinn and Fera see Sidonia and ask for directions. She provides it and gives Quinn a pack of tissues to clean his camera lens.  At Françoise's, Medina talks to the voice and they agree to part ways. Fera interrupts the conversation as she recognizes Medina as her favorite fashion designer. Camden calms Fera down, but Quinn is stunned upon seeing Medina, and Medina is likewise frozen. They break their trance; Medina is about to cry; Quinn offers her a tissue from the pack that Sidonia gave him. As Medina takes one, Quinn apologizes for disturbing her and walks away. Medina smells the tissue and is full of joy; she quickly turns and requests another from Quinn, who eagerly gives her the whole pack. Camden and Fera inform Quinn that their dinner reservations were denied because of a party. Medina realizes it's the same party that Enzo mentioned, so it must be for her. She invites Quinn, Camden and Fera to her party, and they excitedly accept. As they begin to walk away, Medina looks to the sky and smiles. With tissue in hand, she turns and joins Quinn and the others.  
Love for Life
 '''Opening narration:'''  ''"Once there was a village called 'Goddess Temple', high up in the mountains.''   ''Once there was a fever that the world called AIDS. It snuck into our village softly and everyone who got it died like falling leaves."''   '''Story'''  The peacefulness of a rural village has been disrupted by an outbreak of a disease, which the locals call 'a fever'. Villagers learn very quickly that there is no cure for the disease and refuse to have anything to do with the infected. Lao Zhuzhu is a teacher at the now-abandoned village school and the father of Zhao Qiquan, the blood merchant responsible for causing the outbreak. He decides to make amendments to the villagers on behalf of his unrepentant son by inviting all the infected villagers, including his younger son, Zhao Deyi, to live with him at the village school, where they will look after one another.   One day, Shang Qinqin, donning a red jacket, arrives at the school compound to join the small community. A few days later, her red jacket is stolen but no one is willing to admit to committing the theft. The villagers come to an agreement that the thief be given a chance by letting him to return the jacket later at night when everyone else has fallen asleep, but no one does so. Instead, a second theft occurs, and this time it is the Village Head who has his precious lifelong diary and some money stolen. This time, Deyi insists that everyone's belongings be searched. But instead of finding the Village Head's diary and money, the villagers find Qinqin's red jacket among the belongings of another infected villager, Old Bump. The Village Head's diary was never found. Soon after, Deyi goes to ask the Village Head to come out for his meal, but instead discovers that he has died on his bed, clutching the diary in his hands.   While living at the abandoned school compound, mutual empathy grows quickly between Qinqin and Deyi, for they were both rejected by their spouses after being infected by the fever. Empathy grows into love, as they soon develop an adulterous romantic relationship while still being married to their respective spouses. One day, Qinqin and Deyi are caught in the act by Qinqin's husband, Xiaohai, who was tipped off by two non-infected villagers and Xiaohai forces Qinqin to pack up and return home.   Eventually, Qinqin is chased out and asked by her mother-in-law to return only when her husband has found a new wife so that they can proceed with a divorce. Deyi takes her in and the both of them move to a tiny cottage on the hilltop, commencing a life full of constant negativity from fellow villagers. Deyi decides that he wants to marry Qinqin and the pair kneel down and beg a reluctant Lao Zhuzhu to help by requesting Qinqin's mother-in-law to grant a divorce. Xiaohai agrees, but on the condition that Deyi wills him the house that he once shared with Haoyan, his former wife.   Deyi and Qinqin move into Deyi's house while waiting for Qiquan to help them get back their marriage licences from the city government. On the day they are finally married, Qinqin, in a striking red two-piece ensemble, and Deyi, wearing a red tie carelessly-tied around his neck, strut down the streets of the village, giving out lucky candies to villagers who run from them upon sight. Their exuberant spirits are not to be dampened, and the pair continue with their walk around the village, announcing their marriage and showing off their marriage licences.   Despite not having the blessings and approval of the people around them, Qinqin and Deyi overcome great obstacles to pursue a life together as husband and wife.   One wintry day, Deyi succumbs to a severe fever. In a desperate attempt to ease Deyi's burning sensation, Qinqin immerses herself in a tub of icy cold water. Deyi finally falls asleep with a cold Qinqin in his arms. The next morning, Deyi wakes up and weakly reaches for Qinqin, who is shown lying on the floor by the side of the bed.

Ava is stunned, and leaves.  The next day, Gerber kicks Charlie out because Kasia’s family comes to visit. When Charlie hears Gerber talk to his wife in Polish, and asks him about it, Gerber says that if you love someone and want to live a successful married life, you have to accept and respect their family as well. Charlie goes to find Ava who is at her parent’s party. They meet after Ava has the realization that it’s her own fault for the way their marriage is and wanted to apologize. Charlie redoes his marriage vows and Ava responds, "I do." Charlie suggests going back to the party, but Ava suggests they [[consummate]] their marriage instead.

While placing her money in the register, Chris notices her ID laying on the counter and runs out calling her name, Leslie, and receiving no response.  Lucy (Ari Graynor), another young blonde woman, gets ready on another morning. She readies herself for the day, noticeably filled with glee, putting on a sundress despite the 20 degree weather. Hurrying to her desk, she notices her male coworker, Steve Mason, and makes a slightly flirtatious move towards him before her phone begins to ring wildly, distracting her from him. Steve scribbles a note and lays it out before her which says 'ROOF NOOON'. During this time Ben (Colin Hanks) approaches her and informs her of the jammed copy machine. Upset at having been distracted from Steve, she irritably assists her coworker before rushing up to the roof to meet Steve. There, he informs her that he wishes to break off their affair as she is 'not right for him.' Meanwhile, Ben is standing at the sandwich tray, searching for another tuna sandwich so that both he and Lucy can have one. When he sees one, he buys it and ventures to the roof to see if she would care to split it; however, having unknowingly stumbled upon such an intimate encounter, he hides until Steve leaves and Lucy notices him. After an awkward elevator ride together where they share the sandwich, Ben goes to his office where his mother calls him to come home quickly for an emergency and Lucy walks into an important meeting led by Steve and informs the clients and employees about their sexual affair. Having realized she had probably lost her job, Lucy grabs her things and heads to the car garage where Ben notices her and beseeches her for a ride to his house. In the car, he experiences a flashback of them as kids and remembers him telling an indifferent Lucy that he loved her and how he kissed her before she screamed and ran away.  After thanking her for the ride, Ben enters the house and is surprised by a multitude of cameras and journalists who follow his mother as she explains that he won a $36 million lottery. Later, Ben asks for some silence and descends to his basement bedroom in his mother's house, turning onto a news station which covers his story before stating that the disappearance of Leslie may be linked to three other blonde female disappearances. Ben leisurely walks to his closet before opening the door where Leslie's body falls to the floor and he states that she won the lottery. In the car, Lucy hears about Ben Keller's win in the lottery.  Ben's life quickly changes. At work, they celebrate for him and Lucy makes whatever attempts she can to pay him all the attention she denied him previously, apologizing for her rude behavior. At her house before an 'accidental' encounter with Ben, a detective questions her on her knowledge of Leslie, who lived nearby. She continues to casually 'bump' into him as she waits outside of his house while 'jogging' to see him. When the mother invites her to go to an interview with them, Lucy excitedly accepts. After Pauline Keller, Ben's mother, feels ill, however, she demands of Ben to abandon the interview and "fuck following rules." By stating that he can do anything now as a millionaire, Ben's attraction to her heightens and they leave just before filming began.  Two months later, they are dating. They are shopping when Lucy's dominant ways become prominent through her control over his rigorous exercise routine, her control over his spending, and by telling him to buy a certain gift for his mother's birthday. While in the shop, Ben becomes frustrated and drops a statue, apologizing frantically afterwards before Lucy, again, empowers him by breaking two other statues. There, Ben proposes and they marry, spending money gloriously on a new house, a honeymoon, and their wedding. On the honeymoon, they run out of the month's lottery check and Lucy and Ben fight just as Lucy began to realize the growth of her genuine feelings for him. She hides in the bathroom after Ben accuses her interest as spawned from his money. When a maid comes to the door, Ben perceives her as Lucy apologizing before the image flickers and it is Alice, the maid, again. Overcome with his insanity, he follows her into a hotel suite and brutally murders her, witnessed by Lucy who'd come to apologize. He stages the scene to make the murder appear as though she slipped on a banana peel and Lucy goes to call the police before contemplating the money that would be lost if she called.  Frightened, when they return from their honeymoon, Lucy slowly adjusts back to slight feelings towards Ben, but quickly discovers the bodies of the three women buried in Ben's old back yard. As the house was to be renovated and the land dug up to install a pool, Lucy removes the bodies and reburies them, gradually succumbing to hallucinations of them conversing with her. Her fear intensifies as Ben pays attention to another woman who resembles Lucy. Believing she is pregnant, Lucy rushes to Pauline's house to verify if she was where she discovers that she knew all along of Ben's brutal actions. She begs her to run away with her, but Pauline declines and Lucy leaves. As Lucy leaves, Pauline calls and informs Ben where he tricks her into getting arrested.  By paying off a jury, she is locked away in jail for her life. Ben comes to visit her soon after - just before their one year anniversary - where Lucy states how she has planned to "set him on fire" once she is released because she has realized his bloodlust for another blonde female will rise soon again. When he tells her that the need has, in fact, died, she explodes before coming to a state of sanity again and engaging in a light conversation similar to one they had before they had married, inquiring about his workout routine and then chastising him for skipping a day.

Galih continues to work, while Ranti continues to worry about him&nbsp;&ndash; despite her father becoming more and more severe. One day, when Ranti tries to return home after escaping again to take care of Galih, her father beats her into a [[coma]].   When she awakens three days later, she rushes to the schoolhouse and finds it completed, with a [[water wheel]] to provide electricity. With the villagers, led by her father, coming to burn it to the ground again, Ranti looks for Galih and finds him collapsed on a pier. He tells her to connect the electrical cord from the water wheel to the schoolhouse and, when she does so, the lightbulb flashes on and gives pause to the would-be attackers. Galih dies of his typhus in Ranti's arms as she cries. Ultimately she is able to use the schoolhouse to teach. Her love story with Galih, meanwhile, is passed from generation to generation.

That night as they lay on their beds at the relief station, they hear noises outside, and when they look out, Sam and the soldier see large numbers of Sudanese children swarming around to sleep outside the building.

Madea's Big Happy Family (film)
  Shirley ([[Loretta Devine]]), the main character of the film, goes to visit Dr. Evans ([[Philip Anthony-Rodriguez]]) with her longtime family friend, Aunt Bam ([[Cassi Davis]]) about her cancer and finds out that it has gotten worse, and that she may only have a few months to live. She asks Aunt Bam to call her children so she can tell them. Cora and Mr. Brown ([[David Mann (actor)|David]] and [[Tamela Mann]]) are also at the hospital, to get Mr. Brown a check-up. Dr. Evans tells them he has to do a colonoscopy on Mr. Brown, and they find a growth that needs to be removed surgically. Meanwhile, Madea ([[Tyler Perry]]) furiously and violently drives her car through a restaurant named 'Smax', because they stopped serving breakfast for the day when she wanted a biscuit sandwich, and because the manager had been very rude to her.  Shirley's children Byron ([[Bow Wow (rapper)|Shad "Bow Wow" Moss]]), Tammy ([[Natalie Desselle-Reid]]), and Kimberly ([[Shannon Kane]]) arrive at Shirley's house later that day for a dinner Shirley has planned for them in order to tell them the sad news about her recent prognosis from Dr. Evans. Byron arrives with his girlfriend Renee ([[Lauren London]]) and his baby Byron Jr. Tammy arrives with her husband Harold ([[Rodney Perry]]) and their two kids, with the former two subsequently carrying their argument over directions to the house with them. Kimberly arrives with her husband Calvin ([[Isaiah Mustafa]]). Tammy and Kimberly then start to argue when Byron's ex-girlfriend Sabrina ([[Teyana Taylor]]) and "baby mama" (Byron Jr.'s biological mother) arrives.   Sabrina quickly gets on Byron's nerves by addressing him as a "''[[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer"]]'' (since he was one when he was young and got arrested for it) and loudly extending out the last vowel and consonant sounds of his name, just to annoy him and his family. On top of that, she also lies excessively, uses her son's child support money and supplies for herself, and also tries to goad Byron back into selling drugs, so she can get more money for herself in the process. Moreover, she also turns out to be the manager of 'Smax', the restaurant that Madea crashed her car into earlier that day when Sabrina rudely lashed out at Madea about the restaurant not serving breakfast anymore for the day.   Everybody leaves the dinner later on that afternoon due to the constant arguing as well as their own reasons, and Shirley doesn't get the chance to tell them about her cancer. During the night, Byron and Renee sneak inside Shirley's house to sleep there, but Byron is arrested by the police for failing to pay [[Child support in the United States|child support]]. Shirley goes to Kimberly's house to ask her to bail him out, but Kimberly refuses. Calvin instead helps Shirley bail him out, much to Kimberly's anger and consternation.   The next day, Aunt Bam tells Madea about Shirley's cancer prognosis and the family’s situation, to which Madea promises to gather all Shirley’s children for another dinner that evening. She goes to Harold’s auto repair garage where Tammy works with him and authoritatively demands her to go to the family dinner. After she does so, Tammy then gets called by a client, and Madea takes the opportunity to discipline Tammy’s two unruly children for their disrespect, putting fear into them. She then goes to Byron’s workplace, but she finds him outside, since he was fired for being late as he spent the night in jail. It is revealed that the manager (played by [[Palmer Williams Jr.|Palmer Williams, Jr.]]) had fired Byron because him being late for the job that day was the last straw. Madea then brusquely demands that he is at the family dinner as well and threatens him if he does not come. She proceeds to Kimberly, whom she finds her showing clients a new house, as it is revealed that she is a [[Real estate broker|real estate agent]], and she peremptorily yells at her to attend the dinner after Kimberly attempts to ignore her. Meanwhile, Mr. Brown loses a lot of blood during his surgery and the doctor asks Cora to donate some. When she does, she finds out that she doesn't have the same blood type as him, implying that he may not be her real, biological father.  At dinner later on that night, Tammy and Kimberly have a vicious argument that leads to Tammy revealing that Kimberly is Byron’s birth mother, having had him when she was 13 years old. Byron storms out of the house, angry that this secret was kept from him. Later that night, for the first time, Harold puts his foot down towards Tammy and tells her to respect him more. Tammy and Harold then sort their problems out: Harold started acting weak because Tammy kept undermining his authority and pushing to be the dominant one in the relationship, and the resultant bickering and power struggle between them led their children to have no respect for their parents or anyone else. After dinner, Kimberly and Calvin continue to fight, which results in Calvin leaving and taking their son with him, much to Kimberly's dismay. The next day, when Byron and Renee go to the drug store, where they see Sabrina on "[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]" via the store's TV, humiliating Byron and demanding her child support. This finally pushes Byron over the edge, and he decides to go back to dealing drugs.    Overtime, Shirley’s condition worsens greatly and she goes to the hospital. She later tells Byron (who left his drug dealing corner after learning of Shirley's hospitalization), Tammy, Harold, and Calvin, who arrive to see her, that she loves them all, including Kimberly who isn’t present at the time, and after giving them some last words of advice, she dies. At Shirley's funeral service, which is held at a local church a few days later, the church choir, played by several of the cast members from [[Madea's Big Happy Family|Madea's Big Happy Family: the Play]], including one of the members of the choir who sings lead that is played by [[Chandra Currelley-Young]], sings the song "Heaven Waits For Me." After Shirley's funeral service, later on back at the house, Madea confronts the family, saying that Shirley was a peaceful woman and that she would not have wanted all the fighting going on between them.   First, Madea confronts Sabrina about abusing Byron’s hard-earned money, and that she needs to start respecting him, especially telling her to stop using their child to make his life miserable or she will be dealing with Madea herself or worse. Second, Madea confronts Byron and tells him to get himself a new job in order remain on the right path, because selling drugs again will only lead him to his own demise (a return to prison or an early grave) and Renee will just move on to the next man with a lot of money; Madea also threatens Renee when she attempts to backtalk. Madea also tells both Byron and Sabrina to start working together to take care of their baby, and settle things between them wisely and peacefully. Third, Madea tells everyone that Shirley didn't want her children to know that Kimberly had been [[Child molestation|raped by an uncle of hers, on her father's side, when she was 12]], which resulted in her pregnancy with Byron, and was why she became so hostile and aggressive towards everyone, because she hadn't forgiven the man that raped her. Madea urges Kimberly to forgive her uncle for her own sake; otherwise, he'll continue to have power over her, and she'll never be able to move on or make peace with herself and what he did to her. Kimberly then sorts out her issues with Calvin, feeling that she doesn't know how to begin, and finally hugs him and apologizes while they agree to acquire some professional help. Byron breaks up with Renee, because he just buried his mother while Renee keeps thinking only about herself, and trying to get him to deal drugs again.  The film ends with Madea, Mr. Brown, and Cora on ''[[The Maury Povich Show]]'' to find out if Mr. Brown is in fact Cora's father. Madea insists that he is, but it turns out he's not. This shocks Madea, who runs off-stage, sobbing hysterically. Madea does this mocking the running gag on the Maury Povich Show of how many of the woman, when it is revealed that their old romantic interests are not the real fathers of their child(ren), they run off-stage and sob wildly and hysterically. (Although the DNA tests on the show reveals that Mr. Brown is not Cora's real father, this, however, is non-canon to the rest of the Tyler Perry franchise as Mr. Brown is still portrayed as Cora's father).

Madrid, 1987
 In 1987, Miguel, an old and bitter journalist, agrees to meet with Ángela, an idealistic young journalism student, for an interview at a local restaurant.  Ángela has missed many of her lectures and needs to write an essay; she has chosen to use Miguel as her subject.  Throughout the interview, Miguel expresses his contempt for idealism and style.  When he reads a sample of Ángela's writing, Miguel dismisses much of it, though he says that she is talented.  He asks to keep the sample and invites Ángela to his friend Luis' house.  Miguel explains that Luis will be gone until Monday, and they will have the place to themselves.  She agrees, and they continue their discussions there over whiskey.  Miguel walks over Luis' paintings, and, when Ángela objects, he says that Luis would prefer them to be marred by life and experience.  Miguel alternates between cynical advice and derisively ridiculing romantic notions of journalism.  Soon, he enters the bedroom and point blank asks Ángela to strip naked.  When she balks, he tells her that he has been true to his nature and never hidden his motives.  When she turns to leave, Miguel stops her and says that he hopes she will one day respect him for his boldness.  As Miguel smokes a cigarette, he hears the boards creaking, and Ángela steps through the doorway wearing nothing but an open shirt.  Surprised, Miguel wordlessly spreads paint over her naked body.  Ángela rises to wash it off, and he follows her to the bathroom.  After they take turns in the shower, Ángela becomes frustrated when she can not open the door.  Miguel tries as well and concludes that it has locked from the outside.  The bathroom has only one towel, and both are naked; when he realizes her discomfort, Miguel surrenders the towel to Ángela.  The two continue their conversation from before, and Miguel alternates between attempts to seduce Ángela, giving cynical advice, and expressing his preference for whiskey and cigarettes over company with her.  As time passes, the two become worried that they will be missed: Miguel by his wife, and Ángela by her parents.  When Miguel learns that Ángela is the daughter of a prominent fascist soldier, he describes his run-ins with fascists and failed attempts to seduce Ángela's eldest sister.  Although initially opposed to bringing in outside intervention, Miguel agrees that the risk of scandal is now outweighed by their desire to leave the bathroom.  However, their cries out the window go apparently unheard.   As Miguel becomes despondent about the situation, his age, his attractiveness, and his foolish desire to seduce to a much younger woman, Ángela turns off the lights, drops her towel, and the two have sex.  Afterward, Miguel dismisses her feelings of guilt and proclaims himself to have a more developed and profound sense of guilt.  Ángela angrily accuses him of egotism, which she says she will write about in her essay.  They quickly reconcile when a chastened Miguel offers to entertain Ángela with a story.  The story, framed as an imaginary film that they are watching at the cinema, is about a boy who refuses to leave his bed under any circumstances.  The boy insists that nothing is wrong with him; he simply desires not to leave his bed.  When the boy mysteriously disappears, his parents are conflicted as to whether they should be glad he has left his bed or sad that he has run away.  Before Miguel can end the story, Luis returns to rescue them, summoned by a worker who heard their earlier calls for help.  Luis asks Miguel if he will see Ángela again, but Miguel is philosophical.  He tells Luis to keep a pair of glasses that Ángela left behind and reasons that if she returns, it will be to Luis' house.  The film ends as Ángela walks back to her parents' house.

The Malay Chronicles: Bloodlines
 The story begins with a mysterious man writing about the history of an old Malay kingdom so that people would not forget the history of the early Malay heroes. In 120 AD, the powerful [[Roman Empire]], under the reign of [[Hadrian]], had expanded its rule to the Central Asian countries. During their time of expanding, the great Roman Empire agreed to create an alliance with the [[Han Dynasty]] by marrying their two prince and princess, thus uniting the two powers both the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. However, the Roman prince, Marcus Carprenius ([[Gavin Stenhouse]]), did not agree with the decision. Instead, he wants to be free and not be controlled by politics. The Han princess, Meng Li Hua ([[Jing Lusi]]), also wants to be free instead being a pawn in a political game.  The Roman fleet sails off from the coast of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] to the [[Malay Peninsula|mysterious peninsula]] dividing the two great kingdoms. The Roman fleet is struck by a powerful storm, which causes the Romans to lose much of their fleet. They go instead  to the coast of [[Goa]]. They are greeted by a local Goan dealer, (Mano Maniam), and later introduced to [[Merong Mahawangsa]] ([[Stephen Rahman-Hughes]]), said to be the descendant of [[Alexander the great|Alexander the Great]] himself. Merong is preparing to duel against Sunder (Ravi Sunderlingam), a Goan nobleman who challenged him after finding out about Merong's illicit relationship with the nobleman's sister, [[Yasodharā]] ([[Deborah Henry]]). Merong defeats Sunder and Marcus is impressed by Merong's fighting skill. Subsequently, Merong agrees to escort Marcus to the peninsula while Lycius (Eric Karl Henrik Norman), the Roman fleet admiral returns to Rome and promises to return to Goa with a brand new fleet, carrying the payment in gold for the passage of the prince to the "[[Golden Chersonese]]". Merong is also promised a ship large enough for him to explore the known world.  Merong escorts Marcus to the peninsula and is greeted by the Chinese Admiral Liu Yun ([[Craig Robert Fong]]). Merong tells Marcus and Liu Yun that this peninsula was where he grew up and it is owned by several tribes. The night before the marriage, Meng Li Hua and her handmaiden, Ying Ying (Nell Ng) agrees to run away and begin a new life in the peninsula. However, Marcus follows Meng, resulting in their first meeting. The royal couple then grows closer to each other as they discover how they both have a common wish of being free from palace life. In the morning, The Chinese and the Romans are attacked by the pirate nation, Garuda. The Garuda leader, Taji ([[Wan Hanafi Su]]) uses black magic and sorcery before attacking to weaken their enemies. Meng and Ying Ying is kidnapped by Kamawas (Khir Rahman). Marcus tries to stop Kamawas but is stabbed and falls into the sea. Heavily outnumbered, the Chinese and the Romans are defeated. Merong, enraged by Marcus' apparent death, kills most of the Garuda fighters but is heavily injured and passes out.  Merong wakes up as he is getting treated by a tribe leader named Kesum ([[Rahim Razali]]). Kesum and Embok (Ummi Nazeera), one of the village's nurses treat Merong until he is well enough to fight again. Merong learns that Kesum and Taji were students to a once great magician and a brave warrior. Taji, wanting the great magician's amulet of immortality, kills the great magician during his sleep and led a small band of fighters to terrorise the villages. It was revealed that Merong's mother Lang (Umie Aida) was implied to be killed in the onslaught, which has since haunted Merong's dreams; while Embok was once raped by Kamawas during one of these raids. Consequently, Merong swore revenge to Kamawas. Kesum tells Merong of a prophecy that a great warrior will come and unite all the tribe into one kingdom and defeat the enemy. Kesum believes that Merong is the one. After hearing the prophecy, Merong becomes Kesum's student and begins uniting the tribes.  In the island of Garuda, Meng and Ying Ying are held captives for ransoms by Taji and Kamawas. Meng and Ying Ying manages to steal Kamawas a piece of the amulet of immortality. After Merong manages to unite all the tribes, they became one kingdom known as [[Langkasuka]] and began a new civilisation. Merong is then suddenly met by Liu Yen, Marcus (who was saved by Liu Yun and gets treated) and a small group of Chinese soldiers. Liu Yun tells Merong that they have to save the princess before she is killed. Merong is then given a ship full of mirrors by Liu Yun. As Merong prepares his fighters to invade the island of Garuda, Embok confessed her love to Merong.  Merong launches an attack toward Garuda in the morning. The Garuda prepared their ships and outnumbered Merong's fighters at least five to one. Merong revealed that he used the ship full of mirrors to create a similar weapon to the [[Archimedes#The Archimedes Heat Ray|Archimedes Heat Ray]] and uses it to set all the Geruda ships and boats on fire (along with some of the men). Taji then uses sorcery to make storms and cover the sun with black clouds, rendering the weapon useless. After a heroic speech, Merong and his fighters launch an attack and land on the beaches. After a brief fight, Merong's fighters manage to take control the beach but another wave of Garuda fighters led by Taji came in to destroy the fighters. Merong's fighters fight to their death while Marcus confronts Kamawas, but Kamawas defeats Marcus easily. Before Kamawas could finish Marcus off, Liu Yen came in to stop Kamawas but is killed in the process. Most of Merong's fighters were killed. However, shortly after, A large fleet of the Romans and the Chinese, led by Admiral Lycius arrives on the scene and attacks Garuda, changing the tide of the battle. Merong arrives to save Marcus and confronts Kamawas. After a brief duel, Kamawas is finally defeated. Merong tries to kill Taji but is stabbed. Merong makes a sacrifice by taking the amulet off and pushing the sword forward, thus killing them both. Right after Merong dies, the Romans and the Chinese attack and finish off the last of the Garuda, ending the battle.  Many years after the great battle, it is revealed that the mysterious narrator is [[Sultan Mudzafar Shah I|Sultan Mudzafar Shah]], the first [[Sultan of Kedah]] writing about the history of Merong Mahawangsa in the [[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa|Kedah Annals]]. The Sultan tells that [[Langkasuka]] was known as a great and proud Kingdom. The film ends with a flashback to Merong being pronounced a hero and the first king of Langkasuka.<ref></ref>

It is then revealed by Prithvi that Kamal [[Faked death|faked his death]] in a secret mission to draw attention to the betting scandals and returns under the name Praveen Kumar. Arumuga Chettiar ([[Jayaprakash]]), an influential local illegal business dealer and the head of Faizal, owns "Golden Theatres" in Mumbai, which has been converted into a gambling den and forms the front for all his illegal businesses. Arumuga Chettiyar uses his links with dons in Mumbai and tries to route through his old theatre, a cash of over  to be used in betting. Vinayak is introduced to Arumuga Chettiyar through his girlfriend Sanjana ([[Trisha (actress)|Trisha]]). Sanjana is in love with Vinayak, but he just pretends to love her.

Vinayak befriends the boys at Sumanth's marriage with Suchithra ([[Anjali (actress born 1986)|Anjali]]). One late evening, Vinayak meets Prem, who becomes inebriated by him and reveals their heist plan. Vinayak starts spying on them and confronts them on the day of the planned heist, stepping in. The four reluctantly take him in, promising him a fifth of the share. Vinayak, however, has other plans. He wants to kill his four accomplices and take the entire amount. He promises to help them and divide it between them. After looting the money, they leave the money in an abandoned godown. Later, all of them celebrate the turn of events at Mahat's bar. But Sumanth is identified at the party by Faizal and is later caught by him. Sumanth is cornered by Chettiar, who orders Faizal to kill him for his treachery, but is rescued in time by Ganesh and Vinayak, and the trio escape from the hideout taking Chettiar as hostage. While driving back to the godown, Vinayak finds Sanjana on the way, and in front of her, he brutally shoves Chettiar out of the vehicle. Sanjana engulfs in grief when she comes to know about Vinayak's true intentions.  Meanwhile, upon reaching the godown, they discover that Mahat and Prem had escaped with the cash and are accompanied by Sona ([[Lakshmi Rai]]). The three are then confronted by Faizal and Chettiar's men, but manage to evade them and get on the run. Sumanth later turns against Vinayak when he comes to know that his wife had been kidnapped by Chettiar. After a brief scuffle, Sumanth runs into Prithvi who takes him to custody and rescues his wife on the condition that he turns [[Turn state's evidence|approver]] and divulge everything. He is however killed when Prithvi's wife Sabitha Prithviraj ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]) is kidnapped and threatened by Vinayak.

A sequence of events lead to the murders of the gang members one by one — Mahat is killed by Sona who betrays him, Prem is killed by Prithvi who he mistakenly assumes was about to kill him, and Sona is killed by Vinayak — with Ganesh and Vinayak remaining alive. A final fight ensues between Vinayak and Prithvi. The two actually prove to be equal. At the final moment of the fight, Kamal throws a gun to Prithvi who shoots Vinayak, and a huge explosion rocks the shack seemingly ending the fight.  After several days, the police gets information about Ganesh to be living in Thailand. Kamal (under the name of Praveen Kumar) arrives there, but instead comes across Vinayak.

Margin Call (film)
 An investment bank known only as NBS begins a mass layoff on the trading floor during a normal business day. Among those let go is Eric Dale (Tucci), head of risk management for the trading floor. Dale tries to speak about his current, unfinished project, first with human resources staff and then with desk head Will Emerson (Bettany), but is told that his work is no longer his concern. While being escorted out of the building, he meets one of his risk analysts, Peter Sullivan ([[Zachary Quinto]]), and gives him a [[USB flash drive]] to look at with a vague instruction to "be careful."  Sullivan works late that night to finish Dale's project, and discovers that current [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] in the firm's portfolio of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] has exceeded the [[Value at risk|historical volatility levels]] of the positions. Because of excessive [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], if the value of the portfolio assets decrease by 25%, the loss will be greater than the market value of the firm itself and the firm will go bankrupt. Sullivan and his colleague, junior analyst Seth Bregman (Badgley), tell Emerson about the situation. Emerson alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Spacey), who also returns to the office. They attempt to contact Dale, but the company shut off his phone and he had not yet returned home.  Through the night, they have meetings with division head Jared Cohen (Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Moore), and finally CEO John Tuld (Irons). Cohen's plan is for the firm to quickly dump all of the [[toxic assets]] in a [[fire sale]] before the market learns of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firm's exposure, a plan favored by Tuld. Rogers protests that dumping the firm's toxic assets will spread the risk throughout the financial sector and destroy the firm's relationships with its [[counterparties]]. He also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firm's plans once they realize that the firm is only selling the toxic securities, but is not buying any new ones. Rogers is upset, but it is because his beloved dog is dying.  Will and Seth finally locate Dale back at his home in [[Brooklyn Heights]], and Will tries to convince him to return to the office, informing him that the firm will not pay him his severance and other benefits unless he agrees to participate in their plan. On the way back, Will tells Seth he will probably lose his job in the crisis, but will get a large severance, while explaining to him the corrupt, cyclical nature of the markets. Meanwhile, Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld are revealed to be  aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld offers Robertson up as the scapegoat, putting the blame of the crisis on her and forcing her resignation. Both Dale and Robertson are instructed to remain in the office all day and do nothing in return for a substantial increase to their severance packages. Robertson expresses regret for not doing more to stop the crisis.  Before morning, Tuld is able to convince Rogers to go along with Cohen's plan. In a speech to his traders in preparation for the fire sale, Rogers warns them that by participating, they are effectively ruining their reputations and ending their careers in the industry. However, he also informs them that they will receive million-dollar bonuses as compensation if the sale is a success. The firm successfully pulls off the sale despite growing suspicion from their buyers, but takes tremendous losses while dumping positions for cents on the dollar. After trading hours end, Cohen tells Rogers there will be another round of layoffs, but Rogers will keep his job. Angry that he was retained, Rogers confronts Tuld, but Tuld dismisses his protests, claiming that the current crisis is no different from various [[financial crisis|financial crises]] and [[bear market]]s of the past, and that sharp gains and losses are simply part of the [[economic cycle]]. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that a lot of money will be made from the coming crisis. Tuld also informs Rogers he will promote Sullivan. Rogers says he will accept the deal, but only because he needs the money.  In a final scene, Rogers buries his dog in his ex-wife's front yard in the middle of the night, and learns from her that their son's financial firm took a big hit, but survived the day's trading.

March of the Dinosaurs
 The film begins on a summer's day in Northern Canada 70 million years ago and herd of ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' and a spiky ''[[Edmontonia]]'' are feeding on the lush vegetation that grows all around them. Scar, a young male ''Edmontosaurus'', enjoys his life in the Arctic forests with his extended family, comes across a young immature male ''[[Troodon]]'' named Patch, who has been feasting on baby ''Edmontosaurus'' all summer, but now has to chase smaller, more difficult prey as the baby Edmontosaurus are too large to hunt. He chases after an ''[[Alphadon]]'', but another clawed foot grabs the fleeing mammal; that of another Troodon, and Patch is becoming impatient. The plentiful food for Scar is ending as well, as the dark, cold Arctic winter is approaching. When night falls for the first time, Scar loses sign of the herd and spots a dark shape, which turns out to be a ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'', which slices his face as he narrowly dodges the killer blow. Later, a herd of ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' arrives and starts to compete for the dwindling food supply, further pressuring the herd's search for food. Scar finds the ''Edmontonia'' feasting on insect larvae from a fallen tree branch and tries his luck with mixed success. The sun sets and the Pachyrhinosaur herd moves on somewhere else in search of food. The winter's approach causes the herbivores to start risking their safety and a young female ''Edmontosaurus'' gets killed by the ''Gorgosaurus'' as she wanders too far from the herd. The next day, the ''Edmontosaurus'' and ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' herds move south for the winter, while ''Edmontonia'' stays behind. She's way too heavy and her armoured body has been storing fat to last her through the lean months. Meanwhile, Patch and the ''Troodons'' are feasting on the dead female ''Edmontosaurus'' when the ''Gorgosaurus'' appears. The tyrannosaur scares the ''Troodons'' away, but is wounded in the fight, and Patch is frustrated and must work harder to find prey. Far away, the dinosaur herd is moving on, until Scar sees a dark shadows, which turns out to be a flock of scavenging ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'', the biggest pterosaurs ever, which feed on the dying herd members that could not keep pace. The blizzard arrives and Scar collapses, but an older male arrives and helps him to keep moving through the blizzard. They continue on walking and don't realize they are heading into a trap; the ground breaks apart, meaning that they walked onto a frozen sea inlet. As the herd struggles to escape the icy water, several get dragged under by mosasaurs known as ''[[Prognathodon]]''. Scar has never swum before, but he is pushed in and starts to swim for the shore. In the Arctic, Patch picks up a bone and heads back to his nest, which he has been building in the hopes of attracting a mate. Nearby, The ''Gorgosaurus'' finds the ''Edmontonia'' outside its lair, but the bite to its leg is badly infected and it goes back into the cave to wait for easier prey to wander close. A thousand miles away, the ''Edmontosaurus'' herd moves on through a volcanic ash field. Lying in wait, a pack of ''Albertosaurus'' sleeps until the herd is close enough to ambush. The feathered carnivores wake up and start to stalk the herd. Scar runs for his life while one of the predators is hot on his heels. During the attack, an avalanche of water, rock and mud caused by the eruption that follows the attack slides down the bank. Scar climbs up the cliff, but loses his courage, and the ''Albertosaurus'', injured in the eruption, begins to close in. Just as Scar sees the avalanche, he rushes up the cliff while the ''Albertosaurus'' is swept to its seeming death. Back in the Arctic, Patch tries to impress the female by dancing only to lose out to a more experienced male and the ''Edmontonia'' has found a last leaf. Suddenly, the log it stands on breaks apart and the ''Edmontonia'' slides down the snow on her back and crashes into a snowdrift, utterly helpless. Far away from the ''Troodons'', Scar tries to call for his family, but the only calls are the ones that didn't make it; the old male ''Edmontosaurus'' he has been traveling with and an injured female ''Pachyrhinosaurus''. The ''Albertosaurus'', having survived the mudslide, rises back to its feet and starting following Scar's trail again. Scar and the old ''Edmontosaurus'' walks on, but the older animal, suffering from a brain tumor, becomes more aggressive and nervous towards Scar, eventually even biting him. Scar sees the ''[[Albertosaurus]]'' first, and flees. The old bull Edmontosaur fights the predator until they both tumble over the cliff, locked in a deadly embrace. In the frozen north, Patch learns how to finally catch ''Alphadon'' by listening for them under the snow and comes across the overturned ''Edmontonia''. He and several other ''Troodons'' attack the ankylosaur, but the ''Gorgosaurus'', now fully healed of its injury, arrives and pulls the herbivore away from the smaller predators. Struggling, the ''Edmontonia'' gets back up and injures the ''Gorgosaurus'' with her shoulder spikes. The ''Gorgosaurus'' heads back to the cave, fatally wounded with a broken leg. As the sun rises the next morning, Scar is becoming weaker and the ''Quetzalcoatlus'' that follows senses it. The young dinosaur hears a rustling noise, which turns to be the injured female ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' instead. The pterosaur gives up and the ceratopsian herd arrives to cross the river. As they cross the river, groups of ''[[Prognathodon]]'' arrive and pull many of them underwater. Scar dives in while the mosasaurs  continue their attack on the ''Pachyrhinosauruses''. Scar eventually reaches the far bank and reunites with the ''Edmontosaurus'' herd, finally reaching safety. The sun eventually rises again and warmth begins to spread across the Arctic Circle. The ''Edmontonia'' is feasting on the budding greens and Patch manages to find a mate, offering scavenged meat from the dead ''Gorgosaurus''. Soon, the ''Edmontosaurus'' will travel north again once summer begins to arrive to the north.

Meanwhile, Milo, who doesn't like following the house rules and doing chores, tells his mother in anger that his life would be better without her, breaking her heart.  Later that night, Milo goes to apologize, but discovers his mom is being abducted. He runs after her, but they end up in separate parts of the Martian spaceship.  On Mars, Milo is taken to an underground cell. He escapes and is chased by Martian guards, but he follows a voice that tells him to jump down a chute, and lands in a lower subterranean level. There, he sees a trash-covered landscape that is inhabited by furry creatures.  Milo is whisked away by the creatures to meet Gribble, a.k.a. George Ribble, the childlike adult human who had told him to jump down the chute.  Gribble explains to Milo that the Martians plan to extract Milo's Mom's memories at sunrise, using a process that will kill her. Gribble, who is lonely and doesn't want Milo to leave, pretends to help Milo rescue his mother, but his plan goes awry leading to Gribble being captured and Milo being pursued by Martian guards.  Milo is rescued by Ki, one of the supervisions who raises Martian babies. Milo tells her about his search for his Mom and what a human relationship with a mom is like, as Ki and her kin were mentored by only nannybots and supervisors and don't know of love.  Milo returns to Gribble's home but finds him missing. Gribble's robotic spider, Two-Cat, takes Milo to the Martian compound where Gribble is being prepared for execution. Milo is captured by the guards, but Ki tosses him a laser gun, allowing him to escape.  Milo and Gribble retreat to an even lower uninhabited level, where, Gribble explains his Mom's abduction and murder by the Martians 20 years ago. Gribble blames himself for her being chosen, and regrets that he hadn't been able to save her. Milo convinces Gribble to actually help him just as Ki finds them. They discover an ancient mural of a Martian family and realize that Martian children weren't always raised by machines. Gribble explains that Martian female babies are currently raised by nannybots in the technologically advanced society, while the male babies are sent down below to be raised by adult male Martians, which are the furry creatures he encountered earlier.  Milo, Gribble, and Ki save Milo's Mom just before sunrise, causing the energy of the extraction device to short out the electronic locks to the control room. This lets the adult males and babies enter, where they run amok, attacking the guards and robots.  Milo and his Mom steal oxygen helmets and try to escape across the Martian surface, but the Supervisor causes Milo to trip and his helmet shatters.  His Mom gives him her own helmet, saving Milo but sacrificing herself. The Martians are awed, as this is the first time they have seen love.  Gribble finds his own mother's helmet, and gives it Milo's Mom, saving her. Ki brings a ship for them to escape in, but the Supervisor intervenes. Ki argues that Martians were meant to be raised in families, with love, but the Supervisor insists that the current situation is better, because it is more efficient. The guards decide to arrest the Supervisor because they prefer the loving vision of family-life.  The other Martians celebrate.  Milo, his Mom, Gribble, Ki, and Two-Cat travel to Earth. Gribble decides not to stay, because he wants to pursue a relationship with Ki on Mars. Milo and his Mom return to their house just before Milo's dad comes home.

While taking care of Marley, Bodi Grogan has to stay with his grandfather, Fred Grogan because his mother, Carol is on a business trip. So Bodi stays with Marley in his grandpa's house. His grandpa is pretty strict about chores and pushes him around a lot.  One day, while on a walk with Marley (Bodi on his skateboard), Bodi meets a girl named Kaycee. They chat for a while, then Kaycee tells him about a puppy championship. Kaycee, whose parents own a pug rescue center, enters three of her pugs in the contest so she can get money for the center. She tells Bodi to enter Marley in the contest. But, according to rules, a team must have three dogs, so Kaycee tells Bodi about Mrs. Crouch, who has two other lab puppies. Together, all three of them train for a course. Meanwhile, elsewhere, Hans Von Weiselbeger is being cruel to his three puppies. He puts voltage collars on them. If they are not the way he wants them, they get shocked. His three puppies were last year's puppy champions, and so Hans wanted to make them even better.  The day before the competition, Bodi sends his pups to a day in the spa, but after the pups finish, a man wearing a spa worker's uniform takes them, along with an Australian dog who was also part of the competition. The evil man is Henkles, Hans's helper. He locks the four of them away with two big German Shepherds who were pretending they were going to eat the pups. The pups get scared, but the shepherds say that they were only messing with them. They help the pups escape by using a sort of seesaw which the pups made: one pup would be on one side while one of the shepherds would jump onto the other so that the pups would fly away. All four escape and return to Bodi's home, though they are very dirty. He cleans all four of them and grandpa calls the Australian dog's owner, so that dog goes home.  The next day the championship starts. Everyone does well, but in the middle Marley gets distracted. When the prizes are announced, Bodi is upset because he didn't win. Initially, Hans was in the first place, but Marley saves the day. Cat snips all of Hans's dogs' collars, then Marley takes one collar and puts it in Hans' pocket. When the pups don't obey, Hans turns the collars on, getting an electric shock himself. His remote, which controlled the collars, falls out of his pocket and the judge sees it. He is hence disqualified. The new results are first place for the Australian dog and second place for Kaycee's pugs. Because Marley saved the day, Bodi gets a prize for good sportsmanship. Bodi, in the middle of the competition, saw his mom and was surprised. His mom, who thought Bodi was irresponsible, sees that he is happy with Marley. He couldn't keep Marley, because it was his relative's dog. However, the three dogs who belonged to Hans are not his anymore: one family adopts two, but the last one was going to be taken to the dog shelter to find a home. Bodi's mom said he could keep him, because she believed Bodi was ready to take a dog. Thus, that dog finds a new home and was happy too.

The Mechanic (2011 film)
 Arthur Bishop, working as a "mechanic" (mafia slang for [[hitman]]), sneaks into the lavish home of a Colombian drug cartel leader and drowns him in his own pool. Upon returning home to Louisiana, he meets with friend and mentor Harry McKenna, who pays Bishop for his work.  Bishop is given a new assignment:  kill Harry.  Bishop's employer confirms by phone that the contract is correct, whereupon he requests a face-to-face meeting.  Dean tells him about a failed mission in [[South Africa]], in which agency assassins were killed.   Dean says that only himself and Harry knew the details of the mission, and that Harry had been paid for the contract details.  Reluctantly, Bishop kills Harry with the latter's own gun and makes it look like a [[carjacking]]. At his funeral, Bishop meets Harry's reckless son Steve.  Bishop stops Steve from trying to kill a would-be carjacker in a misguided attempt at cathartic vengeance. Steve convinces Bishop to train him as a mechanic.  Adopting a [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]], he instructs Steve to take the dog with him to a coffee shop each day at the same time.  As Steve settles into a routine, Bishop escalates training, taking him to observe a contract killing.  The target is a mechanic for another agency named Burke, who frequents the same coffee shop.  Burke's only weaknesses are that he is interested in young men and small dogs.  Burke makes his move on Steve and invites him out for drinks.  Bishop instructs Steve to slip a large dose of [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] into Burke's drink to cause an [[Drug overdose|overdose]].  Steve ignores the instructions and goes with Burke to his apartment.  When Burke begins to undress, Steve attempts to [[strangle]] him with a belt as he had seen Bishop do on a former assignment.  Burke fights back, using his size advantage and experience, but Steve manages to kill Burke after much effort and a lengthy fight.  Dean expresses his disapproval of Bishop involving Steve, and that violated the rules of the contract arrangement, but Bishop says that Harry and his arrangement was for price only, and Harry left the details up to Bishop.  Bishop's next contract is to kill cult leader Andrew Vaughn.  They plan to inject their victim with [[adrenaline]] to simulate a [[heart attack]], for which the paramedics would administer a fatal dose of [[epinephrine]].  While Bishop and Steve are preparing for the hit, Vaughn's doctor arrives, and he sets Vaughn up with an [[Intravenous therapy|IV]] of [[ketamine]], which will inhibit the adrenaline's effects.  The hit men decide to suffocate him instead, but are discovered after killing Vaughn and are forced into a shootout with the guards; they slip away and fly home separately.  At the airport, Bishop sees a supposed victim of the mission that Harry allegedly sold out. He confronts the other mechanic, who tells Bishop that he was paid by Dean to kill the other mechanics in South Africa and fake his death so that Dean could engineer the failed mission to cover up his own shady dealings; he also reveals that Dean framed Harry and that he tricked Bishop into killing his friend.   The mechanic then attempts to kill Bishop and after a struggle between the two professionals, Bishop ends up killing him. Bishop is later ambushed by a hit squad: after killing them, he discovers that Dean was behind the hit. Bishop goes home to call Steve, only to find that Steve has been ambushed.  Bishop directs Steve to a hidden gun, which Steve uses to kill his attackers.  Steve gathers supplies for their new mission while Bishop plots how to get to Dean.  In the process, Steve finds his father's gun and realizes that Bishop killed Harry.  Bishop and Steve kill Dean in an ambush: on the way back, Bishop notices Steve carrying Harry's gun. When they stop for gas, Steve floods the ground with fuel while pretending to fill the tank.  He walks a safe distance and shoots the gas, blowing up the truck with Bishop still inside.   Steve returns to the house and performs two actions that Bishop told him not to do: playing a record on the [[phonograph|turntable]], and taking the 1966 [[Jaguar E-Type]]. As he is driving away, Steve finds a note on the passenger seat: "Steve, if you're reading this, then you're dead!", which he laughs off as a joke before the car explodes, killing him. Bishop's house is destroyed by a chain reaction of explosions.  Back at the gas station, a security video reveals that Bishop had escaped from the truck, seconds before the explosion. Bishop gets into a [[Chevrolet Avalanche|spare truck]] and drives away.  
Mega Python vs. Gatoroid
 A group of animal activists, consisting of Dr. Nikki Riley, Gia and Ben, break into a house and steal dozens of exotic [[Python (genus)|pythons]] before setting them free into the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]]. Their actions inadvertently cause the snakes to grow into alarming sizes and threaten the ecosystem, as they kill over 72 [[alligator]]s in a matter of days. Due to the threat of the invasive species, Park Ranger Terry O’Hara issues permits to the local hunters to exterminate the pythons – much to Nikki’s dismay. However, the hunters themselves – including Terry’s fiancé Justin – are quickly eliminated by the giant snakes. Vowing to avenge her fiancé’s death, Terry and Angie take boxes of anabolic steroids from Angie’s grandson Manny and inject them into dead chickens before feeding them to alligators. Among the steroids is an experimental serum that neutralizes muscle growth inhibitors with a side effect of increased aggression. Meanwhile, Nikki and her group set up cameras all over the Everglades to monitor Terry’s activities. They catch and record Terry and Angie feeding the steroid-laced chickens to the alligators.  Several months later, Terry meets Dr. Diego Ortiz, who warns her that an all-out war between the giant pythons and the mutated alligators in the Everglades has begun. After seeing a python and an alligator battle each other, Diego urges Terry to cancel a fund-raising event that is to be held that night to help restore a nearby [[estuary]], but his cries fall on deaf ears. As Nikki and her group walk around the forest to plant [[pheromones]], they discover the skeleton of a dead giant python before they are attacked by a giant alligator and Gia is eaten. In another part of the Everglades, Diego discovers that the alligators have laid hundreds of eggs – all of which are 20-30 times their normal size. He calls Terry and asks her to give him access to explosives to get rid of the eggs, but his request is denied. Flying a helicopter over a swamp, Diego rescues Nikki, but Ben is devoured by an alligator. He offers to fly her to the nearest hospital, but she tells him to bring her to her office immediately. After dropping her off, he returns to the site of the alligator eggs and destroys them with a pack of dynamite. He then finds a cave filled with thousands more eggs and calls Terry, telling her that if she does not evacuate the party nearby, he will call the governor and have him send the [[Army National Guard|National Guard]] to the quarry.  At the fund-raising event, Nikki shows up at the VIP tent uninvited, threatening to blackmail Terry with a disc containing footage of her feeding the alligators. This leads to a [[catfight|fight between the two women]] that destroys the party. Meanwhile, as Nikki and Terry continue their fight in a swamp, the reptiles crash the event, devouring guest of honor [[Micky Dolenz]] and several other partygoers. However, Terry's friend Barbara Fine manages to survive and escape. Realizing that they will have to work together to stop this threat, Nikki and Terry, along with Angie and Diego, drive to [[Miami]] to get help and prevent the reptiles from invading the city, but are too late and Angie is devoured by a python as they flee from the city. Nikki comes up with a plan to save Florida: she plants explosives in the quarry while Terry and Diego fly over Miami in a [[crop duster]] and spray pheromones they acquired from Nikki’s office, luring the reptiles to them. However, when their plane crashes on a highway after being hit by a python, Terry takes the remaining bottles of pheromones and drives an abandoned car to lure the reptiles away from the [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station|Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant]]. Back in the cave, Nikki finds herself surrounded by an alligator and hundreds of hatchlings. Terry rescues her by driving her car with a lit container of gasoline toward the alligator. Surrounded by the remaining reptiles around the quarry, the two women lock themselves inside a supply shed, where Nikki admits to Terry that she released the snakes into the Everglades, to Terry's disgust. Diego arrives in a rescue helicopter and picks up Nikki, but is too late to save Terry, who is caught by an alligator and killed with Nikki and Diego helpless to save her. Nikki blows up the quarry, killing all of the reptiles in sight; but the explosion rocks the helicopter, throwing her off as she falls into a swamp. As the helicopter circles back for Nikki while pieces of pythons and alligators rain around her, she is bitten in half by a python head that is still alive (as snake heads can survive for up to an hour).  One year after the incident, Diego cuts a ribbon to inaugurate the O’Hara-Riley Estuary, named in memory of Terry and Nikki.  
Megamind: The Button of Doom
 For their first day on the job as the new protectors of Metro City, Megamind ([[Will Ferrell]]) and Minion ([[David Cross]]) are selling off their gadgets from their evil lair to the citizens for good purposes. All of their items get sold (except for the death ray which Megamind used to "kill" Metro Man in the original film). As for the De-Gun, Megamind's weapon of choice used for a number of different destructive functions, it gets sold to a boy named Damien, who accidentally uses it, in its dehydration mode, on his mother and turns her into a cube. After the auction is over, Megamind reveals a suit he created that contains all of Metro Man's powers, which he will wear to protect Metro City.   Minion finds a seemingly harmless button that had also not had been sold. Not knowing what the button does, Megamind pushes it, revealing a giant robot called the Mega-Megamind. The robot thinks that Megamind is Metro Man, and starts attacking him. Megamind fights the robot with his new powers, but is defeated. He and Minion hide in the Invisible Car. Megamind decides that they should live in the car from then on, because he programmed the robot to not stop until the hero (and his assistant) is destroyed. Minion reveals that he still kept the Spiderbot, a robot that Megamind wanted to throw away, suggesting that Megamind should try to be a hero his way rather than try to do the job the way Metro Man did it. Megamind plans to lure the Mega-Megamind to a spot where the Death Ray shoots: the old observatory to which the real Metro Man was lured. However, Minion realizes that he cannot activate the Death Ray because the control buttons were broken. He then tries to find the Death Ray remote control, but Megamind does not remember what the remote looks like, so Minion tries all the remotes. As the robot finds Megamind, Minion finally finds the correct remote and activates the Death Ray. Megamind and the Spiderbot get off the robot, using the robot's wrist-mounted shooter just before it explodes.   The duo then recover the De-Gun from Damien, who not only has refused to re-hydrate his mother but also used it on the parents of several other children, who are all now having a party to celebrate no longer having to do as they are told. Megamind then re-hydrates the parents with a glass of water to ensure that the children will face punishment for their actions, much to the children's dismay. The short ends with Megamind and Minion seeing a signal in the sky (an obvious spoof of the [[Bat-Signal]]) and riding off in the Invisible Car as they are called to action.  
Meanwhile (film)
 A man must traverse the city of Manhattan to get the keys to a friend’s apartment while coming in contact with various New Yorkers along the way.  
Megan Is Missing
 Megan Stewart, a popular 14-year-old girl, is well known and liked among her peers and is an [[Honors student|honors student]]. However, Megan lives a double life — she is a drug addict, a victim of [[Child sexual abuse|child sexual abuse]], and has a turbulent relationship with her mother, who never forgave Megan for reporting her husband to authorities for molesting her at 9 years old, which led to his imprisonment. Amy Herman, her innocent best friend, is an outcast who doesn't want to fully let go of her childhood which causes her to be ridiculed by Megan's more troublesome friends.   Amy, struggling with her insecurities, clings to her relationship with Megan as a lifeline to social acceptance. The two regularly communicate by web chat cameras or cell phone. While talking to one of her friends via web cam, Megan is introduced to a 17-year-old boy named Josh in a chatroom. Desperate for love and approval, Megan finds herself intrigued and attracted to him. On January 14, 2007, Megan goes to meet Josh in person behind a diner, and she is never seen again. Police investigate her disappearance, but soon begin to give up after finding few leads and begin to assume she simply ran away.  However, Amy believes otherwise and talks online with Josh to find out if he knows about Megan's fate. She finds his answers regarding her suspicious. After seeing security footage of her kidnapping, Amy tells the police about Josh and his possible involvement in her disappearance, which re-sparks the investigation. Josh confronts Amy and threatens her, saying he is watching her. Subsequently, disturbing images of Megan being tortured while immobilized in a contraption begin to appear on an online fetish forum. Three weeks after her disappearance, Amy visits a personal hiding spot underneath an old bridge where she and Megan used to tell each other secrets and begins to record a video diary. Right before the video ends, someone is seen about to grab her. It is revealed that Amy had disappeared as well. Investigators find her video camera in a garbage can near her hiding spot.  In unedited footage found on the camera, Josh unlocks a large door in a basement where he has been hiding Amy, in her underwear and chained to the wall. He makes her eat food in a dog bowl before he violently rapes her. He later returns to apologize, and says he will let her go. He then shows her a barrel and tells her to get into it so that she will not know where he lives when they leave. After Josh opens up the barrel, Amy runs away screaming as she sees Megan's rotting corpse inside. Josh grabs Amy and forces her into the barrel along with Megan's body before locking it. He loads the barrel into the car and then drives to a forest, where he digs a large hole as Amy screams and begs for her life. Josh pushes the barrel into the hole and fills it up before walking away, leaving Amy to die.  During the ending credits, a clip shows Megan and Amy relaxing on a bed together, talking about their plans for the future.

Melancholia (2011 film)
 The film begins with an introductory sequence involving the main characters and images from space.<ref name="NYT-20111230"></ref> These virtually still images reveal the key elements of the film: Justine the bride in deep melancholy with birds falling behind her; of a lawn with trees and sundial with two different shadows; [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]]'s ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' burning; and the black horse collapsing in slow motion; Justine as a bride being swept along by a river; her wedding dress tangled in plant matter; and finally Justine and her nephew building their magic cave before Melancholia crashes into Earth.  === Part One: "Justine" === Newlyweds Justine and Michael arrive two hours late for their own wedding reception at the estate of Justine's sister, Claire, and her husband, John. Justine has a [[dysfunctional family]]: brother-in-law John appears to resent having to pay for the wedding; father Dexter is [[hedonistic]] and selfish to the point of [[narcissism]], while mother Gaby is brutally honest and jaded to the point of getting herself thrown out of the wedding. No one asks what Justine wants, or why she is unhappy, but throughout her wedding she is praised for being beautiful. Claire urges Justine to hide her debilitating [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] from her new husband Michael. Justine flees the wedding reception despite being held back by her wedding dress, which unceremoniously tears. Justine eventually heads to the far end of the golf course and watches the night sky, squatting and urinating on the 18th hole.  Justine's boss, Jack, is ruthless, greedy, and gluttonous. During the most personal part of his wedding speech, he is hustling her to meet a work deadline (she writes copy) on the night of her wedding. He pushes her throughout the evening to create a tagline to promote a campaign based on a modern [[facsimile]] of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]’s [[The Land of Cockaigne]] (the mythical land of excess). She later opens an art book at this painting. During a critical part of the wedding, the cake cutting, Justine and Gaby independently escape to take baths.  Justine's boss's nephew, Tim, is given the chance to exploit the opportunity to get the tagline at all costs in order to promote his career: a task similar to what Justine was previously so successful at. He reluctantly, but doggedly, pursues Justine throughout the wedding reception. She cannot [[consummate]] her marriage with her husband and eventually goes out onto a sand trap and has sex with Tim. Unable to get the tagline from Justine, Tim is later fired for his professional failure, but Justine also resigns, telling Jack that he is a "despicable, power-hungry little man." After several hours of being alienated from each other, Justine and Michael quietly agree to call off the wedding. Michael departs. Early the following morning, while horseback riding with Claire, Justine notices [[Antares]] is no longer visible in the sky.  === Part Two: "Claire" ===  John explains that the reason for Antares' disappearance was because the newly discovered planet "Melancholia" was blocking the star from view. Melancholia, a [[rogue planet]] that entered the [[Solar System]] from behind the Sun, has now become visible in the sky as it approaches ever closer to Earth. John is excited about the planet and looks forward to the "fly-by" predicted by scientists.  [[File:EarthAndMelancholiaDanceOfDeath.svg|thumb|Melancholia's first approach and final collision with Earth, as described (and shown briefly in a similar diagram) in the film]]  A few months after the failed wedding, Justine's depression has grown even worse. She is placed in the care of Claire and John. Justine is essentially catatonic and Claire is unable to help her. Claire is unable, even, to help her sister into the bath. Justine eventually admits that she is so numb that even her favourite meal tastes of ash.   As Justine seems to lose her sanity, her connection to her beloved black horse Abraham becomes more remote and frustrating. On two occasions, the horse refuses to cross a bridge over a river. Justine acts more brutally toward the horse and eventually whips it unmercifully to the ground.  Meanwhile Claire is fearful that the end of the world is imminent, despite her husband's assurances. She searches the Internet and finds an article predicting that Melancholia and the Earth will, in fact, collide. Her husband assures her that these anecdotes are written by "prophets of doom" looking for their 15 minutes of fame. Claire tries to relax. The next day, a somewhat-healthier Justine confesses to Claire that she simply "knows" certain things--like the number of beans in the bottle at her wedding reception, and that Earth and Melancholia will actually destroy each other. What's more, Justine says: this is a good thing, because the Earth is evil.  That night, Melancholia passes safely by Earth, as predicted by the scientists (to great relief). However, the next day Claire realizes (when using a simple homemade device made by her son) that Melancholia is actually getting bigger and circling back--as predicted by the obscure Internet article. She begins to [[panic]]. She frantically looks for her husband but eventually finds John dead in the black horse’s stable: having feared facing his family's disappointment, he poisoned himself. Claire, now realizing without a doubt that Melancholia's impending arrival is actually real, releases Abraham in order to support her alibi of John having simply taken a long, leisurely stroll around the estate.   Claire calls the rest of her family together for a completely typical breakfast. Justine, appearing to have recovered somewhat, questions Claire's intentions. Suddenly, as a result of Melancholia's proximity to Earth, a hailstorm starts. A panicked Claire tries to escape the estate with her son, but the golf cart she is riding shuts down as she attempts to cross the same bridge as Justine did earlier. Returning to the mansion, Claire tries to accept the inevitable. In a private conversation with Justine, Claire suggests that their last act together be coming together on the terrace with wine and music. Justine dismisses her idea with brutal honesty.  Having noticed that Abraham is wandering around the estate without any sign of his father, Claire's son, Leo, is frightened. "Dad said there's nothing to do, nowhere to hide," Leo says, aware of Melancholia's closeness. He is reassured by Justine who says that they can be safe in a "magic cave", something she had promised several times throughout the film to build. Leo, Justine, and Claire sit on the manicured golf course in an unfinished [[tepee]] as the final storm begins. Leo believes in the magic cave and naively closes his eyes. Claire is terrified and cries profusely. Justine watches them both, and accepts her fate calmly and stoically. Melancholia fills up the sky and the world comes to an end.

Midnight in Paris
 In 2010, Gil Pender, a successful but creatively unfulfilled Hollywood [[screenwriter]], and his fiancée Inez, are in [[Paris]] vacationing with Inez's wealthy, conservative parents. Gil is struggling to finish his first [[novel]], centered on a man who works in a [[nostalgia]] shop. Inez dismisses his ambition as a romantic daydream, and encourages him to stick with lucrative screenwriting. Gil is considering moving to Paris (which he notes, much to the dismay of his fiancée, is at its most beautiful in the rain). Inez is intent on living in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. By chance, they are joined by Inez's friend Paul, who is described as both pedantic and a pseudo-intellectual, and his wife Carol. Paul speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy on the highlights of Paris up to the point of even contradicting a tour guide at the [[Musée Rodin]], and insisting that his knowledge of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] relationships is more accurate than that of the guide. Inez admires him; Gil finds him insufferable.<ref name="the film">the film</ref>  A night of wine tasting gets Gil drunk and he decides to walk the streets of Paris to get back to the hotel; Inez goes off with Paul by taxi. He stops to reconnoiter his location. At midnight, a 1920s [[Peugeot Type 176|car]] pulls up beside him, and the passengers, dressed in 1920s wardrobe, urge him to join them. They hit a party for [[Jean Cocteau]] attended by notable people of 1920s Paris: [[Cole Porter]] and his wife Linda Lee Porter, [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda]], and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Scott Fitzgerald]]. Zelda gets bored at the party and encourages Scott and Gil to leave with her. They head first to Bricktops where they see [[Josephine Baker]] dancing, and then to a cafe, where they run into [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Juan Belmonte]]. Zelda gets upset when Hemingway says her novel was weak, and she heads with Belmonte to St. Germain, followed shortly thereafter by Scott, who doesn't like the thought of his wife and the toreador. After discussing writing, Hemingway offers to show Gil's novel to [[Gertrude Stein]]. As Gil exits the building to fetch his manuscript from his hotel, he finds he has returned to 2010; the bar where the 1920s [[Intellectual|literati]] were drinking is now a [[laundromat]].  The next night, Gil wants to share with Inez his time travel experience. She ditches Gil before the clock strikes midnight. Before long, the same car returns; Gil joins Hemingway on his way to visit a friend. Gil is introduced to Gertrude Stein and other friends at her apartment: [[Pablo Picasso]] and his lover Adriana. Adriana and Gil are instantly attracted to each other. Stein reads aloud the novel's first line:<ref></ref> : Adriana says that she is hooked by these few lines and has always had a longing for the past, especially the [[Belle Époque]].  Gil continues with his time travel for the next couple nights. Inez is annoyed at the boulevards and bistros and Gil's wanderings. Her father is suspicious and hires a private detective to follow him. Adriana has her time with Picasso and Hemingway, and eventually Gil, although he is conflicted by his attraction to her. Gil confides his predicament to [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Man Ray]], and [[Luis Buñuel]], but being [[Surrealism|surrealists]] they see nothing strange about his claim to have come from the future, finding it to be perfectly normal.  Each discusses the impossibility of Gil's relationship with Adriana, and as artists, what work of art from each could come of the romance. Gil would suggest a film [[The Exterminating Angel (film)|plot]] to Buñuel that is the cause of him attempting to understand the purpose of the plot.  Inez and her parents are traveling to Mt. San Michel while Gil meets Gabrielle, an antique dealer and fellow admirer of the [[Lost Generation]]. He buys a Cole Porter [[gramophone record]], and later finds Adriana's diary from the 1920s at a book stall by the [[Seine]], which reveals that she was in love with him. Reading that she dreamed of receiving a gift of earrings from him and then making love to him, Gil attempts to take a pair of Inez's earrings to give to Adriana, but is thwarted by Inez's early return to the hotel room.  Gil buys earrings for Adriana. Returning to the past, he finds her at a party and tells her, "I sense there are some complicated feelings you have for me." He takes her for a walk, they kiss, and he gives her the earrings. While she's putting them on, a horse-drawn carriage comes down the street, and a richly dressed couple inside the carriage invite Gil and Adriana for a ride. The carriage transports the passengers to the [[Belle Époque]], an era Adriana considers Paris's [[Golden Age]]. Gil and Adriana go first to [[Maxim's Paris]], then to the [[Moulin Rouge]] where they meet [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Edgar Degas]]. Gil asks what they thought the best era was, and the three determine that the greatest era was the [[Renaissance]]. The enthralled Adriana is offered a job designing ballet costumes and proposes to Gil that they stay, but Gil, upon observing that different people long for different "golden ages", has an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] and realizes that despite the allure of nostalgia, any time can eventually become a dull "present", so it's best to embrace your actual present. Adriana however, elects to stay in the 1890s, and they part.  Gil rewrites the first two chapters of his novel and retrieves his draft from Stein, who praises his progress as a writer and tells him that Hemingway likes it, but questions why the main character has not realized that his fiancée (based on Inez) is having an affair with a pedantic character (based on Paul).  Gil returns to 2010 and confronts Inez. She admits to having slept with Paul, but dismisses it as a meaningless fling. Gil breaks up with her and decides to move to Paris.

Walking by the Seine at midnight, Gil bumps into Gabrielle,  and, after it starts to rain, he offers to walk her home and they learn that they share the love of Paris in the rain.

Michael (2011 Indian film)
  The film opens some years ago with Kolkata police inspector Michael at a political rally. It is a large rally, several hundred people packed into a square, the largest protest against the current government, yet it is wholly peaceful. Michael receives a radio order to open fire and disperse the crowd. He protests, it is a peaceful rally, but his supervisor, acting on political pressure from above, repeats the order to fire. Michael fires a single shot that accidentally hits a 12 year old boy.  Michael is diagnosed with "progressive myopia" and subsequently fired from his position without severance or pension benefits. He begins receiving angry phone calls from the father of the dead boy. The father threatens to kill Michael's 8 year old son Roy on his 12th birthday.  A couple of years later Michael is living in a small apartment with his son. He makes a miserable living as a projectionist in a movie theater and ekes out some additional income pirating movies for a gang of local thugs. Michael is always harangued by his landlord, the drunk and bitter Mr. DCosta, and continues to receive progressively more threatening calls from the dead boy's father. His only goal is to get his son out of the city and into a boarding school. Rwitika, his only friend, occasionally looks after Roy and urges Michael to pick up and move on. The landlord DCosta frequently bullies and browbeats Michael for overdue rent. Michael is saving furiously to send Roy away and moves the money about his apartment so DCosta cannot find it. Amid this turmoil he finds a quiet comfort in Mrs DCosta who generally sympathizes with him and occasionally warns him if DCosta is about to go on the warpath.  A few days before Roy's 12th birthday Michael gets intensely threatening phone calls. He stumbles out of his movie theater (and forgets an important movie copying job for which he has received an advance). His midget assistant Makkhan copies the movie and tries to sell it to a rival gang. Michael returns later and picks up a DVD (empty, since Makkhan took the movie DVD) and delivers it. When Michael returns home he finds his money gone and the gang boys outside who beat him up until he figures out what happened. His assistant Makkhan shows up, badly beaten up, and discloses that the rival gang members took the DVD and beat him up and gave him no money. If Michael had paid him more money he would not have gone to the other gang. They argue about the money until Michael discovers that his money is gone! Michael, slowly unspooling into insanity, moves Roy to Rwitika's place and subsequently beseeches her to send him away. He barges into DCosta's flat, across the hall, to see them celebrating something. In a maddened (and drunk) stupor Michael threatens DCosta with a pistol and later begs him to return the money. DCosta, himself drunk, curses and berates Michael whereupon Michael, crazed with anger, shoots DCosta dead! His wife reveals that it was she who took the money for her fertility treatment. Michael is shocked and hurt that she betrayed his trust. He runs out of the flat and, knowing that the police will hunt him down for murder, goes to get Roy out of the city.  Michael hurries to Rwitika's place to get Roy. It is midnight, Roy's birthday. Michael runs across a crossroad. A public phone rings, Michael stops to pick it up, it is the dead boy's father, he will shoot Roy! Michael begs him to stop ... Rwitika comes on the line next! Michael hangs up the phone and steps into the road when a passing taxicab runs him over and kills him. It is revealed that Michael had been hearing voices all along (there was no father of the dead boy) and his guilt over the boy at the rally slowly drove him insane. The film ends as a police jeep finds his body and calls for an ambulance.

His condition worsens and he goes from consuming animal blood to depending on human blood for medical sustenance, a necessity which brings out his violent tendencies on people in the city.  Jacob, longing to be normal, hides his deteriorating condition from Mary, and their romantic relationship suffers because of it. Searching for blood at a hospital, Jacob comes in contact with an immoral hospital physician named Marcus ([[Jo D. Jonz]]), who alongside his younger, misguided brother, Russell ([[Arlen Escarpeta]]), helps Jacob by milking a patient for blood in exchange for money, a grim method Jacob is against.

After Marcus hits him, Jacob lashes back and causes Marcus an injury on broken glass, leaving him to bleed heavily.  Jacob reconciles with Mary, confessing to her he is suffering from severe anemia, which plays a role in his skin sensitivity. When they decide to ditch a party at the gallery, Russell tracks and follows them to a quiet location, shooting Mary to avenge his missing brother who he believes Jacob killed. Jacob is able to retrieve the gun and scare him away. He sucks the bullet out of Mary’s chest and soon realizes he passed on his contagious case of anemia to her. Jacob keeps her isolated in his home and not wanting to harm Mary, attempts to convince Detective Ginslegh that he infected and killed the girl in the homicide case whose body burned during sunrise, but there is mysteriously no evidence for an arrest.  Jacob finds out Marcus is alive, and he is left with a burn on his face from escaping daylight, after Jacob had sucked his blood, infected him and left him for dead. Morally corrupt, Marcus forces Jacob and Russell to dismember and dump the dead old man’s body they used to extract blood from. After Marcus decides to dumb the body instead, they revolt against him, with Russell using a [[cinderblock]] to knock Marcus unconscious before running away. Jacob chains Marcus up and leaves him to burn at the break of dawn.

The Minister
 The French government plans to privatize some train stations. Transport minister Bertrand Saint-Jean is supposed to be a major actor of this reform, but neither he nor his friend and assistant Gilles approves the plan.

While his staff oppose the reform, Bertrand hopes the president will provide a watered-down reform to end popular protest. The Prime Minister promises the first step will only consist of five secondary train stations. Bertrand suffers so much from pressure that he has a nightmare in which he commits suicide after reading the five stations are the most prestigious in all of France.

In the end, the President intervenes himself to arbitrate. But contrary to Bertrand's hopes, he has no intention of softening the reform.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol
   [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in [[Budapest]] by assassin Sabine Moreau, who takes the file containing Russian nuclear launch codes he had stolen so she can give them to a man known only as "Cobalt".  Meanwhile, IMF agent [[Ethan Hunt]] has purposely become incarcerated into a [[Moscow]] prison to acquire Bogdan, a source of information on Cobalt. With help of Jane Carter, Hanaway's handler, and newly promoted field agent [[Benji Dunn]], Hunt and Bogdan make their escape. IMF tasks Hunt to infiltrate the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] to gain more information on Cobalt. During the mission, an unknown entity broadcasts on the IMF frequency ordering the detonation of a bomb. Hunt's team aborts the mission just as a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Carter and Dunn escape, but Hunt is captured by [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] agent Anatoly Sidorov and charged with the destruction of the Kremlin.  Hunt is able to escape and regroups with the IMF Secretary who is in Moscow on other business. The Secretary tells Hunt they have had to initiate "Ghost Protocol", disavowing IMF, but secretly orders Hunt to continue to pursue Cobalt. Sidorov's forces catch up to Hunt, and the Secretary is killed; Hunt escapes along with the Secretary's aide and intelligence analyst William Brandt. Regrouping with Carter and Dunn, Brandt is able to identify Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist, who seeks to start a [[nuclear war]] between the U.S. and Russia. Hendricks used the Kremlin bombing to cover up his theft of a Russian nuclear launch-control device, and now is planning a trade with Moreau at the [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]] to gain the required launch codes.  The team travel to Dubai. On the 119th floor of the hotel, they create deceptions using their various gadgetry and disguises to make Moreau believe she is meeting with Hendricks, and vice versa, when in fact they are interacting with the IMF team. Moreau discovers the deception, and in the ensuing chaos, Hendricks manages to escape with the launch codes, losing Hunt's pursuit in the midst of a dust storm. Carter knocks Moreau out of a window to her death when she tries to escape. Brandt accuses her of letting her love for Hanaway compromise the mission, but Hunt recognizes that Brandt has also been keeping secrets from them, having shown combat skills atypical of a mere analyst. Hunt leaves to meet with Bogdan to get more information on Hendricks, while Brandt tells the others that he had been assigned to secretly protect Ethan and his wife Julia in [[Croatia]]. Julia had been killed by a hit squad and Brandt feels responsible for Ethan's loss, which is why he stopped being a field agent.  Bogdan directs Ethan towards [[Mumbai]], where Hendricks is set to negotiate with Indian telecommunications entrepreneur Brij Nath to gain control of an obsolete Soviet military satellite. The IMF team splits up to stop Hendricks; Carter seduces Nath to get the satellite override code, while Hunt, Brandt and Dunn try to stop Hendricks from using Nath's broadcast station. They are too late as Hendricks has sent the launch codes to a Russian [[Delta-class submarine|''Delta III''-class]] [[nuclear submarine]] to fire a single missile at [[San Francisco]] and disabled the station's computer systems. Brandt and Dunn race to get the systems back online to send the override code, while Hunt pursues Hendricks, eventually fighting him face to face in an automated car park. Hendricks, with the launch device, jumps to his death moments before the missile is to land. Hunt takes a dangerous fall to use the device to disable the missile before it strikes. Sidorov, who has followed IMF from Dubai to Mumbai, arrives and realizes that the IMF is innocent of the Kremlin bombing.  The team meets in [[Seattle]] after Ethan accepts a new mission from [[Luther Stickell]]. Brandt confesses to Ethan about his failure to protect Julia. Ethan, however, reveals that her "death" and the murder of the Serbians were part of a plot to give her a new identity and enable Ethan to infiltrate the prison. A relieved Brandt accepts his mission. Ethan and Julia gaze at each other from afar before Ethan departs for his next mission.

Moneyball (film)
  [[Oakland Athletics]] [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Billy Beane]] is upset by his team's loss to the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[2001 American League Division Series|2001 postseason]]. With the impending departure of star players [[Johnny Damon]], [[Jason Giambi]], and [[Jason Isringhausen]] to [[free agency]], Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002]] within Oakland's limited payroll.  During a visit to the [[Cleveland Indians]], Beane meets [[Paul DePodesta#Moneyball|Peter Brand]], a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess player value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted Beane out of high school; though scouts considered Beane hugely promising, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. Brand admits that, based on his method of assessing player value, he would not have drafted him until the ninth round. Impressed, Beane hires Brand as his assistant manager.  Rather than relying on the [[scout (sports)|scouts]]' experience and intuition, Brand uses [[sabermetrics]], selecting players based on their [[on-base percentage]] (OBP). Brand and Beane hire undervalued players such as unorthodox [[submarine pitcher]] [[Chad Bradford]], aging outfielder [[David Justice]], and an injured catcher, [[Scott Hatteberg]].  Oakland scouts are hostile towards the strategy, and Beane fires one, Grady Fuson, after he accuses him of destroying the team. Beane also faces opposition from [[Art Howe]], the Athletics' manager. With tensions already high between them due to a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and plays a lineup he prefers.  Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Brand argues their [[Sample (statistics)|sample size]] is too small to conclude the method does not work, and Beane convinces the owner to stay the course. He trades away the lone traditional first baseman, [[Carlos Peña]], to force Howe to use Hatteberg, threatening to make similar deals if Howe does not cooperate.   The Athletics win 19 consecutive games, tying for the longest winning streak in [[American League]] history. Though Beane does not watch games, his young daughter persuades him to attend the game against the [[Kansas City Royals]], where Oakland is leading 11–0 after the third inning. Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the team falter and allow the Royals to even the score. Thanks to a [[walk-off home run]] by Hatteberg, the Athletics win a record-breaking 20th consecutive win. Beane tells Brand he will not be satisfied until they have "changed the game" by winning the championship using their system.  The Athletics lose in 5 games in the postseason. Beane is contacted by the owner of the [[Boston Red Sox]], who realizes that sabermetrics is the future of baseball. Beane declines an opportunity to become the Red Sox general manager, despite the $12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest-paid general manager in history. He returns to Oakland. Two years later, the Red Sox win the [[2004 World Series]] using the model pioneered by the Athletics.

 Grace Bennett ([[Selena Gomez]]) is a [[New York University]] bound, Texas high-school student who works as a waitress with her best friend, high school dropout Emma Perkins ([[Katie Cassidy]]) to earn money for a trip to [[Paris]] after graduation. Grace's stepfather pays for her uptight older stepsister Meg Kelly ([[Leighton Meester]]) to come with them on the trip. Emma goes to Paris despite her boyfriend Owen's proposal of marriage. The trip quickly proves to be a disappointment-they have been ripped off with a cramped hotel room and a tour that moves too fast for anyone to properly appreciate anything. After being left behind by their tour guide, the three girls seek refuge from the rain in a posh hotel. There, the hotel staff and paparazzi mistake Grace for the spoiled [[celebutante]] British heiress Cordelia Winthrop-Scott, Grace's double, who leaves rather than stay to attend an auction for a Romanian charity for which she is to donate an expensive [[Bulgari]] necklace. The three girls spend the night in Cordelia's suite, and the next day fly to [[Monte Carlo]] with Cordelia's luggage, despite Meg's misgivings.  At [[Monte Carlo]] the girls meet Theo Marchand, the son of the philanthropist hosting Cordelia. Theo is cold towards the three, because he dislikes Cordelia's spoiled brat nature, but he escorts them to a ball, where Grace successfully fools Cordelia's aunt Alicia and Emma dances with a prince. Meg reunites with Riley, an Australian backpacker and ex-rugby player she briefly met in Paris. They find they have things in common, and spend time together before he leaves for [[Italy]]. When Grace has to take part in a game of polo, Alicia discovers the impersonation because of Grace's different riding style. Alicia believes that Grace is a lookalike, hired by Cordelia to take her place while she parties, but in order not to endanger the charity auction she agrees to keep silent. Theo is attracted to "Cordelia's" frank personality, while Emma's prince invites her to a party on a yacht. Emma dresses up for the party in the Bulgari auction necklace but meets Meg on the way, and Meg takes it for safekeeping, but later forgets about it, accidentally leaving it in Riley's backpack. At the party, Emma is disillusioned by the prince's obnoxious nature and snideness and arrogance towards the waitresses.  Owen arrives in [[Monte Carlo]] in search of Emma. So does Cordelia, and she sees the newspaper account of Grace's appearance at the ball. She finds that the necklace is missing and calls the police. The girls have gone in search of Riley but he shows up at the hotel with the necklace; they find Cordelia in the room. When Cordelia threatens to call and withdraw the necklace from the auction, the girls panic and tackle her to the couch. When people come to the door, they muffle her screams and Grace covers for them. They then tie her to a chair and gag her by stuffing an apple in her mouth so Grace can take her place at the auction. Cordelia escapes, and reveals Grace's fraud at the auction. She demands that Grace be arrested, but after Grace's sincere public confession Alicia bids the unexpectedly large amount of €6 million for the necklace to save her. The film ends with Cordelia being forced to move in a ranch, Meg joining Riley on his travels around the world; Owen and Emma moving into their own home in Texas; and Theo Marchand and Grace reuniting at the Romanian school where they are volunteering.  
The Monk (2011 film)
 An abandoned baby is taken in by a Spanish monastery, and raised as a monk, christened Capuchin Ambrosio. An exceptional preacher, Ambrosio is respected by all. One day a masked figure by the name of Valerio from [[Burgos]] arrives at the monastery with his godfather, explaining the mask as necessary due to terrible burns inflicted on him in a fire that killed his parents. He expresses a desire to join the monastery which is initially shunned by several of the monks, however Ambrosio convinces them to not fear his differences, and to accept him.  Valerio later reveals to Ambrosio that he is actually a woman by the name of Matilda, and Ambrosio orders her to leave. As a last request she asks for a rose from his rose garden, and upon reaching in to pluck one for her, Ambrosio is bitten by a giant [[centipede]]. As he becomes delirious from the effects of the venom, he is [[Seduction|seduced]] by Matilda and compromises his faith. Another lady, Antonia, who had recently heard him preach comes to the monastery to ask that Ambrosio see her sick mother. He complies and is told of a story by the sickly mother that she left a son Mateo that was lost years ago and this troubles her soul. Driven by a carnal lust for Matilda, Ambrosio transgresses and he is soon found desiring the innocent Antonia now. He also sees apparitions of the pregnant Nun he condemned to death by turning her over to the prioress.  Matilda recognizes Ambrosio's new interest in the fair Antonia and uses magic spells to help the monk in his pursuit of her. She resists and her rape by him and discovery of her murdered mother (at the hand of Ambrosio) leads to her insanity. As her mother dies, she utters the word "Mateo", indicating that Ambrosio now knows that he is the older brother of Antonia. Returning to the monastery, Ambrosio is delivered to the [[Inquisition]] where he is condemned to death by starvation; escaping only by selling his soul to the devil in an effort to save Antonia. It later emerges that Matilda is an instrument of [[Satan]] in female form. The devil prevents Ambrosio's final repentance...

Desperate to fill the position, the principal, Mme Vaillancourt, takes him at his word and gives him the job. He gets to know his students despite both the evident [[culture gap]] and his difficulty adapting to the school system's constraints.  As the children try to move on from their former teacher's suicide, nobody at the school is aware of Bashir's painful past, or his precarious status as a [[Canadian immigration and refugee law|refugee]]. His wife, who was a teacher and writer, died along with the couple's daughter and son in an arson attack. The murderers were angered by her last book, in which she pointed a finger at those responsible for the country's reconciliation, which had led to the liberation of many perpetrators of huge crimes. The film goes on to explore Bashir's relationships with the students and faculty, and how the students come to grips with their former teacher's suicide. One student, Alice, writes an assignment on the death of their teacher, revealing the deep pain and confusion felt by each of the students.  Bashir eventually comes to be loved and respected by the students he is teaching, but the teacher's death still haunts the students. During a school dance, a student named Simon is found to have a photo of his former teacher. It is revealed that he tried to get her into trouble after she tried to help him through his family struggles. Bashir eventually gets the students to open up about the death, especially Simon, who is blamed and blames himself for causing the teacher's suicide. Eventually, some parents discover that Bashir has no [[Teaching qualification#Canada|teaching qualification]]; previously, he had run a restaurant. He is then fired from the school. He asks the principal to be able to teach one more day, convincing her by noting that the old teacher never got to say goodbye to her students.  On his last day, Bashir has his students correct a fable he wrote which is a metaphor of his tragic past life in Algeria and the loss of his family in a fire. Before he leaves, one of his students, Alice (whom he professed to be his favourite to her mother) gives him a tearful hug goodbye.  
A Monster in Paris
 The film is set in 1910; the story beginning by documenting the [[1910 Great Flood of Paris|flooding of the River Seine]] that year.  Shy projectionist Emile has a passion for film and is in love with his co-worker at the cinema, Maud. His friend, an exuberant inventor and delivery driver, Raoul, picks him up from work to transport him in his bizarre vehicle (called "Catherine"), to obtain a new belt for his projector. In purchasing a new belt, Emile also buys himself a new camera, which is almost stolen by a thief. The story also introduces Lucille, Raoul's childhood friend: a [[cabaret]] singer at the club L'Oiseau Rare ("The Rare Bird"), whose aunt Carlotta tries to marry her to the wealthy Police Commissioner, Victor Maynott. One evening, Raoul brings Emile to make a delivery to the [[Jardin des Plantes|Botanical Gardens]]. In the absence of the Professor who works there, the place is guarded by his assistant, a [[proboscis monkey]] named Charles. Here, Raoul experiments with an "Atomize-a-Tune" mixture which temporarily gives Charles the voice of an opera singer and an unstable "super fertilizer" which instantly grows a sunflower seed into a giant sunflower, which topples towards Raoul and Emile. In the ensuing disorder, an explosion occurs when the two chemicals are mixed. Everyone is unscathed, but Emile is convinced he has glimpsed a monstrous creature, a photo of which later appears in the newspapers.  An investigation is launched into the whereabouts of the creature by Maynott's second in command, Pâté, but is fronted by Maynott, in the hope of popular support for his mayoral candidacy. At the same time he tries unsuccessfully to seduce Lucille. Meanwhile, Lucille is trying to find a new musician for her show, and turns down the cabaret's waiter, Albert. Trying to vacate the cabaret, Albert stumbles across the creature and flees, terrified. Upon seeing the creature, Lucille is frightened, but hears it sing and discovers it is not dangerous but has a lovely singing voice. She therefore welcomes it, under the name of Francœur (meaning "honest heart"). It is then revealed that the creature is a [[flea]] that the fertilizer, amidst all the other chemicals in the laboratory explosion, enlarged to human scale. During the investigation, Emile and Raoul's role in the laboratory incident is discovered. For Maynott's interest in the creature, they receive the [[Legion of Honor|Medal of Honor]]. On a challenge set earlier by Lucille, Raoul uses this to get the best seats at Lucille's show at "The Rare Bird", where Francœur and Lucille sing as a [[duet]]. After the show, Emile and Raoul congratulate Lucille on her show, but Lucille reveals the identity of Francœur, which Albert reports to the police. Emile, Raoul, and Francœur narrowly escape and Albert is arrested on suspicion of lying to the police.  The following day, Maynott opens the [[Montmartre]] Funicular, which serves Montmartre and the [[Basilica of the Sacré Cœur]]. The trio, along with Francœur and Charles, decide to feign the death of the creature. When Maynott discovers the creature hiding under the stage, Francœur and his friends are chased through the streets of Paris by Maynott. The chase concludes at the tip of the [[Eiffel Tower]]. After a battle to protect Francœur from Maynott, a gunshot from Maynott and Francœur's sudden disappearance leads everyone to believe he is dead. Maynott is then arrested by Pâté for premeditated murder (on the basis that Francœur is innocent), while Emile and Maud fall into each other's arms. Later that evening Lucille is distraught by the disappearance of Francœur; but Raoul convinces her to sing anyway. Whilst struggling to begin, she hears Francœur, restored to his natural size, sing in her ear. Some time later, the absent Professor returns from his trip; and when the three friends explain the situation, he permanently returns Francœur to human size. Francœur receives second billing on the posters advertising Lucille's show. Lucille and Raoul later share their first kiss in Lucille's dressing room. In a flashback, it is revealed that Raoul misunderstood Lucille's intentions when she took his toy truck as a child&ndash;she had hoped that he would pursue her.  In a [[mid-credits scene]], Raoul, Lucille, Francœur, Maud, Emile, Charles, Carlotta, and Pâté scatter super-fertilized sunflower seeds to drain the flooded Seine. In a second [[post-credits scene]], Maynott is shown in the same cell as Albert and the thief from earlier, forced to endure the duo's appalling singing.

The Monitor (film)
 Anna (Noomi Rapace) and her 8-year-old son Anders (Vetle Qvenild Werring) move into a large flat outside Oslo. Anna is concerned that they will be found by her violent husband after being relocated. The two receive occasional visits from two child care workers, Grete and Ole, who warn Anna that her ex-husband may soon reopen a custody case over Anders. Anders begins attending a nearby school.   Anna first forces Anders to sleep with her in her room, but when this is discouraged by the case workers she looks for a babycall (baby monitor) at an electronics stop and meets Helge (Kristoffer Joner),<ref></ref> a shy gentleman whose mother is dying in a hospital. The two begin to visit regularly at and near Helge's workplace. Helge tells Anna that his mother is unwell and currently at a hospital, and Anna tells Helge about her son. The two developed a friendly albeit fragile relationship - while Anna is an over-protective mother, Helge was an over-protected son unwilling to acknowledge the negative feelings he has about how his mother treated him as a child. Compelled to feel charitable towards over-protective mothers, Helge is only too eager to ‘understand’ Anna’s refusal to let go of Anders. Similarly, Anna is only too eager to believe that an over-protected son might grow up to understand why his mother would not let him go.  The first night Anders slept in his own room, Anna hears disturbing sounds on the babycall, including screaming. Terrified, Anna runs to Anders' room but finds him  asleep. The next day, Anna returns to the electronics store and spoke to Helge, who said that her monitor could pick up other frequencies if they were close enough, meaning that the screams were emanating from someone else within 50 meters. On a map of their apartment complex, drawn by Anders, Anna begins to try to decipher the source of the other frequency.  Anders approaches Anna with a similar looking boy as she waits to pick him up from school. Anders tells Anna that he has made a new friend and is going to take him home with them. Anna is fairly suspicious of the boy who hardly speaks and does not return Anna's gestures to connect with him. After hearing some ruckus Anna finds Anders in the kitchen, upset because he believes Anna ruined his picture, which now has a dead body covered in blood at the base of the apartments drawn on it. Anna denies adding this to the paper and attributes it to Anders' friend.  The next day, while Anders is at school Anna visits the lake near her home. Shortly thereafter Anders asks if Anna will show him the lake, and so she leads him to it, only for the two to arrive at a parking lot despite taking the same route.  A few days later Anna follows a woman she believes had something to do with the screaming on the baby monitor. While she's there, Anna sees a man drowning a little boy, who is in fact Anders' friend. After the man and his party leave, Anna jumps into the water to try and retrieve the boy. She stays underwater for too long and blacks out.   Anna wakes up in a hospital, with a nurse telling her she was found looking confused at a parking lot, though her clothes were wet. Anna leaves the hospital and goes to Anders' school to retrieve him but she is told by the principal to leave him because there is a suspcision of child abuse. Anna disregards the principal and brings Anders home.   When the two arrive home Anna discovers that their front door is open. She suspects an intruder has entered the flat and has Anders hide in his room. It is revealed that the Ole is there. He tells her that his partner has quit that it is now only up to him if Anna is to keep Anders with the case soon to be reopened. Ole advances on an uncomfortable Anna and tells her he will be back that evening. Anna then goes to the workplace of Helge and invites him for dinner.   While the two eat, there is a knock at the door. Anna asks Helge to answer it for her and she hides. Helge, seeming confused, opens the front door but no one is there. When he turns around he sees Anders' friend, whom he mistakes for Anders, who shows Helge bruises on his body and then runs off to the room of Anders. Helge tries to follow him but is confronted by Anna who yells at him and he leaves. Anna opens the window and calls for Helge to return but he does not. She sees Ole and hurriedly leaves the flat to evade Ole.  The next day Ole is back at Anna's and tells her that her ex-husband is coming right now to retrieve Anders. Anna lets Ole in and shortly hears knocking on the door. Panicked that it is her ex-husband, Anna grabs a pair of scissors, which she stabbed Ole with, killing him just outside her door. Helge, who has just arrived, pounds on the door trying to get Anna to open it. Helge runs into the apartment, to see Anna sitting on the windowsill with Anders' arms wrapped around her. Just as he reaches Anna, she leans forward and falls off the windowsill. Helge rushes down the building, sees Anna on the ground, but no Anders. When Helge asks Anna where Anders is, she isn't able to answer. Later Helge is told that Anna's husband killed Anders years ago, and that her husband had killed himself as well.   Helge finds the drawing of the apartment complex with a grave marked on the forest adjacent to it. He goes into the forest and finds a body wrapped, buried in the earth. It is of the boy imagined to be the friend of Anders, murdered by his abusive parents. Later, Helge sits next to Anna's body and retells the story of a boy and his mother. The ending scene shows a happy Anders and Anna strolling in the forest towards the lake, then sitting down by the water.

Her mother transferred Rebecca to the school, hoping to help her daughter escape the memory of her father's death. With the help of her best friend and roommate, Lucy, Rebecca soon recovers.  The following year, a mysterious, dark-haired girl named Ernessa Bloch enrolls into the school. Lucy quickly becomes best friends with Ernessa and becomes distant from Rebecca. Ernessa's presence makes Rebecca feel uneasy. She tries to confront Lucy about Ernessa's dark secrets, but her pleas are dismissed as jealousy. Eerie things start to happen. First, Charley gets expelled because of Ernessa. Dora dies in a freak accident shortly after spying on Ernessa's room, and a teacher is found murdered in the woods. Tension starts to grow at the school.  To Rebecca, Ernessa is an enigma. She seems like she can walk through closed windows, and she is often seen lingering around the basement (a place that students are forbidden to go). Rebecca thinks Ernessa is a vampire.  Ernessa slowly gets rid of Rebecca's close friends, leaving Rebecca to find out what is happening by herself.  A new English teacher, Mr Davies, arrives at the school. Mr Davies shows particular interest in Rebecca. The two share ideas on [[Romantic literature]] and poetry. Rebecca soon learns that vampires do not necessarily drink blood, but they can drain the lively spirit out of their victims. Mr Davies addresses himself as a fan of Rebecca's poet father. Rebecca turns to Mr Davies for help, and, during their conversation, the two kiss but Rebecca pulls away.  Ernessa confronts Rebecca in the library and presents her with a sharp razor and elaborates on the pleasure of death. Another time, Ernessa sings a disturbing nursery rhyme about "[[The Juniper Tree (fairy tale)|The Juniper Tree]]" then slits her own wrists, causing blood to rain down on her and Rebecca. Afterwards, Ernessa and the blood disappear.  Lucy is sent to the hospital, but only Rebecca knows that Lucy is sick because of Ernessa. Rebecca tries to convince Lucy that Ernessa is the root of all their problems, but Lucy refuses to listen and profanes at her. Although Lucy recovers for a couple days, she soon dies after Ernessa completely drains the life out of her.  Rebecca steals the keys to the basement, and after entering, sees an old stone coffin with Ernessa's full name engraved on it. From an old diary, Rebecca learns that many years ago Ernessa's father also killed himself, and Ernessa, unable to cope with the grief, took her own life thereafter. Rebecca soon learns that Ernessa has wanted Rebecca to kill herself.  Shortly after, Rebecca returns to the basement to discover Ernessa sleeping in the stone coffin. Rebecca pours kerosene on Ernessa and around the coffin and lights it before Ernessa wakes up. Rebecca walks outside to see a fire truck present and her classmates standing around. Through a door she sees the ghost of Ernessa, who slowly turns around and walks into the sun before vanishing.  Knowing the authorities are suspicious of her, Rebecca is certain that Ernessa will not have left any remains. During the ride to the police station she pulls a razor blade out of her diary and drops it out of the window, staring blankly into the distance.  
Mostar Round-Trip
 [[File:Reconstruction of Tito's Palace in Mostar.JPG|thumb|right|Reconstruction of [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s Palace in [[Mostar]]. The film depicts several buildings and structures that have been damaged during the [[Bosnian War]], including [[Stari Most]] (the old bridge) which has been restored after being mostly destroyed during the war.]][[File:David, Yuval and Neus.JPG|thumb|right|From left to right: Director [[David Fisher (filmmaker)|David Fisher]], Neus Rodeta and Yuval Fisher]][[File:Yuval Fisher and Salam Sa’adi.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: Yuval Fisher and Salam Sa’adi]] A year after 17-year-old Yuval leaves home in Israel to attend the [[United World College]] in [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], filmmaker David Fisher, his father, follows. While the film centers around the young students inhabiting the college, David uses the film as a tool to contemplate and examine his role as a parent, acknowledging that one of his deep regrets was not getting to know his own father, who was an introvert affected by [[Holocaust]]. During three Round-Trips to Mostar, Yuval’s relationships unfold: between him and his father, his Israeli peers and his Spanish girlfriend, Neus, a relationship which is ultimately doomed - because of Yuval’s impending military service.  The film addresses different issues concerning [[Coming of age]] such as alienation, love, family and military service (part of the film is set during the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]). These stories are set against the backdrop of this college, situated on what used to be the frontline between the Croatians and the Bosniaks, during the [[Bosnian War]] that ended in 1995. Although Yuval is far from home, this actually brings him and his father  closer together. Their talks reveal father and teenager son tension with great honesty, maturity and openness. Yuval's roommate is Salam, an Israeli Arab, with whom he holds passionate political debates. Salam is a "playboy" and a charmer, so it's no wonder Yuval brings him a sugar cube to bed, one morning after a bitter fight they had over Middle Eastern politics. With them are also Niv, who talks very honestly about his encounter with Arab peers, stating that back home the word "Arab" is used in a derogative way amongst his friends, a fact he is now ashamed of; and Niva – she just wants to be an actress and doesn't know what to expect from her army service. The film is filled with [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] like scenes of the life of youngsters at the college, but with the ironic setting of a city that doesn't leave them indifferent.  The UWC college is portrayed as microcosms which proves as a highly valuable and substantial stage in preparing the students for a mature and challenging life as grownups.

 Michael Pinto (Babbar) is a well-intentioned simpleton born and brought up in a small [[Goan]] village. His world revolves around his doting mother and his passion for music. After his mother's sudden death, he decides to become a priest to fulfill her last wish. Before attending school, he plans to visit his childhood friend Sameer (Mathur) in [[Mumbai]]. At a train station, Michael unknowingly disrupts a meeting between Maggie (Koechlin), an aspiring [[dancer]] who instantly attracts his attention, and a crook who intends to sell her to a [[pimp]] in Delhi. Michael is left alone at Sameer and his wife Suhani's (Seth) apartment when they leave for a party.  Michael accidentally locks himself out in the apartment's balcony. He escapes through a nearby drainage pipe, but ends up in a music shop, where he encounters a local [[Don (honorific)|Don]] (Deshpande), who is impressed by Michael's musical talent. The Don heads a disorganised criminal organisation, which is responsible for a recent kidnapping. His assistant Mac (Zutshi) plans to assassinate him to take over his position, and blackmails two of the Don's most loyal henchmen: Ajay and Vijay (Amin and Karim Hajee), into doing the job.  While stuck in traffic, Sameer and Suhani contemplate their relationship problems, which are mainly triggered by Suhani's workaholic nature and close relationship with her boss, Venky (Bhatt). Michael tries to help a group of street kids in rescuing a stray dog, only to have his wallet stolen. He later goes into a casino to help a stranger (Khan) win money to pay off his debts. Michael spots Maggie on the top of a building, presumably attempting a suicide, and quickly comes to her rescue. He finds out that she was supposed to leave for Delhi with an agent who had promised to help her become a dancer (unaware of the man's true intentions). Michael, who is enamoured with Maggie's personality and charm tries to cheer her up and the two dance together in the rain. She tells him that she ran away from her house because her mother, despite being a dancer herself, was against her taking up the profession. In return, he tells her about his only dream, which is to be a good son. The two encounter Maggie's uncle, who has found her a job offer. She leaves with him, but gives Michael her phone number asking him to call her later.  Michael gets in an accident with a drunken female driver, Reshma (Dutta), a failed actress and the Don's girlfriend. He offers her a ride home, which she accepts. At her home Reshma explains to him, in drunken stupor, that she suspects the Don of infidelity. The Don arrives at the house to declare his love for Reshma. Michael meanwhile daydreams about Maggie, while playing a guitar in the backyard. The Don invites him to his party, where Michael comes across Sameer and Suhani and everyone else that he had encountered over the night. He also briefly reunites with Maggie, who is there for a performance. She is taken hostage and put into a deep freeze refrigerator, alongside a dead body that Ajay and Vijay had been carrying around all night, as she overhears Mac's plan to assassinate the Don. Unable to bring themselves to terms with killing their boss, Ajay and Vijay free Maggie and later surrenders to the police.  Meanwhile, the Don invites Michael onto the stage for a performance, and the latter obliges. Suhani berates Venky after he tries to seduce her and reconciles with Sameer, who later punches Venky, much to his wife's amusement. Michael sabotages Mac's plan to kill the Don, and ends his performance with a huge applause from the audience. Michael re-unites with Suhani and Sameer. As Michael glances across the crowd, he finds a smiling Maggie walking towards him and smiles back at her.

My Last Day (film)
 [[File:My Last Day screenshot featuring Jesus.png|thumb|alt=A screenshot of the short film featuring Jesus.|A screenshot from the short film featuring ''[[Jesus]]'' in the Temple of Jerusalem]] The film begins with a prisoner watching from the prison bars as Jesus gets flogged in Pilate’s courtyard. He remembers Jesus teaching and wonders why they’re hurting an innocent man. Horrified, he remembers his own crime: He’s in an alley with a rich gentleman. Holding him up with a knife, he tries to take a box of coins and belongings. The thief is nervous so when he tries to go after the man, he fumbles. The man fights him with the box. Coins go flying. The thief accidentally stabs the man in the struggle. He claws at the coins and runs off. The flashback ends. He then breaks down in tears, aggrieved at seeing someone innocent suffer an even more brutal punishment as a criminal than himself.  Most people in the crowds in the courtyard scream for Jesus to be crucified. The thief, another man (who is also a thief) and Jesus are loaded with the beams for their crosses and march to Golgotha. As they make their way there, the thief looks curiously to the crowds, some of whom scream that Jesus is innocent.  They finally arrive at Golgotha and nails are driven through their wrists, painfully securing them to the patibulum. Each man is then hung on his cross due to a large, deep square-shaped groove carved into the stipes and their feet are nailed to a wooden sedile. They hang in agony. Like the crowd, the other thief demands that Jesus save Himself and them. But our thief rebukes the statement, claiming that they are receiving the same punishment that Jesus is, even though He has done no wrong. The thief then asks that Jesus remember him when he comes as king. Jesus tells him that today they will be in paradise together. A while later, a dark storm overwhelms the hill and Jesus dies. A Roman soldier then pierces Jesus' side with his spear causing a mixture of blood and water to erupt from the wound.  Afterwards, the thief has his ankles broken and passes away with a gasp. He then sees a whole and undamaged Jesus (who greets him by reciting John 11:25) in a beautiful place which is, just as Jesus promised, paradise.

My Way (2011 film)
 The year is 1928 in [[Names of Seoul#Gyeongseong|Gyeong-seong]] (modern-day [[Seoul]]), Korea. Young Kim Jun-shik (Shin Sang-yeob), his father ([[Chun Ho-jin]]) and sister Eun-soo ([[Lee Yeon-hee]]) work on the farm of the Hasegawa family (Shiro Sano, Kumi Nakamura) in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese-occupied Korea]]. Both Jun-shik and young Tatsuo Hasegawa (Sung Yoo-bin) are interested in running; by the time they are teenagers ([[Do Ji-han]], Yukichi Kobayashi), they have become fierce competitors. Tatsuo's grandfather (Isao Natsuyagi) is killed in a bomb attack by a [[Korean independence movement|Korean freedom fighter]], and subsequently a Korean runner, [[Sohn Kee-chung]] (Yoon Hee-won), wins a marathon race against Japanese competitors, further inflaming Korean-Japanese tensions.  In May 1938, Jun-shik ([[Jang Dong-gun]]) is working as a rickshaw runner. Koreans have been banned from taking part in sports events and Tatsuo ([[Joe Odagiri]]), now a fierce Japanese nationalist, has sworn that a Korean will never again win a race. Though he has been accepted by a medical college in [[Berlin]], Tatsuo decides to stay in Korea to run in the All Japan Trials for the marathon. Sohn secretly backs Jun-shik and the latter wins the race, though Tatsuo is awarded the medal when Jun-shik is disqualified for allegedly cheating; a riot by Korean spectators ensues. As punishment, those who started the riot are forcibly drafted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]], including Jun-shik and his friend Lee Jong-dae ([[Kim In-kwon]]), who has a crush on Eun-soo.  In July 1939, they find themselves, along with 100 other Koreans, in the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|battle at Nomonhan]], on the [[Mongolia]]n border, where a Chinese sniper, Shirai ([[Fan Bingbing]]), avenging the deaths of her family at the hands of the Japanese, is captured and tortured. Tatsuo, now a colonel, arrives and takes command, forcing the existing commander (who is far fairer to the Koreans), Takakura (高倉; [[Shingo Tsurumi]]), to commit [[seppuku]]. After refusing to join a suicide squad organized by Tatsuo to fight the Soviets, Jun-shik is imprisoned with Shirai but escapes with her, Jong-dae and two other friends to the [[Khalkhyn Gol|River Khalkhin]]. Jun-shik, seeing the tanks on the horizon, attempts to return to base to warn the Japanese forces. During his return, he is attacked by a Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16 Ishak]], and is saved by Shirai, who dies after shooting down the plane. Jun-shik returns to the base and manages to warn the Japanese forces that a large-scale Soviet tank attack is coming, but Tatsuo refuses to order a retreat. During the one-sided battle, a tank shell explodes near Tatsuo and Jun-shik, knocking them unconscious.  In February 1940, Jun-shik and Tatsuo end up in [[Kungursky District|Kungursk]] [[prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]], north of [[Perm]], in the [[Soviet Union]], where both Koreans and Japanese are incarcerated together. Under the name of Anton, Jong-dae has become a work-unit leader and helps his Korean friends, while abusing the Japanese, though it becomes clear that Jong-dae's ultimate allegiance now lies with the USSR. Jun-shik humiliates Tatsuo in a sanctioned fight to the death, but then Jun-shik suddenly refuses to kill Tatsuo, and both get punished together. Later, a work accident incites a riot, which nearly leads to the execution of Tatsuo and Jun-shik by [[execution by firing squad|firing squad]], when news comes that Germany has declared war on the Soviet Union. The Soviets immediately conscript the POWs, shooting those who refuse or are too slow to don the Red Army uniform. Jong-dae volunteers Jun-shik and Tatsuo — still tied to the stakes — into the Red Army, saving their lives. They all fight in a bloody battle against the German army at [[Dedovsk]] in December 1941. Jong-dae dies while leading the Soviets to battle, but Tatsuo and Jun-shik manage to survive. Jun-shik convinces Tatsuo to don German military apparel taken from bodies and trek over the mountains into German territory. As they travel, it becomes clear that Tatsuo has been injured. They come upon an abandoned town where Jun-shik goes out to find medicine to give to Tatsuo. During his search, Jun-shik is found by German soldiers, who, unable to understand him, capture him. Meanwhile, the dying Tatsuo is found by soldiers searching the house he was placed in.  Three years later, Tatsuo is part of the German Army. He finds himself on the beaches of [[Normandy]], [[France]], just prior to the [[Normandy landings|D-Day Allied invasion]]. As the army fortifies the beaches, Tatsuo sees a man running on the beach. He catches up to him and sees that it is Jun-shik. It is apparent that they have not seen each other since their capture by the Germans. They decide to run away from Normandy to catch a ship in [[Cherbourg]] rumored to safely sail out of theater, and ultimately return home to Korea. As they attempt to leave, the [[Normandy Landings]] begin. Jun-shik and Tatsuo are locked into a machine gun pillbox by a German officer. The two force open the door and emerge to a scene of chaos, with American soldiers overrunning the beach. They run inland, but Jun-shik is wounded by a bomb fragment in the chest, and bleeds profusely. Noticing American paratroopers approaching, a dying Jun-shik forcibly replaces Tatsuo's identification tags with his own; telling Tatsuo that "He is now Jun-shik". Otherwise, since Tatsuo is Japanese and considered a sworn enemy of the Americans, he could be killed on the spot. Soon afterwards, Jun-Shik dies and Tatsuo cries aloud as the Americans close in. Tatsuo is later seen sprinting towards the finish in the 1948 Olympic games as "Jun-Shik Kim", and ends with a flashback of their first encounter back in Gyeong-seong. He then monologues that when he encountered Jun-Shik as a child, he was secretly happy to have found someone who could be his running mate.<ref></ref>

The relationship between the pair is initially tense, but Stéphane eventually warms to France, especially after she proves herself an adept hand at taking care of his son for a month, an extra duty for which she is paid €200 a day. The relationship between France and Stéphane turns amorous on a trip to London to meet with partners of Stéphane’s firm. But the following morning France reveals how she came to his employ: she had lost her job when her shipping company moved many of its jobs to China. Stéphane, recognizing the company’s name, callously admits he was one of the bankers whose shorting of the company’s stock hastened the job losses. Leaving the hotel to play in the park with Stéphane’s son, France then overhears him boasting and laughing about his conquest the previous night. France abducts the boy and returns to Dunkirk, holing up in an auditorium that's hosting a dance performance. Stéphane arrives to see France arrested but the crowd, many of whom are former employees of the shipping company, are made aware of Stéphane’s identity and pursue him onto the beach. The mob gives chase as others form a blockade to prevent the police wagon from taking France away.  
My Perestroika
  There is no single narrator in the film. Instead, the stories are told by five inhabitants of [[Moscow]], four of whom grew up together and were classmates from primary school through high school.  Borya and Lyuba are a married couple and history teachers at a Moscow school. Andrei has thrived in the new Russian capitalism and has just opened a new store of French men’s shirts. Olga, the prettiest girl in the class, is a single mother and works for a company that rents out billiard tables to bars and clubs all over Moscow. Ruslan was a famous Russian punk rock musician who rejects society’s structures.  Some of the topics that come up are conformity and rebellion, the attitudes towards the USSR and its collapse, the benefits and challenges of the transition to contemporary Russia, and the difference between the older and the younger generations.  To tell these stories, Hessman combines first-person recollections, often filmed at the homes of the five protagonists, with home movies from the 1970s and 1980s, canonical Soviet and Russian music, and Soviet archival footage.

Marilyn does not show up to the set following Arthur's departure and she asks Colin to come to Parkside and they talk. The crew becomes captivated by Marilyn when she dances for a scene and Milton pulls Colin aside to tell him Marilyn breaks hearts and that she will break his too.

The following night, Marilyn wakes up in pain and claims she is having a miscarriage. A doctor tends to her and Marilyn tells Colin that Arthur is coming back and she wants to try and be a good wife to him, so she and Colin should forget everything that happened between them. She later returns to the set to complete the film. Olivier praises Marilyn, but reveals she has killed his desire to direct again. Lucy asks Colin if Marilyn broke his heart and he replies that she did "a little", to which she replies that he needed it.

François is more of a reserved person and procrastinates on a construction project. The situation gets stirred up when Adrien's friend Patrick, who is Tony's father, enters the picture.

One day, his dad finds about this and asks the president to warn Malar. The president goes to her house and threatens Malar and her mother to see a bride groom for Malar quickly.

Just then, the snake comes and chases them. At the time, the villagers find out their escape and search for them around the village. When the snake was about to kill Velu, the sun rises, marking the end of the 40th day, thus the snake goes away. But the president and his henchmen find out Malar and try to kill her.

No Rest for the Wicked (film)
 Santos Trinidad, a [[Police corruption|corrupt policeman]] and disgraced former [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|SWAT]] member, goes [[binge drinking]] late at night.  He is thrown out of a bar and aggressively demands a drink from a waitress in another bar despite the fact that they are closed.  The manager attempts to defuse the situation by offering Trinidad a free drink, but his physical proximity is deemed too invasive by Trinidad, whose training and instincts suddenly rouse him from his drunken stupor; he breaks the manager's nose, the bouncer draws a pistol, and Trinidad shoots each of them dead.  As Trinidad cleans up the evidence, an eyewitness escapes.  After Trinidad studies their wallets for clues on the identity of the eyewitness, he destroys all identifying papers.  Chacón and Leiva investigate the crime.  Without any way to identify the victims, their investigation proceeds slowly, though they initially suspect a gangland hit.  After using the police's resources to identify the witness' license plates, Trinidad searches his apartment and car.  Trinidad takes the man's GPS device, which he uses to identify common locations.  Though he attempts to disguise himself, he is caught on a surveillance camera.  Trinidad later tracks the man down and pursues him to the subway, where he attempts to kill him, only to be stabbed by an accomplice that the witness calls.  Trinidad and Chacón separately come to realize that the murder victims had ties to the Colombian drug cartels.  Each seek out Rachid, a police informer who was previously involved with the same groups.  Chacón, through her contacts with anti-terrorism intelligence, finds him first.  Rachid tells her that his former acquaintances move from drugs to Islamic militancy, though he lost track of where they were based.  Chacón questions Trinidad after seeing his egress from the apartment on the apartment complex's surveillance camera, but without any solid evidence she is forced to let him go free.  By threatening Rachid's ex-girlfriend, Trinidad tracks down Rachid, whom he also threatens.  Rachid takes Trinidad through Madrid, where they attempt to track down the Islamic terrorist cell to which the witness belongs.  Meanwhile, the cell purchases and sets a series of bombs in a Madrid shopping mall hidden as fire extinguishers.  Trinidad arrives at their headquarters while they place the bombs.  Trinidad kills all of the terrorists, including the witness, before they can remotely detonate the bombs.  However, he is again stabbed, this time fatally.

Night of the Living Carrots
 In a theater, B.O.B. ([[Seth Rogen]]) introduces the story parodying typical horror films, with a recap of the events of "Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space", and tells the audience to be prepared for a story guaranteed to give them nightmares.  The scene then shifts to the twist ending of the previous special. The Zombie Carrot charges at the camera, but is stopped by a gate slamming into it. Carl Murphy ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) announces to the children of the Modesto suburbs that a costume contest was starting and the winner would get their weight in candy. B.O.B., dressed as a [[pirate]], takes all the candy. Outside, he's frightened by the zombie carrot, but mistakes it for a child in a costume. Believing the carrot would win the costume contest, he throws it inside where it immediately bites Carl, turning him into a zombie.  The guests flee the Murphy house and the carrot is blasted by Dr. Cockroach's ([[Hugh Laurie]]) scanner. Carl snaps out of his zombie state and Doc theorizes that the carrot was contaminated by the mutant pumpkins and the curse could only be lifted by eliminating the infected carrot. However, the remains of the carrot replicate themselves into more zombie carrots, reinfecting Carl. Against Doc's advice, B.O.B. uses the scanner to blast the carrots and before long, B.O.B., Doc and Missing Link ([[Will Arnett]]) are completely surrounded.  General Monger ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) arrives but he falls victim to the zombie carrots. Doc, Link and B.O.B. retreat inside the house to create a barricade. B.O.B.'s bungling leads to Link getting infected and both Doc and B.O.B. retreat to Susan's old room, where a stray zombie carrot seemingly infects B.O.B.; this appears to have no effect however and Doc realizes that B.O.B. is immune because he has no brain. Doc theorizes that the only way to save the day is that B.O.B. must eat all the carrots.  B.O.B. has a flashback revealing a fear of carrots; when he was young, he was force-fed carrot puree by General Monger. B.O.B. is unwilling to eat the carrots and escapes through the window to the roof, but when he sees his zombified friends, he decides to eat the zombie carrots.  B.O.B. eats every zombie carrot, rendering him obese. He is about to eat a "Nutty Buddy Butter Bar" for dessert when he sees his friends are still zombies. The original zombie carrot appears and B.O.B. is unable to pursue due to his weight. The carrot opens the bar, causing B.O.B. to chase it down and eat it whole as a chocolate-covered carrot. Link, Monger and Doc snap out of their zombie-like states and hug B.O.B. causing him to burp out an orange cloud.  Back in the theater, B.O.B. reminds the audience "to eat your veggies, or they just might eat you", but his shadow morphs into a zombie carrot as he leaves.

Adam's father Alvin ([[Kevin Kline]]), the well-known star of a former hit television comedy series, has begun a romance with Adam's ex-girlfriend, Vanessa ([[Ophelia Lovibond]]). Adam finds out, gets drunk and calls the women in his phone seeking a hookup. The next morning, he wakes on a sofa wearing nothing but a small towel. It turns out that he texted Emma and then came to the apartment she shares with some other residents—Patrice ([[Greta Gerwig]]), Shira ([[Mindy Kaling]]), and Guy ([[Guy Branum]]). Once there, he took off all his clothes and then passed out. Emma leads Adam to her bedroom to retrieve his missing pants and they end up having sex.  The two have sex again at Adam’s house and before she leaves Adam agrees to her proposal for a casual relationship (as she puts it, using each other for the dirty and nothing else). Adam warns Emma about falling in love with him, but she dismisses the idea and sets ground rules to keep what they’re doing from becoming too serious. At first things go well, but Adam becomes jealous when Sam ([[Ben Lawson]])—another resident—seeks her attention. Adam brings Emma a gift (a mix CD) and she rebuffs him, saying they should stop for a while and hook up with other people. But after being apart for two weeks Emma returns to Adam and they continue being sex friends only.  Adam's birthday comes along a few months later. He goes out for dinner with Alvin and Vanessa, who announce their plan to have a baby together. Emma berates the other couple while defending Adam. He persuades her to go out together on [[Valentine's Day]]. Things fall apart when she becomes too uncomfortable during the date. An angry Emma advises Adam that he should find someone else who won’t hurt him. Adam tells Emma that he loves her—something she's not at all receptive to hearing—they have a fight, ending their arrangement.  Six weeks later, a script Adam wrote is being filmed. He gets a regular writing job on the show with the help of Lucy ([[Lake Bell]]), the show's assistant director, who is clearly attracted to Adam. Meanwhile, Emma is depressed over not being with Adam. The situation is compounded and complicated by her younger sister Katie's ([[Olivia Thirlby]]) wedding the next day and her widowed mother ([[Talia Balsam]]) arriving for the event with a male companion (Brian Dierker) of her own. Emma feels she is being strong for her mom by not letting herself get too close to anyone so she won't become upset by seeing Emma get hurt if a relationship ends poorly. Emma's mom tells her to stop.  When Emma confesses that she can't stop thinking about Adam, Katie insists that she call him to put things right. A nervous Emma phones Adam and tells him that she misses him. He responds that they were never really together. Realizing that she needs to speak with him in person, Emma leaves [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] where the wedding is taking place and drives to Adam's house. Her plans are ruined – and she has to hide to avoid being seen—when he arrives home with Lucy. Emma assumes Adam has a new girlfriend and tearfully drives away. Vanessa calls Adam before he and Lucy can have sex—Alvin has overdosed on a cough syrup-based drink called "[[Purple drank]]". Meeting Adam outside the hospital, Vanessa says that she is ending her relationship with Alvin and leaves for a party. Adam goes in to visit Alvin who surprisingly gives him some tender advice about falling in love.  Shira tells Emma about Adam's dad being admitted to the hospital. As Adam leaves the building he calls Emma and tells her that she must be present if she is going to say that she misses him. Emma gets out of her car as the call ends and Adam is stunned to suddenly find her there. She tells Adam that she is sorry she hurt him and confesses that she really loves and cares about him and they reconcile. After eating breakfast together the next morning—something that never happened before—they arrive in Santa Barbara just before Katie's wedding is starting. As they enter a room and pause Emma asks Adam what will happen next, and with a smile on his lips he silently intertwines her hand with his—for the first time they are holding hands together as a couple.  The end credits show an epilogue in which Alvin and Lucy are in a relationship, and are in a restaurant waiting for Adam to arrive to tell him.

Nostalgia for the Light
 Nostalgia for the Light opens with a view of a telescope and images of our moon. The narrator, Patricio Guzmán, describes how he came to love astronomy and begins to remember his childhood during which “only the present moment existed.” Soon, Chile became the center of the world as astronomers and scientists flocked to Chile to observe the universe through the thin and clear skies. We next see Guzmán walking in the [[Atacama Desert]], a place with absolutely no moisture, so much so that it resembles the surface of [[Mars]]. This desert, and its abundance of history, becomes the focus of the documentary. Because of how dry it is, the desert hosts the untouched remains of fish, mollusks, Indian carvings, and even mummified humans.  Astronomer Gaspar Galaz is introduced and comments on how astronomy is a way to look into the past to understand our origins. It is generally a science seeking answers, but, in the process, creates more questions to answer. He comments that science in general, like astronomy and geology, is a look into the past; even sitting there having this interview, he comments, is a conversation in the past because of the millionths of a second light takes to travel and be processed. Lautaro Núñez relates astronomer’s endeavors to his own; archeologists and astronomers have to recreate the past while in the present by using only a few traces.  The documentary then shifts into Chile’s recent past dealing with Pinochet and his dictatorship. Luís Henríquez, a survivor from the [[Chacabuco]] concentration camp, describes how a group of about 20, led by a Doctor Alvarez (who was knowledgeable in astronomy), was taught theory during the day and learned how to identify constellations at night. They learned how to create a device that let them track the constellations, and while they studied the cosmos they “all had a feeling of great freedom,”<ref name=notl></ref> as Henríquez describes it. The military, however, quickly banned these lessons because they believed the prisoners could escape using the constellations. Miguel Lawner, similarly, was a prisoner who survived the concentration camp. He is referred to as the “architect” in the movie because he was able to memorize and then later recreate the environment the prisoners lived in. Miguel would measure buildings and the grounds with footsteps and would then draw a scaled version of the concentration camps with those measurements. He would rip his drawings up and hide them at night, in case of a raid, and then flush them down the latrines in the morning. The narrator concludes that he and his wife Anita are a metaphor for Chile: Henríquez remembers what happened in the past, while Anita, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]], is forgetting.  Valentina Rodríguez talks about how her grandparents were detained and threatened to give up the location of her parents. After threatening to hurt Valentina, her grandparents complied and her parents were taken away. This idea leaves her strong and optimistic. Guzmán ends the documentary affirming the value of memory because, as he states, “those who have a memory are able to live in the fragile present moments. Those who have none don’t live anywhere.”<ref name=notl />

Having long wanted Zoltan for himself, even before he fell in love with Gino, a distraught Pim runs off into the night. Devastated that he cannot be with Zoltan, He returns home to find his mother has left with Zoltan and left him a note.  Pim takes Mirza and moves in with Sabrina, while Gino is living out of town with Françoise.  Following the funeral of Gino and Sabrina's mother Marcella, Pim and Sabrina are seen living together, although the living arrangement is clearly platonic. On a rainy day, Gino returns. After Pim tells Gino that his sister isn't home, Gino tells Pim that it was he who Gino came home for. Gino gently grabs Pim and moves him against the wall. Gino returns a cloth with special meaning to them both to Pim, telling him to tie a knot in it so that he will never forget him. He then proceeds to kiss Pim on the neck and the two embrace one another passionately. Pim tells Gino to "stay," and the film ends with the two of them embracing each other, suggesting a happy ending for the young couple.

Notre Paradis
  Vassili is an aging [[Paris]] [[Male prostitution|hustler]] who has a hard time accepting he is growing too old for his profession. He lashes out by strangling one of his clients who had commented on his age. Later that night he finds an unconscious teenager in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] (a [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] park) who was apparently also hustling and has been beaten and robbed.

Old Dog (2011 film)
 In the late 1990s, somewhere in [[China]]'s [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], a motorcycle-riding Tibetan named Gonpo sells his father's prized Tibetan mastiff to a dog dealer without his father's permission. Mastiffs are in demand by Chinese businessmen, and they are becoming rare. When his father finds out, he immediately goes to the dog dealer to return the money and retrieve his dog. At first, the dealer refuses but eventually agrees when police officer Dorje (who happens to be the old man's son-in-law) explains the nature of the family conflict. The old man states that the dog has been a good animal in herding the family's sheep. Since the dog has been in his care for 13 years, he wants to ensure a good life for the animal.  After recovering his mastiff, the old sheep herder joins Dorje for a tea and meat snack at a local eatery. Eventually the topic of conversation evolves around the police officer's young son who just turned 3. At that point, the old man states that the sooner one has children, the sooner one is happy, and there is nothing else like it. He then asks Dorje for advice about Gonpo, his hooligan son who tried to sell the dog. Gonpo and his wife Rikso have been together for 3 years without having children. Concerned, the old man asks where in the city can Gonpo and Rikso get help for this, and Dorje suggests they go to the city hospital.  With some hesitation in obeying his father, Dorje agrees to go to the hospital with Rikso but upon arriving, he changes his mind in accompanying Rikso and asks her to get her sister instead. After the appointment, Gonpo is informed that there is no problem in Rikso that prevents her from having children. There is a meaningful pause as Gonpo quietly absorbs this news.  In the middle of the night, a scuffle is heard around the house, and noises indicate an attempted theft of the mastiff. Thinking of what is best for the animal, the old man decides to release him to the mountains in the hope that he can live the rest of his life in freedom. Unfortunately, the old dog is captured by the same dealer from before, and news of this reaches the old man to his chagrin. The surprise comes when the old man learns that Gonpo is in jail for going to the dealer and punching him out in order to retrieve the dog. Dorje eventually returns the dog to his owner.  At the jail, the old man visits with Gonpo and shares a cigarette with him. The two men share a quiet moment during which time Gonpo reveals that Rikso had gone to the hospital and was determined to have no problems in conceiving children. Tenderly, the old man offers to bring Gonpo a beer (secretly) while he serves his time in jail.  While tending his sheep with his faithful mastiff and gazing upon a scenic landscape of Tibetan mountains and tundra, the old man is badgered by 2 men who offer to buy the dog. Exasperated, the old man repeats several times that he is not interested in selling, and eventually the men leave him alone. In the final poignant scenes, the old man decides to end his dog's life by strangling him on his chain, and in minutes his mastiff is dead. Slowly and with a heaviness in his step, the old man walks away (from the camera). The end.  
Once Upon a Time in Anatolia
 Through the night, three cars carry a small group of menpolice officers, a doctor, a prosecutor, grave diggers, gendarmerie forces, and two brothers, homicide suspectsaround in the rural surroundings of the Anatolian town [[Keskin]], in search of a buried body. Kenan, one of the suspects, leads them from one water fountain to another; at the time of the crime he was drunk and he cannot recall where he and his mentally challenged brother buried the body. The darkness and visual indistinctness of the landscape do not help; each spot looks the same as the others.  Meanwhile, the men discuss a variety of topics, such as yoghurt, lamb chops, urination, family, spouses, ex-wives, death, suicide, hierarchy, bureaucracy, ethics, and their jobs. Philosophy is also discussed, with one apparently central and particular idea/theme mentioned a couple of times throughout the film—the idea that children invariably pay for their parents' mistakes.  After many stops the prosecutor begins to tell the doctor about a particularly mysterious death where a woman correctly predicted to her husband the exact date of her own death, which was a short time after she had given birth to a child. The story is interrupted when the prosecutor sees some of his men lashing out at Kenan after discovering that once again they are in the wrong spot. As the group discusses what to do next, Kenan asks the doctor for a cigarette which he tries to give him. Commisar Naci stops him however and tells Kenan that he can have a cigarette when he earns it.  The group stops at a nearby village to eat at the home of the town mayor. The mayor pleads with the prosecutor to speak to the authorities of his town to help provide funds to build a morgue where bodies can be prepared. When some of the men suggest that he simply bury the bodies quickly the man informs them that emigration means that only old people are left in the town and when their children learn of their deaths they beg him not to bury the bodies immediately so that they may come back and see their parents one last time.  The wind causes a power outage during which the mayor's young daughter brings the men tea on a tray, with a lamp on the tray lighting her face. Several of the men are struck by her beauty. After seeing her Kenan begins to cry.  While waiting for the light to come back on the doctor asks about the cause of death of the woman who predicted her own death. and the prosecutor says it was natural, a heart attack. The doctor then asks whether an autopsy was performed, and the prosecutor replies that there was no need as the cause of death was obvious and unsuspicious. The doctor suggests that it may have been a self-induced heart attack with the use of drugs and therefore a suicide.  Meanwhile, Kenan reveals what happened the night of the killingwhile drunk he let slip the secret that the victim's son was actually his, and then things got ugly. After confessing to the comissar he is given a cigarette.  Daylight breaks. Kenan finally takes them to the correct location where the group is able to unearth the body which they discover to their horror has been hogtied. Needing to take the body to the hospital to be autopsied they realize that they do not have a body bag and that the body, now untied, had been tied by Kenan in order to make it fit in the trunk of his car. After contemplating whether to tie the body up again they succeed in making it fit by bending the corpse.  The mother and son (perhaps 12 years old) are waiting outside the hospital. The son throws a stone at Kenan hitting him between the eyes. Kenan cries.  At the hospital the prosecutor again discusses the woman who predicted her own death with the doctor. They further discuss the possibility of suicide, where it is established that a certain prescription drug could have been used to induce the heart attack. The prosecutor is familiar with the drug as his father-in-law took it for his heart problems. Possible reasons for suicide are also discussed, and the two come to a possible motive—her husband's confirmed infidelity. At the end of the discussion the prosecutor's behavior suggests that the woman may have been his own wife.  The prosecutor invites the victim's wife to identify the body in the hospital morgue, files the necessary paperwork, and departs, leaving the doctor to perform the autopsy. The autopsy reveals the presence of soil in the lungs, implying that the victim had been buried alive, but the doctor intentionally omits that from the report.  The movie ends with a shot from the doctor's perspective of the mother and son in the distance walking away with the husband's belongings. The son sees that a soccer ball has been accidentally kicked far from a schoolyard and he runs and retrieves it and kicks it back to the children in the yard. He then runs back to his mother.

One Day (2011 film)
  The film opens with a short scene from the "current" day in 2006, which appears later on, before going back 18 years.  Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley meet on 14 July 1988 after their graduation from the [[University of Edinburgh]]. They spend the night together but agree to be just friends, and plan to spend the following day together, the 15th, St. [[Swithun]]'s day. The film chronologically reconnects Dexter, Emma or both of them on that one day over the next 18 years after they go their separate ways.  One year later in 1989, Dexter helps Emma move into a flat in London where she plans to pursue a career as a writer. However, after little success, she ends up working as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant by 1990, and meets Ian, an aspiring comedian who is hired soon after. Dexter is travelling the world while drinking and having sex promiscuously with a succession of girlfriends, but they keep in contact via phonecalls and letters. He then visits Emma on 15 July 1991 and, to get her out of her rut, suggests they go away for the weekend. They flirt back and forth and it's made clear that Emma may have deeper feelings for him, but since she knows that Dexter is not boyfriend material, nothing comes of it and two more years fly by. Dexter is now a wealthy and successful television presenter on a raucous late-night television show, where he meets Suki, who later becomes his new girlfriend.  Dexter visits his parents on 15 July 1994 after his mother has been diagnosed with cancer and is terminally ill. He arrives at the family home still under the influence of drugs and alcohol from heavy partying the night before, which his father notices and is furious about, telling Dexter he will ban him from visiting again if he keeps it up. Also, his mother appears very unimpressed with the nature of his television show and reveals that she no longer believes he is a nice man. On the same day, Emma goes out on a date with Ian. Although there appears to be no romantic spark between them, she knows he means well and so they continue to date anyway.  By 1995, Emma is now a school teacher and has moved in with Ian. However, she grows more and more irritated with him because of his lack of ambition and failure to contribute to maintaining their household. Dexter is the presenter of another television show, which isn't doing so well, making him "the most annoying man on telly". On 15 July 1996, he and Emma meet for dinner. He turns up high on [[cocaine]], leaves the table every ten minutes, flirts with another woman down the hall, and insults Emma. She storms off and, out in the street, decides that they must break off their friendship due to them outgrowing each other. She tells him that although she loves him, she no longer likes him anymore.  Two years later, Dexter's television career has gone into a steep decline because he is 32 years old and television executives prefer presenters in their early 20s. Meanwhile, Emma and Ian have split up and she becomes a published author of children's books. By 1999, Dexter is in a long-term relationship with Sylvie. On 15 July 2000, Emma's former university roommate and Dexter's old best friend get married, and both Emma and Dexter are invited to the wedding. There, Dexter receives a job offer from Calum, his old roommate who has since become a multimillionaire from owning a chain of [[organic food]] restaurants. Dexter and Emma leave the party to talk on the rooftop, where he tells her about Sylvie, who is now his fiancée, and is on his way to becoming a father. Emma tries to hide the fact that she is upset and they share a very brief but meaningful kiss.  By 2001, Dexter is a father but later learns that Sylvie is having an affair with Calum and they divorce. Two years pass and Emma has moved to Paris, where Dexter visits her on 15 July in the hope that they will get together again, this time for good. It is revealed that they had a one-night stand after his marriage to Sylvie broke down. However, Emma reveals that she has a new boyfriend (Sébastien Dupuis), a French musician who plays piano in a jazz band. Smitten with Emma but taken aback by the revelation that she has moved on, Dexter decides to leave. Suddenly, she has second thoughts and chases after him, exclaiming that she thought she had gotten rid of him. He promises to never hurt, lie to or cheat on her, and they share a passionate kiss and finally start a full relationship together.  Emma and Dexter become engaged in 2004 and eventually marry. Parlaying his restaurant experience into a new career, Dexter opens his own cafe in England, which proves to be very lucrative, and he and Emma start trying to have their own baby. However, they are unsuccessful and become frustrated with one another. On 15 July 2006 (the scene from the very beginning of the movie), Emma is hit by a truck while riding her bicycle out of a blind alley, and she dies. Dexter becomes inconsolable and self-destructive, and is particularly desolate each year on their day. Over the years, he gets support from his ex-wife, their daughter Jasmine, his widowed father, and even Ian, who also mourns Emma every year. Ian has since married and had children, but he visits Dexter and tells him that Emma was never the same with him as she was with Dexter, that she "lit up" whenever Dexter was around, and that "she made you decent and you made her so happy".  On 15 July 2011, Dexter visits [[Arthur's Seat]] in [[Scotland]] with Jasmine. The movie flashbacks to 1988 when they met and reveals they spent their day together at the same place. At the top, Dexter and Emma promise to always be best friends.

This all changes, however, when prodigal 24-year-old daughter, Nina Ostroff, (Meester), returns from a 5 year absence after her fiance, Ethan, disliked by her parents, dumped her.   Nina and Vanessa had been childhood best friends before Nina moved on to new friends during high school, and Vanessa is unhappy to see her back. However, both sets of families (at least the mothers) would like to see newly-single Nina and jet-setting son Toby Walling (Brody) form a relationship, and Cathy is excited when the Toby and Nina go to the basement together after their [[Thanksgiving]] meal. Despite flirtatious back-and-forth, Toby falls asleep after drinking, leaving Nina alone in the house. She goes to find David in the pool house where he said he was watching "late night TV", and they sit together briefly, watching a Korean [[basketball]] game. There is a chemistry between them, and they share a kiss before David pulls away.  The next day, Toby goes to the Ostroff house to drop off a sweater Nina left behind the night before. Cathy is keen to hear what went on, but Nina is less inclined to gossip.  Toby invites her to dinner at the Walling house that night in order to spend more time with her. After playing a family board game, David says he'll go out and get a movie, and Nina offers to join him, and whilst driving to collect the movie, and having just stated that "last night was a mistake", they kiss again.   No one is aware of the budding relationship between David and Nina until Cathy follows Nina to a [[motel]] after she said she was going out with Toby, whom Cathy discovers had already left for [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]] that morning. Cathy finds Nina at the motel, and literally bumps into David as he's bringing ice to the room. She puts the pieces together and deduces that David and Nina are at the motel together.  Then, the meltdown of both families begins. Vanessa witnesses the resulting fight between her parents who have slept in separate bedrooms for years, pretending to be happy.  Paige moves out to the only [[Bed and breakfast|B & B]] in town, leaving David to wallow. The relationship between David and Terry is strained and they don't take their usual morning jogs together. The relationship between David and Vanessa is strained too. David and Nina don't see each other until they meet for coffee some weeks later. Nina still has feelings for David and asks him if he is happy. Then, she asks him that if there were no rules, would he lean across the table and kiss her, and he says yes. They leave the cafe and get into David's car, saying they have 51 hours before he has to be back at work, and they head off to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic city]], where they gamble, go to the beach and have an awkward encounter with one of David's colleague and his wife. They discover that their relationship is real, and they truly have feelings for each other.  When they get back from Atlantic city, they gather all members of both families (minus Toby, who is in China) in the lounge and announce that they are in a relationship. This causes conflict between all parties, especially Vanessa, who asks her father "if you had to fuck someone half your age, why did it have to be her?". Nina moves in with high school friend Meredith. Upon finding Nina's bag in her house, Vanessa takes it and is seen walking towards a garbage truck when Nina pulls up in her car, demanding to know what Vanessa is doing with her bag. The two struggle over the bag, resulting in Vanessa getting a head injury and being treated by Terry, who has a heart-to-heart with her about the situation.  A few days before Christmas eve, Ethan shows up outside David's house, begging Nina to take him back. He first goes to the Ostroff's house across the street where Cathy gives him a set of keys. He lets himself in David's house and hears Nina telling David that she loves him. After asking Ethan to leave multiple times, David forcefully removes him and throws him on the lawn. Toby arrives home for Christmas from China.   Ethan stays outside David's house until Christmas eve, when Paige shows up in her car. They briefly talk before Paige drives her car into the Christmas ornaments in David's front yard after noticing her former caroling group. When David comes out to stop her, she chases him in her car knocking down the ornaments. Everyone runs into David's house. Toby, still shocked about the news, gives everyone gifts from China.  David makes a short speech that Paige finishes. Vanessa breaks down crying. Nina apologizes to Paige who reacts violently.    Later that evening, David finds Nina upset, and they talk about running away to Mexico, but Nina asks "but what then, David?" to which he has no reply. Vanessa narrates, explaining that Nina broke up with everyone that night. She is seen talking to a put-out Ethan after leaving David in the house. Next, Vanessa is seen moving into a tiny apartment in [[Manhattan]], her dream since she was young. She continues and says that Nina traveled around [[Europe]] before getting a job as a chef in [[Rome]], and a 'Greetings from Rome' postcard is shown on Cathy's fridge. Vanessa explains that what happened at Christmastime was important for everyone.  
OOO, Den-O, All Riders: Let's Go Kamen Riders
 On April 1, 2011, [[Kamen Rider OOO (character)|Kamen Rider OOO]] finds himself battling three [[Imagin#Mole|Mole Imagin]], unaware they are Imagin until [[List of Kamen Rider OOO characters#Ankh|Ankh]] arrives to confirm that the monsters are not Yummies. The three Imagin see a boy and jump into him to escape into time before the [[Kamen Rider Den-O (character)#DenLiner|DenLiner]] suddenly appears. [[Kamen Rider New Den-O|Kotaro Nogami]] and [[Imagin#Teddy|Teddy]] emerge from the train to pinpoint the Mole Imagin's destination to be November 11, 1971, confused on how the boy's memories exceed that far in time. When Ankh demands answers, Teddy explains who he and Eiji Hino are to Kotaro, who then introduces himself while explaining their mission to deal with the rogue Imagin who would disrupt the flow of time. Ankh has Eiji join him in getting on the DenLiner as it goes back in time, warned by [[List of Kamen Rider Den-O characters#Owner|the DenLiner's Owner]] to stay on the train so not to disrupt time.   Once at 1971, as Kamen Rider New Den-O eliminates two of the Mole Imagin with the third one still on the run, Ankh manages to leave Shingo's body to get out of the DenLiner to enact his plan to steal the Core Medals from the other [[List of Kamen Rider OOO characters#Greeed|Greeed]] while they are still sealed. Realizing this, Eiji goes after Ankh before they run into the Mole Imagin as New Den-O destroys him. The Taros manage in capturing Ankh before taking him and Eiji back to the present. However, as the DenLiner departs, it turned out that one of Ankh's Cell Medals was dislodged from the Mole Imagin's death and was found by a Shocker Combatman as he presents it to General Black.  The DenLiner arrives in the present to drop Eiji and Ankh off, with the latter feeling that something is off. The two then meet the boy from before, Naoki, as he and his friend, Mitsuru, tried to steal Eiji's underwear. Though Ankh saw through it, he realized they stole his O-Medal Case and chases the boys down to the slums where the case is passed on to other children. The chase is disrupted by the police, who reveal themselves as members of [[Kamen Rider#Shocker|Shocker]] as they try to arrest Eiji and Ankh. After escaping from the police and meeting at the Snack Amigo, where the Cous Coussier is supposed to be, Eiji finds the kids from before. Confused about this "Shocker" group everyone mentions, Ankh arrives and explains to Eiji that he researched Shocker and learned that they are a terrorist organization who managed to gain control over Japan. Soon after, as Ankh holds one of the kids hostage to get the Core Medals back while Eiji manages to calm everyone down before, an announcement starts that Shocker has been inducted into the [[United Nations]] and has incorporated the various organizations ([[Kamen Rider X#G.O.D.|G.O.D.]], [[Kamen Rider Amazon#Geddon|Geddon]], [[Kamen Rider Stronger#Delza Army|the Delza Army]], [[List of Kamen Rider Black characters#Gorgom|Gorgom]], [[List of Kamen Rider Black characters#Crisis Empire|the Crisis Empire]], and [[List of Kamen Rider W characters#Sonozaki Family|the Museum]]) to begin their world domination plan and mass extermination of all remaining normal humans.  When the Shocker Police arrive, Eiji, Ankh and the children run for it before Shigeru is held hostage. With Mitsuru and Naoki abandoning Shigeru as their only choice, Eiji refuses to leave the boy to die as he becomes Kamen Rider OOO to battle the monsters and cover the boys' escape. However, Shocker's elite soldiers, Kamen Riders [[Kamen Rider 1|1]] and [[Kamen Rider 2|2]], arrive and proceed to beat him. Though Mitsuru is reluctant, the boys give Kamen Rider OOO back the Medal Case. Kamen Rider OOO changes into Latorartar Combo to blind them so he can rush the children to safety. However, they are ambushed by [[Kamen Rider Stronger#Delza Army|General Shadow]] as he proceeds to defeat Kamen Rider OOO. Fortunately, the DenLiner arrives and picks Eiji and the children. Eiji learns from Teddy that Shocker found a Core Medal in 1971 and modified it for their use. Though the created Shocker Medal was powerless on its own, the Cell Medal Ankh left behind enabled Shocker to create the Shocker Greeed, which swiftly defeated the first Kamen Riders so they would become Shocker members as originally intended. This act in turn negates the existence of all Kamen Riders after the first Kamen Riders and allowed Shocker to continue its evil. Though Eiji offers to help, Kotaro tells him that he will correct the timeline, leaving him and Shigeru in the slums where they meet the [[List of Kamen Rider OOO characters#Hina Izumi|Hina Izumi]] of this timeline. Finding Mitsuru and Naoki still on the train, the gang finds Ankh as well, putting a lease on him so [[Imagin#Momotaros|Momotaros]] would make sure the Greeed would not mess up time any further.  Arriving one minute before their previous arrival, hiding until the events unfold, Kotaro recovers the Cell Medal. However, upon attempting to reclaim his Cell Medal, Ankh to causes four Cell Medals to fly out the window with the everyone jumping out. Though Urataros, Kintaros, and Ryutaros managed to destroy three, the last one is found by a girl named Nokko, who mistakes Kotaro, Momotaros, Teddy, and Ankh as Shocker agents. She proceeds to her fellow [[Kamen Rider V3|Kamen Rider Scouts]] before the Cell Medal drops from her hands and is picked up by a Shocker Combatman who hands it over to General Black. Refusing to let history repeat itself, Kotaro becomes New Den-O as he and Momotaros battle the Shocker platoon while Mitsuru and Naoki run off with the Kamen Rider Scouts covering them as they and Naoki make it to a warehouse. They are attacked by Shocker's Inhumanoids before Kamen Riders 1 and 2 arrive to cover the kids' escape while they take out the Shocker soldiers. At that time, General Black transforms into the Inhumanoid Hiruchameleon to overpower New Den-O and Momotaros until the first Kamen Riders and the children trick Hiruchameleon into taking a fake Cell Medal with a transmitter so they can locate Shocker's headquarters and take out the organization's leader.   Before they proceed, New Den-O destroys the real Cell Medal to prevent any further trouble. However, once there, the Double Riders, New Den-O, and Momotaros realize that they have fallen into a trap as General Black reveals that the Cell Medal that Kotaro stole was a fake as the Great Leader creates the Shocker Greeed. General Black then calls out Ikadevil, Garagaranda, and other revived kaijin before changing into Hiruchameleon and battling the Riders. As New Den-O and Momotaros have their hands full with the Shocker Greeed, the Double Riders dispose of the revived kaijin and unmask the Great Leader. Outside, Turtle Bazooka fires at the DenLiner, forcing the Owner to order a retreat. The Double Riders tell Kotaro, Momotaros, and the boys to jump onboard while they cover their escape. Still wanting to help the Double Riders, Naoki jumps off the heavily damaged DenLiner with Teddy following him before it heads back in time.  On April 2, 2011, as the damaged DenLiner returns, Shocker initiates its mass extermination as Kamen Rider OOO fights them off before seeing the train. Assuming Tajador Combo, Kamen Rider OOO takes Mitsuru to safety as Kotaro, Momotaros, and Ankh jump out of the train as it explodes. Losing his OOO Driver in the explosion, Eiji realizes that the DenLiner crew have failed in their mission and the train's destruction means the event cannot be undone. Soon after, Eiji and Kotaro are captured as Ankh and Momotaros (reduced to a floating left arm) cover everyone's escape. Arriving at the kids' spare hideout, the group soon find Teddy in his Macheteddy form as a grave marker along with a time capsule. Other than the Kamen Rider Scouts' uniforms and Core Medals, there is a letter from Naoki which details how he and the Kamen Rider Scouts became fugitives with Teddy sacrificing himself so they would escape. Surrounded by Shocker soldiers, Momotaros takes over Shingo's body and uses the Macheteddy to keep them busy while Hina and the children run off with the OOO Driver. However, M-Ankh is captured as well and is taken with Eiji and Kotaro for public execution.  However, with his group wearing the Kamen Rider Scout uniforms, Shigeru attempts to deliver the OOO Driver back to Eiji. By then, the Double Riders appear and reveal that a Shocker scientist has recently released them from their brainwashing, and they pretended to still be under Shocker's control until they crossed paths with the Shocker Greeed again. This turns into a revolt among the human audience as Eiji, Kotaro, and M-Ankh are freed. Receiving his OOO Driver from a mysterious man in white, Eiji changes into Kamen Rider OOO while Kotaro becomes New Den-O with the Momotaken sword. Though the four Kamen Riders are outnumbered at first, the playing field is changed with the sudden appearance of [[Kamen Rider V3 (character)|Kamen Riders V3]], [[Riderman]], [[Kamen Rider X (character)|X]], [[Kamen Rider Amazon (character)|Amazon]], [[Kamen Rider Stronger (character)|Stronger]], [[Skyrider (Kamen Rider)|Skyrider]], [[Kamen Rider Super-1 (character)|Super-1]], [[Kamen Rider ZX|ZX]], [[Kamen Rider Black (character)|Black]], and [[Kamen Rider Black RX (character)|Black RX]].   General Black demands the meaning of this as the Owner reveals that while the Kamen Riders were erased from time, they cannot be erased from the human heart. Soon, the DenLiner arrives with Kamen Riders [[Kamen Rider Shin|Shin]], [[Kamen Rider ZO|ZO]], [[Kamen Rider J|J]], [[Kamen Rider Kuuga (character)|Kuuga]], [[Kamen Rider Agito (character)|Agito]], [[Kamen Rider Ryuki (character)|Ryuki]], [[Kamen Rider Faiz (character)|Faiz]], [[Kamen Rider Blade (character)|Blade]], [[Kamen Rider Hibiki (character)|Hibiki]], [[Kamen Rider Kabuto (character)|Kabuto]], Kiva, and [[Kamen Rider Decade (character)|Decade]]. As Shotaro and Philip arrive to join the fight as [[Kamen Rider Double (character)|Kamen Rider Double]], Teddy appears with Momotaros tagging him in while becoming [[Kamen Rider Den-O (character)|Kamen Rider Den-O]]. As Den-O assumes Climax Form to take out the grunts, Kamen Rider OOO destroys General Black with the Tatoba Kick. General Shadow attempts to escape, only to be halted by [[Android Kikaider|Kikaider]], [[Kikaider 01]], [[Inazuman]] and [[Kaiketsu Zubat|Zubat]] as the four destroy him.  While the Double Riders destroy the Shocker Greeed, Kamen Rider OOO arrives to the other Kamen Riders' aid as they are unable to attack the Great Leader. However, upon receiving the Shocker Medal from Ankh, who uses Momotaros to create the Imagin Core Medal, Kamen Rider OOO becomes Kamen Rider OOO Tamashii Combo and knocks the Great Leader over a far distance with the Tamashii Bomber. But as King Dark is about to fight the Kamen Riders, the Great Leader assumes his true form as titanic Rock Great Leader, using his power to attack the Kamen Riders while causing a fissure that consumes King Dark and the other surviving villains. The Kamen Riders are joined by [[Kamen Rider Birth]] and all of the extra Riders (except Another Agito, Dark Kiva, Danki, Eiki, Sabaki, Shuki, G, Abyss and every Movie, Special & Stageshow Rider besides those from Ryuki) to battle the new menace, jumping onto their motorcycles to execute the All Rider Break to destroy the Great Leader once and for all. In the end, after the Kamen Riders take their leave, the man in white appears before the group as Mitsuru identifies him as his father. Furthermore, the man is revealed to be Naoki and has lived in the past and married Nokko. He eventually became a Shocker scientist so he could undo the Riders' brainwashing. As the Imagin and Shocker Medals dissolve, much to Ankh's dismay, Eiji bids Kotaro farewell before the DenLiner embarks on its next destination.<ref name="sponichi"/><ref>''Hyper Hobby'', March 2011</ref><ref>''Toei Hero Max'', Vol. 36</ref>

Osthe
  Velan, a young boy, lives with his younger half-brother Balan, stepfather ([[Nassar]]) and mother ([[Revathi]]) in Kattuppakkam in the [[Tirunelveli district]]. His stepfather is always partial towards Balan which constantly angers Velan.  Fifteen years later, a gang of robbers steals money from a bank and causes property damage while entering Kattuppakkam, when Velan ([[Silambarasan Rajendar|Silambarasan]]), now a cop going by the name "Osthe" Velan, apparently tries to recover the money by beating up the robbers. It becomes clear later that he keeps the money for himself, using it to buy new police jeeps and dividing it among his fellow cops ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]], [[Thambi Ramaiah]], [[Mayilsamy]] and [[Vaiyapuri]]). Velan still lives with his family and does not have a good relationship with his stepfather and Balan (whom he bullies at times).  Balan ([[Jithan Ramesh]]) is in love with Nirmala ([[Saranya Mohan]]) whose father ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]) opposes their relationship. Osthe Velan, meanwhile, falls in love with Neduvaali ([[Richa Gangopadhyay]]), whom he chances upon while chasing a gang of thugs.  Boxer Daniel ([[Sonu Sood]]), an aspiring politician and goon, meets Velan and tells him that the people he beat up and stole the money from are party workers and that they were getting money for the party. Velan is unperturbed, and dismisses him flatly. Balan asks his father to arrange his marriage with Nirmala, but his father refuses saying that he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory so he needs his son to marry a rich girl. Balan, in desperate need of money, steals it from Velan's cupboard, but is caught red-handed by his mother. He tells his mother that he intends to give the money to Nirmala's father, who in turn will return the money after marriage through [[dowry]]. Although his mother refuses, he takes the money and gives it to Nirmala's father.  Meanwhile, Velan meets Neduvaali and proposes marriage. She rejects it saying that she has to look after her father ([[VTV Ganesh]]), who is always drunk and that she cannot marry while he is alive. Velan then comes home to find his mother dead. He tries to make peace with his stepfather, as he is the only family left, but his stepfather says that Velan is not part of the family any more.  Velan is then attacked at the railway station by Daniel's men, when he is with Neduvaali and her father, but, he beats up all of them in a fight.  He sees Balan buying a horse and chariot, though he does not suspect that Balan stole the money. Balan tells him that he is getting married to Nirmala and invites Velan to the marriage. Velan tries to convince Neduvaali's father to give his daughter's hand in marriage to him and to stop drinking. Neduvaali's father accepts and after Velan leaves, he plunges into a lake and commits suicide, as he knows that his daughter will not marry anyone while he is alive. Velan takes Neduvaali to Balan's exuberant wedding and, honouring his mother's wish that her elder son be married first, marries Neduvaali in an impromptu ceremony. Nirmala's father feels disgraced and cancels the wedding.  Balan beats up one of the workers in his factory due to a small accident. The worker goes to the police station along with his mother to file a complaint. But instead Velan beats up Balan in public, thus disgracing him. Daniel decides to take advantage of the situation and suspend Velan. He takes Balan and his father to the police station. But Balan's father resolves the situation by accepting an apology from Velan. Velan meets the minister leading Daniel's party ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]) who also dislikes Daniel. They both come to an agreement to keep Daniel in control. Velan adulterates the breweries of Daniel due to which many people fall ill and Daniel is blamed. Daniel is confronted by Velan who openly reveals to him that he adulterated the breweries.  To take revenge, Daniel burns Balan's factory. Balan's father gets a heart attack due to shock and is hospitalised. Balan, in desperate need of money for his father's treatment agrees to do anything for Daniel, without realising that it was Daniel who burnt his factory. Daniel gives him a task telling him to deliver a crate of mangoes to the minister' house. But, unknown to Balan, there is a bomb in it. After he leaves the house, it explodes, killing the minister and many innocents. Daniel gives Balan a task to kill Velan. Balan, knowing that he would not do it, accepts it and meets Velan. He confesses to Velan that he was sent to kill him by Daniel. He reveals to Velan that Daniel made him plant the bomb unknowingly. Velan forgives him and reconciles with his stepfather.  Balan meets Daniel, who thinks that Balan killed Velan and reveals to Balan that he had killed Balan's mother. Daniel is then informed that Velan is arriving with a huge police force. Balan reveals to Daniel that he did not kill Velan. In a final battle, Velan arrives and takes down all the goons and rescues Balan, leading to a final fight with Daniel. After Balan reveals to Velan that Daniel killed their mother, the two kill Daniel by forcing smoke into his mouth.  In a happy ending, Velan gets Balan married to Nirmala in the presence of their father.

On 30 August, he is given a day's leave to attend a job interview in the city centre. He goes to visit his friend Thomas and his wife Rebecca and their two children. While there he admits that after meeting his old girlfriend Malin he felt nothing which Thomas tries to play off. Anders slowly reveals to him that he is having suicidal thoughts. At 34 years of age, he feels he is too old to start over and is unenthused about the interview as an editorial assistant that he is applying for. He sees Thomas as being happy, but Thomas talks about his own difficulties in life including being too tired to maintain passion with his wife, having limited time to focus on his career, and the lack of true friendships as he gets older. The two part on good terms and Thomas begs Anders not to do anything terrible but not before inviting him to a party held by their mutual friend Mirjam.   Anders goes to his job interview, but beforehand calls the girlfriend he was dating while he was on drugs, Iselin, and getting her voicemail, begs her to call him back.  At the job interview when he is asked about the gaps in his resume, Anders admits to being a former drug addict causing the interviewer to grow uncomfortable. Anders abruptly ends the interview taking his application with him and throwing it out.    Following his interview, Anders has plans to meet with his sister, Nina, but is surprised and angry when Nina's girlfriend Tove shows up instead, eventually admitting that Nina does not want to see him and finds it difficult he is being let out of rehab. Tove is supposed to go with Anders to the family home, which is being sold to pay for his rehab, but Anders refuses to let her accompany him and takes the keys and leaves alone instead.    Anders goes to Mirjam's party hoping to meet Thomas. Instead he runs into old friends unaware of his recent sobriety, and quickly breaks it by drinking at the party. The party is Mirjam's birthday and they eventually have a conversation about how difficult Mirjam finds ageing as all her female friends have children and her male friends are dating increasingly younger women. To comfort her Anders gives her a lingering kiss, which makes things awkward between them. Anders retreats to a room alone and again calls Iselin leaving a message on her voicemail wondering if she still loves him and hinting that he would like to get back together with her. He then rifles through the coats and purses of the party-goers, stealing money and abruptly leaving when he is caught by Mirjam.     Anders heads to his old drug dealer's place where he buys a gram of heroin. He then meets up at a bar with a friend of his and two pretty young women who are still in school. At the bar Anders sees a man staring at him who he realizes is a man who Iselin cheated on him with. Before leaving Anders tells him he forgives him, but the man is instead angry at him, telling him that the way he treated Iselin while they were dating was cruel.    Anders and the group party well into the morning, getting drunk, making out and eventually going to a local pool which they realize is about to be shut down as it is the last day of August. The others go swimming while Anders refuses to join them.   Anders finally goes to his family home where everything is in disarray, about to be packed up. He finally calls Iselin one last time and apologizes for bothering her, telling her that he didn't mean anything he had previously said. He retreats to his childhood bedroom where he shoots up.

While selling produce at a local market, Ned sells marijuana to a uniformed police officer due to the officer's claim that he had a stressful week, which made Ned feel sympathetic after initially being skeptical. Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs.  Ned has three sisters: Miranda ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) the middle sister, is a journalist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]) have hidden feelings for each other. Natalie ([[Zoey Deschanel|Zooey Deschanel]]), the youngest, is an independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy ([[Rashida Jones]]), and five other roommates. Liz ([[Emily Mortimer]]), the oldest, is married to Dylan ([[Steve Coogan]]), a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is failing as Dylan shows no sexual or emotional interest in Liz. They also have strict control over their son River (Matthew Mindler), which leaves him unhappy and unable to express himself.  When Ned is released from prison, he returns home to his girl and his dog ("[[Willie Nelson]]"). He finds that she is living with Billy ([[T. J. Miller]]), and no longer wishes to continue their relationship or allow him to work at the farm. Billy gives Ned a ride into town and tells him that if he can scrape together $1000 for the first 2 months rent, Janet might let him stay in the goat barn behind the farm. Ned initially stays at his mother's house but a few days later shows up at Liz's place, asking if he can stay with her. He is put in River's room and told that he must help around the house and work with Dylan on his newest documentary about a Russian ballerina named Tatiana (Lydia Haug).  The next day, Miranda reluctantly asks Ned to chauffeur while she interviews an important client, Lady Arabella ([[Janet Montgomery]]). Miranda hopes to pry into her scandalous past, but is dismayed to learn of a legal agreement to only ask about charity work. Miranda tries to pretend Ned isn't there, but his friendliness charms Arabella, who takes a liking to him. That night, Ned goes with Natalie to a self-help meeting with Natalie's artist friend, Christian ([[Hugh Dancy]]). Christian is attracted to Natalie but is dissuaded by her lesbian relationship until Ned informs him that she is bisexual and likes guys too. Christian and Natalie take a cab home and end up having sex.  Ned goes back to working with Dylan, but is told to watch the car while Dylan conducts a private interview with Tatiana. Hours later, Ned is told by a police officer to move out of a tow zone. Running upstairs to get the keys he discovers Dylan naked with Tatiana. Dylan later says the only reason he was naked was to make Tatiana feel more "comfortable" while being naked, which Ned believes. The next night, Ned goes with Miranda to Arabella's benefit dinner, and stays behind to have a conversation with Arabella. She explains the gossipy part of her life (that Miranda had hoped to discover) to Ned, who listens with interest. Ned is later kicked out of Liz's house because, at an important school interview, River tells the interviewer that Ned just got out of jail for selling drugs to a policeman. Ned apologizes, stating he was only trying to help River be himself. Now staying with Miranda, Ned casually mentions Dylan's nude interview with Tatiana and Miranda concludes that Dylan is having an affair. Ned also mentions a personal detail about Arabella that makes Miranda realize that Ned has the info she needs. She forces Ned to tell her the details, which Ned is ashamed to do since he was trusted. Ned returns to the farm with the rent money but Janet doesn't allow him to rent the barn, or leave with his dog.  Ned asks Cindy, who is a lawyer, about ways to get custody of his dog but she suggests as an alternative that they work together to simply take the dog from Janet. He later goes out to lunch with Jeremy and hints at Jeremy's attraction towards his sister. Jeremy explains that Miranda is too bossy for him, though admitting she is beautiful. Ned mentions the idea to Miranda, who is hurt to learn what Jeremy had to say and tells Ned her thoughts on Jeremy, leading to a fight between the two. Natalie later confides in Ned that she is pregnant. Miranda and Nat try to tell Liz about Dylan's affair but Liz becomes angry and the conversation turns into an argument between the three about their personal lives. Liz later confronts Dylan about the affair, and he blames her attempts at pleasing him. Liz is angry that he is blaming her for his infidelity, and divorces him.  Miranda takes Ned into work the next day as she needs him to vouch for the veracity of her article. Ned reads the article but doesn't want to sign a release as he knows Arabella had told him the details in confidence.  The editor calls in the company lawyer and decide they can't publish Miranda's article without Ned vouching for it, which he refuses to do. She kicks Ned out and he stays with Nat, who lies about having told Cindy about the cheating. The next morning, Cindy and Ned drive to the farm to steal his dog back. They sneak into the house but Ned casually brings up Nat's infidelity and Cindy angrily calls Nat from inside the house, which alerts Janet to their presence. Janet refuses to give Ned his dog and Cindy drives away, leaving Ned behind.  Ned goes to his parole officer, Omar, and thinking he can trust him, tells him that the stress of his life was getting to him and he smoked marijuana with a neighbor. Omar tells Ned now he must report him. Ned goes home to a family dinner and is blamed by his sisters for all the trouble in their lives. Ned finally loses his temper and yells at them for their selfishness and for bringing everyone else down which seems to strike a chord with them. Omar arrives with an officer to reluctantly take Ned into custody. Miranda posts Ned's bail, but he refuses to sign his release form, opting to stay in prison rather than be with the girls. They devise a plan to get Willie Nelson from Janet in order to get him to leave. Although Janet refuses, Billy comes out of the house carrying Willie Nelson, tired of Janet refusing to give Ned his dog. They take Willie Nelson to the prison where he is reunited with Ned, motivating him to leave prison.  A few weeks later, Ned is out to lunch with his sisters. Nat receives a call from Cindy, who wants to go with Nat to her gynecologist appointments for support. Miranda has patched things up and started a relationship with Jeremy.

Overheard 2
 Manson Lo, the head broker of Man Sang Securities is shown giving his prediction of the Hong Kong stock market on television. Through the viewpoint of an eavesdropper, it is revealed that Lo works for five of the richest in Hong Kong to manipulate the prices of shares in the stock market. When leaving his office, he realizes that he is being tailed (by Joe Sze-ma) and though successful in shaking off the tail, is involved in a traffic accident.  Inspector Ho and his team discover a military grade eavesdropping device upon examining Lo’s Ferrari. Ho later visits Lo in hospital and attempts to ask him questions but Lo denies knowledge of being followed and evades the other questions at the advice of Emily, his wife and lawyer. Lo’s past is revealed by Ho – Lo’s firm owed the bank money but because of the stock market crash, Lo instead made a lot of money and then became the broker to the five.  In his office, Lo reveals to Emily that he was being followed. She then tells him about Insepctor Ho’s history – not much is known about his previous cases in the police force but his wife (Tsui Foon) was a lawyer that went to jail for using clients’ money to pay off debts after losing money in the stock market, with him being the one that aided in her arrest.  Ho then enters the room and scans the opposing buildings. After noticing something at Diamond House, he directs Tsui Hoi and Fanny to proceed there.  However, as Ho was about to go there with more men, the suspect (Joe Sze-ma) escapes, injuring Tsui Hoi. A chase then ensues. Joe sets off some flares and eventually manages to injure Ho and escape via a bus for elderly living in a home for those with dementia. It is revealed that Joe’s mother (Mrs Sze-ma) is a resident in the nursing home.  Mrs Sze-ma regains her memory temporarily and asks Joe if he has managed to track Tony down and Joe says no. Soon after, her memory lapses and she starts addressing Joe as her husband and speaks to him of the good times they had together.  Ho and his team are shown combing the apartment at Diamond House. They have traced the identity of the person that rented the apartment to a Kim So but found that he is apparently no longer in Hong Kong, having migrated to Canada. Here, it is revealed that Tsui Foon is Tsui Hoi’s sister.  Lo is shown to be meeting the four rich men (without Tony). Manson reveals to them that his car and home were bugged for over a month. Tony calls and Lo reveals the number plate of the vehicle. Tony is then seen instructing Brother Kam to get someone to take care of matters. Lo and the rest are later photographed leaving the hotel.  At home, Lo has a flashback. Intertwined with the story from the hotel manager, Lo is shown meeting Fred of Nixon Electronics, whom he urges to approach a loan shark to borrow fifty million to avoid a hostile takeover by Americans. It was upon knowing how Lo tried to help Fred, that Lo was invited by Sze-ma Cheung (Joe’s Dad) to join the six men, known collectively as the Landlord Club. It was also revealed that Sze-ma Cheung was eventually convicted for insider trading and because of that, expelled from the Club.  Ho and Tsui Hoi are seen picking up Tsui Foon after her release from prison. Tsui Foon blames Ho for her time in jail and asks for a separation from Ho (which Ho reluctantly agrees to) Tsui Hoi then tells Ho that the police have received a package.  Lo receives the same package – in it is a phone with a voice recording of Lo receiving instructions to manipulate the share price of a stock. Lo then realizes his house was being watched. Joe is pictured heading to the carpark near Lo’s place where some men attempt to beat him up. He flees successfully but is eventually thrown over a ledge and saved by Ho. Joe turns the tables, holding Ho at gunpoint and questioning him about the inaction of the police before handcuffing Ho to a scaffolding and leaving in Ho’s vehicle, not before hinting to Ho that something would happen to the stock market in the next few days.  Later, Lo recalls that he first saw Joe at Sze-ma Cheung’s funeral. Lo then receives a call that there is a game on tomorrow and he should attend it. Ho heads home after being told his car was found at the gate. He finds a plastic tag in the car and his wife is witnessed walking out of the house. He later learns from Tsui Hoi that she is leaving and plans to sell the house and go to a trading firm. Joe is later seen to be tailing Tsui Hoi.  The next day, Ho goes to Lo’s office and helps him pay for a gift. When Ho asks Lo what the Landlord Club does, Law refuses to answer but instead starts trading. Later, Lo directs Ho to sign a contract for opening an account. Lo then tells Ho that a typical account opening at his firm would cost $500 000 but he is only charging Ho $100, the cost of the gift that Ho paid for.  Ho then says that the Landlord Club is powerful and since Joe is stepping on their tail, they can easily kill him. Ho reveals that he knows that the Landlord Club deals in illegal funds from conflicts. However, Lo does not seem to know that the Landlord Club has arranged for Joe to be killed and Ho asks to talk to the Landlord Club. Then, Joe calls Lo and Lo asks Ho to leave. Joe asks Lo to record the conversation he has with Tony later and assures him that the phone he was given is secure. Ho tries to get Fanny to track the call but she is unable to.    Later, Fanny briefs Ho that the 3 ID cards found in the various scenes were all registered on the same day but to different people. In the evening, the police tail Lo but lose his tail after Lo gets his subordinate to take his car. Lo heads to the docks to meet his wife but is instead invited on board a yacht along with the other rich men to Tony’s mansion.  Tony reveals that the eavesdropper is Joe, who is Sze-ma Cheung’s son. Later, he contacts Joe from a number indicated at the back of all the cellphones of the other rich men, after confiscating them upon realizing they were all the same brand. Joe tells Tony he wants 50 million shares of stock 749 to be deposited in Man Seng Securities by tomorrow. Tony instructs the rest of get the shares and after they leave, asks Lo if he can still trust him because Lo was brought in by Sze-ma Cheung, and now Joe, Sze-ma’s son, wants to go after them. Lo says he can be trusted because he does not want to go to jail. Later, Lo arrives home to find Ho and his team at the gate. When he gets to his apartment, he is held at gunpoint by Joe, who asks about the cashing of the cheque Lo once passed to Sze-ma Cheung. Joe demands that Lo keeps his word to his Dad about being able to cash the cheque when he needed money.  In the night, Ho arrives at the nursing home and speaks to its director. The director explains to Ho that a tag found in Ho’s car after Joe took it is supposed to contain a GPS tracker so that Alzheimer’s patients can be tracked The number attached to the empty tag, G-41, is Mrs Szema’s bed number.  The next day, Joe asks Ho to open a bag by Mrs Sze-ma’s bedside and Ho discovers photos of his wife inside. Meanwhile, Lo, through Man Seng, is engaged in buying stock 749.  The Landlord Club realizes that Joe is controlling the price because he owns a lot of the shares. Joe is later caught by Brother Kam & brought to Tony’s mansion. At the same time, Tsui Hoi discovers that the names of those on 3 IDs cards previously discovered were actually managers of stock 749, which was the nursing home fund. They then reveal that Sze-ma Cheung used to be their fund manager and that they are just taking their revenge on Tony.  The purchase of stock 749 continues after Joe reveals that he would upload recorded conversations of the rich men giving instructions to manipulate share prices onto a highly subscribed website. Joe also reveals that he gave some of stock 749 to Ho. Later, Tony reveals that he ordered Sze-ma Cheung to be killed in prison and when Joe admits that he did not actually upload any recordings to any website but just wanted to continue to blackmail the rich men, Tony shoots and kills Joe.  Ho successfully rescues Tsui Foon in an apartment after Emily passes him the keys. She passes him a phone that has GPS coordinates of Joe’s location and Ho and his team eventually discovers Brother Kam and his men burying Joe. Tony is eventually arrested based on the recording that Joe obtained through the military grade device that he has been using to bug the rich men, which was embedded in his arm.  Upon his release from prison, Lo approaches the nursing home where Mrs Sze-ma is housed at and offers to be their fund manager. He meets Ho there, who advises him to take good care of Mrs Sze-ma.

Gwen is last, scoring 1 out of 3 claiming she has no idea which celebrity she is compared to the most, has no idea who the man is on the screen, and she is "Guardian Angel", when actually she is compared to Katie Brooks because of the eating disorder she had when she was 15, the boy was Neil Harris which she dedicated her All2gether page to torment him, and she was "Guardian Angel" on a helping hands counselor site. Summary, she is a hypocrite because she should take her own advice before helping others. As Round 1 ends, Dave wonders where the picture of the girl came from because it was nowhere on his page.  Jo looks out the window and stares at the storm claiming to Max that the weather over the Atlantic ocean was supposed to be clear. Max tells her there is nothing to worry about. Round 2 begins, Kiss and Tell. The alligator shows them a video of some men tormenting a man and eventually killing him. Jo reacts to it claiming she never watched it. The alligator pulls up info saying she watched it one night, again the next morning, and sent it to five of her friends saying "OMG THIS NASTY, WATCH TIL THE END!"  she then claims that she is done playing the game. Gwen is next, the alligator pulls up a quiz called "What kind of lover are you?" which she took multiple times. The quiz called her a "kinky lover" which the alligator states wasn't true because she lied on half of her quiz. He then pulls up question four "How many people have you slept with" she claims it was none of his business he says it is none of his business yet she posted it on an online website for everyone to see. He then asks the question again and she sticks with her answer that it was none of his business. He then pulls up a virtual avatar site with her avatar name "Cherry Bomb" and she admits to sleeping with no one. She wonders how he knows all of this. He claims that anyone can see anything that anyone does on All2gether.com. Dave is next, the alligator says he visited videos on a Japanese website and watched some videos "Two girls and a horse", "Too young to run", etc. He then asks if Dave considered the ages of the girls in the videos and asks Dave if he remembers the video that he watched a total four times, claiming that it will come back to haunt him. Dave feels the need to defend himself, saying he isn't a pervert and that everyone watches things that they shouldn't have. Dave then goes to the cockpit door and pounds on it, the alligator tells him to sit down countless times. Dave refuses. The alligator says that since Dave has refused to go along with the rules he has forfeited. The alligator brings onto the screen all the friends of Dave and stops at Rory. the screen changes to the inside of a house, a man with a torch is walking to the door with a gun. He walks into the bedroom and finds Rory playing video games. He knocks Rory out with the gun and shoots him in the head. Max begins to tap on the screen and finds that the email is blocked. Max broke the rules and issued the forfeit. He chooses his friend Allan. The screen goes to a guy in front of a door, a man with a bat begins to pound on him, then pushes him off the railing of the stairs. The alligator assures them that the game is very real. Round 2 is over.  Jo then sees lights outside from land. She claims that they shouldn't be anywhere near land. Max pulls the screen off the wall and punches the wall and hooks the screen to power cords inside the wall. The screen pulls up and shows that their destination is not New York, but Oslo, Norway. Round 3 begins, Do or Die. They will be given an assignment and if they do not follow more deaths will commence. Jo goes into the bathroom and puts on the headphones. Her mission is not known, but if she fails to follow or tells someone her daughter would be killed. Sophie is then shown on the screen inside a bunker house. Jo comes out of the bathroom and takes her seat. Max asks her questions but she refuses to answer or look at them. Dave enters the bathroom and puts on the headsets. If he doesn't follow his fiancée, Sarah, will be killed. Dave exits the bathroom crying. Gwen is next. Gwen hesitates but does the same as the others. Instead she hears crying from her sister. On the screen it shows the man pouring petrol on her. Max is last. He refuses to go until Dave tells him to. On the screen it shows his brother, Mike, tied to a table with the man holding a machete. Max exits and they sit in silent. The alligator tells them that they have 45 minutes to complete their mission, if not their special person dies. At the 45 minute mark the plane would crash into the All2gether.com building and they would all die. Max grabs an Ax and begins to tear apart the plane. The alligator instructs Max to put down the axe or his brother will die. Max does so, but because he gave away some of his mission, the man chops off Mike's arm. Max tells the alligator that he isn't really Max. He explains that he hacked into Max's account and changed everything, that he thought they would've caught him at the airport seeing as how he was 25 and Max was 21, but they didn't. He refuses to tell them who he really is. Dave ends up furious and fights with Max. Jo instructs him to prove who he is. Max pulls out a carton of cigarettes and his passport. Dave believes he is telling the truth. He then walks into the bathroom and puts on the headphones. The alligator instructs that they have all revealed clues to their missions and the result must be consequences. Dave tells the alligator he knows who Max really is. The screen ends on a picture of his fiancée. Jo makes her way to the bar and grabs a bottle of wine. She pours three glasses and Max drinks all three. Back in the bathroom, Dave pleas with the alligator to let his fiancée go, but the alligator says that he has another task and instructs Dave to kill one of the passengers in 3 minutes. Dave grabs the axe and threatens them. Swinging it he attacks Max hitting him in the chest. Max kicks the axe away and they begin attacking each other. Dave grabs a bottle and Max grabs the axe. Dave hits him in the head and Max kills Dave. The alligator then kills Sarah.  Gwen walks into the bathroom and the alligator instructs her to put the headsets on. Gwen tells him that she couldn't do what the alligator told her but he reassigns her to seduce Max. Gwen helps Max carry Dave off so no one will look at him. Gwen takes him into the bathroom to treat his arm. She helps him peel his shirt off and cleans it with her scarf. Gwen then tries to kiss him but he pulls away multiple times. Gwen pleas with him saying that if they didn't do it her sister is going to die. They begin to make out when Max runs into the side of the bathroom to find it hollow then remembers that's where the luggage is. The alligator tell Gwen that she has failed her task, he then tells her that she must stop Max or her sister will die. She refuses to move out of Max's way and attacks him with the Axe. Jo attacks Gwen and snaps her neck. The alligator tells them that Gwen has failed her task and sets her sister on fire.  Max continues to attack the door. When he busts the door down a smell overcomes the entire plane. He finds trash bags. When he opens one it reveals Max's brother. They realize that they have been watching recordings. Max finds his laptop and Jo desperately looks for Sophie. Jo stumbles across her mother and the cockpit door slowly opens. The pilot holds a taser to them and crushes the laptop. They take the pilot down and he tells them that he is just doing what he is told because he has his family. He tells them he came home the day before yesterday and his house was torn apart. Max's vision begins to fade. Jo tells him that everyone is dead. Max begins choking. Jo helps him into a chair and tells him she's sorry that she poisoned him when he drank all three glasses of wine. The alligator shows the pilot's family on the screen. The pilot shocks Jo with the taser and goes back into the cockpit. Jo wakes up and the alligator shows her a video of a young girl taking as many pills as she could to commit suicide, Lucy Turner age 15. The alligator tells her that all four of them commented on the video, they all watched it at exactly the same time. Gwen, "Not even god can forgive you if you do this. Where will you spend eternity?", only made it worse, a hypocrite hiding behind her Christian views (her sister died by fire). Dave, "WTF!!! Another sad attention-seeking trip to causality and a stomach pump. Do it right or don't do it at all!!!!!! Hang yourself and be sure ;-)", merely mocked her agony (Sarah died by hanging), and when he shared the video, Rory committed "Dumb bitch! if i were as ugly as you i'd probably do the same. LOL!!!!!" Jo tells him that he killed the wrong person, because the man on the plane wasn't Max. He tells her that he will catch up with Max soon enough. Alan also commented on Max's shared video, "Cheer up Retard! ROFL!" But he tells Jo that she is most at fault because she sat there and watched it happen, as his little girl killed herself. That they all deserved what happened to them and their punishment was just and fit. She tells him that no one is going to care about it, that no one is going to know. The screen then changes to the camera on her. He tells her that the video is going to go viral after he removes everything about him. She demands to know what happened to her daughter. He tells her that he took out her eyes as Jo's punishment. She claims that Lucy killed herself because of him. Jo grabs the axe and busts the door down. She is sucked out of the plane as it crashes into the sea. The alligator is then revealed as he turns off the screen.  News reporters talk about how the wreckage confirms the video going worldwide. Sophie is shown in the bunker house playing with a doll, when the alligator walks in. He tells her that she is no longer Sophie, but Lucy. He introduces himself as Rupert Turner. He takes her hand and walks her out of the room into a living room where a woman (the chauffeur from earlier) and man (the baggage loader from before  the flight) stand before her. The woman calls herself her mother, Annie, and the man her brother, Ed. (Sophie does have both of her eyes.) The film ends with them walking hand in hand out of the building.

Although the girls are leading two different kinds of lives, they find they must decide how much of themselves they must give up in order to find true love. The movie follows the story of Asuka as she compromises herself in order to get what she thinks she wants, but instead, she finds something entirely different that she never knew she wanted or needed.  
Paradise Kiss (film)
 The movie setting and date takes place in Tokyo, year 2010.   Yukari Hayasaka (Keiko Kitagawa) is a high school student who has become tired of her life of constant schooling. The only thing that hasn't become  boring is her crush for Hiroyuki Tokumori (Yusuke Yamamoto) - a fellow classmate.    One day, on her way home after school, Arashi Nagase (Kento Kaku) spots her and upon his confrontation she runs away thinking he is a gangster because of his dress style. Whilst running, Yukari trips and falls into the arms of Isabelle (Shunji Igarashi), a friend of Aarashi who's dressed as a woman, that carries her back to their studio "Paradise Kiss" after she faints. When Yukari gains consciousness, she meets Arashi's girlfriend Miwako Sakurada (Aya Omasa) who gives her the nickaname 'Caroline', and is formally introduced to everyone known as the ParaKiss group. The trio then explain that they are a group of student fashion designers in need of a model for their clothing label (Paradise Kiss) and for a fashion show competition being held at their institution. Yukari refuses to be their model because she feels that it is a "waste of time" and that fashion designers are "slackers" and decides to leave but not before she meets Jouji 'George' Koizumi (Osamu Mukai) standing at door.    The next day, George meets Yukari at her school and takes her for a haircut by a friend at his institution as well as a trip to a fabric store with the ParaKiss members all in the hope that she might change her mind. Yukari knows nothing about the fashion world and is taken back by the group's eccentric ways but eventually agrees to become their model after George takes her to a 'love hotel' and confronts her for acting prideful, when she places the blame on others for her miseries and does not know what she wants out of life.    Yukari soon comes to admire the groups free thinking ways and ability to pursue their dreams with a one track mind which inspires her to become independent and create her own path in life. At the same time, Yukari finds out that Hiroyuki, Arashi and Miwako were childhood friends but when Hiroyuki moved away, Arashi and Miwako grew closer and became a couple thus resulting in Hiroyuki not being able to make contact with them anymore when he moved back due to a bet he and Arashi had made as children.    Yukari's strict mother, Yasuko (Michiko Hada) confronts Yukari about her studies upon which Yukari mentions the modeling project and that she does not want to study much for her next mock exam. Yasuko slaps Yukari which results in her moving out of her house and moving in with George. Yukari decides to drop out of school and find a job which to her surprise, requires applicants to have completed school. George arranges a 'one-day' modelling job for Yukari via his hairdresser friend which she successfully completes due to George's positive encouragement. George then shows Yukari his "special closet collection" which contains all of the dresses he's ever made but no one has worn them because he wants someone "special" to wear them. Eventually, Yukari begins to develop feelings for George. When George's rival, Kaori Asou (Natsuki Kato) decides to visit, Yukari is instantly jealous and confronts Kaori about her feelings for George. Kaori denies having any feelings for him and mentions that she is more of a "career woman" who's only love and goal is fashion as well as the upcoming competition.    George changes the groups' design at the last minute and the ParaKiss group is left to complete the dress on the day of the competition. At the same time, this is their last project as a group because their designer clothes that were placed in stores, were all returned due to no sales and the group made a decision beforehand that if the clothes were not sold, they would go their separate ways meaning that George will fulfill his dream of going to Paris once they graduate. Yukari also calls home and tells her younger brother to give their mother Yasuko message about the fashion show.    During the runway practice, Yukari struggles to walk due to her nerves which results in her regretting that she did not take the show seriously and George reprimanding her for being her usual, uncaring, not-so-serious self. Isabelle cheers up Yukari and tells her his life story that when he was a child, he never felt right as a boy and George made him his first dress which made him never wear men's clothing again. Isabelle goes on to explain that clothes are "magical" and give people courage which is why they've continued to make them for so long and maybe Yukari will find courage in the dress they've made for her. Yasuko and Hiroyuki attend the fashion show eagerly awaiting Yukari's turn. Before her walk, George gives Yukari a butterfly ring (which is also a symbol on the Paradise Kiss logo) and tells her that she should create her own walk and be like a "butterfly". Yukari completes the runway walk with elegance and poise and in turn receives a standing ovation. George is mesmerized by Yukari's walk and they share a kiss.   Despite Yukari's mesmerizing walk, Kaori wins the fashion competition and the Paradise Kiss group is officially disbanded. Yukari meets Yasuko after the show and is asked to go back home. Yukari packs and leaves Georges apartment without saying goodbye but coincidentally meets George outside. She tells him that she is meeting Hiroyuki and he takes her to buy clothes, make up and does her hair for their meet. Upset by how George is acting, Yukari runs away with George following her and confronts him outside about his confusing actions referring to his kiss after the show and him getting her ready for a date with someone else. Yukari tells George that she knows what she wants out of life and has decided to pursue a modelling career. George wishes Yukari all the best and they part ways. Meanwhile, Hiroyuki is waiting with Miwako and is planning to confess his feelings to Yukari.   George goes back to his place to find Isabelle waiting with his bags packed. Isabelle decides to follow George to Paris and work together with him. The two eventually leave for Paris and Yukari is left somewhat heartbroken and upset by the recent events. Yukari receives a package with a butterfly logo (from George) containing a key and an address. She rushes off to the place and finds an abandoned building with an upstairs room. Yukari enters the room using the key to find all of Georges clothes from his "special closet collection" and recalls him saying that he wants someone "special" to have them. Yukari cries realising Georges feelings for her and treasures the wonderful gifts he gave her.   A few years later, posters of Yukari are all over Tokyo and Hiroyuki is shown crossing the street with a girl. He mentions how Yukari rejected him when he confessed his feelings on the day they met years before. Yukari, now a successful model worldwide, mentions how she did her best to become a model and how she keeps a copy of all her magazine covers on a table in the old ParaKiss studio, in hope that she can one day show them to the ParaKiss members, especially George. One day, Yukari travels to New York for work and discovers a poster of a model wearing a dress with a "butterfly" print on it outside a theater. She finds George's name on the poster and spots Isabelle going through the back entrance of the theater. Yukari pursues Isabelle and finds out that George and he were in Paris for a while but decided to shift to New York. He gives Yukari George's studio / apartment address and she goes over to find that hes not there but decides to look around. A wind blows through the opened window making George's designs spread all over the place and as Yukari tries to tidy them up, she discovers a large pile of magazines that have her photo on them. She realises that George had been keeping track of her career and had purchased all her magazines from Japan and around the world, throughout the years despite being abroad. George arrives and is surprised to see Yukari. They share an eye lock moment then run and hug each other. The movie ends on a happy note with George and Yukari sharing a kiss.  <ref name="eiga1"></ref>

Panjaa
 Jaidev ([[Pawan Kalyan]]) is an accomplished hit man and the most trusted aide of Bhagavan ([[Jackie Shroff]]), the supreme don of [[Kolkata]]. Jaidev remains loyal to him as he helped in seeking revenge with the people who raped his mother and sister when he came to Kolkata in his childhood after his father's death. They share a business rivalry with Kulkarni ([[Atul Kulkarni]]), who aims to overthrow Bhagavan. Things are smooth until Bhagwan’s son Munna ([[Adivi Sesh]]) returns to India. He is a psychotic and highly impulsive youngster. He has his eyes on club dancer Jahnavi ([[Anjali Lavania]]), but she rejects him as she adores Jaidev.  Jaidev meanwhile comes across Sandhya ([[Sarah-Jane Dias]]), a soft-spoken environmentalist and tree lover. A mutual admiration for each other leads to a romantic involvement between the two. Munna meanwhile continues to go crazy about Jahnavi, and a tragedy ensues.  Sabhapathi ([[Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao]]) works for Bhagavan. Munna mistreats Sabhapathi, but Bhagavan doesn't care. Sabhapathi joins Kulkarni's gang to protect himself. Jaidev kidnaps Sampath's ([[Sampath Raj]]) son. Munna kills Sampath's son due to laughter over Jahnavi loving Jaidev. Munna confronts Jahnavi at Jaidev's [[Apartment|flat]] and brutally murders her. Jaidev kills Munna by throwing him from his flat.

Jaidev is forced to decide whether to retaliate or leave Kolkata completely. He chooses to leave out of loyalty to Bhagavan and heads to [[Palasa]], Sandhya's village where her brother Ashok ([[Subbaraju]]) is a valiant, kindhearted cop. He comes across S. I. Paparayudu ([[Brahmanandam]]), and he solves the problems of the village by cleverly using Paparayudu. Jaidev cannot hide the truth from Sandhya anymore. Jaidev tells Sandhya about his life in Kolkata. Jaidev tells Sandhya that he made it look like that Paparayudu solved the problems of village. Since Jaidev told the truth, Sandhya still loves him.

After an emotional sequence, Jaidev shoots Bhagavan in his chest as Bhagavan shoots Sandhya. Sandhya survives, but Bhagavan dies. Jaidev unites with Sandhya, and they both start a new and happy life.  
The Parade (film)
 The film introduces a group of gay activists, trying to organize a pride parade in Belgrade. Among them Mirko Dedijer (Goran Jevtić), a struggling theater director who mostly makes a living by planning lavish and kitschy wedding ceremonies on the side. Organizing such a parade is no easy task in Serbia as evidenced by the violence at the 2001 parade attempt. Now, almost a decade later, the situation is not much better - nationalist and right wing groups pose just as much threat so despite repeated attempts through official channels, Mirko is getting nowhere since the police refuses to secure the event. Mirko's effeminate boyfriend Radmilo (Miloš Samolov) is a veterinarian - he is not nearly as political and is quite content keeping a low profile. Although the two try to live discreetly, both still experience various forms of abuse from the homophobic majority.  In parallel, we meet Miško Drašković a.k.a. Limun, a macho Serbian veteran of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in his mid-to-late forties. No stranger to various criminal activities, divorced Limun now operates a [[judo]] club that doubles as a bodyguard agency (whose clientele mostly consists of controversial [[nouveau riche]] businessmen and female [[turbo-folk]] singers) while dating Biserka (Hristina Popović), a much younger, low-brow ditsy trophy girl who runs a beauty parlour. His son from a previous marriage Vuk (Relja Popović) works in an auto repair shop and is a member of a fringe right wing skinhead group that often engages in violence against gays.  The paths of the two couples cross. Radmilo performs a life-saving operation on Limun's beloved bulldog, the victim of a drive-by shooting that served as warning to the dog's master. Simultaneously, Biserka seeks out Mirko with a view of hiring him to plan out hers and Limun's wedding. The eventual meeting of the two couples goes horribly wrong with Limun's violent and homophobic side emerging, all of which serves as the final catalyst for Mirko (who already obtained an Immigrant Visa for Canada) to leave the country forever as well as for Biserka to leave Limun.  Biserka decides to stop all contact with Limun but calls Mirko in order to apologize. Radmilo picks up the phone and while learning of the circumstances of Biserka's and Limun's situation realizes an opportunity and hatches up a plan. He then shows up at Limun's agency/judo club offering Mirko's services in organizing the wedding party for Limun and Biserka in return for Limun's personnel securing the gay parade. Limun reluctantly accepts, and though Biserka returns to him as a result of the new development, he's now got another problem as his staff members refuse to protect homosexuals. Seeing no other option, Limun decides to once again step in contact with his former companions, most of them who engaged in petty smuggling across the borders during the Yugoslav wars. Limun and Radmilo embark on a recruiting trip all over ex-Yugoslavia.  They manage to sign up for their mission: Roko (45) a Croat war veteran who now runs a [[kafana]], Halil (50) a Bosniak who owns a video rental parlour, and Azem (45), an Albanian from Kosovo who makes a living by selling drugs, mostly to the US troops stationed there.  
Pathinaaru
 Shiva (Shiva) and Indhu (Madhu Shalini) are college students and they both fall in love with each other. However, Indhu’s parents Gopalakrishnan (Abhishek) and Amritha oppose their love as they don’t trust love and try to convince Indhu for which she does not agree. One day, Indhu’s mother gives a book titled “Pathinaru” and asks Shiva and Indhu to read so that they might change their opinions about love.  Now the story moves back to a village in 1980s which describes a teenage love between Gopi (Kishore) and Ilavarasi (Vinitha).

Gopi goes to a nearby town to earn some money so that he can buy her a saree but he meets with an accident and goes unconscious. Gopi is saved by a lorry driver and is admitted in a hospital where he is unconscious. Gopi recovers after a few months and returns to the village to meet Ilavarasi, but is shocked to know that her wedding is on the same day with someone. Gopi is shocked and leaves the village with sorrows.   The book ends there and Indhu’s mother reveals that Gopi is none other than Indhu’s father Gopalakrishnan. She also convinces Indhu that Gopi transformed into Gopalakrishnan which made him successful in life rather than keep worrying about his failed love. Now Indhu doubts the credibility of love and decides to accept her parents’ words.  But Shiva tries to find the whereabouts of Ilavarasi and leaves to the village. After meeting many people, Shiva finds the place where Ilavarasi is currently and goes to meet her. He also takes Indhu’s father Gopalakrishnan with him.

Gopalakrishnan feels guilty but understands the power of true love and decides to get Shiva and Indhu married.  
Parama Veera Chakra
 Chakradhar ([[Nandamuri Balakrishna]]) is a famous movie actor though his mother (Jayasudha) doesn’t approve of his celebrity status. Instead, she yearns to see her son as a Major in the Army, true to the promise she has given to Bobbili Puli ([[N. T. Rama Rao]]). As Chakradhar dons various roles, an army Colonel Jeetendra ([[Murali Mohan]]) tells him that he has a story in which he wants Chakradhar to act. The Colonel narrates him a story of an army major – Major Jaya Simha (again Balakrishna). However, there is a catch. Major Jaya Simha is not a fictional character, but a real time army man who looks ditto like Chakradhar, and valiantly arrested a dreaded terrorist – Abdul Ghani. The tragedy is Jaya Simha is now in a vegetative state (on mechanical ventilation), thanks to a conspiracy plotted by politicians, few army men and terrorists themselves. Colonel Jeetendra asks Chakradhar to act like Major to ensure that the nation's security plans are not compromised. How Chakradhar attacks the terrorists and how he brings back the honor of the Major forms the rest of the story.<ref name="Story"></ref>

But the final straw for Lisa is when, finding the empty sheet, she goes to check on the sleeping girls. As she moves towards the crawl space closet, she is blasted by a sudden gust of wind, which terrifies her, causing her to run downstairs, waiting by the door for the parents return. The following night, Kristi wakes up to a visit from Toby and she tells him they're not friends anymore. This causes Toby to throw an off-screen fit. Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet the following morning, and later finds the same symbol in a book about [[demonology]]. When Kristi becomes ill, Julie and Dennis take her to the hospital. Katie is left home with Randy, and they play [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]] in the girls' bathroom. When nothing happens, Katie insists they try again. Randy is then attacked and discovers a large scratch on his torso. They try to leave the bathroom, but a black figure moves past the door. The second time they try to leave, furniture is violently flung across the room. After Julie and Dennis return, Randy quickly leaves, warning that whatever they're dealing with is dangerous. Dennis tells Julie that the symbol he found in the girls' room belonged to a [[witchcraft|witches]]' [[coven]] that brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons, and then force them to give up their sons; they would not remember anything afterward. Julie dismisses his claim, and instead argues with Dennis.  The invisible demon terrorizes Katie and Kristi, harming Katie until Kristi agrees to do what it asks. The next day, Kristi asks her mother to take them to her grandmother Lois's house in [[Moorpark, California]], but she refuses. After Julie encounters frightening activity herself, she agrees to go to Lois's home. Dennis sets up another camera in their new bedroom. At 1 am, they are awoken by loud disturbances and Julie goes to investigate. When she fails to return, Dennis goes to look for her. He calls for Julie and the girls but there is apparently no one there. Downstairs, Dennis notices a human silhouette behind a curtain, but when he looks there is no one there. He finds occult imagery on the walls, including the symbol from the girls' room, which had been concealed behind paintings. Dennis enters the garage and discovers several women, including Lois, dressed in all black. He flees back to the house, with the women in pursuit. In the house, he finds Julie at the top of the stairs. As he approaches her, he sees that her limp body is levitating above the ground. Her body is thrown at Dennis, knocking him down the stairs. He sees Kristi, and hides with her in a closet. The demon growls and bangs on the door, but eventually leaves.  Dennis and Kristi leave the closet and walk into the kitchen. In the window, Dennis sees the women outside in the garden, circling around a bonfire. They find Katie crying by the stairs near Julie's body. Dennis approaches Katie from behind, but when he places his hand on her shoulder, Katie turns around and unleashes a demonic scream that throws him to the other side of the room, injuring his leg. Katie flees and Dennis tries to crawl toward Julie's body. Lois stands in his way, and Dennis's body is violently contorted, killing him. Lois then beckons to Kristi and Katie and, after they start going upstairs, Lois tells them to get ready. Before they head upstairs, Kristi calls for Toby when they leave the camera lying on the floor. And then, it goes to static and black after low growling sounds are heard from upstairs.

Pariah (2011 film)
  Alike is a 17-year-old African-American girl who hangs out at clubs with her openly lesbian friend Laura. Alike slowly and firmly comes to terms with her own identity as a butch lesbian, comfortable in baggy clothes and male underwear. Her mother Audrey approves of neither her clothes nor her friendship with Laura.  Harboring growing suspicions about Alike's sexuality, Audrey forces her to wear feminine clothing and tries to stem any influence from Laura by pushing Alike to instead make friends with Bina, a young girl from her church. Alike has a better relationship with her father Arthur, who is a police detective.  Alike begins to develop feelings for Bina, and starts spending more time with her than with Laura, much to Laura's annoyance. Arthur comes back late a few times from work, which angers Audrey and the two of them fight often. Arthur does not think much about the changes in Alike's life. Saying she is going through a phase, he is supportive of her, although he cautions her on steering clear of the area where there is a lesbian bar, saying it's not safe.  One night after going to see an alternative rock band, Alike and Bina are alone in Bina's room when Bina begins caressing and kissing Alike.  Alike is at first hesitant, having had no prior experience with physical intimacy.  However, she eventually responds and the two spend the night together.  In the morning, Alike talks to Bina about where they want their relationship to go, but Bina says there is no relationship, as she is not "really gay-gay" and only regarded their physical encounter as playful indulgence.  Her only further interest in Alike seems to be her concern that Alike not tell anyone else about the two of them.  Hurt and upset, Alike leaves and returns home and cries for hours.  During that time, Audrey and Arthur have an explosive fight about Alike. Despite her sister Sharonda's protests, Alike decides to intervene in the fight and she comes out to her parents. Disgusted, Audrey viciously attacks Alike while Arthur tries to restrain her. Alike flees to Laura's house where the two friends reconcile. Audrey then tries to forget that anything happened, which annoys the rest of her family. Arthur comes to meet with Alike, apologizes for Audrey's actions and requests that Alike come back home, offering half-hearted assurance that if she does, "things will be different".  Alike says that she will not return home, but instead plans to move to California to begin college early.  She assures her father that, "I'm not running; I'm choosing."  Before leaving, Alike makes an attempt to reconcile with her mother as well.  However, her mother refuses to accept her and offers only that she will be praying for Alike.  Arthur, Sharonda and Laura see Alike off on her journey west and the film ends with Alike reading a poem she wrote; its theme echoes her words to her father that she is not running, but choosing.

They stop to investigate and offer assistance to the driver, who turns out to be an alien named Paul. Clive faints, but Graeme agrees to assist Paul and gives him a ride.  Later, Special Agent Zoil of the [[US Secret Service]] arrives at the car-crash site and informs his unseen female superior, "the Big Guy", that he is closing in on Paul. She sends two inept rookies, Haggard and O'Reilly, to assist Zoil.  Clive wakes up in the RV, he then tries to strangle Paul until Graeme calms him down. Paul tells them that the government spoon fed his image to the public to keep them from panicking if anyone encounters his race. They later camp at an [[RV park]] run by two [[Christian fundamentalist]]s, one-eyed Ruth Buggs and her father, Moses. The next day, when Ruth discovers Paul, the three are forced to take her with them. During an argument, Paul convinces Ruth to question her beliefs.

The group soon arrives at a house owned by Tara, who rescued Paul when he crashed on Earth 60 years ago and accidentally killed her dog (Who Paul was named after) in the crash, and as a result of no one believing her story, has spent her life as a pariah. As she makes tea for her visitors, Haggard, O'Reilly, and Zoil surround the house. The fugitives flee, but O'Reilly shoots at them, igniting gas from Tara's stove and destroying her house. O'Reilly is apparently killed in the explosion. Haggard pursues and catches up to the RV. Due to an error in judgement, Haggard drives off a cliff and is killed.

Paul, Graeme, Clive, Ruth, and Tara arrive at [[Devils Tower|Devils Tower National Monument]], where they set off fireworks as a signal to Paul's mothership. A helicopter suddenly arrives with agents and the Big Guy. Zoil then appears and initiates a stand-off, disabling the agents, but is then wounded by the Big Guy. Secretly, Zoil is Paul's friend and was attempting to aid his escape under the guise of capturing the alien. The group fights the Big Guy and Tara knocks her out. Moses arrives unexpectedly and fires his shotgun, intending to kill Paul, but Graeme jumps in front of Paul and Ruth and is fatally wounded. Paul once again uses his healing powers, reviving Graeme in spite of the danger to himself. Graeme and Ruth admit their feelings for each other and kiss, but then the Big Guy regains consciousness and holds the group at gunpoint. Just as the Big Guy is about to kill them, she is crushed by a suddenly arriving spaceship. Paul says goodbye to his friends but before he goes, he offers Tara a chance to go with him, promising to give her a new life after ruining her childhood and accidentally killing her dog. The aliens go home as the humans wave them goodbye.

[[National Security Guard]] Major Raveendra recalls the loss of a valued comrade at the shootout when he captured Yusuf Khan, and regrets not killing Khan at the time. He urges the government to allow a [[Special Forces of India|commando]] operation, but officials fear to risk passengers' life, not trusting Raveendra's team. The major is frustrated when the government vacillates and it seems that Khan might be released. Inside the flight, the passengers fall into groups discussing their past lives and religion. One of the terrorists becomes sentimentally attached to Afshana, a little girl returning to [[Karachi]] after her heart operation.

Ravi plans to shoot the terrorists during their transit to a new flight by asking the passengers to bend down when they get a signal. The firing succeeds and four of the five terrorists are killed. The last terrorist is killed with the help of the passengers Chandrakanth and Vinod. The plastic explosive is found in Afshana's bag. Ravi throws it away which explodes.

Soon Disha and the police find that Sia had gone with Monica and somebody else in a car somewhere, and that car is found abandoned. Kabir and Disha go to Monica's house, only to find that she has been murdered.  The case takes an interesting turn when Disha happens to visualize something about Sia, which she does not tell Kabir because of her fear that it would be too shocking for him to accept. Soon Kabir and his parents get a call that Sia has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper asks for 1 million pounds from Kabir's parents.  The kidnappers ask Kabir to come alone to deliver the money through directions given to him time and again over phone. Kabir goes with transmitters fitted on him and the police tracking him, but these measures are rendered useless by the apparently smart criminals. Soon Kabir finds himself in a dance bar, where the bags are taken from him, but the criminals find that it is filled with only paper, and they beat him and threaten to kill his wife. Kabir chases them, only to be stopped by Disha who arrives at the scene. She tells him that she knows where his wife is.  Disha takes Kabir and the cops to Dia Mansion, where on searching they come across the cellar and the coffin box. Kabir opens it to find a skeleton and a worn out parchment. He reads all that was on it, and understand that this was written by none other than himself centuries ago. Kabir had at that time been deceived by a jealous friend of his into believing that his wife was unfaithful, and he murdered his wife and kept her in the coffin box. Later on knowing the truth, he was not able to forgive himself, so he had approached a guru, who told him that he will pay for his crimes now and in the next life, and told him what to do next. Kabir had then written everything and had shot himself at the cellar.  Soon the kidnappers send a disc to Kabir's family with a video of Sia being tortured as a warning not to call police, and this time Kabir is called to an isolated ship to pay up and take his wife.  On reaching the ship, Kabir goes alone, but Disha sees a gang of goons following him, senses danger and follows him secretly.  On the deck, Kabir meets with the greatest shock of his life when he sees his wife, hale and hearty waiting to meet him, with none other that her [[Englishman]] boyfriend, whom Kabir had once beaten in a bar for going to Sia. Apparently everything that has taken place has been an act and both have been involved in the entire drama. Sia shoots Kabir in the shoulder. She then tells him that she and the Englishman were lovers, and that her only interest in Kabir was in his father's money and property, for which she married him. She also admits that it was she who killed Monica as the latter was involved in the crime and knew all about it. They tell Kabir that on killing him, she will put up an act of innocence before his parents and later the property will be transferred to her.They also say they shall eliminate his parents.  As Kabir is going to be shot again, Disha breaks in and pushes the gun off Sia's hands. Kabir breaks fee and beats up all the goons. Disha is pushed off the ship and hangs on the deck margins. Kabir goes to save her, manages to pull her up, but gets stabbed by Sia's lover. Everyone flees the scene.  Sia arrives at Kabir's house and tries to convince his parents that he was killed by goons, but there comes Inspector Asif, who has come to know about everything, telling them the truth. He arrests Sia on charges of attempting to Murder Kabir and on charges of murdering Monica.  Now in hospital, in a  critical condition and under surgery, Kabir's souls leaves his body and meets Guru, who tells him that he has faced the punishment for his crimes in the past, but he has also saved lives as a doctor, so the circle of [[karma]] is complete, and that he shall live.  The film ends in [[Goa]], India, where Kabir arrives as a surprise guest at the house of Disha who has moved down to India. He says that he searched and found a picture of the past of him and his wife. His wife of the past happens to be none other than Disha herself. Disha says she knew this but was afraid to admit it as she feared falling in love again.

The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall
   ===Prologue=== In 1911, the Vicomte de Chagny attends an auction of old theatrical props at the Paris Opéra and purchases a papier-mâché music box, noting that it appears "exactly as she said." The auctioneer presents a chandelier as the next item up for bid, noting its connection to "the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera". As the mammoth fixture comes to life, the years roll back and the Opéra's former grandeur is restored ("Overture").  ===Act I=== It is now 1881. As Carlotta, the Opéra's resident soprano [[prima donna]], rehearses for that evening's performance, a [[Backdrop (theater)|backdrop]] collapses without warning. The anxious cast members whisper about "The Phantom of the Opera", who Carlotta reveals has been troubling the Opera Populaire "for the past three years". The Opera's new owners, Firmin and André, try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily chastises the pair for saying "these things do happen" and storms offstage, closely followed by Monsieur Piangi. Meg Giry, the daughter of the Opéra's ballet mistress Madame Giry, tells Firmin and André that Christine Daaé, a [[chorus girl]] and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist, has been "well taught", and could sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the performance their only alternative, the owners reluctantly audition Christine, and to their surprise she is exceptional in the role ("Think Of Me").  Backstage after her triumphant début, Christine confesses to Meg that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible "Angel of Music" ("Angel of Music"). The new patron, Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, finds Christine, his old childhood playmate, in her dressing room. Christine reminds Raoul about the "Angel of Music" stories that her late father used to tell them, and confides that the Angel has been visiting her and given her her astonishing voice. Raoul good-naturedly accepts her revelation, and invites her to dinner. Christine, to his puzzlement, is not as willing, claiming that her Angel is a stern taskmaster and that he will not be pleased by her absence. Raoul jokingly states that he will not keep her up late and exits, telling her that he'll be back for her in two minutes ("Little Lotte"). Christine fearfully calls after him that "things have changed" as the jealous Angel of Music condemns Raoul for "sharing in my triumph". Christine begs him to reveal himself. The Angel obliges and materialises in her mirror. The mirror opens, revealing the Angel to be the Phantom of the Opera, who leads Christine away. Raoul finds Christine's dressing room empty and calls out for her ("The Mirror (Angel of Music)"). The Phantom and Christine cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair beneath the Opéra house ("The Phantom of the Opera"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her ("The Music of the Night"). Overwhelmed, Christine faints and the Phantom carries her to a bed and expresses his adoration for her.  As the Phantom composes music at his organ ("I Remember"), Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box. She slips up behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his face. The Phantom rails at her, damning her for her curiosity as Christine hides herself in fear. The Phantom ruefully expresses his longing to look normal—and to be loved by her ("Stranger Than You Dreamt It"). Christine returns the Phantom's mask to him and the Phantom leads her back to the Opéra house.  Meanwhile, inside the Opéra House, Joseph Buquet, the Opéra's chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the "Opéra Ghost" and his [[Hangman's knot|magical lasso]]. Madame Giry warns Buquet to exercise restraint ("Magical Lasso"). In the managers’ office, André and Firman read notes from the Phantom aloud and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Carlotta and Piangi then burst into the office, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note saying that her days at the Opéra are numbered. As André and Firmin try to calm the distressed Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta in the new opera, ''Il Muto'', or there will be a terrible disaster "beyond imagination" ("Notes…"). Firmin and André assure the enraged Carlotta that she will remain the star, begging her to "entrance us once again" ("Prima Donna"). The performance begins well, with André and Firmin joking about the disaster the Phantom threatened. The Phantom's voice suddenly cuts through the performance, angrily reminding them that he had instructed them to keep Box 5 empty for his use. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotte reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a "little toad". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Buquet, hanging from the Phantom's magical lasso, drops from the rafters. Firmin and André plead for calm as the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard ("Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh").  In the ensuing chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof, where she tells him about her subterranean rendezvous with the Phantom. Raoul is skeptical, telling her that what she experienced was just a dream ("Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There"). Seeing Christine's fear is real, he swears to love and to protect her always. They acknowledge their love for each other as Christine and Raoul return to the Opera House ("All I Ask of You"). The Phantom, who has overheard their conversation, is heartbroken and accuses Christine of denying and betraying him. He tearfully rues that Raoul was "bound to love you when he heard you sing". As Raoul and Christine's expression of love for each other reverberates through the rooftops he angrily vows revenge, destroying the Opéra's mighty chandelier with a massive explosion as the curtain falls ("All I Ask of You (Reprise)").  ===Act II=== Six months later, in the midst of a splendid masquerade ball, the Phantom, costumed as the Red Death, makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster ("Masquerade/Why So Silent?"). He announces to the stunned guests that he has written an opera entitled ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]''. He demands that it be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) as the lead female role, and threatens dire consequences if his instructions are not implicitly obeyed before vanishing in a ghostly flash of fire and smoke. Raoul demands that Madame Giry tell him about the Phantom. She reluctantly replies that he is a brilliant musician and magician born with a terrifyingly deformed face, who escaped from captivity in a travelling freak show and disappeared.  During rehearsals, Raoul - tired of the tyranny with which the Phantom rules the Opera - thinks to use the première of ''Don Juan Triumphant'' as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind and that it is her plan so she can be the star. Christine angrily defends herself, saying that it is not true. Carlotta storms out in rage. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fiancée, asserts that the Phantom will be sure to attend ("Notes/Twisted Every Way"). Christine, torn between her love for Raoul and her fear of the Phantom, visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance but understanding that she must move on ("Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again"). The Phantom appears, once again under the guise of the Angel of Music ("Wandering Child"). Christine, tired and heartbroken, once again accepts her "Angel" as a friend, nearly succumbing to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to both rescue her and confront The Phantom. The Phantom taunts Raoul, magically summoning pillars of fire at them ("Bravo, Bravo") and causing them to flee. Furious, the Phantom sets fire to the cemetery, waging war upon them both.  ''Don Juan Triumphant'' opens with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that she is singing not with Piangi, but with the Phantom himself ("The Point of No Return"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses love for Christine and slips his ring onto her finger; Christine rips off his mask, exposing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. Chaos ensues. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage, the cast and audience fly into a state of panic, and the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for murder Buquet and Piangi, searches the theatre for the Phantom, while Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair, and warns him to beware his magical lasso.("Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer").  In the lair, Christine is forced to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show compassion. The Phantom refuses, stating that "the world showed no compassion to me" and claiming that his intention was never to hurt Christine for Raoul's "sins." The Phantom captures Raoul with his lasso and turns to Christine - he bargains that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him forever; if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion. The Phantom, having experienced kindness, at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him. He sets them both free, telling them to forget about "this angel in hell". Christine returns the Phantom's ring to him, and he tells her he loves her. Christine exits with Raoul. Lamenting that, without Christine, "it's over now, the music of the night", the Phantom makes his way to his throne and covers himself with his cloak. Meg enters the Phantom's lair and pulls away the cloak, finding only the Phantom's mask. She holds the Phantom's mask up and looks out to the audience as the lights fade to black.  ===Grand Finale=== After the cast bow-out, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] delivers a speech to the audience before bringing out the Royal Albert Hall creative team, the original creative team, as well as the original leads from both the London and Broadway productions, and the original London cast, including [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Sarah Brightman]]. Brightman sings "The Phantom of the Opera" with four Phantoms: [[Colm Wilkinson]] from the original workshop and the Canadian production, [[Anthony Warlow]] from the Australian production, [[Peter Jöback]], who has now played the role in the West End, Broadway, and Sweden, [[John Owen-Jones]] from the London and 25th Anniversary Tour productions. The performance concludes when Ramin Karimloo joins the four Phantoms to sing "The Music of the Night", along with the entire cast and creative teams including Michael Crawford.

Pina (film)
 The film presents extracts from some of the most noted dance pieces by [[Pina Bausch]] in the [[Tanztheater]] ("dance theater") style of which Bausch was a leading exponent. The extracts are from four pieces:  ''Le sacre du printemps'' (''[[The Rite of Spring]]''), ''Café Müller'', ''Kontakthof,'' and ''Vollmond''. These are complemented with interviews and further dance choreographies, which were shot in and around [[Wuppertal]], Germany; the film includes scenes showing the [[Wuppertal Schwebebahn]], an elevated railway, and some dance sequences take place inside its carriages.  In the first piece, ''Le sacre du printemps'' (''Frühlingsopfer,'' ''The Rite of Spring'') (1975), the dancers of the Tanztheater Wuppertal, separated into male and female groups, move about a stage covered by a thick layer of peat.  The following section, ''Café Müller'' (1978), portrays a café Pina often visited when she was a child. In a simple setting consisting of some tables and chairs and doors, a small woman dressed in white is entering the café. Two more women, one of whom is obviously blind, appear. They hesitate to step further, as the tables and chairs are obstructing their way. Two men come around and try to remove these barriers. Eventually the blind woman and one of the men stand face to face. The second woman wraps her arms around the other men, but she slips. This part repeats and seems to remain in a loop.  The next piece, ''Kontakthof,'' (''[[wikt:Kontakt#German|Kontakt]]'' "contact" + ''[[wikt:Hof#German|Hof]]'' "court, courtyard", hence "contact court, courtyard of contact") was performed multiple times for Wenders' cameras, with groups of different generations: teenagers, middle-aged dancers, and dancers over 65. Bausch had choreographed these three variants as ''Kontakthof – Mit Teenagern ab 14'' (2008), ''Kontakthof'' (1978), and ''Kontakthof – Mit Damen und Herren ab 65'' (2000). The film edits these performances into one, cutting between different performers to highlight their different abilities.  In the final piece, ''Vollmond'' (2006) (''[[wikt:Vollmond#German|Vollmond]],'' "full moon"), the stage is flooded. The scenery consists of one large rock and some chairs. At the end of the film, the actors face the audience on a small path with a brown coal mining region in the background to an open end.

  After a failed attempt to rescue his first mate, [[Joshamee Gibbs]], in London, [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] is brought before [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]. The king wants Jack to guide an expedition to the [[Fountain of Youth]] before [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|King Ferdinand]] and the [[Spanish Navy]] can locate it. Jack's old nemesis, Captain [[Hector Barbossa]], now a [[privateer]] in service to the [[Royal Navy|British Navy]] after losing his leg and ship, the ''[[Black Pearl]]'', which he says was sunk, is heading the expedition.  Jack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, [[Captain Teague]], who warns Jack about the Fountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is [[Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Angelica]], Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate [[Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Blackbeard]], who practices [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] magic and wields the mythical "Sword of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]" that controls his ship, the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''. While Jack is [[Shanghaiing|shanghaied]] aboard Blackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's map showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.  Meanwhile, after a failed [[mutiny]] aboard the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a "one-legged man", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard [[Juan Ponce de León]]'s missing [[flagship]], the ''Santiago''. The Fountain's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a [[mermaid]]'s tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the ''Black Pearl'' was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken [[Ship in a bottle|ships in bottles]].  The ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.  Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the ''Black Pearl'', and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.  At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.  With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body, killing him.  Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a [[cay]]. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the ''Revenge''. He reclaims the shrunken ''Black Pearl'' and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a [[gunny sack]]. The two leave, [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales|hoping to revert the ''Black Pearl'' to its original size and continue living the pirates' life]].  In a [[post-credits scene]], a [[voodoo doll]] of Jack crafted by Blackbeard washes ashore and is found by Angelica, who then smiles.

 In [[Gothenburg]] a gang of five black teenage boys act out an elaborate scheme for taking the belongings of one Asian and two white teenage boys, in which the blacks play [[good cop/bad cop]] (this is previewed at the very start of the film with an earlier theft from two different boys). First they ask the time. When one of the victims checks the time on his mobile phone they claim it looks like the one that was stolen from a brother of one of them. The three boys have to come along to verify this with the brother. At one point the eight have to flee from a gang of adults, and one black and one white boy together get separated from the other six. By phone they find out the location of the others and reunite. Then after some moving around, one boy of the gang wants to quit; the gang leader responds by beating him up and kicking him. The four remaining gang members proceed with the three boys.  They end up in a deserted place where the four force the three to participate in a running contest, with one of the three against one of the four, where the group of the winner gets all valuables of all the boys. The two walk along a curved path to the starting point from where they have to run back to the others. The three lose due to a trick of the four: the boy from the group of three thought they had to run along the path, but the other boy ran straight. The three are now free to go. They have no phone to contact their parents and no money for the tram, so they travel without a ticket; they do not explain this to the conductor, and get fined and scolded by him for [[fare evasion]].  Later the father of one of the victims (of a different unseen theft) confronts a gang member, but this is disapproved of by a female bystander who interprets this as racist.

Pokémon the Movie: Black—Victini and Reshiram and White—Victini and Zekrom
 The two films follow a similar plot with some major and minor changes, notably the Pokémon that appear, [[Reshiram]] and [[Zekrom]] swapping roles. In the opening scenes, a man named Damon approaches a remote village with the intention of revitalising the land of the People of the Vale. A natural disaster occurs, but Damon summons either Reshiram or Zekrom to save the villages.  Meanwhile, [[Ash Ketchum]], [[List of characters in the Pokémon anime series#Iris|Iris]] and [[List of characters in the Pokémon anime series#Cilan|Cilan]] approach Eindoak Town, but Ash rescues a pair of [[Deerling]] from falling off a cliff. He unknowingly is touched by [[Victini]], causing him to spring across a gorge and land on the other side, venturing through a cave with [[Pikachu]] and the Deerling. Ash and co. navigate their way through the cave system and emerge in the cellar of the town’s castle known as the Sword of the Vale, said to have flown from a nearby valley to its current spot. The group go to the town’s harvest festival, guided there by Damon, also meeting Damon’s sister Carlita, mother Juanita, and the town’s mayor Mannes. In a Pokémon tournament, Cilan's [[Pansage]] is defeated, and Iris loses when her [[Emolga]] switches out for her [[Excadrill]]. Ash wins with [[Pikachu]], [[Oshawott]], [[Tepig]], and [[Scraggy]], Carlita realising Victini has been giving his Tepig and Scraggy power boosts. Ash and his friends befriend Victini. Ash tries to take Victini to the outskirts of town but learns Victini cannot leave due to a barrier placed around it, held up by several pillars.  Mayor Mannes explains to the kids of the town’s legend, in which Victini was friends with the king of the Kingdom of the Vale. The kingdom was empowered by the Dragon Force, an energy source which brought harmony to the world. The king’s sons were accompanied by Reshiram and Zekrom, but the princes became enemies leading to a war between Reshiram and Zekrom, who mortally wounded each other, transforming into stones and fell asleep. The Dragon Force grew destructive, so the king used Victini’s powers to move the castle to its current spot to contain the energy, and creating the barrier, but he died as a result. The princes put aside their differences and hid the slumbering dragon Pokémon. Damon explains he hopes to restore the dead kingdom’s valley using Victini’s powers and reunite the scattered People of the Vale, based on his mother’s wish. Damon also reveals he and Mannes found Zekrom/Reshiram beneath the castle.  Ash promises to take Victini to the ocean, but Damon prepares to move the castle to start off his plans. Using Sigilyph’s powers, Damon has the barrier’s pillars moved to the castle, followed by Victini who believes the king is summoning it. Damon uses Victini’s power to move the castle and redirect the Dragon Force’s power to the valley. Carlita and Juanita realize Damon is torturing Victini, and will eventually kill Victini. Ash, Iris and Cilan try to stop Damon from harming Victini, but their attempts are thwarted by Zekrom/Reshiram. Victini recalls how the king told it that if the castle was moved again, the Dragon Force would become destructive.  Retreating, Juanita suggests finding Reshiram/Zekrom.  Ash ventures into the caves and finds the version's respective second dragon. As Reshiram and Zekrom duel, both spot the destructive Dragon Force and join forces to stop it.  Zekrom/Reshiram releases Victini, and Damon is shown the Dragon Force, prompting him to use the castle to contain the unstable power with help from Reshiram and Zekrom. The group evacuate the castle, but Damon wants to try and fix the mess he has made and Victini remains trapped by the barrier with Ash and Pikachu not wanting to leave Victini, as the Dragon Force’s power grows deadlier and the castle floats up into the sky. Damon explains the barrier’s pillars must be destroyed to release the energy, but as the castle drifts up into the atmosphere, Ash collapses from the lack of air and falls unconscious due to the increasing coldness with Pikachu clinging to Ash's side, calling its trainer's name. Unable to watch Ash die, Victini reacts by using its powers to revive Ash and blast apart the pillars, seemingly dying as a result, the contained Dragon Force energy being fired into space. Damon, Reshiram and Zekrom guide the castle back to the town and seal away the Dragon Force once again.  Later, Ash, Iris and Cilan visit a nearby beach in Victini’s memory, tossing one of Cilan’s macarons into the ocean. Victini appears and eats it, now free of the barrier and has plans to restore the valley its way. Damon begs for forgiveness, receiving it from his mother. The film ends with Reshiram and Zekrom departing, and Victini, Ash and the others are shown reuniting the People of the Vale in the restored valley.  
Ponnar Shankar (film)
 A love affair between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her maternal uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, especially since he is not financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, who had come to see her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a [[Kongu Vellalar|gounder]] custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.  Many years later, Mayavar (Nasser), a chieftain of a village in Periyamalaikozhundhu's kingdom, encounters twin brothers Ponnar and Shankar (both played by Prashanth), who are being tutored in martial arts by Rakki Annan (Rajkiran).

The girls are later revealed to be daughters of Chinna Malaikozhundhu. Impressed with Ponnar and Shankar's valour, Chinna Malaikozhundhu agrees to marry off his daughters to them.  A flashback reveals that Ponnar and Sankar are actually Thamarai's sons and that Rakki, who was then a servant of Nellaiyankondan, had saved the twins as small children from Mandhiyappan. Mandhiyappan had attempted to avenge himself on Thamarai for rejecting his hand in marriage. He learns that the twins are still alive and hatches a conspiracy to kill them. He tricks Kali Mannan (Napoleon) and Thamarai's father into helping him. This leads to an intense battle which ends with good prevailing over evil.

No one knows whether he is from the North or the South, though from his commando-like abilities he is obviously highly trained. He makes contact with clients via a makeshift memorial-cum-bulletin board for divided families along the DMZ. On one mission he smuggles an antique, as well as a young boy, from North to South; when the smugglers are caught by the police, the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|South's National Intelligence Service]] becomes aware of Poongsan's existence.

Priest (2011 film)
 A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a [[theocracy]] under an organization called The Church.  They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in [[wikt:reservation|reservation]]s. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church.  Priest ([[Paul Bettany]]) is approached by Hicks ([[Cam Gigandet]]), the sheriff of Augustine, a free town. Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy ([[Lily Collins]]), was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas ([[Christopher Plummer]]) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, not wanting to discourage the idea that the Church completely defeated the vampires for fear of compromising their authority over the city. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back.  Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a [[pathogen]] that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle. Priestess ([[Maggie Q]]) joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an [[armored train]] arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat. When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.  The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment where she makes her move, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her. Priest, who is clearly not over Shannon, gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks believes an attack on the cities would be unwise because of the sun, but Priest reveals that factories, producing [[Air pollution|massive clouds of smoke and ash]], have permanently deprived the city of sunlight, so the vampire attack would be a slaughter.  Hicks threatens Priest, claiming he will shoot him unless he promises to let Lucy live whether she's been infected or not. (Priest had earlier revealed to Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, that if they discovered Lucy had been infected as a Familiar, he'd kill her.)  Hicks doesn't understand why Priest, who is basically a stranger to Lucy, cares so much about her. Priestess reveals that Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that his brother, Owen stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by The Church.  While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as one of the Priests who was defeated in the final attack on Sola Mira and a close friend of Priest. After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. Priestess battles several Familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and crashing it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in fire, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.  Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the queen's. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room. Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that is just beginning. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point. Priest sets off into the sunset.

Prep & Landing: Naughty vs. Nice
 The beginning of the special introduces the Coal Elf Brigade, a special unit of [[Christmas elf|Christmas elves]] that is responsible for [[Knecht Ruprecht|delivering lumps of coal to naughty children]]. While seeming cruel to some, the brigade adds small, encouraging notes to the lumps such as "Try Harder next year," in an attempt to steer the children back to the nice list.  With the Big 2-5 fast approaching, Wayne and Lanny must race to recover classified North Pole technology that has fallen into the hands of a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] identified only as "jinglesmell[[Leet|1337]]." Desperate to prevent Christmas from descending into chaos, Wayne seeks out (at the insistence of Magee) the foremost Naughty Kid expert to aid in the mission, a bombastic member of the Coal Elf Brigade who also happens to be his estranged younger (but larger) brother, Noel.<ref name=ABC /> Reluctant to take the extroverted Noel along with him, Wayne relents, and Noel joins the Prep & Landing team on the mission. During the trip, Noel and Wayne reminisce about their childhood, when they worked together far better than they do now. As the trio arrives at the hacker's house, Wayne sets off a [[booby trap]], imperiling the entire team; Noel manages to defend himself, Wayne takes a particular beating from the trap's various mechanisms, and Lanny makes it into the hacker's room, only to accidentally "sparkle" himself and end up taken captive.  The hacker then reveals herself to be Grace Goodwin, whose sole mission is to get herself off the naughty list, believing that she had been set up by her toddler brother, who had destroyed her favorite toy and ruined her chances to ask Santa for a new one by his crying. After a somewhat intoxicated Lanny suggests using the "magic word" to get the password for the device that will get her off the list, she does just that: using the word "please" as the password, since genuinely naughty kids never say "please." At first, she appears successful in changing her status from naughty to nice, but the device malfunctions, threatening to place the entire planet on the naughty list unless she and the team can pull off a risky operation to fix the problem.   Meanwhile, Wayne is particularly bitter at being "shown up" by his younger brother, prompting a fight in the street in front of Grace's house in which Wayne wishes he never had a brother. Shocked at his statement, Noel (who always idolized Wayne growing up) asks Wayne to say he didn't mean it, then throws what he had intended to give Wayne as a Christmas present at him. The gift—a toy sled that Wayne had wanted as a boy but was never able to get—prompts Wayne to reconcile with Noel and carry out the mission. Grace, watching the whole argument as it unfolds, learns a powerful lesson and a newfound appreciation for her younger brother.  The next morning, the scene at the Goodwin house shows Grace's toddler brother giving her her new Christmas present, a replacement toy for the one he had destroyed a year prior. Meanwhile, back at the North Pole, Wayne and Noel both win the title of "Elves of the Year" for their efforts and cooperation (although the headline of the local paper misprints Wayne's name as "Dwayne").

Precious Knowledge
   The film provides insight into the controversy in Tucson Arizona over the Mexican-American Studies (MAS), or Raza studies, program that occurred in 2008-2009. Beginning scenes look inside the personal lives of 3 students enrolled in Tucson High’s MAS program- Crystal Terriquez, Priscila Rodriguez and Gilbert Esparza. These inside looks reveal the struggles these students and their families face due to setbacks stemming from their race and socioeconomic backgrounds. Each student goes on to share how the MAS education program has positively influenced their educational experience and their lives at home.  In 1997, the Tucson school board unanimously voted to create a Hispanic Studies Department in all six of their schools, with the goal of lowering the Latino dropout rate. The department was renamed the Mexican American/ Raza studies program in 2002, and saw high levels of success in improving the achievement rates of Latinos. Tucson Unified School District reported that the students taking ethnic studies classes showed significant improvements on standardized tests and the graduation rate among these students averaged 93%.  The framework of the classes taught in the Raza studies program is based on a social justice pedagogy that centers around searching for the truth and the concept of love. The film takes a look inside the classroom of two Raza studies program teachers, Curtis Acosta who teaches literature, and Jose Gonzalez who teaches American Government. In their classes, Acosta and Gonzalez teach students about the history of their culture and then challenge them to reflect, realize and reconcile with their culture’s past. The classes also challenge students to become “warriors for their gente,” and to take action on issues they become aware of through the learning in their classes.  Gilbert Esparza shares how the MAS classes made him a more engaged student and he started getting better grades in all his classes. Crystal shares how she never spoke up in any of her classes, but now she is more vocal due to the confidence she gained from her teachers in the Raza studies program. Crystal’s mom also expresses how great of a change she saw in her daughter once she bagan classes in the MAS program. Priscila says she views her Raza studies classes as a second home and hates missing those classes.  Controversy arose surrounding the Raza studies program when Superintendent of schools, Tom Horne, announced that he would introduce a bill that would ban ethnic studies programs in the state of Arizona. Horne and other opponents of ethnic studies, argue that these programs promote racial divide amongst students in schools and is “in conflict with the values of American Citizenship.” Hornes bill (SB1108) initially passed through Arizona’s House Appropriations Committee but didn’t make it to the floor after Governor Janet Napolitano threatened to veto it, so a new bill (SB1069) to ban ethnic studies was introduced in the next legislative session. After a series of debates from both sides at the committee hearing, SB1069 passed and became scheduled for a vote before the full legislature.  SB 1069 fails to pass in front of the full legislature, but lawmakers continue to challenge the program’s legality; legislators propose two new bills, SB 1070 and HB 2281, which are partly aimed against the ethnic studies program. As these bills develop, producers display cameos from Raza Studies opponents and confrontations between advocates and critics of the MAS program.  To help decide if he would vote for HB 2281, Huppenthal accepts an invitation to Acosta’s class. During class time Huppenthal engages in discourse with students and faculty about his concerns with the MAS program. When Huppenthal asks why there is a poster of Che Guevara on the wall and not one of Benjamin Franklin, the program’s director states that Franklin was “against the inclusion of tawnian [dark skinned] people.” Huppenthal did not find his visit to Acosta’s class representative of a typical MAS program class, and thought this remark about Franklin was inappropriate. At the next Senate Education Committee voting session for the new bills, Huppenthal speaks about his experience in a MAS program class and HB 2281 is approved and sent to new Governor [[Jan Brewer]] for her signature. This leads to a student/teacher rally against HB 2281, at which the Tucson [[Brown Berets]] demonstrate their support for the MAS program.  At a press conference one week later, Tom Horne and Margaret Dugan criticize the Brown Berets for being revolutionary since they cover their faces with bandannas and sunglasses. Students, teachers, and community members then stage a sit-down at the state building where Horne and Dugan are holding the press conference. Four students and eleven adults are arrested for refusing to leave the state building. Despite their efforts, Governor Jan Brewer signed HB 2281 into law.  As the documentary concludes, producers film the last day of school in Acosta and Gonzalez’s classes. In Acosta’s class, the students and himself become very emotional about their year. Crystal, Priscila, and Gilbert are then filmed at their graduation ceremony. Priscila reveals that she will attend the University of Arizona, Crystal gets a tattoo of a hummingbird to remind her to stay active in her community, and Gilbert reflects on the lessons he has learned. Before the credits roll it is revealed that Tom Horne declared MAS program classes in violation of the law, so the TUSD cancelled the Raza Studies classes.  
The Prey (2011 film)
 After a successful heist, Franck Adrien and his partner are convicted and sent to prison. Adrien is the only one who knows the location of the stash, and he refuses to tell both his wife and his partner. However, despite his initially aloof relationship with Jean-Louis Maurel, Adrien comes to trust his cellmate and saves him from a savage beating by Russian mobsters. When Adrien's former partner puts him in the prison hospital, Maurel visits Adrien. Although Adrien does not trust Maurel enough to reveal the location of his stash, Adrien gives Maurel a hint to pass along to Anna, Adrien's wife, as Maurel is being released early due to his alleged victim recanting her charges of rape.  Adrien's peace of mind is ruined when Manuel Carrega, a member of the [[National Gendarmerie]], visits him and requests information on Maurel, whom he insists is a serial killer and rapist. When the Russian mobsters ambush Adrien in retaliation for his earlier intervention, Adrien overpowers both them and a corrupt guard, and he escapes from the prison by using the guard's uniform. While Adrien attempts to check on his family, he encounters Claire Linné, a rising star who has been reassigned to capture him. Gambling that she will not shoot an unarmed man, Adrien flees her custody and attempts to locate his family. Unable to find them, he checks his stash, where he finds his wife's corpse hidden.  Using a cell phone, Adrien briefly makes contact with Maurel, who assures him that his daughter Amélie is safe – but only so long as  Adrien stays away, as Christine, Maurel's wife, desires a child. Desperate, Adrien sneaks into Carrega's house and forces him at gunpoint to help him track down Maurel. Carrega reveals that he was dismissed from the Gendarmerie due to his obsession with Maurel, but, using his remaining contacts, he is able to find Maurel's last location. Meanwhile, Linné has come under increasing pressure to recapture Adrien now that Maurel has framed him. She hesitates once again when she finds Adrien at Carrega's house, and she is demoted to desk duty. Adrien does not escape unscathed, and he is shot in the side when Carrega returns to rescue him.  Carrega is critically injured when he breaks a police barricade, and he urges Adrien to abandon him. Adrien tracks Maurel on foot, and Linné researches Adrien, Carrega, and Maurel, whom she comes to believe is responsible for a recent rape. Her superior mocks her "feminine intuition" and refuses to investigate Maurel, so Linné confronts him alone. Adrien and Linné converge on Maurel's house at the same time, and Linné chooses to trust Adrien over Maurel during a standoff. Maurel wounds Linné and chases after Adrien, who has escaped with Amélie. Before Maurel can finish off Adrien, Linné kills Maurel. However, the father of one of Maurel's victims shoots Adrien in the mistaken belief that Adrien is the rapist. Adrien falls off a cliff and  disappears. In the epilogue, Amélie receives a letter that is implied to be from her father.

The Prodigies (film)
 Ten-year-old Jimbo Farrar is a gifted child who is misunderstood and regularly beaten by his parents. One day he is badly beaten by his father while his mother cheers him on, and Jimbo gets carried away by his anger and loses control of his abilities. When he wakes, up he finds his mother's body on the floor, as she had been beaten to death by his father, who then hanged himself, all under the control of Jimbo. He is then sent away to a mental hospital, where Jimbo is visited by multi-billionaire Mr. Killian, who decides to take him under his wing to help him control his abilities.  Twenty years later, Jimbo has become a brilliant researcher in the Killian Foundation for Gifted Children, married to Ann with whom they are due to have a child. Jimbo has only one goal: to find young children who, like him, possess supernatural powers. Thus, he created an extremely complex online game in the hopes that he'll be able to identify any such people around the United States. One night, five unrelated teenagers pass the game and hack Jimbo's computer. In desperation, Jimbo shuts his computer down and restarts it, only to find a message on his screen with the words: "Where Are You?". Jimbo immediately sets out to find them and bring them to the Foundation, but on his return he learns of the death of Killian. The Foundation therefore passes onto Melanie, Killian's daughter, who plans with Jenkins - her second-in-command - to end Jimbo's game and instead work on a TV show. In order to save the game - and the possibility of locating more "Prodigies" - Jimbo has the idea of combining the ideas: create a large-scale televised competition to reveal future geniuses. The show, American Genius, is launched, and five teenagers are announced as participants - hand-picked by Jimbo, having met and identified them as "Prodigies": Gil, an abused child; Liza, a young girl trained to be a top model; Lee, a young Asian who helps her parents in their trade; Harry, an African-American whose mother wastes all her money in Paris; and Sammy, the only son of a wealthy family and physical ungrateful.  The five are identified immediately and Jimbo arranges to meet with them in secret in Central Park. No sooner are the teenagers gathered than two thugs assault and rape Liza. Jimbo, however, is not there: he has just learned that Ann is pregnant. He learns of the teenagers' situation too late and, by the time he arrives at the park, Liza is missing and the other four are on the floor, unconscious. However, through Liza’s agony while she is being raped, her pain is telepathically extended to the other four teenagers and Jimbo, who unconsciously drive out the thugs using mind-controlling abilities of their own. As soon as Jimbo recovers his senses, he hurries to Liza and finds her in a coma. The next day he learns that Melanie wants to cover up the crime, in order to preserve the TV show, by claiming Liza was injured by a hit-and-run driver. Furious, Jimbo violently demands an explanation, and his anger almost makes him lose control of his abilities. After this, he vows to protect the other four, and locks himself away in his office with his computer, afraid because of how he had almost lost control like in the day of the death of his parents. Meanwhile, under the leadership of Gil, the five teenagers infiltrate the archives of the Killian group, where they find video recordings of Jimbo during his sessions in the mental hospital. Here he talks about his feelings of isolation caused by his supernatural abilities, as well as the possibility of others like him being out there. The mention of him bringing them all together to avenge themselves for all the years of mistreatment entices Gil, Sammy, Lee and Harry to bring justice upon Liza’s attackers, which they do by brutally killing them as well as the officer, who helped cover up the crime, and his wife using their powers.  When Jimbo learns of this, he is very alarmed. Furthermore, Melanie refuses to recognize the truth if only to let the TV show continue, meanwhile the teenagers are demanding justice. However, one evening, as he tries to reason with the teenagers, they turn against him. Doubting his trust, they put him to the test by ordering him to kill Jenkins. Jimbo, who had made a promise to Killian never to use his power in such a way, refuses. The teenagers go on to make Jenkins beat up Jimbo (once again with their abilities) and kill Jenkins, then frame Jimbo for his murder. Although Jimbo initially attempts to explain to the policemen the truth about his and the teenagers’ superpowers, the policemen don’t believe him, particularly due his supposed history of having schizophrenia. Jimbo eventually relents and is sent to prison, where he is kept under surveillance. In the meantime, Gil, Harry, Lee and Sammy make plans for causing large-scale destruction upon the United States, under the belief that this will exact justice for all the pain they had been subject to in the past. Shortly afterwards, Liza comes out of her coma, and Ann visits her to ask her for help, for she now knows of Jimbo’s abilities from the police interview, as well as the teenagers’ plans to infiltrate the White House to launch nuclear weapons. However, Ann angers Liza, who loses control of her powers and almost kills Ann’s baby. In a desperate attempt to prevent the imminent destruction the other teenagers plan on causing, Ann reluctantly seeks help from Melanie, the organiser of the final of American Genius, which will take place in the White House, include the four teenagers plus another fifth contestant, and be attended by the President of the United States. When Jimbo learns of Liza harming Ann, he uses his powers to break free from prison and joins Liza to reach the other teenagers, as well as Melanie and Ann, at the White House.  On site, when she and Jimbo are attempting to sneak into the White House, they are halted by guards and Liza uses her powers for the two of them to escape. This triggering an alarm and initiates a security procedure where everybody in the Oval Office (including the finalists of American Genius) must get to safety in a security bunker. But once inside and all exits are sealed, the four gifted teenagers manipulate the soldiers and bodyguards into killing each other, and Melanie is shot dead under Gil’s will. Gil then begins the attacks by launching a nuke at Killian University, where Jimbo and Killian worked. Ann’s life is spared when Sammy raises the possibility that her child, being Jimbo’s as well, might also be a "golden child". Jimbo eventually arrives at the bunker with Liza, where he learns that Gil is the one leading the group into attacking the US. A fight ensues where Gil attacks Ann and Jimbo fights to protect her, until the fifth contestant fires a gun at Gil when Jimbo is at the verge of being killed. But Jimbo, anticipating the bullet, pushes Gil away and instead receives the bullet in his heart. While Jimbo lies in Ann’s arms, dying, Gil horribly attacks Liza for her refusal to cooperate with him, which brings Harry to his senses and convinces his friends to stop all the madness of attacking and killing masses of people across the United States. And so, while one controls Gil in order to prevent him from stopping them, Harry cancels the nuclear attack, saving Killian University by seconds. Shortly afterwards, Jimbo takes his final breath.  Three months later, Killian’s company has gone bankrupt. Ann, still pregnant, receives a package containing Jimbo’s phone (which he had lost in the fight at the White House), which has a final video message from Jimbo. Ann does not know it was left by Liza, who has disappeared from the radar along with Harry, Sammy, Lee and Gil. Liza, Harry, Sammy and Lee now search for other gifted people like themselves, using Jimbo’s game, but Gil now continues with his journey on his own, and it seems that he is plotting dark schemes.

Prom (film)
  It's time for the annual prom. Nova Prescott ([[Aimee Teegarden]]) is on the prom committee with her friends Mei Kwan ([[Yin Chang]]), Ali Gomez (Janelle Ortiz), Brandon Roberts ([[Jonathan Keltz]]) and Rolo Banus ([[Joe Adler]]). They made all of the decorations and are finally prepared. Nova hopes Brandon, whom she has a crush on, will ask her to go to the prom. The prom is both something to look forward to and a source of worry. Lloyd Taylor ([[Nicholas Braun]]) complains to his stepsister Tess Torres ([[Raini Rodriguez]]) that he has no date, but Tess recommends to ask anybody, it does not matter who. Mei discovered by now that she has been accepted at a different university than her boyfriend Justin Wexler ([[Jared Kusnitz]]), and worries about telling him as prom approaches. Lucas Arnaz ([[Nolan Sotillo]]) has been in love with his lab partner Simone ([[Danielle Campbell]]), and turns to his friend Corey Doyle ([[Cameron Monaghan]]) to help him ask her to the prom. The only one who does not care about the prom is Jesse Richter ([[Thomas McDonell]]). He plays truant, rides his motorcycle across the schoolyard, and behaves as if nothing matters. Principal Dunnan ([[Jere Burns]]) tries to talk to him but does not get through to him.  Meanwhile, Jordan Lundley ([[Kylie Bunbury]]) finds an earring in the car of her boyfriend, Tyler Barso ([[DeVaughn Nixon]]) but he assures her that he's not cheating. He shows how much he cares for her by taking her on a romantic date inside of the shed with the prom decorations, and asking her to the prom. Unfortunately, they forget to blow out a candle after their departure and it sets the shed and the decorations ablaze. With only three weeks left, Nova is forced to make all new props, but her friends are too busy with other things and can not help her. The principal gives Jesse a choice, either he helps Nova with the decorations, or he can't graduate. Jesse accepts reluctantly, as does Nova. They realize that they need each other. While Brandon deeply disappoints Nova by not asking her to the prom, she and Jesse grow closer, despite the fact that Jesse finds the idea of prom ridiculous. When Nova discovers that the prom theme of the neighboring school is the same as theirs, Jesse decides to sneak into their school and see how their decorations compare. Unfortunately while trespassing, the security guard notices them and the police catch them after they escape.  The police call Nova's parents and when Nova's father arrives he gets extremely mad at Jesse.   Meanwhile, Lloyd still cannot find a date. He gets frustrated and desperate. Lucas asks Simone to a barbecue of his friend Tyler. Tyler tries to talk and flirt with her and she rejects him, because he is dating Jordan. Simone tells Lucas she wouldn't have gone if she had known it was Tyler's party. It seems that Tyler and Simone have a past. Meanwhile, the stress in Mei and Justin's relationship reaches the breaking point, and Mei cancels on Justin for fear of telling him about her acceptance. At school, Lucas blows off Corey to spend more time with Simone, and asks her to study for the upcoming test with him, to which she agrees. However, as she is about to go to library, Simone is stopped by Tyler, who convinces her to talk with him. He tells her about his feelings for her. Jordan sees the two talking and immediately grasps the situation. After school, Nova apologizes to Jesse for her dad's behavior. Later, she brings him along as she goes dress shopping, for a second opinion. Back at school, Simone apologizes to Lucas for having ditched him. She has a surprise, tickets to a concert, where Stick Hippo (his and Corey's favorite band) is opening. Lucas wants to take Simone instead of Corey, much to Corey's dismay. Jordan dumps Tyler for his unfaithfulness, and decides to go to prom alone. This prompts him to ask Simone to prom, which is the same night as the concert, and she agrees. Simone tells Lucas that she is sorry, but she cannot go to the concert.  Mei apologizes to Justin for her behaviour and tells him the truth, but instead of feeling hurt that she is going to a different college, he tells her he is proud of her. They agree that they should still go to prom together. As Lloyd gets rejected by another girl, he spots Lucas sitting outside the school, looking dejected. He learns his situation, and tells Lucas his own mistake with girls and high school. Lloyd tells Lucas that if he really loves Simone, then he should tell her. Two nights before the prom, Nova, Ali, and Mei are in Nova's room, talking. Nova confesses to them that she has feelings for Jesse, which her dad unfortunately overhears. The next day, Nova's father tells Jesse he cannot ask Nova to prom, because he is "bringing her down". That afternoon, Jesse is unusually hostile towards Nova and deserts her. On prom night, Lucas climbs a tree to reach Simone's window. He tells her how he feels and begs her not to go to prom, but she goes anyway. Disappointed, Lucas realizes what a bad friend he has been to Corey, and offers him the other concert ticket. The two head off to see their favorite band happily.   At her house, Nova is heartbroken, and refuses to pose for the camera in her prom dress. Her father, worried, explains that he was the one who told Jesse not to ask her to prom. Angered, Nova storms out of the house. Meanwhile, at Lloyd's house, it is revealed that he is taking his sister to prom. At Jesse's house, his mother has a talk with him, and he realizes that he should still take Nova to prom. At the school, Tyler leads Simone into the building, and almost immediately abandons her. Simone finds out from a couple of girls that it was actually Jordan who dumped Tyler, and Tyler had gone to her with no other option. As Tyler and Jordan are pronounced prom king and queen, Jordan refuses to participate in the king-and-queen dance. When Tyler asks Simone to dance, she refuses and leaves. She goes to the concert parking lot, where she waits for Lucas, and they share a dance. Nova is having an awful time at prom, and when Ali tells her the fountain centerpiece is broken, she cannot take it any more. As she is about to leave, she hears the fountain start again, and knows the only person who could have fixed it was Jesse. He walks up to her and asks her to prom. She agrees, and they dance followed by a kiss.

The Pruitt-Igoe Myth
  The film begins with a former resident of the [[Pruitt–Igoe]] public housing complex returning to the site of the buildings in the north side of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and noting that in spite of the decades since the planned demolition of the buildings, the site remains largely vacant.  It continues by detailing the decision by the city to replace 19th century [[tenement]] housing with high-rise [[public housing]], ultimately designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]] (later the famed designer of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]) in the [[modernism|modernist]] style as thirty-three 11-floor buildings.<ref name=nytimes1> {{cite web  | author= Michael Kimmelman  | title= Towers of Dreams: One Ended in Nightmare  | publisher= The New York Times  | date= 2012-01-25  | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/arts/design/penn-south-and-pruitt-igoe-starkly-different-housing-plans.html  | accessdate= 2013-07-06 }} </ref>  Interviews with former residents, archival images, and film are used to tell first impressions about moving into Pruitt-Igoe and the steady deterioration of living conditions during the 1960s and early 1970s before the destruction by [[Building implosion|planned implosion]] between 1972 and 1976.<ref name=nytimes1/><ref name=economist1> {{cite web  | author= Prospero Books, arts and culture  | title= American public housing: Why the Pruitt-Igoe housing project failed  | publisher= The Economist  | date= 2011-10-15  | url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/10/american-public-housing  | accessdate= 2013-07-06 }} </ref>  The film takes issue with the various explanations for the failure of the Pruitt-Igoe complex that have developed since its demolition, including that it was the fault of the modernist theory of architecture itself (an explanation developed by architectural historian [[Charles Jencks]]<ref> {{cite book  | last= Jencks  | first= Charles  | authorlink= Charles Jencks  | title= The Language of Post-Modern Architecture  | year= 1984  | publisher= Rizzoli  | location= New York  | isbn= 978-0-8478-0571-6  | page= 9 }} </ref>) or of the general concept of public housing.

Puss in Boots (2011 film)
 [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] ([[Antonio Banderas]]) is a talking cat named for his signature pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive on the run from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) and Jill ([[Amy Sedaris]]) have the magic beans he's been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws ([[Salma Hayek]]) interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his [[origin story]] and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.  The trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror, a giant goose that guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a [[Goose|gosling]], and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.  When Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to San Ricardo where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be arrested, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty were involved in the con. After pleas from Imelda, his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero.  While in prison, Puss meets the original Jack from "[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]" who warns him that the Great Terror is in fact the Goose's mother, and it will stop at nothing to get its child back. Realizing Humpty intended to destroy the town all along, Puss lets a repentant Kitty help him break out of prison and she also tells him she loves him. Tracking him down just as the Great Terror arrives, Puss convinces Humpty to help him fight off the Great Terror, saying he knows Humpty is a good person at heart. Using the Goose as bait, Puss and Humpty lure the Great Terror out of the town. During the chase, Jack and Jill betray Humpty and try to take the Goose, but get crushed by the Great Terror. Humpty and the Goose are knocked off a bridge with Puss holding onto them. Humpty knows Puss cannot hold both of them, so he lets go, sacrificing himself to save the Goose and the town. Humpty's shell cracks open to reveal he was a golden egg on the inside. The Great Terror then takes the Goose and Humpty back to the giant's castle.  Puss' efforts to save San Ricardo make him a hero among the townspeople and Imelda. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries, Humpty is shown once again in his regular egg form, wearing a golden egg suit, as he rides the Great Terror into the clouds, and Puss and Kitty kiss.

Cetto also owns a campsite, wrongly named "Paradais Village" instead of "Paradise Village", a very poor and shabby place. During the meeting, his friends also tell him about his hated neighbour De Santis's intention to run for Mayor of Marina di Sopra, to improve the economic and cultural plight of the people, since almost every of them is poor peasants. Hearing this news, Cetto decides to run for Mayor of the town. He does everything possible to be voted by the people of the town, but his ignorance and narrow-mindedness does not impress journalists and reporters, so Cetto is forced to call a manager, Gerry Salerno, from [[Bari]] but living most recently in [[Milan]]. Cetto just sees it as a repentant Mafia since he left the South of Italy to go to the North, because even today in Italy there is still a lot of hatred among the citizens who live in the North and those who are in the South. Cetto begins the campaign with Gerry, using tricks, cheating and deceit against the ignorant people of Marina di Sopra.  Meanwhile, Cetto also tries to make his son a man, forcing him to leave his girlfriend because she is not curvy enough; together the two of them go hunting illegally in protected areas, shoot at mannequins that resemble black men, and finally he makes Melo have sex with his favorite prostitute. Whatever the right arm with his friend John "The Stranger" (as Cetto is the Calabria while he was the [[Apulia]]) divorces his wife Carmen and plans to marry his new girlfriend from South America, and then sends to jail son Melo. In fact, the policeman Cavallaro is by years trying to send to jail Cetto, because of his abusive homes and its contacts with the Mafia, but he had no proof, and when he discovers that Cetto has a building permit of his pizzeria, this abusive comes into the house to arrest him, but Cetto has changed the document to the local making his son the owner and sending him to prison. This way, he has the opportunity to continue his campaign. Meanwhile, his wife Carmen believes her husband to be a real heartless monster and leaves, while Cetto is preparing to hold its election speech in the square, and he promises procurement and abolition of taxes, but also guarantees the arrival of many prostitutes that he commonly nicknamed "pilu" (female pubic hair, south Italian slang for "pussy"). Thanks to Gerry and corruption of the reporter Calogero, Cetto knocks the good intentions of De Santis and is elected mayor of Marina di Sopra. While he's partying, Gerry leaves Italy and brings with him the Brazilian girl to give her a dignified life and to provide the little daughter a good education.  
Quarantine 2: Terminal
  Directly after the events of ''[[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'', on a flight from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], one of the passengers, Ralph Bundt becomes violent and attempts to enter the cockpit, demanding he be let off the plane. Ralph had been bitten by a hamster which is really a lab rat, brought onto the plane by Henry (Josh Cooke) for his school students. Ralph is restrained, but not before he bites one of the flight attendants, Paula, on the face, much to the horror of her friend Jenny (Mercedes Mason). Disobeying orders, Captain Forrest and his co-pilot Willsy find a jetway operated by a baggage handler Ed Ramirez (Ignacio Serricchio). Everyone escapes from the plane, except for the elderly couple Bev Stevens and her paralyzed mute husband Doc Stevens, and the pilots, who try to keep the violent Ralph contained in an aircraft bathroom. However, they learn that they have been locked out of the airport. Soon, armed soldiers and what appear to be [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] scientists surround the terminal. Ed shows them a door that will lead them to tarmac level but it is locked.  One of the passengers, a military medic named Shilah Washington (Noree Victoria), reveals she has a medical kit in her bag in the plane's cargo hold. Jenny, Henry, Ed, Niall, and Preston sneak back into the plane to retrieve it, to find that Ralph has escaped from the bathroom, whereabouts unknown. Preston retrieves Doc and waits outside. They retrieve Shilah's kit and Niall's handgun and try to leave the hold. While in the plane, Jenny is attacked by an infected Captain Forrest and Niall shoots and kills him, but it seems that some of the captain's blood had gotten into Niall's eye. As they are leaving, they find Preston's body, and an infected Bev who tries to attack the group before they escape. When they meet up with the rest of the group, they begin to realize that the infection is probably a form of [[rabies]] spread through bites. Doc is bitten on the head by an infected rat and the group decide to lock him and Paula away to prevent further infection. George (Mattie Liptak), an unaccompanied minor, accuses Henry of being responsible for the infection by bringing rats onto the plane. Jenny talks to Henry and asks if George's accusations are true. When Henry tells Jenny that George is just confused, they reconcile, and are then attacked by the escaped Ralph. With the help of Ed and Shilah, Jenny and Henry kill Ralph by strangling him.  A team of four heavily armed officers administer drugs to the group, and release the infected passengers from their confinement. Before she can receive the drugs, an elderly woman named Louise Treadwell, is bitten by her infected cat. Doc, also infected, bites one of the officials. After shooting Doc, the officers and a passenger named Hvorst attempt to evacuate but are shot and killed by personnel outside the doors, leaving Hvorst's partner, Nicca, distraught. Ed drags one surviving officer back inside, and the group hides in a catering truck from the infected. When they reach the catering truck, the passengers realize Niall is infected, and he grabs and attacks his wife Susan, as the rest of the group is shut inside the truck. The group question the wounded officer, who reveals that he does not represent the CDC but rather the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]'s anti-biological terrorism division called Chemical Biological Domestic Terrorism (C.B.D.T.). He tells them about a quarantined building in Los Angeles that housed a lab for a group of [[Bioterrorism|bioterrorists]] and confirms that the drugs are experimental antidotes, which Shilah had strongly suspected. The wounded officer grabs Niall's gun from Henry and kills himself. While in the truck, Ed remembers that the building has an old drainage tunnel beneath them, but is attacked by co-pilot Willsy from the roof of the truck. George pushes a button to raise the truck and Willsy is crushed to death.  With Henry remaining in the truck, the rest of the survivors access the tunnel, though Nicca is attacked and dragged away. Jenny comes face to face with an infected Paula, whom she kills  by pushing her off of a high walkway. They reach the engineer's office and start looking for the blueprints of the tunnel, until an infected Niall and Susan attack. Henry reappears and kills them to save the group, while also revealing he has been bitten.  George confronts him with suspicious evidence concerning viruses and maps that he found in Henry's briefcase, to which Henry admits to having been a part of the terrorist cell at the apartment building, who have planned a worldwide plague. Ed attempts to grab Henry's gun and Henry shoots and kills him. While administering himself with the antidote, Henry elaborates that he is part of a bioterrorist group that believes the human population needs to be culled in a plague. Henry kidnaps George and plans to use him as a human shield, in case of attack. Jenny tries to stop him, but is hit in the head with his gun.  Shilah and Jenny are then separated and Jenny encounters the infected Preston, but manages to knock him out. Shilah finds Jenny again, but has been bitten already. As Jenny escapes, Shilah allows herself to be attacked by the rest of the infected to give Jenny a better chance of survival. Jenny finds George near the drainage tunnel, where he tells her that Henry's antidote has failed and that Henry is now infected and mutating into a rat-like humanoid. When Jenny climbs down to George, Henry attacks her, causing the thermal vision goggles fall to the ground in front of George, who puts them on and shoots Henry. A wounded Henry is finally finished off with a steel pipe by Jenny.  Jenny and George crawl through the access tunnel where Jenny slows down slowly. George notices that she has been bitten through the [[Thermography|thermal vision goggles]] and says he will not leave without her. Jenny tells him to go but he persists and eventually she goes with him but slows down on purpose to give him time as she is already infected and visible signs of rabies are seen. As George makes it out of the access tunnel first and out of the perimeter of the airport and through vertical bars due to his small body, he calls out to Jenny before she appears at the barred exit, with full signs of infection seen: red eyes, blood dripping from mouth and all [[orifices]], and screams incoherently. George then takes the goggles off before throwing them down, leaving Jenny.   Through the thermal vision goggles, an infected cat is seen walking past and in the distance to the [[Luxor Las Vegas]].

The PyraMMMid
 Russia, early 1990's. Sergei Mamontov is looking for where to apply himself and his intellect. And so he orders a mock-up of a [[Security (finance)|security paper]] with imperial script, rich ornament, watermarks and his own portrait in the center.  An active advertising campaign begins. A little more than two weeks is enough to make people lined up for the "mamonts". Powerful bankers and state structures are in confusion – no one has a clue how to stop it, and the [[MMM (Ponzi scheme company)|MMM]] has already accumulated more than 10 million investors.  Furthermore, Mamontov is concerned that there are no rich people in the country, and all Soviet industry is exposed to [[privatization]]. He accumulates "private greed" and decides to make honest privatization. His way is blocked by the agent of Western imperialism - Belyavsky (an allusion to [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]) with his MegaVAZ-bank (an allusion to LogoVAZ). Belyavsky comes from the top - he makes connections in the Kremlin and is in charge of television. Belyavsky proposes to share Russia. Mamontov refuses: "I do not trade with Russia!", which attracts the financial inspectorate, who, without checking documents, imposes unthinkable demands for paying taxes upon him, which Mamontov executes. There is still enough money to ruin the bank of Belyavsky. In the country by that time are already 20 million investors and every week the number increases by a million, the "mamont" goes on par with ruble. Mamontov threatens to seize power with the help of investors who are facing ruin. During a one-minute audience with the President, Mamontov appears as a guardian for the state amid a corrupt environment and asks for a change in the law - to allow foreigners to be involved in their financial system in order to subordinate the Western oligarchy and thereby make Yeltsin's Russia leader of the world. But Belyavsky begins to threaten the life of Mamontov's daughter and he eventually falls into a trap. On the Ostankino Tower, the battered Mamontov again refuses to cooperate with Belyavsky, despite the proposed opportunity to become the "head of state". Mamontov hopes to leave with his daughter, defending himself by having a recording of a conversation with a representative of the [[Federal Counterintelligence Service|FCS]] (where he offered similar "privileges"), from his assistant Vera, but she, escaping from the people of Belyavsky, drops the recording in a park and on charges of non-payment of taxes, Mamontov gets in prison and comes out after 7 years.  
Ra.One
 Jenny Nair ([[Shahana Goswami]]), an employee of London-based company Barron Industries, introduces a new technology that allows objects from the digital world to enter the real world using the wireless transmissions from multiple devices. Shekhar Subramanium ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]), a game designer who also works at Barron Industries, has delivered a number of commercial failures; an irate Barron ([[Dalip Tahil]]) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek ([[Armaan Verma]]), and upon the request of his wife Sonia ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the [[antagonist]] should be more powerful than the [[protagonist]]. His colleague, [[computer programmer]] Jenny uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) (Technically ''Good One'' and in Hindi ''Jeevan'', which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically ''Random Access Version One'' and in Hindi ''[[Ravana|Ravan]]'', a mythical demon)<ref name=sss></ref> is made faceless. Another colleague, her boyfriend, Aakaashi ([[Tom Wu]]), implements the characters' movements. The game, named ''Ra.One'', contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device – the ''H.A.R.T'' (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.  When ''Ra.One'' undergoes final tests, Aakaashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID ''Lucifer'' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Aakaashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] to malfunction. Aakaashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Aakaashi is murdered by Ra.One meanwhile, and Ra.One assumes his appearance; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his [[identity card]]. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.  Sonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Jenny of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world.  Having killed Aakaashi's mother viciously at her house and assumed and accepted Aakaashi's guise to mask his intentions, Ra.One chases Prateek and Sonia  on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that she needs him.  Subsequently, Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model ([[Arjun Rampal]]), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form (having previously impersonated Aakaashi) to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning [[Mumbai Suburban Railway|local train]]. The train crashes into the [[Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus]], but G.One saves Sonia and others in time. To save Prateek, he returns to the virtual world and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached, leaving Ra.One helpless; furious, the latter creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: "''If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you''". The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, absorbs Ra.One's remains and disappears.  Six months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where the former manages to restore G.One to the real world.

As another investigation into Brown heats up, he goes to a hotel and blackmails the concierge into giving him a room by threatening to arrest the concierge for running a prostitution ring in the hotel. Next, he blackmails a pharmacist into giving him an assortment of drugs.  When he meets with Hartshorn to give him a cut of the money from the card game, Brown asks for the source of Hartshorn's tip about the game. He suspects that he was set up again. Hartshorn refuses to name his source. Brown then meets with General in a parking lot to make sure that he will not testify about witnessing the shooting. The next day, an investigator with the District Attorney, Kyle Timkins (Cube) surveils Brown, who confronts him. Brown insists that he is not a racist, merely a misanthrope.  Brown grows increasingly paranoid and reliant on drugs as the pressure on him mounts. When he meets with Hartshorn again, he pulls a gun and accuses Hartshorn of setting him up. The elderly man scuffles with Brown a little bit and then has a heart attack. Instead of calling an ambulance, Brown leaves him to die. Back at the hotel, Brown's two daughters drop off some dry cleaning at his room, and he confesses to his younger daughter that everything she has heard about him is true.  Brown summons Timkins to a meeting and tapes a confession in front of him. He admits that he has been a dirty cop, and that in 1987, he killed a business acquaintance. He justified the murder because he knew the man was a serial rapist, which is why he got away with the extrajudicial killing. Timkins refuses the confession, insisting that he will arrest Brown for his most recent murder. The film ends with Brown revisiting his family and staring at his elder daughter on the front porch before disappearing into the night.

The Raid (2011 film)
 [[Mobile Brigade (Indonesia)|Special tactics officer]] Rama [[Salah|prays]], practices ''[[Silat]]'', and bids goodbye to his father and wife who is pregnant with his child. He cryptically promises his father he'll "bring him home." Rama joins a heavily armed 20-man elite police squad, including officers Bowo, Dagu, Sergeant Jaka and Lieutenant Wahyu, for a raid on an apartment block in [[Jakarta]]'s slums. The team intends to eliminate crime lord Tama Riyadiwho, with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block letting criminals and junkies around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another lookout just before he's shot dead by Lt. Wahyu; the latter youth raises the alarm.  Tama calls reinforcements and the team is brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the van, and ambush the officers patrolling the first five floors. Cutting the lights, Tama announces over the [[Public address system|PA system]] that the police are trapped on the sixth-floor stairwell, and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders. In the darkness, the remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above, and almost completely wiped out. Prior to the gunfight, Lt. Wahyu confesses to Jaka he staged the mission so he can eliminate Tamawho's in league with corrupt police officials, including himself. The mission is not officially sanctioned by police command; nobody at HQ knows their location and there is no hope for reinforcements.  The surviving officers retreat to an empty apartment as they are cornered by more armed thugs. To create an escape route, Rama uses an axe to cut a hole in the wooden floor so the team can descend to the lower level. Dropping to the room below, the team struggles to fend off Tama's horde of thugs and Officer Bowo is critically injured in the process. In a last-ditch effort to defend his team, Rama uses a stove [[propane tank]] to construct an [[improvised explosive device]] that successfully eliminates the invading henchmen, giving the officers a small window of time. Out of ammunition, and with more of Tama's reinforcements approaching, the team splits into two groups: Jaka, Dagu and Lt. Wahyu retreat to the fifth floor, while Rama and a critically injured Bowo ascend back above in search of the law-abiding tenant they encountered earlier.  Fighting through a handful of goons on their way to apartment #726, Rama pleads with the tenant for help; despite his sick wife's protest, Gofar reluctantly hides the officers in his apartment. Five machete-wielding thugs arrive and ransack the man's home. The leader, noticing a refurbished wall, begins stabbing it but fail to find them. After tending to Bowo's wounds, Rama leaves him with the couple to search for Jaka's group. Crossing paths with the machete gang he runs to the eighth floor but is cornered. He defeats the group, including their leader, who he uses to smash through a window and cushion a three story plummet onto a fire escape below. Exhausted, he makes his way to the sixth floor before being grabbed by Andi, who had just murdered two of Tama's men in the elevator. Andi is revealed to be his estranged brother, who Rama signed up for the mission to search for at the urging of their father. Rama refuses to leave the building without his comrades, and Andi refuses to abandon his auspicious criminal life, "Just because you see what I do as wrong doesn't mean I can't be good at it." Rama parts to search for his surviving colleagues.  Mad Dog discovers Jaka and his group hiding on the fourth floor. As Lt. Wahyu runs off, Jaka instructs Dagu to "protect him," while Jaka is left at Mad Dog's gunpoint. Instead of shooting him, Mad Dog challenges Jaka to a hand-to-hand fight which he ultimately wins and proceeds to snap Jaka's neck, killing him. Mad Dog meets up with Andi to report back to Tama in the surveillance room. Tama, having learned of Andi's treachery, incapacitates Andi and hands him over to Mad Dog for torture and execution. Rama regroups with Dagu and Lt. Wahyu in apartment #403. They make their way up, fighting through a narcotics lab, as they head for Tama on the 15th floor. Along the way, Rama discovers the room where Mad Dog is torturing Andi, causing him to separate from Dagu and Wahyu. Mad Dog lets Rama free Andi, and fights both brothers. He initially has the upper hand, but the brothers prove to be a match when working together. Following an intense and grueling battle, Rama kills Mad Dog with Andi's help.  Meanwhile, Lt. Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama after killing off his remaining henchman. However, Lt. Wahyu ends up betraying Dagu by shooting him in the face before taking Tama hostage, intending to use him as a shield to escape. When the duo encounter Rama and Andi as they're going down stairs, Tama taunts Wahyu revealing that he had already been waiting for them before the raid began and Lt. Wahyu was [[Frameup|set-up]] by his corrupt higher-ups; indicating that he will be killed regardless of escaping. In despair, Lt. Wahyu kills Tama and attempts suicide, only to find he has no ammunition left.  Andi uses his influence to allow Rama to leave with the injured Bowo and a detained Lt. Wahyu. Gofar, who protected Bowo, watches from a window grinning with relief. Andi also hands over emergency blackmail recordings Tama made of corrupt officials he dealt with, telling him to contact Officer [[The Raid 2#Cast|Bunawar]]. Rama asks Andi to come home, but Andi refuses due to his acclimation to his criminal lifestyle. Andi asserts he can protect Rama in his role as a gang boss, but that Rama can't do the same for him. As he turns around and walks back to the apartment block, the trio exit to an uncertain future.

Rango (2011 film)
  A pet [[chameleon]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) becomes stranded in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Nevada]] after his [[Vivarium|terrarium]] falls from his owners' car by accident. He meets an [[armadillo]] named Roadkill ([[Alfred Molina]]) who is seeking the mystical "Spirit of the West". While wandering the desert, he narrowly avoids being eaten by a vicious [[red-tailed hawk]] before meeting the [[desert iguana]] Beans ([[Isla Fisher]]). Beans takes him to Dirt, an [[American frontier|Old West]] town populated by desert animals.  The chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named "Rango". He quickly runs afoul of outlaw [[Gila monster]] Bad Bill ([[Ray Winstone]]) but avoids a shootout when Bill is scared off by the hawk's return. Rango is chased by the hawk until he accidentally knocks down an empty water tower which crushes the predator. The town mayor ([[Ned Beatty]]), an elderly [[tortoise]], appoints Rango as the new sheriff. Meanwhile, the townsfolk worry that with the hawk dead, the gunslinger Rattlesnake Jake ([[Bill Nighy]]), who is afraid of hawks, will return.  After discovering Dirt's water reserves—stored in the town bank inside a water cooler bottle—to be near empty, a skeptical Beans demands Rango investigate where the water has gone. That night, Rango inadvertently assists a trio of bank robbers, led by a [[mole (animal)|mole]] named Balthazar ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]), mistaking them for prospectors. The townsfolk find their water bottle stolen the next morning, so Rango organizes a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]]. During the search, they find the banker, Mr Merrimack ([[Stephen Root]]) in the middle of the desert dead, but oddly the cause of his death was drowning. The posse tracks the robbers to their hideout. They fight Balthazar's bat-riding clan over the stolen water bottle before discovering it to be empty. The robbers profess that they found it empty, but the posse brings them to town to put them in jail while the citizens want to lynch them.  Rango confronts the mayor about his buying of the land around Dirt, but the mayor denies any wrongdoing and shows Rango that he is building a modern city with the purchased land. The mayor then summons Rattlesnake Jake, who forces Rango to admit that he lied to the townsfolk and runs him out of town. Rango returns to the road where he fell from the car, crosses to the other side, and passes out.   Rango wakes and meets the Spirit of the West ([[Timothy Olyphant]]), whom Rango identifies as the [[Man with No Name]]. After telling him what he did to the citizens of Dirt, the Spirit tells Rango that he must go back and set things right, telling him that "No man can walk out on his own story."  With the aid of Roadkill and mystical moving [[yucca schidigera|yuccas]], Rango learns that Dirt's water supply is controlled by an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], which the mayor has been manipulating to cause a water shortage so he could buy the land. Rango returns to Dirt to challenge Jake to a duel, a diversion so the yuccas can turn the pipeline's valve to flood the town. Rango then holds Jake at gunpoint and makes clear his resolve. The mayor, however, forces Rango to surrender by threatening Beans' life and locks them inside the glass bank vault to drown. He then tries to shoot Jake with Rango's gun, intending to kill Jake along with the rest of the Old West, but the gun is empty. Rango has taken the bullet, which he uses to crack the glass and shatter the vault, freeing himself and Beans. Impressed, Jake salutes Rango and drags the mayor into the desert. The citizens of Dirt celebrate the return of the water and recognize Rango as their hero.

Real Steel
  In 2020, human boxers are replaced by [[robot]]s. Charlie Kenton, a former boxer, owns "Ambush", but loses it in a fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner Ricky, who rigged the fight to mess with Charlie as he sees him as a joke, partially because he beat him up the last time they competed for bailing on the bet. Having made a bet that Ambush would win as a result, Charlie now has a debt to Ricky that he can't pay—which he runs out on.  After the fight, Charlie learns that his ex-girlfriend died and he must attend a hearing deciding the future of their son, Max Kenton, whom Charlie has had almost zero contact with and complete apathy towards since he was born. There, Max's aunt, Debra, and her wealthy husband, Marvin, request full custody, which Charlie concedes for $100,000, half in advance, on the condition that Charlie retains Max for three months while they are on vacation and the other half when they return. Thereupon, Charlie, Max, and Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach, acquire the once-famous "Noisy Boy", but it is destroyed in a subsequent fight against "Midas". As he and Charlie attempt to scavenge parts to make a new robot from a junkyard, Max discovers "Atom", an obsolete but intact sparring robot designed to withstand severe damage, that is capable of mirroring opponent and handler movements and storing them in its memory due to its rare "shadow function".  At Max's behest, Charlie pits Atom against "Metro", whom Atom overcomes. Max programs Noisy Boy's vocal-respond controls in Atom, and convinces Charlie to help him with Atom's fighting move memory, resulting in a series of victories and culminating to being offered a fight in World Robot Boxing against national champion "Twin Cities". After reaching the arena, the owner of global champion "Zeus" offers to buy Atom, which Max instantly rejects. Charlie disagrees, but eventually takes Max's side. The fight starts with Atom on the attack, but Twin Cities easily takes the offensive and corners Atom. While their opponent has no blind spot, Charlie notices a hitch whenever Twin Cities throws a right jab. Using this, Charlie is able to get Atom out of the corner and eventually win by knockout. Elated by their success, Max challenges Zeus, publicly, with the audience squarely on their side. After the fight, Ricky and his two henchmen ambush Charlie for bailing earlier and rob them of their winnings, prompting Charlie to return Max to Debra.  This upsets Max, and when Charlie tries to convince him that living without him is better for Max, Max says he always wanted Charlie to fight for him and be there as a father. After Max leaves, Charlie returns to Bailey. While talking with her about the events, the two kiss, revealing their attraction to each other. Persuaded by Bailey, Charlie arranges the challenge offered by Max and convinces Debra to allow Max to witness the fight.  Zeus starts the fight by knocking Atom down with its first punch, but Atom gets up, and Zeus continues its assault, knocking Atom down multiple times. However, each time Atom gets back up, and eventually is able to land its first punch allowing Atom to survive the first round. Ricky, who had made a bet with a friend of Charlie's of $100,000 that Atom would not last the round, tries to slip away, but is cornered by the fight's bookmakers. The fight continues with Atom landing multiple punches but also getting knocked down many times and recovering each time. Late in the fourth round, Atom's vocal-respond controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to use its visual "shadow function" to make it visually mimic his boxing skills. This, and the fact that [[Rope-a-Dope|Zeus starts running out of power from its constant offense]], tip the odds in Atom's favor, forcing Zeus' programmer to manually control it, and Max and Bailey both watch Charlie doing what he was meant to do, and are touched by seeing him literally fighting for his son. Zeus gets a sound beating, once even hitting the ground and barely avoiding losing by knockout, but survives the final round and wins the match by the judges' decision. The technologically superior machine remains undefeated, but with the humiliation of being fought to a near-loss, to which Atom is hailed the "People's Champion".

Modi are actually Prem's dad and uncle in disguise. Prem gets the rest of his family to play characters to trick Sanjana's family into letting her marry him.

A physical fight follows, in which Prem gets the upper hand of Sanjana's uncles and their men. He then explains to Amar and Suraj how Sanjana's late mother wanted them to unite and get their niece married. The Chaudharies realise their mistake and are deeply apologetic for their behaviour. In the end, Prem and Sanjana get married and their wedding picture is taken with the Kapoors and Chaudharies, a.k.a. the 'Chapoors'.

Keenan is clearly disturbed by this, but passes on the order to another tactical agent, named Harry ([[Kevin Alejandro]]), who also struggles with this decision and argues with Keenan. Keenan dismisses Harry's protests for personal reasons, rationalizing his decision based on personal gain and the reputation of the ATF. Harry storms off in disgust.  During the shoot-out, Cheyenne ([[Kerry Bishé]]) escapes and is captured by an ATF agent ([[Marc Blucas]]). Just as the ATF agent is about to shoot her, he is killed by Sarah. Cheyenne returns to the house and unbinds Jarod, begging him to help her hide the congregation's children. Jarod refuses and her pleas turn into a fight. Sarah notices them and attacks Jarod. Cheyenne tries to break up the fight and accidentally shoots Sarah in the process, killing her. Cheyenne sends the children up into the attic, and Jarod changes his mind and decides to help Cheyenne hide the children. They run outside to plead with Keenan to spare the children but are killed by Harry.  The shoot-out is interrupted by a mysterious trumpet blast.  The remaining Coopers lower their weapons and run outside rejoicing, claiming that "the [[Rapture]]" has come upon them. Abin calmly approaches a stunned ATF team and confidently taunts them that God's wrath is upon the Earth. He raises his arms and stands in the face of a confused and worried Keenan in a moment of triumph, daring him to defy God.  Several days later, during a briefing before high-ranking government officials, Keenan reports that he then head-butted Cooper and took the rest of the congregation into custody. He explains that the trumpet noises were not the Rapture but came from a group of college students who lived down the road and were irritated with Cooper. As a prank they rigged up an old fire house siren to an [[iPod]] with loud trumpet noises, unaware of the shootout taking place over the hill. Keenan is promoted despite disobeying a direct order from his superiors at the time to kill everyone at the compound.  Keenan is surprised that he is not punished for his actions but his superiors explain that their initial decision to kill the members of the congregation was mostly personal and that they are satisfied with the alternative punishment of taking away the prisoners' constitutional rights to [[due process]] by classifying their crimes as terrorism and locking them up without ever letting them go to trial. Keenan laments this outcome in a story he shares about a couple of hungry brawling dogs he once knew that taught him about the darker side of human nature and the way simple beliefs can turn humans into bloodthirsty animals.  Cooper is finally seen pacing around his cell singing and sermonizing to himself until another prisoner ([[Kevin Smith]]) tells him to "shut the f*** up".  ===Original ending=== During various interactive Q&As for the film, Smith has stated that the original ending continued with the  [[Rapture]] happening and the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] descending on the scene.<ref></ref>  
Red Riding Hood (2011 film)
  Valerie is a young woman who lives in the village of Daggerhorn, on the edge of a forest plagued by a [[werewolf]], with her parents, Cesaire and Suzette, and older sister Lucie. She is in love with the town woodcutter Peter, but her parents have arranged for her to marry Henry Lazar, son of the wealthy [[blacksmith]] Adrien Lazar. Valerie and Peter plan to run away together, only to learn that the Wolf has broken its truce not to prey on the townspeople in exchange for cattle stock sacrifices and has murdered Lucie, who is revealed to have had a crush on Henry Lazar.  Suzette learns of Peter and Valerie's love, telling Valerie she too did not love her husband at first, but learned to love him – that she had loved another. Father Auguste, the local preacher, calls for the famous witch hunter, Father Solomon, to help them but the townspeople decide to venture into the Wolf's lair to destroy it. They divide into groups, with one consisting of Peter, Henry, and Adrien. Peter separates from them moments before the Wolf attacks and murders Adrien. The Wolf is cornered by the men and killed. Valerie finds Suzette mourning Adrien and discerns that he was her love. She also realizes that Lucie, being the older daughter, should've been the first to wed and should have been engaged to Henry, but could not as she was the illegitimate daughter of Adrien, making her Henry's half-sister.  The following day, as the people celebrate, Father Solomon arrives and reveals that, had they killed the Wolf, it would have returned to its human form as it is a werewolf, but what they slew was a common [[grey wolf]]. He also reveals that they've entered the Blood Moon Week, an event that happens every thirteen years, in which whoever is bitten by the Wolf is cursed to become one as well. Father Solomon's men, led by The Captain ([[Adrian Holmes]]), isolate Daggerhorn and begin to investigate its people in search of the Wolf. That night, the Wolf attacks and, while the townspeople rush to the Church (as the Wolf is unable to step onto holy ground), Valerie and her friend Roxanne venture into the village to search for Roxanne's [[Autism|autistic]] brother, Claude. They are cornered by the creature and Valerie discovers that she is able to understand the Wolf's sounds. It threatens to kill Roxanne and destroy the village if Valerie doesn't leave with it. The Wolf then escapes, vowing to return to learn Valerie's decision.  The following day, Claude is captured by Father Solomon's men. Having witnessed Claude performing a card trick earlier, Father Solomon claims he's a student of the dark arts and attempts to force the frightened Claude to reveal the Wolf's identity. When Claude is unable to do so, Father Solomon locks him up in a large iron elephant [[brazen bull]]. In exchange for Claude's release, Roxanne reveals that Valerie is able to communicate with the Wolf but Claude is already dead by the time the Captain opens the elephant. Believing Valerie to be a witch, Father Solomon has her captured and displayed at the town's square in order to lure the Wolf out so he can kill it. Henry and Peter join forces and help Valerie to escape. Peter is captured by the Captain and thrown into the elephant, while Father Solomon orders Henry to be killed for helping Valerie. Father Auguste saves Henry and is then killed by Father Solomon.  Henry takes Valerie to the church, but they are attacked by the Wolf, who bites off Father Solomon's hand, which contains silver-coated fingernails. The townspeople shield Valerie from the Wolf, who is once again forced to flee, but not before burning a paw by touching holy land. The now cursed Father Solomon is subsequently killed by the Captain.  Valerie dreams that the Wolf is her grandmother, who lives in a cabin in the nearby woods, so she goes to check on her. After retrieving Father Solomon's hand on the way, Valerie rushes to her grandmother's cabin, but is confronted on the way by Peter. She then notices that he is wearing a glove on his right hand, the same paw that the Wolf burned trying to enter the church, Valerie assumes Peter is the Wolf and stabs him. Arriving at Grandmother's house, Valerie is horrified to find her dead, and learns that the Wolf is her father, Cesaire. He reveals that the curse was passed to him by his own father, and he intended to leave the village but wanted to take his children with him. He sent a note to Lucie pretending to be Henry to meet him at night so he could ask her to accept her "gift". However, when he confronted her, she couldn't understand him. Realizing Lucie was not his daughter, Cesaire murdered her in a fit of rage. He then took revenge against Adrien, his wife's lover, and now wants Valerie to accept the curse.  Valerie refuses, just as Peter appears and confronts Cesaire, who bites Peter (thus giving him the curse) and tosses him aside. Peter is able to throw an axe into Cesaire's back, distracting him. Valerie stabs Cesaire to death with Father Solomon's hand. Valerie and Peter fill Cesaire's body with rocks so he can never be found and dump the body in the lake. Peter departs in order to learn how to control his curse, vowing to return only when he's able to ensure Valerie's safety. Valerie narrates that Henry found his courage and joins the ranks of the Captain's monster hunters. Valerie's mother finally accepts that her husband will never come home, and the village continues to live in fear even though the wolf never returned. Valerie then moves to her grandmother's house, leaving her old life behind as she can't go back to the village because she is married to the wolf (Peter) and wants to keep that a secret.  The last scene shows Valerie outside the cabin on a full moon. She hears a slight growl, turns around and sees Peter in wolf form as she begins to smile. In an alternate ending, Valerie is seen holding a baby, which is her baby with Peter.

Red Dog (film)
 In 1971, Thomas drives his truck into [[Dampier, Western Australia|Dampier]], [[Western Australia]] late one night, having transported a previously ordered statue of William Dampier to the town. Upon entering the town pub he sees the silhouettes of a group of men, one of whom is holding a gun. Believing it is a murder, he rushes into the next room, where he sees that the men are trying to put down an apparently sick dog. Unable to bring themselves to carry out the [[euthanasia]], the men, with Thomas, retreat to the bar.  Publican Jack Collins tells him the dog's name is [[Red Dog (Pilbara)|Red Dog]] and narrates his story. Upon arriving in Dampier, the dog befriends many of the employees of [[Hamersley Iron]], who have a major iron ore excavation in progress. Various miners relate their stories of Red Dog to Thomas, but state that, while Red Dog was a dog for everyone, he had no real master.  The men then tell of an American, John Grant, a bus driver for Hamersley Iron who became Red's master. He eventually starts dating a woman named Nancy, a secretary at Hamersley Iron. After living in Dampier for two years, John proposes to Nancy. On the night of the engagement, John tells Red Dog to stay until he returns from Nancy's caravan. Early the next morning, John rides his motorcycle from Nancy's caravan, but he is killed in an accident on the way after hitting a [[kangaroo]].  In the shock of John's accident, Nancy and the Hamersley men forget about Red Dog. Three days after the funeral, they find him still waiting where John told him to stay. After three weeks Red Dog decides to look for John, first at Hamersley Iron, then the bar and other places where John was known to go, until all of Dampier is explored. He continues across much of the Australian North West [[Pilbara]] region, from [[Perth]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. He is even rumoured to have caught a ship to Japan in search of John. Finally, the grief catches up to him, and he decides to return to Dampier. When he arrives, he returns to Nancy at the caravan park where she is staying, and she is overwhelmed to see him. The caretakers of the caravan park, however, do not allow dogs in the park, and threaten to shoot Red Dog. Nancy and John's friends at Hamersley then travel to the community of Dampier in support of Red Dog and, after a "civilised chat" with some of the miners, the caretaker and his wife leave, leaving their cat, Red Cat, behind. A great fight between Red Dog and Red Cat ensues, and in the end, they resolve their differences and become mates but still have their ups and downs.  Back in the present day, miner Jocko asks the gathered crowd why the town should have a statue of the town’s namesake, [[William Dampier]], when all he did in relation to the place was say that there were too many flies, and suggests that they should instead erect a statue of someone who represents the town – Red Dog. During the celebrations that follow, Red Dog gets up and walks out of the bar, unnoticed by everyone. Upon realising that the sick dog has left, everyone in the town begins looking for him, eventually finding him lying dead in front of John's grave.  One year later, Thomas once again drives up to Dampier with a new puppy for Nancy, a new 'Red Dog' and the whole town unveils a statue of Red Dog, a statue which still stands today.  
Recoil (2011 film)
 Ryan Varrett (Steve Austin), is an ex-cop determined to avenge the murder of his family. In 2009, when Ryan was a cop in [[Dallas, Texas]], his wife Constance Marie Varrett (Rebecca Robbins) and 9-year-old son Matt Ryan Varrett (Connor Stanhope) were viciously killed by a gang. Ryan survived the assault and killed three of the gang.  However, Ryan quits the Dallas police and hits the road to find everyone else responsible for the deaths of his loved ones. Special Agent Frank Sutton (Lochlyn Munro) of the FBI's Seattle office is investigating the deaths of criminals.  After killing a rapist named Dale James Burrows (Roman Podhora), Ryan ends up in the small town of Hope, Washington, where a gas station owner named Kirby (Patrick Gilmore) directs Ryan to a tiny hotel run by a woman named Darcy (Serinda Swan). Ryan finds Rex Ray Salgado (Noel Gugliemi), a member of the gang that attacked Ryan's family.  It turns out that Hope is under the control of the Circle, a drug and arms dealing biker gang led by Rex's brother, Drayke Salgado (Danny Trejo), who is on the ATF's most wanted list. Sheriff Cole (Tom McBeath) is in Drayke's pocket, so Ryan has only himself and Darcy to depend on.  Ryan kills Rex, Drayke declares war on Ryan, and the town of Hope becomes a battleground. It turns out that Drayke masterminded the shooting of Ryan's family members, and the families of other cops who years ago sent him to prison, where he was brutalized. Drayke got even with the prisoners who brutalized him, then got even with the cops who put him away.  After Kirby is killed by Crab (Keith Jardine), Drayke's right-hand man, Sutton arrives in town, and Cole tries to convince him that Rex's death was an accident. Cole thinks that by appeasing the bikers, he is protecting the town from more bloodshed. Ryan finds Crab and burns him to death.  Since Cole is not much help, Sutton goes to Cole's son, Deputy Hedge (Adam Greydon Reid), who is not in Drayke's pocket. Hedge explains that a long-time ago, the Circle used to protect the town. That was before Drayke took over and started running guns. Rex provided Drayke with a recipe for [[methamphetamines|meth]], and Drayke and his gang started selling drugs too.  However, Drayke and his gang are arming themselves for all-out war against Ryan, and they don't care whom they have to kill. At night, Darcy hears bikers approaching her hotel. Ryan kills the three bikers. Outside, more bikers grab Darcy and beat Ryan up.  On the next day, Ryan has been taken to Drayke, and some of his men bring Darcy into the room. Darcy is held tied up with tape on her mouth. They're on an abandoned ferry boat that Drayke uses as his headquarters. Drayke leaves his man Prospect (Tygh Runyan) to beat Ryan up. Ryan breaks free from his restraints and takes care of Prospect. Ryan overcomes Drayke's men, finds Darcy who is tied to a chair and gagged with tape. Deputy Hedge goes to his father's house and finds Cole has shot himself. With Sutton's help, but Hedge plans to go after Drayke.  Ryan remembers Drayke being present during the attack on his family. Until Ryan came to Hope, Drayke thought Ryan was dead. Ryan and Drayke start fighting. A shot kills Drayke. It was Sutton who fired the shot. Darcy decides that she's going to stay in Hope, and Sutton decides to not arrest Ryan. Hedge becomes the new sheriff. Ryan decides to leave town, but promises Darcy that he will send her a postcard to let her know where he is.

Remains (film)
 Tom ([[Grant Bowler]]) and Tori ([[Evalena Marie]]) are employees at the fictional Silver Star Casino in [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]].  On a slow day at the tables, Tom convinces Tori to join him in a stock room for a sexual encounter.  At the same time a news report is airing about "Peace Day", a day when the entire world's supply of [[nuclear weapons]] is set to be destroyed.  Something goes wrong during the event and a nuclear blast occurs, knocking out power to the casino and trapping Tom and Tori behind an electronic lock.  When the power is restored they find the casino trashed and people gone, except for an old lady in a power chair who attacks Tori.  After dispatching the old lady with a chair leg, they encounter [[magician's assistant]] Jensen ([[Miko Hughes]]).  He tells them that he turned the power back on and that he isn't sure what happened.  Tom and Jensen go up front to check the casino security cameras while Tori goes to the front door to look outside.  Tom and Jensen see Victor ([[Anthony Marks]]) outside throwing a man to the zombies to save himself.  Victor bolts into the casino and demands to be let in.  Jensen lets him in and takes him to a bathroom to clean up while Tom and Tori decide to start trapping the other zombies in the casino.  The survivors trap zombies in various parts of the hotel and dispose of the dead off the hotel dock.  They note that at night the zombies appear to be sleeping.  They spend the next few days drinking, smoking, and playing cards to kill time.  While on the roof, Tom spots a convoy of trucks but drops his radio off the roof before he can contact them.  Deciding to use a spotlight from across the street to attract the convoy, they head out at night past the sleeping zombies.  When the light is turned on music plays with it, waking the zombies.  The group is separated, with Victor running back into the casino and Tom and Tori trapped on a bus.  The army convoy arrives, rescuing Tom and Tori and taking shelter with them in the casino.  The army's medic, Cindy ([[Tawny Cypress]]), patches up Tom's hand and tells them that the group is headed to [[Lake Tahoe, California|Lake Tahoe]].  Jensen begins sneaking around and discovers that the army has taken all of the food and supplies from the casino with the help of Victor.  He confronts the soldiers on the dock and a shootout occurs, killing Jensen.  The army decides to leave immediately, but Tom stalls them by asking if they cleared out the pantry beyond the banquet hall.  The soldiers force Tom to show them where it is, and he opens the door to release dozens of zombies that he and Tori trapped in the room earlier.  The zombies overwhelm the soldiers, who flee the casino in a panic.    Tom and Tori make an attempt to escape in a car from the parking garage but cannot get the door open.  After returning to the roof they spot Cindy returning in a pickup truck, which she rolls over in a crash when a zombie surprises her.  Tom rescues Cindy and brings her back inside, where Tori threatens to shoot her.  Cindy tells them that the convoy was attacked by a herd of faster, stronger zombies and that no one survived.  Tori and Cindy argue and Tori taunts Cindy about her father's death.  She then tells Cindy that Tom killed someone in a drunk driving accident in Vegas.  Later on, while eating, Tom reveals to Cindy that he killed his wife and unborn child in the accident.  They decide to travel to [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] to try to find Cindy's daughter.  In the morning, Tom and Cindy head to the roof to see that the herd of stronger zombies has arrived.  At the front entrance, the stronger zombies are breaking down the barricade.  Tom, Tori, and Cindy decide to try to use the explosives to escape.  They open all the gas lines on the kitchen stoves and set a charge.  As they are escaping Cindy is attacked and breaks her ankle.  Tori tries to convince Tom to leave Cindy behind and when he refuses she hits him in the head with an axe, takes his gun, and leaves.  Tori sets an explosive charge on the garage door and is attacked by a zombie.  The zombie bites her but is killed in the blast.  A dazed Tori wanders into the street and is swarmed by zombies.  Tom and Cindy make it to the exit as the second explosive charge goes off, destroying most of the hotel and casino.  They make it to the parking garage where they find the door blasted open.  They find the [[Smart Fortwo|Smart Car]] that Tori and Tom tried to escape in earlier and use it to leave the casino.  In the final scene, a zombified Tori carries her shotgun and kills the weaker zombies--implying that she is stronger, faster, and still retains her human intelligence--and looks toward the direction where Tom and Cindy drove.

Remembrance (2011 film)
 The film's story intercuts between a [[Nazi concentration camp]] in Poland, in 1944 and New York City in 1976.  In 1944, Tomasz Limanowski, a captured member of the Polish resistance, manages to aid the resistance from inside a concentration camp, where his slave labor includes supervising distribution of loaves of bread. His resistance task in the camp has been to capture photos of the horrifying war crimes taking place and smuggle out the negatives that will reveal the crimes to the outside world.   This is unknown to Hannah Silberstein, a young German Jew in the work camp with whom Tomasz is in love and who has recently discovered she is pregnant. Every night, Tomasz buys off his officemate with a bottle of vodka so that he and Hannah can be alone together in the office in which Tomasz works with the [[SS]], and they share bread that Tomasz has stolen for them.  In 1976, interwoven scenes open the story on the day that Hannah Levine, living in [[Brooklyn, New York]] with a successful husband and their grown daughter, discovers that Tomasz, who for 30 years she had believed was dead, is alive. While preparing for a celebratory dinner party for her husband and running an errand at a local dry cleaners, Hannah sees Tomasz in an interview on TV and instantly recognizes him as he shares his story about their love with the interviewer. In a daze, Hannah rushes home, experiencing reactivated trauma that she had shelved, unable to keep her mind on the evening's party and raising the concerns of her family and guests at her distractedness. She desperately calls the [[Red Cross]] that day, for the first time since 1946, when her initial search for Tomasz had led to a dead end.  Cutting back to 1944, we see Tomasz implementing a plan for their salvation with the help of fellow inmates, gaining access to an SS uniform and paperwork. On the day of the escape, terrified that it is happening too quickly to be fully prepared, Tomasz dresses up as an SS officer and demands that Hannah follow him, all the while terrified that he will be exposed as a Polish prisoner. Tomasz walks her to the exit of the camp where another SS officer comments that he'd like to rape her; Tomasz barely holds his cover and coldly insists that he have Hannah first. The guard, not picking up on Tomasz's limited German, acquiesces, and Tomasz and Hannah successfully march down the road until out of sight and run off into the woods.   They run for weeks, ending up in Tomasz's hometown, at his mother's house. Tomasz's mother, Stefania, does not approve of Hannah, as the latter is both German and a Jew, and furiously insists that Hannah will cause trouble for their family. Hannah, weak and distressed by the outburst, miscarries the same night that a car is ready to take Tomasz to Warsaw, where he must deliver the photos to his brother, who is in the homeland army. With no other option, Tomasz leaves Hannah in his mother's care and tells his neighbor and family friend, Janusz, to take Hannah to the home of Tomasz's sister-in-law, Magdalena, where Hannah can hide more safely. Tomasz assures Hannah he will only be gone for a few days.  Tomasz winds up being gone for a long while. During her recovery at Stefania's, Hannah comes to experience the woman's full animosity when Stefania attempts to have a German officer discover Hannah, but Hannah suspects her motives and hides. Disgusted at this betrayal, Hannah leaves immediately afterward, taking a photo of Tomasz that his mother had kept framed in a place of honor. Hannah goes to Magdalena's home to wait for Tomasz but is still forced to hide from the world.   When Czeslav, Tomasz's brother, returns home from Warsaw, hopes for Tomasz's return are high. However, after a month of the three living together, Czeslav comes to believe that Tomasz must be dead, a belief that Hannah refuses to accept.   Things are tense but harmonious until Stefania shows up at their home, claiming that the Russians took over her home. She soon turns against Magdalena, accusing her of having brought misfortune to the family and criticizing her for letting Hannah live in the house.  Shortly afterward, the Russians show up at their home and take Czeslav and Magdalena to a Soviet work camp; Stefania and Hannah are left behind. Hannah cannot stay with Tomasz's mother, knowing she cannot trust her, and believes it will be for the best if she returns home to Berlin. She trudges off in winter snow and nearly dies but for a passing Red Cross van that happens upon her.  Back to 1976, Hannah has success - the Red Cross has tracked Tomasz down in Poland. She works up the courage to call him; both are in complete shock that the other has survived. Tomasz initially thinks it is a hoax, but Hannah persists. They speak briefly, and Hannah tells him for the first time that she had been pregnant, a revelation too much for her to bear herself, and she hangs up, promising to call again. A brief flashback reveals that long after Hannah returned to Berlin, Tomasz returned home to find only his mother, who told him that Csezslav and Magdalena had been sent to a work camp, and (disingenuously) that Hannah had died.  Back in 1976, after a wrenching outing of her secret search that anguishes her husband and daughter, Hannah's husband encourages her to go see this man who saved her. Hannah travels to Poland to visit Tomasz, who has a grown daughter of his own and is separated from his wife. The movie ends with Hannah and Tomasz seeing each other after Hannah has just gotten off the bus and Tomasz has come by car to pick her up.  
Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings
 Young Remington (Andre Salazar) has a habit of spotting gay men and loudly calling them "Bakla!" (a Filipino term for "gay"). Everything changes during a trip to the cemetery, however, where he briefly encounters a grieving drag queen named Pops ([[Roderick Paulate]]) and taunts him for his sexuality. Infuriated, Pops swears that Remington would grow up to become gay on his 21st birthday, scaring the young boy.  Many years later, an epidemic of murders of gay men erupts in the little town of Lucban, which Remington's mother Fe (Janice de Belen), a policewoman, and her co-policewoman Mimi (Angelica Kanapi) are unable to solve. Twenty-year old Remington (Martin Escudero) takes a peek at one such crime scene along with curious passersby in the nearest field when he chances upon a young woman named Hannah Montano (Lauren Young), who recently returned to her hometown, and tries getting to know her, only for her to shun his advances after learning who he is through his best friend Jigs (Kerbie Zamora).   During a street basketball game with their friends, Remington notices a mysterious flying aura in the shape of a pink scarf (a manifestation of the curse) taunting his surroundings, which briefly distracted him until a basketball hits him. In an attempt to court Hannah further, Remington volunteers himself and Jigs to help paint her newly furnished house, only for her to spurn him further after revealing that he was the same little boy who once mocked her late father for being gay, earning him the ire of her grieving mother, Mrs. Montano (Eugene Domingo).   That very same night, Remington dreamt of himself and Jigs taking a bath outside their home, only to be attacked by a buffed man wielding a razor, with a butterfly tattoo on his chest. He wakes up with cuts on his legs, having lost all his body hair. His father, Ed (Jon Regala) notices his new look during a drinking session with his homophobic friends Suarez (Daniel Fernando) and Serge (Leandro Baldemor) and proudly declares his son as a "real man" who is off to court women.   Meanwhile, as the murders in the barrio continue to persist, Remington tells his mother about his dream and tries helping her by identifying available suspects. Concerned, his mother asks if he might be closet gay, to which Remington adamantly denies. His mother berates him for not wanting to go to Manila for college and asks what he truly wants in his life, to which he doesn't reply.   Later that night, as another gay man gets murdered inside a beauty parlor, Remington dreamt of mistakenly boarding a tricycle thought to be Jigs', only to discover that the driver was the same strange man who attacked him in his first dream. He is instead brought to a secluded spot in the middle of the forest, where he is paddled by the same man and has his tongue pulled out. Eventually, Remington "wakes up" from this dream, only to discover that he can now speak "gay" and realizes that the curse from his childhood is starting to come true. Despite trying his best to hide his sexuality, however, his newfound behavior has changed Hannah and her mother's perception of him, and Hannah eventually falls for the new Remington.   As the curse continues to strengthen, Remington learns that his mannerisms are starting to become more feminine and his wardrobe preferences start to change. At the same time, he starts falling for his best friend Jigs, who eventually tries to seduce him but refuses to continue after learning that most of the gay men he had affairs with were murdered. Remington realizes how he is starting to lose himself and starts consulting his gay helper Georgia (Nar Cabico) on what to do.   After briefly consulting an albularyo (Marian Rivera), Remington, Hannah and Jigs track down Pops, the mysterious drag queen who cursed him during his youth and discover his mansion. The aged Pops initially denied putting a curse on Remington and attempted to have his pager boy shoo the trio away until Remington sees a portrait of the gay man in his house and starts calling Pops "Bakla!" to make him remember. Furious, Pops calls him out and confirms he did put the curse on him, but unfortunately has no idea how to undo the curse. He, however, helps conduct a seance with the trio in order to communicate with the mysterious men who haunt Remington's dreams. The mysterious men manifest before them and reveal a clear solution: the only way for him to remove the curse is to find a purely heterosexual man who will choose to become gay in his place.   Just as the trio, Pops and his pager boy set off to town and find possible replacements, they find themselves being blocked by the culprit of the murders: Remington's godfather, Suarez, whose "gaydar" gun led him to them and kills Pops. As the trio runs away from the scene, the distraught pager boy brings back his beloved master back from the dead, along with the souls of other drag queens who have been murdered to exact justice, in the form of zombies, which flock to town and promptly start attacking citizens.   With the time ticking, Remington, Hannah and Jigs make it to the former's birthday party, where they ask the rest of their friends if they are willing to take the curse in his place. None of them agree, in which Remington reluctantly agrees on staying that way, until Hannah snaps him out of it and retorts that real gay men continue to fight oppression due to the stigma, and that she knows he is not like this, so he doesn't have to give up being who he originally was.   As the rest of the town is being attacked by gay zombies (aptly called “zombadings”, or “gay zombies”), Remington eventually meets his father, who protects him by stepping between him and Suarez. Just as Suarez is about to fire his gun, the gaydar fails, with Remington's father proudly declaring that his son is not gay, contrary to what Suarez thinks. During the ruckus, however, Serge gets attacked by zombies and dies from his injuries, prompting Suarez to cradle his cohort's body as he mourns his death. Having sensed Suarez's brief moment of affection, the gesture reactivates the gaydar gun and fired at Suarez, ending his life.   Minutes before the curse takes over, Remington desperately explains to his skeptical father about the curse and his current predicament. The latter asks what his son needs to undo it and reluctantly but willingly agrees to become gay in his son's place, turning his son back to normal right before midnight.   Life returns to normal in Lucban. Remington is set on leaving the town to continue his studies in Manila. Hannah, however, has finally set up the dorm she dreamt of putting up as her business. Serge and Suarez are buried under the same gravesite, while Pops and the rest of the "zombadings" set up a hat shop in an undisclosed park. Remington's father, however, lives a normal but pleasant life, now as an openly gay father, who also settles on eyeing passing men with his wife.   Meanwhile, somewhere in Lucban, another tricycle stops in the middle of the street and unloads a gay man. A passing boy loudly tells his mother that he sees a gay man, which initially offends the latter, only for the kid to add that the gay man is beautiful.

Retreat (film)
 London architect Martin Kennedy (Cillian Murphy) and his miserable journalist wife Kate (Thandie Newton) often visit a small, remote, uninhabited island off the west coast of Scotland called Blackholme Island for their holiday retreats. The only dwelling on the island, Fairweather Cottage, is seasonally operated by the owner Doug from the mainland and only reachable by ferry. After previously suffering a [[miscarriage]], Kate's relationship with Martin has become tense, and in an effort to rekindle their marriage they decide on a return visit to the island. A few nights into their stay, the generator in the cottage explodes, injuring Martin's arm and leaving them without electricity. They use the [[CB radio]], their only source of communication to the mainland, to call Doug, who ferries out to help them.  Kate spends the next day waiting at the jetty for Doug to arrive, but to no avail. Later a mysterious man in green combat fatigues washes up on the island, bloodied and half-conscious. When he comes round, he identifies himself as a soldier, Private Jack Coleman (Jamie Bell). He tells Martin and Kate that there has been an [[outbreak]] of an airborne disease, Argromoto Flu, codenamed R1N16, which started in South America and has [[pandemic|spread over the entire world]] in the time-span of a few weeks. The disease is incurable and highly contagious, attacking the respiratory system and causing the victims to choke on blood with a 100% fatality rate. Jack says that the military have lost control, and are now advising civilians to seal themselves up in their homes and not allow anybody access. With only static now coming from the CB radio, Martin decides to play it safe and help Jack, who aggressively takes command and boards up the door and windows.  Over the next few days, Jack becomes increasingly strange and erratic, and his intimidating behaviour begins to disturb the couple even further. They suspect that the virus may be a lie and that Jack is insane. When Kate asks him if he is married, he tells her his wife died of R1N16 and he becomes aggressive and threatening. Martin and Kate decide to leave the cottage and take their chances outside, but Jack refuses to let them, forcing them into the bedroom at gunpoint and locking them in. Martin sneaks outside through a skylight, finding the bodies of Doug and his wife at the pier, killed by gunshot. Using Doug's hunting shotgun, Martin returns to the cottage and gets the upper hand on Jack. However, just as Kate begins to tie Jack's hands behind his back, Martin suddenly begins coughing up blood; it appears the Argromoto Flu is very real and he is infected. Kate is forced to shoot her husband dead with the shotgun, to spare him a slow and agonising death.  Forced at gunpoint, Jack reveals to Kate that he was experimented on at a military compound and released without anyone having realized he was a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] of R1N16. Jack had infected his wife, killing her, and fled to Blackholme Island to quarantine himself where the couple found him. Jack reveals that the CB radio worked all along, and he had just changed the settings so that Kate and Martin would not be able to reach anyone. Jack fixes the CB radio, and the military broadcast on it claims that the soldiers have a vaccine against the virus. Jack tells Kate that the military are lying; there is no vaccine, and the military would kill them both if they were discovered. Kate does not believe him and, angered by the possibility that Martin could have been saved, she shoots Jack dead. As she attempts to leave the island in the boat with Martin's body, a military helicopter flies over and she is killed by a sniper who shoots her in the head.

Restoration (2011 film)
 The film concerns a small furniture-restoration business in downtown [[Tel Aviv]], Malamud & Fidelman. As the film begins, one of the partners (Malamud, played by [[Rami Danon]]) has died, and bequeathed his share in the business not to his longtime partner Yaakov Fidelman ([[Sasson Gabai]]), but to Yaakov's son Noah Fidelman ([[Nevo Kimhi]]).  The aging Yaakov is a skilled craftsman, who loves his work and keeps exacting standards. However, he has little sense for financial issues, which had always been taken care of by his dead partner. The business is going down, demand for Yaakov's services is falling off and banks refuse to give him loans. Noah, who had refused to follow in his father's footsteps and became a successful lawyer, is pressing Yaakov to retire and sell off the workshop – which could bring a lucrative profit as the area is undergoing a real-estate boom.  Yaakov is on the verge of reluctantly giving in when a mysterious young man named Anton ([[Henry David (actor)|Henry David]]) gets a job in the workshop, and becomes Yaakov's apprentice, exhibiting considerable aptitude for and skill in the work. Little is revealed of Anton's antecedents; he had broken off relations with his family, for unknown reasons, and hides when his brother comes by seeking him. Anton comes up with a way of saving the failing business, or at least giving it a breathing spell: a broken down 19th Century German [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] [[piano]], which Anton discovered among old junk in the workshop, can be repaired and sold for a considerable sum.  Anton – who is also a gifted pianist – throws himself into the repair job, so determined to succeed that he resorts to stealing people's wallets in the street to gain money needed to buy materials. In effect, he stakes a claim to being Yaakov Fidelman's true son and heir, the one who continues the old man's lifework which his biological son had cast aside. As work on the piano progresses, the frustrated Noah steals into the workshop, but cannot bring himself to smash the piano.  The stakes in this rivalry are raised higher when Anton starts an affair with Noah's wife, Hava ([[Sarah Adler]]) – a sensitive and artistic young woman who is neglected by her busy husband, and who is heavily pregnant with Noah's child, Yaakov's grandchild.  Eventually, it is Yaakov Fidelman who must make the crucial choice between Anton's piano project and Noah's real-estate deal – and in effect, which of them does he recognize as his true son.

Rio (2011 film)
  In [[Brazil]], various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In [[Moose Lake, Minnesota]], a crate with a male [[Spix's macaw]] hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Over the next 15 years,<ref name="TeleRhap" /> Linda comes to own a bookstore. Highly domesticated and unable to fly because he is scared to, Blu is ridiculed frequently by the [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.  One day, [[ornithology|ornithologist]] Túlio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to [[Rio de Janeiro]] because Blu, who is the last known male of his species, needs to mate with the last known female macaw. Linda accepts and they fly to Rio, where Blu meets a [[red-crested cardinal]] named Pedro and his [[yellow canary]] friend Nico. At Túlio's [[aviary]], Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent [[Spix's macaw]] longing to flee back to the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black market deal regarding Blu and Jewel. While Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he desires to exact revenge on "pretty birds" after his role on a television program had been ruined by one. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and Túlio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a [[toco toucan]], who offers to take them to his friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain. He attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with Pedro and Nico. Meanwhile, Nigel hires a horde of thieving [[marmoset]]s led by Mauro to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the two birds to a Rio-style dance party, where they perform a duet and begin to fall in love, but encounter the marmosets in the process. The birds fight them off while the five escape on a [[tram]]. Fernando takes Linda and Túlio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover that the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the [[Rio Carnival]] parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who is a [[bulldog]], who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways.  Pedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and Túlio have spotted the smuggler's parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and Túlio pose as dancers in [[Spix's macaw]] costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and Túlio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a [[Short SC.7 Skyvan]]. During the flight, Blu destroys his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the other captive birds. However, Nigel attacks the macaws, injuring Jewel. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane's engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly as he and Jewel kiss, and he carries her to Linda and Túlio for help. Later, they adopt Fernando and organize a sanctuary to protect the jungle from smugglers. Blu and Jewel eventually raise three children together, and fly above the jungle, joined by Linda, Luiz, and Túlio in a hang-glider.

The Rite (2011 film)
 Michael Kovak ([[Colin O'Donoghue]]) is the son of a successful funeral home owner and businessman, Istvan ([[Rutger Hauer]]). Disillusioned with his past job as a [[mortician]], Michael decides to enter a seminary school and renounce his vows upon completion, thereby getting a free college degree. Four years have passed, and Michael is being ordained to the rank of deacon at the seminary. After his ordination, he writes a letter of resignation to his superior, Father Matthew, citing a lack of faith. Father Matthew ([[Toby Jones]]), apparently wanting to talk to Michael, attempts to catch up to him on the street. He trips as he steps over a curb, causing a cyclist to swerve into the path of an oncoming van. The young cyclist, Sandra ([[Marija Karan]]), is critically injured. Seeing Michael's clerical garb, she asks him for [[absolution]] before her last breath. Initially hesitant, Michael is unable to refuse, comforting her and performing a blessing ritual to absolve her of her sins. Seeing how calmly Michael handled the situation, Father Matthew tells Michael that he is called to be a priest despite his resignation. He also tells Michael that with the rise in demonic possessions every year, the Church needs more exorcists and says that he has the potential to become one. Father Matthew decides to send him to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in Rome, so he can attend an exorcism class taught by his friend Father Xavier ([[Ciarán Hinds]]). Michael finally accepts after Father Matthew tells him that the Church might convert his scholarship into a student loan that would cost $100,000 if his immediate resignation stood. If Michael attends the exorcism class and still wants to resign afterwards, then they will discuss matters (hinting that he may be free to leave).  During classes, he meets a young woman, Angelina ([[Alice Braga]]), who is also taking the course. He soon learns that she is a reporter who has been asked to cover the course for an article in a newspaper. [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Father Xavier, realizing Michael is a skeptic and very tentative in his faith, asks Michael to see a friend of his, a renowned Welsh [[Jesuit]] exorcist named Father Lucas ([[Anthony Hopkins]]). Michael agrees and meets Father Lucas at his home, where he also meets one of the priest's patients: a pregnant sixteen-year-old girl named Rosaria. It is later revealed that she had been raped by her father, which led to her [[demonic possession|possession]]. However, Michael remains skeptical, even after witnessing several [[preternatural]] events, such as the girl coughing up three long nails and speaking English fluently. She pointedly reminds Michael of the last patient he anointed and of his loathing for his own father. He later speaks again with Angelina, who asks him to relay any information he gets from Father Lucas to her, as she has tried for an interview with him many times but has been refused. Michael declines. Meanwhile, Rosaria's condition worsens, to the extent that she tries to drown herself, prompting Father Lucas and Michael to have her hospitalized for further care. In the hospital, Father Lucas performs another exorcism on her while Michael observes. Michael leaves while Father Lucas stays overnight outside the girl's room. Late that night, she miscarries; the baby dies from [[cardiac arrest]], and the mother from blood loss from major hemorrhaging. Disheartened, Father Lucas feels he has failed her. When Michael sees this he decides to confer with Angelina.  After the young woman's death, Father Lucas begins behaving strangely, exhibiting signs of demonic possession. Michael and Angelina later find him sitting outside his house in the rain. Father Lucas takes them into his house and, knowing himself to be possessed, requests that Michael find Father Xavier to perform the exorcism. Angelina and Michael try desperately to contact and find Father Xavier; they learn, however, that he is out of contact for three days. Learning this, Michael decides to perform the exorcism himself, with Angelina present. After constant rebuking by the demon and a long, drawn-out fight, Michael regains his lost faith and is able to force the demon to reveal its name, [[Baal (demon)|Baal]]. He completes the exorcism, and the powerful demon leaves Father Lucas. Successful, Michael leaves Rome, returning to the United States and to his life.  The final scene of the film shows Michael, now Father Michael Kovak, entering a confessional and beginning to hear a girl's confession.  
Rise of the Planet of the Apes
  Will Rodman, a [[scientist]] at the [[San Francisco]] [[biotechnology|biotech]] company Gen-Sys, is testing the viral-based drug ALZ-112 on [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s to find a cure for [[Alzheimer's disease]]. ALZ-112 is given to a chimp named Bright Eyes, greatly increasing her intelligence. But then, during Will's presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes is forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is shot to death. Will's boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and has the chimps slaughtered. However, Will's assistant Robert Franklin discovers that the reason for Bright Eyes' rampage was that she had recently given birth to an infant chimp. Will reluctantly agrees to take in the chimp, who is named Caesar. Will learns that Caesar has inherited his mother's intelligence and decides to raise him. Three years later, Will introduces Caesar to the [[redwood]] forest at [[Muir Woods National Monument]]. Meanwhile, Will treats his [[dementia]]-suffering father Charles with ALZ-112, which seems to restore his cognitive ability.  Five years later, when Caesar reaches adolescence and sees a dog on a leash like his own, he questions his identity and learns of his origins from Will. Meanwhile, Charles's condition returns as he becomes resistant to ALZ-112. Caesar injures an aggressive neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker, while defending a confused Charles from him. As a result, he is placed in a primate shelter where he is tormented by a chimp named Rocket and the chief guard, Dodge Landon, but also where he befriends an [[orangutan]] named Maurice who came from a [[circus]]. Caesar learns how to unlock his cage, gaining free access to the common area. With the assistance of a [[gorilla]] named Buck, he confronts the sanctuary's alpha, Rocket and claims that position. Meanwhile, Jacobs clears development of a more powerful, gaseous version of the drug – ALZ-113 – when Will tells him it can also improve intelligence. Will takes the drug home to try to save his father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight.  After attempting to test the drug on a scarred [[bonobo]] test subject named Koba, Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill. Attempting to warn Will at his home, he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but the chimp refuses to go home with him so he could look after the other apes. Instead, he escapes from the facility and returns to Will's house, where he takes canisters of the ALZ-113. Upon returning, Caesar releases the gas and allows it to enhance the intelligence of the other apes. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar speaks for the first time, yelling "No!" and gets in a fight which inadvertently leads to Dodge's death. The apes flee the facility, release the remaining chimps from Gen-Sys, and free more apes from the [[San Francisco Zoo]] on the way.  A battle ensues as the ape army fights their way past a police blockade on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] to escape into the redwood forest. Buck sacrifices himself to save Caesar by jumping into the helicopter in which Jacobs is riding. The helicopter crashes onto the bridge, trapping Jacobs in the wreckage. While Caesar ignores Jacobs' pledges for help, Koba seizes his chance for revenge and sends Jacobs falling to his death in the bay below.  As the apes find their way into the forest, Will catches up to them in a stolen police car and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down, and begs him to return home. In response, Caesar hugs him and says that, "Caesar is home". Will, realizing that this is indeed their last goodbye, respects Caesar's wishes. The apes embrace their new lifestyle in the forest.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], an infected Hunsiker leaves his house for work as an airline pilot, arriving at [[San Francisco International Airport]] for his flight to [[Paris]]. His nose begins to drip [[Blood|blood]] onto the floor. A graphic similar to [[Plague Inc.]] traces the [[Pandemic|spread of the humanity-ravaging virus around the globe via international flight routes]].

She saw her opportunity for revenge when she was selected to write a script for the school festival play. She started cursing her class mates one by one. The only one that realized the curse was Yuka. She tried to stop Kurohane, by talking to her, but it was useless. Kurohane's curse was also discovered by one classmate she wanted to kill, so Kurohane tried a different way to kill her. One day, that class mate that she wanted to kill transferred to another school, but appeared several days later to kill Kurohane, and then killed herself, not because she wanted to, but because she was cursed by Kurohane.  At that point, Kurohane's curses were so strong that a person would lose command and kill herself. The new source Kurohane used was text messages. She also sent a text message to Yuka, but she never read it.  Time passed and Yuka was with her new classmates, telling them the story of Kurohane. They stole Yuka's cell phone and saw the text message Kurohane had sent to her, including Yuka. Then, one by one, Yuka's classmates started dying, leaving Yuka alone. And that is when she realizes that the way to save herself is to get more and more people to read the words of Kurohane. She killed people randomly, so Yuka wrote a short story with Kurohane's words in it and posted it online, increasing her time to live.

Rockstar (2011 film)
  A large crowd gathers outside the [[Verona Arena]] in [[Italy]] to watch the performance of rockstar Jordan. Despite being mobbed, he reaches the arena, storms onto the stage in a fit of rage and starts strumming on his guitar.  A flashback reveals the story of Jordan, whose real name is Janardhan Jhakar  JJ, a boy from [[Delhi, India|Delhi]]. He is studying at [[Hindu College, Delhi|Hindu College]] and dreams of being a rockstar like [[Jim Morrison]], for which he is often laughed at by his friends and classmates. Khatana, the canteen owner, tells JJ that one thing common among all artists is a life-altering heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since that hasn't happened yet, he won't be able to reach his idol had attained. JJ sees a beautiful girl rehearsing before a dancing contest called "Shut Up & Dance" when he and his friends go to venue, as the contest is about to start. He watches the performance of Heer Kaul, a girl from [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi|St. Stephen's College]], and overhears that she is the "perfect heartbreaking machine". He remembers the word of Khatana telling him that heartbreak is the way to become an artist, and decides to propose to Heer, but he suffers humiliation, which he sees as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. Over time, JJ and Heer become good friends, often going on adventures together and sometimes engaging in behaviour which the conservative JJ thinks is risky.  Heer becomes engaged to Jai, a man she ultimately marries in Kashmir, after which the couple depart to [[Prague]]. During this time, she develops feelings for JJ and coins the nickname "Jordan" for him before leaving. JJ returns home, finds himself thrown out by his brothers for allegedly stealing family money. He takes refuge for two months in the nearby [[Nizamuddin Dargah]], singing [[qawwali]]s, and then moves into Khatana's home asking for shelter.  Ustaad Jameel Khan, a renowned classical musician, remembers JJ singing at the Dargah, and prompts Dhingra, the owner of "Platinum Records", to sign JJ. Sheena, a journalist, interviews JJ and hints to him that Dhingra is planning to send some artists to a Europe tour for recordings. JJ volunteers to work there at any cost (by signing some contracts with Dhingra), in the hopes of reuniting with Heer.  Heer, meanwhile, suffers from continuous spurts of health problems. She meets JJ in Prague and they reconnect, but when he tries to profess his love for her, Heer, being married, spurns his advances. As their relationship gets more intimate, Heer suffers from guilt. As soon as Jordan's tours in Prague gets over, she leaves him. JJ tries to visit her one last time before he departs to India, but is arrested on trespassing charges filed by Heer's husband. Upon being deported back to India, JJ is overwhelmed by the attention he receives, and he clashes with the media and the Indian Police, resulting in a term in jail. The event garners enough publicity to make Dhingra decide that this is the right time to release JJ's recordings, and the album does well, putting JJ into the limelight.  After being released, JJ terminates his contract with Dhingra's company, embarks on a country-wide tour for his concerts and finally morphs fully into 'Jordan' the rockstar, which he had aspired to. He turns bitter, arrogant, and lonely as time goes on but despite his outbursts, he remains a highly popular artist.  Jordan meets Heer's younger sister, Mandy, during one of his concerts, and she asks him to help Heer - who has been diagnosed with [[aplastic anemia]]. Although he is initially asked to leave by Heer's mother Neena, Jordan's presence causes Heer to recover somewhat. He starts disregarding his musical obligations as he spends more time with her, and soon Khatana, his manager now, asks Heer to persuade Jordan to attend his concerts.  Heer asks Jordan to complete his tour and reunite with her. As JJ continues to tour, her condition worsens. She finally slips into a coma and is discovered by her doctor to be pregnant; Neena and Mandy guess the father is Jordan. When Mandy calls him and tells that Heer is pregnant and has gone into a coma, Jordan leaves a show right in the middle and reaches the hospital where Heer is being treated. He tries to wake her up but she remains non-responsive; soon, Jordan realises that she will not survive. The film doesn't show Heer's death or recovery, leaving her fate undetermined. As Jordan grieves for her, it is reflected in his music and he starts receiving international fame.  The film cuts back to the concert in Verona and while performing, Jordan sees a vision of Heer walking towards him, smiling. The film ends with a line from the poet [[Rumi]]'s poem, which when translated to English is: "Away, beyond all concepts of wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there."

  ===Prologue=== Luis Medina ([[TJ Trinidad]]) is a successful policeman who has been recently awarded for his skill in investigations, despite his track record of being reckless and failing to follow protocol. After his award ceremony, the chief of police is approached by a woman asking for new information about her daughters who went missing twelve years ago. Luis asks for the names of her daughters so he can try to find them, and the woman tells him that their names are Joy and Lara Luna. Asking his partner to retrieve the missing persons file, Luis sets out for his investigation, despite his colleague Greg's advice that he shouldn't give the woman false hope.  ===Story 1: 2008=== Ella ([[Barbie Forteza]]) sneaks out at night with her cousin Janine ([[Lexi Fernandez]]) and Janine's boyfriend Brian ([[Derrick Monasterio]]), taking her mother's car so that they can find somewhere for Brian to teach Janine how to drive for her driver's test. On the highway they spot a patrol car, which causes them to panic as they don't have drivers' licenses. Brian tries to make a U-turn, but accidentally drives into a fence blocking a dirt road. While checking for damage to the car, Brian notices a gate and drives into the isolated road beyond, thinking it the perfect spot for them to learn to drive. Eventually the three notice a red car which passes them repeatedly, although they never pass it themselves, and that the car doesn't seem to have a driver. Panicking, Brian tries to get them off the road but discover that they are stuck in an endless loop, passing by the same tree again and again. Finally, the car stalls, and Brian and Janine get out of the car while Ella stays inside. Janine tries to convince Brian to go back for her cousin, but Brian refuses to do so, and instead promises Janine that they will come back for her with help. As the two walk through the woods, they spot a crashed red car. Meanwhile, finally panicking, Ella leaves the car and manages to catch up with the two. Ella manages to call her father and beg for help, but the red car suddenly bursts into flames, causing the three to leave the crash site. While running, the two girls are separated from Brian. They manage to get back into their car and attempt to drive away, but a ghost behind the wheel scares Janine. Ella, in a panicked state of mind, accidentally opens her car door and falls out of the car while Janine loses control and hits her head on the wheel.

They find Brian dead by the corn fields and it is revealed that Janine died when she hit her head on the wheel but they are unable to find Ella. Luis and Officer Allan find a house deep within the woods. Officer Greg tells them that he already searched the house and tells them that Ella isn't there. They also find the crashed car that the three teens passed by earlier. When Luis opens the backseat door, he sees a skeleton wearing a heart shaped locket.  The next day, they take the three bodies to the morgue. It is revealed that the skeleton corpse that they found is Lara Luna, whom her mother identified through her locket.  ===Story 2: 1998=== Lara ([[Rhian Ramos]]) is driving with her younger sister Joy ([[Louise delos Reyes]]) on the same dirt road. As they drive, they pass by a teenage boy walking along the road ([[Alden Richards]]) and a few feet away from him, their car overheats. They get out and then ask him where they can get water and the boy tells them that he'll give them water by his house, which is the same house Luis and the others found years later. As they wait for him outside his house, Lara senses that something is wrong and tells Joy that they should leave. As they try to, the boy comes out and hits them with a wooden stick.  Lara wakes up a few hours later, with her foot chained to a bed post. She hears Joy's screams for help and begs him to let her and her sister go. The boy takes Joy down to the basement and proceeds to savagely beat her. A few minutes later, he returns Joy to her room beside her sister's. Lara apologizes to Joy that she couldn't protect her but Joy tells her that it's not her fault. As the boy comes to take Lara, she puts up a fight and scratches his neck. For now, the boy leaves her alone. Lara notices that he dropped the keys to her chains and proceeds to take it. She tries to search for Joy but notices that she's no longer there. She manages to sneak out of the house and falls into a pit which has corpses dumped in it. She sees that one is Joy. As she cries, she apologizes once again and finally leaves. The boy, meanwhile, has taken their car and proceeds to chase Lara with it. Eventually, he gently runs her over. As Lara tries to crawl away, The boy knocks her out and wraps a plastic bag around her head and ties a belt around her neck and her hands. As he drives back to his house, Lara suddenly awakens, causing the boy to crash. He leaves the car and watches it and Lara burn.  In the present day, Luis takes the officers back to the same house to look for Ella. As he and Officer Allan scope around, they find a picture of the old owners of the house. As Officer Allan goes to search someplace else, Luis finds Ella, who wasn't noticed by Officer Greg. She keeps yelling at him to 'let us go home' and finally passes out as Luis holds her in his arms.

As Ella's father tries to talk to her, she says that their car stalled due to overheating and tells him that they asked a teenage boy for water, revealing that Ella is possessed by Lara. Luis and Officer Allan decide to return to the house.  ===Story 3: 1988=== A young boy ([[Renz Valerio]]) lives with his family in the house deep in the woods. As he looks out of his window, he notices a girl named Martha ([[Ynna Asistio]]) looking for her mother.  The girl was there to see if the family needed their laundry doing. It is revealed that the boy isn't allowed to come out of the house and his abusive mother Carmela ([[Carmina Villaroel]]) tells Martha to come back tomorrow morning. Mistaking her son's conversation with Martha as an attempt to get out, Carmela locks him in a cabinet. During the evening, the boy's father ([[Marvin Agustin]]), who is a preacher, comes home and lets him out of the cabinet. The reason behind his isolation is because his parents believe that the outside world is full of sin. The reason behind Carmela's bitterness is because the family is struggling financially and her husband refuses to ask money from his congregation. The next day, the boy spots Martha doing their laundry. As he comes down and watches her by the door, she invites him to come out to play but he tells her that he's not allowed to go outside. Wanting him to experience some fun, Martha goes inside with a bucket of soap and water to blow bubbles. Carmela comes downstairs and is enraged at the sight. As Martha tries to stop Carmela from hurting the boy, Carmela accidentally knocks Martha into the door post and kills her. As the boy tries to wipe the blood away, he faints. Later that night, the boy wakes up and sees his mother hugging another man. As he goes down, his father tells him to wait upstairs so he and his mother can talk. It is revealed then that Carmela plans to leave her husband and the boy for the man. The boy's father tries to convince her not to do it, but she is stubborn and decides to go through with it. As the boy listens, he passed out by his bed. The next morning his mother wakes him up to have breakfast. When he comes downstairs, his father tells him that Carmela left them and starts to throw up due to drunkenness. The boy adamantly insists that his mother is still there, and in a fit of rage, his father shows him Carmela's corpse, revealing that his father killed Carmela. Frightened, the boy locks himself in the cabinet where he sees Martha's corpse. His father tries to get him out of the cabinet, but when he sees Martha's corpse, he is shocked and has a breakdown. The next morning, the boy comes out of the cabinet. When he enters his parents' room, he sees that his father has hanged himself. It is revealed that the boy didn't go out of the house until he became a teenager, and that he was the one who killed Joy and Lara Luna.  ===Epilogue=== In the present, Luis and Officer Allan arrive at the house. When Allan finds a room bound with a new padlock, Luis orders him to beat the door down. When Allan does so, he sees that the room is a bedroom. As they look around, Officer Allan notices Luis' medal. Luis knocks him out, wraps his head with a sheet and seals it with a belt around his neck, revealing that the boy in the second and third parts of the movie was none other than Luis himself. He walks back to the rendezvous point as other cops search the house. As he walks, he mutters to himself, 'I'm sorry, Mama. It won't happen again.' Back at the rendezvous point, Ella's father asks her who the boy was. Ella, still possessed by Lara, points at Luis. As the Chief of Police calls out to him, Luis shoots the chief in the chest. He gets in his car and begins to drive away, but his car stalls. As he tries to get out, he notices that the ghosts of Joy and Lara are with him in his car. He reaches for his gun and it is shown that Lara is forcing his hand to point his gun to his chin. As he mutters 'Mama, I'm sorry', Lara forces him to shoot himself. A few minutes later, the other cops find Luis in his car, dead.  The film ends with Luis as a young boy, finally able to go outside of his house and be free from his mother.

Ronal and Aliberth search for Elvengard, the [[Elf|elven]] kingdom, to find a library containing the entire world's wisdom, including the location of Kron's sword. They meet a young [[shield-maiden]] named Zandra who kills any warrior that challenges her to a duel. She decides to spare Ronal when, instead of fighting, he starts to cry. Aliberth suggests she could be the fearless warrior the oracle spoke of and Zandra agrees to help save the barbarians. They travel towards a village where an elf lives, Elric, an effeminate elven archer, who agrees to guide them. Zandra is challenged by a strong warrior but Ronal's attempt to avoid a fight leads to him duelling instead. He is saved by the arrival of Volcazar's soldiers and they flee in the chaos.  Elric leads them to the gate of the elven kingdom, a dangerous stone passageway. Ronal insists on going around instead, angering the gate which sets off a trap, almost crushing them. Zandra angrily criticizes Ronal for avoiding problems instead of solving them. Ronal decides to sneak inside the library rather than fight the guards and uses an invisibility potion to go unseen. He succeeds in retrieving the location of the sword inside Kron's tomb, impressing Zandra.  That night, Zandra tells Ronal that shield-maidens can only marry men who defeat them in battle, but she was never defeated and so was sent away to find a strong man capable of defeating her and hopes that such a man is among the barbarians. Ronal points out being defeated is not what love is and they have a romantic moment where they admit they enjoy talking to each other. Zandra is suddenly captured by Volcazar's soldiers while Ronal and Aliberth end up being kidnapped by buxom [[Amazons|Amazonian women]], who have never seen men before and spend the whole night using Ronal for breeding purposes, while Aliberth is made to wait his turn.  Zandra attempts to kill Volcazar during her escape but is defeated by his strength and armour. Volcazar declares himself her master, forcing her to obey him. Ronal succeeds in escaping the Amazonians, leaving Aliberth behind who wants his turn with the ladies. However his conscience gets the better of him and he escapes as well. Ronal succeeds in finding Kron's tomb and retrieves the sword, only to accidentally drop it. Zandra appears and unwillingly hands the dropped sword to Volcazar. With Ronal captured, his blood and the blood of the other barbarians are used to resurrect Zaal, who combines his power with Volcazar, transforming into Zaal's demon form.   Aliberth sneaks inside the fortress and retrieves Kron's sword, passing it to Ronal, who accidentally succeeds in freeing the other barbarians to battle Volcazar's army. Volcazar orders Zandra to execute Ronal but she refuses to kill someone who actually cares about her. Ronal attacks Volcazar with Kron's sword and succeeds in stabbing the same weak spot on his skull Kron once did, destroying both Volcazar and Zaal.  With Ronal believed to be dead the barbarians honour him as the bravest barbarian in history only for Ronal to suddenly wake up, having only been unconscious. As the barbarians celebrate, Zandra kisses Ronal declaring she no longer needs a warrior to defeat her as Ronal has already conquered her heart. They return to the barbarian village where Ronal and Zandra are married, Aliberth becomes popular with the barbarian ladies and Elric becomes the barbarian's new masseuse.

The class has always organized a fashion show, since the famous model Miki was in their class. Miki did not like any of her classmates' clothes designs, and threatened to cancel the fashion show. Beat decides to take up the challenge of designing something that Miki will like. Beat first overhauls Satoru's geeky image as a means to prove his ability. He succeeds, and manages to entice Miki and the rest of the class to use his fashion designs in the upcoming fashion show. Satoru also agrees to help Beat design the runway needed for the show, since Satoru is actually skilled in architectural design. The rest of the class also volunteer their services.  After Miki publicized herself wearing Beat's designs on her official blog, Beat's designs were widely praised on the internet. However, World Stage, a fashion company, simply copied the designs. They also got Miki, who had a modelling contract with them, to model the stolen designs. This action caused people to cast doubt on the originality of Beat's design, causing friction amongst the class. Beat, hurt by the lack of trust, decides to pull out of the fashion show. The class later learns that their school will be closing down after the school year ends due to the lack of funding.

Mei also manages to persuade him to return to designing. The class's enthusiasm level rose again, and they paraded on the streets to publicize their upcoming fashion show.  Mei suddenly confessed her love to Beat one day while he was making his designs. Shocked, Beat tells her that he is not ready for a relationship yet. Beat later finds out from his father's personal assistant the reason why his father abandoned his mother. His father refused to leave the fashion show because Beat's mother told him that if the show was successful, she would also find the strength to overcome her illness. It was then that his respect for his father increased.  Before the show, the group was suddenly informed that World Stage had already booked the new event venue that they were planning to use. Miki was also told that by participating in the fashion show, she will break her contract and her future in modelling will be limited. In spite of this, however, Miki decides to continue participating in the show. The class also decided to revert to their original location, their school. It was also decided to hold the fashion show on March 20, the last day of school. With the townspeople help, they managed to prepare the stage in time for the event. Just before the event started, Beat was told that Kirara had suffered a serious infection and would have to undergo an operation.  In the end, the fashion show took place more or less smoothly, with only minor problems. Beat also invited Mei to put on the wedding dress intended for his mother and walk with him on the runway. The crowd roared their approval, and the participants finally realized that they have the potential to excel, if given the chance. Kirara's operation was also a huge success.

Alfred dismisses the project as "fundamentally unfeasible" because Yemen cannot provide the necessary environment for salmon. Meanwhile, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]]'s press secretary Patricia Maxwell ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]) suggests the salmon fishing story to the Prime Minister's office as a positive story to help improve relations between Britain and the [[Islamic world]].  Alfred meets with Harriet to discuss the project, but despite Harriet correcting his misconceptions of the Yemen environment, Alfred is convinced that the project is foolhardy. Alfred's boss, pressured by Patricia, forces Alfred to accept a position on the project. Alfred considers resigning rather than ruin his reputation in the scientific community, but is convinced by his wife that they need his income and pension.  Harriet arranges for Alfred to meet the sheikh ([[Amr Waked]]) at his estate in the [[Scottish Highlands]].

Devastated, Harriet withdraws to her apartment. When Alfred visits her, she gets upset, thinking he just wants her to return to work, but then she realizes he has come to comfort her, and the two embrace.  Meanwhile, the sheikh continues his work, despite radicals who accuse him of introducing Western ways to their region. Patricia informs the sheikh that because of opposition to removing salmon from British rivers they will need to use farmed salmon. The sheikh does not believe that salmon bred in captivity will survive and rejects Patricia's offer, ending the British government's involvement in the project. Alfred resigns his government job to continue with the project.  After a confrontation with his wife in which he realizes that their marriage is over and that he is in love with Harriet, Alfred convinces the sheikh to give the farmed salmon a try. As the two are fishing, a Yemeni radical attempts to assassinate the sheikh, who is saved by Alfred casting his fishing line towards the assassin. Soon after, they return to the Yemen, where Harriet and Alfred continue to grow closer. After a moonlight swim, he asks her if there was a "theoretical possibility" of the two of them ending up together. She accepts with a kiss on his cheek, but says she will need some time.  At a press conference in Yemen with the [[Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom|Foreign Secretary]], Patricia reunites Harriet and Robert, who survived the antiterrorism operation. The [[Public relations|PR]] stunt leaves Alfred heartbroken.

The following day the fish are released from their holding tanks. The fish swim upstream and everyone celebrates the success of the project. While Robert and the foreign minister fly-fish for the photographers, terrorists break into the dam upstream and open the flood gates. Although most people survive the resulting flash flood, the valley is left in ruins. The sheikh blames himself for the tragedy, and vows to rebuild—this time with the support of the local community.  The next day, as Harriet prepares to leave with Robert, she approaches Alfred to say goodbye. Just then they see a salmon jumping from the water, indicating that some fish survived. Alfred tells Harriet he will stay and help them rebuild. Harriet asks if he will need a partner—and Alfred realizes she is talking about herself. They embrace, and then hold hands while looking out over the river.

Sanctum (film)
 Seventeen-year-old Joshua "Josh" McGuire ([[Rhys Wakefield]]), expedition bank-roller Carl Hurley ([[Ioan Gruffudd]]) and his girlfriend, Victoria "Vic" Elaine (Alice Parkinson), travel to the Esa'ala Cave, an underwater [[Cave diving|cave exploration]] site in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Josh's father, Frank ([[Richard Roxburgh]]), a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. As Josh voices his disdain for his father and his opinions about cave exploration, the team below prepares to dive into an unexplored area of the system.  While exploring the entrance to the new system, Judes ([[Allison Cratchley]]) experiences a problem with her air tank hose. She loses use of her air mask forcing Frank to [[Buddy breathing|buddy breathe]]. After a few exchanges, Judes panics and tries to keep the mask on, but Frank forces the mask off of her knowing he will not have enough air otherwise to make it back to the team. As Judes drowns, Josh watches on a monitor at "forward camp" and presumes the worst of his father. In a struggle to determine who truly was responsible for her death, it is revealed by Frank that Judes had dived in an exhausted state since they previously had to retrieve the extra bailout tanks, a task Josh didn't do. Meanwhile, their above-ground crew realizes that a very big storm is preparing to hit their location sooner than anticipated. They attempt to warn the team below, but are unsuccessful. Josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader Frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.  While Josh climbs back towards the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, water begins rushing in from their exit. The storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a [[cyclone]] causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. As J.D. and Liz make their way up through "the elevator" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), Josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by Luko. As they are making their way back to "forward camp" they discover that Frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting Victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. Josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape.  Unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving Josh to hold Victoria's line and Luko to hold back the boulder. The water rushes through and forces Victoria and Josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. Luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. He is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him.   The team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. Victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear Jude's old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. Before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated Luko surfaces in the cavern. Seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, Frank mercifully [[Euthanasia|drowns him]]. The team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. Without a wetsuit, Victoria suffers severely from the cold water. Meanwhile, George - an experienced, veteran diver - has become ill due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. After a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. George realizes that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with Josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.  As the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. A great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. Josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. As Victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear she is hung on and loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. Using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. At the sight of Victoria's death, Carl becomes psychotic. In a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. Josh and Frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. The tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified WWII [[Japanese tanks of World War II|Japanese tank]] collapsed through the surface years ago. Unfortunately the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out.

Salvation Boulevard
 Carl Vandermeer is a former [[Deadhead]] turned evangelical. He, his wife Gwen and his stepdaughter Angie attend a [[megachurch]], the Church of the Third Millennium, run by the charismatic Pastor Dan Day, who is planning to expand his church into a large Christian community, "City on a Hill". At the start of the film, the Vandermeers attend a debate between Pastor Dan and Professor Paul Blaylock, an outspoken atheist. At the end of the debate, Pastor Dan is invited to Blaylock's college for a nightcap. He brings along Carl. At Blaylock's office, he reveals that he invited Pastor Dan over to propose that the two of them, both bestselling authors, collaborate on a book about their opposing worldviews and views on religion. During a discussion about morality without religion, Pastor Dan picks up an antique pistol and pulls the trigger on Blaylock, unaware that the gun is loaded and functional. The bullet hits Blaylock in the skull, apparently killing him. In a state of shock, Pastor Dan places the gun in Blaylock's hand to make it look like a suicide. He and Carl then drive home in silence, neither of them telling anyone what happened.  After getting a call from a stranger claiming to be his "friend", Pastor Dan approaches Carl's neighbor, videographer Jerry Hobson, and appears to confess to what happened. At the sermon the next day, Pastor Dan informs the congregation that Blaylock survived his "suicide", the bullet was removed and he is in a coma. After the sermon, Jerry takes Carl aside and gets into his car. During the drive, Jerry turns out to have been told by Pastor Dan that Carl was the one who pulled the trigger and tried to cover it up. Jerry drives Carl to a quarry and tries to execute him. He is distracted when Angie, who was asleep in the backseat of the car, interrupts the act, allowing Carl to knock Jerry out with a rock. Carl then meets with Gwen and her father, Jim Hunt, and tells them what happened with Pastor Dan and Jerry, but neither believes him, thinking it was a dream or an "acid flashback". Realizing they will tell Pastor Dan, Carl goes to Blaylock's college, where he runs into Honey Foster, a friend from his Deadhead days who became campus security and met him at the debate. He asks her to turn in the footage from a security camera that would have seen him and Pastor Day enter, buts finds that the footage has been altered to erase them - apparently by Jerry, who worked at the campus as a video technician.  Meeting with Gwen and Jim, Pastor Day convinces them that Carl may be unstable and will react violently if he is caught by the police. Meanwhile, since most of the police are loyal to Pastor Dan, Honey lets Carl hide at her house until things blow over. While they are out driving, Carl's car is stopped by a group of armed men who kidnap him. He wakes up in the house of Jorge Guzman de Vaca, a Mexican crime lord who claims he is in Mexico. Guzman shows that he has a secret recording of Pastor Dan shooting Professor Blaylock. He makes Carl write down and sign two confessions. One tells the truth of what happened, but in the other Carl backs up Pastor Dan's story. Guzman, who has a large business in construction, plans to use the recording to blackmail Pastor Dan into giving him the contract to build City on a Hill, promising to keep Carl in the house until the project is done.  The next morning, when Guzman, revealed to be Pastor Day's mysterious "friend", leaves to make the deal, Carl escapes the house, which turns out to be in the same state as the church, with a DVD containing the footage hidden in a bible. He calls Gwen, asking her not to tell Pastor Dan and to call the police, and later sees a news report revealing that Professor Blaylock has woken up and can tell the truth. Carl is picked up by a detective, who turns out to be in league with Pastor Dan and Jerry, whom Gwen called instead. Jerry and the detective take a handcuffed Carl to an abandoned warehouse to burn him with gasoline, but discover that none of them have any matches or a lighter. When they try to light the gasoline with a [[Taser|stun gun]], they bungle it and get set on fire themselves, allowing Carl to escape. Meanwhile, Pastor Dan meets with Guzman at the construction site of City on a Hill. Guzman tries to play the DVD of the shooting, but instead plays a sex tape he made with his wife. Offended, Pastor Dan starts hitting him, but is stopped when Guzman stabs him in the abdomen and leaves him in the trunk of a car. After a while, Carl arrives by foot and finds the bleeding Pastor Dan, who is hallucinating because of the blood loss and thinks he is at the Pearly Gates, and calls for help on a cell phone. Thinking Carl is an angel, Pastor Dan asks him if he is going to heaven. Out of sympathy, Carl tells him he is. As Carl waits for help to arrive, a bolt of lightning strikes the ground behind him, severing his handcuffs.  The credits reveal that Pastor Day survived, spent two years in jail, where he founded a new ministry inspired by his near-death experience, and became a real-estate broker in Arizona. Gwen divorced Carl citing irreconcilable differences, though Carl still has a good relationship with Angie. Jim started his own private investigation firm and went back to his old Episcopal church. Professor Blaylock continued his teachings against religion. Carl, on the other hand, left the church, began a relationship with Honey and became an "ex-ex-Deadhead."

The Sandman (2011 film)
  Benno ([[Fabian Krüger]]) lives a relatively quiet life, working as a [[stamp dealer]] and living alone, although he frequently visits his girlfriend Patrizia ([[Florine Elena Deplazes]]). However, he has one great irritation in life: His apartment lies above a diner owned by a woman called Sandra ([[Irene Brügger]]), who frequently keeps Benno awake by practising her one-man-band act for a [[talent show]] at night.  One morning, Benno notices that he is losing sand; he cannot explain where it comes from, and tries to ignore it at first, but it increases, and soon he leaves sand almost everywhere he goes. Visits to a doctor do not reveal anything wrong, and a [[psychiatrist]] cannot help either, believing “losing sand” to be Benno's [[metaphor]] for his life instead of taking it literally. Benno even tries calling Dimitri ([[Michel Gammenthaler]]), a television [[psychic]], but is only told to “search within your dreams” and that “the answer is nine”.  Furthermore, it seems that anybody sniffing the sand (including Benno himself) falls asleep. This, and the constant leaking of sand, makes Benno's life more and more problematic, until he realizes that he and Sandra keep dreaming the same dream, but only he is awake and aware that he's dreaming. He asks her for help, and eventually realizes that when he is honest, the sand stops leaking.  Overjoyed, Benno goes out and tries to live a new life in honesty, but it does not work too well: His boss becomes furious when Benno has to admit he's been bringing sand into the office, as well as stealing a famous stamp for himself, and his girlfriend leaves him when he says he does not really love her. Instead, Benno retreats more and more into Sandra's dream, where he is free to do whatever he wants, but in real life, the sand in his apartment is piling up, eventually trapping him. In desperation, he asks Sandra for help in her dream.  Waking up, Sandra indeed rescues him, but is furious that he has been invading her dream. Benno eventually understands the psychic's advice: To be freed of the curse, Sandra must perform the Ode to Joy from [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 9th symphony]], his favorite musical piece, in their shared dream. Reluctantly, she promises to help him, and they practise both in and out of the dream world. However, when the time finally comes to perform the piece with an orchestra (although in an empty hall), Benno realizes he is the [[Music director|director]], and the performance degenerates into [[cacophonia]]. They wake up, and once again become enemies—but as she leaves, Sandra reveals that her practice was for Benno, as she is in love with him.  Dismayed, Benno calls Dimitri again, now outside his television show hours. Dimitri, however, admits being a fraud, who has been making up his “psychic advice”. Benno, now almost totally disintegrated due to all the sand loss, makes a final visit to Sandra, and although he is not allowed into her apartment, he tells her softly how much he “hates her face” and “wants to be as far away as possible from her”. As Sandra opens the door, she sees that all that's left of Benno is sand, proving he really meant the opposite, and sniffs it to join him in a final attempt to perform the symphony. They enter the stage in a packed concert hall, but Benno has realized that they should not perform the symphony, but rather [[Tango Plagööri]], the piece Sandra rehearsed as part of her one-man-band show. As the performance ends and the crowd applauds heavily, they wake up in each other's arms, with all the sand gone.  
Sand Sharks
 Two guys on dirt bikes are riding on the beach, but are then attacked by a predator in the sand. Meanwhile, Jimmy Green (Corin Nemic) the son of the Mayor (Edgar Allan Poe IV) of the small island town of White Sands returns home to throw a party. At the same time the local sheriff John Stone (Eric Scott Woods) is investigating the deaths of the men from earlier believing it to be a murder. Years prior to the events John's wife and child along with 13 other people were murdered in a shark fling at a party Jimmy threw and doesn't believe they are dealing with it again. John's sister, Deputy Brenda Stone (Vanessa Evigan), contacts a shark expert against her brother's wishes.   A couple is devoured by a sand shark and on the other side of the beach as Jimmy is preparing for a layout with Willie (Delpaneaux Wills), Erin (Hilary Cruz) and Amanda Gore (Gina Holden) is confronted by John and Brenda (the latter had a previous fling with Jimmy and is not happy to see him). Just then, a couple having fun on the beach are both attacked by a sand shark causing panic.   At a town meeting, the locals can't afford to have the beaches closed as the town is already in a financial crisis. A man named Angus McSorely (Robert Pike Daniel) tells them they are dealing with actual sand sharks that can swim through sand and offers to take care of them for the town, but is written off as crazy. Sandy Powers (Brooke Hogan), the shark expert Brenda called, was watching the meeting and has a talk with John while examining a shark tooth.   At night two men are being stalked by a sand shark while on their raft in the water. They try to escape but the shark moves on land and devours them. Fearing his party may be cancelled, Jimmy calls someone to bring an already dead shark but because the tooth found does not match the dead shark, the beach must stay closed.   After a power outage caused by the shark, Brenda arrests Jimmy and we learn of their relationship from before the film's events. They spot John on the beach with three guys at gun point as one of them brought a fake shark to fool him into keeping the beaches open. After seeing a dorsal fin moving in the sand they all realize the old man was right. Sparky (Jack Kennedy) who brought the fake shark does not hear the others telling him to get off the sand as he was trying to get the power back on and is killed by the shark who ultimately dies after chomping on the electrical cable causing it to explode and turn to glass.   With the threat gone the beaches are reopen and the party is back on. However the tooth found earlier is only a baby tooth and Sandy believes the dead shark's mother is out there looking for its baby. With the party underway it is revealed there are more sand sharks as both Amanda and Willie are killed by one. More sand sharks appear and start killing the party goers and Brenda is also killed trying to get people off the beach. John and Sandy are stuck on rocks where the sharks can't get to them and the sharks attack the docks with few casualties as Angus shows up to get the people out of there. With the ferry not showing up for another day, Jimmy, John, Angus and Sandy take one final stand against the sand sharks using Jimmy's speakers, napalm and Angus' homemade flamethrower. Unfortunately, the music stops and Jimmy goes to fix the speakers but the wire is torn and the sand sharks swarm Jimmy, who sacrifices himself so the sharks stay in one place as Angus encases them all in glass.   With the sand sharks now encased in glass, the threat appears to be gone, but a large dorsal fin is seen moving in the sand in the cliff above. The mother of the sand sharks bursts through the side and eats Angus. Trapped in Angus' hut John and Sandy make one last effort to kill the mother by tossing a flamethrower full of napalm into her mouth as they escape the hut the flamethrower explodes in the shark's mouth, destroying her and the hut at the same time. Back at the trailer where Erin was hiding after a shark killed Willie in front of her, she is talking to someone who wants to throw a beach party, but is killed by the same shark that ate Willie as it was waiting for her the entire time, hinting that the threat is not over.

Season of the Witch (2011 film)
 In [[Villach]] in the 13th century, three women are accused of [[witchcraft]] by a priest. While one claims to be a witch through persuasion from the church, one doesn't deny it and curses the priest. He orders them hanged and drowned. That done, he urges the guards to pull them back up for a ritual to make sure the so-called witches never come back to life. The guards refuse, claiming they are dead enough. The priest returns late at night to perform the ritual. The third corpse, one of a hag with a blind eye, takes on a demonic appearance and kills the priest.  In the 14th century, German [[Teutonic Knights]] Sir Behmen von Bleibruck (Cage) and Sir Felson (Perlman) are engaged on a crusade, taking part in several different battles throughout the 1330's (1332 Gulf of Edremit, 1334 Siege of Tripoli, 1337 Imbros & 1339 Artah) and eventually in the [[Smyrniote crusades]]. After witnessing the massacre of civilians during the 1344 capture of [[Smyrna]], the two knights desert the Order and the crusade and return to Austria.  While traveling through [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], Behmen and Felson encounter the grotesque sight of people infected with the [[Black Death]] and discover that the [[Holy Roman Empire]] has been swept by the plague. They enter an unnamed town, trying to conceal their identity as deserters, but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen's sword. They are arrested and taken to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] D'Ambroise, who is infected with the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery, where an elite group of monks reside. These monks can determine if the girl is truly a witch, and if she is found guilty, know a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe. The two knights agree under the condition she be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them be dropped. The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest, Debelzaq; a young altar boy, Kay von Wollenbarth, who wants to become a knight like his deceased father; a knight, Sir Johann Eckhardt, whose family was killed by the plague; and the well-traveled [[swindler]] Hagamar, who will serve as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon. The witch, a young girl later identified as Anna from [[Maribor|Marburg]], shows hatred towards Debelzaq and forms a bond with Behmen.  Shortly after setting off, the group camp for the night. Johann decides to take first watch. When Debelzaq comes to relieve him of the watch, Johann says how much she reminds him of his dead daughter, then goes on to speak of the politics of her trial, and how the Church cannot have her not be guilty. Johann decides to give up the mission and goes to convince the others to do the same, leaving Anna alone with Debelzaq. Anna becomes hysterical at the prospect of being left alone with Debelzaq. She attacks him and grabs his key to the cage, then escapes, fleeing toward a nearby village. The search for her leads the group to a mass grave, where Johann has visions of his dead daughter. Chasing the visions, he impales himself on Kay's sword and dies. When they recapture her, the tearful Anna explains that she only ran away for fear of Debelzaq. However the group gradually becomes less trusting of her. They cross a rickety rope bridge, where Anna saves Kay from falling to his death by grabbing him with one hand, showing unnatural strength. The group enters the dark forest called Wormwood, where Hagamar attempts to kill Anna so that the group can go home, only to be stopped by the others. Anna appears to summon monstrous wolves, which chase the group and kill Hagamar. An enraged Behmen tries to kill Anna, but is stopped by Debelzaq and Felson, who point out that the monastery is in sight.  At the monastery, the men find that all the monks have been killed by the plague, but locate the [[Key of Solomon]], an ancient book filled with holy rituals used to defeat evil. The men confront Anna, and Debelzaq begins to perform a ritual used on witches. However, as Anna begins precisely recounting Behmen's past actions during the Crusades, Debelzaq realizes that she is not a witch, and begins frantically performing an [[exorcism]]. However, the [[demon]] that is [[demonic possession|possessing]] Anna reveals himself and melts the metal of the cage. He fights off the knights effortlessly, but when Debelzaq throws a vial of [[holy water]] on him, the demon flies out of sight. As the men search for the demon, they realize he is not trying to escape, but to destroy the book so that nothing can stop his powers. They find a room where the monks were writing copies of the book, where the demon, revealing himself to be [[Baal#Baal-zebub|Baal]], destroys the copies and possesses the dead monks' bodies to use as weapons. The three men fight the possessed monks while Debelzaq continues the exorcism ritual. During the fight, Baal/Anna breaks Debelzaq's neck, then kills Felson. Kay gathers the book and continues the ritual, while Behmen continues fighting Baal/Anna. Behmen is mortally wounded during the fight, but Kay is able to finish the ritual and Baal is expelled from Anna's body, freeing her. After Baal's defeat, Behmen asks Kay to keep Anna safe before dying.  Their fallen friends have been buried and Anna asks Kay to tell her about the men who saved her, so they depart from the monastery with the book.

Seconds Apart
 Four friends are seen at a high school house party drinking and gossiping in a private room. Their fun is cut short when a pair of identical twins - classmates of the friends - enter the room with a video camera. The twins force the friends to play Russian roulette, the game ending only when all four friends are dead. The next day, Detective Lampkin launches an investigation. He interviews classmates of the dead boys, and one student named Katie mentions having seen the twins, Jonah and Seth Trimble, at the party. It is revealed that the twins had once forced Katie to have sex with another boy on camera. Lampkin summons the twins for interrogation, but they maintain their innocence. It is also revealed that Lampkin is a haunted man, traumatized by his inability to save his beloved wife from a house fire.  The twins torture their Headmaster for the name of the person who told Lampkin that they were at the party; they eventually force their Headmaster through telepathy to stab himself to death. They then force Katie to kill herself as well, and then a pedophile whom they meet at a park. Lampkin deduces that the twins possess telepathic powers, and in his search for a cause, he learns that their mother had submitted herself to experimentation at a fertility clinic in order to get pregnant with the twins.   Meanwhile, Jonah falls in love with another student named Eve. As Jonah grows closer to Eve, he pulls away from Seth, finally telling Seth that he wants nothing more to do with the mysterious "project" that they have been conducting. In anger, Seth impersonates Jonah and has sex with Eve to "prove" that Eve cannot tell them apart and therefore must not really be in love with Jonah. The twins brawl at school. Jonah goes home, only to be confronted by Lampkin. Seth returns home shortly after, and it is suddenly revealed that their parents are disfigured and their house is in ruins; as children, the twins forced their parents, who had become suspicious of the twins, to stab each other in the face. Although he had been compliant until now in their charades, Jonah decides that he no longer wants to force people to hurt themselves. After knocking out Lampkin, Seth attacks Jonah and sets the house on fire.  Eve shows up to the house and tries to intervene by shooting Seth in the leg. She flees upstairs, but Seth follows and chokes her. Jonah rescues Eve; as Jonah and Seth struggle, the burning floor gives way and the twins fall through onto the dining room table. Lampkin wakes up and saves Eve from the fire; although he dies from his burns, it is insinuated that Lampkin has redeemed himself for the death of his wife.  The twins lie paralyzed on the dining room table as the house burns around them. Understanding that they will die, the twins finally experience fear for the first time - the ultimate goal of their "project".

However, she finds herself doing all the work in the house. She is also a great devotee of the magnificent Lord Murugan. Residing in [[Pazhani]], she is unable to attend the temple. In a dream she finds herself at her wedding with an unknown man. The next day that man comes to the house. He is none other than Amritavalli's own grandson Mano ([[Unni Mukundan]]). He falls head over heels in love with Maha. Maha, though hesitant at first, finds herself in love with him as well.   Mano constantly assures her that his mother will arrange marriage. However, as fate has it, Mano is afraid to admit to his mother Thangam ([[Suhasini Maniratnam]]) that he is in love. This encourages Thangam to fix his marriage with her childhood friend's daughter. However, when Thangam comes to know of the love affair, she is helpless and all she is able to do is encourage the lovebirds to forget each other. Soon everyone (except Amritavalli, Thangam and Mano) treat Maha in a rude way as a servant, not a family member. Maha, angry, claims to Lord Murugan that she will not face ever again.  Enters Saravanan ([[Dhanush]]). Saravanan enters as the cook appointed by Madhava Gounder ([[Ilavarasu]]). Everyone finds his cooking awesome. However, Maha disapproves as cooking was her only peaceful hobby in the house after she fell in Love. Saravanan is told to stay in the guest house where Gumbidiswamy ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]) is staying. Gumbidiswamy is a fraud and is now trying to pass as a presit in strong believe of god. For this reason he has stayed at their house. It did not take Saravanan long to realize that Gumbidiswamy is a fraud and he used this to blackmail him. Having this control over Gumbidiswamy, Saravanan tells him to tell everyone that according to background and religious research, Mano and his fiancee are not suitable for each other. After doing many things such as this, Saravanan is able to get Maha and Mano together. Thangam and Amritavalli agree to let Mano marry Maha. Maha and Mano (on the day of their wedding) search for Saravanan to thank him for his help. Instead of Saravanan, another person comes and says he is the only Saravanan around the area. Disappointed, Maha goes to Murugan's Altar to pray and there she sees Saravanan. He soon fades away. At that point, Maha understood that Saravanan was Murugan in human form - in the Hindu religion it is believed that god may come down to earth in a human form to help those in need.  
Seeking Justice
 In [[New Orleans]], Will Gerard ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is a humble English teacher at Rampart High School. Will's best friend Jimmy ([[Harold Perrineau]]) also works at the school. Will's wife Laura ([[January Jones]]) is a musician who is in a local orchestra. One night, after a performance, Laura is beaten and brutally raped by a stranger named Hodge (Alex Van).  At the hospital, while Will is waiting for news about Laura's condition, Jimmy tells a distraught Will that he is confident that the rapist will be found. A stranger who calls himself Simon ([[Guy Pearce]]) tells Will that he represents an organization that deals with criminals the justice system has not. Simon describes his group as "a few citizens seeking justice." He says Hodge was paroled three weeks before his attack on Laura, that he has raped other women before, and that he will do it again.  Simon proposes an intriguing offer; in exchange for a favor from Will to be determined later, Simon will arrange to have a complete stranger make Hodge pay for Laura's rape. This would spare Will and Laura a drawn-out trial, which would make Laura suffer even more than she already has by repeatedly forcing her to relive the rape, and to be traumatized by defense attorneys. Distraught and grief-stricken, Will consents to the deal. Hodge is killed, and a picture of Hodge's body, along with a necklace that Hodge took from Laura during the rape, are sent to Will as proof. The organization's code phrase is: "The hungry rabbit jumps."  Six months later, Simon returns. He wants Will to follow a woman and her two children to the zoo and to look out for a man. If Will sees this man, he must call a number attached to a picture. Will agrees, hoping this will fulfill his debt. Simon, however, continues to call Will, asking him to continue what he is doing, claiming the man is a sex offender. Having no choice, as Simon promises to exact revenge if he does not obey, a reluctant Will agrees. He is instructed to kill the man on a pedestrian walkway that is under a high overpass by "accidentally" bumping him off it to his death, making it look like suicide.  Instead of killing the man, Will decides to see if the man has any knowledge of Simon. The man, already paranoid, becomes suspicious that Will is there to kill him. He throws his bicycle at Will. As they struggle, the man falls off the walkway despite Will's efforts to save him. The man lands and is hit by a truck. Will goes home, where Detective Rudeski (Joe Chrest) and Detective Green ([[Marcus Lyle Brown]]) arrest him for murdering the man, whose name is Alan Marsh. At the station, Will cannot get Green and Rudeski to believe anything he says.  The detectives' boss, Lieutenant Durgan ([[Xander Berkeley]]), wants to talk to Will alone. Durgan wants to play a game, asking Will to complete sentences. After a few rounds, Durgan asks, "A hungry rabbit..." to which Will responds "Jumps. A hungry rabbit jumps", signifying his connection to Simon's organization. Durgan lets Will go free, giving him 24 hours to get out of the city before Simon and his henchmen Scar (Irone Singleton) and Cancer (Wayne Pére) come looking for him.  Will runs, but he is looking for answers. He goes to a memorial for Alan, and finds out that the man was not a sex offender but actually an award-winning investigative reporter for the ''New Orleans Post'', who was investigating the vigilante organization. Will now knows why Simon wanted Alan dead. Simon, Scar, and Cancer suddenly turn up. Scar chases Will out onto a busy street, but is accidentally killed by an SUV that hits and drags him.  Will goes to a storage facility that Alan used and finds a DVD describing some of the people in the group, along with their missions. Will explains what is happening to Laura, who says she would have done the same had their situations been reversed. Will then tells Laura his whereabouts, advising her to stay away from the cops and anyone else who is asking questions.  Will learns that Simon's real name is Eugene Cook and that Jimmy joined the organization years ago, after his brother was murdered and the cops were unable to find the killer. Will sends Cook a clip of video by phone, showing that he has the DVD and what it contains. Cook agrees to a trade where Will will receive the security camera footage proving his innocence in Alan's death, as he was acting out of self-defense, in exchange for the DVD. Will agrees, and they agree to meet at the [[Louisiana Superdome]], during a monster truck show.  At the dome, Will is told that Laura has been kidnapped as an extra incentive to make him give up the DVD. They go to a nearby mall, abandoned since [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Jimmy, Cancer, and a man called Sideburns ([[Dikran Tulaine]]) are holding Laura at gunpoint, with her hands tied and duct tape over her mouth. Will gives up the DVD, but Cook reneges on the deal, saying that Will and Laura will both be killed to remove all threats to the organization. He orders them to be shot.  Cancer is about to pull the trigger on a bound and tapegagged Laura when he is fatally shot by Jimmy, after which Will forces Sideburns down an inactive escalator, then through the glass at the bottom of the escalator. Sideburns is killed when a chunk of the glass impales his neck.  Jimmy says that they did not get into the organization to kill innocent people. Cook and Jimmy exchange gunfire, until Cook kills Jimmy with two shots to the chest. Laura removes the strip of duct tape gagging her mouth and flees with a gun in her hand. Cook catches her and throws her into a glass display case, causing her to drop the gun. Will arrives and begins beating up Cook, but both fall onto another escalator, rolling to the bottom. Laura, who has grabbed the gun that Cook forced her to drop, shoots Cook six times, killing him.  Happy to be alive, Will and Laura walk back up the escalator. Durgan arrives, asking who killed Cook. Will responds that it was him, but Durgan says that the way he sees it, the dead guys killed each other. There was no one else there.  With the DVD still in hand, Will is cleared of any wrongdoing. He decides to follow up on Alan's work by giving the DVD to Gibbs ([[Mike Pniewski]]), a reporter whom Will met at Alan's memorial. Thanking him, Gibbs says, "The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?" indicating to a surprised Will that Gibbs is also in the organization.  
Sector 7 (film)

A Separation
 Simin wants to leave the country with her husband, Nader, and daughter, Termeh, as the former does not want Termeh to grow up under the prevailing conditions. This desire is not shared by Nader, who is concerned for his father, who lives with the family and suffers from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. When Nader determines to stay in [[Iran]], Simin files for [[Divorce (Islamic)|divorce]].  The [[family court]] judges the couple's problems insufficient to warrant divorce and rejects Simin's application. She leaves her husband and daughter and moves back in with her parents. On the recommendation of Simin, Nader hires Razieh, a young, deeply religious woman from a poor suburb, to take care of his father while he is at work. Razieh has applied for the job without consulting her hot-tempered husband, Hodjat, whose approval, according to tradition, would have been required. Her family is financially dependent on the job, and she takes her daughter to the house with her.  Razieh soon becomes overwhelmed by taking care of Nader's father, which is physically and emotionally demanding. She finds the work very heavy, especially as she is pregnant. The job even tests her religious beliefs when the old man [[Urinary incontinence|wets himself]], and she must call a hotline to determine whether it would be sinful for her to clean him.  One day, Nader and Termeh return to discover her grandfather lying unconscious on the floor in his bedroom, with one of his arms tied to the bed. Razieh is nowhere to be found. When she returns, Nader accuses her of neglecting his father and of having stolen money from his room (unbeknownst to Nader, Simin used the money to pay [[Moving company|movers]]). Outraged, Nader shoves Razieh out of the apartment. She falls in the stairwell outside. Hodjat's sister later calls Simin to inform her that Razieh is in the hospital because she has suffered a [[miscarriage]].  A [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] is assigned to determine the cause of the miscarriage and Nader's potential responsibility for it. If it is proved that Nader knew of Razieh's pregnancy and caused the miscarriage, he could be sentenced for murder. Nader accuses Razieh of neglecting his father. The hot-headed and aggressive Hodjat physically confronts Nader on several occasions, and threatens him, his family, and Termeh's teacher, who testifies on Nader's behalf. When Hodjat is [[Detainment|detained]] for another outburst, Razieh reveals that he has [[mental disorder]]s, and that he is under [[therapy]], leading to his release. Nader learns that the reason Razieh was absent that day was because she had gone to visit a [[physician]], which Razieh had avoided revealing earlier. This news, combined with Hodjat's explosive temper, causes Nader to wonder if Hodjat is [[Physical abuse|physically abusive]] to Razieh and had caused her miscarriage.  Termeh protects Nader's position with a false statement and Simin, fearing for Termeh's safety, attempts to arrange a financial deal with Razieh and Hodjat, to pay [[Blood money (restitution)|blood money]] for the loss of their child. Nader is initially outraged by Simin's suggestion, as he feels that it would be an admission of guilt. But he also must admit that he lied about his knowledge of Razieh's pregnancy. However, Razieh reveals to Simin she has serious doubts as to whether Nader's actions caused the miscarriage, considering she had earlier been hit by a car while retrieving Nader's father when he had wandered out of the apartment and had first experienced symptoms of the miscarriage that night. Razieh fears that without the money Nader can provide in or out of court Hodjat will not be able to pay back his debtors, destroying their family. After another full-blown argument, Simin forces Termeh to leave with her. Nader agrees to the payment and asks Razieh to swear on the [[Qur'an]] that he is the cause of her miscarriage. Since she has doubts, she refuses, though Hodjat tries to force her to avoid dishonor in front of his creditors.  Later, at the family court, Nader and Simin have filed for a divorce once again. The judge makes their separation permanent, and asks Termeh which parent she chooses to live with. She states that she has made a decision, but asks that the judge tell her parents to wait outside before she tells him.

It ends with Dash beating KC to death. Dash then tries to get Amy to leave the church with him. However, a cocaine-fuelled Amy has a traumatic flashback involving her mother trying to drown her as a child. In this frenzy, she stabs Dash, who is trying to restrain her. She is then found by Inspector Mathur.  The police, despite knowing the truth, get the three surviving friends to sign a statement saying that Dash had kidnapped all four.

Meanwhile, Hou's deputy, Cao Man, ambitious and feeling used by Hou, has decided to betray him. During the dinner, Song states his intention to retire and cede everything to Hou but is then secretly warned Hou means to kill him. In rage and embarrassment, Hou fatally wounds Song. Both families are then attacked by Cao's assassins. Despite being shot by Hou, Song saves him with a warning, allowing him to escape, and then dies. While fleeing, Hou's wife and daughter are separated. Hou's wife is rescued by some passing-by Shaolin monks who were stealing rice from the military granary to help refugees living at the temple. Hou escapes with his daughter, but she is severely injured by the assassins' carriage. After a chase by the assassin carriages, Hou and his daughter fall off a cliff. In desperation, he brings her to Shaolin, begging the monks to save her life. Their efforts were in vain however, and she dies of her injuries. Hou's wife blames him for the death of their daughter and leaves him. Hou attacks the monks in anger but is quickly subdued.  Hou wanders in shock near Shaolin until he meets the monk cook Wudao, who provides him food and shelter, after many days being stranded under a pit. Hou feels guilty for his past misdeeds and decides to become a monk and atone for his sins. Initially in his stay, some monks are still angry at him, but he decides to stay. During his stay in Shaolin, he gradually learns Shaolin's principles through study and martial arts, reforms, and finds peace and enlightenment. From the refugees, Hou discovers Cao had recruited male refugees to build a railway -- a concession he opposed when he was still a warlord -- and the workers have disappeared. Hou discovers that Cao has been unearthing antique relics on pretext of building a railway and having the refugees massacred afterwards to silence them. Hou intimidates the guards burying recent victims, then loads the corpses in a cart and drag it to the temple gate, where villagers and refugees identify their missing loved ones.  After Cao is informed Hou is still alive, he leads his soldiers to the temple to capture him. Hou volunteers to go with Cao so he can distract him while the monks break into Cao's house to save the imprisoned labourers. Hou is reunited with his wife and escapes with her when rescue plan succeeds. Hou's senior, Jingneng, is brutally killed by Cao while covering for his juniors to escape. Upon returning to Shaolin Temple, the monks decide that they need to evacuate in order to avoid further trouble. Wudao leads the refugees away while Hou and the other monks remain behind to defend the temple and buy time. Cao arrives with his troops and attacks Shaolin. At the same time, the foreigners find they have been cheated and decide to silence Cao and the entire Shaolin community. They bombard Shaolin with artillery, killing many of the monks and Cao's soldiers. Hou defeats Cao in a fight but eventually sacrifices himself to save Cao from being crushed by a falling beam. He falls into the Buddha statue's palm and dies peacefully, leaving Cao feeling guilty. The surviving monks kill the foreigners and stop the bombardment. Meanwhile, the refugees, fleeing on a mountainside, cry as they look down at the temple in ruins. Wudao tells them the Shaolin spirit will continue to live in them even though the temple has been destroyed.  Before the evacuation of the temple, Hou had met his wife for the last time. Repenting for his past, he gave the urn containing his daughter's cremated ashes to his wife. She forgave him for his past and accepted the fact she could no longer be with him, even though she prefers his present self to the old one. Hou refused to leave Shaolin and stayed behind to defend it and cover the refugees' escape. Admitting that Cao's present evil doings stems from his own past misdeeds, Hou stated it was solely his responsibility to guide Cao to the correct path.

Holmes finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated moments later. Adler meets with [[Professor Moriarty]] to explain the events, but Moriarty, deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes, poisons and kills her.  Later, Dr. Watson arrives at [[221B Baker Street]], where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks and business acquisitions around the globe that he has connected to Moriarty. After meeting up with his brother [[Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] at Watson's bachelor party, Holmes meets with Gypsy fortune-teller Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can [[Interrogation|interrogate]] her. After the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Voicing his respect for Holmes' perseverance, Moriarty informs Holmes that he murdered Adler. Holmes vengefully vows to defeat him and subtly requests Watson and Mary be left alone now that Watson is no longer working with him, but Moriarty indicates he will kill them if Holmes continues to interfere.  Moriarty's men attack Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon. Holmes, having followed the pair to protect them, throws Mary from the train into a river below where she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriarty's men, Holmes and Watson travel to [[Paris]] to locate Simza. When she is found, Holmes tells Simza that she has been targeted because Rene is working for Moriarty and may have told her about his plans. Simza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and Rene had formerly belonged. They learn that the anarchists have been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty.  The trio follows Holmes' deduction that the bomb is in the [[Paris Opera]]. However, Holmes realizes too late that he has been tricked and that the bomb is in a nearby hotel; its explosion kills a number of assembled businessmen. Holmes discovers that the bomb was a cover for the specific assassination of Alfred Meinhard, one of the attendees, by Moriarty's henchman, [[Sebastian Moran]]. Meinhard's death grants Moriarty ownership of Meinhard's arms factory in [[German Empire|Germany]]. Holmes, not wishing to repeat his mistake from the previous evening, spies on Moriarty, learning he is travelling to Germany. Holmes deduces it is to visit his newly acquired factory and so the trio follow him there.  At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates, and [[torture]]s Holmes while Watson fights Moran. Holmes spells out Moriarty's plot, revealing that the Professor secretly acquired shares in multiple [[war profiteering]] companies using various [[Pseudonym#Concealment of identity|pseudonyms to conceal his identity]] and intends to instigate a [[First World War|world war]] to make himself a fortune. Meanwhile, Watson uses the cannon he had been hiding behind to destroy the watchtower in which Moran is concealed. The structure collapses into the warehouse where Moriarty is holding Holmes captive. Watson, Simza, and an injured Holmes reunite and escape aboard a moving train. Holmes deduces that Moriarty's final target will be a peace summit in [[Switzerland]], creating an [[international incident]].  At the summit, Holmes deduces that Rene is the assassin and that he is disguised as one of the ambassadors, having been given radical [[reconstructive surgery]] by Hoffmanstahl. Holmes and Moriarty, who is also in attendance, retreat upon a balcony to discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. Watson and Simza find Rene and stop his assassination attempt, but Rene is discreetly killed by Moran. Despite his war being averted, Moriarty remains confident in his victory, warning Holmes that the nations of Europe will inevitably go to war with one another regardless of Moriarty's manipulations. Holmes then reveals that, while being tortured by Moriarty, he replaced the professor's personal diary that contained all his plans and financing with a duplicate. The original was sent to Mary in [[London]], who decrypted the code using a book that Holmes had noticed in Moriarty's office during their first meeting, before passing the information to [[Inspector Lestrade]], who seizes Moriarty's assets and donates his fortune to anti-war charities. Holmes and Moriarty anticipate an impending physical altercation, and both realise that Moriarty would win due to Holmes' injured shoulder. Out of options and with the sadistic Moriarty promising to torture and kill Watson and Mary afterward, Holmes grabs Moriarty and lunges backwards over the balcony and into the [[Reichenbach Falls]] below. Both are presumed dead.  Following Holmes' funeral, Watson and Mary prepare to have their belated honeymoon when Watson receives a package containing a breathing device of Mycroft's that Holmes had noticed and expressed a liking for before the summit. Realizing that Holmes may still be alive, Watson leaves his office to find the delivery man. Holmes, having concealed himself in Watson's office by using one of his urban camouflage suits, reads Watson's memoirs on the typewriter and adds a question mark after the words "The End".

While her father works upstairs, there is a knock on the door and Sarah answers it, meeting a young woman named Sophia who claims to be one of Sarah's childhood friends, though Sarah does not remember her. The two plan to meet again later.  Soon after, Sarah hears strange noises upstairs and immediately notifies her father. He is not worried, but goes to check, finding nothing. Sarah calms down, but soon hears the sound of her father falling down the stairs. Panicked, she tries to leave the house but all exits are locked or boarded up, and she hides from an unknown perpetrator who attempts to grab hold of her under a table. Sarah searches for her father and finds him unconscious with a head wound. She runs to the basement in search of the cellar door leading outside, and finds a bed and other human necessities, evidence that someone else has been living there, possibly [[squatters]]. She sees a figure shining a light in the basement to find her but she escapes out the cellar door.  Outside, she meets her uncle, who has returned, and sees a young girl on the side of the road who disappears before her eyes. Her uncle insists on driving them back to the house to rescue her father, despite Sarah's plea that they should both go get help. They discover her father's body to be missing, and find a generator lamp running on the third floor of the house in the [[pool room|billiard room]]. While searching the billiard room, the generator kicks off; the only source of light available is a [[instant camera|Polaroid camera]]'s flash.  Through a series of intermittent camera flashes, Sarah sees the young girl and an unidentified man in the room. The power returns to reveal that her uncle is missing. She hides under the pool table while two men take pictures, presumably [[pedophilia|pedophilic]] in nature, of an unseen girl on the top of the table. Sarah then sees one of the men dragging her uncle's body toward the staircase. She unsuccessfully attempts to shoot one of the men with her uncle's gun.  Sarah returns to her room to hide, and begins to exhibit signs of [[paranoia]] and [[psychosis]]. She has hallucinations that depict traumatic childhood events, including a blood stain appearing on her bed, a young girl in the bathtub with beer bottles and bloody water, and a toilet spewing blood. These vivid hallucinations frighten Sarah, and she runs downstairs.  In the foyer, she runs into Sophia, and finds her now conscious father wrapped in plastic, sitting up in the living room. Sophia gives Sarah a key to a box containing pedophilic pictures of Sarah as a little girl, implying that her father sexually abused and photographed her. It is suggested that her recent interactions and hallucinations with the little girl and mystery attacker have been a kind of traumatic repressed memory. Events at the house have caused this memory to reappear, and Sarah is now exacting her revenge, although she has been confusing the difference between the events that are in her subconscious from her childhood and what she is actually doing now, which is highly likely to be a result of [[dissociative identity disorder]], where she attacks and assaults her father and uncle in her "intruder" mode while she simultaneously wanders the house as a victim trying to escape.  The "intruder" is then shown dragging her unconscious uncle into the living room before the next scene reveals that it's actually Sarah herself. Sarah then realizes Sophia is only another figment of her imagination and Sophia vanishes. Her father convinces Sarah, who is still deeply traumatized and reliving her horrific childhood experiences with him, to untie him. Once untied, her father slaps her and whips her to the floor with his belt. Her uncle then regains consciousness and tries to stop her father, who mocks his brother's pleas. As his back is turned, Sarah bludgeons his head with a sledgehammer, killing him. Her uncle begs for mercy and tells her he should have stopped the [[rape]] and abuse that went on at the hands of her father. Sarah leaves him and walks outside silently.

Soon, the entire Goa Police Force reach his home to kill him, with DGP Pawar and  DSP Patkar, now in support of Singham. Jaikant eventually escapes but after running through the city, he is arrested by the police the next morning.

One day when Noah is returning home from his girlfriend's house, his mother is about to leave to a party with a friend of hers. His mother then receives a phone call from her friend who informs her that her children's babysitter canceled last minute. Noah then takes over as babysitter so his mother can go to the party.  When Noah arrives at the house, he meets all of the kids immediately. The oldest son Slater ([[Max Records]]) is a kid with a severe anxiety  disorder, their second oldest son Rodrigo ([[Kevin Hernandez]]) is a [[pyromaniac]] who was adopted from El Salvador. The youngest child is their daughter Blithe ([[Landry Bender]]) who is obsessed with pop culture and loves to wear makeup. As soon as the Pedulas leave, the children start to act obnoxious (smashing vases, making fart noises, and attempting to grab the TV remote from Noah).  While in the middle of babysitting, Marisa calls Noah and she asks him to bring cocaine for a party that she's at, saying that she'll repay him with sex afterwards. Noah immediately accepts, and he and the children leave to go get the drugs from Marisa's friend. When they finally arrive, Noah meets drug dealer Karl ([[Sam Rockwell]]) and his assistant Julio ([[JB Smoove]]). As soon as Karl gives the drugs to Noah, Rodrigo bursts in claiming that he has to go to the bathroom. When Noah leaves, he sees that Rodrigo has stolen a baby dinosaur egg filled with [[cocaine]] from Karl's house. While attempting to get the egg back from Rodrigo, the egg smashes pouring cocaine all over Noah's face.  Karl then calls Noah about the stolen eggs, and tells him that if he doesn't bring the egg back or the $10,000 he owes for the egg, he will kill him.  Not wanting to be a part of this, Slater asks Noah to take the three of them to the party where their parents are. When Noah sees his mother actually having a good time at the party he can't bring himself to interfere and decides to bring the kids with him. Slater then tells Noah that a bunch of girls are texting him asking him to attend a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|bat mitzvah]] for Wendy Sapperstein (a girl that goes to his school). He tells Noah that the bat mitzvah is being held at the Grand Prospect Hall. Noah then comes up with the idea that they can steal the money Wendy gets.  At the bat mitzvah, Noah manages to only steal $3,000 because he had to leave due to Rodrigo urinating on the floor. When they leave, they find out that Tina ([[Samira Wiley]]), who went to high school with Noah, has stolen the car to get revenge on Noah who went to a party at her house, and threw up on her grandmother's ashes due to him being drunk. Noah gives the $3,000 to Karl and also brings $7,000 worth of checks. Karl refuses the checks and gives Noah one more chance at getting the $7,000. He tells Noah to meet him at the party Marisa is at with the money and if he doesn't, he will kill him.  Noah then goes to his dad ([[Bruce Altman]]) for help, but he refuses because he now hates Noah due to him dropping out of college and just being a loser in general. An angry Noah steals his father's car keys and drives to a jewelry store his dad owns. Noah then steals enough jewelry to pay back Karl, but then Rodrigo blows the store up after placing a cherry bomb in the bathroom. Rodrigo then throws a temper tantrum, and then throws Slater's fanny pack containing pills out the window. Noah stops the car so Slater can get the pills. Noah tells Slater that he's not going to find them, and it is then revealed that Slater is homosexual, and the pills were the only thing that kept him "normal." Noah then makes Slater accept the fact that he's gay, and that there is nothing wrong with it.  The group then sees their original car drive by them, and they track it down to a club where Noah confronts Tina about stealing the car. Tina finally let's go of her anger towards Noah  by punching him in the face. After Noah leaves, they go head out to get the money to Karl but Noah gets pulled over by the police who steal the jewelry and the cocaine that Karl originally gave him. Noah's only plan now is to get Marisa out of the party and escape Karl, but Karl's gang tracks him down and attempts to kill Noah and the kids, but Noah manages to get away. Then Noah engages in a car chase with Karl and Julio. They make Karl's car crash by Rodrigo throwing a cherry bomb in their van, but this causes Noah to spin out, and Karl holds him at gunpoint.  Noah manages to run away and Karl uses up all his ammo wasting it on shooting at Noah. Then, Blithe calls Tina's gang, and they beat Karl up so they can escape.  Before Noah drops Marisa off at her house, the two break up. Noah then manages to get the kids home on time, and they see that everything that went on that night is on the news. Mr. and Mrs. Pedula finally arrive home, and they pay Noah for the night.  During the end credits, we find out what happens to all the main characters: Noah got a new girlfriend; Slater grew up and got a job at the entertainment industry; Blithe gave up her pop culture obsession, and started inventing perfumes as an adult; Rodrigo gave up being a pyromaniac; Karl was hospitalized after being beat up by Tina's gang; and Julio died due to him burning to death.

Patton]]) during the making of Six Million And One. Photo taken by Irit Shimrat]] Joseph Fischer's memoir was discovered only after his death. His children refused to confront it, except for David, the filmmaker, for whom it became a compass for a long journey. When David found it unbearable to be alone in the wake of his father's survival story and in his struggle not to lose his sanity, he convinced his brothers and sister to join him in the hope that this would also contribute to releasing tensions and bring them as close as they used to be. His siblings, for their part, couldn’t understand why anyone should want to dig into the past instead of enjoying life in the present. The journey eventually leads the Fishers into the dark depths of the [[:de:B8 Bergkristall|B8 Bergkristall tunnels]], part of the Austrian [[Gusen concentration camp|KZ Gusen II concentration camp]], where their father endured forced labor during the Holocaust.<ref>[http://www.gusen.org/] Gusen Memorial Committee</ref> Illuminated only by flashlights, they seek meaning in their personal and family histories and undergo surgical and revealing discussions about family, survival and individualism only to come to the realization that they are unable to fully understand their father's past and the events that haunted him.

The Skin I Live In
 Plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard was successful in cultivating an [[artificial skin]] resistant to burns and insect bites, which he calls "GAL", that he says he has been testing on [[athymic mice]]. He presents his results in a medical symposium but when he privately discloses he has also conducted illegal [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] experiments on humans, he is forbidden to continue with his research.  On his secluded estate, Ledgard is keeping a young woman named Vera captive, with the help of one of his servants, Marilia. Due to the suspension of his official experiments, Robert asks Marilia to dismiss the other servants.  While Robert is out, Marilia's son Zeca, having committed a robbery, arrives and asks his mother to hide him for a few days. He sees Vera on Ledgard's security camera screens and demands to see her in person. When Marilia refuses to let him stay after she invites him in, he binds and gags her and then rapes Vera. Robert arrives and kills Zeca.  While Robert disposes of Zeca’s body, Marilia tells Vera that she (Marilia) is the mother of both Zeca and Robert by different men, a fact she has not shared with them. Robert was adopted by Marilia’s employers but was ultimately raised by her. Zeca later left to live in the streets and smuggle drugs, while Robert went to medical school and married a woman named Gal. When Zeca came back years later, he and Gal ran off together. They were involved in a terrible car crash in which Gal was badly burnt. Thereafter she lived in total darkness without any mirrors. One day, while hearing her daughter Norma singing in the garden, Gal accidentally saw her own reflection in the window; traumatized by the sight, she jumped to her death.  In the present, Robert returns and spends the night with Vera. During the night, he dreams of his past, specifically the night of a wedding six years earlier, where he finds Norma (his daughter) unconscious on the ground. Norma, who had been taking medication for psychosis--having been rendered mentally unstable due to witnessing her mother's suicide--comes to believe that she was raped; she develops a fear of all men and spends eight years in a mental health facility. She eventually kills herself in the same manner that her mother did.  Vera, too, dreams about the same event: Vicente, a young man who works in his mother's dress shop, crashes the wedding and meets Norma. Like others at the party, he is under the influence of drugs.  He walks with Norma into the garden.  Norma begins to take off some of her clothes, stating she would be naked all the time if she could.  Vicente kisses her and compliments her.  While they are lying down with Vicente on top of her,  she suddenly starts repeating "no, no, no" and begins screaming.  She bites his hand.  Surprised, he slaps her, knocking her unconscious. He flees the scene, confused and nervous, just before Robert arrives.  Robert tracks down Vicente, kidnaps him, and subjects him to [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Over a period of six years, Robert physically transforms Vicente into a replica of his late wife, and calls him Vera. During this period of time, Vicente struggles to keep himself sane and cling to the core of his true identity.  After an absence of four years, Marilia returns to work in Robert’s house to look after Vera (Vicente). Vera reveals to Marilia that he has been held captive for the last six years.  Back in the present, Robert's new relationship with Vera dismays Marilia, who does not trust Vera. Fulgencio, one of Robert's colleagues, reads a news story about the missing Vicente and recognizes him as one of their sex change patients. He accuses Robert of falsifying Vicente's consent and of experimenting on him. Vera arrives to support Robert, asserting his willing participation. During the night, Robert and Vera try to have sex, but Vera tells him that she is still sore from being raped. Ostensibly going downstairs to find lubricant, she retrieves Robert's gun and kills Robert and Marilia.  Freed from captivity and the need to play along with Robert's whims, Vicente (Vera) returns to his mother's dress shop for the first time since being kidnapped. He tearfully tells his lesbian ex-colleague Cristina (whom Vicente had loved six years prior) of his kidnapping, forced sex change, and the murders. Then, as his mother enters the room, Vicente quietly reveals his identity to her in the final line of the movie -- "I am Vicente."

Not wanting this vision to come true, Papa Smurf disallows Clumsy to pick Smurf Roots. Clumsy disobeys Papa and ends up unintentionally leading Gargamel and Azrael to the village. The Smurfs all flee for their lives while Clumsy unknowingly runs towards the Forbidden Falls, with Papa Smurf, [[Smurfette]], Grouchy, [[Brainy Smurf|Brainy]] and Gutsy running after him. They find him at the edge of a cliff, and while trying to help him up, they are sucked into a gigantic vortex that spirits them to present day [[New York City]]. To make matters worse, Gargamel and Azrael follow them through the vortex. The Smurfs end up in the apartment of Patrick and Grace Winslow, a married and expectant couple, and their [[Basset Hound]] Elway. After introducing themselves and explaining their situation, the Winslows befriend them and allow them to stay in their apartment. The next day, needing to find a "star gazer" (a telescope), the Smurfs follow Patrick to his workplace at Anjelou Cosmetics, misunderstanding the previous explanation of his job as fortune-telling. He calls Grace to pick them up.  However, having extracted "Smurf essence" from a lock of Smurfette's hair, Gargamel also arrives at Anjelou Cosmetics and ends up being treated favorably by Patrick's boss Odile when he uses most of his acquired magic on her elderly mother by restoring her youth and attractiveness. But Gargamel resumes his search upon recognizing Patrick and following him to [[FAO Schwarz]], but gets arrested after stealing a leaf blower and for causing chaos in the store with some customers while trying to catch the Smurfs. Gargamel manages to bust out of prison with the aid of flies (he encountered a moth and told it to bring him eagles to help him escape). By that time, Papa Smurf manages to calculate the night he and the others can get home. But first, he must figure out the spell to do so. Patrick tells them that there is an old bookstore in the city near Anjelou Cosmetics that may contain the spell Papa Smurf needs.  Meanwhile Patrick bonds with the Smurfs after sending what he believed to be his finished advertisement to be published. However, the next day, Patrick learns that Clumsy accidentally attached Patrick's first attempt at the advertisement (a blue-moon themed image that Patrick was not confident enough to submit) and he loses his temper before walking out on both the Smurfs and Grace to save his job.  Forced to search on their own, the Smurfs find the store and find the book ''L’Histoire des Schtroumpfs'' by researcher [[Peyo]], containing the spell to turn the moon blue. But learning of their location, Gargamel sneaks into the bookstore and finds a dragon wand, transferring his magic into it as he uses it to capture Papa Smurf as he sends the others to safety. Though the Smurfs promised Papa Smurf that they won't try to save him and return home, Clumsy and Patrick, having seen the error of their actions after Grace gave him a sonogram picture of their baby, convince them to plan a rescue. At [[Belvedere Castle]], after increasing the dragon wand's power with "Smurf essence" extracted from bits of Papa Smurf's beard, Gargamel finds himself facing all the Smurfs, summoned to New York by Brainy after he reopened the vortex by conjuring the blue moon. As the Smurf army battles Gargamel, Smurfette defeats Azrael and saves Papa Smurf before they join the fray. Though Gargamel attempts to break the Smurfs by killing Papa, Patrick saves him while Gutsy knocks the dragon wand out of the wizard's hand, but he drops it. Clumsy tries to catch it, and to Papa Smurf's surprise, is successful, and sends Gargamel flying into a trash can and being hit by a bus with the advertisement "Blue Moon" on it before Papa Smurf breaks it. Soon after, the Smurfs take their leave as Patrick receives a call from Odile that he still has his job because he finally gave her what she wants after she noticed the blue moon that Brainy created. Later, Patrick and Grace have a baby boy, whom they name Blue to honor the Smurfs, who rebuild their village in the style of New York.  In the aftermath, Gargamel wakes up and learns that he is still in the present and he looks at the audience before [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and asking them "What are you looking at?" and blasts them with his wand.

 On February 6, 1999, a team of three [[biologist]]s, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, investigate a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small [[New York (state)|New York]] town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings may have something to do with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered a hole in the ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a "snow shark", before it bites him.  Twelve years later, the snow shark has become a town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn Overman, is informed when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him having said to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the beast once more. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan argue about Ethan finding a job and they mention Ethan's mother's death. Ethan leaves to drink beer outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while [[Urination|urinating]]. The next day, with the rest of the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident.

With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron make their way into the woods, armed with a [[Crossbow|miniature crossbow]], a shotgun, and a [[Motion detector|motion-sensing camera]]. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.  When Lincoln finds that the camera has not detected any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman [[Involuntary euthanasia|shoots him in the head]] to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a [[hand grenade]] but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.

Darcy becomes infuriated and storms out of the apartment, telling Rachel that she hates her.  Two months later, Rachel and Darcy run into each other on the street.

The Son of No One
 In 2002, a young cop, Jonathan White, is a rookie officer under Captain Marion Mathers in a [[Queens]] neighborhood in [[New York City]], where he grew up. To provide for his wife Kerry and ailing young daughter, he works hard to keep his life on track, but this life is threatened when a dark secret bubbles to the surface. An anonymous source reveals new information about two unsolved murders from 1986, in the same neighborhood.<ref name="Ebert"></ref> In 1986, 14-year-old Jonathan killed two men in self-defense. His friends Vinnie and Vicky helped him dispose of the bodies and keep their involvement a secret from the authorities. The detective on the case, Stanford, knew Jonathan was involved, but disposed of the evidence out of loyalty to Jonathan's late father, who had been his partner.    In the present, Jonathan meets with Vinnie, who has descended into mental illness, for the first time in years. He has been getting anonymous phone calls and letters threatening to expose what he did 16 years before. He contacts Loren Bridges, the reporter who is trying to create a newspaper story out of the source material that has been leaked. He tries to convince her not to publish the story, but she refuses and leaves. Once she leaves the restaurant, she is followed and murdered by an unseen assailant. When Kerry demands to know what is going on, Jonathan admits to her that he was responsible for the killings.  The next morning, Jonathan learns of Loren's death before he receives a call from Captain Mathers, who informs him that Jonathan's partner is waiting for him outside. He is taken to Mathers and Stanford, who is now the city's police commissioner and plans to hand the job to Mathers after he retires. Mathers shows pictures taken of Jonathan and Loren in the restaurant before her death. Mathers and Stanford tell him that they had Loren killed to prevent her from publishing the story and making the department look bad; they then threaten to frame him for her murder unless he cooperates.   Jonathan heads home, but soon turns around and drives to Vinnie's apartment, knowing that Mathers and Stanford are going to kill him. He arrives to find the men about to murder Vinnie on the roof. Jonathan tries to intervene, but his partner holds him back, and Mathers shoots and wounds him. Mathers hands a gun to Vinnie and orders him to kill Jonathan, but Vinnie decides instead to shoot Mathers. Stanford then shoots Vinnie, who falls off of the roof. Stanford tells Jonathan to leave and forget about everything that happened. Jonathan reluctantly leaves and goes to find a dying Vinnie, who tells him that he never told anyone what happened.  Mathers' death and the two murders in 1986 are blamed on Vinnie, who is portrayed as a mentally unstable murderer in the media. Jonathan tries to carry on a normal life. The movie closes with an older Vicky sending a letter to Jonathan, explaining this will be her last letter—thus identifying herself as the person sending the letters to the newspaper.

In the machine he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an [[Alternate history|alternative timeline]].<ref group="lower-alpha"> Steven' neural pathways were compatible with a passenger on the train and as such he is able to retroactively access the target person's memory for some time after the their death as a way of gleaning information critical to the prevention of additional attacks. It is believed that these alternative timelines are not real and cease to exist after the subject's death; as such the events cannot be altered and are only to gain information.</ref>  Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times, he cannot locate or disarm the bomb in time and dies on the train. Later, Stevens learns that he has been with them for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan.  In real life he is comatose and is missing most of his body, he is on life support while hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is a projection of his brain as it attempts to make sense of a missing environment. Angry at learning that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission and Rutledge agrees.  Stevens finally catches the bomber, a man named Derek Frost.  Frost leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death and gets off at the last stop before Chicago. In their first encounter, Frost kills both Stevens and Christina and flees in a rented white van with a dirty bomb in it. Stevens remembers the license number and direction and reports it to Rutledge when he returns from the Source Code.  The authorities use the information to catch Frost, preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb. Rutledge reneges on his promise to let Stevens die and orders Goodwin to wipe Stevens' memory for a future mission. Stevens convinces Goodwin to allow him one more trip back to the train so that he can try to save everyone, despite Rutledge's insistence that events could not be altered.  Stevens is sent back into the Source Code where he asks Christina to go out for coffee with him.  He then leaves her and disarms the bomb, subdues Frost, and reports him to the authorities.  Stevens uses Frost's phone to send an email to Goodwin before calling his estranged father and reconciling with him under the guise of a fellow soldier. Stevens returns to Christina and starts to kiss her, at the same time Goodwin approaches the Source Code chamber and disconnects the life support.  Stevens dies, but in the new alternate timeline he finishes the kiss with Christina.  They continue on the train and then walk through downtown Chicago to the [[Cloud Gate]].  When the alternate-timeline Goodwin arrives for work at [[Nellis Air Force Base]] that morning, she receives the email from Stevens. The email includes a coded message verifying Steven's identity, and he informs Goodwin that they have changed history and that Source Code works.  He asks her to take care of the alternate-timeline version of him that is still in a coma.  
Soul Surfer (film)
  In 2003, teenager Bethany Hamilton lives in [[Kauai, Hawaii]] with her parents Tom and Cheri, and two brothers, Noah and Timmy. All are surfers, but she and her best friend [[Alana Blanchard]] have grown up with a passion for the sport and enter a competition. Her church youth ministry leader, Sarah Hill, is disappointed when she has to withdraw from a planned mission trip to Mexico because of the contest.  In the competition, Bethany and Alana place first and third, respectively. The following day, Tom goes to the hospital for knee surgery, and the girls go surfing with Alana's father Holt and brother Byron. As Bethany dangles her left arm in the water, a [[tiger shark]] is swimming just under her surfboard and notices her arm floating in the water. It unexpectedly attacks, ripping off her arm below the shoulder. Holt, Alana, and Byron get her out of the water where Holt makes a [[tourniquet]] out of his swimshirt to put on her while Byron calls 911 as Cheri is also informed. An ambulance meets them on the way to the hospital. Just before starting Tom's knee surgery, Dr. David Rovinsky is called to the emergency room to treat Bethany. Besides losing her left arm, she also lost 60% of her blood and Dr. Rovinsky calls her survival a miracle.  The onslaught of paparazzi also proves to be a great strain on her family and their privacy. The Hamiltons are grateful to Holt for his quick and active thinking and decisive action that saved her life. Her injury prevents her from participating in the Rip Curl photo shoots, but she wishes Alana well.  Bethany perseveres and after a recuperation period, gets back in the water, and learns to surf with one arm. ''[[Inside Edition]]'' offers to provide a prosthetic one that is cosmetically perfect and has bendable joints, in exchange for an interview. She angrily rejects it when she learns it will not help her surf as it is not weight bearing, as a result of the size of her arm stump.  Bethany eventually re-enters the competition, telling rival Malina not to go easy on her, and rejects a five-minute head start offered by the judges. She does not perform well because she cannot stay on the board long enough to go out and catch a competitive wave so Malina wins. Disappointed at this loss, she decides to give up competitive surfing and her friendship with Alana is strained following an argument.  Bethany decides to surprise Sarah by joining the youth group on another mission trip to help the people of [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], Thailand who were devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. Despite her recent tragedy, she joins her youth group to help the Thai children get over their fear of the ocean. They are understandably afraid of the water, including a little boy. She decides to go into it with a surfboard, hoping this will coax him into it. It works, and the realization that she can use her gift to inspire people motivates her to take up surfing again.  Tom, who believes that Bethany possesses a great surfer's instinct for sensing when the best waves will form, rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves, which is not prohibited by the competition's rules. Bethany trains for the competition while rekindling her friendship with Alana. She enters the national championship. During the competition, she performs respectably, though she is still chasing third place. Suddenly, with only minutes left on the clock, the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter, waiting for the waves to start back up. Tom's belief in his daughter's instinct is proven when she is the only one to sense a big wave forming, and she alone paddles out. When it forms, the others cannot get out in time and she catches it just as the horn sounds. If it is in time, she will win, but the judges rule that the time has expired. Malina is the winner, but she has finally gotten over her differences with Bethany, inviting her up on the platform to share first place.  Subsequently, Bethany lets the reporters interview her. One asks her what she would do if given the chance to undo the loss of her arm. She says that she would still lose it because she can embrace more people now than she ever could with both.  
The Sorcerer and the White Snake
 Abbott Fahai and his assistant Neng Ren head towards a blizzard through a magical door. An ice harpy appears at the top of the mountains and turns the impetuous Neng Ren into an ice statue. She then reveals her past and reasons to kill all men. Unable to persuade the ice harpy to turn over a new leaf, Fahai is forced to fight her. The battle ends with Fahai capturing the ice harpy using a demon trapper, which releases Neng Ren from ice. Neng Ren is then tasked to confine the ice harpy at Lei Feng Pagoda, and the master and assistant head back to the door which disappears after closing behind them. At the Pagoda, Neng Ren transfers the ice harpy from the demon trapper into the magic circle, which holds other trapped demons in it.  On the other side of the mountain, two female snake demons (Qingqing and Susu) are playing around, enjoying their time when they spot a physician, Xu Xian, picking herbs at the foot of the mountain with his friends. Qingqing, being a playful snake, scares him, causing him to fall into the lake below. Susu, being gentler, assumes human form and kisses Xu Xian which allows [[Qi|Vital Essence]] to flow from her into his body thus saving him. Soon, Xu Xian wakes up and tells his friends about being kissed by a beautiful girl, which only makes them laugh.  After finding a victim of a bat demon, Fahai and Neng Ren leave the temple immediately to subdue the bat demon to avoid more casualties. Xu Xian comes across them and offers a boat ride to the city. Susu starts thinking about the day she kissed Xu Xian and decides to head to the city to find him. Meanwhile, while Qingqing is exploring the city, she came across Neng Ren and decided to help him subdue the bat demon by revealing its location. Neng Ren defeats the bat demon's cohorts, but is unable to subdue the bat demon king who bites him. Though he is subsequently saved by Fahai, Neng Ren starts turning into a bat demon himself the next day and decides to run away.  In the meanwhile, after a series of pranks, Xu Xian recognizes Susu and they spend the night together, which is rather unfortunate for Xu Xian because he does not know that he was making love to a snake in a human form.  Neng Ren is found by Qinqing and the two befriend each other. They realize that Neng Ren, despite becoming a bat demon, still has all his human taste for human food, and most of his human qualities. Meanwhile, Xu Xian and Susu wed. Shortly after Fahai saw that Xu Xian's medicines has mysterious substance after that, he gives Xu Xian a dagger that can kill demons. Susu is then chased by Fahai, who tells her to leave Xu Xian and sparing her. When she doesn't, Fahai and his disciples invade her and Xu Xian's cottage. Susu fights the battle in her snake form, but is stabbed by Xu Xian unaware of her true identity. Susu escapes but is gravely injured. Xu Xian, after realizing what he has done, decides to get the spirit root to heal her.  Helped by Susu's friend, a mouse, Xu Xian manages to retrieve a root kept inside the Lei Feng Pagoda that could save Susu, but is possessed by demons since the root was the thing that kept the demons in place. Fahai and the other monks capture Xu Xian and prepare to cast spells to banish the demons from his body. Susu recovers and she goes to find Xu Xian along with Qinqing. They are confronted by Fahai, who tries to explain to them that the spell should not be broken before it is complete. Susu, however, does not believe him and accuses him of trying to separate them so the two sisters start battling Fahai. Susu and Qingqin decide to flood the temple since Fahai won't let go of Xu Xian. After countless wounds Fahai lies back exhausted. As he looks around he sees Neng Ren helping to save his former colleagues, the monks of the temple who were trying to complete the spell to release Xu Xian from the demons. He looks up at the sky and questions whether he was right to have been a demon hunter all his life.  Susu releases Xu Xian from the spell after which Xu Xian does not have any memory of Susu. Susu blames this on Fahai, after which they have one last battle. Fahai manages to trap Susu in the temple of Lei Feng Pagoda. At this point, Susu repents and asks to see Xu Xian just one last time, as she could accepted any punishments as long as she could see him for the last time. Simultaneously, Fahai gets the answer to his question and understands what he must do. Filled with the divine spirit, he lifts up the pagoda to allow Susu's last wish to come true.  After a brief reunion with Xu Xian, she tells him of her story of having meditated for a thousand years before she met him. She tells him that it was all worth less than a moment with him, that even he doesn't remember her, her memory of love with him is enough, and that even if she has to die or live with pain, she won't regret how much she has to suffer to see him one last time. She kisses him, causing him to remember everything. As the pair go to kiss one last time Susu is sucked back into the temple, leaving Xu Xian chasing her as both cry and reach out for each other.  Qingqing, watching all this from a distance with Neng Ren, tells him that she doesn't want to love anyone as her sister loved Xu Xian, and leaves saying that he will never be a true bat demon anyway.  After this, we see Xu Xian picking herbs around the temple and inside Susu has returned to her true form as a white snake trapped inside the temple. Fahai is seen walking the mountainside when suddenly Neng Ren (now a complete bat demon) appears alongside him. Throwing him an apple to eat Fahai tells him that he has grown used to his new look, and they continue on the journey together again.

Sound of My Voice
 In [[Los Angeles]], substitute schoolteacher Peter and aspiring writer Lorna are a couple in their twenties making a film documentary. Their subject is a secretive cult led by the mysterious Maggie (Brit Marling), whom they plan to expose as a fraud.  When the cult considers Peter and Lorna ready to meet Maggie, they are made to shower thoroughly and dress in white surgical gowns. Then they are driven blindfolded to a secret basement location and received by Klaus, with whom they exchange a distinctive, intricate handshake, which they have been practicing. Peter and Lorna then join eight other members and meet Maggie, who uses an oxygen tank and implies that the showering and clothing requirements are to avoid aggravating her illness.  Maggie claims to be a time-traveler from the year 2054. She describes the future as riddled with war, famine and struggle, and has come back to select a special band of chosen people to prepare for what lies ahead. She leads the group in a series of intense psychological exercises and tells them about herself and the future, never proving nor disproving her extraordinary claim. Maggie's charismatic manner is powerful, and both Lorna and Peter have moments in which they waver between skepticism and belief. Lorna is especially concerned when she notices that Peter, who was initially adamant that Maggie was a charlatan, seems to now be intrigued by and even attracted to Maggie.  After several group meetings, Maggie instructs Peter to bring her the eccentric eight-year-old Abigail Pritchett, one of his students. Maggie insists Abigail is her mother, and that Peter and Lorna will be banned from the group if he fails to comply. When Peter admits that he is considering following Maggie's orders, Lorna is outraged and accuses him of falling for Maggie's deception. After they argue, Lorna is privately approached by Carol, a woman who identifies herself as a Justice Department agent. Carol tells Lorna that Maggie is wanted for a variety of felonies. Lorna agrees to set Maggie up to be captured and to hide this plan from Peter.  With Lorna's help Peter arranges for Maggie to meet the student in public, at the [[LaBrea Tar Pits]], during a class field trip. When Maggie meets the little girl, Peter is amazed to see them wordlessly perform the cult's intricate handshake. Abigail asks Maggie how she knew her secret handshake, and Maggie reverently responds: "You taught it to me." Men in police uniforms burst into the room and seize Maggie. As cult members angrily accuse Peter of betraying Maggie, he exchanges a glance with Lorna who smiles slightly, affirming her role in Maggie's capture. Abigail then asks Peter who Maggie was, and he responds, stricken, that he does not know.  
Soundtrack (film)
 Raunak Kaul ([[Rajeev Khandelwal]]) lives, eats and breathes music. Music is his life. Having inherited the talent and passion for music from his deceased father Parth Kaul, he wants to make sure that he doesn’t inherit one thing from his father – failure. So when he arrives in the City of Dreams, Mumbai, to make it big in the music field he pushes himself – and more – to make his dream come true. Starting as a DJ in his uncle Surendra's ([[Yatin Karyekar]]) night club Tango Charlie, owned by Charlie ([[Mohan Kapoor]]), he soon finds himself expanding his avenues to establishing his own studio, making his own music and finally composing the same for a movie by Anurag Kashyap. But along with virtues come vices, as Raunak finds himself falling deeper into the world of alcohol, smoking and drugs as he gets into a relationship with Shonali ([[Mrinalini Sharma]]).  Raunak's loss of hearing is first apparent when he hears a high-pitched ringing sound instead of his interview on TV. At this time, Raunak is making his next album with his mates Banjo (Ankur Tewari) and Biscuit (Siddharth Coutto). Raunak continues working on his album and playing gigs at clubs, but his hearing degrades rapidly. As a result, progress on his album stagnates. However, Raunak refuses to acknowledge his problem until a gig in the club, when he cannot hear the second channel in his headphones and must crossfade one song into the next without being able to beatmatch them. The result sounds terrible, and the crowd boos him. Overcome with fear and frustration, he throws the turntable and the [[mixing console|mixer]] onto the dance floor, and is forcibly removed from the club.   The next day, Charlie confronts Raunak about the performance. Raunak agrees to see a doctor ([[Manu Rishi]]), who tells him he's lost hearing in one ear and has 30% left in the other. He warns Raunak that unless he stops abusing drugs and listening to loud noises, he will soon be completely deaf. Even the use of his hearing aid would only further degrade his hearing.  Then, during a recording session, Raunak confesses the full nature of his hearing loss to Banjo. He inserts his hearing aid to demonstrate, and, overwhelmed by the sudden sound exposure, leans close to one of the monitor speakers. Before he can react, however, a frustrated Biscuit smashes a guitar into an amplifier whose volume is maximized. The noise is excruciating, and the feedback knocks Raunak unconscious. The damage leaves him permanently deaf.   Without his hearing, Raunak cannot complete his album. He loses his recording contract, and Charlie abandons him. Soon after, Shonali leaves him. The talking head sequences describe this period as his darkest hour, in which he shuts himself in a room, which he has "soundproofed" with pillows in a desperate bid to recover his hearing. His drug use intensifies, and he appears to be heavily depressed. In one scene, he repeatedly throws his body against the walls. In other, he wraps [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]]s around his head, either an attempt at suicide or a drastic way to recover his hearing, but dives into the pool before they ignite.  In a culmination moment of the movie, Raunak flushes all his drugs down a toilet, only to be faced with the vision of the menacing badger again. The two begin to scuffle. Raunak then grabs the dying badger's head, and removes it, only to reveal that the badger is, in fact, himself.  After this dark period, Raunak meets Gauri ([[Soha Ali Khan]]), an instructor for the deaf who coaches him in lip-reading. They become close, and eventually intimate. He confides his unhappiness at losing music, and she helps him perceive sound through visual and tactile methods instead.  Raunak then manages to devise a system for mixing songs, in which he watches [[Oscilloscope|an oscilloscope trace]] while resting his feet on the pulsating speakers. Using this system, he heads to the studio and manages to produce new mix CD (Raunak Is "Hear") entirely by himself. He delivers it to Charlie, who is wildly pleased – particularly by the potential of using Raunak's disability to increase record sales. He has Raunak take part in advertising and promotional deals which are increasingly offensive and insensitive to deaf people, which Gauri silently disapproves of. He also treats Gauri like he did Shonali; as Raunak's sexual object, not recognizing her substantial role in Raunak's life. In general, Charlie tends to patronizingly characterize the deaf as pained, helpless victims desperate for a deaf role model.   Charlie convinces Raunak to play live as a career comeback. He thinks it is an opportunity for Raunak to prove himself to others, despite Raunak's insistence that he has nothing to prove to his critics. The gig goes exceedingly well, and many claim it showcases even greater talent than his early work. After the show, Raunak and Gauri disappear from Charlie, the media, and the music scene altogether. In a talking heads sequence, characters speculate on where he is now (if alive).   As the film ends, we see Raunak teaching a group of deaf children how to perceive sound like he does. Additionally, we see Raunak who is then met by Gauri and a child (presumably their own). They affectionately walk together down a street unrecognized  
Song of Tomorrow (2010 film)
 The film is set in [[Karlstad]]. Frizzy-haired Janos (Sven-Olof Molin) is already mid-aged but has no jobs and no aspirations. He sings ballads on the street with a guitar and picks the garbage for food, yet he is content with his carefree life. He sometimes helps out old man Stig Manner (Rolf G. Ekroth) who walks with a cane to sell used goods. Obviously unsatisfied with Janos' lack of achievements, Stig tries hard to launch a musical career for him. He calls himself Janos' manager and takes Janos to different places for performing and recording opportunities, but Janos is completely disinterested which frustrates him. Around this time, Stig receives a voice mail from his estranged daughter Catrin (Helena Bengtsson), who has arrived in town from [[Stockholm]] with her infant son. Stig is afraid to meet his daughter, but sends her a CD with Janos' recordings. He has a stroke and becomes wheelchair-bound. Janos discovers Stig has a daughter who only wants to meet Stig to introduce him to her son. He puts Stig on a train to Stockholm and calls Catrin.  
Spy Kids: All the Time in the World
  OSS agent Marissa Wilson ([[Jessica Alba]]) is attempting to capture a criminal named Tick Tock ([[Jeremy Piven]]), who purchases a mini-disk stolen from OSS. Despite being nine months pregnant, she continues her pursuit against the admonitions of her boss Danger D'Amo (also played by Piven). Tick Tock is captured and the mini-disk, which contains information on a weapon of mass destruction called Project: Armageddon, is retrieved.  At the hospital, Marissa meets her spy-hunting TV host husband, Wilbur ([[Joel McHale]]), who thinks she is an interior decorator, and her two stepchildren by him, twins Rebecca ([[Rowan Blanchard]]) and Cecil ([[Mason Cook]]). Marissa gives birth to a daughter, Maria. Rebecca does not accept Marissa as a replacement for her deceased mother, and delights in playing pranks on her. Attempting to strengthen her rapport with Rebecca, Marissa gives her a red-sapphire necklace that she says her own parents gave her when she was Rebecca's age.  The media reports that time is speeding up at an increasing rate. A criminal mastermind called the Time Keeper (also played by Piven) claims responsibility, saying that he will unleash Project: Armageddon as punishment upon a society that he believes wastes time with meaningless pursuits instead of treasuring time with the loved ones. The Time Keeper demands that Tick Tock will bring him the Chronos Sapphire, which is revealed to be the jewel in the necklace Marissa gave to Rebecca. The OSS calls Marissa out of retirement, and instructs her to bring the Chronos Sapphire with her. When Marissa asks for it from Rebecca, it further strains their relationship.  When Marissa arrives at OSS headquarters, she discovers that the box Rebecca gave her did not contain the jewel, but it contained baby food.  Tick Tock's henchmen break into Marissa's house, and Rebecca and Cecil are directed to take refuge in a Panic Room, where they view a video of Marissa informing them of her secret career. The twins escape and go to OSS headquarters, where Marissa's niece and their step-cousin, Carmen Cortez ([[Alexa Vega]]), gives the twins a tour of the defunct Spy Kids Division.  As Marissa pursues Tick Tock, Rebecca and Cecil go after the Time Keeper. Their search leads them to a clock shop, which is Tick Tock's headquarters. The twins view a video of the Wells Experiment, which reveals the nature of the Chronos Sapphire in Rebecca's necklace. The twins are captured by Tick Tock, but are rescued by Marissa and Carmen, though Tick Tock manages to steal the Sapphire. Wilbur's investigations lead him to the clock shop, but he is shocked to learn that Marissa is a spy. When he destroys the footage that he and his cameraman filmed of the battle, he is fired, and becomes estranged from Marissa and the children.  As time continues to speed up, OSS agents are debriefed on the Wells Experiment. The OSS shut down the experiment, and placed the device under lockdown. Among the agents assigned to the case is Carmen's estranged brother, Juni Cortez ([[Daryl Sabara]]). The twins confront Danger over the fact that his watch is similar to the one worn by the Time Keeper, and his name is an anagram of "Armageddon." He reveals that he is the Time Keeper and imprisons them. When a group of OSS agents led by Marissa, Carmen, and Juni return to the clock shop to confront the Time Keeper, he freezes the agents in time using circuity in their ID badges, and does the same to 18 major cities. Juni, whose badge was thrown away by Carmen, manages to free Marissa and Carmen.  Danger reveals that his father was head of the Wells Experiment, and he was the boy frozen in time. His father spent the rest of his life trying unsuccessfully to set him free. The OSS managed to shut down the experiment with the Chronos Sapphire. Now Danger plans to use the Armageddon Device in go back in time to spend more time with his father. Cecil deduces that Danger has already tried this before multiple times, but he comes back worse each time and points out that Tick Tock and his minions are all versions of himself. Rebecca tells Danger that he should use what time he has wisely instead of trying to acquire more of it. When the time vortex opens, Danger finally meets his father, then he returns as an elderly form of himself and realizes that Cecil was right as he could not change anything. He shuts down the device, and Tick Tock is apprehended by Wilbur, who is reunited with Marissa and the children. Carmen and Juni announce they will co-lead a revived Spy Kids program, while Rebecca and Cecil become recruiters of new agents, [[fourth wall|including the kids watching the movie]].  
Spork (film)
 A 14-year-old girl nicknamed "Spork" is unpopular, mistreated by her classmates, and very soft-spoken. Her next-door neighbor and best friend, known as "Tootsie Roll", is planning on entering the school Dance-Off to win $236 which she would use to visit her father in prison. During a hair-product-related dancing accident, Tootsie Roll injures her ankle and can no longer compete in the competition. Spork rises to the occasion and surprises the whole school by signing up for the Dance-Off.   Spork and Tootsie Roll listen to [[hip-hop]] songs from the early 1990s and wear 1990s fashion, yet the antagonist, Betsy Byotch, and her friends wear 1980s garb and listen to 80s music (though they are also fans of [[Britney Spears]]). The character of Charlie is obsessed with [[Justin Timberlake]], whose career began in the mid–1990's. There is also a mention by "Betsy Byotch" that there are pictures from a few years ago of "Loosie Goosie" circa 1998.  It is mentioned throughout the film that Spork and Charlie are obsessed with ''The Wizard of Oz'', though Spork's love is for the 1978 film, ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'', and Charlie's is for the 1939 ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  
Spooky Buddies
 In 1937 Sheriff Jim and others from the town of Fernfield set off to the manor of Warwick the Warlock. Warwick has kidnapped five puppies so he can sacrifice them to the Halloween Hound, an evil hellhound who can open a portal to ghosts but only if he has the souls of five puppies of the same blood. One of the puppies, Pip, belongs to a young boy named Joseph. As the mob prepares to storm the manor, the hound devours Pip's siblings, but Pip escapes. Warwick chases him and grabs him just as the mob enters. The Warlock manages to escape just as dawn approaches.

Stanley Ka Dabba
  Stanley ([[Partho Gupte]]) is a fourth grader at Holy Family school in [[Mumbai]] and is very popular among his friends. He is talented and well liked by his peers. The English teacher, Ms. Rosy, ([[Divya Dutta]]) is particularly impressed with his creativity, wit, and humour.  Stanley is shown with a bruised face in the opening scene of the movie. On being questioned about it by Ms. Rosy, he concocts an elaborate story, much to her amusement. His humorous essays and offhand poem recitations make him her favourite in class. However his imagination is not always rewarded; his science teacher ([[Divya Jagdale]]) rebukes his attempt at constructing a light house as part of the class project since it does not adhere to the topics covered in class.  It is shown early on that he doesn't bring his lunch box or '[[Tiffin carrier|dabba]]' to school, unlike all his other classmates. Verma ([[Amole Gupte]]), is a ravenous Hindi teacher; a phagomaniac who does not bring his own dabba either but lusts after everyone else's, also stealing food on occasion. The kids at school nickname him as 'Khadoos' (cantankerous person). He has a poor reputation among his peers for his mindless and inconsiderate gluttony. He particularly eyes the dabba of one of Stanley's friends and shamelessly joins the group in class as soon as the lunch bell goes off to gorge on their food. A lot of his class time is spent discussing what his students brought for lunch.  One day, he ends up coming late during lunch-break and misses out on eating what he had earlier hoped to eat from the children's dabbas. Upon realising that the food in question was shared with Stanley, Khadoos berates him for not getting his own dabba. Stanley senses Khadoos' hostility towards him and avoids eating from his friends' dabbas thereafter, telling them every day during lunch break that he is going home to enjoy a hot meal prepared by his mother. His friends catch his bluff soon after when they find him loitering around the school during lunch break. When confronted, Stanley tells them that there is no one to cook for him until his parents get back from Delhi. Eager to help their hungry friend out, Stanley's friends start hiding from Khadoos during lunch break while sharing their dabbas with Stanley. Chagrined, Khadoos starts hunting for them arduously during lunch break every day. He catches hold of them eventually on the terrace, empty dabbas in tow. Upon realising that the group shared their lunches with Stanley again, he menacingly threatens Stanley to either bring his own dabba or stop coming to school. Stanley obliges and stops coming to school.  In this time, Stanley's friends come to know of an inter-school concert that they think he would be a perfect fit for. However, since he is debarred from school by Khadoos, Stanley remains sceptical about his chances. He secretly starts attending practice sessions for the concert and begins learning the dance steps and song lyrics by himself. Soon after, he is spotted practising by one of the organizers of the concert. His talent is recognised and he is immediately included in the troupe. In the mean time, Stanley's absence is felt by his teachers and friends, who finally spill the beans to Ms. Rosy about the reason behind his nonattendance. Aghast and disgusted, Ms. Rosy confronts Khadoos in front of other staff members asking him to "have some shame" since Stanley "is just a child". Khadoos begins realising his folly.  One fine day, Stanley brings his own dabba to school. He offers it to Khadoos on a platter and asks him for permission to come back to school. Guilt-ridden and shame-faced, Khadoos quits. He apologises to Stanley in a handwritten letter and promises to never return.  Meanwhile, the inter-school concert is attended by the entire staff of Holy Family, all of whom appreciate Stanley's performance. Ms. Rosy congratulates Stanley after the concert and offers him a ride home. However, he refuses saying that his mother is waiting for him in her car. The school's Principal ([[Rahul Singh (actor)|Rahul Singh]]) later drops Stanley home, which we realise isn't "home" but the restaurant at which he works. An orphan, Stanley is frequently physically abused by the proprietor of the restaurant, (his own uncle – [[Shashank Shende]]), leaving him badly bruised. He hits Stanley in the face for remaining absent from work for the majority of the day. A cook at the restaurant, Akram, empathises with Stanley and promises to pack leftovers at the restaurant into his 'dabba' every day, without his uncle's knowledge. Stanley and Akram stay back and clean the place up for the night. The scene ends with Stanley lighting a candle next to a photograph of his parents, before going to bed. His mother is seen to bear some resemblance to Ms. Rosy. The next day onward, Stanley brings his own dabba to school and shares it with everyone while regaling them with details about how his mother prepared everything.

The Squad (2011 film)
 A team of anti-guerilla commandos led by an experienced sergeant and commanded by a [[wikt:greenhorn|green]] lieutenant are sent to secure the approach to a mountain base amid towering radio masts. When they are in position they are told to wait for their backup which has been delayed by enemy action en route. One of the soldiers, Arango, is impatient to get into the base and after arguing with the lieutenant, makes a dash up the stairs to the base. The radio operator, Parra, tries to stop him, but steps on a mine which shatters his leg and destroys the primary radio. The sergeant insists they must now enter the base to use the medical facilities in order to save the critically injured Parra.  Inside the base the squad finds only a few bodies but bloodstains and destroyed rooms everywhere. The base radios have been destroyed, and the squad personal radios are only short range, so they cannot contact their backup. The sergeant discovers that the base supplies are untouched, indicating that this was not a guerrilla raid.  Exploring the base, their local guide (Fiquitiva, nicknamed "Indian") discovers a room filled with [[Fetishism|fetishes]] and prayers scrawled on the walls. He calls the others, but is mocked for his superstition. Later, he returns and discovers that the wall of the room has been recently built and something is trapped behind it. The lieutenant order the wall broken down, and they find, trapped inside, a bound woman who cannot, or will not, talk to them. Arango, whose brother was stationed on the base, tries to question her but gets nowhere. The sergeant begins beating her but is stopped by the lieutenant. The lieutenant calls for the medic and puts one of the other soldiers, Ponce, on guard with orders that no-one is to see the prisoner without permission. Ponce starts to offer the woman some food, but is dragged away by the medic, who accuses Ponce of being "just like the rest" and that he is disgusted by them all.  The squad corporal, Cortez, discovers a bundle of papers under a body and begins to read them as night falls. Ponce, guarding the prisoner, is bullied into leaving by the sergeant, who then enters the room with the prisoner. Reading the papers Cortez discovers that the woman was picked up on suspicion of being a guerilla spy and interrogated, but refused to talk. At the same time she was taken prisoner, one of the base soldiers became ill and insisted the woman had placed a curse upon him. The base soldiers became increasingly convinced the woman was a witch and eventually rioted, attempting to cut out her tongue. The log ends without explaining what happens next, only that "the captain had completely lost control of the men", at least one of whom had killed another soldier, and the final scrawled words in the log insist that they "must kill the witch".  Ponce has a flashback dream to hazy memories of an event before the start of the mission, but is suddenly awoken by shouting from his radio to return to the guard post. Inside, they discover that the sergeant has been killed and the woman has escaped. They spread out looking for her and "Indian" falls down a gully, landing in a mass grave of base soldiers. Indian confronts the lieutenant, accusing him of bringing doom on them all by releasing the "witch". An argument between Arango and Parra's best friend is interrupted when the perimeter noisemakers are tripped at one of the lookout points. The mist means that they cannot see anything, but corporal Cortez defies the lieutenant to lead the men out to attempt to kill the "guerrilla bitch".  Out in the mist, the men begin shooting at fast moving shapes that whip past them, but only succeed in shooting Arango in the crossfire, killing him. The lieutenant, furious at Arango's death and the squad for disobeying his orders, attempts to relieve Parra's friend of his weapon, but is stopped by the corporal, who accuses him of knowing about the witch from the logbook all along. The lieutenant denies knowing anything and arguing that it is Cortez's fault for leading the men out into the mist, but the men side with the corporal and tie up the lieutenant in the radio room.  Indian, who has been furiously scratching since falling in the pit, goes to the medic and demands treatment because he has caught "the plague" from the dead bodies. The medic throws him out, distraught because Parra has gangrene and is dying. Ponce tries to talk to Cortez insisting the situation has gone well beyond their control, but the corporal insists he will get all of them out safe. Indian steals gasoline from the base generator to burn the corpse pit, then strips off his clothes. Disgusted, the corporal kicks him back toward the pit then locks him out of the base.  In a last effort to save his life, the remaining team try to amputate Parra's leg, but he dies shortly after the operation. Angry, and with no reason to remain with his patient, the medic prepares to leave. The corporal refuses to let him, as whoever killed the sergeant is still out there. In a rage, the medic reveals that he killed the sergeant rather than let him rape and murder another woman, referencing the events from Ponce's flashback. In retaliation, Cortez beats the medic to death in front of the horrified Ponce. A scream from outside prompts Ponce and Parra's friend to try and rescue Indian, but Indian is trying to cut off his "contaminated" skin and stabs Parra's friend to death when found (Indian is not seen again after this). Ponce tries to persuade Cortez to leave, but the corporal is now totally insane and Ponce is forced to kill him in self-defense.  Ponce climbs slowly down the mountain, suffering flashbacks to the events before the mission - the massacre of an entire village of guerrilla sympathisers. He arrives at the point where the film started in a disconnected daze, when the "witch" appears behind him and screams.

During their journey, the trio encounter a bloodied and hysterical [[Taliban]] fighter who Cooper shoots, discovering afterward that the man's firearm was damaged and empty.  The soldiers later stumble onto five more Taliban, all dead, and with their heavily mutilated remains showing signs of [[dismemberment]] and organ removal. A rattling noise then permeates the area, prompting a hidden quartet of camouflaged men armed with crude [[melee weapon]]s to start advancing on the NATO personnel. The men do not respond to Corporal Twiggs's attempts to communicate with them, and are unaffected by being shot, even in the legs and head.

One Sunday after church, Heddon attacks Jeremy for talking to Janice, and Amy comes to his defence, but David warns her to not get involved.   Later that night back at home, David discovers their cat strangled and hung up in the bedroom closet.

They all drive to David and Amy's house, and demand the couple hand Jeremy over, but David refuses. The Sheriff then arrives but Heddon shoots him dead; then the men attempt to enter the house. David and Amy barricade the doors shut and take Jeremy upstairs to the bedroom and prepare to fight off the men.  When Chris attempts to enter through a window, David nails his hands to the wall with a nail gun, his throat fatally exposed to broken glass. When Heddon tries to follow, David burns his face with hot oil. Heddon and Charlie ram down one of the house's walls with Charlie's pick-up truck, but Charlie is knocked unconscious. David fights Heddon off and causes him to shoot himself in the foot. David then shoots Heddon and beats Bic to death with a fireplace poker.   Upstairs, Amy and Jeremy are attacked by Norman, who has climbed in through the window. Norman is attempting to rape Amy again when David and Charlie appear. Charlie and Norman draw on each other when Norman threatens to kill Amy. Amy shoots Norman, Charlie assaults and disarms her, then David jumps him. Charlie kicks David down the stairs and beats him up severely. While David lies prostrate on the floor, disarmed, Charlie prepares to shoot him in his head when Amy approaches from behind, pointing the gun at him. Turning to her, Charlie informs her the gun is empty, and says to her "I will always protect you, baby", when David rises behind him and slams a bear trap down on his head, which shuts and ensnares him. Charlie slowly dies.  As sirens are heard, with the adjacent barn in flames, David says "I got 'em all".

Sucker Punch (2011 film)
  In the 1960s,<ref name="prodnotes"></ref> a young woman<ref name="prodnotes"/> nicknamed Babydoll ([[Emily Browning]]) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional [[Brattleboro Retreat#In popular culture|Lennox House]] for the Mentally Insane in [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]], [[Vermont]], after she is blamed for her younger sister's death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski ([[Carla Gugino]]), to have Babydoll [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]] so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape.  Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are [[Sexual slavery|sex slaves]]. In this realm, she befriends four other dancers&nbsp;&ndash; Amber ([[Jamie Chung]]), Blondie ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]), Rocket ([[Jena Malone]]), and Rocket's sister and "star of the show", Sweet Pea ([[Abbie Cornish]]). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller ([[Jon Hamm]]), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in [[feudal Japan]], meeting the Wise Man ([[Scott Glenn]]). After she expresses her desire to "escape", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require "a deep sacrifice" but bring a "perfect victory". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers.  Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines fantastic adventures that mirror the escape efforts. These adventures include infiltrating a bunker protected by [[steampunk]]-inspired [[World War I]] German soldiers to gain a map (mirrored by Sweet Pea copying a map of the brothel/institution from Blue's office); storming an [[Orc]]-infested castle to retrieve two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (mirrored by Amber stealing a lighter from the mayor's pocket); and boarding a train and fighting robotic guards to disarm a bomb (mirrored by Sweet Pea stealing a kitchen knife from the Cook's belt). During the last fantasy, Rocket sacrifices herself to save Sweet Pea and is killed when the bomb detonates, which is paralleled by the Cook fatally stabbing Rocket while she tries to protect her sister.  Blue overhears Blondie relaying Babydoll's plan to Gorski, confirming his suspicions that something is amiss. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Pea's story. Despite Sweet Pea's protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.  Back in the asylum, the surgeon has just performed Babydoll's lobotomy. Gorski notes earlier that the girl, during her short stay, stabbed an orderly, started a fire, and helped another girl escape the asylum. The surgeon is baffled by Babydoll's expression, and asks Gorski why she authorized the procedure. Gorski realizes that Blue has forged her signature and summons the police, who apprehend Blue as he attempts to sexually assault a lobotomized Babydoll. While being led away, Blue also incriminates the stepfather. Babydoll is shown smiling serenely, having apparently found freedom within her own inner "Paradise".  At a bus station, Sweet Pea is stopped by police as she tries to get on a bus to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], but she is rescued by the bus driver (the Wise Man), who misleads the police and allows her to board. Sweet Pea thanks the Driver, who tells her they have "a very long way to go". During the end credits, Dr. Gorski and Blue perform "[[Love Is the Drug]]" in a glitzy musical sequence that includes all five female leads.  ;Deleted extended ending In a deleted scene, Sweet Pea is shown stealing clothes from a nearby farm. Babydoll, meanwhile, wakes up after being knocked out by the guard in High Roller's residence. The High Roller explains that he and Babydoll are supposed to "screw", but that he has no intention of simply taking her. Instead, he is looking for a moment of truth in a fake world, which can only be provided by someone who is not a faker, which is why he needs Babydoll - he says he wants to see in her eyes a simple truth: that she would give herself to him willingly, not because she has to, but because she wants to. At first, Babydoll seems reluctant as the High Roller becomes more intimate, but soon starts warming up to him. The High Roller explains that in exchange for this one moment of truth, he will give her absolute freedom, as an abstract ideal. Babydoll willingly pulls him close to her, and they kiss. At this moment, Babydoll's fantasy ends, and she is thrust back into the real world just as the surgeon's needle enters her eye.

Suicide Room
  The movie begins in a theatre, where Dominik Santorski and his parents listen to [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s ''[[lied]]'' "[[Der Doppelgänger]]", which provides a key to the interpretation of the whole film. His parents have success-driven careers and are out of touch with their son's life. Dominik is popular at his private school, but is also spoiled by the perks given to him by his wealthy parents. While at school, his friends stumble upon a self-harm video while using his computer. Later, he watches the rest of the self-harm video and leaves a comment for the poster.  While drinking at an after-prom party, a girl admits to lesbian experimentation. Aleksander, another popular student who Dominik appears to have a crush on, dares the girl to kiss her friend. She agrees, as long as Aleksander agrees to kiss Dominik, which they do. A video of the kiss is posted to a social media site, and Dominik's friends appear to find it cool and daring. Later, at judo practice, Dominik and Aleksander are sparring, and Dominik becomes pinned beneath his friend. During the struggle that follows, Dominik is excited to the point of [[ejaculation]]. This event is relayed to a social media site, and people begin to make fun of Dominik online.  From his previous comment to the self-harm video, he is invited to join a 3D social network. He meets Sylwia (Sylvia), a suicidal girl who cuts herself and wears a mask, in the chat group "Sala Samobójców" (The Suicide Room). In The Suicide Room, the group members watch films of people killing themselves. Sylwia and Dominik develop a bond, and Dominik begins skipping school to spend more time with her through the online world.  Dominik and his family attend another opera, where they try to pair him with another family's daughter. Dominik acts out by insisting that he's gay and making out with one of the male busts in the lobby. His parents, embarrassed by Dominik's outburst, are angry with him and force him to go back to school. He returns home and sees a posted video showing shadow puppets (named after Dominik and Aleksander) engaging in various homosexual acts. The video drives Dominik to tears and causes him to rampage through his room.  Sylwia mocks him for being upset; she says that he is different from others and encourages him to scare the normal people. Dominik changes his style, adopting the hair styles and clothing of alternative subculture, and takes his father's gun to school. When Aleksander approaches him with some friends after school, Dominik begins to take out his gun, but runs away to his taxi. When recounting the incident to Sylwia, he claims that he had scared his friend and was in total control of the situation. They return to The Suicide Room and Dominik finds out that Sylwia is a shut-in and has not left her room in 3 years. Dominik stays locked in his room for 10 days talking with her, and refuses to eat. These events go unnoticed by his parents, who often spend days out of the house on business and engage in extramarital sexual affairs. Eventually, their housekeeper calls the police, who break in Dominik's bedroom door and find him sitting in a pool of his blood beside a broken mirror. He is sent to a hospital and kept in a psychiatric ward for 3 days. His parents arrive to take him home, claiming that there is nothing wrong with him, and he should not be wasting time at the hospital when he should be studying for his final exams. His parents also fired the maid that called for the ambulance.   When Dominik returns home and goes back to The Suicide Room, he hears the group discussing their plans for suicide, but they refuse to discuss it with him. Upon hearing that his parents are trying to get him to speak with a psychiatrist, Sylwia opens up to him. She tells him a love story that ends with the lovers killing themselves with pills and alcohol. After telling Dominik that this is how she wants to die, she begs him to get pills for her from the doctor.  At the behest of the psychiatrist, Dominik's parents write him a letter. He reads it to Sylwia, who finds it hilarious, before ripping the letter up. His parents decide that the doctor's methods will not cure Dominik before his final exams, so they demand the name of one that will simply give him drugs. When the new doctor arrives and interviews Dominik, Sylwia feeds him answers that will lead the doctor to give him the right pills. He follows the lines Sylwia gives him, but continually remarks about how no one should want to die, in a plea to make her reconsider her suicide.  As Dominik and Sylwia discuss where to meet and transfer the pills, Dominik's father rips out the router before their plans are set. Dominik panics, bouncing from threatening to kill his parents to begging his "Mummy" to help her son. His mother attempts to plug the cords back in, but his father stops her physically. Dominik bursts from his room and collapses. Later, he explains to his parents what The Suicide Room is. He tells them that the members are "like a family", and his parents ban him from returning, even to explain that he cannot come back.  Still wanting to see Sylwia, he takes the pills to the bar they had discussed in hopes she would show up anyway. The bartender forces him to order something, which leads to Dominik drinking a large beer. He heads to the toilets and decides to dump the pills. After throwing a few handfuls into the toilet, Dominik takes one of the pills followed by two more handfuls. Dominik finds a couple who are kissing, and he starts filming them. They take the camera and begin filming Dominik's delirium. He mocks his parents and himself, laughing at his own drunken imitations. He returns to the bar and sees Sylwia waiting for him. They walk to the middle of the dance floor and kiss passionately. For the first time in the film, Dominik is happy.  Later at The Suicide Room, Sylwia is talking to her followers discussing Dominik's long absence from the group. They see Dominik's avatar walk up and learn that it is his mother using his account. She thanks them for being there and supporting her son, and announces that he has died. (The encounter at the bar is most likely a hallucination.) Sylwia rips the internet cord out from the wall and stumbles through her room, knocking over piles of garbage. She opens her door and goes outside for the first time in three years, bawling and screaming in the grass out front.  The movie ends with Dominik's parents at a ballet, though looking older and sitting in different places with separate companions, implying they are divorced. The drunk couple's footage of Dominik is interspersed with the ballet. It is revealed that, Dominik never left the bathroom after taking the pills. Instead, Dominik was filmed by the drunk couple as he gagged over a toilet and screamed "Mama" as he died from overdosing. He sticks his fingers down his throat in an attempt to throw up the pills but it is already too late. The video ends up posted online on The Suicide Room wall.  
Sudhamoy Babur Advut Galpo
 Sudhamoy, the [[protagonist]] in the film has no-one in his family except his servant Khoma and a pocket watch which is an inherited possession. The daily life of Sudhamoy revolves around this watch. At one point of time, he becomes completely obsessed with this and he starts believing in the pocket watch solely. How this obsession changes his life is the central focus of the story. Moreover, the story is a glaring example of our lives becoming entirely mechanised.  
Super 8 (2011 film)
   In 1979, Deputy Sheriff Jack Lamb ([[Kyle Chandler]]) of Lillian, [[Ohio]], and his 14-year-old<ref></ref> son Joe ([[Joel Courtney]]), mourn the death of his mother Elizabeth ([[Caitriona Balfe]]) in a steel mill accident.<ref name="ebert-review"/> Jack blames her co-worker, Louis Dainard ([[Ron Eldard]]), as she was covering his shift while he recovered from a [[hangover]], and all Joe has left is a locket that belonged to her, that he now holds on to.  Four months after Elizabeth's funeral, Joe's best friend Charles Kaznyk ([[Riley Griffiths]]) decides to make a low-budget [[Zombie|zombie movie]] for an international film competition. Charles enlists the help of Preston Scott ([[Zach Mills]]), Martin Read ([[Gabriel Basso]]), and Cary McCarthy ([[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]]), as well as Dainard's daughter, Alice ([[Elle Fanning]]). Though their fathers would be furious, Joe and Alice become close to each other.  Charles has them film a scene at a train depot at midnight. During a rehearsal, a train approaches, and Charles has them start filming as the train passes to add 'production value'. While filming, Joe witnesses a pickup truck drive onto the tracks and ram the train, causing a massive derailment that destroys the train, the depot and the surrounding area, and separates the children from each other amidst the chaos. Joe finds himself near one container, to which the loading door is violently thrown from the carriage by an unseen force. Eventually the kids regroup and wander the wreckage. The kids investigate the wreck and find crates full of strange white cubes, then discover the truck's driver is Dr. Woodward ([[Glynn Turman]]), their biology teacher. Woodward, barely alive, warns them at gunpoint to forget what they saw that night, or else they and their parents will be killed. The children flee the scene just as a convoy from the local [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] base, led by Col. Nelec ([[Noah Emmerich]]), arrives at the scene. Nelec discovers an empty  [[super 8 film|Super 8mm film]] box, and assumes the event was purposely captured on camera.  While Joe and Charles wait for their film to be developed, the town experiences strange events: All the dogs run away, several townspeople go missing, the electrical power fluctuates and electronic items from all over are stolen. Overhearing military communications, Jack approaches Nelec to address the rising panic in town, but Nelec instead orders him arrested. Nelec orders the use of flamethrowers to start wildfires outside of town, as an excuse to evacuate people to the base. Suddenly, soldiers sweep into town to begin the evacuation. Meanwhile, Joe and Charles watch the derailment footage and discover that a large creature escaped from the train.  At the base, Joe learns from Alice's father that she is missing, abducted by the creature following an argument between Alice and her father. Joe, Charles, Martin, and Cary convince Jen ([[AJ Michalka]]), Charles' older sister, to pretend to hit on Donny (a worker at the camera shop) in order to get into town to rescue Alice. They break into Dr. Woodward's storage trailer and discover films and documents from his time as a government researcher.  They play the film, which reveals that an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] crash-landed in 1958. The Air Force captured the alien and was running experiments on it while keeping it from its ship. Woodward was one of the scientists experimenting on the ship, composed of the white cubes. At one point, the alien grabbed Woodward, apparently establishing a psychic connection with him. Now understanding the alien, he was compelled to rescue it and help it escape from Earth. He found out about the train, years later, and sought the opportunity to help the creature. The boys are caught by Nelec, but as they are taken back to base to face an unknown fate, the alien attacks their bus, tipping it over. The boys escape as the alien focuses on killing the airmen, saving Nelec for last. Meanwhile, Jack escapes from the base's brig and makes his way to the shelter housing the townsfolk. He learns from Preston about Joe's plan to rescue Alice. Jack and Dainard then agree to put aside their differences to save their kids, making amends along the way.  In town, the military attempts to kill the alien but find their hardware goes haywire in its presence, resulting in significant collateral damage to the town. Martin is injured in an explosion, so Charles stays behind with him while Joe and Cary head to the cemetery, where Joe had earlier seen something there that made him suspicious. Inside the cemetery's garage, they find a massive tunnel leading to a warren of underground caverns. In a chamber beneath the town's water tower, they find the alien has created a device from the town's stolen electronics, that it appears to be trying to fully activate, attached to the base of the tower. The alien also has several people, including Alice, hanging from the ceiling and unconscious, that it uses for food. Using Cary's firecrackers as a distraction, Joe frees Alice and the others, but they end up trapped in a dead end cavern after the alien chases them down and dispatches the others. Alice and Cary scream and cower against the tunnel wall, but Joe steps forward and tries to talk to the alien. The alien grabs Joe, who quietly speaks to the alien, telling him over and over that "bad things happen" but that the alien "can still live". After studying Joe for a moment, and then hearing its device fully activating, the alien releases him and departs, allowing the three to return to the surface.  As Joe and Alice reunite with their fathers, everyone watches as numerous metal objects from all over town are pulled to the top of the water tower by an unknown force. The white cubes are also pulled in to assemble into the alien's spaceship, using the objects and the water tower as its base. As it nears completion, the alien enters the spaceship. The locket is then drawn from out of Joe's pocket towards the tower and Joe, after a brief moment, decides to let it go, completing the ship. The water tank implodes and as the tower legs fall to the street, the ship rockets into space. Joe takes Alice's hand as they watch the ship depart into the night sky.  During the credits, the kids' completed film, entitled ''The Case,'' is shown.

While on her way to see him, she flashes back to the time the group of friends went on a trip together. While on the bus Na-mi draws a portrait of Joon-ho; she later goes in search of him with the intention of giving him the drawing. When she finds him, she is shocked to see him and Su-ji kiss. She leaves in tears and never gives him the picture. Now as an adult, she goes to the record shop Joon-ho owns and sees Joon-ho's son (who looks exactly like the younger Joon-ho). She then gives the now-older Joon-ho ([[Lee Geung-young]]) the drawing, and by doing so she is able to let go of her first love.

 Sgt. Paul Cutler ([[Gabriel Macht]]) is an ex-military [[Los Angeles Police Department]] [[Special Weapons and Tactics|S.W.A.T. officer]] and considered to be one of the best, even holding a record of having no civilian casualties for ten years. After successfully rescuing hostages with no casualties, Cutler is requested to train the Detroit S.W.A.T. with an updated training curriculum from the [[F.B.I.]]'s [[Hostage Rescue Team]] training program. Shortly after arriving in Detroit, Cutler immediately imposes his authority and has a rough time with the Captain ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) of the department as well as one of the senior S.W.A.T. leaders Justin Kellogg ([[Nicholas Gonzalez]]). During the middle of a training exercise, the team responds to an emergency call when ex-government agent Walter Hatch ([[Robert Patrick]]) is holding his girlfriend ([[Kristanna Loken]]) hostage.  The girl is rescued but takes Officer Kellogg's handgun and asks Cutler to move so she can shoot Hatch. When Cutler tries to calm her down, she puts the gun to her head and commits suicide. Cutler's 10-year record with no hostages lost is broken and it takes its toll on him. The rift between Cutler and Kellogg escalates at a local bar, where Cutler makes a bet for Kellogg to beat him in a higher score with an arcade machine in exchange for Cutler leaving the city. Kellogg loses the bet, and is instead reassigned to "Charlie Company". Due to low manpower, Cutler enlists military squadmate Lori Barton ([[Shannon Kane]]) to assist his training. As the training goes on, Hatch steals a binder which contains details of tactics and information on the members. Meanwhile, Cutler starts a passionate relationship with Kim Byers ([[Carly Pope]]), the Detroit PD's Psychiatrist. The phone calls from Hatch now increase and he kidnaps Kim after planting a bomb under Cutler's car and shooting a member of S.W.A.T.. The Captain orders Cutler to return to [[Los Angeles]], where Hatch wouldn't be able to target him.  The team is then called to a derelict warehouse where things do not appear to be right as no officers are on the scene. In the van, communication from the station shows that the call was a hoax. One S.W.A.T. officer is killed by a bomb while Barton and Watters are kidnapped. Aware of the full situation, Kellogg gives Cutler access to the armory and a squad car to save the hostages at one of the training grounds. Cutler briefly rescues Watters, but Watters perishes due to gunshot wounds to the chest from one of Hatch's henchmen. Cutler manages to save Barton and pursues Hatch. Cutler engages Hatch in a hand-to-hand fight while Kim tries to cut free from a bomb vest.

As he recklessly attempts to overtake another car, he swerves off the road to avoid a collision and dies.  A man involved in the crash, Colin, discovers the suitcase and gives the female driver of the oncoming car a ride back to Neverest.  There, he meets Frank, a local cop, and Colin discovers that the other driver is actually Frank's wife, Jina.  Colin hands the money over to Frank, who invites Colin to stay overnight while Colin waits for his car to be repaired.  When Frank leaves to secure the cash, Jina unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Colin.  When Colin notices a bruise on Jina, she claims that Frank beats her, but Colin becomes suspicious when he hears Frank and Jina have rough sex, which she seems to enjoy.

Although pressed for time to make a job interview in a nearby town, Colin agrees.  At the house, Charlie surprises and knocks out Frank, who is preparing to leave town.  After he ransacks the house, Charlie leaves with a picture of Jina.  When Frank awakes, he assumes that Jina and Colin have attempted to kill him, and he attacks them.  Jina appears to accidentally kill Frank and suggests to Colin that they dump Frank's body. Colin cynically suggests that she already had a plan prepared.  Jina convinces Colin that nobody will believe Frank's death was self-defense, and they dump his body in a mine shaft.  When Colin realizes that he dropped his [[dog tags]] at the mine, they return to retrieve them, and Colin falls in the shaft.  In the mine, he discovers the body of missing policeman Chris Welles and realizes that Frank has escaped the mine.

As Colin accuses Jina of possibly murdering Welles, Charlie recovers the money from their cabin, and Frank jumps onto the train from an overpass.  Before Charlie can leave the cabin, Frank finds and kills him.  When Colin and Jina return, Frank admits to killing Welles and demands that they jump from the moving train. Colin knocks the gun from Frank's hand, and Jina shoots Frank, who falls out of the train. Later, Jina suggests that she and Colin keep the money for themselves, and the two kiss. Colin wakes from a nap and finds both Jina and the money gone. With nowhere else to go, Colin returns to the bar in Neverest, where he uses a $100 note to buy a beer.  Recognizing the currency, the publican tells Colin an old middle eastern story about a woman who attempts to cheat death by fleeing to a different city, only to find death waiting there for her. After this, the publican demands to know where the rest of his money is, revealing himself to be the seller's contact in Neverest.  However, before Colin can answer, the two see that the note has become wet and the ink has begun to run; it is counterfeit.  Colin wanders out of the bar, and walks off into the night.

Tadas Blinda. Pradžia
  The film begins in the winter of 1846. Two brothers are seen running through a forest from a black wolf. Present in the forest are two hunters in search of hares. While running, one of the brothers stumbles and falls into a creek, and his brother fails to rescue him. The boy is seen drowning.  The scene then shifts to a summer day in 1861, where a serf named Tadas Blinda wakes up from dreaming the last scene while washing himself. Then, he and his friend Vincas venture into a forest. While walking, Tadas tells his friend about how the previous landowner Adam Razumowski died during a hunting trip, how his wife committed suicide, and that their money is buried somewhere. Tadas dreams of finding the money and buying his freedom from his master Gruinius. Once they arrive at the forest, they see a young woman by a pond trying to fish out a water lily. The two men think she is a ghost of the late Razumowski's wife and make a scene, frightening the woman so that she falls into the pond. Tadas rushes into the pond to save her.  The scene then shifts to a man looking for his wife Konstancija, who is secretly having an affair with a man named Edmundas in the cellar. Konstancija rushes into the hallway and tells her husband, a landowner named Bernardas Gruinius, that she was only looking for the cook. The suspicious Bernardas runs to the cellar to check if someone is there, but finds no one. Edmundas avoids detection by hiding in an old chest.  In St. Petersburg, the imperial statesman [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov|Mikhail Muravyov]] informs the Junior Officer of the Imperial Army Janek Razumowski that [[Alexander II of Russia|Czar Alexander II]] has emancipated the serfs in the [[Northwestern Krai]] and commands him to gather his troops to suppress the impending peasant rebellion in that region. On that notice, Janek leaves for Lithuania.  Back at Gruinius' mansion, steward Edmundas (Konstancija's lover) threatens Bernardas to spill his secret because he is late on his bribe payments. Before a bigger conflict evolves, Janek arrives to the mansion and tells him that he has important news from St. Petersburg. While the serfs are celebrating [[Saint Jonas' Festival]], the [[Lithuanian nobility]] (Bernardas included) are discussing the recent [[Emancipation reform of 1861|Alexander II's Emancipation Manifesto]]. Janek warns the noblemen that, although the serfs have freedom, they do not have land, which, he cites, is a ground for rebellion.  Meanwhile, Edmundas tells the serfs that they are free, and directs them to Gruinius's mansion. When the serfs arrive to the mansion, the nobles, feeling threatened, raise arms against them. Bernardas tries to resolve the conflict peacefully, but Janek orders a raid against the peasants.  During the raid, Tadas is captured by Janek's troops, knocked unconscious, and left tied up inside a shack. Later that night, two of Tadas's friends, Vincas and Motiejus, rescue him. While wandering around town at night, Tadas discovers Edmundas making love to Konstancija in the stables. Upon being discovered, Edmundas accidentally knocks a lantern over and causes a fire in the stables, and later, a rebellion.  In pursuit by Edmundas, Tadas hides in one of the rooms in Gruinius' mansion. The room happens to be occupied by Kristina, the young woman at the pond whom Tadas rescued earlier. With Kristina's help, Tadas escapes the mansion unnoticed. Outside, Bernardas, Janek and his men try to put out the fire. Tadas chances upon his two friends, Vincas and Motiejus, near the stables, and Janek notices the runaway. Tadas and Vincas attempt to flee from Janek, but Janek shoots and kills Vincas. Before Janek has time to check on the corpse, Tadas is rescued from the scene by Motiejus on horseback.  At dawn, an infuriated Motiejus physically chastises Tadas for his lack of gratitude. He is upset about the fact that people have to suffer for him when saving him from trouble, but he does nothing in return for them. While Janek's men search for rebels, Tadas, feeling guilty for his actions, goes back to the village and gives his dead friend a proper burial. While wandering through town, he overhears a rebel interrogation led by one of Janek's men and takes the blame on himself for inciting the rebellion. He also discloses the rebels' hiding location – the swamp. Tadas is then forced to lead Janek's men to the hiding location. The interrogated rebels are furious at Tadas for revealing their hiding spot, but he saves them by suddenly launching a successful [[coup de main]] at the swamp against the troops.  Once freed, however, the rebels are ungrateful and even attempt to hang Tadas for his earlier treachery. Motiejus rushes into the scene and saves him. He tells the men that Tadas was the one who incited the rebellion by starting the fire in the stables and the rebels treat him with more respect. Later, more men want to join in to rebel, but Tadas rebukes them, saying that there should not be rebellion, and that he just wants to get back to ploughing the land. Still, the rebels convince him to fight for his freedom from serfdom.  Back in Gruinius' estate, Bernardas worries about how the world has turned – how he cannot tell his friends from his enemies anymore. He attempts to murder his steward Edmundas in his sleep, but Edmundas appears on the couch, brandishing a gun. Bernardas tries to throw a burning candle in his face, but ends up being tied up and forced to sign off his estate to him.  In St. Petersburg, Statesman Muravyov receives the news that Janek has successfully incited the rebellion, and immediately sends a [[telegraph]] to [[Rittmeister]] Snegiryov, instructing him to go help put down the rebellion.  After securing the estate, Edmundas begins making plans with Konstancija, and Kristina chances upon both of them kissing. Feeling hurt, she rides off to the forest, where she meets Tadas. He reveals to her his plans to rebel, but Kristina warns him that the Czar's army will be there tomorrow.  The next day, Janek goes out to meet the Czar's army led by Rittmeister Snegiryov. As the army makes its way to Gruinius' mansion, Edmundas appears and informs Janek that Gruinius and his peasants are instigating a rebellion. Edmundas and the army continue the journey, but are stopped by Blinda, who has prepared an ambush. Edmundas attempts to run off in the confusion, but is met by two rebels. They are eventually subdued by Janek, who has become highly suspicious of Edmundas' intentions. He threatens to kill him, but Edmundas retorts that if he dies, he will not be able to reveal who killed his father Adam. Then, Tadas starts fighting Janek, and Edmundas uses that opportunity to run away. Later, Janek is seen pursuing Edmundas.  Rottmeister Snegiryov finally arrives at Gruinius' estate, wounded from the ambush. He is apparently angry with Bernardas, and tells him to bring forth Tadas Blinda or else he will have him sent off to Siberia. Bernardas starts to lose hope in the situation, but his daughter Kristina tells him that help will soon be on its way.  Back at the rebel hideout, Tadas becomes disillusioned once more and tells everyone that if they continue to fight, they will only bring more trouble upon themselves. He doesn't want to accept his status as a rebel. Later, Tadas and Bernardas meet under a tree, and Bernardas recounts his secret that has been nagging him for fifteen years:  In the winter of 1846, two noblemen – Adam Razumowski and Bernardas Gruinius – went to hunt in a forest. Adam was drinking heavily when Bernardas heard the shouts of a serf kid whose brother was drowning in a creek. He rushed to save him. After dragging the kid out of the water, Bernardas saw the drunk Adam brandishing a gun, ready to shoot the unconscious boy because he thought "Lithuanian serfs were worthless". Protective of his serf, Bernardas tried to disarm his friend, and the first shot went into the air. Adam tried to get the second shot as the two noblemen continued to struggle with the gun, but he ended up shooting himself. Soon, the young Edmundas, who had witnessed the whole scene, appeared and told the distraught Bernardas that his secret will be safe with him. Seeing that Adam was still alive, Edmundas dumped his body into the creek.  At the Gruinius' estate, Edmundas, who has now been captured by Janek, reveals the secret of Adam's death, twisting the facts to portray Gruinius as a traitor who saved a rebel–turned serf Tadas Blinda in place of his father Adam. Furious at receiving such news, Janek goes off to Gruinius' mansion.  Bernardas returns home only to find his servant dead, and his family held captive by Snegiryov and Janek. Snegiryov tells Bernardas that he will be sent to [[Siberia]] for helping the rebels and Janek delivers a knockout to the landowner. Then, Snegiryov threatens to shoot the unconscious Bernardas if the two captives don't tell where Tadas Blinda is hiding. Kristina does, and the army leaves.  After seeing Tadas conversing with their master, the rebels become wary of him. Motiejus suspects that Tadas has switched sides. In truth, after the eye–opening conversation with Bernardas, Tadas no longer believes that the masters are the enemy – rather, the invading Russian soldiers, who want an internal clash so that they would have an excuse to exercise authority over the two groups, are the adversary. He tells this to the skeptical rebels, and leaves for Gruinius' estate to fight the soldiers alone.  The Russian soldiers (headed by Janek and Snegiryov) meet Blinda in the battlefield. Soon, the rebels, headed by Motiejus, join Blinda, and the battle commences. After a while of fighting, the Russian soldiers retreat from the battlefield. Although both sides suffer many casualties, Blinda, Motiejus, Snegiryov and Janek survive.  While the battle is going on, Edmundas sneaks into Gruinius' mansion and takes advantage of the captives. He attempts to strangulate Kristina, demanding her to tell him where they keep their money. Konstancija does, and Edmundas pushes her outside to lead him to the money. Bernardas, regaining consciousness, goes outside and finds Edmundas. Fully cognizant of the misfortune he has brought onto the family, Bernardas forcibly drowns him in a nearby swamp.  Gruinius and his family attempt to flee their estate, but they are met by the retreating Janek and Snegiryov. Janek takes Bernardas out for a sword duel, and Snegiryov carries Kristina away in a carriage. Janek wins the sword duel and is about to kill Bernardas when Tadas shows up with his sword. He subdues Janek and knocks him to the ground. As a last resort, Janek tries to shoot Tadas, but Motiejus sees this and shoots the young officer first, killing him instantly.  Bernardas takes the estate deed from Janek and gives it to Tadas, begging him to find his daughter. Tadas, in turn, gives the deed to the rebels and rides off on horseback in search of Kristina. Meanwhile, Bernardas forgives his wife for her infidelity. Snegiryov throws Kristina out of the carriage in the middle of the field, and Tadas finds her, unconscious. He initially thinks that Kristina is dead, but lets out a sigh of relief after she whispers to him. The film ends with an aerial shot of them both lying on the grass.  
Switch (2011 film)
 Sophie Malaterre, an unemployed Canadian graphic designer, spontaneously accepts an offer to change her life: she exchanges her Canadian (Montreal) apartment for one in Paris through an online portal called "Switch". She doesn't know her exchange partner, Bénédicte Serteaux, as the apartment keys are exchanged by mail.  On the day of arrival Sophie enjoys a stroll, but her nightmare begins when she wakes up the next day. A police task force storms into her new apartment, and she is arrested for murder and taken to the police station.  A decapitated body has been found in a locked room: the body of Thomas, the life companion of her exchange partner Serteaux.  Sophie tries to convince the investigators that she is not Serteaux, but any evidence that would prove her true identity seems to have been destroyed overnight. In the apartment, investigators find a pass that identifies Sophie as Bénédicte Serteaux. Sophie is about to be committed to a psychiatric ward, but manages to escape. She calls her mother in [[Montreal]] and asks her to find anything that will prove her identity. Marianne Malaterre spares no danger to enter the house, paying a few minutes later with her life. She is killed by the paranoid Serteaux shortly after she sees the severed head of a man in the bedroom of the house.  Around the same time in Paris: Even Serteaux's mother Alice certifies to investigators that her daughter is unrecognizable on the mug shot, as had Serteaux's neighbors previously, leaving Sophie still misidentified.  The DNA analysis of the headless corpse is surprising: Thomas and Sophie are half-siblings. Thomas' mother explains that his father was an anonymous sperm donor. Sophie's father is obviously the donor (the Malaterre family lived in Paris until Sophie was twelve years old). And not only Thomas was created by artificial insemination; Sertaux's mother used the same Parisian laboratory.   Bénédicte Serteaux, a child of wealthy parents, had everything perfectly organized. She underwent facial surgery to resemble Sophie, and hired in Paris and Montreal two young people to act as decoys. She just had not expected that her opponent is against their arrest to defend.  Serteaux grew up without a father. Her mother hated her, she admits in a bitter showdown with her half-sister Sophie, as she beats her and breaks both her legs. Fortunately, Sophie, although in excruciating pain, can use her cellphone to call Commissioner Forgeat, who had come to believe in Sophie's innocence in recent days. The call location leads him and his colleagues to a factory, where they save Sophie just before she suffers a violent death.  
Take Me Home Tonight (film)
 Matt Franklin is a recent [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate who works at a Los Angeles [[Suncoast Video]] store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at [[Goldman Sachs]] in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a [[Labor Day]] party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home.  Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan ([[Dan Fogler]]), head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new [[Mercedes-Benz]] convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some [[cocaine]] he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend [[Marriage proposal|proposes]] to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend [[graduate school]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in [[Beverly Hills]]. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser. They leave the party to go into a neighbor's backyard where they jump on a [[trampoline]], play [[truth or dare]], and end up having sex.  Meanwhile, Wendy shares her unopened admissions letter from Cambridge with Kyle, and it is revealed that she was not accepted. Kyle is visibly relieved, while Wendy is visibly upset. Matt confesses to Tori that he doesn't actually work at Goldman Sachs. Tori gets extremely upset at his deception and storms off, back to her boss's party, leaving Matt guilt-ridden. Matt finds Barry there and they leave the party, and Matt tells Barry about how he told Tori the truth about his job. Barry patronizes him for not trying to have just one night of enjoyment and attempts to lighten the mood by offering Matt a line of cocaine, despite him driving. Matt, feeling vulnerable, attempts to snort the cocaine, but ends up driving the convertible off the road and into a ditch. A police cruiser soon arrives, and it turns out to be Matt's dad and his police partner. Already disappointed with Matt's unwillingness to choose a career path, Mr. Franklin damages the convertible even more as a means of coercing Matt to get a better job in order to pay off the damages. He takes Matt and Barry into custody, but lets them off in the neighborhood with a warning. Matt apologizes to his dad for being such a failure, to which his dad replies that because he's never even tried to succeed, he's actually less than a failure. Then, in a less condescending tone, he encourages Matt to take a shot at anything in life.  Knowing Tori has left her car at the party, Matt and Barry make their way back there, where bets are being placed on who will "ride the ball", a giant, steel sphere that someone enters and rides as it's rolled down a hill (something Matt's dad has stated that nobody has done since he himself was a kid). Matt finds Tori at the party and tries to apologize, but Tori is unwilling to forgive him. Feeling he has nothing to lose, Matt volunteers to "ride the ball". When he does the ball rolls downhill uncontrollably, hitting several parked cars and eventually flying off an embankment before landing in a backyard swimming pool. Matt almost drowns as the ball sinks, but manages to escape just in time. Barry rushes to the scene and walks with Matt back toward the party, meeting up with Wendy and Tori, who are elated to discover he wasn't killed. Matt apologizes to Tori, and she forgives him after playing a little hard-to-get and then gives him her phone number. All four return to the party, which is beginning to wind down as dawn approaches. All who are still there 'whoop' it up at Matt's successful return.  Wendy, after realizing Matt was right all along, ends the [[engagement]] and breaks up with Kyle, who experiences a crying breakdown. Pondering his future with a Goth-type girl he met at the party, Barry is told by her that maybe he should go to college. Outside, as she leaves the party, Matt boldly kisses Tori goodbye. Matt's dad is shown investigating the scene where the steel ball was found. He finds Matt's Suncoast Video name tag floating in the pool, and smirks proudly. Barry staggers out of the party house, now in a shambles, to meet up with Wendy and Matt, who asks "Who wants breakfast?", and the three leave together as the sun is rising.

Take Shelter
 In [[Lagrange, Ohio]], Curtis LaForche has apocalyptic dreams and visual and auditory hallucinations of rain "like fresh motor oil", swarms of menacing black birds, and being harmed by people close to him. He hides all of this from his wife, Samantha, and their deaf daughter, Hannah.  He instead channels his anxieties into a compulsive obsession to improve and enlarge a storm shelter in his backyard; however, his increasingly strange behavior - including a tendency to cut ties with anyone in his life that has harmed him only in his dreams - strains his relationship with his family, friends, employer, and the close-knit town. Curtis grudgingly sees a counselor at a free clinic, with whom he talks about his family's psychological history.  His mother, Sarah, has [[paranoid schizophrenia]] that surfaced in her at about the same age that Curtis is now.  In order to get the expanded storm shelter done, Curtis breaks work rules by using equipment from his construction job at his house and gets a home improvement loan he can ill afford to start building the shelter - all without telling his wife.  Samantha becomes angry when she discovers the project. After Curtis takes more than the prescribed dose of a sedative and has a seizure, Samantha calls an ambulance.  He recovers, then finally explains the truth to her, including his dreams.  Curtis begins to miss more work, causing tensions with his boss, as he and Samantha make preparations for the [[cochlear implant]] surgery Hannah is to undergo in six weeks' time.  Having been informed of the borrowed work equipment, Curtis's boss fires him and gives him only two weeks' worth of medical insurance benefits, after placing Dewart, the close friend and co-worker whom Curtis asked to help him start construction of the shelter, on two weeks' unpaid administrative leave.  Curtis buys gas masks for his family and extends his previous employer's health insurance policy for a few extra weeks.  After he finds out that his counselor at the free clinic has suddenly transferred and been replaced with a new one, he walks out.  Tensions linger between Curtis and Sam over his loss of a job/income at such a crucial time for their family.  Samantha gets Curtis to see an actual psychiatrist and demands that they attend a social function so she can restore some sense of normalcy to their strained, increasingly isolated life. At a Lions Club community gathering, a bitter Dewart, who has been spreading gossip that Curtis is crazy, is angrily provoked and punches him.  Enraged, Curtis knocks Dewart to the floor, overturns a table and unleashes a frightening verbal tirade upon everyone present.  He prophetically shouts that a devastating storm is coming, insisting that none of them are prepared.  Later, a tornado warning sends him and his family into the shelter.  After they awaken, Curtis reluctantly removes his gas mask, prompted by Samantha.  They go to open the shelter doors, but he still hears a storm outside. His wife implores him, insisting that there's no storm and that he needs to open the door. After a tense standoff, Curtis throws open the doors into the blinding sun; a strong-but-bearable storm has passed, and neighbors are cleaning up broken tree limbs and other yard debris as power company trucks restore electricity along the street.  A psychiatrist advises the couple to go through with their planned, annual beach vacation, but that Curtis will need to get psychiatric care in a facility away from his family upon their return.  At [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], while Curtis is building sand castles with Hannah, she signs the word "storm".  As Samantha exits their beachhouse, the thick, oily rain that Curtis spoke of begins to fall, staining her outstretched hand.  Samantha looks up to a bigger version of the ominous storm clouds Curtis had seen, massing over the ocean; tornado-like waterspouts reach down to the ocean's surface, and the tide pulls back as a [[tsunami]] looms in the distance. Curtis and Samantha exchange knowing glances.

Take This Waltz (film)
 Margot, a freelance writer, meets Daniel, an artist and [[rickshaw]] operator, while on a business trip, and although they immediately share some chemistry, she reveals to him that she is married. However, it turns out that Daniel is living across the street from Margot and her husband Lou in Toronto. Although Lou and Margot appear happy together, it becomes clear that Margot is not completely satisfied with her marriage, possibly aggravated by encountering Daniel. As the film progresses Margot and Daniel interact more and more until she ultimately leaves her husband to be with him. Lou is saddened, yet understanding. The audience is then shown a montage of Margot's new life with Daniel, including several brief sex scenes, though it is clear that she begins to regret leaving her husband. Geraldine, Lou's sister and a recovering alcoholic, confronts Margot (while drunk) and tells her that she should have just accepted that life has gaps and that changing relationships was not the answer. The resolution is shown in a very subtle and rather metaphoric way. She goes to the same attitude that used with her husband, holding him by the back and trying hard to get close to him. While we do not see Daniel's face anymore, it is implicit that she is better alone going around and around seemingly happy in the game of life.

Tanu Weds Manu
 Manoj "Manu" Sharma ([[R. Madhavan]]) is an NRI doctor living in London. He comes to India to [[Arranged marriage|find an Indian bride]] and get married. His parents have already short-listed some girls for him to meet, and they take him to [[Kanpur]] to meet Tanuja "Tanu" Trivedi ([[Kangana Ranaut]]). After they land in Kanpur, a bunch of goons on the street pick a quarrel with Manu for no reason at all, and give him a few slaps, due to which he reaches the Trivedi residence in an untidy condition. At Tanu's house, the two sets of parents find that they get on extremely well with each other, and decide that if Manu likes Tanu, they can finalize the matter immediately. There is one minor hitch: Tanu's mother tells her guests that Tanu has been ill since yesterday and is unable to rise from bed. She asks Manu to go up to Tanu's bedroom and meet her there. She shows Manu to Tanu's room and goes away to the kitchen. Tanu is very unresponsive, and Manu initially thinks that she is shy and bashful. He soon realizes that Tanu is in fact fast asleep. He gazes upon her beautiful sleeping figure, and likes what he sees. He comes downstairs and tells both the families that he is willing to marry her.  Before making the engagement public, the families decide to go on a pilgrimage and seek the blessings of God. During the train journey, Tanu finds an opportunity to speak privately with Manu, and tells him that she had intentionally taken sleeping pills to fall asleep, to avoid meeting him. She tells him rudely that she loves someone else, and that she has her lover's name tattooed on her chest; she also tells him that the thugs who had roughed him up when he initially landed in Kanpur had been sent by her boyfriend. She demands that Manu should now reject her. Manu is extremely disappointed because he likes her immensely, and so do his parents, but he dutifully does the decent thing. Taking the blame upon himself, and not revealing to anyone the fact that the girl is having a love affair with another man, he tells his father to convey to Tanu's parents that after getting to know their daughter better, he has decided not to marry her. Tanu's parents are more than a little miffed at this turn of events, but since the forthcoming engagement was known only to them, there is no public loss of face.  Weeks pass, and Manu's parents bring out other proposals from their shortlist for him to meet. He meets several prospective girls from suitable families, but cannot forget Tanu. One of the girls he meets is Ayushi (Neha Kaul), who had lost both her parents while still a child, and whose brother Raja ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) is her guardian. Raja, himself only a teenager when their parents died, had taken care of Ayushi, never letting her suffer in any way. What exactly Raja does in order to support himself and his sister is a mystery. Unknown to anyone, he is a card-sharp and part of a group of small-time gangsters who accept "contracts" to perform various relatively minor crimes. He is also good-hearted, compassionate to the poor, loves his sister sincerely, and wants her to be married to a decent man and to settle down as wife and mother. After meeting Ayushi, Manu tells Raja that she is a very nice girl, but that he cannot in good conscience marry her, because he harbours one-sided love for some other girl. Raja commends him for his honesty and treats him with immense respect.  Manu and his friend Pappi ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) travel to Punjab to attend the wedding of another school friend Jassi ([[Eijaz Khan]]). Upon arriving, Manu finds out that Tanu is present there, and that she is a friend of Payal ([[Swara Bhaskar]]), Jassi's bride-to-be. Over the next few days, Manu and Tanu strike up a friendship. Tanu tells Manu that she is on the verge of eloping, that she and her lover are going to get secretly married in a registry office, and then present her parents with a ''fait accompli.'' She asks him to be a witness to their wedding in the registry office. As they leave on a train back to Chandigarh, they meet Raja again, and after explaining to Raja how Manu is in love with someone, Raja states they will all go back to Kanpur and promises Manu he will marry him to any girl he falls in love with. As Manu and Pappi reach Jassi's "baraat", Manu receives a call from Raja, revealing that Raja is Tanu's boyfriend. Manu goes to the registrar's office, where Raja and Tanu are planning to elope, but they are not able to find a pen to sign the papers! Manu has a pen in his jacket, but lies and pretends that he does not have a pen, and the marriage is postponed for lack of a pen. Manu expresses shock that Raja, whom he had regarded as a decent man and dutiful brother, should be eloping in this way. Raja tells Manu that he does not want to be married in this stealthy way, but Tanu's family would never accept him, which is why they are eloping. He requests Manu to intercede with Tanu's family and persuade them to agree to her marrying Raja. Again, Manu does the decent thing. He talks to Tanu's father, and convinces him to accept Raja. Seeing that their daughter is adamant, and relieved that an elopement has been averted, Tanu's parents accepts the situation, albeit unwillingly.  Preparations for Tanu's wedding with Raja begin. Tanu accidentally sees the wedding gift that Manu is preparing for her. It is a large poster, a collage of numerous photographs of Tanu in her various moods and poses, which Manu had snapped on various occasions. He is investing the time and effort needed to painstakingly create this collage as a special wedding gift for her. Tanu is touched. Meanwhile, Raja does not have the time to buy Tanu a wedding [[sari]], so he asks Manu to help him out. Manu hunts out a beautiful sari in the markets of the city and delivers it to Tanu. At this time, he tells Tanu how glad he is that she is getting married in a respectable manner, with the consent of parents, in the sight of God, dressed beautifully as a bride in that lovely sari. He confesses to Tanu that at the registry office, he did have a pen in his jacket, but did not want her to be married that way, and therefore he lied. At that precise moment, Raja appears, and takes Tanu away with him to meet some friends. As she walks away with Raja, Tanu has mixed feelings. She is also very conscious of how nervous and reluctant her parents are about her marrying Raja, how they have no connect with him at all, compared to how quickly they hit it off with Manu's parents and with Manu himself. That evening, after reaching home, she contacts Manu and asks him if he is in love with her. Manu gives her a truthful answer. After giving the matter some thought, Tanu decides to marry Manu, not Raja.  Tanu's parents are rejoiced and delighted with this turn of events. Her father makes all haste to approach Manu's parents and seek the alliance from them in the traditional manner. Manu's parents, who know nothing of recent events, are surprised to see Tanu's father at their door; after all, they had already refused him once, at the end of the disastrous pilgrimage. However, they had always liked Tanu and her family, and it was Manu who had refused to marry her. After a quick consultation with Manu, who indicates his acceptance, they duly consent to the alliance. By this time, Raja has been informed that Tanu does not wish to marry him. Furious, he storms into her house and threatens her father with dire consequences if Tanu is married to anyone other than him. Meanwhile, preparations for Tanu's wedding are continuing as usual. Tanu's father bribes an Inspector of Police as per the instruction of Pappi and Jassi, and gets Raja arrested on false charges. The plan is that Raja will remain in jail for a few days, during which time Tanu will be married and safely sent away. However, everyone is shocked to see that Raja is arriving in a wedding processional as promised, and arrives at the wedding venue at the same time as Manu, the bridegroom. Raja brandishes a gun and creates a scene. Manu however refuses to be scared and begins reasoning with Raja.

The Theatre Bizarre
   The film contains six stories, each inspired by Paris’ legendary [[Grand Guignol]] theatre.<ref name="theatrefango"/>  The six stories are presented within a connecting framework, "Theatre Guignol": Enola Penny is intrigued by an abandoned theatre in her neighborhood. One night the theatre door mysteriously opens and she enters. A puppet host (or [[Guignol]]) introduces six short films: "The Mother of Toads", "I Love You", "Wet Dreams", "The Accident", "Vision Stains" and "Sweets". As each is shown, the host becomes more human and Enola becomes more puppet-like.  Of the six segments, "I Love You", "Wet Dreams" and "Sweets" match the Grand Guignol genre: physical or psychological [[Conte cruel|conte cruel]] horror with natural explanations, cynical, amoral, ironic, sexy, or gory in combinations.  "The Mother of Toads" is loosely based on a supernatural horror story by [[Clark Ashton Smith]] with elements from [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s work. Set in France, the story concerns an American anthropologist and his girlfriend who fall victim to a witch known as The Mother of Toads after the witch sells them a pair of [[Elder Sign]] earrings and shows the anthropologist a copy of [[The Necronomicon]].   "I Love You", set in Berlin, concerns a man who awakes on his bathroom floor with bloodstains around him and deep cuts in his right hand. He is an obsessive man who follows and calls his partner constantly. His partner, a French woman, announces she is leaving him and that she has been unfaithful to him on many occasions and even had an abortion without him knowing. The obsessive nature of the man's love leads to their doom.  In "Wet Dreams" a man relates to his psychiatrist recurring nightmares about torture and castration often at the hands of his wife whom he has betrayed and abused.  In "The Accident" a mother and young daughter drive along a mountain road and come upon a fatal collision between a motorcyclist and a deer. Another biker puts the suffering deer out of its misery with his knife. The mother thoughtfully and poetically answers her daughter's questions about the nature of life and death. Most reviewers note "The Accident" seems out of place yet many describe it as the heart of the film.   "Vision Stains" is about a writer/serial killer who cannot dream. She extracts fluid from her victims' eyes as they die and injects it into her own eye so she can experience the others' lives as they flash by in their dying moments. She then logs it all in her journals. Finally she goes a step further, which leaves her able to dream at last, but at a horrible price.  "Sweets" is the story of Estelle and Greg, a pair of food fetishists who gorge on sweets, and their break up, which ends at a gourmet cult feast with Greg as the main entree.

The Thing (2011 film)
  In 1982, an alien spacecraft is discovered beneath the Antarctic ice by a team from a Norwegian research base: Edvard ([[Trond Espen Seim]]), Jonas ([[Kristofer Hivju]]), Olav (Jan Gunnar Røise), Karl ([[Carsten Bjørnlund]]), Juliette (Kim Bubbs), Lars ([[Jørgen Langhelle]]), Henrik (Jo Adrian Haavind), Colin (Jonathan Lloyd Walker), and Peder ([[Stig Henrik Hoff]]). [[Columbia University]] [[paleontologist]] Kate Lloyd ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]) is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]) and his assistant Adam Finch ([[Eric Christian Olsen]]) to investigate the discovery.  They travel to the Norwegian base, Thule Station, located in Antarctica near [[The Thing (1982 film)#Production|U.S. Outpost 31]], in a helicopter manned by Carter ([[Joel Edgerton]]), Derek ([[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]), and Griggs ([[Paul Braunstein]]). After viewing the spacecraft, Kate, Sander, and Adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby. In the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice.  That evening, while the team celebrates their find, Derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building. The team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed Lars's dog. Olav and Henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs Henrik. The rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it. An autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating Henrik's own.  Derek, Carter, Griggs and a sick Olav take the helicopter to seek help. Kate discovers bloody [[Dental restoration|dental fillings]] near a blood-soaked shower. She runs outside to flag down the helicopter after it takes off. When it attempts to land, Griggs transforms into the Thing and attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to spin out of control and crash in the mountains. When Kate returns to the shower, she finds the blood is gone.  The team decides to send a party to the closest base, but Kate confronts them with her theory that the Thing can imitate them and has likely already done so. They dismiss her claims, but Juliette says she saw Colin leaving the showers. When Juliette and Kate look for the vehicle keys to prevent the others from leaving, Juliette transforms and tries to attack Kate. As Kate flees, she runs past Karl, who is impaled by the creature. Lars arrives with a [[flamethrower]] and burns the creature just as it assimilates Karl. At nightfall, they burn the remains of the Juliette-Thing and Karl's body.  That night, Edvard, Kate and Lars find Carter and Derek stumbling into base, half frozen. The team refuses to believe that they could have survived the crash. Kate has them [[Quarantine|isolated]] until a test can be prepared to verify they are human. Adam and Sander had started to work on a test, but the lab is set on fire in the few minutes it's left unattended. Kate proposes another test, believing that the Thing cannot imitate inorganic material. She inspects everyone and singles out those without [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] dental fillings: Sander, Edvard, Adam, and Colin, while herself, Peder, Jonas and Lars are proven human.  Lars and Jonas go to retrieve Carter and Derek for testing, and discover they have broken out. As Lars searches a nearby building, he is suddenly pulled inside. The group hears Carter and Derek breaking into the building and rushes to intercept them. In the middle of a standoff, Edvard orders Peder to burn them. Before he can, Derek shoots Peder dead in self-defense with Lars' gun, but also punctures the flamethrower's fuel tank, setting off an explosion that knocks Edvard unconscious.  When brought to the rec room, Edvard transforms and [[Infection|infects]] Jonas and kills Derek before assimilating Adam. Kate torches the infected Jonas and Derek's body before she and Carter pursue the Thing. While the pair searches, Sander is ambushed by the Thing and Colin hides in the radio room and isn't seen again. They get separated and the Thing, into which Edvard and Adam are now fused, corners Carter in the kitchen, but Kate burns it before it can kill him. They then see an infected Sander drive off into the blizzard and pursue him in the remaining [[snowcat]]. While they are pursuing Sander, Kate notices that Carter is wearing his gold earring, reassuring her that he is still human at this point.  They arrive at the spacecraft, where it suddenly activates and its engines begin to melt the ice over it. Kate falls into the ship and is separated from Carter. Kate discovers the source of the radio transmission at the beginning of the film, in the form of a giant glowing cylinder with strange geometric blocks forming and shifting apart, the signal still broadcasting. Confronted by Sander, who has transformed into a larger creature, Kate destroys it with a thermite grenade and the explosion deactivates the ship, shutting down its engines. Kate and Carter escape the ship and Carter suggests driving to a [[Soviet]] base about fifty miles away, saying that they'd stashed enough fuel in their snowcat to be just able to cover that distance.  As Kate and Carter return to their vehicle, Kate notices that Carter is missing his earring and becomes suspicious. She tells him that she knew he was human earlier because he was still wearing the earring, implying she suspects he may have been assimilated while they were separated in the alien ship. Upon hearing this, Carter realizes that the earring is missing and points to his ear while attempting to explain its disappearance and reassure Kate. When Carter points to the wrong ear, Kate realizes he must have been assimilated and proceeds to burn him. She then retreats to Sander's snowcat and stares blankly as the [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|screen fades black]].  As the final credits roll, a helicopter pilot, Matias, arrives by morning at the now destroyed Norwegian outpost. He shouts, looking for any survivors. Colin is shown to have committed suicide in the radio room using a straight razor to slash both his arms and throat to ensure the Thing could never get to him. Matias sees the charred remains of the Adam/Edvard-Thing in the snow.  Lars, now revealed to be alive and uninfected, orders Matias at gunpoint to show his dental fillings to prove that he is a human. The Thing, having taken the form of Lars' deceased dog, runs out of the camp. Lars realizes it's the Thing and orders Matias to start the helicopter. As the dog flees, the two chase it in the Norwegian helicopter, with Matias piloting and Lars leaning out of the open doorway, trying to shoot it with a scoped rifle, thus leading into the events of the [[The Thing (1982 film)|1982 film]].  
This Must Be the Place (film)
 Cheyenne is a wealthy former rock star, now bored and jaded in his 20-year retirement in Dublin. He retired after two of his teenaged fans committed suicide. He travels to New York to reconcile with his estranged father during his final hours, only to arrive too late. The reason he gives for not communicating with his father for 30 years was that his father rejected him when he put on [[goth subculture|goth]] make-up at the age of 15. He reads his father's diary and learns about his father's persecution in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] at the hands of former [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officer Alois Lange. He visits a professional [[Nazi hunter]] named Mordecai Midler who tells him that Lange is small fry.  Cheyenne begins a journey across the United States to track down Lange. Cheyenne finds the wife of Lange, Lange's granddaughter and a businessman. He buys a large gun. At the gun shop, a bystander delivers a soliloquy about a certain type of pistol that allows people to "kill with impunity," and given that ability, "if we’re licensed to be monsters we end up having just one desire – to truly be monsters."  When Cheyenne eventually tracks Lange down with the aid of Mordecai, Lange, now blind, says that he received hate mail from Cheyenne's father for decades. Lange recounts the incident that led to Cheyenne's father's obsession with Lange, in which Cheyenne's father peed his pants from fear; Lange describes this as a "minor incident" in comparison to the true horrors of Auschwitz, but mentions that he came to admire the man's single-minded determination to dedicate his life to making his own miserable. Cheyenne takes a photo of Lange and whispers that it was an injustice for his father to die before Lange did. Cheyenne forces the old blind man to walk out into the salt flats naked, like a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victim; skin and bones and numb with fear. Cheyenne and Mordecai drive away soon afterwards, leaving him still standing in the flats.  Cheyenne travels home via airplane (something he had previously had a strong phobia of), cuts his rockstar hair and stops wearing his goth make-up, jewelry and outfits.

Thor (film)
  In 965 AD, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim 2|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|nine realms]], starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].  In the present, Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjölnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.  Thor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.  Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover his strength. Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifröst]]—the means of traveling between worlds—to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjölnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.  In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object, which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.

The Three Musketeers (2011 film)
 In [[Venice]], the [[Musketeer#Musketeers in France|musketeers]] [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]], with the help of [[Milady de Winter]], steal airship blueprints made by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. However, they are betrayed by Milady, who incapacitates them and sells the blueprints to the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].  A year later, [[Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan|d'Artagnan]] leaves his village in [[Gascony]] for [[Paris]] in hopes of becoming a musketeer as his father was, only to learn that they were disbanded. At a rural bar, he challenges [[Comte de Rochefort|Captain Rochefort]], leader of [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. Once in Paris, d'Artagnan separately encounters Athos, Porthos and Aramis and, accidentally offending all three, schedules separate duels with each. Athos brings Porthos and Aramis to the duel as his seconds, causing d'Artagnan to realize their true identities. Richelieu's guards arrive to apprehend them, but, inspired by d'Artagnan, the musketeers fight together and win. All four are summoned before the young [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] and Richelieu urges him to execute them, but [[Anne of Austria|Queen Anne]] is impressed by their bravery and the king condecorates them instead.  Richelieu instructs Milady, now his accomplice, to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions, steal her diamond necklace, and take it to the [[Tower of London]] in order to frame her as having an affair with Buckingham, which would force King Louis to execute her and declare war on [[England]]. At this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: Richelieu himself. In order to secure her own position, Milady demands that Richelieu declare in a written authorization that she is working on behalf of France.  The false letters are found and given to King Louis, who is advised by Richelieu to set up a ball at which Queen Anne would be forced to wear the necklace. If she doesn't, then her affair is real, and there will be war. Queen Anne's [[lady-in-waiting]] Constance Bonacieux discovers Richelieu's plan and pleads with the musketeers to stop him. They follow Milady and Buckingham to [[London]], while Constance is captured by Rochefort for helping the musketeers to escape from him.  In London, Milady tells Buckingham the musketeers have arrived to take revenge on him and teaches him all their tendencies in battle. D'Artagnan is captured, but turns out to be a decoy following the plan Milady would have ''expected'' the Musketeers to follow, allowing his associates to steal Buckingham's airship and rescue him. Milady's getaway [[coachman]] reveals himself as the musketeers' manservant Planchet and delivers her to his masters, who retrieve the necklace from her. Athos prepares to execute Milady for her treachery, but she leaps off the airship, apparently dying on her own terms.  The musketeers depart back to Paris, only to be intercepted by Rochefort in a much larger airship, for Milady had given Richelieu copies of da Vinci's blueprints. Rochefort offers to exchange Constance for the necklace, but captures d'Artagnan and mounts an assault as soon as he retrieves the jewels. His superior airship has the upper hand and severely damages the opposing vessel, but the musketeers use the clouds to rally and counterattack. The fight ends when both ships ram each other, crashing onto [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]]. On the roof, d'Artagnan duels and ultimately kills Rochefort. Constance is sent ahead to quietly return the necklace to Queen Anne. The musketeers arrive at the ball and, for the sake of King Louis and his people, lie by claiming that Rochefort tried to sabotage an airship that Richelieu built for them, and that they executed him for his treason on Richelieu's permission. To convince the king, Athos presents Milady's authorization, which the former accepts. Richelieu, satisfied, offers the musketeers a place in his guards, but they refuse, and Richelieu vows revenge.  Meanwhile, Milady is found alive at the [[English Channel]] by Buckingham, who declares his intention to exact revenge. The camera then pulls back to show him advancing towards France with a massive fleet of battleships and airships.

In the restroom she is attacked by Keech who angrilly tells her "it was a just mangy little stray".   Lewis is able to trace Vicki to the bar but again arrives too late, finding her murdered also. When Lewis tries to catch Keech, he disappears out of the window.  The police still doubt his story about the killer, Lewis' only evidence is a small piece of the killer's coat torn off during the earlier fight and a bloody fingerprint on a newspaper clipping.  He sends both to a friend at a local crime lab. When he follows up she tells him the preliminary results from the DNA test on the blood only show one result. An 11-year-old orphan living in a local boys' home. She also shows him that the fabric of the coat reacts to heat, a quality she has never seen before in a fabric.  Believing that the killer may be a relative of the boy, Lewis goes to the home and introduces himself to the director Polly (Nicki Aycox) as a mentor for big brother program, and asks to meet the boy. Polly seems hesitant as the boy has had behavioral problem and been returned by several foster families, but agrees to let Lewis meet him. She introduces Lewis to the orphan, James Keech (Austin Abrams).  James seems to distrust all adults and especially dislikes the nuns at the home (whom he referrers to as 'the penguins') and is at first unreceptive to Lewis but agrees to go to the zoo.  At the zoo Lewis asks James what he would like to be when he grows up, James seems unsure, but says he is good with math and would like to be an inventor, maybe even making a time machine so he could go back and fix his life. Back at the home James tells Lewis he wants to show him something, promising him to secrecy. Lewis promises and James shows him his 'private zoo'; a box with several small animals, including a mouse, a frog and a dragonfly that are all dead and partially dissected similar to the murder victims.  However, Lewis is shocked and James becomes very upset, yelling at him to leave. Polly hears the yelling and comes into the dorm where James angrily accuses Lewis of trying to molest him. Polly doesn't believe the accusation as James has a history of making similar claims. Lewis starts to tells Polly about the dead animals but James was angrily shouts that he promised not to tell. Lewis decides not to say anything and leaves.  Lewis deduces that the killer isn't a relative of James but rather James himself, having traveled back from the future to 'fix his life'. As Lewis continues to try to stop the killer, he tries to find the third woman from the journal. The evidence leads him back to the boys' home. While talking to Polly he sees her college degree on the wall and realizes she is the third woman on the killer's list, with Polly being a nickname. Lewis is then arrested at the boy's home and taken to the police station.  At the police station he tries to explain but the police still do not believe him. Keech arrives pretending to be Lewis' lawyer. During a private conference he reveals to Lewis that his theory is correct, showing Lewis the pocket watch from the alley revealing it to actually be a time machine, and that he is James from the year 2032 coming back to fix his life. James uses the time machine to teleport himself to the group home, where he has already imprisoned Polly on the roof, but Lewis grabs the vanishing James and teleports with him.  Keech demands that Lewis get the younger James from his room, threatening to kill Polly if he doesn't. Lewis quietly enters the dorm and prepares to kill the younger James hoping to set the time-line right, but can't bring himself to kill the sleeping child. Instead, he hides James inside a restroom, and goes to the roof. Keech explains that the woman from the opening scene was his mother who was abusive so he killed her. However, he further reveals that each change has simply resulted in another change to be corrected: After his mother's murder, he was abused by others, and Felicia failed to win the resultant child abuse case; after Felicia's murder, Vicki reported his misbehavior at school, resulting in him being moved from one abusive foster home to another; after Vicki's murder, he was placed in the group home, where a dire future still awaits the young James. Adult James believes Polly's murder will finally break the cycle and allow his younger self a better chance in life. He intends to frame Lewis for Polly's murder, with young James capturing the supposed serial killer Lewis, becoming a hero and giving him[self] a fresh start.   Meanwhile, young James leaves the bathroom and follows Lewis to the roof. James sees his older self and asks Keech if he is his father, but Keech tells him the truth about being his future self. James gets upset that Keech plans to hurt Polly, stating that she is the only person that has been nice to him, but Keech tells James that Polly will soon find his “private zoo” and will send him to a mental hospital where his abuse continues. While on the roof, Keech reveals  two more inventions: the small tazer like device from the opening scene is revealed to actually be a cutting torch, and the knife is shown to be an advanced motorized weapon with the serrated edge cycling like a chainsaw. During the struggle Keech drops the knife which James picks up and uses to slash Keech's leg. However, Keech pushes James away and accidentally knocks him off the roof. Keech turns to kill Lewis but as James dies from the fall Keech disappears.  During the closing scenes Lewis is seen driving. Using a voice over he explains that since James died at the age of 11 the time line was 'made right' and he never became the serial killer. Each of the killer's victims is shown to still be alive including James himself. We see Lewis driving past the rundown house from the beginning of the movie which we now know to be James's mother's house. After seeing, James come out the front door to take out the trash, Lewis goes home to reunite with his wife and son. However, the viewers remember that it was his mother's abuse that started James on his series of murders in the first place, leaving open the question of whether the cycle will start anew.  
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)
 In October 1973, "[[Control (fictional character)|Control]]", head of [[Secret Intelligence Service|British intelligence]] (referred to as "The Circus"), sends agent [[Jim Prideaux]] to [[Budapest]] to meet a Hungarian general wishing to defect. Prideaux is shot and presumed killed. Amidst the [[international incident]] that follows, Control and his right-hand man [[George Smiley]] are forced into retirement. Control dies of illness shortly after.  Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief, [[Bill Haydon]] his deputy, and Roy Bland and [[Toby Esterhase]] his lieutenants. Despite Control and Smiley's misgivings, their successors have already begun a secret operation—"Witchcraft"—to obtain highly sensitive information from the [[Soviet Union]], which is in turn being traded with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] for American intelligence. Smiley is enlisted by [[Cabinet Office]] civil servant Oliver Lacon to investigate a claim by [[Ricki Tarr]], a British spy, that for years there has been a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in a senior role in the Circus, a suspicion that Control had shared. Smiley chooses a trustworthy agent, [[Peter Guillam]], and retired [[Special Branch#United Kingdom|Special Branch]] officer Mendel to help him. He interviews former Circus [[Intelligence analysis|analyst]] Connie Sachs, who was sacked by Alleline after she deduced that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet [[cultural attaché]] in [[London]], was a spy.  Tarr tells Smiley that on an assignment in [[Istanbul]], he had an affair with Irina, a Soviet agent. She wanted to reveal the name of a mole in the top ranks of the Circus but when Tarr reported this to London, they ignored him and ordered him straight home, while the Soviets promptly kidnapped Irina. Concluding that the mole had intercepted his message, Tarr went into hiding, suspected of defecting and murdering the British station chief. Smiley sends Guillam to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr had called and he finds the pages for that night have been cut out, supporting Tarr's story. Smiley discovers that Prideaux is alive, having been [[Prisoner exchange|exchanged]] with the Soviets after a period of brutal [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|interrogation]], and living a life of solitude as a school teacher. Smiley interviews Prideaux, who reveals that the true purpose of the mission to Hungary was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects "Tinker" (Alleline), "Tailor" (Haydon), "Soldier" (Bland), "Poorman" (Esterhase) and "Beggarman" (Smiley).  Smiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland and Esterhase have been meeting Polyakov—the "Witchcraft" source—at a safe house somewhere in London, where Polyakov gives them supposedly high-grade Soviet intelligence, in exchange for low-grade British material to help him maintain his cover with the Soviets. However, the mole is actually passing substantive material, including US intelligence, to Polyakov, his [[Agent handler|handler]], whilst Polyakov's material has just enough substance to persuade the CIA to share information with the British. Smiley blackmails Esterhase with a threat of deportation to get the safe house's location. Smiley then has Tarr appear at the [[Paris]] office, implying he knows who the mole is. The mole is revealed to be Haydon when he meets Polyakov at the safe house, where Smiley captures him. The Circus plans to exchange Haydon with the Soviets but he is killed by Prideaux, avenging his betrayal by his once closest friend. Smiley returns to the Circus as its new chief.

Laure's mother is quick to understand and plays along, but after the visitors have left, she scolds Laure for pretending to be a boy.

Lisa is stunned to see Laure in a dress and runs off without a word.   Deeply embarrassed, Laure goes to the woods. After a time there, she takes off the blue dress, leaving her in a tank top and boy-style shorts. Walking away from the discarded dress, Laure sees the other children in the distance. She can hear them talking about her, speculating if she is a girl or not. When they spot her, the boys chase and capture her and say they're going to see if she's really a girl. Lisa stands up to them and tells them to leave her alone. But when they tell Lisa: "You kissed him. If it's a girl, that's disgusting, isn't it?" Lisa has to agree and reluctantly looks in Laure's shorts, with Laure in tears but letting her. Lisa is shocked. The boys and Lisa leave while Laure remains in the woods, devastated.  Later, we see Laure in her house with her mom, younger sister and new-born baby brother, not wanting to go outside. But when she sees Lisa waiting outside her window, she goes out to see her. After a long silence, Lisa quietly asks her for her name. She says her name is Laure and finally seems to get over her embarrassment.

 During lunch with Benny, Top Cat spots a female cat walking by them. Excusing himself, Top Cat quickly runs after the female cat, interrupted by Griswald, but soon gets him out of the way and meets up with the female cat, who introduces herself as Trixie. While she finds him amusing, an alley cat isn't her type.  At the alley, Top Cat catches news of the Maharajah of Peekajoo, known for his generosity and his rubies are just what Top Cat needs to impress Trixie. Top Cat and his gang head to the Connity Hall to meet the Maharajah, running into an obnoxious man named Lou Strickland. The gang steal his tickets and get him sent away. While the gang distract Officer Dibble who is the Maharaja's escort, Top Cat makes a bet with the Maharaja and gets out of him a Maharaja Talk 5000 device with many functions, as the Maharaja hasn't any rubies.  The next morning, Officer Dibble is summoned to the police station to work for the Chief's son-in-law Strickland, who is taking over for the retired Chief. Strickland has replaced the staff with robots which he believes are more competent. Top Cat thwarts Strickland's attempt to evict him, preventing Strickland from getting the Mayor's funding for a robot police army. Strickland uses Trixie to keep Top Cat away from the alley while he carries his out his plan. Top Cat returns to the alley getting shunned by his gang, arrested by police and after an unfair trial, convicted to the Dog Jail on charge of stealing money from an orphanage.  With the arrest of Top Cat, Strickland is granted the Mayor's funding and establishes a robot police army and a major scale surveillance camera system which restricts privacy for the city. Meanwhile, Top Cat tries to keep a low profile in dog jail but later becomes popular having turned the jail into a paradise for the convicts. As for Top Cat's gang they are struggling and begin to express their disbelief in him, which Top Cat notices from the one of the security cameras.  Strickland abuses his authority and starts coming up with ridiculous laws to take absurd amounts of money off people for every thing they do, intending to spend it on making himself even more 'handsome'. Tired of Strickland's tyranny, Trixie quits her job, Strickland fires her and turns to Officer Dibble and shows him evidence that a robot Top Cat sent by Strickland robbed the orphanage proving Top Cat's innocence. However, Strickland arrives and reveals his true intentions to Dibble, and that he's not the old chief's son-in-law. Dibble escapes to pass this to Top Cat's gang, but Trixie is captured by the police robots.  After Dibble tells the gang what really happened, they all head for Big Gus to help them break Top Cat out of prison, as he owes Top Cat. Big Gus leads them through an underground passage to the dog jail and leaves. The gang apologises for their doubts about Top Cat. With their cover blown by the dogs knowing they've got cats with them, the gang and Dibble escape through a sewer hole arriving at Strickland's HQ.  The gang infiltrate the building in robot guises finding Strickland has imprisoned everyone in the city and stolen the city's cash. While Dibble distracts Strickland, the gang under the guise of robots make their way to Strickland's control centre, but Top Cat's gang are locked in Strickland's vault having tripped a silent alarm, Top Cat remaining outside. When Strickland arrives, he orders Top Cat to be annihilated by the robots. As a single robot enters, Top Cat realises the whole security system was manufactured by the Maharajah of Pookajee. Top Cat takes out the Maharajah Talk 5000 which presumably controls all robots to get Strickland. In panic, Strickland self-destructs the robot army except the single one, revealed to be Fancy-Fancy still in his robot guise. Everyone imprisoned and Top Cat's gang is released in the self-destruction process. Strickland is rendered helpless and Dibble arrests him and (on Top Cat's suggestion) sentences him to the Dog Jail.  Top Cat and Trixie renew their relationship, Officer Dibble is promoted as the new Chief of Police, the gang enjoy themselves, and finally Griswald asks for a place in Top Cat's gang, which Top Cat accepts.

Tower Heist
 Josh Kovaks is the building manager of The Tower, an upscale apartment complex in [[New York City]]. Its employees include Josh's brother-in-law, [[concierge]] Charlie Gibbs, who is expecting a child with Josh's sister; Enrique Dev'Reaux, a newly hired elevator operator; Lester, the doorman nearing [[retirement]]; Odessa Montero, an immigrant maid from [[Jamaica]] threatened with deportation; and receptionist Miss Iovenko, who is studying to become a [[lawyer]].  One morning Josh witnesses what he believes is Arthur Shaw, The Tower's penthouse tenant, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw was actually attempting to flee the country and resist arrest for masterminding a [[Ponzi scheme]], embezzling $2 billion. Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts [[suicide]] by stepping in front of a train, but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when he forgets to ask if Lester is all right, and out of anger, Josh smashes the windows of the 1963 [[Ferrari 250 GT Lusso]] displayed in Shaw's apartment. Josh's boss, Mr. Simon, fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique, who were with him at the time of his actions.  Josh meets Denham at a bar where she drunkenly suggests that Shaw has concealed $20 million as a reserve, and that Josh should steal it. Josh, Charlie, Enrique, and evicted Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh conspire to find and steal the money from Shaw's assumed safe. They supplement their inexperience by enlisting Josh's childhood friend Slide, a petty criminal, and Odessa, who has locksmith experience that can help open the safe. Charlie is later rehired as the Tower's new manager, and, uncomfortable with the plan, warns Josh to abandon it or Charlie will turn him over to the police. Subsequently, Denham informs Josh that Shaw is scheduled to attend court on [[Thanksgiving]] during the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] to avoid publicity, and that Shaw will be set free. Josh and his team decide to break into Shaw's apartment during the parade.  Slide attempts to betray the team by reaching the safe first, having tricked Odessa into giving him lessons. The team intercepts him at Shaw's apartment, and during the ensuing altercation, they break down a false wall, revealing Shaw's safe, which turns out to be empty. Slide and Fitzhugh fight over Slide's gun; the gun goes off and the bullet hits the car, revealing gold underneath the Ferrari's paint. They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold, turn it into car parts, and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight. Later, Josh finds a ledger of Shaw's illegal finances in the car's glove box.  As they reach the lobby, Denham and Shaw return, revealing the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse. Denham notes the missing car and Shaw's safe and, for violating his bail by not declaring the latter, has him remanded back into federal custody until his real court date. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk outside the Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh's attorney. She shows them Shaw's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone's freedom. The FBI accepts on the condition that Josh, being the primary conspirator, must serve a minimal two-year sentence. Shaw [[guilty plea|pleads guilty]] and is sentenced to life imprisonment.  The team retrieve the car and send various parts of it to Tower employees to compensate for their lost pensions. As Josh is led to his cell, a satisfied smile slowly forms on his face.

The Tragedy of Man (film)
 [[God]] creates the universe. [[Lucifer]] mocks God for the shortcomings of humanity, which he predicts will soon aspire to become God. As the primaeval spirit of negation, he claims to be as old as God and demands his share of the world, which he is granted in the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] and the Tree of Immortality.  Lucifer tempts [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] eat the [[forbidden fruit]]. Expelled from the [[Garden of Eden]] and abandoned by God, Adam reasons that he is no longer obliged to show God any gratitude. He decides to live from his own strength alone. Lucifer offers Adam to experience his own future, and takes him from the Stone Age into the future, throughout human history.  In [[ancient Egypt]], Adam is [[Pharaoh Djoser]] in 2650 BC who falls in love with Eve in the form of a slave woman. Adam abolishes slavery, but Lucifer argues that it would be futile, as history would prove. Adam is taken to [[ancient Greece]], where [[democracy]] has resulted in corruption and foul political play. Adam appears as [[Miltiades]] in 489 BC and is sentenced to death after the masses have been agitated against him. Disillusioned, Adam is taken to [[ancient Rome]] in 67 AD where he and Lucifer enjoy themselves with [[gladiator]] games and prostitutes. As decadence makes the civilization fall apart, Adam and Eve encounter [[Saint Peter]] and then [[Jesus]], and turn to God, who gives them a message of love and fraternity. Adam becomes [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee]] in 1096 AD but is disgusted by the [[East–West Schism]] and pettiness within the church. He falls in love with Eve who is locked inside a monastery.  Adam is then [[Johannes Kepler]] in Prague, 1608. He seeks eternal wisdom by studying the physical world while his wife is unfaithful. Adam becomes [[Georges Danton]] during the [[French Revolution]] in Paris, 1794. Eve appears as an aristocrat who is [[guillotine]]d and as a prostitute who revels in the revolutionary terror. Danton is eventually put before the [[National Convention]] and executed for conspiring with the aristocracy. Once again in the body of Kepler, Adam wakes up from a dream. He recognizes that ideas are more powerful and long-lasting than individual men. Adam and Lucifer visit Victorian London in 1897 as unnamed Englishmen, which Adam initially finds impressive but Lucifer argues is decayed on a spiritual level, as everything has become a commodity. Adam tries to court Eve and is eventually able to seduce her, right after [[World War I]], with the help of jewels and a Gypsy fortune teller. When social unrest erupts in the 20th century, Adam wishes for a society ruled after scientific principles for the common good.  Lucifer brings Adam to a future [[Egalitarianism|egalitarianist]] [[World government|world state]]. Although initially positive, Adam immediately regrets the disappearance of nations, as he thinks people should have a past and an identity to hold on to. Animals and plants which are not useful are extinct and the useful ones have been genetically modified. Adam questions the [[Materialism|materialist]] worldview and is arrested for criminal thinking. Eve appears as a mother who is punished for refusing to let society educate her child. Adam and Lucifer travel further to a dehumanized future in space. Adam is at first unsettled, but when the spirit of Earth urges him to return, he proclaims that his spirit can live beyond the body. On the verge of annihilation, Adam changes his mind and promises to keep striving on Earth. He accepts mortality and man's struggle.  In a distant [[ice age]], the last remains of humanity are dying. The few people Adam encounters are deformed savages. Lucifer argues that they do not differ in nature from humans of any other era.  Adam wakes up in his cave 50,000 BC. He joins Lucifer on a cliff, where he argues for the existence of [[free will]], while Lucifer reminds him of the futility of human ambition. Adam argues that he can still go against God by committing suicide. As he is about to leap from the cliff, Eve finds him and tells him that she is pregnant. God urges Adam to keep having faith. Adam decides to follow God's word and accepts struggle as an end in itself.  
The Tree of Life (film)
 The film begins with a quotation from the [[Book of Job]]: "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"  A mysterious, wavering light, resembling a flame, flickers in the darkness. Mrs. O'Brien recalls a lesson taught to her that people must choose to follow either the path of [[Divine grace|grace]] or the path of nature. In the 1960s or thereabouts, she receives a telegram informing her of the death of her son, R.L., aged nineteen. Mr. O'Brien is notified by telephone while at an airport. The family is thrown into turmoil.  In the present day, the O'Briens' eldest son, Jack, is adrift in his modern life as an architect. One day he apologizes to his father on the phone for something he said about R.L.'s death. In his office, Jack begins reflecting; shots of tall buildings under the sky, Jack wandering in the desert, trees that stretch from the ground up to the sun high in their leaves, and scenes from his 1950s childhood all link together and lead back to the flame.  From the darkness the [[universe]] is born, the [[Milky Way]] and then the [[solar system]] form while voice-overs ask existential questions. On the [[History of the Earth|newly formed]] [[Earth]], volcanoes erupt and microbes begin to form and replicate. Sea life is born, then plants on land, then dinosaurs.<ref></ref> In a symbolic first act of [[compassion]], a dinosaur chooses not to eat a weakened creature that is lying on the side of a river bed.  An asteroid tumbles through space and strikes the Earth, causing the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].  In a sprawling suburban neighborhood in the American South live the O'Briens. The young couple is enthralled by their new baby Jack and, later, his two brothers. When Jack reaches adolescence, he is faced with the conflict of accepting the way of grace or nature, as embodied by each of his parents. Mrs. O'Brien is gentle, [[Nurturant parent model|nurturing]], and authoritative, presenting the world to her children as a place of wonder. Mr. O'Brien is [[Strict father model|strict]] and authoritarian, and easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons with wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative. He laments his decision to work in a power plant instead of pursuing his passion for music. He tries to get ahead by filing patents for various inventions.  Jack's perceptions of the world begin to change after one of his boyhood companions drowns at the pool and another is burned in a house fire. He becomes angry at his father for his bullying behavior and begins to keep a running tally of Mr. O'Brien's various hypocrisies and misdeeds, lashing out at his mother for tolerating such abusive behavior.  One summer, Mr. O'Brien takes a long business trip. While he is away, the boys enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and [[animal abuse]]. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating to work in an inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.  In the present, adult Jack leaves work. Riding the elevator up, he experiences a vision of following a young girl across rocky terrain. Jack tentatively walks through a wooden door frame erected on the rocks and sees a view of the far distant future in which the [[sun]] expands into a [[red giant]], engulfing the earth and then shrinking into a feeble [[white dwarf]]. Someone says "follow me" in the darkness, which is ended by the lighting of two candles. After emerging from rustic doors, Jack follows the girl and then a young version of himself across surreal landscapes. On a sandbar, Jack sees images of death and the dead returning to life. He is reunited with his family and all the people who populate his memory. His father is happy to see him. He encounters his dead brother, whom he brings to his parents. The parents are then seen saying goodbye to the young brother as he steps out of a home into a vast expanse. Accompanied by a woman in white and a young woman, Mrs. O'Brien looks to the sky and whispers, "I give him to you. I give you my son."  Jack's vision ends and he leaves the building smiling, while nature returns to the surrounding buildings as the sky is reflected in them.  The mysterious wavering light continues to flicker in the darkness.  
Transformers: Dark of the Moon
  In 1961, the "[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]", a [[Cybertron]]ian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between the benevolent [[Autobots]] and the malevolent [[Decepticons]], crash lands on the [[Far side of the Moon|dark side of Earth's Moon]]. The crash is detected on Earth by [[NASA]], and President [[John F. Kennedy]] authorizes a mission to put a man on the [[Moon]] as a cover for investigating the spacecraft. In 1969, the crew of [[Apollo 11]] lands on the Moon.  In the present, the Autobots assist the United States military in preventing major conflicts around the globe. During a mission to [[Chernobyl]] to investigate suspected alien technology, [[Optimus Prime]] finds a fuel cell from the "Ark", discovering that it had survived its journey from Cybertron. The Autobots are then attacked by a giant Cybertronian worm called the Driller and his master [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], a Decepticon scientist, who manages to escape. After learning of the top-secret mission to the Moon, the Autobots travel there to explore the "Ark". They discover a comatose [[Sentinel Prime]] – Optimus' predecessor as leader of the Autobots – and five Pillars he created as a means of establishing a [[Space Bridge]] between two points to teleport matter. After returning to Earth, Optimus uses the energy of his [[Matrix of Leadership]] to revive Sentinel Prime.  Meanwhile, [[Sam Witwicky]] is frustrated that he is unable to work with the Autobots or find a job. He also becomes envious of the close relationship between his new girlfriend, [[Carly Spencer]], and her boss [[Dylan Gould]]. After finding work, Sam is provided information by his eccentric co-worker Jerry Wang about the "Ark", before Jerry is assassinated by the Decepticon [[Laserbeak]]. Sam contacts the now independently wealthy Sector 7 Agent Seymour Simmons, and together they realize that the Decepticons and their leader, [[Megatron]], are murdering people connected to the American and Russian space missions to the "Ark". They locate two surviving Russian cosmonauts, who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the "Ark" long before the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find, as Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars and the Decepticons lacked the means to revive him. The Autobots fight off three pursuing Decepticons: the Dreads, and rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot [[Ironhide]], revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertron's survival.   Sentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Dylan, who is revealed to be in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by [[Starscream]], seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade Chicago as their agents place Pillars around the world. Gould reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld of Cybertron to the Solar System, then to enslave humanity and use Earth's resources to rebuild their world. Sam teams up with former [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Chief Master Sergeant|Chief]] Robert Epps and ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.   Working together, the Autobots, along with several ex-[[United States Army Rangers|Rangers]] and [[Navy SEALs]], manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, the Driller, Starscream, [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. During the battle, the Autobot Wheeljack is killed while Wheelie and Brains sneak onboard a Decepticon warship and sabotage it. Sam confronts Dylan as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Dylan into the Pillar, killing him. [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] and [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] arrive and destroy the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus' right arm and is about to execute him until Megatron, having listened to Carly, intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for his betrayal. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.  
Trespass (2011 film)
 The film opens with fast-talking businessman and [[diamond]] dealer Kyle Miller ([[Nicolas Cage]]) speaking to a client over the phone as he returns to his lavish [[mansion]] home in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], his wife Sarah ([[Nicole Kidman]]) and his teenage daughter Avery ([[Liana Liberato]]). Despite the [[Superficial charm|charming facade]], it is immediately clear that the family is dysfunctional and emotionally distant: Avery disrespects her parents and, despite being forbidden to do so, sneaks out of the house to go to a party with her friend Kendra, at the home of a guy named Jake. Sarah appears bored with life as a housewife and yearns for more in her marriage while Kyle seems to harbor a hidden aversion towards his wife. Just as Kyle is about to leave for a business transaction, the house is suddenly invaded by a gang of robbers masquerading as police.  The thieves—consisting of leader Elias ([[Ben Mendelsohn]]), his [[stripper]] girlfriend Petal ([[Jordana Spiro]]), his younger brother Jonah ([[Cam Gigandet]]), and a large intimidating man named Ty ([[Dash Mihok]])—tell Kyle and Sarah that they have been spying on them for some time and are aware of the large amounts of cash and diamonds hidden in their home. They command Kyle to open a safe hidden in the wall but, despite the threat of a [[syringe]] containing [[lethal injection]] chemicals, he defiantly refuses, believing that he and Sarah will be killed if he simply gives in to their demands. Meanwhile, Sarah recognizes Jonah through his mask. Through a series of Jonah's flashbacks and a conversation with Elias, it is strongly implied that Sarah and Jonah had a previous affair when the latter was employed as a technician to install the house's security system. Unbeknownst to Elias, Sarah secretly steals the syringe from him during this conversation.  Having left her party in disgust (after the host Jake clumsily attempted to seduce her), Avery returns home and, after a brief chase, is also captured and taken to her parents. Elias appeals to Kyle, claiming that he needs money to pay for a [[kidney transplantation]] for his dying mother and that, if Kyle refuses to comply, he will instead take one of Avery's kidneys. Sarah catches Elias off-guard and holds him hostage with the syringe. Forced into a [[Mexican standoff]], the thieves compromise by letting Avery escape in exchange for Kyle opening the safe. He does so, revealing it to be completely empty. Kyle explains that he is actually bankrupt and has no money; his house and all of his possessions were bought on loaned credit. Enraged, Elias breaks Kyle's hand and instead demands material compensation by taking Sarah's prized diamond necklace. However, Kyle reveals that this is a completely worthless [[cubic zirconia]] replica. Ty recaptures Avery from outside and brings her back into the house. Kyle volunteers for his own kidney to be taken instead of his daughter's, but Elias reveals that it was a ploy and that he hated his mother, who is already dead. Ty grows impatient after receiving a phone call and commands Elias to hurry up; Kyle realizes that the burglars are themselves being coerced into committing the heist against their will.  The thieves then separate the Miller family, with Kyle and Avery being tied up and guarded in the living room and Sarah being pursued by Jonah in the kitchen. Jonah states to Sarah that he still loves her and promises that she and Avery will be left unhurt. Meanwhile, Kyle uses a lighter to burn both his own and Avery's binds; they attempt an escape and set off the house's security system. Kyle ends up in a struggle with Ty and, despite Ty's superior strength and fighting skills, Kyle manages to inject a portion of the syringe chemicals into his arm, causing him to fall unconscious.  Thinking that Ty is dead, Elias shoots Kyle in the leg and reveals his true motives: that he is a [[drug trafficking|drug dealer]] working for an organized crime syndicate. Shortly after being given a job to sell $180,000 worth of drugs, Elias and Petal were carjacked at gunpoint and all of their shipments were promptly stolen. Faced with threats of retribution, Elias was then forced to commit a heist (under the supervision of henchman Ty) to pay off his debt. Jonah, who had previously seen the Miller residence, suggested it as a place to rob.  Avery attempts to run out of the house again but is caught by Jonah. Under the threat of her parents being killed, she is forced to answer a call from the security company and successfully convinces them to call off the police. However, a security guard shows up nevertheless, with Sarah ordered to make him leave, but the security guard catches sight of Jonah and recognises him as a colleague, prompting Jonah to shoot him in the head.  Kyle reveals to Elias that the only thing of any worth on him is his [[life insurance]]. Desperate and out of options, Elias kicks Kyle down and prepares to kill him. At the last second, Avery remembers the money she saw at the earlier party and pleads with the thieves that she can help them steal it from the party if they spare her father's life. Elias reluctantly agrees to the proposition and sends Petal to supervise Avery as she drives to the party house and ensure that she keeps her word (during a conversation between Elias and Petal it is revealed their daughter was taken into foster care). Although Avery's initial idea is to seduce Jake and then steal his money, she is horrified when Petal begins to deliriously proclaim that she plans to massacre all of the party guests and then take the cash. Seeing a swerving road ahead, Avery accelerates the car, unbuckles Petal's seat belt, and intentionally crashes into a telephone pole, incapacitating Petal and allowing Avery to handcuff Petal to the steering wheel.  Back at the Miller home, Sarah learns that Kyle had discovered a picture of her kissing Jonah from security footage and was suspicious for some time that she had been unfaithful. However, Sarah insists that she is innocent and only loves Kyle: the same flashback is now shown from her perspective, revealing that Jonah is in fact [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] (and off his medications) and that the supposed love affair between him and Sarah was all in his head. The "kiss" had occurred to Sarah's complete surprise and against her will. At this point, Ty reawakens from his stupor and attacks Sarah. Enraged, Jonah tackles Ty and the two fight. Just as Ty is about to strangle Jonah to death, Elias shoots him in the back for trying to kill his brother. However, in his dying breath, Ty reveals to Elias that he had been set up all along: the "robbers" stealing his drug shipment were actually fellow members of the same crime organization and the operation was done in order to [[blackmail]] him into stealing more money for them. More damningly, Ty also claims that Jonah had masterminded the entire plan so he could have an excuse to return to the Miller residence and profess his love to Sarah. Elias is shocked by the allegations but refuses to believe them (though doubt about his brother does seem to creep in.)  Through the chaos, Sarah and a wounded Kyle escape to the tool shed behind the house and are pursued by Elias and Jonah. After a brief fight, the thieves break through a partition in their tussling  and to their surprise discover a large amount of money that's been hidden in the shed; Kyle reveals that he had sold Sarah's real diamond necklace and was saving the money as a nest egg for his family when he noticed his business/fortunes declining. As Elias and Jonah begin to collect the cash, Avery appears (having survived the car crash with minor injuries) and points a gun at them. Elias calls her bluff and claims she can shoot but he will still have time to shoot one of her parents, he then aims his gun at Sarah - but he is shot from behind and killed by Jonah for this. Jonah tries again to convince Sarah that she belongs with him but she rebuffs his offers, calling him insane. In an attempt to sacrifice himself, Kyle tells his wife and daughter to run while setting the money in the tool shed on fire. He also shoots Jonah's foot with a [[nail gun]], trapping him in the shed. While Avery goes to call the police, Sarah tries to help Kyle but she is grabbed in a last-ditch effort by Jonah, who is convinced that it is destiny for her to die together with him in the fire. However, Kyle then shoots him in the neck, causing him to fall and become engulfed in the flames. Sarah then carries Kyle away to safety just as the shed collapses.  In the backyard, Kyle tries to tell Sarah to let him die so that she and Avery can survive on his life insurance fund but she refuses, stating that she loves him regardless of whether he has money or not. Avery runs back to her parents announcing that help is finally on the way. The three family members embrace as the real police arrive and surround the house.  
Trishna (2011 film)
 Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel ''[[Tess of the D'Urbervilles]]'', ''Trishna'' tells the story of a woman whose life is destroyed by the restrictions of social status, complications of love and life, and her development as an individual. Set in contemporary [[Rajasthan]], Trishna (Freida Pinto) meets a wealthy British businessman, Jay Singh (Riz Ahmed), who has come to India to work in his father's hotel business. He sees her dancing at a hotel, and is attracted to her beauty and innocence.  After an accident destroys her father's Jeep and leaves her family without the means to support themselves, Trishna, approached with an offer of employment from Jay, accepts and begins her work beneath him.  Jay develops feelings for Trishna, expressing them through special treatment and gifts.  She is overwhelmed by his generosity and his position of power, and does not know how to respond. After a night out with friends, Jay tracks her down and rescues her from the unwanted and escalating attentions of two men on the street. However, instead of taking her back to the servant quarters of the hotel, he stops in a wooded area and makes an advance. He rapes her, and she comes back from their encounter crying heavily.<ref>http://www.villagevoice.com/film/in-trishna-michael-winterbottom-takes-hardys-tess-to-todays-mumbai-6435541</ref> She flees the next morning back to her family. An unwanted pregnancy results from the rape, and Trishna has an abortion, hoping to put the entire episode behind her and continue in her family as if she'd never left. However, her father's shame at her pregnancy and the family's need for income means that she is sent to work for her aunt and uncle, serving her bed-bound aunt and also working in the small factory her uncle runs. To her dismay, Jay tracks her down again and seems surprised that she has not tried to contact him; due to his own abusive, self-indulgent tendencies, he views the rape as a consensual sexual experience. He offers her the opportunity to be his live-in girlfriend in Mumbai, and Trishna chooses to go with him, escaping the drudgery of factory work to start life again with Jay in the city.  In Mumbai, Trishna gets to accompany Jay to events relating to the film industry, in which he is interested in investing as a producer. She begins dance classes, and is strikingly good, but Jay refuses to allow her to pursue dancing as a career. He tries to convince her (and seems to succeed) that she does not want to be a dancer and that she is to stay at his side. Their relationship has settled into an arrangement when Jay suddenly has to leave for England, where his father is in hospital after having a stroke. Shocked by the brush with mortality, Jay feels ever closer to Trishna, and confesses having had feelings with two other women in their social circles before she moved in with him. Feeling a level of trust with her patron/boyfriend, Trishna confesses to Jay that after their first sexual encounter, she became pregnant and had an abortion. He reacts by asking her why she didn't think he had a right to know and gets progressively angry when he thinks of all the times she could have told him about it. With difficulties at their highest, Jay abandons Trishna and stops paying the lease on their apartment. Trishna – having heard nothing from Jay –- joins some of her friends from dance class in their apartment. To her surprise Jay returns to meet her, though he pretends it was all a misunderstanding and that she should have told him that the lease was not being paid. Meanwhile, she has learned from a rather greasy dance coordinator, that to begin a career as a dancer, she'd have to spend 30,000 rupees on a special card, money the dance co-ordinator offers to loan her. Stuck between going into debt with a stranger and the 'better the evil you know' Jay, she chooses to return to Jay. His father's incapacitated state means Jay has to leave the city and go back to the idyllic hotel in Rajasthan.  He offers her a job at his hotel where he promises to maintain their relationship in secret.  Due to their professional relationship, Jay treats her as a servant in public, which adds some titillating thrill to their encounters for him. But Jay's boredom, frustration, and return to an extremely dominant position exacerbates the power dynamic that already plagued their interactions. Jay's desire for control becomes ever more overt. He begins to imagine himself as the raja of this hotel that was once a castle, taking up residence in the rooms the ruler had once occupied. He becomes increasingly abusive and sexually coercive, until Trishna becomes a mere object for his exploitation. Trishna, her spirit destroyed and her hopes for opportunity in tatters, takes a kitchen knife and, while Jay is sleeping, stabs him to death as he wakes and looks at her in surprise.  Trishna escapes and returns to the village with her family, where at first she appears to be leading a normal life, but in the tragic climax Trishna finds an isolated spot and commits suicide by stabbing herself with the same kitchen knife used to kill Jay.

 The film opens with a man ([[Tom Fisher (actor)|Tom Fisher]]) sitting eating breakfast with his family. He drives away from his house to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street station]], where he boards a train; he gets off in London.

Upon her arrival, Tom is shocked to discover (unbeknownst to her) that she is the woman he saw having sex in the graveyard with another man. She is not pleased that Aidan hardly made any money that day, so she punches him in the face, then she tells him to throw Tom (who she calls [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], in reference to the character from ''[[The Addams Family]]'') out of the flat.  Tom leaves and goes to buy a cup of tea from a street vendor. He reaches for some money to pay, but his pocket is empty, so he goes back to the flat. Linda opens the door, he asks her if she has seen his money, but she says 'No', so he politely asks if he can come in and have a look around. Linda refuses and tells him to go away. As Tom walks away, Linda looks through the curtain on the door and smirks.  Tom goes back on the streets, he is seen begging various people for money. One man is kind enough to give him some change, so he uses it to buy a cup of tea from a café. While he is sitting there, the door burst open and in comes Aidan with a cat carrier. He asks the woman at the counter if he could talk to the manager about rats, hoping to release the cat to catch them (and make some cash). The manager lets him through to the back, but Tom spots the man throwing Aidan out into the back alley. Tom runs out of the shop and hears Aidan being beaten up, so he goes to investigate. He finds Aidan and tries to check if Aidan has a concussion. While they are talking, Aidan suddenly jumps up, realizing that the cat (Treacle), who belongs to one of Aidan’s elderly neighbors is missing. They go in search of the cat, eventually finding it dead... They then go to a pet shop and buy a kitten (which Aidan names Treacle Jr) and attempt to give it to the old lady who was the owner of the original cat, but she yells at them, telling them to go away, calling Aidan a 'F***** retard'.  Aidan takes Tom to a music shop where he shows him his dream drum kit that he is saving up for. As they walk away from the shop, Tom starts to get annoyed by Aidan and eventually tells him to leave him alone and takes off.  Tom is seen on the steps of the town hall, feeling depressed, he opens his wallet and takes out a picture of him with his family, when he does, a bank card falls out from behind the picture, Tom picks it up and rushes away to a cash machine.  Tom goes back to Aidan's flat, where he apologizes, Aidan accepts and Tom asks him if he can stay for a while and offers him 200 quid up from to rent the top bunk bed in Aidan's room (it is not clear how many months this money will get him, but the amount seems huge to Aidan). Aidan then tells Linda Tom is moving in and has paid 100 pounds up front (keeping 100 for himself to go towards his drumset savings), so Tom, Linda and Aidan then celebrate with a little party, Linda celebrating the income, Aidan celebrating the welcome company of a friend, Tom celebrating their acceptance, etc. During the party, when Aidan is drunk, Linda discovers that Aidan has received 200 pounds and not just the 100 he had stated earlier. She is annoyed that she didn't know about Aidan’s keeping the extra money, but also realizes that Tom is, in her own words, "Mr. Moneybags" and a possible source of easy income. She finds Tom in the Kitchen, starts acting nice to him, tries to come on to him and then masturbates him, though against Tom's wishes. Tom is upset, put off, and wordlessly leaves the kitchen to go to bed. Linda realises this maneouvre has not exactly won him over.  The next day, Aidan takes Tom to visit the [[Horniman Museum]], where they enjoy the [[natural history]] and [[musical instruments]] collections, and have fun making music in a section with instruments for the public's use.  Another day, Aidan goes to his savings account and takes out all his savings, but is spotted with the wad of money by the man Linda was having sex with in the graveyard (apparently a drug dealer, according to the movie credits, and who has possibly been following him since he left the house). As Aidan is walking home, he gets jumped from behind by the drug dealer, who steals the money Tom had given Aidan, actually all of Aidan's savings. Tom finds out what happened to Aidan and realizes from the description Aidan gives him that it was Linda's friend. Linda returns home with bags full of designer clothes. Tom then tells Aidan that Linda stole his money. Aidan shouts at Linda and she hits him and kicks him to the floor. While she is attacking him, Tom shouts "Leave him alone!", Leave him alone!", Linda tells him to shut up or she'll get one of her friends to cut his f*****g head off. Tom grabs a knife from the side and threatens Linda. He tells her that he'll kill her if she doesn't leave Aidan alone, grabbing her by the neck. In shock, Linda has an asthma attack. Aidan tries to get her inhaler, but he drops it and kicks it under the fridge, and Linda looks like she is going to choke to death as they scramble to get it back.  She recovers, but then Aidan kicks Linda out of the flat, which was apparently his, although it had seemed throughout that the flat was hers because of her domineering manner.  Final day, Aidan goes back to the music shop to see the drum kit he wants, but when he gets there, he finds out that it has been sold. Upset, Aidan goes home, finds the house empty, Tom gone and his key on the kitchen table, which makes him sit down to cry. But then he goes into his bedroom, where he finds the drum kit with a note from Tom, telling him that he bought it for him as a 'Thank you'. The film ends with Aidan happily playing the drums, Tom (we only see the view from Tom's eyes, through the camera) walks to a train platform and boards the train home.

After uttering his final words, "mutter, ich bin dumm" ("mother, I am stupid"), Nietzsche becomes mute and demented, cared for by his family until his death a decade later.  The film focuses on a pair of impoverished potato farmers, father and daughter, and their horse (stated by the narrator, literally or metaphorically, to be the same one seen by Nietzsche) apparently living in a post-apocalyptic society in which a violent wind blows unremittingly. They live out an arduous and repetitive existence defined by nihilistic despair; they often take turns sitting by the window alone. The horse is increasingly uncooperative, refusing to leave the property or eat and drink. A neighbour visits to trade some goods; he claims that the nearby town has been completely destroyed, and blames the apocalyptic scenario on both God and man. Later, a band of gypsies arrives and drains the farmers' well of water. The father decides they must abandon the farm; the two pack and depart with the horse behaving uncharacteristically well, but return home and unpack shortly after leaving for unspecified reasons. They remove the horse's reins and shut it in the barn. The world then plunges into complete darkness; the two try to light lamps but find they quickly extinguish, even the coals. The next day, the winds can no longer be heard inside the house. Now subsisting on raw potatoes, the daughter refuses to eat or talk, seemingly resigning to her fate. The father appears to follow, not finishing his potato and sitting with his daughter in silence.

The Tunnel (2011 film)
 The film is framed as a documentary, occasionally cutting away to interviews with Natasha and Steven recorded after the events.  In the midst of the drought and water shortages, the [[New South Wales]] State government has unveiled plans to recycle millions of litres of water trapped in a network of abandoned train tunnels beneath the heart of [[Sydney]]. However, the government suddenly goes cold on the plan and it does not tell the public why. There is talk of homeless people who use the tunnel as shelter going missing. This and the silence from the ministers leads a journalist Natasha, to begin an investigation into a government cover-up. She and her crew Peter ([[television producer|producer]]), Steven ([[camera operator]]) and Tangles ([[audio engineer]]) decide to investigate the story and plan to enter the tunnels themselves. After being refused entry to the tunnels by a security guard, they find an alternate entry and make their way inside. They proceed to explore the tunnels and locate various abandoned homeless squats and sections used as [[air raid shelters]] in the 1940s.  They come upon a huge underground lake and while filming, Tangles hears strange noises through the audio headphones. Later, the group heads to the room where the WWII air raid bell is. To get footage of the bell ringing, Natasha hits it, but Tangles says it is distorting the audio. He decides to take the boom-mike into an adjoining room to reduce the sound levels, leaving Peter with the headphones to listen for distortion in the bell volume. Natasha hits it again and Peter hears something very disturbing in the headphones. Tangles' audio cable is suddenly pulled through the opening, snapping and disappearing. The rest of the crew panics and goes to look for Tangles.  The scene switches to the interview, where Natasha is allowed to hear this recording for the first time. As the sound of the bell plays, screams of agony can be clearly heard before the headphone wire snaps. Upon going back to the bell room, the crew finds that all their equipment has disappeared. While searching for Tangles, they find a room blocked off by corrugated metal. Natasha places down the camera to help Peter and Steve. They get into the room and are horrified to find blood everywhere and Tangles' abandoned torch. At the entrance of the room, Natasha picks up the camera, seeing that it was not where she had left it. Reviewing the footage, it is revealed that something had picked up the camera and is stalking them.  The crew ventures through the tunnel, trying to find a way out. They hear noises of a person calling down, and come upon the security guard that had earlier refused them entry. They tell him that one of their crew has gone missing but the guard tells them to quickly follow him and get out. Something pounces on the guard as he nears a corner, dragging him out of sight. The group flees, screaming in terror through the narrow tunnels. They hide in a room and stay there until they decide the creature has gone. Trying to find a way out, they return to the underground lake. Hearing something, they extinguish all light and use the night-vision camera to look towards the sound. There, they discover the security guard, his eyes missing and whimpering in pain in the shallows of the lake. The crew watches in horror as a tall, emaciated [[humanoid]] appears behind him and murders him by brutally twisting his neck until it breaks. Natasha lets out a scream, attracting the creature's attention, and the terrified group runs.  They come to a dead-end with a barred opening into a street above them, and continue searching for an exit. At one point, the creature attempts to grab Peter. However, as Steven shines the camera's light on them, the creature immediately retreats. Steven realizes that the creature is vulnerable to light. Upon reaching another dead-end, Natasha discovers a side route. Entering this new room, they find signs of some living being, and a small pile of human flesh. The main camera loses power, causing Steve to frantically attempt to replace the battery. Just as the power switches the light on again, the creature attacks, knocking Peter and Steven to the ground. Natasha, panic-stricken, runs off with the night-vision camera. On her own, she stays in silence, but is confronted by the creature, who cracks the camera lens as it grabs at her, dragging her with the small camera still recording. Steven and Peter follow the sound of her screams and the creature's movements.  Through the night-vision camera, it is shown that Natasha is dragged back to the lake. The creature attempts to drown Natasha but before it can succeed, Steven and Peter use the light to chase it away. As Steven helps Natasha, Peter is heard screaming and challenging the creature, drawing it away from the other two. Steven manages to drag Natasha to a well-lit tunnel near a train station. They rush back and drag a badly-wounded Peter to the safety of the train platform. There, captured on [[CCTV]], Natasha begs for help. The crew ends up staying in the tunnel all night.  In the epilogue, it is stated that the coroner found that Peter died from extensive internal bleeding. Natasha resigned after the underground shoot, no longer working as a journalist. Steven still works as a news cameraman. Tangles' whereabouts remained unknown and his family are still searching for answers. The police investigation was closed due to 'contradictory evidence'.

Joseph escorts Hannah back to her house to retrieve some items, but she ends up running away, not ready to confront her husband. Hannah then goes with Joseph to Jack's wake where they sing and dance and tell tales in remembrance of Joseph's old friend. While Hannah is sleeping in the next room, Joseph decides to confront James, takes her keys and goes to her house, where he finds she had stabbed James to death, presumably after the rape. He confronts Hannah, and admits that he knows about the murder. She breaks down and reveals that James mutilated her reproductive system with a glass bottle and that she just wanted to be a mother.  A year later, it is revealed, through a letter that Joseph wrote to Hannah, that Samuel was mauled by his mother's boyfriend's dog. In retaliation, Joseph beheaded the dog with a machete for which he spent a few months in jail. He also discloses that he did not initially enter the second hand shop randomly, but on purpose, because he saw Hannah, wanted to meet her, and thought she was beautiful. He tells her after leaving jail, he quit drinking. The movie ends with Joseph walking down a path after visiting Hannah, who is in prison herself for James's killing.  
Twixt (film)
 The film follows Hall Baltimore ([[Val Kilmer]]), a-down-on-his-luck writer who specializes in novels based upon [[witch hunting]].<ref name="PI"></ref> At a book signing, he is approached by Sheriff Bobby LaGrange ([[Bruce Dern]]), an eccentric fan with two requests: that Hall read his latest work and that he also accompany him to the morgue to view the body of a recent murder victim, as Bobby believes that it would make for a great story. Hall reluctantly agrees, and at the morgue he learns that the person was murdered by a serial killer. Despite offers from Bobby, Hall opts to not look at the victim's face. At the coffee shop he learns about a local hotel that once sheltered [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. This, along with the murders and various other odd features of the town, prompt Hall to announce to his wife, Denise ([[Joanne Whalley]]), that he wants to write a piece based upon the town.  After falling asleep, Hall is shown wandering a dream-like version of the town, where he meets V ([[Elle Fanning]]), a young girl by the name of Virginia, who is nicknamed "Vampira" due to her strange teeth and braces. V tells Hall that she's a fan of his work but was unable to attend the signing due to the town's clock tower always giving seven different conflicting times. Hall attempts to persuade V to join him at the hotel for a soda, but she refuses to enter the lodging. Despite this, Hall enters the hotel and discovers that it is run by a strange and eccentric couple that talks about daylight savings and the town's history of murder. V appears in the window, only for the female hotel owner to shoo her away. V bites her, which prompts Hall to run outside after V and find her threatening a priest by saying that he "knew what [he] did". Hall continues to follow V and runs into Edgar Allan Poe ([[Ben Chaplin]]), who guides him back to town.  The next morning Hall wakes and, inspired, decides that he would like to collaborate with Bobby on his proposed story, which would center around vampires. Bobby invites Hall to his home, which contains a miniature model of a machine that would drive a stake into a vampire's heart. Hall is informed that Bobby believes that the machine would be good in the story, which he wants to name ''The Vampire Executions''. Despite Bobby's input, Hall finds himself faced with [[writer's block]] and accepts several sleeping pills from Bobby in hopes of finding further inspiration from his dreams. Hall succeeds in once again entering the dream version of the town, where he meets Poe again. A series of visions imply that V was molested by the town's priest, who takes in orphans out of fear of them joining Flamingo ([[Alden Ehrenreich]]), leader of the people across the lake, who are believed to be vampires. In the waking world Hall's world begins to unravel as several strange occurrences begin to mirror the experiences he had in the dream world, such as Bobby talking about how he believes that teenagers gathering at the town's lake are "evil" and "asking for it". This prompts Hall to look strangely at Bobby, who knocks Hall unconscious.  In the dream world Hall learns that the priest had drugged and murdered all the children in order to keep them from joining Flamingo at the lake. V managed to briefly survive, but was chased down and murdered by the priest. Ashamed of his actions, the priest hangs himself. Hall realizes that his writer's block is the result of a form of guilt over his daughter's death in a boating accident, as he had been too drunk to accompany her that morning. Working through his emotions, Hall writes a story where V survives the priest's assaults and is rescued by Flamingo. Hall wakes up in his room to find that Bobby has left. He goes to the sheriff's office, only to find that the deputy has been murdered and that Bobby has hanged himself, leaving a note that says "Guilty". Upset, Hall goes down to the morgue to look at the murder victim's face, only to discover that it is V's body and that she had been impaled with a stake. Hall removes the stake from her chest, at which point V awakens and attacks him with a new set of elongated fangs.  The screen then cuts to Hall's publisher, Sam Malkin ([[David Paymer]]), setting down a new manuscript and telling Baltimore that he loves the story (implying everything from the first dream sequence up to this point has been the manuscript itself) and sees a whole new series ahead for Baltimore that will make him more popular than ever. Post-film text reveals that the series was popular, LaGrange's murder was never solved and that Flamingo was never seen or heard from again.

Two & Two (2011 film)
  The film begins with a suited, male teacher entering a decaying, dirty classroom with twelve schoolboys. Through an intercom on the wall, the headmaster announces that there will be ongoing changes in the school, and that the students are to listen to all instructions from their teacher. The teacher then begins the lesson by writing "2 + 2 = 5" on the chalkboard. When the children protest, he immediately silences them, calling for order in the classroom. He then continuously commands the students to repeat the equation after him. One timid student raises his hand and carefully suggests that two plus two is four, not five. The teacher calmly commands him, "don't think, you don't have to think", and again reassures the students that the answer is indeed five. The teacher then demands the class to copy the incorrect equation into their notebooks. Another student stands up in protest, and adamantly shouts that the answer is four instead. The teacher angrily asks him, "who gave you permission to speak?" The student holds his ground, maintaining that two plus two is equal to four. Further attempts by the teacher to force the student to acknowledge that two plus two equals five fails. He then leaves the classroom and returns with three older students, bearing red armbands (in a similar fashion to the Soviet & Chinese Red Guard) and an army-like stature. The teacher asks the senior students for the solution to the equation, and the three answer five in perfect union. The student remains determined, and is called to the front of the room, where he is handed a piece of chalk to complete the equation, "2 + 2 = ". Clearly frustrated, the teacher tells the student that this is his last chance to give the correct answer. The three senior students suddenly raise their arms and point seemingly invisible rifles at the boy against the board, imitating an execution. The boy, after some deliberation, boldly writes "4". The teacher is visibly disappointed, and sudden gunfire is heard as blood splatters across the blackboard and the boy's body slumps, lifeless, to the ground. The rest of the class is silent, stone faces processing what they had just seen. The senior students proceed to carry out the dead boy's body, and the teacher resumes his lesson, as if nothing occurred. As the teacher continues to order the students to write down "2 + 2 = 5" in their notebooks, one student is seen scratching out "5" and replacing it with a careful "4".

Unbowed
 In 1995, an untenured professor of mathematics named Kim exposes an error in the [[College Scholastic Ability Test (South Korea)|College Scholastic Ability Test]], leading to the humiliation of the professors who drafted it. A few years later, he is denied tenure and forced to resign despite the high quality of his research. Kim relocates to the [[United States]] for a time, but flies back to [[South Korea]] after the laws are amended to allow rejected professors to file [[wrongful dismissal|wrongful dismissal law-suits]].  In 2007, with his case lost and his appeal dismissed, Kim decides to confront the appeals judge at the entrance of the judge's apartment. He brings his sporting cross-bow, which he occasionally fires at a cross-bow range as a hobby. A physical struggle ensues and Kim is arrested. However, the judge, who initially appears uninjured, disappears from the scene and comes out a few minutes later with a minor puncture in his hip, and is taken to the hospital. An assault against a judge is a serious crime so the case attracts wide-spread attention.  Meanwhile, Park, a lawyer heavily in debt, is approached by Kim's wife to adopt the case, but the latter changes her mind when she notices that Park is an alcoholic. Kim's trial proceeds with a different lawyer but Kim pleads [[No Contest]] in response to the trial judge's apparent prejudice and dishonesty. Now in prison, Kim files for appeal and hires Park on the advice of Jang, a journal-ist. To Park's amazement, Kim has extensively studied the law on his own and frequently argues over how to present the case. As the appeals hearings continue, Kim repeatedly confronts the judge and prosecutor over their signs of dishonesty, and cites relevant laws and passages of the constitution which they have violated. With Park and Jang's assistance, he also points out several loop-holes in the prosecutor's evidence and the victim's testimony.  The appeals judge resigns rather than show favor to Kim's side. He is replaced by another appeals judge who does everything possible to obstruct the proceedings and protect the prosecutor, even though it is clear at this point that Kim never shot the victim. Rather, the victim stabbed himself minutes after Kim's arrest, and his family members procured the blood-stained clothes well after he was taken to the hospital. This also explains why the police never found the arrow which punctured the victim. Some citizens begin to riot and protest for Kim's innocence, while on the other hand, a judge's association demands the opposite verdict. Park, who gives up hope, decides to pour water on the appeal's judge as a protest, which would lead to his own imprisonment, but Jang confiscates the water bottles. Around this time, Kim is raped during the night by another male inmate.  The appeal is denied but Kim is given the more lenient sentence of 4 years as opposed to 10. While in prison, he continues to cite the law and to argue with the prison guards, and upon his release becomes a life-long activist for judicial transparency.

Underworld: Endless War
  ===Part I=== In 1890, [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] is in Paris, investigating reports of three Lycan brothers, who, as [[Werewolf|werewolves]] terrorize the area, but in human form, are posing as [[lord]]s, and have claimed a [[castle]]/[[mansion]] as their-own.  Selene has been dispatched to investigate the reports, eliminate these self-styled "''Lords of the [[Crescent]] [[Will (philosophy)|Will]]s''", and secure the mansion for the Paris branch of the [[Old World]] [[Vampire]] [[Coven]]. From a perch up in the [[Belfry (architecture)|belfry]] of a high building, Selene sights one of the brothers, Darius, the oldest. She receives a scroll, (via messenger bat), with likenesses of all three brothers and the layout of their mansion, and Selene realizes the reason that Kraven and higher-ups want the castle is to put the balance of power in the area in favor of the Vampires.  Determined to exterminate the self-styles Lycan Lords, Selene makes her way after the oldest brother.  Arriving at the mansion first, the oldest Lycan informs his brothers, twins Vregis and Krandrill, that a Death Dealer has found them, and that they must leave at once. But they both do not take this seriously, and, against their brother's warnings, insist that they kill the Death Dealer first. Together, all three brothers try to ambush Selene down in the [[Sewerage|sewers]], thinking that, it being three-against-one, they have her at a disadvantage. Selene, however, proves to be more than they had estimated; she cuts-off half of one of the two younger brothers' ears, and then, with a pair of [[sword]]s, mortally wounds the oldest brother, who then sacrifices himself to [[human shield|shield]] his brothers against Selene's gunfire. The younger two brothers flee while Selene finishes-off the oldest Lycan brother. As they leave the [[estate (land)|estate]] via [[rowing boat]], they vow revenge against the Death Dealer and the Vampires.  ===Part II=== In 1967, nearly 80-years later, Selene has returned to Paris, to investigate familier reports of the two remaining Lycan brothers, who had escaped her decades earlier. Unbeknownst to her, she is spotted in the [[street]]s of Paris by the youngest Lycan brother, Krandrill, (from the very same belfrey she had sighted his oldest brother in Part I). While he goes to inform his twin brother, Selene is giving her report to Kraven via telephone. To her disgust, Selene is informed that her presence is 'eagerly-awaited at the mansion' by Lord Clovis. Meanwhile, Krandrill arrives at the [[backroom]] of the [[Drugs|weed shop]] they've been working out off. Vregis comments that the '[[Cannabis (drug)|incense]] can only hide [them] for so-long', and Krandrill informs him that he has spotted the Death Dealer that killed Darius in Paris. Figuring that she's there as protection for Lord Clovis at the 'Crimson Moon ceremony', being held at their old mansion, they decide to crash the ceremony to lure her out, so that they can both kill her and the other Vampires, and reclaim their old home, all in one night.  Selene drives to the mansion, figuring that 'it's only a matter of time' before the two brothers will attack at the mansion, and she now has their trail. In the middle of the ceremony, the Lycan brothers crash the ceremony and [[decapitate]] Lord Clovis, before Selene jumps in after them and opens fire.  The brothers retreat to the shadows, circling, before one, (Vregis), dashes out and knocks her against a piller, causing her to drop her guns. Selene recovers, draws her sword, and dashes forward at Vregis, [[somersault]]s over his shoulder and drives the blade straight through the back of his skull. With the second brother down, Selene turns her attention towards the third brother, Krandrill, who charges at her, but she responds with her last weapon, a [[shuriken]], severing his left [[arm]] clean off. As he flees, Selene comments that it is only a matter of time before he'll 'join [his] brothers in [[hell]]'.  ===Part III=== In 2012, a few years after the deaths of [[Alexander Corvinus]] and [[Kraven (Underworld)|Kraven]], Selene has returned to Paris with the intention of finishing off the last Lycan brother once and for all (Krandrill having deliberately brought attention to himself), and she has brought [[Michael Corvin|Michael]] with her to help. Since Alexander's death, [[human]]ity has caught on to the existence of vampires and Lycanthropes, and has begun to identify and exterminate the 'Infected'. As Selene observes, a couple in a car are singled out (by an IPU ('''I'''nfected '''P'''ersons '''U'''nit) [[sniper]] stationed in the same belfry seen in Parts I & II), and tested first with [[Silver|Ag]] (silver) gas, and then with [[UV]] light, revealing them as vampires, and promptly shot. Having been lured back to Paris by Krandrill, Selene and Michael had split up in order to cover more ground; Selene is sent a picture by her contact, a female security guard at the Tati hotel, confirming Krandrill's regular presence there. Selene and Michael talk by [[smartphone]], and Michael recognizes Krandrill in the picture. He approaches the hotel as Selene makes her way to meet up with him there. Krandrill's plan, after having brought himself to Selene's attention again in the first place, is to lure Selene and Michael into an ambush with his [[harem]], where he intends to kill Michael in front of Selene, in [[retaliation]] for her slaying his older brothers.  Michael's attempt to take Krandrill by surprise is foiled when Krandrill picks up on Michael's [[scent]] first, and Michael hears [[howl]]ing, all before Selene can meet him there, as she has to deal with the IPU men (who also heard the howling). Michael crashes through the entrance, only to be taken by surprise himself by Krandrill (already in werewolf form), and his harem of [[female]] Lycans (all of whom are armed), and transforms into his [[Hybrid (Underworld)|hybrid]] form. They open fire on him after pinning him to the wall with [[grappling gun]]s, but Michael breaks free and slashes through Krandrill's harem, before being taken on by Krandrill himself. Krandrill, however, makes the same mistakes as twice-before and underestimates his enemy's strength, and is sent flying out a [[window]]. Before he starts to fall, Selene jumps down from off of the [[roof]]top and as she sends him down to street below peppers him with silver bullets. Before he dies, Krandrill gives a passing [[taunt]], that her kind is being hunted now, and that she'll soon join him and his brothers in hell, before Selene finishes him off.  In a [[voiceover]], Selene comments about the 'endless war': "''I don't feel '[[Victory]]'; [[war|this]] [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|never ends]]. (About Kandrill's Last Words)  He might be right. We ''are'' the Hunted. But as long as I have [[Michael Corvin|Him]], I'm all right. As long as we're together, I can live forever...''"

Unknown (2011 film)
 Dr. Martin Harris and his wife Liz arrive in [[Berlin]] for a [[biotechnology]] summit. At their hotel, Harris realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and takes a taxi to retrieve it. The taxi is involved in an accident and crashes into the [[Spree]], knocking him unconscious. The driver rescues him but flees the scene. Harris regains consciousness at a hospital after having been in a coma for four days.  When Harris returns to the hotel, he discovers his wife with another man who she says is her husband and declares she does not know Harris. The police are called and he attempts to call a colleague, to no avail. He writes down his schedule for the next day from memory. When he visits the office of Prof. Leo Bressler, whom he is scheduled to meet, "Dr. Harris" is already there. As Harris attempts to prove his identity, "Harris" provides identification and a family photo, both of which have his face. Overwhelmed by the [[identity crisis]], Harris falls unconscious and awakens back at the hospital. Smith, an apparent assassin sent to target Harris, kills Gretchen Erfurt, Harris's attending nurse, but Harris escapes.  Harris seeks help from Erfurt's friend, private investigator and former [[Stasi]] agent Ernst Jürgen. Harris's only clues are his father's book on botany and Gina, the taxi driver, a [[Bosnia]]n illegal who has been working at a diner since the crash. While Harris persuades her to help him, Jürgen researches Harris and the biotechnology summit, discovering it is to be attended by Prince Shada of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The prince is funding a secret project headed by Bressler, and has survived numerous assassination attempts. Jürgen suspects that the identity theft might be related.  Harris and Gina are attacked in her apartment by Smith and another assassin, Jones; they escape after Gina kills Smith. In his book, Harris finds that Liz has written a series of numbers that correspond to words found on specific pages. Using his schedule, Harris confronts Liz alone; she tells him he left his briefcase at the airport. Meanwhile, Jürgen receives Cole at his office and reveals his findings about a secret assassination group known as Section 15. Jürgen soon deduces that Cole is a former mercenary and member of the group; knowing Cole is there to kill him and with no way of escape, Jürgen commits suicide to protect Harris.  After retrieving his briefcase, Harris parts ways with Gina. When she sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, she steals a taxi and follows them. When Harris awakes, Cole explains that "Martin Harris" is just a cover name created by Harris. His head injury caused him to believe the persona was real; when Liz notified Cole of the injury, "Harris" was activated as his replacement. Gina runs over Jones before he can kill Harris, then rams Cole's van, killing him as well. After Harris finds a hidden compartment in his briefcase containing two Canadian passports, he remembers that he and Liz were in Berlin three months prior to plant a bomb in Prince Shada's suite.  Now aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Martin seeks to redeem himself by thwarting it. Hotel security immediately arrests Martin and Gina, but Martin proves his earlier visit to the hotel. After being convinced of the bomb's presence, security evacuates the hotel.  Harris realizes that Prince Shada is not Section 15's target, but rather Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn capable of surviving harsh climates. Liz accesses Bressler's laptop and steals the data; with Bressler's death and the theft of his research, billions of dollars would fall into the wrong hands. Seeing their assassination attempt has been foiled, Liz unsuccessfully attempts to disarm the bomb before it explodes. Harris kills "Harris", the last remaining Section 15 assassin, before he can murder Bressler. As Bressler announces he is giving his project to the world for free, Harris and Gina board a train together with new identities.

The Unkabogable Praybeyt Benjamin
 Benjamin "Benjie" Santos VIII ([[Vice Ganda]]) comes from a long line of warriors and soldiers. His grandfather, Benjamin Santos VI ([[Eddie Garcia]]), expects him to be in the army and to be like his ancestors who fought every battle in the country. He lives with his parents and two sisters named Jesamine (Angelie Urquico) and Anjamin (Abby Bautista).  His father, Benjamin Santos VII ([[Jimmy Santos]]), gives being a military soldier to be what he wants to be, a scientist and an inventor. Benjie's grandfather does not agree with his decision and Benjie and his immediate family were forced to leave his grandfather's house. They now live in a cramped house, where they started a new life. His father, as expected, followed what makes him happy. He invented gadgets and unique deadly weapons. Some examples are the ''Utot-gun'' (), a fan that shoots bullets, and a tiara that can potentially kill thousands of people.  A few years later they were invited to his grandfather's 75th birthday by relatives. His grandfather finds out Benjie is gay. They were asked to leave and to never show themselves again and declares them a disgrace to the Santos family.  A terrorist organization, Bandidos International starts a civil war in the Philippines and kidnaps Benjie's grandfather and other high ranking officials. A leader of the group named Abe Sayyep claims they have took over the whole country. The Philippine government introduced conscription as part of their fight against the terrorist forcing Benjie to enlist in place of his ailing father. In the camp, Benjie meets other members of his platoon. He was later introduced to his group's commander Brandon Estolas ([[Derek Ramsay]]) and became secretly infatuated with him. Benjie's group initially performs poorly in training and was in danger of being dissolved. His group decides to train at night, and show their improvement in the morning. A rival group, incensed with constantly losing to Benjie's group during training, sought to reveal Benjie's sexuality by getting Benjie drunk and filming him dancing lewdly and effeminately.  The following morning, the High-General calls Benjie because of the video, and makes him leave the army. When Benjamin was about to leave, his friends joined him to show solidarity. They left the army, and while travelling a wooded area stumbled upon the location of the Bandidos International's base by accident. They went back to camp to inform the High General but the official won't believe the group. The whole camp believed the real enemy base was in [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]], based on the army's gathered information and decided to attack there instead where they were later ambushed by hundreds of terrorists.   Meanwhile, Benjie's group returns to the enemy's real base, where they saw the terrorist's trucks with the captured forces, including Benjie's grandfather and Brandon—the group's former commander in the army. They plan to break in the enemy camp by dressing up as women to trick the guards into letting them inside their base. Once inside, the group kills many terrorists using the inventions of Benjie's father. Benjie manages to find his grandfather, Brandon, and the other generals. Benjie's grandfather thanks him and asks for forgiveness for treating him so badly. Benjie is then reunited with his group, where Abe Sayyep appears and attempts to shoot Benjie's grandfather. Benjie takes the bullet to save his grandfather resulting to his death.  In the afterlife, Benjie meets his ancestors who tells him that they are proud of him and tells him that it was not yet time for him to die.

Urumi (film)
 The executives of the multinational mining company Nirvana Group inform Krishna Das ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran]]) that his ancestral property in Kerala, leased out to a non-governmental organisation (NGO) by his late grandfather, is both rich in minerals and able to be sold because the lease period has expired. Nirvana Group offers him a large sum of money as an advance on the purchase. The NGO currently runs a tribal school on the property, which is situated inside the Kannadi Forest Range. When Krishna Das and his friend Thanseer ([[Prabhu Deva]]) come to the property, they are kidnapped by local tribal men and taken to a cave deep in the forest. There, Krishna Das meets the tribal chief Thangachan ([[Arya (actor)|Arya]]), who explains to him that he is the descendant of Chirakkal Kelu Nayanar.  In early 16th century, the [[portugal|Portuguese]] sailors under [[Vasco da Gama]] ([[Alexx O'Nell]]) captured a Muslim pilgrim ship and took all the passengers as prisoners. The general of [[Kolathunadu|Chirakkal Kingdom]] (northern Kerala), Kothuwal, sends a [[Brahmin]] negotiator and his own son, Kelu, to the captured ship to negotiate the prisoners' release. However, Vasco da Gama viciously rejects their attempt at negotiation, cutting off the negotiator's ears. He then orders that the prisoners be locked in the hold and the ship set on fire. Kothuwal storms the burning ship to rescue his son, Kelu. Although Kelu escapes, Chirakkal Kothuwal is killed during the rescue attempt.  Vavvali, a [[Tamil Muslim]] boy, takes Kelu with him to his hut, and treats him as his younger brother. Kelu crafts an [[urumi]] from the leftover ornaments of the dead women and children of the pilgrim ship. He takes an oath to one day kill Vasco da Gama.  Kelu and Vavvali are next seen as adults hunting rabbits in a forest somewhere in [[Chirakkal, Kannur|Chirakkal]]. They save the princess of Chirakkal Bala ([[Nithya Menon]]) from a group of abductors, who apparently have been organized by her cousin Bhanu Vikraman (Ankur Khanna). Under the orders of Bhanu Vikraman, Kelu and Vavvali are arrested by the Chirakkal guards and tried before Chirakkal Thampuran ([[Amole Gupte]]). In the trial, it is revealed that the two young men saved the princess' life. The king grants them an audience.  During the audience, Kelu manages to convince the king to support his quest to capture Vasco da Gama, who is scheduled to return to India as the Viceroy. They plan to conduct a secret raid and capture da&nbsp;Gama during the hanging of Balia Hasan in Arackal Fort. However, they instead capture Estêvão da Gama ([[Alexx O'Nell]]) and bring him as a prisoner to Chirakkal. In the process, Kelu comes across Princess Ayesha ([[Genelia D'Souza]]), a fiery warrior princess of Arackal Palace. With the help of Ayesha, Balia Hasan is freed from the gallows.  Back in Chirakkal, the king bestows Kelu with the honour of being the new general ("Kothuval"). Vavvali, however, is somewhat unhappy as the king neglected to acknowledge his role in the capture of Estêvão.  Princess Ayesha is among captives from a raid in Arackal, which was secretly undertaken by the Chirakkal royals in the midst of Kelu's abduction plan, and she is presented to the spoiled prince Bhanu Vikraman as a concubine. She then tries to kill the prince, but Kelu saves him. Later, Kelu helps Ayesha escape from Chirakkal. Kelu tells Vavvali that they should be planning to capture Vasco da Gama rather than spending their days in Chirakkal Palace. With Princess Ayesha, they set out to all the nearby villages and succeed in garnering support from the villagers against the Portuguese. A large number of people join with Kelu, and they prepare to attack.  Meanwhile, with the help of minister Chenichery Kurup ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]), Bhanu Vikraman conspires against his uncle and joins forces with Estêvão da Gama. He assassinates his uncle with a Portuguese pistol. Kelu returns to Chirakkal Palace to discuss with Vikraman, now king of Chirakkal, what actions to take against da Gama, but Bhanu hesitantly states that the army will no longer take orders from Kelu. Chirakkal Bala, the princess of Chirakkal, now joins with Kelu and his cohorts.  Meanwhile, da Gama (Robin Pratt), accompanied by Estêvão da Gama among others, arrives at the Chirakkal Palace. Chenichery Kurup, whom da Gama remembers at first sight, welcomes him. During the audience, Bhanu Vikraman is killed by Estêvão da Gama. As a mark of respect for his allegiance to the Portuguese crown, the empire offers Kurup the post of the Governor General of the [[Lakshadweep|Laccadives]].  The Chirakkal army, led by Angadan Nambi, attacks the rebel hideout. Rebels under Kelu, Vavvali, Ayesha and defected Chirakkal general Kaimal fight back. Soon, an Estêvão da Gama-led Portuguese unit arrives in the village as reinforcement for the Chirakkal force. The rebels manage to defeat the combined forces, but Vavvali is killed in action. The rebels now launch an attack on the Chirakkal Palace. A terrible battle ensues. The rebels are immediately put on the defensive by the Portuguese cannons. Kelu manages to breach the perimeter set up by Estêvão and enters the palace. He manages to attack da Gama but is killed by the musketeers.  After hearing the moving story of his ancestors, Krishna Das decides not to sell his land to the multinational mining corporation and instead to start a new life in Kerala.

Violeta Went to Heaven
 The film depicts Violeta del Carmen Parra Sandoval’s road to becoming considered one of Chile’s greatest folklorists and artists.  It chronicles her guitar playing at a very young age, the ambience of her musician father’s haunts, and the rural settings of southern Chile in the [[Ñuble Province]].   The film follows Parra in her project of studying Chilean folk music in order to preserve and carry forward in an original way traditional composition styles to form the genre now known as [[Nueva Canción Chilena]] (English: New Chilean music).  It shows her seeking out old musicians and asking them to sing or strum the songs they knew.   It covers her invitations abroad to Warsaw, Poland and Paris, France.  During this trip Parra also travelled through the Soviet Union and parts of Europe. The movie also portrays the events in Chile leading up to the tragic death of her baby daughter Rosita during her absence.   The film covers her tumultuous relationship with Swiss flautist, [[Gilbert Favre]] whom she met when he accompanied an anthropologist specializing in Chilean folklore to Chile.   It follows the diversification of her artistic output, including her oil painting, and mixed media tapestry called arpilleras or [[Hessian (cloth)]].   The film follows Parra and Favre's stay in Geneva and Paris, portraying her visit to [[Musée du Louvre]], which resulted in the honor of being the first Latin American woman to have a solo exhibition there.   Upon their return to South American, Favre and Parra broke up, provoked by his desire to live in Bolivia where he was part of a successful Bolivian music act, [[Los Jairas]].  Parra’s energy was invested in reviving a unique version of a [[Peña (music)|Peña]], a community center for the arts and political activism. Parra’s Peña was a tent (somewhat similar looking to a circus tent) that she set up on a 30 x 30 meter piece of land in the Parque La Quintrala, in today’s [[La Reina]] municipality of Santiago, in the area once known as la Cañada.  Her tent hosted musical spectacles and she and her children also lived on the same land. The movie chronicles her dealings with the mayor of the area at the time, Fernando Castillo Velasco, who helped her establish the site. Favre returns with his group, but declines to stay, although a once proud Parra humbly begs him to, because in the meantime he had established a life and married in Bolivia.   The film depicts the alternating atmosphere of the tent, at times, lively with artists during the day, and music and political activism at night.  Parra was the hostess, cooking beans over an open fire to share, and participating with the other artists.  At other times, however, the tent was desolate, or it was too rainy and cold to be hospitable, and Parra suffered from poverty and loneliness.   The film concludes with Parra's suicide, on 5 February 1967.

Vile (film)
  The film starts with a man on an operating table. A surgeon comes in and tortures him by cutting into his chest and pouring salt in his wound. The scene shifts to four friends, Tayler, Tony, Kai, and Nick, on a camping trip. On their way home, they stop at a gas station where an alluring stranger named Diane asks for a ride to her truck, which has run out of gas. Nick agrees, but his girlfriend Tayler is suspicious. Nick drops her off at her truck, and Diane offers to get the girls some of her perfume samples in gratitude. Diane then returns wearing a gas mask, and knocks everyone out with sleeping gas.  The friends awaken to find themselves trapped in a house with a dozen other people, one of whom has already ripped off Kai's nail. After a brief fight, Nick and Tony calm down and learn they have all been captured and the doors are locked. Everyone has a gadget inserted into his or her neck and they watch a video from a projector of a woman telling them they have 22 hours to escape. In order to do so they must inflict harm on each other using the weapons they have been supplied with.  Every bit of suffering fills up a jar and once the jar is filled, they will be able to remove the gadgets and escape. If they fail, the gadget will inject poison into their brains and kill them. One man, Julian, breaks down and removes his gadget, dying instantly. The others decide they have no choice and begin with Greg, a reporter who may know about this plan and hopes to see his son again. The group beats him and breaks off his fingernails. One girl, Tara, is especially violent and breaks his leg on the table, causing him to pass out. Deciding they cannot risk injuring each other to this extent, the group agrees to torture each person up to no higher than 6 percent of the meter in a certain order. Sam is up first, and already has many mysterious wounds. After being burned on the stomach with an iron and having some fingernails ripped out, it is Nick's turn. In attempt to make things easier for him, Tayler sneaks Nick some oxy pills; however, this slows down the meter. While Nick is semi-conscious, the group contemplates leaving Greg behind, as they will need their strength to escape. Everyone agrees except for Tony, while Tayler agrees for both herself and Nick. Next on the list is a girl named Lisa, who tries to avoid being tortured by hiding, but is dragged out by Sam and Tara. Nick eventually regains his senses, and tells Tayler that he would never have opted for the group to leave Greg behind, and that he can't understand why Tayler would. Tayler apologizes for the pills, saying she only meant to help Nick, and reveals that she is pregnant. Tara overhears this and informs the group, insisting that Tayler go anyway; Nick volunteers to go in her place.  Tara tries to stop Nick from giving the remaining pills to Greg, but Tony, fed up, knocks her out and Nick gives Greg the rest of the medication. Later on, Tony, Tayler and Kai, try to get six percent each by sticking their hands in boiling water, but Kai backs down so Tony and Tayler stick their arms in the boiling water again. Meanwhile, Tara who has regained consciousness, takes a kitchen knife and tries to kill Tony for punching her. Tony is stabbed in the shoulder and falls to the floor as the boiling water spills onto his body. Tara almost manages to stab him again, but is knocked out again by Nick. Tara regains consciousness on the torture table and immediately asks what percentage the meter is at. Tony tells her that her actions raised the meter to 48%. Tara, somewhat nervous, urges them to get her shift done quickly, but Tony reveals they will be pushing higher than the usual six percent this time. Tara starts to protest that they had voted on six percent and breaks down in tears, begging to be released. But the group took another vote while she was knocked out and decided on this instead. She desperately tries to hold them back and in the process, cuts Kai, fatally wounding her. Tony, distraught and enraged, tries to kill Tara but Nick convinces him to keep her alive. Tony agrees, but demands that he gets do what he wants to her, and the rest of the group agrees. Tony severely damages Tara's larynx with a wrench, removes some her skin with a grater and cuts her arms open with a knife. When Tara finally passes out, the meter is at 80%.  With little time left, the remaining five agree to break their collarbones at the same time. Tony is chosen to break everyone's collarbones, but can't force himself to break Tayler's. Nick instead breaks Tony's, filling the meter to 100%. The projector flashes a new message of the woman congratulating them and instructing them to place the vials in their gadgets in the door allowing them to escape. Sam kills everyone as they leave the room, though Tony has just enough time to warn Nick before Sam stabs him in the stomach. Soon only Greg and Tayler are left in the room while Nick is unable to get back in. Greg, still under the influence of the oxy pills, admits to Tayler that he knew about this cult that feels everyone deserves pain and agony, but he never believed the rumors were true. Sam is revealed to be the one who orchestrated this scenario. Nick chases Sam into the room seen at the beginning where Sam, having removed his gadget, kills Greg with a signal sent from a computer, locking Tayler up again.  Tayler tries to escape by inflicting burns on her back with a countertop grill, and hurting her already burned hand. She manages to get the meter back up to 100%. Sam, amused, admits that he was one who had suffered injuries in his life and yet survived, believing, that everyone deserves pain to be innocent. Sam then activates the device containing the poison on the back of Nick and Tayler's necks. Despite the poison, Nick is able to kill Sam with a screwdriver and takes some of the meds left in the room that counteract the poison. He also uses another device to remove the one from his neck. Nick rushes back to the room, able to see Tayler through a monitor on the screen but unable to reach her as she dies. Through heartbroken, Nick uses bolt cutters to free himself from the building and escape.  Some time later, Nick is seen in a restaurant, his injuries healed, ordering waffles and cream. As he looks out the window, Nick spots Diane hitchhiking with a redneck and goes after her, leaving money on the table. Hours later, Diane tries to offer the redneck and his wife a sample of her products, but he drives off. Diane, disappointed, heads back to her car, only to confronted by Nick, who slams her head against the car, knocking her out. Nick stuffs Diane in the back and puts on "Lethal Injection" on the radio and comments what Diane said earlier: I love this song.

Waking Madison
 [[File:SarahRoemerWakingMadison.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sarah Roemer]] as Madison Walker in Waking Madison]] There are a lot of time changes.  Madison ([[Sarah Roemer]]) lives in New Orleans. Suicidal and desperate, she meets with Dr. Elizabeth Barnes who videotapes each patient’s interviews.  Dr. Barnes interviews Madison who confides that there’s a little girl who she isn’t allowed to talk about, that someone will get mad and try to hurt her if she does. Dr. Barnes isn’t sure whom she’s referring to.  Dr. Barnes interviews Alexis who says that her priest touched her, but her mother didn’t believe her. She wore a thorny crown on her head, slit her wrists and feet and said she tried to look like Jesus.  Dr. Barnes interviews Grace who claims she was raped when she was 13 and the man killed himself. She tried to have an abortion when she was pregnant at 16, but had no money, the guy she got to do it messed up and now she is unable to have kids.  Dr. Barnes tries to interview aggressive Margaret who doesn't want to do the interview. While strapped to the floor of a padded room, Margaret says that her mom forced her to read the bible in the closet.  Madison did things she never would’ve done; had sex with strange men, smoked, taking what looked like ecstasy and fools around with women. When her landlord says Madison could pay the rent with sexual favors like before, Madison said she had no idea what he was talking about, so he got angry and ordered her to pay him with cash. She even did drugs by sticking a needle in her arm with the help of Grace.  Each patient—aside from Madison who wasn’t there—was assigned to film herself with a video camera, talking about anything, like a visual diary, Margaret refused. Madison however, locks herself in her apartment, using a video camera to document herself, similar to the girls in the mental hospital. Madison vows that if she does not have the answer to her questions and feel more at peace with her life, she will kill herself on the 30th day.  Oftentimes, Madison has various, frequent dreams; everything being upside down, a girl whose mouth is taped and one hand reaches for her, walks through the hall with dripping water and weird light bulbs. She sees a reflection of herself in the mirror and imagines herself putting her head through it, yet a second later, the glass is intact. There was also a little blonde girl.  She also has what seems to be a flashback/memory of her mom abusing her; dunking her head over and over in the tub.  One minute, Madison gets mad whenever Dr. Barnes calls her by her name, saying that her name isn’t Madison. The next minute, Madison says that she doesn’t remember what had happened just then. Madison or whomever said, “She called you. She’s going to die. She’s not real. I’m real,” and Madison went back to her old self.  Madison realizes that each girl that Dr. Barnes interviewed; Grace, Margaret and Alexis, happened to be her. She realized that she has  [[Dissociative identity disorder|dissociated personalities]]. Dr. Barnes gets a call from one of Madison’s personalities who said, “Madison will die.” This worries Dr. Barnes who goes to Madison’s house and then goes into her room, seeing the notebook that Madison mentioned that she hid under her mattress. It’s titled, “The Helper”. She flipped through it and it has drawings of each girl, their names labeled underneath; Margaret, Alexis and Grace, and even the little blonde girl she calls “The helper”.  Madison later realizes that Dr. Barnes didn’t exist either. That Dr. Barnes is a part of her like the others. Now that she realizes that, she can move on with her life and not think about killing herself like she thought of doing on the 30th day.  It isn’t often shown, but 3:15 appears on the clock, which might be when the transformations begin.  
Wake Wood
 Little Alice Daley is mauled to death by a [[German Shepherd]] dog in the yard of her father Patrick's veterinary practice. After her death, Patrick and his wife Louise, a pharmacist, move to a rural village called Wakewood, where they struggle to cope with the loss of their only child (Louise cannot have any more children). The couple's car mysteriously breaks down one evening in the middle of nowhere and they go to the nearby house of Patrick's veterinary colleague, Arthur, to seek help. There Louise witnesses Arthur leading a strange and bloody [[pagan]] ritual but refuses to say anything to Patrick. It becomes apparent that something strange is happening in town and that Arthur knows that Louise saw the ritual.  Soon afterwards a farmer, Mick O'Shea, is accidentally killed by his own bull. Horrified, Louise and Patrick, who witness the accident, plan to leave, but Arthur, who needs their skills (and presumably doesn't want Louise telling what she saw), convinces them to stay by explaining that he has a ritual that brings back the dead, but only for three days, only within the boundaries of the [[townland]], and only if the person has been dead for less than a year. This is the ritual that Louise witnessed. The couple agree to remain, excited to see their only child again.  The ritual requires a piece of the person to be resurrected, and the couple go grave-robbing, cutting off one of Alice's fingers and retrieving her necklace. The ritual also needs a fresh corpse. At Mick's wake, Arthur asks his widow, Peggy, to use his body, but she refuses, claiming there is something not right about the couple. However, Arthur persuades her by tacitly threatening her that if she refuses he will not resurrect Mick either.  The gruesome ritual goes ahead and Alice is reborn. However, Peggy is still not happy and frightens the little girl, who flees across the townland boundary. As soon as she does so, she collapses with the wounds that killed her appearing on her body. Her parents immediately take her back across the boundary and the wounds disappear. That night Arthur and other villagers come to see them, claiming that something is wrong and Alice must be sent back to her grave immediately. Patrick and Louise persuade them to allow her to stay for the final day.  However, Patrick soon realises that there is something seriously wrong with Alice. She begins killing and mutilating animals. She also tells Louise that she is pregnant, which Louise confirms with a pregnancy tester. Alice then murders Peggy and several other villagers before Patrick manages to sedate her. Her parents and the villagers carry her to the woods, where they bury her. Patrick and Louise admit that she has actually been dead for over a year, which has caused her to react in the way she has. As Louise turns to leave, Alice drags her mother down into the grave with her, the penalty for misuse of the ritual.  Sometime later, Arthur resurrects a heavily pregnant Louise. At home, Patrick and Louise talk about the unborn child. Later, in the final scene, Patrick lays out surgical tools.  
War Horse (film)
 In 1912, a teenage boy named Albert Narracott ([[Jeremy Irvine]]) from [[Devon]], [[England]], witnesses the birth of a [[Bay (horse)|bay]] [[Thoroughbred]] foal and subsequently watches with admiration the growth of the young horse. Much to the dismay of his mother Rose ([[Emily Watson]]), his father Ted buys the [[colt (horse)|colt]] at an auction, outbidding their landlord Lyons despite them needing a more suitable [[Draft horse|plough horse]] for the farm work. Albert's best friend, Andrew Easton, watches as Albert teaches his colt many things, such as to come to him when he imitates the call of an owl by blowing through his cupped hands. He names the horse Joey.  Ted carries a war injury that causes him ongoing physical and mental pain. While he cannot speak of his time in the Cavalry, Rose shows Albert his father's medals from the [[Second Boer War]] that he earned for bravery under fire. She gives Albert his father's [[Military colours, standards and guidons|regimental pennant]], telling Albert that his father felt shame over what he did during the war, and that he had thrown the flag and medals away, though Rose saved and kept them hidden. Albert does not understand why Ted would be ashamed of having fought in a war.  Against all odds and Lyons' hopes, Albert manages to train Joey and have him plough a rocky field that Ted plants with [[Turnip|turnips]]. However, a heavy downpour in 1914 destroys the turnip crops, so Ted is compelled to sell the horse to the army in order to pay his rent. Albert begs his father to return the money. Captain James Nicholls  ([[Tom Hiddleston]]) sees the boy's attachment and promises to look after the steed. Albert tries to enlist in the [[British Army|army]] but is too young, and before the captain leaves with Joey, Albert ties his father's pennant to Joey's bridle.  Joey is trained for military operations and becomes attached to Topthorn, a black horse with whom he is trained for his military role. The two horses are deployed to [[Flanders]] with a [[flying column]] under the command of Nicholls and Major Jamie Stewart ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]), but they lead a [[Charge (warfare)#Cavalry charges|cavalry charge]] through a German encampment, and the unit is mown down by [[machine gun]] fire. Nicholls is killed along with almost all his fellow cavalrymen; the Germans capture the horses.  A young German soldier called Gunther is assigned to the care of Joey and Topthorn, who are used to draw an ambulance wagon. When his 14-year-old brother Michael is sent to the front line, Gunther takes the horses and the four of them desert, hiding inside a nearby farm. The German Army soon tracks down the boys, and they are shot for desertion. However, the Germans leave without noticing Joey and Topthorn in the barn.  An orphaned French girl named Emilie, who lives at the farm with her grandfather, finds the two horses and takes care of them. German soldiers arrive and confiscate supplies from the property, even the jam that Emilie's grandfather makes, but Emilie hides the horses in her bedroom. Emilie suffers from a disease that makes her bones fragile and is not allowed to ride the horses for fear of risking injury when falling off the horse. Nonetheless, Emilie's Grandfather, for her birthday, allows her to ride Joey. She gallops the horse up the hill and runs into the Germans who then take the horses, breaking Emilie's heart. The grandfather keeps the pennant.  By 1918, Albert has enlisted and is fighting alongside Andrew in the [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|Second Battle of the Somme]], under the command of Lyons's son David. After a British charge into [[no man's land]], Albert and Andrew miraculously make it across into a deserted German trench, where a [[Chemical weapons in World War I|gas bomb]] explodes, filling the trench with poison gas.  Joey and Topthorn are used by the Germans to haul artillery up a large muddy hill, under the command of Private Friedrich Henglemann, who tries to keep the horses alive. Topthorn eventually succumbs to exhaustion and dies. Friedrich is dragged away by other German soldiers, leaving Joey to face an oncoming [[Mark IV tank]]. The horse escapes and runs into [[no man's land]], where he gets entangled in the barbed wire barriers. From their respective trenches, both British and German soldiers spot Joey in the night mist, and a British soldier named Colin, waves a white flag and tries to free the horse. Peter (Hinnerk Schönemann), a German soldier, comes over with wire cutters, and together they free Joey from the wire. The two make friendly talk on the remorseless war. They flip a coin, provided by Peter, to decide who should take the horse; Colin, who called heads, wins (Peter remarks, on seeing the coin land in the mud heads up, "Aye, that is my [[Kaiser]], and he looks none too pleased with me!") and guides Joey back to the British trench, now having made friends with Peter.  Andrew is killed by the gas attack, but Albert survives, temporarily blinded. While recuperating, he hears about the "miraculous horse" rescued from no-man's land. The army doctor instructs Sgt. Fry to put Joey down. But when Fry is about to shoot, Joey hears the owl call he learnt as a colt. Albert is led through the troops to Joey, again sounding his call, and Joey hurries to meet his long-missed friend. Albert explains that he raised Joey, and with bandages still covering his eyes, gives an exact description of the horse's markings, confirming his claim. With Joey covered in mud, the camp doctor at first dismisses Albert's statement, but he is astonished when soldiers wash away the grime, revealing the four white socks and diamond star on Joey's forehead.  World War I [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|ends]], and an order is made that the horse should be auctioned. Albert is given money collected from his fellow soldiers in order to bid for him, but bidding by a butcher exceeds that of the collection. Then a bid of £100 is entered. The bidder is an older gentleman, Emilie's grandfather, who informs the butcher that if he is bid against, he will sell his coat and bid to £110—and should he bid against him again, he will sell his farm and bid to £1,000. No other bid is placed, and the grandfather takes ownership of Joey, planning to return with him to his farm. He tells Albert that Emilie has died, and after hearing about the miracle horse, he travelled for three days to get Joey back, for the sake of his beloved granddaughter's memory.  Albert pleads for the horse with Emilie's grandfather, who at first remains unmoved. The old man is surprised, however, when the horse chooses to return to Albert, and he presents Albert with the military pennant, asking him what it is. Albert's quick recognition of the pennant convinces the grandfather that Joey is indeed his horse. He gives Joey back to Albert, saying that it's what Emilie would have wanted. Albert returns with Joey to his family's farm, where he returns the pennant to his father. The elder Narracott extends his hand to the boy, now a man and like him, a former soldier.  
W.E.
 Wally Winthrop is a lonely housewife, living in 1998 in New York City. She is neglected by her psychiatrist husband, William Winthrop and finds solace in the love story of [[Edward VIII|King Edward VIII]] and his lover, [[Wallis Simpson]]. Wally travels to the [[Sotheby's]] auction of the Windsor Estate, showcasing items used by Wallis and Edward in their lifetime, and reminisces about their relationship.  In 1930, Edward throws a party at his new home in [[Fort Belvedere, Berkshire|Fort Belvedere]], in [[Windsor Great Park]] where he meets Wallis through his mistress, [[Thelma Furness, Viscountess Furness|Lady Furness]]. The two develop a mutual attraction for each other, in spite of Wallis being married to [[Ernest Simpson]], and become lovers while Lady Furness is abroad. Wally's reminiscences are interrupted by Sotheby's guard Evgeni, who takes a liking to her. Edward and Wallis continue their love affair while touring throughout Europe, where he gives her a number of jewels and assumes the initials W.E. By the end of 1934, Edward is irretrievably besotted with Wallis. He decides to introduce Wallis to his parents, [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], but Wallis is portrayed in a bad light by Edward's sister-in-law [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]]. A distraught Wallis wants to end the relationship but Edward pacifies her.  Wally urges her husband to have a child together but he refuses and she starts [[In vitro fertilisation]]. Wally gradually becomes attracted to Evgeni and eventually goes out on a date with him. She asks Evgeni more about Edward and Wallis, while pondering on her relationship with William. After attending an auction at Sotheby's, where she spends ten thousand dollars, Wally returns home to a drunken, confrontational William. He beats Wally, leaving her badly injured on the floor.  The government of Great Britain and the Dominions refuse to recognise the relationship of Edward and Wallis, since she is a divorcée and so on the night of December 11, 1936, Edward makes a broadcast to the nation and the Empire, explaining his decision to [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicate]] the throne to his brother [[George VI|Bertie]]. He says, "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love." Wallis, who has fled to Villa Lou Viei, near Cannes, hears of this and has no choice other than to join Edward.  Evgeni, who has been calling an unconscious Wally, runs to her apartment to check on her. He finds her injured on the floor, and takes her to his home in Brooklyn, offering her a place for recovery. Wally finds a new hope and direction in life. She falls in love with Evgeni, divorces William and moves on.  Through a series of letters from Wallis, kept in millionaire [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]]'s collection, Wally comes to realise that the Duchess was stuck in a relationship with Edward for the rest of her life. An imaginary monologue with Wallis shows the two women discussing the similarity of their lives, but in the end only Wally found happiness. She leaves behind her fascination with Wallis and Edward's relationship and learns from her doctor that she is pregnant.

War of the Arrows
 The film begins with two children Nam-yi and Ja-in being chased by [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo]]'s guards and saved by their father Choi Pyeong-ryung, an officer of [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon|King Gwanghae]] and a skilled archer. He sends his own children to find a place of refuge with his best friend Kim Mu-seon. As they escape crying, Ja-in begs her brother to go back to their father but their father is killed in front of Nam-yi. Nam-yi, though bitten by the guard dogs, kills them and escapes with Ja-in. Nam-yi becomes the only family Ja-in has. 13 years later Nam-yi ([[Park Hae-il]]) is now a skilled archer and hunter. He learns from Mu-seon's son Seo-goon ([[Kim Mu-yeol]]) that he and Ja-in ([[Moon Chae-won]]) plan to get married, with the approval of Mu-seon who is also Ja-in's godfather.  During the wedding, Nam-yi is up in the mountains hunting deer. He hears the rumble of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] invading forces. When Nam-yi makes it back to the village, he finds his foster father slaughtered and his sister taken away. Nam-yi then sets out to find the Qing army and take out their army with his bow, killing a great many of them, including the prince. The great commander of the Qing army, Jyuushinta ([[Ryu Seung-ryong]]) discovers the mysterious man trailing his men and taking them out one by one. Jyuushinta then sets out to find Nam-yi. Though Nam-yi is shot in the arm, he shoots back at Jyuushinta and one of his men who both fall. Nam-yi rides away to find Ja-in as he thinks that Jyuushinta is dead - but he isn't. Meanwhile, Nam-yi finds Ja-in in a field. They are about to reunite when Ja-in sees Jyuushinta aiming at Nam-yi from a cliff. But before the arrow hits, Ja-in shoots the horse and Nam-yi falls.

War of the Buttons (2011 Christophe Barratier film)
 The story takes place in March 1944 in a small French village. The children from the neighbouring villages of Longeverne and Velrans have been waging this merciless war as long as anyone can remember: the buttons of all the little prisoners' clothes are removed so that they head home almost naked, vanquished and humiliated. Consequently, this conflict is known as the "War of the Buttons." The village that collects the most buttons will be declared the winner. Meanwhile, Violette, a young Jewish girl, has caught the eye of Lebrac, the chief of the Longeverne kids.  
War of the Dead
 In a long corridor of an underground bunker, several prisoners are marching under armed guard. As they approach the door at the end of the corridor, one prisoner seizes his chance to assault a guard, but the door opens almost immediately and several [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers step through to mow down the entire group, save for one prisoner who remains standing. The guards grab him and force him through the door, where he is placed on an operating table and held down as a drip is inserted into his arm and blood pumped into his veins. He stops moving for a short time before his eyes blink open revealing his irises have become zombified-white.  Some time later, American Captain Martin Stone (Tiernan) is leading a finely-trained, elite platoon of American and Finnish soldiers along with a cameraman and his son as they are sent to attack the bunker, with no knowledge of its secrets. Underestimating their enemy's strength, they are quickly beaten back into the forest. As they try to regroup, they spy a soldier sloping towards them. Identifying him as a threat, they open fire, but as they investigate his corpse it is revealed the soldier is one of their own dead from the previous encounter, and as he springs to life a second time a number of zombies leap into action from their hiding places in the trees to further destroy the unit.  Forced to flee the battle to survive, Stone along with Finns Captain Niemi (Ahola) and Lieutenant Laakso (Leppilampi) as well as the cameraman's son (Wilson) take refuge in a trench, where they encounter lone Russian soldier Kolya (Vauramo), who seems aware of the zombie presence and leads them to a house where they can shelter. They are rapidly split up and attacked, however, with Niemi being bitten and then killing the young cameraman before being gunned down by Laakso. Meanwhile, Stone finds a car in the garage before being saved by Kolya, who shows impressive hand-to-hand combat skills.  As the three survivors drive into the forest, they are attacked again by Niemi, but manage to escape him relatively easily. Stopping at another cabin, the three survivors bicker about whether to confront the supernatural threat or leave it behind, before they find Kolya's ex-girlfriend Dasha (Gorska). The four then proceed on to the bunker, where Kolya insists they can find a radio to call for help. Entering the facility, they are again split up - as Kolya finds Dasha mortally wounded, having to shoot her in the head to prevent her from turning, Laakso and Stone find the living remnants of the German garrison. As Stone stays behind to cover Laakso, the Finn is reunited with Kolya and the two find the radio room, where they call headquarters to call in an airstrike to take the bunker out for good.  Niemi appears again at the bunker and engages in a fist-fight with Stone, while the radio room is overrun by zombies and Laakso and Kolya are forced to flee. As they near the exit to the surface, Kolya is grabbed by a zombie and falls to his death, with Laakso forced to leave him as he races topside to set the signal flares for the incoming fighter-bombers. Narrowly escaping the bombs, Laakso meets up with Stone again as they surrender to the incoming Russian battalion which has been called to investigate the site, knowing their job is done.  
Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale
 ''Warriors of the Rainbow'' depicts the [[Wushe Incident]], which occurred near [[Qilai Mountain]] of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]]. Mona Rudao, a chief of Mehebu village of [[Seediq people]], led warriors fighting against the Japanese.  ===Part I=== The film begins with a hunt by a mountain river in Taiwan. Two [[Bunun people|Bunun]] men are hunting a boar, but they are attacked by a group led by young [[Mona Rudao]] of [[Seediq people]]. Mona Rudao invades the territory, kills one of them and takes away the boar.  In 1895, China cedes Taiwan to Japan via the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. The [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|Japanese invasion of Taiwan]] ends with Japan defeating Han Chinese resistance. Japanese military officials see the natives as an obstacle to the resources of Taiwan. Later a team of Japanese soldiers are attacked by natives. The attack leads to a battle between Japanese and natives, including Mona Rudao, on a cliff trail. On his way to trade with Han Chinese off the mountain, Mona Rudao also feuds with Temu Walis, a Seediq young man from Toda group. The Japanese ban people from trading with Mona Rudao, and collaborate with a group of Bunun to get Mona Rudao's men drunk and ambush them when they are asleep. After some battles (the 1902 [[Seediq people#Renzhiguan events .28.E4.BA.BA.E6.AD.A2.E9.97.9C.E4.BA.8B.E4.BB.B6.29 1902|人止關]] and 1903 [[Seediq people#Zimeiyuan incident .E5.A7.8A.E5.A6.B9.E5.8E.9F.E4.BA.8B.E4.BB.B6 1903|姊妹原]]),<ref></ref> Rudao Luhe, Mona Rudao's father, is injured. Their village, Mahebu, and neighboring villages fall under the control of the Japanese.  Twenty years pass. Mahebu and other villages are forced to abolish the custom of keeping the heads they have hunted. Men are subject to low-wage [[logging]] jobs and prohibited from owning guns, and from traditional animal and human hunting. Women work in houses of the Japanese and give up the traditional weaving work. Children, including Pawan Nawi, attend school in Wushe village. Men buy alcohol and medicine from a grocery owned by a Han man, who the men hold a grudge against as they are now in debt. Above all, they are forbidden to tattoo their faces, because to earn that tattoo the young men must kill an enemy and take their head. The tattoo is believed to be the requirement for Seediq people to "go to the other side across the Rainbow Bridge" after death. There are also young people such as Dakis Nomin, Dakis Nawi, Obing Nawi and Obing Tadao, who adopt Japanese names, education and life style and attempt to work and live among Japanese. The Japanese, except a few, are not aware of the tension.  In late autumn of 1930, the village of Mona Rudao holds a wedding for a young couple. Mona Rudao goes hunting for the wedding and quarrels for hunting ground with Temu Walis, who is hunting with Japanese policeman, Kojima Genji, and his son. At the wedding, Yoshimura, a newly appointed and nervous Japanese policeman, inspects the village. Mona Rudao's first son, Tado Mona, offers to share his homebrewed [[millet wine]] with Yoshimura, but Yoshimura considers the beer unsanitary as it is fermented with saliva, and Tado Mona's hands are also covered in blood from an animal he has just slaughtered. A fight with Tado Mona and his brother Baso Mona ensues. The fight is stopped, but Yoshimura fears for his life and threatens to punish the whole village. Later Mona Rudao tries to mend relations with Yoshimura, who refuses to accept the apology. Young men, including Piho Sapo from Hogo village, see the mass punishment as unacceptable and urge Mona Rudao to start war with the Japanese. Mona Rudao tells them that it is impossible to win, but accepts that the war is unavoidable and decides to fight.  In a few days Mona Rudao calls on villages with pacts to join forces. They schedule to attack the Japanese on October 27, when Japanese will attend a sports game (in memory of [[Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa]]) and gather on the schoolyard of the Wushe Village. The women, including Mona Rudao's first daughter, Mahung Mona, know the men are planning for a war and are saddened by the prospect.  Dakis Nomin, a young man who adopted the Japanese name Hanaoka Ichiro and became a police officer, notices that Mona Rudao is preparing for war. He comes to a waterfall and tries to persuade Mona Rudao not to start the war, instead Mona Rudao persuades him to collaborate. After Dakis Nomin leaves, Mona Rudao sings with the ghost of Rudao Luhe and determines to start the war. In the night before, Mahung Mona tries to seduce her husband, which would break a tribal rule and prohibit him from going to war the next day. The natives attack the police outposts. Mona Rudao then rallies young men from village to village, and at last chief Tadao Nogan of Hogo village agrees to join Mona Rudao.<ref name="luoluo">(Chinese) 愛鋼鍊的洛洛。[http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/jw!1PtNF8OBBRKq.m9kWbj4OCJb/article?mid=2232 賽德克巴萊之荷歌社頭目 塔道諾幹.....巴蘭社頭目寫了半個月 這次希望能不要超過....]。YAHOO!奇摩部落格。04:34 AM 2011/12/25。</ref> Everyone is clear about the outcome of the war: the death of the native warriors is certain, but they are willing to fight anyway, because only a warrior with blood on his hand can enter the "land of their ancestors". The combined warriors decide to rather fight and die in honour, rather than live in shame.  On October 27 the attack takes place as scheduled, with the killing of all Japanese men, women, and children. Pawan Nawi and other boys kill their Japanese teacher and his family. Obing Nawi, a woman who wears Japanese clothes, is spared only because her husband Dakis Nomin covers her with a native cloth. Obing Tadao, who is daughter of chief Tadao Nogan and who also wears Japanese clothes, survives by hiding in a storage room. Han people such as the grocer are spared during the attack. Native people attack a police station and take the guns found in the building. One Japanese police officer escapes and tells the outside world about the attack.

Warrior (2011 film)
 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Tommy Riordan ([[Tom Hardy]]) visits his father, Paddy Conlon ([[Nick Nolte]]), a [[recovering alcoholic]] who has returned to his Catholic faith. Tommy had to run away from Paddy with his dying mother when he was just a boy due to Paddy having previously been an abusive alcoholic, and has never quite forgiven him. Paddy tries to convince him that he has changed, but to no avail. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where, in less than 1 minute, he beats unconscious a professional fighter named Pete "Mad Dog" Grimes ([[Erik Apple]]), in a fight which is filmed via a cell phone's video camera and later uploaded to the Internet, where it goes [[viral video|viral]]. Tommy learns about a winner-takes-all [[mixed martial arts]] tournament called Sparta in which the winner will receive $5,000,000. Tommy asks his father to help him train for the tournament, but only under the condition that Paddy does not try to reconcile their relationship.  Meanwhile, Tommy's older brother, Brendan ([[Joel Edgerton]]), a high school physics teacher and former MMA fighter, is struggling to provide for his wife Tess ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) and two daughters. He had to mortgage his house to pay for his younger daughter's [[open heart surgery]], and is now in danger of losing everything. To increase his income, Brendan battles amateur fighters for money. Rumors of Brendan's secret life spread around the school, and the superintendent suspends him without pay. Later that night, Paddy comes over to meet up with Brendan in his driveway to try to reconcile with him, but to no avail. Before Paddy leaves, he tells Brendan that Tommy is back in town. Left with no other option, Brendan seeks the training of old friend Frank Campana ([[Frank Grillo]]) and begins competing in smaller venue fights. After the fighter Frank planned to enter into the Sparta tournament is injured, Brendan convinces Frank to enter him as a replacement.   After arriving at the tournament, Brendan discovers that Tommy has also entered. It is revealed that Tommy is still angry at Brendan for staying behind for Tess when Tommy and their mother left Paddy; Tommy was left to care for their mother when she became [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. Brendan claims that he could not help having been in love with Tess and that he has forgiven his father for the wrong he has done, but Tommy is unconvinced.  Meanwhile, the video of Tommy beating "Mad Dog" attracts the attention of a Marine whose life Tommy saved in Iraq. The Marine tells the press about Tommy's heroism, and Tommy becomes a national hero. However, Tommy's records surface from the Corps and reveal that he [[desertion|deserted]] the military after his entire unit was killed in a [[friendly fire]] bombing. Tommy had been using his mother's maiden name as his own surname in order to evade arrest for his desertion. He reveals to have pledged to give his winnings to the widow of one of his fallen friends. The military police will take him into custody after the tournament is over.  Over two nights, Brendan and Tommy have contrasting fortunes: Tommy quickly and brutally [[knockout|knocks out]] opponents, while Brendan is outmatched physically but utilizes [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] to force grappling [[submission (combat sport)|submissions]].  In the semi-final match, Brendan is matched up with undefeated Russian wrestler Koba ([[Kurt Angle]]), who dominates him in two rounds. In round three, Brendan swings for the fences, making the bout a back and forth battle. In the closing moments of the final round, Koba takes Brendan's back from the [[clinch fighting|clinch]] and Brendan goes for a rolling [[kneebar]]. As Koba attempts to escape the position, Brendan quickly reverses and readjusts the kneebar narrowly winning by submission. Tommy meets Mad Dog Grimes in the semifinals, and Tommy once again knocks him unconscious almost immediately.  The night before the final day, Paddy attempts to talk to Tommy about his actions in Iraq. Tommy angrily dismisses his father, who relapses and starts drinking again. Seeing his terrible pain, Tommy calms and comforts him. In the end the brothers are the last fighters remaining in the tournament, and despite Brendan's desire to reconcile, Tommy shows no interest in doing so. Tommy wins the first two rounds, but Brendan eventually dislocates Tommy's shoulder with an [[omoplata]] arm-lock. As the fourth round starts, Brendan insists Tommy give up as Tommy only has use of one arm. As Tommy continues trying to knock Brendan out, Brendan unloads a barrage of strikes trying to end the fight. Tommy goads Brendan to continue hitting him as the fourth round ends. At the start of Round 5, Brendan refuses to fight, but Tommy persists. Brendan realizes he has to force him to submit, and he traps Tommy in a [[rear naked choke]]. As they struggle on the canvas, Brendan apologizes to Tommy and tells him that he loves him. After some hesitation Tommy submits. The reconciled brothers exit the ring as their father looks on smiling.

Water for Elephants (film)
 Charlie O'Brien, Circus Vargas' owner, encounters an elderly man named Jacob Jankowski, who is separated from his [[nursing home]] group. The two strike up a conversation and Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time, equal in seriousness to the 1944 [[Hartford circus fire]] and the [[Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck]].  Jankowski tells his story to O'Brien, starting in 1931 when he was a 23-year-old [[veterinary medicine]] student at [[Cornell University]]. During his final exam, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident. His father has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacob's home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets a kind old man named Camel.  Jacob wakes up the next morning and discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Bros. [[circus train]]. He sees a beautiful young woman named Marlena Rosenbluth, and meets August, the circus's ringmaster, head animal trainer, and Marlena's husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and August hires Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver (a show horse) has [[laminitis]].  August instructs Jacob to fix Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silver's suffering and takes it upon himself to tell Marlena and shoots Silver.  August is furious with Jacob's decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him off the moving train — telling him that an animal's suffering is nothing compared to a man's, and that Jacob must carry out all of August's future orders if he wishes to keep his job.  August eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silver's replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.  In the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her with a bullhook when she fails to follow orders. After a brutal beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands [[Polish language|Polish]] commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by August's henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.  Jacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with August's murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals' cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosie's performance.  Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos and August attacks him. When Marlena tries to stop August from beating Jacob, he turns his fury on her and chokes her, while one of August's henchmen beats Jacob. Wade and Grady, two of Jacob's best friends and one of the circus workers save Jacob and he sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with an iron stake, killing him. As a result, Benzini Bros. is officially shut down, and no one is charged with releasing the animals.   Back in the present, Jacob explains to O'Brien in flashbacks that he returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several horses and Rosie, and got jobs with the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]]. Jacob worked as a veterinarian and she continued to perform with Rosie. They married, had children and kept Rosie until her death. He took on a job as a vet at the Albany Zoo and after more children and many happy years together Marlena died.   O'Brien then asks Jacob to work as the ticket taker, to which Jacob agrees.  
We Bought a Zoo
 Benjamin Mee is still grieving the loss of his wife Katherine and dealing with the expulsion of his 14-year-old son, Dylan, from school, and decides to make a fresh start by buying a new house. He tours many houses with his 7-year-old daughter, Rosie, and his realtor, Mr. Stevens, but finds none he likes until his daughter finds a listing with what seems like the perfect house. They drive to an old large house and Benjamin inspects the property, telling his realtor it is perfect. When they hear a lion roar, Stevens explains that the house comes with a zoo in the back, which closed several years before; if they want the house, they must buy the zoo.  Mee eventually decides to buy the zoo when he sees Rosie happily playing with the [[peafowl|peacocks]]. Dylan, however, hates the idea of moving away from his friends and retreats into his artwork which has grown more [[macabre]] since the death of his mother. Benjamin's brother, Duncan, tries to dissuade him from the purchase, but Benjamin buys it anyway. The zoo staff, led by the 28-year-old head keeper, Kelly Foster, help to start renovating the zoo with the intent to reopen it to the public. When Kelly confronts Benjamin about why he bought a zoo, knowing nothing about running one, Benjamin simply responds, "Why not?" Dylan befriends Kelly's 13-year-old [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] cousin, Lily Miska, who develops a romantic interest that Dylan is oblivious to.  A strict USDA inspector, Walter Ferris, arrives for a surprise inspection and makes a list of repairs that would cost around $100,000, which Benjamin does not have. Rhonda Blair, the zoo's accountant, gossips that Benjamin will probably sell the zoo. The workers' morale sinks, fearing the property will be sold to a buyer that will close it down.  When Lily tells Dylan that she heard his family might be leaving, he is overjoyed, which hurts her feelings. Benjamin discovers that his wife bequeathed him an investment account, with instructions to use the money wisely while listening to his heart. Duncan advises him to walk away and start over with the money, but Benjamin decides to use the money to repair the zoo. While this lifts the zoo workers' morale, Dylan is unhappy about having to stay; he confronts his father, and a heated argument ensues. They reconcile the next morning and Dylan admits he misses Lily. Benjamin gives his son advice using his favorite principle, that you only need 20 seconds of courage to achieve great things. Benjamin realizes that instead of trying to start over by forgetting his wife, he should accept that she will always be a part of him.  Prior to the grand opening of the zoo, the facility passes a very stringent inspection from Ferris, who grudgingly wishes them good luck. Dylan, following his father's advice, confesses to Lily that he loves her and she forgives him. The week prior to the opening, the worst rainstorm in 100 years is predicted to wash it out. The weather clears in time, but in the morning they are disappointed when no visitors arrive. They discover that a fallen tree has blocked the access road, with a large crowd of waiting visitors behind it. The staff help them to climb over the tree. There are so many people that they run out of tickets, forcing Benjamin and Kelly to look for more. They end up face to face in a shed, where Kelly admits to Benjamin that she is romantically interested in him and since she "can't get a handle on it", she kisses him, telling him that maybe they can do it again on [[New Year's Eve]]; Benjamin kisses her back, and tells her that he is looking forward to it.  Benjamin takes his children to the restaurant where he met their mother, explaining that it was the point where their existence became a possibility. He takes them through that day's encounter, where Benjamin worked up the nerve to talk to his future wife with "20 seconds of insane courage", and walks up to the table she was sitting. He visualizes her sitting there, and asks her why such an amazing woman would talk to someone like him. She responds, "Why not?"  
We Have a Pope (film)
 On the death of the pope, the [[conclave]] meets in [[Rome]]. Early ballots end with black smoke, since none of the main candidates reaches the quorum. After several rounds of voting, Cardinal Melville is elected, though he had not previously been considered a frontrunner.  At the moment of the public announcement, with the faithful are gathered in [[St. Peter's Square]] and the cardinal proto-deacon ready to announce the name of the new pope, the newly elected pope has a panic attack and fails to appear on the balcony.  The spokesman of the [[Holy See]] evades questions from the press and the curiosity of the outside world by reporting that the new pontiff felt the need to sequester himself in prayer and reflection before taking office, and by explaining that he will make his official appearance within a few hours. This does not happen.  In accordance with the laws of the Church, until the identity of the new pope is announced publicly, the ceremony of election is not over and no one in the conclave can leave the Vatican.  The [[College of Cardinals]], deeply concerned by the crisis and the depression from which the new pope seems to be suffering, calls in the psychoanalyst Professor Brezzi (whose role is played by director Nanni Moretti). The cardinals react to the psychoanalyst with some suspicion, but still allow him to examine the new pope. Brezzi, in the presence of the cardinals, tries to initiate a psychotherapy session which, however, fails to reveal anything to explain the depression and helplessness that plague the pontiff.  Brezzi reveals that his ex-wife is also a psychoanalyst and the newly elected pope is taken secretly to see her, but escapes his minders and runs away during a walk. Unaware of his absence, the cardinals kill time by playing games, ranging from cards to an international volleyball tournament organized by Brezzi.  The spokesman makes everyone believe that the Pope is in his quarters in prayer, and eventually the cardinals find Melville and give him another chance to announce his acceptance. Melville comes out onto the balcony claiming "I am not the leader you need", asks the crowd to pray "for  what he is about to do", and than retreats back into St. Peter's.

Weekend (2011 film)
 On a Friday night in [[Nottingham]], Russell attends a house party with friends. He assures his best friend Jamie that he will be there Sunday for his daughter's birthday. Russell leaves early, but decides to go to a gay club, alone and looking for a [[Hookup culture|hookup]]. Just before closing time he meets Glen, a student artist, and they have sex back at Russell's apartment. The next morning, Glen coaxes a hesitant Russell to speak into a voice recorder about their experience the previous night. Glen tells him this is for an art project. The more reserved Russell is taken aback by Glen's blunt discussion of sex. After Russell finishes, they exchange numbers and Glen leaves. Russell is shown writing about Glen on his laptop, evidently something he does after each of his encounters.  Russell, who works as a lifeguard, spends a lonely morning at the pool, at one point intently watching a gay couple interact. He texts Glen, who agrees to meet. The two begin to learn about each other's careers, their aspirations, and even share a bicycle ride back to Russell's flat, where they continue to discover more about each other's pasts. Glen explains that his art project seeks to explore the gap between who people truly are and who they want to be, as demonstrated by the personas they take on when hooking up with someone new for the first time. Russell reveals that he never came out to his parents because he doesn't know who they are; he grew up in a series of [[Foster care|foster homes]] with his best friend Jamie. Growing closer after their conversation, they have sex.  About to leave, Glen then discloses that he had been planning to move to [[Oregon]] the next day to attend a two-year art course. Both are visibly upset, but stay affectionate. On a whim, Glen invites him to his goodbye party at a straight bar that night, and later Russell decides to go. While Glen is getting into an argument about [[heteronormativity]] with the bar owner, Russell chats with Jill, Glen's friend and flatmate. She first tells Russell that she never got to listen to his recording; Glen had let her listen to all of his others. She then confides in Russell that she and her friends don't expect Glen to follow through with his trip to America, to the point that they've started a bet. She also discloses that Glen had been in a relationship with someone named John, who cheated on Glen repeatedly and was [[gay bashing|attacked]] at a park shortly before the relationship ended. Since then, Glen has said he "doesn't do boyfriends."  Russell and Glen leave the bar, ditching Glen's friends, and head to a nearby carnival. Glen admits he's excited to leave, as he feels like his friends here have held him back. After enjoying their time at the park, they return to Russell's apartment and smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and snort [[cocaine]].  Russell confesses that like Glen’s art project, he has been recording his experiences, albeit more privately. He reads some of his entries to Glen, at which time it is revealed that one of the men Russell had slept with had been John, Glen's ex-boyfriend. They begin to argue about the motivations for the fight for [[same-sex marriage|gay marriage]] given Glen's anti-relationship stance. Russell confronts Glen, telling him that he thinks he's only lost faith in relationships because of John. Glen rebukes him and tells him it’s not that simple, and says that while he thinks Russell would make an amazing boyfriend, he doesn't want one right now. Russell is upset and steps away to the bathroom. He returns and they reconcile, and share a tender kiss. With all that has happened, they passionately make love that night.  Now Sunday morning, they talk in bed. Russell opens up about how self-conscious he feels in public about being gay. Glen deduces that part of the reason Russell keeps a record of his encounters is because he is fascinated by how people come out. Glen then pretends to be Russell's father, and gives Russell the opportunity to finally [[Coming out|come out]]. Glen notes that he'll be leaving by train later that afternoon, while Russell has Jamie's daughter's birthday party to attend. Russell searches for the right way to say goodbye, but Glen shushes him and leaves with a kiss.  At the party, Russell makes a feeble attempt to stay interested, but he is clearly distracted. Jamie is able to persuade Russell to talk about what’s on his mind, even though they don't usually talk about this part of Russell’s life. After Russell explains his angst over the weekend's events, Jamie suggests taking Russell to the train station to see Glen off. Russell is there in time to see Glen show up at the station.  As the two wait for the train to arrive, Russell struggles to convey how much their chance encounter has meant to him. Glen stops him, just as he himself begins to hold back tears. They kiss in public, notable for the usually restrained Russell. Glen gives Russell a present (labeled "Russell the Lifeguard" because Glen had forgotten his last name), and with one last kiss, Glen leaves. Later, looking out from the window in his apartment, Russell opens the present and finds the voice recorder that Glen had used the morning after their first night. He presses play, and hears himself begin to recount what was the beginning of an unforgettable weekend.

A Wet Dream on Elm Street
  After having sex with her boyfriend, a woman is shocked when he transforms into [[Freddy Krueger]], who she mistakes for [[Edward James Olmos]]. Freddy seduces the woman with his glove, which has vibrators affixed to the fingers.  At the second annual Elm Street High School reunion, three women discuss how all their classmates have mysteriously died. The [[Sex education|sex ed]] professor appears and corrects them, explaining that their classmates fell into orgasm-induced "pleasure comas" while they slept. The professor theorizes it is the work of Freddy, a sex toy salesman who sold overpriced and shoddy merchandise. Angered by Freddy's defective products, the townspeople set him on fire, with the professor throwing the first match ("That guy sold me a crappy toy. Told me it was a [[Fleshlight]]. It turned out just to be a flashlight"). Freddy burnt from the waist up, and as he died he swore he would get his revenge on his killers through their children. The professor is dumbfounded by the girls failing to remember this (they witnessed Freddy's burning, and attended the [[block party]] celebrating the event) and warns them not to fall asleep.  At home, Betty tries to keep herself awake by watching the porno ''Dead Man Fucking'', but the video turns into one showing Freddy having sex with a female guard in a prison cell. When Freddy finishes with the guard he attacks Betty, but she wakes up. At the school, Betty tells the others about her nightmare, and the professor admits he once had a dream about Freddy ("It's not gay") where he saw Freddy's glove long enough to allow him to create a replica of it. Thinking the copy can help them find Freddy's weakness, the professor gives the glove to Kami. Kami masturbates into unconsciousness with the glove, and is rendered comatose by Freddy.  While the professor takes Kami to a hospital and Betty goes home, Denise stays behind ("If I learned anything from horror movies, it's that the psychotic fictional horror villain never goes for the hot girl in a room that's dark when she's all alone and most vulnerable"). Hearing noises coming from her old textbook, Denise flips through the pages, and sees herself and the professor having sex in them. Denise is transported into the book, and when she and the professor finish fornicating, the professor turns into Freddy, and he puts Denise into a coma.  Fed up with living in fear, Betty goes to sleep, and confronts Freddy in her dream. The two have sex, and when Freddy tries to put her into a coma afterward, Betty reveals she stole his glove's batteries ("Now all you have to turn those girls on is that burnt face, and that 1980s sweater"). With Freddy robbed of his power, Betty wakes up, wonders if it was all just a dream, and discovers her underwear is soaked through.  
What's Your Number?
 In Boston, Ally Darling ([[Anna Faris]]) is a thirty-something woman who is struggling to make better decisions with her life. Her boyfriend Rick ([[Zachary Quinto]]) breaks up with her when she asks him to attend her sister Daisy's ([[Ari Graynor]]) upcoming wedding, and she then gets laid off from her job. While taking the subway home, Ally comes across a ''Marie Claire'' magazine article entitled "What's Your Number?", which says that women who have more than twenty lovers in their lifetime have difficulty finding a husband. After making a list of all the men she slept with, she realizes that her number is nineteen, making her decide not to have sex with anyone else until she finds "the one". She then wakes up after Daisy's bachelorette party and discovers that she hooked up with her ex-boss Roger ([[Joel McHale]]).  Hoping to avoid an awkward confrontation, Ally lets her musician neighbor Colin Shea ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]) into her apartment so that Roger will leave. It turns out that Colin was only over to avoid a girl that he slept with, because he doesn't want to give the women he sees any expectations.  Ally then runs into "Disgusting Donald" ([[Chris Pratt]]), her once overweight ex-boyfriend who's now successful and good-looking, and his fiancée. She decides to track down all of her ex-boyfriends in the hope that one of them will have grown into the man she wants to marry, and therefore the number of men she has slept with will never have to increase. She gets help from Colin (who's skilled in 'digging up dirt') to find all of her exes in exchange for letting him stay in her place after his one-night stands, telling Colin to pay particular attention to one ex Jake Adams ([[Dave Annable]]), who Ally sees as 'the one that got away'.  Things do not quite work out the way she expected and Ally remembers why it didn't work out with those men in the first place, ranging from one man having stayed in the same job since their break-up to another requiring her to pretend to be British. Depressed after an unsuccessful search, Ally has a night out with Colin that culminates in the two growing closer and almost having sex. She stops him, but without a boyfriend decides to take him as her date to Daisy's wedding. Daisy and Ally's friends worry she is falling for Colin and warn her off him, reminding her of his promiscuous nature. Soon Ally is furious when she finds out that Colin had found Jake Adams' contact details after all but withheld them in the belief that they were going to become an item, and the two have a falling-out.  She successfully contacts Jake and the two begin to date again. Ally attends her sister's wedding with him while Colin and his band perform at a different wedding. During a slow-dance with Jake at the reception, Ally confesses her 'number' to Jake, and Jake, thinking she's joking, expresses disgust at the thought. Ally quickly realizes that her true feelings lie with Colin and that she and Jake are incompatible, breaking it off with him. Ally then has to run to numerous weddings before she finally finds Colin and confesses her feelings.  Waking up with Colin the next morning, Ally gets a call from an old boyfriend ([[Aziz Ansari]]) telling her that they in fact did not sleep together. Ally rejoices in the fact that Colin is indeed the 20th and last man she ever slept with.  
Where Do We Go Now?
 ''Where Do We Go Now?'' tells the story of a remote, isolated unnamed Lebanese village inhabited by both [[Lebanese Muslims|Muslims]] and [[Lebanese Christians|Christians]]. The village is surrounded by land mines and only reachable by a small bridge. As civil strife engulfs the country, the women in the village try, by various means and with varying success, to keep their men in the dark, sabotaging the village radio, then destroying the village TV.  The story begins with a boy named Roukoz, whose job – along with his cousin, Nassim – is to venture outside the village and bring back much-needed merchandise such as soap, utensils, newspapers, light bulbs. Roukoz lives with Nassim's family, and it is made clear that Nassim has lost his father. Roukoz tries to fix the church speakers, and falls off his ladder, crashing into the cross and snapping it in half. Other characters include the village mayor and his wife Yvonne (Christians), the cafe-owner Amal (played by Nadine Labaki), Rabih (the village painter and Amal's love interest) and his sister, Issam (Nassim's brother) and his wife Aida, and the village priest and the village imam.  The next day, the congregation is gathered in church to celebrate the Sunday mass; The Priest preaches about the need to fix the church, and blames the broken cross on the wind, telling churchgoers to keep their cool and that their fellow Muslims have nothing to do with it. Some time later the Imam discovers that some goats have found their way into the mosque, and urges the Muslims not to blame the Christians for what had happened. As people start to gather, however, a Muslim man blames the Christians for what has happened and a small fight ensues.  The village is slowly drawn into greater violence, but the women get along beautifully and conspire together to keep their men from fighting, even hiring Ukrainian dancers to entertain their men. But as Nassim is killed in a skirmish between Christians and Muslims while on an errand in a nearby town, the women are faced with a real test of wills. In an attempt to control the situation, they drug the men by mixing [[hashish]] inside sweet [[pastry|pastries]] and remove their weapons from the village. When the men wake up, they find all the Christian women dressed in Muslim attire, and vice versa, essentially challenging their husbands and sons to hit them first if they want sectarian violence. Nassim's funeral then goes peacefully, and the movie ends with the men looking to the women for direction.

The Whisperer in Darkness (film)
 For the first [[Act structure|two acts]], the plot follows the short story. In the third act, the protagonist, Wilmarth, uncovers an attempt by cultists to open a gateway between [[Yuggoth]] and Earth. He foils the plot with the help of Hannah, the child of one of the collaborators. His escape is unsuccessful and at the end of the film the audience discovers that Wilmarth has been narrating from a machine attached to the cylinder in which his brain now resides. This differs from the original story in which Wilmarth flees in the middle of the night and safely returns to Arkham.  According to Sean Branney on the making-of featurette "The Whisperer Behind the Scenes," Lovecraft was better at set-ups than endings. From a dramatic standpoint, Lovecraft's story brought the writers through what would be "Act Two" of a standard movie structure and felt incomplete. The character of Hannah and opening of gate to Yuggoth were introduced in order to "[make it] a good movie". Branney and Leman intended to make Wilmarth's world "more emotionally complicated" because Hannah's future caused him to be "invested in more than just himself". The characters of Wilmarth's three friends at Miskatonic University were developed from [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing characters]] created years before by Branney, Leman, and a friend. Regarding the introduction of a biplane, Leman commented, "If you have monsters that fly, you have to have a dogfight with a biplane."<ref name="BTS">''The Whisperer in Darkness.'' Dir.

The villagers of Tressock have become infertile due to the construction of Sir Lachlan's [[nuclear power]] plant. While riding a horse, Steve has sex with Lolly (Weeks), a female villager, after finding her bathing naked in a spring. Steve regrets his actions and wants to return home. During a flashback Sir Lachlan remembers a mentor (Lee) from his youth.

He attempted to do so the night before, but the spiked milk killed the Morrisons' cat. Beth attacks Beame and flees, but is captured in town. After discovering Steve's death, Beth confronts Sir Lachlan at the wicker tree. She pushes Lachlan into the structure and sets it on fire, killing Lachlan in the process.

 Bill ([[Charlie Creed-Miles]]) is released from prison on parole after serving 8 years for [[East London]] drug lord Glen ([[Andy Serkis]]). He returns to find his sons, 15-year-old Dean ([[Will Poulter]]) and 11-year-old Jimmy (Sammy Williams), have been abandoned by their mother, who moved to [[Spain]] with her boyfriend. Dean has dropped out of high school and is working on a construction site to make a living. Bill is followed to the local pub by his former friends Dickie ([[Neil Maskell]]) and Terry ([[Leo Gregory]]). They offer him another job working for Glen, but he turns it down due to his parole. Bill ends up getting drunk with his former associates and is given a bag by Terry containing an undetermined amount of cocaine. Bill is dropped round Dean and Jimmy's house by Pill and Dickie who explain to them both that Bill is their old man and he's back on the outside. Upon waking up, Dean makes it clear he doesn't want any involvement with Bill and he's to have left the house by the time he returns home from work. Bill goes to visit his parole officer Kelly ([[Olivia Williams]]), who, upon hearing that Dean and Jimmy were living by themselves, sends social services to the flat. Bill comes home and Dean forces him to stay, requistioning his drugs and putting Bill's plans to move to Scotland  and work with his friend on hold.  Bill walks Jimmy to school and meets the principal, who suspects Jimmy ditched school and broke all the school's windows. Bill lies that Jimmy went to visit his dying grandmother and the principal believes him. Jimmy and his friend Boz (Aaron Ishmael) sneak out of school and hang out with Terry and Pill ([[Iwan Rheon]]). They let Jimmy smoke pot and send him home with drugs informing him that they wish to use him as a mule to sell their supply. Jimmy naively agrees. Meanwhile, Dean attempts to start a relationship with Steph ([[Charlotte Spencer (actress)|Charlotte Spencer]]), a single mum and Pill's ex-girlfriend, who lives with her unemployed dad ([[Marc Warren]]). Bill meets Terry again and begins a friendship with his girlfriend Roxy ([[Liz White (actress)|Liz White]]). Bill begins working as a sign holder and is mocked by Terry and Dickie who continually warn him that he needs to be leaving the estate as his presence is causing problems amongst the local faces and is affecting business. Using the money earned from his new job, Bill is able to buy food for him and his sons. He begins to clean the flat and slowly bonds with his younger son, Jimmy. They fly paper aeroplanes out of their high-rise flat and play with remote control cars and Dean begins to see that his dad is trying to make amends for not being there when they needed him.  On Dean's 16th birthday, Bill goes to make a cake for him. He meets Roxy, who tells him a cake won't be a good present and offers an idea. Dean comes home from work and Bill offers to show him a surprise. He leads Dean to his bedroom, where Roxy is lying on his bed. He demands that Bill kick her out and they argue, until social services arrives to visit. Before they can check Dean's room, they decide to leave. The next day, Terry and Dickie begin cooking crack cocaine, whilst Roxy observes. Jimmy and Boz visit Terry, who gives them several bags of crack to sell. As they walk back to the estate, a police car stops and an officer talks to Boz. Panicking, Jimmy dumps the crack into the sewer and leaves without Boz. Dean asks Steph out and she invites him to her house the next night. They are hilariously interrupted by her drunk father and they both agree to see each other again. Jimmy breaks into the house unbeknownst to Steph and Dean and steals a tin of Steph's money in a feeble attempt to coerce Terry into taking pity on him for losing his drugs. Jimmy is caught by Terry, who attempts to break his hand as Roxy begs them to stop. She threatens to leave and Dickie hits her. They let Jimmy go, but threaten him and demand he will have to work off what he owes.  The next day, Roxy comes to the flat and asks Bill if she can hide with them. As Dean heads to work, he is confronted by Steph, who demands the money. He denies taking it, but she slaps him and leaves. Roxy tells Bill that Jimmy is selling drugs for Terry and his men. Bill confronts Pill and another drug dealer. As he attacks them, he sees Jimmy running away. He chases Jimmy to the top of a building, where Bill used to hide as a child, and begs him not to work for Terry. Jimmy decides to stop and goes home with Bill. Bill offers to sort out Jimmy's problems and warns him about the dangers of drug dealing  and the likelihood he will end up in prison just as he did. They return the money to Steph who asks Bill if Dean hates her. He responds jokingly; "With a passion."  Social services visit and make Bill sign a document that will put him in charge of his sons, until Dean turns 18. Upon returning her money, Steph comes over to visit and Bill suggests to Roxy and Jimmy they get Chinese whilst Dean and Steph talk. Roxy and Jimmy go into the shop, while Bill waits outside. One of Terry's men watches in a car and a young boy approaches Bill. He tells Bill that Terry wants to meet with Bill at the pub the next morning, but doesn't tell Bill that they plan to kill him. Bill agrees to visit having promised Jimmy he will sort out his problems. Bill spends the night with Roxy, Steph and his sons.   The next morning, he heads to the pub and finds Terry sitting with Dickie and Pill at a table. He orders a coke and sees more men sitting around the pub. He realises what they have done and begins to exchange insults with Terry. Discretely as Terry tells Bill what he intends to do with Jimmy, the pub's owner gives Bill a wooden club known as 'Bertha' and hides in the next room with the barmaid. Bill begins to attack Terry and his men, but is overpowered and they kick him repeatedly. Before they leave, he begins to knock most of them out leaving Dickie and Terry left. Dickie flees, whilst Terry is battered by Bill. Terry flees the pub and goes to his car, grabs a gun and storms inside. Terry attempts to shoot Bill as he's slapping Pill, but he dodges and the bullet hits the mirror behind Pill and Bill. As Terry approaches Bill and prepares to shoot him, he is struck with a baseball bat by the pub owner which stuns him and enables Bill to punch him repeatedly before leaving the pub.   Bill bumps into Jimmy outside the pub and he suggests they get moving. Jimmy buys a bottle of water, which they use to clean Bill's wounds. As they walk through the laneway, a car approaches them and stops. Jimmy grabs a wooden board and Glen comes out of the car. He confronts Bill about the attack and beating up his men to the point where Glen is worried it will make him seem like a soft touch. Bill admits he attacked Glen's men because they were getting his son and others to sell drugs on their behalf. Bill reminds Glen that he did time for him and other mobsters in jail and says he is owed credit otherwise he'll blow the whistle on them all. Glen threatens to kill Bill who laughs in his face and says he is officially out of credit and will leave his family alone, but he wants no more trouble from him. Bill and Jimmy arrive at the estate, as the police arrive. On the balcony, Roxy sees what is happening and runs downstairs with Dean and Steph.  As Dean, Roxy and Steph arrive, Bill is arrested and put in the back of the car for the assault on Terry and his gang. Bill looks out at his family, who wave goodbye to him. Before the officer drives away, Bill points out his sons and asks if the officer has any children. They drive away and Bill breaks down in tears. However, as he realises that his boys will be safe and love him, his tears fade and he begins to laugh with delight.  
White: Melody of Death
 The film opens with a girl group called "Pink Dolls" about to perform in a televised competition. They lose to the more mainstream girl group, Pure (played by [[After School (band)|After School]]) . They move into a new studio where they hope to record their next hit, and finally make it to the top. There is tension and rivalry between the four members of "Pink Dolls" - Je-ni, a singer insecure with hitting high notes, A-rang, a singer addicted to cosmetic surgery, Shin-ji, who can't sing, but is an excellent dancer, and Eun-ju, the eldest and former backup dancer who despite being the oldest, is bullied by the younger three.  Eun-ju discovers a tape entitled "White" which turns out to be an old unreleased music video that her manager thinks might have the right moves and addictive tune for the group's success. Since the rights to the song are unknown, their manager gives the okay for them to deconstruct the video for their next performance. They perform "White" on stage, becoming an overnight sensation. With success, the girls become resentful of each other, ruled by their desire to be promoted as the lead singer.  First to fall victim to the curse is Je-ni, who, after recording for the lead, is forced to take an overdose of her medication, then made to hit high notes and is found mysteriously hung in the recording booth. Next, A-rang becomes the lead but starts having allergic reactions to her makeup, then feels something claw at her eyes during a performance, falling off the stage and injuring herself. The doctors say that due to a negative reaction to her cosmetic surgery, she will be unable to perform. Finally, Shin-ji sees the ghost while filming a reality show and panics, running into a crowd of over-zealous fans and is crushed by a piece of filming equipment.  Eun-ju suspects a connection to the lead's bad luck and "White" so she asks her friend Soon-ye to dig up anything related to the song's original singer. Soon-ye tells Eun-ju that the singer from the video was a competitive girl named Jang Ye-bin who died in a studio fire 15 years ago and was blamed for the suicide of a back-up dancer. The video was never released because something went wrong with the recording. They review the tape and see that the singer's face is scarred, and come to the conclusion that Jang Ye-bin wrote the song "White", and out of jealousy the other girls damaged her face so she couldn't have the lead position. Shin-ji dies after seeing the ghost. Eun-ju is reluctant to be the lead until she can find a way to lift the curse. She believes Jang Ye-bin started the fire to kill herself, and makes an offering at Ye-bin's grave.   Now confident that the curse has been lifted, Eun-ju starts a solo career using "White"'s popularity. She undergoes a total transformation, bleaching her hair, answering to White as her name, denying ever being a back up, and taking credit for writing the song and choreography. When her former group members wake in the hospital, they see Eun-ju on the television as a full-blown celebrity, about to compete against "Pure" for the #1 song. Soon-ye is upset at Eun-ju's new selfishness. She then hears something new on the original track and discovers it isn't Ye-bin singing.  "White" was originally written by a young bullied back-up dancer whose face was disfigured by Jang Ye-bin and the rest of the dancers with acid for "standing out." The girl committed suicide by drinking bleach, and now returns to haunt and kill whoever sings "her" song, beginning with getting revenge on Ye-bin (the ghost caused the fire). Jang Ye-bin was not the author of the song, but the first victim of the curse.   Soon-ye calls Eun-ju to warn her but is hung up on. Je-ni, A-rang and Shin-ji commit suicide on air by drinking bleach. Eun-ju is assaulted by the ghost while performing "White," causing a blackout. The crowd panics and her sponsor and manager both die in the chaos. Soon-ye arrives but as Eun-ju jumps into the crowd to reach her, she trips, resulting in her being trampled to death. The film concludes with Soon-ye at the karaoke bar, disposing of Eun-ju's album, the trainee's suicide note and the original tape by setting them on fire. She believes she has finally defeated the curse, but is horrified when the karaoke machine announces the song "White", implying that the curse has not been broken and she too will die.

The Wholly Family
 Jake, a ten-year-old boy,<ref></ref> is on holiday with his bickering parents in Naples. Jake asks them to buy him a [[Pulcinella]] figure from a street stall, but they refuse. Jake's father tells him a piece of local Naples lore:<ref></ref> buying a figure for oneself will bring bad luck – good luck can be found only by stealing one. While his parents continue to argue over trivial affairs, Jake sneaks away and attempts to steal the figure. The stall holder catches Jake in the act, and directs him instead towards a series of glass [[bell jar]]s containing models of the idealised [[Holy Family]]. Before Jake can make a purchase, his mother arrives, furious at her son's disappearance. After another argument with Jake's father, the family leave to return to their hotel. The stall holder, noticing that Jake has stolen one of the figures, smiles.  Jake's parents send him to bed without dinner as punishment for sneaking away. While they argue next door, Jake produces the Pulcinella figure and places it on his bedside table. Later, a hungry Jake lies in bed, and remarks that the figure has failed to bring him good luck. Suddenly the miniature Pulcinella comes to life and hides behind Jake's lamp. A full-sized Pulcinella appears on Jake's bed and offers him a plate of spaghetti. Jake backs away and bumps into a fat Pulcinella, who shoves Jake head-first into his own stomach and sits down on the bed to enjoy some spaghetti.  Jake finds himself wandering through a dark cavern with high walls. When he discovers a dinner table, an entire troupe of Pulcinella arrive. They offer him several meals, but remove them as soon as he attempts to take a bite, telling him to save his appetite for the main course. The Pulcinella then serve Jake his parents' heads on platters. Jake is disgusted and refuses to eat. The Pulcinella ask Jake if this is not what he wanted, and wonder aloud if they have misunderstood him. Deciding to give Jake a "history lesson", the Pulcinella seize him and carry him through a misty doorway and across a bridge over a body of water. The Pulcinella force Jake to look through the glass door of a building, where he sees his parents dancing happily in their wedding attire. Jake calls out but they do not hear him. The Pulcinella begin to dance in a tight circle, squashing Jake, who suddenly finds himself lying in a bed. Jake discovers that he is in a surreal maternity ward, staffed by Pulcinella, where women lay gigantic eggs which hatch into babies. At the end of the ward, Jake finds his own parents playing with a newborn dressed in Pulcinella garb. Again Jake attempts to call out to them, but a Pulcinella stops him. Jake's parents begin to bicker over how to handle the baby. Jake's mother removes the baby's mask, revealing Jake's face. As the argument escalates, she throws the baby to the floor and begins to cry, turning to her husband for comfort.

Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)
   [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] wakes up one day to find that he is out of honey. While out searching for more, Pooh discovers that [[Eeyore]] has lost his tail. Pooh, [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]], [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]], [[Owl (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Owl]], [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]], and [[Roo]] come to the rescue while [[Tigger]] has his bouncing fun, and [[Christopher Robin]] decides to hold a contest to see who can find a replacement for Eeyore's tail. The prize for the winner is a fresh pot of honey. After many failed attempts for what would replace Eeyore's tail, Kanga suggests that they use a scarf, which unravels.  The next day, Pooh goes to visit Christopher Robin and he finds a note that says "Gon Out Bizy Back Soon" (a misspelling of "Gone Out Busy Back Soon"). Pooh is unable to read the note, so he asks for Owl's help. Owl's poor reading comprehension skills lead Pooh and his friends to believe that Christopher Robin has been abducted by a ruthless and mischievous monster they call the "Backson". Rabbit plans to trap the Backson in a pit, which they think he will fall into after following a trail of items leading to it. Meanwhile, Tigger, who wants a sidekick to help him defeat the Backson, recruits a reluctant Eeyore to be a second Tigger. He dresses up like the Backson and tries to teach Eeyore how to fight. Eeyore manages to escape from Tigger and hides underwater where he discovers an anchor.  After a failed attempt to get honey from a bee hive, Pooh's imagination combined with his hunger get the better of him which has ended up eating some mud and later, accidentally falls into the pit meant for the Backson. Rabbit, Kanga, Roo, Owl, Piglet, and Eeyore (using the anchor he found as a replacement tail) try to get him out, but fall in themselves. Piglet, who did not fall in, attempts to get Pooh and friends out of the trap (though continuously irritating Rabbit with over-interpretations of his instructions), but he runs into Tigger, who is still in his Backson outfit, and mistakes him for the actual monster. Piglet escapes from Tigger on a red balloon, which knocks some of the storybook's letters into the pit. After the chase, Tigger and Piglet fall into the trap as well, where Eeyore reminds Tigger that he, being "the only one," is "the most wonderful thing about Tiggers". Eventually, Pooh figures out how to use the fallen letters to form a ladder, and his friends are able to escape the pit. They soon find Christopher Robin, and tell him about the Backson, but he clarifies, saying that he meant to be "back soon". The hunny pot prize is given to the red balloon from earlier, much to Pooh's dismay.  Later, Pooh visits Owl only to find that Owl is the one that has taken Eeyore's tail, not realizing that it belongs to Eeyore. Owl has been using Eeyore's tail as a bell-pull for his door. Pooh chooses to leave and return the tail to Eeyore instead of sharing a pot of honey with Owl. Christopher Robin is proud of Pooh's selflessness and rewards him with a large pot of honey.  In a [[post-credits scene]], the Backson is revealed to be real, but actually gentle. He notices a trail of things from Tigger’s Backson costume and decides to pick them up so they do not get broken. But he does not realize the trail leads to the pit, and falls in. He decides to wait for someone to help him out and hopes he will be "back soon".

He knocks her out and returns home with her, restrains her in a cellar, and directs his family to participate in "civilizing" her.   Over the following days, the family is revealed to be dysfunctional.

World of the Dead: The Zombie Diaries
 A family is holding a birthday for their daughter during the apocalypse, maintaining the illusion things are still normal despite their only light source being a camcorder and birthday candles. It is clear, however, that they have barely been surviving as zombies overwhelm them.  The footage of the "birthday" is archived by a military photographer, Jones, who documents his team's efforts of surviving the zombie onslaught in a remote beachside compound. There, they take in survivors, both infected and not, including the sole survivor of the last movie's original film crew, Leanne (now portrayed by Alix Wilton Regan). Together, along with a medical officer, the team attempts to hold out as long as possible. Things take a turn for the worse, as zombies break in and overrun the facility. Only Leanne, Jones, and a handful of soldiers make it out alive, forced to leave behind one of their own.  The survivors find their way to a remote cabin where they attempt to hold up for the night as it begins snowing. However, the zombie population has grown too much for anywhere to be safe and they are once more forced to flee. With their transportation incapacitated, they make a dangerous trek through the brutal outdoors at night.  The next day, the survivors continue to seek any kind of sanctuary. While walking in the woods, they discover booby-traps and the macabre remains of dispatched zombies. Figuring it to be human bandits, they carefully avoid numerous traps, until they come across the enemy hideout. It is here they discover the true enemies of the living, a bastion of psychopathic renegades led by the notorious Goke (Russell Jones). Hardened by the elements, Goke is once again aided by his sidekick Manny and several other humans, that he leads with no discrimination.  Two of the soldiers, Jones and Carter, secretly witness Goke's men sexually assault an infected female, until the leader steps out and shoots her in the head before chastising them. Jones and Carter return to the others to inform them of the situation before falling back into the woods. Leanne, at this point, had yet to see her past tormentors, however she recognises the grim location she had been found prior to the movies opening.  Throughout the day, the soldiers and Leanne use hand to hand tactics against the undead to keep the bandits from knowing their location. They continue this until night as they camp, each survivor divulging their personal lives as it is now clear that there is indeed hope... a ship preparing to leave. Their discussion is cut short as they hear the sounds of someone nearby, discovering that the bandits are in fact searching for them. Tragedy strikes as Leanne is discovered and reunited with Goke and Manny. Uninterested in raping her again, Goke promises that she will have a special fate. The soldiers, in hiding, strike against the gang and rescue Leanne. In the shootout, zombies overwhelm both sides as Carter is unfortunately shot and subsequently devoured.  As Leanne and the soldiers are once again forced into the night, they find themselves in a cemetery while the bandits dispatch the living dead. As another dawn once again gives the survivors light, they are unfortunately captured after a devastating shootout leaving the last female soldiers, Kayne (Vicky Araico), injured. Fate is once again cruel to Leanne, as she and her fellow captives are once again in the same barn the military rescued her from.  Goke, Manny and his crew subdue and tie up the survivors, keeping Kayne separated as well as taking control of Jones' camera. Goke sets his evil sights on torturing them, having a mentally impaired follower named Billy beat the team's leader. Leanne even goes as far as to call Goke by his name, begging him to stop. He does not, allowing Billy to violently assault the leader.  Goke and Billy enter the next room to find Manny torturing the injured Kayne. they then prepare Billy for "initiation", by raping her. Hesitant throughout, Billy is physically forced to sexually assault and stab the woman to death. Before Goke can rape her dead body, gunshots are heard in the next room. The three reenter the holding room of the barn to find that all the survivors are still tied up and one of his men shot dead, a victim of Nicholson, the soldier left behind in the beginning of the movie who had been following behind his comrades all along. Another psycho, Curtis, has his throat slit and Manny is shot. Goke manages to flee outside and after a short shootout, escapes.  Having been freed by Nicholson, Leanne oversees an injured Manny who taunts her before meeting a bloody end at the young woman's shotgun.  After the burial and mourning for Kayne, the soldiers leader, Maddox, is interrogated by the others who discover the truth of the UK's fate. A large scale firebombing has been ordered for the next morning. With his hopes set on the boats, Maddox leads Jones, Leanne and Nicholson to a nearby bunker where the last known military holdout was known to be. The soldiers of the bunker are all dead, leaving the survivors in a state of panic. Maddox, close to losing all hope, runs out to find where the soldiers had left markers for the boats which never came. Insistent on waiting, despite the sounds of the jets overhead, he remains behind as the others engage in combat against an army of zombies.  While Jonesy, Nicholson and Leeann are still in the bunker, zombies come in surrounding them. Nicholson orders them to fight but Jonesy is too scared and can only watch. Nicholson is killed and Jonesy instead watches Leeann fight them herself but she tires out and falls and is killed as well. Jonesy then states his failure to the camera and commits suicide via pistol when a zombie grabs him.  Footage throughout the film, show soldiers in hazmat gear gathering survivors and killing them to prevent further infection reveal them to be Jones, Maddox, Carter and Kayne, facing the psychological damage of slaughtering possible innocents and burning their remains during a time when the infection wasn't clear. For the last time, a camera blinks out.  The ending of the film dispenses with the found footage approach and is presented in a traditional cinema style, showing Maddox as the sole survivor of the group. Walking the beach at sunrise, he is taken back at being alive as the beauty of sunrise gives an uncertain future. On the shoreline he stumbles across other survivors, a husband and his pregnant wife, who beg for his help after revealing they had come to the UK in seek of refuge from their destroyed city of Rotterdam in Holland. They reveal they were told that the UK was safe and survivors were gathering there. They ask Maddox to help them.

With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's [[Chosen people|exclusivist]] view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain.  Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-bound Xavier and his mutants are at the mansion, where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss. When they kiss, Xavier uses his powers and erases their memories from her mind. Elsewhere, Lehnsherr, now wearing Shaw's [[Magneto (comics)|helmet]], frees Frost from confinement.

However, they get lost in a snowstorm and are forced to take shelter in the Glensville Sanatorium for the night, where the Hillickers are living. Lauren remembers her brother's stories about the sanatorium and the cannibalistic Hillickers, but her friends don't believe her. As the group goes to bed, Vincent continues to explore the asylum, where he finds Porter's corpse before being killed by Saw Tooth by an iron rod through the nose.  The next day, with the storm still in full effect, the teens remain trapped and go in search of Vincent. Jenna comes across the Hillickers butchering Porter's body in the kitchen and runs back to warn the others. After Porter's severed head is thrown at the group, Claire is hung from a balcony with barbed wire by the trio and decapitated.

Kyle, Daniel, and Sara go into the basement to get weapons, but Daniel gets abducted, tied to a table in the kitchen, and slowly butchered and eaten alive. The rest of the group chases the cannibals and locks them in a cell; Kyle stays behind to watch them while the others search for spark-plugs for the snowmobiles. When Kyle falls asleep, the brothers escape their cell, and the girls accidentally stab Kyle to death after he has his tongue cut out and is dressed up like one of the Hillickers. The cannibals appear and chase the girls through the building, forcing them to climb out of a window; Jenna gets stuck and is impaled with a ground driller by Saw Tooth. The Hillickers chase the girls on the snowmobiles, where Kenia gets injured and Bridget gets crushed under one of the snowmobiles by One Eye.  As the day dawns, Lauren has frozen to death in the storm a mere few yards away from a highway. Kenia is still being chased by One Eye when Sara reappears and knocks him off the snowmobile, allowing the pair to steal it. As they gleefully drive away, they are simultaneously decapitated by a simple barbed wire fence.

Yelling to the Sky
 The film starts out with quiet, studious, high schooler, Sweetness O'Hara riding her bike with a friend down the street, when neighborhood bully Latonya, her boyfriend, and friends begins picking on her. The boyfriend threatens to take her bike, unless she can beat him in a race to a tree down the street. Sweetness agrees, taking off running. The bully comes up behind her and pushes her to the ground, proceeding to kick her. Sweetness' older, yet pregnant sister, Ola, comes to her rescue, beating up the bully.   The girls return home to their emotionally unstable mother, Lorene, and caring, but violent father, Gordon. After an altercation between the parents, Lorene takes off, telling Sweetness she'd return. Gordon takes off as well, with Sweetness saying she wished he stayed wherever it was he went.   A few days later, as Ola is helping Sweetness with her homework and ironing, Gordon returns. He hits Ola after her choice to wear a jacket inside the house. Ola then packs up and moves in with her probation-serving, abusive boyfriend and baby's father, leaving Sweetness with just her father. Months go by and Ola returns with a baby girl named Esther. Not too long after, Lorene returns as well, in an absent state of mind.   At school, her principal, Mr. Coleman, unknowingly protects Sweetness from getting beat up by Latonya and her friends, Fatima and Jojo, by asking about her sister and asking how she was doing. The girls deliver a letter written to their father, saying his brother has passed in his sleep. After their father embarrasses them in front of his friends, Sweetness announces that she hates their father to her sister as they walk home. Back at home, with Gordon absent, Ola chases after Lorene, who has absent-mindedly walked out of the house. Sweetness gets frustrated at the way their lives are going and decides to take action.  The next morning, Sweetness and her father get into a fight due to her wearing makeup to school. She defends herself, talking back and throwing a bottle of glue at him, telling him that was the last time he'd ever hit her. She starts selling drugs, with the help of a local drug dealer and friend, Roland, who is reluctant. She persuades him by telling him it's not for extra spending, but to help her family out. He agrees.  She begins to hang out with Fatima and Jojo, after they buy drugs off her. She fights Latonya at school, which ends up in getting Sweetness suspended. She sees Latonya at school later on, carrying books and going to class, symbolizing how the roles have reversed between the girls since the start of the film.   During a drug deal, Sweetness tags along with Roland, who tells her to stay put. She walks into the hotel room, against Roland's advice, and is groped by one of the drug dealers. The two manage to escape the failed drug deal, and almost get arrested in the process. When Roland drops Sweetness off, she kisses him, but he refuses her advances, but continues kissing her despite her age.  A few days later, while the girls and Roland are cutting school and playing handball, the two guys from the failed drug deal drive by and shoot Roland, who dies instantly. Sweetness blames herself for the shooting, realizing that if she hadn't walked into the hotel room, he'd still be alive. She angrily destroys hers and Ola's shared bedroom, and takes off with Ola's car to a party. On her way home, while drunk and high on coke and weed (and after losing her virginity), Sweetness totals the car, promising to pay her sister back every penny.   After helping her father put stitches on a cut on his head one night, her father starts to become less violent towards his family. He sees Sweetness drinking with her friends on the street one day, but doesn't get angry at her when she returns home that night. He follows her to school and waits for her afterwards, following her back home. She expresses her frustration with him, demanding to know what he wants. He tells her that he's worried about her and that he's here for her now, all with her replying "too late now".   Realizing her future if she stays in her neighborhood, she starts to turn things around. First, by applying for college, apologizing to Latonya (who doesn't accept it), and opting to stay in and do dishes instead of going out with her friends.   The film ends with her and her father halfway between her high school and house, with him saying that he's going to walk with her the next day. She offers meeting him halfway (because of his hip), but he refuses. She starts to cry and the two embrace, slowly fading out to the credits.  
You May Not Kiss the Bride
  The unassuming pet photographer, Bryan Lighthouse ([[Dave Annable]]) is thrown into a serious action and romance adventure when he's forced to marry Masha Nikitin ([[Katharine McPhee]]) to pay a debt to her criminal parents against his will. Masha's father Vlatko (aka Vadik) ([[Ken Davitian]]) marries her to Bryan to get her a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]], under the condition that Bryan cannot touch her. Off to spend their honeymoon at a remote tropical resort somewhere in [[Tahiti]], Masha's former boyfriend Brick ([[Vinnie Jones]]), who is in love with her (although she does not return the feeling), follows them.  After Masha catches Bryan dancing with a hotel waitress, she storms off, as it is hinted she hates womanizers. Feeling bad, the waitress Lani ([[Tia Carrere]]) suggests Bryan take Masha on a romantic outing, to a secret beach encased by a tropical rainforest to make it up to her. While teasing Bryan at the secret cove, Masha flees into the rainforest and is kidnapped.   Bryan searches for Masha back at the hotel, unaware she has been kidnapped. He then finds that his psychotic assistant, Tonya ([[Mena Suvari]]), who is in love with him, has tracked him down to the resort. Tonya has brought condoms and tries to have sex with him. After Bryan informs her that he does not want to have sex with her, Tonya agrees to help find Masha, but tells him that she will one day force him to have sex with her, after trying to have sex with him one more time.  After receiving a call from Masha's kidnappers demanding a ransom, Bryan asks Lani for help. While Bryan, Lani, and Tonya are making plans, Brick storms in and Lani and Tonya escape off the balcony, leaving Bryan to face Brick's wrath. When Brick finds a condom Tonya had brought on the unmade, wrecked bed, he assumes that Bryan had attempted to take Masha's virginity and hits him. Bryan barely escapes, while Brick calls Masha's father back in [[United States|the USA]] and informs him of Masha's kidnapping, making it sound as if Bryan had been the kidnapper. Meanwhile, the kidnappers turn out to be two American [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] agents Agent Meyers ([[Howard Bishop]]) and Agent Ross ([[Kevin Dunn]]).  Afterwards Brick tells Masha's father Vlatko about the condom and Bryan's supposed attempt to have sex with Masha, Vlatko becomes enraged and prepares to fly to the island. Lani calls her cousin, Ernesto ([[Rob Schneider]]) to help find Masha with his helicopter. A chase scene occurs between Brick and the four heroes (Bryan, Lani, Tonya, and Ernesto) and ends with the group making a hasty escape in Ernesto's helicopter, only to later crash-land by a fishing village. Deciding to rest on a beach at the edge of the village, Ernesto and Tonya kiss passionately, unconcerned of Masha's dire condition, and Lani and Bryan storm off in anger. Alone, Ernesto and Tonya almost have sex in a boat in the grass, but Brick soon shows up and knocks them out, revealing that Brick is in on the kidnapping. Separated, Lani and Bryan obliviously go in separate directions. Masha escapes her prison in a surfboard shack and finds Bryan, who is crazily driving a jeep stolen from Brick after he tried to kill Bryan. Bryan and Masha crash the jeep, which erupts into flames, and make an escape on foot.  Finding a canoe on a river, they outrun the three culprits and find a friendly welcoming old-time village. After eating a huge dinner and dancing and having fun, Masha and Bryan have sex for the first time. The next morning, they awake to a cheering village. However, during breakfast the two agents and Brick find the village. Brick and the lovers battle on a steep ocean cliff. Just as  Brick is ready to kill Bryan, Lani and Ernesto show up in the helicopter, catching Brick off guard. Masha, using the distraction, grabs Brick's gun and shoots him in the back: he falls off the cliff, taking Bryan with him. Masha is in shock, terrified with the thought that she killed Bryan too. Bryan appears in the waves, unharmed, and they are reunited with Masha's family.  Vlatko gives Bryan his blessing to marry Masha for real, but he declines despite his feelings for her.   Masha, heartbroken, continues her old life taking dance lessons. One day, unable to concentrate on the dance routine she was practicing, Marsha leaves the dance studio to find Bryan outside ready to propose to her as he changed his mind. As the crowd around them applauds, the film ends with the camera panning away from the couple as they kiss.<ref name=ymnktbfacebook>[https://www.facebook.com/YouMayNotKissTheBride 'You May Not Kiss the Bride' Official Facebook Page]</ref>

Their relationship grows, and Ching-teng's grades gradually improve.  On graduation, Ching-teng enrolls at the [[National Chiao Tung University]]. Chia-Yi, who did not do well on the admission exam because she was ill on that day, only manages to enter the [[National Taipei University of Education]] with her mediocre test results. Depressed and upset, she is consoled by Ching-teng, who calls her long-distance almost every night from the university. During the winter holiday season that year, the two go on their first "date", during which Ching-teng asks Chia-yi if she loves him. However, fearing she would say no, he decides that he would rather not hear her answer (it is revealed later that her reply would have been "yes"). Ching-teng later organizes a fight night and invites Chia-yi to watch, hoping to impress her with his "strength". On the contrary, Chia-yi finds it childish for Ching-teng to injure himself for no reason. This upsets Ching-teng, sparking a quarrel that causes the two to break up.  During the two years after their breakup, Ching-teng has no contact with Chia-yi. He qualifies for a graduate research course at [[Tunghai University]], where he begins writing stories online. Ching-teng only regains contact with Chia-yi after the [[921 earthquake]], when he calls to see if she is okay. During their long conversation with each other, they both lament the fact that they were not fated to become a couple.  Years later, in 2005, Chia-yi suddenly calls Ching-teng to tell him that she is getting married. All of her old friends gather at the wedding, making jokes and trying to embarrass her somewhat-older husband. They are surprised that their past emotions have transformed into deep friendship and serenity. Ching-teng begins to work on a web novel about his experiences with Chia-yi.  Later, when they gather to congratulate the bride and groom, the friends joke that they should be able to kiss the bride. The husband says that anybody who wants to kiss the bride has to kiss him like that first. Ching-teng grabs the groom and pushes him onto the table, kissing him like he would kiss Chia-yi. During their kiss, he remembers how he regrets their fight from years ago, and what could have happened had he apologized for being childish.

While celebrating his latest victory over the evil sorcerer, Leezar, who has been ravaging Tallious's kingdom, Fabious introduces the virgin Belladonna whom he has freed from a tower and wishes to marry. Though his brother makes him the best man, Thadeous skips the wedding after overhearing Fabious' Knights Elite, led by Boremont, talk about him negatively. The wedding is then crashed by Leezar, who reveals himself to be the one who placed Belladonna in the tower. Leezar re-kidnaps her and flees. Returning to the castle with his servant Courtney, Thadeous is given an ultimatum: join Fabious on his quest to rescue Belladonna or be banished from Mourne.

Young Adult (film)
 Mavis Gary ([[Charlize Theron]]) is a divorced, [[alcoholic]] 37-year-old [[ghost writer]] of a series of [[young adult novel]]s, who is on deadline with her editor to finish the last book of the soon-to-be-cancelled series. Mavis receives an e-mail with a picture of the newborn daughter of her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]) and his wife Beth ([[Elizabeth Reaser]]). Believing this to be a sign she and Buddy are meant to be together, Mavis leaves [[Minneapolis]] and returns to her hometown of Mercury, Minnesota, to reclaim her life with Buddy, under the pretext of overseeing a real estate deal.  Upon arriving after listening to "The Concept" by [[Teenage Fanclub]] on repeat from an old [[mixtape]] Buddy gave her in high school, Mavis arranges to meet him the next day at a local sports bar, for old times' sake. In the interim, she goes alone to a different bar, Woody's. There she reconnects with a former classmate she barely remembers, Matt Freehauf ([[Patton Oswalt]]), who became disabled after being beaten by jocks who erroneously assumed he was [[gay]]. Matt tells Mavis that her plan to destroy Buddy's marriage is irrational and selfish, but she ignores him.  The following day, Mavis meets Buddy at the sports bar, where they run into Matt, the bar's bookkeeper. On their way out, Buddy invites Mavis to a performance of Beth's "mom rock band". In the interim, Mavis spends another night getting drunk with Matt, who distills homemade bourbon in the garage of the house he shares with his sister Sandra. When Mavis attends the concert of Beth's band, the other moms are resentful of Mavis, whom they remember as the "psychotic prom queen bitch". When Beth's band performs, the lead singer dedicates their opening song to Buddy from Beth; much to Mavis's dismay, it is "The Concept".  Beth wants to stay out longer, so Mavis offers to drive the drunk Buddy home. On the lawn they share a kiss that is quickly broken up when the [[babysitter]] opens the front door to greet them. The next day, after an awkward encounter with her parents, Mavis is invited to Buddy's daughter's [[naming ceremony]]. She later goes out drinking with Matt again, during which Matt tells Mavis to grow up. The following day, Mavis attends the party, where she declares her love for Buddy, but he rebuffs her. Everyone at the party is called out to the lawn to await a surprise Buddy has prepared for Beth. Mavis, who has been drinking at the party, collides with Beth, who accidentally spills punch on Mavis's dress. Mavis insults her, and in a profanity-laced tirade tearfully reveals she became pregnant with Buddy's baby years ago, but had a [[miscarriage]] after three months.  Buddy, who has been preparing a drum-set gift for Beth in the garage, opens the garage door and belatedly learns what has transpired. Mavis asks him why he invited her. He reveals it was Beth's idea, as she feels sorry for Mavis. Humiliated, Mavis leaves the party and visits Matt, where she breaks down in tears and, later, initiates sex. The following morning, while Matt sleeps, Mavis has coffee in the kitchen with Sandra, who still idolizes her. Mavis talks about needing to change herself, but Sandra says Mavis is better than the rest of Mercury and should not change. Mavis says she agrees, and prepares to return to Minneapolis. Sandra asks to go with her but Mavis declines and leaves alone.  In a diner on her way home, Mavis writes the last chapter of the book, in which the main character graduates high school, quickly leaves her past behind and looks forward to the future. Afterward, in the parking lot, Mavis contemplates her damaged car, still crumpled from an earlier incident during which she was driving it drunk.

Your Sister's Sister
 Jack, struggling emotionally a year after the death of his brother, takes up an offer from his friend (and his brother's ex-girlfriend) Iris to stay at her father's isolated island cabin, to contemplate and restore his spirits. Once he arrives there by ferry and then bicycle, Jack unexpectedly encounters Iris's sister Hannah, a lesbian who has recently broken up with her partner and has moved to the cabin without letting her family know. Although she initially attempts to attack him as a trespasser, he explains his relationship to Iris and she allows him to stay.  Later that night, he has trouble sleeping in his small bed and wanders to the kitchen to find Hannah drinking heavily. The pair drink together and converse about their relationships. Jack tells Hannah she is attractive, that her partner is crazy to let her go, and, if she weren't a lesbian, he'd like to be with her. Much to Jack's surprise, Hannah offers to sleep with him - perhaps because she's drunk. With a condom supplied by Hannah, they have very brief sex.  Unexpectedly, Iris arrives at the cabin the next morning. Iris is surprised to find Hannah there, and after they exchange greetings, Jack privately pleads with Hannah to not mention their tryst to Iris. Hannah is bemused by Jack's distress. Later that night, Iris eventually divulges to her sister that she's fallen in love with Jack, and Hannah is then distressed. Iris then checks on Jack, as neither are sleepy, and they talk a while, then spend the night (non-sexually) in the same bed. Early the next morning, Hannah agrees with Jack that she will keep their indiscretion secret.  Later in the day, the trio's conversations lead to the reason behind Hannah's breakup: her desire to have a child. At that, Iris comments that Hannah could simply get a male donor to be pregnant. When Hannah and Iris decide to go for a stroll, Jack tells them he'd rather stay at the cabin "to read." During their stroll, a guilt-ridden Hannah confesses to Iris she slept with Jack, while a suspicious Jack examines the trashed condom, discovering it heavily perforated. Iris runs back to the cabin, with Hannah in pursuit.  Iris confronts Jack about sleeping with her sister, while Jack accuses Hannah of "stealing my sperm". Hannah reluctantly confesses that she deliberately sabotaged the condom in hopes of becoming impregnated, but that she would never have slept with Jack if she had known Iris was in love with him. Jack is stunned at this news, and Iris is stunned that Hannah would reveal the same. Iris storms out, and Hannah says to Jack, "I am a really bad person," and then goes outside.  Later that night, Jack talks to Iris and apologizes, but then departs the cabin, leaving the sisters to sort out these transgressions. Over the next day or so, the sisters gradually reconcile, with Iris offering to help Hannah to raise the child should she give birth; meanwhile, Jack, away camping in a tent, later goes into a nearby town where his bicycle breaks down, leading him to vent his frustrations by destroying it.  Eventually, Jack returns to the cabin and requites Iris's love, also offering to help Hannah to take care of her possible baby. The trio return to the city, and the final scene has Hannah taking a [[home pregnancy test]] with Iris and Jack joining her to see the result, which is not revealed.  
Yuddham Sei
 The film opens on a rainy night. A woman trying to hire an auto standing by the kerb, notices an unconscious girl in the back seat. She proceeds to call the police realizing something is amiss, but is chased by a man seated in the driver's seat.  The scene then shifts to a New Year celebration by the beach where a cardboard box atop a car attracts the attention of revellers. The police are called. A similar box is also found in a park. Amputated male arms are found in the boxes and the case is put onto J. Krishnan, known as J.K. ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]), of the CB-CID. He is a brooding ex-cop who shifted from law and enforcement, paying the price for honesty, and at present is searching for his sister Charu who disappeared six months prior. Prakash (Shankar) and Tamilselvi ([[Dipa Shah]]) are two juniors who are put onto the case to assist JK.  At the morgue, they meet Judas Iscariot ([[Jayaprakash]]), a medical examiner, to investigate the hands. Judas, mildly esoteric, often draws parallels between JK and [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Jiddu Krishnamurthi]]. JK is able to identify one pair of hands as belonging to auto-driver Moorthy and follows the lead. Through a local goon Surendra, they single out a middleman Rajamanickam.  JK gets a cop to give him sensitive information stored in files at the ACP's office while still trying to trace his sister. He often goes and visits the place where his sister was last seen in the hope of getting clues. Meanwhile, Rajamanickam is tortured and his hands are amputated and displayed as well. A plain clothes constable gives a tip that Rajamanickam's bike is at a lodge in Triplicane. JK goes to investigate but finds a man, Raghu (whom Rajamanickam visited at the lodge), killed in his room. He chases a man who crossed him on his way up, but loses him.  Focus then shifts to John Britto, a missing man, who stayed with Raghu. Interviewing Britto's brother, he finds that Britto was the cause of disgrace to Dr Purushothaman ([[Y. G. Mahendra|Y. Gee. Mahendra]]) and his family, who all committed suicide the previous September. JK gets permission to reopen Dr Purushothaman's case. Dr Purushothaman had been charged of bribery and his wife Annapoorni ([[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]]), of instigating a lab attendant, Manikandan, to have sex with her. However, everyone questioned have only nice things to say about the family while Manikandan is said to be a scoundrel. It is found Manikandan has been missing since November.  Introduce the green [[Toyota Qualis|Qualis]] which prevents an auto-driver from kidnapping a drugged woman and takes him in instead.  Tamilselvi while looking at old case records of the Purushothaman case, finds that Purushothaman had a daughter Suja who disappeared on the same day JK's sister did – September 6. JK investigates Purushothaman’s house and later goes to get details from a dodgy inspector, Isakki Muthu ([[G. Marimuthu]]), who handled the Purushothaman case. JK leads Isakki Muthu to give him details about Dorai Pandi ([[Manikka Vinayagam|Manicka Vinayagam]]), a textile shop owner who was accused of peeping at girls in the change room of his shop through a hole in his office (one of whom was Suja).  JK then interviews Dorai Pandi who was able to get off after his manager Nadhamani took the blame. JK is unfazed and undeterred by what Dorai Pandi has to say and concludes the case is showing resemblances of having the [[Rashomon effect]].  He then reconfirms again with Judas on the Purushothaman autopsy. He is able to get a major lead when he finds that there were two people in the auto that took Suja from her dance class. The same is established for his sister's disappearance.  We then find that ACP Tirusangu ([[Selva (actor)|Selva]]), Isakki Muthu, Dorai Pandi, Sharif, Inba ([[Yugendran]]), Raghu's murderer and the missing men – Nagoo, Moorthy and Rajamanickam are in cahoots. Tirusangu arranges for a few men to deal with JK and keep his nose out of their business. At this time, Sharif is kidnapped by the same Qualis. JK deals with the men (Intermission) and Sharif is executed but not before he names a few men.  A new box appears in a club used by two of the named and Sharif's head, with the eyelids cut off is found outside Isakki Muthu's police station. JK triangulates all misdeeds to the ACP and Isakki Muthu. But his boss Chandramouli ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) refuses to have the officers questioned fearing higher pressure. Unable to take any further action, JK requests a gun permit.  We then find that JK's sister ([[Iniya]]) is being held captive by Tirusangu. It is discovered she is the woman from the first scene. He plans to use her for later. Then, the Qualis comes again and tries to kidnap Isakki Muthu but is forced to flee when JK intervenes. Tirusangu realizes that someone is looking for revenge for Purushothaman's death and with the help of Purushothaman's ex classmate, finds out whom. Both Tirusangu and JK then find that Purushothaman's family may not be dead. At a party, Judas comes in and tells Dorai Pandi & Co. (the men named by Sharif) that he is willing to sell information about their activities. He leads them to a van where they are gassed in. But while leaving, a shootout takes place between Tirusangu and JK, in which Judas dies after confessing.  Tirusangu & Co., organize “peep shows” with young girls for Dorai Pandi and others who are impotent. Suja ([[Srushti Dange]]) is one such victim (the girl in the auto). It’s during her incident that JK’s sister is also apprehended. Unable to bear this, she commits suicide. Her parents and Judas decide to take revenge on all those responsible. They fake their death after meticulous planning. They kidnap John Britto and then the peon Manikandan and make them confess. Auto-drivers Nagoo, Moorthy, and Rajamanickam were then kidnapped, tortured, and their arms amputated.  The boy Nishanth (Sunil Choudhary), is caught in the fracas and taken in. JK receives a call from Tirusangu's lot who want to trade his sister Charu for the boy. Chandramouli refuses to do so. However, his subordinates, Prakash, Tamilselvi, and constable Kitappa (E. Ramdoss), bring the boy to JK at the cost of their jobs.  Nishanth reveals the location of his parents as the old Binny Mills. Both parties head there. Another shoot out occurs. Nishanth is caught by Isakki Muthu but, is distracted by the arrival of a blinded Dorai Pandi & Co., and also John Britto and Manikandan, both with their tongues cut-off. Purushothaman and Annapoorni rush out and attack Isakki Muthu. Irrespective of how many times they are shot, they continue their onslaught, killing Isakki Muthu and the others of the gang, one by one. Finally, Tirusangu arrives with JK's sister. Seeing her as their daughter Suja, and this as a chance to save her life they sacrifice themselves for her as JK kills Tirusangu.  Dorai Pandi is sentenced for 13 years and the others 6–7 years. John Britto and Manikandan are given 3 years, JK & Co. are suspended. Nishanth is asked to be produced in court but JK sends him abroad as Mahesh Muthuswamy, giving him [[Viktor Frankl]]’s ‘[[Man's Search for Meaning]]’, asking him to search for the meaning of his life.

 A [[zookeeper]] named Griffin Keyes ([[Kevin James]]) sets up a plan to propose to the love of his life Stephanie ([[Leslie Bibb]]), but she rejects him and claims that his career as a zookeeper is what is keeping her away, therefore breaking Griffin's heart.

That night, Griffin holds a party at the zoo for his brother Dave ([[Nat Faxon]]) who is getting married, but freaks out when he discovers that Stephanie was invited. Dave offers Griffin to come and work with him at a car dealership, explaining that it is the best way to get Stephanie back. Griffin contemplates quitting his job at the zoo and joining his brother at the dealership.  Later, the animals hold a meeting saying that they think Griffin is the best zookeeper at the zoo and don't want him to leave, so they decide to find some way to help him win Stephanie's heart. Jerome the Bear ([[Jon Favreau]]) suggests that they teach Griffin their animal mating techniques, but Joe the Lion ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) protests, reminding them that it's against the animal code to talk to humans. Donald the Monkey ([[Adam Sandler]]) says that Stephanie will be at the zoo tomorrow, and all the animals have to do is make Griffin look like a hero in front of her.  The next day, Donald unlocks the door to the lion enclosure and lets Joe out, who confronts Stephanie and Dave's fiancée Robin (Steffiana de la Cruz). Kate ([[Rosario Dawson]]), the zoo's vet, manages to get them away from Joe, but Griffin fails to jump into the lion enclosure, ruining the animals' plan. When he climbs out of the enclosure, Joe yells at Griffin, causing Griffin to believe he has gone mad. The next night, all the animals break their code of silence and tell Griffin that they will teach him what to do to win Stephanie.

Griffin then has a talk with Bernie ([[Nick Nolte]]), a forlorn gorilla who was moved into a deep enclosure after allegedly attacking a zookeeper named Shane ([[Donnie Wahlberg]]).

Griffin discovers that Stephanie is dating her other ex-boyfriend, a bullying alpha-male named Gale ([[Joe Rogan]]). Joe's mate Janet ([[Cher]]) tells Griffin that the best way to attract a female is to be seen with another female, so Griffin asks Kate to go with him to Dave and Robin's wedding. Griffin then takes Bernie to [[T.G.I. Friday's]] and they bond, with Bernie telling Griffin that he's his best friend.  Griffin and Kate go to the wedding and seem to have fun together. Griffin becomes brave enough to stand up to Gale and this grabs Stephanie's attention. After Kate tells Griffin she had a great time with him, Stephanie asks Griffin out to dinner. Griffin accepts and they go to dinner and then go to a fashion show. Stephanie tells Griffin that his job at the zoo is holding him back, so Griffin decides to quit his job and accepts Dave's offer, which upsets Kate. Bernie also becomes upset and tells Griffin that he thought he could trust someone again, but was proved wrong when Griffin quit his job. Kate decides to leave the zoo and accepts a job in [[Nairobi]].  Griffin becomes the best employee at the car dealership, but misses working at the zoo. Stephanie proposes to Griffin, but Griffin refuses and dumps her after coming to the realization that if Stephanie did love him she would accept him for who he was and not what he was. He then goes back to the zoo and apologizes to Bernie, who accepts Griffin's friendship. The animals then tell Griffin that Kate is heading to the airport. Griffin heads out to stop her, though he does make a stop first to beat up Shane. Then, with Bernie's help, Griffin manages to catch up with Kate on the bridge and confesses his love for her.
