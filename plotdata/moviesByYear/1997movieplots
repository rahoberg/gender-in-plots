The 6th Man
 Antoine ([[Kadeem Hardison]]) and Kenny Tyler ([[Marlon Wayans]]), two close brothers, play a [[basketball]] game in 1986. Their motto for each other is "A&K: All the Way", created by their mother. Their father, James, coaches the team and directs Kenny to take the last shot for the win, but he passes the ball to Antoine out of fright, who misses and costs them the game. That night, Kenny tries to cheer Antoine up, still upset about missing the shot. James tells them that all they have to do is stick together and anything can happen. Shortly after, James has a conversation alone with Kenny, encouraging him to take risks and not to be afraid of missing.  In the present day, both Antoine and Kenny are a famed duo on their [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|University of Washington]] college basketball team, the Huskies. Celebrating their most recent win at a nightclub, Kenny meets R.C. St. John ([[Michael Michele]]), a reporter for UW, with whom he sparks an interest in. During a road game at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], Antoine scores a [[slam dunk]] before suffering a [[heart attack]] while hanging on the rim. Coach Pederson ([[David Paymer]]) informs Kenny and the team after the game that Antoine has died.  Without Antoine, the team begins falling apart. During one game, however, odd sequences begin to occur, leading to a surprising win. Antoine appears to Kenny in the locker room, revealing he aided the team supernaturally, and explains that the reason he's back is because Kenny called him. Kenny's teammates begin to question his concerning behavior (as only Kenny can see Antoine), and he informs his teammates about Antoine's reemergence, who are skeptical until Antoine uses supernatural forces to persuade them. Under Antoine's influence, the team storms through the competition and eventually make it to the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]], for the first time in over a decade. Meanwhile, Kenny's relationship with R.C. deepens, despite Antoine's efforts to disband the two, believing R.C. is only out to get a story on him, which is partially true. R.C. originally prepares to submit a story to the paper when Kenny discloses to her that Antoine is aiding the team, but eventually decides against it.  The rest of the team begin to have misgivings about Antoine helping them in their games. Kenny informs Antoine, who becomes irate, and wrecks the room they're in. After calming down, Antoine relents to Kenny that he never wanted to pass away. Kenny tells the team he wants Antoine to stay, because he doesn't want to lose his brother again. However, in the Final Four against Georgetown, Antoine's antics seriously injure their All-American, Jerrod Smith ([[Flex Alexander|Flex]]), a close friend of Kenny's. While Kenny visits Jerrod at the hospital, R.C. arrives and knows it's because of Antoine, having discovered his spirit and clues in a game's footage. R.C. tells Kenny that he's letting Antoine run his life even in death, and will never truly live unless he lets Antoine go. Kenny tells Antoine not to interfere during the championship game with the team by his side, or they will voluntarily forfeit. Disappointed, Antoine leaves, but lingers nearby.  The team plays poorly in the first half of the game. At halftime, Kenny gives a speech to fire the team up, telling them that they still have Antoine in their hearts, with the coach and Antoine proud that Kenny has finally stepped up as a leader. The team goes back in the second half with an impressive rally to bring the game close. Kenny attempts the game winning shot. Antoine tries to help, but Kenny tells him not to, making the shot on his own and the Huskies win the championship for the very first time. His job completed, Antoine makes his way back to Heaven after one final moment with his brother, where he reminds Kenny that he will always be with him. As Kenny celebrates with his team, Antoine goes off into the distance under an array of lights. Coach Pederson sees this and asks Kenny if this was Antoine, to which Kenny admits, finally able to say "A&K all the way".

Then Charlie comes up with an idea that he will give back the heads without anyone noticing, by pretending he forgot to turn in his report back at his college. In turn, everyone packs up for the airport. At the airport, Charlie accidentally puts a severed head in Dick's carry-on bag, causing him to get arrested. They never leave Acapulco since they have to come up with a new plan to save Dick.  Meanwhile, Tommy, Ernie, and Steve start to look for replacement heads, after Charlie tells Tommy he lost one.

After hearing of the airport incident, Benny and Rico decide to collect the heads for themselves.  When Fern, Dick's mother, arrives in Mexico, Tommy takes her and the others hostage as he helps Charlie find more heads. They find out that a coyote took one of the heads from the stolen car. Tommy also realizes that Benny and Rico are going to kill him if he doesn't get the heads across the border in time. Charlie comes up with a plan to save both their lives.  The film ends when Charlie and Laurie take a severed head to the airport to prove her father's innocence. Benny and Rico try to intervene, but end up getting arrested. It is revealed that Tommy and Charlie set them up. Charlie thanks him for his help, as Tommy departs to Hawaii.

Suddenly, a tree branch breaks through the window and Marshall shoots it multiple times. Amy hammers a table onto the window to prevent the cold from getting in. She smells something burning and finds a lizard underneath the heater. Marshall picks it up, and takes into the kitchen to examine it. He discovers that the creature has been eating the local wildlife and was pregnant. They start looking for the eggs, and Marshall accidentally breaks the handle on the poison sprayer. Amy fetches a water gun from her bedroom and attaches the sprayer's hose to it. They go into the bedroom and discover tracks under the bed. A lizard leaps out of the closet with Marshall chasing it into the living room, firing multiple rounds at it. Amy grabs the gun from him and wait for the lizard to come out from underneath the couch, shooting it in the head. They go to bedroom again and find an egg. Amy throws it on the floor and stomps on it. Marshall says that there are two lizards left. They wait in the living room, where they notice the lizards are up in the [[attic]]. Marshall uses a [[ladder]] and water hose to lure the lizards out. Amy hears the lizards moving in the walls. Marshall grabs the gun and puts three holes in the wall with the butt of the gun. He uses the water hose to flush them out, causing a lizard to break out and Amy fires three rounds at it to no effect. The lizard charges at them, leaping onto Marshall, causing him to fall to the floor, with the lizard biting and scratching him. Amy grabs the water hose and blasts it off him. Marshall grabs a [[chair]] and the lizard spits venom in his eyes, but he manages to crush it multiple times. Amy takes Marshall into the kitchen and bandages his wounds, putting gauze over his eyes. She uses a piece of chicken as bait for the last lizard with a piece of string tied to it. The lizard takes the chicken, but the string breaks. Amy runs out of the closet, grabs it, and throws it into the fish tank where it eats the fishes. Its tail starts to attack her and she stomps on it. When the lizard starts to grow [[gills]], Amy throws a [[Light fixture|lamp]] into the tank and electrocutes it. She goes up into the attic and, finding more eggs, smashes them with a hammer. Amy and Marshall, believing they've won, fall asleep.  In the morning, Marshall wakes up to music coming from a car and meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Uri Romanov ([[Valery Nikolaev]]) outside. Uri grabs Marshall by the nose and orders him to leave. Marshall tries to stop him, but Uri leaves him unconscious on the ground. When Amy wakes up, she sees lizards hatching inside the closet and crushes them with a shoe. When she runs out of the bedroom, she finds Uri and grabs a kitchen knife, attempting to kill him. Uri grabs her, and forces her down on the kitchen counter, asking where is his money. Suddenly Marshall shows up with the rifle in his hands. Uri pulls out a [[M1911 pistol|pistol]] and tells him Amy's real name is Alex Langdon. Amy tells Uri that the money is in the bedroom closet, but when he goes into bedroom, he discovers that she tricked him. He forces them to the bed, and prevents them from leaving. Suddenly, lizards attack but Uri kills them with his guns. He again asks Amy where is the money; she replies that it is in the attic. Marshall goes up to fetch the money belt and throws it down to the floor. Uri picks it up, complaining it as wet and a bit light. Amy sprays him in the face with insect spray. They shove him into the fireplace and eggs fall on his head. A lizard breaks out of his mouth, and Amy shoots him in the face repeatedly. She gives Marshall the pistol for protection while he goes to pour gasoline in the bedroom and kitchen, where more lizards appear. When Amy looks in the money belt, a lizard pops out and she screams. Marshall throws the gas can into the oven and, on the third shot hits the can. His clothes catch on fire; Amy extinguishes his flaming clothes but the money also burns. They both escape in Uri's car as the cabin burns. The car starts to breaks down and Marshall goes to look under the hood, where he finds eggs hatching in it. Suddenly, lizards start pop out of various places inside the car, attacking Amy. Marshall tells her to unlock the door after she accidentally locked it in her panic. He takes the [[cigar]] she had lit while he was looking under the hood and throws it into the gas tank, blowing up the car while simultaneously killing the lizards.  Marshall carries an unconscious Amy through the snow to the general store and meet up with Mrs. Miller. While trying to warm Amy with electric blankets, he finds a lizards' tail sticking out of her leg. He grabs a pair of [[scissors]], and uses matches to heat them up. He sticks the scissors into her leg, creating a larger opening. He tells Mrs. Miller to put out the scissors and as she does so, Marshall pulls the lizard out of Amy's leg causing Amy to scream. He looks around the store with a shovel (since Mrs. Miller does not sell guns in her store) and accidentally knocks out the lights. Mrs. Miller goes to fetch a [[flashlight]] and is killed by the lizard. Marshall, upset about Mrs. Miller's death, puts on sunglasses and sets fire to a lighter fluid-soaked push broom. As he goes looking for the lizard, it again spits venom at him but instead hits the glasses and he takes them off. The lizard tries to jump on him but instead lands on the broom and Marshall pushes it into a corner. He pours more lighter fluid on the lizard as it burns. As he is walking away, the lizard spits more venom and puts the fire out. The lizard starts to come after him again, when he finds a [[flare gun]]. Before he can finish loading it, the lizard sends him to the floor, scratching and biting him. Suddenly, Amy shows up and grabs the flare gun, shooting the lizard in the mouth. Sent flying, the lizard hits the wall and explodes. Amy and Marshall collapse on the floor and kiss.

Appan's sister was married to Dathan Thampuran of Kanimangalam palace, who deserted her one day. The extreme hatred towards Kanimangalam had made Appan to even stop the annual temple festival, which according to the villagers has resulted in the anger of [[Goddess]], the local deity. Now, with the arrival of Jagannathan, Appan is back again creating troubles. But Jagannathan successfully overcomes it and gets the palace registered. Presently the palace is occupied by Krishna Varma ([[Oduvil Unnikrishnan]]), an old musician, and Unnimaya ([[Manju Warrier]]), his foster daughter. Unnimaya is believed to be the daughter of Dathan Thampuran, but is disowned by the rest of his family members. Though, now in the hands of Jagan, he allows Varma and Unnimaya to stay in the palace. Though, initially, both Varma and Unnimaya felt uncomfortable in staying with Jagan, slowly, they develop an affection towards him.  Within a short time, Jagan gets involved in the problems of the villagers and they started considering him to the heir of the palace and their leader. Jagannathan invites the ire of Appan Thamburan, with whom he clashes over the demolition of the palace, which he had earlier promised during the registration. Jagan, when expresses his desire to stay at Kanimangalam, Appan sends his henchmen, who had to humiliatingly return from Jagan. Now, the villagers decide to hold up the annual festival at the temple, after a long gap of 16 years. Jagannathan takes up the leadership and with the support of villagers, he starts the preparations. Within mean time, Unnimaya develops a closeness towards him. In the midst of this, Nayanthara ([[Priya Raman]]), a close friend of Jagan, reaches Kanimangalam from [[Bangalore]]. She expresses her desire to marry Jagan, which he declines, saying that he is now in love with Unnimaya. Nayanthara accepts his decision and goes back wishing him all the best for the future. According to the customs of the village, the festival puja should be done under a head priest from Keezhpayoor Mana, but when Appan Thamburan interferes, the members from Keezhpayoor refuses to conduct the puja, which makes Jagan to forcefully take the younger namboothiri ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]) from away from home on way back.  Suddenly Nandakumar lands down at Kanimangalam with his friends, one of whom harasses Unnimaya. This upsets Jagan, and, without Nandan's knowledge, he forcefully sends them back from Kanimangalam. In midst of this, the younger priest is taken away by Appan Thamburan's men. It is then revealed by Jagan that he is the son of the Kaloor Brahmadathan Namboothiripadu, the head priest of the temple, who died after being wrongly accused of stealing the divine ornaments of the Goddess. Jagan follows Ayinikad Namboothiri ([[Madampu Kunjukuttan]]), the astrologer's instructions and wears his Yagyopaveetham, the holy thread, and adopts back Brahmanyam.  The day of the festival arrives. Nandan, who had gone in search of his friends, is now back in an inebriated condition and furiously demands Jagan to leave the palace. Jagan pleads him one day's time, but Nandan is not ready to listen. Finding no other option,  Jagan locks up Nandan in a room and reaches the temple to perform the rituals. Kulappully Appan's henchmen attacks villagers. Jagan is helpless as he is supposed to control his emotions while performing the puja and holding the divine ornaments of the Goddess. The younger priest suddenly reappears and replaces Jagan in the puja so that Jagan can save the villagers. Jagan fights and saves the villagers, emerging as their leader. He then points his sword at Appan's neck and threatens to kill him if he ever comes back. The festival concludes successfully and the village is cheerful.  Nandan is released and Jagan announces the cheering crowd that it is not him, but Nandakumar, the original owner of the Kanimangalam palace and he is leaving the village with both Unnimaya and Krishna Varma. But, Nanda Kumar, who is overwhelmed by seeing the affection of the people for Jagan, calls him back and hands over the ownership to him.

Absolute Power (film)
  During the course of a burglary, master jewel thief Luther Whitney ([[Clint Eastwood]]) is forced to hide upon the unexpected arrival of Christy Sullivan ([[Melora Hardin]]), the beautiful young wife of elderly billionaire Walter Sullivan ([[E. G. Marshall]]), during her drunken rendezvous with Alan Richmond ([[Gene Hackman]]), the [[President of the United States]]. Walter Sullivan is Richmond's friend and financial supporter, and the owner of the mansion Luther has broken into. Hiding inside a large bedroom vault with a [[one-way mirror]], Luther watches as Richmond becomes sexually violent towards Christy and she attacks him with a letter opener in self-defense. Richmond screams for help, and Secret Service agents Bill Burton ([[Scott Glenn]]) and Tim Collin ([[Dennis Haysbert]]) burst into the bedroom and shoot Christy to death. [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] Gloria Russell ([[Judy Davis]]) arrives, and they agree to stage the scene to look like a burglary gone wrong. They are unaware of Luther until he begins his escape. Both agents chase Luther, but he escapes with millions in jewelry, collectible coins and cash as well as the incriminating letter opener.  The next day, Detective Seth Frank ([[Ed Harris]]) begins his investigation of the crime. Luther quickly becomes a prime suspect in the burglary because of his reputation as a master thief, but Frank does not believe Luther is a murderer. Just as Luther is about to flee the country, he sees President Richmond on television, publicly commiserating with Walter on his loss. Incensed by the fake sympathy, Luther decides to bring the President to justice. Meanwhile, Burton asks Frank to keep him informed about the case while a Secret Service agent wiretaps Frank's office telephone.  Luther's estranged daughter Kate ([[Laura Linney]]), who works as a [[prosecutor]], accompanies Frank to Luther's home to search for clues. Photographs in the house indicate that Luther has secretly been watching her for years. She still suspects Luther of the crime and therefore agrees to set him up. Frank guarantees Luther's safety, but through the wiretap Burton learns of the plan, and Collins prepares a [[Sniper|sniping attack]]. Someone also tips off Walter, who hires a [[hitman]] ([[Richard Jenkins]]) to kill Luther. The two snipers, each unaware of the other, try to shoot Luther when he arrives at an outdoor cafe to meet his daughter. They both miss, and Luther escapes through the police cordon wearing the uniform of a police officer he had hidden beneath his coat. Luther later explains to Kate exactly how Christy was killed and by whom.  Luther begins to taunt Russell, first by sending her a photograph of the letter opener, then tricking her into wearing Christie's diamond necklace during a public event at the [[White House]]. Correctly suspecting that Kate knows the truth, President Richmond decides she must be eliminated. When Luther learns from Detective Frank that the Secret Service has taken over surveillance of Kate, he races back to Washington D.C. to protect her. He arrives at her jogging area just moments after Collin has used his SUV to push her and her car off a cliff. Collin tries to kill her again at the hospital with a poison-filled syringe. Luther, who is waiting for such an attack, subdues Collin by jabbing him in the neck with a syringe of his own. Collin pleads for mercy, but Luther instead delivers a fatal dose.  Luther incapacitates Walter's chauffeur and replaces him, telling Walter what happened on the night his wife was killed. Walter is unconvinced until Luther explains how Richmond lied in his speech by citing Christy's excuse for staying home, which he could only have learned from her. He shows Walter the letter opener with Richmond's blood and fingerprints on it and also informs him that he has since returned the items he had stolen.  Luther stops the car and hands over the letter opener, dropping off Walter outside the [[White House]]. Walter, who is absolutely trusted by everyone in the White House, is able to get through security with the letter opener and enter the Oval Office. Meanwhile, alerted by Luther that his phones have been bugged, Frank discovers that a remorseful Burton has committed [[suicide]] and uses the evidence Burton left behind to arrest Russell. On television the next morning comes the shocking news, "confirmed" by Walter, that the President committed suicide by stabbing himself to death.

Affliction (1997 film)
 The film begins with a voice-over narration by Rolfe Whitehouse, announcing the story of his brother Wade's "strange criminal behavior" and subsequent disappearance.  Wade Whitehouse is a small-town policeman in [[New Hampshire]]. On [[Halloween]] night, Wade meets his daughter Jill from his divorced marriage, but he is late and the evening is overshadowed by disharmony. Jill eventually calls her mother to come and pick her up. When his ex-wife finally arrives, Wade shoves her lover against their car and watches them drive away with Jill. Wade vows to get a lawyer to help gain custody of his daughter.  The next day, Wade rushes to the scene of a crime. A hunting guide named Jack claims that the man with whom he was hunting accidentally shot and killed himself. The police believe Jack, but Wade grows suspicious, believing that the man's death was no accident. When he is informed that the victim was scheduled to testify in a lawsuit, his suspicion slowly turns into conviction.  A while later, Wade and his girlfriend Margie Fogg arrive at the house of Wade's father, Glen Whitehouse, whose abusive treatment of Wade and Rolfe as children is seen in flashbacks throughout the film. Wade finds his mother lying dead in her bed from hypothermia. Glen Whitehouse reacts to her death with little surprise. At the funeral wake, the father gets drunk and loudly exclaims, "Not one of you is worth one hair on that woman's head!", resulting in a confrontation between himself and Wade.  Rolfe, who has come home for the funeral, suggests at first that Wade's murder theory could be correct, but later renounces himself of this presumption. Nonetheless, Wade becomes obsessed with his conviction. When Wade learns that town Selectman Gordon Lariviere is buying up property all over town with the help from a wealthy land developer, he makes the solving of these incidents his personal mission. Suffering from a painful toothache and becoming increasingly socially detached, he behaves more and more unpredictably. He follows Jack, convinced that Jack is running away from something and is involved in a [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]. After a car chase, a nervous Jack finally pulls over, threatens Wade with a rifle, shoots out his tires, and drives off.  Finally, Wade is fired from his police job both for his constant harassment of Jack and his trashing of Lariviere's office. He collects Jill from her mother's house, where his ex-wife furiously castigates his plans to sue for full custody. At the local restaurant, he attacks the bartender in front of his daughter after he jokingly insults Wade. Then Wade takes Jill home to find Margie leaving him. Wade grabs Margie and begs her to stay with him, but Jill rushes up and tries to push Wade away. In response, Wade pushes Jill, causing her nose to bleed. She and Margie drive off. Wade is then approached by his father Glen, who congratulates him for finally acting as a "real man". The latent aggression between the men culminates in a fight in which Wade accidentally kills his father. He burns the corpse in the barn, sits down at the kitchen table and starts drinking, while the barn can be seen burning down through a window.  Rolfe's narration reveals that Wade eventually murdered Jack and left town (possibly to Canada, where Jack's truck was found three days later), never to return. Rolfe relates that the town later became part of a huge ski resort partly organized by Gordon Lariviere. He concludes that someday a vagrant resembling Wade might be found frozen to death, and that will be the end of the story.

To be a king he must marry a princess, so Farquaad resolves to marry Princess Fiona, who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. He organizes a tournament wherein the winner gets the "privilege" of rescuing Fiona for him. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and compels them under threat of death to rescue Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.

She finds that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill during the night. Fiona accepts Farquaad's proposal, requesting that they be married before night falls. The couple return to Duloc, while a hurt and angry Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.

Air Force One (film)
 A U.S. and Russian joint military operation results with special forces capturing General Ivan Radek ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]), the dictator of [[Kazakhstan]]. Three weeks later, a diplomatic dinner is held in [[Moscow]] to celebrate the capture of the Kazakh dictator, at which [[President of the United States]] James Marshall ([[Harrison Ford]]) expresses his regret that action had not been taken sooner to prevent the suffering caused by Radek. He also vows that his administration will take a firmer stance against [[despotism]] and that they will never negotiate with [[Terrorism|terrorists]].   President Marshall, along with his wife Grace ([[Wendy Crewson]]), daughter Alice ([[Liesel Matthews]]), and several of his Cabinet and advisors, board [[Air Force One]] to return to the [[United States]]. In addition, a number of members of the press corps have been invited aboard. [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] agent Gibbs ([[Xander Berkeley]]), acting as a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] for a group of six Radek loyalists led by Ivan Korshunov ([[Gary Oldman]]), sneaks them onto the plane disguised as journalists. Once in flight, Gibbs kills several Secret Service agents guarding the plane's armory, allowing Korshunov and his men to seize weapons and start a massive shootout. The pilots, [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Axelrod (Michael Ray Miller) and [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Ingraham ([[Carl Weintraub]]), attempt an emergency landing at [[Ramstein Air Base]] in [[Germany]]. However, the terrorists breach the cockpit and murder them, and take control, diverting the plane towards [[Kazakhstan]]. Secret Service agents race a reluctant Marshall down to an [[escape pod]] in the [[cargo hold]], where he seemingly escapes as the pod is ejected. The passengers and crew are taken hostage by the hijackers and imprisoned in the conference room. Believing the President has escaped, Korshunov separates Grace and Alice from the rest of the hostages and takes them to the communications room at the cockpit, planning to use them as [[Leverage (negotiation)|leverage]]. Several [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15s]] escort Air Force One as the terrorists have it piloted towards Radek-loyal airspace.  In [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Kathryn Bennett ([[Glenn Close]]) arrives at the [[White House]], taking command of the situation in the [[White House Situation Room]] with [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Defense Secretary]] Walter Dean ([[Dean Stockwell]]) and other officials. Korshunov contacts Bennett and demands Radek's release, threatening to execute a hostage every half hour. Meanwhile, the U.S. military locates the escape pod but finds it empty. Unbeknownst to the hijackers, Marshall, a retired military aviator, [[Vietnam veteran|veteran of the Vietnam War]], and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient, had remained on board by hiding in the cargo hold. He kills two of Korshunov's men and contacts the White House via [[satellite phone]], reminding Bennett not to negotiate with the terrorists.  Marshall dumps some of the plane's fuel reserve in an attempt to force a landing. Instead, Korshunov demands a [[Aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]]. Marshall gains access to the conference room where the hostages are being held and he, along with his military advisors, including Major Caldwell ([[William H. Macy]]) and [[Chief of Staff]] Lloyd Shepherd ([[Paul Guilfoyle]]) devise a plan to trick the hijackers into taking Air Force One to a lower altitude for the refueling, allowing the hostages to parachute safely off the plane. Gibbs, hiding his true loyalties, joins them. Marshall sends a fax to the White House, directing the tanker to instruct the terrorists to drop from an altitude of 30,000 to 15,000 feet- low enough for the hostages to parachute to safety without suffocating. As a [[KC-10 Extender|KC-10]] tanker docks with Air Force One, Marshall and his advisors escort the hostages to the cargo hold, where the majority parachute away to safety, while Marshall, Caldwell, Shepherd, and Gibbs remain on board Air Force One; Korshunov discovers the deception and forces the plane away, causing the fuel to ignite and destroying the tanker.  The group is recaptured, and Marshall reunites with his family. Korshunov beats Marshall and explains his actions, claiming that the collapse of the Soviet Union ruined his country. Korshunov demands that Marshall contact [[President of Russia|Russian President]] Petrov (Alan Woolf) to arrange for Radek's release. Marshall gives in to Korshunov's demands to save Alice. Bennett is urged by Dean to declare the President incapable under the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th amendment]], so as to override Radek's release, but she refuses. While Korshunov and his men are distracted by the news of Radek's release, Marshall breaks free and kills the last two of Korshunov's men. Korshunov tries to shoot Marshall, but Shepherd dives in and takes the bullet himself, saving the President's life. As the wounded Shepherd is tended to by Alice, Gibbs, and Caldwell, Korshunov drags Grace down to the plane's parachute ramp, where he dons a parachute and dumps the rest off the plane to ensure no one escapes. Marshall arrives and Grace manages to distract Korshunov, giving Marshall the opportunity to disarm him. In the ensuing fight, Marshall kills Korshunov by wrapping a strap around his neck and activating his parachute, pulling him outwards and breaking his neck. Marshall races back to contact Petrov and rescind his order, and Radek is fatally shot while attempting to flee custody.  With his family safe and Gibbs tending to Shepherd's wound, Marshall, with Caldwell's help, directs the plane back toward friendly airspace, but Bennett alerts them of a squadron of Radek loyalist-piloted [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29s]] tailing them. The F-15s race to protect Air Force One, but the plane sustains heavy damage; one MiG ruptures Air Force One's fuel tanks, causing the plane to lose fuel, and when one F-15 pilot sacrifices himself to intercept a [[R-73 (missile)|missile]] heading for Air Force One, shrapnel from the resulting explosion destroys its tail controls, rendering landing impossible. A nearby patrolling [[Air Force Special Operations Command|U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command]] [[Lockheed MC-130#MC-130E Combat Talon I|MC-130E Combat Talon]] is called in to rescue Marshall and the others via [[zip-line]]. The MC-130 sends [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescuemen]] on tether lines to help rescue the survivors. After Grace, Alice and the injured Shepherd are evacuated, Marshall, Gibbs, and Caldwell remain on the plane, with only enough time for one to be rescued. Caldwell tells Marshall to go, but Gibbs reveals himself as the mole and kills Caldwell and the pararescueman, and attempts to save himself on the last remaining zip-line. Marshall overpowers Gibbs and attaches himself to the line, before the hook attaching it to the plane breaks off. Air Force One crashes into the [[Caspian Sea]], killing Gibbs. The MC-130 airmen reel Marshall onto the MC-130, where he falls into his family's waiting arms. Everyone in the [[White House Situation Room]] celebrate as confirmation of Marshall’s rescue is broadcast over the plane's speakers, and Bennett tears up the presidential incapacity order. The MC-130 is subsequently dubbed with the call sign of Air Force One, and flies safely away with the First Family aboard, with its F-15 escorts.

Hoping to abuse Buddy's newfound fame, he forces Jackie to hand over Buddy, using papers proving that he is Buddy's legal owner. Knowing they do not have a choice, Jackie forces Josh to give Buddy back to Snively. After noticing that he's feeling withdrawn and depressed, Jackie regrets making Josh give up Buddy. Josh decides to rescue Buddy, suspecting he's being abused by Snively. He sneaks into Snively's backyard and finds Buddy chained up and abused again. Snively catches Josh escaping with Buddy, and pursues them in his dilapidated clown truck before crashing into a lake. Josh then decides to set Buddy free in the forest to find a new home. Initially, his team is losing at the next championship to the opposing team, which Larry turns out to have joined. Then Buddy returns for a joyful reunion for Josh and the team. When it is discovered that there is no rule that a dog can't play basketball, Buddy joins the roster and leads the team to a come from behind championship victory, with Josh scoring the game-winning buzzer beater.   Snively arrives and attempts to sue the Framm family for custody of Buddy, despite that his ownership papers were ruined when he crashed into the lake. Upon seeing Buddy, Judge Cranfield is disgusted and initially reluctant to judge a case over a dog, but agrees only under a strict condition that the case be executed seriously. During the trial, Josh protests against letting Snively have Buddy, mentioning the abuse that Buddy has suffered under him, including chaining Buddy to his fence. Jackie also protests, mentioning that Buddy was much happier with their family, and that she too has seen how abusive Snively is. After hearing a number of people protest against Snively, Cranfield doesn't believe that neither one has any real evidence in claiming ownership to Buddy. Soon, Chaney arrives and suggests that Buddy chooses his owner. As a fan of Chaney, Cranfield accepts his proposal and moves the court outside to the front lawn for Buddy to choose. Buddy attacks Snively and chooses Josh. When Snively angrily attempts to get Buddy back by force, police officers quickly stop him. Convinced by what he's witnessed, Cranfield orders for Snively to be arrested for [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]], while Josh and the rest of the citizens rejoice and gather around Buddy to welcome him to his new home.

Alien Resurrection
 In 2379, two hundred years after the events of ''[[Alien 3]]'', military scientists on the space vessel USM ''Auriga'' create a [[cloning|clone]] of [[Ellen Ripley]], designated Ripley 8, using [[DNA]] from blood samples taken before her death. The [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] queen's<ref>The alien species is referred to s "xenomorph" in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.</ref> DNA has been mixed in with Ripley's, and the clone grows up with an [[embryo]] inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As a result of the xenomorphs' DNA inside her, she has enhanced strength and reflexes, blood that is somewhat acidic and a psychic link with the xenomorphs. Additionally, the xenomorph's [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.  A group of [[mercenary|mercenaries]], Frank Elgyn, Johner, Christie, John Vriess (who constantly whistles "[[Popeye the Sailor Man|I'm Popeye the Sailor Man]]"), Sabra Hillard and Annalee Call, arrive at ''Auriga'' on their ship ''Betty''. They deliver several kidnapped humans in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. The military scientists use the humans as hosts for the Aliens, raising several adult Aliens for study.  The ''Betty'' crew soon encounters Ripley 8. Annalee Call recognizes her name and tries to kill her, suspecting she may be used to create xenomorphs, but is unaware the creatures have already been cloned. The xenomorphs, having matured, escape confinement by killing off one of their own to use their acidic blood to burn through their enclosures, aware of their blood's acidity from said genetic memory. They then capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman and kill a second scientist. They damage the ''Auriga'' and kill some of those people who do not evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Another crew member is cocooned for [[eggmorphing]]. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing this will unleash the xenomorphs on Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a Marine named DiStephano and a surviving xenomorph host, Purvis, decide to head for the ''Betty'' and use it to destroy the ''Auriga''. Along the way, Ripley 8 discovers a laboratory which contains the grotesque results of the previous seven failed attempts to clone Ellen Ripley. The surviving one begs Ripley 8 to euthanise her; she complies and then incinerates the lab and its contents.  As the group makes their way through the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is revealed to be an [[android (robot)|auton]], an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the ''Auriga''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s systems, Call sets it on a [[collision course]] with Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others head for the ''Betty''. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.  Ripley is taken to the Alien nest, where she finds Gediman, still alive and partially cocooned. The xenomorph queen, having developed a [[uterus]] as a result of her genetic contamination with Ripley 8, gives birth to a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph with overtly human traits]]. The hybrid xenomorph recognizes Ripley 8 as its mother, killing the queen and Gediman. Ripley 8 takes advantage of the distraction to escape, and makes her way to the ''Betty''.  The "newborn" reaches the ''Betty'' and attacks Call, killing DiStephano when he tries to help her. Ripley 8 finds her way onto the ship and saves Call by distracting the hybrid. Using her acidic blood, Ripley 8 melts a hole in a window and pushes the hybrid towards it. The decompression violently sucks the creature through the hole and out into space, killing it as Ripley 8 tearfully watches on.  The countdown on the ''Auriga'' continues as the survivors escape in the ''Betty''. The ''Auriga'' collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. As they look down at Earth, Call asks what Ripley 8 wants to do next. "I'm a stranger here myself," she replies.

All's Well, Ends Well 1997
 Kung ([[Stephen Chow]]) is the spoiled youngest brother of three: no job, no education, plenty of money, plenty of girlfriends, and a good home, whom he shares with the two brothers Lo Leung and Fei, his sister-in-law Yinsu (Lo Leung's unattractive wife), and his wise father, Mr. Lo.  On his upcoming birthday, as a cruel but well-executed prank, Leung and Fei will feign a [[lottery]] win worth $30 million using a useless ticket and a recorded tape bearing the lottery pick from a previous night, all as Kung's birthday present.  Excessive greed causes Kung to fall for it, and he immediately (after trying to fool his family so he himself can have all the money) goes out with a selected girlfriend, Gigi, and hits it off at a night club.  Instead he runs afoul of [[Triad society|Triad]] member Brother Smartie, who wants a game of dice.  Kung easily loses $1 million, as well as $5000 to Gigi, and he relies on his "winnings" in order to pay it all back.  When he finally discovers he never won the lottery (much to his shock and dismay), he decides to fake being mentally retarded, a feat which he pulls off quite well.  Then he learns he gains more benefits that way, so he chooses to remain mentally ill for the time being.  However, he has to learn the true meaning of life and to take what life has to offer but not ask for more.  
All My Lenins
 In 1908, the young [[Estonia]]n politician [[Aleksander Kesküla]] ([[Üllar Saaremäe]]) has escaped from Estonia, then part of the [[czarist]] Russian empire, to [[Switzerland]]. Kesküla is strongly concerned about the national oppression in the Russian empire. It is also the point of view of the famous Russian exile and [[bolshevik]], [[Vladimir Lenin]]. (This role was played by [[Viktor Sukhorukov]]). Lenin believes [[czarist]] Russia to be "the prison of nations". Kesküla takes his last exams at the University of [[Bern]]. When World War I bursts into flame, Lenin views the Russian and German bourgeoisies to both have caused the war and so he begins to agitate "to end war even if Russia will be defeated."  Kesküla sees his great historical chance and intends to use Lenin's leftist radicals in forwarding the revolution of the Russian empire.  He elaborates mania grandiosa type plans in order to exterminate Russia forever and build upon the ruins of the great empire Gross-Estland (Great Estonia).  The empire would incorporate all former [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Fenno-Ugric]] territories, including [[Saint Petersburg]].  At first, he acts between Lenin and the German government to use German money to ignite revolutionary flames in Russia.  Kesküla and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs make a deal to support Lenin financially: to pay for the brochures, leaflets and books of the [[Bolshevik Party]]. Lenin accepts German help but cannot really imagine in which he implicates himself.  The Germans place their super-spy Müller ([[Andrus Vaarik]]) as the coordinator of the project. Kesküla and Müller educate five Russian men as Lenin's counterparts ([[doppelgängers]]). They want to be sure they can replace the real Lenin any moment something happens to him, and so they insure their rear. Thus develops the philosophical concept: counterparts are funny but dangerous. They could replace you any moment that anybody notices you seem to be an inconvenient character (like real Lenin was).  
Amistad (film)
 ''La Amistad'' is the name of a slave ship traveling from Cuba to the United States in 1839. It is carrying African slaves as its cargo. As the ship is crossing from Cuba to the United States, [[Joseph Cinqué|Cinqué]], a leader of the Africans, leads a mutiny and takes over the ship. The mutineers spare the lives of two Spanish navigators to help them sail the ship back to Africa. Instead, the navigators misdirect the Africans and sail north to the east coast of the United States, where the ship is stopped by the American Navy, and the living Africans imprisoned as runaway slaves.  In an unfamiliar country and not speaking a single word of English, the Africans find themselves in a legal battle. District Attorney [[William S. Holabird]] brings charges of piracy and murder. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Forsyth (Georgia)|John Forsyth]], on behalf of President [[Martin Van Buren]] (who is campaigning for re-election), represents the claim of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] that the Africans are slaves and are property of Spain based on a treaty. Two Naval officers,  Thomas R. Gedney, and Richard W. Meade, claim them as salvage while the two Spanish navigators, Pedro Montez and Jose Ruiz,  produce proof of purchase. A lawyer named [[Roger Sherman Baldwin]], hired by the abolitionist [[Lewis Tappan]] and his black associate Theodore Joadson, decides to defend the Africans.  Baldwin argues that the Africans had been captured in Africa to be sold in the Americas illegally. Baldwin proves through documents found hidden aboard ''La Amistad'' that the African people were initially cargo belonging to a Portuguese slave ship, the ''[[Tecora]]''. Therefore, the Africans were free citizens of another country and not slaves at all. In light of this evidence, the staff of President Van Buren has the judge presiding over the case replaced by Judge Coglin, who is younger and believed to be impressionable and easily influenced. Consequently, seeking to make the case more personal, on the advice of former American president (and lawyer) [[John Quincy Adams]], Baldwin and Joadson find [[James Covey]], a former slave who speaks both Mende and English. Cinque tells his story at trial: Cinque was kidnapped by slave traders outside his village, and held in the slave fortress of [[Lomboko]], where thousands of captives were held under heavy guard. Cinque and many others were then sold to the ''Tecora'', where they were held in the brig of the ship. The captives were beaten and whipped, and at times, were given so little food that they had to eat the food from each other's faces. One day, 50 captives were thrown overboard. Later on, the ship arrived in Havana, Cuba. Those captives that were not sold at auction were handed over to ''La Amistad''.  District Attorney Holabird attacks Cinqué's "tale" of being captured and kept in the slave fortress, and especially questions the throwing of precious cargo overboard. However, the [[Royal Navy]]'s fervent abolitionist Captain Fitzgerald of the [[West Africa Squadron]] backs up Cinqué's account. Baldwin shows from the ''Tecora''s inventory that the number of African people taken as slaves was reduced by 50. Fitzgerald explains that some slave ships when interdicted do this to get rid of the evidence for their crime. But in the ''Tecora''s case, they had underestimated the amount of provisions necessary for their journey. As the tension rises, Cinqué stands up from his seat and repeatedly cries, "Give us, us free!"  Judge Coglin rules in favor of the Africans. After pressure from Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]] on President Van Buren, the case is appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Despite refusing to help when the case was initially presented, Adams agrees to assist with the case. At the Supreme Court, he makes an impassioned and eloquent plea for their release, and is successful.  The [[Lomboko|Lomboko slave fortress]] is liberated by the [[Royal Marines]] under the command of Captain Fitzgerald. After all the slaves were hurried out of the fortress, Fitzgerald orders the ship's cannon to destroy it. He then dictates a letter to Forsyth saying that he was right—the slave fortress doesn't exist.  Because of the release of the Africans, Van Buren loses his re-election campaign, and tension builds between the North and the South, which would eventually culminate in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  
An American Werewolf in Paris
 Andy McDermott is a tourist seeing the sights of [[Paris]] with his friends Brad and Chris. When Serafine Pigot leaps off the [[Eiffel Tower]] just before Andy is about to [[bungee jump]], he executes a mid-air rescue. She vanishes into the night, leaving Andy intrigued – unaware that she is the daughter of David Kessler and Alex Price, the couple seen 16 years earlier in [[An American Werewolf in London|the first film]]. That night, Andy, Chris, and Brad attend a night club called "Club de la Lune". The club's owner, Claude, is actually the leader of a [[werewolf]] society that uses the club as a way to lure in people (preferably tourists) to be killed. Serafine arrives, tells Andy to run away and transforms into a werewolf. The club owners transform into werewolves, as well, and butcher all the guests. Chris escapes and goes back to Serafine's house. Brad is killed by a werewolf, and Andy is bitten by another werewolf when he tries to escape.  The next day, Andy wakes up at Serafine's house. Serafine blends raw meat in the blender, and he is still in shock, but Serafine allows him to feel her breasts to calm him down. She tells him he's transforming into a werewolf. This is interrupted by the sudden appearance of the ghost of Serafine's mother Alex. Andy jumps out the window in sheer panic and begins running away.  Chris tries to get his attention, but Claude grabs him and holds his hand over his mouth and takes him to the basement.  Soon, Brad's ghost appears to Andy and explains Andy's werewolf condition. For Andy to become normal again, he must eat the heart of the werewolf that bit him; and, for Brad's ghost to be at rest, the werewolf that killed him must be killed, too. After developing an appetite for raw meat, Andy hooks up with an American tourist named Amy ([[Julie Bowen]]), but he transforms and kills her. Andy also kills a cop who had been tailing him, suspecting Andy was involved in the Club de la Lune massacre. Andy is arrested but escapes. He begins to see Amy's ghost, as well; and she begins trying to kill him.  Claude and his henchmen ask Andy to join their society; but, to prove his loyalty, Andy must kill Chris. Serafine rescues Andy, explaining that her stepfather prepared a drug to control werewolf transformations; but, instead, the drug forces werewolves to immediately transform into their beast form. As a result, she killed her mother and savaged her stepfather. Claude and the other werewolves raid Serafine's stepfather's lab and kill him, taking the drug to transform immediately.  Serafine and Andy learn of a [[Fourth of July]] party Claude has planned and infiltrate it. They help the partygoers escape; and Andy manages to kill the werewolf that ate Brad's heart, thus setting Brad free. The cops arrive, and a fight ensues. Andy and Serafine manage to kill many werewolves, with Serafine shifting to her beast form to fight when she runs out of ammunition. During a fight between Serafine and Claude, Andy shoots one of the wolves; but it turns out that he has shot Serafine. As she reverts to her human form she begs him to kill her but he is unable to and authorities who arrive on the scene assume that he is trying to kill her before escaping.  Claude makes his way onto a subway train, but he slips onto the tracks. A train slams into him, causing him to transform back to a human. He tries to take another dose of the drug, but Andy stops him. As they fight, Andy discovers that Claude is the werewolf that bit him (due to a scar on his left shoulder which Andy stabbed the werewolf with a spear) Claude tries to inject himself with the drug but accidentally injects Andy instead. Andy transforms into a werewolf, kills Claude and eats his heart and howls, breaking the werewolf curse. Serafine is taken in an ambulance, but she begins to show signs of transforming. The [[Emergency Medical Technician|EMT]], thinking she is going into shock, administers [[adrenaline]], which stops the transformation. The "cure" turned out to be a sedative, which triggered the change; and adrenaline has the opposite effect.   The final scene depicts Serafine and Andy celebrating their wedding atop the [[Statue of Liberty]] with Andy's pal Chris, who survives. The couple seem to be controlling the curse with a steady application of adrenaline-fueled activities. They bungee jump off it as the credits roll.  In an [[alternate ending]], after Andy eats Claude's heart, Serafine has a vision of her step-father in the back of an ambulance, explaining how he found a cure before his death. The new closing scene shows Serafine and Andy having a child, whose eyes shift to look like the werewolves'.

Amityville Dollhouse
 Newlyweds Bill and Claire Martin move their new family into a new house constructed by Bill himself. Shortly after moving in Bill finds a doll house (modeled after [[The Amityville Horror|112 Ocean Avenue]]) in the shed. He brings it in the house and puts it in the garage. Later that night, Bill notices the fireplace in the house turns on by itself, heating the entire home. He has a hallucination of his daughter Jessica burning to death in the fireplace. The following morning, Claire finds the dollhouse in the garage and suggests giving it to Jessica for her birthday. At her birthday party, Jessica's aunt Marla and uncle Tobias arrive. Jessica is elated over the dollhouse and finds a chest of miniature dolls inside it: her aunt and uncle, however, seem inexplicably nervous regarding the toys.   In the ensuing days, numerous strange incidents occur: Jimmy, Claire's eldest son, loses his pet mouse, which finds its way into the dollhouse; simultaneously, Jessica is confronted by an enormous white mouse hiding under her bed. Claire also begins to have unexpected [[Sexual desire|sexual urges]] toward Todd, Bill's eldest son, and fantasizes about him while having sex with Bill. Bill is also plagued by nightmares about [[voodoo doll]]s, demons, and his family being murdered. In conversation with Marla, Bill reveals he suffered from similar dreams as a child, including a [[precognition|premonitory dream]] of his parents dying in a fire, which came true. Jimmy also experiences supernatural visitations from his deceased father, who appears to him as a decaying zombie, urging him to murder Bill.   One afternoon, Todd brings his girlfriend Dana to the home. While in an exterior shed on the property, the two find newspaper clippings about the foundation on which Bill built their new home: they surmise that the new house was built around the fireplace from the original home. The two go in the house and begin to have sex, but are attacked by a giant fly. The following evening, Bill and Claire go out for dinner, leaving Todd to babysit his younger siblings, Jimmy and Jessica. Todd invites Dana over and sends the children to bed. While Todd makes [[cocktail]]s in the kitchen, Dana's hair inexplicably catches fire, leaving her with disfiguring burns. Todd blames his father for the accident, believing it was caused by a faulty coil in the fireplace's gas line.  Meanwhile, Marla and Tobias, both of whom apparently practice magic, have taken one of the dolls from Jessica's dollhouse. They perform a ritual on the doll and watch it come to life. Objects begin to fly around their home and Tobias stabs the doll with a knife, after which a large fly escapes. Later, Claire finds an unexplained bruise on Jimmy's face and believes Bill hit him. She shuts him out of the house, only to be confronted by the zombie of her deceased husband, who ties both her and Jimmy up and forces them to sit in front of the fireplace. Bill attempts to enter the house through the garage, but is knocked unconscious by [[carbon monoxide]] fumes from his car, which begins running by itself. Tobias arrives at the home and is able to save Bill. The two enter the home: with him, Tobias has the voodoo doll he had taken from the dollhouse.  Tobias and Bill fight with the zombie, and Jimmy throws the voodoo doll into the fireplace, causing the zombie to disappear. Todd is then visited by an apparition of Dana, who is in the hospital: she attempts to kill him, but Claire intercedes. The family attempts to flee the house, but cannot find Jessica. Scrawled on a piece of paper, they find a list of observations Jessica has made about the dollhouse, one of which reads: "My hand disappears in the fireplace." Bill realizes the fireplace is a [[Portals in fiction|portal to somewhere else]]. Bill and Tobias enter the fireplace and realize they have in fact entered the dollhouse. They find Jessica on the floor, surrounded by bloodied remnants of the voodoo dolls. Tobias casts a protective spell, allowing Bill and Jessica to flee: Tobias, however, is dragged away by the demons that have escaped from the dolls. Bill destroys the dollhouse by tossing it into the fireplace. As they flee in their car, the house explodes behind them.

 In 1916 [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]], [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] hosts a ball at the [[Catherine Palace]] to celebrate the [[300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty|Romanov tricentennial]]. His mother, the [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]], is visiting from [[Paris, France]] and gives a music box and a necklace inscribed with the words “Together in Paris” as parting gifts to her youngest granddaughter, 8-year-old [[Grand Duchess Anastasia]]. The ball is suddenly interrupted by the sorcerer [[Grigori Rasputin]], the former royal adviser to the Romanovs until he was [[exile|exiled]] for [[treason]]. Seeking revenge, Rasputin [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul]] in exchange for an unholy [[reliquary]], which he uses to place a curse on the [[House of Romanov|Romanov family]], sparking the [[Russian Revolution]]. During the siege of the palace, only Marie and Anastasia are able to escape with the aid of 10-year-old servant boy Dimitri, who shows them a secret passageway in Anastasia's bedroom. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on a frozen river, only to fall through the ice and drown. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but only Marie climbs aboard while Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform and suffering [[amnesia]].  Ten years later, Russia is under [[Soviet Union|communist rule]] and Marie has publicly offered 10 million [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] for the safe return of her granddaughter. Dimitri and his friend/partner-in-crime Vladimir search for an Anastasia look-alike to bring to Paris so they can collect the reward. Elsewhere, Anastasia — now 18 years old and using the name "Anya" — leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up, still suffering from amnesia. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names "Pooka", she decides to head to Paris, inspired by the inscription on the necklace she still has, but finds she is unable to leave Russia without an [[exit visa]]. An old woman advises her to see Dimitri at the abandoned palace, where he and Vladimir have made residence; there, the two men are impressed by her resemblance to the "real" Anastasia, and decide to take her with them to Paris.  Bartok, Rasputin's albino bat minion, is nearby and notices his master's dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anastasia's presence; it drags him to limbo, where Rasputin survives. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends his demonic minions from the reliquary to kill her; despite two attempts, the trio manage to (unwittingly) foil his plans, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel back to the surface.  The trio eventually reach Paris and go to meet Marie, who has given up the search after being tricked by numerous imposters. Despite this, Marie's cousin Sophie quizzes Anastasia to confirm her identity. Though Anastasia offers every answer taught to her, Dimitri finally realizes she is the real Anastasia when she (without being taught to) vaguely recalls how he helped her escape the palace siege. Sophie, also convinced, arranges a meeting with Marie at the [[Palais Garnier]] Opera house. There, Dimitri tries to establish an introduction but Marie refuses, having already heard of Dimitri's initial scheme to con her. Anastasia overhears the conversation and angrily leaves. Dimitri kidnaps Marie and takes her to see Anastasia, who regains her memories as they converse. Convincing the empress of her identity, the two are joyfully reunited.  Marie offers Dimitri the reward money the next day, recognizing him as the servant boy who saved them; to her surprise, he refuses it and leaves for Russia. At Anastasia's return celebration, Marie informs her of Dimitri's gesture, leaving Anastasia torn between staying or going with him. Pooka suddenly runs off; Anastasia chases him to the [[Pont Alexandre III]], where she is trapped and attacked by Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save her, but is soon injured and knocked unconscious. In the struggle, Anastasia manages to get hold of Rasputin's reliquary and crush it under her foot, avenging her family as Rasputin disintegrates and dies.  In the aftermath, Dimitri and Anastasia reconcile; they elope, and Anastasia sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie, promising to return one day. The couple are then seen kissing on a riverboat. Bartok shares a kiss with a female bat before bidding the audience farewell.  
Anaconda (film)
 A poacher ([[Danny Trejo]]) hides from an anaconda in his boat. While it breaks through the boat, the poacher commits suicide.  While shooting a documentary about a long-lost Indigenous tribe, the Shirishamas, on the [[Amazon River]], director Terri Flores ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) and members of her crew—including cameraman Danny Rich ([[Ice Cube]]), production manager Denise Kalberg ([[Kari Wuhrer]]), her boyfriend, sound engineer Gary Dixon ([[Owen Wilson]]), visionary Warren Westridge ([[Jonathan Hyde]]), anthropologist Professor Steven Cale ([[Eric Stoltz]]), and boat skipper Mateo ([[Vincent Castellanos]])—come across stranded [[Paraguay|Paraguayan]] snake hunter Paul Serone ([[Jon Voight]]) and help him, believing he knows how to find the tribe they are searching for.  Most of the crew are uncomfortable around Serone, and Cale clashes with him several times in regards to Shirishama lore. Later, while trying to free the boat's propeller from a rope, Cale is stung in the throat by a [[wasp]] inside his [[Diving regulator|scuba regulator]], which swells his throat shut and leaves him unconscious. Serone performs an emergency [[cricothyrotomy]], seemingly saving Cale's life. With that, Serone takes command of the boat and the crew. They are then forced to help him achieve his true objective—hunting down and capturing a record-breaking [[giant anaconda]] he had been tracking.  Mateo is the first of the crew to be killed by the anaconda, which coils around him and then breaks his neck near a boat where the poacher had been killed. A photograph in an old newspaper reveals that Mateo, Serone, and the unnamed poacher were working together to catch animals, including snakes. The others try to find him while Gary sides with Serone, who promises if they help him find the anaconda, he will help them get out alive. Later at night, the anaconda attacks the boat. When Serone attempts to capture the snake, it crushes Gary, killing and eating him, leaving Denise devastated. The survivors overcome Serone and tie him up. The next day, the boat becomes stuck at a waterfall, requiring Terri, Danny, and Westridge to enter the water to winch it loose. When Denise attempts to kill Serone as revenge for Gary's death, he gets the edge and strangles her to death with his legs before dumping her body in the river. When the anaconda returns, Westridge distracts it long enough for Terri and Danny to return to the boat while he ascends the waterfall. Danny and the freed Serone fight, as Westridge is coiled by the snake. Before it can kill him, the tree supporting the anaconda breaks, sending everyone into the water and waking up Cale. With Westridge killed in the fall, the snake coils itself around Danny, only to be shot in the head by Terri. An enraged Serone attacks Terri, only to be stabbed with the tranquilizer dart by Cale, who soon loses consciousness again. Danny punches the drugged Serone, knocking him into the river.  However, Terri and Danny are soon re-captured when Serone catches up to them. He dumps a bucket of monkey blood on them and uses them as bait in an attempt to capture a second, larger anaconda. The anaconda appears and coils itself around Terri and Danny and begins to suffocate them. They are caught in a net by Serone, but the snake breaks free. Serone tries to escape, but the anaconda finally manages to coil itself around him and suffocate him. Terri and Danny cut their bonds and watch in horror as the anaconda slowly swallows Serone whole. Terri finds a nest of baby (normal sized) anacondas in a building, but the snake arrives and, after regurgitating the still twitching Serone, chases her up a smoke stack. Danny traps the anaconda by pinning its tail to the ground with a [[pickaxe]]. Danny ignites a fire below the smoke shack and burns the snake alive. The burning anaconda is sent flying out of the building and plunges into the water where it sinks. As Terri and Danny recuperate on a nearby dock, the anaconda appears one final time before Danny slams a splitting maul into the snake's head, killing it. Afterwards, Terri and Danny reunite with Cale, who begins to revive on the boat. As they float down the river, they accidentally locate the natives for whom they were originally searching. They realize Serone was right and begin filming their documentary as the film ends.

Billy then learns that Santa's gift to him is Annabelle. When Billy sneezes in the barn, he is surprised to hear Annabelle say "bless you", revealing that animals can talk. The animals convince Billy not to reveal the secret, leading to Annabelle's shock of his inability to speak. Before she leaves, Agnes makes it clear to Grandpa that she wants Billy.  Emily's new snow sled is tied to Annabelle, who pulls it with Emily and Billy on board, but they crash into and destroy Mr. Holder's fence. Holder smugly wonders how Baker is going to pay for the damages to his fence and feed Annabelle. Holder then calls the sheriff.

Annabelle then decides what she wants to do next year when she meets Santa, followed by a dream of her flying throughout the sky.  The next morning, the animals lose their ability to talk, which makes Billy wonder if he imagined the whole thing. The sheriff and the Holders arrive with Mr. Holder demanding the money for fence repairs. Knowing that Baker does not have the money, Holder takes away Annabelle; the sheriff explains that if Baker can get the money to repair the fence in 24 hours then Annabelle will be returned. Billy is devastated as the Holder boys drag away Annabelle. Grandpa decides to sell a music box that belonged to his daughter (Billy's mother), even though it is the only thing he has left of her.

Winter comes again, and the Holder boys still bully Billy and Emily; Annabelle retaliates by knocking the boys into the snow. The boys try to feign innocence, but their father learns the truth about them and sends them to their room as punishment. The sheriff tells Holder that his attitude has turned his boys into lying bullies and that he has spread his misery to others through his actions. The sheriff also reveals that Baker had to sell his daughter's music box to retrieve Annabelle and that he should know the loss of a loved one, hinting that Holder lost his wife years ago. Holder feels ashamed.  In the city, Agnes' lawyer has discovered a loophole that will give Agnes custody of Billy by Christmas Day. Months pass until Christmas Eve, and Agnes shows up triumphantly at how she has obtained the right to care for Billy. The loophole states that Agnes will have custody of Billy and his welfare until he is able to speak and if Grandpa interferes she will call the police. The animals, overhearing this, push Agnes' car into a pond, delaying her plan until the next day. Grandpa and Billy are happy that they will at least spend one more Christmas together.  That evening, Santa arrives and once again gives the animals the ability to speak. Annabelle then whispers a wish into Santa's ear and asks him to fulfill it. On Christmas, Billy begins speaking again after opening a Christmas present box from Santa that contains magic dust.  Agnes arrives and is surprised to learn that her plans to take Billy are nullified. Billy goes to see Annabelle, but she can only moo now. Star explains that Annabelle permanently gave up her Christmas voice so he could speak again. When Billy asks about Annabelle's desire to fly, Star restates that hearing Billy speak was Annabelle's true wish.  Mr. Holder apologizes to Baker and reveals that after learning about the music box, he felt ashamed and decided to buy it for Baker as a Christmas present. Agnes meets Holder and his boys, and the narrator implies that she married Holder and became a stepmother to the boys.  Several years later, Billy grew up and married Emily and Annabelle became an old cow. It is then revealed that Billy is the narrator, and that he still talks to the animals, which baffles Emily.

The family leaves without informing Arunachalam which shocks him.  Arunachalam finds that his younger brother is trying to ditch his lover and he comes to her rescue. His brother refuses to marry her stating that she does not match his status and money. Arunachalam owes to bequeath his inheritance to her so that she will become equal to him which angers senior Sr.Vedhavalli. She discloses the truth that he has no right over anything he possess except the ''[[rudraksha]]'' which he is wearing in his neck as he is an orphan who was found in Arunachaleshwarar Temple in Thiruvannamalai and taken from his mother during her last breath who also named him Arunachalam. She also insults him and indirectly insists him to leave their house. Arunachalam is broken and hurt by the insult of Sr.Vedhavalli and leaves the house without informing anyone.  Arunachalam comes to Chennai and befriends Kathavarayan ([[Janagaraj (actor)|Janagaraj]]), a beeda seller who gives him a job. He meets Vedhavalli one day and goes to her home only to get insulted by Vedhavalli's father. Arunachalam meets a young girl Nandhini ([[Rambha (actress)|Rambha]]) when a thief snatches her hand bag. Nandhini thanks him and in return she promises a job in her dad's company. Next day Arunachalam goes to the office to meet Nadhini's father and he misses his ''rudraksh'' there. He chases the rolling ''rudraksh'' creating trouble to everyone in the office and finally his ''rudraksh'' lands in the table of Rangachari ([[Visu]]) who was discussing about transferring of some property belonging to some Vedhachalam to trust along with his colleagues. Arunachalam enters the meeting room and Rangachari is shocked to see Arunachalam. He enquire what is his name to which Arunachalam replies. Rangachari tells him that he is actually son of his boss Vedhachalam (also Rajnikanth), the heir of his entire property. Arunachalam and Rangachari's colleagues Kalaiperumal (V. K. Ramasamy), Prathap ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]), Kurain (Kitty) and Vishwanath ([[Raghuvaran]]) are shocked.  Rangachari explains that Arunachalam was lost when he was so young and he recognized him with the name mentioned by his father and resemblance of his father Vedhachalam. He tells that Vedhachalam instructed him to play a video tape when Arunachalam is found where Mr.Vedhachalam speaks about how he married Arunachalam's mother Meenakshi against his father's wish, how he got lost in a cruise accident and was misunderstood to be dead, how his mother committed suicide broken by her husband's demise. He got a letter of her which stated that they have a son named Arunachalam. He tells that he has two choices of bequeathing his legacy. Either by accepting a challenge of spending Rs.30 Crore in 30 days and take away 3000 Crore fulfilling the rules or take away just Rs.30 Crore. The reason of this challenge is to make him get allergic to money and the comforts of it, so that he would spend wisely 3,000 Crores for the poor and needy people.The rules for this challenge are no contributions to charities, not to own any assets at the end of the month, and, above all, no one else must know that he would get 3000 Crores if he completes the challenge.  Arunachalam initially refuses to take up the challenge and says the videotape is enough for him and decides to return to his village to proudly say about his father. However he overhears Vishwanath, Kurain, Prathap and Kalaiperumal talking about killing Rangachari to take away all the assets. Arunachalam understands their true intention and accepts the challenge to spend Rs.30 Crore in 30 days following the rules much to the quartet's shock. Arunachalam challenges them that he would win the challenge and expose them to the world. Nandhini is appointed as his assistant to take care of expenses.  From Day 1, Arunachalam starts to implement different tactics and spends lavishly, but the quartet group create all obstacles so that he does not win the challenge. Arunachalam invests the money in horse race which is a way to lose money easily in minutes. He deliberately bets on a weakest horse but due to quartet's plan, the weak horse wins earning him lot of money. Next he buys bumper prize lotteries which also gets him to win ample amount of money, He then produces a movie with his friend Arivazhagan hoping it will fail commercially. However his plan backfires due to the quartet who make him to earn more money from the selling rights. Finally he jumps into politics starting a party, nominating his friend Kattavarayan for upcoming election. He vigorously campaigns for him and lavishly spends all the money so fast. During a meeting, Katavaraayan's speech makes people angry on him and Arunachalam declares that he is apologizing them for nominating a wrong person and asks them not to vote for him. However the quartet group make the other nominees of election to withdraw and Katavarayan is elected as MP. Arunachalam is shocked now, as MP post and the party are both assets as per the challenge. But he makes Kathavarayan to resign the post and he dissolves his party destroying both assets.  Finally he is about to win and he spends final left overs in farewell party. Meanwhile, Vedhavalli gets angry on Arunachalam for not helping her and her family during their financial crisis and she doubts that he has affair with Nandhini. She consents to wedding with her father's choice. But Arunachalam does not reveal the truth to Vedhavalli as he wants to keep up his father's words. On the last day of handover, during final minutes, Arunachalam's friend comes to him with Rs.20,000 as per plan of quartet so that he cannot spend it at last minute. Nandhini arrives in nick of moment to inform the quartet plan and Arunachalam spends the money in last 30 seconds by paying the money to her as salary thus winning the challenge. Nandhini and Arunchalam explain Rangachari about the evil doings of quartet. Rangachari gets angry and warns to complaint against them in police but they threaten to kill them. After series of struggles and fights Arunachalam hands them over to police. Rangachari hands over the 30 billion property to him but he refuses to take it and asks him to spend to poor and needy as per his father's wish.

As Good as It Gets
 Melvin Udall is a [[Misanthropy|misanthrope]] who works at home as a best-selling novelist in [[New York City]]. He has [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a [[superstition]] of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological [[mysophobia|fear of germs]]. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly, the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior.  One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop, is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs, into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in [[Brooklyn]] so she can care for her acutely [[asthma]]tic son Spencer ("Spence"). Unable to adjust to another waitress, Melvin arranges through his publisher, whose husband is a doctor, to pay for her son's considerable medical expenses as long as Carol agrees to return to work. She is overwhelmed at his generosity, but is adamant that she will not sleep with Melvin.  Meanwhile, Simon's assault and rehabilitation, coupled with Verdell's preference for Melvin, causes Simon to lose his creative muse. Simon is approaching bankruptcy due to his medical bills. Frank persuades him to go to [[Baltimore]] to ask his estranged parents for money. Because Frank is too busy to take the injured Simon to Baltimore himself, Melvin reluctantly agrees to do so; Frank lends Melvin the use of his [[Saab 900#Variants|Saab 900 convertible]] for the trip. Melvin invites Carol to accompany them on the trip to lessen the awkwardness. She reluctantly accepts the invitation, and relationships among the three develop.  Once in Baltimore, Carol persuades Melvin to take her out to have dinner. Melvin's comments during the dinner greatly flatter—and subsequently upset—Carol, and she abruptly leaves. Upon seeing the frustrated Carol, Simon begins to sketch her semi-nude in his hotel room and rekindles his creativity, once more feeling a desire to paint. He briefly reconnects with his parents, but is able to tell them that he'll be fine.  After returning to New York, Carol tells Melvin that she does not want him in her life anymore. She later regrets her statement and calls him to apologize. The relationship between Melvin and Carol remains complicated until Simon (whom Melvin has allowed to move in with him until he can fully heal from his injuries and get a new apartment) persuades Melvin to declare his love for her. Melvin goes to see Carol, who is hesitant, but agrees to try and establish a relationship with him. The film ends with Melvin and Carol walking together. As he opens the door at an early morning pastry shop for Carol, he realizes that he has stepped on a crack in the pavement, but doesn't seem to mind.  
The Assignment (1997 film)
 The film opens to the sounds of a couple having sex. Afterwards, [[Carlos the Jackal]] kills a spider in its web with his cigarette and evicts the woman from his room because he claims he has work to do. He is seen donning a disguise, and he walks to a cafe where CIA officer Jack Shaw is sitting at a table outdoors. He recognizes Shaw and asks for a light. Shaw does not recognize Carlos, because of his disguise, but he turns to watch Carlos enter the cafe. He watches as Carlos detonates a grenade, killing dozens of people.  The film shows an event of  attacking the [[OPEC]] meeting by the Jackal and his followers in 1975.  In 1986 a man, looking like Carlos, is apprehended in an open-air market and brutally interrogated by a [[Mossad]] commander named Amos. The man claims to actually be a US Naval officer named Annibal Ramirez whose identification was lost in the chaos of his arrest. Amos confirms his identity and lets him go, stunned that Ramirez looks exactly like Carlos. Back at home, Ramirez is visited by Shaw who tries to recruit him to impersonate the terrorist leader. Ramirez, however, is deeply embittered by his rough treatment at Amos' hands, and threatens to sue.  Shaw persists, confronting Ramirez with the human cost of Carlos' terrorism. He finally convinces Ramirez by showing him a photograph of child who is a victim of one of Carlos' bombings.  Amos and Shaw train Ramirez at a former prison in Canada. Much of his training is devoted to situational awareness and internalizing details of Carlos' life. His training concludes with Carla, one of Carlos' ex-mistresses, training Ramirez in how to make love like Carlos. The plan revolves around convincing the [[KGB]], which is financing his terrorism, that Carlos has begun selling information to the CIA's Counter-terrorism Division. Shaw lures one of Carlos' girlfriends to Libya, where Ramirez meets up with her, successfully posing as Carlos, even during their lovemaking. The girlfriend has become an informant for French intelligence, however. Several French agents arrive at their apartment, and Ramirez is forced to kill them in self-defense. He is horrified at having to kill allies in his undercover operation.  Carlos sends an assassin to kill the girlfriend in France, ordering him to leave Europe through London. The assassin happens to be in Heathrow airport at the same time as Ramirez, and he quickly realizes he is an impostor after Ramirez doesn't recognize him. The assassin forces Ramirez into a bathroom and a struggle ensues. Amos rushes in and manages to kill the assassin before being fatally shot. After Amos' death, the CIA shuts down the mission and Ramirez returns home.  Back with his wife, he makes love to her as Carlos would, and she is disturbed by the change in his personality. The next day, at his son's little league game, he gets into a confrontation with another father and nearly kills him. Shaw bails him out of jail, and both men are clearly suffering deeply by not being able to finish their mission and kill Carlos.  They head to [[East Berlin]] and conspicuously meet with each other. The KGB photographs Ramirez meeting with Shaw and assumes Carlos has been turned.  Enraged, the KGB raids Carlos' safe house, but as they try to kill the terrorist, he fatally shoots several agents and escapes. Shaw and Ramirez are waiting outside for him, and Ramirez fights Carlos on the bank of the [[Spree River]]. It's impossible to tell which of the two is the real Carlos during the struggle. As one of the men is being held under water by the other, Shaw comes upon them and shoots the man above the water several times. He realizes that he has shot Ramirez, and Carlos swims away. Ramirez presses Shaw to leave him and kill Carlos, but Shaw insists that their plan has worked and that Carlos is now a marked man by the KGB. One way or another, Shaw points out that Carlos' days as a terrorist are over.  After returning home, the Ramirez family is seen leaving for Mass. Their car explodes in a fireball. After their funeral, we find the deaths of Ramirez and his family were staged by Shaw, and in the final scene, the family are safely cavorting on a beach in the Caribbean. Ramirez moves to kill a spider in its web with his cigarette, but suddenly changes his mind.  He watches his children, finally at peace.   An epilogue reveals that [[Carlos the Jackal]]  was jailed in 1994. A former U.S. Naval officer and a retired CIA agent are said to have played a major role in his capture.  
Ashes of Paradise
 The film opens with the fall of the respected judge Costa Makantasis ([[Héctor Alterio]]) from the Federal Courthouse. Next, his oldest son Pablo ([[Leonardo Sbaraglia]]) is seen dragging the body of young and beautiful Ana Muro ([[Leticia Brédice]]) through the house in which he lives with his two younger brothers.  Two different judges begin to investigate the two deaths. It is soon assumed that Costa Makantasis committed suicide. The case of Ana Muro, however, investigated by Beatriz Teller ([[Cecilia Roth]]), is complicated by the fact that all three sons confess the murder, each claiming that he acted alone and that the other two are innocent; and really some evidence speaks against each one of them. In addition, they urge Teller to believe that their father was murdered and that his case also requires investigation. Teller, on the other hand, is pressured by her superiors to hand over the case of the three brothers to the judge assigned to Costa Makantasis' apparent suicide. Fearing that a dirty truth behind the supposed suicide shall be covered up, she risks her career by rejecting to give up her case.  Combining cutbacks with segments of the investigations and hearings, the film sets to unravelling the story leading up to the deaths. The remaining film is divided into four unequal parts, each dedicated to one of the sons and Ana Muro. In each part, fragments of the story are shown from the perspective of the respective character, combining to the complete picture only at the end of the film.  It becomes apparent that Costa Makantasis had investigated Ana Muro's father, the powerful businessman Francisco Muro ([[Jorge Marrale]]), suspecting him to be involved in corruption and even murder. Unbeknown to the two, Makantasis' youngest son, Alejandro ([[Nicolás Abeles]]), and Ana Muro fell in love with each other, and Ana Muro moved in with Alejandro and his brothers. When Costa Makantasis found out that Ana was Francisco Muro's daughter, he was concerned, but believed that their private and his professional affairs with the Muro family should and could remain separate. For a short time, everything seemed perfect: Alejandro and Ana were a happy couple, and the Makantasis family celebrated the father's anniversary with a frolicsome party.  Soon, however, tensions arose both from inside and outside of the family. Second-oldest son Nicolás ([[Daniel Kuzniecka]]) cheated with Ana on his brother, and later, Ana also tried to flirt with oldest brother Pablo; Pablo, who had in the past snatched some of Nicolás' girl-friends, resisted Ana's charm and instead found out about her infidelity with Nicolás.  Francisco Muro, on the other hand, found out about the relationship between his daughter and the son of his political opponent, assumed foul-play and came close to threatening Costa Makantasis to keep his son away from Ana. The conflict between the judge and the businessman generally increased, and Costa Makantasis suspected that Muro tapped his house. So, when Costa Makantatis saw that Ana Muro let employees of her father into his house, he and his oldest son told her to stop that and explained it with the suspicions against her father. Believing in a misconception, Ana took secret documents of her father to Costa Makantasis' office to prove her father's innocence. There, however, she had a closer look at the documents, realized that at least some of the suspicions were well-founded, and flew the office.  Just after she departed, two of Muro's employees arrived and killed Makantasis by pushing him from the roof of the building. Ana Muro had just left the building, whereas the three Makantasis brothers were just arriving at the Courthouse to take their father to lunch. At the moment of the murder, Ana Muro looked up to the roof and saw that the judge was being pushed; Pablo watched Ana Muro look up and, mistaking her troubled look, believed her to be involved in what he instantly understands to be his father's murder. So, when Ana leaves the scene, he shouts to his brothers that she had killed their father; when Alejandro objects, Pablo reveals that Ana had cheated on him with Nicolás. Then Pablo followed Ana, who raced to her father, threw the secret documents back at him and called him a murderer in public. Pablo, watching the scene, realized that Ana had not been part of the crime.  Alejandro, however, had now heard Pablo's accusations and seen Nicolás' guilty face. He turned home where he tore down and cut off the decorations that Ana and he had set up in his room. When Ana came home to him, he affronted her, telling her she cheated on him and killed his father. Ana, almost in tears, affirmed both, but added that she loved him. When Alejandro continued to offend her, she thrust herself into a knife that Alejandro still held in his hand from destroying the decorations.  The film ends with a confrontation of the three brothers in the office of investigating judge Teller. It remains unclear whether Teller eventually learns the truth or whether the story told in the cutbacks remains unknown to her. After she has sent the three brothers back to their prison cells, she comments that justice may not be possible to achieve. The film finishes with the three brothers sent further and further down in an escalator to where are presumably their prison cells.

After meeting Tom Piper ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) and Mary ([[Cathy Cavadini]]), who runs her late father's toy factory, they go to live with their uncle, the evil Barnaby Crookedman ([[Christopher Plummer]]), who despises toys and keeps Jack and Jill in the attic. He has plans to shut down the toy factory, and earlier shot down Tom's hot air balloon as he was flying over the Goblin Forest in an attempt to get him eaten by goblins (and is quite shocked to see him alive).  Jack and Jill sneak out and go to the Toy Factory, which had received a big order from [[Santa Claus]] requesting a thousand giant toy soldiers. Just as Jack and Jill offer to help, Barnaby takes them back to the attic of his house and threatens to send them to the Goblin Forest if they go near the toy factory again. Shortly afterward, he hires two crooks named Gonzargo and Rodrigo ([[James Belushi]] and [[Bronson Pinchot]]) to sabotage the toy factory.   Jack and Jill sneak out and go to the toy factory again, where Gonzargo and Rodrigo, disguised as sheep, drop a [[monkey wrench]] into one of the machines, Jack manages to remove it before the machine can explode. Jack and Jill immediately suspect Gonzargo and Rodrigo, though believing them to be sheep, and chase after them, resulting in Rodrigo and Gonzargo being knocked into a well by a ram and Jack and Jill, respectively, get knocked down by an empty pail and fall down the hill ''again.''  Barnaby catches Jack and Jill and orders Gonzargo and Rodrigo, who expose the children's interference with the sabotage, to take them to the Goblin Forest. There, they meet the evil Goblin King (Lindsay Schnebly) who tries eat Gonzargo and Rodrigo. Mr. Dumpty informs Tom and Mary, who go to the forest to rescue them. As the goblins are weak against light, they use a flashlight to fight them off and escape. Barnaby knocks Mr. Dumpty over a bridge (while giving a mockery saying of the nursery rhyme which bears the egg's name) for the key to the factory and tries to enter it, but is stopped by Tom, Mary, Jack, Jill, Gonzargo, and Rodrigo, and is forced to retreat.  As Tom and Mary finish the Toy Factory's order and fall in love, Barnaby leads the goblins to Toyland, where they invade, setting fire to the buildings and roasting Gonzargo and Rodrigo on a spit. Tom activates the toy soldiers, who soundly defeat the goblins and put out the fire, saving all of Toyland (including Gonzargo and Rodrigo). As Barnaby insults the Goblin King, who tries to kill him, Jack and Jill shine a flashlight on him, while all the toy soldiers do the same, destroying the Goblin King. Barnaby calls him a "pathetic [[ogre]]", and the other goblins confront him and chase him off, out of Toyland (though whether they finally catch him and eat him is unclear).  Finally Christmas arrives; Tom has repaired Mr. Dumpty. Santa transforms all the giant toy soldiers into small toy soldiers. He notices Barnaby's cat, Scat, who is now homeless since Barnaby's disappearance; he picks her up and pets her. Jill asks for Scat, and just as she gets her, Santa continues on his journey.  In the end, Jack and Jill become the adopted children of Tom and Mary.

Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas
 The film starts out with everybody getting prepared for Christmas. Lumiere and Cogsworth argue about who saved Christmas last year. Chip begs Mrs. Potts to be the narrator of the story. After hesitating she agrees. Soon everyone is gathered around Mrs. Potts as she tells the events of what happened after Beast saved Belle from the wolves...  The story is made into a full-length flashback of when the Prince is the Beast and his servants are the Enchanted Objects. Belle is still a prisoner in Beast's castle. All the servants are trying to figure out a way for them to fall in love with each other, and with Christmas coming up, they look at this as a great opportunity to bring them together. Belle is excited about Christmas, but Beast is not happy seeing how it is the anniversary of his spell being cast upon the castle.  Belle finds the Beast outside and offers him to teach him ice-skating. Meanwhile, in an unknown part of the castle (through a secret door in the West Wing), an enormous pipe organ is composing rhythmic music while a small piccolo applauds. The organ is Forte, the court composer for the musicians during his human years. The organ player though is not in the mood to be human again, so he decides to figure a way for the Beast to steer clear of falling in love with Belle. He believes that "humanity is overrated" and that he has more use and power in his enchanted form.   He tells Fife that he has written a solo for a piccolo in his opera, which persuades Fife to be forced to break up the merriment between Belle and the Beast. Fife is able to interrupt Belle and the Beast's skating, causing them to crash into the snow. Then, when Belle makes a snow angel, she and the Beast get up in the snow to see their snow figures, but when the Beast smiles at Belle's angel while rubbing his head he suddenly makes a low growl and looks at his own snow print. While looking, he assumes that this is no angel, but the shadow of a monster. Enraged, he roars, thrashes around through the snow and storms off in a fit of rage, leaving Belle and the others outside. Then when Fife chuckles and hopes that Forte is going to be so proud of him, the Beast stomps back into the castle in fury and depression.  Belle has no idea why she bothers, and as she flops back into the snow, she assumes that the Beast is "worse than ever", but Mrs. Potts tells her not to lose heart. Inside the castle, Forte is playing gloomy music, while the Beast stomps into the West Wing and looks at the enchanted Rose the Enchantress gave him. After assuming that he hates Christmas, the Beast sits on his chair by the fire, and when Forte tells him that the music helps, the Beast mumbles to the pipe organ that his music is the only thing that will help him forget. Forte tells the Beast that he is always here for him.  Believing that Christmas will brighten the Beast's mood, Belle creates a wonderful new book for him, and with a little persuasion for Cogsworth, Christmas is officially being prepared. The gang goes to the highest tower in the castle, which serves as a storage room for old decorations. In one of them lies Angelique with a number of other animated baubles, who once served as the Royal Decorator. However, she is not pleased to hear about Christmas, arguing that she will not raise her hopes again in a belief that they could all get together in celebration, until they are destroyed by the Beast's foul temper and hatred for the holiday, despite Cogsworth's misgivings. Belle sings to them about how "hope is the greatest gift", saying that there is always hope, even for breaking the spell, and there will "always be a time when the world is filled with peace and love". Eventually, Angelique reluctantly agrees.   However, Fife has been overhearing all this and rushes off to tell Forte. When the Beast finds out, he is far from pleased, and wants Christmas to be depleted. Forte plays along, saying that "the girl doesn't care how you feel about Christmas", separating the two even more. The Beast reflects on his past: Christmas was the day he was most selfish, and it was on that day that the Enchantress put the spell on him and the castle.   Belle enters the boiler room and meets Axe, head of the boiler room. She tells him she needs a Yule Log and he tells her to help herself. Beast finds her and demands to know what is going on. She explains that it is a great tradition: "one log is chosen, then everyone in the house touches it, and makes a Christmas wish". The Beast, however, claims that wishes are stupid, and bellows at Belle, "You made a Christmas wish last year! Is this what you wished for?!" He shouts that she has no idea what it is to be a true prisoner, but she knows all too well. Then, having finally had enough, he hates Christmas once again and storms out, despite Cogsworth's misgivings.   Belle refuses to give up, and concludes that they will have Christmas with or without the Beast, but not before sending him her gift, the storybook. Belle and Chip take Axe with them to go look for a Christmas tree, but none on the grounds are very promising. Beast finds his gift, but Lumiere will not allow him to open it as it is not yet Christmas. He explains that everyone understands how Beast feels about the holiday, but giving a gift to another is a way of saying "I care about you". The Beast gets in the mood, and demands Forte to compose a song as a present, who agrees unhappily. When he leaves, Forte puts his plans in motion, and plays beautiful music, attracting Belle to his room. Forte quickly manipulates the situation, telling her that the tree has always been Beast's favorite part of Christmas, and that she would find a much better tree lies in the Black Forest, the woods outside the castle.   Getting the tree would break Belle's promise never to leave the castle, but she wants to make Beast happy, so she agrees to go, taking Chip and Axe. Forte orders Fife "to make sure they don't come back". Beast is still waiting for Belle to show up, but Forte claims "she's abandoned you!" and feeds Beast's anger, trying to persuade him to forget her, but he races out anyway. In his anger, Beast destroys the decorations in the dining room where Angelique was and storms off outside to look for Belle, leaving Angelique hopeless. Meanwhile, Belle and the others look for a tree but Fife startles Phillipe on the ice, creating a chain reaction that leads to Belle nearly drowning, and being rescued by the furious Beast.   Belle is locked in the dungeon for breaking her promise, but Angelique comes to visit with the other baubles and admits that she was wrong to believe that Christmas could never come. They all agree that they do not need decorations or gifts to celebrate Christmas, they have each other, and that is the best gift they could ever ask for. Meanwhile, prompted by Forte, Beast threatens to destroy the rose, but one of the flower petals fall on the present. Beast then remembers the gift Belle gave him, opens it and reads it. Remembering there is hope to break the spell, he ignores Forte and releases Belle, asking her for forgiveness. After she accepts, the Beast announces plans to have the best Christmas ever.   Enraged at the failure of his plans, Forte plans to bring the whole castle down with the rationale that they cannot fall in love again. This horrifies Fife, who finds it far too extreme and then he learns that his promised solo is blank. The Beast manages to get into the room until Forte's powerful music confounds him as he has no idea what to strike at. With Fife's advice, the Beast unplugs Forte's keyboard with his strength and smashing it, causing him to come crashing down and shatter into pieces, and the Beast laments the death of his old, traitorous confidant.   Still, together they continue to have a happy holiday, which brings us back to the actual party, but of course, if anyone actually saved Christmas, it was Belle, and Fife becomes the new court composer of the castle.   After the story, the others celebrate as the Prince gives Belle a gift, a single rose.

Bean (film)
 [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is a well meaning, but hopelessly clumsy, goofy and destructive security guard at the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]]. The board of directors for the gallery, who despise Bean for sleeping on the job, fail to fire him due to the chairman ([[Sir John Mills]]) threatening repercussions. The board immediately decides on a different course of action and has him represent them during the transfer of the portrait ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' to the Grierson Art Gallery in [[Los Angeles]], following its purchase by philanthropist General Newton ([[Burt Reynolds]]) for $50 million. The curator of the Grierson, David Langley ([[Peter MacNicol]]), impressed with the false profile of "Dr. Bean", agrees to accommodate him at his house for two months, much to the chagrin of his wife Alison ([[Pamela Reed]]). After Bean causes some initial mishaps with the airport police and breaking a family heirloom, Alison leaves for her mother's house with son Kevin ([[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]]) and daughter Jennifer ([[Tricia Vessey]]).  David soon begins to question Bean's intelligence after he suggests they head to a theme park and causes mayhem with a ride, which gets him arrested, and later messes up a dinner with the gallery's owner, George Grierson ([[Harris Yulin]]). When David questions Bean, he finds out that Bean is not a doctor after all. His worst fears are soon realised when Bean accidentally ruins the painting shortly after it arrives. Fearing that he will lose his job and possibly face criminal charges for the damage, David becomes despondent and gets drunk, even though his family returns out of pity.   To save his career, Bean sneaks back into the gallery, distracts the guard by lacing his drink with laxatives, and replaces the ruined painting with a poster. The plan proves a success on the next day, fooling everyone including Newton. Bean nearly panics when he realises he has to make a speech, but gives an improvised, sentimental and deep monologue about the painting that wins the crowd's praise and approval.  Shortly after the speech, Bean is approached by Lieutenant Brutus, whom he crossed paths with, leaving David worried that he knows the truth about the priceless painting's mishap, only to learn from him that Jennifer was rushed to hospital after being involved in a motorcycle accident while with her boyfriend. Rushing to the hospital, David goes to be with his wife, leaving Bean to wander about the hospital's reception area. Bean is then mistaken for an actual doctor after picking up a stethoscope that had been dropped and for having a nametag on him saying "Dr. Bean."  Forced into a surgery room and dressed in surgical scrubs, he finds himself coming across Brutus on the operating table, having been shot while dealing with a mugging, whereupon he manages to recover the bullet in his body via an unorthodox procedure, saving his life. Leaving the police officer to recover, Bean, still wearing scrubs, ends up being mistaken by David for a doctor, who begs for his help, leaving him alone with Jennifer, whom he revives from a coma, after an accident with a defibrillator sends him flying and he lands on top of her. Grateful for having their daughter back, David and Alison are surprised when Bean reveals his true identity. At Bean's suggestion, they repay him by allowing him to stay with them for another week.  After spending quality time with David's family, Bean soon returns to the airport, thanking David for the time he spent, before returning to London. Once home, Bean admires his room, decorated with photographs of the Langley family, before taking a final look at the ruined, original ''Whistler's Mother'' he smuggled back with him, and then going to bed.

Jared flirts with Tracy at the party and subsequently gets into a fight with Toby. Ricko comes to Jared's defence, though Jared breaks up the fight after Ricko has hit Toby several times. Tracy comes to comfort Toby and Jared leaves the party to head to the beach alone. Jared sees Toby having consensual sex with Tracy on the beach.

As Ricko finishes his confession, the police arrive and he realises that Jared has turned him in. He attempts to escape but the police give chase and corner him on a cliff.

Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy's rape and could have saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards.

They find a photo of combatants in a tournament known as The Master's Challenge and they narrow the field down to two suspects, Willy and Chad. Chad was believed to have been killed in a car accident, thus making Willy the prime suspect. However, the killer is in fact Chad, who did have an accident, which resulted in him losing two fingers, which he replaced with steel. Kelly discovers the killer amongst a crowd watching the police leave to apprehend Willy and follows him to his home. Kelly confronts the killer only to end up defeated. Chuck and Ken succeed in capturing Willy, but they noticed during the confrontation that something was not right in terms of Willy's appearance, fighting style and skills in comparison to those of the person they fought earlier. Their suspicions are confirmed when Kelly texts them what she'd discovered. They rush to the killer's house, only to arrive too late finding Kelly's lifeless body and the killer nowhere to be found. The killer then phones Ken, revealing that he has kidnapped Ken's wife and daughter in order to challenge Ken to a "grand championship match" to the death.  Ken and Chuck head to an abandoned construction site where the top of the building has Ken's wife (whom he has reconciled) and daughter strapped to a bomb. As Ken begins to face off against the killer in a showdown, the killer uses the environment to his advantage. When Chuck attempts to help Ken, Chuck is nearly killed for his actions. However, Ken eventually gets the upper hands and on a long scaffold, Ken unleashes a flurry of kicks and blows, knocking the killer off the building and causing him to fall to his death. When Ken reaches his wife and daughter, the bomb goes off but the explosion only consists of confetti. A tape recording reveals the killer saying, "I'm no child killer. There will be no slaughter of the innocents". Chuck makes it out, still injured from the killer, while Ken walks away in joy and relief with his wife and daughter.

 Young Pete Lender ([[Bradley Pierce]]) is setting up traps around his house, explaining to his parents that things in their house are being stolen, despite his parents believing they are simply misplaced. However, it turns out that a family of tiny people ("Borrowers"), are living in the house, borrowing stuff without being seen. Pod Clock ([[Jim Broadbent]]) and his children, Arrietty ([[Flora Newbigin]]) and Peagreen ([[Tom Felton]]), make their way through the kitchen to "borrow" the radio's battery.   Arrietty, while treating herself with some ice cream in the freezer, is accidentally shut inside just as the Lenders return. Pod manages to rescue Arietty, but jams the ice cube tube in the process and is forced to leave one of his gadgets behind, which is found by Mr. Lender. Meanwhile, the will of Mrs. Lender's aunt Mrs. Allabaster is the only proof that the house rightfully belongs to the family, yet their [[lawyer]] Ocious P. Potter ([[John Goodman]]) cannot find it and has already made plans to demolish their house in order to build condominiums on the land, and the Lenders have until Saturday to move away.  Arrietty is trapped by Pete, who is actually astonished to discover the Borrowers. Pete also explains to Arrietty that the house is being demolished due to the absence of Mrs. Allabaster's will, meaning that both families will have to move. After Arrietty explains the situation to her family, Pod reluctantly agrees to have the family move to the new house, despite being somewhat upset that Arrietty has defied so much about the way of the Borrowers. Unfortunately, during the journey, Arrietty and Peagreen fall out of the moving truck and make their way back to the old house, where they find the new house on a map.   However, Potter turns up and finds the will hidden in a safe inside the wall. It turns out that Mrs. Allabaster had stated that she did not trust banks and preferred to keep the will in the house, something Potter deliberately kept from his clients. But as he tries to burn it, Arrietty and Peagreen recover the will, determined to save the house for both the Lenders and the Clocks. Upon seeing the Clocks' underground home, Potter calls the local [[Pest control|exterminator]] Jeff ([[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]), but they manage to escape as Potter throws off the suspicions of Officer Oliver Steady ([[Hugh Laurie]]).   Meanwhile, Pod and his wife Homily discover that their children are missing and, with Pete's help, track them to the milk factory, where Peagreen is trapped in a milk bottle. Pod rescues Peagreen from drowning just as Arrietty and Spiller, an underground "outie" Borrower, reunite with them. Unfortunately, Potter catches them, steals the will and ties them to the cheese machine, intending to drown them in the liquid cheese. Spiller cheeks Potter to the point that Potter dumps him in another machine, apparently killing him, but Spiller manages to escape. Just before the cheese can hit, Pete arrives and turns the machine off.  With Jeff's help, Pete and the Borrowers follow Potter to City Hall to stop him arranging the demolition. He is briefly stalled thanks to the town hall clerk ([[Ruby Wax]]) who gives him confusing directions to the demolition office in response to his rude behavior. When he finally reaches the door, he finds himself trapped inside the storeroom instead where the Clocks tie his hands to his face with insulation tape. In his rage, Potter breaks off and attempts to vacuum the Clocks when an army of Borrowers turns up to save them. The Borrowers tie Potter up with wire and a ceiling fan and it is revealed that Spiller had survived the machine at the factory and summoned the army of Borrowers to aid the Clocks. Pod delivers a speech to Potter on the Borrowers' behalf. The door to the room is then unlocked, the Borrowers untie Potter and disappear right before the door opens. Pete and Jeff enter with Officer Steady. Pete recovers the will from Potter and shows it to Steady, proving Potter's deceit and his plan to cheat the Lenders out of their house. Potter tries to explain his story, but Steady, unconvinced, arrests him for fraud and theft.  Having retrieved the will, the Lenders move back into their house and Pete becomes friends with the Clocks and regularly gives them food while keeping their existence a secret.  During the credits, Potter explains his story to Steady and the other police officers while in custody only to be laughed at by the police before his mugshot is taken which he seems to enjoy.

Later, at a gas station, Earl, the truck's driver, confronts Jeff and they exchange hostile words.  Shortly after the couple resume their journey, their car breaks down on a vacant road.

Jeff eventually discovers that someone has tampered with the Jeep's battery connections. After reconnecting them, he drives to the diner, only to discover that no one has seen Amy. When he sees the trucker on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or Amy. Jeff then hails a passing sheriff named Boyd, but a brief search of the truck yields no sign of Amy. The trucker, Red Barr, is let go and Jeff is instructed by Boyd to see his deputy in the town of Brackett.  After speaking with the deputy, Jeff goes back to the diner. Billy, a mentally-impaired mechanic, informs Jeff that Amy left with some men, but refuses to speak with the police, claiming they are involved. Jeff rushes to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl. He escapes by driving his Jeep into a river, then circles back on foot to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the river. He is then discovered and knocked out by Billy.  When Jeff wakes up, he is confronted by Billy (who feigned mental impairment earlier), Earl, and another accomplice named Al. Their leader is none other than Red Barr, who informs Jeff that he wants the $90,000 in Jeff's bank account and orders him to withdraw the money in the nearby town of Brackett in exchange for Amy's life. Realizing he has only a fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff attempts to alert the bank manager to his plight. However, paranoid that Red's group is keeping an eye on him, Jeff abandons the idea and steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener. He uses the money ribbons to pack stacks of $1 bills between two $100 bills.  Jeff is then instructed to leave town, where Earl picks him up and binds him with duct tape. Earl begins gloating about how Jeff and his wife were easy targets, how he tampered with their Jeep and that his group intends to kill them anyway. Jeff cuts himself free with the letter opener and stabs Earl. After a brief struggle, Jeff takes over the vehicle, binds Earl, and tortures him to reveal his rendezvous with Red at a local truck stop. They pass Boyd, who sees the speeding, swerving pickup and stops the vehicle. When Jeff exits the truck with Earl's gun, Boyd mistakes the situation and forces him to lie down. Earl frees himself and shoots Boyd with a concealed gun. Before Earl can shoot Jeff, a wounded Boyd shoots and kills him. Jeff uses Boyd's radio to call for an ambulance and rushes to the truck stop.  At the stop, Jeff sees Red and stows away under his truck. Early the next morning, Red arrives at his farm. Jeff sneaks into the barn, discovering evidence that Red has a history robbing and killing people and that his real name is Warren. Al and Billy arrive with a bound and gagged Amy, and the three lock her in a freezer in the barn's cellar, leaving her to die. Unable to open the cellar door, Jeff finds a gun and demands the cellar key from Red. When he is distracted by Red's son, Billy escapes. Jeff forces Al, Red, his wife, and his son to release Amy, then locks them in the cellar. Jeff and Amy steal a pickup and flee, while Billy returns to free Red and Al, who each pursue the Taylors in their own vehicles.  During the pursuit, Billy is killed when Jeff forces his car off the road. Shortly after, the trailer from Red's truck detaches, causing Al to violently crash into it. Undeterred, Red attempts to force Jeff and Amy's vehicle off a bridge, trapping Amy's leg underneath the dashboard. Jeff rushes out of the vehicle and into Red's big rig, where a struggle over the steering wheel forces Red's truck over the edge, leaving it dangling on a steel bridge support. Jeff fights Red on the suspended big rig, eventually hurling him to the rocks below. Jeff frees Amy from the dashboard. Seeing that Red survived the fall, Amy pulls the automatic shifter on their pickup, causing the semi to fall on Red and crush him. Sitting on the edge of the bridge beside their mangled pickup, Jeff and Amy embrace each other.

After threatening to break his leg, the crime boss proposes another wager - a game between Les Boys and his own team.  If Les Boys win, the debt is settled, but if they lose, the crime boss gets the pub.  In the week leading up to the big game, a number of sub plots emerge.  Chief among them is the fact that most of the partners of the hockey players are starved for affection and intimacy, including the effeminate partner of the gay lawyer.

The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue
  Rob McGoarty, the owner of the appliances and whom they refer to as "The Master", is working at a veterinary clinic where he tends to injured animals. One night, while working on a [[thesis]], his computer accidentally crashes due to a terrible [[computer virus]] from an old TLW-728 prototype [[supercomputer]] named Wittgenstein. The appliances along with a rat named Ratso, who found Wittgenstein before, seek to help Rob by finding Wittgenstein and reversing the effects of his computer virus, hence recovering the master's thesis. Meanwhile, in a dual plot of the film, Mack, Rob's lab assistant, plots to sell the injured animals Rob had been tending to as part of his courses, to a place called "Tartaras Laboratories", the same place that Sebastian, an old monkey Rob was tending to, was sent to when he was just a baby. When the appliances find Wittgenstein, they discover him abandoned, all alone, run-down, and broken in the basement due to being infected by a computer virus, the same one that affected Rob's dorm room computer and the one in the vet's clinic lab when Wittgenstein tryed to contact them earlier. The miserable supercomputer reveals that he is living on one rare vacuum tube, named the "WFC 11-12-55". A reference to the producer and screenwriter, [[Willard Carroll|Willard F. Carroll]] (WFC), and his birthdate, November 12, 1955 (11-12-55). The appliances learn that unless they find a replacement quickly, Wittgenstein's tube will blow and lead to his apparent death.  In an attempt to revive Wittgenstein to his superior state, Radio and Ratso go to the college's storage building to find the hard-to-find WFC 11-12-55 tube. When they come back with the last apparent tube for miles, however, Radio and Ratso (after an argument with the tube) accidentally break it, and it seems that all hope is lost. Wittgenstein does his best with all his might, but the virus causes him to blow his remaining tube with a big explosion and apparently "[[death|is a goner]]". Ratso then blames Radio, and guilt-ridden over condemning the animals to their doom at Tartarus Laboratories, Radio gives up his own tube which turns out to be the very rare tube they had been looking for, thus killing himself. Knowing that they were given a final chance to save the animals, the appliances replace the tube in the nick of time. With the boosted power of the new tube, Wittgenstein wakes up, miraculously regenerates the other smashed tubes connected to himself, and destroys the computer viruses within him, allowing him to be completely revived as good as new. By the end of the film, the appliances restore Rob's thesis, stop Mack from selling the injured animals, and have him arrested with some help from Wittgenstein, Rob, his girlfriend Chris (later referred to as "The Mistress"), two guard dogs, and the police. After discovering the appliances in the truck, they assume that Mac had also planned to sell Rob's stuff as well, although Rob is surprised that Radio isn't here. Later, they discover Wittgenstein in the basement along with Radio. Chris would Later replace Radio's tube with a new one he found in [[Nome, Alaska]] (hence his revival), Wittgenstein is sold to a museum and will be modernized with current technology, Rob proposes to Chris, and all is well.

Making his escape, Danila jumps into a freight tram and, despite being wounded in the abdomen, manages to kill one of the pursuing thugs.  The tram driver, a woman named Sveta (Svetlana Pismichenko), helps Danila escape. Danila later recovers, with German's help. After meeting up with Sveta, and despite her being married to an abusive husband, the two begin an affair. With the money given to him by Viktor after the hit, he begins to enjoy St. Petersburg, gives his provincial image a makeover, goes to a concert with Sveta to see his favourite band, Nautilus Pompilius, and manages to scare away her husband. He meets up with Kat to go to a nightclub and then smokes [[cannabis]] in an afterparty, where he taunts a French tourist whom he mistakes for an American. The night ends with him sleeping with Kat.  Meanwhile, Roundhead is angry about losing one of his men and the fact that Viktor used someone else to carry out a hit for which he was contracted. He decides to draw him into a combined raid. Once again Viktor, suspecting a trap, passes the job to Danila. The two thugs raid the apartment, but their main target is away. While they wait, in an apartment on the floor above, a party is taking place with several well-known [[Russian rock]] stars. A young radio director, Stepan (Andrey Fedortsov) mistakes the raided flat for the party flat and is almost killed by the thugs, who take him as a hostage. [[Vyacheslav Butusov]], the lead singer of Nautilus Pompilius, makes the same mistake, but Danila instead follows Butusov to the party above and relaxes in the friendly musical atmosphere. Realizing the balance between right and wrong, he comes downstairs and finds that the thugs have just killed their main target, and are about to do the same with Stepan. Instead, Danila kills both thugs. Danila and Stepan drag the corpses to the [[Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery]], where German and his friends live. German helps Danila dispose of the bodies.  Roundhead is furious upon finding out what happened. Instead of going after Tatar, he decides to track Danila and intercepts Sveta's tram. They later raid her apartment, where his men beat and rape her, and learn his phone number, as well as his address. A henchman nicknamed "Mole" ambushes Danila near his apartment building, but the bullet hits Danila's music player, giving him a chance to fire back and kill Mole. Realizing that staying home is unsafe, he travels to Sveta's house and is shocked at her state. Initially thinking it was her husband, he then learns who was responsible and realizes that the only way they could have tracked Sveta was when he returned a phone call from her home telephone to his brother.  At the same time, Roundhead raids Viktor's apartment and forces him to call Danila at gunpoint, so that he comes to pick up his payment. Realizing the depth of the situation, Danila decides to end it all at once. He goes back to the communal room that he was renting, buys the rifle from the old man, converts it into a [[sawed-off shotgun]], and replaces the duck-hunting pellets with nailheads. At Viktor's apartment, he makes easy work of Roundhead and two of his henchmen and tells the surviving thug to warn the rest of the gang that anyone who hurts his brother will be killed. In reply, the thug tells him that it was Viktor who turned him in.  Danila forgives his brother, gives him some of the money from Roundhead's suitcase (keeping the rest for himself) and then tells him to return home and to work for the militsiya. Danila decides to go to Moscow, as St. Petersburg, according to Viktor, "is a pretty town, but provincial nonetheless". Once again he visits Sveta, intending to take her with him, but her husband has returned and is beating her, demanding to know where Danila is. Seeing Danila, he challenges him to a fight, but before he can come closer, Danila fires a shot into his leg. Sveta rushes to her husband and begins to treat his wound. Danila urges her to come with him, but she tells him to get out and never come back. He leaves her a Nautilus Pompilius CD. He then meets up with German, converses with him about the influence of the city on its residents, saying that everyone is weak here, to which German replies that the city is an evil that drains the strength from those who enter it. Danila offers him money, but German declines, saying "What's good for the Russian is death for the German". Before he leaves the city, he finds Kat to say goodbye. She is indifferent to his departure, but he gives her money nonetheless.  The last scene of the film shows Danila walking out of a snow-covered forest. He hitches a ride to [[Moscow]] on a passing [[Kamaz]] truck. As he chats with the driver, the final shot is of the winter road stretching far into the wilderness.

Buried Alive II
  Ten years have passed since the events of the first movie. Clint Goodman has been living a solitary life elsewhere under the assumed name Michael Haden, while everyone in the original town believes that he is dead. However, he suffers from serious health issues due to the effects of the toxin and his near-death experience.  When his old friend Sheriff Sam Eberly passes away, Clint decides to come back for the funeral. Sam's niece Laura Riskin, who knew Clint a long time ago, notices him, but he quickly leaves before she can approach him.  Laura then finds out that she’s inherited some stock worth $250,000, which her uncle Sam bought and left to her. She wants to start a family with the money, but her husband Randy, who hates his life in the small town, wants to buy a yacht instead and leave there for good. Laura doesn't sympathize with him.  Unknown to Laura, Randy is having an affair with the local vixen Roxanne. He promises Roxanne to dump Laura as soon as he finds a way to leave with her, but she can't wait. Randy knows what happened to Clint and decides to do the same thing to Laura. Meanwhile, Laura corners Clint, who tells her to forget him because he is just like a wanted man.  Laura decides to forgive Randy, believing he has changed. When they go out for dinner that evening, he slips the toxin into her wine. Laura soon gets into a cardiac arrest and seemingly dies after consuming the spiked wine. When the doctor asks Randy if he wants an autopsy, he declines. The case doesn't raise the police's suspicion because Laura's family has a history of heart failure.  Clint has a heart attack after reading about Laura's death in the newspaper. At the hospital, he asks how Laura died, but the doctor only tells him that her funeral is being prepared. He wants to go there, but the doctor doesn't let him leave.  At the morgue, as Laura is about to be embalmed, the machine malfunctions. As a result, the staff doesn't embalm her, although Randy had requested her body to be embalmed twice.  After Laura's funeral, Clint approaches Randy and warns him that Laura may not be dead, with Randy questioning who Clint is. That night, after having a nightmare about his own escaping from the grave, Clint digs Laura up and believes that she is dead. His exertions on top of his already weakened condition cause a fatal heart attack and he finally dies. Laura wakes up and escapes her grave. She puts Clint's body in her coffin and buries it.  She goes home to find Randy and Roxanne in bed together. She intends to kill them with a harpoon gun. However, when she hears that Randy wants to have babies with Roxanne, she changes her mind, plotting a better revenge.  Over the next few days, Randy notices strange things in his home, including finding Laura's wedding ring. He has his wife's grave exhumed to make sure she is dead but finds Clint's body instead. Upon discovering that the dead person is Clint, they exhume Clint's grave to find Joanna and Cort's skeletons, along with the money they got from selling Clint's business. Suspecting that Laura is still alive, Randy hastily buys a yacht and prepares to leave the town. As he and Roxanne are packing their luggage, Laura traps them both inside a tool shed. She takes a hose attached to the exhaust pipe and puts it through the vent, knocking them unconscious.  Randy and Roxanne wake up on board the yacht with all doors locked and sealed shut with screws, and Roxanne sees Laura peering down at them through a skylight just before she blocks it off. When the yacht tilts, Randy realizes that Laura intends to sink it and bury them alive at the sea. He tries to shut off the bilge valve, but she has broken it off. In another room, they find a set of funeral clothes and a buoy saying "R.I.P Randy and Roxanne". Laura asks Randy why he tried to kill her, then blocks off the last vent and leaves in a motorized dinghy as the yacht sinks.  The next day, Laura visits Clint's grave, thanking him for what he's done. She then leaves the town to start a new life. The camera pans down through the water to the seabed, where Randy and Roxanne - still trapped inside the sunken yacht - scream at their fate.  
A Brother's Kiss
 Mick ([[Michael Raynor (actor)|Michael Raynor]]) and Lex ([[Nick Chinlund]]) are a pair of brothers who grew up in Harlem under circumstances that were difficult at best. Their mother Doreen ([[Cathy Moriarty]]) was a diabetic with a drinking problem and difficulty in saying no to men. While she wasn't a prostitute, she grew dependent on the little gifts her lovers would bring by, and as kids, Mick and Lex learned to accept this as the way things were. One night, Mick and Lex were taking a walk in the park when they were accosted by a cop who molested the younger Mick. Lex, older and strong as a grown man, attacked the cop, which led to a stay in a reform school. Years later, Mick is himself a policeman; while he's tried to bury the childhood incident in his past, he still shows emotional scars and is sexually dysfunctional. Lex, however, has taken the more dramatic slide. Since his stay in reform school, Lex has been in and out of trouble; today he has a combative relationship with Debbie ([[Rosie Perez]]), his girlfriend and the mother of his child and a going-nowhere job driving a bus. He also sells drugs for local dealer Lefty Louie ([[John Leguizamo]]), but has developed enough of a habit that his sales don't begin to compensate for the amount he uses himself.

Cats Don't Dance
 In 1939, Danny, an optimistic young cat, dreams of Hollywood stardom, so he travels from his hometown of [[Kokomo, Indiana]] to [[Hollywood]] in hopes of starting a career there. After meeting a new friend Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film called ''Li'l Ark Angel'' that is in production alongside a white cat named Sawyer at Mammoth Studios. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie, Cranston, Frances, and T.W., Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny winds up angering Darla Dimple, a popular, extremely spoiled child actress and star of the film, so she assigns her butler Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part.  Danny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals; a fact that none of them are very happy with but know they must accept. He longs for the spotlight and tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios, such as by assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans.  Later, Danny is given advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature with a sweet one as she always does) through song on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B. Mammoth, the chief of Mammoth Studios; and Flanagan, the film's director, are giving an interview, gets the animals blamed and fired for the collateral damage. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Studios (especially Danny, who was convinced by Darla that she was trying to help the animals). As Woolie tells Danny to return to Kokomo, Tillie suggests Sawyer to follow Danny.  After a comment from the bus driver and seeing Pudge wander the streets, Danny comes up with a plan yet again. He secretly invites Sawyer, her friends, and Woolie to the premiere of ''Lil' Ark Angel''. After the screening and a battle with Max that sends him flying away on a Darla Dimple balloon, Danny calls the audience's attention. Upon bringing Sawyer, Woolie, Tillie, Cranston, Pudge, Frances and T.W. backstage to help Danny, the eight animals put on a musical performance that entertains and impresses the viewers. Meanwhile, Darla is trying to sabotage the show by tampering with the set and special effects equipment, but her attempts instead cause her to inadvertently enhance the performance as well as injure herself. At last, she pulls a big all-switch, though it sets off an enormous [[fireworks]] finale, making the animals' performance a complete success (as well as severing the roof of the theatre).  Furious and fuming at the animals, Darla berates Danny, accidentally confessing to flooding Mammoth Studios when her voice is amplified over the theater's sound system thanks to an open microphone, revealing the truth about the incident to the audience, including L.B. Mammoth and Flanagan, who are horrified seeing Darla for her true colors. Pudge pulls a lever, sending Darla down a trapdoor. At last, the animals' demand for larger roles are met and their dreams are fulfilled after so long, and Danny and Sawyer admit their feelings for each other. (Max is also last seen in [[Paris]], [[France]] on the balloon.)  A montage of film poster parodies which put the main animals in the roles of each character (ending with a [[Free Willy]] parody) precede the credits. It is shown afterwards that Darla is fired from show business and is now working as a [[janitor]]. She puts up a "The End" poster on a wall, and it falls down and wraps around her.  
Casper: A Spirited Beginning
 In a ghost train where spirits are heading towards the Ghost Central, [[Casper the Friendly Ghost|Casper]] has no idea of where he is, nor is he aware that he is a ghost himself. He gets kicked off the train and finds himself in the city of Deedstown, where he unintentionally scares a bunch of the town's citizens, which leads him to the realization that he is a ghost.  Meanwhile, a loner boy named Chris Carson, with a passionate obsession of the supernatural, has a strained relationship with his work-obsessed father Tim Carson, who is attempting to demolish the Applegate Mansion, to make way for a new renovation for the town: building a brand new mini-mall in its place. However, a group of protestors are against the demolition, as the house was confirmed to be a historical landmark. The bickering was cut short when the wrecking crew that Tim hired and protestors were terrorized by the [[Ghostly Trio]], Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who are in possession of the Mansion. Chris witnessed this after seeing the group running in panic, and wants to join the Trio, but they refuse since he is only human.  The train that Casper was on arrives in Ghost Central run by the evil ghoul [[Kibosh (Casper the Friendly Ghost)|Kibosh]], where new spirits are trained to learn the proper ghost lifestyle and work to receive a haunting license. After discovering Casper's absent, Kibosh becomes furious about the idea of letting a rookie ghost being let loose without any education and forces his spineless assistant Snivel to find Casper and bring him back.  After saving Chris from detention when a gang of bullies, led by Brock, attempt to pull a prank by dropping a balloon full of gunk on him, which instead lands on the school principal, Chris's teacher, Sheila Fistergraff, who is leading protesters becomes outraged after she and Chris witness in the news, that Tim and the town's mayor: Johnny Hunt will proceed with the demolition project as planned, despite a series of setbacks, after the mayor threatens to dismiss Tim if he does not do the job.    Chris runs into Casper, and instantly befriends him, much to Casper's surprised to see that a human isn't afraid of him. Chris insists on teaching Casper to be a real ghost while also introducing him to the Trio. Much to the Trio's delight, they discover that Casper hasn't gone to the Ghost Central and has therefore never been educated by Kibosh, which gives them the opportunity to train Casper and prove themselves to Kibosh, so he would stop chasing them. However, they are unknowingly eavesdropped on by Snivel, who informs Kibosh of their plan, much to Kibosh's rage. Casper manages to succeed in his first lesson in going into the stealth mode (going invisible), but fails at every other lesson, leading the Trio to realize that Casper is too soft to be a terrifying ghost: he wants to be friendly, which forces them to kick him out.  After a night of waiting for his father's arrival at his school's open house, Chris gets disappointed that he never showed up as Fistergraff tries to comfort and support Chris. The next morning, Tim decides to make it up to him by spending more time with him. Chris offers to teach Casper to become a better ghost after Casper informed on what happened. Casper manages to succeed by using his powers on Brock getting him into trouble with the principal, when Brock and his friends were teasing Chris, and so he tests his new powers by scaring away a man who attempts to rob a convenience store, and is thanked by the owner for saving his life, which gives Casper the idea to use his ghostly powers to help people. After Tim's office accidentally catches on fire by Bill Case, a professional bomber he hired to blow up the mansion, he is unable to attend the plans he made with Chris earlier, but Chris hopes Tim will remember their other plans.   After Casper and Chris set up dinner for Tim's arrival, Snivel sees Casper acting like a servant to a human and leaves to report back to Kibosh, to which Kibosh is unable to tolerate any further, and prepares to retrieve Casper himself. The Ghostly Trio discover Casper's good deeds and abduct him in attempt to save their reputation, which unfortunately ruins Chris's opportunity to have Tim meet Casper as Tim does not believe Chris, and instead leaves to visit the mayor, which leads Chris to the solution to run away, for feeling betrayed by Casper, but gets captured and locked inside the mansion by Brock and his gang for getting him a month of detention, unaware that a bomb has been implanted inside by Bill.  The next morning, Kibosh arrives in Deedstown, captures The Trio, and forces Snivel to find Casper. After discovering that Chris ran away, Tim meets Casper, and they both set out to find him, with Casper assuming that he is in the Applegate Mansion, which is about to explode, so Tim hitches a ride with Fistergraff as Casper arrives at the mansion to find Chris, and try to help him escape. Tim manages to get Chris out and Casper eats the bomb, which explodes in his stomach, saving the mansion.  With Kibosh being impressed with Casper's technique, Casper informs him that the Ghostly Trio taught him how to do it, so Kibosh decides to let Trio stay and haunt, which led to The Trio returning Casper the favor by lying to Kibosh saying that they are Casper's uncles, after Kibosh informs them the importance of family, which allows Casper to stay with his "uncles" and Kibosh to leave them in peace. Chris and his father reconcile and Brock and his gang get their comeuppance when the Trio hangs them from the branches of a nearby tree by their underwear. Casper decides to go with a new name: Casper the Friendly Ghost.  
Career Girls
 In 1996, Annie is on the train to London to spend the weekend with Hannah, her flatmate when at polytechnic (the [[University of North London#Polytechnic of North London|Polytechnic of North London]]) six years earlier.<ref></ref> Hannah laments about her alcoholic mother, and Annie talks about her mother's search for a new boyfriend. Annie, who still lives with her mother, admires Hannah's independence. In contrast, Hannah laments being forced to be independent since she was a child.  Back in 1986, Hannah and Claire interview and accept Annie into their flat. Annie and Hannah discuss getting rid of Claire the next year. Hannah and Annie discuss how Hannah hasn't cried since she was eight, when her parents split up. Annie, whose parents also divorced when she was eight, says she cries all the time. The following year, Ricky Burton, a socially awkward stutterer, has temporarily moved in with Hannah and Annie after being kicked out by his landlord. While discussing psychological traits with them in a pub, Ricky's untactful probing angers Hannah. While Ricky visits the Chinese takeaway beneath the flat, Annie and Hannah discuss the argument and how Ricky fancies Annie. In another memory, Ricky drunkenly confesses his love for Annie, but Annie says she's in love with someone else. Ricky leaves and doesn't reappear, so Hannah and Annie travel to his grandmother's home in [[Hartlepool]]. She tells them that Ricky has gone out, possibly along the seafront, so they go to look for him there.  In the present, Annie accompanies Hannah as she looks for a flat to buy. One flat is owned by a Mr Evans, whose flat contains a painting of his naked ex-girlfriend and pornographic magazines. Evans hits on Hannah and offers both women alcoholic drinks. They run out of the flat making excuses, and are still laughing as they drive off. At the next flat, Adrian Spinks, an [[estate agent]], meets them. Annie realises he is an old college boyfriend, but Adrian says he doesn't recognise them. In between their conversations, flashbacks show Hannah and Annie's history with Adrian. After meeting him at a club, Hannah takes Adrian home and sleeps with him. The following morning, he walks into Annie's room and tries to chat her up. In other flashbacks, Annie tells Adrian about a recurring sexual fantasy. Later, they kiss and discuss why he split up with his ex-girlfriend: Adrian says he didn't want the commitment, and leaves when Annie asks why.  In the present, Hannah and Annie learn that Adrian is married with a child. At a Chinese restaurant, Annie and Hannah discuss how they have changed since university and wonder what happened to Ricky. Annie says she hadn't stopped thinking about Adrian for ten years. Hannah says she was hurt by the situation back then but said she didn't say anything because she knew that Annie was in love with him. In a flashback, Annie and Hannah cry and hug as they pack, preparing to leave their flat at the end of their four years at university.  At the present-day dinner, Hannah recalls being overwhelmed upon meeting Annie's kind family, as opposed to her own [[dysfunctional family]]. They see their old flatmate Claire jogging, and discuss the coincidence of seeing two old acquaintances in one afternoon. They decide to visit their old flat, and there spot Ricky sitting on the steps outside the Chinese takeaway, holding a toy elephant. He seems angry and delirious, and tells them he arrived from Hartlepool the previous day. He says the toy is for his son, but the mother won't admit that the child is his. He tells them that his grandmother died, and, when Annie asks where he lives, responds that they don't care. They leave.  In a flashback to their visit to Hartlepool, they find Ricky by the sea. They ask how he is and he shouts and swears at them that he doesn't care. They chase after him and he screams at them to leave him alone.  In the present, they return to the railway station, where they say goodbye to one another.  
Chachi 420
  Jaiprakash Paswan a.k.a. Jai ([[Kamal Haasan]]) and Janki Paswan ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) are fighting a divorce case. Janaki is the only daughter of Durgaprasad Bhardwaj ([[Amrish Puri]]), a staunch [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin]] businessman. Jaiprakash, a [[Hindu]] [[Dusadh]], is an assistant dance director in films. The duo fell in love and married against the will of Durgaprasad. However, Janki buckles under the pressure of a middle-class life. Other differences crop up between the couple and Janki walks out. The court grants the divorce. Jai is allowed to meet his beloved daughter Bharti (Baby Sana) once a week. But when he sneaks into the Bhardwaj house to steal Bharti, he loses visitation rights.  Meanwhile, Durgaprasad puts ads in local newspapers for a nanny for Bharti. Jai sees this as an opportunity and calls Durgaprasad. Impersonating a female, he introduces himself as '[[Shrimati]] Lakshmi Godbole' and applies for the position. With the help of a drunkard makeup artist Joseph ([[Johnny Walker (actor)|Johnny Walker]] in his last and memorable role), Jai undergoes a complete transformation into Lakshmi Godbole, a dignified elderly Marathi woman. He goes to the interview, where he is generally viewed as the last pick. But Bharti has an accident, and Lakshmi acts promptly to give first aid. Lakshmi gets the job and the respect of the Bhardwaj family.  Jai begins the job, but creates plausible stories so that his real work schedule does not clash with the job in Bhardwaj's home. Apart from Joseph, only Bharti (who sees through her father's disguise) knows the real identity of Lakshmi. Jai learns that Durgaprasad's secretary Banwarilal Pandit ([[Om Puri]]) is not exactly thrilled at Lakshmi's entry. The reasons are various, such as Banwa's womanizing nature (which naturally views an old woman like Lakshmi with dislike) and his desire to siphon off Durgaprasad's money via friendly maids.  Meanwhile, Durgaprasad decides to get Janki remarried to Dr Rohit ([[Rajendranath Zutshi]]), her childhood friend. One day, when Janki and Rohit get attacked by goons in the market, the doctor scampers. Lakshmi saves Janki's life and modesty. Later, Durgaprasad tells Lakshmi that he has changed his mind about the marriage on learning of Rohit's cowardice. Lakshmi also exposes the thefts committed by the maid in the Bhardwaj house. The maid is fired. Banwa has no other option but to let a male cook be appointed instead. Jai runs into his old friend Shiraz ([[Nassar]]), a Muslim restaurant chef who is now doing menial jobs as he lost his job trying to help Jai. Lakshmi introduces Shiraz to the Bhardwaj household as Pandit Shivraj Sharma, a mute Brahmin cook. Even Shiraz does not know that Lakshmi and Jai are the same person.  Jai learns that although Janki likes Lakshmi, who by now has earned the affectionate title of Chachi (a respected aunt), she still loathes Jai. Meanwhile, Jai has other problems in his own home. His landlord Hari ([[Paresh Rawal]]) is after him for his rent. After he sees Lakshmi, Hari falls for her. As if that is not enough, a struggler named Ratna ([[Ayesha Julka]]) tries to cozy up to Jai. Meanwhile, Durgaprasad also falls for Lakshmi and goes to the extent of proposing to her.  Jai, as Lakshmi, buys time by telling Durgaprasad that 'she' is married but 'her' husband has left 'her' and got converted into a Christian named Joseph. Lakshmi also convinces Durgaprasad that 'she' is still waiting for 'her' husband. On the other hand, Jai tells Hari that Banwa is Lakshmi's husband Durgaprasad. He also tells Hari to harbour no feelings for Lakshmi. At same time, Jai tells Banwa that Lakshmi's husband has converted and calls himself Haribhai.  Banwa intensifies his efforts to discredit Lakshmi in the eyes of Durgaprasad and Janki but in vain. Meanwhile, Janki and Durgaprasad realize that they have punished Jai too hard for all the things he has done. Banwa gets a small victory when he blows Shiraz's cover. But Lakshmi makes Durgaprasad see sense that religion and caste do not matter. Durgaprasad shows mercy on Shiraz, giving a verdict that the cook can stay and need not put up his act anymore. However, now Durgaprasad ends up hurting Janki's feelings.  Banwa and Janki see that there is something fishy about Lakshmi. Meanwhile, Shiraz tries to force Lakshmi to marry Durgaprasad. Shiraz threatens 'her' by covering himself in kerosene, which forces Jai to reveal himself. But, owing to a misunderstanding about this scene, Banwa is able to convince Janki that Lakshmi is a promiscuous woman who is seducing the cook as well as Durgaprasad. Janki, who is very hurt by the turn of events, leaves her father's home and goes to reconcile with Jai. But on seeing Ratna waiting for him, and Lakshmi's clothes strewn about his home, Janki gets the wrong idea that her husband is also promiscuous. Janki goes to commit suicide. Jai/Lakshmi follows on a motorcycle and jumps into the river to save her. There, Jai/Lakshmi reveals his/'her' true self. Janki hears the whole story and reconciles with him. They come up with a story that Lakshmi died trying to save Janki.  To tie up other loose ends, they convince Banwari that Lakshmi is dead. They threaten and blackmail Banwa with his secrets to ensure his silence. They tell Hari to let it go. Joseph almost accidentally betrays some part of the truth, but Jai hushes up the matter by saying that Lakshmi will always remain alive in the hearts of everybody who knew her. Jai and Janki remarry.

The Castle (1997 Australian film)
 The Kerrigan home, in the outer [[Melbourne]] blue-collar suburb of [[Coolaroo]], is filled with love as well as pride in their modest lifestyle, but their happiness is threatened when developers attempt the [[compulsory acquisition]] of their house to expand the neighbouring [[Melbourne Airport|airport]].  The Kerrigan house is built in a largely undeveloped housing tract, on a toxic landfill, and directly adjacent to an airport runway. Despite all this, sweet-natured family patriarch Darryl ([[Michael Caton]]) believes that he lives in the lap of luxury. Blissfully unaware of his family's lack of style or sophistication, he busies himself by driving a tow truck, racing greyhounds, and constantly adding tacky renovations to the house. The rest of the Kerrigan clan shares and supports his enthusiasm in every way.  One day, a property valuer arrives to inspect the house. Though he [[Holdout (real estate)|has no wish to sell]], Darryl points out all the features of the property, believing they will add value to the appraisal. A few weeks later, he receives a letter informing him of the compulsory acquisition of his house for the sum of $70,000. His neighbours (elderly Jack, divorcee Yvonne, and Farouk and Tabulah, recent immigrants from Lebanon) all receive similar notices. Believing on common principle that the government cannot evict him unwillingly from his treasured home, Darryl attempts to fight the eviction. Agents from the airport try to bribe and bully the family into giving up, but their actions only stiffen the Kerrigans' resolve. Darryl hires an incompetent lawyer acquaintance, Dennis Denuto ([[Tiriel Mora]]), but Dennis's meagre argument that the eviction goes against "the vibe" of the Constitution does not go well in court. While awaiting the court's final decision, Darryl makes pleasant small talk with a man whom he meets outside the courthouse, Lawrence Hammill ([[Bud Tingwell]]), who has come to watch his son (a barrister) perform in court. The court rejects the family's appeal and gives them two weeks to vacate. The purchase price for the home is scarcely enough to cover a small apartment. Dejected in defeat, the family begins to pack.  A new breath of hope comes with the surprise arrival of Lawrence, who reveals himself as a retired [[Queen's Counsel]]. Lawrence has taken an interest in the Kerrigans' case and offers to argue before the [[High Court of Australia]] on their behalf, [[Pro bono publico|gratis]]. Lawrence makes a persuasive case that the Kerrigans have the right to just terms of compensation for acquisition of property under [[Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution]]. He closes by paraphrasing Darryl's own comments that his house is more than just a structure of bricks and mortar, but a home built with love and shared memories. The court rules in favour of the Kerrigans, and their case becomes a landmark [[precedent]] on the subject. An [[epilogue]] shows that the Kerrigans continue to prosper happily, and Lawrence becomes a lasting friend of the family.

The Chambermaid on the Titanic
 In 1912, the protagonist, Horty, leads an uneventful life as a foundry worker in the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] region of northern France with his wife, Zoe, "the most beautiful woman in town." The owner of the foundry where Horty works, Simeon, lusts after Zoe. When Horty wins a company athletic contest, Simeon's prize is a ticket to [[Southampton]] to see the sailing of the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.  The night before the ''Titanic'' departs, Horty meets a beautiful young woman named Marie, who explains that she is a chambermaid aboard the ''Titanic''. Marie has nowhere to sleep because all of the local hotels are full, and Horty agrees to share his room. Their encounter is seemingly chaste, with Marie sleeping in the bed while Horty spends the night in the armchair. However, in the middle of the night Marie tries to seduce him. Whether or not she succeeds is ambiguous, and she is gone when Horty awakes. Attending the departure of the Titanic, Horty spots a photographer taking a picture of Marie, and asks the photographer for the photo.  Upon returning home, Horty finds that he has been promoted, but this good news is dampened by rumors of an affair between his wife, Zoe, and the foundry owner, Simeon. A bitter and jealous Horty visits a local bar to drown his sorrows. Drunk, he tells friends and co-workers about the lovely chambermaid he met in Southampton, earning him free drinks and tips. Following the sinking of the Titanic, Horty's tales become increasingly erotic, and the viewer is never sure what is truth and what is fantasy.  Horty catches the attention of a traveling entertainer named Zeppe. Zeppe offers Horty the chance to escape his dismal dreary life. Horty agrees and begins to work with Zeppe, converting his story into a play. One night, Zoe attends the play; later, Horty explains his tale as a work of fiction. However, Horty's story becomes more elaborate and romantic attracting a larger audience for each re-telling steadily driving a wedge between him and his wife. Eventually Zoe demands a part in the performance, playing the role of Marie poignantly fighting against the waves after the ''Titanic'' sinks. The film ends by revealing why Marie would sleep with Horty.  
Chasing Amy
 Holden McNeil ([[Ben Affleck]]) and Banky Edwards ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) are comic book artists and lifelong friends. They meet fellow comic book artist Alyssa Jones ([[Joey Lauren Adams]]) at a [[comic book convention]] in [[New York City]], where they are promoting their comic ''[[Bluntman and Chronic]]''. Holden is attracted to Alyssa, but soon learns that she is a lesbian. The two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.  This new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who hates and mistrusts Alyssa and is disturbed by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a [[threesome]] with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname "[[fingercuffs|Finger Cuffs]]". Holden is deeply upset by this revelation, having previously believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, and clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing. During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her "many" youthful sexual experimentations. She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with. However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling disillusioned and furious.  Later, during lunch with [[Jay and Silent Bob]] ([[Jason Mewes]] and [[Kevin Smith]]), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's. Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his neurosis about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her. Angry at himself for letting her go, he has "spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak."  Moved by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his estranged friendship with Banky. He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend. He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him—kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests a [[threesome]]. Though initially shocked, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his "whore." Banky then gets up and enters his bedroom and closes the door without saying a word.  One year later, both Banky and Alyssa are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in [[New York City|New York]]. It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over ''Bluntman and Chronic'', leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''). Banky smiles sadly at seeing Holden, who silently congratulates him for his success on his own solo comic. Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement to Holden to go talk to her. He has a brief, quietly emotional conversation with Alyssa, and gives her a copy of ''Chasing Amy'', his new comic based on their failed relationship. It's revealed that Holden's career in comics ended completely after this. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend (Virginia Smith) arrives and asks who she was talking to. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa replies, "Oh, just some guy I knew."  
Character (film)
 In the Netherlands of the 1920s, Dreverhaven (Decleir), a dreaded bailiff, is found dead, with a knife sticking out of his stomach. The obvious suspect is Jacob Willem Katadreuffe (Van Huêt), an ambitious young lawyer who worked his way up from poverty, always managing to overcome Dreverhaven's personal attacks against him. Katadreuffe was seen leaving Dreverhaven's office on the afternoon of the murder. He is arrested and taken to police headquarters, where he reflects back on the story of his long relationship with Dreverhaven, who, police learn, is also Katadreuffe's father.  The story begins when Katadreuffe's taciturn mother, Joba (played by Schuurman), worked as a housekeeper for Dreverhaven. During that time, they had sex only once (it is implied that the encounter was forced upon Joba). She becomes pregnant and leaves her employer to make a living for herself and her son. Time and again, she rejects Dreverhaven's offers by mail of money and marriage.  Even as a child, Katadreuffe finds that his path crosses with Dreverhaven, often with dire consequences. When he is arrested for becoming involved in a boyish theft and tells the police that Dreverhaven is his father, Dreverhaven refuses to recognize him as his son. When, as a young man, he unwittingly takes a loan from a bank that Dreverhaven owns to purchase a failed [[cigar]] store, Dreverhaven sues him to win the money back and force him into bankruptcy. Still, Katadreuffe manages to pay back the debt, finding a clerical position in the law firm retained to pursue him for his cigar-store debt.  He manages to secure this job, even though most of his education is derived from reading an incomplete English-language [[encyclopedia]] that he finds as a boy in his mother's apartment; studying this set, he manages to teach himself English, which turns out to be a valuable talent in the eyes of his employers.  After paying back the cigar-store debt, Katadreuffe immediately seeks a second loan from Dreverhaven, so that he can finance his education and legal studies and, ultimately, take and pass the bar examination. Dreverhaven agrees, on the condition that he can call back the loan at any time. Despite the bailiff's efforts to hinder his son, Katadreuffe passes his bar examination and qualifies as a lawyer. On the afternoon when his firm holds a celebration of his becoming a lawyer (the day with which the film begins, the day of the murder), Katadreuffe storms into Dreverhaven's office to confront his lifelong tormentor, the bailiff.  Katadreuffe reacts with rage to Dreverhaven's congratulations, and his offer of a handshake, and, though he at first turns to leave, he runs toward Dreverhaven and attempts to attack him. After a bloody and angry brawl, Katadreuffe is witnessed leaving the bailiff's office.  However, the police discover that Katadreuffe left Dreverhaven at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., though an examination of the bailiff's body reveals that Dreverhaven died at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. The police finally reveal to Katadreuffe that Dreverhaven actually committed suicide.  After Katadreuffe is cleared, a police official hands him a document, left by Dreverhaven's lawyer, that turns out to be the bailiff's will, which leaves all of his considerable wealth to Katadreuffe. The will is signed "Vader" (Father).

Chandralekha (1997 film)
 Appukuttan Nair or 'Appu' ([[Mohanlal]]) is a struggling unemployed youth who arrives in Mumbai to meet his sister and brother-in-law ([[Augustine (actor)|Augustine]]). His father has been falsely implicated in a bank fraud and wants to sell his ancestral property to pay towards the litigation. For that he needs his sister's approval, but is abused and turned away by his brother-in-law. Disappointed, Appu seeks out his old pal Nooruddin or 'Noor' ([[Sreenivasan]]), who is working in a fruit juice vending shop in Mumbai. Noor himself is a hapless uneducated youth working for his uncle Beeran ([[Mamukkoya]]), who is a treacherous money lender, with a hope to marry his daughter Maimoona. They plan to open a paint shop but need 1.25 lakh Rupees to rent a shop as prerequisite to get a bank loan. With no other way in sight, they swindle Beeran out of 1.25 lakh Rupees. Appukuttan then tries to get the loan sanctioned but he is rebuffed by a new Bank manager Varghese ([[Maniyanpilla Raju]]) who had taken charge by then.  In a turn of events Appukkuttan happens to rescue a woman called Chandrika Varma or 'Chandra' ([[Sukanya (actress)|Sukanya]]) after a car accident, hospitalizing her. Chandra is the daughter of a wealthy businessman Udhaya Varma ([[Nedumudi Venu]]). Appukkuttan is mistaken by the hospital staff to be her husband, Alfred Fernandes or 'Alfie'. Soon her relatives including her father arrive and they too mistake him for Chandra's husband, because Chandra had eloped with Alfie, and no one among them had ever seen or talked to Alfie. Also it happened to be that Chandra was a major client of Appukkuttan's Bank Manager Varghese, who too mistook Appukkuttan for Chandra's husband, and was now eager to oblige him with the loan. Appukkuttan decides to masquerade as Alfie till he gets loan approval from the Bank Manager. Chandra lay bedridden paralysed unable to react, but with her cognition intact was able to witness all the commotions around her.  Some of the relatives of Chandra were never convinced about Appukuttan from the outset. Beeran is also hot on Appukuttan's trail to retrieve his money. To make matters worse for Appukkuttan enters the second heroine Lekha ([[Pooja Batra]]), a close friend of Chandra and who is a medical graduate. She had talked to Alfie on the phone previously and is immediately suspicious about Appukkuttan. The relatives join with Lekha to find out the truth. Lekha and others play cat and mouse with Appukkuttan trying to uncover his veracity, with Appukkuttan staying ahead of the game for a while. Finally Lekha fortuitously comes to know the real story of Appukkuttan but she is moved by his plight and enamored by his openhearted nature. In the meantime Chandra revives from her paralysis but she too forgives Appukkuttan for everything; also she had developed a liking for him. But one of the jealous relatives of Chandra ([[Cochin Haneefa]]) manages to expose Appukkuttan before everyone. Then Chandra admits all the truth to everyone. Her was not in fact a car accident but was a suicide attempt after her fiancé, the real Alfie, had betrayed her, and their marriage had never commenced. But she was now in love with Appukkuttan and hoped to marry him. Chandra recovers fully under the loving care of Appu and Lekha. But later Chandra discovers that Lekha was already in love with Appukkuttan, and had in fact given way for her as a favor to Chandra's father, to whom Lekha was like a second daughter. Chandra gracefully withdraws from her planned marriage with Appukkuttan, and Appukkuttan and Lekha are united together with everyone's hearty blessings.

Champions (1997 film)
 William Rockman, a former "Terminal Combat" champion, enter in a new tournament to revenge his brother death.  
Chinese Box
 The movie unfolds at least nine different stories on very different levels.  First, there is John as a reporter, trying to capture interesting scenes on the streets of Hong Kong, persuading himself his work gives his life a tangible meaning.  Second, there is Vivian who is looking to find a balance in life, trying to escape from the underground she once was a part of and forget about her past, but is hindered in her attempts by prejudices that go back thousands of years in the Chinese society (including Hong Kong).  Third, there is Vivian (still), with a chance to discard most of her problems by simply marrying John and moving to England with him. Even though she is tempted to do so, she knows this would just be running away from the core of the problem and could not be a long-term solution, mostly because of their different cultural backgrounds and maybe even because of a subtle uncertainty regarding John's ex-wife and former life.  Fourth, there is Jean, with her own story and with a typical Hong Kong here-today-who-knows-where-tomorrow attitude - living the moment, enjoying and suffering at the same time, embodying a perfect reflection of modern life, especially so easily seen in Hong Kong in the late 1990s. She understands all of the different kinds of hardships that come in life and, with her face somewhat disfigured, is marked more intensely than most, but also knows where to draw the line in selling herself. John tries to help her, but does that in a dishonest way, which disappoints her tremendously. According to a note in film's credits, Jean's story was inspired by a short story by the American-British author [[Rachel Ingalls]].<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/articles/wayne-wang,13516/ The A.V. Club]</ref><ref>[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie980416-6,0,6006146.story Calendarlive.com]</ref>  Fifth, there are John and Jim. Close, mutually understanding, with enough humor and sarcasm to keep them going through both the good and the bad days. Even though their outlooks towards life differ significantly, their love for the job (journalism) creates a strong bond of true friendship.  Sixth, there is Chang, a man of power, of high position, but a wimp in his heart. His immense wealth cannot replace what he lacks in personality. He has no charisma, no morality, no care, and exists purely on his imaginary throne of pretentiousness and status. While he is ashamed of Vivian, he does love her, but in a pathetic, cowardly way. He is very much into 'saving face' and can not find an equilibrium in his life (professional nor personal). He agrees to marry Vivian, but deceives her by arranging merely a mock wedding photo session, so she could have some pictures to send to her family. Vivian burns all of the photos and accepts the notion she will never be happy or free.  Seventh, there are John and Vivian. A story of true love that just isn't meant to be. Not because they wouldn't want it to, but because of the constraints of the societies they live in.  Eighth, there is John (again), perplexed with his own mortality, which he is suddenly forced to face.  Ninth, there is the political aspect of Hong Kong politically becoming a part of China again, which (at the time) was a great uncertainty.  
Children of Heaven
 The film starts with Ali fetching his little sister Zahra's pink shoes after a cobbler has repaired them. He leaves them unattended to buy some potatoes. While he is pre-occupied, a homeless man picks up the shoes, hidden in a bag, thinking it was garbage and takes them away. Frantic to find them, the young boy, thinking the shoes fell behind the crates, knocks over plates of vegetables and is chased away by the grocer.  Ali's family lives in a poor South [[Tehran]] neighbourhood, and are having financial trouble, so he fears to tell his parents about the mishap. The landlord argues with Ali's mother because she is five months behind on the rent, and the grocer has not been paid in a while either. Ali tells Zahra about the shoes and begs her not to tell their mother; she agrees. That night, Ali's father scolds him for not helping his ill mother when she asked. While the siblings were doing their homework, they passed notes to each other discussing what to do. They devise a scheme to share Ali's [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] sneakers: Zahra will wear them to school in the morning and return them to Ali at midday so he can attend afternoon classes. Ali does well on a test and his teacher awards him a gold-colored pen with the others in his class that got good grades; he gives it to Zahra to partially make up for losing her shoes. However, the uncomfortable arrangement between him and his sister leads to Ali being late three times in a row, no matter how hard he runs; the first time the principal ignores him, the second time he gives him a warning, the third time he tells Ali to leave and return with his father who is at work trying to make money. Ali's teacher, noticing Ali's tears, persuades the principal that Ali is at the top of his class and to give the boy one more chance and let him back into class.  One day, Zahra notices her missing pink shoes on another student, Roya's, feet. After class, Zahra secretly follows Roya home. She later brings Ali with her for a confrontation, but from hiding, they discover that Roya's father, the garbageman, is blind, so they decide to leave. When Roya does well in her studies, her father buys her new blue shoes and throws away Zahra's. Zahra is dismayed when she finds out from her new friend.  Ali's father, anxious to earn more money, borrows some gardening equipment and heads off with Ali to the rich suburbs of [[North Tehran]] to find some gardening work. They try many places without success, though Ali proves to be a great help to his tongue-tied father. Finally, they come upon a mansion in which a six-year-old boy named Alireza lives under the care of his grandfather. While Ali plays with Alireza, his father works. When he is finished, Ali's father is surprised and elated by how generous the grandfather is. On the way home, Ali mentions in passing that Zahra could use a new pair of shoes; his father says that new shoes for his children is a good idea, however, their elation is short lived as their bicycle's brakes fail and the father is injured in the resulting crash.  Finally, Ali learns of a high-profile children's 4 kilometer footrace involving many schools; the third prize is one week at a vacation camp and a pair of sneakers. Ali sees this as his chance to earn a new pair of shoes for Zahra. To his bitter disappointment, in a hard-fought dash to the finish, he accidentally places first instead. Ali returns home where Zahra is waiting for him. However, before he can reveal to his sister his disappointment in his placement in the race, she is called away by their mother. In a separate scene, there is a quick shot of the children's father's bicycle as he's riding home, showing a pair of white and a pair of pink shoes among his purchases. In the final shot, Ali is dejected as his sneakers are torn from the race—he is then shown dipping his bare blistered feet in a pool.  Some versions include an [[epilogue]] revealing that Ali eventually achieves success in a racing career.

 Conspiracy-theorist New York City taxi driver Jerry Fletcher continually expounds his ideas to his friend Alice Sutton, a lawyer at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. She humors him because he once saved her from a mugging, but does not know he has been spying on her at home. Her own work is to solve the mystery of her father's murder. Seeing suspicious activity everywhere, Jerry identifies some men as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] workers, follows them into a building, and is captured. A doctor injects a wheelchair-bound Jerry with [[LSD]] and interrogates him using torture. Jerry experiences terrifying hallucinations and flashbacks, panics, and manages to escape, incapacitating the doctor by biting his nose.  Handcuffed to the hospital bed and forced into a drug-induced sleep, Jerry persuades Alice to switch his chart with that of a criminal in the next bed or he will be dead by morning. When Alice visits the next day, the criminal is dead, allegedly from a mysterious heart attack. The CIA, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and other agencies are there, led by CIA psychiatrist Dr. Jonas, whose nose is bandaged. Meanwhile, with Alice's help, Jerry fakes a heart attack and escapes again. The pair go to Alice's apartment and Jerry accidentally reveals he's been watching her. Jerry confronts FBI agent Lowry and his partner staking out her place, and he warns them at gunpoint not to hurt her. Jerry sees their operatives rappelling down from black helicopters and hides in a theater, escaping by causing a panic.  Alice calls each person on Jerry's newsletter mail-list and finds that all have recently died, except one. Jerry uses a ruse to get her out of the office, and then immobilizes the operatives watching her. During their escape, he tells her that he loves her, then flees on a subway train when she brushes off his feelings. She goes to see the last surviving person on the subscription list, and finds it is Jonas. He explains that Jerry was brainwashed during Dr. Jonas' time with [[Project MKUltra]] to become an assassin and claims that Jerry killed her father. She agrees to help find Jerry, who sends her a message to meet him. They ditch the agents following them and he drives her to her father's private horse stables in Connecticut, but Alice secretly calls her office so that Jonas can track her. At the stables, Jerry remembers that he was sent to kill her father but found he could not. Jerry instead promised to watch over Alice before the judge was killed by another assassin. Jonas' men capture Jerry, and a sniper tries to get Alice, but she escapes.  Meanwhile, Alice finds Lowry and forces him at gunpoint to admit that he is not FBI, but from a "secret agency that watches the other agencies" and has been using the unwitting Jerry to uncover and stop Jonas. Alice goes to the site of the smokestacks from Jerry's mural and sees a mental hospital next door. There she bribes an attendant to show her an unused wing, breaks in, and finds Jerry. As Jonas catches them, Lowry arrives with his men and attacks Jonas' men. Jerry attempts to drown Jonas, but is shot. After killing Jonas, Alice finally tells Jerry she loves him before he is taken away in an ambulance. Some time later, Alice visits Jerry's grave, leaving a pin he gave her upon it, before returning to horse riding. While watching from a car with Lowry, Jerry agrees not to contact Alice until all of Jonas' other subjects are caught, but she finds the pin attached to her saddle.  
Contact (1997 American film)
 Dr. Ellie Arroway works for the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] program at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in Puerto Rico. Guided into  science and communication by her now-deceased father, she listens to radio emissions from space, hoping to find evidence of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]]. David Drumlin, the president's science advisor, pulls the funding from SETI, because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S.&nbsp;R. Hadden, which allows her to continue the project at the [[Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array|Very Large Array]] in New Mexico.  Four years later, with Drumlin seeking to close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a sequence of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system [[Vega]] some 26 [[light-year]]s away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] led by Michael Kitz to attempt to take control of the facility. Arroway's team then discover a second signal and find a video buried in the new signal: [[Adolf Hitler]]'s opening address at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.  The project is put under tight security and its progress followed worldwide. Arroway learns that when the original frames of the Hitler video combined with the modified version shows that the signal also contains more than 63,000 pages of indecipherable data. The reclusive Hadden secretly meets with Arroway to provide the means to decode the pages, found when they are arranged in three dimensions rather than two-dimensional pages. The pages reveal schematics for a complex machine that is determined to be some kind of transport for a single occupant.  The nations of the world fund the construction of the machine at [[Cape Canaveral]]. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in [[Puerto Rico]]. When he brings attention to her [[atheism]], the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day the machine is tested, a religious terrorist destroys the machine in a [[Suicide attack|suicide bombing]], killing Drumlin and many others.  A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in residence on the [[Mir|Mir space station]], reveals to Arroway that a second machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway will be the one to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of [[wormhole]]s. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Pensacola, [[Florida]], and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.  Arroway falls unconscious as she begins traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A [[United States congressional committee|Congressional Committee]] is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and [[White House]] official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to increase the number of dishes at the V.L.A. from 27 to 72.  
Con Air
   [[Honorable discharge|Honorably discharged]] [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Ranger]] Cameron Poe is given a ten-year prison sentence for [[manslaughter]] after killing a drunken man who tried to attack his pregnant wife Tricia, communicating with his newborn daughter Casey through letters. Eight years later, he is [[parole]]d and takes a flight to [[Alabama]] on board the ''Jailbird'', a [[Fairchild C-123 Provider]] converted into a flying prison transport. Poe is accompanied by his [[diabetes|diabetic]] cellmate and friend Mike “Baby-O” O’Dell, who is being transferred. The flight is overseen by [[U.S. Marshal]] Vince Larkin, who is approached by [[DEA]] agents Duncan Malloy and Willie Sims, the latter planning to go [[undercover operation|undercover]] to get information from drug lord Francisco Cindino, who is to be picked up en route.  A number of inmates are being transferred to a new [[supermax prison]], including mass murderer William "Billy Bedlam" Bedford, rapist John “Johnny 23” Baca, [[Black Guerrilla Family]] member Nathan “Diamond Dog” Jones, and criminal mastermind “Cyrus the Virus” Grissom. After taking off, inmate Joe “Pinball” Parker incites a [[prison riot|riot]], releasing Grissom and Diamond Dog and taking over the plane. The hijacking inmates plot to land at [[Carson Airport]] as scheduled, pick up and transfer other prisoners, and then fly to a non-[[extradition]] country. Sims tries to take control of the plane, but Grissom kills him. Poe and Grissom also foil Johnny 23's rape attempts on the plane's only female guard, Sally Bishop.  The plane arrives at Carson City as scheduled and the inmate exchange commences, with the ground crew unaware that the hijackers are disguised as guards. As the transfer begins, most of the plane’s guards and the pilot are forced to pose as inmates and conveyed off the plane. Amongst the new passengers are Cindino, new pilot Earl “Swamp Thing” Williams, and [[serial killer]] Garland Greene. The authorities discover the hijacking upon finding evidence in Grissom’s old cell and a tape recorder placed with the disguised guards by Poe, but are unable to stop the plane from taking off. Meanwhile, Pinball, sent by the inmates to dispose of the plane's [[transponder]] to keep it from being detected, tries but fails to make it back to the hijacked plane.   The inmates plan to land at Lerner Airport, an abandoned airstrip in the desert, and transfer onto another plane owned by Cindino and his [[drug cartel|cartel]]. Poe finds Pinball’s corpse trapped in the landing gear, writing a message to the U.S. Marshals on the body before throwing it out. Larkin learns of the news and heads out to Lerner after contacting the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. Bedford, raiding the cargo, discovers Poe’s identity when he reads his parole letter and finds a toy bunny, forcing Poe to kill him.  The ''Jailbird'' is grounded at Lerner, with no sign of the transfer aircraft. Poe warns the other inmates of Cindino's past acts of deceit and betrayal, and thus Grissom orders the others to fuel up the plane and get it ready for takeoff. Poe leaves to find Baby-O some [[insulin]] shots, meeting Larkin and informing him of the situation. The duo discover Cindino planning to escape on a hidden [[private jet]], with Larkin sabotaging it as it takes off. Grissom executes Cindino by igniting the crashed plane’s fuel. Meanwhile, Johnny 23, assigned as the sentry in the control tower, spots a National Guard convoy approaching and gives the alarm. The inmates quickly find a cache of fully loaded shotguns and assault rifles in the plane's cargo hold (originally assigned to guards) and prepare an ambush. As the National Guardsmen arrive, the inmates launch an assault; some are killed, but Larkin defends the surviving troops using a [[bulldozer]] as a makeshift shield. Several inmates are killed, and the rest flee back onto the ''Jailbird'' and take flight.   Poe’s identity is revealed when Bedford’s body is found. Grissom is about to execute him and Baby-O when Larkin and Malloy arrive in [[attack helicopter]]s, launching machine gun fire at it and damaging the ''Jailbird''’s fuel tank. Though Larkin orders the plane to land at [[McCarran International Airport]], Swamp Thing is forced to land it on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], causing mass destruction and killing Johnny 23. Cyrus, Diamond Dog, and Swamp Thing escape on a [[fire truck]], pursued by Poe and Larkin on police motorcycles, leading to the deaths of all three convicts. Most of the other convicts are quickly taken back into custody. Poe and Larkin form a friendship, just as Tricia and Casey arrive. Poe meets his daughter for the first time and gives her the toy rabbit he bought for her. The only criminal unaccounted for is Garland, now living the high life as a Las Vegas gambler.

One day, just as the pair are beginning to make love for the first time, Adriani returns after many months in jail. The village rejoices, but the men soon have to leave to work at a performance and the two lovebirds sneak off to be together. While they are away, Adriani goes to the local bar, where he murders a man that he accuses of being responsible for his imprisonment. Adriani escapes, but a mob follows him and burns the village to the ground, killing him. Stéphane and Sabina return to find the smoldering ruins and are both devastated. They hurry to the concert venue and tell Izidor, who races outside and begs the earth to open and reunite him with his son.  Stéphane leaves the village and drives to the mile marker where the film opened. Grief-stricken, he smashes all the tapes he recorded during his travels with Sabina on the stone marker and buries them. He then drinks from a vodka bottle, spills some on the "grave" of the tapes, lays the bottle of the "grave" and then dances as Izidor did at his brother's funeral. A shot of the back of the car reveals Sabina sleeping in the back seat. She wakes up, notices the impromptu "funeral" that Stéphane is holding and smiles before the screen fades to black.

Crayon Shin-chan: Pursuit of the Balls of Darkness
 One day Shin-chan on his way back found a ball near a river and brought it home. Himawari saw that ball and swallowed it as she loves shining things. Later it was known that it was a mysterious ball that belonged to Devil Jack and two gangs for which they were fighting with each other for getting the ball. It was considered that they could win the world with that ball by releasing the Devil Jack. Himawari was kidnapped by the king Jed, but later she was released. Devil Jack was accidentally released by Shin-chan.  But to their shock Jack wasn't evil anymore and didn't have his powers (though he said he ties them in his hair) because he died and showed his expire date and said that the one who is alive is the best! Misae and Hiroshi thought it was just a waste of time because the world wasn't going to be destroyed. Furious, King Jed tried to flee by capturing Himawari. He said that he would throw her from the building if they tried to stop him. The clumsy female police officer Yone Higashimatsuyama tried to stop Jed by her poor marksmanship. But then, Shin-chan leaped on her and her shot hit the right spot. Jed threw Himawari and Shin-chan caught her and the rest of the good gang helped them. And they saved Himawari.  The police came and arrested the evil gang. Yone said that they were late and she already captured them in joy. In the end the Nohara Family returned home. Then Midori Yoshinaga came and asked why Shin-chan did not come to school for two days. Misae quickly gave Shin-chan's school clothes and said, "Sorry, can he change inside?". Hiroshi was late for his office so he asked if they could give him a ride. When the bus strode away Shiro came home and Misae told them that he would be hungry (as they left him at the train station by fault). In the bus Ume Matsuzaka was late to and Nene said that adults can do anything they want. Kazama and the rest of the friends asked Shin-chan where did he go and he simply replied that he was busy saving the world.

Coolie (1997 film)
  
Cube (film)
 A man named Alderson awakens in a cube-shaped room with a [[trap door|hatch]] in each wall, the ceiling and the floor, each of which leads to other cube-shaped rooms, identical except for their color. He enters an orange room and, without warning, is cut to pieces by a wire grid that swings down from the ceiling.  In another such room, five people – Quentin, Worth, Holloway, Rennes, and Leaven – meet. None of them knows where they are or how they got there. Quentin informs the others that some rooms contain traps, which he learned by nearly being killed by one. Rennes assumes each trap is triggered by a [[motion detector]] and tests each room by throwing one of his boots in first. Leaven notices numbers inscribed in the passageways between rooms. Quentin recognizes Rennes as "The Wren," a convict who has escaped from seven prisons. After declaring one room trap-free, Rennes enters and is killed when he is sprayed with acid. The others realize that there are different kinds of detectors, and Quentin deduces that this trap was triggered by heat.  Quentin believes each person has a reason for being there. He is a police officer, Leaven a [[mathematics]] student, Holloway a physician and [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]], and the surly Worth declines to talk about himself. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a [[prime number]] is a trap. They find a mentally challenged man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. When Quentin injures his leg in a room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, tensions rise due to personality conflicts and lack of faith in Leaven's system. Quentin provokes Worth into an argument about finding the exit, and Worth accidentally reveals that he has knowledge of the Cube. Worth admits that he designed the Cube's outer shell for a shadowy bureaucracy and guesses that its original purpose has been forgotten; they have been imprisoned within simply to put it to use.  Worth's knowledge of the outer shell's size allows Leaven to determine that each side of the Cube is 26 rooms across and that there are 17,576 rooms in total. She guesses that the numbers indicate the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the rooms. The group moves toward the nearest edge as determined by her theory, but each of the rooms near the outer wall is trapped. Rather than backtrack, they travel silently through a room with a sound-activated trap. After Kazan makes a sound and nearly causes Quentin's death, Quentin threatens Kazan. Holloway defends Kazan and provokes Quentin into an argument by calling him a Nazi. The acrimonious argument escalates until Quentin slaps her, further increasing tension within the group. When they reach the edge, Holloway scouts the gap between the Cube and its outer shell, but slips during a violent quake; Quentin initially saves her, but then lets her fall to her death and reports it to the others as an accident.  Quentin attempts to persuade Leaven to abandon the others with him and makes a sexual advance, but she rejects him. When Quentin becomes aggressive, Worth intervenes; Quentin beats him savagely and drops him through a floor hatch. Worth laughs hysterically at what he finds — Rennes's corpse. The group is demoralized by the thought of having been wandering in circles. Worth realizes that the rooms move periodically through the Cube, and this is the source of the quaking. Leaven deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers, but by [[Prime power|powers of prime numbers]]. Much to Quentin's surprise, Kazan reveals himself to be an [[autistic savant]]<ref></ref> who can quickly do [[prime factorisation]]s mentally. With Kazan's help, Leaven guides them to a bridge room which will lead them out of the maze in two movements. Worth preemptively ambushes Quentin and leaves him behind. Kazan opens the supposed final door, revealing a bright white light, but Worth declines to leave the Cube, as he has lost faith in humanity.  Leaven objects and attempts to convince Worth to join her, but Quentin reappears, kills her, and mortally wounds Worth. As Quentin moves to kill Kazan, Worth expends the last of his strength to grab Quentin's leg, pinning him in the passageway as the rooms shift again. Quentin is torn apart, and Worth crawls back to Leaven's corpse and dies next to her. Kazan then slowly walks into the bright light, his ultimate fate unknown.  
Cure (film)
 Kenichi Takabe ([[Kōji Yakusho]]) is an emotionally repressed police detective with a mentally unstable wife. Takabe investigates a series of bizarre murders in which each victim is killed in the same way, with a large "X" carved into their neck, but the perpetrator is different each time. In every case the murderers are caught close to the scene of the crime, and although they readily confess to committing the crimes, they never have a substantial motive and cannot explain what drove them to kill.  Takabe, together with a psychologist named Sakuma ([[Tsuyoshi Ujiki]]), eventually determines that one man is the common thread among the murders, as each person he comes in contact with commits a killing shortly thereafter. The man, called Mamiya ([[Masato Hagiwara]]), appears to have extreme short-term memory loss; he seems constantly confused about what day it is, where he is, and what his name is. He claims to recall nothing of his past. Mamiya constantly counters Takabe's interrogation with evasive questions regarding Takabe's identity. This drives Takabe nearly insane as he gradually loses his initial calmness. The futility of the case starts to affect his psyche as he becomes more and more volatile, exploding into violent fits of anger.  Takabe discovers that Mamiya used to be a student of psychology who researched [[mesmerism]] and [[hypnosis]]. He comes to realize that Mamiya has no memory problems, and is instead a master of hypnosis, capable of planting criminal suggestions in strangers' minds by exposing them to repetitive sounds, the motion of water, or the flame of a lighter. Sakuma also finds a videotape of a mysterious man, speculated to be the originator of mesmerism, hypnotizing a woman by gesturing an "X" midair, and shows the video to Takabe at his house. After showing the tape, Sakuma is shown to have unconsciously drawn an X on his wall, and starts to experience hallucinations of Takabe menacingly cornering him. Several days later, the police discover Sakuma's body in his home, and conclude that he commited suicide. Meanwhile, Mamiya is jailed and charged with incitement to murder.  Mamiya finds Takabe fascinating, possibly because he cannot force Takabe to kill. Takabe does have visions of his wife ([[Anna Nakagawa]]) dead, however, and the more he studies Mamiya, the more he feels that he might be losing his mind. He becomes more and more frustrated with his wife's helplessness and even expresses murderous intent towards her at one point. His wife's strange behavior and concerns about his own mental stability lead him to have her committed to a mental hospital. When Mamiya escapes, killing a policeman and a doctor in the process, Takabe tracks him to a deserted building in the wilderness and shoots him. The film ends ambiguously, in which a waitress suddenly draws out a knife, seemingly ready to kill her supervisor after talking to Takabe, and suggests that Mamiya's bizarre work is being carried out inadvertently by Takabe himself.

Dante's Peak
   [[Galeras tragedy|In 1993]], [[United States Geological Survey]] [[volcanologist]] Dr. Harry Dalton and his colleague and fiance, Marianne, attempt to escape an eruption in [[Colombia]]. Marianne is killed by a piece of volcanic debris.  Four years later, Harry is assigned by his superior, Dr. Paul Dreyfus, to investigate seismic activity near Dante's Peak, [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], a town that borders a [[dormant volcano|dormant]] [[stratovolcano]]. Harry arrives at the town and meets the mayor, Rachel Wando, and her children, Graham and Lauren.  Rachel offers to take Harry with them as they visit her former mother-in-law, Ruth, who lives near a lake at the base of the volcano. While exploring, they encounter multiple casualties, including two people boiled to death in a hot spring. Harry calls Paul to report his concerns about the area around the volcano.   Paul arrives with a USGS team that evening, and they set up a research outpost in a motel to monitor the volcano. Although Paul and Harry have a disagreement about the volcano, Harry decides to stay for a few more nights since he believes the disturbances are signs of an impending eruption. Harry and Rachel talk about their lives and grow closer. Harry again discusses his concerns regarding the volcano to Paul, but Paul dismisses him because the data contradicts his claims.  Days after the USGS set up camp to monitor the volcano, Harry and Terry venture inside the mountain's crater with a robot, "Spider Legs". During Terry's examination, a tremor shakes the mountain, causing him to be buried in the rocky debris, breaking his leg. A helicopter rescues Harry and Terry and lifts them out of the crater.  Soon after they got back to the town, as Terry is being placed in an ambulance, Harry argues with Paul, saying that the quake was [[Harmonic tremor|harmonic]], and to put the town on alert. But Paul dismisses his claims. After days of no activity, Paul decides to leave and monitor the volcano from their headquarters. Harry cedes in defeat. During that night when Harry goes to say goodbye to Rachel, they discover that the town's water is contaminated with [[Sulfur dioxide|sulfur dioxide]]. The team realizes the volcano will erupt. Paul calls the National Guard for assistance, he instructs Harry to notify Rachel to call for a town meeting.   During the town meeting at the high school, tremors shake the gymnasium before the volcano erupts, forcing the residents to flee. Harry and Rachel drive to get Graham and Lauren, who have left to pick up Ruth, who refuses to leave her cabin.   At Ruth's cabin, Harry and Rachel are reunited with the kids and Ruth. However, Ruth still refuses to leave. Harry contacts the USGS team while Rachel packs. As they are leaving the cabin, a [[lava flow]] engulfs it and destroys the vehicles and everything in its path. The five escape across the lake in a motorboat. However, halfway across, they notice that all the fish in the lake are dead. The lake has become acidic due to [[sulfur]]-rich gases from the volcano. The acid corrodes the motor and eats away at the boat as they drift in the lake.  Nearing a dock, Ruth jumps out of the boat and into the acidic water and pulls the boat towards it. She collapses on land, with severe chemical burns and dies.  The heat from the volcano melts the snow on the mountain, and, combined with downed timber and ruptures a nearby dam. Harry and the Wandos finds a truck from a [[Park ranger|ranger's]] station and goes back to town. The National Guard, having evacuated the town, leaves with the USGS team. The convoy gets caught in flow that destabilized the bridge with debris, knocking it off its foundation. The convoy crosses the bridge to safety, but Paul, driving the team's van, is washed away to his death as the bridge flips over.  Harry and the Wandos are stopped by a crusted lava flow. With more fresh lava coming down the hill, Harry frantically tries to drive the truck over the cooled crusted lava. But lava pockets bursts to burn the truck's tires, making it more difficult for them to cross. While driving across, they notice Ruth's dog, Roughy on a ridge. Rachel catches Roughy as it jumped into the truck just as fresh lava flowed over the road behind them.  Seeing their only way out of town was washed out by the flood, they return back to town, where Harry retrieves a [[distress radiobeacon]]. Before leaving, he checks the laptop that is monitoring the volcano where he learns that the volcano is preparing for a final catastrophic eruption. As they head towards the town's abandoned mine, where Graham previously used as a hideout, the volcano [[Lateral eruption|laterally]] explodes. The [[pyroclastic flow]] rushes down the mountain, obliterating everything in its path. Harry crashes the truck into the entrance of the mine just before the flow gets to them. The remaining USGS team watches the eruption and believes Harry to be dead.  Inside the mine, Harry and the Wandos regroup in the hideout. Graham tells them what supplies they have, while Rachel checks their wounds. Harry realizes he left the beacon in the truck and sets out to get it. As he returns to the truck, the mine collapses, completely blocking and separating him. Harry suffers a open fracture with his arm and is trapped inside the truck by the falling debris. After several tries, Harry manages to successfully activate the beacon.  Back at the headquarters, Terry notices that the beacon has been activated, and realizes Harry may still be alive. The USGS dispatches search and rescue teams back to town. Harry and the Wandos are rescued from the collapsed mine. The closing shot of the film shows the devastation of the town and the volcano with a large [[Mount St. Helens]]-like crater.

Daughters (film)
 In Spring 1989, sisters, Alex, and Annie Morrell, finish prep school and return home to start college. Their mother, publishing heiress [[Anne Scripps]], welcomes them in her New York mansion. Anne has recently divorced her husband Tony, and is still struggling with the divorce. Nonetheless, she is happy with her new boyfriend, much younger Scott Douglas, a volatile-tempered young man whom she marries only months after their first meeting.  From the start, Alex is uncertain if she should trust Scott, having heard stories about a possible violent past. When Anne announces that she will be having a baby, Scott is distrustful to notice how Alex reacts with doubt about the news. To get rid of her, he claims that he has found [[marijuana]] in Alex's bedroom. Alex denies the accusation, but Anne defends her boyfriend, who forces Alex to leave the house.  Shortly after Anne and Scott's baby, Tori's, birth in June 1990, Scott gets violent and beats up Anne for inviting Tony's family for the baby's coming out party. Alex and Annie encourage their mom to leave Scott, but Anne forgives him after a couple of months. By June 1991, she and Scott are a happy couple again. On Alex's 21st birthday, Scott lashes out at Anne again when he finds her smoking in the same room as Tori, and then throws a guest, Stacey, off the stairs. Enraged, Alex dares Scott to hit her, and the police interrupts their fight, only to have Scott lie about the situation. A similar occurrence takes place at a formal ball, where Scott pushes around Anne in front of her friends. As they leave, the fight continues in the car, and Scott eventually throws her out while speeding.  Three months later, Alex's charges against Scott have been dropped, though Anne has filed for divorce and attained a restraining order. The three women move on with their lives, until one night Annie is hit by her date, Mark, while Alex meets a new romantic interest, Jimmy Romeo, though a relationship is postponed due to her focus on her mother. Another setback occurs when Anne is informed that she will have to share custody of Tori. Deciding a reconciliation would be for the better, Anne meets with Scott and believes that he has changed his life for the better.  It turns out, soon, however, that Scott is still as violent as he used to be and threatens to make Tori disappear if she does not stop continuing legal proceedings. The police arrive at the mansion sometime later, though Anne is too scared to file charges. The following day, upon finding out that Scott is stealing her money and planning on running away with Tori, Anne asks for another restraining order. Alex and Annie move in with her again to protect their mother from Scott, and until Alex leaves for the holidays, they are happy again.  One day, Tony calls the mansion, and Scott answers. Believing that Anne will get back with Tony, he announces that the threats are over, and that something has to be done. As soon as Annie leaves, Scott gets drunk and grabs a hammer, killing Anne while she is asleep. Afterwards, he  jumps to his death off the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], over the Hudson River in New York, though his body is found over three months later. The girls are left behind in grief over their mother. Fifteen months later, Alex prepares to marry Jimmy, and in the aftertitles, it is revealed that she gave birth to a baby daughter.

Deconstructing Harry
 One night, Lucy ([[Judy Davis]]) gets a taxi to the home of author Harry Block ([[Woody Allen]]). She has just read Harry's latest novel. In the novel, the character Leslie ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) is having an affair with her sister's husband Ken ([[Richard Benjamin]]). Lucy is angry because the novel is patently based on her and Harry's own affair; as a result, everyone knows about it. Lucy pulls a gun out of her purse, saying she will kill herself. She then turns the gun on Harry and begins firing. She chases him out onto the roof. Harry insists that he has already been punished: his latest girlfriend Fay ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) has left him for his best friend Larry ([[Billy Crystal]]). To distract Lucy, Harry tells her a story he is currently writing: a semi-autobiographical story of a sex-obsessed young man named Harvey ([[Tobey Maguire]]) who is mistakenly claimed by Death.  In therapy, Harry realizes he has not changed since he was a sex-obsessed youth. Harry discusses the honoring ceremony at his old university, taking place the next day; he is particularly unhappy that he has nobody with whom to share the occasion. After the session, Harry asks his ex-wife Joan ([[Kirstie Alley]]) if he can take their son Hilliard ([[Eric Lloyd]]) to the ceremony. She refuses, stating that Harry is a bad influence on Hilliard. She is also furious at Harry for the novel he wrote. In it, the character Epstein ([[Stanley Tucci]]) marries Helen ([[Demi Moore]]), but the marriage begins to crumble after the birth of their son.  Harry runs into an acquaintance, Richard ([[Bob Balaban]]), who is worried about his health. After accompanying Richard to the hospital, Harry asks him to come to the university ceremony. Richard appears uninterested.  Harry then goes to meet his ex-girlfriend Fay, who reveals that she is now engaged. Harry begs Fay to get back together with him. He asks Fay to accompany him to his ceremony, but it clashes with Fay's wedding, scheduled the following day.  That night, Harry sleeps with a prostitute, Cookie ([[Hazelle Goodman]]). Harry then asks Cookie to accompany him to his ceremony.  In the morning, Richard unexpectedly arrives to join Harry and Cookie on the journey. On a whim, Harry decides to "kidnap" his son Hilliard. Along the way, they stop at a carnival, then at Harry's half-sister Doris's ([[Caroline Aaron]]). Doris, a devoted [[Jew]], is upset by Harry's portrayals of Judaism in his stories, as is her husband ([[Eric Bogosian]]). During the journey, Harry also encounters his fictional creations Ken and Helen, who force him to confront some painful truths about his life. Just before arriving at the university, Richard dies peacefully in the car.  Distressed, Harry literally slides out of focus, becoming blurred like one of his own fictional characters. Cookie helps him restore focus. The university's staffers gush over Harry, asking what he plans to write next. He describes a story about a man (based on himself) who journeys down to Hell to reclaim his true love (based on Fay) from [[the Devil]] (based on Larry - both being played by Billy Crystal).  Harry and the Devil engage in a verbal duel as to who is truly the more evil of the two.  Harry gets as far as arguing that he is a kidnapper before the story is interrupted by the arrival of the police.  Harry is arrested for kidnapping Hilliard, for possessing a gun (it was Lucy's), and for having drugs in the car (belonging to Cookie).  Larry and Fay come from their wedding to bail Harry out of jail. Harry reluctantly gives them his blessings. Back at his apartment, a miserable Harry fantasizes that the university's ceremony is taking place. Harry realizes that he can only function in art, not in life. The film ends with Harry returning to his writing.

He has a bunk bed in the room he shares with his best friend Todd Bently, Doogie and his pledge Stewy. Another of his fraternity brothers, Pete Bradley, has moved out of the frat house and into a house he shares with other students. Griff and Pete have a secret sexual relationship, but Griff's close-knit fraternity life puts a strain on it. Griff is satisfied with the arrangement, but Pete is not. Griff, Doogie, Todd, and Heather are studying at the library.  Pete is also there browsing the stacks and overhears Griff inviting girl flirt Gretchen to a fraternity party.  Pete storms out of the library with Griff quickly following. Griff tackles Pete and straddles him and asks, "What's your problem?" and "Come on Pete, what do you want from me?"  Pete tells Griff that you're my problem and tells him, "I want to wake up next to you, read the newspaper, and maybe go out on a date."  Griff realizes that Pete is ready to break up with him so Griff quickly agrees to go on a date with Pete.  Griff is annoyed to discover that Pete has tricked him into meeting at a gay [[coffeehouse]]. He runs into Sam, an out, loud, and proud activist, who is passing out flyers for a "community action patrol" to help prevent gay bashing. The juxtaposition of "closeted" and "out" gay people heightens the drama and serves as comic relief at the same time. The "date" ends with Griff telling Pete that he wants no part of the lifestyle displayed by the coffeehouse's clientele. They both leave and separate in anger with Pete walking up a dark alley and Griff getting into his Jeep. Griff then notices a black [[sport utility vehicle|truck]], going up the alley after Pete.  The next day Griff and his fraternity brothers are amazed to find out that Pete has been viciously [[gay bashing|attacked]] and is [[coma]]tose in the local hospital. Griff is obviously shocked and disoriented, but the others are concerned about the negative impact on their upcoming rush week of having a gay member of their fraternity. At a special "house meeting", Buchanan, the head of the house, tells the others that there is a criminal investigation of Pete's attack. The response of some of the fraternity brothers is anything but sympathetic to Pete.  When Griff and Todd go to the hospital to see about Pete, they are questioned by Detective Horne, who is investigating the attack, but Griff is silent about being with Pete that night because he would be [[outing]] himself at the same time. His deep love for Pete is apparent moments before when he breaks down silently in a stall in the men's room.  The tragic situation completely changes Griff: he drifts along in a daze, ignoring his friends, classwork, and fraternity responsibilities. He goes to the coffeehouse, the hospital, the place where Pete was attacked, and Pete's home. He finally meets Rachel, who is Pete's female roommate.  Griff asks Rachel if it's okay to get some of Pete's stuff to take to the hospital so he will have something when he's ready to come home.  Rachel lets Griff know that Pete really cares about him a lot.  Rachel allows Griff in Pete's room where Griff and Pete have spent lots of time together.  At the coffeehouse he sees Denetra, an [[African American]] fellow student, and his need to talk with a sympathetic listener motivates him to become friends with her.   Griff's continued preoccupation over Pete causes him to forget what he needs to do for the rush party: make sure that the house is well-stocked with alcohol and contact a [[sorority]] to invite them to the party. An emotional confrontation between the head of the house and Griff has Todd decide to take a time out with his troubled friend.  They drive up into the mountains for the night, and the next morning Todd and Griff are reminiscing about their hikes in the mountains with Pete.  Todd finally asks Griff, "Are you like in love with him dude?" Griff admits to Todd that he has never been so sure of anything as his love for Pete. He then voices his disgust for the way he treated Pete just before he was attacked. Because his failure to give important information to the police was another way he betrayed Pete, he and Todd go right to the police station so that Griff can tell Detective Horne that he was with Pete just before he was attacked and that he saw a black [[sport utility vehicle|truck]] going up the alley after him.  Pete's father Mr. Bradley has a brief encounter with Griff in the hospital waiting room and sternly tells Griff to never let his son down again.  When Griff and Todd get back to the frat house they see Doogie's friend Smitty there with his black truck. Griff realizes that that was the truck that followed Pete, and Todd remembers that Doogie and Stewy were with Smitty the night Pete was attacked. They were Pete's attackers. Stewy admits to the attack when Griff confronts Doogie in the game room. A surprised Denetra walks by the frat house while the police escort Doogie and Stewy out in handcuffs.  There is nothing left for Griff to do but move out of the fraternity house and into Pete's place. Griff is called when Pete comes out of his coma. Griff rushes to the hospital to find Pete awake with this parents at his side.  Mrs. Bradley has realized that Griff and Pete are really close and convinces Mr. Bradley to join her in the reception area for some coffee so Griff can be alone with Pete.  Mr. Bradley shakes Griff's hand and tells him that it's nice to see you again.  When he is alone with Pete Griff promises him that what happened will never happen again, and he tells Pete he needs his help in figuring things out as they make their life together.  When Pete has fully recovered he and Griff double-date with Todd and Heather at a football game. As couples they appear detached from the fraternity group that is barbecuing near the stadium. Denetra drives up with her date Loretta, whom Heather knows from her English class, and they all go to the game together. In the final scene, which follows during the course of the credits, Pete is shown reading in bed with Griff playfully joining him: Pete's dream becomes a reality.

The Designated Mourner
 The play takes place in what seems to be the present or the near future, in an unnamed Western country that is undergoing political conflict similar to what occurred in many [[Latin America]]n countries during the [[Cold War]]: a ruling [[oligarchy]] with [[fascism|fascist]] tendencies, threatened by a [[Communism|communist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement based in the [[Proletariat|lower class]], is imprisoning and executing anyone suspected of subversion, including writers and [[intellectual]]s who have no direct connection to the guerrillas.  One of the latter is Howard, a respected poet who wrote political essays in his youth; his daughter Judy and her husband Jack are also at risk of becoming suspects by association. Jack, an embittered English professor, is the play's chief narrator. He is generally uninterested in politics, but is somewhat sympathetic toward the government's murderous acts, for two reasons: he secretly resents Howard as a representative of "[[highbrow]]" culture, and he fears that his [[middle class|middle-class]] world would be wiped out if the rebels succeeded. As political repression worsens, Jack withdraws from his family and from reality. Howard is killed due to an arbitrary decision by the government, Judy is arrested and subsequently executed for unclear reasons, and Jack, after recovering from his nervous breakdown, is left as the sole survivor of Howard's literary circle.  There is no visible action in the play or the film; the three characters describe their memories in separate fragments of monologue (as in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Play (play)|Play]]''), with brief scenes of dialogue between them.  Though the play is generally more realistic than Shawn's previous politically charged work ''The Fever'', it focuses on the characters' emotional lives and leaves the civil war in the background. As a result, many reviewers of the play and film have been unclear as to whether the assassinated characters were killed by the government, for sympathizing with the rebels, or (as Jack fears) by the rebels, for being privileged academics. A close reading of the play suggests that the rebels (if they even exist) have not gained power and that what has occurred is a [[purge]] by one faction of the regime.

They escape and sabotage Suneo's rocket, cornering the group near a chasm. When they try to cross it, Nobita falls to the chasm and lands on a bush, rendered unconscious. As the monster rampages again, the rest of the group and Onigoro escape using Suneo's rocket, but realize that it cannot fly for so long as it is only a toy, thus Onigoro and his copies stray away from the rocket while holding the others as live bomb, though they manage to escape before the explosion. Meanwhile, Nobita awakes and meets with the "Seed Sower", an ancient shape-shifter being who is the true identity of the monster. He explains that he had tried multiple times to give life on planets, including Earth and Mars, eventually settling the toy planet as his choice. While at first he tries to stop humans from entering the planet (Nobita and his friends are revealed to had entered the planet accidentally), he eventually chooses to give the responsibility of it in the humans' hands, before going away. With the help of the plants, Nobita escapes from the chasm and regroups with the others.  Learning that Onigoro has taken control of the toy city, Nobita and his friends plan an attack to reclaim the city. They manage to drive Onigoro and his copies off the city, but they plan to attack them the next day. However, Nobita and his friends enlist the help of the toys, and with them they capture Onigoro and his copies and declone them to one being, who turns up to be the mole-faced Onigoro (the least hostile of them), planning to surrender to the police kindly. Nobita and his friends then give the responsibility of the planet to the living toys before heading back to Earth.

The drive generates an artificial [[black hole]] and uses it to [[Wormhole|bridge]] two points in [[spacetime]], reducing travel time over astronomical distances. The only message received from the ship after its departure was a strange recording of screams and howls. When the recording is filtered, Doctor D.J. believes he can make out the [[Latin]] phrase "''liberate me''"  ("save me") being spoken amongst the screams.  Upon boarding the ''Event Horizon'', the crew finds evidence of a massacre. As they search for survivors, the ship's gravity drive automatically activates. Justin is briefly pulled into the resulting portal. The activation also causes a shock wave that damages the ''Lewis and Clark'', forcing the entire crew to board the ''Event Horizon''. After Justin is pulled out, he is in a [[catatonia|catatonic state]], terrified by what he saw on the other side. He attempts suicide, forcing the crew to place him in [[suspended animation|stasis]].   The team begins to experience hallucinations corresponding to their fears and regrets: Miller sees Corrick, a subordinate he was forced to abandon to his death; Peters sees her son with his legs covered in bloody lesions; and Weir sees his late wife, with missing eyes, urging him to join her. The crew soon discover a video log of the ''Event Horizon''s crew going insane and mutilating each other. The video log ends with a shot of the ''Event Horizon''s captain, who has apparently gouged out his own eyes, holding them up to the camera and saying in Latin, "''liberate tutemet ex inferis''" ("save ''yourself'' from hell"). Miller and D.J. deduce that the ship's gravity drive opened a gateway into a dimension outside the [[universe|known universe]]. Starck theorizes that the ''Event Horizon'' has somehow become a [[sentience|sentient]] being that is tormenting its occupants in an attempt to kill them or lure them back through the portal.  Miller decides to destroy the ''Event Horizon''. Peters is lured to her death by a hallucination of her son. Weir, who has gouged his own eyes out and is now possessed by the evil presence, uses an explosive device to destroy the ''Lewis and Clark''. The explosion kills Smith and blasts Cooper off into space. Weir kills D.J. by [[Vivisection|vivisecting]] him and corners Starck on the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. Miller confronts Weir, who overpowers him and initiates a 10-minute countdown until the ''Event Horizon'' will return to the other dimension.  Cooper, having used his space suit's oxygen supply to propel himself back to the ship, appears at the bridge window. Weir shoots at him and is blown into space by the ensuing decompression. Miller, Starck, and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the ship's bridge. With their own ship destroyed, Miller plans to split the ''Event Horizon'' in two and use the forward section of the ship as a lifeboat. He is attacked by manifestations of Corrick and a resurrected Weir. Miller fights them off and detonates the explosives, sacrificing himself.  The gravity drive activates, pulling the ship's rear section into a black hole. Starck and Cooper enter stasis, beside a comatose Justin, and wait to be rescued. Seventy-two days later, the forward section of the ''Event Horizon'' is boarded by a rescue party, who discover the remaining crew still in stasis. A newly awakened Starck sees Weir posing as one of the rescuers, then wakes up screaming and is comforted by Cooper. As Cooper restrains the terrified Starck and as one of the rescuers calls for a sedative, the doors ominously close.

Face/Off
  [[FBI]] [[Special Agent]] Sean Archer survives an assassination attempt by freelance terrorist and homicidal sociopath Castor Troy, but the bullet penetrates Archer's chest and strikes his son Michael, killing the boy.  Six years later, Archer's vendetta against Troy culminates in his team's ambush of Troy and his younger brother/accomplice Pollux at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. Troy goads Archer with knowledge of a bomb located somewhere in the city set to go off in a few days, but he is knocked into an irreversible [[coma]] before Archer can learn more.  Archer affirms that the threat is real, but is unable to convince Pollux to reveal where the bomb is located. At the suggestion of his partner Tito Biondi and Special Ops specialist Dr. Hollis Miller, Archer secretly undergoes a highly experimental [[face transplant]] procedure by Dr. Malcolm Walsh to take on Troy's face, voice, and appearance. Archer is taken to the same high-security prison where Pollux is being held, and slowly convinces Pollux that he is Troy, gaining information on the bomb's location. Meanwhile, Troy incredibly awakens from his coma and discovers his face missing. He calls his gang, and they force Dr. Walsh to transplant Archer's face onto him.  Troy visits the prison and surprises Archer. He taunts his nemesis, telling him that he burned down Dr. Walsh's lab with Walsh, Biondi, and Miller inside to eliminate all the evidence of their transplant, and will take over Archer's life. He leaves Archer to languish while he convinces Pollux to "reveal" the bomb's location in exchange for release from prison. Disarming his bomb in a dramatic fashion, Troy-as-Archer gains respect from Archer's fellow FBI colleagues. Troy becomes close to Archer's family, who Archer had neglected since he began seeking revenge against Troy, romancing his wife Eve and rescuing his daughter Jamie from an abusive boyfriend.  Archer escapes after staging a riot and retreats to Troy's headquarters. There, Archer meets Sasha, the sister of Troy's primary drug kingpin, and her son Adam, who reminds Archer of Michael. Archer learns that Adam is Troy's son, who he once had planned to put in foster care. Troy learns of Archer's escape and hastily assembles a team to raid his headquarters. The raid quickly turns into a bloodbath, killing numerous FBI agents and several members of Troy's gang, including Pollux; Archer, Sasha, and Adam are able to escape. Archer's supervisor, Director Victor Lazarro blames Troy for the numerous slayings. Troy, furious over Pollux's death, kills Lazarro, and makes it look like a heart attack. Troy-as-Archer is promoted to acting director as plans are made for Lazarro's funeral.  Archer finds safety for Sasha and Adam and approaches Eve. He persuades her to take a sample of Troy's blood and his own to compare their blood types at the hospital where she works as a doctor to prove he is Archer. Convinced of her husband's identity, she tells him that Troy will be vulnerable at Lazarro's funeral. At the ceremony, Archer finds that Troy has anticipated his actions and takes Eve hostage. Sasha arrives, and a gunfight ensues; Sasha manages to save Eve after taking a bullet. Archer promises to a dying Sasha to take care of Adam and raise him away from criminal life.  Troy flees the church with Archer pursuing him. After killing two more federal agents, Troy briefly takes Jamie hostage, but she escapes by stabbing him with a butterfly knife that Troy had given her for self-defense. A speedboat chase ensues wherein Archer forces Troy to shore by collision, then bests Troy in a melee fight. Troy mutilates his/Archer's face to taunt him, but Archer shoots Troy with a spear gun, presumably killing him. Backup agents arrive and address Archer by name, having been convinced by Eve of Archer's true identity. After the face transplant surgery is undone, Archer returns home, adopting Adam into his family and keeping his promise to Sasha.  
FairyTale: A True Story
 Early 20th-century Europe was a time and a place rife with conflicting forces, from the battlefields of [[World War I]] to the peaceful countryside of rural England. Scientific advances such as [[electric light]] and photography appeared magical to some; [[spiritualism]] was championed by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] while his friend [[Harry Houdini]] decried false mediums who prey upon grieving families. [[J.M. Barrie]]'s [[Peter Pan]] charmed theatergoers of all ages. Young Frances Griffiths, whose father is [[missing in action]], arrives by train to stay with her cousin Elsie Wright in rural [[Yorkshire]].  Polly Wright, Elsie's mother, is deep in mourning for her son Joseph, a gifted artist who died at the age of ten, and she keeps Joseph's room and art works intact. Elsie is not allowed to wear colours or to play with his toys, but she has taken the unfinished fairy-house he built up to her garret bedroom where her doting father, Arthur, regales her with [[fairy tales]]. He is a bit of a local [[wunderkind]], responsible for the electrification of the local mill, where children as young as Elsie go to work. He is also an amateur photographer and chess player. When Frances arrives she and Elsie discover a shared fascination with fairies, whom they encounter down at the "beck", a nearby brook. They abscond with Arthur's camera one afternoon to take pictures of the fairies, hoping to give Polly something to believe in. When she comes home after attending a meeting of the [[Theosophical Society]], where she hears stories of angels and all sorts of ethereal beings, she finds Arthur reviewing the prints in disbelief, but she thinks they are real. She takes them to Theosophist lecturer E.L. Gardner, who has them analysed by a professional and then brings them to the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The photos are pronounced genuine, or at least devoid of trickery.  No one except Houdini believes that young children could be capable of photographic fraud, and Conan Doyle himself arrives at the girls' home with Houdini, Gardner and two new cameras. Arthur catches Houdini poking around and tells him point-blank that he doesn't believe that the fairies are real, but that no trickery took place in his [[darkroom]] either. Abetted by the buffoonish Gardner, Elsie and Frances soon come up with two more photos and Conan Doyle has the story published in ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'', promising everyone's names will be changed. But a newsman soon identifies the beck near [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]], tracing the girls through the local school and besieging the family. Hundreds of people invade the village in automobiles and on foot, and the fairies flee the obstreperous mobs. By way of apology to the fairies, the girls finish Joseph's fairy-house and leave it in the forest as a gift.  The girls are invited to London by Conan Doyle, where they embrace their celebrity and see Houdini perform. In a quiet moment backstage Houdini asks Elsie if she wants to know how he does his tricks, and she wisely declines. And when a reporter asks, he declaims, "Masters of illusion never reveal their secrets!" Back in Yorkshire, while the girls and Polly are away, Arthur has a chess match with a local champion reputed to be mute, and the newsman breaks into their house. He discovers a cache of paper dolls in the form of fairies in a portfolio in Joseph's room, but he is frightened away by the apparition of a young boy, leaving the evidence behind. Arthur wins his match, wringing a shout from his opponent, and another myth is debunked. After the children return home, the fairies reappear, and finally, Frances' father comes home as well.

But Rod informs her that he has already sold the company where she was to work. Willa then agrees to run another recent acquisition, Marwood Zoo, in an attempt to create a business model that can be used for multiple zoos in the future. Rod McCain's son Vincent, who feels an unreciprocated attraction to Willa, announces that he will join her at the zoo.  The newly appointed director of the zoo is a retired [[Hong Kong Police Force]] officer and former Octopus Television employee, Rollo Lee. In order to meet Octopus's revenue target of 20% from all assets, Rollo institutes a "fierce creatures" theme on the assumption that dangerous and violent animals will attract more visitors. All animals not meeting those requirements must go. All the animal keepers, including spider-handler Bugsy, make various attempts to get Rollo to change his mind. One such attempt involves getting Rollo to kill some of the cutest animals himself, but Rollo, seeing through their prank, fakes the animals' extermination. Rollo keeps the animals in his bedroom which later causes Willa and Vincent to misunderstand that Rollo is having an orgy with the female staff.  Rollo discovers that several staff members are faking animal attack injuries. Rollo fires several warning shots at those responsible and Reggie rushes in, thinking mistakenly that one of them is shot. Rollo then finds a visitor who has had a genuine accident but, not believing it is real, tastes the blood of the visitor whilst loudly proclaiming that it is fake. Just then Willa and Vincent arrive and this fiasco sees Rollo demoted to middle management. Vince even threatens to fire him if his apparent activities with the female staff do not cease.  Vince covers both the zoo and animals alike with advertisements after secretly garnering sponsors, dresses the staff in ridiculous outfits, and installs an artificial panda in one of the enclosures. His continued attempts to seduce Willa fail, while she comes to enjoy working at the zoo after having a close encounter with a silverback gorilla. She finds herself attracted to Rollo after becoming fascinated by his apparent ability to attract multiple women. When Rollo attempts to have a discussion about Vince's marketing plan, she suggests they have dinner, but she is forced to postpone when she remembers Rod is coming from Atlanta to discuss the running of the zoo.  Worried that the visit might be part of a plan to close the zoo, Rollo and the zookeepers bug Rod's hotel room to find out. Although the plan goes awry, they learn that Rod wants to turn the zoo into a golf course and is not actually expecting to die soon.  Upon discovering that Vince has stolen sponsorship money he raised, Willa warns him to return it, or else she will tell Rod. When Rollo attempts to work out how the theft can be traced, he and Willa finally kiss, just as Vince arrives to return the money. A confrontation takes place first at the zoo office, and then outside as Willa, Rollo, Bugsy, and several others attempt to stop Vince from running off with the money. Bugsy refuses to shut up, so Vince loses his temper and grabs a pistol from the management office. Rod arrives just as Vince is being subdued and announces the police are on their way to arrest Vince for stealing. Vince tries and fails to shoot his father, but then Bugsy takes the pistol and accidentally shoots Rod between the eyes.  In the panic that follows, a plan emerges to fool Neville and the arriving police. The keepers work together to dress Vince up as Rod, since he can imitate his father's accent fairly well. When the police and Neville arrive, Vince (as Rod) tells them that he has rewritten Rod's will, specifying that the zoo will become a trust of the caretakers while Vince will inherit everything else, and he wants all of them to be witnesses. After signing the new will, Vince locks himself in a caretaker hut where he feigns Rod's suicide. Although Neville becomes suspicious, he is left dumbstruck when he discovers the dead body of his boss in the hut.  Now free, the zookeepers destroy the evidence of McCain's ownership. Vince becomes the new CEO of Octopus, while Willa and Rollo happily begin a new life together while continuing to run the zoo.

At the same time Harry Haber (Leslie Nielsen), after a misunderstanding about a scheduling conflict, takes the children up from Mid Valley Children House to the now adult health resort. Two brothers from there, Alec and Eli Mackenzie, recently lost their dad in a car accident and are trying to find their biological mother. According to their case, their mother lives in Phoenix, Arizona, which Camp Sedona is located near to. The two brothers decided to run away while at the camp to find their mother. But right before all the children go to camp, Alec (Trevor Morgan) is busted for some tricks by the children house principal (Tony Rosato) and grounded – he isn't going to camp.  Eli (Zachary Browne) helps Alec to get to the camp inside of big bag with clothes; now he is secretly there without permission. But he can still have fun with the adult investors.  Various shenanigans are had by the kids and other members of the camp much to the frustration of Jeffrey, whose investors are not fond of kids (one time going so far as to hide insects in guests' food). Another incident involves the filming of a sleeping woman through her bedroom window. After being caught they flee and while hiding, record a conversation between Jeffery and an investor.  Alec is caught after climbing a dangerous cliff to retrieve RC plane causing other kids to go get the adults.  Before movie night Jeffery shows Julie his "sensitive side" in a desperate ploy to get her to sell the camp. Unfortunately for him, Harry had come across the recording the boys made earlier and puts it in the TV for everyone to watch. The woman who was filmed sleeping storms off and Jeffery pauses the movie several times but each time Harry resumes it ensuring they get to the part of Jeffery's conversation. This causes Julie to declare the camp not for sale, dump Jeffery, and then punch him.  The boys leave in the middle of the movie and stow away in a catering service's van heading to Phoenix. Julie and Matt (Eddie Bowz), who is working in camp and is Julie's child friend go after them by car but don't beat them to the catering company's building. While Julie and Matt look for the brothers in the van, they get in Julie's car to look at a map during which they answer a phone call from Harry who they somewhat nonsensically tell, "Sorry, wrong number." Slightly puzzled Harry tells the principle there is no answer.  Julie and Matt get back into the car while unbeknownst to them the brothers hide in the back. The principle tells Julie and Matt on the phone to head to the address of the kids' mom and Harry somewhat cryptically adds they shouldn't "Say anything they wouldn't normally say in the presence of uh small people." Harry assures the principle that Eli and Alec are in good hands.  Julie and Matt head to the address and the brothers jump out of the car and run to the door. Unfortunately there are new owners at the address who don't know the previous owners.  Finally, Matt decides to adopt Eli and Alec, whom he had grown very fond of, only to find out Julie also wanted to adopt them and seeing Matt want kids, realizes he is ready for commitment.  
The Fearless Four (film)
 The film starts by introducing each of the four main characters.  Buster, a bloodhound, doesn't want to hunt; he wants to sing.  This gets him in trouble with his master, and he ends up running away.  Next we meet Fred, a donkey whose master has chosen to replace him with a robot.  Fred runs away from home as well.  The third character we meet is Gwendolyn, a graceful [[Siamese cat]].  (Oddly for a Siamese, she does not have blue eyes.)  Her beloved owner, Aunt Wanda, has died.  Aunt Wanda left behind two valuable jewels, but her heirs can't find them.  They decide that the cat is hiding them, and try to kill her.  She escapes, taking with her a lute which she has learned to play.  Buster and Fred each like to sing, and they decide to travel to a big city in order to see if they can become famous singers.  They plan to go to [[Paris]], but because a road sign is pointing the wrong way, they end up heading toward [[Bremen]] instead.  Along the way they meet Gwendolyn, who is playing her lute and singing about how lonely she is.  They invite her to join them on their journey, and she accepts.  Lastly, the group meets Tortellini, a rooster who has just been thrown out of his home.  He too is a singer, so he joins the others.  The four animals find Bremen to be a sad place; a large corporation called Mix Max, headed by the subtly-named Dr. Greed, essentially rules the city.  There are NO SINGING signs posted all about, but the animals ignore them and begin singing for passersby on a street corner.  A Mix Max official named Platini rides by; he overhears the singing animals and stops, intending to punish them, but when he hears how talented they are, he decides instead to put them to work for the company.  He offers them a contract to sing a radio jingle for Mix Max.  Tortellini announces that he is the group's leader (to the annoyance of the others), and he insists upon signing the contract immediately, without reading it.  The singing animals are now known as The Fearless Four.  For a short time after this, things go well for The Fearless Four.  They are shown singing the jingle in a recording studio and quickly becoming famous.  Mix Max's main products are sausages, and sales of the sausages skyrocket due to the popularity of The Fearless Four.  But soon the animals grow tired of singing the same silly jingle over and over.  They approach Platini, asking to perform their own songs.  He refuses; he orders them to stick to their contract.  When Gwendolyn asks how long it will be before the contract expires, Platini reveals that it is perpetual.  The animals realize that Mix Max essentially owns them and their voices.  Angered by this, the next time they sing the Mix Max song, they use their own lyrics, mocking the company.  For this they are all thrown into a dungeon.  A friendly mouse called Mozart helps them escape.  Once free, they discover that Mix Max is bringing in all sorts of animals in order to make more sausages, including cats and dogs.  Horrified, the four animals decide they must find a way to stop this.  They return to the Mix Max headquarters, apologize for escaping and ask Platini if they can have their jobs back.  He agrees because sausage sales have dropped while the animals were away.  Also, Dr. Greed is now running for President, and he feels that the singing animals might help his campaign.  It's arranged for The Fearless Four to perform songs favoring his campaign at a live concert.  In order to prevent the animals from using that opportunity to sabotage him, Dr. Greed has his pet snake watching over The Fearless Four.  But the mouse Mozart saves the day again, showing up with a snake-charming flute.  He puts the snake to sleep, so when the concert starts, The Fearless Four are free to say whatever they like.  They reveal to the audience that the Mix Max corporation has been lying about its activities, and a riot ensues.  The Mix Max officials retreat to their factory, but the four animals follow them, attack them and defeat them.  Lastly, they free the animals which had been destined to become sausages.  The film ends with the four animals returning to the countryside.  Gwendolyn purchases her old home and turns it into a refuge for the animals freed from the sausage factory; she also finds Aunt Wanda's jewels, hidden in the woman's portrait.  The animals then have a party to celebrate their freedom.  This story is loosely adapted from the [[Folklore|folk tale]] of the [[Town Musicians of Bremen]].  
Fire Down Below (1997 film)
 In the peaceful [[Appalachia]]n hills of eastern [[Kentucky]], toxins are being dumped into abandoned mines, causing environmental havoc, but the locals, mindful of their jobs and the power of the mine owners, can do nothing. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] [[Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance|CID]] agent Jack Taggart is sent to investigate, after a fellow agent is found dead, probably not by accident. The EPA has received an anonymous letter from [[Jackson, Kentucky]], and Taggart goes there undercover to continue his colleague's investigations.  It is discovered that Hanner Coal Company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr., is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft, so Jack is assigned to go to the small town of Jackson, where his cover is that of assistant and volunteer carpenter to a local church. He stays in a room in the church's basement, and begins his cover work by repairing the roof at a house where one of the children is sick because of the pollution. He attempts to question the family, but they do not have much to say. He has little better results elsewhere; even the man who tipped off the EPA is decidedly taciturn. While testing the water, Taggart wanders into a local marijuana field, and is accosted by the growers. After disarming them, he tells them that he has no interest in arresting them.  The men responsible for the other agent's death soon notice Taggart's presence. As a newcomer to the small local community, he is threatened by Hanner's son Orin, Jr. ([[Brad Hunt]]), the incompetent local tool of the company, the corrupt local Sheriff Lloyd Foley, and several thugs that work for them. The thugs in question start by leaving two rattlesnakes in his dwelling; Taggart responds by capturing the snakes alive and leaving them in the pickup that the thugs were driving, causing them to crash. Soon after, five of them attack him while he is buying supplies, and receive a severe beating as a result. Orin then orders one of his truck drivers to arrange an "accident" by running him off the road, but Taggart escapes alive while the driver is killed.  While these conflicts are occurring, Taggart strikes up a relationship with Sarah Kellogg, a young woman who lives in the town. She is regarded as an outcast because of her father's murder, a crime of which she was accused but not convicted. Eventually, she agrees to testify against Orin and his people, much to the anger of her brother Earl, who actually committed the crime, after their father found out about his sexual abuse against her. He sets the church on fire, killing the preacher who was helping Taggart in the process, and then attempts to collapse the mine with Taggart inside it. Taggart escapes, but several mercenaries are killed, including Earl.  With evidence and a witness, Taggart calls the [[FBI]] to take Sarah into protective custody. However, they are revealed to be corrupt, and a firefight ensues. Taggart kills one agent, then sends the second back to Orin with a message that he'll be coming for him next. However, when Orin is arrested and charged, he gets off with a slap on the wrist for the environmental violations. Taggart goes back into the town and fights his way past the last of Orin, Jr's thugs, then demands the truth from him. Orin agrees to turn state's evidence, implicating his father on [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], conspiracy, and murder charges. Taggart goes to a casino to arrest Orin, Sr. Upon hearing about the reception awaiting him in federal prison, Orin produces a gun and resists, but Taggart shoots him in the shoulder and he is taken into custody. Taggart then returns to Jackson, where he is reunited with Sarah.  
The Fifth Element
  In 1914, aliens known as Mondoshawans arrive at an [[ancient Egypt]]ian temple to collect, for safekeeping from [[World War I]], the only weapon capable of defeating a great evil that appears every 5,000&nbsp;years. The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four [[classical element]]s, and a [[sarcophagus]] containing a fifth element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.  In 2263, the great evil appears in deep space in the form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the President of the Federated Territories about the history of the great evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who has been directed by the great evil (sending messages as “Mister Shadow”) to acquire the element stones.  The Mondoshawans' spacecraft is destroyed, and the only "survivor" is a severed hand in a metal glove from the Fifth Element's sarcophagus that still contains some living cells. Scientists take it to a New York City laboratory and use it to reconstruct a powerful humanoid woman who takes the name Leeloo. Terrified of the unfamiliar surroundings, she breaks out of confinement and jumps off a high ledge, crashing into the [[Flying car (aircraft)|flying taxicab]] of Korben Dallas, a former major in the [[special forces]].  Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, whereupon it is revealed that she is the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, as they entrusted the stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna, an opera singer. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain the stones, but their surviving compatriots determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro, Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury cruise; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple designed to house the stones, then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the cruise liner.  Plavalaguna is killed when the Mangalores attack the cruise ship, but Dallas succeeds in retrieving the stones from the Diva. During his struggle with the Mangalores he kills their leader, rendering the remaining Mangalores unwilling to continue fighting. Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting and seriously wounding Leeloo before taking a carrying case that he presumes contains the stones back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a [[time bomb]] that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to be empty, Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the ship and killing Zorg. Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod escape with the stones aboard Zorg's spacecraft.  The four join up with David at the weapon chamber in the temple as the great evil approaches. They arrange the stones and activate them with their corresponding elements, but having witnessed and studied so much violence, Leeloo has become disenchanted with humanity and refuses to cooperate. Dallas confesses his love for Leeloo and kisses her. In response, Leeloo combines the power of the stones and releases the divine light onto the great evil, stopping it and destroying its power, causing it to be proclaimed dead by Earth scientists.

Firelight
 In 1837, Swiss [[governess]] Elisabeth Laurier ([[Sophie Marceau]]) agrees to bear a child for an anonymous English landowner in return for money needed to pay her father's debts. They meet over three nights at a lonely island hotel. Despite their wish for detachment, they develop a deeply passionate connection during their lovemaking by firelight. Their feelings grow after they converse on the beach and at the hotel. Nine months later (10th of August 1838), Elisabeth gives birth to a girl, and as agreed, she gives up the child to the care of the English landowner. Over the coming years, Elisabeth never forgets her child. She begins to keep a [[diary|journal]] of watercoloured flowers and plants, adding a page for each holiday and birthday they are apart.  The anonymous Englishman is Charles Godwin ([[Stephen Dillane]]), a landowner and struggling sheep farmer, who can barely keep the debtors of his philandering father, Lord Clare, at bay. Charles's wife, Amy Godwin, is paralysed and [[catatonic]] due to a horseriding accident. Amy's sister, Constance ([[Lia Williams]]), runs the Godwin household.  Seven years after giving up her daughter, Elisabeth manages to locate her, and she gets herself hired as the new governess for the child, who is named Louisa. Initially, Charles rejects Elisabeth, and demands that she leave immediately. However, Constance insists that he should give the new governess a month to find a new situation. Showing Elisabeth the catatonic form of his wife, Charles forces Elisabeth to swear never to reveal to Louisa or anyone the nature of their previous relationship.  Louisa (Dominique Belcourt) is a spoiled, ignorant, wilful, and foulmouthed child—unloved by anyone except her father. Though she acknowledges the father's loving relationship with his daughter, Elisabeth is appalled by the lack of control Charles exercises over the girl. He refuses to use any forms of discipline in her upbringing. Unable to keep Louisa at her lessons, Elisabeth locks the child in the classroom. When he discovers this, Charles is furious and roughly manhandles Elisabeth in an effort to extract the key to the schoolroom. While Charles wants his daughter to enjoy life as much as she can, Elisabeth is determined to teach her daughter how to behave to be loved by others, and to be educated so she can determine her own path in the world. To convince Charles to support her approach, Elisabeth promises she will never harm the girl, and whatever she does to Louisa she will also do to herself.  Outside of class, Louisa spends all of her spare time in her lakehouse, a small [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] on the estate in the middle of a pond, which can only be reached by boat. Here, Louisa pretends she has a mother. At first, Elisabeth watches clandestinely from the boat docks while Louisa is in the lakehouse. However, when she finds out that Charles swims naked there in the morning, she begins to go to watch Charles too, leaving before he can see her. In the classroom, Elisabeth paints picture cards to teach the seven-year-old how to read. She also tells Louisa a tale about the firelight:   Elisabeth finds that this helps Louisa concentrate on her lessons, knowing there is a time at the end of the day when there are no rules.  Increasingly attracted to Elisabeth, Charles asks her to promise him that they can never be close like they once were. But Elisabeth doesn't answer. Charles even talks about the three of them leaving together, but Elisabeth says she knows it is impossible, as he has obligations to his estate, family, and wife. Charles suddenly announces that the entire estate is being appraised for sale, purportedly to cover his overwhelming debts. On a bitterly cold night, Charles consults his conscience as to whether his wife, Amy, would want him to release her from her catatonic prison of ten years. He opens the windows of her bedchamber, removes her covers, and allows the fire in her room to go out, leaving her to die of [[Hypothermia|exposure]]. With Amy's death, her sister Constance expects to be Charles's choice as a new wife. However, she concedes a dignified defeat when she realises Charles's depth of feeling toward Elisabeth. Elisabeth confronts Charles and asks him if he killed Amy, which he admits. They both feel strong guilt, but no regret.  Soon after, Louisa looks through Elisabeth's room and discovers the illustrated journal dedicated to "My English Daughter". Louisa confronts her governess who confirms she is in fact her mother. After the sale of the Godwin's estate, Charles, Elisabeth, and Louisa leave on a snowy day to begin their new lives together as a family.

Flubber (film)
 Professor Philip Brainard ([[Robin Williams]]), of [[Medfield College]], is developing a new energy source in an attempt to raise enough money to save the college from closure. His preoccupancy with his research distracts him from his fiancée and the college president Sara Jean Reynolds ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]); he has missed two weddings in the past as a result of this, much to the anger of Sara. On the day of the third attempted wedding, Philip is approached by his former partner Wilson Croft ([[Christopher McDonald]]), who has profited from ideas he has stolen from the chemist and now desires to steal Sara from Philip and make her his wife, which he declares directly to Philip, though Philip takes it as a joke. Before he can make it to the wedding, his latest experiment shows fast development, forcing him to miss another wedding. The resulting substance created from the experiment is a living green goo that increases in speed as it bounces and proves to be difficult to control, wreaking havoc on the neighborhood before the professor finally manages to capture it. Weebo (voiced by [[Jodi Benson]]), Philip's hovering robot assistant, classifies the substance as "flying rubber", leading Philip to christen it as "Flubber".  Philip continues to work on Flubber into the early morning, looking to stabilize the Flubber's movement as opposed to stimulation. Philip's watch alarm goes off at 6 a.m. (set wrong) and Weebo informs him that he has missed the third wedding. Philip goes to Sara's office and unsuccessfully attempts to explain the situation to her. Meanwhile, Medfield College sponsor Chester Hoenicker ([[Raymond J. Barry]]) is unhappy that Philip failed his son Bennett ([[Wil Wheaton]]) in chemistry class. That night, Hoenicker sends his two security guards Smith ([[Clancy Brown]]) and Wesson ([[Ted Levine]]) to Philip's house in an attempt to persuade Philip into giving Bennett a better grade. However, Philip is too busy testing the Flubber to even notice them and suddenly knocks them out unconscious with a Flubber-coated golf ball and bowling ball. He uses Flubber to give his vintage [[Ford Thunderbird]] flight. During a test run, he discovers Wilson making the moves on Sara (making a bet that she'll buy him dinner if Medfield wins, or join him for a weekend in the mountains if they lose). Afterward, Weebo attempts to confess her love of Philip, only to be shrugged off as a computer. In response, she secretly creates a holographic human version of herself named Sylvia ([[Leslie Stefanson]]) in hopes of winning him over. Before Weebo can make out with Philip in this form as he sleeps, Philip awakens with another idea for Flubber. He enters an empty basketball arena and tests the effects of Flubber on a basketball. Later, he gives Flubber-padded shoes to the unskilled Medfield basketball team to increase their abilities.  Back in Philip's home, looking to have some fun, Weebo unleashes Flubber from his case, allowing him to dance around the house and cause general mayhem. After the close but successful basketball game, Philip's attempt to win Sara back into his favor fails. Upon returning home, Philip dumps all of his [[emotional baggage]] onto Weebo, saying his absent-mindedness is due to his love of Sara. Weebo records Philip's ramblings and shows the footage to Sara, who then reconciles with Philip. Philip demonstrates Flubber's abilities to Sara and they discuss how it can be used for profit. However, Hoenicker discovers Flubber's existence and, after failing to convince Philip and Sara to sell it to him, sends Smith and Wesson to infiltrate Philip's house and steal Flubber. Weebo attempts to fend off the henchmen, only to be struck down by Wesson with a baseball bat. Philip and Sara return home and find Weber (Philip's house-robot) cleaning up, Flubber gone, and Weebo destroyed. Later, Philip discovers that Weebo had downloaded backup data of herself onto his computer in the event of her destruction, as well as a video recording of Weebo's hologram professing her love for him.  Philip and Sara confront Hoenicker and try to save Flubber, under the guise of accepting Hoenicker's offer. While there, they discover that Wilson is allied with the millionaire. Philip and Sara then reveal their ruse and unleash Flubber, starting a battle between them and the villains. In the end, Philip and Sara defeat Wilson, Bennett, Hoenicker and his henchmen, get  Flubber back, raise enough money to save the college and finally have a successful wedding, along with Flubber and the "daughter" of Weebo, called Weebette. The film ends with the family heading to Hawaii in the Thunderbird.

Four Days in September
 The film is a fictional version of the dramatic events of the 1969 [[kidnap|abduction]] of the [[United States|American]] ambassador [[Charles Burke Elbrick]] (played by [[Alan Arkin]]) in 1969. Elbrick was taken in Rio de Janeiro by the [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]] (MR-8) with help of [[Ação Libertadora Nacional]] (ALN).  Gabeira (played by [[Pedro Cardoso (Brazilian actor)|Pedro Cardoso]] and named Paulo in the film) as a student joins the radical movement after the military takeover of the Brazilian government. He and his comrades, led by Andréia, gradually decided to kidnap the ambassador as a protest, and are shown mostly planning and executing the kidnapping. Paulo is portrayed as "the most intelligent and uncertain of the kidnappers."<ref name="ebert"/>  The film explores Paulo's love affair with Andréia, the guerrilla leader. It suggests a kind of friendship developing between Paulo and Elbrick. The ambassador is portrayed as a decent man who shares some of his kidnappers' frustrations regarding the Brazilian military dictatorship, but who feels obligated to follow orders he might disagree with.   
For Richer or Poorer
 After ten years of [[marriage]], [[New York City]] [[millionaire]] [[socialite]] couple Brad (Allen) and Caroline Sexton (Alley) are miserable and have decided to call it quits. Their marital problems come to a head earlier that evening when Brad turns their 10th anniversary party into a real estate development pitch for a theme park he calls "The Holy Land", modeled after [[Christian mythology|Biblical lore]]. The pitch turns disastrous when one of the display's special effects catches a guest's (who happens to be a federal judge) dress on fire.  At the same time, Brad's [[accountant]], Bob Lachman ([[Wayne Knight]]), is stealing the Sextons' millions through mismanagement and filing false tax returns. His money manipulation has caught the attention of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), and field agent Frank Hall ([[Miguel A. Nunez]]), demands to meet Bob and Brad the following morning to bring the obligations up to date and settle the missing $5,000,000.  Bob arrives at the office early the following morning with a file box (likely the incriminating paperwork that could land him in jail), but leaves before Brad arrives. Though he doesn't get out in time, he manages to finally evade Brad and Hall, who has just shown up.  Hearing a hint from Bob that the Sextons could be fleeing (Brad told him about the Sextons' impending divorce), Hall orders the freezing of all their assets. Brad is unable to access his money through an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and Caroline has her credit card destroyed at her table as she's having lunch with some friends. Brad is then informed that his accounts have been frozen, but the bank teller refuses to tell him why. At first he thinks Caroline is responsible, until he gets Bob on the phone, who tells him that he himself is the cause of their newfound problems as he's headed for the airport.  Gung-ho [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Inspector Derek Lester ([[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]]) joins Hall to serve the warrant and bring in the Sextons. As Brad exits the bank (trying to chase down his [[Jaguar XK8]] being towed), Hall and Lester surround him at a [[Charging Bull|bull statue]] on Wall Street. Brad takes out his new satellite phone to answer a call, but the trigger-happy Lester mistakes it for a gun and pulls out his own pistol, shooting it out of Brad's hand, much to Hall's chagrin.  Brad flees on foot, steals a cab and happens to pick up Caroline. The Sextons get away from Hall and Lester and the NYPD (who apprehend the agents for reckless pursuit) and leave New York. They crash the cab into a muddy swamp and are forced to spend that night sleeping rough, covered in mud. The next day, they find themselves in [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania]], a small [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]-area community of Old Order [[Amish]]. Brad drops in on a conversation and after stealing some clothes, they masquerade as Jacob and Emma Yoder, a family's (also named Yoder) expected cousins from Missouri. Samuel and Levinia ([[Jay O. Sanders]] and [[Megan Cavanagh]]), along with their sons and daughters, make the pair at home.  The pair try to fit in, and while Brad manages to adjust well, the glamorous and spoiled [[prima donna]] Caroline, deprived of her cigarettes, fine clothes, makeup and other creature comforts, throws various childlike tantrums when she and Brad are alone. This gets noticed by Levinia and Samuel, who chalk it up to the pair having marital difficulties. Brad decides to try and relate better to Caroline after a talk from Samuel about how each day, no matter how bleak, is a gift of life from God. Gradually, both learn to fit in through their own abilities. Brad with his knowledge of real estate values, helps Samuel's future son-in-law Henner buy a plot of land, and Caroline's knowledge of fashion helps their conservative [[ordnung]] relax their colorless dress code.  The Sextons then rediscover why they fell in love in the first place, largely through their efforts of helping others rather than themselves. As Samuel and Levinia's daughter Rebecca is exchanging vows with Henner, the ceremony is interrupted by police and a drenched Hall and Lester, who crashed into the stolen cab. The Sextons are exposed and hauled back to New York to face trial. Brad's attorney Phil Kleinmann ([[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]]) informs them that he found Bob in [[Zurich]] and had him [[Extradition|extradited]] back to America. A resisting Bob is then hauled into the courtroom by uniformed officers to face the Sextons. Bob confesses and Brad thanks the accountant for saving his and Caroline's marriage. Charges against the Sextons are dropped.  Brad and Caroline return to the Yoders to make things right, but their pleas for forgiveness seem to fall on deaf ears. As they turn to leave, Samuel informs them that he and Levinia knew the whole time of the ruse. They said they put up with it because it was planting season and they needed the extra help. Brad offers to give his watch as a present only to be told that their Amish cannot accept gifts only trades. He then proceeds to trade the watch for Big John, a gargantuan Belgian horse that Brad (as Jacob) tamed largely by dumb luck, and some corn. Brad also tells Sam not to "open the back of the watch;" the watch seems to have in it a risque [[picture]] which amuses him. The movie ends with Brad and Caroline driving a 1954 [[Ford]] pickup with a horse trailer hauling Big John. It is then revealed that the Sextons traded their 1997 Jaguar for the truck. In the closing credits, Brad contemplates buying the pond, where they crashed the cab and Caroline reveals she is pregnant with the couple's first child.  
Free Willy 3: The Rescue
 Jesse is sixteen years old and works as an [[Killer whale|orca]]-researcher on a research ship called the ''Noah'' alongside his old friend Randolph and moved away from Glen and Annie who were promised by Randolph to keep Jesse out of trouble.  They suspect that Willy and his pod are being illegally hunted by whalers posing as commercial fishermen. Aboard just such a ship, the Botany Bay, Max Wesley, who is ten years old, takes his first trip to sea with his father, John, a [[whaler]] from a long line of whalers, and learns the true unlawful nature of the family business. During his first hunt, Max is thrown overboard and comes face to face with Willy. From this point on, Max is working against his own father, teaming with Jesse and Randolph to save Willy from becoming $200-per-pound [[sushi]]. Jesse introduces Max to Willy properly after learning of Max's experience and how Max likes whales. Jesse goes to his and Randolph's head boss about the threat to the whales, but he refuses to take action until Jesse manages to get proof with help from Max.  Jesse manages to sneak on board the ''Botany Bay'' to steal a sample of the spear guns that are used to shoot the whales, and discovers that the whalers are heading back out to go after Willy and his pod, using an audio recording of a song which Jesse plays on his harmonica as a lure for Willy, who won't realize that it's not Jesse until it's too late. Jesse's boss plans to call for help the next day, but knowing it will be too late then, Jesse, Randolph and one of their fellow researchers, Drew, steal the ''Noah'' research boat from her mooring and go after the whalers themselves. Max manages to buy them a little time by jumping into the water and forcing the whalers to pause their pursuit of the whales to perform a "man overboard" rescue for Max, which gives Jesse and his two companions enough time to catch up. John is angry because he learns that his son isn't on his side and believes that Max tried to sabotage the engine (Jesse had actually been the one who did this), but it doesn't stop him.  Jesse, Randolph and Drew use a flare gun and their boat's P.A. system to try to bluff the whalers into stopping, but when it doesn't work, Jesse rams the ''Botany Bay'' with the ''Noah'' just as they fire a harpoon, the jolt causing the harpoon to miss Willy and knocking John into the water. Willy tries to kill him, biting at him, but Jesse and Max manage to convince Willy to spare him. Max's father then gets trapped under a net and nearly drowns as the net drags him down, and ultimately comes face to face with Willy himself. This time, Willy, instead of killing him, saves him by pushing him to the surface and holding him there long enough for Jesse and Randolph to rescue him. The Marine Patrol arrive, having been summoned on the radio by Jesse before he rammed the ''Botany Bay'', and catch the whalers (who are stunned by Willy rescuing their boss) in the act and arrest them. Being saved by Willy causes John to realize that he was wrong about the whales, and he apologizes to Max. John is not sure where to go from here as his whole life has been about whaling, but Max tells him he is his father and forgives him.  Later, Jesse, Randolph, Drew and Max witness the birth of Willy's son (the mother is an orca named "Nikki") and Jesse decides to name him Max when given the choice. The film ends with the two whales, their calf, and the rest of the pod swimming away out to the open sea.  
For Ever Mozart
 The film is divided into four parts, which Godard has subsequently given by name.   === Theater === In the first part, Vicky Vitalis, an elderly film director, is casting a new project called "Fatal Bolero," assisted by his nephew, Jérôme. A group of actors lines up to audition, but Vicky is dissatisfied with each of their line readings. The director nevertheless manages to secure funding from a man called Baron Felix, who himself secures one of the actresses named Sabine, to the chagrin of Sabine's plaintive boyfriend. Later, Jérôme accompanies Vicky's daughter, Camille, a professor of philosophy, as she searches for a copy of ''[[The Game of Love and Chance]]'', the play by [[Pierre de Marivaux]]. Her intention is to stage the play in [[Bosnian War|war torn Sarajevo]]. However, unable to find a copy, she settles instead on the [[Alfred de Musset]] play ''One Must Not Trifle with Love'', happily noting that she shares the same name as the play's heroine.  Jérôme, smitten with his cousin, decides to go to Sarajevo with her, to his mother Sylvie's dismay. Sylvie persuades her brother Vicky to accompany them, and the family's maid, Jamila, also decides to go. Camille and Jérôme decide to cast Jamila in the play as the character Rosette.  === One Must Not Trifle with Love in Sarajevo === In the second part, the four take a train to [[Bosnia]] and rough it in the wild. Increasingly unable to share in his young charges' idealism, Vicky abandons them, filling the role of a West European who turns his back on the horrors of the Bosnian war. The spectre of tanks begins to appear in the forest, and not long after, Camille, Jérôme, and Jamila are captured by Serbian paramilitaries and taken to a derelict mansion the paramilitaries are using as a base. There, Camille and Jérôme metaphorically dig their own graves when they correct a Serbian commander on his account of [[Georges Danton]]'s participation in the [[French Revolution]]. After being anally violated, they are forced to literally dig their own graves, and are killed in an ensuing attack on the base. Jamila, a soldier having taken a liking to her, escapes.  === The Film of Disquiet === The third part sees Vicky working on "Fatal Bolero" by the seaside. Baron Felix, the film's financier, holds court at a nearby casino. There the former actress Sabine, now the Baron's dutiful assistant, transcribes the dialogue of an anally fixated porn film while the Baron doles out money for Vicky's film. On the beach, Vicky arranges an unnamed Actress and Actor on the sand in imitation of Camille's and Jérôme's deaths. Later, he relentlessly shoots take after take of the Actress as she tries to articulate her lines – statements once spoken by Camille – amid a torrent of wind and rain. The elderly director eventually instructs the young Actress to shout simply, "yes." The scene shifts to the film's debut at a small theater. The people lining up don't even make it inside. Realizing that it is an art film shot in black and white, depicting the horrors of war, and not the least bit prurient, they wander off in disgust to see something called "Terminator 4," while the theater owner hurriedly removes the posters for the film. Sabine's ex-boyfriend arrives and declares to Baron Felix that "justice has been served."  === For Ever Mozart === In the fourth and final movement, a group of people files into an ornate hall to attend a [[Mozart]] piano concerto performed by a youth orchestra. The performance is unable to begin until the pianist, an effete young man in period garb, secures one of the set runners from "Fatal Bolero" as a page turner. As the performance commences, a fatigued Vicky keeps time to the music in the hallway, unable to make it past the top of the stairs. Inside, the music plays on, and the pages, showing Mozart's carefully crafted notation, keep turning.

The Full Monty
 The once-successful steel mills of [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], have shut down and most of the staff have been made redundant. Former steelworkers Gary "Gaz" Schofield and Dave Horsefall have resorted to stealing scrap metal from the abandoned mills to sell. Gaz is facing trouble from his former wife, Mandy and her boyfriend, Barry over [[child support]] payments that he has failed to pay since losing his job. Gaz's son, Nathan, loves his father but wishes they could do more "normal stuff" in their time together.  One day, Gaz spots a crowd of women lined up outside a local club to see a [[Chippendales|Chippendales']] [[striptease]] act. He gets the idea to form his own striptease group using local men in hopes of making enough money to pay off his child support obligations. The first to join the group is Lomper, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Gaz once worked. Depressed, Lomper attempts suicide, but is rescued by Dave who convinces him to join the group. Next, they recruit Gerald Cooper, their former foreman at the mill, who is hiding the fact that he is unemployed from his wife. Gaz and Dave see Gerald and his wife, Linda, at a dance class, and recruit him to teach them some actual dance moves.  The four men hold an open audition to recruit more members and settle on Horse, an older man who is nevertheless a good dancer, and Guy, who can't dance but proves himself to be well-endowed. The six men begin to practice their act. Gaz then learns that he has to pay £100 in order to secure the club for the night. He cannot afford this, but Nathan gets the money out of his savings. When they are greeted by two local women while they put up posters for the show, Gaz boasts they're better than the real Chippendales because they go "the [[Full monty (phrase)|full monty]]". Dave drops out due to body image issues and gets a job as a security guard at [[Asda]]. The others do a public rehearsal at the mill in front of some female relatives of Horse, but are caught mid-show by a passing policeman, and Gaz, Gerald and Horse are arrested for indecent exposure.   This costs Gaz the right to see Nathan. Lomper and Guy manage to escape arrest, and go to Lomper's house where they look lovingly at each other, starting a relationship. Gerald, meanwhile is thrown out by Linda after [[bailiff]]s arrive at their house and seize their belongings to pay Gerald's debts, resulting in him having to stay with Gaz. Later Gaz goes to Asda and asks Dave if he could borrow a jacket for Lomper's mother's funeral. Dave agrees and also decides to quit his job and they go to the funeral together. Soon, the group find the act and their arrest has made them famous.  They decide to forgo the plan, until Gaz learns that the show is sold out. He convinces the others to do it for one night only. Gerald is unsure as he has now got the job that Gaz and Dave earlier tried to sabotage his interview for, but agrees to do it just once. Initially, Dave still refuses, however regains his confidence after encouragement from his wife, Jean, and joins the rest of the group minutes before they go on stage. Nathan also arrives with Dave, having secretly come along, and tells Gaz that Mandy is there but she would not let Barry go with her.   However, Gaz himself refuses to do the act because there are men in the audience (including the police officers who watched the footage of the security camera's recording of them earlier), when the posters were supposed to say it was for women only. The other five are starting the act when Nathan orders his father to go out on stage. Gaz, proud of his son, joins the others and performs in front of the audience and Mandy, who seems to see him in a new light.  The film ends with the group performing on stage in front of a packed house, stripping to [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]' version of "[[You Can Leave Your Hat On]]" (their hats being the final item removed) with an astounding success.  
Funny Games (1997 film)
 The film begins with a wealthy Austrian family—Georg, his wife Anna, their son Georgie, and their dog Rolfi—arriving at their holiday home beside a lake in Austria. They spot their next-door neighbor Fred accompanied by two young [[Vienna|Viennese]] men, Peter and Paul, one of whom Fred introduces as the son of a friend.   The two men begin imposing themselves on the family's courtesy.  First Peter asks to borrow eggs which he keeps breaking, supposedly by accident, also destroying the family's phone with his apparent clumsiness. Eventually, a frustrated Anna demands that the men leave, asking Georg to eject them from the premises.  Peter breaks Georg's leg with the latter's golf club while Paul reveals he has killed Rolfi, and the two men take the family hostage, forcing the members to participate in games of pain and death.  Paul asks if the family wants to bet whether they will still be alive by 9:00 the next morning, though he doubts that they will win. Between playing their games, the two men keep up a constant patter, and Paul frequently ridicules Peter's weight and lack of intelligence. He relates contradictory stories of Peter's past. No definitive explanation of the men's origins or motives is offered. When some of the family's other neighbors arrive for a visit, Anna passes the men off as friends until the visitors leave—much in the same way Fred did at the beginning of the film. Georgie eventually escapes to the house next door, but finds the family dead. He attempts to shoot Paul with a [[shotgun]], but it is not loaded. Paul returns him to the house, along with the gun. After a few more games, Peter plays a [[counting-out game]] between the family members and shoots Georgie while Paul makes sandwiches in the kitchen. After this, both intruders leave.  Georg and Anna weep for their loss, but eventually resolve to survive. Anna flees the house while Georg, with a broken leg, tries to get help with the malfunctioning phone. Anna struggles to find help, but eventually Peter and Paul reappear, capture her, and return to the house. They kill Georg and take Anna out on the family's boat early the next morning. Around 8:00, Paul casually throws the bound Anna into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock at the house of the neighbors that had previously visited the family, and ask for some eggs, thereby restarting their cycle of murder.

G.I. Jane
 A [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] interviews a candidate for the position of [[Secretary of the Navy]]. Senator Lillian DeHaven ([[Anne Bancroft]]) from [[Texas]] criticizes the Navy for not being [[Gender neutrality|gender-neutral]]. Behind the curtains, a deal is struck: If women compare favorably with men in a series of [[test case]]s, the military will integrate women fully into all occupations of the Navy.  The first test is the training course of the (fictional) U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team (similar to U.S. Navy SEAL [[BUD/S]]). Senator DeHaven hand-picks topographical analyst Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil ([[Demi Moore]]), because she is physically more feminine than the other candidates.  To make the grade, O'Neil must survive a grueling selection program in which almost 60 percent of all candidates wash out, most before the fourth week, with the third week being particularly intensive ("[[United States Navy SEAL selection and training|hell week]]"). The enigmatic [[Command Master Chief Petty Officer|Command Master Chief]] John James Urgayle ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) runs the brutal training program that involves 20-hour days of tasks designed to wear down recruits' physical and mental strength, including pushing giant ship fenders up beach dunes, working through obstacle courses, and hauling landing rafts.  Given a 30-second time allowance in an [[obstacle course]], O'Neil demands to be held to the same standards as the male trainees. Eight weeks into the program, during [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]] training, the Master Chief ties her to a chair with her hands behind her back, grabs hold of her and slams her through the door, then picking her up off the floor he repeatedly dunks her head in ice cold water in front of the other crew members. O'Neil fights back, and is successful in causing him some injury despite her immobilized arms. In so doing, she acquires respect from him, as well as from the other trainees.  Navy leaders, confident that a woman would quickly drop out, become concerned. Civilian [[News media|media]] learn of O'Neil's involvement, and she becomes a sensation known as "G.I. Jane." Soon she must contend with [[trumped up charge]]s that she is a [[lesbian]], and is [[fraternization|fraternizing]] with women. O'Neil is told that she will be given a [[desk job]] during the investigation and, if cleared, will need to repeat her training. She decides to "ring out" (ringing a bell three times, signaling her voluntary withdrawal from the program) rather than accept a desk job.  It is later revealed that the photo evidence of O'Neil's alleged fraternization came from Senator DeHaven's office. DeHaven never intended for O'Neil to succeed; she used O'Neil as a bargaining chip to prevent [[military base]] closings in her home state (Texas). O'Neil threatens to expose DeHaven, who then has the charges [[void (law)|void]]ed and O'Neil restored to the program.  The final phase of training, an [[military operation|operational]] readiness exercise, is interrupted by an emergency that requires the CRT trainees' support. The situation involves a [[reconnaissance satellite]] powered by [[weapons-grade plutonium]] that fell into the [[Libya]]n [[desert]]. A team of [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Rangers]] is dispatched to retrieve the [[plutonium]], but their evacuation plan fails, and the trainees are sent to assist the Rangers. The Master Chief's shooting of a Libyan soldier to protect O'Neil leads to a confrontation with a Libyan [[military patrol|patrol]]. During the mission, O'Neil, using her experience as a topographical analyst, realizes when she sees the team's map that the Master Chief is not going to use the route the others believe he will in regrouping with the others. She also displays a definitive ability in leadership and strategy while rescuing the injured Master Chief, whom she and McCool pull out of an [[explosives]]-laden "kill zone." With [[helicopter gunship]]s delivering the final assault to the defenders, the rescue mission on the Libyan coast is a success.  Upon their return, all those who participated in the mission are accepted to the CRT. Urgayle gives O'Neil his [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] and a book of poetry containing a short [[poem]], "Self-pity", by [[D. H. Lawrence]], as acknowledgment of her accomplishment and in gratitude for rescuing him.  
The Game (1997 film)
  Nicholas Van Orton, a wealthy [[Investment banking|investment banker]], is estranged from both his ex-wife and his younger brother, Conrad. He remains haunted from having seen his father commit suicide on the latter's 48th birthday. For Nicholas's own 48th birthday, Conrad presents Nicholas with an unusual gift—a voucher for a "game" offered by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (CRS). Conrad promises that it will change his brother's life.  Nicholas has doubts about CRS, but he meets fellow bankers who enjoyed the game. He goes to CRS's offices to apply and is irritated by the lengthy and time-consuming series of psychological and physical examinations required. He is later informed that his application has been rejected. Soon Nicholas begins to believe that his business, reputation, finances, and safety are at risk. He encounters a waitress, Christine, who appears to have been endangered by the game. Nicholas contacts the police to investigate CRS, but they find the offices abandoned.  Eventually, Conrad appears to Nicholas and apologizes, claiming that he, too, has come under attack by CRS. With no one else to turn to, Nicholas finds Christine's home. He soon discovers that she is a CRS employee and that her apartment was staged. Christine tells Nicholas that they are being watched. Nicholas attacks a camera, and armed CRS troops begin to swarm the house and fire upon them. Nicholas and Christine are forced to flee. Christine tells Nicholas that CRS has drained his financial accounts by using the psychological tests to guess his passwords. In a panic, Nicholas calls his bank and gives a verification code to check his account balance—zero. Just as he begins to trust Christine, he realizes she has drugged him. As he loses consciousness, she admits that she is actually part of the scam and that he made a fatal mistake by giving up his verification code.  Nicholas wakes up to find himself entombed alive in a cemetery in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed and most of his possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door behind them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that is just part of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting on the other side of the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.  Nicholas's life passes before his eyes as he falls. He smashes through a glass roof and lands on a giant air bag. [[Emergency medical technician]]s carefully remove him, and he finds himself in a ballroom full of his friends, family, and every figure involved in his Game; it had been just a game all along. Conrad is alive and well, and explains that he initiated the game to get his brother to embrace life and not to end up like their father. Nicholas bursts into tears, relaxes, and begins to enjoy the party once his shock has dissipated. When he sees that Christine has left the party, he follows her outside to her cab. He asks her to dinner, and she offers to share a coffee with him before her flight takes her to her next game assignment in Australia.  
Gang Related
 Vice police detectives Frank Divinci ([[James Belushi]]) and Jake Rodriguez ([[Tupac Shakur]]) gun down narcotics dealer Lionel Hudd ([[Kool Moe Dee]]), after the two engage illegally in [[Illegal drug trade|drug traffic]]king; this is in order to recover the [[cocaine]] Hudd purchased from them. When Divinci and Rodriguez find out Hudd was actually a "deep cover" DEA agent—because Hudd's partner, Richard Simms ([[Gary Cole]]) drops by their precinct for help sniffing out the killers—they try to frame anyone else with the murder. It does not help that Rodriguez has outstanding gambling debts, and that a [[loan shark]] and his "enforcer", known as Mr. Cutlass Supreme ([[Tiny Lister]]) is eager for repayment. After arresting numerous felons without success (because they cannot possibly link Hudd's murder to any of them), Divinci and Rodriguez arrest a homeless drunk by the name of Joe Doe ([[Dennis Quaid]]). While Joe is still intoxicated, the detectives convince him that he shot Hudd. They even make him sign a confession. Divinci and Rodriguez convince local stripper Cynthia Webb ([[Lela Rochon]]), also Divinci's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], who was the "bait" in their trap for Hudd, to "identify" Joe in a police line-up.  At his first legal hearing, Joe is declared mentally unfit to stand trial (he cannot even remember his own last name). The trial is postponed accordingly. Really believing that he killed Hudd, Joe informs his attorney that he deserves to be in jail and is not willing to accept a plea bargain. Meanwhile, it turns out that the .44 Magnum that Divinci stole from the police-evidence room to kill Hudd is that of Clyde David Dunner, a murderer and arsonist arrested by Divinci and Rodriguez and whose case is currently being tried. To fill the void, Divinci gets another gun to replace the other, but during trial Dunner recognizes that this one is not his gun and the case is dropped for lack of evidence.  At Joe's second hearing, high-profile lawyer Arthur Baylor ([[James Earl Jones]]) attends the proceedings. Baylor reveals that his client's name is actually William Dane McCall, and that he is actually the missing-and-presumed-dead co-heir to the financial empire of a high-status family, as well as a surgeon who used to attend and perform organ transplants for the poor in Africa. Baylor asks the court to grant a one-week [[continuance]] so he can prepare his defense properly. The court agrees. Afterwards, Cynthia is summoned to testify in court. Nervous and afraid, she disappears. Divinci, fearing that she may betray him, hires a [[bail]] agent named Manny ([[Terrence C. Carson]]) to locate her; when Manny's efforts fail, he is roughed up by Divinci and Rodriguez. Cynthia is finally discovered and brought in for ''The People vs. William Dane McCall''. She gives her rehearsed testimony against "Joe", at which time William informs Baylor that he lived in an alley next to Cynthia's apartment. Baylor questions Cynthia and points to the contradictions in her testimony until she finally confesses to knowing "Joe". The fact that she knows the defendant as "Joe" and not as "William Dane McCall" shows that she had previous knowledge of the defendant, thus proving her testimony for "Joe" being Hudd's killer to be false. She is arrested for [[perjury]] while the verdict of William's case remains pending. Divinci hires Manny to get Cynthia out of jail. He plans to kill her before she can testify.  On their way to "silence" her, Rodriguez tells Divinci how he feels regarding the numerous murders they have committed. Divinci suddenly suspects his partner of taping their conversation; such indeed turns out to be the case, after Divinci forcibly searches Rodriguez. Rodriguez informs Divinci that he has already confessed to the DEA regarding what they have done. Unwilling to kill Rodriguez here and now, Divinci renounces their friendship and drives off into the night. Rodriguez returns home to find his bookie and Mr. Cutlass Supreme waiting for him. Enraged about the preceding events, he attacks them only to be shot dead. Cynthia is brought to court by Baylor, who strikes a deal with her to testify against Divinci and thus get her perjury case dropped.  Four months later, Frank has become a fugitive. Knowing that Cynthia blew the whistle on him, he breaks into her home. He takes her money, then shoots and badly wounds her. Cynthia is rushed to an emergency room at the local hospital, where Doctor William Dane McCall is shown to have just completed a surgery and discusses it with a fellow surgeon as Cynthia is wheeled into the same O.R. he just exited.  Divinci forces Manny to help smuggle him out of the country. Manny hires a luxurious car and a driver for Frank. Unfortunately for Divinci, said driver turns out to be Clyde David Dunner who produces the same revolver used to kill Hudd. He shoots Frank in the head, then abandons the car and body in a deserted alley.  
Future War
 ''Future War'' begins aboard a spaceship undergoing a revolt. A man enters and activates an escape pod which travels to Earth and crashes into the Pacific Ocean. The pod contains “The Runaway”, a human slave played by [[Daniel Bernhardt]]. He is being pursued by [[cyborg]] slavers and dinosaurs that they use as “trackers.” Since he was kidnapped some time from Earth’s past, The Runaway is familiar with the English language and the [[King James Bible]], and he regards Earth as a literal heaven.  The Runaway finds refuge with novice nun Sister Ann (Travis Brooks Stewart), whose past involved dealing drugs and prostitution. Together, they fight the dinosaurs and their robotic masters, seeking help from a street gang. ''Future War'' features star Daniel Bernhardt’s [[kickboxing]] skills in several fight sequences, including against the Cyborg Master ([[Robert Z'Dar]]).  After being arrested as a suspect in a rash of deaths due to strange animal attacks, The Runaway is interrogated by federal agents. They present to him a dinosaur collar found on the beach. The Cyborg Master breaks into the police station during the interrogation and The Runaway manages to escape in the confusion. He returns to Sister Ann and her gang friends with a plan to attack the dinosaurs where they live, as Runaway simply explains, "Near water...".  Using dynamite, The Runaway successfully destroys a water treatment plant, killing the dinosaurs. Later, though, the surviving Cyborg Master attacks The Runaway while he watches Sister Ann make her final vows to become a [[nun]]. After The Runaway finally kills the Cyborg Master, he becomes a counselor for runaway teens, working closely with Sister Ann.

What transpires later forms the crux of the story.  
Gattaca
 In "the not-too-distant future", [[libertarian eugenics]] is common. A genetic registry database uses [[biometrics]] to classify those so created as "valids" while those conceived by traditional means and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as "in-valids". [[Genetic discrimination]] is illegal, but in practice [[genotype]] profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.  Vincent Freeman is conceived without the aid of genetic selection; his genetics indicate a high probability of several disorders and an estimated life span of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection to give birth to their next child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of "[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]" by swimming out to sea with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and bests him before Anton starts to drown. Vincent saves Anton and then leaves home.  Years later, Vincent works as an in-valid, cleaning office spaces including that of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, a space-flight conglomerate. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using hair, skin, blood and urine samples from a donor, Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is a former swimming star paralyzed due to a car accident. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned to be navigator for an upcoming trip to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. To keep his identity hidden, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, and pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples.  Gattaca becomes embroiled in controversy when one of its administrators is murdered a week before the flight. The police find a fallen eyelash of Vincent's at the scene. An investigation is launched to find the murderer, Vincent being the top suspect. Through this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will prevent her from joining any deep space Gattaca mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is by his own hand; after coming in second place in a swim meet, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet wasn't, and that is the source of his suffering.  Vincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director was the killer, with the administrator’s threats to cancel the mission as motive. Vincent learns the identity of the detective who closed the case, his brother Anton, who in turn has become aware of Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent that what he is doing is illegal, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to one more game of chicken. As the two swim out in the dead of night, Anton expresses surprise at Vincent's stamina, so Vincent reveals that his strategy for winning was not to save energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore using [[celestial navigation]].  On the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, the person in charge of background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but "not all that they promised", could break the limits just as Vincent has. He passes Vincent as a valid. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair attached to it. Vincent muses on this, stating "For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home."  
Geri's Game
 In an empty park during [[fall]], the title character, Geri (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]), is an [[Old age|elderly]] man who plays a game of [[chess]] against himself, "becoming" each of the players in turn by moving to the other side of the [[chessboard]], where he changes his personality and either puts on or takes off his glasses to show this change. As the chess game progresses, it seems as though there are two people playing chess; at one point, the hands of both "opponents" are seen within the frame. Geri's aggressive alter ego soon gains the upper hand over  Geri, capturing every one of his pieces except for his [[king (chess)|king]] and [[Queen (chess)|queen]]. Just one false move on the king, and his queen is captured and he can't move his king, putting him in [[check (chess)|check]]. However, Geri outsmarts himself by faking a [[heart attack]] to distract himself and spinning the board around. While his alternate self is still distracted, Geri [[checkmate]]s what is now his opponent's king. Finding that he is now the one who is losing and realizing what has happened, Geri begrudgingly [[resign (chess)|resigns]] the game and hands over a set of false [[dentures]] as the prize. Geri then puts them into his mouth, chuckling and basking in his victory as he sits by himself, while the camera pulls back to reveal him alone at the chessboard.  
George of the Jungle (film)
 In an animated sequence, a plane flying through the fictional Bukuvu region in the heart of Africa crashes. A child on board the plane, George, disappears into the jungle and is raised by a sapient, talking gorilla named Ape. Twenty-five years later, George has grown to be King of the Jungle.  Ursula Stanhope, a [[San Francisco]] heiress, tours [[Uganda]] with local guide Kwame and a trio of porters. Ursula is tracked down and joined by her fiancé, Lyle Van De Groot, with two [[poacher]]s named Max and Thor. Kwame tells the group of the "White Ape", a local legend of a superhuman primate that rules the jungle. The next day Lyle, insistent on taking Ursula home as soon as possible, goes into the jungle with her to find the White Ape and they are attacked by a lion. Lyle knocks himself out trying to flee and Ursula is saved by George, who enjoys swinging on vines to move about but has a habit of crashing into trees. George takes Ursula to his [[treehouse]] home and cares for her, introducing her to Shep, an [[African elephant]] that acts like George's dog, and Tookie, a [[toco toucan]]. George is smitted with Ursula and attempts to woo her; Ursula reciprocates an attraction, and her time spent with George passes over her wishes to return home.  Lyle, Max and Thor find the treehouse and Lyle confronts Ursula and George. Max and Thor make to shoot Shep for his [[ivory]], and Ape shouts at Shep to run. Everyone is stunned by the sight of a talking ape and Max and Thor decide to tranquilize and capture him. George runs to stop them and is accidentally shot by Lyle, who thought his gun was a novelty lighter. Lyle and the poachers are imprisoned and Lyle is identified as the shooter by the porters; Max and Thor are released and resolve to capture Ape to make a fortune in [[Las Vegas]]. Meanwhile, Ursula takes George home to get medical help for his wound and to see the human world he belongs in.  While Ursula is at work, George explores San Francisco and uses his vine-swinging to rescue a [[paragliding|paraglider]] that got tangled in the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]]. Ursula, uninterested in marrying Lyle, admits the truth to her parents, but her overbearing mother Beatrice objects. At a party intended to celebrate Ursula's engagement, Beatrice takes George aside and coldly tells him she will not let Ursula's engagement fall apart, and refuses to let George be with her. In Africa, Max and Thor capture Ape, who manages to order Tookie to find George before he falls unconscious. Tookie flies to San Francisco and George returns to the jungle, leaving Ursula in the night. While Ursula's parents comfort her, she realizes she loves George and goes to find him, much to Beatrice's dismay but to her father's approval.  Ape tricks the poachers into circling the jungle and returning to the treehouse where George confronts them and incapacitates them with his animal friends. However, Lyle arrives: the narrator explains that Lyle escaped prison, joined a cult, and is now an ordained minister. Lyle has mercenaries he has brought with him subdue George and takes Ursula to the nearby Ape River where he has a boat waiting to escape while he performs a marriage ceremony. However, the river is a harsh series of rapids that hurdle the two into danger. George performs his biggest swing and crashes into a massive tree that falls over the river where he pulls Ursula to safety. Lyle ends up in a cave and, believing he is still sharing the boat with Ursula, proclaims them wedded; he lights his lighter and beholds he just married himself to a gorilla.  George and Ursula fall in love with each other and marry, Ursula moving into George's tree house. Some years later the two are raising a son, George Jr, who they present to the animals from atop [[The Lion King|Pride Rock]].  In a mid-credits scene, Ape reveals he has become a famous entertainer in Las Vegas, using Max and Thor as stunt men.  
Genealogies of a Crime
 During a stormy night, René ([[Melvil Poupaud]]) disposes of a knife, which is picked up by an unrevealed individual. The scene fades to a blank [[Go (game)|Go]] board and the narrator describes an ancient Chinese fable concerning a young man who kills a woman of the Liu Bao family, only to be killed after falling in love with her ghost.  Presumably later, Solange ([[Catherine Deneuve]]) is questioned by a lawyer. She begins recounting how she took on René’s case: Immediately after the death of her son, Pascal, Solange receives a call from her colleague Mathieu. Mathieu informs her that René is accused of murdering Jeanne (also played by Denueve), his aunt and a member of the “Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society” which René blames for the murder. Solange agrees, and at her son’s funeral she is introduced to Georges Didier ([[Michel Piccoli]]); the eccentric head of the Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society. Georges’ behavior is immediately apparent as unusual, he is quick to anger and relies on a notebook to remember other people’s names. Later, Solange meets René, who claims to want to be her friend and convinces her to play a game involving role-reversal. During the game, Solange reveals that she is known for taking on hopeless cases, and has lost every single one. Solange travels to Jeanne’s former home and is accommodated by Esther (Bernadette Lafon), Jeanne’s former maid. Solange begins reading Jeanne’s diary and the film transitions to René’s adolescence.  From the onset, Jeanne notes that René displays “criminal” behavior. As a young child René exhibits violent and unusual behavior: he destroys several pieces of China and develops a fascination with knives. In his later years, Jeanne notes that he acts normal, but still has destructive tendencies and is possibly a kleptomaniac. Jeanne attempts to treat René by utilizing the role-reversal game he had played with Solange earlier in the film. Through the game, Jeanne learns that René has hidden all the items he has stolen around the estate. At some point in his young adulthood, René leaves the estate, and contacts Jeanne when he needs money. On a day when Jeanne is meeting with her colleague Georges, René asks Jeanne for money and she refuses. During her meeting, René is seen in the background, running from a crowd presumably after attempting to steal something. While this occurs, Jeanne is introduced to Christian Corrail ( [[Andrzej Seweryn]]), a fellow psychoanalyst and Georges’ personal nemesis. Four months before her murder, Jeanne catches Rene stealing her furniture with his friends. They engage in the same role-reversal game they’ve played several times before, and Jeanne in her anger shoots René in the arm, at which point René insists the game is over. That event is the last entry in her diary.  Back in present time, Solange leaves the estate and tells Mathieu her theory: Jeanne trained René to kill her, and therefore committed suicide. Later, Solange has dinner with her mother, Louise (Monique Melinand), who reveals that Solange also demonstrated sociopathic behavior as a child. During a visit with Georges afterwards, Louise dies of a heart attack. At the funeral, Solange is informed that René has attempted suicide. At the hospital, Solange encounters Georges, who is thrown out after creating a disturbance while attempting to locate and speak to René. Solange begins to suspect Georges and her suspicions are confirmed when she is invited to witness a tableau vivant style ceremony orchestrated by the Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society. The ceremony recreates a painting and alternatively blindfolds the subject and the participants. Georges revealed that he used this experiment on René. Now awake, René claims that after this ceremony he awoke and panicked upon finding his aunt dead. Solange arranges her defense around this and René is acquitted. With their reputation tarnished, the Franco-Belgian Psychoanalytic Society commits [[mass suicide]]. René reappears soon after and begins a relationship with Solange. This relationship grows abusive, and one night Solange is driven by her own childhood tendencies and murders René and his friends. This is the conclusion of Solange’s statement to her lawyer, who has decided that Solange will plea insanity for the murder.

Gerrie & Louise
    
Good Burger
  On the first day of summer, slacker high school student Dexter Reed takes his mother's car, a [[Nissan 300ZX]], on a joyride while she is on a business trip and accidentally crashes into and damages the car of his teacher, Mr. Wheat. Dexter is in danger of going to jail, as he does not have a driver's license or insurance. But Mr. Wheat agrees to let Dexter pay for the damages to both cars in exchange for not calling the police on Dexter. With the damages estimated at $1,900, Dexter is forced to get a summer job. After being dismissed from the new, soon-to-open Mondo Burger for clashing with and insulting the owner/manager, Kurt Bozwell, he ends up finding employment at Good Burger where he meets and reluctantly befriends dimwitted Ed and a host of other colorful employees. Initially, neither of them are aware that it was Ed who inadvertently caused Dexter's car accident; Ed had been on his way to make a delivery, and skated in front of Dexter, causing him to swerve out of control and crash into Mr. Wheat.  The survival of the smaller Good Burger is threatened by the grand opening of Mondo Burger, with its fancy decor and oversized burgers, but Good Burger is saved by Ed's new secret sauce. Upon realizing that Ed caused his car accident, and learning from Mr. Wheat that the true damages from the accident exceed the original $1,900 estimate (now $2,500), Dexter takes advantage of Ed to make money off the secret sauce in order to pay off his debt sooner. Ed signs a contract that gives Dexter 80% of his profits.  Ed's sauce vastly improves Good Burger's sales and draws the attention of Kurt Bozwell, who wants it for Mondo Burger. Kurt fails at luring Ed to Mondo Burger at a higher wage, and sends Roxanne, a beautiful employee, to seduce the sauce recipe from Ed; this ends with Roxanne being repeatedly injured by Ed's clumsiness and ultimately quitting her job.  Later on, when they notice a dog's refusal to eat a discarded Mondo Burger in favor of a Good Burger, Ed and Dexter become suspicious and decide to investigate. Disguised as fashionable women, the two infiltrate Mondo Burger's kitchen and discover that their burgers are being artificially enhanced with Triampathol, an illegal chemical. Kurt discovers them, and calls an acquaintance named Wade, who has them committed to an asylum called Demented Hills so they can't tell the public.  Threatened by the success of Ed's sauce, Kurt and his men break into Good Burger after hours and taint Ed's secret sauce with shark poison, but are confronted by Otis, an elderly Good Burger employee who was sleeping on the premises, leading Kurt to commit Otis to Demented Hills as well. After informing Ed and Dexter about Kurt's scheme, the three of them manage to escape Demented Hills and steal an ice cream truck to drive themselves back to Good Burger, arriving just in time to prevent anyone from eating the poisoned sauce.  Ed and Dexter then break into Mondo Burger to expose their chemically induced burgers to the police. Dexter creates a diversion, during which Ed tries to take a can of Triampathol, but clumsily knocks one into the meat grinder. Inspired, Ed pours nearly the entire supply into the grinder. Meanwhile, Kurt has captured Dexter, when suddenly Ed arrives bearing an empty can. Kurt mocks Ed's presumed foolishness, whereupon Ed snidely comments that the can wasn't empty when he found it. At that moment, chaos ensues in the Mondo Burger building, as the burgers begin exploding due to overuse of Triampathol.  In the aftermath, Kurt is arrested for using the illegal substance and for poisoning Ed's sauce. Mondo Burger is destroyed, with a large, artificial burger destroying Mr. Wheat's newly repaired car as well. Dexter also tears up the contract he formed with Ed and tells him that he gets to keep all the profits from his sauce. Ed and Dexter then walk back to Good Burger where they are both praised by the other employees as heroes for saving the restaurant.

During the ride, a bump causes the boat to disconnect from the car, leaving Joe and Gus stranded yet again, and the boat is accidentally hooked to a train and pulled away along with their beer and supplies. Joe and Gus hitch a ride with two men, but on the way, they see their car at a gas station and investigate. Joe goes to confront Martin inside the bathroom, but backs down when he catches Martin loading a gun. Joe and Gus flee the petrol station in their car, and discover a blood-stained knife in the dashboard.  Joe and Gus stay at a trailer park for the night, and while watching a documentary on television, they learn that Martin is actually Dekker Massey, a wanted criminal who has conned several women out of their riches and is implied to have stabbed his last victim to death and hidden her money and jewelry somewhere. The presenters offer a bounty for Dekker's capture, and Joe and Gus decide to turn in the knife after their fishing trip. Meanwhile, Dekker begins hunting Joe and Gus down.  Following a recommendation by the trailer park owner, Joe and Gus visit Phil Beasly's boatyard and rent a speedboat, but end up breaking almost every gadget on the boat, losing the knife and wrecking the boatyard by accident. Distraught, they decide to return home early, but end up with a flat tire. While getting the spare tire from the trunk, Joe discovers a map that leads to Dekker's fortune. They book a room in a nearby hotel, and while having dinner, they are found by Rita and Angie, who question them about Dekker and reveal that they are after him because Rita's mother was one of Dekker's victims. Joe and Gus promise to bring Dekker to justice, but that night, Gus sleepwalks and starts a fire in the hotel, destroying their suite and the map. They only barely manage to escape undetected, though their car breaks down on the road and Joe is struck by lightning while they try to fix it. Instead of killing him, the lightning boosts Joe's memory and he is able to lead the way to the cave where Dekker hid his fortune. Despite an altercation with an alligator, they retrieve the treasure and escape, but are accosted by Dekker. At gunpoint, Dekker forces them to push Joe's car into the swamp and ties them up inside a sheriff's office, intending to flee the country with the treasure.  After Dekker leaves, however, Joe and Gus are found and freed by their idol, Billy "Catch" Pool (Nelson), and they set out to stop Dekker. After a long chase across the swamp, Joe and Gus find and capture Dekker moments before his escape via plane and hand him over to the police. Though they claim the reward money, Joe and Gus are forced to spend it mostly on the damages they caused during their trip.

Sean does not regret his decision, even though his wife died of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.  Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his "chief negotiator", and by turning down a position at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain.  Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and takes a sabbatical to travel the world. When Will's friends present him with a rebuilt [[Chevrolet Nova]] for his twenty-first birthday, he decides to pass on his job offer and drive to California to reunite with Skylar. Some time later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness.  
Green Fish
 Having just been discharged from the military, Mak-dong is on the train home. As he leans out the train platform, Mi-ae, a beautiful woman in the car ahead of him, is also leaning out. Her pink scarf escapes from her and poignantly lands on Mak-dong's face, blinding him. As he goes back into the train car to return the scarf, he becomes embroiled in a fight with a group of thugs who are harassing Mi-ae. From the beginning, Mak-dong is entangled in a relationship that becomes his undoing.  Home, Ilsan, is not the same for Mak-dong anymore. The fields, acacias and rice paddies have gone, replaced by high rise apartments. He discovers his mother is working as a house maid, and all of his siblings except his mentally disabled brother—who is literally the eldest brother and called "big brother," have left home, struggling to make a living. His sister is working as a hostess, his younger brother is working as an egg delivery man, and his older brother is a detective who is also a violent drunk. Mak-dong's dream, which he expresses to his brother, is for the whole family to live together again, running a family business, and living in harmony. His brother replies then how would any of them make a living?  While looking for work in an alienated neighborhood of Seoul, Youngdeungpo, Mak-dong again sees Mi-ae, the owner of the pink scarf, and follows her into a nightclub where she is a singer. She is also the girlfriend of a gang boss Bae Tae-gon, and when Mak-dong tries to defend her from his thugs when they force her into a car, he ends up getting beat up again. Later, at Mi-ae's urging, the boss gives him a reference for a job at a parking lot.  Mak-dong is given the opportunity to make a lot of money by inciting a fight with a council man who is obstructing Bae Tae-gon's building permit. In order to do this convincingly, Mak-dong breaks his fingers by slamming a door on them. Seeing him complete his task with such dedication, Bae Tae-gon elevates him by allowing him to call him "hyung," or "Big Brother," and admitting him as a full-fledged member of the gang. This causes some of the underlings to become disgruntled, as it would normally take at least a year to reach this status.  Now a member of 'the family', Mak-dong and Mi-ae find in each other a kindred spirit, the feeling between them not clearly defined, yet finding themselves drawn to each other through their common feeling of hopelessness. In an important scene on the train, Mi-ae and Mak-dong talk and he gives her a photo of the large, green tree in front of his home in Ilsan. Mi-ae is struck by Mak-dong's naivete and purity. It is revealed Mak-dong is a virgin. Her beeper goes off, and it is Bae Tae-gun telling her to return home immediately. She tells Mak-dong she will do whatever he says, and with a traditional Korean loyalty, he responds that if big brother has asked them to return they should. Mi-ae laughs bitterly at his old fashioned simplicity. After a night when Bae Tae-gon sends her up to the hotel room of a prosecutor as a sexual "favor", she insults the gang boss. Mak-dong witnesses Bae Tae-gon slapping her, then drives her home. She offers herself to Mak-ong even though she is "dirty."  Suddenly, Bae Tae-gon's own former gang boss Kim Yang-kil arrives from years behind bars to take for himself the little empire Bae Tae-gon has spent his life building. In several encounters with Kim Yang-kil, Bae Tae-gon is humiliated in front of his own gang. Bae Tae-gon takes Mak-dong up to the deserted building where he wants to build his future empire, and asks him what his dream is. Bae replies he also got as far as he did because of one of those dreams. Mak-dong makes a final expression of his loyalty by stabbing Kim Yang-kil to death in a men's bathroom. As blood flows everywhere, Mak-dong becomes hysterical.  Immediately after, Mak-dong calls home in the famous "phone booth" scene. He asks his mentally challenged "big brother" if he remembers how they used to fish in the river, and how one day he lost a whole day of fishing because he tried to catch one of the green fish and lost his slipper in the river. Immediately after, Bae Tae-gon takes Mak-dong to the deserted building, and being consistent with the ruthless nature that has got him so far in life, fatally shoots him, leaving him for dead. Mak-dong staggers out and sprawls across the windshield of Bae's car, staring straight into the camera and dying as Mi-ae screams in horror.  Some time later, Bae Tae-gon and Mi-ae have moved to the Ilsan New Town that typifies the new middle class suburbs that have sprung up around Seoul's satellite cities. One day they come upon an old-style restaurant in an old-style house run by a family. Mi-ae appears to be pregnant. The couple order chicken soup, and a chicken is slaughtered in front of them, recalling the sacrifice Mak-dong made for his dream to come true. Outside, Mi-ae recognizes with tears the tree in the photo she has kept all this time and realizes it is Mak-dong's family home.

Gummo
 A grainy voiced narrator (Solomon) recounts the events of the tornado while disturbing home-movie images play — mostly of the town's people. A [[Muteness|mute]] [[adolescence|adolescent]] boy, known as Bunny Boy, wears only pink bunny ears, shorts, and tennis shoes on an overpass in the rain.  A cat is carried by the scruff of its neck by Tummler, a teenage boy. He drowns the cat in a barrel of water. The film then cuts to a different scene with Tummler, in a wrecked car with a girl. They fondle each other, and Tummler realizes there is a lump in one of the girl's breasts.  Tummler and Solomon then ride down a hill on bikes. The narrator introduces Tummler as a boy with "a marvelous persona", whom some people call "downright evil". Later, Tummler aims an air rifle at a cat. His friend Solomon stops him from killing the cat, protesting that it is a house cat. They leave and the camera follows the cat to its owners' house. The cat is owned by three sisters, two of whom are teenagers and one who is pre-[[Puberty|pubescent]].  The film cuts back to Tummler and Solomon, who are hunting [[feral]] cats. They bring the cats to a local grocer, who intends to butcher and sell them to a local restaurant, and the grocer tells them that they have a rival in the cat killing business. They then buy glue from the grocer, which they use to get high via [[Inhalant abuse|huffing]].  The film then cuts to a scene in which two [[Profanity|foul-mouthed]] young boys dressed as cowboys destroy things in a junkyard. Bunny Boy arrives and the other boys shoot him "dead" with [[cap gun]]s. Bunny Boy plays dead and the boys curse at him, rifle through his pockets, then remove and throw one of his shoes. They grow bored of this and leave him sprawled on the ground.  Tummler and Solomon track down a local boy who is poaching "their" cats. The poacher, named Jarrod Wiggley, is poisoning the cats rather than shooting them. When Tummler and Solomon break into Jarrod's house with masks and weapons with intent to hurt him, they find photos of the young teen in drag and his elderly grandmother, who is [[Catatonia|catatonic]] and attached to [[life support]] machinery. The poacher Jarrod is forced to care for her, which he had earlier opined was "disgusting". Seeing that Jarrod isn't home, Tummler and Solomon decide to leave. Tummler then discovers the grandmother lying in her bed, states that it is "no way to live," and turns off the life support machine.  A number of other scenes are interspersed throughout the film, including: an intoxicated man (played by [[Harmony Korine]]) flirting with a [[Homosexuality|gay]] [[Dwarfism|dwarf]]; a man pimping his [[Down syndrome]] afflicted sister to Solomon and Tummler; the sisters encountering an elderly  [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]; a pair of twin boys selling candy door-to-door; a brief conversation with a tennis player who is treating his [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]]; a long scene of Solomon eating dinner while taking a bath in dirty water; a drunken party with [[Arm wrestling|arm-]] and chair-wrestling; and two [[skinhead]] brothers boxing each other in their kitchen. There are also a number of even smaller scenes depicting [[Satanism|Satanic rituals]], footage seemingly from home movies, and conversations containing racial bigotry.  The next scene in the movie is set to the song "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]" by [[Roy Orbison]], which had been previously mentioned by Tummler as the song his older brother, who was a transsexual, would sing (the brother eventually went to the "Big City" and abandoned him). The final scene involves Solomon and Tummler shooting the sisters' cat repeatedly with their air rifles in the rain with jump cuts to Bunny Boy kissing the teenage girls in a swimming pool. Bunny Boy runs towards the camera through a field holding the body of the dead cat, which he shows to the audience, breaking the [[fourth wall]].  The final scene shows a girl, who shaved her eyebrows earlier in the movie, singing "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" in front of her parents in bed. The film finally cuts to black as they tell her to go to bed.  
Grosse Pointe Blank
 Professional assassin Martin Blank finds himself depressed and disillusioned with his work. Grocer, his chief rival, is attempting to incorporate the hitman business but Martin refuses to join, putting the two at odds. Following a botched contract, Martin accepts an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan]]. He is persuaded into going by both his reluctant therapist, Dr. Oatman, and his secretary Marcella, who books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to make amends with the client whose contract was botched.  Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his childhood friend Paul and his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio disc jockey, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the [[United States Army|Army]]. He also visits his mentally ill mother in a retirement home, and his father's grave. Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, another hitman who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store built over his childhood home. He is also followed by two [[National Security Agency|NSA]] agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to win over Debi and fails to open the dossier on his target.  At the reunion, Martin and Debi mingle with their former classmates, and begin to fall in love all over again. Later, while exploring the halls alone, Martin is ambushed by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self defense. Debi stumbles upon the scene and flees the reunion in horror. Paul arrives moments later, and helps Martin dispose of LaPoubelle's body in the school furnace.   Debi later confronts Martin in his hotel room; he reveals that when he joined the army, his psyche profile showed a "moral flexibility" that made him suitable to work as an assassin for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], after which he decided to go freelance. His rationalizations for his work terrify Debi even further; she rejects his attempts at reconciliation and walks out. Martin fires Oatman over the phone, lays off Marcella, and finally opens the dossier detailing the contract that brought him to Grosse Pointe. He is surprised to find that the target is Debi's father, Bart, who is scheduled to testify against Martin's client.  Accompanied by several henchmen, Grocer decides to kill Bart himself to impress Martin's client. Martin abandons the contract and rescues Bart, driving him to the Newberry house and holing up inside. During the siege, Martin finally admits to Debi that he left her on prom night to protect her from his homicidal urges, which were due to his troubled upbringing. Martin gradually kills off the henchmen, and the NSA agents are gunned down by both Grocer and Martin. Martin then kills Grocer by smashing a television over his head. Injured and winded, Martin proposes marriage to Debi, who does not respond. In the end, Debi and Martin leave Grosse Pointe together.

Sahil is an unattached and easy-going young man, who resents Sinha, Sinha  has a younger son named Harsh. Ishwar Dewan ([[Paresh Rawal]]) is Sinha's Personal Secretary, and his daughter Isha ([[Kajol]]) is Sahil's beloved. On the other hand, Sheetal ([[Manisha Koirala]]), the daughter of Meghnad  Chaudhry, is also in love with Sahil, but it is not reciprocated by him.  One evening, Sinha throws a party for Sahil's birthday  and  announces Sahil's engagement to Sheetal, upon which an argument breaks out. At one point, Sahil tries to stab his father, but is stopped by Sharda. The next day, Sahil gets heavily drunk at the house of Dr Gandhi ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]), Sinha's family doctor, who advises Sahil to accept Sheetal as his wife and that Sahil will lead a happier life with her. A drunk Sahil returns home and finds to his shock that someone has stabbed Sinha. Before Sinha can tell the name of the murderer he dies, while Sharda arrives and finds Sahil near his dead step-father holding a knife. Sahil is accused and taken to court, where many of his acquaintances and Sharda testify against him. Sahil is found guilty and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Just before Sahil is transported to jail, he hands over a necklace to Sheetal, implying that it was left behind at the scene by the killer.  In jail, Sahil relates his story to an old prisoner, who believes him to be innocent. The prisoner tells Sahil that the jail only has one escape route - a sewage gutter pipe that can be accessed from a [[flush toilet]] located in an unused chamber of the jail. Sahil creates a problem with other prisoners, causing the jailor ([[Tej Sapru]]) to confine him and two prisoners in the chamber. The three succeed in escaping the jail by sea, with a boat arranged by Sheetal.  Police Commissioner Patwardhan ([[Anjan Srivastav]]) assigns an unbending and upright police officer Udham Singh ([[Om Puri]]) to handle the case of Sahil's re-apprehension. Sahil secretly meets Isha at her home, where he calls Dr Gandhi for advice, and Dr Gandhi invites Sahil to his home. Sahil reaches the doctor's residence and is shocked to find that somebody has stabbed Dr Gandhi. Dr Gandhi's servant finds Sahil near the dead doctor and shrieks, causing him to run away. Dr Gandhi's servant reports Sahil to the police.  Udham Singh interrogates Sheetal, with whom Sahil still maintains a good relationship. Sheetal confesses to having spent the previous night with Sahil and also helping him escape jail. Singh does not arrest Sheetal for these wrongdoings.  Sahil, to prove his innocence resolves to find the real murderer. He suspects advocate  Thanawala, because Thanawala had a very good chance of obtaining Sinha's property upon his death, provided Sahil is out of the picture. He asked Thanawala and beat him and figures that he is not the murderer. Sahil now suspects Chaudhry or his brother, because of Chaudhry's involvement in business fraud. After interrogating him, Sahil realises that Chaudhry is innocent as well. The next is Vilas Rao, the corrupt Union leader, who points the finger at Mantriji, saying that Sinha's murder was a political [[assassination]]. Sahil and Sheetal trick Mantriji into attending a ceremony and kidnap him. Udham Singh is also present there and realizes that Sahil is not the real murderer.  Udham Singh finds out that the murders have been committed with two knives of exactly the same build and shape, that could belong to a set. He finds the set of knives at Ishwar Dewan's house and arrests Dewan, who confesses to the killing of Sinha and Dr Gandhi. Dewan divulges to have murdered Sinha because he did not accept Isha as his daughter-in-law; and killed Dr Gandhi to cover up the first crime. At the same time, Sahil was interrogating Mantriji, but Sheetal arrives and tells him that the murderer is Ishwar Dewan, making Sahil release Mantriji.  Harsh, Sinha's son, is seen playing with the necklace which Sahil had found at the crime scene. He opens the necklace and finds his and Isha's picture inside the locket. So apparently Isha is the murderer. In the meantime, Isha stabs Officer Udam Singh, who suffers major wounds.  Sahil interrogates Ishwar Dewan, who reveals that Isha was the murderer and gives a summary of all the murders she committed, simply because she didn't want to be separated from Sahil.  Sahil understands that Isha will attack Sheetal next and calls her and informs her to lock all doors and entrances. Sheetal takes this warning jokingly as Isha arrives. Sheetal is fooled by Isha at first, because she falsely apologizes. Isha attacks Sheetal at her house, where Sahil arrives on time to save her. The police also arrive and end up shooting Isha. Isha and Sahil share a last embrace before she dies.

  Ho Po-wing ([[Leslie Cheung]]) and Lai Yiu-fai ([[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]]), a couple from pre-handover Hong Kong, visit [[Argentina]] hoping to renew their ailing relationship. The two have a pattern of abuse, followed by breakups and reconciliations. One of their goals in Argentina is to visit the [[Iguazu Falls|Iguazu waterfalls]], which serves as a [[leitmotif]] in the movie.  Ho Po-wing bought a lamp with the Iguazu Falls on, then the two decided to visit the falls together. During the ride, however, they get into an argument and break up. Lai (played by Tony Leung) is the more stable and committed of the two, and desires nothing more than a fairly normal life. He tries to deal with the break-up rationally and gets a job at a local nightclub. Ho (played by Leslie Cheung) has an extremely destructive personality and is not able to commit to a monogamous relationship. Ho seems to be motivated by both a need for attention as well as a need to simply hurt Lai. Ho picks up numerous other men, and even goes so far to bring them to the club that Lai works at. Lai tries very hard to lead a normal life at this point, but is nearly driven to the edge of insanity by Ho; Lai eventually quits and beats a man with a bottle.  One day Ho Po-wing turns up severely beaten at Lai Yiu-fai's apartment, who takes him in and begins to take care of him. Ho's hands are injured so at this point, he relies on Lai for nearly everything. Initially, Lai works hard to keep Ho at bay physically and emotionally. However, in the end, they get back together. Their actions indicate a continual pattern of abuse, break-up, finally followed by reconciliation. As in the previous times, in the beginning Ho does try to make the relationship work, and the two seem genuinely happy. However, as Ho recovers, he begins again to pick up other men and ignore Lai. We see gradually the destructive side of Ho's personality taking over and the familiar cycle of mutual abuse and dependence starting again.  As Lai and Ho's relationships starts falling apart again, Lai befriends Chang, a fellow Chinese from [[Taiwan]] at work. In some sense, Chang is Ho's opposite. Whereas Ho is manipulative and volatile, Chang is straightforward and stable. After Ho fully recovers, he resumes his playboy lifestyle and leaves Lai. Lai copes with the loss by spending more and more time with Chang. It is hinted that Chang is also gay and attracted to Lai; Chang states in a voiceover that he likes 'deep, low voices' and is seen rejecting advances from an attractive female coworker. Chang's unassuming self-awareness and sincerity help Lai out of his depression, contributing to his eventual realisation that his relationship with Ho Po-wing is based on an ideal which no longer has any basis in reality. During one of their many conversations, Chang tells Lai that his goal is to reach the southern tip of South America where there is a lighthouse where supposedly all sorrows can be dropped. Eventually, Chang departs Buenos Aires and continues on this journey.  After Chang leaves, Lai sinks deeper into depression; he works various boring jobs in order make more money and eventually resorts to sexual encounters with other men in public restrooms and cinemas as a means to cope with his loneliness. He remarks in voiceovers at this point that in some sense he better understands Ho's promiscuity, as these encounters seem to be a way to numb the emotional pain.

While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' jealous brother [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Olympus. Turning to [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#The Fates|the Fates]] for help, Hades learns that in eighteen years, a [[planetary alignment]] will allow him to locate and free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his minions [[Pain and Panic]] to dispose of Hercules. The two succeed at kidnapping the infant and feeding him a formula that turns him mortal, but fail to remove his superhuman strength before Hercules is found and adopted by the farmers [[Amphitryon]] and [[Alcmene]].  Years later, the teenage Hercules becomes an outcast due to his strength, and wonders where he came from. After his foster parents reveal the necklace they found him with, Hercules decides to visit the temple of Zeus for answers. The temple's statue of Zeus comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can regain his godhood by becoming a true hero. Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten infant friend [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Pegasus|Pegasus]] to find the [[satyr]] [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Phil|Philoctetes]]—"Phil" for short—who is known for training heroes. They meet Phil, who has retired due to numerous disappointments, but Hercules inspires him to follow his dream to train a true hero that will be recognized by the gods. Phil trains Hercules into a potential hero, and then head towards [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]. On the way, they meet [[Megara (Disney)|Megara]]—"Meg" for short—a sarcastic damsel whom Hercules saves from the [[centaur]] [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]. After Hercules and the others leave, Meg is revealed to be Hades' minion, who sold her soul to him to save an unfaithful lover.  Arriving in Thebes, Hercules is turned down by the downtrodden citizens until Meg appears, saying that two boys have become trapped in a gorge. Hercules saves them, unaware that they are Pain and Panic in disguise, allowing Hades to summon the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]. Hercules defeats it and becomes a celebrated hero, but despite Hercules' growing fame and defeating every subsequent monster Hades unleashes, Zeus tells him he is not yet a "true" hero. Saddened and frustrated, Hercules turns to Meg, who is falling in love with him. Hades learns of this and on the eve of his takeover, he holds Meg hostage and offers her in exchange for Hercules surrendering his powers for a day. Hercules accepts on the condition that Meg will be unharmed and, after losing his strength, is heartbroken when Hades reveals that Meg was working for him.  Hades unleashes the Titans, who climb Olympus and capture the gods, while a [[Cyclops]] goes to Thebes to kill Hercules. Hercules defeats the cyclops; Meg then saves him from a falling pillar and is mortally injured. This breaks Hades' promise that Meg would not be harmed, and allows Hercules to regain his strength. Hercules and Pegasus fly to Olympus where they free the gods and vanquish the Titans, though Meg dies before he returns to her.   With Meg's soul now Hades' property, Hercules breaks into the Underworld and offers to free Meg from the [[Styx]] in exchange for his own life. His willingness to sacrifice himself restores his godhood and immortality before the life-draining river can kill him; he rescues Meg and punches Hades into the Styx, where irate souls pull him under. After reviving Meg, she and Hercules are summoned to Olympus, where Zeus and Hera welcome their son home. However, Hercules chooses to remain on Earth with Meg in lieu of living on Olympus. Hercules and his friends return to Thebes, where they watch Zeus etch Hercules' image into the stars to commemorate his heroism.

Meanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Mrs. Hess for shoveling snow, but she lectures him for scratching numerous itches. Alex returns home and removes his shirt to discover that he has chickenpox, and therefore, he must stay out of school. While recovering at home, Alex uses his telescope and discovers the thieves on look out for the chip.

While hanging on the stoop one afternoon with Illinois and his girlfriend Mary, Bumpy meets one of Mary's friends, Francine (Vanessa Williams). She and Illinois talk trash to each other, with her disapproving of the 'numbers' rackets Illinois is involved in and him defending it as the only way to make ends meet in the Depression. Bumpy introduces himself to her and is obviously interested. They meet again in a nightclub and dance together. Bumpy walks Francine home and they debate the effect of gambling in Harlem on its citizens. At her door, she says that he could do anything he wanted. He responds that he has written some poetry and then recites a poem to her, about her beautiful eyes.  Dutch Schultz asks to partner with the Queen, who declines the offer, as she disapproves of the violent tactics Schultz uses to terrorize her customers. Later a hit is ordered by Dutch on the Queen; however Whispers ([[Paul Benjamin]]) and Bumpy repel the attackers. Using his friendship with corrupt Captain Foley ([[Richard Bradford (actor)|Richard Bradford]]), of the New York City Police Department, Schultz arranges for the Queen to be arrested, and the Queen asks Johnson to take charge of the business during her incarceration. The Queen instructs Johnson to avoid bloodshed, but Schultz's men grow increasingly violent.  Bumpy and Dutch start a devastating war with each other. In one of Dutch's attempts on Bumpy's life, Dutch employs two big hit men. They break into Bumpy's home, killing two of his bodyguards and making their way up to the bedroom, where Bumpy and Francine are. They attack Bumpy and Francine in the bathroom. One of them is killed and the scene culminates in Francine having to shoot the other just as he is about to kill Bumpy. They hold each other on the floor of the bathroom, covered in blood. More and more people are killed, including the sixteen-year-old Tyrone, who begged Bumpy to let him become a numbers runner for him.  One afternoon, Bumpy and Francine are having a banana split in his favorite ice cream parlor. Bumpy notices in the nick of time that the split has almonds on it, which he never orders. Francine is already to dig in when Bumpy stops her. Suddenly, the tension mounts, Bumpy's men rush all the regular citizens out of the parlor and pull down the shades. After questioning the terrified owner, Bumpy finds out that it was the new boy, Jimmie, who made the split, which has been poisoned. Bumpy invites him over to the table where he asks him to eat the split. The kid makes all kinds of excuses and is also terrified. After more threatening, he confesses it was one of Bumpy's closest men, Vallie, who set Bumpy up. Bumpy sends Francine out of the parlor and forces the kid to eat the poisoned ice cream. Bumpy, Illinois, Whispers and two other of his men take Vallie to a private pool hall and question Vallie about the set-up. Vallie weeps, confessing it was all for the money and begs for his life. Bumpy notices a nice ring on Vallie's finger and asks him if he bought it with the money, which Vallie vehemently denies. Eventually, everyone walks out except Whispers, who cuts Vallie's throat with a straight razor.  Bumpy and his gang show up at the Cotton Club in downtown New York. This is in Dutch's territory and does not allow black people in except as entertainers. Dutch is holding court. The place goes silent as Bumpy tells Dutch that he knows all about his operation and if Dutch doesn't shut it down, Bumpy will do it for him. Dutch mentions Vallie and Bumpy replies that Vallie won't be able to comment anymore but left a souvenir for Dutch. He puts a handkerchief on the table that contains a bloody finger, with a fancy ring on it. It nearly comes to a shoot-out, with cooler heads holding Dutch. Bumpy and his gang leave. When Dutch continues terrorizing uptown Harlem, Bumpy engages an explosives expert to rig a bomb. He and Illinois manage to infiltrate one of Dutch's liquor warehouses as delivery boys and just manage to get away before the whole building explodes.  In the meantime, Dutch and his men have broken into Mary's house (Illinois' girlfriend). Dutch hits and threatens her, asking her where Illinois is. One of his right hand men, Bub (Clarence Williams III) says she doesn't know anything and he doesn't have to do this. Dutch tells him to toughen up. After blowing up the warehouse, Illinois makes his way back to Mary's to find her dead.  Bumpy arrives home where Francine tells him that she is leaving him. He is enraged and starts throwing the fancy dresses and jewels that he bought at her. She yells that she didn't want any of them and that she doesn't know him anymore, that he is no longer the good man with whom she had fallen in love.  Devastated by Mary's death, Illinois gets drunk and tells Bumpy that he's changed, that he is as bad as Dutch now. They have it out; Illinois says he's finished with Bumpy and staggers out. As he's walking down the street, Captain Foley and Bub Hewlett ([[Clarence Williams III]]) see him, kidnap him and chain him up in a machinery room. Foley beats him and wants to torture him for information. Hewlett says Illinois isn't going to talk and wants him let go. He leaves but Foley kills him using a corkscrew. Eager to end the war between each faction, Luciano decides to try and make the Schultz and Johnson come to an agreement, although neither wants to compromise.  Later that evening, word comes to the Johnson house that Illinois has been found murdered. Johnson and his gang go to the warehouse where Illinois was killed and find him hanging by a chain on the outside wall, one of the 'numbers' tickets in his mouth and a suitcase with "No More Secrets" written across it attached to him. A local witness tells them that he saw a man with Captain's bars with Illinois shortly before his murder. Bumpy immediately knows who it is and gets his revenge on Foley by cutting his throat after finding him in a room with a prostitute. As Bumpy is leaving, he sees Bub Hewlett and asks if he had a hand in Illinois's murder. He denies any involvement so Bumpy spares him and tells him that he now owes him.   Bumpy has a meeting with Bub and tells him that it's not in his best interest to continue working for Dutch. Bumpy later contacts Luciano and tells him that he wants to compromise. Luciano agrees to the terms and they devise a plan to kill Dutch. Cecil, Luciano's driver, appears to betray Luciano and Bumpy by telling Dutch what they are planning. Cecil, however, is being paid by Bumpy to do so. Believing he now has the upper hand, Dutch plans the murder of Luciano and Bumpy but fails to do so. Luciano and Bumpy's plan is revealed when Lulu ([[Ed O'Ross]]) (Dutch's right-hand man) follows Dutch into the restroom and shoots him three times. Dutch walks out of the restroom and down the stairs, sits down at a table and drops dead. Lulu walks outside, gets in Luciano's car and asks to be paid but instead, an associate of Luciano's shoots him dead and dumps his body on the sidewalk.   The last scene shows Bumpy asking Bub if those involved have been paid, with Bub saying yes. With the Queen back in business, Johnson tells Bub that he has some unfinished business and Bub says he's going to go get some sleep. The two shake hands and part company. Bumpy then walks across the street and enters the church to briefly pay his final respects to Illinois. The gospel choir sings "Amazing Grace" while he walks down the aisle, exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen. When he arrives at the coffin, he goes down on his knees with tears in his eyes, then turns and walks out. He takes off his hat and turns his face up to the pouring rain, letting it run down his face.

After Oliver suffers a series of mysterious physical injuries, which he vaguely blames on neighbourhood bullies, suspicions are raised by his father, a [[General practitioner|GP]], against Hannah's boyfriend, Frank.  While Martyn becomes firmly convinced Frank is abusing his son, Oliver keeps silent about the true source of his injuries, and Hannah refuses to believe Frank could be abusing her son. Martyn begins court proceedings to gain sole custody of Oliver, though his [[gay]] relationship with Tom Dixon is brought as evidence by Hannah's lawyer of the unsuitability of Martyn's home. Only after she catches Frank abusing Oliver does Hannah accept that her boyfriend is the source of Oliver's injuries, though she is swayed by Frank's pleas and agrees to remain quiet about the issue and promises Oliver that the abuse will end.  In the climactic scene, Oliver attacks Frank and is saved from a terrible beating by his father, Martyn, who instead receives Frank's wrath. As Frank's savagery is witnessed not only by Hannah, Oliver, and Tom, but also by Hannah's neighbours, who in turn call the police, the film ends with Hannah visiting Oliver, who now resides with his father, and asking him if he'd like to return to her home on occasion, now that Frank no longer lives with her.

The House of Yes
 On Thanksgiving Day, 1983, student Marty Pascal ([[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]]) brings his fiancée, Lesly ([[Tori Spelling]]), home to his family's [[McLean, Virginia]] estate to meet them for the first time. Marty is obviously nervous and hesitant about the impending introduction of his future wife to his family; he has informed them that he is bringing a guest but without any further details.  Marty's family prepares both for his arrival and for an impending hurricane. Marty's twin sister "Jackie-O" ([[Parker Posey]]), recently released from a [[psychiatric hospital]], is ecstatic about his arrival, until she is informed that a "friend" is accompanying Marty.  She becomes distressed and, over the course of the night, shows many signs that suggest she suffers from [[borderline personality disorder]], including sudden mood swings and an inability to cope with change.  Jackie has had a long obsession with the former first lady and the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]].  As an adult, Jackie-O still emulates the former first lady in her style of dress and her hairstyle. Throughout the movie we never learn her real name.   Jackie-O lives with her mother and her younger brother Anthony ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]).  He and the matriarch of the family, Mrs. Pascal ([[Geneviève Bujold]]) are very protective of Jackie.  Mrs. Pascal is immediately suspicious and guarded against her future daughter-in-law Lesly.   Meanwhile, Lesly is initially oblivious to the tumultuous nature of the family. It is clear that Marty is in love with Lesly's "normalcy" and their engagement is a way for him to break from his family mold.   As the hurricane outside intensifies, Marty and Lesly become stranded in the house until the storm lets up. After meeting Lesly, Jackie-O comes close to a melt-down at her bathroom sink, yet suddenly gains her composure and surprises Lesly. Jackie playfully interrogates Lesly about her love life with Marty, going so far as to ask for graphic details about their sexual escapades. Jackie-O informs Lesly of a nearby former girlfriend of Marty's, with whom he shared an intense affair in his youth and hints that there might be a "reunion" between the two former lovers.   It becomes clear that Marty's lover was in fact Jackie-O after she coerces Marty into playing their favorite childhood "game," a re-enactment of the [[JFK assassination]], a game that led to their first sexual encounter when they were 14. Jackie-O and Marty play the game, and after she has "shot" him, she runs over to cradle him in her arms. She begins to kiss him, and the two have sex. Lesly walks in on them and, horrified, runs back upstairs where Anthony, who previously tried to warn her of Marty and Jackie's sexual relationship, convinces Lesly that he is an insecure virgin dying of a [[brain tumor]], leading to a short and awkward sexual encounter.  In the morning, Lesly confronts the family about the events of the night before. Mrs. Pascal coerces Anthony to tell Marty that he slept with Lesly.  Meanwhile, Jackie-O searches the house for a gun that Marty had been ordered to hide by their mother, finding it in the bathroom.  She flushes Marty's car keys down the toilet and returns to the living room where Lesly confronts Jackie-O about her mental illness and incestuous relationship.    As Lesly runs to get their suitcases so she and Marty can leave, Jackie pulls the gun and asks Marty to play their game one last time, agreeing to let them leave afterward.  Anthony races to find her medication while Marty cautiously plays along. In tears, Jackie shoots and kills her brother. Lesly runs from the house.  In a voice over (found in some versions of the film, not in the version available on Netflix), Jackie explains that Marty was buried in the backyard "next to Daddy."

While driving along a coastal byway, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie's friend Max passes by them on the road. Julie reassures Max that everything is all right, and he leaves. After some arguing, the group decides to dispose of the body, dumping it in the water. They agree to never again discuss what had happened.  A year later, Julie returns home from her college in [[Boston]] for the summer. Since the incident, the friends have gone their separate ways. Julie receives a letter with no return address, stating, "I know what you did last summer!" Disturbed, Julie tracks down Helen, who has returned to Southport to work at her family's department store after a failed attempt at an acting career in New York City. The girls take the note to Barry, who immediately suspects Max. They confront Max on the docks, and Barry threatens him with a hook. Julie meets Ray, who is now working as a fisherman; he unsuccessfully tries to reconcile with her. Later, Max is killed by a figure in a [[raincoat|rain slicker]] wielding a hook. Barry discovers a note in his gym locker saying, "I know." He is then ambushed by the same assailant driving Barry's car.  Meanwhile, Julie researches newspaper articles which lead her to believe the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen and Julie go to visit with David's sister Missy at her home. Missy explains to them that their family was devastated by David's death; she also mentions that a friend of David's named Billy Blue also visited her to pay his last respects. Later that night, the killer sneaks into Helen's house, cuts off her hair while she sleeps, and writes "Soon" in lipstick on her vanity mirror.   The following morning, Julie finds Max's corpse wearing Barry's stolen jacket in the trunk of her car. When she calls the others, the body is missing. Julie, Helen, and Barry confront Ray about the recent events. Ray claims to have received a threatening letter as well. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen go to participate in the Fourth of July parade. Missy reveals David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend Susie in a car accident and shows David's suicide note to Julie. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie realizes it was not a suicide note, but a death threat.   At the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry being murdered on the balcony. She rushes upstairs with a police officer but finds no sign of the killer or Barry. A police officer escorts Helen home, but the killer lures him into an alley and murders him. Helen flees to her nearby family store, where her sister Elsa is closing for the night. The killer enters the store and murders Elsa. Helen is chased to the third floor of the building and escapes through a window, falling to a long alleyway. She manages to run toward the street, but the killer stops her and slashes her to death, her screams being drowned out by the sound of the oncoming parade.  Julie finds an article mentioning Susie's father, Ben Willis, and realizes that Ben was the man they ran over, moments after he had killed David to avenge his daughter. She then goes to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe her. Julie notices Ray's boat is called ''Billy Blue'' and runs away. Ben appears, knocking Ray unconscious, and invites Julie to hide on his boat. On the boat, she finds photos and articles about her friends and her, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, and he begins tormenting Julie, chasing her below deck; there, she uncovers the bodies of Helen and Barry in the boat's ice box. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie. He ultimately uses the [[rigging]] to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When the police question them, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anybody the previous summer, and reconcile.  A year later, Julie is in college in [[Boston]]. As she enters the shower, she notices the words "I still know" on the mirror. Moments later, a dark figure crashes through it.

Hurricane Streets
 14-year-old Marcus Frederick ([[Brendan Sexton III]]) resides in [[Lower East Side|Manhattan’s Lower East Side]] with his grandmother, Lucy ([[Lynn Cohen]]). His mother, Joanna ([[Edie Falco]]), has spent the last nine years of Marcus's life in prison for [[Illegal immigration|smuggling undocumented aliens]] into [[New Mexico]]. Presumably, Marcus’s father died in a car accident when Marcus was five.  Lucy owns and operates her own establishment called Lucy’s, where she works as a bartender, giving Marcus a lot of unsupervised time to spend  with his four friends Chip (David Roland Frank), Benny ([[Carlo Alban]]), Louis (Mtume Gant), and Harold (Antoine McLean). The group spends the majority of their time committing [[Shoplifting|petty theft]] and hanging around in their underground clubhouse near the waterfront. Chip has grown tired of the small-time crime and wants to move into more serious theft, such as [[robbery]].<ref></ref>   Marcus has aspirations to move back to his home state of New Mexico and live on a ranch with his uncle Billy who had promised to mail Marcus an airplane ticket. However, Lucy doesn't believe Billy was being serious.  Later that day, Marcus sells stolen merchandise to children during recess at the local elementary school while Chip serves as a lookout. There, Marcus meets 14-year-old Melena ([[Isidra Vega]]). Marcus invites Melena to his fifteenth birthday party, although she declines claiming her abusive father, Paco ([[Shawn Elliott]]), a tow truck driver, doesn’t approve of her staying out late.  That night, Melena sneaks out of her apartment and meets Marcus in front of the bar where she gives him her ski mask as a gift before leaving. The next morning, Marcus receives the flight ticket to New Mexico in the mail and relays this information to Lucy. Mack ([[L.M. Kit Carson]]), a regular patron at the bar, reveals to Lucy he actually sent Marcus the ticket (under the guise of Billy) believing it would do Marcus good if he left the city.   Marcus, Benny, and Louis are subsequently introduced to Justin (Damian Corrente) and Shane ([[David Moscow]]), Chip’s drug dealing friends from [[Miami]]. Marcus tells Melena about his plans to move to New Mexico and offers her to join him. Melena declines, knowing her father would never approve and not being able to afford the price of the ticket.  Afterwards, Marcus gets caught by a [[Undercover operation|plainclothes officer]] named Kramer ([[Jose Zuniga]]) after he continues to sell stolen merchandise to the elementary school children and is hauled off to the police station. Marcus is interrogated by Kramer and another detective named Hank (Richard Petrocelli) who threaten to charge him with [[Burglary|commercial burglary]] and inform him that his mother is in prison for [[murder]], not [[Illegal immigration|smuggling undocumented aliens]] like she had told him (it is implied  that Joanna killed his father.)  Marcus visits his mother and tells her about his meeting with Melena and the two of them planning to travel to New Mexico. Marcus then reveals that he knows she’s in prison for killing his father. Joanna explains that his father was abusive towards her and Marcus and didn’t know how to tell Marcus without him being upset. She also admits that she isn’t up for parole until another four years, but promises Marcus they will go to New Mexico once she is out. Marcus is clearly done with her promises and leaves.  Later, Marcus returns to the clubhouse where he is surprised by Mack who is a wanted [[fugitive]] hiding out from the police. Marcus sympathetically gives his ticket to Mack in hopes that it will help him with his dilemma. The following day, Marcus tells Melena and friends his decision to remain in [[New York (state)|New York]] in order to straighten his life out.   At the clubhouse, the group reveals to Marcus they plan on breaking into a policeman's (Leslie Body) apartment and stealing his valuables. Marcus refuses to get involved after his run-in with the police. Paco drives to the clubhouse’s location where Melena and Marcus congregate regularly. When Paco starts to get rough in disciplining Melena, Marcus intervenes before Paco shoves him into the lake and leaves with Melena. A vengeful Marcus rides his bicycle to Melena’s apartment building and coldcocks Paco.   Marcus and Melena leave and camp out in a tent for the day. They plan to meet at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] at noon the next day to catch the train after coming to a consensus that they will travel to New Mexico. In order to procure the amount of money it costs for the train fare, Marcus joins his friends in the robbery plot.   In the apartment, Harold finds and secretly steals the officer’s gun before the group departs and returns to the clubhouse. Meanwhile, in his search for Melena, Paco sneaks inside the clubhouse and looks around. When he hears the group approaching, he hides in the closet.   Chip insults Harold’s ability to play darts which results in Harold pulling out the stolen gun and shooting the target on the dartboard to show off. Unknowingly, Harold has shot and killed Paco (through the closet door the dart board was hanging on) whose corpse falls from the closet. Unable to lift the body, Marcus takes the keys to Paco’s [[tow truck]] from his pocket, and uses the crane on the tow truck to lift Paco and release him into a shallow grave. Harold feels guilty and Marcus fears that he may go to the police. He warns Benny to not let Harold talk before telling him he changed his mind and he is resuming his plans to go to [[New Mexico]], though promises he’ll return in two weeks.   On the day Marcus and Melena are supposed to leave for New Mexico, Marcus visits the ruins of a building where he keeps a hidden stash of cash, only to find that it’s missing along with the loot from the robbery. While Marcus is riding his bicycle downtown, he notices Chip showing off his brand new [[Diamondback Bicycles|Diamondback bicycle]] to a crowd of onlookers. Marcus punches him in the face, accusing Chip of stealing the [[robbery]] loot and his stash of cash to pay for the bike. Justin and Shane accost Marcus before Justin reveals he stole Marcus’s money. Justin, Shane, and Chip then mercilessly beat Marcus to the ground before leaving.   Immediately after, Marcus returns to the clubhouse and takes the gun before noticing an unmarked car and police cruiser pull up and it’s revealed that Benny had reported Paco’s murder to the police. Meanwhile, two police officers question Lucy on Marcus’s whereabouts. Soon after, Chip is arrested by the police.   Running out of time and desperate for cash, Marcus [[Armed robbery|enters a convenience store and holds the cashier, Duane, at gunpoint]]. Duane ([[Terry Alexander (actor)|Terry Alexander]]) hands over the cash and Marcus promises to pay him back. Marcus races to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] where he reunites with Melena. The two board the train and Melena, not knowing her father is dead, remarks that her dad is going to kill her when he finds out she ran away. Marcus, knowing full well Paco won’t be able to anything of the sort, doesn’t respond.

The Hunchback (1997 film)
 In 1480 [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[Dom (title)|Dom]] Claude Frollo finds an abandoned, deformed baby boy on the steps of Notre Dame and takes pity on him, believing him to be sent by God. He names the baby "Quasimodo", and raises him as his son.  Twenty-five years later, on the day of the Feast of Fools, Quasimodo is named the King of Fools by Clopin, the King of the [[Romani people|Gypsies]]. A young Gypsy woman named Esmeralda honors Quasimodo with a dance. Both Frollo and Gringoire, a wandering poet, see her dancing, and both are entranced by her. Frollo stops the dance, and scolds Quasimodo for leaving Notre Dame, telling him that if he ever goes outside the cathedral again, Frollo will not help him.  Frollo, after [[self-flagellation|whipping]] himself for his lustful thoughts towards Esmeralda, pays two guards to kidnap her. They attempt to take her by force, but their plan is thwarted by Gringoire and Quasimodo, who protect her. Gringoire ultimately is nearly hanged by the Gypsies for trespassing on the Court of Miracles, but Esmeralda says she will marry him in return for rescuing her.  Angered by Quasimodo's disobedience, Frollo allows Quasimodo to be whipped for attacking Esmeralda, even though he is innocent. Esmeralda begs [[King Louis XII of France|King Louis]] to stop the torture, but the King regards her as not a "real woman", and refuses to listen to her. Quasimodo is left for public humiliation for one hour, during which the crowd throws fruit at him. Quasimodo begs the crowd for water. Instead of helping him, they mock him further by shouting, "Water", back at him. Frollo ignores Quasimodo's pleas for help. Esmeralda later gives Quasimodo some water. As a result, he becomes deeply infatuated with her. When he comes back to Notre Dame, he falls to the floor as he cries while Frollo consoles him.  Esmeralda and Gringoire's sham marriage eventually grows into real love. A jealous Frollo disguises himself and reveals to Esmerelda the depths of his feelings to her. Esmeralda reads his palm and sees death. Terrified, she runs away, dropping her knife. Frollo takes the knife and stabs a minister with it, believing the man to be a sinner for reading books other than the Bible.  Esmeralda is tried for the murder and found guilty. Frollo tells her that he will spare her if she gives herself to him, but she refuses. Quasimodo saves her from being hanged and publicly declares sanctuary.  Esmeralda stays in Notre Dame, and she and Quasimodo become close friends. He introduces her to the bells of Notre Dame, and tells her of his plans to write a 600-page book. Esmeralda confesses that she misses her goat, Djali, so Quasimodo goes to the Court of Miracles to retrieve the goat. He gives his book to Gringoire to distribute to the citizens of Paris.  When he returns, Esmeralda has gone. He confronts Frollo, who admits that he turned Esmeralda over to the authorities. Frollo severely whips Quasimodo, and curses him as a freak. He then attempts to whip Quasimodo once more, but Quasimodo finally stands up for himself.  Esmeralda is about to be hanged once more, but the Gypsies rebel against the higher classes and demand that she be set free. Quasimodo, hanging Frollo over the edge of a balcony on Notre Dame, forces him to confess to the crime. Frollo does so, believing he has gained absolution for his sins. Esmeralda is freed and goes to Notre Dame to thank Quasimodo. However, Frollo attacks Esmeralda, and accidentally stabs Quasimodo when he comes to her defense. The pair fight, resulting in Frollo falling over the edge of Notre Dame to his death. Quasimodo nearly suffers the same fate, until Esmeralda and Gringoire help him. Quasimodo tells Esmeralda that the pain is too much, but when she attempts to tend his wounds he reveals that the biggest wound lies in his heart. Gringoire and Esmeralda ring the bells of Notre Dame in tribute to Quasimodo as he peacefully dies.

In & Out (film)
 Howard Brackett ([[Kevin Kline]]) is a well-liked [[English literature]] teacher, living a quiet life in the fictional town of Greenleaf, [[Indiana]], with his [[fiancée]] and fellow teacher Emily Montgomery ([[Joan Cusack]]), who recently lost 75 pounds. The town is filled with anticipation over the nomination of Howard's former student Cameron Drake ([[Matt Dillon]]) in the [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] category at the [[Academy Awards]] for his portrayal of a gay soldier in ''To Serve and Protect''. Cameron does indeed win the award and, in his acceptance speech, thanks Howard, adding, ". . . and he's gay."  Howard's family, friends, students, co-workers and Emily are shocked; but that is nothing compared to Howard's own reaction of disbelief and indignation. He angrily reassures those who know him that he is [[heterosexual]]. Reporters invade his hometown, harassing him for interviews, following the awards night telecast. Howard is placed under the scrutiny of his boss, Principal Tom Halliwell ([[Bob Newhart]]), who is uncomfortable with the attention being brought to the school.  Although the other reporters leave after getting their story, one stays behind: on-camera entertainment reporter Peter Malloy ([[Tom Selleck]]), who wants to wait the week out so he can cover Howard's wedding to Emily. Howard continues to be harassed and dismayed by the changed attitudes of everyone around him, and decides that he must sleep with Emily in order to prove his heterosexuality. Howard finds he cannot go through with it due to his conflicting emotions and Emily's concern for his well-being. Howard crosses paths with Peter, who reveals he is gay and, trying to provide a helpful ear, narrates his own experience in coming out to his family. Howard insists that he is not gay, prompting Peter to kiss him. Although shocked, Howard reacts somewhat positively to the kiss.  Howard's final measure to restore his heterosexuality is the use of a self-help [[audio cassette]], although that fails as well. During the wedding ceremony, Emily recites her vow without hesitation, but when Howard is prompted by the minister, he instead says, "I'm gay." The wedding is called off, and although Peter is proud of Howard, Howard is angry with himself for hurting Emily. Howard is fired from the school because of his outing.  Despite no longer being on the faculty, Howard attends the graduation ceremony to support his students. When one student who got into college—thanks to Howard's hard work—learns that he was dismissed for being gay, he and his classmates proclaim themselves to be gay as well, showing their support. Howard's family follows suit, as do his friends, and all the townsfolk assembled. Having learned of the ensuing media blitz while in [[Los Angeles]], Cameron flies to his hometown with his supermodel girlfriend ([[Shalom Harlow]]) to support his former teacher. Although Howard does not win "Teacher of the Year", Cameron presents him with his Oscar.  Howard's wedding-crazy mother ([[Debbie Reynolds]]) finally gets a wedding—her own, when she and her husband ([[Wilford Brimley]]) renew their vows. Howard, Peter and the rest of the townsfolk attend the reception. Among the crowd are Emily and Cameron, who appear to have begun a relationship. Everyone dances to the [[Village People]]'s song "[[Macho Man (song)|Macho Man]]".  
In the Company of Men
 Chad and Howard are two middle management employees at a corporation, temporarily assigned to a branch office away from home for six weeks. Howard is assigned to head up the project. Embittered by bad experiences with women, Chad and Howard form a mean-spirited revenge scheme to find an insecure woman, romance her simultaneously, and then break up with her at the same time. Chad, who is cruel, manipulative, duplicitous, misanthropic, misogynist and abusive to his subordinates, is the originator and driving force behind the scheme, while Howard is the more passive of the two, which leads to a later conflict with the scheme.  Chad decides upon Christine, a deaf coworker who is so [[self-consciousness|self-conscious]] that she wears headphones so people, thinking that she is listening to music, are compelled to get her attention visually without immediately learning that she is deaf. Chad and Howard decide to each ask her out, and over the course of several weeks, date her simultaneously.  In the meantime, things with the project go wrong; a fax Chad is supposed to have made to the home office is "lost" and a presentation Chad is supposed to deliver to the home office is unable to be carried out successfully after some documents are allegedly printed so lightly that they are illegible. These mishaps culminate in Howard being demoted and Chad taking his place as the head of the project after Chad places the blame for the mishaps unfairly on Howard. Chad eventually sleeps with Christine, and she falls in love with him. When Christine eventually breaks this news to Howard, Howard tells Christine the truth about their scheme, and tells her that he loves her. Christine is shocked by the revelation, and refuses to believe that Chad would do this. When she confronts Chad, he admits the truth. Christine angrily slaps Chad, but Chad is unashamed of his behavior, and cruelly taunts Christine, who collapses into tears after he leaves her.  Weeks later, Howard confronts Chad back home at his apartment. Howard is now apparently in the bad graces of the company, having been moved to a lower floor, while Chad is doing well, and thus offering to say something on Howard's behalf. Nevertheless, Howard is not worried about work; he confesses to Chad that he really loved Christine. At this point Chad, despite having previously told Howard that his girlfriend, Suzanne, had left him, shows Howard that she is still there, asleep in his bed. Chad says that he carried out the plan "because I could," and cruelly asks Howard how it feels to have truly hurt someone. Howard, who had never done anything like that before, leaves, horrified.  Howard later travels back to the city and to a bank where he sees Christine working there, and tries to speak to her, but she looks away in anger. He loudly pleads with her to "listen" to him, but his pleas literally fall on deaf ears.

The Ice Storm (film)
 Set over Thanksgiving weekend, 1973, the film centers around two families: the Hoods (Ben and Elena and their children, Paul and Wendy) and their neighbors, the Carvers (Jim and Janey, and their children, Mikey and Sandy).  Ben, dissatisfied in his marriage and with the futility of his career, is having an affair with Janey. Elena is bored with her life and is looking to expand her thinking but is unsure of how to do so. Wendy enjoys sexual games with her school peers, as well as both Carver boys. Paul has fallen for a classmate, Libbets, at the boarding school he attends, though his roommate Francis is also interested in her.  On the Friday night after Thanksgiving, Ben and Elena have an argument when she learns of his affair with Janey, but they go ahead with their plans to attend a neighborhood party, which turns out to be a "[[Group sex#Keyparty|key party]]", where married couples swap sexual partners by having wives select other husbands' keys from a bowl; Jim and Janey are also there.  As the party progresses, Ben becomes drunk. When Janey chooses the keys of a handsome young man, Ben attempts to protest but trips and knocks his head on the coffee table, leading Jim to realize that his wife and Ben are having an affair. Ben, in his embarrassment, retreats to the bathroom where he remains for the rest of the evening. The remaining key party participants are paired off and leave together with only Jim and Elena remaining. She retrieves Jim's keys from the bowl and returns them to him. After debating the issue, Jim and Elena leave together, engaging in a quick, clumsy sexual encounter in the front seat of Jim's car. Jim, regretting the line he and Elena have just crossed, offers to drive her home.  Wendy decides to make her way to the Carvers' to see Mikey, but he has decided to go out into the ice storm, so she and Sandy climb into bed together and remove their clothes. They drink from a bottle of vodka and Wendy tries to seduce him, but they both fall asleep.  Paul is invited to Libbets' apartment in Manhattan, though upon arriving, is disappointed to learn that Francis was also invited. The three drink beer and listen to music; Francis and Libbets also take prescription pills found in Libbets' mother's medicine cabinet, causing them to eventually pass out. Paul decides to leave, just narrowly making the train to New Canaan.  Meanwhile, Mikey, out walking in the storm, is enchanted by the beauty of the trees and fields covered in ice. He slides down an icy hill then sits on a guardrail to rest. A moment later a power line, broken by a fallen tree, connects with the guardrail and he is electrocuted.  Jim and Elena become stuck, due to a downed tree, and return to the Carvers' house as dawn is breaking. Elena walks in on her daughter in bed with Sandy and orders her to get dressed. Janey returns home and curls up on her bed in the fetal position without bothering to take off her party clothes.  Ben has sobered up by this time and begins driving home. He discovers Mikey's body on the side of the road and carries it back to the Carvers' house. The two families are drawn together by Mikey's death and Wendy hugs the shocked and numbed Sandy in an attempt to comfort him. Jim is devastated while Janey remains asleep and oblivious to the recent events. Ben, Elena, and Wendy then drive to the train station to pick up Paul, whose train was delayed by the ice and the power failure caused by the downed wire. Once all four are together in the car, Ben breaks down, sobbing uncontrollably at the wheel as Elena comforts him.  
I Went Down
  After serving an eight-month sentence for [[burglary|breaking and entering]], Git Hynes, ([[Peter McDonald (actor)|Peter McDonald]]) walks into trouble on the day of his release from jail.  He goes to meet his ex-girlfriend Sabrina Bradley, (Antoine Byrne), who has dumped him for his best friend Anto ([[David Wilmot (actor)|David Wilmot]]). When Git goes to confront Anto about this, he learns that the latter's [[gambling addiction]] has left him heavily in debt to the [[Bookmaker|bookies]], who are about to take his fingers as collateral. Git jumps in and saves his friend from a beating, but uses a broken bottle to permanently disfigure the ringleader, who happens to be the nephew of [[Boss (crime)|mob boss]], Tom French ([[Tony Doyle (actor)|Tony Doyle]]).  At a [[meeting|sit-down]], Tom French decrees that Git must work off Anto's debt as punishment for his interference. He is ordered to drive to [[Cork (city)|Cork]] to find French's associate Frank Grogan ([[Peter Caffrey]]), and bring him back to [[Dublin]]. Holding Anto as a [[hostage]], French pairs the reluctant Git with half-wit and heavy-handed mobster, Bunny Kelly ([[Brendan Gleeson]]).  After [[robbery|robbing]] a [[Filling station|petrol station]] and dumping their stolen car, Bunny and Git steal another car and continue on their journey. They drive the extremely old and decrepit car to a remote [[bog]] area, where they are to rendezvous with a so-called "Friendly Face". However, they arrive late, and the "Friendly Face" has left. With no other option, the duo drive to Cork. They check out the last known hotel that Grogan was registered in, only to find that he has already left.  Following a tip, they then drive to The Black & Amber Inn, a [[pub]] that Grogan is known to frequent. However, Git is attacked by some mobsters who break his nose. Bunny painfully re-sets Git's nose for him. Returning at night to the pub, they follow the mobsters to a secluded house in the middle of a forest. After surveying the house, Bunny and Git conclude that Frank Grogan is being [[Kidnapping|held against his will]] by the mobsters and they decide to rescue him.  The following morning, Bunny provides Git with a [[Revolver|pistol]]. The two then enter the house, find Grogan, and flee the scene. They engage in a gunfight with the mobsters. During the escape, Grogan demands to know where he is being taken. When he is informed that he is being taken to Tom French, he reacts in horror and attempts to flee. Grogan is then knocked unconscious by Bunny and bundled into the boot of the stolen car.  After phoning Tom French's associates, Bunny and Git are informed that the "Friendly Face" will be at the bogs again the following day, and they can pass Grogan over there. Bunny and Git then release Grogan from the boot. They drive along, heading back towards the rendezvous with the "Friendly Face". Grogan's incessant and self-aggrandizing chatter deeply irritates Bunny, who eventually abandons the car and steals a far newer and more plush [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]].  After arriving at the rendezvous point, Bunny refuses to leave the car. Grogan and Git walk across the marshes to get to the barn to meet the "Friendly Face" (Donal O'Kelly). Grogan, afraid he will be killed, begs Git not to leave him alone. Git agrees. At the rendezvous, Grogan does not recognise the man and is fearful for his life. Git refuses to leave Grogan alone with the stranger. The "Friendly Face" then pulls a gun on the two and forces them to kneel on a tarp, preparing to execute them both. Grogan, eager to save his own skin, offers the "Friendly Face" [[Irish pound|£]]50,000 in exchange for his release. Grogan also instructs the "Friendly Face" to kill Git, who has no money to offer. Before the "Friendly Face" can kill Git, Bunny arrives and holds the "Friendly Face" at gunpoint and saves Git. After stuffing the "Friendly Face" into the boot of his own car, Git and Bunny drag Grogan back to the Mercedes, and begin to interrogate him for the truth.  Grogan reveals that he and Tom French were once business partners, along with a man named Sonny Mulligan (Johnny Murphy). Grogan reveals that he once came into possession of one side of a [[Offset printing|plate]] to [[Counterfeit money|print]] [[United States dollar|$]] [[United States twenty-dollar bill|20-dollar bills]]. Without the other half, it was useless. French later comes into possession of the other side of the plates. Eager to get both plates, French offers Grogan £5,000 for his half. Grogan refuses, instead opting to sell his half for £10,000 to a criminal from London. French, however, counter-offers. He has found a buyer for both plates, the buyer offering £100,000. French agrees to a 50–50 deal with Grogan, and offers him £25,000 up-front as good-faith money. French's wife is to deliver this money. However, the deal fell through as French's wife never shows up.  Phoning French again, a meeting is arranged for the following day. Anto will be released and the deal will be closed.  The trio check into a nearby hotel, The Ambassador. Bunny and Git tie Grogan to the bed in the room, so they can go and enjoy the swimming pool and the bar of the hotel in peace. Both Bunny and Git have [[One-night stand]]s with women they meet in the hotel. Git reveals to his partner through [[Pillow talk|pillow-talk]] that he took the fall for his father and went to prison so his father could go free.  When Bunny and Git return to the hotel room, they find that Grogan has escaped. Before leaving, Grogan made three phone calls; one to a Cork number, one to a [[Taxicab|taxi]] company, and one to the nearby Slieve na Vogue Hotel. Bunny and Git head to the Slieve na Vogue. Grogan has checked into the Slieve na Vogue under a false name, but Bunny recognises his deception. Grogan's associates from Cork arrive soon after, forcing Bunny and Git to flee again, with Frank in the boot of the car.  The trio then head for the rendezvous with Tom French. Leaving Grogan with Bunny, Git and French head into the woods to dig up a package. The package contains one of the printing plates. French, Git, Grogan, and Bunny then head to another area of the woods, where French instructs them to dig another area. It is here that the [[skeleton|skeletal remains]] of their former associate, Sonny Mulligan, is uncovered.  French and Grogan then reveal what happened all those years ago. Sonny had "borrowed" the plates from an American [[Organized crime|criminal gang]], on the condition that he would not print more than $50,000. This was to be Sonny's retirement money. French married Sonny's niece (and Grogan proceeded to have an [[Extramarital sex|extramarital affair]] with her). French wanted Sonny to print more than the agreed $50,000. But Sonny refused and the pair had a blazing argument at French's wedding.  Grogan and French decide to steal the plates from Sonny, print their own batch of counterfeit money, and then return the plates to their hiding place without Sonny ever knowing. Sonny, however, always kept one of the plates in his possession at all times. French spied on Sonny and saw where he had buried the other plate. Grogan murdered Sonny in the woods to get the other plate. Burying Sonny in the woods, Grogan and French narrowly avoid being killed by Sonny's relatives and by the American gang who want their plates back. The situation is further soured when French learns of the affair Grogan is having with his wife. They then part and never speak again.  Back in the present, Grogan insults the memory of Sonny Mulligan. It is revealed that French's wife has absconded, with the £25,000 of French's money. Infuriated, French uses a gun that was buried with Sonny to shoot Grogan twice in the chest, killing him. French then turns his attention to Bunny and Git. French shoots Bunny in the arm, before Git uses his own gun to shoot French twice, killing him. Bunny and Git then bury Grogan and French, alongside the remains of Sonny Mulligan. The duo then leave, taking the plates with them.  Several months later, Bunny meets with Git's ex-girlfriend, Sabrina, in a [[Billiard hall|pool hall]] and gives her an envelope with several thousand pounds in it; a gift from Git. Bunny claims that Git has left and gone to [[United States of America|America]]. Bunny states his intentions to also head to the United States. When Sabrina raises the possibility that Git had something to do with Tom French's disappearance, Bunny denies it and states that French pulled an [[Insurance fraud|insurance scam]] and [[:wikt:abscond|fled the country]].  It is then revealed that Git is waiting outside the pool hall for Bunny. After a short conversation, Bunny and Git head to the [[Dublin Airport|airport]].  
Insomnia (1997 film)
  When 17-year-old Tanja is found murdered in the city of [[Tromsø]], far up in the Norwegian Arctic, [[National Criminal Investigation Service (Norway)|Kripos]] police officers Jonas Engström ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]) and Erik Vik ([[Sverre Anker Ousdal]]) are called in to investigate. Engström is a police inspector formerly with the [[Swedish police]] who moved to Norway after being caught having sex with the main witness in one of his cases. Vik is nearing retirement age, and his memory is failing.  Engström devises a plan to lure the murderer back to the scene of the crime, but the stakeout is blown and the murder suspect flees into the fog. Events take a turn for the worse when the fugitive shoots one of the pursuing unarmed Norwegian police officers. Without telling his colleagues, however, Engström carries a gun from his days in the Swedish police, who routinely carry firearms. While shooting at what he believes to be the suspect, Engstrom accidentally kills Vik, who had mistakenly run right instead of left as ordered.   Engström initially tells the truth about the shooting, but realizes that everyone assumes that the fugitive shot Vik. He decides to conceal his culpability. When one of his colleagues, Hilde Hagen ([[Gisken Armand]]), is assigned to investigate Vik's death, Engström becomes worried about [[ballistic fingerprinting]] and tampers with evidence to support his story. Haunted by guilt and unable to sleep with the [[midnight sun]] of the Arctic, Engström becomes increasingly unhinged and starts hallucinating about Vik. Things become even worse when he learns that Tanja's murderer saw him shoot Vik.  Engström learns from one of Tanja's friends that she had been seeing Jon Holt ([[Bjørn Floberg]]), a crime novelist. He correctly deduces that Holt killed Tanja, but Holt [[blackmail]]s Engström with his knowledge of the Vik shooting. The two meet and decide to frame Tanja's boyfriend Eilert for her murder, with Engström later planting Holt's gun under Eilert's bed. However, Hagen is not convinced of Eilert's involvement, and when new evidence emerges, Engström knows that it's only a matter of time until Holt is arrested.  Engström tracks down Holt in some rotting wooden buildings at the waterfront and tries to talk with him. Holt suspects that Engström has come to kill him and holds him at gunpoint. He explains how he killed Tanja in a fit of rage when she rejected his advances. Holt tries to flee across a pier, but the rotten floorboards give way and he falls into the water below, striking his head on the way. He drowns as Engström watches. When he rummages through Holt's nearby house, Engström finds Tanja's dress, which Holt had removed before dumping the body. With Holt dead, and this definitive proof that he was the murderer, the case is closed.  Just before he leaves town, Engström is visited by Hagen, who shows him a [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge case]] found at the site where Vik was shot. She notes that it is a [[Norma (company)|Norma]] case, which Engström confirms is a brand used by the Swedish police. Engström expects Hagen to arrest him, but instead she simply places the cartridge case on a table and leaves. Engström drives out of town, his face and eyes showing great weariness; he seems not to have recovered from his insomnia.

Incognito (1998 film)
 Talented New York painter Harry Donovan is an expert of copying famous artists' paintings, but is struggling to become a legitimate artist in his own right. Until now, he has avoided detection by forging third and fourth tier masters, but that is about to change. Frustrated by the cancellation of an exhibition of his paintings, Harry accepts a job forging a long lost [[Rembrandt]] for $550,000 from three art dealer clients—Alistair Davies (Thomas Lockyer), Ian Hill, and Agachi—against the wishes of his artist father who wants his son to give up forgery and concentrate on his own work.   Despite his father's wishes, Harry takes the job and travels to [[Amsterdam]] to study Rembrandt. He decides to forge a never-discovered portrait of the master's blind father lost supposedly off the coast of Spain over 350 years ago. Harry continues his research in Paris, where he meets a beautiful Rembrandt scholar, Professor Marieke van den Broeck, who tells him she is a "student". Harry does not know that one of his main source books was written by Marieke. With her unwitting help, he gains access to an actual Rembrandt being restored at the [[Louvre]] from which he obtains scrapings of the original varnish. Soon Harry and Marieke become involved romantically.   Harry travels back to Amsterdam, where he paints his "Rembrandt" in an attic studio using period materials and a photograph of his own father as a model. He then journeys to Spain where he shows his three clients his forged masterpiece. After they find a local farmer who is paid to claim to have "found" the painting, the three clients invite two art experts to examine the painting, and they "confirm" it to be a Rembrandt. They return to London with the painting for a final authentication by a group of experts, which includes Marieke, to Harry's surprise. Several experts agree it is genuine, but Marieke does not. Dismayed to learn that his clients plan to hold a public auction, Harry tries to take back his painting but Davies pulls a modified [[Beretta 92|Beretta]] handgun on him. Harry manages to evade his line of fire and makes his escape with the painting while Davies shoots and kills Agachi and frames Harry for the murder and the theft of the painting.   After eluding arrest, Harry finds Marieke, handcuffs her to his wrist, and together they escape on the [[Orient Express]]. Forced to flee the train by the pursuing police, they make their way through the English countryside, eventually splitting up before Harry is finally arrested while attempting to destroy his forgery at [[Mentmore Towers]].     During his trial Harry tries to prove his innocence by duplicating the painting in open court to show that the painting is fake. His feelings, however, over his father's recent death and his wish for him to give up forgery prevent him from completing the painting. "Only Rembrandt can paint a Rembrandt," he concludes. Harry is saved when Hill, fearing his partner's homicidal intentions, testifies that Davies was actually the one who murdered Agachi, An enraged Davies is put in contempt and Harry is cleared of all charges.   After his release, Harry discovers that Hill plans to auction the painting himself and reap all the financial benefits. Having anticipated such an outcome, Harry had written a letter to the farmer in Spain notifying him of the deception. Spanish law allows the government first right of purchase from the discoverer of all treasures found on Spanish soil. The painting ends up in the [[Museo del Prado]] and the $55,000,000 that the painting was sold for end up in Spain. Of this money two thirds are taken by the Spanish government, half of the remaining sum is taken by the Church, and what is left is given to the farmer. In gratitude, the farmer invites Harry to Spain where he gives the artist half of the money—$5 million. Harry then travels back to Paris to meet Marieke. He gives her an original portrait that he painted of her in his own style. After signing the painting, the couple kiss and embrace on the romantic banks of the [[Seine]].

Because of a misunderstanding of the circumstances surrounding his father's death (a supposed bet with Abbott that took the elder Holt's life), Jacey ([[Billy Crudup]]) seeks revenge on the Abbotts through the calculated seduction of the Abbott daughters. At first, Jacey cannot wait to escape the suffocating life in Haley, later in the film, however, he is pulled back as he idolizes the Abbott family, as well as obsesses about the oldest daughter, Alice ([[Joanna Going]]), thus seeking to jockey his way into the Abbott family.  At first, Doug ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), the younger brother, admires and worships his brother's libertine lifestyle. However, as he matures, he discovers that all that glitters is not gold.

Iruvar
 Set in the 1950s, the film begins with Anandan ([[Mohanlal]]), a struggling actor, seeking opportunities which will give him a big break in the film industry. Under his uncle's help, Anandan is given an opportunity to [[audition]] for the lead role in a forthcoming film. He arrives in the studio and practices his combat skills with sword props provided on the sets while waiting for the director and the crew. At this, he meets Tamizhselvan ([[Prakash Raj]]), a small-time writer who enters the studio with some sarcastic poetry and this prompts both into a little debate. The debate turns into a mutual respect into each other, and impressed by Tamizhselvan's skills, Anandan requests Tamizhselvan to write dialogues for him to recite during the audition.  With the help of Tamizhselvan's dialogues, Anandan floors the director during the audition and is hired as the hero of the film. Anandan's friendship with Tamizhselvan grows as a result, and Anandan is introduced to Tamizhselvan's political party which is led by Ayya Veluthambi ([[Nassar]]). He grows to the party's [[ideology]] as time passes by. Anandan then marries a village belle Pushpavalli ([[Aishwarya Rai]]) while Tamizhselvan marries another village girl, Maragatham ([[Revathy]]) under the supervision of the party leader. When Anandan returns to [[Madras]], he is greeted by the bad news that the production of the film has been cancelled due to financial difficulties. As Tamizhselvan jubilates at his party's victory, a depressed Anandan is forced to return to old ways of playing [[Extra (actor)|extras]] in the movies. He even loses motivation and doesn't act some parts out well, causing further demotion in his roles. Anandan also sends Pushpa back to her village due to his financial difficulties. At one of the shootings, Anandan is greeted by his mother and uncle with the news that Pushpa has died due to a freak accident in her house. Tamizhselvan travels down to console a grief-stricken Anandan of his wife's death.  A few days later, Anandan's assistant Nambi ([[Delhi Ganesh]]) informs him that he has been called up for an audition of the same director's new project (the director who hired him for the stalled movie). Anandan is elated and calls up Tamizhselvan, who abandons his pregnant wife while she is giving birth to rush to aid Anandan. He writes dialogues for Anandan once again and the movie starts rolling. Anandan is paired with a rising actress Ramani ([[Gautami]]) for the film. The film receives tremendous response upon release and becomes a huge success, propelling Anandan into fame. At this time, Tamizhselvan encourages Anandan to use his popularity to help the party gain attention. While shooting for his next venture, Anandan and Ramani have some romantic brushes, which causes Ramani's uncle ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]), who lusts over her, to beat her up. Ramani comes to Anandan seeking refuge, and Anandan marries her. At this juncture, the party starts to contest in elections. Before elections, Ayya Veluthambi gives Anandan an important mantle in the party, and a seat to contest, much to the displeasure of Tamizhselvan, who thinks Anandan is just a film star, and is not exactly passionate about the party.  But before the election, during a fine shoot, Anandan is shot in neck by a freak accident. The party sweeps elections with 152/234 with both Anandan and Tamizhselvan winning from their respective constituencies as new MLAs by huge margins. Ayya Veluthambi denies the CM post, and Tamizhselvan is made CM, worth full support of Anandan, but from then Tamizhselvan starts to see Anandan as a threat to his chair. He, however, keeps Anandan only as a party [[spokesperson]] and doesn't provide him a cabinet position. Anandan asks Tamizhselvan for the health minister position, as he is an MLA, which Tamizhselvan refuses, by saying that the executive committee forbids him to do so. That's because a minister cannot pursue cinema while in Office and Anandan has to give up any one. During the return car trip with fellow members, Anandan's aides start breeding hatred by Anandan on Tamizhselvan, saying that Tamizhselvan purposely did not include Anandan in the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. An infuriated Anandan chases the flamers away from his car, but has doubts in his mind nevertheless.  That time, Ayya Veluthambi dies and Tamilselvan becomes supreme leader of the party, with help of Anandan. Tamizhselvan is later shown to have an extramarital affair with Senthamarai ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), a village girl who loves literature, whom he first met while fighting for his party's causes before the party became successful. He marries her as his second wife subsequently. Meanwhile, Anandan, after his marriage with Ramani, calls up a new actress to audition to be his next heroine (it was a [[norm (sociology)|norm]] for an actor to work with same actress repeatedly during those days). The actress Kalpana ([[Aishwarya Rai]] again) resembles the late Pushpa, making Anandan uncomfortable. Ramani however insists that the actress is very talented and should be hired. Their association starts and the open nature of Kalpana's approach towards him makes Anandan more uncomfortable. Anandan finally reveals the truth about Pushpa, and this sparks off an affair between Anandan and Kalpana. In an ensuing party function held to pay tribute to Ayya Veluthambi, Anandan creates controversy by revealing some inside truths of discomfort within the party, prompting Tamizhselvan to sack him from the party. Anandan retaliates by forming his own party to stand in the election. His party priorities see him distancing himself from Kalpana, to whom he has promised to marry. An infuriated Kalpana walks out and starts doing social work.  Anandan's heavy star power enables him to win the next general election with 145/234 seats, as he had used his films to spread his political propaganda. As he becomes the new chief minister, a key MLA madhivanan jumps from Tamizhselvan's party to Anandan's party, in the belief that Anandan's reign will see less dirty politics, and is made the finance minister. This sparks off a cat and mouse game as Tamizhselvan and Anandan start devising tactics to outdo each other. This includes Anandan having to order Tamizhselvan's arrest after some riots broke out. It slowly dawns that Anandan's reign is no different from Tamizhselvan's and the deputy points out that the same corruption exists in Anandan's reign, to which Anandan says it's the nature of politics. Anandan meets Kalpana again while she is doing [[social work]] after a while, and sends Minister Nambi to bring her back. While in the car, Kalpana, Nambi, and his driver all meet with a fatal accident.  A distraught Anandan loses motivation after that as life begins to dawn upon him. Tamizhselvan, who just gets released from jail, also slows down in his tactics to dethrone Anandan as age catches up with both of them. During the wedding of Ayya Veluthambi's granddaughter, Anandan and Tamizhselvan meet each other and share a gracious handshake. The wedding takes place in the same place where they first met, prompting some memories and sly smiles from both of them. At the conclusion of the wedding, Anandan loses his footing and falls. The next morning, Ramani tries in vain to wake up Anandan, but he had died in his sleep.  Tamizhselvan receives the news that Anandan has died. Initially he thinks that as a rumour but later is proved true. He attends the funeral but is unable to see the body as it is being dressed for the funeral parade. Realizing that people there will always assume him as an enemy of Anandan, he heads back to the place they first met and in an emotional [[monologue]], recites poetry mourning his friend's death which depicts the depth of their friendship. The film ends as Anandan's body is paraded across the streets, mourned by a legion of film fans and politicians, finally coming to the [[crematorium]] and being [[cremation|cremated]].

Intensity (film)
 Chyna Shepherd accompanies her friend Laura Templeton to her house for [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. A [[serial killer]] named Edgler Vess invades the house and kills Laura and her parents, as Chyna hides in the killer's vehicle. When Vess stops at a gas station, Chyna escapes and asks the two attendants to call the police.  Before she has time to explain, Vess returns and murders the two workers with a [[shotgun]].  Chyna then learns that he is holding a 14-year-old girl named Ariel hostage in his basement.  She becomes determined to save Ariel and follows Vess back to his home. On the road she runs into a woman named Miriam and asks her to call the police.  The woman does not realize that Chyna is serious about the murders until she sees the two dead bodies back at the gas station.  Unfortunately, she is hysterical on the phone with the police, telling them that they 'need to save Chyna and Ariel,' which the police interpret as the ramblings of a lunatic. Upon trying to fall back to sleep, the policeman, Ethan Trevaine, remembers the name Ariel from a missing person's case and starts investigating. Trevaine starts to find clues on what type of vehicle the killer was driving, and what Miriam was talking about earlier.  Meanwhile, the car Chyna is driving runs out of gas so she leaves it in the middle of the road, forcing Vess to stop and push it out of the way. While he does so, Chyna runs back into his [[Mobile home|trailer]] and hides, unknowingly leaving foot prints. Intrigued, Vess decides to have some fun and pretend he does not know she is there. He then kills Miriam when she tries to run him off the road and save Chyna. When they arrive at his home, Chyna attempts to free Ariel from a fortified room but is attacked and subdued by Vess. As a captive, Chyna speaks with Vess and has flashbacks to her traumatic childhood: as a little girl, she witnessed her disturbed, abusive mother and her boyfriend kill her grandparents. In turn, Vess reveals his obsession with the "intensity" of any particular experience and declares his intention to kill both her and Ariel, but offers Chyna a slightly more merciful death if she agrees to aid him in mentally torturing Ariel out of her catatonia.  When Vess finally leaves for work, Chyna seizes the opportunity to free herself and Ariel. After dressing in Vess's dog-training gear and spraying ammonia in the eyes of his bloodthirsty Dobermans, Chyna attempts to flee with Ariel in Vess's mobile home, but unwittingly triggers an alarm that causes him to return home early.  Before they can make their escape, an unmarked vehicle and a police car arrive.  Although Chyna believes Vess to be in the unmarked vehicle driven by Trevaine, it is revealed that Vess is actually a State Trooper who emerges from the police car and opens fire on Trevaine, killing him before turning his attention to the mobile home. Chyna and Ariel manage to escape back to Vess's house, where Chyna ultimately gets the better of Vess. She sets him on fire, locks him in Ariel's old room, and watches as he burns to death.  In the aftermath, Chyna visits Ariel in a psychiatric hospital but is denied custody of her in a hearing; she is told that the young girl will require extensive therapy to recover from her trauma. As Chyna prepares to leave without her, Ariel, speaking for the first time, suddenly calls out to her the name "Badger", a character from a story Chyna had told her about to help bring her courage while escaping from Vess.  The two embrace, and it is implied that Chyna's custody of Ariel was granted.

Into Thin Air: Death on Everest
 The film portrays the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]] and the events that preceded it. The film mainly follows [[Jon Krakauer]], the author of the book on which the film is based (''[[Into Thin Air]]: A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster'' (1997)); it also follows the climbing teams of summit guides [[Rob Hall]] and [[Scott Fischer]].  The film begins with Krakauer giving a monologue about the events about the disaster. The guides, Rob Hall (Nat Parker), and Scott Fischer (Peter Horton) introduce themselves, their teams, and discuss with the clients how they intend to reach the summit by the set date. Hall's group contains Doug Hansen, a mailman from Seattle, Krakauer, Yasuko Namba, and several others. Fischer's group contains a New York socialite, Sandy Pittman, who will perform what Krakauer does for Hall's group, reporting and bring attention. At base camp, Hall speaks with his pregnant wife Jan, in New Zealand, about potential names for their daughter. The groups slowly make their way through camps 2, 3, and 4, and then begin their ascent for the summit. However, in camp 2, Fischer is forced to go all the way back down, so he can take a sick client, Dale Cruz, down for help. Scott refuses help, and returns exhausted and out of breath.  The ascent begins well, with both groups making steady pace. However, upon reaching the bottom of the Hillary step, they realize that there are no fixed ropes. The Sherpa there states it's a two-person job, and the other Sherpa never arrived, mostly due to being too tired and sick from dragging Pittman and all of her heavy equipment all the way up. Mountain Madness guides Anatoli Boukreev and Neil Beidelman set the fixed ropes, but by then dozens of climbers had already reached the step, and now a large jam is at the bottom. Krakauer continues up, and reaches the summit with Anatoli Boukreev, where shortly afterward they are joined by Adventure Consultants guide Andy Harris. Krakauer begins his descent, but reaches the step only the find the jam has only gotten worse, and is forced to wait it out. Meanwhile, Hall is forced to tell client Doug Hansen that they have to turn around and go back. Hansen refuses, as he failed to reach the summit the year before, and he knows he won't be able to afford a third attempt. Hall and Hansen argue before Hall finally caves in and they continue, missing Hall's 2:00 PM turnaround time. Finally, the path down the step clears and Harris begins to descend; Krakauer meanwhile begins to hallucinate from a lack of oxygen. Earlier he had asked Harris to decrease his oxygen flow, but Harris instead increased it, and Krakauer nearly falls over the side, but manages to catch himself. He makes his way down the step and to Harris, and realizes something is wrong with Harris, who thinks the completely full bottles at the oxygen drop are empty. As he descends, he runs into Hansen and Hall, and points out to Hansen that storm clouds are making their way up through the valley and up the mountain.  Shortly after 3 PM, the majority of Hall's and Fischer's groups finally reach the summit. As Krakauer continues his descent, he runs into Scott Fischer, who is completely exhausted and refuses to turn around. Shortly after 4 PM, Rob Hall and Doug Hansen finally reach the summit, where Hall remarks to Hansen that a storm is coming. As he continues to go down, and the weather starts to get bad, Krakauer runs into Beck Weathers, sitting alone by himself in snow. Weathers had eye surgery performed prior to the trip, and has lost vision in his eyes during the summit ascent. He declines to leave with Krakauer, explaining he had promised Rob Hall that he would wait for him to go down. At 4:30, Fischer and his Sherpa, Lopsang, finally reach the summit where Scott feels ill and collapses. Around 5, Krakauer finally reaches the tents at camp 4, where he goes to sleep. The weather continues to worsen, and later, Beidelman, Mike Groom, and the majority of both teams' clients stop to rest, where they run into Beck Weathers, who agrees to descend with them. Storm clouds and thick snowfall cause the guides to lose their positions and not know where they need to go. Higher on the mountain,  Hall and Hansen watch as Scott Fischer is dragged by them, so weak he can no longer stand.  Night falls, and Krakauer is awoken in his tent by Rob's Sherpa, Angdorjee, who informs him that the storm is getting increasingly worse, and that Rob and majority of the clients have yet to return. The pair make an attempt to find them, but quickly turn back when they realize the conditions are too treacherous. Meanwhile, Rob attempts to convince Doug to stand up and continue descending, but Doug begs Rob to leave him, telling Rob he will die if he attempts to save him. Rob refuses to leave him behind, and they continue. Scott, suffering from edema, walks off the side of the mountain, and is only saved when his Sherpa pulls him back up with their connected short rope. Scott then begins to fall into unconsciousness, and Lopsang radios for help. Rob continues to struggle down with Doug. In the darkness, Rob slips and falls down, and becomes separated from a hallucinating Doug. He then watches helplessly as Doug, too far away to help, tumbles over the side to his death. Rob is then found by Andy, who attempts to help him up. Andy then leaves, telling Rob he is going to get help. Despite Rob's plea's, Andy continues to go. Andy disappears from view. Rob then hears him cry out, and crawls forward to find Andy's hat lying next to a large drop off, and assumes that Andy has fallen to his death. Rob, buried under snow, communicates with Krakauer attempting to get direction on where he can find oxygen. He gets direction, but then falls down again, and begins to moan. The oxygen bottles are then revealed to be less than twenty feet away from him, but he doesn't see them. Beidelman and Groom's group becomes hopelessly lost, and they take only the clients who can walk with them, dropping Yasuko, Beck, Sandy Pittman, and Charlotte Fox. Scott continues to drift in and out of consciousness, only muttering the words "I am invincible" to his Sherpa, before again losing consciousness. Anatoli Boukreev appears, and helps down Charlotte Fox and Pittman, but is unable to get a third client. Rob begins to hallucinate about seeing his wife Jan, but then snaps outs of it, to realize he is still stuck. He also begins to realize that his hands and his legs are getting extremely frostbitten, and he is having trouble moving. He then blacks out again.  Rob then awakens the next morning, to realize that he is still alive, but barely. He radios the camp, who put him onto the radio with his wife Jan. He asks her if Sarah would be an appropriate name for their daughter, and she agrees. They both tell each other they love them, and then Rob says goodbye to his wife. He dies shortly afterward from hypothermia. Beck Weathers then wakes up, somehow having survived being buried under the snow with no oxygen. Still blinded, he stumbles back to camp, where he receives help. Meanwhile, Anatoli climbs up, and finds the now frozen corpse of Scott Fischer. He says goodbye, and after pulling Fischer's backpack over his face, he leaves. Back at base camp the survivors reminisce about the friends that they have lost.

Jackie Brown
 Jackie Brown is a flight attendant for a small Mexican airline. To make ends meet, she smuggles money from Mexico into the United States for Ordell Robbie, a black-market gun runner living in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] under the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]]'s close watch, forcing him to use [[couriers]]. Ordell learns that another of his couriers, Beaumont Livingston, has been arrested. Assuming that Livingston will become an informant in order to avoid jail time, Ordell arranges for bail with [[Bail bondsman|bondsman]] Max Cherry, then coaxes Livingston into a car trunk and murders him.  Acting on information Livingston had already shared, ATF agent Ray Nicolette and [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective Mark Dargus intercept Jackie as she returns to the United States with Ordell's cash and some [[cocaine]] that Brown was unaware was stashed in her bag. Initially refusing to cut a deal, she is sent to jail which alerts Ordell that she might also be a threat to inform. Having received payment from Ordell, Max picks up Jackie from the jail and begins to develop an attraction to her. Ordell arrives at Jackie's house intending to murder her but she surprises him by pulling a gun surreptitiously taken from the glove compartment of Max's car. Jackie negotiates a deal with Ordell to pretend to help the authorities while smuggling in $550,000 of Ordell's money, enough to allow him to retire.  To carry out this plan, Ordell is counting on Melanie Ralston, an unambitious, pot-smoking surfer girl with whom he lives, and Louis Gara, a friend and former cellmate. Unaware of Jackie and Ordell's plan to smuggle in $550,000, Nicolette and Dargus devise a sting to catch Ordell during a transfer of $50,000. Unbeknownst to all, Jackie plans to double-cross everyone and keep $500,000 for herself. She recruits Max to assist with her plan and offers him a cut.  In the [[Del Amo Fashion Center|Del Amo Mall]] on the day of the transfer, Jackie enters a dressing room to try on a new suit. She has told Ordell that she will swap bags there with Melanie, supposedly passing off the $550,000 under the nose of Nicolette, who has been told that the exchange is to take place in the food court. Instead, the bag she gives Melanie contains only $50,000 and she leaves the rest behind in the dressing room for Max to pick up. Jackie then feigns despair as she calls Nicolette and Dargus out from hiding, claiming Melanie took all the money and ran.  In the parking lot, Melanie mocks Louis until he loses his temper and shoots and kills her. Louis confesses this to Ordell. Ordell is livid when he discovers that most of the money is gone, and he realizes that Jackie is to blame. When Louis mentions that during the hand-off he saw Max Cherry in the store's dress department and thought nothing of it, Ordell kills Louis and leaves with the bag. Ordell turns his anger toward Max, who informs him that Jackie is frightened for her life and is waiting in Max's office to hand over the money. A menacing Ordell holds Max at gunpoint as they enter the darkened office. Jackie suddenly yells that Ordell has a gun, and Nicolette jumps from a hiding place and kills him.  With the ATF dropping charges for her cooperation, Jackie takes the remainder of Ordell's  money and his car. She decides to leave the country and travel to [[Madrid]], Spain. She invites Max to go along with her, but he declines. Jackie shares a meaningful moment with Max, kisses him goodbye, and leaves as Max takes a phone call. Moments later, Max cuts the call short and seems to contemplate his decision to stay behind as Jackie drives away.  
The Jackal (1997 film)
 A joint mission of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|MVD]] leads to the death of the younger brother of an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] mobster. In retaliation, the mobster hires an assassin known only as the "[[Jackal (The Day of the Jackal)|Jackal]]" to kill an unidentified target. The Jackal demands $70 million for the job, to which the mobster agrees. Meanwhile, the MVD capture one of the mafia's henchmen. During interrogation, the henchman reveals the name "Jackal". This, coupled with documents recovered from his briefcase, leads the FBI and MVD to assume the target for the retaliatory hit is FBI Director Donald Brown.  As the Jackal begins his preparations for the assassination—utilising a series of disguises and stolen IDs in the process—the FBI learns of one person who can identify him. FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston and Russian Police Major Valentina Koslova turn to a former [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] sniper named Declan Mulqueen, who had a relationship with an [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] militant named Isabella Zancona, who they believe can identify The Jackal. Mulqueen eventually agrees to help in exchange for their best efforts to get him released from prison.  It later transpires that Mulqueen has a personal motive for hunting the Jackal: the assassin wounded Zancona while she was pregnant with Mulqueen's child, causing a miscarriage. Zancona provides information that can help identify the Jackal, including the fact that he is American and that he had served in the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S military]] and was stationed at [[El Salvador]]. Meanwhile, the Jackal arrives in [[Montreal]] to pick up the weapon he intends to use and hires gunsmith Ian Lamont to design and build a mount for it. Underestimating the threat represented by the assassin, Lamont demands more money and is killed by the Jackal. The FBI discovers Lamont's remains and, with Mulqueen's help, deduce that the Jackal intends to utilize a long range heavy machine gun.  With the help of a Russian mole in the FBI, the Jackal realizes that he is being tracked by Mulqueen with assistance from Zancona, and he infiltrates Zancona's house after receiving an FBI access code from his insider. Instead of Zancona, however, he finds Koslova and Agents Witherspoon and McMurphy. He kills the agents and mortally wounds Koslova. The Jackal says that Mulqueen "can't protect his women," which she repeats to Mulqueen as she dies.  As the Jackal makes his final preparations, Mulqueen realizes that his target is not Brown, but the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], who is due to give a major public speech. The Jackal plans to shoot the First Lady via remote control. Arriving just in time, Mulqueen successfully sabotages the Jackal's weapon, while Preston absorbs a bullet meant for the First Lady. After a cat-and-mouse chase through the subway tunnels, Mulqueen and Zancona shoot the assassin dead.  A few days later, Preston and Mulqueen stand as the only witnesses to the Jackal's burial in an unmarked grave. Preston reveals that he is going back to Russia to pursue the mobsters who hired the Jackal. It is revealed that Mulqueen's request to be released was denied, but that he will likely be moved to a minimum security prison. Preston's heroics in saving the First Lady have made him a hero in the FBI. Knowing his current clout will prevent any real backlash against him, Preston turns his back on Mulqueen, allowing him to go free.  
Jack Frost (1997 film)
 On a snowy December night, a state execution transfer vehicle crosses into the quiet backwater town of Snowmonton. Inside is serial killer Jack Frost ([[Scott MacDonald (actor)|Scott MacDonald]]), who eluded police for years and left a trail of thirty-eight bodies across eleven states before finally being arrested by Sam Tiler ([[Christopher Allport]]), the sheriff of Snowmonton. Jack is scheduled to be executed at midnight, but Jack kills the guard and the vehicle crashes into a genetic research truck. Jack is exposed to chemicals from inside the truck, causing him to melt into and fuse with the snow.  Despite news reports of Jack's demise, Sam cannot forget Jack's threats of vengeance. Old Man Harper is found murdered, and soon afterwards a local bully named Billy (Nathan Hague) is killed when he is pushed into the way of an oncoming sled, getting decapitated. According to Tiler’s son, Ryan (Zack Eginton) a snowman caused the deaths. Billy's parents Jake (Jack Lindine) and Sally (Kelly Jean Peters) are later murdered by the same snowman.  FBI Agents Manners (Stephen Mendel) and Stone arrive in Snowmonton and convince the Sheriff to put the town on 24-hour curfew, sending his officers out to gather all the townspeople. Deputy Chris Pullman (Brian Leckner) is killed when Jack Frost runs the officer over with a police cruiser. Billy's older sister Jill ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]) and her boyfriend sneak into the sheriff's home to steal his wine and have sex, as revenge for her family’s death. The snowman kills Jill's boyfriend and pretends to be bath water to lure in Jill, solidifying around her, raping her to death.  Jack Frost returns with the police cruiser to the station, finally confronting Sam. Agent Stone reveals himself to be a representative of the genetic research company that created the chemicals and reveals that the snowman is a mutated Jack Frost. He also reveals that the human soul exists as a chemical and that the acid was going to be used to contain DNA in case of a nuclear holocaust. They attempt to destroy Jack by blowing him up by releasing aerosol cans in the police station and firing a bullet at him, but to no avail. They then use blowdryers to drive Jack into a furnace, which evaporates the snowman. Jack condenses, killing Stone and wounding Manners. Jack traps Tiler and Ryan within his car, but Tiler escapes by inadvertently throwing the oatmeal Ryan made him at Jack, burning the snowman's head. Ryan put [[antifreeze (engine)|antifreeze]] in the oatmeal, believing it could help keep his father from getting cold.  Sheriff Tiler tells his friend, Paul Davrow ([[F. William Parker]]) to fill the bed of his truck with antifreeze. Jack chases Sam through the halls of a church and finally catches him, driving an icicle into his chest and almost killing him. The truck full of antifreeze arrives just in time, however, and Jack and Sam crash through a window and into the truck's bed. Jack Frost melts in the antifreeze, and the antifreeze is poured back into the containers, and buried deep under the ground of Snowmonton. Tiler's wife Anne (Eileen Seeley), realizes that the state police are on their way. When Paul asks Tiler what they are going to tell them, Tiler says, "we'll tell them that it's too late". However, one of the containers is shown to be bubbling, revealing Jack is still alive.

When this doesn't work, they try to get Raja and Kajal killed. When the children realize what their fathers really did, they refuse to back down, their determination set in stone.  Eventually, the parents play a nasty trick. They make the four lovers believe that they have changed their ways and are ready for their children to marry the person they wish to. On the way to Raja and Madhu's engagement ceremony, the fathers have Kajal kidnapped. Raja saves her from being raped and comforts her. Meanwhile, without their knowledge, photos are taken of them. The fathers then show the photos of Raja comforting Kajal at the party. Taken out of context, the photos make it look like Raja and Kajal are being intimate with each other. Raja and Kajal are willing to prove their innocence, but the fathers keep them away. To make matters worse, Kajal's uncle ([[Mohan Joshi]]) falsely testifies to the fabricated illicit affair between the two. In fact, Kajal's uncle was paid to lie to Ajay and Madhu.  Ajay and Madhu break up with Kajal and Raja, and the fathers' plan to create a rift between Ajay and Raja, once the best of friends, succeeds. The situation worsens further when Ajay and Madhu think that Kajal is pregnant with Raja's child. They tell Raja and Kajal that they are getting married, which is what their fathers wanted all along.

Ajay and Madhu's wedding is about to start when Ajay's uncle ([[Johny Lever]]) shows them pictures of Ajay comforting Madhu after Ajay seemingly had saved Madhu from Raja's supposed attack, taken out of context. This proves that Raja had attacked them to recreate the situation he and Kajal had been in, which in turn proved that Raja and Kajal are innocent and that the fathers were behind the initial attack on Kajal. Further proving Raja and Kajal's innocence, Kajal's uncle also confesses that he lied out of bribery. Angry and heartbroken, Ajay almost chokes his father to death but his conscience stops him. He then tries to kill himself but Madhu stops him. Ajay and Madhu rush to the shipyard and succeed to stop Raja and Kajal from leaving the country on the ship. They ask for forgiveness and the lovers get back together. The fathers arrive, having realized their grave mistake, and also ask for forgiveness. The lovers forgive them and they sing and dance to a song.

An equally drunken Sloan overhears and spreads the story. A panic ensues, with the local newspaper printing the story and commissioning testing of the water supply. Mark, the son of the publisher, objects to his father, but because Mark is himself struggling with his homosexuality and attending meetings of an [[ex-gay movement|ex-gay group]] at the local church, he's limited in what he can do to mitigate the story and the resultant damage. The leader of the ex-gay group, Brother Daniel, announces plans to protest for the closing of Hope House.  Alex and Grace renew their friendship and Grace comes out as a [[lesbian]] to her. Grace returned to Azalea Springs because her husband found out about an affair she was having with another woman and is now in prison for assaulting Grace.  At an ex-gay meeting, Mark meets Tomas, a painter. Mark hires Tomas to re-paint his dining room.  The Junior League decides not to continue volunteering at Hope House. Alex, who's resigned from the League, goes to work full-time at the hospice over her husband Robert's objections.  Alex develops some curiosity about her possible lesbianism and rents a number of classic lesbian-themed films: ''[[Desert Hearts]]''; ''[[Lianna]]''; ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]''; ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''; ''[[Bar Girls]]''; ''[[Claire of the Moon]]''; ''[[The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love]]''; an unnamed, presumably [[pornography|pornographic]] video; and, mixed in among them, ''[[The Godfather Part III]],'' which serves as mainstream cover for the other selections and elicits a bemused look from the counter clerk, who has been loudly reading out the titles.  At Hope House, Alex gives in to her growing attraction to Grace and they kiss passionately in a supply room. Sloan catches them and spreads the story all over town. After Tomas paints Mark's dining room, they go out on a dinner date, where Mark learns that Tomas stumbled into the ex-gay meeting by mistake. After dinner they go to Tomas's studio and Tomas shows Mark his paintings. They make love. Reaction is immediate and hostile, with Alex suffering indignities great and small, everything from the breakup of her marriage to the closing of her credit account at the local fried pie shop.  Following this, Mark gains the courage to break up with the woman he's been dating as a "beard" and to come out to his father. He demands that his father drop the story on the water supply (testing proves that the water is completely ordinary) and stop the negative coverage of Hope House.  Mark and Tomas and Alex and Grace go out dancing at a big-city gay club, where they see Ray Ray, the son of Alex's family housekeeper, performing as a [[drag queen]] called Obsession. Ray Ray leads Mark and Tomas to a leather bar where they catch ex-gay leader Brother Daniel in full leather gear (Mark has a photo published in the paper to discredit Brother Daniel's anti-Hope House protests). Meanwhile, Alex and Grace go to a hotel room where they make love for the first time.  Back in Azalea Springs, Spencer's lover Bruce dies of AIDS-related complications. At his funeral, Alex's father comforts her and her mother, while still upset over Alex's lesbianism, shows that she still loves her daughter (by insulting her shoes, something she's done repeatedly through the film).

Raaj does not have an air-conditioner, a car, not even a refrigerator. This infuriates Kajal, and in her mind she creates a separate world, where she is rich, wealthy, has several cars, and lives lavishly in a big bungalow. Even the birth of two children (a young son and a little daughter) and several years of marriage do not change her. An example of this occurs when Kajal meets her old friend Nisha ([[Poonam Dhillon]]), who Kajal feeds a pack of lies that her husband is a business magnate, her family owns several cars and lives in a big bungalow, but Nisha, who is actually wealthy, offers to give her a lift. Kajal lies about where she lives and is exposed when the bungalow she points out as her own turns out to be Nisha's. She tells Kajal not to take her life or her husband for granted and that no matter how little you have, your house is your home. When Jahnvi ([[Urmila Matondkar]]) Raaj's boss Sahni's ([[Saeed Jaffrey]]) niece comes from overseas, she meets Raj at the airport and assumes he is the car driver. After she is rude to him, he leaves her stranded on the road with her luggage, not caring what his boss would say. Jahnvi reaches the office well in time and praises Raj's attitude, but when she learns that he's an engineer working for her uncle's construction company, she apologises to him. Sahni introduces Jahnvi to Vikram Khanna, a handsome young guy, who is his business partner. Vikram observes Jahnvi and likes the young, naturally vivacious girl. One day, Vikram and Jahnvi go to see Jahnvi's guest house, at the new property. Sahni gets worried as the weather is getting bad; and they have not returned to the office. As Raj is about to leave, Sahni asks him to check on them and bring Jahnvi back, while Vikram has been drinking and casually discusses the prospect of marriage. But Jahnvi rejects his advances. Vikram grabs her but Jahnvi slaps him. Angered by the slap, Vikram throws her on the bed and forcibly tries to get intimate with her. But Raj arrives in the nick of time and saves Jahnvi.

She starts liking Raj from that moment and falls in love with him thereafter. When she learns that he is a married man, she is adamant on getting married to Raj.   She first meets Kajal buy accident, at a shop where they are both going to buy a cassette player for Raj. Not knowing Kajal is Raj's wife, she offers Kajal the money to buy a more expensive set if she can buy the smaller cassette (which is also the last one in the shop). Kajal agrees and the family listen to the tape Jahnvi had given, where she confesses her love. In an attempt to marry Raj, Jahnvi meets the greedy Kajal inside the city's Ganesh temple, she offers two crore rupees in exchange for marriage to Raj. Then Kajal, seeing this as her opportunity to gain wealth and an easy life, she suddenly accepts her proposal.  Kajal forces Raaj into the agreement and gets a reluctant Raj and Jahnvi married and divorces Raj herself, to comply with the Hindu Marriage Act; thinking that she and Jahnvi will happily live together and share Raj.  She then uses the money she got in the bargain to buy a huge mansion and cars. The bungalow she buys ends up being that of Nisha. She briefly returns to her old home to collect a picture of her husband. Kajal then proceeds to taunt her that she has fulfilled her dreams, whereas Nisha's dreams are now shattered having lost everything. Nisha reminds Kajal that she sold her house and possessions to pay for the treatment of her ill husband, whereas Kajal has sold her husband for riches; and that to some extent, Kajal is all the poorer for that. Kajal moulds herself into a socialite and this leads to Kajal neglecting her family. Raj initially feels rejected by Kajal and does not get close to Jahnvi, feeling objectified at the thought of being bought and sold between his two wives. But the children and Raj find companionship with Jahnvi, who showers them with love and affection. She changes herself and becomes a typical middle class type Indian housewife. She gets up early, does pooja and then cooks tasty food for her family. She does not mind tiring herself all day learning new dishes and rituals as she finds solace in this quiet, peaceful life.   She even travels happily in crowded buses and autos so as to make Raaj and the kids feel secure and happy around her. She abandons all the luxury and comforts she grew up with. The children call Jahnvi "Maa", something that Kajal would previously reprimand her children for calling her; insisting that they call her "Mummy" as this sounded high society.  Now  Kajal realises how far she has drifted from her family. She forgets her wedding anniversary and throws a birthday party for her daughter's birthday, not realising that Raj has never been attracted to a lavish lifestyle and thus further pushing him away from her and towards Jahnvi. After frequent reminders from her mother, Kajal tries to make amends. When nothing works, Kajal shocks her husband when she slaps Jahnvi and accuses her of stealing her husband and tries to make Jahnvi leave. Kajal offers Jahnvi all her money back in exchange for Raj again, only to be told by Raj that she is the poorest relation despite having all the riches she ever dreamed of. On advice of her friend, Kajal seeks legal advice which also states that the only way she can legally marry Raj if  he and Jahnvi divorce&nbsp;– an impossible task. She then forcibly tries to throw Jahnvi out of the house, but to no avail, as Raj decides to leave with Jahnvi claiming that in the present circumstances, this is the fairest thing to do. The kids decide to stay with Janhvi and their father&nbsp;– heartbroken as they learn that their father was sold, prompting the son to ask Kajal about the prospect of them being sold to another family at an agreed price.  Kajal on the other hand, disraught by her family abandoning her, donates all her riches, in order to pay her dues. When she learns that Raj and the kids are leaving for the US, she runs to the airport for one final visit. She finds them ready to depart. But at the last minute, Jahnvi turns to Raj and tells them that she is leaving for the US alone, but she is not literally alone. She is expecting Raj's child. Jahnvi accepts that although Kajal sold her husband, it was her who offered to buy him and thus she too should pay her dues. So, the movie ends with Kajal getting her family back, learning of the importance of family over money and Jahnvi leaving for New York forever.

He dreams of finding a perfect woman will love him for who he is, despite his father's insistence that he lower his standards.  When two women from a tour ask Harold where they can see Hollywood stars, he directs them to a trendy Hollywood cafe where his best friend, Danny (Sams), is a bartender. Harold goes to meet them and overhears a conversation in which a man hits on a woman by telling her that he is a writer represented by Arthur Blake (Shawn). Harold then spots up-and-coming actress Amanda Clark (Fenn) arguing with her agent, Sidney Stone (Williams). Danny encourages Harold to ask Amanda for an autograph. She greets him warmly and asks what he does. He lies and tells her that he is a writer represented by Arthur Blake. Amanda asks for his feedback on a screenplay for a movie she is cast in.  Danny encourages Harold to pursue Amanda romantically, even though she has a movie-star boyfriend, Rich Adams (Costas Mandylor). Harold meets with Amanda to discuss the script and is the only person who sees the same problems with the screenplay that she sees. Amanda takes Harold to a party filled with stars and elites so they can confront Sidney with Harold's opinion of the script. After Sidney dismisses them both, Amanda catches Rich with another woman.  Harold and Sidney set out to stop Harold's budding relationship with Amanda before it embarrasses them both. Meanwhile, Harold's father decides to set him up with an "interesting-looking" psychic named Lulu (Yeardley Smith).   After escaping from Lulu, Harold takes Amanda on a date to a local fair. At the end of their date, Amanda tells Harold that she's arranged for him to rewrite the screenplay, telling Harold that Sidney will call Arther Blake the next day to finalize the details and set the pay. Harold tries to tell Amanda the truth about himself, but can't bring himself to. The next morning, Harold sneaks into Arthur Blake's office and explains the whole situation. Arthur Blake advises Harold to "just write". Despite knowing nothing about writing, Harold buys a stack of books on screenwriting and dedicates himself to rewriting the screenplay.

When they arrive and meet Adler's wife Bel (Jennifer Cluff), Al acknowledges the apparent wisdom of Nikki's instinct to trust Adler.  The next morning Nikki discovers Adler and Bel dead in their beds, their throats cut. Al appears and knocks Nikki out. Evidently he has decided Nikki must be committing the murders - only semi-consciously in her sleep - and ties her up at a safe-house. It is here that the police finally catch up with the couple. However, after a night in a cell a strange lawyer turns up and organises bail. He drives the bemused lovers to a motel where he instructs them to wait. Suddenly Zipper Doyle appears and forces them at gun-point to get into his car.  By now the police have discovered Doyle's participation in a pedophilia ring and are pursuing him as well as Nikki & Al. When Doyle sees a road-block he begins issuing commands to Nikki who is in the driver's seat. Nikki ignores him and drives straight into the road-block. Doyle is killed in the crash, the lovers are only wounded. In a concluding [[voice-over]] Nikki explains who was responsible for the murders on the road and how they got off for the death of the patent-attorney (always wipe your prints and only target pedophiles).

L.A. Confidential (film)
 In early 1950s Los Angeles, Sergeant Edmund "Ed" Exley, son of the legendary LAPD detective Preston Exley, is determined to live up to his father's reputation. His intelligence, insistence on following regulations, and cold demeanor contribute to his isolation from other officers. He exacerbates this resentment by volunteering to testify in the "Bloody Christmas" case against his fellow officers in exchange for a promotion to Detective Lieutenant. This goes against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith, who says that a detective should be willing to shoot a guilty man in the back for the greater good. Exley's ambition is fueled by the murder of his father, killed by an unknown assailant, whom Exley nicknames "Rollo Tomasi".  Officer Wendell "Bud" White, whom Exley considers a "mindless thug", is a plainclothes officer obsessed with violently punishing woman-beaters. One such incident leads him to confront a former cop named Leland "Buzz" Meeks, a driver for Pierce Patchett, operator of Fleur-de-Lis. His call girl service runs prostitutes who are altered by plastic surgery to resemble film stars. White comes to dislike Exley after White's partner, Dick Stensland, is fired due to Exley's testimony in the "Bloody Christmas" scandal. Smith wants White to torture the out-of-town criminal element who attempt to gain a foothold in Los Angeles when gangster [[Mickey Cohen]] is imprisoned for tax evasion. The "Nite Owl case", a multiple homicide at a coffee shop, becomes personal to the police after Stensland is found to be one of the victims.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical advisor on ''Badge of Honor'', a popular TV police drama series. He is also providing Sid Hudgens, publisher of the ''Hush-Hush'' tabloid magazine, with tips about celebrity arrests that will attract more readers to Hudgens' magazine. When Vincennes  becomes involved in Hudgens' scheme to set up actor Matt Reynolds in a homosexual tryst with L.A. district attorney Ellis Loew, and Reynolds is killed, Vincennes becomes determined to find the killer.  Three African Americans are initially charged with the Nite Owl murders; they are later killed in a shootout. Although the Nite Owl crime initially looks like a botched robbery, Exley and White individually investigate it to discover indications of corruption all around them. White recognizes Nite Owl victim Susan Lefferts as one of Meeks' escorts which leads him back to Pierce Patchett. He begins a relationship with Lynn Bracken, a [[Veronica Lake]] look-alike prostitute. The body count rises when White searches the crawl space under Lefferts' mother's house, and finds the decomposed corpse of Meeks.  When Vincennes approaches Smith with the evidence he has found with Exley, Smith realizes his scheme to take over Mickey Cohen's heroin empire is threatened. Smith shoots Vincennes, who utters "Rollo Tomasi" before dying, the origin of which Exley told Vincennes in confidence. Exley's suspicions are aroused when Smith asks him who Rollo Tomasi is. During an interrogation of Hudgens, Smith arranges for White to see photos of Bracken sleeping with Exley, which sends White into a rage. Confident that White has gone after Exley to kill him, Smith kills Hudgens. Exley investigates and discovers Meeks and Stensland used to work closely with Smith. White drives to the police station and begins to fight Exley, but Exley is able to convince White that Smith is corrupt and has set them both up. The two decide to team together to take down Smith. They are able to obtain evidence against Smith by threatening Loew, and later find Patchett murdered. Exley and White realize that Smith himself has been taking over after Cohen, and the killings have been Smith tying up loose ends.  Exley and White are set up with a trap against Smith and his hitmen. After a gunfight that kills all the hitmen, Smith shoots White in the face, but then is forced to surrender to Exley. As police arrive, Exley shoots Smith in the back, killing him. The LAPD cover up Smith's crimes and say he died a hero in the shootout to protect the department's image, and in exchange Exley bargains to also be hailed a hero and receives a medal for his bravery. Upon leaving City Hall, Exley sees Bracken, who tells him she is returning home to Arizona with White, revealing White survived the shooting. Exley and White shake hands and Bracken drives off into the sunset.  
Kull the Conqueror
 Kull battles for the right to join Valusia's elite Dragon Legion until being told by General Taligaro that as a barbarian from [[Atlantis]], he will never be allowed to join a legion of 'noble blood'. Taligaro then learns that the Valusian King Borna has gone mad and is slaughtering his heirs, riding to Valusia with Kull following. The confrontation that follows ends with Kull mortally wounding Borna, who with his last breath names Kull his successor, to the dismay of Taligaro and most of the assembled nobles. Soon after, Kull meets his harem and recognizes one of them, Zareta, as a fortuneteller he once encountered, who also foretold his kingship. Kull summons her to his chambers, where she reads the cards and tells him that the fate of his kingdom would depend on a kiss. Kull then attempts to sleep with Zareta, but he dismisses her when she reminds him that she is a slave and acts when commanded.  The next day, Kull attempts to free his slaves, but finds that his rulings are hampered by the stone tablets detailing the laws of Valusia. Taligaro and his cousin secretly attempt to assassinate Kull during his coronation, but fail. Taligaro and his conspirators are summoned the following night by the necromancer Enaros, who offers to aid them by resurrecting [[Akivasha]], the Sorceress Queen of the ancient [[Acheron Empire]], which the god Valka destroyed ages before Valusia was built on its remains. Using Taligaro's group to suit her ends to gain power and restore Acheron, Akivasha uses her magic to enchant Kull and become his queen. Akivasha then places Kull in a death-like slumber, framing Zareta of "regicide" while taking Kull to her temple to keep as a plaything.   Kull escapes with the help of the Valkan priest Ascalante, Zareta's brother. The pair free Zareta and the trio head north via the ship of Kull's untrusting associate Juba, in the hope of obtaining the Breath of Valka, the only weapon that can stop Akivasha from regaining her full power. Realizing what they are up to, Akivasha sends Taligaro after them; he catches them just as Zareta obtains the Breath, mortally wounding Ascalante and leaving Kull to die. Taligaro reveals his intent to use Zareta to betray Akivasha and take the Topaz Throne. On the day of the eclipse, Kull returns to Valusia as Akivasha gradually begins assuming her true demonic form, easily thwarting Taligaro's attempt to kill her with Zareta. After Kull wounds Taligaro and kills Enaros, Zareta kisses Kull and passes the Breath of Valka to him, who kisses the now-fully demonic Akivasha to transmit Valka's Breath and extinguish her flame forever. Kull proceeds to kill Taligaro when he attempts to take Zareta hostage, removing the last opposition to his rule.   After being reinstated as king by the now more amenable nobles, Kull names Zareta his queen, then uses his axe to destroy the Tablets of the Law, abolishing slavery in Valusia and allowing it to be reborn as a kingdom of honor rather than tradition.  
Kundun
  [[File:Kundun3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|At the beginning of the film the two-year-old boy (Tenzin Yeshi Paichang) is visited at his rural birthplace in Amdo by the searching [[lama]]s and undertakes a test to confirm his identity as the "Bodhisattva".]] The film has a linear chronology with events spanning from 1937 to 1959;<ref name="nyt">[https://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9C06E2D8123EF937A15751C1A961958260 December 24, 1997 Review] from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref> the setting is [[Tibet]], except for brief sequences in China and India. It begins with the search for the 14th [[mindstream]] [[tulpa|emanation]] of the [[Dalai Lama]]. After a [[vision (religion)|vision]] by [[Reting Rinpoche]] (the [[regent]] of Tibet) several lamas disguised as servants discover a promising candidate: a child born to a farming family in the province of [[Amdo]], near the Chinese border.  These and other [[lama]]s administer a test to the child in which he must select from various objects the ones that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. The child passes the test, and he and his family are brought to [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]], where he will be installed as Dalai Lama when he [[Coming of age|comes of age]].  During the journey, the child becomes homesick and frightened, but is comforted by Reting, who tells him the story of the first Dalai Lama–whom the lamas called "Kundun". As the film progresses, the boy matures in both age and learning. After a brief power struggle in which Reting is imprisoned and dies, the Dalai Lama begins taking a more active role in governance and religious leadership.  Meanwhile, the [[Chinese communists]], recently victorious in their revolution, are proclaiming Tibet a traditional part of [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]] and express their desire to reincorporate it with the newly formed People's Republic of China. Eventually, despite Tibet's pleas to the United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India for intervention, Chinese Communist forces invade Tibet. The Chinese are initially helpful, but when the Tibetans resist Communist reorganization and reeducation of their society, the Chinese become oppressive.  Following a series of atrocities suffered by his people, the Dalai Lama resolves to meet with [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao Zedong]] in Beijing. While Mao publicly expresses his sympathies to the Tibetan people and the Dalai Lama, and insists that changes must be made as the Dalai Lama sees fit, relations inevitably deteriorate. During their face-to-face meeting on the final day of the Dalai Lama's visit, Mao makes clear his socialist view that "religion is poison" and that the Tibetans are "poisoned and inferior" because of it.  Upon his return to Tibet, the Dalai Lama learns of more horrors perpetrated against his people, who have by now repudiated their [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|treaty]] with China and begun [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla action]] against the Chinese. After the Chinese make clear their intention to kill him, the Dalai Lama is convinced by his family and his Lord Chamberlain to flee to India.  After consulting the [[Nechung Oracle]] about the proper escape route, the Dalai Lama and his staff put on disguises and slip out of Lhasa under cover of darkness. During an arduous journey, throughout which they are pursued by the Chinese, the Dalai Lama becomes very ill and experiences two personal visions, first that their trip to India will be propitious and that, similarly, their eventual return to Tibet will also be propitious. The group eventually makes it to a small mountain pass on the Indian border. As the Dalai Lama walks to the guard post, an Indian [[Border guard|guard]] approaches him, salutes, and inquires: "Are you the [[Gautama Buddha|Lord Buddha]]?" The Dalai Lama replies with the film's final line: "I think that I am a reflection, like the moon on water.  When you see me, and I try to be a good man, you see yourself." Once the Dalai Lama arrives at his new residence, he unpacks his telescope and steps outside. Erecting it and removing his spectacles, he gazes through it toward the Himalayas–and toward Tibet. The film concludes with two lines printed on screen: "The Dalai Lama has not yet returned to Tibet. He hopes one day to make the journey." The words shimmer into a dissolve upon the black screen as the credits begin.

The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island
 A swarm of "[[locust|leaf-gobblers]]" descends upon the Great Valley, devouring all plants and leaving it a barren wasteland. The inhabitants must seek another place where they can survive until the plants in the Great Valley have grown back. However, the leaf-gobblers have left a path of devastation behind them, leaving no food for the dinosaurs to find. After searching for many days, tension enters the group as Cera's father and Littlefoot's grandfather argue over changing their course, which sparks a fight between Littlefoot and Cera. The fight soon breaks up when Cera's father announces that every herd should go its own way the next morning. Not wanting to be separated, Littlefoot leads his friends off in the night, in the hope they can find food before they are caught. They leave a trail for the grownups to follow, and eventually reach the "[[ocean|Big Water]]". Although they are disheartened by the undrinkable water, they spy a verdant island connected to the mainland by a thin [[land bridge]]. On their way, an [[earthquake|earthshake]] occurs, causing it to create a [[tsunami]], which they narrowly escape. They quickly tuck in to the plentiful bounty of the island, but are then horrified to discover the tsunami has destroyed the land bridge.  Isolated on the island, they try out Cera's idea to return by using a log as a boat. The plan initially works well, despite Cera suffering [[Motion sickness#Sea sickness|seasickness]] and Petrie being too terrified of the Big Water to act as lookout. However, a [[Cretoxyrhina]] attacks, and in the confusion and fright which follows, they end up on the island again. That night, they remember their families, while the herd, having followed the trail, sleep on the shores of the beach on the mainland, worrying for them while Cera's father blames their leave on Littlefoot.  The next morning, the children wake up to the shadow of a Sharptooth. They take off, but find themselves cornered by high cliffs. They huddle together when the sharptooth approaches, only to find that it is Chomper, a young Sharptooth who hatched in their care before returning to his parents in [[The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure|the second film]]. Since then, Chomper has learned how to talk. Whilst Chomper takes them to a safe refuge to hide from his parents, Ducky is kidnapped by a [[Pterodactylus]], but manages to escape before she can come to any harm. Chomper hides the children in foul smelling plants, and provides them with leafy food upon their request. However, an overcautious Cera openly displays distrust to Chomper because he is a Sharptooth, which grieves him, and he departs. Littlefoot follows him and apologizes, but is interrupted by Chomper's mother. She nuzzles him, then leaves. Littlefoot is intrigued by her display of love to Chomper.  Meanwhile, a [[Giganotosaurus]] living on the island finds and chases the children. Chomper tries to help, but the Sharptooth overcomes him. Fortunately, his parents come to the rescue and battle the Sharptooth near the edge of the island, during which he falls into the Big Water and takes Chomper with him, much to his parents' shock. Littlefoot plunges in to save Chomper while the Sharptooth is swept away by the current. Another swimming Sharptooth appears, but they discover it was an [[Elasmosaurus]] named Elsie who then saves the two from drowning. She returns them to the island, where Chomper's grateful family promises never to harm the children; Chomper's father grudgingly admits that, after sniffing Spike (who had eaten some of the foul-smelling hideout) anything that smelt that bad wouldn't taste very good anyway. Chomper's mother also nuzzles Littlefoot, in gratitude for his actions to save Chomper from drowning. Cera realises and accepts that not all Sharpteeth are so bad and monstrous as she thought. Elsie offers to take them across the sea, so Chomper and his parents happily bid them farewell, promising that they will see each other again. When back on the mainland, they find that the herd found a lush, green, little sanctuary on the shore to stay in until the Great Valley becomes fertile again.  
Lapitch the Little Shoemaker
   :''Original Croatian character names are in parentheses.'' Lapitch (Šegrt Hlapić), a small [[orphan]] [[mouse]], works in a small town as the apprentice of the Scowlers—a mean-mannered [[shoemaker]] (Majstor Mrkonja), and his kind-hearted wife (Majstorica). His dog, Brewster (Bundaš), keeps him company when he is alone.  Master Scowler awaits a visit from the Mayor (Gradonačelnik) and his son (both [[pig]]s); Lapitch has to make sure the pigs' [[boot]]s are the right size. When the piglet tries to put them on, things do not go well, and the two patrons leave for good. Lapitch tries to tell the Master it was not his fault, yet he still blames his young apprentice for the mistake.  Mistress Scowler apologises for her husband's bad behaviour. While he tidies up, she tells the young mouse that she and her husband used to be happier ages ago. Lapitch wants to know why, but the Mistress vows only to tell him when he is older.  Lapitch writes a letter to the Scowlers and leaves the village, wearing the piglet's boots. Although Lapitch has said good-bye to Brewster, the dog joins him the following morning. Eventually, the two of them visit a young [[squirrel]] named Marco (Marko), who lives in a house with a blue star on its walls, and help him round up some geese that went astray while he was tending to the flock.  At evening, Marco's mother thanks them by serving a luscious supper. An awkward raccoon, Melvin (Grga), eavesdrops on the group's conversation. Hearing of a valuable treasure stored inside their house, he runs off to tell his boss, the evil Dirty Rat (Crni Štakor), about the goods.  When morning comes, Lapitch and Brewster say farewell to the squirrels. The road ahead, however, does not go smoothly: an afternoon of unusual weather culminates in an evening storm, and they must find shelter. When they do, under an old bridge they meet Dirty Rat himself, and sleep next to him. Because of Dirty Rat—"King of the [[Underworld]]" as he is known—Lapitch wakes up shocked to see his boots gone.  As he looks for the shiny pair, he meets Lisa (Gita)—another orphan mouse—and her [[parrot]] Pico (Amadeus); both came from a [[circus]] whose [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] treated them badly and left them behind. During their journey, the two mice and their pets meet Melvin's hardworking mother and help her chop wood. Worried about her son's bad deeds, Melvin's mother gives Lapitch a silver [[coin]] for luck before they go off. The mouse later gives it to the raccoon, after he falls off Dirty Rat's wagon.  Soon, the group team up with some villagers to extinguish a fire, but the villagers make Melvin a suspect in the area's recent robbery sting. In addition, the group encounters a poor cat like [[Warthog]] named Yana (Jana), whose magic powers give Lapitch the courage to face the evil Dirty Rat.  After the gang comes to a circus, Lisa entertains the patrons of an under-used [[merry-go-round]]. As night falls, she reunites with her horse, Blanka (Zorka), after hearing its neigh. But a nasty surprise awaits everyone: Dirty Rat makes a deal with Lisa's ringmaster in which he vows to reach Marco's house with a fast horse, and steal the family chest. Lapitch and friends plan to stop him for good when they hear this.  Later on, they meet Master Scowler, whom Melvin has just rescued. Scowler tells them he was robbed and tied up in a tree for two days. They all set forth to put an end to Dirty Rat; Melvin gives them a hand, but his boss ties him and swings him out of the way.  A determined Lapitch, guided by Yana and her wise advice, comes to terms with the villain's schemes and confronts Dirty Rat. Dirty Rat is so enraged that his horse charges straight at the little mouse, about to trample him. At the last moment, a bolt of [[lightning]] splits the harness; the Rat and his cart fall down a cliff, encased in huge boulders, Dirty Rat is presumably dead.  The clouds clear as soon as everyone celebrates. Then, Lisa tames Dirty Rat's black horse, and gives it to Melvin, who promises to live a good life after what he has gone through.  The next day, Lapitch, Yana Marco and the rest arrive at Marco's house, where his mother shows them the family's valuable treasure; she also receives Melvin's coin. When they leave, they meet Marco's father, gone for a long time after working in a faraway land.  Back home, a worried Mistress Scowler is delighted to see everyone back again—Brewster, Master Scowler, Lapitch and Lisa. By then, she and her husband finally recognise Lisa, the orphan circus star, as their lone child Susanna. The Scowlers have their happiest moment ever due to this; afterwards, Master plays a pleasant tune on his [[violin]], and everybody dances to it. Eventually, the Scowlers rekindle their relationship, and the town dwellers celebrate along with them. In time, Lapitch becomes the most respected shoemaker they have ever known.

Lewis Teagarden of the United States Army comes to investigate his claim, and he discovers that Zach faked the footage using a green screen and a homemade UFO model. Dejected and outed as a fraud, Zach gets a job at a local diner and there meets Cara ([[Melissa Galianos]]), a goth girl who is also a huge comic book fan. She tells him he shouldn't have taken the UFO design straight from her favorite comic book. Though Zach has never seen this comic before, the ship looks just like the one he designed.  Zach drives a co-worker home to her trailer in the woods outside of town. Meanwhile, a school bus of students is returning to town from a victorious away football game, and the students are filming their celebration.

The UFO, moving on, lifts the school bus using its tractor beam and drops it back into the woods, completely empty.

Ultra ([[Gordon Currie]]).  When Zach and Cara find Mr. Ultra, he admits that he used to work at the mental hospital before taking up cartooning, and the comic was based on the crazed ravings of a mental patient named Bob.

Recently having recovered from [[open heart surgery]], Devon is encouraged by her parents to make friends, and she is pushed to sell cookies for a charity event for the summer. While selling cookies, Devon leaves the gated community against the instruction of her mother, and meets Trent Burns ([[Sam Rockwell]]), a poor man who lives in a [[mobile home|trailer]] in the woods, and who does landscaping work in Camelot Gardens. An imaginative child, Devon imagines her life to be like the [[fable]] of [[Baba Yaga]], a fairytale which the film makes parallels to.  Devon, at first an annoyance to Trent, continues to come to his property and slowly befriends him; despite the innocence of their friendship, he insists that she keep it a secret because of their age difference. While working in Camelot Gardens, Trent begins having altercations with two young men who live there; Brett (David Barry Gray), who is having an affair with Devon's mother; and Sean ([[Eric Mabius]]), a man with [[closeted]] homosexual tendencies who flirts with Trent. During a family barbecue, Devon explores her father's car in their garage. She finds her father's handgun in the glove compartment of his SUV.

Clare begins to notice Devon's apparent friendship with Trent when he comes to do lawn work at their house, and becomes alarmed. Meanwhile, Brett and Sean terrorize Trent by pouring sugar in the fuel tank of his lawnmower and start a fight with him after they wrongfully believe he stole CDs from Sean's car.  Devon and Trent's friendship continues to grow, and the two go to visit Trent's mother ([[Beth Grant]]) and his father ([[Tom Aldredge]]), a [[Korean War]] veteran who is dying of a lung disease. After leaving Trent's parents' house, Trent and Devon go for a drive in the country. While stopped in a field, Devon insists that since the two are "best friends", she can show him her surgical scar on her chest. She asks him to touch it to his reluctance, and then demands that he show her his abdominal scar which he sustained in a shooting. After showing each other their scars, the two see Sean's dog running through the field, having escaped. While trying to chase the dog down in the truck, they accidentally run him over. Trent kills the badly injured dog in spite of Devon's pleas for him not to, and she runs home in a panic over the incident.  Clare and Morton, concerned over Devon's frantic behavior, ask her what happened, but she refuses to provide details, only saying that Trent killed Sean's dog and mentions that she and Trent took turns showing each other their scars. Assuming that Trent molested her, Morton drives out to Trent's property with Devon, assisted by Sean and an ex-cop who is a [[security guard]] in Camelot Gardens. The three men confront Trent while Devon sits in the car.  Morton and Sean take turns beating Trent, and Morton accuses him of [[rape|raping]] Devon. Morton attacks Trent with a piece of wood, beating him to the ground, and hands it to Sean; but before Sean can hit him, Devon exits her father's car with his handgun and shoots Sean in the abdomen. As Sean bleeds on the ground, Devon urges Trent to leave, and they say their goodbyes.

 In 2096, on a remote planet, the Leprechaun attempts to court a princess named Zarina, in a nefarious plot to become king of her home planet. The two agree to marry, with each partner planning to kill the other after the wedding night in order to enjoy the marriage benefits (a [[peerage]] for the Leprechaun, the Leprechaun's gold and jewels for the princess) undisturbed.   A platoon of [[Space marine|space marines]] arrive on the planet and kill the Leprechaun for interfering with mining operations. Lucky tried to steal gold but gets killed by the leprechaun with a lightsaber. A grenade explodes and kills the leprechaun, but he still comes back. Gloating over the victory, one of the marines, Kowalski, urinates on the Leprechaun's body. Unbeknownst to Kowalski, the Leprechaun's spirit travels up his urine stream and into his penis, where his presence manifests as [[gonorrhea]]. The marines return to their ship with the injured Zarina, whom they plan to return to her homeworld in order to establish positive diplomatic relations. The ship's commander, the [[cyborg]] Dr. Mittenhand, explains his plans to use Zarina's regenerative DNA to recreate his own body, which was mutilated in a failed experiment. Elsewhere on the ship, the Leprechaun violently emerges from Kowalski's penis after he is aroused during a sexual act. The marines hunt the Leprechaun, who outsmarts them and kills most of the crew in gruesome and absurd ways.  While pursuing Zarina, the Leprechaun injects Mittenhand with a mixture of Zarina's DNA and the remains of a blended scorpion and tarantula, before initiating the ship's self-destruct mechanism. A surviving marine, Sticks, rushes to the bridge to defuse the self-destruct but is stopped by a password prompt. Mittenhand—now a grotesque monster calling himself "Mittenspider"—entangles Sticks in a giant web. Meanwhile, the other survivors confront the Leprechaun in the cargo bay, where they inadvertently cause him to transform into a giant after shooting him with Dr. Mittenhand's experimental growth ray.  The ship's biological officer, Tina Reeves, escapes to the bridge and rescues Sticks by spraying Mittenhand with liquid nitrogen and shooting him. The only other surviving marine, Books, opens the airlock so the giant Leprechaun is sucked into space and explodes. Books joins the others at the helm and they deduce that the password is "Wizard", since Dr. Mittenhand previously compared himself to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard of Oz]]. After stopping the self-destruct sequence, Books and Reeves kiss, while Sticks looks out the window to see the Leprechaun's giant hand giving him [[the finger]].

Liar Liar
 In [[Los Angeles]], career-focused lawyer Fletcher Reede loves his son Max, but the constant lying he engages in for his career often cause problems between them and with his ex-wife Audrey, who has become involved with another man named Jerry. In court, Fletcher is willing to exaggerate the stories of his clients, and his current client, the self-centered, money-grabbing Samantha Cole has garnered the attention of Mr. Allen, a partner at the law firm in which Fletcher works. If Fletcher wins this case, it will bring his firm a fortune and boost his career. Fletcher calls and lies to Audrey about missing Max's birthday due to work, when he is actually having sex with his boss, Miranda, in order to get a promotion. Dejected, Max makes a birthday wish that for one day his father cannot tell a lie. The wish immediately comes true, and Fletcher unwittingly tells Miranda he has "had better" sex.  The following day, Fletcher immediately realizes that he is unable to do anything dishonest. He cannot lie to people or even mislead by withholding a true answer, and often uncontrollably blurts out vulgar and painful truths that anger his co-workers. His car is [[Vehicle impoundment|impounded]] after admitting his many [[moving violation]]s and unpaid [[traffic ticket|parking tickets]] to a [[police officer]]. This comes to a head when he realizes that he is unable to even ask questions when he knows the answer will be a lie, which hinders them as Samantha and her affair partner Kenneth Faulk are willing to commit [[perjury]] to win the high-profile case and he cannot ask him the questions they have been given answers for.  Realizing that Max had wished for this to happen, Fletcher tries to convince him that adults need to lie, but he cannot give any type of answer as to why he should continue to lie to his son. Fletcher also figures out that since Max wished for him to tell the truth for only one day, he tries to do what he can to delay Samantha's case since the magic wish will expire at 8:15&nbsp;p.m., 24 hours after Max made the wish. Things only get worse for Fletcher as he loses his loyal assistant Greta after admitting he had lied about the miserly reasons for denying her pay raises and the "expensive" gifts he gave her, and Audrey tells Fletcher that she and Max are moving to Boston with Jerry in order to prevent any more heartbreaks from Fletcher's broken promises.  Fletcher's erratic behavior in court leads to several questions of his sanity as he objects to himself and badgers and provokes his own witnesses into admitting they had an affair against Samantha and her husband's [[prenuptial agreement]]. He even goes so far as to beat himself up in a bathroom and claim that someone attacked him in order to try and avoid the case (not strictly lying as he describes his attacker as a madman with a vague description that still matches him), but when asked if he feels like he can continue, he cannot deny it and says yes. During the case, Fletcher finds a technicality that Samantha lied about her age and was under 18 when she signed the prenup prior to her marriage, rendering it void and entitling her to half of Mr. Cole's estate, allowing him to win the case truthfully. However, when Samantha decides to contest full custody of their children, who Mr. Cole dearly loves, just because she wants more money from the child support payments, Fletcher regrets mentioning the technicality after seeing Mrs. Cole pull the children out of their father's arms, and shriek her demands for more money. Realizing now that winning the case has punished the loving husband and rewarded the cheating wife, Fletcher has a crisis of conscience and shouts at the judge demanding that he reverse the decision, but he is arrested for [[contempt of court]]. He calls Audrey from the prison's phone and begs her to bail him out and give him another chance, but she hangs up on him.  Greta returns and bails Fletcher from jail revealing she has forgiven him. Wanting to improve his relationship with his son as a more honest man, he rushes to the airport to stop Audrey and Max from leaving forever. He misses their flight, but sneaks onto the tarmac by hiding in a piece of luggage, steals a motorized staircase, and manages to gain the pilot's attention by throwing his shoe at the cockpit window, forcing him to abort the flight. However, Fletcher's victory is cut short when he crashes into a barrier and is sent flying into a baggage tug, which causes a chain reaction that leaves Fletcher unconscious and with both of his legs broken. After waking up, he tells Max how much he cares about him and how sorry he was for breaking his promises. Despite no longer being under the wish's influence, Fletcher means what he says and adds that Max is his priority, and Max convinces Audrey to stay in Los Angeles.  One year later, Fletcher is healed and is running his own law firm with Greta as his continued assistant. Max makes a wish with his birthday cake and the lights come on to reveal Fletcher and Audrey kissing, but explains he wished for [[rollerblades]] instead of them reconciling. Fletcher clutches his hands into "The Claw"—a game he likes to play with Max by chasing him—and chases him and Audrey around the house with it.

Life Is Beautiful
 In 1939 in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], Guido Orefice is a young [[History of the Jews in Italy|Jewish]] man who arrives to work in the city where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich but arrogant man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many "coincidental" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally Dora sees Guido's affection and promise and gives in against her better judgment. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosuè, and run a bookstore.  When [[World War II]] breaks out, Guido, his uncle and Giosuè are seized on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a [[concentration camp]]. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a [[gas chamber]] shortly after their arrival. Giosuè barely avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers.  In the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosuè that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosuè is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue. At one point Guido takes advantage of the appearance of visiting German officers and their families to show Giosuè that other children are hiding as part of the game, and he also takes advantage of a German nanny thinking Giosuè is one of her charges in order to feed him as Guido serves the German officers. Guido and Giosuè are almost found out to be prisoners by another server until Guido is found teaching all of the German children how to say "Thank you" in Italian.  Guido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a [[United States Army|US Army]] unit led by a [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about winning the game, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him.

Gabriel is being pressed for results, so he introduces a radical new incentive: if their latest case isn't "cracked" – meaning, if the pair in question do not fall, and stay, in love, O'Reilly and Jackson must stay on Earth forever, which does not appeal to them. They open their case file to learn their tasks.  Celine Naville (Diaz) is the spoiled twenty-something daughter of a wealthy businessman. When one of her suitors, a loathsome dentist named Elliott ([[Stanley Tucci]]), proposes marriage to her, she offers to say yes, but only if he agrees to play "[[William Tell]]" with an apple on his head. As she takes aim with a pistol, Elliot's nerves fail; his move results in a minor head wound.  Robert Lewis (McGregor) is a [[janitor]] employed in the basement of Celine's father's company. His dreams for writing a best-selling trash novel are shot down by his co-workers. His manager tells him he is to be replaced by a robot. As he drowns his sorrows at a local bar, his girlfriend, Lily ([[K.K. Dodds]]) tells him she is leaving him for an aerobics instructor.  O'Reilly and Jackson pose as collection agents to repossess Robert's things and evict him from his apartment. Robert storms to the high-rise office of the company boss, Mr Naville ([[Ian Holm]]), while Naville is berating his daughter Celine for the William Tell fiasco. Security guards run in and start to attack Robert but he holds them off. When Celine introduces herself, Robert decides to kidnap her.  He drives her to a remote cabin in the California woods. Celine easily slips free but decides to stick around. She stays for the adventure and revenge against her father, suggesting that they extort a huge ransom.  O'Reilly and Jackson pose as bounty hunters, and contract with Naville to retrieve Celine and kill Robert.  Robert's first attempt to collect the ransom fails but Celine encourages him. They go out to a rustic bar, where they sing along to the [[karaoke]] machine. When Robert wakes up the next morning, he is stunned to see that he and Celine have slept together.  Robert makes a second demand for the ransom, with a letter written in Celine's blood. Naville gives O'Reilly and Jackson the money, and they go to meet Robert in the forest. To their disappointment, Robert appears willing to let Celine go in exchange for the money before O'Reilly stops his getaway. Aside, Jackson confesses his fears that the two are not in love yet. O'Reilly responds, "Jeopardy, Jackson. Always works."  While O'Reilly and Celine wait by their car, Jackson takes Robert into the woods to execute him. Before he can, Celine decks O'Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel. As Robert and Celine drive away, O'Reilly grabs the towbar and rides along. As she points her gun, Robert and Celine jump from the car, and it careens off a cliff, with the money still inside.  Since they are short of money, Celine decides to rob a bank with Jackson's pistol. The robbery goes smoothly, until a security guard shoots at Celine. Robert pushes her out of the way, taking a bullet in the thigh. Celine hurriedly drives him back to the city, to be operated on by Elliot (the closest thing she can find to a discreet medical specialist). A little later, when Robert regains consciousness, he is appalled to see Celine playing a sleazy sexual role-playing game with Elliott. A fight breaks out, and Robert knocks Elliott unconscious. As they drive away, Celine explains that she only agreed to Elliott's request so that he would help Robert – and, in any case, it's none of Robert's business, since he and Celine aren't "involved," whatever he might think. Hurt, Robert gets out of the car and walks away.  To get them back together, Jackson writes a love poem in Robert's handwriting and sends it to Celine. Overcome, she runs back to the bar, where Robert has started working as a janitor, and says he has won her heart with the poem. O'Reilly and Jackson, listening, dance for joy... until Robert says that he's never written a poem in his life. Humiliated, Celine runs out again. But after she's gone, Robert's boss, Al ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), knocks some sense into him: Robert has nothing in his life except the improbable love of "an intelligent, passionate, beautiful, rich woman... so why are you even thinking about it?"  Robert runs after Celine, but is too late: O'Reilly and Jackson, believing they have failed, decide to make their Earth-bound lives bearable by kidnapping Celine for ransom.  Robert tracks Celine to their hideout. He knocks O'Reilly down and, struggling with Jackson, tells Celine he loves her. The door is kicked down by Naville's butler, Mayhew ([[Ian McNeice]]), who shoots the two angels in the head (apparently killing them). Leaving Celine locked in the trunk, Naville and Mayhew drive Robert and the two angels' bodies to the cabin, planning to fake a [[murder-suicide]].  In Heaven, Gabriel's secretary begs him to intervene, but he refuses. He phones God and asks him to do so. A neighbour releases Celine from the truck. Taking his gun, she runs to the cabin and confronts her father, while Mayhew holds Robert at gunpoint. Robert has had recurring dreams of being saved by being shot through the heart by an "arrow of love." Celine shoots Robert and the bullet passes through, to hit Mayhew in the shoulder. After a whispered conference in Al's bar, Robert and Celine walk outside to their wedding.  In an epilogue, Gabriel frees O'Reilly and Jackson from a pair of body bags. After Gabriel congratulates them on a successful case, the two angels embrace as they prepare to return home. In a second epilogue (filmed with [[claymation]]), Robert and Celine retrieve the suitcase full of money and settle in their new castle in [[Scotland]].

As the police interrogate her, the secret unfolds about Ray, Jimmy, and herself. Years ago she had met Ray when she, her husband, and their newborn baby where driving their family minivan, and Ray needed a ride. While Ray had complemented them on their beautiful baby-boy, and conducted a cheerful, friendly conversation, she was reading a book to her son, the same "little boy blue" book Ray had been keeping among his personal things, and which Jimmy had taken from his elder son earlier to prevent Ray from punishing the boy for stealing, without any hint of what was coming. Hours after they had picked up Ray, she was tied to a tree, beaten severely, her partner killed, and watching as Ray walked away with her son, got into the minivan and drove away.

With the boys out at the lake, and Kate out in the warehouse to find a hints as to where Jimmy might have gone, Ray wakes up to find her pointing a gun to his head. While he starts mumbling that she has got the wrong person, that he has not done anything bad to her, she shoots him several times and heads to the warehouse, where Kate is hiding near Jimmy's bed. As the woman starts looking around the place, she finds the "Little boy blue" book lying on the table, and breaks into tears. Right then she hears Kate crying, too, and without any remorse shoots her dead as well. The boys, who had been hiding under the house, run towards the warehouse, but are stopped by a police officer, who had come to find the woman. She comes out of the warehouse waving her gun at the officer, and as she is about to shoot, she is shot dead by the policeman.

There he is a policeman, married to Traci, playing with his sons and his newborn baby in the park. As he slowly wakes up from his dreams, he hears his sons calling his name, and assuring them that everything's okay, and that he is never going to leave them, Jimmy smiles.

Víctor is accepted as a volunteer by the orphanage, which accepts the qualifications he earned in prison and discovers he is very good with the children. Elena objects, but can offer no compelling argument against Víctor.  David continues to trail Víctor and discovers that he works at his wife's orphanage. He confronts Víctor again, and Víctor denies responsibility for firing the shot that put him in a wheelchair. He demonstrates how Sancho made him squeeze the trigger because Sancho knew David was having an affair with Clara. Afterwards, David tells his wife what Víctor said, admitting that he was having an affair with Clara. Elena is disgusted, but still plans to leave the orphanage to get away from Víctor. Víctor tells Elena that his original plan of revenge was to become the world's greatest lover, make love to Elena all night long, and then abandon her, but that he now loves her too much to do so.  Víctor tells Clara that they should stop meeting, and they break up. While Víctor is working overnight at the orphanage, Elena arrives to remove her belongings and offers Víctor a night of passion on condition he never contacts her again. Elena then tells David about this night of infidelity. She tells him she will remain his wife because he needs her more than Víctor does.

Kevin is Adam's friend who drives a cab to support himself while he pursues his passion for painting.   Adam confides in Kevin about his girlfriend, Nina.  Adam thinks she is having an affair, but he also tells Kevin that Nina's suspected infidelity only bothers him because someone else is paying attention to her.  He gives Kevin the analogy that when he was young, he had a toy car that he became tired of, but regained interest in it after his little brother started playing with it.  Kevin tells him how messed up that is, but Adam only shrugs it off.  Later, Nina comes home and tells Adam she is tired when he initiates sex.  Realizing he may be suspicious, she sleeps with Adam, even though she has just come from sleeping with her lover.  Kevin and Nina, who is a chef in a ritzy restaurant, meet in a Catholic Church where he tells her that Adam suspects she is cheating on him.  Nina is alarmed and asks Kevin if Adam knows who her lover is.  Kevin, it turns out, is the man in which she is cheating on Adam with because she was feeling neglected by Adam. The two express guilt over deceiving Adam, but they also acknowledge they can't stay away from each other. Nina also feels that Adam is not over his ex-girlfriend, Kate, who left him for a woman, Anne, and whom came out as a lesbian.    Adam, figuring out Kevin is the man sleeping with Nina, confronts him at the bar where Kevin and now also Rebecca work.  Kevin tells Adam he wasn't treating Nina right and tells him he knows that Adam is not truly in love with Nina.

Rebecca, being new in town and unlucky in love, meets Anne at a coffee shop. Even though she doesn't have a serious interest in being a lesbian, she decides to sleep with Anne to see if it excites her more than sleeping with men, which has so far, been underwhelming for Rebecca.  She tells Anne she doesn't know what the big deal about sex saying why should two people huff and puff, rubbing up against each other when she can accomplish the same thing by herself in two minutes.  She and  Anne are interrupted during Rebecca's first lesbian experience by Kate who returns home early after finally coming out of the closet to her parents.  She catches Anne and Rebecca in bed together and walks out.  Rebecca, realizing she is not really a lesbian, is embarrassed and doesn't see Anne again.

Anne, it is revealed, has been looking for a reason to break it off with Kate, who is younger and more serious about the relationship.  Anne does not like the domestic routine the two have settled into and tells Kate that she has never been very good at monogamy.     After confronting Nina about her affair with Kevin, Adam and Nina break up.  Realizing Kate is no longer with Anne, Adam sees it as an opportunity to get back together with Kate, although she tells him it's not possible. Adam meets Rebecca when he picks her up in his cab on her way to a blind date.  They recognize each other from the scene in the bar and are instantly attracted to each other. Although she warns Adam that she is not very comfortable with her own body and doesn't feel terribly connected to it in bed, Rebecca discovers sex with Adam is better than any experience she has had before.  Kevin, after Nina and Adam break up, tells her that their relationship wasn't just sex and that he's in love with her. Nina, knowing Kevin's past indiscretions of dumping women after he sleeps with them and loses interest, doesn't  believe his love declaration and tells him she doesn't want to see him again.  Adam and Rebecca are happy until Kate calls him and tells him she wants to get back together and wants him to father a child.  He is initially angry with Kate, telling her that her timing is way off and he is now seeing someone. He feels bad about it, but he breaks up with Rebecca and tells her he is getting back together with Kate.  Rebecca is hurt and tells Adam that she is the one that broke Kate and Anne up when Kate caught the two in bed and says she supposes that makes her and Kate even.  She also tells Adam not to call her when Kate inevitably breaks his heart again.  Kate tries to settle into the rekindled relationship with Adam, but realizing she is really a lesbian, she breaks it off again. This time she tells her unseen, silent therapist that she has decided to stay single and try to get to know herself.  Nina turns up pregnant but doesn't know if the baby is Kevin's or Adam's because she slept with both of them the same night. Kevin still proclaims his love for Nina, but she is still suspect of his feelings.

The girlfriend, Audrey (Fiona Loewi), is seemingly glad to have found a fan-base for Ronnie in England, and spends the day talking to Giles. She then tells him that she and Ronnie will invite him over at another time, and they can talk about Ronnie's career.  Eventually Giles becomes a regular visitor at Ronnie and Audrey's house. Ronnie is flattered by Giles, and Giles is able to stay longer in his presence by claiming that he will write a new script for Ronnie, one that better suits his acting abilities. Audrey becomes suspicious of Giles's motives regarding Ronnie, and she tells Giles that she is taking Ronnie to see her parents for an extended visit. Giles is very upset, and in a last-ditch effort confronts Ronnie and tells him how he feels about him. He says that many artists have had younger male lovers, and that Ronnie should split up with Audrey because it is obvious to him (Giles) that it won't last. Ronnie rejects Giles but seems genuinely concerned for him. The film ends with a screening of Ronnie's next film: another ''Hotpants College'' movie where he quotes Walt Whitman at his mother's funeral as written by Giles. What happens to Giles in the end is not shown.  
The Lost World: Jurassic Park
  On Isla Sorna, an island off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, a young girl named Cathy Bowman wanders around during a family vacation, and survives an attack by a swarm of ''[[Compsognathus]]''. Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company [[InGen]], now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to alleviate the financial losses imposed by the [[Jurassic Park (film)|incident that occurred at Jurassic Park four years earlier]]. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond at his mansion. Hammond explains that Isla Sorna, abandoned years earlier during a hurricane, is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on [[Isla Nublar]]. Hammond hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs, thus causing public support against human interference on the island. Ian, who survived the Jurassic Park disaster, is reluctant. After learning that his girlfriend, [[paleontologist]] Dr. Sarah Harding, is part of the team and is already on Isla Sorna, Ian agrees to go to the island, but only to retrieve her.  Ian meets his teammates, Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian and activist. After arriving on the island, they locate Sarah and discover that Ian's daughter, Kelly, had stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They then watch as another InGen team – consisting of mercenaries, hunters, paleontologists, and Ludlow – arrive to capture several dinosaurs. Meanwhile, team leader Roland Tembo, a [[Big-game hunting|big-game hunter]], hopes to capture a male ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' by luring it to the cries of its injured infant. That night, Ian's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be brought to a newly proposed [[theme park]] in [[San Diego]]. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc upon the camp.  Nick also frees the infant ''T. rex'' and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg. After securing Kelly with Eddie, Ian realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer. As soon as Ian arrives, the infant's parents emerge on both sides of the trailer. The infant is released to the adult ''T. rexes'', which then attack the trailer, pushing it over the edge of a nearby cliff. Eddie soon arrives, but as he tries to pull the trailer back over the edge with an SUV, the adult ''T. rexes'' return and devour him. The trailer and the SUV plummet off the cliff. Ian, Sarah, and Nick are rescued by the InGen team, along with Kelly. With both groups' communications equipment and vehicles destroyed, they team up to search for the old InGen compound's radio station on foot. Dieter, a member of the InGen hunter team, is killed by a pack of ''[[Compsognathus]]''.  The next night, the two adult ''T. rexes'' find the group's camp, as they had followed the infant's blood scent on Sarah's jacket. The female ''T. rex'' chases the group to a waterfall cave and devours the hunter team's dinosaur expert, Dr. Robert Burke, while Roland tranquilizes the male. Much of the remaining InGen team is killed by ''[[Velociraptor]]s'' while fleeing through an [[elephant grass]] field. Nick runs ahead to the communications center at the InGen Worker's Village to call for rescue. After Ian, Sarah and Kelly reach the village, they evade raptors until a helicopter arrives and transports them off the island.  A freighter ship transports the male ''T. rex'' to San Diego, but crashes into the dock. After finding the ship's crew killed, a guard opens the cargo hold, accidentally releasing the ''T. rex'', which escapes into the city and goes on a destructive rampage. Ian and Sarah retrieve the infant ''T. rex'' from InGen's unfinished Jurassic Park San Diego facility, and use it to lure the adult back to the ship. Ludlow tries to intervene, but is trapped in the cargo hold by the adult ''T. rex'' and is subsequently mauled to death by the infant. Before the adult can escape again, Sarah tranquilizes it while Ian closes the cargo hold doors. The ''T. rexes'' are escorted back to Isla Sorna, and Hammond says that the [[Federal government of the United States|American]] and [[Politics of Costa Rica|Costa Rican]] governments have agreed to declare the island a [[nature preserve]], securing the island from any human interference. While Ian sits safe at home with his family, the ''T. rexes'' are seen grazing with their infant as Hammond affirms "life will find a way".

The Man Who Knew Too Little
 Wallace Ritchie (Murray) flies from [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], to [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], to spend his birthday with his brother, James ([[Peter Gallagher]]). As James hosts a business dinner, he sets Wallace up with an interactive [[Improvisational theatre|improv theatre]] business, the "Theatre of Life", which promises to treat the participant as a character in a crime drama. Before the night begins, James hands Wallace a pair of Ambassador [[cigar]]s, promising to "fire them up" before midnight in celebration of Wally's birthday. Wallace answers a phone call intended for a [[hitman]] at the same [[payphone]] that the Theatre of Life uses for its act.  The contact, Sir Roger Daggenhurst ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]), mistakes Wallace for Spencer, the hitman he has hired and Wallace assumes the identity. The real Spencer ([[Terry O'Neill (martial artist)|Terry O'Neill]]) picks up the phone call meant for Wallace and murders one of the actors, prompting a police investigation. Daggenhurst, his assistant Hawkins ([[Simon Chandler]]), British Defense Minister Gilbert Embleton ([[John Standing]]), and [[Russians|Russian]] [[Espionage|intelligence agent]] Sergei ([[Nicholas Woodeson]]) plan to detonate an explosive device (hidden in a [[Matryoshka doll]]) during a dinner between British and Russian dignitaries, to rekindle the [[Cold War]] and replace their aging technology.  Still believing he's acting with the Theatre of Life, Wally meets Lori ([[Joanne Whalley]]), Embleton's call-girl. Lori plans to blackmail Embleton for a substantial amount of money using letters that detail the plot. Spencer was hired to eliminate her and destroy the letters. Wallace scares off Embleton when he arrives to look for them and drives off Spencer. Fearing their plot will be revealed, Daggenhurst hires two more hitmen, while Sergei hires now-inactive spy Boris "The Butcher" Blavasky ([[Alfred Molina]]), to eliminate "Spencer". Boris succeeds in killing the real Spencer, but Wallace and Lori return, retrieving the letters.  Using Spencer's communicator, Wallace mentions lighting up some "big Ambassadors, at 11:59," referring to James' cigars. Thinking the words refer to the assassination plot, both sides believe he is an American spy who has caught on to their scheme. Daggenhurst offers Wallace and Lori 3 million British pounds in return for the letters, at the same hotel where the dinner is taking place. This is a ruse to capture and kill them both. All the while Wallace gets close to his "co-star" Lori, who confesses she'd love to study acting once they're paid.  Wallace contacts James and tells him to meet him at the hotel – soon after, James sees an evening news report that Wallace has murdered an actor and police are searching for him, prompting James to abandon the business dinner. Wallace and Lori are caught and held captive. Boris opts for torture by Dr Rudmilla Kropotkin ([[Geraldine James]]), but Wallace and Lori separate and escape before she arrives. James is captured and sent to be tortured by Dr Kropotkin. Wallace evades the hitmen and finds himself part of a group of Russian folk dancers performing for the ambassadors. During the routine, he sees the Matryoshka doll bomb, unwittingly disarms it seconds before it goes off, blocks a poison dart from Boris with it, and steals the show with his improvised dancing.  Realizing their plot has failed when the bomb fails to go off, Sergei and Daggenhurst bring out two bags containing the promised £3 million for Wallace and Lori and release James, who is exhausted but otherwise fine after his torture session. Boris congratulates Wallace for his impressive covert skills and gives him a souvenir pistol, telling Wallace he will continue his butcher shop business. Sergei and Daggenhurst attempt to escape with half the money and discover Wallace's doll, which they believe is only a normal one he picked out for himself. They are proven wrong when they realign the doll, reactivating the bomb and blowing them up, just as Wallace and Lori share a kiss.  Some time later, on an exotic beach, Wally unwittingly incapacitates a spy, passing a test by an unknown American espionage group. Believing he is capable of being a top agent, they offer him a position on "the team". Thinking that they wish to make him a movie star, Wallace accepts their offer.

 Oswald "Ozzie" Paxton ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]) begins an unauthorized download of a soon-to-be-released video game. His download is interrupted when his younger stepsister enters his room without permission. The resulting squabble between them results in their respective parents intervening. In the process, Ozzie's father discovers the illicit download.  Ozzie is forced to take his stepsister to her private school as punishment, but before he can get out of the school, Bentley ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and his crew of "security guards" use a variety of firearms and tranquilizer dart guns to subdue several staff members, lock down the school, and hold the children hostage. Bentley has planned stages of a ransom scheme involving their parents' corporations. Ozzie attempts to alert his stepsister to the danger. She does not believe him, and he is subsequently chased by one of the gunmen. Using a [[bunsen burner]] and a vial of acid he is able to subdue his pursuer. He subsequently begins wreaking havoc with Bentley's computerized security system.  The police make several attempts to breach the school's perimeter, only to run into automatic gunfire, rocket launchers, and mines. As a concession, Bentley releases most of the children, but keeps the ten richest (and Ozzie's stepsister) and demands a very large ransom for their return. Ozzie locates ten of the eleven children and rescues them, but his stepsister has been taken by Bentley. He then places an improvised time bomb at the bottom of the school's indoor pool. He attempts to stop the ransom payment, but finds out too late that the man designated to deliver it (Foster Deroy) was actually Bentley's confederate. Bentley ties Ozzie to a chair and leaves with his men, keeping Ozzie's sister as an insurance policy. They intend to escape through the sewer pipes using ATV's.  While Ozzie is struggling to free himself, the bomb explodes, flooding the school's lower levels and neutralizing nearly everyone there. Ozzie and his friend, K-Dog ([[Jon Abrahams]]), seize an abandoned ATV and pursue Bentley. They rescue Ozzie's stepsister, but Bentley escapes with the ransom. However, Ozzie is able to blow the whistle on Deroy with a little help from the school principal ([[Brenda Fricker]]) who also witnessed the man's actions. Through his cellphone, the police trace him to the CEO of a rival corporation, who masterminded the plot so that the money used for the bidding would be given to terrorists so he could win a bidding war against the corporation employing Ozzie's father. Soon afterward, Bentley sees a light at the end of the tunnel, only to discover that the light leads to a sewage reclamation plant. The money begins to sink as police cars come to arrest him.  
McHale's Navy (1997 film)
 The movie opens in the [[Caribbean]], on the Island of San Moreno, where a trio of important looking men (a Chinese militant, a Russian General, and a European businessman) are meeting with the island's governor. After paying him a suitcase full of money for a special operation, the three men are joined, via helicopter, by Major Vladakov ([[Tim Curry]]), the second best [[terrorist]] in the world, who will be in charge of the operation. This entire event is witnessed by a young boy named Roberto who takes pictures of the governor, the Major, and his men.  The next morning finds retired [[Lt. Commander]] Quinton McHale ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) making his way to the Naval base of San Ysidro, where he does some trading with the officers. Such goods and services include selling home-brewed beer, ice cream, and swimsuit calendars to the men of the San Ysidro [[Naval Base]] in exchange for things like medicine and satellite photos to help out the people of San Moreno. The satellite photos are actually his way of spying on the opposing children's baseball team. Stationed at the base are his old crew. Virgil ([[Bruce Campbell]]), a cigar-chomping ladies man and gunner. Happy ([[French Stewart]]), the team lookout who lives in a treehouse. Willie ([[Henry Cho]]), the team techie and moonshine maker. Gruber ([[Danton Stone]]), a slightly portly card-player and cigar horder. And Christy ([[Brian Haley]]), the group's musclehead who can unscrew a beer bottle with his eye.  However, the base is now commanded by newly arrived Captain Wallace B. Binghamton ([[Dean Stockwell]]) and Lieutenant Penelope Carpenter ([[Debra Messing]]). Capt. Binghamton believes his men have [[wikt:Special:Search/go native|gone native]] and confiscates all of the products McHale has sold them. He wants to resurrect his career after having mistakenly sunk a luxury cruise liner, for which he is famously known.  Vladakov takes control of the baseball field and beach on San Moreno to set up his base of operations. After Roberto inadvertently alerts Vladakov to McHale's presence, (mostly thanks to the jersey that McHale gave him and the team), Vladakov uses his new [[stealth ship|stealth]] boat to blow up McHale's home and nearly destroys his PT-73, a decommissioned [[PT Boat]], which reveals that they have a rather bad history with each other. When the governor tells Vladakov that his operations are disrupting the lives of the villagers, Vladakov and his men invade the village during their fiesta, blowing it up, and displacing everyone that lived there.  At the Pentagon, Cobra ([[Ernest Borgnine]]), who is a Naval Admiral, finds out about Vladakov's presence on San Moreno and instructs Binghamton to stand down in favor of McHale, revealing that he was once a highly decorated, top covert-operative. This shocks Binghamton, but he relays the message to McHale. Unfortunately, McHale rejects the mission, saying he wants nothing to do with it, or with Binghamton. However, upon learning that the village was destroyed, McHale accepts the assignment with the stipulations that he be given his old crew, men stationed at San Ysidro, and complete autonomy from Binghamton. Binghamton appears to agree but enlists [[Ensign]] Charles Parker ([[David Alan Grier]]) to spy on McHale. Slowly both Parker and Carpenter realize that Binghamton is an incompetent officer.  McHale sets up a camp site for the villagers and, after invading Vladakov's base to find out what's going on, heads to [[Cuba]] for supplies to fix the re-commissioned PT-73 and to combat Vladakov. McHale and his crew use a [[pirated]] [[variety show]] broadcast to prevent Vladakov from stealing missile launch codes and entertain the villagers. Binghamton, tired of sitting on the side lines, attempts an attack on Vladakov's base but upon arrival, it is vacated and shown to be a front. Vladakov has killed the men that hired him to blow up The Pentagon as his motives are finally revealed. He was monitoring communications between McHale and Cobra and is aware that Cobra is en route to San Moreno to help take out Vladakov. Vladakov attempts to kill Cobra using his stealth boat. Roberto is aboard and he tries to short out the boat to no avail. He is captured by Vladakov, but manages to jump ship. After Ensign Parker saves Roberto, McHale successfully kills Vladakov using a torpedo he bought in Cuba, as revenge for Vladakov killing Roberto's father in Panama. Cobra lands safely and reveals that he is McHale's father, none other than now [[Admiral]] Quinton McHale, Sr. and former WWII era commander of the PT-73. Finally, the film ends with the commendations of McHale's crew, and the promotions of Lt. Carpenter and Ensign Parker, the US Navy rebuilding the baseball field, McHale re-retiring so that he may pursue a relationship with Carpenter, and Binghamton's apparent demotion to umpire for a kids' baseball game.

Men in Black (1997 film)
  After a government agency makes [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with [[Extraterrestrial life in fiction|aliens]] in 1961, alien refugees begin living in secret on Earth, mostly disguised as humans in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. A secret agency known as the Men in Black (MIB) polices these aliens, protects Earth from intergalactic threats and uses memory-erasing [[neuralyzer]]s to keep alien activity a secret. Agents have their former identities erased, and retired agents are neuralyzed and given new identities. After an operation to arrest an alien criminal near the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]] by Agents [[Agent K|K]] and D, D decides that he is too old for his job. K neuralyzes him and begins looking for a new partner.  [[New York Police Department]] officer [[Agent J|James Darrell Edwards III]] pursues a supernaturally fast and agile suspect into the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], but is unable to stop him from leaping off the roof to his death. K interviews Edwards about his encounter, then neuralyzes him and leaves him a business card with an address. The next day, Edwards and several other candidates visit the address and undergo a series of tests, for which he finds unusual solutions. While the others are neuralyzed, K explains the history of MIB to Edwards and offers him a position within the agency. After much thought, Edwards accepts and gives up his civilian identity to become Agent J.  In upstate New York, an alien illegally crash-lands on Earth and kills a farmer named Edgar to use his skin as a disguise. The alien goes into a Manhattan diner in search of something and kills two aliens disguised as humans eating lunch. After learning about Edgar's death in a tabloid magazine, J and K investigate the crash site and conclude that Edgar's skin was taken by a "bug", a species of aggressive cockroach-like aliens. They visit a morgue to examine the bodies the bug killed and find a dying Arquillian alien within one, who tells them, "To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt." K fears that the death of this alien, who used the name Rosenberg and was a member of the Arquillian royal family, may start a war.  After finding that the bug has ransacked Rosenberg's jewelry shop without taking anything of value, J and K question [[Frank the Pug]], an alien informant disguised as a dog. Frank explains that the missing galaxy is a massive energy source housed in a small jewel, and the bug wants to destroy the Arquillians with it. He also reveals that the galaxy is on Earth. J deduces that it is hanging on the collar of Rosenberg's cat Orion, which refuses to leave the body at the morgue. J and K arrive just as the bug takes the galaxy and kidnaps the coroner, [[Agent L|Laurel Weaver]]. An Arquillian battleship fires a warning shot in the [[Arctic]] and threatens to destroy Earth unless the galaxy is returned within one hour.  The bug arrives at the observation towers of the [[1964-1965 New York World's Fair New York State Pavilion]] at [[Flushing Meadows]], which disguise two flying saucers from the 1961 landing, where Laurel escapes its clutches. It escapes on one saucer, but J and K shoot it down and the ship crashes into the [[Unisphere]]. The bug sheds Edgar's skin and swallows both agents' guns, and K provokes it into swallowing him as well. The bug tries to escape on the other ship, but J slows it down by taunting it and crushing cockroaches, angering it. K blows the bug apart from the inside, having found his gun inside its stomach. J and K recover the galaxy, and Laurel destroys the remains of the bug with J's gun before it can ambush them. K tells J that he has been training J as a replacement rather than a partner and has J neuralyze him so he can retire from MIB.   Some time later, J reads about K's return to civilian life at a newsstand before he and Laurel (now MIB Agent L, his new partner) continue on to their next mission. After an extensive zoom out shot, it is revealed that the Milky Way itself exists within a marble (much like the galaxy), and is being used by a pair of colossal extra-terrestrial beings in a game of marbles.

Her closest companions are the family's African American maid, Berenice Sadie Brown, and her six-year-old cousin, John Henry West. She has no friends in her small Southern town and dreams of going away with her brother and his bride-to-be on their honeymoon in the [[Alaska]]n wilderness.

Frankie does, however, have a brief and troubling encounter with a soldier. Her hopes of going away are disappointed and, her fantasy destroyed, a short coda reveals how her personality has changed. It also recounts the fate of John Henry West, and Berenice Sadie Brown's future plans.

Lenny Spencer ([[Burt Reynolds]]), head of the network carrying his show, gives Wally an ultimatum—he has a week to clean up the content and boost his ratings, or his show gets cancelled.  Wally's producer, Sandy Gallo ([[Debi Mazar]]), comes up with an idea—Floyd Preston ([[David Ogden Stiers]]) is the governor of Georgia and a staunch conservative known for his attacks on the lowbrow content of Wally's show, so what better way to demonstrate that Wally is trying to change his ways than having Preston on as a guest?  In order to persuade Preston to appear, Wally attends a reception at the Governor's Mansion, where he makes the mistake of getting in a drunken game of strip poker with Preston's wife, Emily ([[Cindy Williams]]), while somehow involving himself in a plot to blackmail the Governor. And the complications keep coming when Wally's son, Dean, begins a romantic relationship with the Governor's daughter.  
Mean Guns
 Vincent Moon (Ice-T) is the leader of a [[crime syndicate]] that has just built a new prison. The day before it is to open, he brings together 100 killers who have wronged the syndicate in various ways, provides them with weapons and ammunition, and gives them six hours to fight each other to the death. A $10 million cash prize is hidden in the prison, to be split by the last three survivors, but Moon's men will move in and kill everyone when time runs out.  A loose alliance forms between Cam (Van Valkenburgh), an accountant who was intercepted while trying to give photographic evidence of the syndicate's crimes to the authorities, and Marcus (Halsey) and D (Warren), two professional killers. They are soon interrupted by another killer, Lou (Lambert), who briefly holds Marcus at gunpoint before being reluctantly accepted into the group. Lou is the informal guardian of a little girl named Lucy (Doughty), whom he has left in his car outside the prison. Cam is badly shaken by the violence raging around her and cannot bring herself to kill anyone.  The four broadcast an announcement over the prison's public address system, claiming that they have found the money and daring everyone to fight them for it. Cam slips away as dozens are killed in the ensuing melee, and D abandons the group only to be strangled to death by Lou. After Moon announces the actual location of the money, Marcus finds two briefcases placed in that spot and takes them, leaving behind a third one rigged with a bomb. Marcus brings Lucy into the prison to help him take out the cash; a woman, who wandered into the prison before the game began, finds the bomb and is killed when it blows the top of her head off.   During these events, Lou reveals that he took Lucy into his care after her mother and stepfather were killed, and that he is participating in the game in order to provide for her future. Cam retrieves the pictures she was trying to turn over and shows them to Marcus, saying that she had not realized the extent of the syndicate's money laundering in which she was involved until she saw them. Marcus reveals that Moon brought him into the game in the hope that he would be the only survivor.  Moon summons the final three survivors - Cam, Lou, and Marcus - to a four-way showdown. He gives each of them a gun and keeps a fourth for himself, but deliberately fails to load the one given to Lou. Marcus shoots Cam and then Lou, whom Moon dismisses as a liability due to his violent nature and desire for revenge against Marcus for raping his daughter. Marcus then kills Moon when Moon tries to quick-draw on him. The wounded Lou admits that Lucy is his biological daughter before he and Marcus kill each other.  Cam wakes up to find Lucy standing over her. Marcus had killed Lou at Lucy's request and only grazed Cam with his shot so she could fake her death. Cam drives off in Lou's car with Lucy and the prize money.

Their predictable life is disrupted by an early morning phone call from Chris's boyhood friend Toni ([[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]]), who has returned to England after several years of wandering through Africa, Europe, and the United States as a [[Bohemian style|bohemian]] poet. Years before, the two shared a dream of fleeing slow suburban death to live in [[avant-garde]] splendor in Paris. Toni's return sparks memories in Chris about their wild days in Paris in the late 1960s.   Disillusioned about the lifestyle he's chosen—having abandoned his youthful passion for photography for a steady job as a London banker—Chris takes long walks at night, making lists in his head of things for which he should feel grateful. Feeling that something is missing in his life, Chris sees in Toni the person he could have become—a free spirit living a vagabond's existence without ties or responsibilities. Toni openly looks down on Chris for his acceptance of [[middle class]] complacency, a mortgage, and a nine-to-five job. One night, Chris goes to a [[punk rock]] club with Toni who gets him stoned on [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Idealising his friend's lifestyle, Chris begs Toni to reveal his secret for happiness, and Toni responds that it's doing what you want, not what others want.  With his dreary and serene marriage, Chris increasingly dwells on the past. He rediscovers naked pictures of his former French girlfriend, Annick ([[Elsa Zylberstein]]), and in the coming days he thinks back to 1968 when they were in Paris together. He remembers taking on the personna of a French beatnik with a contempt for all things English. His French fantasy was interrupted when he met Marion, who was holidaying in Paris with some friends. Taken aback by this mature and intelligent Englishwoman, Chris began spending time with her, telling her about Annick and his ambivalent feelings towards England. Unimpressed with his unrealistic dreams, Marion informed him that eventually he would get married because he was "not original enough" to avoid marriage and a conventional future. When Annick learned about his friendship with the Englishwoman, she broke off their relationship.  Back in the present, Chris is unable to get over the feeling that he has surrendered his youth and ideals to a life he once swore he would never lead. One night he attends a party at Toni's girlfriend's house, arriving without his wife. There he hears Toni casually mentioning that his girlfriend just had an abortion, and then sees him flirting with another woman at the party—doing what he wants to do. Later, Chris meets a beautiful woman, Joanna ([[Amanda Ryan]]), who invites him to sleep with her. After learning that Toni in fact asked her to sleep with his friend as a way of undermining his marriage, Chris rejects the offer and returns home to Marion.  The next day, Chris comes home from work and finds Toni in the house with Marion. Toni hints that he and Marion had sex, and the two friends get into a fight in the garden. Later, Marion tells him that Toni made a pass at her, but that she rejected him. She tells him that despite all of his talk, Toni is really only jealous of Chris and the life he's chosen. The next day, Toni shows up at Chris' house to say goodbye before headed to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], where he intends to do some screenwriting. He tries to tempt Chris into leaving his life behind and come with him, but Chris refuses, admitting, "I like my life; I'm content." That night, while Chris is on one of his walks, Marion approaches and asks what he would put on the list for "happy". Chris responds, "Happy—if not now, never."

Mimic (film)
 In Manhattan, [[cockroach]]es are spreading the deadly "Strickler's disease" that is claiming hundreds of the city's children. Dr. Peter Mann (Northam), Deputy Director of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], recruits [[entomology|entomologist]] Dr. Susan Tyler (Sorvino), who uses [[genetic engineering]] to create what she calls the [[Judas]] breed, a large insect that releases an enzyme which accelerates the roaches' metabolism and causes them to starve to death faster than they can take in nourishment. The disease is successfully eradicated, and Peter and Susan later marry.  Three years later, a church reverend is chased and dragged underground by a strange assailant. The only witness is Chuy, the autistic ward of an immigrant [[Rapid transit|subway]] [[shoe shiner]] named Manny (Giannini). Two kids later sell a "weird bug" from the subway to Susan, which she performs tests on, and realizes is similar to the Judas breed. At first, she believes that this is impossible, since the specimens she released were all-female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, ensuring that the breed would die off after a single generation. She consults with her mentor, Dr. Gates (Abraham), who autopsies a larger specimen found in the city's sewage treatment plants, and finds that its organs are fully formed, meaning the Judas breed is not only alive, but has developed into a viable species, with a sizable [[Insect colony|colony]] underneath the city.  Looking for more valuable specimens, the kids go down the tracks where they find a large egg sac and are then killed by the same strange assailant. Chuy also enters the church to find "Mr. Funny Shoes" and is abducted. Peter, his assistant Josh (Brolin) and [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (New York)|MTA]] officer Leonard (Dutton) enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate but Peter and Leonard get separated from Josh, who is then killed trying to find his way back up. Susan encounters what appears to be a shadowy man in a trench coat on a train platform. As she approaches, it unfolds into an insect the size of a human being which has adapted to appear human. The creature abducts Susan and carries her into the tunnels. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, and they barricade themselves inside a train car.  Susan surmises that the Judas breed's accelerated metabolism has allowed it to reproduce at a similarly accelerated rate, and have managed to [[evolution|evolve]] over tens of thousands of generations within only three years, including developing the ability to [[mimicry|mimic]] their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels and overrun the city unless they are able to kill the colony's single fertile male. Manny finds Chuy but is killed by the male Judas, so Susan goes in search of him but finds only Chuy. Leonard's injured leg starts bleeding heavily, so he creates a diversion that allows the others to get away, before being killed. Peter finds a [[dumbwaiter]] and puts Susan and Chuy in it, but stays behind to destroy the breed for good. He is chased into a room where hundreds are nesting, and blows them all up by setting fire to a loose gas pipe, before diving underwater to safety.  The male Judas escapes the blast and goes after Chuy but is distracted by Susan, who lures it into the path of an oncoming train, where it is killed. The two succeed to the surface, where they are reunited with Peter, who Susan had assumed died in the blast.

She meets a lot of people on her way and most of them try to help her while others are surprisingly apathetic to her situation. Eventually, the movie takes a turn when the girl looks into the camera for the first time, breaking the [[fourth wall]], and someone shouts from off-screen, "Mina, don't look into the camera!"

Mixing Nia
  The movie begins with Nia (Parsons), an upwardly mobile biracial woman working for an advertising firm in New York City. When Nia and her co-worker at the firm, Matt (Thal) are put in charge of marketing a malt-liquor beverage to [[African-American]] teens, Nia quits her job. She decides to presue her dream of writing a novel. She hopes to write about her [[Jewish]] father and African American mother meeting and living in [[Greenwich Village]] in the 1960s. In doing research and beginning her novel, Nia goes on an unexpected journey into her personal identity.  Though her circle of friends is of all races, she has spent most of her life identifying with the Jewish side of her culture, and is a self-proclaimed [[yuppie]]. She hopes to identify more with the African-American side of her heritage, and find an authentic black experience. Her first attempt at this is in enrolling in an African-American [[writing workshop]]. In this class she meets and falls for the instructor, Lewis (Washington). At the same time, she goes out with her former co-Worker Matt for drinks, and finds that he has had a long time attraction to her as well. Nia pursues both of these relationships, with each man exploring a different side of her identity. She begins to learn that the two sides of her identity clash, and that she can't even be "too much" of either race. She is at times too white for Lewis, who comments that maybe he should find a "real black woman", and leave Nia. She also at times feels out of place with Matt, feeling she does not fit in with his friends, and in some instances even feels isolated by their opinions and racial remarks.  Everything comes to a head when Nia invites both men to a wedding in which she is a bridesmaid. She is forced to make a decision between the two, but ultimately decides on being alone. She returns home, hoping to speak with her downstairs neighbor Joe (Serrano), a musician. During the whole movie she has had a fleeting flirty relationship with him, free of discussion of her race, and more about finding who she is as a person. She looks for him as her last person to turn to, but finds that he is gone, and has subleased his apartment for 6 months. Joe left a gift for her, a guitar, which inspires her to continue her novel, which she had given up on.  The movie ends with Nia, now reading a poem to the same audience that at one time she had been "too white" for, and Joe clapping for her in the audience.

Mortal Kombat: Annihilation
 The evil Outworld emperor [[Shao Kahn]] opens a portal to Earthrealm (Earth) and has resurrected his queen [[Sindel]], Princess [[Kitana]]'s long-deceased mother. Earthrealm is therefore in danger of being absorbed into Outworld within six days, a fate which reigning Mortal Kombat champion [[Liu Kang]] and the other Earthrealm heroes must fight to prevent. When Kahn kills [[Johnny Cage]] during a confrontation with the thunder god and Earthrealm protector [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]], he and the remaining Earthrealm warriors must regroup and find a way to defeat Shao Kahn.  An emotionally distraught [[Sonya Blade]] enlists the help of her Special Forces partner, [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]]. Together they destroy [[Cyrax]], and Sonya beats [[Mileena]]. Kitana and Liu search for a Native American shaman named [[Nightwolf]], who seemingly knows the key to defeating Kahn. Kitana and Liu destroy the robotic ninja [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]] with the aid of [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] (the originals films younger brother), but [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] suddenly appears, attacks Sub-Zero, and kidnaps Kitana.  Meanwhile, Raiden meets with the Elder Gods and asks them why Kahn was allowed to break the tournament rules and force his way into Earthrealm, and how he can be stopped. The answers he receives are sparse and ambiguous; one says that reuniting Kitana with her mother, Sindel, is the key to breaking Kahn's hold on Earthrealm, but another Elder God insists that the defeat of Kahn himself is the solution. Raiden is then asked by the Elder Gods about his feelings and obligations towards the mortals, and what he would be willing to do to ensure their survival.  Liu finds Nightwolf, who teaches him about the power of the Animality, a form of shapeshifting which utilizes the caster's strengths and abilities. To achieve the mindset needed to acquire this power, Liu must pass his  tests. The first is a trial of his self-esteem and focus. The second comes in the form of temptation, which manifests itself in the form of [[Jade (Mortal Kombat)|Jade]], a mysterious warrior who attempts to seduce Liu and offers her assistance after he resists her advances. Liu accepts Jade's offer and takes her with him to the Elder Gods' temple, where he and his friends are to meet Raiden. The third test is never revealed.  At the temple, the Earthrealm warriors reunite with a newly shorn Raiden, who reveals that he has sacrificed his immortality to freely fight alongside them. Together, they head for Outworld to rescue Kitana and reunite her with the undead Sindel in hopes of restoring her soul and closing the Outworld portal to Earth. With Jade's help, Liu rescues Kitana, while the others find Sindel. However, Sindel remains under Kahn's control and escapes during an ambush, while Jade reveals herself to be a double agent sent by Kahn to disrupt the heroes' plans. Raiden then reveals that Shao Kahn is his brother, and that the former Elder God [[Shinnok]] is their father. He realizes that Shinnok had lied to him and is supporting Kahn. With renewed purpose, Raiden and the Earthrealm warriors make their way to the final showdown with Kahn and his remaining generals [[Motaro]] and [[Ermac]], along with Sindel. Shinnok demands that Raiden submit to him and restore their broken family, at the expense of his mortal friends. Raiden refuses and is killed by an energy blast from Shao Kahn.  After a hard fight, Jax, Sonya, and Kitana emerge victorious over Kahn's generals, but Liu struggles with Kahn, and his Animality barely proves effective, exposing a cut to Kahn that proves he is now mortal. Shinnok, who explains that these are the consequences for breaking the sacred rules, attempts to intervene and kill Liu on Kahn's behalf, but two of the Elder Gods arrive, having uncovered Shinnok's treachery. They declare that the fate of Earth shall be decided in Mortal Kombat. Liu finally defeats Kahn, and Shinnok is banished to the Netherrealm. Earthrealm reverts to its former state, and with Kahn's hold over Sindel finally broken, she reunites with Kitana. Raiden is revived by the other Elder Gods, who bestow upon him his father's former position. With everything right in the universe once again, the Earthrealm warriors return home.

When placed on a prison transport unit, he is handcuffed to a French criminal named Raymond Villard.  The transport unit is attacked on a bridge, with mercenaries killing all the police officers and prisoners except for Franklin and Villard; the mercenaries are Villard's men, but since he is handcuffed to Franklin he decides to bring him for the moment, and they escape on a helicopter with another French criminal named Dubray.  While on the helicopter, Franklin overhears the two discussing the location of a cache of stolen diamonds. Franklin then jumps out of the helicopter after realizing that Villard and Dubray plan to kill him. While eating at a local diner, Franklin and Villard's mugshots are shown on the news as the two men who killed several police officers. Two other officers in the diner then recognize Franklin, and chase him into the street. He is able to elude them, and decides to call Russell after seeing his face on an advertisement.  Russell has just been fired from his job at Channel 12 News after arguing with his manager, but convinces Franklin to hide with him since the next week is [[Sweeps]] Week. He arranges to get his job back, but plans to keep Franklin hidden until the following Monday. Together they attend Russell's wedding rehearsal dinner, where Franklin meets Russell's fiancé Grace ([[Heather Locklear]]), and somehow ingratiates himself to Grace's father ([[Paul Sorvino]]) and all the other guests by quoting Barry White and pretending to be [[Vic Damone]]'s son. In the meantime, two police detectives question Franklin's girlfriend Paula ([[Elise Neal]]), and wiretap her phone. After calling Paula, Franklin tries to leave, but realizes that the police are combing the city for him, and convinces Russell to help him. The two rampage all over the city to find clues to clear Franklin's name, including calling a bomb threat on a European nightclub, getting shot at by the police when they visit Paula, and being chased by Villard and Dubray, who murder a shopkeeper in the process, which eventually gets Russell's name involved and spread all over the news. The two visit Franklin's childhood friend Aaron ([[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]]), a local arms dealer, who gives them guns and promises to help if they get in trouble. The following morning, Franklin convinces Grace's father, under false pretenses and still pretending to be Vic Damone Jr, to take him to the auto expo where he overheard the Europeans had stashed the diamonds. Franklin and Grace's father get into a bidding war with Villard and Dubray over the car with the diamonds inside, which ends with Dubray chaotically chasing Franklin across the city while Villard kidnaps Russell.  Villard then calls Franklin using Russell's phone, and demands the return of his diamonds, or Russell will die. Realizing that he has no chance on his own, Franklin calls the police detectives, Carmine, the French mercenaries, and Aaron, telling them all to meet him at the ''[[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]''. It is revealed that one of the detectives ([[Paul Gleason]]) is a dirty cop working for Villard. A massive shootout ensues in which both police detectives and Carmine and his crew are all wiped out. Aaron shows up with a henchman, an assault rifle, and an RPG, and proceeds to wipe out most of Villard's men, including Dubray. In the meantime, Russell manages to escape from Villard's men, after placing several un-pinned grenades beneath his helicopter, ready to detonate if he tries to take off. He then reunites with Franklin, saving him from being shot by Villard. However, when cornered once again, Franklin realizes the diamonds are not worth dying for, and throws them at Villard's remaining men, who drop their weapons and begin grabbing as many as they can. The police arrive in the meantime. Villard realizes he's lost and tries to escape in the helicopter. However, the grenades Russell placed there earlier detonate as he lifts off the ground, killing Villard. In the end both Franklin and Russell are cleared and branded heroes. Franklin saves an unknown amount of the diamonds and puts one on a wedding ring he gives to Russell, who marries Grace with Franklin as his best man.  A recurring theme is the use of [[Barry White]]'s song ''[[You're the First, the Last, My Everything]]''; Franklin sings along in his car during the opening credits, and he recites the entire first verse at the rehearsal dinner, replacing the pronouns to match up with Russell and Grace.

MouseHunt (film)
 When once-wealthy string magnate Rudolf Smuntz ([[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]]) dies, he leaves his outdated string factory and a run-down mansion to his two sons, Lars ([[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]]) and Ernie ([[Nathan Lane]]). When Lars refuses a proposal by representatives from the large Zeppco conglomerate to purchase their string factory, his self-centered, money-hungry wife April ([[Vicki Lewis]]) throws him out. Meanwhile, Ernie serves Mayor McKrinkle ([[Cliff Emmich]]) at his restaurant in anticipation of becoming a famous chef for serving such a high-profile guest. However, the mayor is poisoned by a [[cockroach]] (which came from Rudolf's old box of [[Cuban cigar]]s that Ernie took for himself) and suffers two heart attacks, with the latter fatal. As a result, Ernie's restaurant is closed down by the Board of Health. The despondent brothers encounter each other and find solace in their father's decrepit mansion, which the latter had left for them in his will.  Finding the mansion's blueprints, Ernie and Lars discover that it is a lost masterpiece designed by famous architect Charles Lyle LaRue, and could sell for a colossal fortune if properly restored. Multi-millionaire LaRue collector Alexander Falko ([[Maury Chaykin]]) makes a proposal, but Ernie refuses under the belief he and Lars can make a larger profit via auction. However, the brothers have already realized that the house has one stubborn occupant: a tiny and crafty [[mouse]]. Lars is initially dismissive of the mouse but Ernie, remembering the cockroach incident, is determined to rid the house of any vermin that could potentially ruin their plan.  When a single mousetrap proves to be useless against the mouse, Ernie and Lars try all sorts of tactics to kill the rodent, each of which fail spectacularly and damage the house even more. To make matters worse, the brothers are served with a repossession notice by the bank, who warn them that the house will face foreclosure unless they make an overdue mortgage payment of $1,200 within two days, which Ernie had borrowed against to purchase a jacuzzi tub, initially in the hope of raising the property value, that ended up sliding out into the nearby lake with the brothers inside it when were startled by the mouse. They initially attempt to raise the money by withholding the pay of the workers at the factory, but this suggestion triggers an angry response from the workers who then go on strike. In desperation, Lars tries to run the factory on his own but ends up losing his clothes after accidentally feeding loose threads from each article of clothing into the machinery while damaging the machine's [[Fuse (electrical)#Fuse boxes|fuse box]]. He is then unexpectedly reunited with April, who has learned of the auction and the brothers' plans to get rich.  The brothers purchase a monstrous [[cat]] named "Catzilla" to deal with the mouse. Catzilla chases the mouse throughout the house while destroying everything, but gets tricked onto the house's dumbwaiter as the mouse sends him down to his demise. They then hire an eccentric [[pest control|exterminator]], Caesar ([[Christopher Walken]]), to handle the mouse, though he is severely injured and hospitalized after the mouse attaches him to the winch of his own truck which then violently drags him out of the house and destroys the floorboards and plumbing. Meanwhile, Ernie goes behind Lars' back and tries to revive the deal to sell the factory to Zeppco, but his meeting with them is thwarted when he is hit by a bus while trying to impress the two Belgian hair models, Ingrid and Hilde. As Ernie is taken into hospital, Lars arrives (while wearing April's coat and hat) and informs him that April has given them the $1,200 to pay off the mortgage.  After getting back to the house and witnessing the damage caused by Catzilla and Caesar, Ernie chases the mouse up a chimney and gets stuck, and Lars attempts to light a match while the mouse starts a gas leak, creating an explosion that blasts Ernie out of the chimney and into the lake where he and Lars lost the tub. Driven to the brink of insanity, Ernie takes a shotgun to shoot the mouse despite Lars' protest, accidentally shooting a compressed can of [[pesticide]] that Caesar dropped, igniting it and blowing a huge hole in the floor. The brothers then get into an argument after an answerphone message from Zeppco reveals Lars turning down their offer without telling Ernie and Ernie attempting to sell the factory in secret, which results in Zeppco's proposal being withdrawn, which culminates with Lars throwing an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] at Ernie which accidentally knocks the mouse [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]]. Unable to bring themselves to [[Coup de grâce|finish him off]], they instead seal the mouse in a box and mail him to [[Fidel Castro]] in [[Cuba]]. Elated, the brothers quickly reconcile and finish renovating the house.  When the night of the auction arrives, Lars discovers the mouse's box in the snow returned due to insufficient postage and with a big hole gnawed through it. Lars and Ernie panic upon seeing the mouse return, but attempt to maintain their composure as the auction continues. The mouse also devours Rudolf's "lucky string," which he gave to the brothers before his death, making their vendetta even more personal. The brothers desperately attempt to flush out the mouse by feeding a hose into the wall. As the auction reaches a record $25 million bid, the house rapidly floods through the walls and the floors, causing everyone present to be washed out of the house as it promptly collapses. The bidders leave, and April leaves Lars for good for a particularly rich bidder. The brothers' only consolation is the fact that the mouse must finally be dead as their father's "lucky string" is found in the wreckage, only to be quickly disappointed as they accidentally pull it in half.  With nowhere else to go, the brothers return to the factory and fall asleep, with only a single chunk of cheese for food. Having survived his apparent death and followed them on the underside of the car, the mouse restarts and feeds the cheese into the machinery inventing the world's first [[string cheese]], which inspires Ernie and Lars. Ernie and Lars end their war with the mouse and have successfully rebuilt the factory as a novelty string cheese company. Lars has begun a relationship with one of the Belgian hair models, Hilde, and Ernie puts his culinary skill to work in developing new cheese flavors with the mouse as his personal taste tester.  The film ends with the "lucky string" being shown placed in a wall next to Rudolf's portrait with a inscription of his motto: "A world without string is Chaos.".  
Mr. Magoo (film)
 Mr. Quincy Magoo (Leslie Nielsen), a wealthy canned vegetable factory owner, goes to the museum to attend a party. While there, Waldo (Matt Keeslar), Mr. Magoo's nephew, spies a woman named Stacey Sampanahoditra (Jennifer Garner), on whom he develops a crush. Later that night, jewel thieves Luanne LeSeur (Kelly Lynch) and Bob Morgan (Nick Chinlund) steal the museum's beautiful ruby "The Star of Kuristan" and escape on a boat to Austin Cloquet (Malcolm McDowell), Bob's boss.  Meanwhile, Mr. Magoo and his dog Angus go fishing in the same area as the jewel thieves' boat. Luanne picks a fight with Bob and in the scuffle, they lose the ruby which lands in Mr. Magoo's boat unbeknownst to Magoo. Bob goes after the ruby but fails by falling onto the paddle wheel of a paddle boat.  At the museum, the curator and Stacey send two agents: Gustav Anders of the CIA (Ernie Hudson) and Chuck Stupak of the FBI (Stephen Tobolowsky) to track down the ruby and spy on Mr. Magoo whom they believe stole the ruby. Stacey mentions she was invited to the opera where the Magoos go that night. Anders and Stupak also visit the opera to look for Mr. Magoo who is in the show. At the opera Mr. Magoo meets Luanne who pretends to be a magazine reporter named Prunella Pagliachi. She wishes Mr. Magoo luck at the opera, who immediately takes a liking to her. Stupak sneaks on the stage and fails to find any clue about Mr. Magoo with Mr. Magoo accidentally hitting Stupak with a big tool.  The next morning, Luanne tricks Mr. Magoo into taking her to his house with an injured ankle. Stupak finds a notebook with Luanne's fingerprints on it and realizes who Mr. Magoo is with. He and Anders go to Mr. Magoo's house where Stupak sneaks in looking for the ruby. Mr. Magoo and Luanne arrive at the house and Stupak hides from them. Bob sneaks into Mr. Magoo's house and finds the ruby. Upon being caught in the act, he steals Mr. Magoo's prized Studebaker with the Magoos and Luanne chasing after him in Magoo's Eggplant-mobile. Bob loses them and brings the ruby to Austin.  Austin plans an auction for his criminal friends from around the world and shows them the ruby. Mr. Magoo disguises himself as Ortega Peru, a thief from Brazil who never goes anywhere and joins the auction which is taking place in a communal indoor pool. However he is discovered when the fake tattoo on his chest is washed away by the water. Luanne breaks up the auction, steals the ruby, and escapes on a snow mobile away from the lair. The government arrests Austin and his friends while Mr. Magoo gives chase on an ironing board and winds up in the middle of a women's skiing competition. Waldo and Angus sneak out of the lair, catch up with Magoo, and track down the ruby.  Angus sees Luanne in disguise as an old woman and spills her purse which gives Mr. Magoo and Waldo a clue about where Luanne is going. The Magoos follow Luanne to Brazil where Waldo spies on the real Ortega (Miguel Ferrer) and his friends. Mr. Magoo steals a bride dress from Ortega's girlfriend Rosita (Monique Rusu) and is led to the wedding. Mr. Magoo steals the ruby from Ortega and finds himself being chased by Peru's men, the government agents and Luanne. Magoo then is trapped on a raft just before it goes over a waterfall but manages to invert the raft like a parachute so he can gently float to safety. He and Waldo return the ruby to the museum with the government arresting Ortega, Luanne and the people from Brazil.  Mr. Magoo and Angus go home after returning the ruby back to the museum.

Mr. Jealousy
  Aspiring writer Lester Grimm (Stoltz) starts going out with Ramona Ray (Sciorra) after being introduced by Lester's friend Vince ([[Carlos Jacott]]) and Vince's fiancee Lucretia ([[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]]). They immediately hit it off, but Ramona mentions on their first date that one of her ex-boyfriends is famous writer Dashiell Frank ([[Chris Eigeman]]). Lester becomes slightly jealous.  One day Lester is walking down the street and he spots Dashiell and follows him. He then notices how Dashiell goes to group therapy. He then joins the group, pretending that he is actually his friend, Vince. After several sessions with the group and Dr. Poke ([[Peter Bogdanovich]]), Dashiell is complaining about how he has never been faithful when Lester bursts out with some criticism that shocks everyone.   After a couple more sessions, Lester decides to leave the therapy group, which Vince strongly advises against, as he had asked Lester to talk about him to get some personal advice. Vince then convinces Lester to stay for two more sessions, where Lester continues to 'fight' Dashiell. During one particular session, Dashiell is talking about a character in one of his books, and says that it was based on a true person. We are then led to believe that he is talking about Ramona.  Lester still continues with the group therapy, even after the two sessions that he said was his last. After a session, Dashiell asks Lester if he would like to go for a drink. They go to a bar where they drink scotch and Dashiell reveals that he likes their arguments in therapy, since no one else speaks their minds. Lester had arranged to meet Ramona after the session, but has forgotten about it, while Dashiell and Lester become friends. When Lester goes to Ramona's house later, and apologizes for not meeting her, he lies and said that he went to see [[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]], and that it was shot in color, although if he had seen the film he would have known it was in black and white.   Dashiell invites Lester to come over to his house for a drink, and he agrees. Here we meet Irene ([[Bridget Fonda]]), Dashiell's girlfriend.   After the meeting, Lester and Ramona are lying on the bed, where Ramona reveals that a past boyfriend, Steven ([[Brian Kerwin]]), had come over and that they had had sex, but that it was before she and Lester were serious. She then says that her relationship with Steven is over, and that the sex hadn't meant anything.  Later, when Lester is having dinner at Ramona's house, Ramona reveals her sexual past, which proves that she couldn't be the character that Dashiell had described earlier. They then talk about the first time they slept together, which leads to an argument.   At the next therapy session, the true Vince joins the group, under a fake name as 'Leo' and adopts a British accent for the therapy. Vince then reveals Lester's problems to the group, but says that they are his own, even though Lester objects. After the session they have an argument.  In another session, Dashiell reveals that he had met Ramona coincidentally after a meeting, and that they had had sex. Lester then walks out of the session, to find Ramona. She is outside and they have an argument in the street, while the rest of the group come out to see what happens. All of the lies are revealed, and Dashiell punches Lester. Lester begins to walk away, then turns around, walks up to Dashiell and says "She's my girlfriend", and punches him. Lester and Ramona argue and break up.  Several months later, at the [[Iowa Writer's Workshop]], Lester working on his writing, and back in New York, Ramona has been going to Dr. Poke for therapy. The scene then shifts to Vince and Lucretia's wedding, where Lester and Ramona see each other. Lester outstretches his hand, asking Ramona to dance. At first she hesitates, saying how long it had taken for her to get over him, and he agrees. He then outstretches his hand again, and this time she accepts.  
Mother and Son (1997 film)
 The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world.  They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died.

The films end scene sees Mother Teresa travelling to [[Oslo]], Norway to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].  
Motel Blue
 Kyle Rivers has joined the Department of Defense as an investigator. Her first assignment is to do a background check on Lana Hawking, scientist for a top secret clearance.  
Mrs Brown
  Several screens of text giving some background are shown before a bust is shown flying over a palace wall and shattering into countless pieces. The film shows the story of a bereaved [[Queen Victoria]] ([[Judi Dench]]) and her relationship with a [[Scotland|Scottish]] servant, [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]] ([[Billy Connolly]]), and the subsequent uproar it provoked. Brown had been a trusted servant of Victoria's then deceased and beloved Prince Consort, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]; Victoria's Household thought Brown might help to ease an inconsolable Queen since the Prince Consort's death in 1861. In 1863, hoping to subtly coax the Queen toward resuming public life after years of seclusion, Mr Brown is summoned to court.  The plan succeeds a little too well for the servants' liking, especially Victoria's chief secretary Sir [[Henry Ponsonby]] ([[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]]) and [[Edward VII|The Prince of Wales]] ([[David Westhead]]) as well as other members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal family]]; the public, press and politicians soon come to resent Brown's perceived influence over the queen. Brown takes considerable liberties with court protocol, especially by addressing Her Majesty as ''"woman"''. He also quickly takes control over the Queen's daily activities, further aggravating the tensions between himself and the royal family and servants.  The [[moniker]] ''"Mrs Brown"'', used both at the time and in the film, implied an improper, and perhaps sexual, relationship. The film does not directly address the contemporary suspicions that the Queen and Brown had had a sexual relationship and perhaps had even secretly married (see the article on [[John Brown (servant)|Brown]]), though cartoons from the satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' are shown as being passed around in Parliament (only one of the cartoons is revealed to the camera, showing an empty throne, with the sceptre lying unhanded across it).  As a result of Victoria's virtual recluse, especially at [[Balmoral Castle]] in Scotland (something initially encouraged by Brown), her popularity begins failing and [[republicanism|republican]] sentiment begins growing. Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] ([[Antony Sher]]) has a weakening hold over the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and a fear of rising anti-monarchical sentiment in the country. He convinces Brown to use his influence with the Queen to persuade her to return to the performance of her public duties, especially the [[speech from the throne]] at the impending opening of Parliament.  Brown is reluctant to do so, rightly fearing that Victoria will take this as a personal betrayal. When Brown urges Victoria to return to London and fulfill her public duties, an argument ensues. Feeling betrayed by Brown, the Queen becomes enraged.  When Brown once again refers to her as ''"woman"'', she sharply rebukes him. Leaving the room, she turns to Ponsonby and Jenner requesting that they serve her needs, clearly reducing Mr Brown's contact and influence over her. Their relationship was never to be the same again.  The Queen's eventual acquiescence and her decision to return to public life eventually leads to a revitalization of her popularity and a resurgence in public support of the monarchy.  Brown continues to serve Queen Victoria until his death in 1883. In his final years, his duties become reduced to head of security. The palace staff has become weary of Brown's dogmatic ways and they mock and rebuke his security efforts as paranoid delusions. Finally, during a public event, a gun-wielding assassin appears out of the crowd leaping toward the royal family. An ever-vigilant Brown successfully thwarts the assassination attempt. At dinner the next evening, the Prince of Wales retells the story, bragging to their dinner companions that he had been the one to warn Brown of the assassin. Seeing through her son's bragging, the Queen announces instead that a special medal for bravery, the "Devoted Service Medal," will be minted and awarded to Brown.  Some years later, Brown becomes gravely ill with pneumonia after chasing through the woods late at night searching for a possible intruder. Hearing of Brown's illness, the Queen visits his room and is visibly shaken to see her old friend so ill. Placing a cool damp cloth against Brown's fevered brow, she confesses that she has not been as good a friend as she might have been in recent years. It is clear that her apology is accepted by Brown. The pneumonia proves fatal for Brown and he passes away.  During his years of service, Brown had kept a diary and, upon his passing, Ponsonby and Dr. Jenner discuss its contents stating that it must never be seen by anyone. Holding the diary at his side, Ponsonby walks away and it's implied that the diary will be destroyed or will disappear.  Dr. Jenner also reveals that the Prince of Wales has hurled the Queen's favourite bust of Brown up and over the palace wall, referencing the film's opening sequence.  The film's closing crawl notes that ''"John Brown's diary was never found."''  
Mrityudata
  Dr Ram Prasad Ghayal ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) is a renowned doctor who has been successful in all the operations in his career and has skillfully operated many delicate surgeries. He lives with his wife Janki ([[Dimple Kapadia]]) and brother Bharat ([[Arbaaz Ali Khan]]). Bharat is in love with Renu ([[Karishma Kapoor]]), the daughter of Umeshchan Jain ([[Tiku Talsania]]). At the same time, Raja Tunga ([[Deepak Tijori]]), the brother of Rana Tunga ([[Mukesh Rishi]]) has a longing for Renu. The miscreant Raja with his mob severely assaults Bharat when Bharat resists Raja's advances towards Renu.  A corrupt minister Mohanlal ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) wants to execute a disastrous scheme called "Pawanghat Power Project" at the expense of the lives and property of the tribes living at the project site. He coaxes and later threatens Bharat, the concerned engineer to sign his approval for the project, whereas Bharat refuses to endorse such a scheme. On the other hand, Rana devises an evil plot against Bharat to wipe the latter out eventually leading to his brother Raja winning Renu. Bharat is framed for murdering a woman and Inspector Danapani ([[Mushtaq Khan]]), a subordinate of Rana, arrests him and puts him behind bars. Woefully, Bharat dies in jail presumably by committing suicide. The agony of Bharat's death claims the life of Janki as well. With the death of his beloved wife and brother, Dr Ram becomes desolate and alcoholic. Renu marries Raja, without any regret for the death of her former lover.  Now that Bharat is dead, Mohanlal conspires with Rana for the implementation of the power project. However, they end up becoming enemies of each other. Mohanlal plans to kill Raja. His henchmen attack Raja who is critically injured. Raja is admitted to hospital where Dr Ram is to conduct his operation. Renu fears that Dr Ram may kill Raja to take vengeance for the death of his brother. She refuses to sign the operation papers, but Dr Ram, who considers it his moral duty to save the life of a patient regardless of them being his friend or foe, conducts the operation. His expertise pays off as Raja is saved. He goes out to convey the news to Renu, but returns to find Raja dead, beyond all his expectations. Renu files an F.I.R. against Dr Ram, who is arrested and imprisoned.  In jail, Dr Ram meets an inmate bearing the number 92, Prof Nizamuddin Azad ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), a scientist of "Bharat Atomic Energy". He has been jailed after a false allegation of revealing confidential nuclear formulae to foreign nations. He tells Dr Ram that his brother Bharat did not commit suicide, but was tortured to death by Insp. Danapani, which he witnessed. Dr Ram now realises that his past misfortune was a result of the evil motives of some antagonists of the nation. He becomes the Angel of Death ('''Mrityudaata'''), who will put all those malefactors to death.  Dr Ram breaks away from jail and nabs Insp. Danapani who says that Mohanlal planned the murder of Bharat using his influence over police. He also says that Raja was killed by Dr Siddiqui (Avtar Gill) by cutting off the oxygen supply after Mohanlal bribed him to kill Raja. Dr Ram kicks Danapani off the building to his death.  Meanwhile, Mohanlal has allied with another influential politician, Trilochan Tripathi, a.k.a. TT or Terror of Terrors ([[Paresh Rawal]]), who keeps up an honest appearance among the masses, but works for his own interests at the cost of the welfare of the public. Dr Ram corners Dr Siddiqui at the roof of Umeshchan Jain's house, who confesses to killing Raja, and accepting a bribe from Mohanlal. Dr Ram captures a video of Dr Siddiqui's revelation before putting him to death. Soon, Dr Ram kills Mohanlal.  One day, Trilochan Tripathi addresses a gathering when Dr Ram publicly puts a video on view in which Tripathi signs an agreement with a foreign syndicate related to "Pawanghat Power Project". Later, Tripathi would fool the public with false promises of power distribution. The enraged crowd chases Tripathi through the streets when Rana arrives for his rescue.

Murder at 1600
 In a [[restroom]] in the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], a [[janitor]] finds White House secretary Carla Town (Mary Moore) dead. [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Metropolitan Police]] [[homicide]] [[Detective]] Harlan Regis ([[Wesley Snipes]]), whose apartment house is awaiting demolition in favor of a parking lot, is put on the case. At the White House, Regis is introduced to [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] [[Director of the United States Secret Service|Director]] Nick Spikings ([[Daniel Benzali]]), [[National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. National Security Advisor]] Alvin Jordan ([[Alan Alda]]) and Secret Service agent Nina Chance ([[Diane Lane]]). Spikings assigns Chance, a former [[1988 Summer Olympics|Olympic gold-class]] sharpshooter, to keep an eye on Regis.  Parallel to this, the White House has to deal with an impending international crisis: [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Jack Neil ([[Ronny Cox]]) has been trying to deal with a situation where [[United States|American]]s are being held hostage in [[North Korea]], and some people—including several members of his inner circle, led by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Gordon Dylan—think the President is not handling it the right way. Some people think Neil should send troops to North Korea to rescue the hostages; he does not want to start a potential 2nd Korean War, and is disgusted that a high-ranking military official says that the main reason to act decisively is to send a message to North Korea's only ally, China.  White House janitor Cory Allen Luchessi ([[Tony Nappo]]) was apparently unaccounted for on the night of the murder and had once attempted to make a pass at Carla; he is arrested and questioned, but his testimony and a clearly set-up piece of evidence lead Regis to suspect that the Secret Service may be involved. That night, Regis finds his apartment burglarized; the culprit escapes, and in a subsequent search, a hidden bug is found.  In a picture of Carla, Regis sees Secret Service agent Burton Cash ([[Nigel Bennett]]), the Secret Service agent assigned to Kyle Neil ([[Tate Donovan]]), the son of President Neil and [[First Lady]] Kitty Neil ([[Diane Baker]]). Regis figures out that it was Kyle who had sex with Carla on the night of the murder. At the dance club, Regis talks to a young woman who says that Kyle once bragged that he shared Carla with his father. Carla's uncle's company, Brookline Associates, is President Neil's leading [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] fundraiser and Brookline also owns the apartment Carla lived in.  Regis eventually discovers that Chance once used to be Kyle's bodyguard herself. When he confronts her, Chance explains that one night, she heard noises coming from Kyle's apartment, went in, and found Kyle beating up his girlfriend. The Secret Service covered up the beating for Kyle so he would not be arrested for [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], and Chance asked to be reassigned and was replaced by Burton Cash. This sparks Regis's suspicion that Kyle may actually be Carla's murderer.  Regis confronts Kyle with his suspicions, who claims that he did not murder Carla, but is able to provide a special piece of information: among the bookings she made, Carla has supposedly also ordered a car - with the only hitch being that she had had no driver's license. Later on, Regis and Chance discover that the most recent entries in Carla's appointment book were forged. With some clues left by Alvin Jordan, Regis manages to find out that Spikings has withheld several surveillance video tapes from the night of the murder. Regis goes to Spikings' residence to question him, and Spikings is willing to show him the tape but is suddenly killed by a [[sniper]].  Regis and Chance escape the gunfire with Spikings' tape. They play the tape and discover that Jordan is behind everything. Jordan, who has framed Dwight and Nina, uses fabricated evidence to blackmail Neil into resigning because Dylan would not be afraid to send troops to North Korea to rescue the hostages, believing that Neil's refusal to rescue the hostages by force makes Neil unfit to be President.  Regis, Chance, and Regis's partner and friend Stengel ([[Dennis Miller]]) enter the White House tunnels. The sniper who killed Spikings for Jordan pursues them and wounds Stengel, but Chance manages to kill him. Pursued by the Secret Service, Regis just barely manages to get in contact with Neil and present him with the evidence of Jordan's conspiracy. Jordan attempts to shoot Neil, only for his shot to be intercepted by a handcuffed Chance, and he is killed by the Secret Service.  Chance and Stengel are brought to a hospital, where they recover from their injuries. In gratitude for his rescue, Neil promises Regis to look into the commission who bought Regis's building.

My Best Friend's Wedding
 Julianne Potter ([[Julia Roberts]]), a 27-year-old [[New York City]] restaurant critic, receives a call from her lifelong friend Michael O'Neal ([[Dermot Mulroney]]). In college, the two made an agreement that if neither of them were married by the time they turned 28, they would marry each other. Three weeks before her 28th birthday, Michael tells her that in four days, he will marry Kimmy Wallace ([[Cameron Diaz]]), a 20-year-old [[University of Chicago]] student from a [[Upper class|wealthy]] family.  Julianne is disappointed that Michael will marry someone whom she perceives as being so wrong for him, and someone he has known for such a short time. She realizes that she is in love with Michael, and heads to [[Chicago]], intent on sabotaging his wedding. Soon after arriving she meets Kimmy, who asks her to be the [[maid of honor]]. This sets off a subplot in which Julianne must pretend to be the dutiful maid of honor while secretly scheming ways to prevent the wedding from happening. When trying on dresses, Michael walks in on Julianne in her underwear as he tells her that she looks great, leaving her to think that she still has a chance to get him back. She also engages in petty sabotage—for example, taking Kimmy and Michael to a [[karaoke]] bar after discovering that Kimmy is a terrible singer.  When these tactics fail, Julianne enlists the aid of her friend, George ([[Rupert Everett]]) to help her break Michael and Kimmy up. George flies to Chicago to meet Julianne and persuades her to do the obvious: tell Michael that she is in love with him. While at a tailor shop, George convinces Julianne to tell Michael her true feelings before it’s too late. While she finally has the chance to tell him, she gets nervous and quickly tells him that she is engaged to George to get him jealous. Speechless, Michael is shocked about seeing Julianne with someone other than him.  Since Julianne didn’t tell the truth, George tries to get back at her by embarrassing her. On the taxi ride to the church, he snuggles up to Julianne to make her uncomfortable in front of Michael. At dinner he also decides to embarrass Julianne by telling everyone an exaggerated story of how they hypothetically became a couple, and sings “I Say a Little Prayer” as the whole restaurant joins in.  After George leaves to catch his flight back home, Julianne tells Michael the truth about her and George not being together, and Michael admits to being jealous, thinking they were really engaged.  Since it will be their last opportunity to spend time together before his new life as a married man, Michael gets Julianne to go on a boat ride with him. He expresses some skepticism about marrying Kimmy, explaining that he and Kimmy don't share a special song like he and Julianne do. Michael discreetly gives Julianne the invitation to tell him she's in love with him, but she lets the opportunity pass. Michael starts singing their song, “The Way You Look Tonight” in her ear as he grabs Julianne and holds her while they dance one last time.  As the wedding date is approaching, Julianne becomes more desperate to win Michael. She uses Kimmy’s father email account to forge a fake message to Michael's boss, and chooses to save it for later instead of deleting it—that way it will give Kimmy the opportunity to continue on with school and cause Michael to want to leave Kimmy if he can’t have his dream job.  Realizing Kimmy’s father had sent out all of his emails, including the fake one Julianne wrote, she forces Michael to go back to his job so she can get the letter before he finds it. Since the place was closed, Julianne and Michael make their way back to the hotel. Unfortunately, Michael already received the letter and causes a major fit, calling off the wedding, also leaving Julianne alone as he goes for a walk.  The next morning, the day of the wedding, Julianne tries to sabotage the situation further; as Michael and Kimmy are not speaking to each other, they communicate through Julianne, not realizing she is trying to manipulate them into breaking up for good. In spite of this, Michael and Kimmy decide they do love each other and want to get married after all. Leaving Julianne to feel vulnerable, she and Michael then take a walk during which she finally confesses her love to him. She asks him to marry her, and passionately kisses him. Kimmy witnesses this, and runs off, but Michael chases her while Julianne chases Michael.  As Julianne is chasing after Michael in a truck, she frantically calls George explaining the situation, and George makes it clear to her that Kimmy is the one Michael loves because he is chasing after her and not Julianne. Julianne finds Michael at [[Chicago Union Station]], where he is looking for Kimmy, and confesses all to him. Despite his anger at her deception, Michael forgives Julianne, and they split up to look for Kimmy. Julianne then tracks down Kimmy in the bathroom of [[U.S. Cellular Field|Comiskey Park]] (Kimmy's family has a private viewing box at the stadium). Kimmy, rightly furious with Julianne, confronts her, while the other women watch, immediately siding with Kimmy and are disgusted with Julianne's dirty tactics. Julianne, however, apologizes and explains to Kimmy that she kissed Michael unexpectedly, but he didn't kiss her back because he was in love with Kimmy. Julianne declares that Kimmy has won, and that she accepts Michael's decision. Kimmy and Julianne reconcile with each other while the witnesses applaud.  After the wedding, at the reception, Julianne gives a speech as Michael's “best woman” and tells him that he and Kimmy can use their special song until they find one of their own, essentially acting like a true best friend. Julianne wishes them well, and she and Michael share their goodbyes, both of them finally moving on with their lives. Later, Julianne is surprised by George showing up at the wedding reception. The movie ends with the two of them happily sharing a dance together.

 The plot of the film revolves around Parvez (Om Puri), a Pakistani-born taxi driver and a tolerant, secular Muslim. His life takes an unexpected dark turn when his son Farid converts to fundamentalist Islam, leading to  a family breakdown and social conflict.  According to Rachel Donadio, a New York Times writer and editor, the film's theme is encapsulated in a pivotal scene:  <blockquote>One of the most revealing insights into Britain’s recent social history comes early in “My Son the Fanatic,” Hanif Kureishi’s tender and darkly prescient 1997 film. It’s morning in an unnamed city in northern England, and Parvez, a secular Pakistani immigrant taxi driver brilliantly portrayed by Om Puri, watches Farid, his increasingly devout college-age son, sell his electric guitar. “Where is that going?” Parvez asks Farid as the buyer drives off. “You used to love making a terrible noise with these instruments!” Farid, played by Akbar Kurtha, looks at his father with irritation. “You always said there were more important things than ‘Stairway to Heaven,’ ” he says impatiently in his thick northern English accent. “You couldn’t have been more right.”<ref name="NYT">"[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/magazine/10kureishi-t.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&ref=books&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin NYT Profile]".

Nekro (film)
 Claiming to be inspired by actual, but never publicized facts, the story of ''Nekro'' is staged in mid-1980s Romania. Its basic building block is the eternal fight between God and Satan. [[Securitate]]a, the Communist Romanian secret police, takes notices of an illegal religious sect. David, a colonel serving with Securitatea, is assigned to eradicate the sect. He arrests the leader of the sect and subjects him to a series of sadistic interrogations. During the interrogations, David's mind blurs. He gets revelations from the World of Darkness, and starts acting as a man possessed by a demon. The leader of the sect vanishes from prison.  Diagnosed as a madman by a psychiatrist, David is dismissed from Securitatea. Eight years later, he senses the presence of his Master in the surroundings, but cannot locate him. He sees the former leader of the sect, who returned to Romania as a film producer, on the news. David has no doubt that he is his Master. However, as David was not cursed by God to be a Demon, he is able to gather the last of his strength and attempt to kill the Master. Consequently, David is arrested and taken by the police to a hospice.  As all these events unfold, several young women are murdered in [[Bucharest]], the killings becoming breaking news. The psychiatrist who diagnosed David as madman, and who possesses psychic powers, has a vision of the next murder victim. He calls and leaves a message on her answering machine to warn her. The young woman is indeed killed. Looking for clues, the police search her residence and hear the psychiatrist's message. They talk to him, and the psychiatrist directs the detectives to David. The lieutenant in charge of the investigation knows that David cannot be the killer, as he was under surveillance at the hospice at the time the woman was murdered. The lieutenant suspects that they are dealing with a serial killer, as sex was performed on each corpse after the killing. What he does not know though, is that the sex acts were videotaped for commercial purpose.  David escapes from the hospice, and his daughter is kidnapped. His senses take him to a forest that spreads beyond the city limits, where his Master, the actual serial killer, performs the killing rituals.  It turns out that he ordered the kidnapping of David's daughter, who is next on his list, but David's appearance in the forest has complicated plans. Eventually, David is ordered to force himself on his own daughter. Instead of doing so, he kills her, and then gets killed himself. Was David cursed by God to be a Demon? In the afterlife, David defeats the evil spirit, who reincarnated itself into the leader of the sect, and later into the film producer. Do God and Satan exist?

This hack is in the world of virtual reality interpreted as encounters with persons from Jimi's life; the network defends itself by projecting virtual representations of people such as Jimi's father and Lisa. It tries to keep the hacker's mind in the loop of his own memories as it burns the hacker's brain. Jimi manages to pass through the network defence mechanism by freeing his mind, forgetting about life before or after, about bodily feelings, and entering a state of pure concentration where one focuses only on the target (in this case the server with the company's [[bank account]]). It is similar to [[meditation]] where one tries to concentrate on breathing; people who are able to do this are referred to as [[angel]]s (they are invisible to the system, can go anywhere they want, and their possibilities are limitless) in the film. In the end, Jimi feels enlightened and at inner peace with himself. He successfully deletes Solo, comes to terms with Lisa's leaving him, and understands why things happened the way they did. He is in the state of [[Nirvana]].  
Night Falls on Manhattan
 Detectives Liam Casey ([[Ian Holm]]) and Joey Allegretto ([[James Gandolfini]]) are conducting a surveillance operation with a view to apprehending Jordan Washington ([[Shiek Mahmud-Bey]]), a notorious drug dealer. On a tip from an informant, they venture into a block of flats where Washington is reported to be hiding. After Casey shoots his flat door lock, Washington fires a submachine gun through his front door, seriously wounding Casey. Police backup units arrive and swarm the building, but Washington executes a cunning escape in an NYPD squad car after murdering two police officers.<ref name="film"/>  In a surprising move, district attorney Morganstern ([[Ron Leibman]]) appoints Sean Casey ([[Andy García]]), a recently appointed assistant district attorney and the son of Liam the wounded detective, to prosecute Washington predicting that he will be caught. Passing over the more experienced executive assistant Elihu Harrison ([[Colm Feore]]), Morganstern deliberately picks Casey due to Harrison's alleged campaign of undermining Morgenstern's reputation and his expected candidacy opposing Morgenstern in an upcoming judicial election. Defense attorney Sam Vigoda ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) agrees to defend Washington. During the trial, Vigoda does not dispute his client's responsibility for killing the police officers but argues that the police were intending to murder Washington. Washington corroborates this by revealing that he had been bribing certain officers, orchestrated by one called Kurt Kleinhoff, in return for protection while dealing drugs. Vigoda argues that when a rival dealer named Carlos Alvarez offered the officers more money, Washington refused to match it, thus becoming a target. Although inexperienced, Casey mounts a strong argument questioning Washington's credibility and wins the case. Washington is sentenced to consecutive life terms without parole.   A constituent of Vigoda's legal team Peggy Lindstrom ([[Lena Olin]]), begins an affair with Casey after the conclusion of the trial. District attorney Morganstern suffers a severe heart attack after announcing his intention to run for reelection.  Morganstern, now too ill to run in the election, recommends that the Mayor of New York City ask Sean Casey to run for D.A. on the party's ticket. Sean wins the election.<ref name="film"/>  The decomposed body of Kleinhoff is discovered floating near a maritime dock. An address book of his is later found by the authorities containing the names of several officers from police precincts who responded to the Washington shooting. After several interrogations, a number of officers confess their entanglement in the bribery and narcotics scandal. Allegretto later admits he initially lied about his involvement and that he was accepting bribes while also plotting to murder Washington. Berated for his past conduct, a depressed Allegretto commits suicide. Liam later discloses to his son Sean that he and Allegretto were not legally authorized to arrest Washington as their search warrant had expired and so he forged a judge's signature on a new warrant because there was insufficient time to obtain a new warrant if they were to take advantage of their informant's tip.  Sean goes to see Morganstern, who is recovering at a rehabilitation hospital, for advice on how to deal with the police corruption scandal.  Morganstern tells Sean that being D.A. will be a tough job but he believes Sean "will be better at it than most".<ref name="film"/>  Following a voluntary admission of guilt by Liam about the forgery in a private consultation with Judge Dominick Impelliteri ([[Dominic Chianese]]), the judge decides to fill out a new warrant and purposely obviates the technicality. He also suggests to Sean that he destroy the invalid warrant. Sean talks with Sam Vigoda telling him that he plans to resign as D.A. Vigoda urges him not to quit. The film ends with Casey giving the introductory lecture for a new class of assistant district attorneys; urging them to approach their job with diligence and integrity.<ref name="film"/>

The Night Flier (film)
 Richard Dees is a cynical [[tabloid]] reporter whose motto is "Never believe what you publish and never publish what you believe". Merton Morrison, its editor-in-chief at the tabloid "Inside View", confides a case to him about a bloody murder in a rural [[airfield]], committed by a passing aviator who thinks he is a [[vampire]] and registered under the name of Dwight Renfield. Dees refuses but reverses his decision when two more murders are committed in another airfield, the victims drained of their blood. He recovers the case from Morrison, who in the meantime had entrusted it to the novice reporter Katherine Blair, and leaves in the footsteps of the killer aboard his own light aircraft.  Dees gathers accounts, pays bribes and even profanes a grave for the purposes of his investigation. He senses that the case is stranger than it seems and receives messages telling him to stop his investigation. Dissatisfied with Dees' attitude, Morrison sends Katherine Blair to conduct her own parallel investigation. Dees offers the young woman to join forces to hunt down the killer.  They find his trail at the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] airfield and, as he no longer needs her, Dees abandons Katherine to continue alone. He lands at Wilmington and finds the Renfield's [[Cessna Skymaster]] with dirt inside and the interior covered in blood. The airfield seems deserted but Dees finds several massacred people. After taking photographs, he goes to the bathroom to vomit and is surprised by Renfield, who reveals his face and turns out to be a vampire. Renfield destroys his [[photographic film]] and forces him to drink a little of his blood, which gives Dees visions of all the victims coming back as zombies. In a trance, he attacks the bodies with an axe and is shot by the police officers who arrived on the scene with Katherine. She sees Renfield get on his plane and take off but, adopting Dees' motto, she publishes an article that portrays Dees as the killer.  
Night of the Demons 3
 Several years have passed after the massacre for the St. Rita's Academy and on [[Halloween]] night, [[police officer|Officer]] Larry ([[Larry Day]]) is on night watch at Hull House, where he is confronted and murdered by Angela ([[Amelia Kinkade]]) with his own police [[badge]].  Bad boy Vince ([[Kristen Holden-Ried]]), his promiscuous girlfriend Lois ([[Tara Slone]]), and their friends Nick ([[Gregory Calpakis]]) and Reggie ([[Joel Gordon]]) are cruising through town in Vince's sidekick Orson's ([[Christian Tessier]]) [[van]]. They stop to pick up head [[cheerleader]] Holly (Stephanie Bauder) and her shy friend Abbie (Patricia Rodriguez), who broke down on their way to the school dance, on the side of the road. Holly remembers Nick from [[algebra]] class on the first day of school, and Nick speculates Holly likes him.  While stopped at a [[convenience store]], Reggie tries to buy beer with his brother's fake ID, but the unfriendly clerk pulls out a [[shotgun]]. Tempers escalate, and Vince steals the gun just as two police officers enter the store. One of the officers is accidentally shot when the clerk grabs Vince, and the other shoots Reggie in the stomach twice. A fight between the officer and Vince breaks out, destroying the store. The teenagers and a wounded Reggie pile into the van, Vince brings the shotgun, and Orson steals the police officer's gun, and they drive away. Fortunately, the officer they shot is wearing a [[bulletproof vest]] and is not harmed. Lieutenant Dewhurst ([[Vlasta Vrána]]), who is due to retire at midnight that night, watches the [[security camera]] playback of what happened, and deduces that the clerk's story of a robbery is a cover for stealing the money from the [[cash register]], and that the kids are frightened teens, rather than vicious cop killers.  In the van, Vince notices that the gas tank is almost empty, and they decide to hide out at Hull House. Abbie tells Vince that the place is possessed and not to cross over the underground stream, since demons cannot cross over running water, but Vince forces them all to enter at gunpoint. Vince, trying to prove demons do not exist, taunts them and shoots a hole in the wall, causing the evil spirit that possesses the house to rush upstairs from the basement [[crematorium]] in the guise of Angela. Orson decides to stand up for himself and reveal that he has the cop's pistol, and tells Vince that he'll watch the others and Angela while Nick, Lois, and Vince make sure Angela is alone in the house.  Angela puts on some music and does an [[erotic]] dance to distract Orson, and Abbie and Holly see this as an opportunity to escape with Reggie. Holly tries [[Hotwiring|hot wiring]] the van, but remembers that Nick is still inside. Angela begins to [[seduce]] Orson, simulating [[fellatio]] by sucking the bullets out of the gun through the barrel. Then she kisses Orson and her long, demon tongue shoots through the back of his head, killing him. Meanwhile, upstairs, Nick sneaks up on Vince and Lois who are making out, but fails to take the shotgun, and Vince fires the gun at Nick but misses. Outside, Holly hears the shot, and then overhears a voice over Larry's police radio and finds his car. Abbie leaves Reggie in the van to look for Holly, but Angela takes Abbie to a small chapel and plays on her insecurities and says she can make her an irresistible woman, and the demonic Angela kisses her and possesses her as well.  The badly wounded Reggie hears his name called, and leaves the van, only to be run over by the now possessed Orson. Abbie, who has been turned into a demonic version of her cat costume, seduces Vince until he hears the van crash. Lois, who is angry at Abbie because she thinks that she is now the perfect woman to fall in love with Vince, is scratched by Abbie after slapping her, then is pursued by Angela, who causes her hand to transform into a [[snake]] head which bites her. Holly smashes the police car window to call the police, but is attacked by Officer Larry. He chases Holly across the courtyard when she steps over the underground stream; Larry tries to step over it and is disintegrated. Nick finds Holly going back into the house to get everyone out. After encountering Orson, they hide in the attic and share a kiss. Orson appears, and Holly throws a can of [[lye]] in his face. They rush down to the hall when Dewhurst appears and he explains that he wants to help, then handcuffs them and takes them outside. Vince runs outside using Angela as a hostage. Dewhurst tells Vince that the officer he shot did not die, but Angela convinces Vince that Dewhurst is lying. Vince opens fire, but is shot through the eye and killed, and Angela returns to her demon form. The other demons appear, and Angela offers to let Dewhurst and Nick go free if she will willingly give up her pure and powerful soul. Holly agrees, and Angela turns Vince into a demon. The other demons make their way inside to [[Hell]].  Dewhurst creates a diversion, and stabs Angela with Nick's switchblade. Nick gets in the police car and rams Angela against a tree. As dawn breaks, Angela disappears inside the house. As the three make their way to the gate, Dewhurst tells Nick and Holly that they were not on the security camera at the store and no one will ever know they were there. Angela reappears just as they're about to escape and pulls Dewhurst's [[heart]] from his chest. She chases Holly and Nick and just before they cross the underground stream, Angela grabs Holly's arm. Nick ends up pulling Holly and Angela both over the stream and Angela dissolves. Holly leaves a cross made of sticks at the gate and promises she'll be back every Halloween to make sure no one ever goes inside again.  Holly and Nick then walk home and the last screen shot of the house shows the lights turning on and Angela laughing and saying "Happy Halloween".

The story progresses towards the oft-mentioned party at Jujyfruit's house, a [[bacchanalia]]n orgy of excess, drinking and drugs. Here the tone changes from the innocuous and normal beginning to seemingly hallucinatory visions and [[surrealist]]ic visuals and events, before reaching a chaotic finale where some of the issues come to a head. Dark and Mel argue about her desire to have an [[open relationship]] and Dark's desire for commitment. Mel's younger brother Zero (Joshua Gibran Mayweather) and his girlfriend Zoe (Mena Suvari) are ambushed by the Atari Gang on their way to Jujyfruit's house and their car, belonging to Zero's mother, is stolen while they are left helpless on the side of the road.  Egg (Sarah Lassez) and Bart (Jeremy Jordan), separately watching the same [[televangelist]], Moses Helper  ([[John Ritter]]), both decide the world is too messed up to live in and they commit [[suicide]] to reach [[heaven]].

Paul, who had planned on using the money to move his family out of their troubled neighborhood, gets into a fight with Nick and ends their partnership. T. Paul decides to walk home, while Nick drives home and reunites with Ann as he tells her what happened to him.  Returning to his job, Nick is told Philip is reviewing the security tapes to investigate a burglar who vandalized his fertility statue. Nick races to his boss' office but he is too late to stop them, only to discover that the tape was recorded over right before the "burglar" removed his mask, and that a man identifying himself as an electrician was allowed into the building earlier in the day.  Nick goes to see T. Paul and confirms T. Paul recorded over the tape, saving Nick from losing the existence he himself was trying to escape. In return, Nick convinces Philip to hire an electrician responsible for the security system that was so easily bypassed and offers T. Paul the job, which he happily accepts.  In the post-credit scene, a mailman shows up at the gas station in Arizona and returns the money that T. Paul stole.

One Eight Seven
 Trevor Garfield ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) is an [[African Americans|African American]] high school science teacher at Roosevelt Whitney High School, a high school in the [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]]. Dennis Broadway ([[Method Man]]), a [[gangster]] student to whom he had given a failing grade threatens to murder him, writing the number 187 (the California police code for homicide) on every page in a textbook. The administration ignores the threat, and Dennis ambushes Garfield in the hallway, stabbing him in the back and side abdominal area multiple times with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]].  Fifteen months after surviving, Garfield, now a [[substitute teacher]], has relocated to John Quincy Adams High School in the [[San Fernando Valley]] area of [[Los Angeles]], but trouble starts again when he substitutes an unruly class of rejects, including a [[Chicano]] [[Graffiti|tag crew]] by the name of "Kappin' Off Suckers" (K.O.S.). Their leader, Benito "Benny" Chacón ([[Lobo Sebastian]]), a felon attending high school as a condition of [[probation]], makes it clear to Garfield that there will be no mutual respect.  The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry ([[Kelly Rowan]]), confides that Benny has threatened her life, an action against which the administration of the school refuses to take action, fearing legal threats. After Benny murders a rival tagger in cold blood, he  disappears, and Benny's  unstable tag partner, César Sanchez ([[Clifton Collins Jr.]]), takes over as leader. When César steals Garfield's family heirloom watch, the principal is more concerned about a lawsuit and refuses to take action.  Ellen and Garfield develop a close friendship that approaches the beginnings of a relationship, but is stymied by Garfield's destabilizing behavior and his confrontations with the K.O.S.. Garfield's past garners the unwanted admiration of Dave Childress ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]), an alcoholic history teacher who carries guns at the school.  The conflict between Garfield and the K.O.S. escalates with the killing of Jack, Ellen's dog. César, after spraying cartoon graffiti depicting a dead dog, is shot with a syringe filled with morphine attached to the end of an arrow. He passes out, and wakes up to find one of his fingers cut off. César recovers the finger and it is reattached, with the letters "R U DUN" ("are you done?") tattooed as a warning.  A student Garfield has tutored, Rita Martínez ([[Karina Arroyave]]), a [[Chicano|Chicana]], faces abuse from both the K.O.S. and Childress, and drops out. The school administration is mired in bureaucracy and unable to intervene. After Benny is found dead in the [[Los Angeles River]], apparently of a drug overdose, it is revealed that Garfield took matters into his own hands, killing Benny and severing César's finger. Garfield lets Ellen leave as she disavows his actions.  The K.O.S. plan to murder Garfield. At Garfield's house, the gang forces Garfield into a contest of [[Russian roulette]] with César. The latter's resolve is shaken as Garfield talks about the lost-cause lifestyle he has led. Hesitating at his turn, César watches as Garfield, offering to take his turn for him, takes the revolver and shoots himself in the head. Driven by his sense of honor and ignoring the protests of his horrified friends, César insists on taking his rightful turn and ends up killing himself .  On graduation day, Rita, who completes her studies along with former K.O.S. member Stevie Littleton ([[Jonah Rooney]]), offers a tribute to Garfield by reading an essay about him. The essay incorporates the theme of the [[Pyrrhic victory]] and Ellen leaves the school.

On Guard (1997 film)
 In 1700 in Nevers, France, a skilled swordsman named Lagardère ([[Daniel Auteuil]]) challenges Duke Philippe de Nevers ([[Vincent Pérez]]) to a friendly duel in order to learn his secret lethal maneuver known as the "Nevers Attack". Nevers agrees and quickly dispatches the upstart whom he soon befriends. Nevers learns that he has a "son" by Blanche de Caylus—a fact previously concealed by his cousin and would-be heir, the wicked Comte de Gonzague ([[Fabrice Luchini]]). That night Nevers escapes an assassination attempt by Gonzague's men.  Determined to claim his bride, Nevers leaves for Caylus with Lagardère along as his escort. They are followed by Gonzague and his men who plan to murder Nevers before he can marry Blanche and claim his son and heir. Along the way Nevers teaches Lagardère the "Nevers Attack"—an acrobatic sleight of hand that ends with a blade between the opponent's eyes. Soon after, they spot the assassins, and Lagardère is able to delay the attackers long enough to allow Nevers to reach Caylus and marry Blanche. The newlyweds' happiness, however, is short-lived.  When Gonzague and his men arrive at Caylus, they murder the entire wedding party. Lagardère arrives, and after a lengthy sword fight, Nevers is fatally stabbed by a masked Gonzague, who is "branded" by a sword thrust on the hand by Lagardère. Lagardère threatens the unseen killer: "If you do not come to Lagardère," he states, "Lagardère will come to you!"  With his dying breath, Nevers implores Lagardère to avenge him and his wife (who he believes was killed) and to look after their infant child. Lagardère flees Caylus with the infant and finds refuge in the mountains in an abandoned farmhouse, where he discovers that the "son" is in fact a girl, who carries a locket naming her as Aurore.  Gonzague's men track Lagardère to his mountain hideaway looking to kill Nevers' rightful heir. Lagardère and Aurore escape with the help of a band of strolling players who convince the pursuing killers that Lagardère and Aurore have plunged to their deaths in a mountain torrent. After Gonzague's men leave, Lagardère and Aurore join up with the strolling players. Back in Nevers, after attending the funeral of her daughter — the coffin actually contains a wax doll — Blanche retires to a convent, and the evil Gonzague is named executor of her estate.  Sixteen years later, Lagardère and Aurore ([[Marie Gillain]]) are still with the players. After witnessing Lagardère defend her against three outlaws using sophisticated swordplay with a stick, Aurore asks about his past. Lagardère keeps his past hidden, but he teaches her the "Nevers Attack". One night after a performance, Aurore is taken to a party given by one of Gonzague's men, Louis-Joseph, and is soon assaulted by the host. Using fencing skills she learned from Lagardère, Aurore escapes her attacker, killing him using the "Nevers Attack". When Gonzague learns how his "finest blade" was killed, he suspects that Aurore is still alive; his suspicions are confirmed when Aurore's tomb is opened revealing a decayed wax doll. Gonzague then orders his men to find and kill her.  Lagardère sets out to plan his revenge on Gonzague. After revealing to Aurore that she is the daughter of the late Duke of Nevers, and that her mother is still alive, he gains employment as Gonzague's secretary disguised as a hunchback, makes contact with Blanche revealing that her daughter is alive, and then engineers a stock market raid on shares in the [[Mississippi Company]] supposedly on behalf of Gonzague — in fact he purchases the stock using gold provided by Blanche for her daughter's benefit.  When Aurore is captured by Gonzague's men, Lagardère executes a daring rescue. That night, the Regent Philippe d'Orléans arrives prepared to name Gonzague a royal agent to [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. The ceremony is interrupted, however, by Lagardère who escorts Aurore into the hall, introducing her as the majority holder of the Mississippi Company stock. Blanche confirms Aurore is her daughter.  Lagardère then discards his disguise and accuses Gonzague of murdering Duke Philippe de Nevers. As proof he exposes Gonzague's hand — the one he branded at the scene of the murder. In the swordfight that follows, Lagardère kills Gonzague using the "Nevers Attack". Aurore then instructs Lagardère to kiss her, and the two embrace each other.

On the way to her house, however, she crashes the car with the intent to kill them both.

Sofía cannot bear to see him and tries to keep her distance.  After César's disfigurement, he begins to have a series of disorienting experiences. Drunk, César falls asleep in the street. On awakening, everything has changed: Sofía now claims to love him and the surgeons restore his lost looks. But as he makes love to Sofía one night, she suddenly changes into Nuria. Horrified, César smothers her with a pillow and kills her. Yet everyone else believes Nuria was indeed the woman everyone else calls Sofía, and he is imprisoned for her murder.   While he is confined to the prison, fragments of his past return to him as if in a dream.

Returning to their headquarters, under supervision by prison officers, he discovers they specialize in cryonics with a twist: "artificial perception" or the provision of a fantasy based on the past to clients who are reborn in the future. He had committed suicide at home after falling asleep drunk on the street and was placed in cryonic suspension. His experiences from about the midpoint of the movie onwards have been a dream, spliced retroactively into his actual life and replacing his true memories. At the end of the film he decides to wake up and be resurrected.

At a missile base in Russia, [[R-36 (missile)#R-36M (SS-18) variants|SS-18]] [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]] are being decommissioned. Ten nuclear warheads are loaded onto a train and sent to a separate site for dismantling. However, Russian General Aleksandr Kodoroff, along with a rogue tactical unit, kills the soldiers on board the transport train and transfers nine of the warheads to another train. Kodoroff then activates the timer on the remaining warhead and sends the transport on a collision course with a passenger train. Minutes later, the 500-kiloton warhead detonates, killing the survivors and delaying an investigation.  The detonation immediately attracts the attention of the U.S. government. White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly believes that [[Chechens|Chechen]] terrorists are behind the incident. [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Devoe interrupts her briefing to suggest that the crash and detonation were staged to hide the hijacking of the other warheads. A call to Devoe's long-time friend and Russian counterpart, Dimitri Vertikoff, adds credence to his hypothesis and he is assigned as Dr. Kelly's military liaison.  Kelly and Devoe try to track the terrorists through an Austrian trucking company which is a front for the Russian Mafia.

Denied entry into Russian airspace, one of the helicopters is shot down by a Russian [[surface-to-air missile]] battery, but the remaining helicopters are able to locate the truck carrying the warheads. A gunfight ensues in which Kodoroff is killed and the warheads are seized. Interrogation of the surviving member of the group reveals that one warhead was taken by another man.  Further work on the information from the trucking company leads [[Implementation Force|IFOR]] to a [[Sarajevo]] address. Inside is a video cassette of a Yugoslav named Dušan Gavrić. Gavrić disclaims any allegiance in the [[Yugoslav Wars]] ("I am a Serb, a Croat, and a Muslim"), but blames other countries for supplying weapons to all sides in the war. Dr. Kelly realizes he intends to bomb a meeting at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN headquarters]] in New York City and the city goes into lockdown. Gavrić arrives in Manhattan with the Bosnian diplomatic delegation. A flashback shows that Gavrić wants to avenge the death of his wife and daughter, who were killed in Sarajevo. He and his brother are finally found by the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]. When his brother is killed by Devoe, a wounded Gavrić is followed into a parochial school and then a church. Devoe confronts Gavrić, who commits suicide, knowing that the bomb is set to go off in a matter of minutes and cannot be deactivated. With only seconds to spare, Dr. Kelly is able to remove a part of the [[explosive lens]] shell of the bomb, preventing the primary explosion from establishing [[critical mass]] within the [[Pit (nuclear weapon)|plutonium core]]. The primary wrecks the church, but the warhead itself does not detonate. Devoe and Kelly both survive with minor injuries.  
Pardes (film)
  ''Pardes'' is a story that discusses the cultural values of the East and West portrayed by Arjun ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) and Ganga ([[Mahima Chaudhary]]). Kishorilal ([[Amrish Puri]]) is a wealthy businessman living in America visits his old friend Suraj Dev ([[Alok Nath]]) in India. During his stay at the conservative traditional Indian household, he gets to know Suraj's eldest daughter Ganga who shares his love for Indian culture.   Ganga's younger siblings are enchanted by the uncle from America because they perceive Western culture and values to be more desirable. They come up with a plan to impress him with an English song. Unimpressed, he sings back a hymn-like song in a more traditional Indian style, "I Love My India." Ganga joins in this song, expressing her equal love for India. The song emphasises the movie's theme in key moments. After this event, Kishorilal asks Suraj to promise Ganga as a bride for his westernised son, Rajiv ([[Apoorva Agnihotri]]). He is convinced that Ganga will be not only a perfect bride, but she will also be able to revive treasured Indian values and make sure it is  passed on to his Americanized family.   Kishorilal knows he will have a tough time trying to convince his son to meet Ganga let alone marry her. Back in America he asks his foster son, Arjun ([[Shahrukh Khan]]) to help his plan move along. Arjun has values similar to Kishorilal and Ganga. He spends most of his time working full-time in his uncle's garage and in spare time he composes music and is being interviewed for composing a new hit song. However when Kishorilal calls to ask for his help, his loyalty to his uncle is so strong that he cuts the interview short.  Arjun flies to India ahead of Rajiv to set the stage for him to meet Ganga, unintentionally offending Ganga's family with a barrage of orders that includes removing farm animals from around the house and gardens into a nearby farm (to be out of sight) and relocating their servants from residing inside the house to living outdoors. As a result of this Ganga dresses up with horn rimmed eye glasses and buck teeth, sending Arjun into a panic about the success of Kishorilal's plans. Later he gets a chance to meet the authentic Ganga, he is entranced.  In an effort to make up for his offensive behaviour Arjun promises to be a trustworthy friend and asks her how he should make amends. Immediately, Ganga requests he return the farm animals and the servants back into the house. She explains to Arjun that in her family, they love all who are a part of it, even animals and servants. This is in direct  contrast to Arjun's western view that they are not very important.  When Rajiv arrives, he also acts offensively; sometimes intentionally, and sometimes because he has no idea of what Indians consider rude or inappropriate. Arjun, despite his own attraction to Ganga, smooths the way for Rajiv to bond with Ganga, as per Kishorilal's wishes. In his determination to make Rajiv's marriage happen with Ganga  Arjun deceives Ganga about Rajiv's character and habits; he assures her that Rajiv is a "nice guy" he also covers up for Rajiv, telling Ganga the cigarettes she found in Rajiv's room are his own.   Rajiv and Ganga both agree to marry each other thanks to Arjun's efforts. The engagement is set in India, but the families agree that Ganga should visit  America before her wedding day.  Soon after her engagement, Ganga arrives in USA but her feelings are hurt as her traditional dress is despised by Rajiv's snarky mother. After a few weeks in the USA, Ganga is home-sick. Her only true friend is Arjun with whom she begins to form a special bond. One day, she is invited to attend a very large and influential gathering arranged by Kishorilal and is also invited to sing. She sings  the same "I Love My India"  and receives warm, sincere applause.   Gradually Ganga realises that Rajiv isn't the person Arjun had portrayed him to be when they were in India. Rajiv not only seems eager to leave her at home whenever possible, with little explanation or apology. When he does bring her out with his friends, he smokes, gets drunk and acts like a bully. At one party, he is drinking and flirting with other women while another man begins dancing too closely with Ganga. Rajiv ignores the situation, Arjun loses his temper and fights the man to the ground. Later, Ganga is shocked to discover pictures of Rajiv with his girlfriend that clearly show he has had a sexual relationship with her. She is also astonished to find that Kishorilal's family treats Arjun, a trusted member as a servant.  When Rajiv abandons Ganga for dinner with his girlfriend,  Ganga confronts Arjun and demands an explanation. Arjun justifies Rajiv's behaviour, reminding Ganga that Rajiv lives like an American, and that she should not make a fuss about such a petty affair. This exchange leads to a key monologue from Ganga. Infuriated that Arjun sees Rajiv's casual, unapologetic unfaithfulness as a "petty affair", she tells him that she needs "Love" – the kind of love he (Arjun) gives others. She further rejects being made into a "decoration" to fit into Kishorilal's palatial mansion. At this point, Arjun realises that he has fallen in love with Ganga, but because of his immense loyalty to Kishorilal, he continues to encourage her to continue with the engagement and worry about changing Rajiv later.  The next day, it is Arjun's birthday and he is depressed, a thoughtful Ganga senses his frustration and asks Rajiv to accompany her to wish Arjun a  "happy birthday". Rajiv refuses, making it clear that he views Arjun as some kind of servant. Hence, Ganga visits the garage without Rajiv,  throwing a surprise party to liven up Arjun's spirits. Rajiv's hostile aunt Neeta notices the growing friendship between Ganga and Arjun and warns Kishorilal. He arranges for Arjun to relocate urgently telling him he has been promoted, and must start with attending a board meeting the following morning in another city far away. Kishorilal then plans a short outing vacation for Rajiv to be with Ganga in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].   In Las Vegas, Rajiv gets drunk and reveals his contempt for his fellow Indians; he derides Indians as "hypocrites" and "stupid". Ganga heatedly responds that Indians hate America's drug-riddled, amoral alternative and slaps Rajiv. Furious, he tries to rape Ganga; after a violent struggle, she knocks him unconscious and flees.  Rajiv informs Kishorilal who quickly starts looking for the missing Ganga.  Arjun finds her crying at a train station with her clothes torn. He tries to persuade her to go back to Kishorilal's home, but she refuses. Arjun promises to protect her and help her get back to her family safely in India. After Arjun and Ganga safely arrive in India, Kishorilal informs Suraj that Arjun eloped with Ganga and Suraj quickly picks up a family sword that hangs on the wall. Arjun seizes that sword and swears to Ganga's faithfulness and chastity. Then Arjun leaves, intending never to return. Meanwhile, Ganga is not allowed to say a word, and is locked inside a horse shed. Ganga's younger siblings and grandmother sneak in and advise her to run away with Arjun. It is now that Ganga realises that she is in love with Arjun, and with their help, secretly leaves  home. By this time, Kishorilal has arrived in India with Rajiv.  Ganga catches up with Arjun at a temple, and demands that he express his love but Arjun is still loyal to Kishorilal and refuses to marry her.nGanga is devastated but before Arjun walks away, Rajiv turns up with several thugs to kill Arjun but Ganga protects Arjun using her body as a shield.   In the ensuing fight, Arjun takes a terrible beating before getting the upper hand. Kishorilal arrives with Suraj just as Arjun is about to kill Rajiv. Kishorilal furiously suggests that Arjun "honorably" kill himself with a conveniently handy gun, and demands Arjun "tell the truth" about how he came to be in India with Rajiv's promised bride.This leads to the second key monologue of the film.   Arjun confronts Kishorilal with "not wanting to know the truth; people who want the truth, don't ask for it with a gun". He accuses Kishorilal of having become a true Westerner after all, since his wealth has eviscerated his compassion and ability to examine the truth when it doesn't match what he wants it to be. Confessing that he does, in truth, love Ganga, he affirms that he never pursued her and has acted honourably, while Rajiv in every way rejected honourable action and lied about how Ganga came to have returned so suddenly to India; not only was Ganga (personification of the most valued aspects of Indian culture), unable to merge with Western culture, Western values (in the person of Rajiv) almost utterly ruined Ganga.   Ganga confirms Rajiv's attempted rape, which shocks everyone, then tells her father she is willing to die by whatever means he chooses; poison, fire, or hunger. This pivotal scene both verbalises and symbolises how good, happy, pure Ganga (Indian values), instead of being able to uplift and enrich Rajiv (Western values), has been sacrificed to the unsuccessful attempt to merge India with the West.   Moreover, but realising he has indeed heard the truth, Kishorilal affirms that Ganga will marry his son. Rejecting Rajiv (and, symbolically, his own Western compromises), he embraces Arjun as his true son, and along with Suraj and his family blesses the upcoming marriage between Arjun and Ganga.  
Paradise Road (1997 film)
 Basing his film on real events, Bruce Beresford tells the story of a vocal orchestra created by the women in a Japanese Internment camp, a classic survivors' tale about women's ability to survive hardship and atrocity through perseverance, solidarity and creativity. The film opens with a dance at the Cricket Club in [[Singapore]]. Wives and husbands, soldiers and socialites are enjoying a night of dancing, libations, and conversation. The scene is happy and carefree, but the film continues to unfold and it soon becomes known that a war is raging right outside the doors. ''Paradise Road'' is set during the time of World War II, and the Japanese forces have just attacked Singapore. When a bomb explodes right outside the club, it becomes known that the Japanese have advanced beyond defensive lines. The women and children are immediately collected and carried off by a boat to a safer location. A few hours out, the boat is bombed by Japanese fighter planes and the women must jump over board to save their lives.  Three women, Adrienne Pargiter the wife of a tea planter, Rosemary Leighton-Jones a model and the girlfriend of a Royal Malayan Volunteer, and Susan Macarthy, an Australian nurse, swim their way to shore. The place on which they land is the island of Sumatra. The women are found by a Japanese officer, Captain Tanaka, and ushered to a deserted village. They are then taken to a prison camp in the jungle. The three women are reunited with the rest of the women and children from the boat. At the prison camp, there are women of all nationalities including Dutch, English, Irish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Australian; and they all come from many levels of society. Some of the women are nuns, some are nurses, and some are socialites and mothers. The women are forced to bow to the Japanese officers and its flag. The women must endure torture and hard labour while trying to remain positive and level headed. Many believe the war would end soon and their husbands or soldiers will come looking for them. Nonetheless, the living conditions are brutal, and many face sickness and death.  The women have been at the prison camp for two years now. Adrienne Pargiter, a graduate from the [[Royal Academy of Music]], and Daisy "Margaret" Drummond a missionary, decided to create a vocal orchestra in order to encourage the women. Some of the women fear for their lives because the Japanese officers, especially Sergeant Tomiashi "The Snake", who is made known for his cruelty and abuse, have prohibited any meetings whether religious or social.  The orchestra finally performs for the entire camp, even the officers stop to listen to the vibrant music. However, the music only works as motivation for so long and the women continue to dwindle in numbers. After some time, the women are moved to a new location where they will remain for the duration of the war. The war ends and the women rejoice for their freedom.  The film closes on a scene of the last performance by the vocal orchestra. The vocal orchestra performed more than 30 works from 1943 to 1944. The original scores survived the war and are the basis for the music performed in the film. In 1997, many of the survivors were still alive during the making of the film and contributed to the inspiration for ''Paradise Road''.<ref name=Holden></ref>  
Passion in the Desert
 In 1798, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] has launched an [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]]. A frail and elderly artist, Jean-Michel Venture de Paradis ([[Michel Piccoli]]), has been commissioned by Napoleon to sketch the landscape and monuments of Egypt.  French soldier Augustin Robert ([[Ben Daniels]]) has been assigned to keep Venture from being harassed by the other soldiers, but the unrelenting burden of this task soon takes its toll on Augustin. [[Mameluk]]s attack the regiment's small encampment.  In the aftermath, Augustin and Venture are now separated from their regiment. Walking in the arid landscape, under the blaze of the desert sun, they begin to suffer an unquenchable thirst, and Augustin is infuriated when the artist uses the last of their water to mix his paints.  Augustin abandons Venture, who cannot keep up, but promises to return with aid. Venture, unable to believe that Augustin will return, commits suicide. Augustin wanders aimlessly on his own. His thirst compels him to steal water from native [[Bedouin]]s, frightening a young woman who startles him in her tent. Several Bedouin men give chase in response, and he flees to some nearby caves where he is trapped until a leopard, appearing out of nowhere, slays a Bedouin who is about to kill him.  Augustin is terrified at first, then astonished when the leopard gives him food and leads him to water. Augustin and the leopard, whom he names "Simoom," develop a strange and mysterious relationship, and he begins to mirror her behavior, living in the ruins of a lost city near the caves.  Stripping naked, he paints his body with dirt and sand, seeking to resemble her golden-brown fur and its rosette-shaped markings. For a while, they are suspicious and competitive toward each other, but a bond has nevertheless been formed. Augustin finds himself jealous when Simoom goes to mate with another leopard, but she later returns to him.  The bond between Augustin and Simoom is then tested.  He saves her from a group of lost French soldiers, who have wandered by and are aiming to kill her for food. Augustin, however, ultimately decides to return to his regiment rather than be branded a deserter or traitor. He dresses again in what is left of his uniform and [[bicorne]] and ties Simoon to a pole, but she escapes. Simoom, enraged by his attempted departure, charges and pounces upon him.  He is forced to kill the leopard in self-defense.  Wounded by Simoom and suffering intense heat and thirst, Augustin collapses before he is able to find his way back to civilization. On the brink of death, he is rescued by a passing Arab on a camel, and returned to his regiment.

Paws (film)
 Alex, a computer programmer from a cold place very far away, receives a visit from an intruder named Anja but before she breaks in he writes an important message to a colleague, at a greyhound racetrack, named Susie, transfers it to a [[floppy disk]] and gives it to his dog PC, warning him that he should give it only to Susie and trust no one. He hides PC just before Anja breaks in with her vicious dog Sibelius and threatens him for money. He tells her the money is in the retirement fund, after which she kills him. But later she finds that the money is missing and sees the initials SA on the file name which she discovers, in the nearby address book, to stand for Susie Arkwright and starts spying on Susie.  PC reaches Susie's neighbourhood but gets hit by a car and is taken in by the family of 14 year old Zac (the film's main narrator along with PC) who had recently moved to Sydney from Melbourne with his mother Amy,  step-father Stephen and his younger sister Binky. Zac thinks the disk is one of his and keeps it. Zac is then introduced to his new neighbour Susie, who grew up in Sydney, and her daughter Samantha who moved from London and live next door and they recognise PC. Then they learn of Alex's death and PC continues to stay with Zac's family. PC uses Zac's computer to make a translation programme that could translate any language or sound into plain English, even his barking. He demonstrates it to Zac who gives him a new voice with a Scottish accent and installs the software onto a palmtop computer with a microphone in a bow tie so he can talk away from the desktop.  Zac's relationship with PC is strained and after a spate of incidents, often involving Anja and Sibelius, the dog decides to tell him the truth. PC was originally from Iceland where Alex wrote computer programmes and he was married to Anja who was his assistant but she never loved him. Anja stole Alex's programmes and made at least a million dollars from them. Alex got heartbroken when he found the money which he withdrew and fled to Australia with PC to escape from her but Anja found him somehow.   Zac finds the floppy disk which has a clue on where to find information on where to find the money. Zac goes with PC and Sammy to Alex's flat and completes the crossword puzzle on the computer to see a video of Alex saying "A note to follow so" followed by a picture of a pea-like object. After singing [[Do-Re-Mi]] they figure that the password is LAP then they see another video of Alex this time saying "Well done. The rest is in and under your nose. Bonne Chance". Anja arrives and threatens them with a dagger so Zac deletes the file to stop her but she kidnaps PC.  Back home Stephen, who Zac had previously seen taking a loan from Anja, agrees to help them and they go to the greyhound track where Alex and Susie worked. PC tricks Sibelius into letting him out of the cage but when Zac comes to help him he lets out Anja's dog who chases after them. Sammy deciphers the clue but takes "LAP in" to be the French word for rabbit and tells PC who is then catapulted into the commentator's box where he announces that the money is in the rabbit. Anja takes this to mean the mechanical rabbit on the track and starts tearing it apart but gets stuck and is dragged around the track not finding any money. Binky find's Sammy's [[Hollywood]] pin badge, which Alex gave her, and asks "What's a Hollywood?" and Sammy explains that it is a place in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] then they realise that the clue means L.A. pin and they find  jewellry inside it.  The film ends with PC making out with Sammy's dog Cordelia.  
The Peacekeeper
 United States Air Force Major Frank Cross is in trouble with the "brass" again. This time he's made an unauthorized humanitarian relief flight and dropped sacks of rice to starving Kurds. To the press, he's a hero, but the Pentagon would like to court martial him. It can't because the President wants the highly photogenic media hero by his side to promote his election campaign, at least until after the next election.<ref>[http://putlocker.is/watch-the-peacekeeper-online-free-putlocker.htm Pulocker]</ref>  So Cross has a new assignment. His job is now to carry the [[Nuclear football|"black bag"]], the President's high-tech briefcase containing the "go codes" and communications computer for launching America's nuclear ICBM arsenal in case of a national emergency. It should be an easy job, but on his first day on the job in [[Chicago]] a team of mercenaries manages to steal the black bag. Cross, however, manages to barely survive it fake his death and infiltrate the mercenaries. Thinking they have seen the last of him they fly with a helicopter from the rooftops of Chicago into the night sky and onwards to their final target... United States Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Facility K-7. Disguised Cross slips into the missile silo as the crack team murders the silo personnel and takes over the launch control using the secret codes contained in the black bag.   They are led by ex-Marine Colonel Douglas Murphy, whose unit was sent to kill [[Saddam Hussein]] during an undercover operation in Iraq before Operation Desert Storm and was then exterminated by the then Army Chief turned President because of political reasons. Driven by revenge he then launches a terrifying warning shot and sends a Peacekeeper nuclear missile that destroys [[Mount Rushmore]] and kills thousands of people. Only then does Murphy make his chilling demand. The President is to kill himself in front of a live television audience or Washington D.C. will be wiped out.  All attempts to stop one of the missiles from leaving the silo fail. In a desperate attempt to prevent the destruction of Washington D.C. from happening, the President gives in to Murphy's demand only to realise, that he lied to utterly humiliate him, so that he then should helplessly watch Washington be destroyed as Murphy helplessly had to watch his unit be destroyed against his will by the President.  At the first opportunity, however, Frank acts against the terrorists and, with the help of the last surviving member of the silo, Lt. Colonel Northrop, he is able to kill the mercenaries and prevent the destruction of Washington in the nick of time.

Perfect Blue
 Mima Kirigoe, the lead singer of the fictional [[J-pop]] idol group "CHAM!", decides to leave the group to become an [[Actor|actress]], believing that the idol group life is a dead end job. Her first project is a [[crime drama]] series, ''Double Bind''. Some of her fans are upset by her change in career, including a [[Stalking|stalker]] known as "Me-Mania". Shortly after leaving CHAM!, Mima receives an anonymous [[fax]] calling her a traitor. She also finds a website called "Mima's Room", which features public diary entries that seem to be written by her that discuss her life in great detail. She brings the site to the attention of her manager, ex-pop star Rumi Hidaka, but is advised to ignore it.  On the set of ''Double Bind'', Mima succeeds in getting a larger part. However, the producers decide to cast her as a rape victim in a [[strip club]]. Rumi warns Mima that it will damage her reputation, but Mima accepts the part, wanting to be taken more seriously as an actress. The scene traumatizes Mima (as well as Rumi, who leaves the production control room crying). Mima increasingly becomes unable to distinguish reality from her work in show business.  Several people involved in creating ''Double Bind'', including the show's writer and photographer, are found murdered. Mima finds evidence that makes her a suspect in those murders, based on entries on the Mima's Room website, and her increasing mental instability makes her doubt her own innocence. Meanwhile, Me-Mania is constantly shown standing amongst the ''Double Bind'' filming crew, and his obsessive home life is revealed when he is shown receiving emails from Mima's pop idol persona through the Mima's Room website. It is at this point that reality starts breaking down for the viewer as well: in one scene, Mima is revealed by a police psychiatrist to be the split personality delusion of a woman named Yoko Takakura, only for the ''Double Bind'' camera crew to yell "Cut"; in another, Me-Mania finally confronts and attempts to [[rape]] Mima, stopped only when Mima knocks him unconscious with a hammer; this too is hinted as being part of a ''Double Bind'' film shoot. Rumi finds Mima backstage immediately afterward, and Me-Mania's blood and body are not found on the now-empty set.  Rumi offers to drive Mima home. Upon arriving, Mima tries to place a call, but stops upon realizing that she is actually in a room decorated to resemble her own pop idol apartment at the beginning of the film. When Mima encounters Rumi, however, her manager is wearing a replica of Mima's CHAM! costume and fully believing, in a psychotic break, that she is Mima herself. Rumi is in fact the false diarist of Mima's Room, who believes she is the "real Mima". Rumi is angry that Mima—who has been suffering from ''[[folie à deux]]'' throughout the film—has been ruining the "real Mima's" reputation, and decides to save "Mima's" pristine pop idol image by murdering the original, who she believes is an imposter. Mima manages to incapacitate Rumi in self-defense after a chase through the city despite being wounded herself, then saves Rumi from an oncoming truck. Severely wounded and fully delirious, Rumi mistakes the truck's headlights for stage lights. Both parties collapse as the truck's occupants call for an ambulance.  Mima, now an accomplished actress, shows up at a mental institution to visit Rumi, who, believing the flowers Mima leaves for her as from her adoring fans, seems to now permanently exist in her "Mima" delusion. As Mima leaves, she overhears the nursing staff believing that she is a Mima imposter, as she would have no reason to visit an institution. Mima enters her car and, looking into the rear view mirror, declares "I'm the real thing" and smiles.

Photographing Fairies
 In [[Switzerland]] in 1912, photographer [[Charles Castle]] ([[Toby Stephens]]) and Anna-Marie, his fiancèe, are married in an [[Alps|Alpine]] church. The following day, they are walking in the mountains when a snowstorm closes in. They are returning to the village when a crevasse opens and Anna-Marie falls into it. Charles tries to pull her out but he loses his grip and she dies. During [[World War I|the Great War]], Castle serves as an army photographer in the trenches of France. He is photographing corpses with his assistant Roy (Phil Davis) when a mortar lands close by. Roy returns to the trenches but Castle seems unconcerned and continues photographing. He returns to the trenches just before the mortar explodes.  After the war, Castle and Roy run a photographic studio in London. Castle specialises in photographic trick work, including photomontage. He attends a lecture at the [[Theosophical Society]], where [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] is examining a projected image of the [[Cottingley Fairies]]. Conan Doyle seems convinced they are genuine, but Castle stands, publicly debunks the image and hands out business cards to the audience.  At his studio, Castle is visited by Beatrice Templeton (Frances Barber), who shows him a photograph of her daughter. She is convinced that a mysterious shape is a fairy, but Castle dismissed the idea. However, he investigates the photograph, sees the shape laterally reflected in the girl's eye and makes multiple large prints to discover how the picture was made. Unable to explain or debunk the photograph, Castle hastily travels to see Beatrice in a village called Birkenwell, where upon arrival he sees and recognises Templeton's daughters, Ana (Miriam Grant) and Clara (Hannah Bould), and follows them to their home. Beatrice tells Castle that the photograph no longer mattersshe has seen the fairies. She asks him to meet her at ''the great tree'' in Birkenwell Woods the following day.  At the appointed time, Castle walks to the great tree, where Beatrice is waiting. Before he arrives, she removes her hat and shoes then climbs the tree. When he arrives, Castle discovers Beatrice's removed clothing, then finds her lifeless body on the ground. After making a statement at the local police station, Castle encounters the Templeton girls, who are greeted by their father Nicholas, a Christian minister.  Nicholas reluctantly allows Castle to remain since the girls seem to like him and he is concerned about their behavior. Castle discovers that Beatrice had been documenting her daughters' odd behavior, and in her notes finds that she had been experimenting with a distinctive rare flower. Having already noticed Ana and Clara consuming the flower themselves, Castle takes some himself and discovered that it allows him to see the fairies that Beatrice and her daughters saw.   Castle calls in his business partner and assistant to set up a photo shoot using his most advanced equipment. After consuming the flower again and having them photograph the experience, Castle concludes that fairies do exist, and that the flower allows the brain to slow down enough so that they can be seen and interacted with, as they normally move so fast that only the most advanced of cameras can photograph them. Castle's obsession comes to a head when one day, a fed-up Nicholas starts burning his equipment; although Castle is too deep under the flower's influence to initially care, he flies into a rage when some of the fairies drift too close and catch fire. Castle assaults and kills Nicholas and is subsequently arrested.   Refusing to defend himself, Castle is found guilty and sentenced to hang, while Ana and Clara are put into foster care, though they seem to care little about the situation. Castle bids farewell to his associates and faces his death without fear. The final scene returns to the Alps, where Castle is trying to save Anna-Marie. This time he is successful in pulling her back up to the path, and they embrace and continue walking. <ref name="VHS">{{cite AV media  | people = [[Nick Willing]] (Director)  | year = 1997  | title = Photographing Fairies  | medium = VHS Film  | publisher = [[Entertainment Film Distributors#Entertainment in Video|Entertainment in Video]]  | location = England, Switzerland, Elstree Studios  | id =  }}</ref>

Pingu at the Wedding Party
 Pingu is helping Father deliver the mail. Pingu wakes up a penguin to deliver a parcel, but he’s puzzled to receive it. Then his neighbour comes out and says it’s for her, so Pingu grabs the parcel back and gives it to Mother, who is delighted to get the letter, as it’s an invitation to a wedding. Pingu shows the photo to Father, who gets out Mother and Father's wedding album with the green penguin friends and shows it to Pingu and Pinga.  Mother and Father go to get a present, leaving Pingu and Pinga at home playing weddings. They’re shown a remotely operated Roomba, which they decide to get. The cleaner and remote are put on the table, and Pingu is intrigued. Mother then comes in and tells Father that she needs a new hat, so they go out to get one, and leave Pingu and Pinga alone at home again. Pingu touches the control stick, and the parcel moves. Pinga comes over to watch, as Pingu pushes the stick on the remote control full forward. The parcel takes off and hovers like a helicopter. Pingu finds that pulling the stick back makes it land. Unfortunately, when the parcel lands it over-balances and falls off the table, landing upside down and getting dented.   On the day of the wedding everything is ready, and the guests who have arrived are chatting. Father and Grandfather chat to some of the other guests, and Mother and Pinga go to coo over an egg in a cradle being looked after by its mother. Pingu spots Robby, who is there as photographer and is polishing the camera, which is on a tripod. Robby taps the camera and the tripod collapses, which makes Pingu laugh. Pingu is looking at some flowers when he’s called over by one of the green penguin family. She introduces Pingu to her son, who is about Pingu’s age. The son greets Pingu by making rude noises, swaying from side to side, slapping Pingu on the back and shaking hands.  As it nears the time of the wedding they all go to anxiously look out for the groom, who hasn’t yet arrived. The minister keeps looking at his watch. Then crying distracts them; the egg has hatched, and they all go to look at the baby. Meanwhile, Pingu is called over by Pongi’s son, and they go and look at the cake. The green penguin and Pingu both naughtily sample the cake, and Pingu patches it up so it’s not so obvious what has happened to it. Then the bride spots the groom and the others turn to look. The groom is momentarily distracted when his tie covers his eyes, causing him to crash into a block of ice, which sends him and the bouquet flying. He ends up sitting on the ice next to the bride, who catches the bouquet as it bounces off his head. Later they open the dented [[Roomba]], which goes haywire by sucking up the bride’s bouquet, and the groom attacks it with a stick. The Roomba spins its antennae like a helicopter and takes a little flight. It nearly hits Pingu's father, who drops the remote control, causing it to drop down to earth and break. Pingu takes the blame, and the green penguin's son comes and collects the sucked-up bouquet and drops it on the ground. Then he fixes the Roomba and it functions like normal. Everyone is now pleased.  Robby takes a photograph of the wedding party and the bride and groom leave on a sledge.  
The Place of the Dead
 The film largely tells the story of the expedition itself, but occasionally flashes to the present where the members of expedition are giving evidence in a military court. The enquiry is to determine which members were at fault for the failure of the expedition, meaning that the story is told in flashback as the men remember it. Initially, the soldiers are shown training while a voiceover by expedition leader Lt. Col. Robert Niell ([[Simon Dutton]]) tells us that there will be five [[British Army]] soldiers, two [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] soldiers and three Hong Kong Chinese soldiers on the expedition.  When the expedition starts, it becomes clear that the level of fitness among its members varies greatly. Lance Corporal Richard Mayfield ([[Dougray Scott]]), who is also the technical advisor on the expedition, expresses serious concern about the group's ability as a whole. Later that night, Niell feels that it is an appropriate time to "discuss things". Sergeant Bob Mann ([[Ralph Brown]]) suggests that the fitter members of the team continue on with the expedition as planned while the weaker members climb back down the mountain, drive to a village at the other end of the valley and work their way back up the river as a support group. Niell rejects the plan, leading to a confrontation between him and Mayfield.  The next day, Corporal Hugh Brittan ([[Greg Wise]]), Mayfield, Lance Corporal Steve Page (David Nellist) and Lance Corporal Peter Shearer (Phil McKee) make a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]]. Brittan, now the most senior of the four soldiers, says that Niell wanted to use the morning as a resting period for the others. By nightfall, only Mann has caught up with the advance party. He explains that the rear party, now consisting of the supposed leaders of the expedition and three inexperienced Chinese soldiers, have already set up camp further down the mountain. Once again, Mayfield expresses serious concern, saying that "it's taken them fifteen hours to do a journey that took us three and they're still not here." He also highlighted how the rations had been carefully planned and wouldn't last if there were any more delays.  The next morning, Mayfield quickly climbs back down the mountain to where Niell, Major Ron Foster ([[John McArdle]]) and the three Chinese soldiers are camped to get permission from Niell to abseil into Low's Gully (which means going over 'The Point of No Return'). Niell agrees, but tells him to wait at the bottom. Mayfield protests, saying that he can only wait for a limited time. Exactly what happened in this conversation is left unclear. When Mayfield gets back to the top, Shearer makes it clear that he feels the advance party should wait. As the senior NCO, Brittan decides that if Mayfield wishes to abseil without the rear party, then they shouldn't wait.  After abseiling down, the advance party decide not to wait for their own safety and on the assumption that the rear party will not be able to abseil down. Shearer looks up at the cliff face with binoculars and finds the others but it isn't clear if they are moving up or down. Once again, he makes it clear that he wants them to wait but Mayfield claims that they must be going back up while Brittan says that "if they are coming down, we waste at least two days waiting for them to catch up. If they're going up, we waste if for nothing. I don't think we can take the risk."  Neill and Foster manage to get the Chinese soldiers down and into the gully, but find that the others haven't waited. Brittan leaves them a note saying 'The advance party wishes you a pleasant journey. Keep smiling!' This angers Neill and Foster. Tensions are also rising in the advance party, especially between Shearer and Brittan.  During an abseil, the rope becomes loose, causing Shearer to fall and badly injure his head. Fortunately, his legs aren't broken, meaning he can still walk. Nonetheless, the accident affects his strength and ability to continue. Mann also has an accident; when struggling through the undergrowth, he slips and badly cuts his hand on his machete. The cut becomes infected and starts to smell like "rotting meat". All members are becoming psychologically affected by the ordeal, something that isn't aided by the shortage of food.  By this point, Neill and his party have realised that they are trapped in the gully without Mayfeild's technical expertise. They cannot continue without him, nor can they climb back up. They were running out of food and could only hope that someone had raised an alarm and was looking for them. However, Lance Corporal Yiu Keung 'Kevin' Cheung had been secretly conserving food in case of an emergency and gave some to Neill and Fostor.  Meanwhile, one morning Mayfield and Mann go on ahead but are told by Brittan to wait if they come to a fork in the track. When the other three reached a fork, they weren't to be seen. Mayfeild and Mann claimed to never to have seen a fork in the track.  Eventually, after much climbing, Brittan, Shearer and Paige reach the river and eventually make their way out of the valley, exhausted and hungry but glad to be alive. After ensuring that Shearer (who had also sustained an injury from a leech around his eye) was in hospital, Brittan and Page arrived at the hotel only to find that nobody else had booked in.  Back in the jungle, Mann is on the verge of a breakdown. Having recorded most of the ordeal on his video camera, he makes a goodbye message to his son Robert (he had previously named a waterfall after him) in a very emotional scene. Soon after Mayfeild finds Mann lying on the floor on the verge of giving up, telling him that he has found a way out. The two men emerge into a village where they are given food and water. An elderly woman treats Mann's infected wound with a traditional herbal medicine which appears to completely and instantly cure it.  After they have been driven into town, Mayfield and Mann meet with Brittan and Page. Page angrily accuses them of abandoning an injured man "because you thought he'd hold you back". After Page leaves, Brittan explains to them that Neill had led his party into the gully after all and was now trapped in there. Nobody had raised the alarm however, as nobody knew they missing. Neill hadn't even given a finishing date to the authorities. Brittan remembered that Neill had planned to stay close to the river throughout the expedition and advised the search and rescue teams of this. By flying the helicopter low and examining the river, the rear party are eventually found.  Back in the present, Neill openly accuses Brittan and Mayfeild of condemning him to a "slow death by starvation". Mayfeild counters this by saying Neill shouldn't have brought along the Chinese soldiers. Brittan stated that he made the right decision but for the wrong reasons: had he waited for them they'd all have become trapped and no one would have looked for them, resulting in all their deaths. However, he didn't know this when he made the decision.  The film concludes by stating that Neill and Foster were severely criticised and that their leadership had been "flawed and over-ambitious". Meanwhile, Corporal Brittan, Lance Corporal Mayfeild and Lance Corporal Yiu Keung 'Kevin' Cheung all received commendations for their actions during the ordeal.

The three young girls live as sisters, but the more rambunctious Ivy is bored by their childish games of tea and rejoices at Ivan's unexpected early day return from the office, saying, "There's going to be fireworks."  Ivy's prediction soon comes true. Ivan catches Rebecca in bed with the handsome pool boy, and the two men scuffle. As Ivan tends to his wounds, he and Rebecca begin a loud argument about their adulterous affair. The shouting brings Catherine's attention from the garden. Upon learning of the affair, she immediately evicts Rebecca and her children.  In 1996, Violet, now a beautiful, matured woman, returns to the Greer home and is reunited with Joy for the first time in eleven years. Violet states that she is looking for a summer time residence while working as a waitress at [[Denny's]] Restaurants and planning to attend the local junior college. Joy suggests that she reside with them and stay in the late Catherine's room. Joy is an amateur tennis star and engaged to her boyfriend from [[Yale University]], Michael, who will be working as an intern for Joy's father's bank.  During a late night party, Violet feels isolated and ridiculed by Joy's Ivy League friends, and excuses herself for late shift work. Afterward, Michael takes Joy to her room and initiates foreplay, only to be rejected. He accuses Joy of being sexually frigid, and insultingly says he understands her father's infidelity. As Michael is on his way out, he runs into Violet, who is dressed in a sadomasochistic costume, which causes him to question her employment at [[Denny's]]. Violet states that the two have gotten off on the wrong foot, and proceeds to perform oral sex on him.  Violet's obsession with Joy motivates her to destroy all of her other relationships. When her tennis partner, Jaimie comes over to practice with Joy, Violet spikes their drinks with alcohol and then undresses into her bra in bed with the unconscious and handcuffed Jaimie, convincing her the two have just engaged in sex. A horrified, half clothed, and handcuffed Jaimie flees the Greer house, thus ending their friendship.  Michael is Violet's next target. While by the Greer pool, she convinces him Joy has been unfaithful and seduces him into sex, while she provides him with cocaine to reignite his former addiction. Michael is not appreciative of her vices and vows never to see her again, thereby confirming her prejudiced belief that all men are uncaring and deceitful.  Ivan is the next to be seduced as Violet sabotages his date when she swims topless in his pool, and dresses in his late wife's clothing. Despite his attempts to resist her allure, she seduces him into sex later that night.  The Greers' housekeeper, Mrs. B, quickly catches on to the recent events, and makes enemies with Violet in her attempts to thwart her schemes.  Michael confronts Violet while she is "street walking". He then reveals to her that he has lost his internship at the bank because of drugs and that he knows of her schemes, including working as a sadomasochistic prostitute, her false employment at [[Denny's]], and her dark family history including the death of Ivy (alluding to the original film). He threatens that she must leave the Greers' before he tells Joy the truth.  When Michael arrives at the Greers' later that day, Violet knocks him unconscious, ties him to a bed and [[gag]]s him, and injects him with a lethal dose of drugs, killing him.  Joy returns from a failed tennis match distraught at the recent drama of events, only to learn of Michael's death and walk in on her father and Violet in sadomasochism. As Joy flees, Ivan tells Violet she must leave, to which she accuses him of repeating the abandonment of her mother. She hides the drugs for Ivan's heart condition and places him in the garage fatally poisoning him with carbon monoxide by leaving a car engine running.  After a drive, Joy returns that same night, to now discover Mrs. B is also murdered. Violet induces Joy to dress up and play tea like they did when they were children, where they will commit suicide by drinking poison. Joy violently resists by splashing the poison on Violet's face, and the two wrestle around the room. Violet attempts to stab Joy with a pair of scissors, but Joy is able to knock her back before she strikes. Joy races out of the room to the stairway, where she leans on the banister and cries out for help. Violet regains her senses and goes to resume her attack. Violet is spun around by Joy and begins to lose her balance at the top of the stairs. Joy grasps the end of Violet's pearl necklace to keep her from falling.  Still holding on to the pearl necklace, Joy pleads with Violet to reach out and take her hand. Instead Violet leans her head back; the necklace shatters and Violet's feet slip, causing her to fall backwards down the stairs. Violet lies motionless at the bottom of the stairs, lifeless. Joy calmly exits the mansion. The loss of her entire family circle is saddening, but it may provide her with the opportunity to begin anew, and leave behind the darkness of her family past.

Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin
 The story begins on the last day of summer. Christopher Robin is unable to tell his friend Winnie-the-Pooh some sad news, and leaves him with the advice, "You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think," but Pooh does not clearly understand. The next morning, Pooh discovers a honey pot with an attached note—however, he cannot read it himself after getting honey all over it. He goes around to his friends Piglet, Tigger, Rabbit and Eeyore, and none of them are able to read the note, so they ask Owl for help. From misinterpreting the note and his own romantic imagination of adventure, Owl deduces that Christopher Robin has been taken to a distant, mysterious and dangerous place called "Skull" against his will, to a cave where the monstrous "Skullasaurus" resides. Owl equips the group with a map and sends them into the "Great Unknown" of the Hundred Acre Wood.  During their journey through the Great Unknown, as they are seemingly hunted by the Skullasaurus, the group slowly begins to realize just how helpless they are without Christopher Robin in the outside world. Piglet, Tigger, and Rabbit come to believe they do not have the courage, strength, or intelligence respectively to go on; Piglet is abducted by a swarm of butterflies in a tranquil field, leaving him feeling scared and helpless, Tigger plummets into a deep gorge and is unable to bounce out to safety, causing his friends to fall with him, and Rabbit continuously makes poor leadership decisions following Owl's inaccurate map. Pooh tries to comfort them each with the advice Christopher Robin had given him, but fails due to his inability to remember what he said. When Rabbit finally breaks down, admitting he has no idea where they are going, the group comes to terms with the fact that they are lost and helpless without Christopher Robin, and take shelter in a nearby cave. While everyone is asleep, Pooh laments on getting no closer to finding Christopher Robin.  The next morning, the five friends realize they had spent the night in the Skull Cave. The group enters and splits up to find Christopher Robin, and though Rabbit, Tigger, Eeyore, and Piglet eventually reunite, they are scared away by Pooh's distorted reflection as he walks towards them from behind a crystal wall, mistaking him for the Skullasaurus. Pooh slides down and gets stuck in a small gap in the cave's crystals, and the four others find the "Eye of the Skull" where Christopher Robin supposedly is trapped. Believing Pooh to have been eaten alive by the Skullasaurus, they rise past their fears and doubts and make their way to the Eye of the Skull. Upon seeing his friends' bravery, Pooh excitedly frees himself from the crevasse, only to slide down a rock and be trapped in a deep pit where he is unable to find a way out. While there, he realizes that Christopher Robin is still with him in his heart, even when they are not together, just as Christopher had promised. After Piglet, Rabbit, Tigger and Eeyore enter the Eye, they are found by Christopher Robin who has been searching for them as well. He reveals that he was only at ''school'', and the roars of the Skullasaurus they have been plagued by are actually the noises of Pooh's tummy rumbling.  After Christopher Robin rescues Pooh from the pit, the six exit the Skull Cave, only to discover that from the outside, it and all the other locations on the map were not nearly as big, nor as scary as they seemed. They return home, and that evening, Christopher Robin says he will return to school the next day. Pooh declares that he will always be waiting for him, and the two happily watch the sunset, knowing they will always have each other in the sanctuary of the Hundred Acre Wood.

The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but its corruption curses his right arm. The curse gives him superhuman strength, but will eventually spread through his body and kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god, Nago, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands Nago came from, but he cannot return to his homeland.  Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo ("Jiko-bō" in the original Japanese version), an opportunist Buddhist monk, who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant "[[Daidarabotchi|nightwalker]]" by night. Nearby, men herd oxen to Irontown ("Tataraba" in Japanese), led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro. Riding one of the wolves is San, a human girl. Ashitaka discovers two injured Irontown men and carries them through the forest, where he encounters many [[Kodama (spirit)|kodama]] and glimpses the Forest Spirit. In Irontown, Ashitaka learns that Eboshi built the town by [[clearcutting]] forests to claim [[ironsand]] and produce iron, leading to conflicts with the forest gods and Asano, a local [[daimyō]]. Irontown is a refuge for social outcasts, including [[Leprosy in Japan|lepers]] employed to manufacture firearms; it was one of these guns that had wounded Nago. Eboshi also explains that San was raised by the wolves as one of their own and resents humankind.  San infiltrates Irontown to kill Eboshi, but Ashitaka intervenes, knocking them both unconscious. As he leaves, he is shot by a villager, but the curse gives him the strength to carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her that she is beautiful. She takes him to the forest, and decides to trust him after the Forest Spirit saves his life. A boar clan, led by the blind boar god Okkoto, plans to attack Irontown to save the forest. Eboshi prepares for battle and sets out to kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo, who is working for the government; she intends to give the god's head to the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] in return for protection from Lord Asano. According to legend, the Forest Spirit's head grants immortality.  Ashitaka recovers from his wound but remains cursed; he returns to Irontown to find it besieged by [[samurai]], and heads out to warn Eboshi. The boar clan is annihilated in battle, and Okkoto is corrupted by his wounds. Jigo's men disguise themselves in boar skins and trick the rampaging Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop Okkoto, but is swept up in his demonic corruption. Moro intervenes and Ashitaka dives into the corruption, saving San. The Forest Spirit [[Euthanasia|euthanizes]] Okkoto and Moro. As it transforms into the nightwalker, Eboshi decapitates it. It bleeds ooze which spreads over the land, killing anything it touches as the nightwalker searches for its head, which Jigo steals. The forest and kodama begin to die; Moro's head comes alive and bites off Eboshi's right arm, but she survives.  After the samurai flee and Irontown is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit. The Spirit dies as the sun rises, but its form washes over the land and heals it, and Ashitaka's curse is lifted. Ashitaka stays to help rebuild Irontown, but promises San he will visit her in the forest. Eboshi reunites with the townspeople and vows to build a better town.

The Rainmaker (1997 film)
 Rudy Baylor is a graduate of the [[University of Memphis]] Law School. Unlike most of his fellow grads, he has no high-paying job lined up and is forced to apply for part-time positions while serving drinks at a Memphis bar.  Desperate for a job, he is introduced to J. Lyman "Bruiser" Stone, a ruthless but successful ambulance-chasing lawyer, who makes him an associate. To earn his fee, Rudy is required to hunt for potential clients at a local hospital. He meets Deck Shifflet, a less-than-ethical former insurance assessor-turned-paralegal who has failed the [[bar exam]] six times. However, Deck is resourceful in gathering information and an expert on insurance lawsuits.  Rudy has a case of [[insurance bad faith]] which could be worth several million dollars in damages. When Stone is raided by the [[FBI]], Rudy and Deck set up a practice themselves. They file suit on behalf of a middle-aged couple, Dot and Buddy Black, whose 22-year-old son, Donny Ray, is dying of leukemia, but could have been saved with a bone marrow transplant, denied by their insurance carrier Great Benefit.  Rudy passes the Tennessee bar exam but has never argued a case before a judge and jury. Now he finds himself up against a group of experienced lawyers from a large firm, headed by Leo F. Drummond, an attorney who uses unscrupulous tactics to win his cases.  The original judge, Harvey Hale, is set to dismiss because he sees it as a so-called "lottery" case that slows down the judicial process. But a more sympathetic judge, Tyrone Kipler, takes over when Hale suffers a fatal heart attack. Kipler, a former civil rights attorney, immediately denies the insurance company's petition for dismissal.  While seeking new clients, Rudy meets Kelly Riker, a battered wife whose husband Cliff's beatings have put her in the hospital. Rudy persuades Kelly to file for divorce, which leads to a confrontation with Cliff that results in the abusive husband's death. To keep Rudy from being implicated, Kelly tells the police she killed her husband in self-defense. The district attorney declines to prosecute.  Donny Ray dies, but not before giving a video deposition at his home. The case goes to trial, where Drummond gets the vital testimony of Rudy's key witness, Jackie Lemanczyk, stricken from the record. Nevertheless, thanks to Rudy's determination and skillful cross-examination of Great Benefit's president, Wilfred Keeley, the jury finds for the plaintiff.  It is a great triumph for Rudy and Deck, until the insurance company declares bankruptcy, allowing it to avoid paying punitive damages. There is no payout for the grieving parents and no fee for Rudy.  Deciding that this success will create unrealistic expectations for future clients, Rudy decides to abandon his new practice and teach law. He and Kelly leave town together.

Rebirth of Mothra II
 Off the coast of Japan, the environment has been ravaged with poisonous starfish-like creatures called Barem.  Meanwhile, the Elias sisters, Moll and Lora, survey the destruction and enlist the help of three children, who had just discovered and befriended a strange little creature dubbed "Ghogo" to help find the mysterious treasure of Nirai Kanai, an ancient lost civilization, to save the Earth from the declining environment.  The Elias then tell the children that the people of Nirai Kanai created a monster called Dagahra as a method of pollution management gone wrong and only [[Mothra|Mothra Leo]] can stop it; however, he will need the help of the lost castle of Nirai Kanai itself and the mysterious treasure within.  Belvera, the evil Elias sister, manipulates two fishermen to get the treasure for herself.  They all journey to the lost castle hidden beneath the ocean waters, and it magically rises out of the water when the travelers discover it.  Dagahra, awakened after a sudden increase in pollution levels, then releases a swarm of Barem into the sea, killing many types of sea life.  Moll and Lora call Mothra Leo, who nearly succeeds in defeating Dagahra, until the sea monster takes the battle underwater where it is in its element. Dagahra incapacitates Leo by covering him with Barem. Leo lands on the newly raised Nirai Kanai temple, but before Dagahra can give the killing blow, the structure activates and defends Leo. With Leo covered in Barem and powerless, Dagahra goes on a destructive rampage.  Inside the temple, Moll, Lora and the three kids attempt to find the treasure, while Belvera and the two mind-controlled fishermen try to thwart their mission. After stealing some jewels they've found, the fishermen inadvertently unlock a gateway and awaken the Princess of Nirai Kanai. The Princess tells the three Elias sisters that Earth must be protected and saved, that the children are the hope of future generations, and reveals that Ghogo is the lost treasure.  Moll and Lora then use Ghogo's energy to revive Mothra Leo and, as a result, turn the hero into Rainbow Mothra.  Leo is then able to destroy the Barem covering his body. After taking a severe beating, Dagahra once again retreates into the water, where Rainbow Mothra turns into Aqua Mothra. This time Rainbow Mothra's new form allows him to overpower the sea monster. He finally finishes his battle with Dagahra by splitting into thousands of miniature Aqua Mothras; entering Dagahra's body and destroying the Barem producing there, and without the Barem, Dagahra self-destructs.  Meanwhile, the temple begins to collapse.  With the building crumbling over them, Moll and Lora ride onto Fairy to safety, while Belvera releases control of the fishermen, who help the children escape.  The Princess raises Dagahra's body and drops it onto the temple, reducing everything into a wave of water. Aqua Mothra then returns to his single form, and then back into Rainbow Mothra; saving the world once again.  
Ratchagan
 Ajay ([[Akkineni Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna]]) is an unemployed youth who always gets into trouble because of his temper. He gets heated up when he encounters anyone committing a crime; he takes the law into his own hands, beats them up and then gives them some free advice. Ajay’s father Padmanabhan ([[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]]), who works for an insurance firm, is very unhappy with his son’s attitude, and tries his best to change his attitude through a meditation expert, but fails in this matter as the expert suggests that Ajay's anguish is reasonable. Ajay meets Sonia ([[Sushmita Sen]]) through his father, and she falls in love with him. What Sonia likes about Ajay is his temper and anger when he encounters anything, which is against the law. Sonia gets Ajay’s father's help to get Ajay to love her. Still, Ajay is not interested in her and seriously rejects her at first; but he later changes his mind after going through some unusual situations, and love blossoms between them.  Sonia’s father Sriram ([[Girish Karnad]]) is an industrialist who owns the [[Daewoo]] automotive manufacturing facility. He has no objection to his daughter’s relationship with Ajay but has one condition: Ajay must become employed in his factory, control his temper for three months, and not get into any fight whatsoever, even if he encounters a crime happening in front of his eyes. If Ajay cannot do this, he will not be allowed to marry Sonia. With a heavy heart, Ajay agrees to the condition; Sonia's love for Ajay deepens and Sriram offers Ajay a job in his factory. Sriram actually has his own problems with his factory in a loss; ten of his workers are working with his rival and younger stepbrother Gnaneswar ([[Raghuvaran]]), and they hamper the progress of his factory with frequent, pre-planned mishaps. This leads to the factory's property loss.  Gnaneswar is the son of Sriram's stepmother, who gets deceived by Sriram and loses his share of his father's common business empire. Further, in unusual circumstances, Gnaneswar spends some years in jail and returns with a planned conspiracy and vengeance on his stepbrother Sriram. Gnaneswar is now trying to put Sriram out of business, so his ten men create havoc in the factory by killing old ''workers'' and raging new workers. So when Ajay comes to work in Sriram’s factory, these ten men do the same to Ajay. Ajay keeps cool, trying to keep his promise to Sriram. But Sriram hopes otherwise; he wants Ajay to break the promise and beat up the ten men and throw them out of the factory. At the same time, Sriram hopes the imminent marriage between Ajay and Sonia will be canceled, since he does not want his daughter to get married to an angry street fighter like Ajay. So Sriram keeps hoping Ajay will somehow burst out. Gnaneswar's men damage an important machine to make the international Korean experts attend the problem. The plan is to kill those Korean experts so that it would become an international issue and Sriram's company would be locked out permanently, but Ajay saves those experts, and Sriram publicizes this to create a fight between Gnaneswar's men and Ajay, but it happens otherwise that Ajay still keeps cool in spite of them beating him black and blue, and Sriram's hope devastates. As a last trigger, Sriram uses his father's name in publicizing the issue in factory to media so that Gnaneswar's men may think that it was Ajay's father who brought this to media. As expected by Sriram, those ten men brutally murder Ajay's father for this.  After this, Ajay becomes furious and breaks his promise and banishes the ten men from the factory. But Gnaneswar holds Ajay and blackmails Sonia that he would kill Ajay unless Sonia kills herself by destroying Sriram's factory by bombarding it with a truck armed with a powerful Russian explosive. In the climax, Gnaneswar kills Sriram by throwing him off the helicopter; Gnaneswar gets killed when his helicopter hits the mountains; and Sonia gets saved and unites with Ajay.

Ravager (film)
 There was no way for Avedon Hammond ([[Yancy Butler]]) to foresee the impending crisis. As command pilot of the I/P/T transport ship Armstrong, a space-weary NASA discard now used routinely in sub-orbital transport runs, the attractive, highly proficient pilot has her hands full. Upon entering the ship to prepare for liftoff, she's chagrined to find that her flight has been reassigned to another command pilot, Cooper Wayne ([[Bruce Payne]]), a daredevil she knows all too well—as an ex-lover from whom she just had to walk away. Avedon is further annoyed to find that the flight is another "mystery run," no paperwork, no flight plan, and a handful of passengers on what should be a cargo carrier.  The eclectic riffraff of passengers includes Lazarus (Salvator Xuereb), a two-bit hustler; Dr. Shephard ([[Robin Sachs]]), a skilled former micro-surgeon now addicted to his own self-prescribed medications; Cade (David Stratton), an edgy young man obsessed with finding the wife who deserted him; and Sarra ([[Juliet Landau]]), a flawlessly beautiful young woman with a mysterious past. About the only "stand-up guy" aboard is chief engineer Mick 'Clean' McClean ([[Stanley Kamel]]), a technical genius who's called upon regularly to repair just about every system on board the tired ship.  After takeoff, two booster rockets become obstructed and the Avedon is forced to crash land in a desolate, uncharted region of the South Asian desert wracked by seismic tremors. While trying to recover tridymite to fabricate new flight data circuit boards, the crew stumbles upon an underground military depository for advanced biological weapons.  One of the passengers gets infected by the weapons and turns into a zombie with murderous proclivities. Avedon and Cooper attempt to protect the other passengers and get the plane repaired and to safety as soon as is possible.<ref>http://www.100percentent.com/ravager.htm</ref>

The Relic (film)
 John Whitney, an [[anthropologist]] for the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]], studies a tribe in [[South America]] and drinks a soup made by the tribesmen. Shortly after, Whitney accosts a merchant ship captain, asking him to remove the cargo he had intended to send to Chicago off the ship. Unwilling to delay the ship's departure, the captain refuses and Whitney sneaks aboard. Not finding his cargo, he cries out. Six weeks later, the ship arrives on [[Lake Michigan]] with its crew missing. [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago PD]] [[homicide detective]] Lieutenant Vincent D'Agosta and his partner, Sgt. Hollingsworth, investigate the ship and find dozens of bodies and severed heads in the [[bilge]].  Dr. Margo Green, an [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]], arrives at work at the museum. She and her mentor, Dr. Frock, examine Whitney's crates. The crates are empty, except for a bed of leaves and a stone statue of the "Kothoga", a mythical forest monster. Margo notices a fungus on the leaves and sends it to be analyzed. That night, security guard Frederick Ford is murdered like the ship's crew. D'Agosta suspects a connection. Believing the killer is still inside the museum, he orders it closed until the police have finished searching. Dr. Ann Cuthbert, the museum director, protests and mentions an important upcoming exhibition.  Margo discovers the fungus contains concentrated [[hormones]] found in several animal species. In the container of leaves, she finds a mutated beetle that possesses both insect and reptilian DNA. Ford's autopsy reveals that his [[hypothalamus]] was extracted from his brain, like the bodies from the ship. In the museum's basement, the police are startled by a mentally-ill, homeless ex-convict and kill him. Finding Ford's wallet on him, everyone except D'Agosta considers the case closed, though Mayor Robert Owen and the museum’s head of security Tom Parkinson forces D'Agosta to let the exhibition proceed.  On the opening night, D'Agosta orders a lock-down of all museum areas except the main exhibition hall. Dr. Frock and Margo, trapped in the laboratory wing, continue working and discover Ford's killer is after the hormones on the leaves. D'Agosta and several officers search the basement tunnels once again. They are attacked by an unseen creature, killing K-9 Officer Bradley and a police dog. D'Agosta tells Hollingsworth to evacuate the museum, but he is too late. In the main hall, the headless body of a murdered policeman falls into the crowd, causing a panic. During the hysteria, the museum's alarms are tripped and their security system goes haywire, trapping a small group of people inside. Two security guards try to restore the power but are killed by an unseen creature.  D'Agosta meets Margo and Dr. Frock in the lab, where a Kothoga, an enormous [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeric]] beast, attacks them; they close a steel door to stop it. Margo theorizes the fungus mutated a smaller creature, and Dr. Frock says that without the leaves to eat, the Kothoga instinctively seeks the closest substitute, human [[hypothalami]], until it runs out of targets and dies; he further postulates that the tribe knew of the fungus, and used it on a human or animal to deal with an external threat, then hid until the threat was destroyed and the Kothoga died of "starvation." D'Agosta finds a radio and tells Hollingsworth to lead the museum guests out via an old coal tunnel. Tom, Lee, and the Blaisedales’s refuse to go; the Kothoga returns to the main hall and murders them and the [[S.W.A.T.]] officers who enter through the skylights.  Margo suggests using [[liquid nitrogen]] to kill the Kothoga, as it is part-reptilian and likely [[ectothermic|cold-blooded]]. While collecting the remaining leaves in the lab, Margo and D'Agosta discover Dr. Frock has been killed. In the sewers, D'Agosta uses the leaves to lure the Kothoga away from the coal tunnel, allowing the guests to escape, though Bailey is killed. However, liquid nitrogen has no effect on the creature. Margo and D'Agosta flee. In the lab, her computer completes the analysis of the creature's human [[DNA]], revealing Whitney is the Kothoga, mutated after drinking the tribesmen's soup.  The Kothoga smashes into the lab through the ceiling, while D'Agosta is locked outside. The creature chases Margo, corners her, and suddenly pauses, seemingly recognizing her. Margo starts an explosive fire that destroys the Kothoga, surviving by hiding inside a [[maceration (bone)|maceration]] tank. As dawn comes, D'Agosta and a team of police break into the lab, see the charred remains of the Kothoga, and rescue Margo from the tank.  
Regeneration (1997 film)
 The film starts by referring to [[Siegfried Sassoon]]'s open letter [[s:Finished with the War: A Soldier’s Declaration|(Finished with the War: A Soldier’s Declaration)]] dated July 1917, inveighing "against the political errors and insincerities for which the fighting men are being sacrificed". The letter has been published in ''[[The Times]]'' and has received much attention in England particularly because Sassoon is considered a hero for several (perhaps suicidally rash) acts of valour - and has been the recipient of the [[Military Cross]] which we see Sassoon throwing away. With the string-pulling and guidance of [[Robert Graves]], a fellow poet and friend of Sassoon, the army decides to send Sassoon to [[Craiglockhart Hydropathic|Craiglockhart War Hospital]], a psychiatric facility in Scotland, rather than court-martialling him. At Craiglockhart, Sassoon meets [[W. H. R. Rivers|Dr. William Rivers]], a Freudian psychiatrist who encourages his patients to express their war memories as therapy.  There is no clear main character in this film, but there is more focus on several of the characters; notably, [[Billy Prior]], Siegfried Sassoon and Dr. Rivers himself. A very important secondary character, [[Wilfred Owen]], is linked to Sassoon’s storyline.  Prior, at first an unsympathetic character, presents a challenge to Dr Rivers, who needs to discover what experience in the trenches caused the loss of Prior's ability to speak.  Prior regains his speech suddenly then goes into the town in search of female companionship and begins a relationship with Sarah, a munitions worker.  He has a strong sense of social class, setting himself apart from the other officers ("public school toffs") and refers to incidents that have caused him to mistrust the military authorities. There are a number of references to the difference in treatment between the privates and the officers, including the most glaring, Craiglockhart itself which only caters for officers. When Prior is finally ready for hypnosis, he and Rivers discover that his trauma was caused by the death of one of Prior's men in the trench, blown to bits by a bomb. Prior lost his power of speech after having picked up the eyeball of the killed private and asked what should be done with "this gobstopper". This seems strange to Prior who had expected his condition to be caused by some action for which he was responsible. He feels he has to return to active duty in the trenches to prove to himself and the world that he is as fully competent as before.  Sassoon becomes friends with another patient in the hospital, Wilfred Owen. Owen aspires to be a poet as well and he greatly respects Sassoon's work; Sassoon agrees to help Owen with his poetry.  Meanwhile, Doctor Rivers has taken a leave of absence from the hospital and visits Dr. [[Lewis Yealland]]’s practice in London. Dr. Yealland treats his patients, who are privates and not officers, not like traumatised human beings but like mere machines, which need to be repaired as quickly as possible. Rivers sits in on one of Yealland’s electroshock therapy sessions on a private named Callan, who, like Prior, has lost his speech. Rivers is repulsed by the brutality of the treatment, and back in Craiglockhart he continues to produce what Sassoon calls his "gentle miracles" but at the cost of his own mental health - in contrast to Yealland who seems to feel nothing towards his patients but is proud of his success in treating mutism.  Sassoon has also come to a very important decision. Although he still disagrees with the reasons for the continuation of the war, he decides to return to France in order to care for his men.  During the Review Board’s evaluation of Sassoon, Rivers is surprised by Sassoon's insistence that he hasn't changed his mind. As such he still fulfills the qualification of mental illness that landed him at Craiglockhart. On the other hand, Sassoon did not truly qualify as mentally ill in the first place, and he strongly wishes to return to the war. When his opinion is needed, he qualifies Sassoon as being fit, and thereby qualified to return to war. Sassoon is seen soon after being injured whilst in a trench and laughing - to the bemused consternation of his men. The ambiguity of this scene (as to the seriousness of the injury) is only resolved when Rivers reads a letter from him after the end of hostilities.  In the meantime, Prior goes before the medical board and is assigned to home duties, probably because of his asthma, which means he cannot be sure in himself as to whether he is truly cured. He is last seen in bed with Sarah.  The final scenes show Wilfred Owen's body in France after the end of the conflict and Rivers' sadness on hearing of it. He is seen crying as he reads Owen's "The Parable of the Old Man and the Young" that Sassoon sent him. The visual motif of moving through a canal tunnel which has been Owen's dream is now resolved. Unlike other patients' dreams which are the shocking visualisations of the traumatic events which resulted in their breakdowns, Owen's is the premonition of his own death.

Robinson Crusoe (1997 film)
 The film opens to a fictionalized [[Daniel Defoe]] being offered to read a castaway's autobiography. He grudgingly obliges and begins to get engrossed in the narrative.  Robinson Crusoe ([[Pierce Brosnan]]) is a Scottish gentleman with experience in the [[Royal Navy]] and the British army. He accidentally kills his lifelong friend Patrick ([[Damian Lewis]]) in a duel over his childhood love Mary. Patrick's brothers arrive and threaten Crusoe, but his [[Page (occupation)|page]] manages to buy time for an escape. Fleeing back to Mary, Crusoe subsequently ends up leaving for a year so that Mary can attempt to smooth over relations with Patrick's family.  Crusoe joins the [[merchant marine]] transporting assorted cargoes between ports in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans. He chronicles the ship's journeys at the behest of the captain until a [[typhoon]] shipwrecks him near the coast of [[New Guinea]].  On his first day ashore on the island he buries other crew members who had washed up on the surrounding beaches. The next day he headed to the ship, which had beached itself on a reef. He salvages tools, supplies and weapons from the ship. Crusoe also frees the captain's [[Welsh Corgi|corgi]] Skipper from a supply room. Crusoe begins to acclimate himself to the island while hoping for a passing European ship. One day a ship finally appears, but Crusoe notices it too late to be rescued. Crusoe resolves to acclimate himself to the island and moves inland, building a shelter and growing food.  One day he hears ominous drums and human voices. Investigating the noises he finds a tribe from a nearby island making human sacrifices. After two prisoners have been sacrificed Crusoe intervenes by firing his weapon, which allows the third prisoner (played by [[William Takaku]]) to escape. Later he meets the escaped native and attempts to befriend him. Cultural and language barriers prevent him from communicating before they are attacked by a group of the tribesmen. He witnesses the native cut out the heart of a defeated enemy and calls him a savage heathen before fleeing to his shelter and preparing a defence.  Days later Crusoe falls into a snare laid by the native. Crusoe communicates the danger and potency of his firearms on a bat, which allows them to begin communicating. He names the man Friday and has himself referred to as Master. Within six months Friday has learned the basics of English, but when Crusoe attempts to convert him to [[Christianity]], Friday refuses and an argument ensues. Friday separates himself from Crusoe. Missing the companionship, Crusoe attempts to make peace with Friday.  Reunited, the two set a trap for the tribe of natives who attempted to sacrifice Friday before. Once they arrive Crusoe lights a fuse leading to a load of gunpowder, but Skipper chases after the lit fuse and also dies in the explosion. At Skipper's funeral Crusoe gains a deeper appreciation for Friday's religion.  Later Crusoe decides they must leave the island due to an impending attack by the native tribe. Friday mentions that he has heard of [[New Britain]]. He says he cannot take Crusoe to his home island because he is considered dead for being a sacrifice and he cannot go to New Britain because the Europeans enslave his people. Friday subsequently learns that "Master" is not Crusoe's real name, but an indicator of enslavement and once again leaves Crusoe, who subsequently attempts to build a canoe to get to New Britain by himself.  A typhoon arrives while Crusoe has nearly finished his boat. Friday returns and accepts that Crusoe had decided not to make him a slave. The two attempt to salvage their crops and wildlife, but the typhoon destroys them – as well as Crusoe's canoe. The pair set traps to defend the island, but expect to die in the defence.  The tribesmen arrive in force. Crusoe and Friday manage to defend the island, but Crusoe is shot by an arrow. Friday decides to try to save Crusoe by taking him to his home island. Upon arriving there Friday's tribe capture Crusoe, believing him to have come to enslave the people. They force Crusoe to fight Friday to the death for his freedom. After sparing Friday, Friday is about to land a killing blow when he is hit by a bullet. But Crusoe becomes upset because Friday was his friend. A European scout party rescues Crusoe and returns him to Scotland where he is reunited with Mary.

Romy and Michele's High School Reunion
 Romy White and Michele Weinberger are two friends living together in a [[beachfront]] [[apartment]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Romy works as a [[cashier]] in the service department of a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] [[Car dealerships in North America|dealership]]; Michele is unemployed. They are both single and unambitious and enjoy the LA lifestyle. Romy encounters former high school classmate, Heather Mooney, who informs Romy about their upcoming 10-year high school reunion back in [[Tucson, Arizona]].  At first excited at the prospect of attending, Romy then has the realization that they will not be able to make a good impression at the reunion. Desperate to impress their former classmates, Romy and Michele make last-ditch attempts to improve themselves to avoid the bullying they endured, mostly at the hands of the "A-Group", led by [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] Christie Masters.  In a series of flashbacks from 1987, Romy and Michele's suffering is revealed; Christie attached magnets to Michele's back brace and once took a bite out of the burger Romy was eating. Christie humiliated them once again at the prom, telling Romy that her handsome [[jock (athlete)|jock]] boyfriend, Billy Christensen, was in love with Romy and has now broken up with Christie to be with her. Christie tells Romy to wait for a dance with Billy. Christie and Billy then ride away together, unbeknownst to Romy, who patiently waits all night long at the dance for Billy. In tears, Romy then dances with Michele in a depressed state.  Failing in their attempts to get jobs and boyfriends, Romy and Michele decide to simply pretend they have been much more successful by showing up in an expensive car and business suits. Romy obtains a nice car from the Jaguar dealership, and Michele makes their outfits.   On the way to the reunion after making the realization they had not thought of what kind of business women they were, they decide to claim that they invented [[Post-it note]]s, reasoning that their true origins are obscure. Romy wants to state it was her idea to invent Post-Its and Michele's main contribution was deciding they should be yellow, which Michele takes as an insult to her intelligence. This leads to a further argument about who's the cuter of the two. The argument results in their decision to go their separate ways once they reach their destination.  When they arrive, Michele hears Romy saying that she invented Post-its all by herself. Michele convinces the A-Group girls that she invented a special kind of glue, explaining the glue's complicated formula in great detail. Sandy Frink, the nerd who had a crush on Michele in high school, turns out to be incredibly wealthy and gorgeous and hits on Michele, while Billy and Romy reunite and hit it off. Both Romy and Michele win awards as the most successful members of their graduating class. Though still refusing to speak with each other, they look back at each other with longing.  Seventy years later, an elderly Michele learns that Romy is on her deathbed, so she calls her to make amends. However, they rehash the same argument. Romy dies, flipping her the [[middle finger (gesture)|bird]], and they never get a chance to resolve their issues.   Michele wakes up alone in the car in the present day, disturbed by the previous dream sequence. At the reunion, Romy has begun to spread her story. Heather Mooney disrupts their lie by revealing the real name of the person who did in fact invent Post-It notes (something Heather learned in business school). The A-Group girls begin a vicious verbal attack on Romy. Michele ineptly defends her. Christie further humiliates the two in front of everyone by revealing Romy's lie; Romy runs out, with Michele chasing after her.   Michele then tells Romy that she genuinely thought that their lives were wonderful just the way they were, before Romy said that they were not good enough. Michele also says that they should not care what everyone else thinks. They change into fun, stylish outfits they've designed, and return to the reunion, determined to have some fun at any cost.   They confront Christie about her bullying. Romy says she no longer cares about Christie because Christie is just "a bad person with an ugly heart". Christie makes fun of their clothes; former classmate Lisa Luder, an ex-member of the A-Group who has since become a fashion editor for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', sees things differently, and announces that the outfits are actually very well made and overall "not bad". Christie begins to attack Lisa, but Lisa coolly dismisses her in front of the crowd that has gathered to watch. The other A-Group girls defect and Christie is left by herself, while everyone else makes their way over to congratulate Romy and Michele. Heather apologizes to Romy and Michele and tells them that the two of them had actually made her unhappy in high school, for she had been in love with Sandy. Romy and Michele then make her feel better by saying that she too had the luxury of making someone miserable, referencing former classmate and reunion committee head Toby Walters, to whom Heather was always cruel in high school.  Sandy Frink then arrives via [[helicopter]], and turns out to be a [[billionaire]] who made his fortune from inventing a special shoe [[rubber]]. He goes over to talk to Romy and Michele. Michele tells Sandy that he must be the most successful person in their class; Sandy responds that despite all the wealth and success he has, the one thing he doesn't have is her, and asks her to dance with him. Michele agrees, so long as Romy can dance with them too.  After an [[interpretive dance]] to [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]" that receives huge applause, Sandy escorts them to his helicopter.  Heather walks out, not interested in the new Sandy. While smoking, she encounters a mysterious classmate dressed as a cowboy. Heather remembers that in high school, he would often offer her a light by silently flicking lit cigarette butts at her. This time, Heather demands that he talk to her. The cowboy lights her cigarette with a lighter and apologizes for his previous behavior, stating that he had suffered from a speech impediment in high school.  Romy and Michele leave with Sandy. On their way out, they encounter Billy Christensen, who is now Christie's husband; he is now an alcoholic, with a dead end job (exposing Christie’s lie she told Romy about Billy being a successful real estate developer), overweight, living in an unhappy marriage with Christie, and is unsure if he's the father of her latest pregnancy. When he propositions Romy, she tells him to go up to his hotel room, get undressed, and wait for her. He excitedly shuffles off; Romy laughs, having finally settled the score with Billy. They board the helicopter and see Heather down below amongst some bushes, making out with the cowboy.  Six months later, back in Los Angeles, Romy and Michele use money loaned to them by Sandy to open their own fashion boutique. Heather has stayed in touch and has become friends with the girls, shopping in their store (and finally getting an outfit that's not all black).  
Rosewood (film)
 Mann is a mysterious World War I veteran who is scouting out land to buy. He comes to the town of [[Rosewood, Florida|Rosewood]], a small predominantly black town in Florida. Rosewood is home to the Carriers, an upwardly mobile black family, helmed by Aunt Sarah and her proud, headstrong son, Sylvester. Mann soon meets Beulah "Scrappie" Carrier, Sylvester's younger sister and the two quickly fall in love.  Aunt Sarah works as a housekeeper for James Taylor and his wife, Fanny, a white couple who live in the neighboring town of Sumter. Fanny, who has a history of [[cuckold]]ing her husband, has a rendezvous with her lover while her husband is at work. Fanny argues with her lover, who ends up beating her. Aunt Sarah and her granddaughter, Lee Ruth, overhear the argument and subsequent beating but do not intervene. A distraught Fanny, despairing of explaining her injuries to her husband, leaves her house and calls for help. She then tells several townspeople that she has been attacked by a black man. The white residents readily believe Fanny's claim. Hearing of an escaped black convict, a posse from Sumner and nearby towns go to Rosewood to investigate. The black residents of Rosewood quickly become targeted by a white mob, including men from out of state and members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  As a stranger, Mann is afraid of being accused and subsequently [[lynching|lynch]]ed. He plans to leave town over the protests of several Rosewood residents who have met in church to discuss plans to defend their community. Outside the church, Mann clashes with John Wright, the owner of a general store, one of the few white residents of Rosewood. Wright is also engaging in a torrid extramarital affair with Jewel, a black woman. Mann then leaves.  When the posse arrives at the Carrier home, Aunt Sarah attempts to placate the angry crowd. However, when she announces that Fanny Taylor's attacker had been a white man, someone in the crowd shoots her. She subsequently dies of her injuries. The posse comes and Sylvester shoots and kills them. After Aunt Sarah's murder, the posse launches an outright assault on Rosewood. Mann is on his way out of town when he witnesses the lynching of Sam Carter, the blacksmith. Changing his mind about leaving, Mann returns to Rosewood to fight alongside the residents. Some white men who live in Rosewood help black Rosewood residents escape. Railroad conductors smuggled people out of town on trains. Wright asks the train conductors to pick up the women and children while his wife hides several other African-Americans in their home. Other whites attempt to squelch the rising violence with little success.  The posse swells in number. Believing that James Carrier held information about the escaped convict, they seek him out. After making an unsuccessful attempt to intervene on James' behalf, Wright reluctantly allows Sheriff Walker take Carrier into custody because the officer said he only wanted to question him. When Carrier says he doesn't have any information, he is immediately shot by one of the mob. Wright gets upset and the mob accuses him of being soft on blacks.  The violence escalates and spills out into neighboring towns. But when the posse get to the border of Alachua County, a group of armed white men block the roads and turn them back. Surviving members of the Carrier family eventually escape. Scrappie and Mann finally share a kiss before Mann departs with Sylvester. The two plan to meet up later. After the violence eventually dies down, James confronts Fanny, telling her that "they haven't caught your nigger yet." Realizing that Fanny has lied to him about the true cause of her injuries and had affairs with other men, James beats her. Officially the death toll was eight people total, two whites and six blacks. Other accounts by survivors and several African-American newspapers were of a higher toll.

When he quits his menial but stable job to pursue his art career, his girlfriend Tallulah (Coffey) is furious. They break up and Ansel spends his days creating horrible art (like a puck floating in urine) and trying to earn government grants.  Meanwhile, Talluah is being driven crazy by her upstairs neighbour who constantly plays [[Eric Clapton]]'s "Layla"  at a loud volume. Banadek ([[Richard Sali]]) is Ansel's former co-worker and dishwasher. He spends the course of the film talking about the process of dishwashing. To him it is a religious experience.

Eventually, they come to a realization about themselves, and their roles in each other lives.  
RocketMan
 [[NASA]] is training for the first [[manned mission to Mars]] by the spacecraft ''Aries''. Due to a supposed glitch in the computer navigation system, NASA looks for the original programmer of the software to see why the software seems to be broken. Fred Z. Randall ([[Harland Williams]]), the eccentric programmer who wrote the software, meets Paul Wick ([[Jeffrey DeMunn]]), the flight director of the Mars mission; William "Wild Bill" Overbeck ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]), the commander of the Mars mission; and astronaut Gary Hackman ([[Peter Onorati]]), the computer specialist. After a display of hard-headed stubbornness by Gary, he is hit in the head by a model of the ''Pilgrim 1'' Mars lander, resulting in a skull fracture. NASA decides to replace him instead of delaying the mission. Fred is brought to NASA to see if he has what it takes to be an astronaut; he, along with Gordon Peacock, go through a series of exercises, which sees Fred do well, even going as far to break every record that Bill had. In the end, Fred gets the job.  While getting ready to board the ''Aries'', Fred chickens out and refuses to go on the mission. Bud Nesbitt ([[Beau Bridges]]), who Wick claims is the cause of the [[Apollo 13|Apollo 13 accident]], tells Fred about the three commemorative coins given to him by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]]. He gave one coin to [[Neil Armstrong]], another to [[Jim Lovell]], and finally shows Randall a gold coin reading "Bravery". "It hasn't done me much good," Bud says, "Maybe it'll mean something to you one day." Randall then quotes the Cowardly Lion from [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']]: "If I were king of the forest!"  Fred, along with Commander Overbeck, geologist Julie Ford ([[Jessica Lundy]]), and Ulysses, a trained [[chimpanzee]], will look for fossils on Mars. To save on resources, crew members are put into "hypersleep" for eight months while the ship heads towards Mars. Ulysses purposely takes Fred's "hypersleep chamber" for his own and Fred has to sleep in Ulysses' chimp-shaped chamber. He sleeps for only 13 minutes and has to stay up for eight months. While looking at Mars weather data, Fred notices severe sandstorms that could endanger the crew. He contacts Bud in Houston and tells him about the storms that are forecast to hit the landing site. If the crew get caught in the storms, they could be lost forever. Bud tells Wick about the situation but Wick ignores him. The crew makes it to Mars, after Overbeck barks at Fred for being awake the whole time and using all the food—except food that the former despises ([[anchovy (food)|anchovy paste]], [[liver (food)|creamed liver]], and [[gefilte fish]])—for painting. They land the ''Pilgrim'' on the Martian surface. As Overbeck prepares to be the first human to step on Mars, Fred slips from the ladder and lands first.   A day after the crew lands, the sandstorms arrive ahead of schedule. After almost losing Overbeck and Ulysses in the sandstorm, the crew lifts off from the Martian surface. Wick is replaced by Bud when it becomes clear that Wick does not trust his NASA crew. The ship has almost made it out of the sandstorm when rocks kicked up by the wind hit the lander. ''Pilgrim 1'' loses power and begins to spin out of control. Fred has to rewire the entire system, reboot it and power everything back up in less than two minutes or they will crash. With less than 20 seconds, he has to complete the circuit. He frantically searches for something and finally shoves the commemorative coin into the slot, allowing the lander to regain power. The crew safely return to the ''Aries'' orbiting Mars. Fred (now known as "RocketMan") asks Julie to dance with him in [[zero gravity]] to "[[When You Wish Upon A Star]]" while dancing in clothes made from the space blankets Randall cut up during his accident with the sleep pod.  As Fred gets ready for hypersleep one last time, Ulysses climbs into his hypersleep chamber once again, forcing Fred to stay up for another eight months on the journey back home.  In a [[post-credits scene]], the crew's flag pole on Mars is shown missing its flag. It is revealed that Randall's [[American flag]] boxers, which were earlier used as a replacement for the original flag, had been stolen by a [[Martian]].

The Saint (1997 film)
 At the [[Ignatius of Loyola|Saint Ignatius]] Orphanage, a rebellious boy named [[Saint Giovanni Battista de Rossi|John Rossi]] refers to himself as "Simon Templar" and leads a group of fellow orphans as they attempt to run away to escape their harsh treatment. Just as Simon is caught by the head priest, he witnesses the tragic death of a girl he had taken a liking to when she accidentally falls from a balcony.  As an adult, Simon ([[Val Kilmer]])—now a professional thief dubbed "The Saint" for using the names of [[Catholic saint]]s as aliases—steals a valuable microchip belonging to a Russian oil company. Simon stages the burglary during a political rally held for the company's owner, Ivan Tretiak ([[Rade Šerbedžija]]). Tretiak is a former Communist party boss and a billionaire oil and gas [[Business oligarch|oligarch]] who is rallying support against the [[President of the Russian Federation|Russian President]]. Simon is caught in the act by Tretiak's son Ilya ([[Valery Nikolaev]]) but escapes with the microchip. After learning of the heist, Tretiak contacts Simon and hires him to steal a revolutionary [[cold fusion]] formula discovered by American [[Electrochemistry|electrochemist]] Emma Russell ([[Elisabeth Shue]]). He wishes to acquire Emma's formula—which creates clean, inexpensive energy—so he can monopolize the energy market during a severe oil shortage in Russia.  Using the alias "[[Thomas More]]", Simon poses as a [[South African]] traveller and steals the formula after having a [[one night stand]] with Emma. Tretiak learns Emma's formula is incomplete and orders his henchmen, led by Ilya, to kill Simon and kidnap Emma in order to obtain the remaining information. Heartbroken, Emma reports the theft to [[Claud Eustace Teal|Inspector Teal]] ([[Alun Armstrong]]) and Inspector Rabineau ([[Charlotte Cornwell]]) of [[Scotland Yard]], who inform her Simon is a wanted international thief. Emma tracks down Simon to a hotel in Moscow and confronts him about the theft and his betrayal. The [[Police of Russia|Russian police]], loyal to Tretiak, arrest Simon and Emma. However, they manage to escape from the police van as they are being brought to Tretiak's mansion.  As they flee through the suburbs, Simon and Emma are helped by a prostitute and her family who shelter them in a hidden room in their home. Later, they meet "Frankie" ([[Irina Apeksimova]]), a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]/[[Black Marketeer (criminal)|black marketeer]] or [[Spiv]] who sells them the directions through an underground sewer system that lead to the American embassy. Simon and Emma exit the sewer tunnel only to find Ilya and his men waiting for them among a gathering of protestors outside the embassy's front gates. Emma safely makes it to the embassy for [[political asylum]], while Simon allows himself to be caught by Ilya as a distraction. He escapes after rigging a [[car bomb]] that severely burns Ilya.  Simon plants a listening device in Tretiak's office and learns he plans to stage a ''[[coup d'état]]'' by selling the cold fusion formula to Russian President Karpov to frame him for wasting billions on useless technology. Tretiak then plans to use the political fallout to install himself as President. Emma finishes the equations to complete the formula, and Simon delivers the information to Tretiak's physicist, Dr. Lev Botkin ([[Henry Goodman]]), who builds an apparatus which proves the formula works. Simon infiltrates the President's [[Kremlin]] residence and informs him of Tretiak's conspiracy just before Tretiak loyalists detain him. In front of a massive gathering in [[Red Square]], Tretiak makes public accusations against President Karpov, but when the [[cold fusion]] reactor is successfully initiated, Tretiak is exposed as a fraud and arrested. He is also revealed to have caused the heating oil shortage in Moscow by illegally stockpiling vast amounts of heating oil underneath his mansion.  Sometime later, at a news conference at the [[University of Oxford]], Emma presents her cold fusion formula to the world. Simon attends the conference in disguise and once again avoids being captured by Inspectors Teal and Rabineau when they spot him in the crowd. As he drives away, he listens to a news radio broadcast (voiced by [[Roger Moore]]) reporting that $3 billion was recently donated to the [[Red Cross]], [[Salvation Army]] and the [[United Nations Children's Fund]]. It is implied that Simon, who had access to Tretiak's accounts, donated the money anonymously. Furthermore, a non-profit foundation led by Dr. Botkin is being established to develop the cold fusion technology.

Same Old Song
 Odile (Azéma), a business executive, is married to weak, furtive Claude (Arditi). In the past Odile was close to successful businessman Nicolas (Bacri), now married with kids and returning to Paris after an eight-year absence. She is looking for a new, bigger apartment from estate agent Marc (Wilson). Her younger sister Camille (Jaoui), has just completed her doctoral thesis in history and is a Paris tour guide. Simon (Dussollier) is a regular on Camille's tours because he's attracted to her, although he claims to be researching his historical radio dramas. Camille has fallen for Marc, and they begin an affair. Nicolas is also looking for an apartment, since he hopes to eventually have his family join him in Paris.   The most original feature of this "musical" is that characters break into songs as sung by the original artists,<ref name="mov"></ref> i.e. depending on the circumstances, a female character may all of a sudden start singing in a male voice and vice versa. The judicious choice of songs and variety of styles make for some very funny surprises, considering the complete and voluntary absence of transitions between the talking and singing. The film's debt to [[Dennis Potter]] is acknowledged with a dedication in the opening credits.  
Sangam (1997 film)

Intertwined in this main conflict there is a second conflict which opposes the view of a traditionalist  priest (Ignacio Lopez Tarso) who sides with the Spanish-speakers and a more liberal priest who better understands the synchretism between [[Roman Catholicism]] and Indigenous beliefs. Both priests are [[Roman Catholic]] in charge of the parishes of the neighbouring towns.  The main conflict in the film explodes when the Mayordomos of Yohualichan decide to present a Theatrical representation of an ancient text, part in Nahuatl and part in Spanish, called the "Colloquium of the Adoration of the King". The Catholic priest of Yohualichan accuses the Nahuas of blasphmey since the text is over the discussion between the Archangel Michael and Santo Luzbel, seeing them as equals instead of good & evil.

After Gale forcibly confronts Sidney with Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale.  Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface murders fellow student [[List of Scream characters#Casey "Cici" Cooper|Cici Cooper]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]). After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attacks Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, prompting the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims.  That afternoon, while Gale is talking to Dewey and Randy on the campus lawn, she receives a call from Ghostface hinting that he is watching them. They search for him, but Randy, who tries to keep the killer on the phone, is dragged into Gale's broadcast van and is murdered by Ghostface.

Sidney goes back to the campus and finds Derek in the auditorium tied to a crucifix, his mouth gagged with duct tape. Once Sidney unties him, she is confronted by Ghostface, who reveals himself as Mickey and kills Derek. Mickey details his plan to become famous in the ensuing trial and media spectacle. He then announces his real partner, Debbie Salt, who arrives holding Gale at gunpoint.

Mickey explains that they met online and that Mrs. Loomis agreed to pay for Mickey's tuition fee while Mickey does the actual killing. Mrs. Loomis betrays Mickey and shoots him, as she plans to blame the murders on Mickey. Before he collapses, Mickey accidentally shoots Gale, causing her to fall off the stage.  Sidney and Mrs. Loomis fight, until Cotton intervenes and eventually shoots Mrs. Loomis in the throat. As they debate whether or not she is dead, they find Gale still alive. Mickey suddenly jumps to his feet, trying to attack them, only to be shot by Sidney and Gale in the head. Sidney then shoots Mrs. Loomis in the head to confirm her death. When the police arrive the next morning, Gale finds Dewey badly injured but still alive and accompanies him to the hospital. Sidney instructs the press to direct questions to Cotton, rewarding him with the fame he has been chasing while removing the attention from herself as she leaves the university campus.

However, Mowgli also has enemies in the jungle: [[Shere Khan]] the vicious tiger (who killed the boy's father) and the [[Bandar-log]] (who are hated by nearly all animals of the jungle).  After being found by Shere Khan and running away, Mowgli hears a train coming his way on the train tracks. The conductor stops the train when Mowgli is seen by humans. An American circus scout named Harrison, who is traveling through India along with Chunchandra, also takes a look at Mowgli. He thinks of bringing the man cub to America and taking him to the circus. Mowgli runs away and steals Chuchandra's pet monkey Timo. Mowgli bonds with Timo, which forces the wolf pack to exile him, as Timo is thought to be a relative to the Bandar-log. The next day, Mowgli enters the Ancient city and finds Timo being kidnapped by the Bandar-log. When he and Baloo attempt to rescue him, Baloo is caged by the Bandar-log.  Meanwhile, Harrison has sought the help of a wealthy jungle guide named Buldeo. Buldeo is none other than Mowgli's paternal uncle: he knows that with Mowgli alive, he may be denied access to his late brother's wealth. The men soon meet a snake charmer, Karait, and his pet python, [[Kaa]]. Buldeo leads the men into the jungle to capture Mowgli, but secretly has plans to murder him. Using Kaa, the men kidnap Mowgli and take him to their camp. That night, Mowgli escapes during a battle with Shere Khan.

The Second Civil War
 The film is set in a [[United States]] in which foreign [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] has skyrocketed:  The mayor of [[Los Angeles]] speaks only in Spanish, [[Rhode Island]] is populated mostly by [[Chinese Americans|Chinese-Americans]], and [[Alabama]] has a congressman from [[India]].  Politics is openly reduced to a matter of catering to various ethnic groups for their votes - the Alabama congressman will only support the U.S. President if his state receives more money for [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temples. When an atomic weapon is used in [[Pakistan]], an international organization makes plans to bring orphans to [[Idaho]].  [[Idaho]] Governor Jim Farley (Bridges) orders the state's [[Idaho National Guard|National Guard]] to close its borders, as Idaho has already received more than a million refugees; he acknowledges this even though the Governor himself routinely indulges in Mexican food, Mexican soap operas, and an affair with a [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]] reporter (Peña).  Despite the best efforts of his press secretary Jimmy Cannon (Kevin Dunn), Farley remains largely oblivious to the national crisis he's the center of, since Farley is more concerned with rekindling his romance with his mistress rather than dealing with national matters.  Meanwhile, the [[President of the United States]] (Hartman) turns out to be an equally ineffectual leader, ruthlessly exploiting immigration to fill districts and states with those most likely to vote for his own party.  He will move more [[Koreans]] to [[New York (state)|New York]] since Koreans are one of his core constituencies. Reputed as indecisive, the President delegates his decision-making entirely to his advisors, most notably his unofficial chief advisor, [[Lobbying|lobbyist]] Jack B. Buchan (Coburn).  Buchan, however, is less concerned with the good of the nation, and more concerned with politics, especially how the President's actions will play on television (resulting, for example, in a 72-hour deadline being shortened to 67 hours to prevent the news from interrupting [[Susan Lucci]]'s farewell appearance on the [[soap opera]] ''[[All My Children]]'').  Buchan regularly influences the President's decisions by manipulating his desire to emulate previous U.S. presidents, even going so far as to pepper presidential statements with fictitious "quotes" from President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  Meanwhile, the NN cable network is reporting the events and influencing them at the same time.  News director Mel (Dan Hedaya) attempts to time events to maximize ratings, while his staff becomes polarized over the political issues involved in the conflict between the Governor and the President.  Standard fare for the cable network is to show footage of crying immigrant children, which is done with the Pakistani orphans waiting to move to Idaho.  As the deadline approaches, the Governor and the President call in, respectively, the Idaho National Guard and the [[United States Army]].  Tensions rise when the commanders of both units turn out to be bitter rivals from the [[Gulf War]].  Meanwhile, governors from other states send in their own National Guard units to aid one side or the other, causing the conflict to escalate into the national arena. Mexican-American pro-immigrant rioters bomb the [[Alamo]], while anti-immigrants retaliate by bombing the [[Statue of Liberty]] because of its plaque, stating that "We no longer want your tired, your poor or your huddled masses."  Eventually, the Governor's girlfriend convinces him to back down from the conflict and resign, but a series of misunderstandings and mutinies leads to a major battle between anti- and pro-immigrant armed forces at the Idaho border, culminating with the president's decision to invade Idaho in what becomes the [[Second American Civil War]].  At the movie's close, news reports indicate that hostilities have ceased, but the immigration issue is unresolved.

Search for the Beast
 The film opens with an implied soft-core sex scene involving two teenagers who are camping in the wilderness of Okaloosa. A [[Bigfoot]]-like creature invades their campsite and kills the two. The next five minutes of the film play like a faux-documentary with a narrator, Dr. David Stone (Rick Montana) explaining the story of the Bigfoot. The film then changes to a normal movie, and the father of one of the victims, Milton St. John ([[David F. Friedman]]) asks Stone, as the leading expert on the Bigfoot, to lead an expedition in an effort to capture the Bigfoot before it can kill more people. Stone does not want to capture the beast, but agrees to try to take photos and videos of the creature.  The next day, Stone's graduate assistant, Wendy (Holli Day), convinces Stone to let her come along on the expedition. Stone agrees and takes Wendy into his office to show her some grainy footage he previously took of the Bigfoot. Stone and Wendy, along with four colleagues (Dan, Jay, Bob, and Darlene) depart in a van to begin the expedition, but stop along the way to ask directions of a guitarist, Crazy Joe. The group hike fifteen miles to their campsite. When they arrive, they set up camp and exchange monster stories. Stone and Wendy share a tent, where she confesses she has had a crush on him since she was an [[undergraduate]].  The next morning, Stone and Wendy discover the others have gone out looking for the beast save for one of St. John's hired hands, Dan. Stone leaves Dan and Wendy to look for the others, but Bob and Jay are killed. Dan assaults Stone and takes Wendy hostage for unexplained reasons. He ties Stone up and, with Wendy and Darlene at gunpoint, forces them through the forest. Stone escapes and encounters a group of Dan's henchmen, who he deals with. Dan abandons Darlene and Wendy escapes and finds Stone. Dan is killed by the Bigfoot while Stone and Wendy escape in a truck driven by Crazy Joe.

Egged on by Rubberneck, Harry fatally chokes two prostitutes (mutilating and having anal sex with their bodies afterward) and stabs his psychiatrist to death.  As his mind deteriorates, Harry confesses to Rubberneck that his parents neglected, beat, humiliated and raped him throughout his childhood, and that he murdered his father when he tried to leave him and his mother. Harry kills Drew during an argument about his impotence, rapes her body, and eats one of her breasts. While experiencing another psychotic episode, Harry assaults a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]], and castrates and shoots his partner-in-crime. By this point, the authorities realize a serial killer is running amok.

A Simple Wish
 Oliver Greening is rejected from a coveted performance in a musical version of ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' for simply not being a bankable performer. After Oliver's 8-year-old daughter Annabel attempts to get her 12-year-old brother Charlie to believe that the [[tooth fairy]] exists, Murray, a clumsy fairy godfather, appears after Charlie has gone to sleep. Annabel wants to wish for her father to get the role, but Murray suddenly remembers he is late for an important engagement and promises to return to grant her wish later.   Hortence ([[Ruby Dee]]), the head of all fairy godmothers, is holding the annual meeting of the North American Fairy Godmothers Association (NAFGA). Due to Hortence's rule, all the fairy godmothers must check in their wands before the meeting. Claudia, a former fairy godmother turned evil witch, has shown up at the meeting uninvited and intends to steal all the wands. She gives Hortence's receptionist, Rena ([[Teri Garr]]) a witch's apple that puts her to sleep, casts a spell on Hortence turning the head fairy paper-thin and binding her mouth with bricks, and locks all the fairy godmothers downstairs on her way to stealing the wands. Murray, however, arrives at the meeting late and never checks his wand, leaving it as the only wand Claudia doesn't have.  Annabel realizes that Murray has left his magic wand behind and decides to return it to him, but Charlie breaks it. Murray and Annabel disappear to [[Nebraska]], by way of a misconstrued spell cast by him to get out quickly. After he tries and fails to turn a selfish motel owner they meet there into a giant rabbi, the two end up back in [[Central Park]]. Because of Annabel's disappearing in an unexplained way, the school closes early. Charlie finds them.  Annabel begs Murray to try to grant her wish now that they are close to her father, but due to yet another mishap by him, Oliver is turned into a statue. To fix the problem, the three of them go to NAFGA and ask for the help of Hortence, who is still under the effects of Claudia's spell. While Murray, Charlie and Rena (who has awoken from Claudia's sleeping spell) fix Murray's wand, Hortence tells Annabel of Claudia's plot and explains that the awry spell must be lifted before midnight, or Oliver will be doomed to remain a statue forever. Claudia, meanwhile, has been looking through the wands, searching for hers. After going through, she realizes it is missing and now belongs to Murray, and she is determined to obtain it.  Annabel and Murray head to the theater and see Tony Sable, the selfish and conceited actor who is auditioning for Oliver's part. Knowing this could ruin her father's chance of being in the show, she asks Murray to sabotage the audition any way he can. First he tries to make it rain on the stage but it is dismissed as a simple technical problem and the audition continues. Then she asks him to give Sable a frog in his throat to impair his singing. He takes this wish too literally, and frogs start hopping out of Sable's mouth, shocking the cast and crew. Annabel and Murray celebrate, but Sable gets the part since Oliver has not shown up. Boots, who has been looking for Murray, finds them. Murray mentions the story of [[Brer Rabbit]] to Annabel and they beg her not to take them to Claudia's lair so she will.  Claudia catches them, and demands them to tell her where her wand is. When Murray tries to persuade Annabel otherwise into not telling her, as punishment, Claudia changes her and Murray into [[ballerina]]s and makes them dance uncontrollably until Annabel agrees to tell her. However, Annabel is able to keep Claudia distracted until Charlie can return with the wand, Murray winning Boots' allegiance long enough to convince her to give him the wand. Claudia attempts to attack him, but Murray is able to trick her into firing a spell that draws her into a mirror, which is subsequently shattered.   Murray, Charlie, and Annabel return to Central Park and restore Oliver just in time. He is given the part of Sable's [[understudy]] thanks to a producer who enjoyed his audition. In order to finally grant Annabel's wish, Murray appears backstage and causes Sable to slip on a bucket, and twist his ankle. The resultant temper tantrum gets him fired and Oliver, his understudy, is cast in his place. Charlie and Annabel watch the show with Murray and the other fairy godmothers including Hortence, who is now free from Claudia's spell.  
Sindhooram
 The movie begins with a cadre of police constables on their way home from election duty. As they discuss their lives, their van is blown up by a gang of Naxals.  Bulliraju ([[Brahmaji]]) is in training to become a police officer. He is hot blooded and has a strong sense of justice. Buliraju is from a small village close to the Godavari river.  Chanti ([[Ravi Teja]]), Bairagi, Satipandu and others are wayward youth who reside in the same village. They spend their time playing cards, drinking and teasing girls. They are all friends with Buliraju. Few of them are also naxals and pass information of the ongoings of the village to Naxalites who live in the nearby forest. The Naxals use this information to fight injustice.  Baby ([[Sanghavi]]) and Lakshmi are girls in the same village. Baby is in love with Buliraju and Lakshmi is in love with Chanti. Also in the village are various other characters such as landlords, policemen, doctors, farmers and day laborers.  Buliraju returns in the middle of his police training to find that the local policemen act more like the henchmen of the rich rather than defenders of the people and justice. When Satipandu is suspected of being a closet Naxal and is picked up by the police, Buliraju too is picked up too as he tries to defend his friend. The SI shoots and kills Satipandu and later in an altercation, Buliraju accidentally shoots the SI.Buliraju is thus branded as a Naxal and eventually becomes the leader of the group,despite having no interest in Communism/Maoism or Vigilantism. Buliraju brings a different approach to naxalism, as he is more focused on delivering justice to the people rather than spread a communist/Maoist ideology. In a way he turns the Naxal gang into a vigilante gang. To the police however, they are all the same, as they have taken the law into their own hands.  He becomes a symbol of law and order in the 30 surrounding villages and is seen as a form of alternate government.  Buliraju's training officer ([[Bhanu Chander]]) is designated the task of wiping Naxalism from the area. He sees Buliraju as an outlaw who joined police training to learn their secrets. He vows to bring Buliraju to justice.  One day, Bairagi is betrayed by an illegal arms dealer and is captured. Buliraju kidnaps the local minister (chalapati) in an effort to get Bairagi back. Buliraju's gang is already decimated by various forces such as poisoned water, police encounters, weather and the elements of the forest. They fight on despite the fact that they are running out of ammunition. The police is on their trail for the kidnapping of the minister. Eventually the police catches up to them and most of the die with heavy casualties on both sides.  The overall message of the movie is that when people have nothing to lose, they will not shy away from taking the law into their own hands.When the common man is denied justice from official channels, he will seek justice from whoever will give it to him. Justice is as important to the sustenance of a society as food and water.When justice becomes a luxury, society turns to chaos and death becomes a way of life.When a government doesn't provide  the kind of justice that society needs, society will try to snatch for it as easily as a drowning man will grasp for breath.

Six Ways to Sunday
  Eighteen-year-old Harry ([[Norman Reedus]]), is an innocent, bashful burger boy who lives with his overly attentive mother Kate. Harry's father left the family sometime before the events of the film, leaving Kate for another man. They live in a ratty old apartment, where Kate treats her son like a child, even going as far to draw his bath water and connect a wire to his reading lamp, shutting it off when Harry is busy to get his attention. One day, Arnie ([[Adrien Brody]]), Harry's oldest and best friend, goes to a strip club, where the boss owes Arnie's mob boss money. Harry watches as Arnie beats the owner, and snaps, releasing his rage out on the owner, pummeling him to the point where Arnie has to pull Harry off to avoid killing him. Outside, both are visibly shocked by Harry's outburst, but Harry is shocked and confused at the fact that he liked it. Not long after, Arnie's boss Abie Pinkwise, meets the two at a local diner, where he remarks how much potential Harry has in the mob business. He invites Harry to become his apprentice, and Harry accepts. After leaving, Arnie attempts a heist at a small store, but backfires when the clerk holds him at gun point, sending him to jail. When Harry is told to ditch a car (evidence in a homicide), by his bosses, he leaves evidence (a magazine with his name on it), and a witness. He is arrested but is proven to be loyal to his employers by keeping silent, despite being beaten by the police. Now trusting him, the bosses get him out of jail and take him out to celebrate at a brothel. When alone with one of the women, Harry is unaroused, and timidly asks the prostitute if he seems normal. When he answers that he doesn't feel that way for neither men nor women, she gently replies that she isn't the kind of professional he should be talking to. He goes home dejected, and when his mother smells perfume on him the first signs of her jealous tendencies begin to show.  As the months pass Abie shows Harry the ropes but when faced with killing someone, Harry hesitates, but ultimately does the crime, letting himself go as he did when beating the strip club owner. That night, upset by what he did, Harry goes to Louis Varga's house, only to find it empty, sans for Iris, his Hungarian maid. She offers him coffee, and it is here where Harry's alter-ego Madden ([[Holter Graham]]), appears. With Madden in control, Harry frightens Iris and thus causes her to quit. Angry, Mr. Varga makes Harry apologize to Iris, and makes Harry say he is in love with her to prompt her to come back under Mr. Varga's employment. Hesitantly, Iris accepts Harry's timid offer and the two begin dating, with Harry actually falling in love with Iris along the way, much to his mother's anger and jealousy.  When Harry finds a house that he likes, he is set on moving into it as a means to escape his mother's controlling nature, but when she moves with him, she decorates the house as a replica of their old apartment, much to her sons anger. Arnie is then released from prison, and Harry hopes to get him back in the game as their getaway driver for a new hit coming up. However, the hit goes awry when it is revealed far too late that the man to be killed by both Harry and Abie, is actually Abie's long-lost uncle. Devastated, Abie pauses long enough for the police to be called, which is where Arnie flees. Abie and Harry manage to escape. While Abie grieves at home, falling off the wagon after years of sobriety, Harry and "Madden" meet up again and this leads him to Iris' house, where the consummate their relationship. Arnie then comes forward with the promise of immunity, and flips on Harry and Abie. Both Abie and Harry keep quiet during the interrogation.  The mob has the three released, but now that it is clear that Arnie is a liability and cannot be trusted, Mr. Varga orders Abie and Harry to kill him. When Abie hesitates, still drinking and distraught over his uncle, Harry kills Arnie himself, despite his friend's pleading. Once again, in this blood-lust haze, Harry seeks comfort with Iris. At Arnie's funeral, Mr. Varga reminds Harry that when Abie drinks, he starts talking, and this makes him a liability. Mr. Varga hints that they may need to kill Abie to keep him silent. When Kate finds Iris' hair in Harry's underwear, he admits to having a girlfriend and Kate calmly says she would like to meet her. The stress puts a strain on Iris and Harry's sex life, and even "Madden's one-track mind" is of no use (during past sexual encounters, Harry has only had sex with Iris under Madden's persona). Worried for Harry's mental health, Iris resolves they really try, without Madden's help. The two go to a hotel, where they make love after Harry has her put on a mourning veil. At the family dinner where Iris was to meet Kate, things seem to be going well, until Kate has her son go out for ginger ale, leaving the two women alone. When Harry returns he finds Iris gone, his mother having driven her away in a jealous rage. Harry admits that he may be in love with Iris and is about to go after her when his mother stops him. Harry remains home and breaks off contact with Iris, his mother's hold over him stronger than ever.  Despite the fact that Abie has stopped drinking and is no longer a threat, Mr. Varga orders Harry to kill Abie anyway. Harry kills Abie with the same ice-pick he gave Harry earlier in the film, in front of a diner full of witnesses. More upset than ever, Madden is revealed again, and though he goes to first Iris, then a brothel for relief, he turns to his mother. It is revealed though flashbacks that Madden is truly Harry. Harry then has sex with Kate, who proclaims that she had waited "so long" for this.  The next morning is mundane, Harry takes his usual bath while his mother is in the kitchen. He hears a thud and goes to investigate, and there finds his mother hanging from the ceiling thinking she killed herself (Harry actually killed her, but his mental state won't let him notice). Mr. Varga calls Harry to inform him that they are relocating elsewhere, as Harry's act in the diner put them all under danger of arrest. Harry, clearly distraught from Kate's death, says that he will take his mother's corpse with him, and that she will "not get in the way" of their escape. Disturbed, Mr. Varga agrees to pick him up, only to attempt to kill him when Harry gets into the backseat. Harry draws his own gun and shoots both Mr. Varga and his henchman dead and takes the car to the bus station.  Iris, who had left the city for California to be with her brother, is delighted to have Harry going with her. They sit on the bus, overjoyed to breakaway from the city and the mob altogether. Harry looks away across the seat with a smile, and shows Kate's body bag resting casually in the seat.

There, they rescue a young girl named Laia Einberg from an out-of-control golem. Lina and Naga expect to be rewarded for their not-so selfless deed, so Laia takes them to her workplace and introduces them to her father, Galia, and her brother, Huey. Galia is a renowned crafter of classic toy golems but lately he is struggling for money. He is also in conflict with Huey, his son and student, over their very opposing ideas as to how their golems should look and act like. Huey becomes infatuated with Naga's looks, while Galia takes a liking to Lina, and so they choose both sorceresses as models for their respective new golems.  There is an upcoming event in Stoner in which huge, remote-controlled golems will fight each other in a competition. The same contest will also decide which of two feuding lords sponsoring the festival, Haizen and Granion, will take control over the town. Secretly, both of the lords also scheme to have their golems mass-produced as unstoppable weapons of war. Haizen succeeds in hiring Huey and Naga, while Galia and Lina get employed by Granion. Lina and Naga can easily become antagonistic, and, following an inconclusive magical duel, they end up battling it out again — but this time they are going to fight through the golems made in their appearance.  Due to Galia  lacking magical clay due to Huey's sabotage, his golem is built with the sleeping Lina trapped inside so she would use her own magic to power it at the tournament. Huey has lured Naga into his golem and so now there is a powerful sorceress in each. To Lina's dismay, and Granion's disappointment, the golem that was made in her image is a  [[super deformed]] giant ''[[kawaii]]'' toy with funny squeaky shoes, dubbed "Piko-Piko Lina-chan" — instead of finding her beautiful as she believed, Galia thought she was "a girl with no hips or breasts, with a face just screaming to be characterized." She is irked even more to see Huey's towering "Grand Goddess" golem that resembles Naga to the point of also having bouncing breasts (with the well-endowed Naga's breasts being an object of burning envy for Lina).  Their battle begins, but Piko-Piko Lina-chan's short limbs can not even hit the Grand Goddess while Naga just plays with her. Further enraged, Lina attemots to attack with magic, but the golem's magical properties absorb magic, making Lina's spells useless. During that completely one-sided fight, one physical attack by the Grand Goddess makes a large hole in the back of Lina's golem. The furious Lina gets free and unleashes her most powerful spell, Dragu Slave, to defeat the Grand Goddess. Lina wins, but her spell has also destroyed the castles of both Haizen and Granion. Lina flees the suddenly outraged Naga and both of them get pursued by the angry lords manning the Piko-Piko Lina-chan, which soon stops when it runs out of power.  During the film's [[closing credits]], the ex-lords Haizen and Granion find themselves reduced to the guards for the king of the land. Galia and Huey resolve their differences, deciding to start making toys that are to be both cute and sexy at the same time, while the now derelict Piko-Piko Lina-chan becomes the new symbol and mascot of the entire town. Elsewhere, Lina and Naga continue their travels together, as prone to failing-out with each other as ever.  
Smilla's Sense of Snow (film)
 In 1859, a meteorite streaks across the sky and crashes into the Gela Alta glacier in western [[Greenland]], causing a massive explosion that kills an [[Inuit]] fisherman.  In present-day [[Copenhagen]], Smilla Jaspersen, a transplanted Greenlander, is studying ice crystals at a university lab. An Arctic ice specialist, Smilla is uncredentialed and unemployed with a troubled past. She returns to her apartment complex to find the body of her neighbour, Isaiah Christiansen, a six-year-old Inuit boy, lying dead in the snow. The police tell her the boy was playing on the roof and fell. On the roof Smilla sees the boy's footprints in the snow and suspects foul play. The pattern of the footprints reveal someone running straight to the edge of the roof. Knowing the boy was terrified of heights, she suspects he was running away from someone.  At the morgue Smilla meets Dr. Lagermann. Seeing the body, Smilla remembers her friendship with the boy—reading to him, bathing him, taking him to the zoo. Her love for this neglected son of an alcoholic mother had given meaning to Smilla's lonely life. She is surprised to learn that Dr. Johannes Loyen, a prominent professor, performed the autopsy. The next day, she visits Loyen, who states the child's death was an accident. Unconvinced, Smilla files a complaint with the District Attorney. She goes to Lagermann's home seeking more information, and he reveals he discovered a puncture wound on the boy's thigh made by a [[biopsy]] needle after his death. He also reveals that Loyen was examining the boy every month.  At the funeral, Smilla notices Dr. Andreas Tork, the CEO of Greenland Mining, trying to give money to the grieving mother who rejects it in anger; earlier she was also offered a pension from Greenland Mining following her husband's accidental death in Greenland. Detective Ravn from the District Attorney's office comes to Smilla's apartment and agrees to look into the case, but Smilla discovers he is involved with Tork. Smilla tracks down the company's former accountant Elsa Lübing, who directs her to the Expedition Report in the company archives, and lends her a key to the building. She climbs in, locates the report, and is surprised by her neighbour, the mechanic, who has followed her and now offers his help. They return to his apartment where she shares what she's discovered.  At the District Attorney's office, Ravn threatens Smilla with imprisonment—something Greenlanders find particularly stressful—for stealing Greenland Mining property. She agrees to suspend her investigation, but after learning from Isaiah's mother that her husband died from something in the melt water, she continues her investigation. Smilla meets with her father, Moritz Jaspersen to ask for his help in understanding the Expedition Report. Her father agrees to look into it.   At the apartment complex, Smilla discovers a cassette tape hidden behind the wall near Isaiah's old hiding spot beneath a stairwell. Unable to understand the audio, she takes the tape to an audio expert who cleans it up enough to reveal Isaiah's father talking to his son. The audio expert is soon murdered, and Smilla barely escapes with her life. She's picked up by the mechanic. Later Smilla and the mechanic follow their pursuers to a ship, which Tork is preparing for another Greenland excursion.  Smilla's father shows her medical x-rays of Greenland Mining accident victims that reveal the presence of a lethal prehistoric "Arctic worm" thought to be long extinct. He explains how the presence of these worms inside a person's vital organs causes toxic shock and death.  At the Casino Copenhagen, the mechanic's friend, casino owner Birgo Lander, provides Smilla information about the ship and points out its captain, a heavy gambler who is in debt to him. Lander agrees to help her get aboard the ship as an employee. Once on board, Smilla meets Nils Jakkelsen, who helps her discover videotapes revealing the truth about the Greenland operation—the discovery of an energy-producing meteorite that Tork believes will give his company a dominant position in the world. As the ship cuts through the dense Arctic ice packs, Smilla is chased throughout the ship by Tork's men. After Nils is killed, Smilla is helped by the mechanic, who secretly followed her aboard. He reveals he works for the government and was assigned to investigate Greenland Mining.  As the ship approaches the shore, Smilla leaves the ship following the mechanic's instructions and makes her way across the frozen landscape. She discovers the entrance to the Greenland Mining ice cave, where the company is doing research on the meteorite that fell in 1859. Inside the cave she is captured by Tork's men, but she is rescued by the mechanic/agent. Wounded from the exchange, Tork runs from the cave and out across the ice. The mechanic/agent sets off a powerful bomb that destroys the cave in a massive explosion. The resulting waves move the ice beneath Tork, who falls and drowns in the freezing water. Smilla gazes out over the seemingly endless landscape of ice and snow—the land of her childhood.<ref name="dvd"></ref>

Snakes and Ladders (1980 film)
 "H" (Pascal Bonitzer) wakes up in his car, uninjured and with no signs of an accident. It won’t start, so he walks away. He tells two men playing a board game in a field that his car has broken down and he is late for an appointment; they offer no help. H asks how long they have been playing and the nearest man (Jean-Loup Rivière) replies they have been playing a very long time. Asked if they should roll the dice, the man looks to the sky, carefully arranges the dice, counts the spaces on the board, and tells the other player "You have one hour". The male narrator says, "H realizes he is a victim of a nightmare", as H looks up and sees a hand rolling dice in the sky. The first man tells H where to go, the narrator saying, "H realizes he is the victim of the worst type of nightmare, <u>a didactic nightmare</u>".  As H and the second man move in accordance with rolls of the dice, a female narrator describes the game's rules. In Paris, a voice calls H from a warehouse; it is the first man he met. H, feeling that he is being played with, approaches the man who tells him he risks being late. Saying he wants to stop, H points to the board game's final square, but the man says someone is waiting for him at another tile; H hurries to his next destination. After he leaves the man reveals several versions of the game's board H is ignorant of.  Another player in the game (also Jean-Loup Rivière) advises H to always take unseen routes. The female narrator discusses how to resolve a labyrinth; a map enlarges one's field of vision to destroy a maze. As H travels, he meets a blind player who follows a sound map; the female narrator says such maps show travellers are going in the correct direction when the route follows a complete melody.  Entering a church after the first man he met calls him from the roof, H realizes the church is also part of the game. Told that the board game's scale has moved from a district of Paris to the whole city, H is nauseous with vertigo and vomits two dice. Asked to vomit again so the man can have a turn, H says his ears hurt; the dice are in H's ears and he and the man hurry along.  Called from a car outside the church, H climbs in and realizes it's part of the game. The female narrator describes three hypotheses: the map is old and the city has changed, making it inaccurate; the map is a developmental model of the city, which the city doesn't yet resemble; or the city has been destroyed and rebuilt using many maps, a combination of the first two hypotheses. Saying they need a perfect map, she suggests that either they create one using street-by-street analysis, making the map 1:1, or they create a map of all possible routes stored on videodiscs for the army or tourists/travellers. Meanwhile, H sees the first man in another car. H is told the scale has changed again and that he needs to go to the station. In the car's rear view mirror he sees new dice numbers reflected in his driver's sunglasses.  On a train, H talks to the second man he saw playing the game in the field and discovers that all of the passengers are playing the game. The man tells H he is "the one who answers questions". H asks him "What is the connection between routes and maps?" but falls asleep; in his dream, H has a new nightmare in which dice are rolled and he is ordered off the train.  Flying in an aeroplane over Europe, the game's new scale, with the first man he met, H is heading towards the Montfossis (fake mountains used by cartographers to converge two ranges on a map). H sleeps and dreams they are flying over maps in an exhibition and are travelling not in space, but in time. As they fly over multiple labyrinth maps the man says they are in the eye of the dice. A new dice rolls which changes the scale to encompass the whole planet Earth. H loses consciousness in the thin air the plane is flying in.  Waking up sitting on a giant hand, H sees the dice and rolls them, but the hand closes in on him. As it opens, H realizes he is both the dice in the game he is in and also the player rolling them. H disappears leaving only the dice behind. The scale changes to that of the universe. As they travel the cosmos, a man tells him that they are not dead, but the Earth is because there is no more time and therefore no space. Observing the universe and the Earth, H realizes he is waking up but doesn't know which dream he will wake in. Finally, H is back again in the field where he first found the men playing the game.  
Soul Food (film)
 ''Soul Food'' is told through the eyes of 11-year-old [[Ahmad Chadway|Ahmad]] (Hammond), following the trials of the Joseph family, a close-knit [[Chicago]] family that gets together to have Sunday dinner every week, with plenty of [[soul food]] to go around. [[Josephine Joseph (Soul Food)|Mother (Big Mama) Joe]] (Hall) has three daughters, who each have had varying success in life: oldest daughter [[Teri Joseph|Teri]] (Williams) has become a successful lawyer, but has a strained relationship with younger sister [[Maxine Chadway|Maxine]] (Fox) who stole and eventually married Teri's former boyfriend, [[Kenny Chadway|Kenny]] (Sams). Teri is currently married to Miles (Beach), a lawyer who quit his job to pursue his dream of being an [[R&B]] musician, which Teri doesn't support. Youngest daughter Robin (Long)—nicknamed [[Tracy "Bird" Van Adams|"Bird"]]—has just opened a [[barber]]shop/[[beauty salon|beauty parlor]] and gotten [[marriage|married]] to [[Lem Van Adams|Lem]] (Phifer), an ex-convict.   Life becomes complicated when Big Mama, the [[diabetes|diabetic]] but wise and caring matriarch of the family and the glue that holds it together, suffers a debilitating [[stroke]] during an operation to [[amputate]] her leg. She slips into a [[coma]], dying shortly after sharing a last word of advice with Ahmad, Kenny and Maxine's oldest child and her oldest and favorite grandchild, when she awakens five weeks later. Without her guidance, the family begins to fall apart in the interim. Teri takes in her troubled cousin Faith (Ravera), who bonds with Miles over a love of the [[arts]]. The two have an affair and are caught [[sexual intercourse|having sex]] by Teri, which later leads to a near-violent confrontation at Kenny and Maxine's 11th wedding anniversary party when she furiously comes after the two with a [[butcher knife]]. Meanwhile, Lem cannot find a job due to his criminal record, so Bird makes an uneasy deal with her former boyfriend, Simuel St. James ([[Mel Jackson]]), to get Lem a job. This creates tension between Lem and Bird when he finds out and in one of their arguments, Teri overhears and mistakenly believes Lem had physically threatened her sister, at which Teri hires her cousin Blimp to teach Lem a lesson. However, when the two men get into a fight that ends with Lem pulling out a gun, the police become involved, resulting in Lem being arrested on [[assault]] and unlawful weapon possession charges. Realizing her mistake, Teri calls in a few favors to have Lem released and later apologizes to him. By contrast, Kenny and Maxine's relationship remains stable and they have their third child at the start of the film. However, they constantly call on Teri to pay for things for the family without paying the money back, which causes even more tension between the two oldest sisters.   Throughout these events, Ahmad becomes worried about the state of his extended family and, following Big Mama's passing, conspires to find a way to bring them all back together by telling his relatives about a stash of money that Big Mama had hidden away some time ago, but everyone dismisses him, believing it to be a myth. However, Ahmad manages to get everyone together for another Sunday dinner by promising them the whereabouts of the money. The dinner is uneasy as everyone starts to confront their issues and soon enough, thanks to Miles mentioning something about the money, they realize there is no money. Maxine chastises her son for lying, but Ahmad says tearfully that it was the only way to get everyone back together again, citing it was Big Mama's dying wish. As Maxine comforts her son, the kitchen accidentally catches on fire due to Ahmad leaving a towel too close to the burner, and they all work together to try and to put it out. Shortly after they put the fire out, Uncle Pete ([[John M. Watson Sr.]]), Big Mama's [[autistic]] brother who hadn't left his room in what Ahmad says is "something like ten years now," comes down with his television and drops it to reveal the money that Big Mama had hidden away. Things start to get better for the family: Miles still comes by for Sunday dinner even though he and Teri are [[divorce|divorcing]], Teri has made peace with Maxine and decided not to sell her mother's house, Lem and Bird are expecting their first child, Faith is finally becoming part of the family again and Uncle Pete starts to join the family as well.

As the two dance, a hurt and jealous Claudia, goes into an early labor and delivers a stillborn boy. Doctor Gutenberg informs Frederick that although Claudia is perfectly healthy she can never have another child. Distraught, she is soon corrupted by the power of the mirror.  The next morning, a remorseful and sympathetic Lilli attempts to make peace with Claudia who appears to forgive her. Dr Gutenberg proposes to Lilli which she happily accepts and he goes to ask for her father's consent. While waiting for him, she is confronted by Claudia's brother, Gustav who tries to kill her as per Claudia's orders but she escapes deep into the woods. Gustav then resorts to killing a boar instead and presents its heart to Claudia, who orders him to place the rest of the remains in the stew pot, intended for her and Frederick's dinner. However, when she coughs up the boar's blood she realises that Gustav has failed her. Enraged at his betrayal, she bewitches him causing him to have horrific hallucinations and he commits suicide. In the meantime, Lilli is found by seven rough, combative miners, led by Will, who grudgingly take her under their wing. Claudia makes another attempt on Lilli's life by using [[witchcraft]] to crush her in the mines but she is rescued by Will. Doctor Gutenberg returns to the castle to find it almost abandoned save for Claudia who in an attempt to get rid of him, seduces and pleads with him to find Lilli.  Claudia again uses witchcraft to lure Lilli to her death by summoning a gale to knock down the trees and crush her to death. Lilli is almost crushed when she tries to save Lars, but she is pulled to safety by Will. One of the miners spots a raven that had been following them and kills it after realizing it was bewitched.  Under the mirror's influence, Claudia decides to deal with Lilli later and decides to resurrect her dead son by stealing Frederick's seed and bathing the child in his blood. She then makes her way to his bedchamber and has sex with him. In the forest, while the four remaining miners mourn their losses, Lilli notices Will's scars, inflicted by [[Crusades|Crusaders]]. Having fallen in love, the two share a kiss. Claudia disguises herself as an old woman and turns her brother's eviscerated heart into a poisoned apple. Transported to Lilli's refuge, she deceives her into accepting the apple, which puts her into a deathlike state. Will finds Lilli seemingly dead on the ground from a bite of the apple. Dr. Gutenberg eventually finds them and sadly pronounces her dead. The miners place her in a glass coffin and prepare to bury her. Will notices that her eyes have opened and pulls Lilli's body from the coffin, and shakes her as he commands her to breathe, dislodging the piece of apple that had been stuck in her throat. In the castle, Claudia takes Frederick to the chapel, wherein the castle staff appear mindlessly worshipping, ties him to a crucifix and suspends it upside down and prepares to exsanguinate him in a crude Satanic ritual.  Gutenberg takes Lilli back to the castle to stop Claudia and rescue Frederick, followed by Will. On arriving, they discover that the entire household has been placed under a spell, locking them in a trance like state. They find a weak and delirious Frederick who perceives Lilli as a ghost and Will takes him outside to safety. Claudia kills Gutenberg by pushing him out a window. Lilli then proceeds to confront her stepmother. She finds Claudia cradling her newly revived but weak baby. The two engage in a fight resulting in Lilli accidentally setting the room alight. Claudia becomes distracted by her son's distress allowing Lilli to grab a dagger and stabs the mirror wounding both Claudia and her reflection. Lilli flees to join Will and a delirious Frederick outside while Claudia burns to death. Her father finally comes to and is overjoyed to see her again.  
The Soong Sisters (film)
 The film opens with a scene of the three [[Soong sisters]] in their childhood in the late [[Qing dynasty]]. Their father, [[Charlie Soong]], demonstrates the wealth and prestige of his family by running one of the most successful printing businesses. The sisters later travel abroad to attend [[Wesleyan College]] in [[Macon, Georgia]], United States.  Of the three sisters, the eldest, [[Soong Ai-ling]], is the first to get married in 1914. Her husband is [[H. H. Kung|K'ung Hsiang-hsi]], a wealthy banker and descendant of [[Confucius]].  [[Sun Yat-sen]] is a fugitive of the weakening Qing government and he lives in exile in Japan. He weds [[Soong Ching-ling]], despite stern opposition from Charlie Soong. After the Qing dynasty is overthrown by the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, Sun becomes the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]'s first provisional president and founds the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party).

[[Chiang Kai-shek]] succeeds Sun Yat-sen as the new chief of the Kuomintang. In 1927, he marries [[Soong Mei-ling]], the youngest of the three sisters. The Chiang couple oppose the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. The widowed Soong Ching-ling often quarrels with the family, accusing Chiang Kai-shek and his followers of persecuting the Communists and hindering the Chinese reunification. She leaves the Kuomintang and openly voices dissent against Chiang. The three sisters were hardly reunited again, except at their parents' deathbeds and on other special occasions.  While the Kuomintang and Communists are fighting with each other, the [[Empire of Japan]] takes advantage of the situation to invade China in the 1930s. In 1936, Chiang Kai-shek is kidnapped by [[Zhang Xueliang]] in the [[Xi'an Incident]]. He is forced to make peace with the Communists and focus on dealing with the Japanese invaders, leading to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

The film ends with actual footage of the Kuomintang relocating the [[government of the Republic of China]] to Taiwan, and a quick glimpse of Communist leader [[Mao Zedong]] proclaiming the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949 in Beijing.  
Sous les pieds des femmes
   
Speed 2: Cruise Control
 Alex Shaw is on a motorcycle chasing a vehicle with stolen goods. After he catches the driver of the vehicle, his girlfriend Annie runs into him during her driving test. She finds out that Alex is on the [[SWAT]] team after he lied and told her he was a beach officer. As an apology, Alex surprises her with a [[Caribbean]] cruise on ''[[Seabourn Legend]]''.  Aboard the ship, passenger John Geiger [[security hacker|hacks]] into the ship's computer system, and the following evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] to tell the [[Chief mate|first officer]], Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, and a group of people become trapped behind locked [[fire door]]s in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]], Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The winch lowering the lifeboat jams. Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank to get them back on deck.  Alex realizes Geiger is controlling the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw to cut the door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the [[navigator]], Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the [[Ballast tank|ballast]] doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbs out of the elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.  The crew notice that Geiger has set the ship to crash into an [[oil tanker]] off the coast of [[Saint Martin]]. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving underneath it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable. Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater, causing it to break off the ship and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the ship's stern.  To avoid collision with the oil tanker, Alex and Dante go into the ship's [[bilge]] and use the [[bow thruster]]s to turn it. The ship screeches down the side of the tanker, but manages to withstand the damage, and heads straight into a marina. It then crashes into a Saint Martin town and eventually stops. Alex jumps off to rescue Annie and hijacks a speed boat. Geiger takes Annie into a [[seaplane]].  Alex shoots at it from the boat with a [[speargun]] and reels himself in through the water. He climbs onto the plane and rescues Annie, and both escape from the plane on one of its [[float (nautical)|floats]], which falls onto the ocean. Geiger loses control of the plane and crashes into the oil tanker, causing it to explode. The tanker crew however are safe, having launched their lifeboat just in time. Annie and Alex travel back to shore in the speed boat, and he gives her an engagement ring, asking her if she will "wear it for a while", and she accepts.

[[Jason Wynn]], the head of the covert government agency for which Simmons works, assigns him to infiltrate a biochemical weapons plant in [[North Korea]]. Unknown to Simmons, Wynn has ordered his top assassin [[Jessica Priest]] to murder him while he is on the mission. After Simmons dies, he is set on fire by Wynn and the flames cause the plant to explode. Simmons arrives in [[Hell]], where one of the rulers of Hell - [[Malebolgia]] - offers him a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian deal]]: if Simmons becomes his eternal servant and leader of his army in [[Armageddon]], he will be able to return to Earth to see his fiancée, [[Wanda Blake]].

He also meets a mysterious old man named [[Cogliostro]], a fellow [[Hellspawn (Spawn)|Hellspawn]], who has successfully freed his soul and now fights for [[Heaven]]. Simmons learns that Wynn, who is now a weapons dealer, has developed a [[Biological agent|biological weapon]] called Heat 16. During a reception, Spawn attacks Wynn, kills Jessica, and escapes with the help of his [[necroplasm]] armor.  Following the attack by Simmons, Violator convinces Wynn to have a device attached to his heart that will release Heat 16 worldwide if his vital signs flatline as a deterrent against assassination attempts. However, Malebolgia wants Simmons to kill Wynn and initiate the apocalypse. Spawn confronts Violator, who turns into his demonic form and beats Al down. Cogliostro rescues Al and teaches him how to use his necroplasm armor. Simmons learns that Violator and Wynn are going to kill Terry, Cyan, and Wanda.

Wynn is arrested, and Spawn, realizing there is no place for him in Wanda's world anymore, dedicates himself to justice rather than succumbing to his lust for vengeance.  
The Spanish Prisoner
 Corporate engineer Joe Ross has invented a potentially lucrative and secret financial process. While on a retreat on the island of St. Estèphe, he meets a wealthy stranger, Jimmy Dell, and attracts the interest of one of the company's new secretaries, Susan Ricci.  Jimmy wants to introduce Joe to his sister, an Olympic-class tennis player, in New York and asks him to deliver a package to her. Susan sits near Joe on the airplane back to New York, converses with him about how "you never know who anybody is," and talks about unwitting drug mules. Realizing that he doesn't really know Jimmy, and afraid the package might contain something illegal, Joe opens it on the plane, finding only a 1939 edition of the book ''Budge on Tennis'', and accidentally rips the cover in the process. Once home, Joe buys another copy of the book, to give to Jimmy's sister, and keeps the torn one at his office.  Jimmy suggests that Joe's company and his boss, Mr. Klein, might not give Joe fair compensation for his work. The flirtatious Susan also keeps making suggestions that one never knows whom to trust. Jimmy invites Joe to dinner with Jimmy's sister, and they meet at Dell's place. While at his computer and chatting about business, Jimmy asks if Joe has a Swiss bank account, and finding the answer is no, opens one for him with the token balance of 15 [[Swiss franc]]s, pretending that it is all an easy lark. Taking him to dinner at a club requiring membership, Jimmy has Joe sign a certificate to join. Over dinner, he advises Joe to consult legal counsel about his position in the company regarding the Process; Jimmy offers his own lawyer, telling Joe to bring the only copy of the Process to their meeting.  Joe learns that the sister does not actually exist and that Jimmy is really a con artist who is attempting to steal Joe's work. Joe contacts Pat McCune, a woman he met on the island whom Susan told him was an FBI agent, and whose business card Susan kept. He is enlisted in a sting operation. When Jimmy Dell never shows up for the planned meeting, to his horror, Joe learns that McCune is actually part of Jimmy's con game. His Process is stolen.  Joe attempts to explain what happened to his employer and the police, but his story sounds far-fetched. The con has made it appear that he has sold his Process to the Japanese. The Swiss bank account that Jimmy opened for him makes it look as though he is hiding assets, and the certificate he signed to join the club turns out to be a request for political asylum in Venezuela, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. The police show Joe that Jimmy's apartment is a mere façade and that the club's members-only room was nothing but a restaurant that was closed. Joe is also framed for the murder of his co-developer of the process, George Lang.  On the run, Joe reconnects with Susan, who says she believes his story and continues to express a romantic interest in him. Joe remembers that the hotel on the island maintains video surveillance, which could prove that Jimmy Dell was there. Susan takes him to the airport in order to fly to the island. On the way to the airport, Susan convinces him to drive to Boston (to elude a manhunt).  At the airport in Boston, Susan gives him a camera bag, which contains a gun, and an airplane ticket to the island, but actually to Venezuela. Before passing through security, Joe realizes that Jimmy left his fingerprints on the original tennis book Joe was to deliver. He leaves the airport with Susan, still not realizing that she is working against him. They board a ferry to return home.  Jimmy comes to kill Joe on the ferry, seemingly alone except for Susan and a couple of Japanese tourists. The final step of this con is going to be Joe's death, made to appear as a suicide. Jimmy suddenly is hit with a [[tranquilizer dart]] shot by one of the tourists, who are actually [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] who have been monitoring Jimmy's con. They reveal that Joe's boss, Mr. Klein, was behind the entire con because he wanted to keep all the profits for himself. Jimmy and Susan are taken to jail.

Spice World (film)
 The film begins with the [[Spice Girls]] performing "[[Too Much (Spice Girls song)|Too Much]]" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of fame and fortune. Meanwhile, sinister newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford ([[Barry Humphries]]) is attempting to ruin the girls' reputation for his newspaper's ratings. McMaxford dispatches photographer Damien ([[Richard O'Brien]]) to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Less threatening but more annoying is Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth ([[Alan Cumming]]), who stalks the girls along with his camera crew, hoping to use them as subjects for his next project. At the same time, the girls' uptight manager, Clifford ([[Richard E. Grant]]) and his sympathetic assistant Deborah ([[Claire Rushbrook]]), are fending off two over-eager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon ([[George Wendt]] and [[Mark McKinney]]), who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for a feature film for the Spice Girls.  Amid this, the girls must prepare for their live concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in three days, the biggest performance of their career. At the heart of it, the constant practices, traveling, publicity appearances, and other burdens of celebrity affect the girls on a personal level, preventing them from spending much time with their pregnant best friend, Nicola ([[Naoko Mori]]), who is due to give birth soon. Throughout the busy schedule, the girls attempt to ask Clifford for time off to spend with Nicola and relax, but Clifford refuses after talking with the head of the girls' record label, the cryptic and eccentric "Chief" ([[Roger Moore]]). The stress and overwork compound, which culminate in a huge argument between Clifford and the girls. The girls suddenly storm out on the evening before their gig at the Albert Hall.  The girls separately think back on their humble beginnings and their struggle to the top. They reunite by chance outside the now-abandoned café where they practiced during their childhood years, they reconcile, and decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, Nicola goes into labor at the nightclub and is rushed to the hospital in the girls' bus, giving birth to a healthy baby girl. When [[Emma Bunton|Emma]] notices that the delivery "doctor" has a camera, the girls realize that he is Damien, who runs off with the girls in hot pursuit, only to hit his head after accidentally colliding with an empty stretcher. When Damien sees the girls standing over him, he tells them that they have made him see the error of his ways, and he goes after McMaxford, who is subsequently fired in a "Jacuzzi scandal".  After noticing the girls' bus driver, Dennis ([[Meat Loaf]]) is missing, [[Victoria Beckham|Victoria]] decides to take the wheel. It becomes a race against time as Victoria drives like a maniac through London. While approaching [[Tower Bridge]], the bridge begins to raise to let a boat through the [[River Thames]]. Victoria drives up the bridge and over the gap. The bus finally lands safely on the other side, but when Emma opens a trapdoor in the floor, she discovers a bomb, and the girls scream before Emma slams the trapdoor shut again.  The girls finally arrive at the Royal Albert Hall for their performance and run up the steps. However, the girls have one more obstacle to overcome: a London policeman ([[Kevin McNally]]) charges the girls with "dangerous driving, criminal damage, flying a bus without a license, and frightening the pigeons". Emma pushes forward and tells the policeman that she and the other girls were late for their performance at the Albert Hall. Emma smiles at the policeman, and he lets the girls off for their performance. The film ends when the girls perform their song "[[Spice Up Your Life]]" at the start of their Royal Albert Hall concert broadcast live on television around the world.  The supporting cast later talk about the girls' film during the closing credits. [[Melanie Chisholm|Mel C]] breaks the [[fourth wall]] and tells the other girls that the outgoing audience is watching them. The girls talk to the audience, commenting on "those two in the back row snogging" and on one's dress, and discuss their film, just minutes before the bomb in their bus explodes.

Stage Fright (1997 film)
 Tiny, a dog trainer, hides with his dogs in a wicker basket on the stage of an abandoned vaudeville theater. He emerges to have them practice a trick, attacking a tattered straw boater hat on command. When a second man, Arnold Hugh, emerges menacingly onto the stage, Tiny fearfully backs away from him and falls into the orchestra pit, getting his clothes snagged on a broken plank.  Years earlier, Tiny had found one of his dogs missing while performing his trained-dog act in the theater. Even though he fears that the crowd no longer likes the act, his friend Daphne encourages him to go on with the show. He is booed off the stage in favor of a silent movie, which stars Arnold and Daphne and features the missing dog, taken by Daphne. Arnold pressures her not to tell Tiny about the theft and goes on to make a string of successful movies with Daphne and the dogs.   Tiny trains the dogs to jump up and place a boater on his head at his command. When Arnold uses this trick in one of his movies, though, it fails because he is taller than Tiny; he angrily confronts Tiny and threatens to torture the animals unless they can reach his height. Angered, Tiny re-trains them to attack instead, prompting Arnold to leave the studio for the confrontation seen at the beginning of the film. Daphne decides that she no longer wants to work with Arnold and follows him to the theater.   Daphne swings a sandbag across the stage, knocking Arnold down, and confesses her involvement to Tiny. Arnold gets up and begins to strangle Daphne, but Tiny delivers his attack command and the dogs advance menacingly toward him. Arnold pulls a metal latch off the wall to use as a weapon, triggering the movie screen to come down on his head and kill him.  Daphne sees no sign of Tiny when she turns back to the orchestra pit, but he is lifted into view on the organ that had been used to provide background music for Arnold's movies. It now glows white, being played by a spectral organist; Tiny climbs off, unhurt, but Arnold's spirit rises from his body and steps on at the organist's beckoning. The organ then swiftly drops out of sight, carrying a terrified Arnold down to [[hell]]. As the theater begins to collapse, Daphne persuades Tiny to overcome his fear of rejection and leave with her. They and the dogs exit into the light of the outside world.  
Squeeze (film)
   
Starship Troopers (film)
  In the 23rd century, while colonizing new planets, humans have encountered a hostile non-technological insectoid species known as Arachnids or "[[Bug (Starship Troopers)|Bugs]]".  In the Federation, citizenship is a privilege, earned by performing such activities as military service, which grants individuals opportunities prohibited to basic civilians. [[Juan Rico|John "Johnny" Rico]], his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez, and best friend Carl Jenkins attend high school in [[Buenos Aires]]. Fellow student Isabelle "Dizzy" Flores is in love with Rico. They all enlist in the Federal Service after graduation, despite Rico's parents' disapproval of military service. Carmen becomes a spaceship pilot, while [[psychic]]ally gifted Carl joins [[Military Intelligence]]. Rico enlists in the [[Mobile Infantry (Starship Troopers)|Mobile Infantry]] and is surprised to find Dizzy has deliberately transferred to his squad.  In Mobile Infantry basic training, Career Sgt. Zim trains the recruits. Rico is later promoted to squad leader and befriends Ace Levy. He later receives a [[Dear John letter]] from Carmen, as she desires a career with the fleet and now serves under Rico's high-school sports rival, Zander Barcalow. Following a [[Live fire exercise|live-fire training]] incident that kills one of Rico's squad members and causes another to quit out of guilt, Rico is demoted and [[Flagellation|flogged]]. He resigns and calls his parents to ask them if he can return home, but the call is cut off when an asteroid, reported to be launched by the Arachnids, obliterates [[Buenos Aires]], killing them and millions of others. Rico rescinds his resignation.   An invasion force is deployed to [[Klendathu]], the Arachnids' home planet, but the operation is a total disaster. Rico is severely wounded in the leg and mistakenly reported [[killed in action]]. After recovering, he, Ace and Dizzy are reassigned to the "Roughnecks", an [[Special forces|elite unit]] commanded by Lt. Jean Rasczak, Rico's high-school teacher. He quickly gains the respect of his peers and is promoted to the rank of corporal after taking out a tanker bug. His relationship with Dizzy continues to grow, and they have sex during their night on Tango Urilla.  The Roughnecks respond to a distress call from Planet "P", where they reconnoitre an outpost that has been devastated by Bugs. The distress call is a trap, and the Arachnids swarm the outpost. Rico, now an acting sergeant, euthanizes a mortally wounded Rasczak after a buried Bug bites off his legs. After a Bug stabs Dizzy in the torso, she dies in Rico's arms as they are rescued by Carmen and Zander. Rico and Carmen encounter Carl, now a high-ranking intelligence officer, at Dizzy's funeral. Carl reveals that there is reason to believe an intelligent "brain bug" is directing the other Bugs and has been learning how to fight humans. He field-promotes Rico to lieutenant and gives him command of the Roughnecks, ordering the Mobile Infantry units under his control to return to "P" and try to capture the brain bug.  The Fleet encounters unexpectedly heavy fire from the Bugs, and Carmen's ship is destroyed. Carmen and Zander's escape pod crashes into a Bug tunnel system near Rico. They are surrounded by Bugs, and a brain bug uses its [[proboscis]] to pierce Zander's skull and eat his brain. As it is about to do the same to Carmen, she cuts off its proboscis with a knife. Rico arrives and threatens the Bugs with a small [[Tactical nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]], which the brain bug recognizes. They flee, while the brain bug makes its escape. Arachnids pursue them, and Watkins, mortally wounded, sacrifices himself by detonating the bomb to enable the others to escape.  After returning to the surface, they find that former Sergeant Zim, who had requested a demotion to private so that he could serve at the front, has captured the brain bug. Carl tells Rico and Carmen that the humans will soon be victorious, now that Military Intelligence can study the brain bug. Carl mentally scans the Bug and reveals it is afraid, to the cheers of the troops. A [[propaganda]] clip shows Carmen (now a captain with her own command), Ace, and Rico as model servicemen, encouraging viewers to enlist in the armed forces.  
Steel (1997 film)
 [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] ([[Shaquille O'Neal]]) is a weapons designer who invents high-tech laser guns, protective armor, and [[wikt:Special:Search/sonic|sonic]] sound cannons for the United States military. One soldier, Nathaniel Burke ([[Judd Nelson]]), decides to show just what Irons' weapons can do and sets one of Irons' sonic cannons at the highest power setting, firing the device at an abandoned building. However, the weapon backfires and destroys the building the team is situated in. Irons' partner, Susan "Sparky" Sparks ([[Annabeth Gish]]), is crushed by a large slab of concrete in the ensuing chaos. In court, Irons reveals Burke's role in the incident and Burke is dismissed from the military. Because his weapons resulted in Sparks becoming a paraplegic, Irons resigns in disgust. Meanwhile, Burke hatches a plot to sell Irons' weapons to criminal gangs, recruiting a [[video arcade]] manager to help him carry out this deed.  Irons witnesses a bank robbery organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape before he can interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals. With the help of Uncle Joe ([[Richard Roundtree]]), they forge a suit of armor and the weaponry necessary for Irons to carry out his war on crime and become the vigilante "Steel". However, during his crusade against crime, Irons is pursued by the cops and is forced to return to his lair. The next night, the robbers arrange to rob another bank. Irons, as Steel, tries to stop them, but is hindered by the robbers' weapons. When Irons returns to his grandmother's ([[Irma P. Hall]]) house, he is arrested.  Meanwhile, Burke prepares to auction off all his modified weapons to every criminal organization in the world over the Internet. When Irons is released from jail, Sparky is captured by Burke's thugs. Irons, as Steel, attempts to infiltrate Burke's headquarters, but is captured himself in the process. When Burke continues with the auction, he is tricked by Steel, which allows him and Sparks to rebel and destroy Burke's lair. Burke himself is killed when a laser he fires towards Steel reflects back towards him due to Steel's suit. After this, Steel, Sparky, Joe, and Martin ([[Ray J]]) escape Burke's lair.  The following day, Col. David ([[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]]) talks to actor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (actually Irons via [[voice changer]]) about Steel and the events on what happened the day before and offers him to help before realising it is actually Irons who he is talking to and after that, Irons declines David's offer.  In the grand opening of her restaurant, Irons' grandmother tells him about Steel and then tells Joe that everyone would be proud of his heroism. After Sparky shows the new modifications of her wheelchair that allows her to walk, Irons smiles and hugs her.  
Star Kid
 Spencer Griffith ([[Joseph Mazzello]]) is a shy boy in seventh grade. He has a crush on a school girl named Michelle ([[Lauren Eckstrom]]). Spencer's life changes one night when a mysterious [[meteorite]] crashes into a nearby junkyard. Investigating the site, he finds that the "meteorite" is actually a small rocket carrying a "Cyborsuit.", a prototype exoskeletal-suit with AI (short for [[Artificial Intelligence]]) from another galaxy. Spencer then decides to try the suit on and melds with the suit AI, who Spencer calls "Cy". After testing most of the functions and abilities of the suit, he then goes around town doing whatever he wants, such as getting back at a school [[bullying|bully]] Turbo ([[Joey Simmrin]]), rescuing Michelle and her friends from a damaged [[ferris wheel]], and ordering food from a fast-food restaurant drive-thru, along with a few hilarious antics such as trashing part of his house after getting his head stuck in a refrigerator, figuring out how to eat his drive-thru food through the suit and wanting to get out of the suit to pee when Cy wouldn't let him.  During this time, Earth gets visited by a Broodwarrior (Brian Simpson), a member of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race of [[insectoid]]s waging a war against the creator of the Cyborsuit, Tenris De'Thar and his fellow Trelkins. The Broodwarrior's mission is to capture the Cyborsuit so that his race can analyze it. After his first encounter with the Broodwarrior, Spencer escapes, forces Cy to eject him out of the suit and then abandons Cy telling him that he's afraid that he might not live to see his next birthday if he "engages" the Broodwarrior. Back at home, after Spencer looks over his comic book titled ''MidKnight Warrior'' and thinking about what kind of person he wants to be, he goes back out to find Cy only to find out that Cy was captured by the Broodwarrior. Spencer begins searching for Cy accompanied by Turbo, now becoming his friend. As they head to the junkyard, where Cy is about to be taken off-world by the Broodwarrior, they create a plan to distract the Broodwarrior long enough for Spencer to rescue Cy. Spencer gets Cy back and begins battling with the Broodwarrior.  During the battle, the Broodwarrior gets the upper hand and defeats Cy and Spencer. After getting bashed multiple times by the Broodwarrior's mace and severely damaging the suit, Cy is forced to eject Spencer out before going completely offline. Spencer covers the suit with scrap metal to hide it from the Broodwarrior, takes a piece of the suit and continues to fight the Broodwarrior, who was later trying to chase down Turbo. Spencer confronts the Broodwarrior before getting chased himself and is suddenly cornered in a junked RV. Just when the Broodwarrior is about to dispose of Spencer, Turbo finds a control panel and activates the car crusher the RV is sitting in, revealing the chase into the RV to be part of a trap. Spencer escapes while the Broodwarrior is compressed along with the RV into a solid metal cube, killing the Broodwarrior.  With the Broodwarrior now destroyed, they return to Cy but it appears they were too late to save him. Just when Spencer begins to lose hope, Cy's creator Tenris De'Thar and Trelkin soldiers appear from a giant UFO orbiting Earth and quickly repair him, bringing him back to life. After Cy and Spencer say goodbye to one another, the head alien soldier gives Spencer a badge for his bravery and courage before their departure back to their home-world, and the long, eventful night finally comes to an end. The next day at school, a now confident Spencer, with encouragement from his new friend Turbo, starts up a conversation with Michelle.  
Steel Sharks (film)
 The film opens with a news report of a revolution that has overthrown the Iranian government. This coincides with the disappearance of an American UN chemical weapons inspector, Dr. John Van Tasset ([[Barry Livingston]]), in Iraq. The US is determined to stage a rescue in the fear that he will be used to develop weapons for the new Iranian government. A Navy SEALs team is recruited for the mission, but is down a member due to illness. Enter Bob Rodgers ([[Billy Warlock]]), a young SEAL fresh out of school. The SEAL team is flown out to an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf where we meet Adm. Jim Perry ([[Billy Dee Williams]]) who commands the fleet and the rescue mission.

They get into a gun battle where one of the members of the team is killed and the others are ultimately captured. They are taken to a new secret Iranian submarine for safe keeping.  Onboard the Iranian submarine, the leader of the SEAL team is taken to Captain Reza Lashgar ([[Shaun Toub]]) who shoots him despite the protests of others on the crew. The sonar technician aboard the US submarine detects the sound of gunshots and Cmdr. McKay begins to follow the Iranian submarine. At the same time the SEAL Team realizes they have to escape to survive and plan an ambush of the guards, which works flawlessly. They split up, one group to head straight to the escape hatch and the other to communicate their escape to the US submarine. Through this electronic communication, Cmdr. McKay is aware that the SEALs have escaped and begins to hunt the Iranian submarine to buy time. They are engaged multiple times by the submarine, but expertly evade their torpedoes. With the help of Bob Rodgers' lucky coin, both groups of SEALs are able to reach the escape hatch and leave the submarine. Cmdr. McKay deftly leads the Iranian submarine down a narrow canyon, resulting in Iranian submarine striking the canyon wall with a torpedo and being sunk by the falling debris. Enraged, Captain Lashgar blows the ballast and the Iranian submarine rises for one last attack. Knowing the SEALs are safe, Cmdr. McKay torpedoes the Iranian submarine, destroying it.

Suicide Kings
 Charlie Barret walks to his private table in a restaurant, only to see two young men sitting at his table – Avery and Max. Another young man who is friends with Avery and Max, Brett, joins them shortly after Charlie sits down and begins chatting with them. Charlie happens to know Avery's father, and after an initial reluctance, is willing to go with the boys for a "night on the town".  Before meeting Charlie, they had previously planned to use [[chloroform]] to knock him out in their car. The plan goes awry, and Charlie fights back, almost wrecking the car before they can finally put him under. When Charlie wakes up, he sees himself surrounded by the three men, and a fourth friend, T. K., checks his vital signs. It is revealed that Charlie is Carlo Bartolucci, a former mob figure. The boys explain that Avery's sister, Elise, has been kidnapped, and that the kidnappers are demanding a $2 million ransom for her release. Unable to come up with the money on such short notice, they figure Charlie still has connections to get the money and set up an exchange. To ensure that Charlie knows how serious they are, Charlie is shown his cut-off finger, still wearing his signet ring, as the same was done to Elise. As incentive for his cooperation, they explain that they will do to him everything done to Elise.  Charlie flies into a rage and threatens to kill them, though he eventually agrees to help. As Charlie requests continual alcoholic drinks and his blood does not properly clot, T. K., a medical student, explains that Charlie's alcoholism may cause him to die of blood loss if he is not taken to a hospital. Charlie contacts his lawyer, who in turn contacts Lono, Charlie's bodyguard, asking him to track Charlie down. Lono goes about his own investigation, asking for, and in some cases beating out, information from people, including the hostess, Jennifer, who usually waits on Charlie, and a friend of Charlie's, Lydia. During the course of these conversations, Charlie unnerves the friends with stories of his early years as a gangster, including the origin of his signet ring.  As Lono searches, Charlie takes advantage of the boys' naïvete. A fifth friend, Ira, shows up unexpectedly and demands an explanation – they are using his house under the cover story of a poker game. Ira is flustered by their carelessness in his parents' house and becomes even more worried when he realizes they have kidnapped a major figure in the mob. Charlie plays the friends against each other, slowly getting information out of them and using it to his advantage. After much cajoling and piecing information together, Charlie identifies Max, Elise's boyfriend, as an inside man. As his enraged friends plan to cut off his finger, Avery stops them, admits it was his plan, and says he recruited Max to help him. Avery made several unlucky bets, could not pay off his debts, and was approached by mobsters who had purchased his debt.  They offered him a way out: became an inside man on his own sister's kidnapping.  Lono eventually makes his way to Ira's house and has Charlie removed from his restraints, around the same time that the money is sent to the two thugs.

 The film begins with story between two families, Christians and Hindus: Stephen ([[Nagesh]]) and Seetaramaiah ([[Kaikala Satyanarayana|Satyanarayana]]) have been best friends since college and so have their respective sons, Moses ([[Anand Raj]]) and Balaramaiah ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]). Moses' younger brother, Robert ([[Maharshi Raghava]]) and Balaramaiah's younger sister, Janaki (Rajitha) fall in love with each other. Against their families' wishes, they elope. Ever since then, the tie war is going between two families.  After 25 years later, Chandu ([[Jagapati Babu]]) comes to the village and announces that he is the son of Robert and Janaki along with his friend Gopi ([[Betha Sudhakar|Sudhakar]]). He wants to reconcile the feuding families. Chandu stays in the house of the loud & frightful Nadabrahmam ([[Amanchi Venkata Subrahmanyam|AVS]]). He gradually endears himself to both families. Later, both his grandmothers suggest marriage. To avoid the situation, Gopi suggests that Chandu tell them that he is married. Chandu decides that this is the only way, thus lying that he is married to a Hindu-Christian like himself, Nirmala Mary.  Suddenly, Nirmala Mary ([[Ravali]]) arrives. Chandu is confused, as she was just a figment of his imagination. After several encounters, Nirmala Mary comes clean with Chandu, telling him that she is the only child of Robert and Janaki. She then confronts Chandu, asking him why he wants to unite the two families. Then Chandu reveals his past.  Chandu while living in the city, he lived next to a ladies' hostel, where Nandini ([[Mantra (actress)|Raasi]]) daughter of Balaramaiah, was his resident. As she and her friends were trying to find a good song for a competition, Chandu indirectly helps her and falls in love with her. However, she treats him as only a good friend. When Chandu was about to confess his love for her, Nandini instead tells him about her love for Lawrence, Moses' son. Hearing their plan to marry without their parents' consent due to the Robert-Janaki problem, Chandu volunteers to unite the families so that they can marry with the blessings of their families.  After listening to this Nirmala respects Chandu's character of ''making his lovers marriage with her lover'' and she also volunteers him and they carry out the mission. Meanwhile, Balaramaiah learns of Nandini-Lawrence love. The news spreads quickly like wildfire and both families now think they have run away and want to kill the members of the other family. Meanwhile, Chandu has reconciled the grandparents of the two families. Only the fathers and the lovers are his main concern. In the end, he manages to unite the lovers and their families in a logical manner.  After the marriage, the truth of Chandu's appearance is revealed, by the arrival of Robert & Janaki. Later, the families ask him to marry Nirmala (whose actual name is Priyadarshini) to make him a member of their family. However, he refuses, telling them that he loved a girl and does not want to think of anyone else.  
Superfights
 Jack Cody has always been a fan of the Superfights, a televised event that meshes the likes of martial arts and professional wrestling. During an event, Jack meets one of his idols, No Mercy Budokai, who while cheering is nearly given a cheap chair shot by the heel known as The Enforcer. Jack blocks the chair shot and Budokai thanks him before competing in the ring. Budokai wins the fight against the Enforcer to the crowd's delight.  Jack is such a rabid fan that he spends his days during work practicing his martial arts in a local warehouse. While ridiculed by his supervisor, Jack still gets his job done. One night, en route home, he sees a young woman, Sally Wong, about to be robbed at an ATM. Jack is able to fend off the robbers and Sally invites him to her house to meet her grandfather. The grandfather is not grateful for Jack's heroism and even goes as far as thinking he set the robbery up to impress Sally. The grandfather is revealed to be quite a martial artist himself and tests Jack out only to humiliate him. Jack leaves and Sally is embarrassed by what had transpired. When Jack returns home, he finds news crews all over his house as surveillance video reveals his heroic actions. The newscast grabs the attention of Robert Sawyer, the owner of the Superfights, who wants to make Jack an offer.  Despite his mother's reservations, Jack accepts the offer to join the Superfights. He is nicknamed "The All-American" and befriends the likes of fellow Superfighters Budokai, Night Stalker, and Dark Cloud. However, before he can become a full Superfighter, Jack must undergo training with Angel, one of the top Superfighters. During training, Angel flirts with Jack and has him take some pills, which Angel says are vitamins. Jack eventually proves himself ready for his first fight, in which he faces the Enforcer. During their match, the Enforcer puts Jack in a headlock and Sally, who is in the audience, begins a "Jack Cody" chant, which motivates Jack to fight and eventually win his debut match. Soon, Jack begins to win more and more matches, but after a match with The Mercenary, he begins to suspect that maybe the veterans are going soft on him because he's a rookie. However, Angel confides in Jack that he is winning.  During a jog one morning, Jack sees a mysterious man dressed like a ninja. The man warns him that he is not winning the matches as he thinks he is and that the Superfights are not just about the sport. The ninja does an armbar and wristlock to Jack and tells him that the Superfights are also about some criminal activities. He also warns Jack not to take the pills as they are not vitamins. It is revealed that the Superfighters are involved in taking over criminal activity all over city. This is seen when Budokai, Night Stalker, and Dark Cloud beat up a local gang who refuses to give half of their money to them.  Meanwhile, Jack runs into Sally's grandfather at the park and in his own way, the grandfather apologizes to Jack for his actions. He even tells Jack he is teaching Sally martial arts and to meet him at a local gym the next day. It is there where Jack and Sally begin to train in the art of Tai Chi. Grandfather teaches Jack this style to complement his hard style martial arts. As Jack continues to train with Grandfather, he begins to win his matches using his combined style. When Grandfather finds the "vitamins", he asks to hold on to them to have them analyzed. It is revealed that the "vitamins" are actually a combination of steroids and mind control drugs.  Robert Sawyer is revealed to be the big crime boss when he gets himself in on a drug deal that eventually goes sour. When it is revealed that "baby powder" replaced actual cocaine, he sends in his greatest fighter "The Beast" to kill the dealer. When Sawyer is confronted by the dealer's brother in his office the next morning, Sawyer reveals himself as a master martial artist who uses two rings with hooks on the end and a kick to the throat to kill his adversaries. When Jack learns he must lose to Dark Cloud as part of the deal with Superfights, Jack refuses to give up and wins the fight. However, after being reamed out by Sawyer for disobeying him, he offers Jack a second chance. This is where Jack learns that the Superfights are more than the sport as he is forced to join Budokai, Night Stalker, and Dark Cloud to get protection from a local Chinese restaurant that he's eaten at. Returning home from the job, the ninja from earlier returns and fights Jack. However, Jack gets the upper hand and unmasks the ninja. The ninja is Budokai, who has been cooperating with the police incognito to take down Sawyer. Budokai also reveals that the Beast is Mike Rocco, Jack's childhood hero who had been forced into becoming Sawyer's top enforcer.  When Jack gets a call from Sawyer to go to a local nightclub, Jack heads there and is confronted by Angel, who by this time, does not approve of Sawyer's extracurricular activities. At the nightclub, it is revealed Sawyer has set up a fight to the death between the Beast and Budokai, whose cover had been blown. The Beast nearly kills Budokai when Jack intervenes and is able to show the Beast the pendant that was given to him as a child when the Beast was Mike Rocco. The Beast is shocked but remembers. When Sawyer orders the Beast to kill Jack, the Beast goes after Sawyer instead, only for Sawyer to retaliate and kill the Beast with a stomp to the neck. That night, Budokai is nearly dead when Grandfather comes up with the idea for he and Jack to focus their "chi" on Budokai to heal him. Successfully, they help Budokai when Jack gets a call from Sawyer. Sawyer has kidnapped Sally and Jack's mother and challenges Jack to a final fight.  Jack goes to the training grounds of the Superfights, where he takes on Sawyer in a cage match. However, Jack is able to escape and finds himself facing off against Dark Cloud and Night Stalker as well. When Sawyer attempts to get the upper hand, Sawyer and Jack are thrown through boxes. As Dark Cloud and Night Stalker look to see what happened, Jack gets up and is able to take out both Night Stalker and Dark Cloud. When Angel, who is also there, confronts Jack, she wises up and helps him free Sally and his mother. As the trio are about to leave, Sawyer returns and does a triple jump kick, knocking Sally and Mrs. Cody out. As Sawyer goes for his throat kick to Jack, Angel deflects and fights Sawyer, only to get the death kick herself. Jack finally arises and goes one-on-one with Sawyer. Sawyer proves to be too much for Jack with his intense kicking skills and hook rings. However, when Sally turns off the lights and yells for Jack to concentrate, Jack realizes he must use Tai Chi. As Sawyer goes back on the attack, Jack begins to use Tai Chi and deflects and eventually knocks down Sawyer. Jack soon gets the upper hands and ends it with a drop kick to Sawyer, sending him to the cage, where he is impaled on a wooden block with barbed wire. Angel gives her last words to Jack as she dies. The police arrive as does Grandfather and a somewhat recuperated Budokai. Grandfather tells Jack that he is truly a hero.  
Swept from the Sea
 Yanko Góral ([[Vincent Perez]]), a Ukrainian peasant, is swept ashore on the coast of Cornwall, England,  after his emigrant ship sinks on its way to America in 1888. The bodies of his fellow passengers wash ashore and are soon buried in a mass grave. Yanko makes his way to the Swaffer farm, where his dishevelled appearance frightens the family. Amy Foster ([[Rachel Weisz]]), however, is not frightened by the stranger. Amy is a loner who visits her parents, Mary and Isaac Foster, every Sunday, despite receiving very little love from them. Her father calls her a "queer sort" who collects things that wash ashore, and blames her for his scandalous marriage—Mary was already pregnant before they were married. In the coming days, Amy attends to Yanko—washing, feeding, and caring for him. When he regains his health, Yanko is taken away by the townspeople to work as slave labour.  A few months later, Dr. Kennedy ([[Ian McKellen]]) and Mr. Swaffer (Joss Ackland) are playing chess when Yanko approaches and shows the men a series of brilliant chess moves. Dr. Kennedy soon determines that the man is in fact Russian. Having gained a newfound respect for the stranger, the Swaffers take him in, start paying him for his labor, and give him normal working hours. Yanko learns from the doctor that Miss Swaffer ([[Kathy Bates]]), on the eve of her wedding day, had a horse-riding accident and broke her spine. The doctor also reveals that he lost his wife and son to typhus "many lifetimes ago." The doctor's fatherly affection for Yanko is evident in their meetings, where Yanko learns English and the doctor learns chess. The doctor purchases Yanko a new suit of clothes, which gives him the courage to visit Amy and ask her to go for walks.  When Mr. Swaffer learns of Yanko's interest in Amy, he tries to dissuade her from any romantic involvement. Amy's parents also urge her to stay away—her mother warning her that love is "God's trick upon women." When Yanko goes to church, he encounters a hostility in the congregation that bewilders him. "Their eyes are like glass," he later tells Amy, who finds him at the obelisk memorial for the ship's dead. There he learns for the first time what happened to his fellow passengers. To escape the hate, Amy takes Yanko to her secret cave filled with treasures she found on the shore, which she calls "gifts from the sea." Yanko and Amy make love in the cave.  Soon after, while walking alone in town, Yanko is set upon by Amy's father and his thuggish friends, beaten up, and nearly drowned before being saved by Amy, who takes care of him in the coming days. Meanwhile, Dr. Kennedy has little sympathy for Amy, whom he considers "a little strange" and "slow of the mind". After chastising the father and his thuggish friends, Miss Swaffer arranges for a preacher to come and marry Amy and Yanko. Amy's father, however, retains his hatred for Amy whom he reveals to be in fact the child of ''his'' father, saying, "Not a tear. Bad you were conceived and bad you've remained."  After someone sets fire to Amy's cave, Miss Swaffer arranges for the cottage to be given to Amy and Yanko, who are soon married in church. Afterwards, they make love in the cave pool, with Yanko saying, "We are the lucky ones." Later that year they have a son, who is delivered by the doctor. Amy asks Yanko to show the child the sea, and he does, while the doctor looks on approvingly. Amy's new-found happiness, however, is soon cut short by the towns children who taunt her and call her a witch. When Yanko learns of this, he is angry and shares his feelings with Dr. Kennedy, who tries to console him. Believing he cannot leave because Amy has found a home in Cornwall, Yanko's greater concern is for his child and his future. Yanko tells the doctor, "I want him to be like you ... I want him to have the learning of great men. I want him to love the mystery of our universe." The doctor pledges to help his son.  One day Yanko becomes sick with a fever. Dr. Kennedy arrives and treats him, gives Amy medicine to give to Yanko, and urges her to stay with him while the doctor continues his rounds. Unfortunately, Yanko's condition worsens and he becomes delirious—seeing a vision of his sinking ship. Unable to understand what he's saying, Amy doesn't know what to do, and when Yanko loses control, Amy flees the cottage with the child in a rainstorm in search of help. Her first stop is at her parents' house, but her mother turns her away. On the road she stops a neighbor and pleads for help, but is also rejected. Finally, she makes it to the Swaffers' house, and Miss Swaffer agrees to watch the baby while Mr. Swaffer accompanies Amy back to her cottage. Meanwhile, Dr. Kennedy returns to the cottage and discovers Yanko lying on the floor near death. Shortly after, Amy arrives and takes her dying husband in her arms as he says, "I would change nothing, my love, my gold—we are the lucky ones."  In the coming weeks, Dr. Kennedy complains to Miss Swaffer about Amy not showing appropriate grief for her deceased husband. He wonders how she could wipe Yanko's memory from her mind so easily, but Miss Swaffer points out that the doctor has wiped from his memory his own ghosts of his dead wife and son. Soon after, Dr. Kennedy visits Amy and apologizes for wronging her, asks to be forgiven, and the two embrace. Amy declares, "I will love him until the end of the world." Dr. Kennedy concludes his story to Miss Swaffer saying, "He came across the world to love and be loved by Amy Foster."

While she secures the rest of the house, the babysitter is grabbed from behind and an unseen killer slices open her [[femoral artery]]. The killer goes upstairs and wraps the young boy in a blanket.   Three months later, a man and a cleaning woman are killed in a motel room in [[Amarillo, Texas]]. The man's femoral artery was severed and the woman's throat was cut. Longtime sheriff Buck Olmstead ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) is up for re-election. Both Olmstead and his opponent, city police chief Jack McGinnis ([[William Fichtner]]), are eager to be the one to solve such a big murder case before Election Day.   Meanwhile, Lane Dixon ([[Jared Leto]]), a hitchhiker, is picked up by Bob ([[Danny Glover]]), a drifter driving a white [[Cadillac Eldorado]] upholstered with pictures of naked women. Unnerved by the pictures, Dixon asks to be let out of the car at a miners' bar, which Bob warns against. Dixon is in the bar for a few minutes before getting beat up by a group of miners. Bob rescues Dixon and sends him out to retrieve the car. As Dixon drives them away, Bob reveals that he has removed the valve stems from all the tires in the parking lot.   Back in Amarillo, FBI agent Frank LaCrosse ([[Dennis Quaid]]) arrives to inform Olmstead about his investigation of an elusive serial killer, whom he suspects is responsible for the motel murders. They track down the red SUV that was spotted driving away from the motel. LaCrosse confronts the owner, who has barricaded himself in an apartment and taken a family hostage. LaCrosse finds out that the man stole the SUV, and immediately deduces that he does not fit the profile of his killer. But his long criminal history, which includes previous violent crimes, makes McGinnis eager to pin the motel murders on the man. His lawyer reveals to LaCrosse and Olmstead that the man had stolen the SUV from an airport parking lot. Olmstead's men check the surveillance tapes at the lot and find the plates for a white Cadillac Eldorado, which belonged to one of the serial killer's victims. They put out an APB on the car.   Bob and Dixon are now in Colorado and the car is struggling with the elevation. At the next town, Martensburg, they stop at Shorty's Auto Repair. Shorty ([[Leo Burmester]]) is an old friend of Bob's, and they reminisce as Shorty fixes the car. Bob goes down the street to a general store to buy some candy corn. The teller gripes about having to mind the store as a storm approaches, making it clear that she is all alone. Bob follows her around the store and toys with a box cutter before propositioning the woman. Just as their interaction turns menacing, Dixon arrives to tell Bob that Shorty has fixed the car. Noticing a police officer leaving Shorty's as they approach the shop, Bob claims to have forgotten something inside. He kills Shorty while Dixon waits in the car.   Dixon drives them away toward the mountains. Bob assures them that they are ahead of the storm. When Bob takes over the wheel, he careens down the other side of the mountains. He tells Dixon about his son, and asks Dixon  to look in on his boy as a sort of godfather, should anything happen to him. Bob gives Dixon the boy's address and then loses control of the car. Both men nearly die in the crash, but they escape before the car crashes off a cliff.   In Amarillo, the FBI has ordered Olmstead to keep LaCrosse in town until they arrive. They explain that he is assigned to another case in Philadelphia and that the investigation into the serial killer has been closed for months. LaCrosse reveals to Olmstead that the FBI believes the man who appeared on the porch before the little boy was abducted was the killer, because he committed suicide amid all kinds of evidence that linked him to the murders. LaCrosse believed it was too pat. He reveals to Olmstead that the abducted little boy is LaCrosse's son Andy. He shows Olmstead a picture of Andy that the killer sent him, which has a message on the back that reads, "2-18 To find him, you must kill me. To understand me, you must come to Believe." Olmstead then asks about the "2-18" reference, implying a date. LaCrosse says that it could be a date, or a reference to how many people have been killed. He reveals that the FBI had considered every interpretation without coming to a conclusion regarding the "2-18" reference. It is apparent that, if it referred to February 18, "2-18" is only a few days away.  When word reaches LaCrosse about Shorty's murder in Martensburg, Olmstead arranges for him to take a police helicopter to Colorado, even as he finds out that he has lost the election to McGinnis. Olmstead is placed in custody for violating the FBI's instructions. In Martensburg, LaCrosse is allowed to view the crime scene before being informally detained by the State Police. He surmises that Shorty, who was armed with a pistol, must have known his murderer.   Bob and Dixon manage to walk to a small town, where they crash in a hotel frequented by railroad workers. They all know Bob from the days when he worked on the railroads with Shorty. In Martensburg, LaCrosse realizes that "2-18" refers to a train number, and he frantically pursues the 218 as it heads into the mountains. He crashes a car into a river and barely manages to make it onto the train.  In the morning at Bob and Dixon's hotel, everyone is talking about the fact that the police are looking for a white Cadillac Eldorado upholstered with pictures of naked women driven by a young man who matches Dixon's description. Dixon confronts Bob at gunpoint, who denies any involvement in the murders. Bob explains that he bought the car for $500 cash from a stranger. Dixon calms down and joins Bob on a train, riding in the rear car with the snow scrapers and another friend of Bob's named Tex.   Aboard train 218, LaCrosse confronts a brakeman who boards the train. The brakeman explains that he is just catching a ride home, and he shows LaCrosse a map with a rail marker named "Believe". As LaCrosse sees the map, he is informed by the brakeman that "Understanding" and "Believe" are [[siding (rail)|railroad sidings]], thus explaining where the killer is headed by the references on the message. The brakeman explains that the only train headed towards Believe would be on the upper grade of the [[Zig_zag_(railway)|switchback]]. LaCrosse climbs the mountain to reach the upper grade, just as the train with Bob and Dixon comes into view.  On board, Tex asks if anyone has a light. Bob absentmindedly hands him a matchbook from the motel in Amarillo where the murders took place. When Tex remarks on the coincidence, Dixon looks at Bob in horror. Bob pulls out his knife and severs Tex's femoral artery, revealing that he has set up Dixon to be another fall guy for his crimes. The two of them fight with each other as LaCrosse boards the train. He arrives in the rear car after Dixon has subdued Bob and is tending to Tex. Believing Dixon to be the killer, LaCrosse does not pay enough attention to Bob, who comes to and attacks him.   During the final confrontation, Bob uses Dixon as a human shield and slices his throat before he and LaCrosse end up falling out of the train and onto one of the snowscrapers. LaCrosse grabs Bob before he can fall off the train, demanding to know where his son is. Bob reminds LaCrosse that he has to die first, and wriggles out of LaCrosse's grasp, jumping from the train. This however, backfires, as he winds being impaled on a tree branch and dying. Dixon writes the address that Bob had given him in the dust on the train floor, but when Olmstead and LaCrosse arrive at the location, it is an abandoned house. Just as LaCrosse is about to give up, he notices Andy playing in the yard next door and reunites with his son.

Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward.

'Til There Was You
 Gwen Moss ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]) has spent the better part of her life waiting for the man of her dreams, unaware she briefly bumped into him at school as children and has had several close encounters ever since. She aspires to have a life like her longtime friend Debbie ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), a successful doctor with a beautiful home but a marriage that may not be as perfect as it seems on the surface.  Gwen is hired to [[Ghostwriter|ghostwrite]] the autobiography of former child star Francesca Lanfield ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]), whose career virtually ended following her stint on a long-running ''[[The Partridge Family|Partridge Family]]''-''[[The Brady Bunch|Brady Bunch]]'' [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[situation comedy|sitcom]]. Francesca owns La Fortuna, a picturesque vintage apartment complex (filmed at the historic [[El Cabrillo]]). Architect Nick Dawkan's ([[Dylan McDermott]]) boss Timo wants to buy and demolish the complex so his firm can construct a modern [[condominium]] development in its place. Francesca agrees to the sale as long as Nick is placed in charge of the project, and the two embark on a somewhat tempestuous relationship. Both are damaged emotionally; Francesca has overcome an addiction to drugs but still craves the spotlight, while Nick is dealing with the memory of a father who failed as a songwriter and became a hopeless alcoholic. Meanwhile, Gwen is shocked to discover her father Saul never loved her mother Beebee and is devastated when the two decide to divorce.  Her parents' story of how they met from her childhood turns out to be false: Saul got stood up by his date that night and Beebee thought that he was interested in her.  They only married to "avoid an argument", as Saul puts it.  Gwen moves into La Fortuna and finds herself surrounded by an assortment of odd but lovable neighbors who have created a family of their own. When the tenants are presented with [[eviction]] notices, they decide to fight back. Having discovered the property was designed by Sophia Monroe, one of the first female architects of note (and coincidentally Nick's mentor during the early stages of his career), and served as home to [[silent film]] star [[Louise Brooks]], Gwen hopes she can have it declared an [[California Historical Landmark|historical landmark]] with the assistance of Jon Haas, the city councilman she is dating. Nick is prepared to fight for his firm until he sees La Fortuna and learns its history and decides it might be worth preserving after all.  Though ultimately unsuccessful in preserving La Fortuna, they finally meet at the [[Nicotine Anonymous]] meeting, are then happily married, and have a daughter together.

Time Under Fire
 In 1990, the naval submarine  accidentally enters a portal in the Bermuda Triangle and disappears. Captain Alan Deakins, the submarine's commander, resurfaces several years later claiming to have traveled to the future. The navy refuses to believe him and he is confined to a mental institution. A paranormal research organization headed by Lance McCarty ([[Jack Coleman (actor)|Jack Coleman]]) bankrolls an expedition to recreate the circumstances of the accident in order to discover the truth. A government official, Charles Braddock ([[Brian Cranston]]) authorizes Deakins' breakout from a mental institution in order to participate in the expedition. Before leaving, Deakins visits his heartbroken wife, Jeannie ([[Kimberly Stevens]]) who, overjoyed to rediscover he is alive, tries to convince him not to leave.  The expedition, including Deakins, McCarty, McCarty's assistant Marjorie (Linda Hoffman), and military men Schmidt ([[Jay Acovone]]), Cole ([[Larry Poindexter]]), and Hawks (Richard Cummings), leaves the next morning. The submarine successfully enters the portal, and after crossing is attacked and boarded by a military vessel. The leader of the force, Koda ([[Richard Tyson]]) claims to recognize Deakins, and captures the crew. In lockup, Deakins meets a man, Spitz ([[Chick Vennera]]) who tells them that they are in a post-apocalyptic year 2077, in which the U.S. is ruled by a dictatorship led by Charles Braddock. Deakins' son, John (also played by Fahey), is the leader of the rebellion. A guard kills Schmidt for talking back and sexually assaults Marjorie. Deakins kills him after finding out.  Spitz breaks Deakins, Marjorie, and Hawks out of prison. They travel to the rebels' base and meet Alan's son John. John explains that Braddock is attempting to create an army of cyborgs who can alter their appearance to look like humans. John enlists their assistance in an assault on Braddock's base to recover the computer chip which is key to the cyborgs' creation. Braddock orders the elder Deakins killed in order to alter the timeline so that John would never be born.  They infiltrate the base, recover the chip, and rescue Lance. John and Cole are believed to have been killed in the escape. However, John reappears to rescue them and they board a submarine in order to cross back into the past. They are pursued by Koda, but destroy his submarine and escape back to 1997. Soon, Spitz notices odd behavior by John, and discovers that he is actually a cyborg clone, who is then destroyed by Alan.  Deakins returns home to Jeannie, who is pregnant (presumably, with John). Hawks is revealed to be a traitor, and meets covertly with Braddock to give him the cyborg chip. Braddock then orders Hawks to kill Deakins to prevent the future rebellion. Lance attempts to assassinate Braddock in his office, but after shooting him, discovers that he is a cyborg clone. The real Braddock emerges with a gun to Lance's head. After a brief struggle, Lance finally kills Braddock. Hawks invades Deakins' home, and in the ensuing fight, Jeannie and Hawks are killed.  With Braddock's death, the heroes are assumed to have prevented the impending apocalypse. In an interrogation room, Spitz explains everything to skeptical government officials. However, after Spitz confirms Jeannie's death (thus John's nonexistence), they murder Spitz. The officials are actually working for a surviving cyborg clone of Charles Braddock.  
Tomorrow Never Dies
 [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] sends [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], agent 007, into the field to spy on a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite [[M (James Bond)|M]]'s insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS ''Chester'' to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an [[L-39 Albatros]], and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.  The [[Media proprietor|media baron]] Elliot Carver soon begins his plans to use a stolen encoder obtained at the bazaar by his henchman, [[cyberterrorism|cyberterrorist]] Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the United Kingdom; he hopes to replace the Chinese government with one that will give him exclusive broadcasting rights. [[Meaconing]] the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the British frigate HMS ''Devonshire'' off-course into Chinese-held waters in the [[South China Sea]], where Carver's [[stealth ship]], commanded by [[List of James Bond henchmen in Tomorrow Never Dies#Mr. Stamper|Mr. Stamper]], sinks it and steals one of its missiles, while shooting down a Chinese [[Chengdu J-7|J-7 fighter jet]] and killing off the ''Devonshire'''s survivors with Chinese weaponry. The British [[Minister of Defence]] orders Roebuck to deploy the British Fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, while leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war.  M sends Bond to investigate Carver after he releases news articles about the crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to [[Hamburg]] and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He also knocks out three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. After Bond steals back the GPS encoder, Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is murdered by Carver's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the encoder. Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, and goes to the South China Sea to investigate the wreck (which was actually in Vietnamese waters). He and [[Wai Lin]], a Chinese agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in [[Saigon]]. They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation.  The two contact the Royal Navy and the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] to explain Carver's scheme; Carver plans to use the stolen missile to destroy the Chinese government, and allow a Chinese general to step in and stop war between Britain and China, although not before both sides destroy each other at sea; once the war is over, Carver's media group will be given exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next century. They find Carver's stealth ship, which has been built with stolen stealth material, in [[Ha Long Bay]], and board it to prevent him from firing the stolen British cruise missile at Beijing. During the attempt, Wai Lin is captured, forcing Bond to devise a second plan. Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage, but Carver kills Gupta, claiming he has "outlived his contract." Bond detonates an explosive which damages the ship, causing it to be visible to radar to both Chinese and British navies, who have just been warned of the plot, and thus making it vulnerable to a subsequent Royal Navy attack by [[HMS Bedford|HMS ''Bedford'']]. While Wai Lin disables the engines, and is captured by Stamper, Bond attempts to halt the missile. After killing Carver with his own sea drill, Bond attempts to destroy the warhead with detonators, but Stamper appears and attacks him after sending Wai Lin into the water, bound in chains. Bond traps Stamper in the missile firing mechanism and dives to save Wai Lin as the missile explodes, destroying the ship and killing Stamper. Later, Bond and Wai Lin share a romantic moment amidst the wreckage as the ''Bedford'' searches for them.

Tromeo and Juliet
    Set in modern-day [[Manhattan]], the film begins with the [[narrator]] ([[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]]) introducing two families: the Capulets and the Ques.  At the center of these families are [[Romeo Montague|Tromeo Que]] and [[Juliet Capulet]]. Tromeo lives in squalor with his alcoholic father Monty and works at a tattoo parlor with his cousin [[Benvolio|Benny]] and friend [[Mercutio|Murray]]. Juliet is sequestered in her family’s mansion, watched over by her abusive father [[Lord Capulet|Cappy]], passive mother [[Lady Capulet|Ingrid]], and overprotective cousin [[Tybalt|Tyrone]], all the while being sexually satisfied by family servant Ness ([[Debbie Rochon]]).  Both Tromeo and Juliet are trapped in cases of [[unrequited love]]: Tromeo lusts for the big-bosomed, promiscuous [[Rosaline|Rosie]]; Juliet is engaged to wealthy [[meat]] tycoon [[Count Paris|London Arbuckle]] as prelude to an [[arranged marriage]].  In the meantime, a bloody brawl between Murray and Sammy Capulet catches the attention of [[Prince Escalus|Detective Ernie Scalus]], who gathers the heads of the two families together and declares that they will be held personally accountable for any further breaches of peace. Almost immediately afterwards, Monty and Cappy start threatening each other with weapons. Sammy gets caught in the window of Monty’s speeding car, where he is thrown head-first into a fire hydrant and (very slowly) dies.  On the insistence of Murray and Benny, Tromeo attends the Capulets' masquerade ball in the hopes of meeting Rosie, only to find another man performing [[cunnilingus]] on her. Tromeo staggers around the party in disillusion until he locks eyes with those of Juliet. The two instantly fall for each other and share a dance until an angry Tyrone chases him out of the house.  Tromeo and Juliet continue to be enamored by one another from afar. Cappy, disgusted at his daughter’s active [[libido]], forcefully imprisons her in a plastic cage as punishment. Tromeo sneaks into the house of Capulet and the two meet once again. After proclaiming their love for each other both verbally and [[sexual intercourse|physically]], they agree to be married. Juliet breaks her engagement with Arbuckle and, with the help of [[Friar Lawrence|Father Lawrence]], the two are married in secrecy the next day.  Tyrone, upon discovering Juliet‘s secret affair, gathers his gang together and challenges Tromeo to a duel. Now a kinsman to the Capulets, Tromeo refuses to fight, suggesting to both sides to bring the lifelong feud to an end. Murray accepts the duel on Tromeo’s behalf and, in the ensuing brawl, is mortally wounded by Tyrone‘s club. Tromeo, enraged by his friend’s death, pursues Tyrone and slays him (through a series of car crashes which dismember him) and goes into hiding from the police.  Learning that she is involved with Tromeo, Cappy savagely beats Juliet and forces her to reconcile with Arbuckle. Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the marriage is set. Juliet visits Father Lawrence, who reunites her with Tromeo and enlists the help of Fu Chang, the [[apothecary]], who sells Juliet a special potion which will aide her predicament.  On the day of her wedding, Juliet swallows the apothecary’s potion, transforming her into a hideous cow monster, complete with a three-foot [[penis]]. The mere sight of her causes Arbuckle to leap out of Juliet’s window in fright, committing suicide. Enraged over the loss of his would-be son-in-law and meat inheritance, Cappy attempts to rape and murder Juliet, but Tromeo arrives just in time, knocking Cappy unconscious and bringing Juliet’s appearance back to normal by a single kiss. Cappy awakens, taking both lovers captive by [[crossbow]]-point. While he is distracted, Juliet performs one last act of defiance against her father and electrocutes him.  As Tromeo and Juliet leave the house of Capulet, they are confronted by Ingrid and Monty, who reveal to them the real reason behind the Capulet/Que feud: Long ago, Cappy and Monty were the owners of the successful Silky Films production company. Ingrid, married to Monty at time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own. Faced with a divorce from Ingrid and the threat of having his son taken away from him, Monty was forced to sign over all the rights of Silky Films to the Capulets in exchange for his son. After the initial shock at the revelation that they are siblings, Tromeo and Juliet are determined not to let their whole ordeal be for naught; they [[incest|passionately embrace]] and drive off into the sunset.  The film picks up six years later in Tromaville, New Jersey, where Tromeo and Juliet, now married, have become suburban [[yuppie]]s with a house and (birth defected/deformed) children of their own.  The film ends with the narrator’s brief poem for the lovers: ''"And all of our hearts free to let all things base go/As taught by Juliet and her Tromeo"''. A brief shot of William Shakespeare laughing uproariously is shown before the end credits.

He now writes for a [[supermarket tabloid]], "The National Inquisitor" with the help of his young niece Anna ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) with whom Buzzy is close friends. An elderly woman named Abigail Gregory comes to visit Buzzy, and explains that on [[Halloween]] in 1939, she was witness to a bizarre incident in the Hollywood Tower Hotel, when five hotel guests - singer Carolyn Crosson, actor Gilbert London, much-loved child star Sally Shine, her [[nanny]] Emeline Partridge, and [[bellhop]] Dewey Todd, - mysteriously disappeared without a trace when lightning struck the elevator they were in on their way up to a party at the hotel's Tip Top Club.  Abigail says that the nanny, Emeline, was a bitter witch who tried to put a curse on Sally, only for the curse to misfire, trapping all of the five people who were in the elevator as [[ghost]]s, who haunt the hotel. Buzzy investigates the shuttered hotel and finds book of spells mentioned in Abigail's story. The book reveals the curse can be reversed by its "contrary." Abigail also explains that items belonging to the passengers must be found, and what happened in 1939 must be repeated to break the curse. Buzzy and Anna enlist the help of Chris "Q" Todd, the hotel caretaker and grandson of Dewey, the bellhop. Q is reluctant, but he decides to help his deceased grandfather and the four guests, especially as he stands to inherit the hotel if an explanation to the 1939 event is revealed.  Inside the hotel Buzzy and Anna meet an actress named "Claire Poulet", who had been hired so Buzzy could take fake pictures of the "ghosts" for the supermarket tabloid. Buzzy tries to develop a relationship with Claire, but she is dismayed when Buzzy expresses more interest in restoring his career than helping the spirits. Fearing an intrusion, some of the ghosts appear and repeatedly attempt to frighten off Buzzy and Anna, but Anna steadfastly offers to help the ghosts escape the curse. Finally the ghost of Carolyn appears. It is immediately apparent that she is the same "Claire Poulet" that Buzzy already talked to. Anna accuses Emeline of cursing the other guests. Shocked and dismayed at [[fall guy|being put to blame]], Emeline states her innocence, to which the other ghosts agree.<ref name="emeline"></ref>  Jill meanwhile has been researching Buzzy's story more and learns that Abigail is the sister of Sally Shine. Abigail was secretly jealous of her younger sister's talents and fame. Although Halloween was Abigail's birthday, no one seemed to have remembered: no presents, no party. Abigail was the one who cursed her sister. Abigail has been in a sanitarium ever since, but is allowed out on day release.  Buzzy realizes that finding the personal effects of the guests (a [[Lock of hair|lock of Sally's hair]], Ms. Partridge's [[handkerchief]], Dewey's spare [[bell-boy hat]], Gilbert's [[Pince-nez#Others|Oxford spectacles]], and Carolyn's [[locket]]) and repairing the elevator has given Abigail the means to complete the curse. He and Jill rush back to the hotel, but they are too late. The ghosts are boarding repaired the elevator. Anna runs in, but only Sally makes it out of the elevator before the doors close and the car moves up the shaft. The group confronts Abigail, who then tearfully admits her actions before Sally appears.<ref></ref>  The elevator continues to move up, but gets stuck on the eleventh floor, with only minutes left before the final phase of the curse comes into effect. Sally explains that the party was a surprise birthday party for Abigail and apologizes to Abigail for not being able to get to it. Sally has kept the present she wanted to give to Abby: a golden friendship bracelet with two hearts engraved with their names. Abigail is distraught at her mistake but doesn't know how to stop the spell. Buzzy, Q, Jill, Abby,  and Sally board the service elevator, catching up with the others on the eleventh floor. Anna manages to leap from an emergency escape hatch, rejoining Buzzy and the others, but at exactly 8:05pm, lightning strikes the hotel again, and both cars plummet towards the basement. Amidst the chaos, Sally and Abby reconcile, breaking the curse. As they lovingly hold hands, they both dissolve into a shower of golden sparkles that safely stop both elevators just as they were about to crash.  Buzzy and his group follow up behind as Carolyn, Gilbert, Dewey, Emeline, and  Sally finally ascend to the Tip-Top Club, restored to its former glory. One by one, the ghosts then ascend to Heaven, along with the other partygoers. Abigail, now a child again, appears with Sally, and thanks her for the present. The sisters then hold hands and vanish into golden sparkles, reversing the curse on the hotel. With the spell broken, the Hollywood Tower Hotel is restored and re-opened to the public, with Q taking charge as the new owner.  
Troops (film)
 An example of the film's comedic tone comes in the opening monologue, which spoofs the opening of ''COPS:'' "TROOPS is filmed on location with the men of the Imperial Forces. All suspects are guilty--period! Otherwise, they wouldn't be suspects, would they?" Adding to the comic tone are the accents from the stormtoopers which is very reminiscent to the accents heard in the movie ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]''.  A small visual gag near the beginning of the film is that the stolen Imperial droid recovered from the [[List of Star Wars races (F-J)#Jawa|Jawas]] appears to be [[Tom Servo]] from ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.  In ''TROOPS'' there is a notable alternate (tongue-in-cheek) take on the deaths of [[Luke Skywalker]]'s [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Uncle Owen]] and [[List of Star Wars characters#L|Aunt Beru]], presenting their fate as the end result of a domestic dispute gone too far, rather than execution at the hands of Imperial forces. Indeed, the spotlighted members of Black Sheep Squadron attempt to mediate the dispute before Beru makes a disastrous move with a [[List of Star Wars weapons#Heavy ranged|thermal detonator]].  The film ends with an incoming message about a possible disturbance in Mos Eisley Cantina.  
Trojan War (film)

After she asks him to come over one night to tutor her, she ends up wanting to have sex with him. But she only wants [[safe sex]], and he does not have a [[condom]] (the use of Trojan in the title is a pun on the [[Trojan (condoms)|condom brand of the same name]]). In his quest to buy some condoms, he runs into all sorts of trouble; his dad's [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]  gets stolen and then wrecked, he has a run-in with a crazy bus driver ([[Anthony Michael Hall]]), he is held hostage, he is pursued by a school janitor (Paulo Tocha) who accuses him of drawing [[graffiti]], an odd pair of [[Hispanic]] siblings (Christine Deaver and Mike Moroff) who thinks he looks like [[David Hasselhoff]], Brooke's dog, Brooke's jealous boyfriend Kyle ([[Eric Balfour]]), and a homeless man ([[David Patrick Kelly]]) who wants two dollars from him (and has secretly stolen his wallet), and he is arrested.  After all of this and finally receiving a condom from a police officer who releases him, he realizes that the perfect girl has been there for him all along: his best friend Leah ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]), who has had feelings for him for a long time unbeknownst to Brad.

Charlie coaches Richard as to the use of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence|rules of evidence]], masquerading as Richard's "assistant", surreptitiously using flash cards to tell Richard which basis for objection to use.

With the new [[Power Rangers: Turbo|Turbo]] powers and their new vehicular Turbo Zords, the Rangers drive across the desert to a ship called the Ghost Galleon. They are joined by Justin, who has received Rocky's powers as the new Blue Turbo Ranger, as Rocky is unable to rejoin his friends. On Divatox's submarine, Jason and Kimberly work on a plan to escape. When the Ghost Galleon and Divatox's submarine arrive at the Nemesis Triangle, Divatox forces Lerigot to allow them to cross while the Rangers do the same with the keys to their Ranger powers.  Once they reach the island where Maligore is imprisoned, Divatox torpedoes the ship and Rangers narrowly escape in their Turbo cars. Bulk, Skull, and Kimberly escape the sub, but Jason is trapped and left behind. Kimberly is then captured by the Malicians, inhabitants of the island, and Divatox forces Lerigot to unlock the temple in the volcano and make the Malicians join her with Kimberly. The Rangers morph and fight Divatox's forces at the temple, but are unable to free Jason and Kimberly before the two are possessed by Maligore and attack the Rangers mercilessly. The Rangers free Lerigot and his wife Yara, who undo the possession.  Angered, Divatox sacrifices her nephew and successfully revives Maligore. The Rangers summon their Turbo Megazord to fight Maligore. They defeat him as Divatox and [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Rygog|Rygog]] flee, vowing vengeance. The Rangers pick up Jason, Kimberly, Lerigot, Yara, Bulk, and Skull and return to Angel Grove. At the competition, Jason takes Rocky's place, and they win the tournament, earning the money in order to save the shelter.  
Twin Town
 Set in [[Port Talbot]] and [[Swansea]], the Lewis "twins" of the title are not twins but brothers. They live with their parents and sister Adie in a caravan on a mobile home site. Constantly mocking their sister's employment at a local massage parlour, they spend most of their time joking around, taking drugs and stealing cars.  Their father "Fatty Lewis", falls from a ladder while doing roofing work for Bryn Cartwright, a wealthy, prominent local businessman and small-time gangster. Laying blame, the twins attempt to demand [[workers' compensation]] for the accident. Bryn claims it was a cash arrangement with no legal representation and refuses the request for compensation. The twins take this personally and seek revenge by gatecrashing and ruining a local [[karaoke]] competition in which Bryn's daughter, beautiful Bonny is singing, by appearing from back stage and urinating on her during the performance in the Barons nightclub in Swansea. Bryn vows to get even and acquires the help of his associates Greyo and Terry (two corrupt police detectives), to assist him getting revenge on the twins. After several efforts to disrupt their way of life, Bryn appears to succeed by having one of the detectives to assist him in beating up the twins down a back street.  As retaliation continues, the feud spirals out of control, progressing with the twins breaking into Bryn's property and beheading the Cartwrights' pet [[poodle]]. Terry Walsh responds by setting fire to the Lewis' dog's kennel with their pet inside. However, an adjacent gas bottle explodes, destroying the Lewises' [[mobile home]] and killing the twins' family. Clearly upset, the twins make arrangements with the local male voice choir and steal their father's hearse at his funeral. Terry meanwhile, much to Greyo's distress, accuses Fatty's co-workers Dai and Chip of destroying the caravan by placing items from the scene of the crime in their builder's van. The twins soon come down from the hills where they have been hiding out and go after Bryn, breaking into his house again and tying him up with washing line rigged to his own electric garage door. The twins ask to borrow Bryn's boat to which he agrees, with the hope of the twins letting him go unhurt. The twins disappear leaving Bryn tied up and at the brink of asphyxiation in his own garage. Upon arrival of Lucy later that evening, she attempts to use the electric gate remote from outside while returning home, causing the garage door to lift and subsequently cause the hanging of her husband Bryn. By looking under the door and noticing the hanging, Lucy hysterically runs through the house and finds their daughter floating on a lilo in their indoor swimming pool listening to music through headphones, blissfully unaware of what had gone on.  The twins consider their job done and grant their father's wish of having a burial at sea with the assistance of Bryn's boat, with the coffin respectfully draped in the [[Flag of Wales|Welsh flag]]. It is a poignant moment as the local choir (formed from a number of real-life local [[male voice choir]]s) sing the [[Welsh language]] song ''[[Myfanwy]]'' at the end of [[Mumbles Pier]]. Meanwhile, Terry Walsh, terrified and pleading, has been gagged and bound to the coffin, and lowered into the sea just off the pier head of Mumbles Swansea. The coffin floats for a while before the twins make a bet to how long the coffin would stay afloat, seemingly brushing aside the emotion of their father's funeral at sea.  The coffin sinks and a few tears are shed by the twins. The twins then question each other on how far the boat would travel and imply that they would be heading to [[Morocco]]. The boat is last seen heading out to sea, driven by the twins to a haunting choir still singing on the Mumbles pier.  
Turbulence (1997 film)
  After Ryan Weaver ([[Ray Liotta]]) is arrested in [[New York City]] for a murder that he says he did not commit, he must be transported to [[Los Angeles]] to face trial. He and another prisoner, Stubbs ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), are escorted by four [[US marshals]] on a Boeing 747-200 on a commercial flight. Even though it is Christmas Eve, the 747 is nearly empty, with only 11 people on board. The entire cabin is highly decorated with Christmas trees and other decorations.  During the 5 hour flight, Stubbs breaks free while using the bathroom and begins a shootout with the marshals, and at some point in the fight, a stray bullet fired from one of the Marshall's sidearms punches a hole in the fuselage, instantly triggering an explosive decompression. Amidst the chaos, the Captain is fatally shot, and the First Officer is also killed when his head slams into the yoke, disengaging the autopilot in the process and a stray bullet bores a hole in a lavatory window. Weaver frees himself and attempts to save the last remaining marshal, but fails when both Stubbs shoots the marshal dead, after being shot himself.  Weaver appears to be horrified by the ordeal, increasing the passengers' trust in him. Because of the death of the pilots, Teri Halloran ([[Lauren Holly]]), a flight attendant, makes her way into the cockpit and learns she is the only one left capable of keeping the 747 from crashing. To make matters worse, the plane is heading for a storm which threatens level 6 (severe) turbulence.  Weaver's behavior becomes increasingly erratic since he is paranoid of being sentenced to death upon landing and occasionally suffers nervous breakdowns. He then locks the passengers in the crew's cabin;  and strangles Maggie ([[Catherine Hicks]]), one of the other flight attendants, to death. He then calls LAX FBI control center and threatens to crash the 747 into their facility since he is now on a suicide mission, and is willing to do anything to avoid being arrested. His motives had become clear to Teri after she spoke, via the 747's radio, with the detective who arrested him.  Being the only hope for the 747's survival, Teri must be instructed by radio how to land. After the plane barely survives extreme turbulence during the storm, Teri's first attempt is unsuccessful, with the 747 skimming an office building's roof Japanese restaurant and a car park due to Weaver altering the circuitry in the avionics bay. As the plane's landing gear collides with several vehicles in the multilevel car park, it picks up an SUV, which alters the plane's course. She then must turn the plane around and leave Los Angeles airspace. The [[LAX]] airport chief sends a U.S. Navy F-14 Tomcat Fighter jet to shoot down the 747.  Teri begs [[LAX]] not to have her shot down as a result of her failed first attempt caused by Weaver, and insists that she can land the plane. At this point, Weaver, completely drunk and crazy, breaks into the cockpit with an axe and tries to murder her, but the F-14 Tomcat shoots down the SUV instead and the 747 is shaken up, giving chance to Teri to attack, grabs one of the marshals' guns, and Weaver attacked while she found a bullet to load the gun. While she has him at gunpoint, Weaver says she's not gonna kill him because she doesn't believe in capital punishment, but then she says she changed her mind. Then squeezing the trigger hoping the gun would go off, it finally does, shooting Weaver through the head and killing him. Teri returns to the pilot's seat and safely lands the 747, Despite the boasts of Weaver that he killed them all, the other crew and passengers are found alive.

The Ugly
 The film takes place in an old, worn down insane asylum in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, run by Dr. Marlowe (Roy Ward). Simon Cartwright ([[Paolo Rotondo]]), one of his patients, is seeking an appeal from a psychiatrist to get a reevaluation of his mental state. He wants to prove that he’s been cured; Simon is a [[serial killer]] who has killed over a dozen different people. He wants a psychiatrist from outside of the asylum to take his case, and he specifically asks for Dr. Karen Shumaker. Dr. Shumaker (Rebecca Hobbs) has recently gained some publicity from winning a case involving another serial killer.  There are two orderlies, Philip and Robert (Paul Glover and Christopher Graham), who are in charge of watching over the insane asylum’s patients. They are always harassing and abusing Simon. In the opening scene they bring him to a visitor’s room and cover the camera up so they can start beating him up. They also spit in his food and are always violent and aggressive with him. When Dr. Shumaker arrives, she argues with Dr. Marlowe about seeing Cartwright; they don’t quite see eye to eye. Marlowe accuses her of only doing it to increase her publicity; however she tells him that it is Simon that has personally asked for her and so she proceeds with the visit. As she is led to the room where Simon is waiting, there is another patient, Marge (Darien Takle) roaming in the hallway outside the room Simon is in. She attacks Dr. Shumaker telling her to watch out for "The Ugly." When Shumaker finally gets to the interview room she and Cartwright begin their session.  Simon does not have a specific type of victim; this is not typical in a serial killer. His kills are random and Dr. Shumaker wants to know why. She asks if he feels any remorse or guilt, but he does not. All he says is that he simply had to kill them. As they talk through their session, the movie shifts to a number of flashbacks. First they delve into Simon's childhood, only to find out that he was bullied as a child and that his mother abused him. As an adolescent, the only person he had ever cared about, Julie (Vanessa Byrnes), was driven away by his mother ([[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]]). Simon found out that his father wanted custody of him so he could live a better life because of his wealth, but his horrible mother kept this information from him all this time. In response to this, Simon ends up slashing his mother's throat. He tries to make it look like a robbery took place and burns the house down, but the cops figure out what really happened. Simon is then locked away in an asylum for five years.  Once he is released, he starts killing again. He kills lots of different people; his victims range from men to women, old and young. It seems as though there is no pattern in the way he chooses his victims, that it’s all the same to him. However, we learn of an instance in which he spares the life of a thirteen-year-old deaf girl. He tells Dr. Shumaker that he did not kill the girl because she was different: she was like him. Although he does not have a specific type of victim, Simon does have a signature method of killing. He slashes people’s throats with a large [[straight razor]]. He says that it is "the ugly" that makes him kill; it will not leave him alone until he has satisfied its voice. He and Julie got together until one night he murdered her. As Dr. Shumaker delves deeper into his psyche, she discovers that Simon, who claims to be haunted by the voices of his victims telling him to kill, as well as a malignant alternate persona called "The Ugly," may not be so much crazy as he is tortured inside from years of physical and psychological abuse. Simon reveals to have psychic powers.  At the end, Simon kills Philip and Robert, escaped the insane asylum, and he kills Dr. Shumaker.

Suddenly, the man next to them ecstatically declares that he has won the game. In his burst of joy, he suddenly begins to slip in and out of consciousness while Ellen sends Rusty for help.

Vanishing Point (1997 film)
 The bare bones of the plot of this remake are the same as the original [[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|1971 film]], but the number of major characters has grown.  Kowalski and the radio DJ's characters have been changed significantly, and the plot is changed as a result. The DJ does not have the [[supernatural]] power to speak with Kowalski through the [[radio]] but instead seeks the truth about Kowalski's sketchy past. The Kowalski in the original actually drove for the pure love of speed borne out of a personal quest for freedom and to escape the ghosts of his past experiences. The remake however, gives Kowalski a more clear and socially accepted background and reason to drive fast. The Kowalski of the 1971 movie was an archetypal antihero, set against the backdrop of the fringe-dwelling people of the 1960s and early 1970s.  The 1997 TV remake replaces the lead character's ambivalent image with a simpler and more palatable, wholesome lead character and motivations, and in particular eliminates all references to drug use, rebellion or sexuality, all of which were hallmarks of the 1971 film.

Wag the Dog
 The President is caught making advances on an underage Firefly Girl inside the [[Oval Office]], less than two weeks before the election. Conrad Brean, a top [[spin doctor]], is brought in to take the public's attention away from the scandal. He decides to construct a fictional war in Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead. Brean contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss to create the war, complete with a theme song and fake film footage of a photogenic orphan. The hoax is initially successful, with the President quickly gaining ground in the polls after appearing.  When the CIA learns of the plot, they send Agent Young to confront Brean about the hoax. Brean convinces Young that revealing the deception is against his (and the CIA's) best interests. But when the CIA—in collusion with the President's rival candidate—reports that the war did happen but is drawing to an end, the media begins to focus back on the President's sexual abuse scandal. To counter this, Motss decides to invent a hero who was left behind enemy lines in Albania. Inspired by the idea that he was "discarded like an old shoe", Brean and Motss have the Pentagon provide the team with a soldier named Schumann around whom a POW narrative is constructed, complete with T-shirts, patriotic songs and, [[Astroturfing|faux-grassroots]] demonstrations of patriotism.  When the team goes to retrieve Schumann, they discover he is in fact a criminally insane Army convict. On the way back, their plane crashes en route to [[Andrews Air Force Base]]. The team survives and is rescued by a farmer, who kills Schumann after he attempts to rape his daughter. Seizing the opportunity, Motss stages an elaborate military funeral for Schumann, claiming that he died from wounds sustained during his rescue.  While watching a political talk show, Motss gets frustrated that the media are crediting the president's upsurge in the polls to the bland campaign slogan of "Don't change horses in mid-stream" rather than Motss's hard work. Despite previously claiming he was inspired by the challenge, Motss announces that he wants credit and will reveal his involvement, despite Brean's offer of an ambassadorship and the dire warning that he is "playing with his life". After Motss refuses to back down, Brean reluctantly orders his security staff to kill him. A newscast reports that Motss has died of a heart attack at home, the president was successfully re-elected, and an Albanian terrorist organization has claimed responsibility for a recent bombing.  
Volcano (1997 film)
  In downtown [[Los Angeles]], an earthquake strikes. Michael 'Mike' Roark, the head of the city's [[Office of Emergency Management]] or OEM, insists on coming to work to help out with the crisis, although he has been on vacation with his daughter Kelly. His associate, Emmit Reese, notes that the quake caused no major damage, but seven utility workers are later burned to death in a storm drain at [[MacArthur Park]]. One escapes and survives, but is severely burned on one side of his face. As a precaution, Roark tries to halt the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|subway lines]] which run parallel to where the deaths took place, but Los Angeles MTA Chairman Stan Olber mulishly opposes, feeling that there is no threat to the trains. Against regulations, Roark and his coworker Gator Harris venture down the storm sewer in the park to investigate. They are nearly burned alive and barely escape with their lives when hot gases suddenly spew out of a crack in the concrete lining and flood the tunnel. Geologist Dr. Amy Barnes believes that a volcano may be forming beneath the city with magma flowing underground. Unfortunately, she has insufficient evidence to make Roark take action.<ref name="film">[[Mick Jackson (director)|Jackson, Mick]] (Director). (1997). ''Volcano'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[20th Century Fox]].</ref>  The next morning, at around 5:15 A.M., Barnes, and her assistant Rachel, venture in the storm sewer to investigate the scene of the incident. They discover the crack in the ground that released the gases earlier. While taking samples, a more powerful earthquake strikes, and Rachel is killed when she falls into the crack that is later engulfed by a rush of the hot gases. Minutes later, in the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], volcanic smoke and ash billows out, followed by high velocity [[lava bombs]] that burst out of the tar pits, which ignites several buildings. Steam explodes from the sewer system, while a subway train derails underground.   Roark helps injured firefighters out of the area. Moments later, a newly formed volcano erupts from the tar pits, and [[lava]] begins to flow freely down Wilshire Boulevard, incinerating everything in its path, including Roark's [[GMC Suburban]], and an [[Los Angeles Fire Department|LAFD]] fire truck downed by a lava bomb, killing two [[firefighters]] who are trapped inside. Roark and his daughter become separated as she is injured when a nearby lava bomb sputters and burns her leg, and she is taken to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] by Dr. Jaye Calder.  A few minutes later, while in the metro tunnel, the passengers in the derailed subway train are exposed to severe heat and toxic gases, which causes them all to eventually lose consciousness. The conductor however tries but fails to open the doors along the length of the train, until reaching the rear where he witnesses the incoming lava flow in the tunnel hundreds of meters away. Meanwhile, Olber leads his team through the Red Line tunnel to the derailed train, searching for survivors. They manage to save everyone, but Olber notices that the train driver is still missing and goes back; he finds the driver alive but unconscious, just as the lava reaches the train and begins to flow underneath it. Knowing that the train is melting, Olber sacrifices his life to save the driver by jumping into the lava flow, throwing the driver to safety, and tragically Olber is incinerated by the lava. Roark, Barnes, and police lieutenant Ed Fox devise a plan to stack [[Jersey barrier|concrete barriers]] at the intersection of [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and [[Fairfax Avenue]], creating a [[cul-de-sac]] to pool the lava as helicopters dump water on it to form a crust, making the operation a success. Barnes later theorizes that the magma is still flowing underground through the [[Red Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Red Line subway extension]], and calculates that the main eruption will occur at the end of the line at the [[Beverly Center]] near Cedars-Sinai. To prove this, Barnes and Roark lower a video camera into the tunnel to watch it, only for the camera to be incinerated by a fast-moving flow of lava. They calculate the speed and realize that they have 30 minutes until the lava hits the end of the Red Line.  Through Roark's direction, explosives are used to create channels in the street to divert the flow of lava into [[Ballona Creek]], which will later flow into the [[Pacific Ocean]], but Barnes realizes that the street is sloping in the opposite direction and instead the lava would flow directly towards the injured patients, much to the displeasure of Roark and Fox. Roark devises another plan to demolish a 22 story condominium building to block the lava's path from flowing towards the medical area and the rest of the [[Los Angeles West Side]]. Gator refuses to abandon an [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] [[SWAT]] cop, who has gotten trapped under a core column while slotting explosive charges. At that point the lava reaches the dead end of the Subway tunnel extension, and explodes out of the ground in a massive geyser. Gator and the officer sacrifices their lives to detonate the final explosive charge. Roark then spots Kelly nearby, trying to retrieve a small boy who wandered off, putting them in the direct path of the collapsing building. Roark barely manages to save both of them from being crushed as the building collapses. The plan is successful, and the lava flows directly to the ocean. Roark escapes from the wreckage with Kelly and the young child still alive. The death toll is nearly a hundred people, thousands injured, and damages in billions. It starts to rain, with surviving civilians having a sigh a relief. Reese shows up with the family dog Max, along with a call from the [[Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department]] on how to rebuild the city. Roark tells Reese that he is on vacation after all, and to tell the chief that too, as he goes home with Kelly while Reese takes over to handle the situation.  The film ends with an epilogue displaying a graphic stating that the volcano, named "'''Mount Wilshire'''", is still in an active state.<ref name="film" />  
Waiting for Guffman
 In the fictional small town of Blaine, [[Missouri]], a handful of residents prepare to put on a community theater production led by eccentric director Corky St. Clair ([[Christopher Guest]]). The show, a musical chronicling the town's history titled ''Red, White and Blaine'', is to be performed as part of the town's 150th-[[anniversary]] celebration.  Cast in the leads are Ron and Sheila Albertson ([[Fred Willard]] and [[Catherine O'Hara]]), a pair of married travel agents who are also regular [[amateur]] performers; Libby Mae Brown ([[Parker Posey]]), a perky [[Dairy Queen]] employee; Clifford Wooley ([[Lewis Arquette]]), a "long time Blaineian" and retired taxidermist who is ''Red, White and Blaine''s narrator; Johnny Savage ([[Matt Keeslar]]), a handsome and oblivious mechanic, who Corky goes out of his way to get into the play; and Dr. Alan Pearl ([[Eugene Levy]]), a tragically square dentist determined to discover his inner entertainer. High school teacher Lloyd Miller ([[Bob Balaban]]) is the show's increasingly frustrated musical director.  Corky has used connections from his "[[Off-Off-Broadway|Off-Off-Off-Off]]-Broadway" past to invite Mort Guffman, a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer, to critique ''Red, White and Blaine''. Corky leads the cast to believe that a positive review from Guffman could mean their show might go all the way to Broadway.  The program itself is designed to musically retell the history of Blaine, whose founding father was a buffoon incapable of distinguishing the geography of middle [[Missouri]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastline. We also learn why the town obtusely refers to itself as "the stool capital of the [[United States]]." The music is a series of poorly performed songs such as "Nothing Ever Happens on [[Mars]]" a reference to the town's supposed visit by a [[unidentified flying object|UFO]], and "Stool Boom". (The DVD contains "This Bulging River" and "Nothing Ever Happens in Blaine", which were edited from the cinema release.)   Central to the film are Corky's [[stereotype|stereotypically]] [[gay]] mannerisms. He supposedly has a wife called Bonnie, whom no one in Blaine has ever met or seen. He uses her to explain his habit of shopping for women's clothing and shoes.  When Johnny is forced by his suspicious father ([[Brian Doyle Murray]]) to quit the show, Corky takes over his roles, which were clearly intended for a young, masculine actor, playing a lusty young frontiersman, a heartbroken soldier, and a little boy wearing a beanie and shorts. Corky never sheds his dainty demeanor, bowl haircut, lisp, or earring in spite of his historical roles, and his face is pasted with an overkill of [[Theatrical makeup|stage rouge and eyeliner]].  Corky is also faced with creating his magic on a shoestring budget, at one point quitting the show after storming out of a meeting with the City Council, which turns down his request for $100,000 to finance the production. But the distraught cast and persuasive city fathers convince Corky to return. At the show's performance, Guffman's seat is seen to be empty, much to the dismay of the cast. Corky reassures them that Broadway producers always arrive a bit late for the show, and sure enough a man ([[Paul Benedict]]) soon takes Guffman's reserved seat. The show is well received by the audience, whereupon Corky invites the assumed Guffman backstage to talk to the actors.  The man is actually Roy Loomis, who has come to Blaine to witness the birth of his niece's baby, but he does enjoy the show. Corky then reads a telegram stating that Guffman's plane was grounded by snowstorms in [[New York City]], meaning that, like the "Godot" being spoofed, the real Guffman himself is destined never to arrive.  An epilogue shows the fates of the cast: Libby Mae has returned  to [[Dairy Queen]]. Alan and the Albertsons have pursued their dreams of being entertainers, Ron and Sheila traveling to [[Los Angeles, California]] to work as extras, and Alan now performing for elderly [[Jew]]s in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] retirement communities. Corky has returned to [[New York City]], where he has opened a Hollywood-themed novelty shop, which includes such items as [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] [[bobblehead]] [[doll]]s, ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' [[action figures]], and ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'' [[lunch box]]es.

Walking Thunder
 A young boy, Danny McKay, stays with his grandmother while his parents are away. The grandmother gives him a journal written by his grandfather when the latter was a teenage boy. It relates how he, Jacob McKay, travelled with his parents and younger brother Toby in a covered wagon on the way to California to seek a better life. Somehow they become separated from the wagon train that they originally joined up with and become stranded in the Rocky Mountains. While they are sleeping, an enormous bear appears and rummages through the wagon, scaring off their mules and livestock and scatters their possessions. The axle of the wagon is broken in the process and the father, John McKay, decides to build a shelter where they presently are as it would take too long to fix the axle and winter is about to arrive. Also, the mother Emma is heavily pregnant with their third child. Jacob and Toby are sent to look for food and come across a lodge owned by an old Sioux medicine man Dark Wind. Having read about the Indians in books, Jacob and Toby fear for their lives when the old man appears but are quickly re-assured by the fortuitous arrival of mountain man Abner Murdock, who understands the Sioux language and acts as interpreter. Both Murdock and Dark Wind share a meal with the McKays, and Dark Wind regales them with the story of the great bear known by the Sioux nation as Walking Thunder, with whom he shares a kindred spirit, and who had dominion over the land in which they live.  The family is still in need of supplies to get through the winter, so Jacob is sent with Murdock to procure the necessary items from a rendezvous of mountain men which takes place several days away. Jacob is also instructed to purchase a cow with the remaining money that the family has, to obtain milk for the coming baby. On the way, Murdock teaches Jacob the ways of surviving in the wilderness, how to track and read sign and obtain food, and other survival skills, as well as stories of famous mountain men like Jim Bridger whom he personally knows, and whose exploits Jacob has read about in books. Jacob becomes fascinated and admiring of Murdock each day, and wishes that his father were more like him. He records everything he has learned in a journal.  In the meantime, the remaining family, with the help of Dark Wind, work to build a cabin to shelter them from the elements. Suddenly, two Indian warriors appear with a view to slaying them, but then Walking Thunder who is nearby, gives a fearsome roar and the warriors run away. The family fears he will turn on them next, but Dark Wind utters a chant which seems to appease the bear, and he leaves. Thus the McKays know that the relationship between the medicine man and the bear is true.  At the rendezvous, Jacob purchases tools and other necessities, and is about to obtain a cow but Murdock convinces him to buy a rifle instead, saying that it would be more useful for survival as he can use it for hunting game and defense. During a gathering of mountain men, Murdock gets into a fight with Ansel Richter, a scoundrel hunter and his companions, Weasel and Blood Coat, a half-breed. They have seen Jacob spend his money purchasing goods, and think that he may have plenty of gold and decide to trail him and Murdock and take it for themselves. Murdock reads the signs and is aware that the three men are following him and Jacob on the way back to the cabin. But the men have gone ahead of him and reach the cabin first, where they impose on the McKay's hospitality, at the same time casing the place to see where the family has hidden the (non-existent) gold. When they start drinking and becoming unruly, John McKay abruptly asks them to leave. Murdock and Jacob arrive and learn of what happened, also Jacob admits that he bought the rifle instead of the cow.  The next day, John goes out to hunt for game, but then gets almost shot at by unseen hunters (presumably Richter and his cohorts). Murdock rides up and saves him. He tells the McKays that he is planning to go to Fort Bridger for the winter, but promises to stay and help them finish building the cabin. When it has been completed, Dark Wind performs a simple ceremony of blessing the family and gives them tokens of grace. His job finished, Murdock prepares to leave for the fort. Walking Thunder appears and Richter attempts to shoot him for the price that his skin will fetch, but Dark Wind. who is wandering nearby, utters a warning call, and the bear disappears. In frustration, Richter turns his gun on Dark Wind and shoots him in the shoulder. Dark Wind manages to make his way to the cabin, where Emma tends to his wound. Fearing that whoever shot Dark Wind would come after them, the McKays prepare their firearms and Toby rigs up a crude but effective alarm system with tin cans strung up on a rope. Richter and his companions creep up in the dark but trip over the cans, triggering a warning to the family. Nevertheless, the three hunters manage to enter the cabin and proceed to threaten to kill the McKays unless they reveal where they have hidden their gold. Murdock arrives in the nick of time and tells the three that there is no gold to be found, and manages to drive them away. When asked why he came back when he was supposed to be going to the fort, he merely explains that he had a hunch that he was needed.  Murdock takes John McKay on a hunting trip to obtain meat for the winter. Jacob is left in charge of the cabin. Emma suddenly goes into labor, but the two boys are helpless and unsure of what to do. Dark Wind, who has recovered from his injury, assists in the birth and helps deliver a baby girl. Murdock and John return from hunting and learn of the new arrival. Thwarted by their unsuccessful raid on the cabin, Richter, Weasel and Blood Coat turn to hunting down Walking Thunder to obtain his pelt. Weasel manages to wound him but the bear limps away. Murdock and Jacob hear the shot and ride up to avert further killing. The three hunters see Murdock and Weasel and Blood Coat try to take him down. Richter attempts to shoot Dark Wind, who is praying in the woods, for good but Jacob materializes behind him and tells him to put down his gun. Richter looks at him scornfully, takes Jacob's rifle away and pulls out a knife. As he does, Walking Thunder looms up behind him, roars and takes a couple of swipes at Richter, wounding and scaring him off (off-screen). John arrives and helps Murdock fight off Weasel and Blood Coat, who run away at the sudden turn of events. This causes Jacob to see his father in a new light, and realizes that John is every bit a man that Murdock is, albeit in a different way. The film ends with Danny McKay finishing reading the journal of his grandfather Jacob, and the grandmother giving him a brand-new journal to write his life events in.  In voice-over, the film narrator tells that the fate of Walking Thunder has become a mystery and legend. White men's version said that he died the day he was shot, but according to the Indians, he was healed by Dark Wind and together they roamed the mountains till the day they we recalled by the spirits to their eternal after-life.

Warriors of Virtue
 Ryan Jeffers suffers a disability to his leg preventing him from trying out for sports and fitting in with other kids at school. He is currently the [[waterboy]] of his school's football team and has a crush on quarterback Brad's girlfriend. He often seeks escape through [[comic book]]s and dreams of adventure, hiding the depression of his disability from his mother Kathryn.  One day, the owner of his favorite restaurant, his friend Ming, gives him a [[manuscript]] of [[Tao]] representing the five elements: [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]], [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]], [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]], [[Wood (Wu Xing)|Wood]] and [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]]. He advises Ryan to live his life no matter his physical limits. That night, Ryan and his best friend Chucky are approached by Brad and his friends who suggest an [[initiation]] for their group. Leading them to a [[water plant]], Ryan is told he needs to cross a narrow pipe in order to sign his name on a wall of [[graffiti]]. Chucky recommends to Ryan, "why don't we make like Tom, and [[Tom Cruise|Cruise]]?" Ignoring Chucky's protests, Ryan attempts to cross the pipe. During this time, a water pipe opens up and throws Ryan into the water.  Ryan wakes in a strange forest and is attacked by assailants who are drawn off by a creature from the lake. He screams and runs in fear, but soon realizes his leg works. He meets a dwarf-like man named Mudlap where a beautiful girl named Elysia drives him off. She tells Ryan that he is in Tao. Ryan tells her about the manuscript, which had been stolen with his backpack. Believing it to be the Manuscript of Legend, Elysia takes Ryan to Master Chung and he meets four of the five warriors, [[anthropomorphic]] [[kangaroos]] each representing an element: Lai, Warrior of Wood; Chi, Warrior of Fire; Tsun, Warrior of Earth; and Yee, Warrior of Metal. He is told that Yun, the Warrior of Water had left them following an earlier conflict. Ryan thinks that the creature that saved him is Yun and that he has the manuscript. He is told that the manuscript would be sought by Komodo, a [[warlord]] who betrayed the Warriors and is stealing from the Lifesprings of Tao in order to stay young forever where the Warriors are protecting the last Lifespring. While talking to Elysia, Ryan is captured by Mantose, Barbarocious, and Dullard, but is saved by Yun who admits he doesn't have the book leading Ryan to believe Komodo has it. He convinces Yun to return to the Lifespring.  Ryan flees, wanting to return home, but Mudlap leads him into General Grillo's arms and he is saved by Chung. Yun, Yee and Chi go after the manuscript and fall into a trap after being betrayed by Elysia, who joined Komodo as vengeance against Yun for killing her brother by accident. They are nearly killed in a trap, but narrowly escape using their skills and they return to the Lifespring to prevent Komodo from ambushing the others. Komodo attempts to kidnap Ryan, but instead fights Chung. The battle is brutal, but Chung is defeated and killed by Komodo who then makes off with Ryan.  When Ryan awakens at Komodo's palace, Elysia explains of Yun killing her brother and tries to convince him to read from the book so that Komodo could possibly invade his world for more Lifesprings. Ryan realizes he can't read the book and this upsets Komodo, who tries to strike Ryan down. Elysia interferes and is struck down by Barbarocious. Komodo kills Barbarocious in rage as Ryan escapes. Komodo, now growing unhinged, returns to the Lifespring and challenges the Warriors to one-on-one combat, splitting into five versions of himself. He taunts and defeats the warriors while Ryan, after getting an apology from Mudlap for his betrayal, finds an inscription in the manuscript. Facing Komodo and taunting him, Ryan tricks Komodo into using his power on him, weakening him so that the warriors can use their powers to purify his spirit, reforming him to a kind man while purifying his surviving army. Ryan, now mortally wounded, is surrounded by his friends and Yee astonishes everyone by thanking Ryan as he speaks for the first time in many years.  Suddenly, Ryan is back at the water plant before crossing the pipe. Realizing his desperation to fit in led to his accident, he changes it this time and refusing to go through with it. The water pipe opens like it did before, trapping Brad on the other side. His insults to his friends only prompt them to leave him behind for the police to find.  That night at home, Ryan apologizes to his mother for an earlier argument. When he goes to bed, he offers to tell his dog, Bravo, about Tao.  
Washington Square (film)
 A prologue introduces us to Dr. Austin Sloper ([[Albert Finney]]), a [[New York City]] doctor and resident of a large house on [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] whose wife dies in childbirth, leaving a daughter, Catherine ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), to be raised by her father. As a child, Catherine is overweight, clumsy, and untalented; however, she is also a sweet, affectionate child. She adores her father and tries hard to please him, but he considers her a disappointment and treats her with ironic condescension.  His thoughts are still much occupied with his beloved wife and with a promising son who died before Catherine was born, and he privately &ndash; but bitterly &ndash; resents his only surviving child for causing his wife's death.  Sloper invites Catherine's widowed aunt, the incurably foolish Lavinia Penniman ([[Maggie Smith]]), to live at Washington Square as a chaperone for Catherine. Catherine becomes a plain young woman who is painfully shy and inept in the social graces expected of someone of her class, despite her aunt's best efforts to instill them. Apart from her sweet nature, Catherine possesses only one obvious attraction: money. She earns $10,000 annually from her mother's estate, and will inherit considerably more when her father dies.  At a party celebrating her cousin Marian Almond's ([[Jennifer Garner]]) engagement, Catherine is introduced to a handsome, charming young man named Morris Townsend ([[Ben Chaplin]]). He is attentive, respectful, and &ndash; to Catherine's obvious astonishment &ndash; clearly interested in her. He begins paying regular calls at Washington Square.  Before long, the susceptible Catherine falls headlong in love with him. Sloper, however, suspects Townsend of being a fortune hunter, with no intention of pursuing a career. Aunt Lavinia loves melodrama and gets a vicarious thrill from Townsend's attentions; and so, contrary to Sloper's wishes, she does all she can to encourage the relationship, even meeting Townsend secretly to collude with him.  The central conflict emerges when Townsend proposes marriage and Sloper refuses to give his consent, telling Catherine he will disinherit her if she marries without it. Catherine doesn't care about the money, but disobeying her father is another matter. She dutifully accompanies him on a [[Grand Tour]] of [[Europe]], during which he exhorts her to give Townsend up; she refuses, and a frustrated Sloper speaks to her with such contempt that she finally admits to herself that he despises her. The realization pains her deeply, but also strengthens her resolve to separate herself from him and bestow all her love and loyalty on Townsend.  Catherine comes home, determined to marry. When she and Morris are reunited, she convinces him that her father will never relent.  Shortly afterward, he backs out of the relationship. When Catherine tearfully confronts him, he admits his mercenary motives outright and leaves her.  Years pass. Catherine has refused at least one respectable offer of marriage. When her father's health fails, she nurses him through his last illness. During his final days, he asks her to promise never to marry Morris Townsend. With quiet dignity, she replies that while she seldom thinks of Townsend, she can't make such a promise. Sloper misunderstands her and alters his [[Will (law)|will]], adding a [[Codicil (will)|codicil]] deploring his daughter's ongoing interest in unscrupulous young men and leaving most of his $300,000 fortune to charity. Catherine is left with only the house and the income from her mother. She isn't offended by the codicil; in fact, at the reading of the will, she laughs.  Some time later, Townsend reappears at her doorstep. Catherine, who is now running a daycare center in her house, talks to him briefly. She isn't angry, but she has no interest in renewing their relationship, and tells him so, quietly and firmly. He departs, leaving Catherine to reflect on the passion she once experienced.  
We Lived for Estonia
 During June 1941, Nazi forces occupied Estonia. By 1944, when the Soviet-Nazi frontline was drawing towards the Estonian border from the East, [[Alfred Käärmann]] was conscripted into the German military. By September 1944 the [[Red Army]] had again occupied Estonia. Alfred was forced to make a decision: whether to stay in Estonia or retreat with the Germans. He chose the former, However he risked arrest and deportation by the Soviets. In order to survive, he, like many other Estonian men, took refuge in the forests. They were known as the [[Forest brothers]]. Alfred Käärmann discusses his experience with the Forest brothers.  
The Wax Mask

Welcome to Woop Woop
 Teddy ([[Johnathon Schaech]]) is a New York bird smuggler who goes to Australia to replace a flock of escaped birds after a deal goes awry. While there, he has a wild liaison with a quirky, sexually ravenous girl, Angie ([[Susie Porter]]), who after a brief courtship knocks him unconscious and kidnaps him. When he awakes he finds himself "married" to her - not legally - and stranded in Woop Woop, a desolate, dilapidated town hidden within a crater-like rock formation in [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] territory. The residents are people who lived there at an asbestos mining camp before the land was handed over to the Aborigines; following a tragedy in 1979, Woop Woop was abandoned and literally "erased" from the Australian map. Not content with the deal given to them by the mining company (from [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]]), they opted to return to their old lives in Woop Woop. At first they repopulated themselves incestuously, which caused wide mental instability. A rule was then enacted ("Rule #3") which bans residents from sleeping with their relatives. Since then, outsiders like Teddy have been occasionally kidnapped to keep Woop Woop populated.  Their only export is dog food made from road-killed [[kangaroo]]s. The town is run by Angie's father, Daddy-O ([[Rod Taylor]]), in an authoritarian manner that he disguises as communal (he and the other town elders keep the best luxuries for themselves in secret while doling out only the usual canned pineapple and sub-par tobacco to the others). The only entertainment available to the residents are old [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]] films and soundtracks, the latter of which they play constantly. These are presumably left over from the town's last official contact with the civilised world.  After witnessing another kidnapping, 'Midget' the local hairdresser, gets shot to death by Daddy-O during an attempted escape, Teddy soon realizes he will be trapped in Woop Woop for life unless he finds a way out for himself. Initially, he repairs his VW van which had been vandalized by the locals, only to have it vandalised again by Daddy-O. The [[Australian Cattle Dog]] that he adopts is shot as part of 'Dog Day.' He befriends a couple of locals, including the scruffy, affable Duffy, and Krystal, Angie's sister, who help him to confront Daddy-O's iron-fisted reign, and to arrange an escape plan. Duffy, reprimanded by Daddy-O for breaking 'Rule #3,' nonetheless elects to stay in Woop Woop, while Teddy, Krystal, and Krystal's pet cockatoo escape.  
Welcome to Sarajevo
 In 1992, ITN reporter Michael Henderson ([[Stephen Dillane]]) travels to [[Sarajevo]], the besieged capital of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He meets American star journalist Jimmy Flynn ([[Woody Harrelson]]) on the chase for the most exciting stories and pictures. Henderson and Flynn have friendly arguments and differences in the intervals between reporting. They stay at the Holiday Inn, which was the primary hotel for the press in Sarajevo during the siege. After a previous translator proves corrupt and inept, ITN hires Risto ([[Goran Višnjić]]) to be Henderson's translator. Their work permits them blunt and unobstructed views of the suffering of the people of Sarajevo. The situation changes when Henderson makes a report from an orphanage located on the front lines (Ljubica Ivezic Orphanage) in which two hundred children live in desperate conditions. After increasingly brutal attacks fail to make the lead story in the UK, Henderson makes the orphanage his lead story to try to bring full attention to the war.  When American aid worker Nina ([[Marisa Tomei]]) organises a UN-sanctioned bus-borne evacuation of several orphaned Sarajevan children to Italy, Henderson convinces Nina to include a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] girl from the orphanage, Emira (Emira Nušević), to whom Henderson had made a promise to evacuate. Nina knows this is an illegal act – Emira's mother is still alive and signed no papers authorising the evacuation – but the orphanage director allows it because of the desperate circumstances. Henderson and his cameraman accompany the evacuation under the pretense of covering it as a news story.  Despite a UN escort, Bosnian Serbs hinder the evacuation at several points along its route. The final harassment is the worst – a group of [[Chetniks]] halt the bus, forcibly disembark the Bosniak Muslim children and put them on their armed lorry, presumably to repatriate them.  When Henderson finally makes it to London with Emira, Emira quickly becomes a member of Henderson's family in a comfortable London home. After an ambiguous interval of perhaps 100 days, Henderson receives word from his former producer, who is still in Sarajevo, that Emira's mother wants Emira back. Henderson returns to Sarajevo, now riven not only by the siege but also by internal organised crime, and seeks out Risto, who has become a Bosnian-Herzegovinian soldier. Henderson recruits Risto to find Emira's mother. They nearly succeed, but the unstable situation unravels around them and they are forced to retreat. When Risto is killed by a sniper in his own home, Henderson falls back on Zeljko (Drazen Sivak), a concierge at the Holiday Inn who Henderson had helped in previous Sarajevo tours. Zeljko negotiates the streets and road-blocks that lead to Emira's mother. As prelude to signing the adoption papers, she outlines the reasons she wants Emira back. She cannot in good conscience bring Emira back to Sarajevo, though, and she signs the papers.  A running joke in the movie is the designation by a UN official that Sarajevo was only the 14th worst crisis in the world. In the middle of the movie, Harun, a cellist friend of Risto, says that he would play a concert on the streets of Sarajevo once it is designated the worst place on Earth. Though he acknowledges the danger, he claims that "the people will die happily listening to my music." The movie ends with Harun holding a "concert of peace" on a hill overlooking Sarajevo, playing his cello to hundreds of Sarajevans. Among the attendees are Henderson, Flynn and several children from the orphanage. Henderson gives Harun a sad smile; the concert is beautiful, but it also means that Sarajevo had, indeed, become the worst place on Earth.  The closing credits say that Emira still lives in England.

Scott continues to try to be a part of his daughter's life, but when Molly first breaks her arm at the playground then Scott's mother finds mysterious bruises on her granddaughter, Scott again fights for custody of young Molly, and this time he wins because the court feels his family can provide a more stable environment for Molly than a public daycare can.  
Wilde (film)
 The film opens with Oscar Wilde's 1882 visit to [[Leadville, Colorado]] during his lecture tour of the United States. Despite his flamboyant personality and urbane wit, he proves to be a success with the local [[Silver mining|silver miners]] as he regales them with tales of [[Renaissance]] silversmith [[Benvenuto Cellini]].  Wilde returns to London and weds [[Constance Lloyd]] ([[Jennifer Ehle]]), and they have two sons in quick succession. While their second child is still an infant, the couple hosts a young Canadian named [[Robbie Ross]] ([[Michael Sheen]]), who seduces Wilde and helps him come to terms with his homosexuality. On the opening night of his play ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', Wilde is re-introduced to the dashingly handsome and openly foppish poet [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] ([[Jude Law]]), whom he had met briefly the year before, and the two fall into a passionate and tempestuous relationship. [[Hedonism|Hedonistic]] Douglas is not content to remain [[monogamy|monogamous]] and frequently engages in sexual activity with [[Male prostitution|rent boys]] while his older lover plays the role of [[voyeurism|voyeur]].  Douglas' father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]] ([[Tom Wilkinson]]), objects to his son's relationship with Wilde and demeans the playwright shortly after the opening of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. When Wilde sues the Marquess for criminal libel against him, his homosexuality is publicly exposed; he is eventually tried for [[Gross indecency between men|gross indecency]] and sentenced to two years' [[Penal labour|hard labour]]. In prison, he is visited by his wife, who tells him she is not divorcing him but is taking their sons to [[Germany]] and that he is welcome to visit as long as he never sees Douglas again. Wilde is released from prison and goes straight into exile to continental Europe. In spite of the advice or objections of others, he eventually meets with Douglas.  Throughout the film, portions of the well-loved Wilde story ''[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales#"The Selfish Giant"|The Selfish Giant]]'' are woven in, first by Wilde telling the story to his children, then as narrator, finishing the story as the film ends.

Lord Mark, a sophisticated aristocrat with a large estate, begins to court Kate with Maude's approval. However Kate is secretly in love with a young [[Muckraker|muckraking]] [[Journalism|journalist]] named Merton Densher, whom her aunt has forbidden her from pursuing a relationship with because of his humble circumstances. Nonetheless she has continued to meet with Merton in secret, though he is growing increasingly impatient for her to leave her aunt and marry him.   Aunt Maude confronts Kate about her continuing association with Densher and threatens to withdraw her financial support from Kate and her father. Kate reluctantly breaks with Merton and refuses to meet with him anymore. A few months later, at a dinner party given by her aunt, Kate is introduced to the wealthy American orphan and heiress Milly Theale, who is on an extended trip through Europe with her travelling companion Susan Stringham. The cynical Kate is captivated by Milly's beauty, vivaciousness and humor, and the two form a strong friendship. Kate and Merton reconcile and resume their secret meetings; one day they run into Milly and Kate introduces Merton as a friend. Soon after Milly invites Kate to accompany her and Susan to [[Venice]].   Before leaving Lord Mark secretly reveals to Kate that Milly is terminally ill and that although he desires Kate he has to marry Milly to avoid losing his estates. Aware that Milly is indifferent to Lord Mark but is smitten with Merton, Kate invites Merton to Venice and persuades him to show Milly affection in an effort to seduce her. Kate expects that the orphaned and lonely Milly will leave him her fortune after her death.  During Kate's, Milly's, and Merton's excursions through Venice, Kate gradually becomes jealous of Milly's attraction to Merton, so much so that she lures him away one night to have sex. Milly confronts her the next morning, though Kate denies that Merton is her lover. She realizes that she must leave, without warning Merton, if her scheme is to succeed. On their own in Venice, Merton's affection for Milly grows ever stronger and the two form a strong bond, even as her condition worsens. One day Merton spots Lord Mark at a cafe; alarmed, he goes to visit Milly but is denied entry. Susan visits him and Merton realizes that Kate has revealed their secret to Lord Mark to sabotage the whole scheme, knowing that Mark would tell Milly as revenge for her jilting him. Nonetheless Milly agrees to see Merton and the two share an intimate moment where she forgives him and says that she still loves both him and Kate, despite their actions. A few days later, Milly dies and Merton and Susan attend her funeral.  After Merton returns to London, Kate comes to Merton's flat. She asks why he has not come to see her in the weeks he has been back and finds a letter from Milly's attorneys, informing Merton that Milly did indeed bequeath a sizable portion of her estate to him. Merton tells Kate that he will not take the money, and she must marry him without it if they are to be together. She agrees, and they make love. But afterwards, Kate asks him to tell her that he is not still in love with Milly, or his memory of her, and he cannot. Kate leaves him for good, knowing that her conniving has backfired. Merton returns to Venice, alone.

Winter Sleepers
  The film is set in the deeply snowy [[Alps|alpine]] winter resort of [[Berchtesgaden]] in [[Bavaria]]; the story begins shortly after [[Christmas Day]], with five people returning, not all of whom are connected.  Laura, a surgical nurse, and Rebecca, a translator, live together in the house that Rebecca inherited from her great aunt. René is a projectionist in a cinema. Marco, Rebecca's boyfriend, is a skiing instructor who drives an expensive [[Alfa Romeo]]. Theo is a middle-aged farmer who lives with his wife Edith, their daughter, and two sons on a poor farm nearby.  When Marco arrives, he is greeted passionately by Rebecca, and tugged into the house. He leaves his car open outside, with the key still in the ignition. It is the early morning, and René, walking drunkenly home, passes the house, taking pictures, among other things, of Rebecca and Marco having sex inside. Finally, he climbs into the car and drives away. Theo, meanwhile, is taking his horse to the veterinarian, but doesn't let his daughter come with him. He doesn't notice when she sneaks into the [[horse box]] with the animal. Theo, distracted by his sons calling him on a walkie-talkie and driving on the wrong side of the road, almost collides with René. The Alfa Romeo crashes off the road and into a snowdrift and Rene is not hurt; however, the horse box is flipped over and the girl and horse badly injured. Theo is dazed, but René, rather than helping, takes a photo of him, and as he walks off, Theo is stricken by a strange snake-like scar on the back of René's head.  When Theo is helped out of his truck by a passing driver, he shoots the injured horse on the spot and takes his daughter to the hospital where Laura works.  There, Laura hears Theo becoming obsessed with finding the man who caused the accident, to prove his own innocence: no-one believes that there was another car, because it is buried under snow. All he remembers was the shape of René's face close to him, when he took the photo. The young girl is operated-on and is in a [[coma]], between life and death.  Meanwhile, Marco reports the car theft to the police and becomes exasperated by their lack of progress, claiming they aren't taking the theft seriously. Rebecca is becoming discontent with her relationship with him; she sees him as taking her for granted, jealous without cause, and lacking ambition. Outside of their passionate sex life, they argue constantly. Laura befriends René after a play in which she was performing; he gives her a free pass for the cinema where he works, and eventually he shows her his photos, which he keeps in an album with numbers and dates. The reason he takes them is his [[short-term memory]] problems which were caused by a head injury while serving in the Army; without photos he would have no way of remembering places or people.  Theo and Edith have to shut the farm down because of debt and move to a smaller place near the resort. Theo draws a picture of the shape he remembers, copies it and sticks them up around town, appealing for anyone to come forward if they recognize the scar on the back of the head (like that of René). But Edith takes down all his posters, believing he is only trying to escape his own guilt and explaining that she's ashamed.  Marco has started an affair with Nina, a young student from the skiing class he teaches. He invites her to his boss's house one evening while his boss is out of town, pretending it is his. Later, he has to go to the hospital after burning himself on the coffee machine and is treated by Laura. While he is there, Theo's daughter dies.  Theo, investigating the site of the car crash again, finds the buried car and comes across documents showing Marco to be the owner. Theo goes to Marco's workplace (the ski area) and is told Marco is skiing in the mountains, with Nina. They become separated in fog, and Nina injures herself by falling off a ledge and onto a tree. After falling out of the tree, Nina staggers to Theo's new residence and is tended to by Edith.  Desperately trying to find Nina, Marco meets Theo on the mountainside where Theo sets his dog onto Marco.  When Marco demands to know what's happening, Theo explains only "You killed her."  Not knowing about Theo's daughter, Marco starts to panic about losing Nina.  After injuring Theo's aggressive German shepherd, Marco manages to ski hurriedly away before going over the edge of a cliff, and he falls, seemingly forever, into a crevasse in the valley, to his death.  In another coincidence, Rebecca and the injured Nina depart on the same train, but don't know each other. The film ends with the birth of René and Laura's child.

Wishmaster (film)
 A narrator ([[Angus Scrimm]]) explains that when "God breathed life into the universe…the light gave birth to Angels…the earth gave birth to man...the fire gave birth to the djinn, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds." If a person wakes a djinn, that person will receive three wishes but the third wish will free legions of djinn on Earth. In 1127, the djinn ([[Andrew Divoff]]) asks a Persian emperor to make his second wish. When the emperor wishes to see wonders, the djinn uses his powers to torture and mutilate people in the palace. The emperor is horrified, but the djinn tells him to use his third wish to set things right. Before the emperor can make his third wish, [[Zoroaster]] (Ari Barak), a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]], explains the consequences of the third wish and reveals a [[fire opal]], which pulls the djinn inside and traps him.  In present-day America, Raymond Beaumont ([[Robert Englund]]) supervises workers lowering a box containing an antique statue of [[Ahura Mazda]] onto a ship. The crane operator Mickey Torelli ([[Joseph Pilato]]) who is operating the crane is [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]] and drops the box, killing Beaumont's assistant Ed Finley ([[Ted Raimi]]) and destroying the statue. A [[stevedore|dockworker]] steals the [[opal#Other varieties of opal|fire opal]] from the rubble and [[pawnbroker|pawns]] it. Eventually the jewel reaches Regal Auctioneers, where Nick Merritt ([[Chris Lemmon]]) instructs appraiser Alexandra "Alex" Amberson ([[Tammy Lauren]]) to examine it, which wakes the djinn. Alex sees something inside the jewel and leaves it with her close friend and colleague, Josh Aickman (Tony Crane), to analyze. As he is collecting data, the gem explodes, destroying the lab and releasing the djinn. Josh is killed, upon his wish for relief from his physical pain.  Alex, having been informed of Josh’s death by Lieutenant Nathanson ([[Ricco Ross]]), tracks the gem to the statue which she tracks to Beaumont, who sends Alex to visit Wendy Derleth ([[Jenny O'Hara]]), a folklore professor, who explains the history of the gem and the djinn; the djinn grants wishes in exchange for souls, but the wishes are granted in a way that makes them have undesirable results upon the wisher. Later, Alex learns that the djinn needs to power the gem with human souls and then grant her three wishes before he can open the gateway to release the djinn on Earth. Meanwhile, the djinn takes the form of a dead man and uses the name Nathaniel Demerest. He kills a pharmacist ([[Reggie Bannister]]) with the wish of a vengeful vagrant ([[George 'Buck' Flower]]) and grants clerk Ariella’s ([[Gretchen Palmer]]) wish for eternal beauty by turning her into a mannequin. Searching for Alex, he goes to Nathanson to gain her file; Nathanson refuses to do this, though the djinn grants Nathanson’s wish to easily prove a criminal’s guilt by having the criminal go on a shooting spree inside the police precinct.  He next visits Nick, killing a security guard ([[Kane Hodder]]) along the way, acquiring Nick’s cooperation by offering him a million dollars. Nick is given the money when his mother is killed in a plane crash. Alex sees troubling visions of every time the djinn grants wishes. She consults Derleth, but realizes that she is talking to the djinn, who has killed Derleth and taken her form. The djinn confronts Alex and offers her three wishes, as well an extra "test" wish; she orders the djinn to kill itself. He shoots himself in the head with a gun but his wound heals instantly, revealing the djinn as an [[Immortality|immortal]]. Using the first of the official three wishes, Alex wishes to know her opponent, the djinn. He [[Teleportation|teleports]] her to his world within the gem which terrifies her. Granting her wish to know what he is, the djinn explains, "To you, I am this: The cry of the abandoned child. The whimper of the whipped beast. I am the face that stares back at you from the shadows of your mirror. The hollowness at the heart of all your hopes, Alexandra. I AM DESPAIR." She wishes herself back to her apartment, alone.  The Djinn had been threatening Alex's sister, Shannon ([[Wendy Benson]]), so Alex hurries to a party Beaumont invited them to earlier. The djinn follows, again disguised as Nathaniel Demerest. Alex tells doorman Johnny Valentine ([[Tony Todd]]) to hold the djinn is trying to kill her, and Valentine holds the djinn back. The djinn, however, manipulates Valentine into making a wish, allowing the djinn to drown Valentine in a [[Chinese water torture cell]], making his way into the party. The djinn charms Beaumont, who wishes his party would be unforgettable, and thus the djinn causes artwork to kill Beaumont, the guests, and the security guards called in to help. Eventually the djinn corners the sisters and attempts to scare Alex into making her third wish by trapping Shannon in a burning painting. Alex wishes that Torelli had not been drunk at work, undoing the events that followed and trapping the djinn in the fire opal again.  The now sober Torelli lowers the crate with no problems.

He is greatly vigilant about the well-being of his family – an intrinsic reason of his fury and stubbornness. One day a man named Vilas tries to molest Guddi and forcefully catches hold of her hand. Deva, in a fit of extreme rage, rips off the hand of the man. Deva is arrested, and is sent to jail for 4 years.  After his liberation from jail, Deva with his henchmen form a tribunal of justice called "Deva Ki Adaalat", where he punishes the evil-doers, mostly the tyrants over the poor. Soon, Deva's name is filed as one of the top four criminals of the city, the other three being Jindaal ([[Raj Babbar]]), Laal Singh ([[Shahbaz Khan (actor)|Shahbaz Khan]]) and Khan ([[Sharat Saxena]]). These three men are in an effort to do away with Deva, who acts as an impediment to their illegal activities. Asst. Commissioner of Police Inder Saxena ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]) has a genial relationship with Deva and his family, but is secretly planning to apprehend and punish him under legal task, in case adequate evidences are gathered by police against Deva. Concurrently, a club dancer Jaya ([[Raveena Tandon]]) falls for Deva.  In due course of time, Inder marries Guddi. One day, Akash stops at a building under construction erected by "Laal Builders" to deliver some goods. Incidentally, at the top floor of the building he eavesdrops the three crime bosses - Jindaal, Laal Singh and Khan devising an evil plot to kill the CM ([[Virendra Saxena]]) and frame Deva for the murder. In great panic, Akash flees from the spot but in the haste drops the cap of his pen on which the name "AKASH" is engraved. He reports this dreadful plot to Inder by phone after a failed attempt to call Deva. Inder arrives shortly and both of them walk up to the top of the building where the three men are abetting. Inder retains the pen-cap (which Akash dropped behind) and after an onslaught on Akash by Jindaal, Laal Singh and Khan, Inder slays Akash by throwing him off the building to avenge the death of his brother, whose hand Deva tore off.  One day, the CM comes to meet Deva after the latter convenes the CM for a private meeting. Jindaal bursts onto the scene, before Deva arrives and fires at the CM in a lethal attempt to assassinate him. However, Deva turns up in time and carries the acutely wounded CM to a safe location. A search operation is launched for Deva by the police. Deva kills Laal Singh in a heavy blood-shedding rout.  As the story advances, Inder's wife Guddi comes across Akash's pen-cap inside a drawer at their home, which leads her to learn with shock and horror that Inder killed Akash. She rings up Deva, but before she utters the truth, Inder arrives with Jindaal, and Khan and detaches the telephone cord. The three men assault Guddi before Inder stabs her to death.  Eventually, Deva tracks down Khan as one of the killers of his brother and kills him by stabbing Khan to death. Later, Deva finds Akash's pen-cap among Guddi's mortal remains. So the truth reveales to Deva that Inder has joined hands with Jindal.  A squad of policemen led by Inder besieges Deva's refuge. Jindaal arrives at the spot to kill the CM who is under vital medical treatment in Deva's shelter. Deva and his men with the help of the local residents annihilate the armed force. He kills Jindaal when the latter tries to fire at the CM, and beats up Inder. Finally, Deva's father Ashok Pradhan arrives and shoots Inder to death.  "Jaanwar ko maarne ke liye jaanwar banna padta hai" (To kill a beast, one has to become a beast) — the honest advocate upholds.  In the final scene, the CM asserts Deva's innocence.
