Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe
  Abraxas ([[Jesse Ventura]]) and Secundus ([[Sven-Ole Thorsen]]), are intergalactic police officers, or Finders, from a planet called Sargacia. Their race is physically similar to humans but with an expanded lifespan; Abraxas has been a Finder for almost 10,000 years. Each Finder is equipped with an Answer Box, which serves as a communicator and scanner. It can also detect any object from a distance based on the object's vibration. When testing for the [[Anti-Life Equation]], the subject being scanned will disintegrate if they do not contain the equation.  Secundus wants to access a negative universe which he believes will give him omnipotent powers and make him immortal. To do this he needs the solution to the Anti-Life Equation. He travels to Earth and impregnates the first human female he finds, Sonia Murray ([[Marjorie Bransfield]]), simply by holding his hand over her belly. The resulting baby will be the Culmator, a dangerously powerful prodigy able to solve the equation. Only a few minutes later, Sonia gives birth to a boy and names him Tommy. Meanwhile, Abraxas corners Secundus so other Finders can lock onto their location and transport Secundus to the prison planet Tyrannus 7. Abraxas is ordered to kill Sonia before she can give birth, but he can not bring himself to do it and leaves her with Tommy. When Sonia goes home her parents kick her out of their house since she does not know who is the baby's father. They do not seem to mind that the baby was conceived and born on the same day, though.  Five years later, Tommy does not speak but does have strange abilities; when he is picked on at school, he makes the bully wet his pants. The school principal, played by [[James Belushi]], calls Sonia in about this problem, but she refuses to admit that Tommy has problems. Secundus escapes from the prison and teleports to Earth. The Finders send Abraxas right after Secundus with the same technology, but their transport paths cross and their weapons are destroyed. Abraxas chases Secundus, but loses him; Secundus uses the fuse box at an automotive shop to recharge his Answer Box. When the owner confronts him, he uses his Answer Box to test the shop-owner about the Anti-Life Equation. The test causes the owner to explode. Secundus then goes on a rampage, stealing cars, killing innocent people and causing chaos. He continues to scan people, looking for the chosen one who knows the Anti-Life Equation.  He is pursued by Abraxas, who is unable to do much as Secundus escapes and finds Sonia's residence. There, he sees the child with one of Sonia's friends, who is currently watching the house while Sonia and Tommy are out at a movie, and tries to test the equation on him.  But Abraxas arrives before any harm can be done to the boy and they fight once more. However, Abraxas is stabbed in the stomach and Secundus left after saying he will let Abraxas live to see everything destroyed. Sonia returns home with Tommy, and finds Abraxas there in the living room. She expresses her anger about being impregnated by Secundus to him, but is convinced by Abraxas to drive somewhere safe with him and Tommy.

''Arsionov'' ([[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksei Serebryakov]]) combines his combat experience and bravery with brutal [[Dedovschina|hazing]] of young conscripts back on the field base. Major ''Bandura''`s [[tour of duty]] has expired. He is free to go home and reunite with his wife whom he has almost forgot. This means leaving his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] ''Katya'' ([[Tatyana Dogileva]]), a nurse in the base's hospital—to a much anticipation from Bandura's superior ''Leonid'' () who fell in love with Katya. Anxiety is felt by many characters about the change taking place back in the Soviet Union during the [[Perestroika]]. Bandura himself thinks he might not be able to adapt. Katya says that Afghanistan will be remembered as the best part of their lives.  The Soviet command arranges a deal with a local Afghan [[warlord]] that he won't take action against the withdrawing Soviet troops in exchange for weapons and supplies. When asked why he needs more weapons as the war seems to be coming to an end, he replies that his war will go on for a very long time. On its way back to base the convoy that has delivered the supplies is ambushed by another faction of the [[mujahedin]]. The paratroopers take cover and fight back with only a few casualties, but the road is blocked by a damaged fuel tanker. While Bandura personally drives a tank to push the tanker off the road, inexperienced Steklov dashes forward attempting to lead troops to counterattack and is badly wounded. Later, his leg is amputated at the hospital, which adds to the stack of Bandura's career problems. Bandura decides to stay with his men for a while and lead a retaliatory mission to finish a mujahedin leader, who is presumed wounded and taken to the neutral warlord's village. When the preparations are finished, Bandura comes to say good bye to Katya, who is scheduled to leave the country on the morrow. A junky soldier at the hospital insults him by insubordination but Bandura suddenly shows no will for disciplining him. Instead, he requests to be replaced by some other officer on the mission, citing a sore foot as a pretext. But, after realization that his company is setting out, he resumes command. It goes awry again when the neutral warlord is accidentally killed in the raid and his men become hostile and together with the mujahedin attack the paratroopers. Bandura is able to pull his unit out mostly intact, but they are pinned down and call in an [[air strike]] that obliterates the village. After the strike, Bandura becomes apathetic, and without apparent reason, re-enters the village alone. He finds nobody alive except for a 10-year boy clinging to an [[AK-47]]. Bandura hesitates, unsure what to do, then walks away, allowing the boy to shoot him in the back and kill him.

However, his piloting skills, bravery and disregard for the law are noticed by a mysterious government agent, who tells Billy that he can get his license back if he accepts a job in [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]], working for a "strictly civilian" company called Air America. It is readily apparent that Air America is a front for CIA operations in Laos.  Unemployed and unable to find work, Billy takes the job. In Laos, he is introduced to Air America's unorthodox pilots and aircraft, being taken under the wing of Gene Ryack (Mel Gibson), a cynical and eccentric pilot and an arms dealer who uses official flights to buy [[black market]] weapons for his private cache. His dream, which he refers to as his "retirement plan", is to make a sale big enough so that he can afford to quit his job at Air America.  The next day, Senator Davenport ([[Lane Smith]]) arrives in Laos on a "fact finding mission", to investigate rumors about Air America transporting drugs on behalf of Laotian forces. Major Lemond ([[Ken Jenkins]]) and Rob Diehl ([[David Marshall Grant]]), CIA leaders of Air America, show the Senator around refugee camps, shrines, temples, and major cities in a careful deception to hide from him that Air America is indeed transporting drugs.  While airdropping livestock into rural villages in their [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123]] cargo aircraft, Billy and Jack Neely ([[Art LaFleur]]) are shot down. The [[Pilatus PC-6]] of General Soong (Burt Kwouk) arrives at the crash site and his soldiers load bags of opium on board, but leave Billy and Jack behind with Communist forces moving in. Gene and another pilot arrive and rescue them; Billy boards Gene's helicopter while the rest of the crew escape in another aircraft.  Billy and Gene's helicopter is shot down on the way back, and they are captured by a rural tribe.

Allowed to go free, Billy and Gene retreat to Gene's house, where Billy is surprised to discover that Gene has a wife and children. Already disillusioned with US actions in Laos, Gene convinces Billy to quit his job with Air America, but Billy wants to get even with General Soong for betraying him when he crashed.  Meanwhile, Senator Davenport is losing patience with Lemond and Diehl, and demands to know who is smuggling heroin. Soon after their return to base, the pilots learn that during his search for Billy and Gene, Jack was killed and Lemond and Diehl claim that he was the ring leader behind the drug trafficking. Enraged, Billy purchases grenades on the black market and uses them to blow up the heroin factory, but guards see him running away. Davenport is still unsatisfied and demands more concrete evidence.  The next day, Gene finds a buyer for his arsenal, allowing him to leave gunrunning, quit Air America, and take his family out of the country.

Agneepath (1990 film)
 Much-loved village schoolmaster Deenanath Chauhan ([[Alok Nath]]) strongly opposes the plans of [[Kancha Cheena]], an underworld don ([[Danny Dengzongpa]]) and his band of gangsters to set up a base for heroin smuggling. After being discredited in a set-up scandal and lynched by the manipulated villagers, his family is evicted and made destitute much to Cheena's advantage. Swearing revenge after his father's murder and the attempted rape of his mother Suhasini Chavan ([[Rohini Hattangadi]]) go unpunished, and with a burning desire to clear his father's name, his son Vijay ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) takes on the responsibilities of caring for his mother and sister Siksha ([[Neelam Kothari|Neelam]]) that, by a strange twist of fate, cause him to become a gangster in his own right. Working his way up the ladder and attaining notoriety as an underworld kingpin, Vijay suffers an assassination attempt by fellow gangsters after he refuses to co-operate with their drug-smuggling operations. Left to die, he is discovered by Krishnan Iyer M.A. ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]) who transports him to hospital and saves his life, and who eventually finds employment as Siksha's bodyguard. During his time in hospital, Vijay is cared for by Nurse Mary Matthew ([[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]]).  Vijay avenges his assassination attempt by killing his killers one by one, but his mother strongly disapproves of his murderous and gangster tendencies and drives him away from home after chastising him for dirtying the good name of his father. Vijay, hurt and upset, seeks solace in Mary's arms and begins a relationship with her. Siksha is then kidnapped and held in a slum by a gangster who wants to avenge the death of his associates killed by Vijay, and an unsuccessful rescue attempt by Krishnan ends up with the two of them brawling. Vijay hears of this and arrives to kill the gangster in a fit of rage. But this close encounter between Krishnan and Siksha causes a growing intimacy between the two of them and they fall in love with each other. Vijay is outraged and strongly protests against the relationship to his mother, but is rebuffed again when his mother disowns him a second time and considers Krishnan her "good son". Stung and deeply hurt by this slight, he again seeks solace in Mary and later marries her and resolves to do things "in the right way" to gain his mother's favour.  After cutting a deal with Kancha Cheena to allow him access into his old village, Vijay sets in motion a number of strategies that undercut Cheena's criminal operations and gain him the legal ownership of the village. Revenge is a dish best served cold as Vijay informs Cheena of his identity as the son of Dinanath Chavan, lands Cheena in jail and arranges for Cheena's associates to testify against him in court. Vijay returns the village to his mother and finds himself back in her favour, but Cheena ensures his release by arranging for the witnesses to be gunned down and Vijay's family to be kidnapped and held hostage. This is the last straw for Vijay who is forced to return to his criminal ways and to walk the "Path of Fire" in order to rescue them. An almighty struggle takes place as Cheena bombs every building and demolishes the whole village before he is killed by Vijay's bare hands. But Vijay does not survive; he dies tragically of a bullet wound in the lap of his mother at the site of his old house. His mother realises that everything Vijay had done until then had been for the ultimate purpose of restoring the good name of Dinanath Chavan, and she weeps over his body piteously along with Krishnan, Siksha and Mary.

Almost an Angel
 Terry Dean (Paul Hogan), a professional burglar specialized in sabotaging [[Surveillance|electronic surveillance system]]s, stands before his release from yet another stint in prison. Following a fellow inmate's suggestion, he decides to switch to [[bank robbery]] instead, with a special twist of his own design: first by having the security cameras record TV shows he would connect them to with a modified remote control, then entering disguised as a celebrity; the confusion over this unexpected appearance would serve to confound a detailed description.  Terry's first heist (disguised as [[Willie Nelson]]) is successful, but shortly afterwards he witnesses a young boy about to be overrun by a van; he impulsively pushes the child away and is himself hit. While in the hospital, he has a nebulous experience (which may have been caused by ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'' playing on the room's TV) in which he meets God ([[Charlton Heston]]; this is used as a pun later on) who introduces himself as Terry's 'probation helper'. Though Terry has lived a sinful life, his last deed, impulsive as it was, has earned him a second chance to save his soul - by doing God's work as an [[angel]] in training.  After reawakening, Terry tries another bank hold-up (this time disguised as [[Rod Stewart]]), but a stroke of luck occurs and a gang of amateur robbers interfere. As they escape, one of the thugs tries to shoot Terry, but gun was loaded with blanks by one of the other thugs. Thinking himself to be an immortal angel now, Terry reconsiders his ways, seeks advice in a church, and then he follows several 'signs' to another town. In a bar, he meets Steve Garner ([[Elias Koteas]]), an embittered young man confined to a wheelchair by a terminal sickness. In order to bring Steve out of his self-pity, Terry engages him in a fist-fight on equal terms, sitting fixed on a stool. Steve, taken with Terry's acceptance of him as a person, not a cripple, strikes up a friendship with Terry and offers him a place to stay at the youth center for children and teens, which he runs with his sister Rose ([[Linda Kozlowski]]).  Rose is at first suspicious about Terry, but Terry proves himself by slyly intimidating two drug dealers into leaving the center's area and helping out as much as he can, and Rose gradually falls in love with him. The center itself, however, is in financial difficulties, since its backer George Bealeman ([[Parley Baer]]), while claiming himself to be a faithful Christian, refuses to provide any more funds. Since he has no angel's powers, Terry uses his technical know-how to convince Bealeman otherwise: by recording and re-editing a segment from [[Televangelism|TV evangelist]] Rev. Barton's (Ben Slack) telecast (which Bealeman watches reverently), and fitting the cross at the rooftop of the center's church with lighting effects, triggered by his universal remote.  At the evening where Bealeman drops by, however, two police detectives close in on Terry. Steve, who happens to overhear them, rushes off in his wheelchair to warn Terry, but during the flight he injures himself critically, slowly bleeding to death. Just after Bealeman has left, he arrives at the center, and while Rose runs to calls an ambulance, Steve delivers his warning. Afraid of death, Steve feels lost, but is reassured he will find a place in Heaven when Terry uses the remote to trigger the lighted cross, creating a sign from God. No longer afraid of death, Steve dies in the arms of Terry and Rose.  Terry then announces that he has to leave, and trying to comfort Rose, he reveals that he is "almost an angel". Rose is understandably skeptical, but after Terry leaves, she checks his universal remote which he had left her as a keepsake, only to discover that it contains no batteries, and the cross nevertheless begins to shine brilliantly on its own. She runs after Terry and calls out to him. Distracted, Terry slips and falls right before a speeding truck and is about to be run over. Rose is shocked to witness that the truck passes right though him, proving he was really an angel all along. Having passed his angel's exam, Terry continues on his quest to do God's work (though not without promising to return), and Rose is left comforted at last.

The family seems to have moved on from their grief due to the stillborn child incident and live happily. After a few altercations with the kids in the colony, Arjun and Anu are accepted by all the kids as their own. The kids are all for pulling pranks and generally causing a clamor around the apartment colony. One such constant joke they play on a mentally disabled ex-watchman ([[Janakaraj]]) of the colony, much to the chagrin of his wife. The only tenant they are afraid of is an ex-convict ([[Prabhu Ganesan]]) who lives alone in one of the apartments.  On one particular day, Chitra and the kids decided to surprise Shekar by meeting him at his construction area, unannounced. Nevertheless, on coming to the site, they learned from one of the construction workers that Shekar has left to conduct an emergency matter elsewhere. When Shekar returns home for dinner that night, Chitra casually asks Shekar where he was on that day, to which, Shekar replies that he was at the construction site the whole day.  Chitra feels hurt to hear about Shekar lying and leaves the dining hall. Arjun and Anu too sense that their father is lying to them and leave the place. Nevertheless, before leaving the room, Anu blurts out accusations on her father, saying that he's lying about being at the site the whole day. Sekhar apologises to Chitra and consoles her and they both make up.  On New Year’s Eve, Arjun slips out late at night with the older children to celebrate while Sekhar is out of town on a business trip. Nevertheless, while dancing with his friends on the road, Arjun sees Shekar with another woman and is shocked to know that his father has lied to them about going out of the town. Later, Arjun and the other children are hauled by the police back to their homes. Chitra is furious to learn about Arjun's escapade and when Shekar comes back, asks him to punish Arjun.  While Shekar inquires him about the incident, Arjun, who was still angry at his father, blurts out that he saw Shekar with another woman on New Year’s Eve. Chitra and Anu become shocked on hearing about the incident.

A few days later, while on the bus, Chitra spots Sekhar talking to a woman ([[Saranya Ponvannan]]). She gets out of the bus and confronts Shekar. Without waiting for his explanations, she rushes back home, packs her bags and threatens to walk out of the house with her kids. Sekhar pleads her to stay but she doesn’t stop. Finally, Shekar comes clean.  Their third child, Anjali ([[Shamili]]), was born mentally ill and with a terminal illness a few years ago. The doctors did not give the child more than a couple of months to live. To avoid the sadness for a couple of months from an already physically exhausted Chitra and to protect his children from the trauma, he colludes with the doctors to lie to his family that the child was stillborn. But much to the surprise of everyone, the child has made it past her second birthday and is seemingly physically healthy. The woman Shekar was talking to is Anjali’s doctor. Although Chitra is saddened by this betrayal, she decides to bring Anjali back home.  Anjali is not like a normal child and requires constant attention from both the parents. This causes the other two siblings to dislike Anjali. Moreover, the other kids in the colony and school tease them by making fun of Anjali’s condition. One day, the other kids in the colony make fun of Anjali by tying a string of cans behind her. This causes Arjun to fight with the other kids. He gets bruised which saddens Anjali, but a special bond is born between the siblings. Arjun becomes protective of her and challenges the other kids in the colony to a fight if they can’t accept her. The kids accept Anjali and all the kids come to love her.  This causes the parents of the kids to worry as they don’t want their kids to be close with a mentally disabled child. During an apartment association meeting, the parents of the kids demand that Shekar and Chitra either leave the apartment or institutionalize Anjali. The only person to argue for Anjali’s presence is the ex-convict. The parents are afraid of him and let it go. But soon, Anjali wins over everyone in the apartment complex and everyone comes to like her.  Meanwhile, Shekar, during a late-night visit to his construction site with Chitra and Anjali, is witness to a murder.  He reports this to the police and the murderer is arrested.  The murderer is enraged and visits Shekar’s house after getting out on bail. He physically assaults and plans on killing Shekar. But the ex-convict comes to the rescue and kills the murderer in the altercation when he threatens Shekar’s family and is arrested.  The ex-convict thanks Shekar before leaving as Anjali was the only person to show compassion to him.  The next morning, Anu wakes up and goes to wake up Anjali, but she doesn’t get up.

He comes across to a house where single mother Maria Ordonez lives with her son Martin and her mother. Maria tells Jacques that they were supposed to have taken their house off the listings due to being in an unsafe neighborhood. However, Maria decides to let Jacques stay.  That night, on his way to a college social, Jacques finds himself confronted by two neighbors, Chuy and Jesus. Brandishing a small knife, Jacques warns the duo not to mess with him. At the mixer, Jacques gets the attention of fellow student Sarah as well as the graduate dean, who is unimpressed with him. As Jacques walks Sara home, they are stopped by Jesus and Chuy, who are with their gang boss, Angel and other gang members. When some of the gang members start to cause trouble, Jacques intervenes and uses his martial arts skills. This scares Angel and the gang away. However, when Jacques returns to the Ordonez home, he is met again by Jesus, Chuy, and more of Angel's gang. An attempt to ambush Jacques lets them to a nearby bush, where the gang members beat themselves up while Jacques walks away. This impresses Frank, a former war vet who lives across the street, but is also upset at the fact that he's paralyzed from the waist down from the war.

Jacques decides he must help Martin out of his ordeal. During an attack at the house, Martin's grandmother passes out from the stress and is taken to the hospital. With Maria working, Jacques decides to take Martin to a local martial arts school run by good friend Henry, who is the one who convinced the Olympic Committee to bring Jacques to L.A. Henry knew Martin's father Pedro, who had protested vehemently against Angel and his gang and was ultimately murdered by Angel, which Martin doesn't know. Jacques decides to teach Martin some self-defense along with Henry and tells him the ramifications of what can and will happen should Martin decide to join Angel's gang.  Upon returning home, Martin is in shock to learn his grandmother had passed. It was because Angel's goons once again started trouble and Frank tells Jacques that she ended up having a massive heart attack, yelling for Martin. Maria has learned what Jacques had been doing and she realizes that she can trust him and divulges the truth about Pedro's death and why the streets are no longer safe. When Maria and Jacques are shot at by Angel and his gang, Jacques turns to Henry and his wife to help protect Maria and Martin. Henry finds a connection with Mr. Park, a Korean gang boss who knows of all the gangs. He warns Henry and Jacques that Angel can be intimidated, but it is his gunfire that gives him his power.  On his way to campus, Angel sends men to get rid of Jacques but they fail. Jacques has had enough and wages war on Angel and his crew. He goes as far as killing Angel's female driver to send him a message. However, Angel declares war and begins with a vicious assault on Maria, who is taken to the hospital. Martin, having had enough, goes back to his house and arms himself with a shotgun. With the help of Frank, who arms himself with a machine gun, the duo begin to shoot at any of Angel's gang who invade Martin's house. When Angel and the rest of the gang show up, they begin to slowly begin their assault. However, just when Martin runs out of ammo, one gang member throws a stick of dynamite but is stopped by a returning Jacques.  Jacques has also brought Henry and some of Henry's martial arts students. They begin their own assault, using their martial arts skills to dispatch most of Angel's gang. Jacques puts dynamite in Angel's car and Angel narrowly escapes when the car explodes. Jacques and Angel begin to fight and just when Jacques is about to knock Angel out, Henry convinces him that it should be Martin who should fight Angel. Angel puts up much of the fight but Martin, finally having the advantage, beats Angel and kicks him while he is on the ground repeatedly until he is unconscious. Jacques finally tells Martin he did what he had to and the police show up, including a helicopter whose light shines on Angel.

Dr. Metcalf diagnoses a heart attack, although Ross suspects that something else was at work. After a spider also kills a football player whom Ross treated, he becomes known to the town as "Dr. Death". When Dr. Metcalf himself is bitten, in his own bedroom, and dies, Ross suspects deadly arachnids could be infesting the town.  Ross and county coroner Milton Briggs perform an [[autopsy]] on the victims and confirm Ross' suspicion that the deaths were caused by spider bites. Atherton arrives in town with his assistant Chris Collins, joining Briggs, Sheriff Lloyd Parsons and [[Pest control|exterminator]] Delbert McClintock in the spider investigation. They discover that the killer spiders have a short life expectancy due to being a mixed breed. Atherton tells them that the spiders are soldiers, sent out to eliminate potential threats for the general male spider. He also learns that the general spider produced a queen, which it likely mated with to produce a second nest someplace, guarded by the queen, which could produce fertile offspring.  Atherton elaborates that the transplanted spiders can progressively expand their territory, possibly culminating in their [[supercolony|worldwide dispersal]]. The group sets out to destroy both nests and kill the queen and general.  Deducing that the nest is in his barn, Ross sends Delbert to destroy it. Delbert finds Dr. Atherton dead, having been bitten by the general after disturbing the web. Chris gets the Jennings family out of their infested house, but Ross falls through the floor into his wine cellar, which turns out to be the spiders' second nest, guarded not only by the queen but also the general spider.  After electrocuting the queen, Ross battles the general while also attempting to burn the second egg sac. He becomes trapped underneath fallen debris, with the general about to deliver the killing strike, when Ross flings the general into the fire. As the egg sac hatches, the general jumps out of the fire. Ross shoots it with a nail gun and the projectile sends the burning spider into the egg sac, destroying the nest with fire and ending the plague.  The Jennings family immediately moves back to San Francisco, appreciating city life once more, despite such minor inconveniences as earthquakes.  
Archangel (1990 film)
 ''Archangel'' is set in 1919 in the northern Russian area of Archangel, during a brief historical moment of Canadian intervention in the Bolshevik Revolution following the end of World War I. One-legged Canadian soldier Lt. John Boles sighs on the rail of a steamship over the ashes of his dead lover Iris. An officer mistakes Iris' urn for a bottle of liquor and throws it overboard into the sea. A narrator then delivers a sermon on the glories of Love and the horrors of Self-Love/Pride and how it forms the roots of War. (Maddin's daughter Jilian makes a cameo here as a young Cossack girl who orders the execution of a young boy.)<ref>Beard, William. ''Into the Past: The Cinema of Guy Maddin''. Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010. Print. 56. </ref>  Boles arrives in the town of Archangel as an Allied trooper and billets with a local family consisting of a brave son, Geza, a cowardly father, Jannings, and mother Danchuk (who is immediately smitten with Boles) and a grandmother simply called "Baba" along with a seemingly nameless baby. Geza has a seizure as Boles arrives but Boles treats him by scrubbing the boy's torso with horsehair brushes. He then prescribes Geza horsehair to eat (to cure worms) and other folk remedies, while scoffing at the folk remedies Baba offers. Veronkha enters and Boles spies her in a mirror and faints, so affected by her resemblance to his lost love Iris. After reviving, Boles remains convinced that Veronkha in fact ''is'' Iris, forgetting that Iris has died. As coincidence would have it, Veronkha's husband Philbin also suffers amnesia, and has forgotten everything after his wedding day. He arrives with his doctor who explains that Philbin will relive his wedding day over and over without remembering what came after. Veronkha rebuffs Philbin's advances and leaves.  Boles dresses up in full regalia and Geza admires his medals, for which Danchuk decides he should be punished. Jannings is too cowardly to flog the boy, so Boles steps in to whip Geza, which makes Geza admire Boles further. The citizenry of Archangel next participates in staging various battle tableaux, posing as victorious over the Huns while a narrator provides commentary on their bravery. Soon after, a real battle takes place, after which Boles and Danchuk travel over a field of corpses that they discover are mostly just resting. However, they do raise one grave marker for a single dead soldier. Boles next follows Veronkha, hoping to learn where she lives, but instead she goes to meet with Philbin's doctor and is hypnotized so that she can recount her wedding night, during which Philbin first forgets their marriage and Veronkha finds him having sex with the front-desk girl. The doctor mentions a rumour that Veronkha has had a child and Boles somehow jumps to the conclusion that the child is his (belonging to him and Iris, who he still believes Veronkha to be) and confuses Danchuk's baby as this child, heading back to his billet to console said baby.  Boles sets out to find Veronkha's home yet again, following a treasure map that is also her marriage certificate to Philbin. The dreamlike trek ends in failure. Next another battle begins, prefaced by a flood of rabbits into the "sleepy trenches" where the soldiers have all but fallen asleep. At the last minute they realize that the rabbits have been fleeing the Bolsheviks and an attack is upon them. Some Bolsheviks break into the family's home and threaten Geza after eviscerating Jannings. However, in a final act of bravery, Jannings strangles them with his own intestines. Unfortunately, Geza's head has been covered with a burlap sack and even as his father dies a hero Geza believes him to have died a coward, believing he's been saved by Philbin.  Veronkha decides to renew her marriage to Philbin after annulling her first marriage, and they fly back to the Murmansk Hotel to repeat their honeymoon. Boles follows, and Veronkha mistakes Boles for Philbin, confessing a false love for Boles to Boles thinking she will Philbin jealous. Veronkha is so shocked when she discovers that Boles isn't Philbin that she develops amnesia as well. Boles takes this opportunity to try to convince Veronkha that she is Iris. Veronkha disappears, and Boles follows the marriage certificate/treasure map again to find her, and does. They reunite gloriously, until Veronkha sees Philbin and remembers who she is, then rejects Boles and threatens to kill him if he touches her again. Boles, dismayed, heads back to the war, although first he begs Danchuk to take care of "his" baby (actually, already hers) if anything should happen to him.  Geza is killed in this battle, his ghost reunited with the ghost of his father and finally realizing that his father died a hero, saving him. Boles launches a final assault and is injured by a grenade marked "Gott straffe Kanada" ["God punish Canada"], staggering through the same treasure map route that previously took him to Veronkha—this time he arrives at the scene of her marriage (again) to Philbin. Boles then leaves Archangel to return home to Canada, destroyed.  
Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again
 [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]], fifteen years after graduating from [[Riverdale High School (Archie Comics)|Riverdale High]], has become a successful lawyer and is preparing to marry his fiancée, Pam, and move to "the big city."  Before doing that, however, he returns home to [[Riverdale (Archie Comics)|Riverdale]] for his [[class reunion|high school reunion]] and save his friend Pop Tate's diner.  Archie and company are all now in their early thirties, with the trials and tribulations one might expect to have happened to such a group over the years:  * [[Betty Cooper|Betty]], a [[primary education|grade school]] teacher, has had problems finding permanent employment, and is constantly bossed around by a crummy boyfriend named Robert. * [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]], having lived in [[France]] since graduation, has been married (and divorced) four times. * [[Jughead Jones|Jughead]], now a [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], is also divorced (although only once), and now has sole custody of a son named Jordan. Due to the divorce and other failed relationships, Jughead carries [[emotional baggage]] that manifests itself in a terrible fear of women. (A [[running gag]] in the movie is Jughead's desperation to avoid seeing [[Ethel Muggs|Big Ethel]] during his visit to Riverdale.) This is played for laughs at the end when at the reunion it turns out that Big Ethel is no longer the gangly, awkward teenager she once was but is now a striking beauty. * [[Moose Mason|Moose]] and [[Midge Klump|Midge]] have gotten married and become [[chiropractic|chiropractors]]. They also have a son, Max, who hits it off with Jordan. * [[Reggie Mantle|Reggie]] is a gym owner.  When Archie sees Betty and Veronica for the first time in fifteen years, all his old feelings for them come flooding back, threatening his engagement—and it doesn't help that the girls renew their pursuit of Archie, heedless of the fact that he has a fiancée.  Meanwhile, Archie also tries to keep Reggie, helped along by an uncharacteristically menacing [[Hiram Lodge|Mr. Lodge]], from evicting Pop Tate from his [[soda shop]], under the pretext of expanding his gym.  Archie ultimately saves the Chock'lit Shoppe, though he loses Pam in the bargain, and decides to stay in Riverdale.

Asha has been lying to her mother that she works in a large company based in Calcutta and that she is building them a new house in Cochin. Sivaraman finds out about this and labels Asha a fraud. But when he learns about her family situation, he sympathises and decides to sacrifice his claim on the job. That night Sivaraman gets drunk and reveals the Asha's fraud to Nambi. Asha confesses, but justifies that projecting herself as rich and employed was the only way to comfort her mother.

Awakenings
 In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer ([[Robin Williams]]) is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the [[New York City]] borough of [[The Bronx]]. After working extensively with the [[catatonia|catatonic]] patients who survived the 1917–1928 epidemic of [[encephalitis lethargica]], Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Leonard Lowe ([[Robert De Niro]]) proves elusive in this regard, but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a [[Ouija]] board.  After attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]], Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results: Leonard completely "awakens" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience "awakenings" back to reality.  Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula ([[Penelope Ann Miller]]), the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated, a number of [[Levodopa-induced dyskinesia|facial and body tics are starting to manifest]], which Leonard has difficulty controlling.  While Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary measure. As the first to "awaken", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of "awakening". Leonard's tics grow more and more prominent and he starts to shuffle more as he walks, and all of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. He soon begins to suffer full body spasms and can hardly move. Leonard puts up well with the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula where he tells her he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him, and for this short period of time his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased.  Sayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the "awakening" did not last, another kind — one of learning to appreciate and live life — took place. For example, he himself overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello ([[Julie Kavner]]) to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar proposal from her. The nurses also now treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula is shown visiting Leonard. The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board, with his hands on Leonard's hands, which are on the planchette. "Let's begin," Sayer says.

While he and Marty explore a [[Branch line|rail spur]] they intend to use, they spot a horse-drawn wagon going amok. Doc saves the passenger, [[Clara Clayton]], and the two fall in love. At a town festival, Buford tries to kill Doc, but Marty thwarts his attempt. Buford then challenges Marty to a showdown in two days.

Marty arrives on October 27, 1985, escaping the powerless DeLorean before it is destroyed by an oncoming [[Rail freight transport|freight train]]. He discovers that everything has returned to the initial post-time travel timeline, and finds Jennifer sleeping on her front porch. He uses the lessons he learned in 1885 to avoid being goaded into a street race with Douglas J. Needles, avoiding a possible automobile accident.

As Marty and Jennifer witness the time machine wreckage, a locomotive equipped with a [[flux capacitor]] appears, manned by Doc, Clara, and their two children [[List of Back to the Future characters#Jules and Verne Brown|Jules and Verne]]. Doc gives Marty a photo of the two of them by the clockworks at the 1885 festival. Jennifer asks about the fax, and Doc tells them it means that the future has not been written yet. Doc departs and the train disappears into an unknown time.  
Baaghi: A Rebel for Love
  The story centres on Saajan, the son of a colonel in the Indian army, and Kaajal, a modest girl from a respectable family. The film opens with Saajan travelling in a bus, when he catches a glimpse of Kaajal on another bus, and they are both smitten. They do not formally meet and, since Saajan is off to start at college, he does not think he will ever see her again. But his new friends at college, Buddha, Tempo and Refill, one night insist on visiting a [[brothel]] in a seedier part of [[Bombay]]. Saajan only reluctantly agrees, but ultimately refuses to select a prostitute &mdash; until he hears a new girl being beaten by her pimp and decides to protect her. To his surprise, it is Kaajal (called Paro at the brothel), who has been kidnapped by a pimp after she was tricked by a job offer in Bombay.  Kaajal, who has only very recently arrived at the brothel and is still a virgin, has adamantly refused to be a prostitute. This is why Jaggu, who runs the brothel, is beating her. When finally alone with Saajan as a paying client (although he does not do anything with her), Kaajal explains to him how she was forced to look for work after her parents' deaths: This ultimately led to her travelling to Bombay and being kidnapped by Dhanraj and forced to work in Jaggu's brothel. Thanks to Leelabai, the madame who helps run the brothel, Saajan is able to spend time with Kaajal, and Kaajal is somehow able to resist becoming a prostitute. Saajan and Kaajal fall in love, and he tries to find a way to get her out of the brothel before Kaajal gives up hope.  When Saajan is finally able to introduce Kaajal to his parents, they &mdash; not surprisingly &mdash; reject the idea of his marrying a girl from a brothel, even if she was taken there against her will and is from a respectable family. Since Saajan's father, Col. Sood, was already angry with his son for refusing to follow family tradition to join the Indian army, this is the last straw. Saajan is kicked out of his house. He becomes, in his own words, a rebel, a word which is repeated several times in the movie. Since Kaajal is already rebelling against Jaggu because she believes in love, they are now both "rebels for love." Saajan's college friends help Kaajal escape the brothel and flee to [[Ooty]], near where her grandparents live. But just as they are about to be married with Kaajal's grandparents' consent, if not Saajan's father's, police arrive and take them back to Bombay, where they claim he's wanted for kidnapping "Paro".  Saajan's father, on hearing of his heroics fighting Dhanraj's men to rescue Kaajal, has a new-found respect for his son, who had previously been a lazy drifter. With the help of Saajan's friends, Col. Sood finds his son outside Jaggu's brothel. There the "police" (who are actually working for Dhanraj) have returned Saajan and Kaajal to Dhanraj, who is preparing to punish them for her leaving the brothel. The intervention of Leelabai on Kaajal's behalf leads to yet another fight, with several people switching alliances.  
¡Ay Carmela!
 Carmela, Paulino, and Gustavete - who is [[Muteness|mute]] as the result of an explosion - are a trio of travelling [[vaudeville]] performers. Amidst the chaos of the Spanish Civil War, they are in the town of [[Montejo]], entertaining republican troops with their variety show. They are survivors who are motivated, not exactly by patriotism, but by a desire for self-preservation. Their show consists of four acts. It begins with Carmela singing and dancing a traditional song. The audience is enthusiastic during her performance, but the mood changes completely when the sound of approaching nationalist planes is heard.  As the planes fly overhead, Paulino reads a poem by [[Antonio Machado]] which introduces a note of patriotic fervour in accordance with republican feeling in 1938. The seriousness of the moment is followed by a comic routine in which Paulino twists himself into a variety of ridiculous postures in an attempt to break wind. The fourth and final act is a 'tableau vivant' in which Carmela represents justice while Paulino brandishes the republican flag and they sing a song of freedom.  The dangers and deprivation that they encounter in the republican side encourage the trio to go to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. To obtain gasoline for the trip Carmela has to distract a republican truck driver while Paulino and Gustavete steal the fuel. They make this difficult journey on a misty night and inadvertently end up in nationalist territory. They are detained by a nationalist officer and are incriminated by the republican flag they carry amongst their props. They are arrested and taken as prisoners to the local school, which serves as a prison camp where the republicans are held. Carmela befriends a fellow prisoner: a [[Poland|Polish]] soldier member of the [[International Brigade]] and is surprised that he has come to fight in Spain, a foreign land whose name he cannot even pronounce. In an atmosphere of mounting tension and terror, some of the prisoners are taken away to be shot. Carmela, Paulino and Gustavete are driven away in an army car. They are convinced that they are also going to be killed, but instead they are taken to the local theatre where they meet an [[Italy|Italian]] officer, Lieutenant Amelio di Ripamonte. Surprisingly, the lieutenant, learning that they are performers, wants them to take part in a show he has been planning to entertain the nationalist troops. They must stage a burlesque of the Republic in exchange for their freedom.  For the variety show that they are to perform to the nationalists, Paulino rewrites their old script. From the outset, the fiery and patriotic Carmela is defiant and unwilling to go along with it, displaying her true convictions as an anti-fascist.  However, Paulino persuades her that since their lives are at stake she must collaborate in the performance of the now anti-republican numbers.   On the day of the show, both artists are indisposed as Carmela has her period and Paulino has an upset stomach from eating a rabbit which Gustavete, writing on his slate, now confirms to have been a cat. The presence of the Polish prisoners, who have been brought to witness a mockery of their ideals, greatly upsets Carmela, and she initially refuses to perform a number involving the republican flag. Structurally, the show is largely similar to the one they used to perform for the republican troops. Musical numbers are followed by a poem, now read by the lieutenant. The third act involves a comic sketch, "The Republic goes to the Doctor". In this simplistic parody,  Paulino plays a gay republican doctor who is visited by a female patient, the Spanish Republic, played by Carmela. She claims that she has been made pregnant by a [[Soviet Union|Russian]] lover, played by Gustavete. In a number which gives full scope to all the possible sexual innuendos the audience cares to imagine, Carmela invites the doctor to insert his thermometer in her, to which he refuses, making the excuse that it is broken.   Carmela, increasingly irritated by the mockery of the Republic and enervated by the presence of the Polish soldiers, gradually loses heart in her performance, and her frustration at the mockery of the ideals she holds dear seethes to the surface jeopardizing the credibility of the parody. The sketch quickly disintegrates as the Polish soldiers begin to rebel in the galleries and the fascists become infuriated. The scene comes to a climax as Carmela starts singing 'Ay Carmela' and lowers the republican flag to expose her breasts in defiance of the earlier cries of 'Whore!' from the audience. A nationalist officer then emerges from the stalls, raises a pistol and shoots Carmela in the forehead. Gustavete, suddenly recovers his voice calling out in anguish, but Carmela falls to the floor dead.  The next scene shows Paulino and Gustavete visiting Carmela's rudimentary grave which they decorate with flowers and the latter’s chalk board, now redundant since Gustavete regained his voice when Carmela was shot. The only words here are spoken by Gustavete – "Come on, Paulino" – as he leads him away. The two men take to the road again and the song "[[Ay Carmela (song)|¡Ay Carmela!]]" rises in the background closing the film as it had begun and taking it into the credits.

Bandh Darwaza
 The film opens in the ruins of Kali Pahari (Black Hills, a decrepit complex of caves), and introduces the vampire Neola.<ref>Neola is the Hindi word for mongoose. It is commonly used as a nickname for a villain.</ref> Neola, a [[Dracula]]-like vampire, sleeps in a coffin by day, and transforms into a bat at night to hunt humans from the neighbouring villages. He craves a steady supply of human blood, and a supply of fresh young women (so he may seduce them and spread his evil seed). Neola is assisted by a ragtag bunch of servants who lure innocent humans (mostly women) to Kali Pahari so Neola may easily prey on them. His servants include Mahua (a witch-woman), Mahaguru (an evil priest), a ''tantrik'' (evil wizard) and various other henchmen that provide muscle for his evil deeds.  Mahua is employed as a maid in the household of a righteous Thakur (baron) Pratap. The Thakur spots her speaking with Baku one evening. Knowing of Baku's association with the evils of Kali Pahari, the Thakur threatens to fire Mahua if she is ever caught with any of the gang again. Mahua, however, is under orders to source a new maiden for Neola.  The upright Thakur is wealthy, well liked and happy, except for the fact that his wife Lajo is unable to have children. The local temple priest reassures her, but she is deeply perturbed when the Thakur's ''mausi'' (aunt) arrives and urges him, citing the necessity of progeny, to consider marrying again. Mahua moves in. She promises Lajo will bear children if Lajo will agree to come to Kali Pahari where Neola will grant her wish, on the condition that if she bears a son she can keep him but if she gives birth to a daughter the child will be Neola's property and should be handed over to him. Lajo refuses at first, but Mahua prevails over Lajo's vulnerability and Lajo accepts the deal. Accordingly, she goes to Kali Pahari, where she is bathed in milk and Neola appears and hypnotises her.   At midnight Neola had sex with Lajo. Lajo fully hypnotised co-operated with Neola to have sexual intercourse. Lajo woke up early morning to found herself fully nude sleeping with Neola. Lajo later returned to her Haveli unaware that Neola had made her pregnant. Thereafter, Lajo gives birth to a daughter Kamya. But when Mahua claims the child, Lajo naturally refuses point-blank and drives her away. Mahua poisons Lajo on the instructions of Neola. Lajo confronts Thakur and tells him the truth and tells him to rescue Kamya, who is abducted by Mahua and taken to Kali Pahari.  Lajo succumbs to the poison. Enraged, the Thakur enters Kali Pahari and, after a long fight, is able to drive a magic stake through Neola to put him down. Gravely wounded, Neola staggers back to his coffin deep within the caves (behind a ''bandh darwaza'' or closed doorway) and lies within it to rest and recover.  Some twenty years later, Kamya grows up to be a beautiful girl. She has her heart set on Kumar, her childhood crush, but he wards off her advances as childish tomfoolery. Kumar likes Sapna (the sister of his friend Anand). Sapna lives in Mumbai in a hostel and on her way back to her home she meets a woman who asks for a lift to Kali Pahari in the dead of night. Sapna drops her at Kali Pahari, but unknowingly the woman forgets her book in Sapna's car. It's a black magic book. Sapna follows the woman to return the book, where she sees the woman laying down on a ritual table where a priest, surrounded by some strange people, stabs her. Sapna screams seeings this. The priest orders his men to nab her, but she flees and in a hurry she drops the book at Kali Pahari. Shaken by this event, she reaches Kumar's home and narrates everything to Anand and him. Next day the trio visit Kali Pahari and there is nothing at all there like what Sapna had described.   Sapna says she was not dreaming and shows them the book she mistakenly dropped there last night. On the way they meet Kamya, who invites the trio for her birthday party. Things get interesting when Kumar begins to portray affections towards Sapna at Kamya's birthday party. Shaken by this, Kamya taunts Sapna, due to which Sapna leaves the venue. Kamya in the meanwhile, makes a direct move, but Kumar bluntly snubs her. On her way back home, Sapna encounters the same woman who was stabbed the previous night. She demands her book and sits in Sapna's car. Sapna reaches home and finds the book. In the meanwhile, Kumar reaches Sapna's home searching for her as she had left the party midway. Sapna tells him about that strange woman. Kumar throws the book out of her house and tells her to stop thinking about all this. Kamya finds the book as she was following Kumar. She reaches home and reads the book and finds ways how she can achieve Kumar through witchcraft. While driving, that strange woman (of the Kali Pahari gang), crashes her car, and is taken by the gang to the altar of Neola. Kamya is cured of her injuries by the priest by black magic and they tell her she can achieve everything if she joins their gang, she agrees.  Kamya practices witchcraft on Kumar at a graveyard. He reaches there and starts making love to her. Anand and Sapna reach there and rescue Kumar. Anand finds Kumar's photograph at the graveyard and instantly believes that Kamya is behind all this as he has seen Kamya before with the strange people of Kali Pahari. One day Kamya is invited to Kali Pahari at night for a ritual. It's a trap to get Kamya to revive Neola, who was asleep all these years. He recognises Kamya bites her and beds with her. She is now forever trapped behind the bandh darwaza and is a sex slave to Neola. Kumar, Anand and Sapna enter Kali Pahari to rescue Kamya. They finally find her, barely conscious, deep within the catacombs in a glass coffin. They try to rescue her, but the place gets filled with smoke and Neola abducts her.  Kamya is hypnotised by the ''tantrik'' to serve Neola forever. Now Kamya gets orders to source more women for Neola. She approaches Bhanu (Anand's wife) and lures her to Kali Pahari, but Kumar, Anand and some of his friends arrive there in time to rescue Bhanu before Neola can seduce her. Kamya's next target is Sapna. Sapna, too, is rescued in the nick of time, but Kumar and Anand discovers that Kamya is behind all this. They report back to the Thakur, and he decides to finish Neola once and for all. Upon entering Kali Pahari, the Thakur finds Mahua, who informs him with evil glee of the bargain behind the birth of Kamya, and that Kamya is now entirely in Neola's power. Furious, the Thakur beheads Mahua. But Neola is unstoppable. He beckons Bhanu once again, and this time, he succeeds in biting her. Neola attacks Sapna yet again, and follows her to the Thakur's home. After a prolonged chase, Neola kills both Bhanu and Anand and nearly gets Sapna, but is thwarted in the nick of time by the Thakur. The Thakur reveals the tale of Kamya's birth to Kumar and Sapna.  The three of them enter Kali Pahari to recover Kamya. They finally find her, barely conscious, deep within the catacombs. They are immediately set upon by the gang, various henchmen, and Neola himself. They fight their way out and wound Neola once again, but are somehow unable to kill him. As Kamya tries to kill neola by stabbing him with a dagger, she too is surrounded by goons. They hurl her upon the iron door, laden with pointed spikes. The spikes fully pierce Kamya's tender body, thus killing her. The evil woman and the ''tantrik'' carry away Neola in a brougham. Kumar gives chase, and captures the ''tantrik'', and threatens to kill him unless he discloses Neola's Achilles heel. The ''tantrik'' reveals that Neola's soul is trapped within a statue at Kali Pahari and his weakness is sunlight. Kumar and the Thakur devise a two phase plan to finish Neola. Kumar and Sapna follow the brougham away from Kali Pahari, and round up the townsfolk to engage Neola. Neola attacks them in a frenzy. Just as he gets within reach of Sapna, he is involuntarily seized with pain and bursts into flames (as the Thakur sets the evil statue afire).  The film ends with Kumar, Sapna and the Thakur looking on as Neola is destroyed forever.

Bird on a Wire (film)
 Marianne Graves ([[Goldie Hawn]]) is a successful lawyer completing a business deal in Detroit, Michigan. At a gas station, she crosses paths with a man that looks suspiciously like her ex-fiancé, Rick Jarmin ([[Mel Gibson]]), who had disappeared 15 years previously and was presumed dead. The man feigns ignorance and Marianne leaves; he later makes a call saying that he has been recognized and needs to be moved. Rick had helped convict a drug-dealing DEA agent named Eugene Sorenson ([[David Carradine]]) and was placed in the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|witness protection program]]. Unfortunately, his old handler has retired and his new handler, Joe Weyburn ([[Stephen Tobolowsky]]), is a corrupt FBI agent working with Sorenson.  Sorenson is released from prison after serving his sentence; his partner, Albert "Diggs" Diggins ([[Bill Duke]]), picks him up and they set out to kill Rick for revenge and to smooth the passage of their latest deal with drug dealers.  Marianne returns to confront Rick just as Sorenson and Diggs show up at the gas station with guns blazing. During the gunfight, Rick gets buckshot in his buttocks and his kindly old boss is killed. Marianne escapes with Rick, but Sorenson and Diggs pin the boss’ murder on Rick. They are forced to go on the run as Weyburn wipes out Rick’s file and sends police to catch them.  To clear their names, Rick needs to reach his old handler.

He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A [[Jaguar XJ6]] and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete.  Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 [[Nissan Cedric#First generation 30|Nissan Cedric]] has been in the family for years and is immaculate  but extremely uncool.

Blind Faith (miniseries)
 In [[Toms River, New Jersey]], the Marshalls — Rob (Urich) and Maria (Kerns), and their three sons, 18-year-old Roby (Barry Gray), 17-year-old Chris ([[Jay Underwood]]) and 12-year-old John ([[Johnny Galecki]]) — are an apparently happy family living the [[American Dream]]. But in September 1984, Maria is shot and killed, and Rob claims she was murdered by a robber while he was changing a flat tire. When the police commence their investigations, however, they discover unsettling truths about the Marshalls: Rob has secretly accumulated an enormous debt and has secured a [[second mortgage]] of $100,000 in Maria's name, and is having an affair with a married neighbor, Felice Richmond ([[Robin Strasser]]). Maria had known of the affair, and had considered divorce but decided to work on their marriage shortly before she was killed.  Felice gives the police a statement that Rob wanted to get rid of his wife to collect on her life insurance, and he immediately becomes the prime suspect. At first, Rob's friends and sons support him. But they begin to notice that he does not seem to be in mourning over Maria's death, and Rob's best friend Sal ([[Joe Spano]]) is angry that he is more interested in building a future with Felice. Rob is advised by his lawyer not to contact Felice because it could influence his image; this troubles Rob, who is deeply in love with her. Meanwhile, the police have expanded their list of suspects to include Andrew Meyers (Jake Dengel), a Louisiana shop clerk who had contact with Rob concerning his financial problems, and Arnie Eggers, a rumored hitman.  As all evidence seems to point to Rob, Felice breaks off their relationship, which leads him to unsuccessfully attempt suicide in a motel. By this point, Chris admits for the first time that he suspects his father might in fact be guilty. Roby and John are both shocked to hear this, strongly believing in their father's innocence. Rob admits to Sal that he hired Ferlin L'Heureux ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]), a private detective, on the night his wife was killed to find out how he lost all of his money. Roby has trouble coping with a recent newspaper article in which his mother's personal life has been attacked. Upset, he is almost involved in a car accident. The police find an audio tape which Rob recorded shortly before he attempted to kill himself. On tape, he speaks about L'Hereux, who in turn claims that Ricky Dunlap ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) was the man hired to murder Maria. On Christmas Eve, Rob is arrested. Roby visits him in jail and is assured by his father that he is not guilty.  The trial begins at the Atlantic Courthouse in 1986. L'Hereux gives detailed testimony in which he claims that Rob hired him to murder Maria so that Marshall could collect on her insurance. L'Hereux states that he found her too beautiful to kill, and contacted Ricky Dunlap to finish the job. Under extreme pressure from the trial, Roby and John are unable to hide their emotions, and Chris turns into an angry young man wanting justice to be served. When the moment comes that Rob asks Roby to give false testimony which would provide him an alibi, it becomes clear to Roby that his father is not the person he thought him to be.  Dunlap is found not guilty. The entire blame goes to Rob, disparaged by prosecuting attorney Kelly ([[Dennis Farina]]) as "a legend in his own mind" whom he considers many times worse than Dunlap, even if he was not the one who performed the actual murder. Rob is sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]]. The narration reveals that, in 1990, Rob is on [[death row]], waiting for appeal; Roby finished college; Chris became a varsity swim coach; and John, who married at age 17, never stopped believing in his father's innocence.

The Big Bang (1989 film)
  The film opens in a fine restaurant with Toback meeting with a [[Hollywood]] producer, pitching him the idea for a movie. He says there will be no script, no actors, and no story. It will be a movie “about the people who are in it…about creation and disintegration, [[God]], life, love, sex, crime, madness, death, everything.” The restaurant scene "nods at ''[[My Dinner With Andre]]'', the classic model of a raconteur's film.”<ref></ref>  Toback tells the producer that the idea was inspired by his epiphany that the origin of the cosmos was an “orgasmic explosion of God.” The producer expresses skepticism and reluctance to finance the project.  The film begins to introduce the interview subjects, about 20 individuals who are only identified by their professions—the Astronomer, the Medical Student, the Filmmaker, the Gangster, the Girl, the Humorist, the Writer, the Restauranteuse, the Survivor, and so on.    Their introductions are interspersed by the ongoing pitch between the director and the executive. The Astronomer discusses the creation of the universe with a singularity, the [[Big Bang]], and the development of the stars and galaxies. Toback then asks each of the individuals how they believe the universe was created. Some have no idea. The Humorist believes there must have always been something, rejecting the ideas of nothingness and infinity. The Gangster says "I have no idea. You’d have to ask my brother the priest." The Girl says it began with "a piece of dust and then there was a squirrel. Then there was a dog. Then there was a cat...."  Toback continues with questions about love and sex. "The responses run the gamut from earnest to flippant, some are quite profound."<ref></ref> Some answer more confidently than others. When Toback asks each of them if they believe in God, many say yes, others aren’t so sure. The Writer provides the most unusual answer, saying, "I've seen him too many times to believe in him. The last time was in Baltimore, in a hotel. He was in the lobby, arguing about the size of his room."  "Toback, too, reveals himself in the process of asking his questions, poking fun, in his encounter with the Model (Sheila Kennedy), at his image as a lothario by lounging provocatively close to his attractive subject."<ref></ref>  As the film continues, some of the interview subjects are identified. The Restauranteuse is [[Elaine Kaufman]], the owner of [[Elaine's]] in [[New York City]], the long-time famous dining spot for celebrities. The Filmmaker identifies himself as [[Don Simpson]], producer of ''[[Flashdance]]'', ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'', and ''[[Top Gun]]''.  Toback begins to ask more poignant questions as the film moves along, which prompts some of the subjects to become more pensive. They begin to reveal more of themselves as the questions continue, especially in response to questions about death, madness, and whether they would kill someone.  Some of the individuals stand out for their painfully honest and sometimes troubling answers. Among them is the Gangster. He tells of his violent history, how he "gave a lot of guys beatings," how he was shot on the steps of a church by rival gang members as a kid, the love and insane jealousy he experienced for a woman and for whom he left his wife and children. He discusses his time in prison and his distant relationship with family members. There is a bright spot for the gangster. He is grateful for the year he spent with father as he was dying of a prolonged illness.  Toback asks if he would kill a complete stranger for a million dollars. The Gangster pauses for several seconds before answering that he would not. When the director presses and asks why not, the Gangster searches for an answer and replies, "I don't need the money." In an interesting glimpse into the future of art imitating life, we learn that the gangster is Genaro Anthony Sirico, Jr. and goes by [[Tony Sirico]]. Ten years after the film, he would become famous for portraying [[Paulie Gualtieri]] in the [[HBO]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]''.  The most poignant moments of the film are with the Survivor, a Jewish Hungarian woman who survived the [[death camps]] of [[World War II]]. She describes how as a young girl she and her mother were sent via train in a cattle car, packed with others, to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] where her sense of identity was erased. While at the camp, she and her mother were brought into a room with three other women. [[Dr. Josef Mengele]] entered the room. The Survivor describes him as evil incarnate, the Angel of Death. He separated the Survivor from her mother. When the Survivor asked a fellow woman prisoner where her mother is days later, the woman pointed to the black smoke of a chimney and said, "there she goes." The Survivor says, however, that her being a "mother and functioning to the best of her abilities means that [[Hitler]] didn't succeed."  Toback asks each of the subjects how the world will end and if they are concerned about it. The Gangster says, "it's the last thing on my mind" and that it doesn't frighten him at all. He’s more afraid of being alone. The Astronomer tells us the end of life on [[Earth]] will be the result of our sun running out of fuel. The writer says the world will end at the turn of the 21st century with his death.  The film ends where it began, in the restaurant with the director and producer continuing their discussion about financing it. The producer appears perplexed by the premise of such a movie and asks who will pay money to see it.

It's clear to Yu that the woman Ma Yue'e (Li Yanqiu), the wife of Adjutant Zhang (Zhao Chengshun), and Yang Baozhu (Wang Guofu), an orderly, are deeply in love with each other. They request that they be executed together, and Ma Yue'e explains that she betrayed Adjutant Zhang with his permission, because he is impotent. To help save their lives, Yu begs for forgiveness with Ma Muyuan, but is frustrated by Ma Muyuan's arrogance and lack of compassion. He attempts to write a letter to his superior to resign.

The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)
 Sherman McCoy is a [[Wall Street]] bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a [[Southern belle]] [[Gold digging|gold digger]]. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the "war-zone" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed.  Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish [[district attorney]] Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes.  Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the sub-letting landlord of Maria's apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment made by the authorities to prove that the woman is not in fact living in the rent-controlled apartment herself. She discovers information about the McCoy case (where Maria states she was driving the car), which she gives to Fallow, who in turn covertly supplies it to McCoy's defense attorney. Sherman gets his hands on a tape and plays the recording in court, where it reveals Maria directly contradicting the evidence she has just given, showing she has been perjuring herself and causing her to faint. Sherman plays the tape in a tape recorder inside his briefcase connected to a small loudspeaker that he holds on the desk.  When the judge orders that he approach the bench with this evidence, he asserts that the tape is his (making it admissible evidence), resulting in his acquittal. The people in the court go into an uproar, to which Judge White launches into a tirade that they have no right to act self-righteous and smarmy, or that they are above Sherman, considering Reverend Bacon claims to help disadvantaged New Yorkers but actually engages in race baiting, or that the District Attorney Weiss pushed this case not in the interest of justice but in the interest of appealing to minority voters to further his political career by appealing to their desire to "get even". After the Judge made his point, he begs the people to be decent and change their ways, letting Sherman go. A large audience is applauding Peter Fallow's premiere of his book. Fallow says that Sherman McCoy has moved away from New York City to an unknown destination, presumably to live in obscurity.

The four men attempt to save her, a plan which goes wrong and culminates in a shootout in the nightclub. During the altercation Paul discovers a box of gold in Leong's office and steals it. They escape the nightclub, but Sally is shot in the back and injured.  The next morning, the five of them wait by the river for a boat that is supposed to pick them up.  Ben and Frank are concerned with Sally and Paul guards the gold. They are attacked by gangsters and the ARVN as the boat arrives, and Sally dies just as they board it. Luke lets her body drift down the river. As they escape, the boat breaks down, and Paul becomes distressed over losing the gold. The three friends fight over Paul's preoccupation with the gold, and Ben and Frank tell him that the friendship is over. The boat is attacked by gangsters and sunk. Luke, Ben, and Frank escape, but Paul goes back for the gold, almost drowning before Ben and Frank save him and the gold.  Ben, Paul, and Frank are captured by the Vietcong and taken to a concentration camp. The Vietcong take the gold, and find intelligence documents in the box that Leong was going to sell to the North Vietnamese. The three friends are brutally interrogated, and Paul claims to work for the CIA to save the others. Frank is forced to kill other prisoners, which distresses him, but Ben asks to join in. When he is told to kill Frank he turns on their captors and they escape, aided by the arrival of a squad of Americans led by Luke. Paul escapes from the Vietcong as well and takes the gold into a field. Frank, who is wounded, follows him and begs for help. They hide from the Vietcong and Paul urges Frank to be quiet, but he continues to scream in pain and fear, and Paul finally shoots him in the back of the head to silence him. Luke rushes to Frank's side, finding him still alive, and loads him into a helicopter.  Ben chases Paul, who finds his way to a peaceful river village and steals a boat, massacring the villagers in the process. Ben witnesses this, and when he tries to save a child Paul shoots them both and escapes. Ben is saved by some monks, and eventually makes his way back to Saigon, where a badly disfigured Luke, who tells him that Frank is still alive, but that his head injury has changed him; he is now addicted to heroin and works as a contract killer.

Meanwhile, Paul has become a successful businessman. Ben confronts him over his actions, showing him Frank's skull and blaming him for what happened to him. Paul is indifferent and kicks Ben out.

 Clint Goodman is a successful [[general contractor|contractor]] who built his comfortable house and his construction company in his hometown through hard work. He loves his wife Joanna, but she is very resentful to him most of the time; they have been trying unsuccessfully to have a baby. Clint's best friend is Sheriff Sam Eberly and every now and then they spend the night fishing in the lake.  Unknown to Clint, Joanna has been having an affair with the local doctor Cortland van Owen. The lovers plot to kill Clint and sell his company and his house, then move to [[Beverly Hills]] to buy a clinic. Cortland gives poison to Joanna, which is taken from a rare poisonous tropical fish. She is hesitant at first to go along with the idea but changes her mind; when they are having dinner she spikes Clint's wine with the poison. Clint has a heart attack and dies. When the [[coroner]] asks if an [[autopsy]] should be done, Cortland refuses. While Clint is at the morgue he shows signs of life and just before he is to be embalmed, Joanna gives him a quick and cheap funeral instead, skipping the embalming process. Clint is put in a cheap water-damaged coffin, varnished to look like new. After his funeral, Joanna and Cortland celebrate.  During a stormy night, Clint, who has surprisingly survived the dosage, wakes up buried alive, and succeeds in escaping his grave. He goes to his house and finds the truth about his wife and the doctor. He hides himself downstairs in the basement to recuperate. The next morning, Joanna meets with a lawyer to discuss about selling his business for $1,500,000. Clint wakes up and plans to kill Joanna, but when Cortland comes by to pay a visit, he overhears that Joanna was pregnant and Cortland had conducted an abortion of his child behind his back. Clint decides shooting is too easy, and plots a dark revenge against Joanna and Cortland.  The next morning, after Joanna has sold Clint's business and collected the money, Sam discovers that Clint's grave is exhumed. After further examining the coffin, he believes that Clint could still be alive. Joanna goes into her bathroom and finds it covered with mud. She suspects that someone has been in her house. She frantically calls Cortland and is startled by their dog, Duke, whom she chased away earlier. Just as she's about to shoot the dog, Clint, disguised in a welding helmet and armor appears out of nowhere. She falls in the basement, knocking herself unconscious whilst Clint locks her inside and boards up the windows.  Meanwhile, at his apartment, Cortland is gathering some fish poison, putting it in a syringe and leaves. He arrives to see and secretly inject Joanna and finds the money lying on the bed. Cortland enters the basement, which is now open, as he searches for Joanna. Believing he might be the masked figure, she hits him in the head, causing him to drop his syringe which rolls out of view. She then takes the money and tries to escape but Clint locks them both inside. As Cortland regains consciousness, Joanna realizes her mistake, where he argues about wanting to burn the money to prove he truly loves her. As they both try to find a way to escape, Clint has replaced all the shotgun bullets with blanks and Duke is guarding the basement windows, making it impossible for them to leave the basement. In the meantime, Clint is knocking out some walls and moving furniture.  As time passes, Cortland suspects that Sam may be behind everything, whilst he is waiting for the figure to release them. Joanna finds the syringe filled with the fish poison and figures out that he was going to kill her and take clinic for himself. Cortland reveals that there never was a clinic and that he was going to take the money and move to the tropics so he can live the good life. As a result, they fight and just as Cortland is about to use the syringe, the door opens, where the pair find out that most of the house is now boarded up. While trying to find a way out, they are led through a maze of corridors and are split up. Cortland sees the figure (still thinking it's Sam) and tries to bribe him, secretly planning to syringe him with the poison. Clint appears, saying "Keep it." A stunned Cortland tries to get away, but trips and accidentally sticks himself with the poison, killing himself in the process. Soon after, Joanna is caught between Clint, who is now wearing the mask, and a small hatch. As her only option, she crawls through the hatchway where it dead-ends, allowing Clint to shut her inside. Clint reveals himself to her and speaks of their child, asking if it was a boy or a girl. He then puts the now dead Cortland and the money inside with her to what is now a wooden coffin, where he then nails it shut tight and sets the house on fire, leaving with his dog.  Sam, who now believes that Joanna and Cortland murdered Clint rides out to find the house set ablaze. When the fire is extinguished, there is no trace of a body inside the house anywhere. Sam then rides off and finds a person at Clint's grave, with his back to Sam. Realizing it is Clint, Sam tells him to never come back, and therefore promising to keep his secret. The final shot reveals that the still alive Joanna and the deceased Cortland now occupy Clint's grave, with the money.  
Cadence (film)
  Franklin Bean (Charlie Sheen) is shown in flashback with his father, a [[postal worker]] at his high school. His poor performance is attributed to a lack of discipline which a school officials assures the elder Bean can be fixed with a stint in the Army. Then, in present day, [[Private First Class|PFC]] Bean is attending his father's funeral before returning to his duty station in Germany. In his state of grief he gets [[drunk]], punches an [[Military police|MP]] and breaks through a plate-glass window in a local bar. Bean's army lawyer secures a plea deal, struck by his attorney Captain Ramon Garcia (Abraham), in lieu of a court martial which involves him removing unauthorized tattoos from his hands (obtained during his drunken rampage), paying for a broken window and serving 90 days in the camp [[stockade]]. He is met at the gates by a decorated Korean War veteran Master Sergeant named Otis McKinney (Martin Sheen).   McKinney explains that the stockade is fairly small and, as a result, he is in complete charge of the compound while being supported by two guards; Corporals Harold Lamar and Gerald Gessner. Bean finds a sympathetic ear in stockade guard Corporal Lamar after learning he is just as afraid of McKinney and only "serving his own time." Gessner is a somewhat spineless lackey to McKinney whom he clearly admires and respects.   Bean is introduced to his fellow prisoners, all of them black and led by section leader Roosevelt Stokes (Fishburne). Stokes is serving an unspecified sentence for larceny and, despite his conviction, apparently retains his rank of [[Corporal]]. Bean resists McKinney by refusing to refer to him as [[sergeant]] and refusing most military customs and courtesies. The prisoner detail is regularly trucked to a nearby farm where they perform manual labor such as digging ditches and building fences. While there, Bean becomes obsessed with a nonfunctional and off-limits [[windmill]]. He requests permission to repair the windmill from MSgt McKinney through Corporal Lamar but his request is denied. Bean submits a written request to the commanding officer, secretly bypassing McKinney by passing his request through Lamar, who grants him permission to work on the windmill only during meal breaks.   Bean challenges fellow inmate Webb, a Harlem born boxer, to a pickup game of basketball after suffering a humiliating loss to him in a fist fight which was initiated after Bean accused Webb of stealing his gold [[zippo]] lighter. Bean agrees to pay Webb $10 if he loses and Webb agrees to help Bean with his windmill project if Bean wins. Bean wins the game and begins building trust and credibility among the other prisoners. Bean begins to connect with the others and learns of some of their crimes. He soon shares a bunk with Bryce (Mankuma), who was convicted of murder despite his pleas to the contrary. Bryce advises that he expects his appeal to fail and to eventually be shipped out of the stockade to be hanged. Lawrence (Toles-Bey), a fellow prisoner who harbors sympathetic views toward the Nation of Islam, reveals that he was convicted of rape and sentenced to seven years though he denies his crime. Among the prisoners is also the largely silent Harry "Sweetbread" Crane (Stewart) who is an inspiring vocalist who sings at church services and leads the prisoners' soulful marching cadence.  In the meantime, McKinney becomes increasingly irritated with Bean's refusal to submit to his authority. It is revealed that he is estranged from his son, whom he states is roughly Bean's age. When McKinney calls his presumably ex-wife on his birthday hoping to speak to his son he is told that his son is unavailable sending McKinney into a drunken bender in the enlisted club. In the middle of the night he tries to break into the prisoner compound to confront Bean while yelling challenges to him. The noise rouses both Lamar and Gessner. Lamar threatens to arrest McKinney and refuses to comply with his order to open the gates. Gessner, however, makes a move to comply but is stopped by Lamar. A fellow sergeant and friend of McKinney arrives on the scene and is warned by Lamar that he will arrest McKinney unless he takes him away immediately and gets him to bed. During a Sunday visit with a friend from his unit, Bean is informed that they are being sent to Vietnam and that he will likely join them there after he is released from the stockade.  McKinney decides to try a nicer tact with Bean and invites him to his office to talk through their differences while plying him with chocolates, which Bean refuses. Bean states that McKinney is a bully and he hates everything he stands for. McKinney dismisses him and is visibly angry. The next day, while Bean and Webb are nearly finished with the windmill repair, McKinney arrives on the scene with a written order from a Colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers to cease all work on the windmill and placing it off limits for all personnel. When McKinney isn't present Webb and Bean return to the windmill to activate it despite the loud protestations from Gessner.   In the middle of a rainy night McKinney arrives at the prisoner barracks in rain gear and a combat helmet while holding a rifle. He orders the prisoners into the yard and summons Gessner. He writes up all of the prisoners, and Gessner, for appearing in formation out of uniform as they are all still in their underwear. He orders the men into the back of a [[deuce-and-a-half]] and orders Gessner to drive them to the farm where they normally work. Upon arrival he dismisses Gessner and orders him back to his quarters. When Gessner questions the order, McKinney strikes him sending him face down into the mud. He departs and McKinney begins to march the prisoners in the deep mud quickly finding that he is unable to keep up with the younger men in the harsh conditions. He orders the prisoners into formation, throws the ammunition clip from his rifle behind him, and tells the men they should run to escape. He then draws his service pistol and begins firing toward the men while shouting incoherently. "Sweetbread" Crane begins wandering toward the windmill and climbing it. McKinney scrambles for his clip, murmuring "help me" as he tries to load his rifle. All the while the prisoners plead with Sweetbread to return and explain to McKinney that he has a tendency to wander off and isn't trying to escape. Sweetbread climbs down from the windmill and begins moving toward McKinney. Bean leaps toward him to try to protect him from McKinney's rifle fire but Sweetbread is struck in the head. Bean removes his shirt to try to stop the bleeding as the other prisoners subdue McKinney but the wound is fatal.   It is revealed that the remainder of Bean's sentence has been commuted by the commanding officer. McKinney is court-martialed for the shooting of Crane and is represented by Captain Garcia. Stokes testifies against McKinney and whispers to Bean, as he leaves the witness stand, that they have McKinney "on the gallows." Garcia elicits from Bean the testimony that McKinney said "help me" as he was loading his weapon. He argues that it couldn't possibly have been a muttering to himself as Bean would not have heard it from his distance and that this was actually a call for the prisoners to assist him with Crane. This, he argues, constitutes a "warning shot" and that the killing was lawful. McKinney is presumably cleared, though it is never explicitly stated. Garcia confronts Bean after the proceedings smiling as he tells Bean that he had no choice but to tell the truth otherwise he would have committed perjury. He then assures Bean that he knows how he feels. Bean replies "No sir, you don't" before saluting and attempting to visit the prisoners. Lamar informs him that they don't want to meet with him though he leaves gifts which Lamar promises to convey.  Bean visits McKinney, who despite his acquittal is committed to the base psychiatric unit. McKinney sits motionless in his room in a state of undress and refuses to speak to Bean. When Bean attempts to initiate conversation, McKinney slowly turns in his chair to face away from him.   As Bean prepares to leave camp to ship to Vietnam to join his unit, he makes peace with Gessner and receives best wishes from Lamar as they march the prisoners. Webb breaks ranks and tosses the stolen lighter to Bean advising him to stick close to the brothers in Vietnam and they'll keep him safe. The prisoners then call the [[chain gang]] cadence that Sweetbread used to call, turning to face Bean in an apparent reconciliation. Bean tearfully joins in the movements and cadence while observing the formation before saluting the men and departing for Vietnam.

The theft is witnessed by [[Papa Smurf]], who emerges from a [[Smurfs]] comic book with the other Smurfs and alerts the other cartoon characters in the room ([[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] as a lamp, [[ALF: The Animated Series|Alf]] from a framed picture, [[Kermit the Frog|Baby Kermit]] as an alarm clock, [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]] as a doll, [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|Alvin]], [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|Simon]], and [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|Theodore]] from a record sleeve, and [[Slimer]] who passes through a wall).  The cartoon characters track down the thief and discover that it is Corey's older brother, Michael. [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|Simon]] opens a box under Michael's bed and identifies its contents as [[marijuana]]. Meanwhile, Corey expresses her concerns about Michael's change in behavior. He storms out of the house. The cartoon characters quickly realize that something must be done about his addiction and they set off, leaving Pooh behind to look after Corey.  At the [[Video arcade|arcade]], Michael smokes pot with his old "friends" and "Smoke", an [[anthropomorphic]] cloud of smoke. They tempt him to try [[crack cocaine|crack]]. However, before he does, they run out and are chased into an alley by a policeman, who is then revealed to be [[Bugs Bunny]] wearing a policeman's hat. He traps Smoke in a garbage can and uses a time machine he borrowed from [[Wile E. Coyote]] to see when and how Michael's addiction started. It turns out he became addicted to drugs through peer pressure by some older high school kids.  Meanwhile, at home, Michael's parents are concerned about his behavior, but Corey passes it off as nothing despite also being worried about him. Pooh then approaches and questions her about Michael, which she responds to by saying she doesn't want to get him into trouble. However, Pooh tries to reason with her.  Later, after Michael has returned to the present, he meets up with his "friends" and they decide they want to do some crack. He is hesitant, until one steals his wallet. He and Smoke chase after her, until they fall down a manhole and meet up with [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], who tells them that the drugs are messing up his brain, but they are not convinced. Michelangelo pulls a plug in the sewer water, and they soon find themselves on a roller coaster, where Baby Kermit, [[Miss Piggy|Baby Piggy]], and [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Baby Gonzo]] show him what has happened to his brain. He and Smoke try to get out, but the exit door is locked.  Fearing for his life, Michael calls for help. He is soon met by [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] who tell him that whenever anyone offers him drugs, he should just say no. Soon all the cartoon characters join in and sing ''There's a Million Wild and Wonderful Ways to Say No''.  Michael wakes up in his room, believing the whole thing to be nothing but a nightmare. Corey walks in and tries to talk to him, but he angrily yells at her while hurting her arm. He comes to his senses and tries to apologize, but she runs out frightened. Saddened, he looks at himself in a small mirror and is shocked to see Alf looking at him. Alf grabs him and pulls him into the mirror.  Inside a [[House of mirrors|Hall of Mirrors]], Alf shows Michael his reflection of how he is today, then this reflection if he does not stop taking drugs: an aged, corpse-like version of himself. When he insists that he could quit if he wants to and that he is in charge of his own life, Alf takes him to see the "man in charge". He is horrified to see that it is Smoke.  Later, Corey and Pooh go back into Michael's room and find his marijuana box. Smoke appears and throws Pooh inside a cabinet and starts tempting Corey into trying it. She reasons that if she does so, then maybe she and Michael could have fun together, like they used to before he started doing drugs.  Meanwhile, Michael finds himself running through a strange and frightening looking carnival, crying for help. He comes across a tent that reads "See Your Future". Inside, he finds [[Daffy Duck]] as a fortune teller. He looks into Daffy's crystal ball and is horrified to see himself as a pale, withering, corpse on a hospital bed. The cartoon characters return to convince him that he's great just the way he is without the drugs. He shouts, "How do I get out of here!" and a door magically appears.  Michael comes back into his room, just in time to stop Corey from using the drugs herself. He tells her that he never wants to see her end up like him, and admits he was wrong, though he is unsure if he can change. She advises him to talk about his problems to their parents and to her. Smoke tries to persuade him otherwise, but he throws him out the window, as he feels that he has "listened to him long enough." After falling in a garbage truck, Smoke vows to return saying that Michael "can bet on it!"; while Corey says that if he comes back, they'll "be prepared".   The special ends with Michael letting Pooh out of the cabinet to join the rest of the cartoon characters inside a poster on his wall. He and Corey go tell their parents about his drug problem.  
Catchfire
 Conceptual artist Anne Benton ([[Jodie Foster]]) creates electronic pieces that flash evocative statements, and her work has begun to attract major media attention.  Driving home one night, Anne suffers a blowout on a deserted road and, while looking for help, witnesses a mafia hit supervised by Leo Carelli ([[Joe Pesci]]). Leo spots Anne, but she escapes and goes to the police.  They offer her a place in the federal witness protection program, but mob boss Lino Avoca ([[Vincent Price]]), Carelli's boss, sends top-of-the-line hitman Milo ([[Dennis Hopper]]) and his partner Pinella ([[John Turturro]]) to silence her. Pinella kills her boyfriend Bob ([[Charlie Sheen]]), but she escapes.  Months pass; Anne has severed all ties with her past and re-established herself in Seattle as an advertising copywriter. Milo, who never gives up, recognizes the tagline of a lipstick ad as one of Anne's catchphrases, and tracks her down.  She flees again, to New Mexico, and he finds her again. But this time he offers her a deal: he'll let her live, if she'll do anything and everything he asks.  Milo's interest in Anne, it turns out, is more than professional, but not exactly what she thinks. He doesn't want her to be his sex slave, though sex is part of the equation.  A man obsessed, Milo has fallen in love with Anne. And he has no idea how to cope with the unfamiliar emotion. Astonishingly, after a rocky start, Anne realizes that she has also fallen for him.  By failing to kill Anne as he was hired to do, Milo has marked himself for death, and the two flee together to an isolated farm that Milo owns.  Avoca's men track them there, and they realize that in order to be free, they must return and confront their pursuers. They concoct a plan leaving Avoca, Carelli, and their men dead.  Anne and Milo escape together to a new life.  
Challenger (1990 film)
 In the film, NASA managers and [[Morton Thiokol]] engineers argue back and forth about whether the data Thiokol has is adequate to support the risk they claim. In a teleconference, Thiokol engineer Roger Boisjoly describes to the NASA team the soot from prior O-ring "blow-by" incidents on prior launches as "black", trying to communicate the severity of the malfunction, and says "it looked bad". A NASA director challenges him, asking "What does the black color mean?" Boisjoly, played by Boyle, is unable to put into words a concrete logical argument for what is to him obviously a serious problem, and he just replies with something like, "I'm telling you, if you'd seen it, you'd know it isn't good." The NASA manager demands proof before he will ground the shuttle, and the call ends leaving Boisjoly frustrated and baffled at their attitude. Unable to prove their case with certainty, Thiokol managers cave in to direct pressure and reverse their recommendation, finally recommending launch.  
A Cat in the Brain
  Haunted by his own bloody horror film visions and with news of real life murders happening in Rome, splatter [[film director]] Lucio Fulci (playing himself) seeks the advice of a [[psychiatrist]].<ref name="UK"/><ref name="SexGore"/>  Dr. [[Lucio Fulci]] (more or less playing himself) is a former medical doctor-turned director of gory horror films. He wraps up shooting for the day on his latest film 'Touch of Death' with Brett Halsey playing the human monster/cannibal of women. Fulci leaves the [[Cinecittà]] Studios for a local restaurant down the street. A young friendly waiter recognizes him and suggests his typical meal: a fillet of steak, or steak tartare. Fulci cannot look at the sample plates of meat without having flashbacks to the cannibalistic scene he'd been filming earlier. Shaken, he leaves the restaurant without ordering a meal. Later, while checking an effects shot from another movie, Fulci irritably snaps at a technician to get a plate of animal eyeballs out of his sight.  Returning home to his row house in an old suburb of Rome, the troubled director tries to sleep, but the noise of a handyman's chainsaw outside keeps him awake with recollections of his own recently shot chainsaw mayhem. In a rage, Fulci storms outside and smashes a hatchet into cans of paint belonging to the handyman. The spilled red paint reminds Fulci of the acid/blood scene in 'The Beyond'.  Fulci walks from his home and discovers that one of his neighbors is a psychiatrist. Meanwhile, Professor Egon Swharz (David L. Thompson) is arguing with his wife Katya (Melissa Lang). Their bitter routine row is interrupted by the intercom buzzing where his secretary Nurse Lilly (Judy Morrow) informing him of this latest walk-in. Professor Swharz walks in and accepts Fulci into his books for a session. After walking out of the reception area, Nurse Lilly immediately phones a friend saying "guess who just walked in as a patient!" Swhartz discusses Fulci's recent problems and suggests that he's "breaking down the barrier, the boundary between what you film and what's real."  The next day at Cinecittà, Fulci's producer Filippo (Shilett Angel) tells him that the pace has to be stepped up on filming. Fulci is revealed to making two films at the same time: 'The Touch of Death', and 'Ghosts of Sodom'. Robert Egon, the young actor playing the Nazi seducer in the later film, approaches Fulci in a corridor to discuss his role. "Your presence should make a deadly impression", says Fulci. "You are after all a symbol of death. And you've also the whole horror of the Nazis. Get me?" Fulci talks the actors through the seduction scene in 'Ghost of Sodom'. When the filming is done, Fulci staggers out into a corridor muttering, "Sadism, Nazism; is there any point any more?"  No sooner has Fulci left the set when his producer steers him into a studio suite for an interview with a Munich news crew. The sight of the tall, blond, German lady reporter's long legs triggers a vision of sexual abandon in Nazi Germany (from the film 'Ghosts of Sodom') When Fulci recovers from his vision, he finds himself outside again with his producer saying, "Lucio, you must stop! Stop, in the name of God!" Filippo informs the confused director that he has just run amuck, smashed the TV crews camera and tried to rip the interviewer's clothes off.  Professor Swharz calls Fulci for another consultation after he had watched all of his films. He suggests using hypnosis. Once Fulci is under, the Professor's true colors are revealed. He switches on a buzzer device and describes a mad scheme: "You'll do everything I tell you when you hear this sound. Your mind will make you live scenes you think are real. You will slowly be possessed by madness. You'll think you've committed terrible crimes." After the session is over, Fulci leaves unable to remember anything. Swharz then embarks on a killing spree, starting with the murder of a local prostitute that evening. Fulci arrives on the scene after the police show up and thinks he committed the murder. Running away, his car breaks down en route to a film location shoot. When he arrives at a cemetery where a nighttime Gothic scene is to be filmed, he finds that his assistant director, and Filippo his producer, have started filming without him.  Back home the following morning, Fulci tries to relax, but with each simple action, he is plagued by memories and visions of screen violence from his movies. Fleeing his house, he goes for a drive. But Swharz follows him and commits three more murders, first a couple in a remote boathouse, and the groundskeeper who witnesses him. Fulci arrives on the scene forcing Swharz to hide, and again Fulci thinks he committed the murders. Getting back into his car for a drive down a long country road, Fulci hallucinates about running over a tramp (from the movie 'Touch of Death'). After returning home, Fulci phones the police station to speak to his friend Inspector Gabrielli (Jeoffrey Kennedy) intending to make a "confession." But he learns that Gabrielli is on vacation.  After another visit to Professor Swharz is of little help to cure him of his waking nightmares, Fulci decides to drive over to Inspector Gabrielli's house in the hope of speaking to him. Swharz follows him there with the buzzer device. Fulci lets himself into his friend's house, and immediately suffers from visions of Gabrielle's family being stabbed, chainsawed, and decapitated. Fulci staggers outside to be greeted by the returning policeman, who reassures the flaky director that his family are safely on holiday in Sardinia. When Fulci expresses his visions to Gabrielli and that he may have killed some people, the cheerful police detective responds, "If you're trying to create a sensation like you do in your films, this time you've goofed."  Meanwhile, Professor Swharz can stand no more of his wife's bland contempt for him and his practice. So, the insane psychiatrist strangles her to death by ripping out a wire from his wife's piano and nearly decapitates her with it. Swharz then heads out again to tail Fulci, who under the influence of hypnosis again, suffers through one more blast of violent imagery and faints in the middle of a field. He comes round the next morning to discover a cat digging up the loosely buried remains of another Swharz victim. As Fulci scrapes soil from the dead features, Inspector Gabrielli appears behind him. Before Fulci can protest his innocence, Gabrielli informs him that Swharz has been shot dead by his men who were tailing Fulci which he ordered after their conversation the previous day, who caught the mad psychiatrist in the act.  Several months later, Fulci and the beautiful Nurse Lilly sail on his sailboat, 'Perversion' (named from his first thriller movie). Fulci looks furtively around and follows the young woman into the cabin-quarters. Suddenly, the sound of a chainsaw revs up, followed by her terrified screams. Fulci emerges from the cabin a minute later with a basket of her body parts and attaches the severed fingers onto fishing hooks which he casually casts into the water. Just when it appears that Fulci is really a crazed killer after all, it is revealed that this 'killing' is the very last shot of his newest film, 'Nightmare Concert', captured by a film crew sailing alongside. Bidding goodbye to his colleagues, Fulci happily sails out of the harbor with his very-much alive leading lady. (An alternate version features a bloodcurdling scream dubbed onto the soundtrack from below deck after Fulci and the girl sail away from the dock, hinting that Fulci really ''was'' a maniacal killer.)

Child's Play 2
 Two years after [[Child's Play (1988 film)|Chucky was destroyed by the Barclays and detective Mike Norris]], the killer "Good Guy" doll Chucky (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]) is rebuilt from scratch by the PlayPals company to prove there is no fault with the dolls. As a result of Andy Barclay ([[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]]) blaming Chucky for the murders committed, the company has suffered. One of the men working on Chucky is killed by electrocution; as a result, the CEO of the company Mr. Sullivan ([[Peter Haskell]]) orders his assistant Mattson ([[Greg Germann]]) to cover the accident and get rid of Chucky.  Meanwhile, Andy is now in [[foster care]], due to his mother being in a mental hospital for supporting his story about Chucky. Andy is adopted by Phil ([[Gerrit Graham]]) and Joanne Simpson ([[Jenny Agutter]]). In his new home, Andy meets his new foster sister Kyle ([[Christine Elise]]).  After work, Mattson goes to a corner store and while he leaves his car, Chucky uses the [[car phone]] to ring Grace Poole ([[Grace Zabriskie]]), the manager of Andy's foster center. He claims to be a relative of Andy's in order to get his new address. He then hijacks the car and orders Mattson to drive outside the Simpson household at gunpoint. Chucky then kills him [[Asphyxiation|by suffocating him with a plastic bag]]. In the house, Chucky accidentally activates "Tommy", another "Good-Guy" doll, and destroys him with Joanne's ornament. Chucky then buries the doll in the garden and takes his place as "Tommy". Phil punishes the children believing one of them broke the ornament. After Andy spends the rest of the day with Kyle, Chucky waits for nightfall and ties up Andy and gags him with socks in order to possess him, but the ritual is stopped by Kyle. After Andy claimed Chucky tied him up, Phil throws Chucky in the basement.  The following day, Chucky hitches a ride on the bus to Andy's new school. Andy's teacher Miss Kettlewell ([[Beth Grant]]) discovers an obscenity Chucky wrote on his worksheet. Believing Andy was responsible, she forces Andy to stay in the classroom as punishment and locks Chucky in the closet. Andy manages to escape, and Chucky beats Miss Kettlewell to death with a [[yardstick]]. After Andy insisted Chucky got him in trouble, Phil considers taking him back to the foster center.  Later that night, Andy tries to kill Chucky with an [[electric knife]] in the basement, but Chucky attacks him. Phil goes to investigate the commotion but Chucky trips and [[Cervical fracture|neck-snaps]] him, killing him. Joanne, convinced that Andy murdered Phil, sends him back to the foster center. Kyle discovers the buried doll in the garden and realizes Andy was telling the truth all along and rushes in to warn Joanne only to find her dead. Chucky attacks Kyle and orders her to take him to the center to find Andy. There, during a false fire alarm, Chucky kills Grace and orders Andy to take him to the PlayPals "Good-Guy" factory for the transfer.  Kyle follows Chucky and Andy to the factory. After knocking Andy unconscious, Chucky attempts the ritual to transfer his soul into Andy, but it fails midway since he spent too much time within the doll's body. Enraged, Chucky decides to kill both Andy and Kyle instead. He then loses one of his hands, which he replaces with his knife, but still goes after the two. Chucky murders a factory worker by slashing him in the cheek and causing toy eyeballs to go into his sockets. Kyle and Andy then put him into a machine and activate an emergency assembly, causing various arms and legs to go into his torso. Unfortunately Chucky escapes by cutting off his own waist. Kyle is knocked unconscious by the worker's corpse swinging on a crane. Chucky then starts crawling over to Andy and lunges at him, but his knife gets stuck in a radiator, and Andy then pours molten plastic all over him. Andy then saves Kyle by pulling her off of a conveyor belt, and shows her Chucky's melted body. Kyle thinks that the doll is dead, but Chucky jolts up and struggles with her, until she shoves a helium tube in his mouth, resulting in his head exploding. After Kyle and Andy escape the factory, Kyle tells them they're going home. Andy asks where that is, to which Kyle says she doesn't know.  An extended ending shows Chucky's severed eye being mixed into the plastic vat, which is followed by a new head being made. The head forms an evil smirk, and it is implied that Chucky has been brought back to life.

A Chinese Ghost Story II
 Following the events of the first film, Ning ([[Leslie Cheung]]) parts ways with the Taoist Yin ([[Wu Ma]]) and returns to his home village, which has since fallen on desperate times. Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel.  Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn ([[Jacky Cheung]]), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy ([[Joey Wong]]) and Moon ([[Michelle Reis]]) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu.  The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu ([[Waise Lee]]). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father.  Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk.  The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away.  The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with Ning.

In 1936, Jack McGurn is a [[motion picture]] [[projectionist]], involved in a campaign of harassment against non-[[Trade union|union]] theaters in [[New York City]].  One such attack turns fatal, as one of his fellow union members starts a fire.  McGurn's boss, knowing that the feelings of guilt would likely cause Jack to go to the police, urges him to leave the area.  Jack moves to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] where his brother Gerry lives.  Jack's role as a "[[sweatshop]] [[Labour law|lawyer]]" strains an already-rocky relationship with Gerry who is willing to have any job, barely keeping his family afloat during the [[Great Depression]].

Class of 1999
  Beginning narration states that in the early to late 1990s, violence in American high schools spiraled out of control, with areas in most major cities being taken over by youth gangs, resulting in some schools shutting down.  In 1999, special areas known as "free fire zones" have discouraged police from entering out of fear. Seattle's Kennedy High School is in the middle of a free fire zone, thus the Department of Education Defense (D.E.D.), a pilot special government agency, has been notified. Working with MegaTech head Dr. Bob Forrest, an experiment begins where three former military robots have become android [[Teacher|educators]]. Forrest introduces school coach Mr. Bryles, History teacher Mr. Hardin, and Chemistry teacher Ms. Connors to the Board of Education. Impressed with the new teachers, new principal Miles Langford has announced that former delinquents who are imprisoned will be released as part of the new experiment, which would allow new methods of discipline from the new teachers.  One such delinquent is Cody Culp, a member of the Blackhearts gang. Out of prison, Cody has decided to lay low and avoid any gang warfare, especially with the rivals Razorheads, led by Hector. After a car chase, Cody and his brothers Sonny and Angel make it to school. Sonny is taken in by the new school guards after he confronts them as they check the car for weapons or drugs. Blackheart member Curt, who thanks to Angel learns Cody no longer wants to be in a gang, informs Cody that if he is not with them, then he is against them. Still, Cody sticks to laying low and attends class. In chemistry class, Ms. Connors attempts calmly talk down Hector and another Razorhead. When the two Razorheads attempt to confront Ms. Connors, she uses fighting skills to take them down and make them sit in their seats. This pleases Forrest and MegaTech, who are in the basement, disguised as a DED control center. When Mr. Hardin's history class is interrupted by a fight between Curt and Razorhead member Flavio, Hardin resorts to using corporal punishment and puts the class in line. Returning home, Cody is shocked to find his brothers and his mother are addicted to the drug known as "edge". Upset and angry, he leaves and goes on his motorcycle, returning home later that night.  The next day, Flavio attempts to woo Christie, Mr. Langford's daughter, but when she resists his advances, he attempts to rape her. Cody, witnessing what is happening, fights off Flavio as well as Hector. Mr. Bryles, who sees the incident, puts Cody in a full nelson hold and takes him to the principal's office. While Langford informs Cody that he technically violated his parole with the fight, he lets him off due to the fact that he did save Christie from being raped. Cody and Bryles head to physical education class, where Bryles, who is the coach, humiliates Blackheart member Mohawk while doing push-ups. When class is over, Bryles tells Cody to stay behind and begins to viciously beat him. Mohawk goes to his locker and takes some "edge" and grabs a gun. Cody, still being beaten, is seriously hurt when Bryles sees Mohawk with the gun. Bryles grabs the gun and breaks Mohawk's neck, killing him instantly. MegaTech technicians Marv and Spence are in total shock when Forrest informs them that it was self-defense with a gun.  When Sonny shows up late to Mr. Hardin's class totally high on "edge", Hardin takes him to his locker. Hardin grabs the locker door and pulls it out to find vials of "edge" in the locker. He proceeds to take the vials and force them in Sonny's mouth and pummeling his head on the lockers. Hardin kills Sonny and upon his return to class, takes Sonny's now bloodied cross and puts it in his pocket. Cody sees the cross as Hardin gives his lecture. When Langford confronts the three teachers about the death of Sonny, it soon becomes a cover-up to say Sonny died of a drug overdose. When Christie tries to convince Cody based on her father's word about Sonny, Cody is angry and is convinced Hardin killed Sonny. Apologizing to Christie the next day, he tries to convince her that Hardin had something to do with Sonny's death and the duo skip school for evidence. Christie and Cody have the teacher directory and learn that Hardin, Bryles, and Connors live in the same apartment. They break in and Cody finds the bloody cross. However, the trio of teachers arrive and catch the duo escaping. A chase ensues and ends up with the trio in the water. Having survived the car crash in the water, the trio decide to start a war between the Razorheads and the Blackhearts.  That evening, Cody and Angel once again bond over a game of basketball. When Angel, who has become a Blackheart, decides to stay behind, he is met by Bryles, Hardin, and Connors on his way home later that night. The trio chase down Angel. Bryles lifts up Angel and throws him against a wall and the trio ultimately kill him. Shortly after, Razorhead Noser is coming out of a local pizza place when he sees Connors. She kidnaps him and when the Razorheads are waiting for Noser, Noser is sent through the window of their hangout while on fire. Hector is convinced the Blackhearts did it and decide to start a war. The next morning, Cody goes to the Blackheart hangout, where he finds a dead Angel surrounded by the likes of Curt, Reedy, and Dawn. Dawn finds Angel's basketball with a message written in blood. Cody, seething with revenge, decides he wants back in the gang.  That afternoon, a war ensues between the Razorheads and Blackhearts. However, Bryles, Hardin, and Connors intercept at various times, killing members from both gangs. When Cody and Reedy go inside an abandoned building to trap Hector, Hardin grabs Reedy through a wall and splits him in half with his bare hands. When Cody shoots at Hardin, he discovers he is not human. That night, Cody tries to tell the Blackhearts that Hardin was there and that he killed Reedy. Meanwhile, Langford has gotten wind of the situation and decides to have the program terminated. However, Dr. Forrest not only decides not to terminate the program, but tells Langford that the teachers must "kill the enemy". Bryles grabs Langford by the throat and with brute force, sticks his fingers in Langford's throat, killing him.  Hector receives a call apparently from Cody saying he wants him one-on-one at the school entrance. Connors, kidnapping Christie, pretends to be Hector and calls Cody with the same proposition. When Dawn wonders why Hector would meet him at the school, the Blackhearts are finally convinced that the teachers are responsible. When Hector and Cody show up with both gangs, Cody attempts to tell Hector that it is not him he wants to kill. He tells Hector of the war the teachers have started. To prove he is right, Cody shows Hector Sonny's bloody cross. The Razorheads and the Blackhearts decide to team up and take on the teachers, who are waiting in the school. While they look for Christie and the teachers, they soon learn of the real deal with the teachers. Ms. Connors' arm becomes a flame thrower. Bryles' arm becomes a missile launcher. While many Razorheads and Blackhearts fall victim to the teachers, Curt and Cody find Christie. There, they find Hardin. They attempt to shoot down Hardin. However, Hardin is too powerful as he grabs Cody with one hand and grabs Curt with his other hand, which has become a grip with a drill attached. Curt is killed by the drill. Hardin attempts to do the same to Cody when Cody reaches for a machine gun and shoots Hardin through the mouth numerous times, destroying him instantly.  Cody and Christie see Ms. Connors and are chased to the chemistry lab. Cody, noticing that Connors has an exposed area of flammable gas, distracts her in time to grab an axe. When he throws the axe at the exposed area, he and Christie run out of the lab. Connors, unleashing the flame thrower, fatally explodes due to the flame hitting the gas. Hector, the only other survivor alongside Cody and Christie, meet up with the duo and are seen by Bryles. Hector and Christie provide a distraction while Cody grabs a bus and is able to run down Bryles at the school entrance. The bus explodes but all three are safe. When they hear a noise in the school, they go check it out. However, a now half-human, half-robot Bryles escapes from under the bus.  Hector, Cody, and Christie find Dr. Forrest who takes Christie hostage. When Cody tells Forrest it is too late, Forrest is convinced that he can somehow continue the project. When Hector attempts to shoot Forrest, he is shot and killed. Forrest then attempts to kill Cody, but Bryles comes up from behind him and rips his heart out, killing him instantly. Cody and Christie are at first overpowered by Bryles until Cody finds a forklift and impales Bryles. Christie grabs the nearest chain and puts it around Bryles' neck with Cody using the forklift to lift the chain, decapitating the robotic Bryles. Cody and Christie, the only survivors, walk out of the badly damaged school in safety.

He is madly in love with his cousin, the beautiful Roxane; however, he does not believe she will requite his love because he considers himself physically unattractive, because of his overly large nose. Soon, he finds that Roxane has become infatuated with Christian de Neuvillette, a dashing new recruit to the [[Cadets de Gascogne]], the military unit in which Cyrano is serving. Christian however, despite his good looks, is tongue-tied when speaking with women. Seeing an opportunity to vicariously declare his love for Roxane, he decides to aid Christian, who does not know how to court a woman and gain her love.  Cyrano aids Christian, writing love letters and poems describing the very emotions that Cyrano himself feels for Roxane. Roxane begins to appreciate Christian, not only for his good looks but also his apparent eloquence. She eventually falls in love with him and they contract a [[secret marriage]] in order to thwart the plans of the Comte de Guiche, an arrogant nobleman who is himself a frustrated wooer of Roxane. In revenge, De Guiche summons Christian to fight in the war against the [[Spain|Spanish]]. The war is harsh and brutal: the Cadets de Gascogne are starving. Cyrano escapes over enemy lines each morning to deliver a love letter written by Cyrano himself but signed with Christian's name, sent to Roxane.

However, during the battle that follows Roxane's visit, Christian is wounded and dies in battle. As he lies dying, Cyrano tells him that he asked Roxane and it was Christian she loved, but he actually has done no such thing. Cyrano fights off the attackers and the French win.  Cyrano keeps his love for Roxane a secret for fourteen years, during which time he becomes unpopular because of his writings satirising the nobility. Roxane, grief-stricken, enters a convent. For fourteen years, Cyrano faithfully visits Roxane at her [[convent]] every week, never late until a fateful attempt on his life leaves him mortally injured. (He is not wounded by a sword, but instead suffers a serious head injury when struck by a heavy wooden beam.)  One evening, against doctor's orders, Cyrano visits Roxane at the convent. Although he faints while telling her the court news, he dismisses it as the effect of his wound at Arras. When she mentions Christian's last letter, he asks to read it, but after she gives it to him, he instead is forced to recite it from memory, as it is now too dark for him to be able to read it. Only then does Roxane realise that it was Cyrano who wooed her under the balcony and wrote the love letters. After fainting again, he is forced to reveal his mortal wound to her. As Cyrano dies, Roxane realises that it was he, and not Christian, whom she had really loved all along.

Dances with Wolves
  In 1863, First Lieutenant John J. Dunbar is wounded in battle at St. David's Field in Tennessee. Choosing death in battle over amputation of his leg, he takes a horse and rides up to and along the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] lines. Despite numerous pot shots, the Confederates fail to hit him, and while they are distracted, the [[Union Army]] successfully attacks the line. Dunbar survives, receives a citation for bravery, and proper medical care. He recovers fully and is awarded Cisco, the horse who carried him, and his choice of posting. Dunbar requests a transfer to the western frontier so he can see it before it disappears.  Dunbar is transferred to [[Fort Hays]], a large fort presided over by Major Fambrough, an unhinged officer who despises Dunbar's enthusiasm.  He agrees to post him to the furthest outpost they have, Fort Sedgewick, and kills himself shortly afterwards. Dunbar travels with Timmons, a mule wagon provisioner; they arrive to find the fort deserted. Despite the threat of nearby native tribes, Dunbar elects to stay and man the post himself. He begins rebuilding and restocking the fort, and prefers the solitude, recording many of his observations in his diary. Timmons is killed by [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] people on the journey back to Ft. Hays; his death, together with that of the major who had sent them there, prevents other soldiers from knowing of Dunbar's assignment, and no other soldiers arrive to reinforce the post.  Dunbar initially encounters his [[Sioux]] neighbors when attempts are made to steal his horse and intimidate him. Deciding that being a target is a poor prospect, he decides to seek out the Sioux camp and attempt dialogue. On his way, he comes across Stands With A Fist, the white adopted daughter of the tribe's medicine man Kicking Bird, who is ritually mutilating herself while mourning for her husband. Dunbar brings her back to the Sioux to recover, and some of the tribe begin to respect him. Eventually, Dunbar establishes a rapport with Kicking Bird, the warrior Wind In His Hair and the youth Smiles A Lot, initially visiting each other's camps. The language barrier frustrates them, and Stands With A Fist acts as an interpreter, although with difficulty; she only remembers English from her early childhood before the rest of her family was killed during a Pawnee raid.  Dunbar discovers that the stories he had heard about the tribe were untrue, and he develops a growing respect and appreciation for their lifestyle and culture. Learning their language, he is accepted as an honored guest by the Sioux after he tells them of a migrating herd of buffalo and participates in the hunt. When at Fort Sedgewick, Dunbar also befriends a wolf he dubs "Two Socks" for its white forepaws. Observing Dunbar and Two Socks chasing each other, the Sioux give him the name "Dances With Wolves." During this time, Dunbar also forges a romantic relationship with Stands With A Fist and helps defend the village from an attack by the rival Pawnee tribe. Dunbar eventually wins Kicking Bird's approval to marry Stands With A Fist, and abandons Fort Sedgewick.  Because of the growing Pawnee and white threat, Chief Ten Bears decides to move the tribe to its winter camp. Dunbar decides to accompany them but must first retrieve his diary from Fort Sedgewick as he realizes that it would provide the army with the means to find the tribe. However, when he arrives he finds the fort reoccupied by the U.S. Army. Because of his Sioux clothing, the soldiers open fire, killing Cisco and capturing Dunbar, arresting him as a traitor. Two officers interrogate him, but Dunbar cannot prove his story, as a corporal has found his diary and kept it for himself. Having refused to serve as an interpreter to the tribes, Dunbar is charged with desertion and transported back east as a prisoner. Soldiers of the escort shoot Two Socks when the wolf attempts to follow Dunbar, despite Dunbar's attempts to intervene.  Eventually, the Sioux track the convoy, killing the soldiers, and freeing Dunbar. They assert that they do not see him as a white man, but as a Sioux warrior called Dances With Wolves. But, at the winter camp, Dunbar decides to leave with Stands With A Fist because his continuing presence would endanger the tribe. As they leave, Smiles A Lot returns the diary, which he recovered during Dunbar's liberation, and Wind In His Hair shouts to Dunbar, reminding him that he is Dunbar's friend, a contrast to their original meeting where he shouted at Dunbar in hostility. U.S. troops are seen searching the mountains, but are unable to locate them, while a lone wolf howls in the distance. An epilogue states that thirteen years later, the last remnants of the free Sioux were subjugated to the American government, ending the conquest of the Western frontier states and the livelihoods of the tribes on the [[Great Plains]].

Linda is having major doubts about getting married, when both groups arrive at a club, to find the band fronted by her ex-boyfriend—and the love of her life—Peter.

Daddy's Dyin': Who's Got the Will?
 Buford Turnover ([[Bert Remsen]]) is suffering from advanced dementia, and it's only a matter of time before he dies.  Told by Buford's mother-in-law Loyce ([[Molly McClure]]) ('Mama Wheelis' to her grandchildren) that their father is dying, his four adult children arrive at the family's homestead to spend time with their father during his last days.  It's a mixed bag of personalities:  Lurlene ([[Amy Wright]]), the eldest sister, a minister's wife who rarely visits the rest of the family; Sara Lee ([[Tess Harper]]), the spinsterish middle sister who cares for her father with the help of her grandmother; Orville ([[Beau Bridges]]), the greedy, abusive brother, and his wife, Marlene ([[Patrika Darbo]]); and the youngest sibling Evalita ([[Beverly D'Angelo]]), the six-times married aspiring country singer, who brings her hippie boyfriend Harmony ([[Judge Reinhold]]).  All arrive at the Turnover homestead, and personalities clash.    Eldest sister Lurlene irritates her siblings as she tries to take control of the situation, causing resentment by acting too much like their deceased mother Linnie Sue (Carolyn Brooks). She is a bit estranged from the rest of the family, having only returned to the homestead every few years since she married and moved away, leaving her father to try to run the farm alone. For this reason, Lurlene suspects that she has been cut out of the will. However, Lurlene has few altercations with her siblings and tries to keep the peace among them.  Sara Lee also tries to act as peacemaker, until Evalita has a drunken night at the bar with Clarence ([[Keith Carradine]]), to whom Sara Lee is engaged (though it is later revealed to the audience that the two had broken up at some prior point). Evalita implies that she and Clarence had slept together, though Clarence denies the event.    Orville frequently verbally abuses Marlene, often criticizing her weight and parenting skills. (The couple have one son, Jimbo, whom Orville sent to reform school after catching him smoking marijuana and huffing gasoline.) Orville is rarely seen without a beer in his hand. Marlene is preoccupied with her weight and is quite unhappy with her husband and life. She and her sisters-in-law and grandmother-in-law get along very well, and Marlene quickly forms a close bond with Harmony as well.  Evalita is constantly drunk and makes her family uncomfortable during very public displays of affection with Harmony. She spends most of her time not at home with her dying father, but at the local bar, singing. On one occasion, she forgets her own age.  Harmony is initially distrusted by the family, but eventually manages to win the family over (except Orville) when he demonstrates his piano playing ability by playing "I'll Fly Away" on the family piano. As everybody gathers together to sing along, Buford hears the music and rises from his bed, watching his grown son and daughters sing. He sees them as small children, singing with their mother.    When Harmony and Marlene secretly share a joint, he tells her that he is falling in love with her, and asks her to run away with him. She refuses, but they end up kissing in the kitchen and nearly get caught by Orville.   Eventually, Mama Wheelis remembers that Buford kept his will in a strong box buried in the yard. Harmony helps open the box by picking the lock, telling the family that he had once served time in prison for burglary. Evalita, again drunk, berates him for this and Harmony leaves. The will is read, and though all the siblings had been forgiven by their father in an earlier scene, the will hadn't been changed and Lurlene and Orville each receive only $1 of the $600,000 estate. Jimbo receives what would have been his father's share in the estate. Sara Lee offers to share her inheritance with Orville and Lurlene, but Evalita refuses to give up any of hers.   Harmony returns to tell Evalita that he has thrown her belongings out of his van, and that he is going back to California. Marlene quickly grabs her suitcase and leaves with Harmony.  Buford eventually dies, and the family converges in the living room for the funeral. They begin to practice the song they will sing at the funeral, and an image of Buford can be seen, watching. Again, he sees his adult children as young children.  In their newfound peace, the will is temporarily forgotten.

 In the near future, a maintenance vehicle is orbiting the Earth on a mission to repair nuclear-armed satellites. Suddenly, the crew experiences a mysterious, inexplicable power failure that cannot be accounted for. As the ship grows colder, they find themselves drifting toward the dark side of the Moon. An old NASA shuttle, the ''Discovery'', drifts toward them, although NASA has not been operating for 30 years. Two of the crew members board the ship and find a dead body. The mission records of the crew's own ship indicate that the shuttle they have found disappeared in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] many years before. So what is it doing in space? As they attempt to solve this mystery, it quickly becomes apparent that a malevolent force has been waiting on the NASA shuttle, using the aforesaid dead body as its host and it now begins to stalk the crew members one at a time.  
Dark River (1990 film)
 On the banks of a river flowing through the lowlands of Africa, the British have set up a colony without the constraints of European civilization. Into this tight-knit community a stranger (Deacon) strays, refusing to abide by its self-serving code. He is immediately set at odds with the locals: a businessman (K B Priestley) who employs his authority in the community to disguise his personal weaknesses, his daughter (Lydia) who uses the men in the community as rungs in her climb out of provincialism; a sour, manipulative club barman (Yorkie); a widow and cocoa heiress (Mrs Blessington) who plays puppet-master from a distance; hero of the bars (Oliver) with his dubious investment schemes, sardonic [[gossip columnist]] Jane Audeby, and club waiter Elias who becomes his most candid counsellor.  Deacon's big mistake is to write and publish a novel which draws on their weaknesses. The novel becomes a success back home, causing problems for its author. Before sunrise one morning a boat sets sail upriver. In it are [[First Secretary]] Hugo Shrike and Deacon, who has made a rendezvous somewhere on the banks with the person he has vowed to destroy. By nightfall the community will number one person fewer. Dark River invites the viewer to share the vantage point of Deacon as he is cheated, manipulated, seduced and misled in a series of long, no-holds-barred speeches directly to camera, while all the while the river winds its way round the protagonists like a strangling ivy.

He is conflicted about his feelings about his adoptive mother, a former prostitute played by [[Rebecca Pan]], and is obsessed about his biological mother, who he eventually discovers is a Filipino aristocrat.  
Days of Thunder
  Cole Trickle is a young racer from [[Eagle Rock, California]], with years of experience in [[Open wheel car|open-wheel racing]], winning championships in the [[United States Auto Club]] (USAC). His goal was to win the [[Indianapolis 500]], but realizes that "To win in [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indy]] I'd need a great car, but stock cars are all the same". He is recruited by [[Chevrolet]] dealership tycoon Tim Daland to race for his team in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Series]]. Daland also convinces former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge to come out of retirement and lead Cole's pit crew. After Trickle sets a fast time in a private test at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]], Hogge builds him a new [[Chevrolet Lumina]] to drive in the Winston Cup, though the season has already started.  During his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns; this results in Cole not finishing the races, mostly due to crashes and blown engines. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams, Harry puts him through rigorous training. This pays off at the [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]] race, when Cole uses a [[Drafting (aerodynamics)#Stock car racing|slingshot maneuver]] from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race.  The rivalry between Cole and Rowdy intensifies throughout the season until tragedy strikes. At the [[Coke Zero Sugar 400|Firecracker 400]] in [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], both drivers are seriously injured after being caught in "[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]". While recovering from his injuries in Daytona Beach, Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki, a [[Neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] at Halifax Hospital who was senior doctor on duty when he was brought in after his crash and who was attending to his health. At the same time, NASCAR president Big John brings Rowdy and Cole together in a meeting and warns them that he and his sport will no longer tolerate any hanky-panky from the two rivals. Afterwards, Cole and Rowdy go out to lunch together by Big John's persuasion, and settle their differences by banging rental cars on the beach. Cole and Rowdy change from bitter rivals to close friends.  As Cole is still undergoing therapy, Daland hires hot-shot rookie Russ Wheeler as a substitute to fill the seat. Weeks later, Cole returns to active duty, with Daland now fielding two teams&nbsp;– the second car driven by Wheeler which Harry disapproves of. Though Cole shows signs of his old self, he now finds himself in a rivalry with his new teammate with no help from his inexperienced owner. At [[North Wilkesboro Speedway|North Wilkesboro]], Russ blocks Cole's path during their pit stop. He also forces Cole into the outside wall on the last lap to win the race. In retaliation, Cole crashes his car into Russ's car following the race, resulting in Daland firing Cole and Harry.  When Rowdy discovers that he has to undergo brain surgery to fix a broken blood vessel, he asks Cole to drive his car at the [[Daytona 500]], so his sponsors will pay for the year. Cole reluctantly agrees and convinces Harry to return as crew chief again. Hours prior to the race, Harry discovers metal in the oil pan, a sign of engine failure, so he manages to have Daland provide him a new engine. During the race, Cole's car suffers a malfunctioning transmission after being spun out by Russ, but the combined efforts of his pit crew, as well as those working for Daland, manage to fix the problem and get him back on the lead lap. This sets the tone for a final showdown between Cole and Russ. On the final lap, Russ predicts that Cole will attempt his signature slingshot maneuver from outside, but Cole tricks him with a crossover, overtaking him from the inside to win his first Daytona 500.  Cole drives into victory lane, where he and his pit crew celebrate with Claire. As he looks around to see where Harry is, he spots him sitting alone on a concrete barrier near the teams pit stall. Cole walks up to Harry to ask for him to say something, but Harry is lost for words. Cole asks Harry to walk with him and Harry agrees. As he begins to walk, Harry turns to Cole smiling and challenges him to a foot race to victory lane.  
Darkman
 Dr. [[Darkman (character)|Peyton Westlake]] is developing a new type of synthetic skin to help burn victims, but cannot get past a flaw that causes the skin to rapidly disintegrate after 99 minutes. His girlfriend, attorney Julie Hastings, discovers the Bellasarious Memorandum, an incriminating document that proves developer Louis Strack Jr. has been bribing members of the zoning commission. When she confronts Strack, he confesses, showing Julie that he plans to design a brand new city, creating a substantial number of new jobs. He warns Julie that mobster Robert Durant also wants the document.  At Westlake's lab, Westlake and his assistant Yakatito are testing the skin when the lights go out. The synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes; Westlake deduces the skin is photosensitive. Their joy is short lived as Durant and his men show up and demand the Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. They search for the document, and Durant has his men kill Yakatito and beat Westlake, burning his hands and dipping his face in acid. After finding the document, they rig the lab to explode; it does so as Julie watches. The blast throws a hideously burned Westlake through the roof and into the river. As a John Doe, he is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the [[spinothalamic tract]]; physical pain is no longer felt at the cost of tactile sensation. This loss of sensory input gives him [[enhanced strength]] due to [[Adrenaline|adrenal]] overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but also mentally destabilizes him.  Believed dead by Julie, Westlake re-establishes his lab in a condemned building and begins a long process of digitization to create a mask of his original face. Westlake uses the time to plot revenge against Durant and his men; he kills Durant's henchman Rick after forcing him to reveal the identities of the other men, then studies them to subdue and impersonate them. When his face mask is complete, Westlake manages to convince Julie that he was in a coma rather than dead. He mentions that he is aware of Julie seeing Strack after his supposed death; she responds that Strack only comforted her. Keeping his disfigurement from her, Westlake instead probes whether or not she would accept him, regardless of his appearance.  Westlake sows dissension and confusion among Durant’s henchmen by assuming their identities. On a date at a carnival with Julie, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper, revealing to Julie that something is wrong with him. He flees as his face begins to melt, and she follows him, discovering the discarded mask; she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him before discovering the stolen Memorandum on his desk, confirming he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.  Durant intercepts Julie, kidnapping her before attacking Westlake's lair. Two of his men enter the lab to locate and kill Westlake, but are outmaneuvered and eliminated. Durant flees in a helicopter with Westlake dangling from an attached cable, which he uses to crash the helicopter. Impersonating Durant, Westlake meets up with Strack and a captive Julie at the top of an unfinished building. Westlake's ruse is broken by Strack and they fight; Westlake eventually gains the upper hand and dangles Strack by his ankle in the air. Strack says that killing him would not be something he could live with; Westlake drops Strack, remarking: "I'm learning to live with a lot of things." Julie tries to convince Westlake that he can still return to his old life, but he tells her he has changed on the inside as well, and cannot subject anyone to his new, vicious nature. He rushes from Julie as they exit an elevator, pulling on a mask and running into a crowd of pedestrians. As Julie unsuccessfully searches for him, Westlake narrates, "I am everyone and no one. Everywhere. Nowhere. Call me... Darkman."  
Death in Brunswick
 Set and filmed in [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], a Melbourne suburb,  it deals with a humble chef, Carl ([[Sam Neill|Neill]]) who gets a job at a sleazy nightclub owned by Yanni Voulgaris ([[Nicholas Papademetriou]]).  He begins a relationship with the Greek-Australian barmaid, Sophie ([[Zoe Carides]]), which soon brings him into trouble with his employers and her strict father. His drug dealing Turkish-Australian co-worker, Mustafa (Nick Lathouris), is beaten up by the Greek-Australian owners.  Thinking Carl told them, Mustafa attacks Carl.  Carl accidentally stabs and kills him.  He calls his friend, Dave ([[John Clarke (satirist)|Clarke]]), a grave digger, and they bury Mustafa. This leads to one of the most famous scenes in the film—Dave's idea that they bury the body in the opened grave of someone else whose husband will be buried above her the following day. Dave expects the coffin of the deceased to be comparatively empty, given how long it has been since she died. When he finds that the rate of decomposition is not what he expects, he begins to stomp and crush her body to make some room.  Later, Mustafa's wife and son come to the restaurant and ask Carl if they know what happened to Mustafa. Carl denies having any knowledge and is wracked with guilt.  He gives Mustafa's pay to his wife, even though Dave tells him that it might make him suspect.  Later Mustafa's son sees him at a [[Brunswick Baths|pool]]<ref name="The Sydney Morning Herald - 28 June 2013 - Shoot! What a great place to film the end of the Earth"></ref> with Sophie.  Knowing that Sophie is also having a relationship with one of the Greek owners, Mustafa's Turkish friends confront Carl.  Believing the Greek owners to be responsible, they get their revenge on them, ironically killing the one who was originally responsible for beating Mustafa in the first place.  Carl leaves his job and is later comforted when he sees Mustafa in the church (albeit, in a dream) who offers him a friendly handshake. After his domineering mother suffers a stroke and is left a quadriplegic, Carl marries Sophie, despite her father's protests and the final scene from their wedding is reminiscent of the [[Last Supper]].  
The Death of the Incredible Hulk
 David Banner ([[Bill Bixby]]) masquerades as David Bellamy, a mentally challenged janitor, to gain access to a scientific research facility in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He believes that the studies of one of the scientists there, Dr. Ronald Pratt (Philip Sterling), may hold the key to curing his [[gamma ray|gamma]]-induced condition that, in times of stress, turns him into a superhuman green creature known as the Hulk.  One night after making a transaction at the bank, David is trapped by street thieves and is beaten and robbed. The stress of his injuries induces another transformation. The Hulk makes short work of the criminals but attracts the attention of authorities before escaping.  The next day, bypassing security, Banner enters Pratt's laboratory and examines the formula on his blackboard, making corrections. At the same time, a Russian spy named Jasmin ([[Elizabeth Gracen]]), thinking she has completed her last act of espionage, is approached by former superior Kasha for one last job: infiltrate Pratt's lab and steal the files on his experiments. When she refuses, Kasha blackmails Jasmin with her sister Bella's life. Jasmin then disguises herself and obtains a [[fingerprint]] from one of the security guards.  The following morning, Pratt examines the formula on his blackboard and discovers that it is now correct. Determined to find out who is guiding him, he hides in the lab in wait for his secret helper. He catches David in the act and asks him to tell him something that would keep him from sounding the security alarm. Banner reveals his true identity and recounts the events that led to his [[self-experimentation]] that resulted in the Hulk. He notes that his condition also dives into Pratt's own research on a human's capacity to heal, for in Hulk-form David's accelerated [[metabolism]] allows any wound to close in seconds, leaving him with hardly a scar.   Pratt believes he can cure David, but he needs to first study the creature. Over the course of a week, both scientists, with the help of Pratt's scientist wife Amy ([[Barbara Tarbuck]]), construct a [[Force field (fiction)|force field]] cage and sensors to track Banner's vitals. On the night of the observation, David is rigged with a [[tranquilizer]] to sedate him once the readings have been recorded. Banner shocks himself with an electrical rod and transforms into the Hulk. The energy cage restrains the Hulk until Pratt has his readings, and Amy activates the tranquilizer. Banner reverts to normal, and Pratt and Amy photograph the closing puncture wound from the tranquilizer. Banner later watches the video of his transformation&nbsp;– claiming it is the first time he has seen the Hulk&nbsp;– and fails to see any humanity in him despite Amy's beliefs.  The next day, the facility's board announces to Pratt that they are pulling his funding for his lack of results, which forces him to move up his proposed cure for David. An eastern European spy network dedicated to using Pratt's (and Banner's) work for corrupt purposes breaks into the lab, halting the experiment and kidnapping the Pratts. Banner has fallen in love with Jasmin, who returns his affections, and with her help, he rushes to the Pratts' aid.   While pursuing the kidnappers, Banner and Jasmin learn that her sister, Bella ([[Anna Katarina]]), is the true leader of the spy network, and Banner turns into the Hulk, who tries to protect Pratt and Jasmin. The Hulk runs towards the plane, on which Bella and Zed are attempting to escape, and breaks it open. He climbs aboard before takeoff. Bella tries to shoot the Hulk, but he directs the firing below the plane, hitting its fuel tank. As a result, the plane explodes, and the Hulk is thrown into the night, falling onto the concrete. After one last return transformation, Banner dies, telling Jasmin he is free. The film ends with Jasmin, Pratt, and Amy mourning Banner's death.

In the penitentiary, Burke is forced to survive in a dismal and dangerous environment. Even though he is surrounded by hostility and suspicion, Burke succeeds in befriending a few of the inmates, including his cellmate Konefke ([[Conrad Dunn]]), Hawkins ([[Robert Guillaume]]) and Priest (Abdul Salaam El Razzac), who help him with the investigation. It is later revealed that the prisoners are being murdered for their body organs.  Meanwhile, more inmates are mysteriously murdered with one being set on fire in his own cell for giving Burke information about the murders and also Konefke is killed, and stone-faced prison guard DeGraff ([[Art LaFleur]]) puts Burke in solitary confinement, where he's interrogated and beaten. Burke is then released upon a visit from Beckett, the two are taken to a trailer for a private discussion but end up having sex. Afterwards, back in the prison Burke inquires about the sudden interest his fellow prisoners are taking in one particular new prisoner who is entering the grounds. Much to Burke's surprise it turns out to be The Sandman and surprise turns to horror as the Sandman knows that Burke is really a cop. The Sandman then kidnaps Burke and tortures him and then reveals to the prisoners and the guards that he is really a cop, turning the whole prison against him, and his fight for survival begins.  Beckett attends a party hosted by Tom Vogler ([[George Dickerson]]), the state's attorney general. Just as she's preparing to tell him about the murders at the prison, who she believes Ben Keane ([[Jack Bannon]]) is responsible, she then receives a call from Tisdale ([[Joshua John Miller]]), Burke's adolescent computer hacker assistant who has been helping Beckett gain information from the prison files, who identifies Vogler as the man behind the murders, which also involve Dr. Gottesman ([[Armin Shimerman]]), the prison doctor and surgeon who harvests the organs to be sold to people who are in desperate need of them.  The assistant's suspicions are confirmed when Vogler then explains his motives and also reveals he had The Sandman transferred to the prison to kill Burke. Volger then tries to kill Beckett. She escapes only by the grace of Vogler's wife Helen entering the room, but not before saying to him, "Tell her how you murdered for her", as Helen was a recipient of a liver harvested from his business.  Burke begins an escape from the penitentiary, pursued by DeGraff, the Sandman and hundreds of angry inmates, Gottesman is cornered by the inmates, while DeGraff tries to finish off Hawkins, only to be shot from behind by Priest. During the escape, Priest is killed by the Sandman.  Burke and the Sandman have a final, brutal showdown. The Sandman uses brutal force to watch Burke suffer. Burke gets the upper hand and kicks The Sandman into a lit furnace, but he survives with minor burns. Then Burke kicks the Sandman again and impales his head onto a spike, Sandman taunts him by saying he cannot be killed. Burke grabs his jaw and pushes it further into the spike killing him. Burke leaves and then the inmates allow him to pass and respect him for his brave act. Burke is greeted by Beckett, along with Hawkins who is taken to hospital via ambulance due to a gunshot wound.

Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection
 Ramon Cota ([[Billy Drago]]) is a wealthy and powerful drug kingpin who controls the [[cocaine]] industry with an iron fist. His drugs pour steadily into [[United States|America]], corrupting the country's youth and causing a feud between the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and San Carlos, Cota's country of origin.  The film opens during a carnival in [[Rio de Janeiro]], as an undercover task force led by several DEA agents conducts surveillance on a private party that Cota is attending (similar to a [[Mardi Gras]] ball); however, the surveillance team is ambushed and massacred by Cota's hitmen, who are masquerading as carnival performers. Due to the Rio fiasco, The DEA enlists the support of the U.S. Army's Delta Force in order to infiltrate San Carlos. They are aided by an undercover agent within Cota's drug cartel.  General Taylor orders Colonel Scott McCoy ([[Chuck Norris]]) and his partner, Major Bobby Chavez ([[Paul Perri]]) to bring Cota to court. They pose as airline passengers while Cota is en route to Geneva to deposit his drug money in a Swiss bank account, and are able to capture him during a short interval in which the plane enters U.S. airspace. However, their efforts amount to nothing as Cota is easily able to post bail and escape. Unable to contain his rage, Chavez furiously lashes out at Cota in court. Cota decides to strike at Chavez by having Chavez's pregnant wife and 13-year-old brother killed.   Out on a personal mission of vengeance, Chavez is captured by Cota's forces and is tortured and killed. When three DEA agents attempt to go in and bring Cota and his army down, they are taken hostage, and are to be executed. During a press conference, a spokesman for the DEA explains that San Carlos's president Alcazar fears a coup and is therefore reluctant to crack down on the cartels, while his corrupt generals benefit from the drug trade and are willing to protect Cota from extradition.  McCoy is parachuted into San Carlos and sent to rescue the hostages in a stealth operation, while Taylor and the rest of the Delta Force perform surveillance. Their mission is supervised by a delegate from the government of San Carlos, which has entered an agreement with the U.S. government that severely limits the scope of the mission. Meanwhile, McCoy scales a tall cliff and infiltrates Cota's mansion.  Later, the government of San Carlos attempts to cancel the U.S. intervention outright by staging a massive drug raid that would make the American mission unnecessary. Upon learning of the hoax, Taylor breaks protocol and heads south of his perimeter in a heavily armed gunship, prompting the San Carlos army to send their own choppers in pursuit. The chopper lands at Cota's mansion and deploys troops to destroy cocaine storehouses and laboratories. McCoy succeeds in releasing the hostages, but is captured by Cota and placed in a chamber filled with toxic gas and isolated by a glass pane. Before the gas can kill him, however, a rocket from Taylor's gunship shatters the glass, allowing him to break through.  With the help of DEA Agent Page, McCoy captures Cota in his own armored limousine and flees the mansion. Cota's bodyguards and a San Carlos attack helicopter pursue the vehicle and eventually bring it to a halt, but Taylor's gunship saves them. Cota flees on foot through the jungle during the fighting. After the drug lord kills a villager who wanted revenge for the murder of her family, McCoy arrives and beats him. Cota then tries to goad McCoy into killing him, knowing he is wanted alive.  Taylor's helicopter arrives to pick up McCoy and his prisoner with ropes, as the last few of Cota's men close in. One of them swings his machete but only manages to partially cut Cota's rope before the helicopter heads out to sea to join the American carrier fleet. Hanging beneath the chopper, Cota continues to goad McCoy about his invulnerability, saying that once in court he will walk free again. However, the rope grows thinner from the machete cut, until it snaps completely. The film ends with Cota falling thousands of feet to his death.

Dekalog: Nine
 Dr. Roman Nycz (Piotr Machalica) has been diagnosed with impotence. His friend and colleague confirms the prognosis, suggesting that he should divorce his attractive young wife, Hanka ([[Ewa Błaszczyk]]), a stewardess for KLM. After discussing the diagnosis, it becomes clear that the couple is in love and do not want to lose each other. Hanka offers that there are more important things in a relationship between two people than sex and that she will manage to live without it. Roman, although guarded and hurt, says that he would not begrudge her decision to find another lover if she does not already have one. She halfheartedly refuses and asks that they refrain from discussing the situation at length.   Roman is teased by an attractive young singer who must undergo heart surgery. Earlier that morning he notices a young man around his building who at the sight of him walks away and disappears. He becomes suspicious and bugs his own phone to eavesdrop on Hanka. He finds out that she is indeed sleeping with the young man, Mariusz (Jan Jankowski), a physicist with whom she has a purely physical relationship. Their trysts happen at her mother's house. One day, Hanka forgets some items that her mother wanted from her house and asks Roman to retrieve them for her; while in the house he snoops around and finds a notebook belonging to Mariusz that he had earlier found in his car. He makes a copy of Hanka's key and clandestinely listens to his wife's affair from the stairwell of her mother's house.  Amid escalating tension and guilt at home, Hanka resolves to end her relationship with Mariusz and meets him at her mother's house to break things off. After Mariusz leaves, she discovers Roman hidden in the closet and learns that he saw everything and has been fully aware of her infidelity. Seeing that he is more shaken and hurt than she imagined, Hanka tries to console Roman and agrees that they should discuss their issues at length. The doorbell rings, Mariusz has returned to the house. He says that he loves Hanka and would marry her if she were to divorce Roman. Saying nothing, Hanka simply closes the door on Mariusz. Hanka sees how much she has hurt Roman. She asks him to hold her, but Roman says that he cannot. Hanka is now more resolute about being faithful and seeking a child for adoption (initially they had half-heartedly discussed adoption as a way to make their intimacy problems more manageable.)  At Roman's suggestion that the couple take a break, Hanka goes on a skiing trip alone to [[Zakopane]], unaware that Mariusz has followed her there. Roman spots Mariusz loading his skiing gear onto his car and calls his house posing as a classmate of Mariusz. His mother confirms that Mariusz has left for a skiing trip to Zakopane. Jumping to the conclusion that Hanka and Mariusz must be continuing their affair, Roman leaves a note for Hanka at his flat. When Hanka realizes that Mariusz has followed her, she rushes to return to Warsaw. Meanwhile, Roman attempts suicide by riding his bicycle off of a bridge. Hanka returns to the flat and is distraught upon finding Roman's suicide note. Roman, despite sustaining head injuries of ambiguous severity and being placed into a body cast, is eventually told by hospital staff that Hanka had called the hospital earlier in the day to say that she would be returning from Zakopane immediately. After asking a nurse to dial his apartment, Roman and Hanka are reunited over the telephone.<ref>http://www.film.u-net.com/Movies/Reviews/Dekalog_9.html Episode review</ref><ref>http://www.facets.org/decalogue/synopsis.html Episode synopsis</ref><ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/decalogue_vol_4_parts_viii_and_ix/# Episode Synopsis and critical review</ref>

Dick Tracy (1990 film)
 The film is set in the 1930s.<ref>https://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8790397/dick-tracy-movie-25</ref><ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=K-OCBcT1O4UC&pg=PA277&lpg=PA277&dq=dick+tracy+1990+set+in+the+1930s&source=bl&ots=Uf3gQF34eG&sig=Lf6NoDwvAU0OiPy_BcqW52oZTiE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbt72Fq7PcAhUKUK0KHdF6DJg4ChDoAQg_MAM#v=onepage&q=dick%20tracy%201990%20set%20in%20the%201930s&f=false</ref> At an illegal card game, a young [[Street children|street urchin]] witnesses the massacre of a group of mobsters at the hands of Flattop and Itchy, two of the hoods on the payroll of Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice. Big Boy's crime syndicate is aggressively taking over small businesses in the city. Detective Dick Tracy catches the urchin (who calls himself "Kid") in an act of petty theft. After rescuing him from a ruthless host, Tracy temporarily adopts him with the help of his girlfriend, Tess Trueheart.  Meanwhile, Big Boy coerces club owner Lips Manlis into signing over the deed to Club Ritz. He then kills Lips with a [[Cement shoes|cement overcoat]] (referred to onscreen as "The Bath") and steals his girlfriend, the seductive and sultry singer, Breathless Mahoney. After Lips is reported missing, Tracy interrogates his three hired guns Flattop, Itchy, and Mumbles, then goes to the club to arrest Big Boy for Lips' murder. Breathless is the only witness. Instead of providing testimony, she unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Tracy. Big Boy cannot be indicted and he is released from jail. Big Boy's next move is to try to bring other criminals, including Spud Spaldoni, Pruneface, Influence, Texie Garcia, Ribs Mocca, and Numbers, together under his leadership. Spaldoni refuses and is intentionally killed, leaving Dick Tracy, who discovered the meeting and was attempting to spy on it, wondering what is going on. The next day, Big Boy and his henchmen kidnap Tracy and attempt to bribe him; Tracy refuses, prompting the criminals to attempt to kill him. However, Tracy is saved by Kid, who gets prized by the police with an honorary detective certificate, which will remain temporary until he decides a name for himself.  Breathless shows up at Tracy's apartment, once again in an attempt to seduce him. Tracy shows he is only human by allowing her to kiss him. Tess witnesses this and eventually leaves town. Tracy leads a seemingly unsuccessful raid on Club Ritz, but it is actually a diversion so that Officer "Bug" Bailey can enter the building to operate a secretly installed listening device so the police can hear in on Big Boy's criminal activities. The resultant raids all but wipe out Big Boy's criminal empire. However, Big Boy discovers Bug and captures him for a trap planned by Influence and Pruneface to kill Tracy in the warehouse. In the resulting gun battle, a stranger with no face called "The Blank" steps out of the shadows to save Tracy after he is cornered and kills Pruneface. Influence escapes as Tracy rescues Bug from the same fate given to Lips Manlis, and Big Boy is enraged upon hearing that The Blank foiled the hit. Tracy tries again to get the testimony from Breathless he needs to put Big Boy away. She agrees to testify only if Tracy agrees to give in to her advances. Tess eventually has a change of heart, but before she can tell Tracy, she is kidnapped by The Blank, with the help of Big Boy's club piano player, 88 Keys. Tracy is drugged and rendered unconscious by The Blank, framed for murdering the corrupt District Attorney John Fletcher, and is detained. The Kid, meanwhile, adopts the name "Dick Tracy, Jr."  Big Boy's business thrives until The Blank frames him for Tess' kidnapping. Released by his colleagues on New Year's Eve, Tracy interrogates Mumbles and arrives at a shootout outside Big Boy's club where his men are killed by the police and Tracy. Abandoning his crew, Big Boy flees to a drawbridge and ties Tess to the gears before he is confronted by Tracy. Their fight is halted when The Blank appears and holds both men at gunpoint, offering to share the city with Tracy after Big Boy is dead. Big Boy takes advantage of a distraction and opens fire before Tracy sends him falling to his death in the bridge gears. Mortally wounded, The Blank is revealed to be Breathless Mahoney, who kisses Tracy before dying. All charges against Tracy are dropped.  Later, Tracy proposes to Tess when he is interrupted by the report of a robbery in progress. He leaves her with a ring before heading away with Dick Tracy, Jr.  
Desperate Hours
  In [[Utah]], Nancy Breyers ([[Kelly Lynch]]) is a defense lawyer who is inexplicably in love with client Michael Bosworth ([[Mickey Rourke]]), a sociopathic convict. During a break from a courtroom hearing, Nancy sneaks a gun to Bosworth. After Bosworth snaps a guard's neck, Bosworth and Nancy slip away.   Bosworth tears at Nancy's clothing and leaves her behind, where she will tell authorities Bosworth held her at gunpoint during his escape. He speeds off in a car with his brother Wally ([[Elias Koteas]]), and their partner, the hulking, half-witted Albert ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), then changes cars with one Nancy has left for him in a remote location.  In the meantime, decorated Vietnam veteran Tim Cornell ([[Anthony Hopkins]]) arrives at his former home with his ex-wife Nora ([[Mimi Rogers]]), who have two kids—15-year-old May ([[Shawnee Smith]]) and her 8-year-old brother Zack ([[Danny Gerard]]). Tim and Nora separated due to his infidelity with a younger woman, and Tim shows up trying to reconcile with Nora, with whom he is still in love.  Needing a hideout until Nancy can catch up with them, the Bosworth brothers and Albert settle on the Cornells' home with a "For Sale" sign which is seemingly picked by Bosworth at random. Somehow, Bosworth picks up intimate details of the Cornells, and one by one all of them find themselves the prisoners of the Bosworth brothers and Albert.   Nancy's innocent act does not fool FBI agent Brenda Chandler ([[Lindsay Crouse]]), who puts surveillance on her every move. Nancy eventually cuts a deal with Chandler to have charges against her reduced by betraying Bosworth.   As young Zack tries to escape through a window, a friend of the Cornells who visits the house by chance meets him. Bosworth makes the family friend enter inside by force, and as they discuss, Bosworth shoots him, then makes Albert dispose of the body as Albert gets anxiety-ridden and decides to go off on his own. As Albert leaves while covered in blood, he intercepts two college girls, who expose his presence to a small gas station owner. The owner calls the authorities who chase after Albert. Albert ignores their order to surrender and is killed by the police on a river bank.  Nancy begs Agent Chandler to give her a gun, but unbeknownst to Nancy, Chandler removes the bullets. As she goes to the Cornells' house, the house gets surrounded, and as a shootout starts by Bosworth, Wally is fatally wounded in a barrage of FBI bullets and falls on top of a shocked Nancy. Wally's gun is taken away by Tim. Bosworth holds a gun on Nora and is prepared to use it if Tim interferes. He is unaware that Tim has removed the bullets. Tim then drags the criminal outside, where Bosworth ignores the FBI's order to surrender, and is fatally shot.  
El Diablo (1990 film)
 Billy Ray Smith ([[Anthony Edwards]]) is a timid young schoolteacher from [[Boston]] living in a rugged [[Texas]] town. One of his students is a teenage girl named Nettie Tuleen who has an unrequited crush on him. While Billy Ray reads a story to the class by his favorite author, Kid Durango, the town is invaded by a gang of outlaws led by El Diablo ([[Robert Beltran]]), their actions mirroring the events from the story. When Nettie hears the commotion, she excitedly rushes outside only to be snatched up by El Diablo. Billy Ray tries to intervene, but only comes away with one of the outlaw's heirloom spurs as Diablo rides away laughing. The sheriff leads a party in pursuit, only to return with a group of riderless horses and with his tongue cut out.  With no one else in town willing to stand against the notorious outlaw, Billy Ray vows to rescue Nettie with the help of Kid Durango (reputed to be "the fastest gun in the West") despite not knowing how to ride a horse or shoot a gun. His ineptitude is displayed when on his way out of town, his mount rears up and throws him from the saddle, the impact causing his revolver to discharge and kill his horse. He arrives by train in the town of Millennium in search of J.D. Shones, a sheriff who had apparently rode with Kid Durango. Billy Ray discovers that Shones is already dead, having been killed by the current sheriff, who is in turn shot in the back by an aging gunslinger named Thomas Van Leek ([[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]), a friend of Kid Durango who offers his services to Billy Ray and procures him a new horse. When Billy Ray reveals that he is searching for El Diablo, Van Leek calls him a fool and departs. He later returns to save Billy Ray from a group of bounty hunters who mistakenly believe he killed the sheriff.  The next day, Van Leek begins to assemble a group of skilled professionals to aid them on their journey, using Diablo's spur as a calling card. The first to join them is a blacksmith named Bebe Patterson, one of Van Leek's old friends and a former captive of El Diablo. Next, the group interrupts a hanging orchestrated by the preacher/con artist Autolycus ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]) who is about to execute two men: an explosives expert named Roberto "Bob" Zamudio and a criminal known as Pitchfork Napier. All three join the group en route to Mexico, but Napier is soon killed and replaced by the Native American, Dancing Bear, as revenge for Napier having slept with his wife. After retrieving a cache of dynamite Zamudio had buried in the desert, the party crosses the Mexican border and stops at a saloon to rest, where Billy Ray is finally introduced to Kid Durango ([[Joe Pantoliano]]). However, he is shocked to learn that Durango (a mild-mannered fellow whose real name is Truman Feathers) is not the hero he was expecting, and that all of his stories were in fact based upon Van Leek's exploits.  Upon spotting Pestoso, one of El Diablo's henchmen in the saloon, Van Leek convinces Billy Ray to confront him in a showdown. Although terrified, Billy Ray stands his ground until the two draw their guns, with Van Leek secretly sniping the henchman from a nearby bell tower. After the duel, Pestoso's companion Chak Mol instructs Billy Ray to meet him alone the next morning at the "tree of death", while Kid Durango, inspired by Billy Ray's example and looking for new material to write about, joins the group on their quest.  As the others make plans to infiltrate the compound themselves, Chak Mol escorts Billy Ray directly into El Diablo's hideout, where he is bound to a tree before coming face-to-face with the dangerous outlaw. Though he offers to exchange Diablo's prized spur for Nettie's return, Diablo replies that he has found something he likes better and introduces Nettie as "Rosita", his new consort. Meanwhile, Bebe, Zamudio, and Autolycus are confronted by a group of Diablo's men. In the ensuing conflict, Autolycus and Zamudio are killed, leaving Bebe to carry out their plan alone. He speeds toward the compound in his wagon loaded with Zamudio's dynamite, but his leg gets trapped before he can jump free. Laughing hysterically, Bebe crashes into the hideout, the explosion serving as a distraction for Dancing Bear and Van Leek to open fire on Diablo's henchmen. In the aftermath, Van Leek finds a hidden chest of gold, alluding to an earlier suspicion by Kid Durango that Van Leek was more interested in Diablo's riches than Nettie's rescue. Disgusted, Billy Ray leaves to find Nettie on his own.  After chasing the young woman into a cave, he is confronted by El Diablo. Their meeting is interrupted by Kid Durango who, inspired to prove himself as a hero, challenges Diablo to a duel and is gunned down. With his last breaths, he implores Billy Ray to kill Diablo and "complete the story". Diablo taunts Billy Ray before deciding to shoot him in the head, but Van Leek calls him out before he can pull the trigger. Diablo wounds Van Leek in the shoulder, disarming him, but Billy Ray intervenes by shooting the outlaw in the back twice, much to Van Leek's amusement.  In the end, the deceased group members are buried and Billy Ray pays his final respects to Kid Durango before returning Nettie home to her mother. As Billy Ray and Van Leek head out of town, a forlorn Nettie asks if he will be coming back, to which Billy Ray answers, "Someday." The film closes with the townspeople respectfully acknowledging Billy Ray and he and Van Leek discussing plans for a new book series based on their adventures together.

Die Hard 2
 On Christmas Eve 1990, two years after [[Die Hard|the Nakatomi Tower Incident]], police officer [[John McClane]] is waiting at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] for his wife [[John McClane#Holly Gennero|Holly]] to arrive from [[Los Angeles]]. Reporter Richard Thornburg, who exposed Holly's identity to Hans Gruber in the Nakatomi Tower, is assigned a seat across the aisle from her. In the airport bar, McClane observes two men in Army fatigues behaving suspiciously and pursues them into the baggage area. After a shootout, McClane kills one man while the other escapes. Learning that the dead man is an American soldier believed to be killed in action while originally serving in [[Honduras]], McClane relates the situation to airport police captain Carmine Lorenzo, who dismisses any concerns.  Former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] Colonel William Stuart and other members of his unit establish a base in a church near Dulles. They hack into the [[air traffic control]] systems, cut off all communication to the planes, and turn off the runway lights, leaving Dulles ATC powerless to land any planes. Their goal is to rescue General Ramon Esperanza, a drug lord and dictator of fictional [[Val Verde (fictional country)|Val Verde]], who is being extradited to the United States to stand trial on [[drug trafficking]] charges. They demand a [[Boeing 747]] cargo plane so they can escape to another country with Esperanza in tow, and warn the [[Air traffic control|airport controllers]] not to try to restore control. With his wife on one of the planes circling above [[Washington, D.C.]] with too little fuel to be redirected, McClane prepares to fight the terrorists, allying himself with a janitor, Marvin, to gain larger access to the airport.  Dulles communications director Leslie Barnes heads to the unfinished Annex Skywalk with a [[SWAT]] team to re-establish communications with the planes. Just before reaching the Skywalk, Barnes and the entire group are ambushed by Stuart's henchmen and the SWAT team is killed in the ensuing firefight. With Marvin's help, McClane races to the Skywalk, rescues Barnes, and kills Stuart's men. Stuart retaliates by recalibrating the [[instrument landing system]] and then impersonating air traffic controllers to crash a British jet, killing all 230 passengers and crew members on board. A U.S. Army Special Forces team led by Major Grant is called in. By listening in on a two-way radio that was dropped by one of Stuart's henchmen, McClane finds out that Esperanza, having killed his captors and now piloting the plane carrying him to Dulles, is landing.  With Marvin's aid, McClane reaches the aircraft before Stuart's henchmen. Esperanza traps him and the mercenaries throw grenades into the cockpit. McClane escapes via the ejection seat mere seconds before the grenades detonate and the aircraft explodes. Barnes helps McClane locate the mercenaries' hideout and they tell Grant and his team to raid the location, but the mercenaries escape on snowmobiles. McClane pursues them but is stunned to discover the mercenaries' guns are loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]], concluding that the Special Forces team are in fact Stuart's subordinates.  McClane demands Lorenzo intercept the Boeing 747 in which the mercenaries will escape; Lorenzo refuses to listen until McClane fires at the Captain with the blank gun, thus proving his story. Aboard Holly's flight, a suspicious Thornburg is monitoring airport radio traffic and learns about the situation from a secret transmission to the circling planes from Barnes. He phones in a sensational and exaggerated take on what is happening leading to panic and preventing the officers from reaching the escape plane. Holly subdues Thornburg with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]].  McClane hitches a ride on a news helicopter that drops him off on the wing of the taxiing mercenaries' 747. He jams the left inboard aileron with his jacket, preventing the plane from taking off. Esperanza, who is flying the jet, is shocked when he sees McClane on the wing. Grant emerges and fights McClane, but is knocked off the wing and falls into an engine, killing him. Stuart then comes out and succeeds in knocking McClane off the plane before removing McClane's jacket. However, he fails to notice that McClane had opened the fuel hatch. McClane then uses his cigarette lighter to ignite the trail of fuel which causes the jet to explode, killing the other soldiers, Esperanza, and Stuart aboard. The planes circling above use the fire trail to help them land. As the other passengers on board are rescued, John and Holly happily embrace.

Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku
 [[File:bardocksquad.png|thumb|left|The main protagonists of the film: Shugesh, Bardock, Borgos, Tora and Fasha]] The special tells the story of [[Bardock]], a so-called low-level soldier in [[Frieza]]'s armed forces. At the outset of the story, his youngest son, Kakarot, is born on Planet Vegeta, and is being prepared to be sent to a "frontier planet" (Earth) in order to exterminate all life there. Meanwhile, Bardock and his crew are on an assignment to slaughter the inhabitants of Planet Kanassa, which they easily accomplish by using the planet's full moon to transform into Great Apes. The next morning, after every last Kanassan is seemingly wiped out, Bardock and his crew rest up and celebrate their victory until one surviving warrior catches him off-guard and decides to give him the "gift" of [[precognition|seeing the future]], before being destroyed by Bardock. This haunts Bardock with visions of the destruction of Planet Vegeta, and the oppression of the entire [[Universe]] at the hands of Frieza.  Bardock dismisses the visions and goes to join his team on Planet Meat, only to discover most of them dead, and his best friend Tora mortally wounded. Before he succumbs to his injuries, Tora reveals that Bardock's squad was betrayed and killed by Frieza's henchman Dodoria and his elite soldiers, and that Frieza ordered the attack on the crew due to him becoming paranoid about the growing power of the Saiyans. Horrified and enraged by his fallen friend's last words, he takes Tora's blood-soaked armband and wraps it around his head, creating a makeshift bandana. He then battles Dodoria's Elite and defeats them all, only to be easily overwhelmed by a single mouth blast from Dodoria. He is left severely injured, but manages to return to Planet Vegeta.  Now realizing that Frieza intends to [[Genocide|destroy the entire Saiyan race]] by annihilating their homeworld, Bardock attempts to convince the other Saiyans of the danger that they are all in, but everyone laughs at his claims. Bardock thus begins a final one-man assault against Frieza and his men. After fighting his way through Frieza's armed guard, Bardock sends a large energy blast at the tyrant himself, expecting a sure victory. However, Frieza counters this with his deadly ''[[Supernova]]'' technique, which kills Bardock, many of his own soldiers, and destroys Planet Vegeta. As he is dying, Bardock sees one more vision of the future: his son Kakarot engaging in a climactic battle against Frieza. Being assured that Kakarot will be the one to defeat Frieza, Bardock gives a small smile as he dies along with Planet Vegeta. After his demise, Bardock telepathically wishes Kakarot to take care. At the same moment, Kakarot, who is still in his space pod, wakes up.  Elsewhere, having just completed an assignment on a far-off world, [[Vegeta]] is informed by [[Nappa (Dragon Ball)|Nappa]] (in the English version, it is one of Frieza's minor soldiers who tells him) of his homeworld's destruction, and that Frieza claims that the planet was destroyed by a huge meteor. Vegeta's pride keeps him from expressing his shock, and he remains outwardly emotionless. Soon afterwards, Kakarot's space pod touches down on Earth, where he is found by an elderly man named [[Grandpa Gohan|Gohan]] and giggles happily in the old man's arms. Gohan then decides to adopt the boy as his own grandson, and gives him a new name: [[Goku]].  As the credits roll, scenes are shown of Goku's many heroic deeds on Earth, including his battles against Emperor Pilaf, the Red Ribbon Army, [[Tien Shinhan]], [[King Piccolo]], Nappa and Vegeta, culminating in an image of Goku about to battle Frieza on Namek, with the spirits of Bardock and his fellow Saiyans watching him in the background.  
Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might
  Gohan, Krillin, Bulma, and Oolong are spending a peaceful day camping, but that night, a huge fire breaks out in the nearby forest. Using their strength, Krillin and Gohan put out the fire and save the animals. The next day, the group find the Dragon Balls using the Dragon Radar, and summon the wish-granting Eternal Dragon, Shenron, to restore the forest. Afterwards, Gohan befriends a purple dragon which he and Krillin rescued from the forest's destruction by the fire and names him Hire Dragon (Icarus in the FUNimation dub). Unbeknownst to the group, the fire was started by a space probe landing. The next morning, the space pod begins scouting the area and it is soon revealed that it was sent by a Saiyan, Tullece, who has chosen the Earth to plant the Tree of Might. The Tree of Might absorbs the world’s energy, storing it in its fruit, and whoever eats it is granted godlike power.  Tullece' minions land and create a fissure in the earth to plant the seed. In the Other World, King Kai recognizes the Tree of Might and warns the Z Warriors of the Earth’s imminent devastation if they don’t destroy it immediately. The Z Warriors head out and find the Tree of Might. They fired their energy attacks at it, but they don’t even leave a scratch on the Tree of Might. To make matters worse, Tullece' minions soon appear and a battle breaks out as their master watches on from their space ship. The Z Warriors attack with all they have, but it soon become apparent they are no match. Gohan, arriving on Hire Dragon, also joins in to help his friends out.  Noticing Gohan in the battle, Tullece learns that the young boy is a Saiyan and appears before him. After claiming his knowledge of Goku whom he calls by his real name "Kakarot", he attempts to convince Gohan to join him and help him conquer the universe. Gohan refuses and tries to attack Tullece, but he blocked his punch and prepared to kill him as an endeavor to change his mind. Luckily, Piccolo intervenes to confront Tullece in an effort to save Gohan. Unfortunately, Tullece tricks Piccolo into catching Gohan, and appearing from behind him, the evil Saiyan blasted the mighty Namekian away, leaving Gohan right where Tullece had him. When he saw Gohan's tail grew back, Tullece decides to have a little fun and creates an artificial moon (Power Ball), forcing Gohan to look at it and change into a Great Ape. Goku notices this and comes to help, only to be attacked by the now-transformed Gohan. Just as the Great Ape begins to crush Goku, Hire Dragon appears and calms Gohan. But after seeing this, Tullece shoots Hire Dragon, causing Gohan to go into a frenzy, and this time, quickly turns on Tullece. Dodging Gohan, Tullece then fires a massive energy attack at the Great Ape, but Goku severs his tail with a Destructo Disk, returning him to normal just in time so that the attack misses Gohan.  Enraged at Tullece for treating Gohan like this, Goku quickly defeats Tullece' minions and heads off to take on his foe. The two Saiyans' one-on-one showdown begins and Goku has Tullece on the ropes. However, the fruit of the Tree of Might has finally developed and Tullece grabs one, taking a bite. With the sudden surge of power, Tullece quickly turns the tables on Goku, but the Z Warriors (except Gohan who is exhausted after his Great Ape transformation) come to his aid. As they take on Tullece, Goku begins to form a Spirit Bomb, but the Earth barely has any energy left. While Tullece defeat the remaining Z Warriors, Goku then fires his Spirit Bomb at him, but Tullece shoots another energy blast that blocked the bomb and then knocked out Goku.  Surprisingly, the energy from the Tree of Might suddenly flows into Goku and the Spirit Bomb is recreated. Goku confronts Turles and each unleashes their final attack, but Goku's Spirit Bomb overwhelms Turles' attack and hits him head on, sending him flying through the Tree of Might and destroying them both. Now that the Tree of Might is gone, the stolen energy is returned to Earth. With peace returned, the group enjoy another camping trip.  
Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest
 While looking at the Dragon Radar, Oolong notices that all of the Dragon Balls are starting to be gathered together. He and Gohan, who were also searching for the Dragon Balls, head out to investigate and end up at the Tsurumai-Tsuburi Mountains’ eternal wall of ice, where coincidentally, Piccolo is also training. Dr. Kochin summons Shenron and wishes for Dr.  Wheelo’s lab to be released from the ice. The ice begins to break away and a building emerges. Gohan and Oolong look on in disbelief, when they are suddenly attacked by Dr. Kochin’s Biomen. Piccolo shows up to save Gohan, but is overcome by three mysterious fighters, while Gohan and Oolong escape.  Dr. Kochin and his Biomen soon appear at Kame House, and request that Master Roshi come with them. He refuses and easily defeats the Biomen, but Dr. Kochin kidnaps Bulma to force Master Roshi to go back with him to the lab. There, Master Roshi is forced to fight three bio-warriors, but it soon becomes apparent he’s no match. Bulma discovers that Dr. Wheelo’s goal is to obtain the body of the strongest man so he can be revived. Bulma informs them that Son Goku is now the strongest man in the world.  Oolong informs Goku of the situation, and he heads out to find Bulma and Master Roshi. He arrives at Dr. Wheelo’s lab and is greeted by Misokattsun, Kishime, and Ebifurya, Dr. Kochin’s three bio-warriors. Goku defeats Misokattsun by bursting through him with the Kaiō-Ken, but is then sealed up in ice by Ebifurya. Gohan and Krillin arrive to back him up, but are at their wit’s end against Kishime. Using the Kaiō-Ken, Goku breaks free from ice and defeats the two remaining bio-warriors. Goku confronts Dr. Wheelo, demanding he give Bulma back, but Dr. Wheelo just wants Goku’s body.  Piccolo, who has been brainwashed by Dr. Wheelo, appears and a battle between the two rivals commences. Gohan tries to stop Piccolo, but he simply swats Gohan away. Being unable to stop them from fighting, Gohan’s anger explodes, shattering Dr. Wheelo brainwashing device on Piccolo. Dr. Wheelo is stunned by Gohan’s power and decides he must fight Goku himself. He begins to break his robot body free from the wall, subsequently knocking Dr. Kochin down an energy shaft, killing him. Everyone watches on in horror, including Krillin, who has freed Bulma.  The true battle begins, and Dr. Wheelo seems to have the upper hand. Even the three-person Kamehameha of Goku, Master Roshi, and Krillin has no effect on him. Soon, Goku and Piccolo are the only ones left able to fight. Goku resorts to using a Kaiō-Ken powered Kamehameha, which merely knocks Dr. Wheelo into space. Goku begins to form a Spirit Bomb, but Dr. Wheelo interrupts him before he can throw it by shooting ''ki'' blasts at him. The others fly up to distract him so Goku can successfully throw the Spirit Bomb. Goku lets it fly and it’s a direct hit. Dr. Wheelo’s brain is destroyed and peace once again returns to Earth.

DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp
 [[Scrooge McDuck]] travels to the Middle East to inspect a recently discovered treasure chest he is certain contains the treasure of the great thief [[Ali Baba|Collie Baba]], accompanied by [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]], [[Webby Vanderquack]], and [[Launchpad McQuack]]. Although initially disappointed when the chest seems to only contain old clothes, Scrooge is excited when an ancient treasure map is found in the pocket of an old robe. Guided by the thief Dijon, they set out to find the lost treasure, not realizing that Dijon actually works for the evil sorcerer [[List of Donald Duck universe characters|Merlock]], who desires something Collie Baba owned. The group discovers Collie Baba's treasure in a sand-covered pyramid. Webby sees a lamp in the treasure, which Scrooge lets her keep since it does not hold any value.  After packing up the treasure for transport, Scrooge and his group are trapped in a room full of monstrous scorpions by Merlock and Dijon, who steal the treasure. However, Merlock discovers that the lamp has been stolen; he drags Dijon with him to locate it. Scrooge and his friends manage to escape from the pyramid and, with nothing more than Webby's lamp, depart for [[Duckburg]].  Days later, the children discover the lamp holds a Genie. Ecstatic about his freedom, the Genie grants the four children 3 wishes each; to trick Scrooge, he poses as the boys' Woodchuck scout friend Gene. Their wishes include a baby elephant (which runs amok through Scrooge's mansion) and a giant ice cream sundae, among other things. Fearful of a bird flying by at night, Genie tells them about Merlock, who used his wishes for eternal life and the destruction of [[Atlantis]] and [[Pompeii]], which were both popular vacation spots; Merlock's magic [[talisman]], which allows him to take various animal forms, also overrides the lamp's rules, granting him unlimited wishes. Collie Baba stole the lamp from Merlock and hid it away with his treasure, and Merlock had spent the centuries since searching for it. The children suggest that they wish for the talisman, but Genie says that this is the only wish he is unable to grant. They must prevent Merlock from obtaining the lamp or the world will suffer.  The next day, Webby uses her last wish to bring all her toys to life, which forces the children to reveal the Genie's true identity to Scrooge. Wishing to impress the Archeological Society at their annual ball, Scrooge wishes for the treasure of Collie Baba, and brings the lamp and the Genie with him to the ball. He is followed by Merlock and Dijon, who violently ambush Scrooge. In the ensuing struggle, Scrooge mistakes a gravy boat for the lamp and leaves the lamp and the Genie behind, after which they both fall into the hands of Dijon, who is convinced by the Genie to keep the lamp instead of giving it to Merlock.  Having wished for Scrooge's fortune, Dijon takes possession of the [[Donald Duck universe#Money Bin|Money Bin]] and has Scrooge arrested for trespassing. However, Scrooge is immediately bailed out by Launchpad, his nephews, Webby, [[List of Donald Duck universe characters|Mrs. Beakley]] and [[List of Donald Duck universe characters|Duckworth]], who agree to help Scrooge set things right. Scrooge, the nephews and Webby infiltrate the Money Bin in an attempt to steal the lamp, but are stopped by Merlock, who recovers the lamp. With the Genie under his control again, Merlock wishes for Dijon to be turned into a pig for his disloyalty and then for the Money Bin to become a fortress, which flies into the air high above Duckburg. When an indignant Scrooge threatens him, Merlock wishes him "out of my house", and Genie reluctantly raises the wind to send Scrooge to the edge of the fortress, hanging on for dear life. The nephews use a slingshot to knock the lamp out of Merlock's hands, tossing it to Scrooge, who loses his grip and falls towards the earth. Merlock recovers his talisman and pursues as a [[griffin]], grappling with Scrooge in the air, but Scrooge knocks off the talisman from Merlock's hand, causing the sorcerer to lose his power and fall to his death.  Recovering the lamp, Scrooge uses his second wish to return himself, his family, and his Money Bin back to Duckburg. Back in the Money Bin, Scrooge declares that he has had "enough of all this wishing" and threatens to use his final wish to bury the lamp where it would never be found again. Instead, he wishes for Genie to become a real boy. Without the Genie, the lamp crumbles to dust, and thus removing its magic forever. While the children play with their newest friend, Scrooge discovers Dijon, recovered from Merlock's wish, stuffing his trousers with his money. Scrooge chases him outside, yelling "Somebody stop those pants!".

Some years later, Peg Boggs, a local [[Avon Products|Avon]] door-to-door [[salesperson|saleswoman]], visits the decrepit [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] mansion where Edward lives. She finds Edward alone and offers to take him to her home after discovering he is virtually harmless. Peg introduces Edward to her family: her husband Bill, their young son Kevin, and their teenage daughter Kim. Despite their initial fear of Edward, they come to see him as a kind person.  The Boggs' neighbors are curious about their new house guest, and the Boggs throw a neighborhood barbecue welcoming Edward. Most of the neighbors are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into [[Topiary|topiaries]]. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as he does not have a background or financial history.  Jealous of Kim's attraction to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick the lock on his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a burglar alarm is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.  During Christmas, Edward carves an angelic [[ice sculpture]] modeled after Kim; the ice shavings are thrown into the air and fall like snow, a rarity for the neighborhood. Kim dances in the snowfall. Jim arrives and calls out to Edward, surprising him and causing him to accidentally cut Kim's hand. Jim accuses Edward of intentionally harming Kim, but Kim, fed up with Jim's jealousy, breaks up with him. Edward runs off in a rage, destroying his works until he is calmed by a stray dog. Kim tells her parents what happened, and they set out to find Edward. Edward returns to the Boggs home to find Kim and Kevin there. Kim tries apologizing for Jim's behavior and asks him to hold her, but Edward fears he will hurt her. Jim drives around in a drunken rage and nearly runs over Kevin, but Edward pushes Kevin to safety, inadvertently cutting him. Jim tells those witnessing the event that Edward is attacking Kevin, and he tries attacking Edward. Edward defends himself, cutting Jim's arm, and then flees to the mansion.  Kim races after Edward, while Jim obtains a handgun and follows Kim. In the mansion, Jim ambushes Edward and fights with him; Edward refuses to fight back until he sees Jim slap Kim as she attempts to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him from a window of the mansion, killing him. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him before departing. As the police and neighbors gather, Kim leads them to believe that Jim and Edward killed each other.  The elderly woman finishes telling her granddaughter the story, revealing that she is Kim and saying that she never saw Edward again. She prefers not to visit him because decades have passed and she wants him to remember her as she was in her youth. She thinks Edward is still alive, immortal because he is artificial, and because of the "snow" which Edward creates when carving ice sculptures.

Ernest Goes to Jail
 Security guards Chuck and Bobby play a game of [[Red light/Green light]] while being night watchmen for Howard County Bank and Trust and are obsessed with elaborate schemes of would-be thieves. They hear a sound coming from a [[floor polisher]] that Ernest (who works as a night custodian but dreams of being a clerk) is trying to turn on for operation, but he ends up making a mess in the bank and he becomes magnetic from a mishap with the floor polisher. The next day, [[World bank|bank president]] Oscar Pendlesmythe's assistant, Charlotte Sparrow orders him to clean up his supernatural mess. Pendlesmythe wants to terminate Ernest's employment at the bank, but Charlotte has a soft heart for misfits and stray dogs, so she argues on his behalf. Ernest takes a bath at home in a tumble dry washing machine and uses a blow dryer with a windtunnel force for his evening dinner with Charlotte in a restaurant. He later receives in the mail a summons to jury duty in court and tells the two watchmen about it. During the trial, Dracup Maximum Security Prison convict Rubin Bartlett notices that Ernest is a dead ringer for death row inmate Felix Nash and has his lawyer convince the jury to tour the prison, where Ernest is kidnapped by Nash and another inmate named Lyle and forced to switch places with Nash. Even though he tries to tell the guards he is not Nash, they refuse to believe him. Ernest also does not know that he has a death sentence, which is for Nash.  While having lunch, a guard tells them to stand up and be quiet, when he notices Ernest is making a lot of noise, which almost sends him into the cell. Ernest tries to tell one of the prison guards that he is Ernest, not Nash, but the guard calls him "Mr. Funny Man" (which is a mistaken lie), angrily says that he is not funny, and is lying and throws him into the cell right in front of Lyle, who pushes him back. When he pushes him near the prison bars, he tells the guard that he was beaten up (and accidentally slamming the guard's head on the bars). The guard tells Ernest that he will be sent to the hole, which makes Ernest realize he is in jail. Bartlett tells him that Nash has assumed his identity and warns him to keep his mouth shut. Ernest makes several unsuccessful escape attempts, and is soon sent to the electric chair by the prison warden (Charles Napier).  The electrocution fails, and Ernest is transformed into a type of superhuman, with the ability to shoot lightning bolts from his hands. To make his getaway, he blasts a hole in the main gates, however, Bartlett obstructs the escape and attempts to kill Ernest himself, only for Lyle to intervene, knock Bartlett unconscious and allow Ernest to make his escape, knowing that Ernest is different from everyone else. Making his way home, he discovers that his Pee-wee Herman-like décor has been replaced by a slick [[Lounge Lizard]] style of decorating and exclaims, "I've been vandalized - by [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]!" Meanwhile, Nash is preparing to blast open the bank's vault with a time bomb, with Charlotte and an unconscious Chuck bound nearby. Charlotte begs Nash not to go through with it, and he blurts the truth about being an impostor. Charlotte doesn't believe it until he points out he's done a far better job cleaning the floors than Ernest ever had. Ernest arrives and he and Nash do battle. Ernest gets electrocuted yet again when Nash harshly throws him against an electric cage that the bank had rigged to drop from the ceiling to catch robbers. Now Ernest has become polarized and gained the ability to fly. He uses his super powers to fly through the skylight of the bank with the bomb which leads to a spectacular mid-air explosion. Everyone especially Chuck thinks that Ernest has been killed, until he falls through the skylight and lands on Nash, which leads the warden and the guards to find out Ernest was right all along. Ernest tiredly declares, "I came, I saw, I got blowed up." and then faints.

Engal Swamy Ayyappan
  An [[Ayyappan]]'s devotee (Dasarathan) tells five different stories of [[Ayyappan]]'s miracles to the other devotees.  The first story is about Rajaswamy (Hari Raj). Rajaswamy, an [[Ayyappan]]'s devotee, is married to Usha (Sindhu) and promises to make a pilgrimage if he gets a job. He finds a job as a car driver. While he's poor and an ardent devotee, his chief ([[Malaysia Vasudevan]]) is boastful and disrespectful. Before the pilgrimage, Rajaswamy must arrange a pooja for Ayyappan. His wife sells her jewels to organize the pooja. His chief arranges the same day the pooja with boasting. The lord Ayyappan, as a child, comes in Rajaswamy's chief house and the chief insults the lord. Ayyappan comes to Rajaswamy's house, Rajaswamy welcomes with joy and Ayyappan helps him in his pooja. Ayyappan forgives the chief.  The second story is about Swamy ([[Anand Babu]]). During his pilgrimage to [[Sabarimala]], someone stole his things. Swamy begins to worship Lord Ayyappan and an elephant retrieves Swamy's things.  The third story is about Bhaskarswamy ([[Dilip (Tamil actor)|Dilip]]) who is married to Lakshmi (Anju). He puts the Ayyapan's chain and he has to follow a strict vegetarian diet. His arrogant neighbour Sarasu doesn't care about it; she cooks fishes and she behaves very arrogantly to everyone.

Europa Europa
  ===Nazi Germany=== Solek (a nickname for Solomon, also called "Solly") and his family live in [[Nazi Germany]]. On the eve of Solek's [[B'nai mitzvah|bar mitzvah]], [[Kristallnacht]] occurs. He escapes, naked, then hiding in a barrel. At night, he calls his acquaintance to bring him clothes from his house. She refuses, but throws him a leather jacket with a swastika band on its arm. He comes back home. His family is together at home, but his sister is killed by Nazis. The father, who was born in [[Łódź]], Poland, decides to go back there.  ===Poland=== The Perel family (Solek, his parents, his two brothers, David and Isaak) decides to move to [[Łódź]], central Poland, where the family believes it will be safe. Solly causes criminal damage and the police are called. Living in Łódź, Solly meets Kasia, a cashier working in a cinema. Thanks to her, Solly can go to the cinema without paying for tickets. Later, they establish a romantic relationship. However, less than a year later, [[World War II]] begins with the German [[Invasion of Poland]]. Solly is happy that the criminal case will be forgotten, since the police will have more important issues to solve. Solek's family decides he and his brother should leave for [[Eastern Europe]]. Solek meets hysterically upset Kasia but his brother separates them. Isaak and Solek flee towards the eastern border of Poland, only to find the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]]. (In an ironic scene, as Solek and other Jewish refugees cross a river in a small boat, while a boat carrying Polish refugees fleeing the Soviets, passes in the opposite direction, Solomon explains in an internal monologue that the Jews, fearing Nazi persecution, fled toward the Soviets, while the Poles, who feared the Soviets more, fled toward the Germans.) The brothers are separated and Solek is placed in a Soviet orphanage in [[Grodno]] with other Polish refugee children.  ===Soviet Union=== Solek lives in the orphanage for two years, where he joins the [[Komsomol]] and receives [[Communism|Communist]] education. Being a teenager, he has a romantic interest in Inna, a young and attractive instructor who defends him when the authorities at school discover that his class origin is bourgeois. He even climbs outside the building to watch her in her bedroom. One scene features a [[Russia]]n version of the German Communist song ''Dem Morgenrot Entgegen'' ("Towards The Dawn") before mail call, where Solek receives a letter from his parents who have been re-settled in a [[ghetto]].  ===Nazi-occupied Soviet Union=== Then, with the crash of a bomb, [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion the Soviet Union, begins. The orphanage is evacuated but Solek is left behind, to be found by German soldiers. Solek gets rid of his identity papers and tells the Germans he is "Josef Peters", a ''[[Volksdeutsche]]r'' (ethnic German) from a [[Baltic German]] family in [[Latvia]]. Although he does not respond to his made up name, the soldiers deduce that he was in the orphanage because his parents were killed by the Soviets and promise him vengeance. When the unit captures [[Yakov Dzhugashvili]], the son of [[Joseph Stalin]], with Solly's help translating Russian, they declare "Jupp" to be their "good-luck charm" and adopt him as an auxiliary. Thanks to his fluent German and Russian, he becomes their cultural guide and interpreter. He accompanies the unit for several weeks and sees all the horrors of war, including murdered civilians, as the Germans seek to crush Soviet resistance.  Solek is still in danger, he cannot let anyone see him bathing, because his [[circumcision|circumcised penis]] would expose "Jupp" as a Jew. Robert, one of the soldiers and a [[homosexuality|homosexual]], sneaks in on "Jupp" when he finally manages a private bath. Solek rejects Robert's advances but knowing that both of them have secrets the Nazis would kill them for, they become close friends. A bizarre combat incident occurs. Robert is killed and Solek, left alone, tries to get to the Soviet lines. As he crosses a bridge, the unit charges across behind him and the Soviet troops surrender; "Jupp" is hailed as a hero. The company commander decides that "such a fine young German" should be properly educated. He is childless, so he tells "Jupp" that he will adopt him and send him to the elite [[Hitler Youth]] Academy in [[Braunschweig]] to receive Nazi education. (This is much to Solek's consternation but of course he cannot refuse.) He is escorted for much of the trip by Rosemarie, a middle-aged female Nazi official. Rosemarie thinks "Jupp" resembles [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and observes that he even has the same birthday. On the train, they have sex, with her crying out ''"Mein Führer!"'' as she climaxes.  ===Nazi Germany=== At the school, "Peters" is introduced to the other boys as a heroic combat veteran. Solek tries to disguise his circumcision with string and rubber bands in various painful ways to simulate a foreskin. He evades a medical examination by pretending to have toothache and then must endure having the dentist pull it without anaesthetic.  Girls from the [[Bund Deutscher Mädel]] (League of German Girls, the female equivalent of the Hitler Youth) serve meals at the Academy. Leni, one of these girls, becomes infatuated with "Jupp" but he dares not take advantage. Leni is a fervent Nazi and even speaks of wanting to kill Jews. Leni strongly hints that she would happily bear "Jupp"'s child but after a particularly venomous anti-Jewish remark he refuses any intimacy. She calls him a ''Schlappschwanz'' ("limp-dick") and they break off.  A less serious threat is the visit to the Academy of a Nazi "expert" in "[[scientific racism|racial science]]", who claims particular skill in detecting Jews. The Nazi selects "Jupp" as his subject for a demonstration and carefully measures his head and face. He then calculates "Jupp"'s [[anthropometry|anthropometric indices]] and pronounces him mixed but "pure Aryan stock", to Jupp's relieved surprise. Soon after, while working in a factory for the war effort, Jupp and his classmates learn that the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] has been defeated at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].  After several months without seeing Leni, Solek visits Leni's mother, who does not sympathize with the Nazis. She tells him Leni is pregnant and intends to "give the child to the Führer", in the ''[[Lebensborn]]'' program. Solek realizes that the child's father is his best friend and classmate Gerd. When Leni's mother presses Josef on his identity, he breaks down and confesses that he is Jewish; she tells him that she suspected that and promises not to betray him. Leni never finds out.  Solek's pretense is nearly exposed when the [[Gestapo]] investigates "Jupp"'s supposed parentage. He is summoned to Gestapo offices but cannot show a Certificate of Racial Purity, which he claims is in Grodno. The Gestapo official says he will send for it and then rants about how the war will be won by Hitler's ''[[Wunderwaffen]]'' ("wonder weapons"). As Solek leaves, the building is destroyed by Allied bombs; Solek's relief is tempered by Gerd's death in the bombing.  ===Soviet-occupied Nazi Germany=== As Soviet troops close in on Berlin, the Hitler Youth at the school are sent to the front and Solek manages to surrender. His captors refuse to believe that he is a Jew. "If you're a Jew, why don't you look like this? Look!" demands a Soviet officer as he shows Solek photos of murdered Jews from the [[death camps]] they had liberated. Jupp had not been aware this was going on. They are about to have Solek shot by an elderly Communist political prisoner (wearing a [[Nazi concentration camp badges|red triangle]] on his camp uniform) when Solek's brother Isaak, just released from a [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]], identifies Solek and saves him. Before leaving the camp, Isaak tells Solek to never reveal his story to anyone, saying it would never be believed. He is released shortly thereafter and [[Aliyah|emigrates]] to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], the future [[state of Israel]], where he embraces his Jewish heritage. The films ends with the real Solomon Perel, as an old man, singing a Jewish folk song taken from the [[Book of Psalms]] ("[[Hine Ma Tov]]," Psalm 133:1).  
Faces of Death IV
 Much like its three predecessors, ''Faces of Death IV'' provides scenes of dying, murder, accidents, [[police brutality]], [[execution]], [[cult]] [[ritual]]s, and other macabre events. Some of these include a [[bungee jumping]] trip gone awry, a magician's fatal mishap with a [[Houdini]] trick, a [[wrecking yard]] worker who has his left leg severed by a falling [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]], a [[Satanism|Satanic]] ritual that ends in the death of several, a cocaine dealer's fatal wedding, and more. John Alan Schwartz cameos yet again as an ambulance driver.  The earlier films in the series were of a more serious nature and tone, whereas this installment leans more toward [[Camp (style)|camp]]: "Dr. Louis Flellis" sits at his desk in front of a glowing red lava lamp, with a plastic skeletal foot on the desk in front of him during introductions to most sequences. Flellis is also shown eating a plate of barbecue ribs immediately before showing slaughterhouse footage.  
Everybody's Fine (1990 film)
 Matteo Scuro, a retired [[Sicily|Sicilian]] bureaucrat and [[opera]] buff, has been stood up by his five adult children during the summer vacation, all of whom live in various cities on the Italian mainland with what he believes are responsible jobs. Despite their not visiting and the neighbours' criticisms, he remains optimistic, considering that his children could not come because they are too busy. His children are named after popular opera characters, Tosca for Puccini's [[Tosca]], Canio for Leoncavallo's [[Pagliacci]], Norma for Bellini's [[Norma (opera)|Norma]], Guglielmo for Rossini's [[Guglielmo Tell]] and Alvaro for Verdi's [[La forza del destino]].   He decides to surprise each of them with a visit, traveling by train, and finds none of them as he imagined, with each of his children seeming to reflect the opera character after whom they were named. Matteo's train journeys take him to [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Florence]], [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] to search for each of his children; he even spends one night on the streets among the homeless. Before his arrival at each of their homes, each of his grown children scramble to put on a façade to cover up their personal failings:  One daughter's ex-husband temporarily moves back in with her and their child.  A son who lost his University professorship temporarily moves back into his old office.  Another daughter hides the fact that she works as a lingerie model, etc.  Finally, after visiting all his children, Scuro returns to Sicily, visits his wife's grave, and reports to her with irony that their children are all fine.  
The Exorcist III
 The film begins with the [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]] of someone wandering through the streets of Georgetown, a voice informing us "I have dreams... of a rose... and of falling down a long flight of stairs." The point of view shows a warning of evil about to arrive later that night at a church. Demonic growls are heard. Leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a [[crucifix]] comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman at a [[crime scene]], where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered.  Kinderman takes his friend, a [[priest]] named Father Dyer, out to see their mutually favorite film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes place—a priest is found [[Decapitation|decapitated]] in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalized—and found murdered the next day—with the words "IT'S A WONDERFULL LIFE", written on a wall in Dyer's blood.  The fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease: seventeen years ago the vicious [[serial killer]] James "The Gemini" Venamun, was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini's sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra "L" in his notes sent to the media, such as "usefull" or "carefull". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer's true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police's [[homicide]] department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the ''left middle finger'' was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved ''on the back'' of the victim.  Kinderman visits the head of the [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] ward, Dr. Temple, who relates the history of a man in Cell 11, that he was found wandering aimlessly seventeen years ago with [[amnesia]]. The man was locked up, [[Catatonia|catatonic]] until recently when he became violent and claimed to be the Gemini Killer. Kinderman sees that the patient resembles his dead friend [[Damien Karras|Father Damien Karras]]. The patient expresses ignorance of Father Karras, but boasts of killing Father Dyer.  The next morning, a nurse and Dr. Temple are found dead. Kinderman returns to see the patient in Cell 11, who claims that after his execution his soul entered Karras's dying body. The Gemini's spiritual "master", who had possessed the girl [[Regan MacNeil]], was furious at being pushed out of the child's body and is exacting its revenge by putting the soul of the Gemini Killer into the body of Father Karras. Each evening, the soul of the Gemini leaves the body of Karras and possesses the elderly people with [[Dementia|senile dementia]] elsewhere in the hospital and uses them to commit the murders. The Gemini Killer forced Dr. Temple to bring Kinderman to him or he would suffer in unspeakable ways — Temple couldn't take the pressure, and he committed [[suicide]].  The Gemini possesses an old woman, who makes a failed attempt to murder Kinderman's daughter. The possessed patient attacks Kinderman, but the attack abruptly ends when a priest, Father Paul Morning ([[Nicol Williamson]]), enters the corridor leading to cell 11 and attempts an exorcism on the patient. The Gemini's "patron" intervenes, taking over the patient's body, and the priest is all but slain. Kinderman arrives in time and attempts to [[Euthanasia|euthanize]] Karras after finding the body of the priest but is hurled into the wall by the possessed Karras. Father Morning manages to briefly regain consciousness and tells Karras, "Damien, fight him." Karras regains his free will briefly and cries to Kinderman,  "Bill, now! Shoot now! Kill me now!" Kinderman fires his revolver several times, hitting Karras in the chest, fatally wounding him. The Gemini is now gone...and Karras is finally free. With weak breaths, he says "We won, Bill. Now free me." Kinderman puts his revolver against Karras' head—and fires.  The film ends with Kinderman standing over Karras' grave.

Joe suddenly becomes the centre of attention.  His family sticks by him, but some seeds of doubt are sown. Eventually he is arrested and sent to trial, but is found not guilty on account of insufficient [[evidence]].  Still, Anne is now increasingly concerned about her father's past, and confronts him.

Fire Birds
 A joint task force operation between the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and the U.S. Army has been formed to dismantle one of the largest drug cartels operating in [[South America]]. Multiple attempts to assault the cartel's mountainous compound have been thwarted by a (fictional) Scorpion-attack [[helicopter]] piloted by a mercenary pilot, Eric Stoller (Bert Rhine). After having several aircraft shot down, most notably a pair of UH–60 Black Hawks and their AH–1 Cobra escorts, the army turns to the new AH–64 Apache attack helicopter, which can match its enemies' maneuverability and firepower.  Pilot Jake Preston ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is subsequently enlisted in the Apache air-to-air combat training program. Earlier, Preston was the sole survivor of a previous air-attack by Stoller. Upon his arrival at the training course, he encounters his ex-girlfriend Billie Lee Guthrie ([[Sean Young]]), who broke off their relationship to pursue a separate career flying OH–58 Kiowa scout helicopters which often work alongside the Apache as target identifiers and designators. Jake's arrogance and loose improvised style quickly earn him the mixed respect and chagrin of veteran pilot and flight instructor Brad Little ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]). During the training schedule, Preston is revealed to be suffering from an [[eye dominance]] disability, which makes it difficult for him to utilize the Apache's visual input. Using an unconventional but effective training method, Little helps Preston deal with his handicap.  A formation of military aircraft consisting of four Apaches and Guthrie's Kiowa, flies down to South America to provide air support for a DEA mission to hunt down and arrest drug cartel leaders. However, they are soon attacked at their base camp, and one Apache is destroyed. With another Apache left to protect the DEA personnel, Preston, Little and Guthrie attempt to seek out Stoller. They soon locate his position, as well as a pair of [[Saab 35 Draken|Draken]] jet fighter aircraft who are also protecting the cartel. Little destroys one aircraft, but is shot down in aerial combat by Stoller. He survives, but his Apache is disabled. Stoller later targets Guthrie, but Preston reaches their coordinates and engages him in a fierce dogfight. Using the Apache's maneuverability near a mountainous peak, Preston manages to trick Stoller into flying past him; then attacks and destroys his helicopter. Meanwhile, Guthrie uses one of the Stinger missiles onboard Little's downed Apache to destroy the remaining enemy aircraft. With no air support, the cartel's defenses cease, and their leaders are later apprehended. As an injured Little is loaded onto a Medevac helicopter, he expresses pride in both Preston and Guthrie.  
Flashback (1990 film)
  Huey Walker ([[Dennis Hopper]]), a [[hippie]] and a former [[New Left]] radical (in the vein of [[Abbie Hoffman]]<ref>[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2010/feature-articles/a-legacy-went-searching-for-a-film%E2%80%A6-dennis-hopper-and-easy-rider/ Senses of Cinema]</ref>) who has been on the run from the law for 20 years for something he did not do, disconnecting [[Spiro Agnew]]'s train car in [[Spokane, Washington]].

Troy’s father, Thomas, was an archaeologist who met his untimely death after becoming involved with a mysterious [[cult]] led by a sinister man with supernatural powers known only as Satoris (Shane Marceau). The orphaned Troy decides to study the map to learn about the circumstances of his father's death.  Sensing the map has been uncovered, the same cultists that killed his father track down Troy. After a failed home invasion, they begin chasing him in a black [[Ford Torino]] as Troy has no choice but ride his bicycle as fast as possible. Eventually, Troy escapes by jumping into the back of a battered pickup truck heading into the Alberta countryside. Soon afterwards, the truck breaks down and Troy meets its owner: an alcoholic drifter named Zap Rowsdower. The two are able to get the truck to run again and Zap eventually warms up to Troy as they head to a nearby town. Upon arriving at a gas station to refuel, Zap phones the police to report finding Troy. As he does this, the cultists slowly approach them and begin to pursue them by vehicle into the countryside, where Zap and Troy are able to lose them.  Later that night, Zap reveals to Troy the origins of the Ziox civilization as well as details about his life before becoming a vagabond. The next morning, the truck stalls and the two are left with no other option than to walk the rest of the way back to civilization, unbeknownst to them that the cultists are still in pursuit.  The two wander through the countryside and through a hidden cave. They find themselves pursued by the cult again as this leads them to the lodge of a shotgun wielding hermit by the name of Mike Pipper (Ron Anderson). A tear in Rowsdower's jacket reveals that he was a member of the same cult that has been after them. Before opening fire on them, Rowsdower calls Troy by his last name to do say something to save them.  Pipper, recognizing the name, reveals that he was a close friend as well as an expedition partner of Troy’s father and has been hiding in the woods from Satoris for the past seven years. He later explains how the cultists are the last descendants of an ancient and advanced race called the Ziox, who had inhabited the area [[solutrean hypothesis|long before the Indians]], and whose civilization was destroyed by their god in a month-long rainstorm after they turned to worshiping unholy idols. According to Pipper, the Ziox built a great city that was more advanced than "anything the ancient Egyptians or Romans ever knew."  He believes that Satoris wants to raise the buried city in hopes that it will restore power to the Ziox and allow him to conquer/rule the entire world. After Zap leaves the two, Pipper  confides to Troy that Rowsdower was with the cult the night Troy’s father was killed and that Zap may have possibly been the one that killed him. In a dream sequence, Rowsdower relives the night the cult’s insignia was [[Human branding|branded]] on his arm, like the other cultists. Satoris seems to be able to torment Rowsdower through the mark, as we see Rowsdower writhing in agony while asleep, presumably having a Satoris-induced nightmare.  Eventually, Troy is captured by Satoris and his cult, who use the map to locate their ancient idol. Satoris means to make Troy the titular final sacrifice. Pipper gives him his horse and a rifle, directing him to the ancient Ziox sacrifice site that he was able to decipher from Troy's map. Rowsdower discovers the site of the idol and duels with Satoris. During the fight, Satoris mocks Rowsdower with the fact that he could not bring himself to kill Troy’s father, implying Satoris had to do it himself. Satoris is about to kill Rowsdower when Troy manages to intervene, shooting the cult leader in the back with Pipper's rifle. Satoris’ death causes the destruction of the idol and the reemergence of the lost city of Ziox, indicating that Satoris was the true final sacrifice. Instead of bringing about evil, the risen city (as Pipper had foretold) is actually a force for good, and Satoris' cult breaks up as its members are freed from his evil influence. Troy and Rowsdower observe the rise of the lost city from the ground, then the two drive off together.

The First Power
 A sadistic [[serial killer]], Patrick Channing ([[Jeff Kober]]), known by most as the Pentagram Killer, is at large in [[Los Angeles]], killing innocent people as a [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to [[Satan]]. His specific [[Modus operandi|MO]] is engraving a [[pentagram]] symbol into the flesh of his victims before killing them.  Detective Russell Logan ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]) is determined to bring the Pentagram Killer to justice. He receives an anonymous phone call from a [[psychic]] called Tess Seaton ([[Tracy Griffith]]). After getting his promise that the man will not be executed, she tells him where the killer is going to strike next. With time running out for the next victim, Logan decides to take Tess on her word. Logan goes on a [[stakeout]] and successfully tracks down Channing's lair. During a struggle in which Logan apprehends Channing, Logan receives a severe stab wound to his torso.  Logan manages to recover from his [[stomach]] [[injury]] and breaks his word, turning Channing over to the [[death penalty]] authorities. Tess makes another phone call to Logan, pleading with him to keep his promise that Channing not be executed. Logan refuses, satisfied that Channing is now caught and cannot harm another person and, therefore, is not interested in sparing the serial killer from what he believes is a much-deserved fate. Channing is later convicted and sentenced to be executed in the [[gas chamber]]. However, since Channing was a worshipper of Satan, Satan seemingly grants Channing ''The First Power'' -- [[resurrection]]. This is the first of three special powers Channing is attempting to gain, and is directly stated in the movie that [[Jesus Christ]] also possessed all three of these powers. Channing returns from the grave and is able to appear or disappear at will, as well as possess others. His main objective now becomes to get his revenge on Russell Logan as well as continue his work. Logan must then team up with Tess in order to find a way to defeat Channing once and for all. The climax of the film takes place at an unused part of a water treatment plant where Logan finds Tess after she was kidnapped from his apartment by Channing. Logan and Channing fight,(while Channing is possessing a nun), resulting in Channing getting stabbed in the chest with a crucifix that has a knife hidden in it which is the only thing that will kill him. A police officer shoots and wounds Logan after he thought Logan was attacking a nun. Tess visits Logan in the hospital, where he wakes up and attacks her. She wakes up to realize that she was having another psychic vision of Channing possessing Logan, and she hears Channing's voice taunting her with the same line he used throughout the film to taunt Logan. This suggests that Channing's spirit is still free and roaming around.  
Fire, Ice and Dynamite

The Field (film)
 Bull McCabe, an Irish farmer, dumps a dead donkey in a lake. It transpires that McCabe's son, Tadhg, killed the donkey after discovering it had broken into the field the family has rented for generations. The donkey's owner blames Bull McCabe for the death and demands "blood money".  McCabe has a deep attachment to the rented field, which his family has cultivated and improved, from barren to now very productive, over a number of generations. The field's owner is a widow who, around the time of the 10th anniversary of the death of her husband, decides to sell the field. She decides to sell the field by public auction rather than to McCabe directly. Unknown to McCabe, Tadhg has been harassing the widow for years, causing her to believe that McCabe is behind the harassment in order to force her into a sale. On hearing there will be an auction McCabe goes to the village pub and announces that nobody would dare bid against him for "my field".  McCabe has constant doubts about Tadhg's ability to safeguard the field. His older son, Seamie, committed suicide when he was 13. McCabe blames himself for the death, as he told Seamie the field could only support one family, and that Tadhg would have to emigrate when he grew up. McCabe and his wife have not spoken in the 18 years since the death.  Peter, an American whose ancestors are from the area, arrives in the village. He has plans to build a hydro-electric plant in the area and quarry stone for new roads. Central to his plans is McCabe's field. At the auction Peter repeatedly out-bids McCabe, forcing the price up to 80 pounds, 30 pounds more than what McCabe can afford. Seeing the bidding war the widow stops the auction and insists there would be a new auction, with a reserve price of 100 pounds. Knowing he cannot out bid Peter and seeing his cattle thrown off the field, McCabe goes to the [[rectory]] to confront Peter, and the [[parish priest]] who has been supporting him. McCabe now discovers Tadhg's actions, expelling him from the meeting, and goes on to explain his deep attachment to the field. This includes the death of his mother while saving hay.  Peter refuses to back down from his plans. In a desperate last attempt McCabe and Tadhg confront Peter at a waterfall he has just purchased, the night before the second auction. When Tadhg fails to defeat Peter in a fight, McCabe himself intervenes and beats both men in a rage. Peter is killed, and upon realising this, McCabe has a mental break. He confuses Peter with his dead son Seamie. Tadhg flees to the [[Irish Traveller]] woman he has fallen for. He tells her he has killed Peter, and they make plans to run off together. McCabe's close friend Bird O'Donnell bids on behalf of McCabe and secures the field for 101 pounds at the second auction, unopposed.  A Traveller boy spots the dead donkey floating in the lake and a crane is brought in to recover it. It inadvertently recovers the corpse of Peter. At the same time Tadhg comes home to tell his father he is leaving with the Traveller's daughter and says he never wanted the field. The Parish priest arrives to confront McCabe about the discovery of Peter. Having lost his son and with the corpse discovered, McCabe goes insane and herds his cattle to the cliffs. Bird informs Tadhg that his father has gone mad. Tadhg rushes to stop his father but gets driven over the cliff by the herd of cattle and killed. Further maddened with grief, McCabe attempts to drive the waves back from his dead son, while Tadhg's mother and the Traveller's daughter sob on the clifftop.

As soon as Clark steps out of the car, Victor drives off with Clark's luggage still in the trunk.  Clark tells his instructor at NYU, Professor Fleeber ([[Paul Benedict]]), who uses books he has written as required study, about losing his belongings. Clark notices Victor walking by and gives chase. Victor vows to give his luggage back in return for a favor. Clark is introduced to Victor's uncle, Carmine Sabatini ([[Marlon Brando]]). In a running gag, Clark mentions how much Carmine looks, sounds and acts like ''[[The Godfather]]''—though no one will tell Carmine this to his face. Victor explains that Brando's character in ''The Godfather'', [[Vito Corleone]], was based on Carmine.  Carmine offers Clark the opportunity to make a lot of money just for running small errands. The first is to pick up a [[Komodo dragon]] from [[JFK Airport]] and transport it to a specific address. Clark enlists the help of his roommate Steve Bushak ([[Frank Whaley]]) to pick up the animal and deliver it to Larry London ([[Maximilian Schell]]) and his assistant, Edward ([[BD Wong]]).  Clark is also introduced to Carmine's daughter, Tina ([[Penelope Ann Miller]]), who takes an immediate shine to him. Tina talks as if the two are soon to be married. A distracted Clark tries to pay attention in Fleeber's film class (where the professor shows clips of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'') but he is soon being chased by two agents of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].  Upon being caught, Clark is told that Carmine—also known as "Jimmy The Toucan"—is not only a [[American Mafia|Mafia]] figure, he runs the Fabulous Gourmet Club. It is an illicit and nomadic establishment, never holding its festivities in the same place twice, where for enormous prices [[endangered species|endangered]] animals are served as the main course, specially prepared by Larry London. Clark is told that "for the privilege of eating the very last of a species", a million dollars is charged.  Clark finds out that his activist stepfather listened in on a conversation with his mother. Right after Clark mentioned the Komodo dragon, Dwight contacted the Department of Justice. Carmine admits that the Gourmet Club exists, but tells Clark that the two DOJ agents are being bribed by a rival crime family that wants both Carmine and Clark dead. While driving to the Gourmet Club, a plan is hatched to get Carmine out of the exotic animal business for good and to clear Clark.  At the Gourmet Club's dinner, longtime [[Miss America]] pageant host [[Bert Parks]] sings a version of "There She Is" when the Komodo dragon is revealed. Clark steps outside to signal the DOJ agents, who raid the club. Carmine is upset that Clark has ratted him out. Carmine pulls a gun, the two wrestle and a shot fells Carmine.  The two DOJ agents, who do indeed turn out to be corrupt, leave with a duffel bag filled with money, though they are soon caught by real [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents and arrested. Clark berates his stepfather, who leaves. Carmine then gets up off the floor, having faked his death. Larry London reveals tonight's expensive and exotic dinner is actually Hawaiian tigerfish mixed with smoked turkey from Virginia, not endangered species (a long-running con of Carmine's, swindling the rich out of their money). Clark was hand-picked by Carmine, working with the FBI, because they knew Clark's stepfather would contact the corrupt agents once he found out about Clark's "job".  Tina's aggressive interest in Clark was an act as well, but she and Clark now share a mutual attraction. Carmine and Clark take the Komodo dragon for a walk, Carmine promising it will be taken safely to a new habitat at the zoo. He offers to help Clark make it in [[Hollywood]], having a few connections there. Clark says, "Thanks, but no thanks."

Molly gives Willie's address to Carl; she then goes to the police, who have no file for Willie but they show her Oda Mae's lengthy one as a forger and con artist.  Meanwhile, Sam follows Carl and is devastated to learn he and Willie are working together. Carl is [[money laundering|laundering money]] for drug dealers and he had Willie rob Sam to get his apartment key, which Carl uses to obtain Sam's book of passwords and transfer the money into a single account under the fictitious "Rita Miller".

He makes a tender offer to buy the Vatican's 25% share in the company, which will give him controlling interest. Immobiliare's board quickly approve the offer, pending ratification by the Pope.  [[Don Altobello]], an elderly New York Mafia boss and Connie's godfather, tells Michael that his partners on [[The Commission (mafia)|the Commission]] want in on the Immobiliare deal. Michael wants the deal untainted by Mafia involvement and pays off the mob bosses from the sale of his Las Vegas holdings. Zasa receives nothing and, declaring Michael his enemy, storms out.

After the Pope dies, Cardinal Lamberto is elected as [[Pope John Paul I]], and the Immobiliare deal is to be ratified. The plotters against the ratification attempt to cover their tracks. Vincent tells Michael that Altobello is plotting to have Mosca assassinate Michael. Michael sees that his nephew is a changed man and names him the new Don of the Corleone family, telling him to adopt the Corleone name. Vincent ends his romance with Mary.

In attempting to shoot Michael outside the opera house, he kills Mary. Vincent kills Mosca. Michael cradles Mary and screams in agony.  Years later, an elderly Michael sits alone in the garden of Don Tommasino's villa and suddenly slumps over in his chair, falling to the ground.  
Ghost Dad
 Elliot Hopper ([[Bill Cosby]]) is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car. After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by [[Satanism|Satanist]] Curtis Burch ([[Raynor Scheine]]), who drives erratically and speeds out of control. Attempting to get the taxi stopped, Elliot announces that he is [[Satan]] and commands him to stop the taxi. Shocked to see his "Evil Master", Burch drives off a bridge and into the river.  Elliot emerges from the accident scene, only to learn that he is a ghost when a police officer fails to notice him and a speeding bus goes straight through him. When he gets home he discovers that his three children can see him, but only in a totally dark room, and they can't hear him. He struggles to tell them what happened when he is whisked away to London by paranormal researcher Sir Edith ([[Ian Bannen]]), who tells him he is a ghost who has yet to enter the afterlife because "they screwed up"; his soul will not cross over until Thursday.  The pressures of work and family life lead to many comedic events, as Elliot attempts to get a life insurance policy and complete his company's merger, so his family will be provided for once he crosses over. One day, he must choose between staying in an important work meeting and helping his son with a magic trick at school. He eventually decides that his family's happiness is more important and walks out on his furious boss, Mr. Collins ([[Barry Corbin]]), who later smugly fires him. Dejected, Elliot reveals himself as a ghost to his love interest, Joan ([[Denise Nicholas]]), whose initial shock soon turns to sympathy.  Edith arrives from London to announce that Elliot is not dead; his spirit jumped out of his body in fright. They also work out that the only previous known case of this happening was Elliot's father. In the excitement to find Elliot's body to reunite his spirit with it, Diane trips on a pair of skates that her little sister Amanda left on the stairs; she falls and is seriously injured. The family rush her to the hospital where her spirit has also jumped out of her body. As she delightedly flies around, Elliot begs her to re-enter her body; his own has started to "flicker". When he collapses, Diane becomes concerned and races into the intensive-care unit to find her father's body. She helps him into the room and they discover that Burch had swapped wallets with Elliot, meaning Elliot was wrongly identified by the hospital as Burch. Elliot returns to his body and wakes up; Diane does the same and jumps off the operating table to tell the family what has happened.  As the reunited family leave the hospital, Elliot spots a yellow taxi parked outside and Burch behind the wheel. Delighted to see his "Evil Master", Burch returns Elliot's wallet and tells Elliot he will do whatever Elliot commands.  Elliot commands Burch to go to hell and sit on red-hot coals waiting for him "[[wiktionary:when Hell freezes over|until it snows]]". Curtis agrees enthusiastically and drives off while Elliot, Joan, Edith and the family leave the hospital.

Grasshoppers (Cavallette)
 In the course of 9 minutes, Grasshoppers takes us through the following parts of history: * The discovery of fire, and the development of tools and weapons, which Modern Man uses to remove the threat of the larger but less intelligent [[Neanderthal]]; * [[Ancient Egypt]]: an animal worshipper clashes with a [[Akhenaten|sun-worshipper]]; * A tragedy in [[Ancient Greece]], where a dancer and a musician fall in love and are killed by a king, who is then attacked and defeated by the Roman Empire; * [[The Roman Empire]], represented by a single "[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]-like" figure, who repeatedly sends troops off to plunder the cultures at the fringes of the empire, until they eventually come back to defeat the now lazy, unprepared later Empire. The birth of [[Jesus Christ]] is also alluded to, but it only distracts the warring parties for a split second; * The continual fight for supremacy between the monarchies of medieval Western Europe (including an allusion to [[Joan of Arc]]); * The rise of [[Islam]], leading eventually to the [[Crusades]]; * [[Genghis Khan]]'s siege of China, and the construction of the [[Great Wall]]; * The [[Spanish conquest]] of the Americas; * The [[French Revolution]]; * The British/French Wars (possibly the wars of the First and [[Second Coalition]]); * [[The American Revolution]]; * The [[Napoleonic Wars]]; * The United States' systematic removal of Native Americans; * [[World War II]] and [[Nazi Germany]], which leads to the [[Nuclear Age]] (a bright white flash from off-screen vaporizes [[goose-step]]ping Nazis, though not a literal occurrence, like many events in the cartoon, a metaphor for the fact that the [[atomic bomb]] effectively ended World War II, and ushered in a frightening new era); * Recent years, up to the present day (1990, the year of the cartoon), which encompasses the [[Cold War]], the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and/or [[Korean War]]s, and the continual skirmishing that occurs still today, between every nation, organization, and individual.  As the centuries (and later decades) pass, the pace of the animation grows gradually faster and more frantic.  At the beginning and end of the cartoon, and occasionally in between vignettes, the cartoon abandons the struggles of humanity to focus briefly on a shot of grass growing and insects buzzing over the ruins of previous battles. In the final shot, the camera finally zooms in tighter on the grass to allow us to glimpse two [[grasshopper]]s happily mating.  
Graveyard Shift (1990 film)
 When an abandoned textile mill is reopened, several employees meet mysterious deaths. The only link between the killings is that they all occurred between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.—the graveyard shift. The sadistic mill foreman ([[Stephen Macht]]) has chosen newly hired drifter John Hall ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) to help a group clean up the mill's rat-infested basement. The workers find a subterranean maze of tunnels leading to the cemetery—and a giant bat that hunts at night. In the end, Hall is able to kill the giant bat when it gets caught in the grinding wheels of a cotton picker and is crushed to death.  
The Golden Boat
 ''The Golden Boat'' is inspired by American police series, mixed with Mexican soaps operas, and immersed in the artistic context of the Underground Art scene of the early 90’s of New York. In the street, a young student of philosophy and criticism at Village Voice, Israel Williams, meets Austin, an old man hurt and desperately in love with a soap opera star. Although he was stabbed several times, Austin does not seem to be affected by his injuries and refuses to go to see a doctor. He asks Israel to help him find his alienated son. Things get complicated when Israel discovers that the old man turns out to be a murderer. Israel is soon losing itself in a strange world populated by international celebrities, Marxist employees, and postmodern literary critics.<ref name="lecinemaderaoulruiz.com"/>  Shortly summed up as an absurdist odyssey through downtown Manhattan with a sweet old serial killer, a student rock-music critic, and international bohemians. The film is centered around the curious student Israel and the knife-happy Austin. Criminals in the film are desensitized and/or numb, with themes centralized around death, confusion, craziness, cowardice and loneliness. There are certainly more questions raised than answers given and the narrative seems to unfold in a way that parallels the narrative that is life. The film is primarily shot in color during which the audio, or music, seems to undermine the visuals through a technique of cutting in and out quickly. Ruiz jumps back and forth quite a bit from color to black and white visuals, during which the music seems to play a different role, for during the black and white shots the music seems to add to the visuals in a hyper-melodramatic way.

Green Card (film)
 Brontë Parrish ([[Andie MacDowell]]), a [[Horticulture|horticulturalist]] and an [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]], enters into a [[sham marriage]] with Georges Fauré (Depardieu), an [[Alien (law)|illegal alien]] from France, so he may obtain a green card. In turn, Brontë uses her fake marriage credentials to rent the apartment of her dreams. After moving in, to explain her spouse's absence, she tells the doorman and neighbors he is conducting musical research in Africa.  Contacted by the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] for an interview to determine if her marriage is legitimate, Brontë tracks down Georges, who is working as a waiter. Although the two have little time to get their facts straight, the agents who question them appear to be satisfied with their answers. But when one of the agents asks to use the bathroom and Georges directs him to a closet, their suspicions are aroused, and they schedule a full, formal interview to be conducted two days later at their office.  Advised by her attorney she could face criminal charges if their deception is uncovered, Brontë reluctantly invites Georges to move in with her. They try to learn about each other's past and their quirks and habits but quickly find they can barely tolerate each other. Georges is a fiery-tempered selfish slob and smoker who prefers red meat to vegetarian food, while Brontë is shown as  uptight and cold, obsessed with her plants and wrapped up in [[Environmentalism|environmental issues]].  Brontë's best friend Lauren Adler's parents plan to leave New York City and may donate their trees and plants to the Green Guerrillas, a group overseeing the development of inner city gardens. Brontë is invited to a dinner party to discuss the issue and discovers Georges is there, having been asked by Lauren. He so impresses the Adlers with an [[Impressionist music|impressionistic]] [[piano]] piece set to a poem about children and trees that they agree to donate their plants to the Green Guerrillas. When Brontë's parents later arrive at the apartment for an unannounced visit, Georges pretends to be the [[handyman]].  When Brontë's boyfriend Phil returns from a trip, Georges reveals he is her husband. Brontë angrily kicks Georges out, but the pair nonetheless appear at the immigration interview the next day. The two are questioned separately, and when Georges is caught out by the interviewer, he confesses the marriage is a sham. He agrees to [[deportation]] but insists Brontë not be charged for her role in the charade. He lets Brontë believe the interview was a success and the two go their separate ways.  A few days later, Georges invites Brontë to join him at the cafe where they first met. When she notices one of the immigration agents is seated nearby, she realizes Georges is being deported, and finally aware she loves him, tries to stop him from leaving. Georges promises to write every day asking the same question "When are you coming, Cherie?", a line he had also used when describing their fabricated courtship to the INS. Then, Georges is deported back to France, just as they have admitted their love for each other.  
The Grifters (film)
 Lilly Dillon is a veteran con artist. She works for a [[bookmaker]], Bobo Justus, making large cash bets at race tracks to lower the odds of longshots. On her way to [[La Jolla]] for the horse races, she stops in Los Angeles to visit her son Roy, a small-time grifter whom she has not seen in eight years. She finds him in pain and bleeding internally after one of his victims caught him pulling a petty scam and hit him in the stomach with a bat. When medical assistance finally comes, Lilly confronts the doctor, threatening to have him killed if her son dies.  At the hospital, Lilly meets and takes an instant dislike to Roy's girlfriend, Myra Langtry, who is a few years older than her son. Lilly urges her son to quit the grift, saying he literally does not have the stomach for it. Because she leaves late for La Jolla, she misses a race where the winner was paying 70 to 1. For this mistake, Bobo burns her hand with a cigar.  Myra, like Roy and Lilly, plays all the angles. When her landlord demands payment of late rent, she uses her sex appeal to lure him into bed and forget the rent. She makes a similar offer to a jeweller to get what she wants for a gem she is trying to pawn.  Upon leaving the hospital, Roy takes Myra to La Jolla for the weekend. On the train, she notices him conning a group of sailors in a rigged dice game. Myra reveals to Roy that she is also a grifter and is looking for a new partner for a [[long con]]. She describes her long association with a con man named Cole, and how they took advantage of wealthy marks in business cons, including a greedy oil investor, Gloucester Hebbing. A flashback scene in a plush office building culminates in a fake [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] raid with a fake shooting of Myra to discourage Hebbing from going to the police.  Roy, who insists on working only short-term cons, resists the proposition, fearing she may try to dupe him herself. Myra, seeing Lilly's power over Roy, accuses him of having an incestuous interest in Lilly. Infuriated, Roy strikes her. Myra then plans her revenge. She lets it be known that Lilly has been stealing from Bobo over the years and stashing money in the trunk of her car. Lilly is warned by a friend and flees. Myra follows with the intention of killing her.  Roy is called by an FBI agent to identify his mother's body, found in a motel room with the face disfigured by a gunshot wound. While identifying it as Lilly's, he silently notes that there is no cigar burn on the corpse's hand. Coming back home, he finds Lilly trying to steal all of his money. Lilly reveals that she shot Myra in self-defense at the motel and arranged the scene to appear as though Myra's body was actually Lilly's. Roy refuses to let Lilly depart with his money. Lilly pleads with him, then attempts to seduce him, even going so far as to tempt Roy by claiming he is not really her son. Roy rejects her, disgusted. Angered, Lilly swings a briefcase at him, unintentionally breaking a glass, sending glass shards into his neck, slashing an artery.  Lilly sobs while she packs up the money as her son bleeds to death on the floor. In the penultimate shot, she is seen dressed in red, riding an elevator that is heading down. Then she gets into Roy's car and drives off into the night.  
The Guardian (1990 film)
 The opening cards explain that ancient [[druids]] [[tree worship|worshiped trees]], sometimes offering them [[human sacrifices]]. Some of these trees were connected with evil.  At the Sheridan home, Molly and Allan Sheridan head off on a trip, leaving their two children in the care of their nanny, Diana Julian. Once alone and with the children sleeping, Diana kidnaps the daughter. Molly realizes she has left her glasses at the house, and upon returning she sees that her daughter is missing. Diana, out in the forest, approaches a giant, old gnarled tree, and holds up the baby, which then disappears from her hands. The roots of the tree show the baby's face, as it has been sacrificed to keep the tree alive. As Diana sits on the ground near a pool of water, her reflection disappears, leaving that of a growling wolf.  Three months later, Phil and Kate Sterling move to [[Los Angeles]], where Phil has gotten a job with an advertising agency. Kate reveals to Phil that she is pregnant; she gives birth to a baby boy, Jake. They decide to hire a nanny so that both parents can continue to work. They interview a number of candidates recommended by the Guardian Angel agency. Two seem most suitable: a young woman named Arlene Russell, and a caring British woman named Camilla Grandier.  After Arlene dies in a bicycling accident, Camilla is hired and quickly becomes an invaluable member of the household. However, one night, Phil has a nightmare where he sees a wolf attacking Jake. Later in the day, Camilla and Jake are outside in a field when she is confronted by three [[gang|gang members]], who chase her and Jake into the woods. After knocking her to the ground, one of the men stabs her and attempts to rape her at the base of the old tree. The tree comes alive and uses its branches to eviscerate the three men, consuming one of them. Camilla sits on a branch above the ground, cradling the baby, while wolves devour one of the men. A giant spike impales the last man, before he is engulfed in flames.  Kate and Phil throw a dinner party, attended by Ned, their neighbor and the architect of the house, and Phil's bosses from work. During dinner, the conversation turns to Camilla and her value to the household. Later in the evening, Ned, who has taken a liking to Camilla, invites her to his house; she politely declines. Phil dreams of having sex with Kate, who suddenly turns into Camilla.  The following night, Kate helps Camilla get dressed up for some window shopping in town. After she leaves, Ned arrives with a bouquet of flowers for Camilla. Kate encourages him to go after Camilla; Ned hops into his truck and catches sight of Camilla heading into the forest. Ned follows on foot, and eventually finds her bathing in the creek. Suddenly she vanishes, reappearing on the giant tree. As she lies naked on a branch, she begins to fuse with the tree bark. Ned is discovered by the pack of wolves, and flees back to his house. While trying to call the police, his phone cuts out. After locking all the doors, he calls Phil and Kate, and leaves a rambling message about what he saw in the forest. The wolves break into the house; Ned runs into the living room and sees Camilla, naked and ashen, on the hearth, warning him that he should not have followed her. The wolves rush in and kill him. Camilla drags Ned's body away, and all traces of his death mysteriously vanish.  Phil wakes up in the night and sees the answering machine beeping. The first message is from a stranger, Molly Sheridan. After leaving her phone number, she says that it is urgent she and Phil speak. The next message is from Ned. As Phil listens to Ned's message, Camilla enters and tells Phil he needs to look at Jake, who appears ill. The following day, Phil goes to the Sheridan house, meeting Molly and her son Scotty. Molly describes the disappearance of her baby daughter. Their former nanny, Diana, disappeared at around the same time. The police have been unable to find any evidence that Diana even exists. She begs Phil to arrange for her to see Camilla, suspecting she is really Diana. Returning home, Phil searches the house for Camilla. Finding no one, he listens again to the message Ned left, warning Phil and Kate not to let Camilla back into their house. Phil rushes over to Ned's house, and finds the door wide open, but no one inside. Phil arrives home where Camilla is with Kate and the baby, and confronts her, telling her to leave his house, during which the baby becomes violently ill; they take him to the hospital, where he displays coma-like symptoms.  At the hospital, Jake awakens, and Phil rushes off to find the doctor. Camilla suddenly appears in the hospital room. She tries to leave with the baby, when Phil blocks her path. He grabs Jake and knocks Camilla to the ground. The Sterlings leave the hospital and head home, to find a wolf standing guard inside. As they slam the door on it, more wolves surround them. Kate runs to their Jeep, and Phil flees into the woods with Jake, where he is chased by Camilla, who [[levitation|levitates]] through the air. Kate drives into the forest, where she finds Phil being confronted by Camilla; she hits Camilla with the Jeep, killing her. As Phil examines Camilla's body, he sees faces of babies embossed in the tree bark.  After a detective tells them that he could find no evidence Camilla ever existed, Kate and Phil decide to leave the house. Phil enters the woods with a chainsaw to cut down the tree; meanwhile, Kate is attacked by Camilla at the house, who appears as part-tree and part-human. When Phil attempts to cut the tree, he is entangled in its branches, which bleed when he saws through them. As Phil attacks the tree, patches of skin start to fall off of Camilla. Camilla drags Kate down the stairs and throws her into the living room. As Camilla approaches Jake, Phil chops off a large branch from the tree, causing Camilla's entire leg to sever from her body. Kate then pushes Camilla out the window. As she falls towards the ground, the tree begins to fall and explodes before landing; Camilla then disintegrates before touching the ground. Phil arrives back at the house, and finds Kate holding Jake.  
Gremlins 2: The New Batch
 After the death of his owner Mr. Wing, the mogwai Gizmo becomes the guinea pig of scientists at Clamp Enterprises, a state-of-the-art office building in [[Manhattan]], run by eccentric billionaire Daniel Clamp. At the mercy of the chief researcher Dr. Catheter, Gizmo is rescued by his friend Billy Peltzer and his fiancée Kate, both of whom work for the company. Clamp befriends Billy upon being impressed by his skills in concept design, also sparking the interest of Billy's superior Marla Bloodstone. Gizmo is left in the office, where water spills on his head and spawns four new mogwai (George, Lenny, Mohawk and Daffy) who then lock Gizmo in the vents. They eat after midnight, turning into gremlins.  After Gizmo finds a way out of the vent, Mohawk tortures him by beating him, shocking him with an electrical wire, putting him in the photocopier, putting Velcro strips on him and ripping them off, and finally ramming him with a toy train while the other gremlins cause the [[fire sprinkler]]s to go off and spawn a gremlin army that throws the building into chaos. Billy attempts to lure the gremlins into the lobby, where sunlight will kill them; after Billy briefs Clamp on gremlin knowledge, Clamp exits through a secret tunnel to cover the front of the building in a giant sheet to trick the creatures. The gremlins devour serums in the lab; one becomes the intelligent Brain Gremlin, who plans to use a "genetic [[sunscreen|sunblock]]" serum to immunize them to sunlight. One gremlin turns into a female, while a third becomes pure electricity and is trapped in Clamp's [[answering machine]] by Billy. All the while "Grandpa Fred" films the chaos on camera with help from a Japanese tourist named Mr. Katsuji.  Murray Futterman, Billy's neighbor from Kingston Falls who is visiting [[New York City]], encounters a bat-hybrid gremlin and covers it with cement, effectively turning it into a gargoyle. Murray realizes that he is not crazy and that he has to help; when Clamp escapes the building using his secret route, Murray uses it to sneak inside to aid Billy. Billy and chief of security Forster team up, but Forster is stalked and chased off by the female gremlin. Mohawk finishes torturing Gizmo and devours a spider serum, transforming into a monstrous half-gremlin, half-spider hybrid. He attacks Kate and Marla, but Gizmo confronts Mohawk and kills him with an ignited bottle of [[Correction fluid|white-out]]. Outside, a rainstorm frustrates Clamp's plan as the gremlins gather in the building's foyer, singing "[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]".  Billy formulates a plan to kill the Gremlin army: Mr. Futterman sprays the army with water while Billy releases the electric gremlin, electrocuting them. Clamp charges in with the police and press, but sees the battle is over; he is so thrilled by the end result that he gives Billy, Kate, Fred, and Marla promotions and hires Mr. Katsuji as a cameraman. Billy and Kate then return home with Gizmo. Forster notifies Clamp that he's trapped at the highest floor of the building. The female gremlin corners him and entices him to marry her.  
The Green Man (Amis novel)
 As the novel unfolds, Allington is beset by a number of difficulties, including his father's death by stroke at dinner one night, and a drinking problem that causes [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] [[jactitation (medicine)|jactitation]] and hallucinations; Maurice compounds his problems by pursuing an affair with his doctor's wife, neglecting his daughter Amy (whose mother, Maurice's first wife, was killed in a road accident), and attempting to seduce both his current wife and his mistress into a [[ménage à trois]], which backfires when the two women take an enthusiastic interest in each other and effectively shut him out of the orgy.  During this time Maurice begins to see ghosts around the inn – a red-haired woman, presumably Underhill's wife, in the hallway, a small bird floating above his bathtub, the spectre of Thomas Underhill himself in the dining room – and yet has a difficult time communicating this to his family and friends, who assume that heavy drinking and the stress of his father's death are causing him to hallucinate. Maurice's own investigations take him to All Saints' College, a fictional [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] college (modeled on [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls']] of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]) of which Underhill was a fellow, and at which his papers are secreted. There he sees Underhill's own record of having used his black arts to entice and then ravish young girls from the village.  In the meantime Maurice has discovered his own notes of a drunken, and forgotten, midnight conversation with Underhill, during which Underhill begins to enlist Maurice's help in his as yet undisclosed scheme. This involves Maurice's unearthing of Underhill's nearby grave, in which he finds an ancient silver figurine that Underhill requests be brought to another midnight meeting in the inn's dining room.  That afternoon, having left the scene of the failed orgy, Maurice suddenly finds himself in a strange time warp, as it were, in which all molecular motion outside his drawing room ceases. He finds himself in the presence of a young, suave man who it comes to be understood is God himself. The purpose of the visit is to warn Maurice against Underhill and ask him to aid in Underhill's destruction, but during the conversation, Amis has the young man elaborate an interesting sort of theology, explaining the Creation and God's powers within it. The young man leaves Maurice with a silver crucifix, as a sort of counter-weight to the silver figurine.  When the midnight meeting comes about, Underhill attempts to delight Maurice with a sort of holographic yet primitive pornography show; Maurice feels he is in a damp, murky cave, on the walls of which are projected bizarre sexual scenes. As the show becomes more terrifying, Maurice realises that Underhill has absented himself; when he hears his daughter crying out from the road in front of the inn, he realises Underhill's intentions. In the climactic scene, Maurice uses the crucifix to stun Underhill and runs outside, where he confronts the entity Underhill had used the figurine to conjure: the green man, a collocation of branches, twigs and leaves in the form of a large and powerful man. The thing is bent, evidently, on killing Maurice’s daughter Amy. By hurling the figurine back into the graveyard Maurice saps Underhill’s power and destroys the green man. Underhill’s purpose had been, apparently, to have Amy killed as a sort of experiment in lieu of the sexual depredations which are now forbidden him by his lack of corporeality.  A final scene wraps up the novel’s loose ends: Maurice destroys the figurine, and he employs the modish, cynical and repellent parish priest (who makes God out to be, in the young man’s words, a “suburban Mao Tse-tung”) to exorcise Underhill and his green man. Maurice’s wife leaves him (for his mistress), but his daughter proposes, and he agrees to, a plan to move away from The Green Man and get a fresh start. Maurice is somewhat relieved, while recognising that he will remain until his death trapped in all of the faults, petty and otherwise, that constitute him as Maurice Allington.

 In the near future, war rages across the Republic of Gilead—formerly the United States of America—and pollution has rendered 99% of the population sterile. Kate is a woman who attempts to emigrate to Canada with her husband and daughter. As they take a dirt road, the Gilead Border Guard orders them to turn back or they will open fire. Kate's husband uses an automatic rifle to draw the fire, telling Kate to run, but he gets shot. Kate gets captured, while their daughter wanders off into the back country, confused and unaccompanied. The authorities take Kate to a training facility with several other women, where she and her companions receive training to become Handmaids—concubines for one of the privileged but barren couples who run the country's religious fundamentalist regime. Although she resists being indoctrinated into the cult of the Handmaids, which mixes [[Old Testament]] orthodoxy with scripted group chanting and ritualized violence, Kate is soon assigned to the home of "the Commander" (Fred) and of his cold, inflexible wife, Serena Joy. There she is named "Offred"—"of Fred".  Her role as the Commander's latest concubine is emotionless. She lies between Serena Joy's legs while being raped by the Commander in the collective hope that she will bear them a child. Kate continually longs for her earlier life, but she is haunted by nightmares of her husband's death and of her daughter's disappearance. A doctor tells her that many of Gilead's male leaders are as sterile as their wives.

The wicked [[Queen (Snow White)|Queen]] has been vanquished and the kingdom is at peace as Snow White and the Prince prepare to marry. Meanwhile, back at the castle, the Queen's animal like minions are celebrating their freedom by throwing a party for themselves. Then, the Queen's equally evil [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] brother, Lord Maliss, arrives at the castle, wondering where his sister is. After learning about his sister's demise, he vows to avenge her death.  In the process, he transforms into a [[wyvern]] and decides to take control of the palace, while Scowl, (a red colored owl) starts training his companion, a purple bat named Batso, on how to be evil.  The next day, Snow White and the Prince are in the meadow picking flowers for their wedding, when suddenly Lord Maliss, in his dragon form, begins attacking Snow White and the Prince as they are traveling to the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. He targets the Prince, but Snow White manages to flee.  Snow White reaches the cottage and meets the Dwarves' female cousins, the Seven "Dwarfelles": Muddy, Sunburn, Blossom, Marina, Critterina, Moonbeam, and Thunderella. The Dwarves have left the cottage after they bought another mine in a different kingdom, but the Dwarfelles gladly assist Snow White, taking her to visit [[Mother Nature]] at Rainbow Falls. Mother Nature has given the Dwarfelles individual powers to assist her; she holds Thunderella accountable for not being able to master her powers correctly, and accuses the other Dwarfelles of improperly using their powers, and threatens to take them away as punishment. Lord Maliss attacks them, but Mother Nature shoots him with lightning, causing him to crash and return to his human form. Before leaving, Lord Maliss informs Snow White that the Prince is held captive in his castle.  Snow White and the Dwarfelles travel to Lord Maliss' castle in the Realm of Doom, along the way encountering a strange cloaked humanoid known as the "Shadow Man." Lord Maliss sends his one-horned wolves after the group, and they manage to escape with the help of the "Shadow Man." Lord Maliss is furious at this failure and transforms into his dragon form, finally capturing Snow White successfully himself and taking her to the castle. The Dwarfelles follow them and sneak into the castle as well.  In the castle, Snow White is reunited with her Prince, who begins exhibiting strange behaviors, and takes her through a secret passage to supposedly escape. When Snow White realizes that he's not the real Prince but is actually Lord Maliss in disguise, he attempts to throw a magical red cloak on Snow White to petrify her into stone. He almost succeeds, but is attacked by the "Shadow Man." The Dwarfelles arrive and attack Lord Maliss as well, but fail and become petrified themselves. The only one unharmed is Thunderella, who finally regains control of her powers and assists Snow White to subdue Lord Maliss. The cloak is thrown on him and Lord Maliss is petrified in mid-transition between his human and dragon form.  As the sun shines onto the castle, the Dwarfelles are restored back to their normal selves. Snow White tearfully mourns the "Shadow Man", believing that she lost both him and her Prince, until Mother Nature arrives at the scene. Suddenly, the "Shadow Man" wakes up and he turns out to be the Prince; as he is waking up he begins comforting Snow White, telling her not to cry, and she notices that he is back to his normal self. The Prince reveals that Lord Maliss had cast a spell on him and he has been watching over Snow White during her journey, guarding her with his life.  Mother Nature decides to let the Dwarfelles keep their powers because they have finally proven themselves by working together as one, and she allows them to attend Snow White's wedding. In the end, Mother Nature takes in Batso and Scowl to be trained as her new apprentices.

Hard to Kill
 In 1983, Mason Storm, a Los Angeles police detective, investigates a mob meeting that takes place by a pier. He records a shadowy figure who assures the mob they can rely on his political support. Storm is spotted, but escapes. Unaware that he is monitored by corrupt cops, Mason informs his partner and then his friend Lt. O'Malley that he has evidence of corruption. While he goes shopping, a store is robbed, and one of the robbers shoots the clerk. Mason stops them and goes home, intent on celebrating with his wife, Felicia.  Mason hides the videotape in his house. When he goes upstairs, a hit squad composed of corrupt policemen, including Jack Axel and Max Quentero, break in and proceed to murder Mason's wife and shoot him. Mason's young son, Sonny, hides until the danger passes. The corrupt policemen frame Mason, making it look like a murder-suicide. At the same time, assassins kill Storm's partner. At the hospital, Mason is first pronounced dead, but is then discovered to be alive, although unconscious. To prevent the assassins from finishing the job, Lieutenant O'Malley tells the medics to keep Mason's status a secret.  Seven years later, Mason wakes from his coma. Andy, one of his nurses, makes a phone call, which is intercepted by corrupt police officers. They send Axel to finish the job and kill the nurses to whom Mason might have talked. Mason realizes that he is still in danger, but his muscles have [[atrophy|atrophied]] to where he can barely use his arms. He staggers to an elevator, and when Andy sees her colleagues killed, she helps Mason escape.  Needing time to recuperate, Andy brings Mason to a friend's house, where Mason uses his knowledge of [[acupuncture]], [[moxibustion]] and other meditation techniques to recover his strength. While training, Mason hears a commercial for Senator Vernon Trent and recognizes the voice from the pier. Mason contacts O'Malley, who supplies him with weapons and tells him that his son is still alive—O'Malley adopted Mason's son and sent him to a private school so that he would be out of danger. After O'Malley leaves, Senator Trent's men find the house and attempt to kill Andy and Mason, but Mason gets them both out.  Posing as a real estate agent, Mason recovers the hidden videotape from his old house. He meets O'Malley in a train station, where O'Malley brings Mason's now-teenage son. They do not see each other, because as Mason arrives, O'Malley is already dead, having been shot by Max after giving the tape to Andy for safe-keeping while having provided a distraction for Sonny to get away. When Mason arrives, he sees his son running away from Quentero and Nolan, another corrupt cop working for Trent. Mason catches up with the men, subdues Nolan by breaking his leg and throwing him in a trash bin and fights with Quentero. Mason beats up Quentero and recognizes him as one of the men who took part in the assault on Mason's home and the murder of his wife. Mason then proceeds to snap Quentero's neck, killing him and saving his son. Mason decides to go after Senator Trent at his home.  At the Senator's mansion, Mason sneaks in and manages to eliminate the Senator's men one by one. Mason fights with Axel in the billiard room and avenges Felicia by jamming a piece of pool stick into Axel's neck, killing him. Next, Mason leaves a death taunt to Capt. Hulland, another corrupt cop who betrayed Storm to Trent, and stalks Hulland through the house before cornering the corrupt captain near the fireplace. Mason then strangles Hulland with his necktie, killing him. Mason finally confronts Senator Trent and holds him at gunpoint when the police storm the mansion. However, they reveal that they had already seen the film and knew that Mason was set up, and they arrest Trent instead. Mason is then reunited with Andy and his son and walks off as the image from the videotape is played on the news, showing Trent coming out of the shadows briefly, wondering who is taping him.  ===Original ending=== Originally, the movie ended with Mason actually killing Trent, and some time later Mason, Andy and Sonny attending a funeral for O'Malley.

Hardware (film)
 A nomad scavenger treks through an irradiated wasteland and discovers a buried robot. He collects the pieces and takes them to junk dealer Alvy, who is talking with 'Hard Mo' Baxter, a former soldier, and Mo's friend Shades. When Alvy steps away, Mo buys the robot parts from the nomad and sells all but the head to Alvy. Intrigued by the technology, Alvy begins to research its background. Mo and Shades visit Jill, Mo's reclusive girlfriend, and, after an initially distant welcome where Jill checks them with a Geiger counter, Mo presents the robot head as a Christmas gift.  Jill, a metal sculptor, eagerly accepts the head. After Shades leaves, Mo and Jill argue about a government sterilization plan and the morality of having children. Later, they have sex, while being unknowingly watched by their foul-mouthed, perverted, voyeuristic neighbor Lincoln Weinberg via telescope.  Jill works the robot head into a sculpture, and Mo says that he likes the work, but he does not understand what it represents. Frustrated, Jill says it represents nothing and resents Mo's suggestion that she make more commercial art to sell. They are interrupted by Alvy, who urges Mo to return to the shop, as he has important news about the robot, which he says is a M.A.R.K. 13. Before he leaves, Mo checks his Bible, where he finds the phrase "No flesh shall be spared" under Mark 13:20, and he becomes suspicious that the robot is part of a government plot for human genocide. Mo finds Alvy dead of a [[cytotoxin]] and evidence that the robot is an experimental combat model capable of self-repair; Alvy's notes also indicate a defect, a weakness to humidity. Worried, Mo contacts Shades and asks him to check on Jill, but Shades is in the middle of a drug trip and barely coherent.  Back at the apartment, the robot has reassembled itself using pieces of Jill's metal sculptures and recharged by draining her apartment's power network. It attempts to kill Jill, but she traps it in a room after the apartment's doors lock. Lincoln sees the robot close the blinds while trying to peep on Jill, and, after he briefly manages to open the apartment door and sexually harasses her, offers to override the emergency lock that traps them in her apartment. Lincoln dismisses her warnings of a killer robot, and, when he attempts to open Jill's blinds so that he can more easily peep on her, the M.A.R.K. 13 brutally kills him. Jill flees into her kitchen, where she reasons that her refrigerator will hide her from the robot's infrared vision. She damages the robot before Mo, Shades, and the apartment's security team arrive and open fire on it, apparently destroying it.  As Jill and Mo embrace, the M.A.R.K. 13 drags her out a window, and she crashes into her neighbor's apartment. Jill races back upstairs to help Mo, who is alone with the M.A.R.K. 13. Overconfident, Mo engages the robot in battle, and it injects him with the same toxin that killed Alvy. Mo experiences euphoria and a series of hallucinations as he dies. After Jill reenters her apartment, the M.A.R.K. 13 sets her apartment doors to rapidly open and close; the security team die when they attempt to enter, and Shades is trapped outside. Jill hacks into the M.A.R.K. 13's CPU and unsuccessfully attempts to communicate with it; however, she discovers the robot's weakness and lures the M.A.R.K. 13 into the bathroom. Shades, who has managed to quickly jump through the doors, gives her time to turn on the shower. The M.A.R.K. 13 short circuits and is finally deactivated. The next morning, a radio broadcast announces that the M.A.R.K. 13 has been approved by the government, and it will be mass manufactured.

Back at his apartment, he informs Roberta, who had decided to make a life with him, of her husband being still alive. In shock, she leaves on her own to find her husband. Meanwhile, Weil had blown the big game with high rollers, for whom he had been angling since the day he arrived in Havana.  The casino's manager, Joe Volpi ([[Alan Arkin]]), forgives him, knowing he had made rescuing Roberta his priority.  At New Year's Eve, 1959, the insurrection is won by the revolutionaries.

The people pour into the streets, celebrating the victory by trashing the casinos and dancing. Weil and Volpi agree that it is time for them to leave. The next morning, Weil is in a restaurant preparing to depart. He sees Chigwell who informs him that he is working on a new book now, "[[CIA activities in Vietnam|The Cuisine of Indochina]]." Not long after, Roberta shows up to wish him farewell. She sees the bandage on his arm and discovers it had cost him to save her husband for her. They hug goodbye. She remains with the Revolution, and he has been changed by it.  Four years later in 1963, Jack drives down to the [[Florida Keys]] and gazes across the sea toward Havana, hoping to see a boat that might bring Roberta on board.

Cheng visits the [[headquarters]] of the police. She fails to understand how the advanced [[information technology]] improves [[productive efficiency|working efficiency]], but after an experience of a [[lie detection|lie detector]] malfunctioning, she claims that [[machinery|machines]] are unrelialbe while [[human resources]] always come first. Wu expects to [[hospitality|accommodate]] Cheng in a [[hotel]], but due to the travellers' peak season, Cheng and Sheng are unwittingly arranged to stay in a [[motel]] at [[Kowloon Tong]] and accidentally encounter [[pornography|pornographic]] programmes on [[television|TV]] and a vibrating [[bed (furniture)|bed]].  Back at the regional branch, Wong distracts and knocks down the guards and [[prison escape|escapes]]. Cheng [[criticism|criticizes]] the so-called efficiency of the police and refuses to help retrieve Wong. However, [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the CCP]] [[Zhao Ziyang]] [[telephone|phones]] Cheng and threatens her that she will be [[population transfer|expelled]] to the desolate [[Daxinganling]] if she fails to catch Wong (as this may mean she is not a good [[public servant]]).  Cheng then becomes active in tracing Wong and expresses her wish that the Hong Kong police will work under her [[Command and control|command]]. But her proposals of arresting Su will surely be rejected by the [[Secretary for Justice|Attorney General]] as they are violating [[human rights]] and are [[Law of Hong Kong|unlawful in Hong Kong]]. This heightens the disputes between Cheng and CIP Wu.  Dissatisfied by the [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kongers']] hesitation, Cheng goes and confronts Su in his office alone. Su refuses to talk about Wong and expels Cheng. Having known that Cheng may bring him troubles, Su sends his [[henchmen]] to [[assassination|assassinate]] her.  Though Cheng and Hsiao-Sheng are safe, they must be moved to other places for protection. Superintendent Mok (Lam Chung) suggests letting them stay at Wu's house in order to protect and monitor Cheng. Mok claims that their [[joint-venture]] will bring Wu a good [[career|career perspective]] even after the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]].  However Cheng's appearance leads to a micro [[civil war]] between her and Wu's pro-[[Kuomintang]] father, Colonel Wu Tien-Tsu (Lam Kau). Overnight, [[propaganda]] warfare is conducted by them singing patriotic songs through the wall in between. The next [[morning]] at [[breakfast]], they challenge each other in forms of [[military uniforms]] and choice of left(ist) or right(ist) [[appendage]]. Soon they are temporarily [[mediation|mediated]] by Wu, who is [[ambidexterity|ambidextrous]] ([[Neutrality (philosophy)|Neutral]]) wearing a uniform of Hong Kong Police.  Niu gets in contact with his brother and tries to escape from Hong Kong. He contacts Su for help but Su sends henchmen to kill him. Niu survives the shootout, but his brother is injured. A witness of the shootout finds a [[letter (message)|letter]] from his brother telling Niu that he is living at a beautiful village called [[Sau Mau Ping]]. The police thus send [[detectives]] to inquire the villagers about Niu's whereabouts. Cheng, using her [[interpersonal skills]], socializes with the [[Sichuan]]-born villagers and gets the [[Address (geography)|address]] of a [[karaoke bar]] where Niu always goes to. In the karaoke bar, Cheng proves to be a bad [[singer]] but a very good [[alcoholic beverage]] consumer. Shortly afterwards, it is confirmed that Niu regularly meets his lover, Hsuen-Pi ([[Sheila Chan]]), at the bar. The squad then [[Reconnaissance|spy]] on Hsuen-Pi.  Returning home, Cheng finds Hsiao-Sheng wearing a [[National Revolutionary Army]] uniform with Colonel Wu and his fellow [[veterans]], [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. Cheng considers this "[[counter-revolutionary]] behavior" and decides to challenge the veterans on drinking and finally beats them fully conscious. Wu takes Cheng to see the night view of Hong Kong and as they return home on the [[elevator]], Cheng sees the "dark side" of Hong Kong in the terrifying suspension of [[electricity]]. When the lights are on again, they find themselves holding each other's hands. Cheng gets the first taste of [[love]].  In embarrassment, they go on working. This time, Cheng and Hsiao-Sheng decide to pretend to be Niu's [[wife|lawful wife]] and get Niu's contact from Hsuen-Pi. But Niu is actually hiding in Hsuen-Pi's house and after a fight with Cheng, he successfully escapes again.  Later, Wu receives information that Niu will rob a [[jewellery]] shop. Detectives are scattered around the shop to spot Niu but their cover is later revealed as Chan drops his [[revolver]] when he tries to save a girl in the middle of the road. The police and Niu's duet exchange fire in the crowded street and after a long chase they meet each other at a narrow corridor inside a building. Cheng, shoots Niu's partner down with excellent [[marksmanship]] but Niu gets away for the third time.  Frustrated by the situation, Mok offers a three-day limit for Wu and Cheng to arrest Niu. Failure to do so will post Wu to [[Tai A Chau|Tai A Chau Dentention Centre]] and send Cheng back to China.  New information shows that Su is meeting some potential drug dealers in nightclubs and the police need female [[undercover]]s to [[Eavesdropping|listen in]] on their conversations. Cheng voluntarily becomes the undercover and as Su brings her home, he meets Niu. Niu requests three million dollars from Su to flee and claims that the drug stocks stored at San Yik [[Warehouse|Godown]] is worth 20 million dollars. As Su finally kills Niu after a long [[bargaining|bargain]], Cheng escapes Su and goes to the wrong San Yik Godown. Cheng [[interrogation|interrogates]] the keepers of the wrong godown with [[torture]], and gets arrested. She is [[prison|imprisoned]] and ready to be sent back to China.  Wu reads through [[receipts]] of the godowns and finds out the correct Sun Yik Godown for it has stored many seeds of [[cannabis sativa]] for producing marijuana. The squad breaks into the godown and finds actual [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. However, Hsiao-Sheng is caught by the godown workers and their plan is destroyed by Su, holding a [[submachine gun]]. Su and his workers ties up the squad and is about to burn them with [[petroleum]]. Suddenly, the light goes out and the Nationalist veterans appear to save the squad. Wu runs forward and fights with Su. Finally, the situation is under control. While Superintendent Mok arrives and [[daydreaming|daydreams]] about his promotion to [[Commissioner of Police (Hong Kong)|Commissioner of Police]], Cheng and Colonel Wu finally become [[friendship|friends]] and achieve a [[collaboration]] between the Communists and the Nationalists.  At the [[border]], Cheng gives Wu a letter, expressing her apologies for her bad [[Temperament|temper]] and thankfulness during this working tour in Hong Kong. She admits that it is the first time she held a man's hand and this memory is precious. Finally, she looks forward to opportunities for their cooperations after 1997.  
Hello Hemingway
 In 1956, sixteen-year-old Larita lives with her mother and her aunt's family in a ramshackle house outside [[Havana]]. From their garden they can see [[Finca Vigía|Ernest Hemingway's white mansion]]. At home, she adorns her walls with pictures of [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Tony Curtis]], while at school she excels in her [[English language|English]] class. Larita is delighted when her teacher suggests that she enter a competition for a scholarship to attend university in the United States. Larita also happily dates a classmate, Victor, who is trying to establish a student association.  On a visit to a bookshop, she is given a copy of Hemingway's ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', which she starts to read avidly, drawing parallels between the novel and her own life which she records in her diary. At home, her family tease her about her academic aspirations. They resent the fact that while they work hard she studies and contributes nothing to their meager existence. The issue of finances becomes more acute when Larita is sent home from school because she is not wearing the correct school uniform. However, she passes the first round of scholarship exams and is invited to a reception for the finalists. She makes herself as presentable as possible with the help of her relatives' sewing skills and the support of her grandmother, who pawns her treasured earrings to purchase fabric. She tells Victor that she is on the short list for the scholarship, which makes him angry because she has kept it a secret from him and is preparing to go abroad and abandon him for a year. That night Larita returns home to find that her uncle has been fired from his job as a policeman, which has been the family's principal means of support.   At the scholarship interview, her chances appear to be hampered by the fact that she is illegitimate and does not have the right social connections to provide her with letters of recommendation. In desperation, Larita decides to visit Hemingway to see if he will write a reference for her, but she discovers he is away in Africa. Larita bitterly blames her mother for the fact that she is disadvantaged by poverty and illegitimacy. When she stays home from school pretending to be sick, her favorite teacher, Dr. Martinez, visits her and offers encouragement. To Larita's complaints about her poverty she says: "You're not exactly living under a bridge."  Meanwhile, at school, the student protests climax, the atudent association tries to get students to boycott classes, and Victor is arrested.  Later that year, Larita takes a job at a coffee bar. One evening near Easter the scholarship administrator walks by and recognizes her. They establish that they recognize one another, but nothing else is said except the simplest wish from the administrator that Larita enjoy the holiday.

Rather than miss the party of the year, Kid sneaks out while Pop is sleeping in front of ''[[Dolemite]]'' – but the door closing behind Kid awakens Pop. On his way to the party Kid runs into Stab and his brothers, jumps over a fence where a fat man name Roughouse is having sex with his lady,and is shot at along with the three punks by Roughouse. Kid ducks into a nearby Alpha Delta Sigma reunion to escape them.

Kid's father eventually makes his way to the party, demanding to know where Kid is (upstairs helping Sharane get her coat) and, not finding him, Pop vows to wait for him at home. Play stops the party because his bathroom toilet was broken by party members. Although Kid and Sydney have eyes for each other, Sharane decides to flirt with Kid openly, much to Sydney's disgust. The three soon leave the party, but when Kid tries to make advances on Sharane, she rebuffs him. Kid then walks Sydney back home, and after some argument the pair finally calm down and talk quietly.  Sydney allows Kid to sneak into her house, and the two are about to have sex in Sydney's room when she stops him, wanting to know if she is simply his second choice. Kid admits that Sydney was his first choice all along, but they do not do anything when they see that the only condom Kid has is too old to be used. When Sydney's parents come home – now revealed as one of the couples at the high-school reunion, including the man Kid ran into – Sydney hastily helps Kid sneak out of the house. He manages to get out of yet another scrape with Stab and his brothers, and they all end up in a jail cell. The men tell Kid what they're in jail for and Kid entertains the rest of the men in the cell by rapping, distracting them long enough for Play, Sharane, Bilal, and Sydney to arrive with enough cash to bail him out. Later, the five friends say their goodnights. Kid and Sydney share a long passionate kiss goodnight. After Play and Bilal drops him off, Kid sneaks in the house and gets undressed. As he is about to get into bed, he looks up to find Pop holding a belt, as the credits roll, we can hear Pop whacking Kid (Kid yelping with each hit) during the credits.  At the very beginning of the movie, kids are seen dancing inside of a house with the noise being so loud that it literally blows the roof off of the house.  During the credit roll, the same roof flies and lands on top of the policemen in a parking lot.

The Hunt for Red October (film)
 [[File:Typhoon3.jpg|250px|thumb|A Typhoon-class submarine, the same type as the fictional ''Red October'' (twelve meters longer and three meters wider than the standard Typhoons).]]  In November 1984, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[ballistic missile submarine|submarine]] [[Captain 1st rank|captain]] Marko Ramius ([[Sean Connery]]) commands , a new  nuclear missile submarine with a stealth "[[magnetohydrodynamic drive|caterpillar drive]]", rendering it undetectable to passive sonar. Ramius leaves port to conduct exercises with [[Alfa-class submarine|attack submarine]] ''V. K. Konovalov'', commanded by his former student Captain Tupolev ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]). Once at sea, Ramius secretly kills [[Political commissar|political officer]] Ivan Putin ([[Peter Firth]]) and relays false orders that they are to conduct missile drills off America's east coast.    The next morning, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst and [[United States Marine Corps|former Marine]], [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]), after consulting with Vice Admiral James Greer ([[James Earl Jones]]), briefs United States government officials on ''Red October'' and the threat it poses. The U.S. fears Ramius plans an unauthorized nuclear strike against the United States. They also learn that the bulk of the [[Soviet Navy]] has been deployed to the Atlantic. In the briefing, Ryan hypothesizes that Ramius instead plans to [[defection|defect]]. He is ordered to rendezvous with the American attack submarine USS ''Dallas'' to prove his theory. Meanwhile, Tupolev, though unable to track ''Red October'', guesses his former mentor's route and sets a course to intercept. The Soviet fleet's intentions are unknown to the U.S., although their orders are to sink ''Red October''.   Due to the actions of an unknown saboteur, ''Red October''s caterpillar drive fails during risky maneuvers through a narrow undersea canyon. Petty Officer Jones ([[Courtney B. Vance]]), a sonar technician aboard ''Dallas'', has discovered a way to detect ''Red October'' using underwater acoustics, and plots an intercept course. Ryan arranges a hazardous mid-ocean rendezvous to board ''Dallas'', where he attempts to persuade its captain, Commander Bart Mancuso ([[Scott Glenn]]), to contact Ramius and determine his intentions.  The Soviet ambassador informs the U.S. government that Ramius is a renegade, and asks for help in sinking ''Red October''. That order is sent to the U.S. fleet, including ''Dallas'', which has found the Soviet submarine. Ryan, however, is convinced that Ramius plans to defect with his officers and convinces Mancuso to contact Ramius and offer assistance. Ramius, stunned that the Americans correctly guessed his plan, accepts. He then stages a nuclear reactor "emergency", ordering his crew to abandon ship. After a U.S. [[frigate]] is spotted, Ramius submerges. Meanwhile, Ryan, Mancuso, and Jones come aboard via a [[Mystic-class deep submergence rescue vehicle|rescue sub]], at which point Ramius requests [[asylum in the United States]] for himself and his officers.  ''Red October'' is suddenly attacked by ''V. K. Konovalov'', which has tracked them across the Atlantic. As the two Soviet subs maneuver, one of ''Red October''s cooks, Loginov (Arana), an undercover [[GRU]] agent and the secret saboteur, opens fire. He fatally wounds first officer Vasily Borodin ([[Sam Neill]]) before retreating to the nuclear missiles bay, pursued by Ryan and Ramius. Loginov shoots Ramius, wounding him, but Ryan kills Loginov before he can detonate a missile. Meanwhile, ''Red October'' makes evasive maneuvers with a diversion provided by ''Dallas'', causing ''V. K. Konovalov'' to be destroyed by its own fired torpedo. The crew of ''Red October'', now rescued, watch the explosion from the deck of the U.S. frigate; unaware of the second Soviet submarine, they believe that Ramius has sacrificed himself and scuttled ''Red October'' to avoid being boarded.   Ryan and Ramius, their subterfuge complete, navigate ''Red October'' to the [[Penobscot River]] in [[Maine]]. Ramius admits that the reason he defected was that after he was handed the plans for ''Red October'', a nuclear war first strike weapon, he concluded that he could never support such an action. From atop the submarine's [[Sail (submarine)|sail]] deck, Ramius, pleased to have made it to America, offers Ryan a quote from [[Christopher Columbus]]. Ryan nods in agreement and offers in return, "Welcome to the New World, sir".

I Come in Peace
 Houston cop Jack Caine will not let police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission to wipe out the White Boys, a gang of [[white-collar worker|white collar]] [[illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] who killed his partner while Caine was stopping a [[convenience store]] robbery.  The White Boys disguise their [[illegal drug trade|narcotics trafficking]] behind rows of expensive luxury sports cars, executive level jobs, and flashy designer suits. Led by the vicious but urbane Victor Manning, the White Boys operate above accusation but not suspicion. When the White Boys steal a shipment of [[heroin]] from a federal evidence warehouse, they hide evidence of their involvement by  blowing up the facility, killing or injuring numerous people. This brings in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and Caine is partnered with a by-the-book agent Arwood "Larry" Smith. They investigate the drug theft and the later murder of several key White Boys soldiers by a hyper fast spinning disk.  At the same time Caine is made aware - via his girlfriend, [[coroner]] Diane Pallone - of a series of drug-related deaths. The corpses are full of heroin, but the cause of death is a puncture wound to the forehead.  Unknown to Caine and the cops the deaths are caused by an alien who is extracting something from the victims, but is being pursued by Azeck, a similar alien to himself.  The alien Talec mortally injures Azeck who is found by Caine & Smith. Azeck explains that he is a police officer from his own home planet, and that Talec shoots his victims full of synthetic heroin and then uses alien technology to extract the resulting [[endorphins]] from their brains, synthesizing them into a drug called "Barsi" to be used by addicts on his home planet. He warns Caine and Smith that if Talec is not stopped, thousands of intergalactic drug dealers will start to come to Earth to slaughter its population, as Earth is a cheap source of Barsi which is extremely rare in the rest of the galaxy. Azeck dies and his body cremates itself - but Smith has retained Azeck's powerful hand-gun and intends to pass it onto his FBI superior to prove that the aliens exist. Cain warns that Switzer should not be trusted and wants to give the gun to his own Chief Malone.  The two disagree and separate.  Smith gives the weapon to Inspector Switzer, who reveals that they already know about the aliens and intend on opening dialogue with Talec in order to gain technological and weapon advantages.  He then attempts to shoot Smith, but Caine saves him at the last moment.  Thanks to information from Azeck, they track Talec down to an industrial complex but are waylaid by the White Boys who believe Caine to be behind the deaths of their soldiers.  Talec arrives in the middle of the standoff and kills the remaining White Boys before being forced to retreat after Smith uses Azeck's weapon against him.  At the complex Azeck's weapon runs out of charge and Talec attempts to kill Caine using his drug harpoon.  While fending off the harpoon Caine grabs a vial of the synthesized Barsi drug and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat over the vial, resulting in Talec being impaled on a steel spar.  Cain retrieves Talecs gun - a similar weapon to Azeck's - and shoots nearby drums of fuel, killing Talec in the resulting explosion.  With Talec dead Caine & Smith realise that they have completed Azeck's mission and now that Talec won't return to his home planet nobody there will know about Earth.  
I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle
 A [[motorbike gang]] kills an occultist with a crossbow during a satanic ritual. An evil spirit inhabits a damaged bike. Noddy is then seen purchasing that very motorcycle for the price of £1100 from a dealer, but he tells Kim he only paid £600. He proceeds to take it home and fix, with his friend, Buzzer, and girlfriend, Kim, the damage caused by the crossbow by replacing the fuel tank. Buzzer steals the petrol cap for "funsies" but then the bike kills him by decapitation.  It is revealed to the audience that the vehicle has become a bloodthirsty monster. Noddy goes to the scene of the crime where he meets an inspector who smells like garlic. Later, Noddy has a bad dream that the inspector gives him Buzzer's head in a bag and it talks at him but then he wakes up. Then he goes back to sleep and dreams Buzzer is a poo that jumps in his mouth and starts asking how he is. Noddy wakes up again and is chewing his duvet. Noddy and Kim go to the pub and order a large vodka tonic and a pint of cider. Then ten of the bikers from the beginning come in and shoot the bar with the crossbow. One then offers to show Kim his "chopper" while she is playing pool. She declines, claiming not to have brought her magnifying glass. He then proceeds to unsheathe an axe and attack the pool table and moving onto plates, starting a bar wide brawl of 10 bikers against our protagonists. Kim manages to slip out the front and drive the bike round the back of the pub where Noddy jumps on it from the first floor and then gets shot with a crossbow bolt.  They then have Chinese. When Kim orders garlic prawns, the bike goes mad and drives off with her. It takes her under a bridge, throws her off and makes advances on her, until it notices the crucifix around her neck. It drives off back to the pub where Chopper attempts to steal it but the bike stabs him through the leg with a large metal spike, then launches him at some graffiti artists. It then proceeds to exact its revenge on the rest of the gang, decapitating the majority and leaving only Roach with a bolt inserted into his posterior.  Noddy then finds out Kim has been taken to hospital where she describes the bike's advances with a hollow look in her eyes. It is then seen that the inspector is looking at some heads. Noddy then goes to a priest, who also has a motorcycle. There is then several crucifix wipes as they travel to the garage where the bike is kept. The priest is sarcastic and does not believe Noddy. Not wanting to be taken into the sunlight, the bike uses its brake lever to sever the priest's fingers. Determining the bike is a vampire, the priest decides to do an exorcism. Believing the bike will come back for Kim, the priest gives her a crucifix and garlic. The priest throws a shuriken at a fly whilst planning the exorcism and exclaims "Right. Let's go kick some bottom!".  The vampire bike stops Noddy and the priest on the way home by disabling the bike they are riding, so they decide to call a taxi but instead wait for a bus. It is a race against the sun to get to the vampire bike before nightfall when it will be free to roam once more. During the exorcism, the priest is hit in the head with a wrench and Noddy is blown around the room by a mysterious wind, knocking him into cupboards. The priest is then crucified with a crown of barbed wire. Believing to have successfully vanquished the demon, the priest sprinkles holy water, but that only makes the bike angry, growing spikes and glowing red.  Noddy runs off and steals a police motorcycle, dragging the policeman behind him, who is almost run over by the vampire bike. The bike is chased by a police car, while the priest attempts to explain it to the authorities and Kim is washed, having her garlic removed. The bike evades the police by driving vertically down a wall and goes to the hospital to finish off Kim but not before cleaving the tea lady in two. Kim uses her crucifix to scare it away, so it goes after Roach, passing the priest and inspector in the corridor of the hospital. Roach crashes while fleeing and lands in a coffin. He is presumed dead.  The bike then goes for Noddy but gets its front wheel stuck in a bridge, giving Noddy the chance to throw it in a river and spit. Thinking he is safe, Noddy has a victory smoke, but the audience sees a red-light under the water. Noddy then sees it and screams and runs around like a lunatic. He hides in a gym, but the bike doesn't take long to find him and start attacking the patrons with its spikes. Noddy then bashes the bike, which feigns death, making everyone feel safe, until it starts throwing people's limbs in the air. The inspector scares it with his smell. The bike manages to trap Noddy against a wall, but is stopped when Noddy turns on a sun bed. Everyone uses their crucifix and/or garlic breath to force it into the light and it melts. Kim asks how much Noddy really spent on the bike and the priest says they are usually reliable. Back in Noddy's workshop, he accidentally cuts his hand and the blood drips onto the bike's old fuel tank which springs open, leaving the audience begging for a sequel.

Introduction to the End of an Argument
  Footage from newsreels, feature films and documentaries are woven together, loosely organised by title cards, such as 'INTIFADA', 'SPEAKING FOR ONESELF', and 'ABSENCE'. In doing so it reveals Orientalist portrayals of Arabs in the history of cinema, as well as the argument over narratives that exists within the media when discussing the Middle East and in particular, narratives surrounding [[Palestinians]].  
Jetsons: The Movie
 In the late 21st century, Spacely Sprockets and Spindles has opened a new mining colony on an asteroid. The proposed project is meant to increase productivity at 1/10 the cost of making the items on Earth. However, the factory continues to be sabotaged by someone or something. As Cosmo Spacely (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]] and [[Jeff Bergman]]) checks up on the "Orbiting-Ore Asteroid" again, he learns from the plant engineer, Rudy-2, that the latest head of the factory, Alexander Throttlebottom, has run off, making four vice presidents of the new plant that Spacely has lost so far. Fearing for his company (and profits), Spacely names George Jetson (voiced by  O'Hanlon and Bergman) as Throttlebottom's successor and sends George and his family to the plant. While the family is thoroughly upset at being thrown from their normal lifestyle (and the plans that they had coming up that week), they set up apartments on the adjoining apartment community to the asteroid and its neighboring shopping complex, while it takes the family time to adjust.  Rudy-2 (voiced by [[Ronnie Schell]]), shows George around the plant as they prepare for the grand re-opening of the plant. Meanwhile, Judy Jetson (voiced by [[Tiffany Darwish|Tiffany]]) is having a hard time adjusting, and accepting the fact that she lost her chance at a date with rock star Cosmic Cosmo (voiced by [[Steve McClintock]]) (which a friend of hers later takes), but soon feels better after meeting a teenaged boy named Apollo Blue (voiced by [[Paul Kreppel]]). Elroy Jetson (voiced by [[Patric Zimmerman]]) meets Rudy-2's son, Teddy-2 (voiced by [[Dana Hill]]), with whom he first is at odds, but eventually befriends. George soon figures that he is ready to set the plant running again, and Mr. Spacely is all set to see the plant working full-throttle, and soon to churn out the one-millionth Spacely sprocket. However, the opening-day festivities give way to panic as the factory is sabotaged once again. Over the next several days, George and Rudy-2 try to fix things, but the problems persist, to the point that, fed up with the problems and thinking George is responsible, Mr. Spacely heads on up to check on things personally. Thinking he has to take charge, George stays overnight, only to fall asleep and be taken off by the mysterious creatures. Elroy, Teddy-2, and their neighbor Fergie Furbelow (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) sneak into the plant, and meet Squeep (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), a member of a furry alien race known as Grungees.  Squeep tells them (with Teddy-2 translating) that the factory is actually drilling into his people's community, which is based inside the asteroid. Soon, Jane, Judy, Apollo, Rudy-2, and Astro show up, and realize what is happening, as well. George is found hog-tied in the Grungees' colony, and although he soon realizes just what the factory is doing, Spacely does not. Seeing his factory at a stand-still, he starts it up (despite that it is the night and after disconnecting Rudy-2, who tries to stop him), nearly burying Elroy and Squeep alive under rubble, and prompting everyone in the asteroid to get top-side, where George manages to shut down the factory and show his boss exactly what he is doing. After some talk, when George finally stands up to his boss, telling him that all he cares about is money, they come to an agreement: the Grungees will run the plant, and create new Spacely sprockets through recycling old ones (thus stopping the further destruction of the Grungees' homes inside the asteroid).  Spacely Sprockets reaches the millionth sprocket at long last, and when George asks about being vice president, Spacely retorts, stating, "he's lucky that he'll be getting his old job back". Only when pressured by everyone else does he reluctantly promote him to vice president (without a raise). However, George knows that with the Grungees now running the plant, he is no longer needed as head of the asteroid. With heavy hearts, the Jetsons then bid their new friends goodbye, including Fergie, who attempted to stow away aboard the Jetsons' car. They then return home to Earth. As the family passes over the factory, the Grungees arrange themselves to form the words: "THANKS GEORGE", as a grateful goodbye to him for saving their home.

During the same time, a celestial being, Indraja ([[Sridevi]]), the daughter of Lord [[Indra]], happens to visit the Manasa Sarovar. She accidentally drops her ring there. This ring is her passport to Heaven. Raju finds the ring and starts wearing it, oblivious to its divine power. Indraja is unable to enter Heaven as she lost her ring. [[Brihaspathi]], the Deva-guru, instructs her to go back to Earth to retrieve it before the next [[Kartik Poornima]].  In search of the ring, Indraja finds her way to Raju's hometown. Due to her strange language and lack of emotional and social awareness, she is initially considered insane. Her umpteen confessions about her divinity are subject to laughter. Raju and the children take pity on her and provide her shelter in their home. She becomes close to the children and often ends up in trouble trying to take the ring from Raju.  In the meanwhile, Raju is caught up in a moral squabble with an arrogant millionaire, KP ([[Tiger Prabhakar]]). KP's goons launch a series of attacks on Raju and Indraja. Raju overcomes them, unaware that the ring is helping him. KP gets suspicious about Raju's supernatural power.

Mahadrashta discovers that Indraja is a celestial being and wants to sacrifice her to become immortal.  The kids take Indraja on a car ride one day and the car loses control.

When everyone's asleep, Indraja puts on the divine ring and saves the child. Raju realises Indraja's true self and repents for his folly. The two realize that they have fallen in love.  Raju uses the ring's power to scare KP and his goons. During this time, Mahadrashta tries to acquire it from one of the kids by hypnotizing her. A monkey grabs the ring and carries it far away, dropping it in the bowl of [[Kumkum]] at the feet of a statue of [[Hanuman]]. Raju and the kids search for the ring in vain.  Mahadrashta and his men plant false evidence in Raju's home to fabricate the lie that Indraja is a sorceress. Raju and Indraja are pelted with stones and Indraja is carried away by Mahadrashta. The kids discover the ring and Raju sets out to save Indraja. A hypnotized Indraja does not recognize or respond to their calls. Upon coming in contact with the ring, she comes to her senses and destroys KP and his men. Raju kills Mahadrashta, refusing to use the ring, as he believes human power is enough to defeat evil.  The very same evening is [[Kartik Poornima]], the final call for Indraja to return to heaven. Her thoughts are flooded with the loving memories of her time with Raju and the kids. She is caught between her love for Raju and her obligation to return to heaven to remain divine and immortal. Indraja throws away her ring and chooses to go back to Raju to lead a mortal life.

Keladi Kanmani
 The film opens with a bus carrying a group of college students for a trip. Among the students are Anu ([[Anju (actress)|Anju]]) and her girlfriends. The bus is stopped by some masked bandits. They forcibly enter the bus and demand that Anu should kiss their leader Sashi ([[Ramesh Arvind]]); otherwise, they will kill everyone on board. This is subsequently revealed to be a ruse: Sashi is in fact a fellow college student trying to win Anju's affection.  For a few days after, Sashi and Anju play various pranks on each other. Anju eventually admits her affection for Sashi and they begin a courtship. All seems to proceed well, except that Anju is strangely melancholic from time to time; she repeats to Sashi that she senses an imminent danger to their relationship, although she is unable to pinpoint what the threat or describe why it may materialize so soon.  Some things are revealed when Anju begins to get sharp headaches from time to time. Her father, A. R. Rangaraj ([[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam|SP Balasubrahmanyam]]), a quiet widower, tries to help her, but is not able to get to the bottom of the matter. A. R. Rangaraj (known to his friends as ARR) is a gentle old man who has devoted the greater part of his life to his daughter. Things come to a head when, on her 18th birthday, Anu visits her doctor who confirms she has bilateral renal artery stenosis and is almost certain to succumb within a year. She may require an operation within that time, but the likelihood of her coming through it alive is minimal. Anu requests the doctor to keep it between them (and, in particular, not inform her father to avoid deeply saddening him). However, unbeknownst to Anu, her father discovers it by accident when the local pharmacist sends some prescription drugs through him.  When Anu discusses the matter with Sashi, he expresses his support in spite of his grave sadness (in proportion to his love for her). Anu reveals a thread from her past that may explain her melancholic mood.  The film flashes back to several years before, when ARR had a happy family. Anu, then five or six, attended school; ARR handled his job and his loving wife managed the home. Tragedy struck when they lost his wife to an illness. Anu took this particularly hard. Yet, ARR tried to help cope with it somehow and move on. Some time thereafter, ARR met Sharada ([[Radhika]]) at a wedding. Sometime thereafter, ARR sought a tutor for young Anu, and Sharada happened to take the position. The friendship evolved into a courtship, to the point where ARR was about to propose marriage. (During the courtship, ARR sang the song '' Mannil indha kaadhal '' to Sharada. He cheekily prefaced the song with the admission that while he may not be a talented singer, he can certainly hold a tune; and to verify his claim, he proposed to sing the entire song in one breath. Sharada was truly impressed.) As time went on, Sharada realized her own bindings. Both her parents were deaf-mute, and she was the only way they could communicate with the rest of the world, this left her torn between her filial duty and her personal aspirations. Things were worsened when Anu experienced feelings of motherly yearning and was simply unable to accept Sharada (or anyone else for that matter) in the role of a mother. Sharada is bewildered and ultimately frustrated by all this. And in spite of ARR's assurances that they can work it out, she refused his proposal and moved to Bangalore to take a position as a schoolteacher. Since that time, Anu has been plagued by guilt for her part in the breakup.  The doctors pronounce a date and time for the unavoidable operation. Anu takes this with stoic grief, and asks Sashi for one last thing: to find Sharada and attempt to reunite her with ARR. They find an old picture of Sharada, and Sashi recognizes her as the woman he had met in Bangalore a few weeks ago. He sets off on a frantic hunt for Sharada. On the day of the operation, Sharada happens to be in Chennai en route to a training event in the USA. After a tricky set of near-misses, Sashi is able to locate her in the nick of time, and bring her to Anu and ARR moments before Anu gets anaesthetized.  The film ends with Anu going for one last ride with Sashi on his motorbike and right before they leave, Anu mentions that she has gained faith in surviving the surgery, and according to previous circumstances, what she feels is the outcome and so the results are let to the audience.

Kindergarten Cop
 After years of pursuing drug kingpin Cullen Crisp, [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective John Kimble arrests him for murder; a witness saw Cullen murder an informant after getting information regarding the whereabouts of his former wife Rachel Myatt Crisp, who allegedly stole millions of dollars from Crisp before fleeing with his son, Cullen Jr.  Partnered with former-teacher-turned-detective Phoebe O'Hara, Kimble goes undercover in [[Astoria, Oregon]] to find Rachel and offer her immunity in exchange for testifying against Crisp in court. To this end, O'Hara must act as a substitute teacher in Cullen Jr.'s [[kindergarten]] class at Astoria Elementary School.  O'Hara gets a terrible case of [[stomach flu]], falling ill at the last moment, so Kimble takes her place as teacher. The suspicious school principal, Miss Schlowski, is convinced Kimble will not last long before quitting. Overwhelmed at first, Kimble adapts quickly to his new status, despite not having any formal teaching experience or training. With the use of his pet [[ferret]] as a class mascot, positive reinforcement, his police training as a model for structure in class, and his experience as a father, he becomes a much-admired and cherished figure to the children.  Kimble begins to enjoy his undercover role. He deals with a case of [[child abuse]], winning Schlowski's favor. In observation of his teaching style, she assures him that even though she does not agree with his methods, she can see that he is a good teacher. Kimble becomes fond of fellow teacher Joyce Palmieri, his student Dominic's mother. Joyce is estranged from her husband and will not speak of him, and tells Dominic that he lives in France.  Conversing with the gradually more-trusting Joyce, Kimble deduces that she is Rachel Crisp and that Dominic is Cullen Jr. In California, the case holding Crisp in jail is closed after the witness dies from using tainted cocaine provided by Crisp's mother, Eleanor. Crisp is liberated from prison and immediately travels to Astoria with his mother to search for Dominic. When Kimble learns Cullen has been released, he confronts Joyce about her identity, saying he can protect her if she cooperates. Outraged that he misled her, she tells Kimble that Cullen lied about her stealing the money to convince drug dealers he knows to help him find her; the real reason was to find his son, as he was angry that his wife disappeared with him.  Crisp starts a fire in the school library as a distraction to kidnap Dominic, but uses him as a hostage when Kimble arrives. Kimble's ferret bites Crisp on the neck, allowing Dominic to escape; Crisp shoots Kimble in the leg before Kimble fatally shoots him. Outside, Eleanor injures O'Hara with her car before going inside and discovering her dead son; she wounds Kimble in the shoulder, but an enraged O'Hara appears and vengefully attacks and beats her unconscious with a baseball bat.  Eleanor is arrested and the unconscious Kimble is hospitalized with O'Hara, both making a full recovery. O'Hara returns to the police force in Los Angeles while Kimble decides to retire, staying in Astoria to become a teacher for the kindergarten at the school.

After the game, Daly tells Captain Joe Torres ([[Henry Darrow]]) that his team is working on a major bust. He asks Torres to help keep the [[DEA]] out of the operation.  Later that night, Daly and his team surveil a massive drug deal at a meat processing plant. However, when Daly radios Torres for backup, the Captain orders him to wait for the DEA to show up. Daly ignores the order. During the raid, Anthony Reece ([[Michael C. Gwynne]]) and his main henchman torch the money earned during the deal, setting the whole plant on fire.  Reece and his henchman drive up to a diplomatic retreat in the mountains to inform their superior, R.J. Norringer ([[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]]), about the fate of the money. Cpt. Torres suspends Daly and his team pending an investigation. The team use their free time during their suspension to make good on their promise to install a septic tank at Canyon Park. Through one of their informants, Fast Eddie ([[Xander Berkeley]]), Daly arranges for a prostitute to meet with Reece and surveil him further. As Reece waits for the prostitute, Rodriguez witnesses him receive an envelope from someone who he later learns is a DEA agent.  Eddie calls Daly to tell him that Reece was a psycho, and he viciously beat the prostitute. Daly and the team heads to the motel where Eddie and the prostitute are hiding, but before they can get there, Reece's henchman kills them both. Jones chases the henchman, who lays a trap for Jones and kills him.  Daly is charged with violating the terms of his suspension, resulting in Jones' death. Daly resigns in disgust. Gross resigns in solidarity. Rodriguez initially does not want to resign, because being a cop is his whole identity, but he eventually agrees to resign and pursue the case as civilians with the rest of the team. They raise $25,000 for their operation by knocking over some local drug dealers.  The team trails Reece to an event for the Central American Relief Fund, where they witness Norringer give a speech advocating support for Central American rebel forces. On the roof of the building, they videotape Reece meeting with Norringer. They visit retired cop Tommy Grogan ([[John P. Finnegan|John Finnegan]]), who reads Reece and Norringer's lips to determine that there is a major deal going down the next night.  As the team investigates Norringer's harbor operation, Captain Torres visits Grogan with Reece's henchman to determine what he told Daly's team. At Norringer's warehouse, the team realizes that the drug sales are used to finance weapons purchases on behalf of Central American rebels. Norringer's men give chase, and the team escapes in one of the loaded trucks. After they crash it into an overpass, they find that it is loaded with over $22 million.  They hide the cash in the septic tank at the park. As they clean up afterward, they find Grogan's body in a locker. Realizing that their families are in danger, they gather all of their loved ones in an secluded spot and debate their next step. They agree to pursue the case, rather than run off with the money. Daly confronts Torres about Grogan, and he confesses to his involvement in the scheme, explaining that he just does not care anymore about right and wrong.  Daly sets up an exchange at the park, with Gross and Rodriguez hiding in sniper positions. They have also planted small charges around the field. When Torres and Norringer arrive, a gunfight ensues. The police arrive, because Torres had called them in a final act of contrition, and they help Daly and his team defend themselves. Norringer, Torres, and Reece are all killed in the firefight. The film closes with the rededication of Canyon Park in Jones' honor. Daly is back in uniform, and the camera lingers on a TV where the President denies involvement in the scheme while expressing support for the rebels.

Life Is Sweet (film)
  Andy ([[Jim Broadbent]]), a senior chef in a large London catering facility, buys a dilapidated [[Food truck|fast-food van]] from a disreputable acquaintance named Patsy ([[Stephen Rea]]). He plans to clean, restore and put it into service on a local fast-food round. Wendy ([[Alison Steadman]]), his hard-working, good-natured and innuendo-prone wife, is sensibly sceptical about the project but understands her husband's ambitions. Their twin 22-year-old daughters (Natalie and Nicola) have profoundly different attitudes: tomboyish Natalie, who works as a plumber's mate ([[Claire Skinner]]), thinks it is a good idea if it will make her father happy, whereas the bitter, shut-in Nicola ([[Jane Horrocks]]), contemptuously and typically dismisses Andy as a "Capitalist!" Late at night, an anguished Nicola [[bulimia nervosa|binges on chocolate and snacks, then forces herself to vomit]]. Natalie – awake in the next room – overhears her.  Aubrey ([[Timothy Spall]]), a hyperactive but emotionally labile family friend, is opening a Parisian-themed restaurant named [[Non, je ne regrette rien|''The Regret Rien'']]. Wendy accepts a part-time job as waitress in the restaurant, but her and Andy's initial confidence in the scheme is undermined by Aubrey's unorthodox approach to the interior décor (a cluttered, half-realised combination of outmoded French clichés, such as a bicycle in the bay window, and of tasteless Victoriana such as a stuffed cat's head framed by broken accordion sconces) and by his menu. His singularly grotesque interpretation of the excesses of [[nouvelle cuisine]] includes dishes such as [[saveloy]] on a bed of [[lychee]]s, [[liver]] in [[lager]] and pork cyst.  During the afternoon, whilst the rest of the family are out at work, Nicola's lover (unnamed, played by [[David Thewlis]]) comes to the family home to have sex with her. It appears that Nicola can only be aroused by a combination of light bondage and the consumption of [[Nutella|chocolate spread]] from her chest – a practice to which he only reluctantly agrees. He ultimately loses patience with her, accusing her of being "a bit vacant" and incapable of having a sincere, adult conversation or allowing herself to enjoy his companionship. She calls his bluff and loses: frustrated but resolute, he leaves her and her fragile emotional state deteriorates even further.  The opening night of ''The Regret Rien'' is a disaster. Wendy volunteers her help when it becomes clear that Aubrey's waitress has let him down – she has gone to [[Prague]] with her boyfriend. And Aubrey forgot to advertise the opening of the restaurant, with the result that no customers turn up. Aubrey gets hopelessly drunk, takes to the pavement and rails against the world, tells Wendy that he fancies her, starts taking his clothes off and passes out, 'a quivering, sobbing gelatinous blob of disappointment.'<ref>Coveney, p. 221</ref> Wendy is forced to deal not only with him but with his glum and passive [[sous-chef]]/dogsbody, Paula ([[Moya Brady]]).  Meanwhile, Andy and Patsy have gone to their local pub, where Andy gets uncharacteristically but emphatically drunk and ends up sleeping inside the decrepit fast-food van in his driveway. Wendy returns home from the disastrous opening night of Aubrey's restaurant to find him there: unnerved by her bizarre evening, she loses her temper with the whole family.  Phlegmatic and dry-humoured Natalie enjoys her unconventional work as a plumber, the simple pleasures of a pint and a game of pool, and dreams of visiting the US. In contrast, the fidgety and isolated Nicola becomes increasingly agitated, aggressive and reclusive, and Wendy finally confronts her.  During the course of their long and anguished confrontation, Wendy makes it clear to Nicola that she is deeply worried about her, for example, wondering why she makes no attempt to get involved with the causes she claims to believe in. She tells Nicola of the struggle she and Andy endured to care for their baby daughters – how it meant she never went to college and Andy working in a "job he hates."  It emerges that during an earlier phase of Nicola's [[bulimia]], she almost starved to death. Ashamed and angry, Nicola is convinced that Wendy and the rest of the family hate her. Instead, as the exasperated Wendy tells her, "We don't hate you! We love you, you ''stupid'' girl!" and leaves the room, deeply upset. The brittle behavioural armour with which Nicola has protected her psyche is now shattered and she breaks down sobbing.  Meanwhile, Andy is seen running his kitchen at work with energy and authority but slips on a spoon, breaking his ankle. Wendy receives the news with a characteristic mixture of sympathy and amusement. She drives him home from the hospital; aided by Natalie she makes him comfortable, and then goes to see Nicola, still in her room. Mother and daughter reconcile.  The film ends with Natalie and Nicola sitting peacefully in the evening sunshine in the back garden. Natalie observes that Nicola must own up to her parents about her bulimia. She then asks Nicola "D'you want some money?" and Nicola accepts gratefully, the first time in the film where she has accepted an offer of help.  
The Little Kidnappers (1990 film)
  [[Coralee Elliott Testar]]'s version of the story revolves around letters written by James' son to his wife and children. Harry and Davy have brought them in a box James had carved for his son many years before. Through these letters, James begins to find healing from his grief over the death of his son at the hands of Dutch soldiers in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa, deliverance from the hatred in his heart for neighboring Dutch farmers, and acceptance of his daughter's love for the village doctor who is also of Dutch heritage.  The movie's title refers to the discovery and rescue by Harry and Davy of the neighbor's baby briefly left unattended on a beach and their decision to hide and care for it themselves rather than risk their grandfather's harsh and unmerciful reaction to it.  
Lionheart (1990 film)
 Lyon Gaultier is a [[paratrooper]] in the [[French Foreign Legion]], stationed in [[Djibouti]], North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American woman in [[Los Angeles]], is burned alive during a drug deal gone wrong and suffers [[third-degree burn]]s, dying shortly afterward. Lyon deserts his legion when he finds out they have been withholding letters from his brother's wife and ultimately refuse to let him see his dying brother. He steals a jeep and escapes through the desert, finding work on a [[tramp steamer]] headed for the [[United States|U.S.]] Meanwhile, the Legion commanding officer also travels to the States, arriving at the French Embassy, where he is told that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], so he orders two of his own Legionnaires to do the job.  Lyon arrives in New York City and travels to California to be with his brother's family. Along the way, he meets Joshua, a man who runs fights for money, and also learns that he cannot avenge his brother's murder, as he failed to identify his killers before dying. Tagging along with Joshua, Lyon meets Cynthia, who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and decides to sponsor him. Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money his family needs, Lyon fights in no-holds-barred [[bare-knuckle boxing|bare-knuckle]] fights to finance the trip. Once they reach L.A., he tracks down his brother's widow, who is reluctant to accept financial aid, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for "deserting" his brother years ago.  This is when he finds out that his brother has already died. Joshua introduces Lyon in the fighting circuit as the titular "Lionheart," derived from "Lyon." Lyon continues fighting, and Joshua uses the prize money to give to Lyon's sister-in-law in the form of checks, with Joshua claiming to be from a life insurance firm her husband allegedly subscribed to long ago.  Meanwhile, the two Legionnaires catch up with Lyon in Los Angeles. Lyon fights them off, but suffers a broken rib. Cynthia decides to take advantage of Lyon's string of victories by stacking the odds in favor of a massive, brutal fighter named ''"Attila the Hun"'', who has so far been unbeatable. Cynthia stacks the odds by smuggling a video of Atilla fighting poorly from one of his earlier bouts, which as expected fails to impress the odds-makers. Cynthia later reveals Attila's true prowess to the Legionnaires, and she promises to deliver Lyon to them after he has been thoroughly humiliated and beaten. The Legionnaires agree to this, provided they can be in the audience.  Lyon's fight with Atilla is hampered by his broken rib. Atilla's trademark (deliberately withheld from Lyon) is to let his opponent tire themselves out before viciously breaking them, often killing them in the process. When it appears "Attila" has won, Joshua begs Lyon to give up, revealing that they were both used by Cynthia. Joshua, for the best of reasons (Lionheart's family), placed all of his own money on Attila as a form of "insurance," as all the odds are against Lyon winning. Lyon, angered by this news, bounces back and summons up all his remaining strength to defeat Atilla, subduing but not killing him. While bookies sideline Cynthia demanding she pay up, the Legionnaires capture Lyon. They escort him back to the apartment, where they give him some time to say his goodbyes before being returned back to Africa, where he will be [[court-martial]]ed for [[desertion]]. Lyon tells his niece that he must go but to try to look for times when life can be good, which is emotional as she does not understand. However, just down the road, moved by the family's heartbreak, the Legionnaires decide to let Lyon go. They believe he has shown the Legion's values of honor, determination and service to others, both during the fight and helping out the family, and wish him luck in his new life in America. Ultimately, Lyon is shown running back to a pleased Joshua and joyous family.  
Lisa (1990 film)
 Fourteen-year-old Lisa Holland ([[Staci Keanan]]) lives with her mother Katherine ([[Cheryl Ladd]]), a successful florist, in [[Venice Beach, California]]. Lisa is beginning to show a keen interest in boys but is not allowed to date due to her mother’s strict rule about not dating until she is 16. It is revealed that Katherine had Lisa when she was 14 years old. Abandoned by Lisa's father, Katherine was forced to leave home after her parents demanded that she put Lisa up for adoption. These facts have made Katherine very wary about Lisa dating, feeling she would end up like her mother. Lisa’s desire to have a boyfriend is furthered by her best friend Wendy Marks, whose less-strict mother and father have allowed her to start dating.  Meanwhile, there is a serial killer running loose in Venice Beach, nicknamed the Candlelight Killer, so called because he seduces and rapes his victims by candlelight before killing them. The Candlelight Killer is a suave, good-looking, and successful restaurateur named Richard ([[D. W. Moffett]]), who looks more like a sexy model than a serial killer. Richard stalks good-looking women and then stalks them once he finds out where they live. Uniquely, Richard calls his victims over the telephone leaving messages on their answering machines saying he's in their house and is going to kill them. As the women are listening to his message, Richard grabs them from behind and then begins his vicious attacks.  One night, Lisa is coming home from the grocery store and accidentally runs into Richard, leaving the house of another victim. Lisa is mesmerized by his good looks and follows him to his car once he leaves, copying down his license plate number. Through the DMV she is able to get his address and telephone number. Lisa then begins to call up Richard on the phone and engages him in seducing conversation. Richard is intrigued by their conversations, yet is more interested in finding out who she is, mainly because he is the one now being stalked.   Lisa and Wendy follow Richard, finding out where he lives and works. Lisa even gets into Richard's car alone at one point only to have to hide in the back seat when he unexpectedly shows up. All this goes on unknown to Katherine, and with each succeeding conversation, in which Lisa reveals more about herself, Richard pushes Lisa towards meeting him for a date. Still at a standoff with her mother when it comes to dating, Wendy suggests that Lisa set up Katherine with Richard, implying that maybe if her mother gets some she will ease up and let Lisa date.  As [[Easter]] weekend approaches Lisa plans to go away with Wendy and her family to [[Big Bear, California]]. Katherine and Lisa decide to have a girls' night out dinner before she leaves, and Lisa makes reservations at Richard's restaurant. Lisa calls Richard telling him that she will be at the restaurant that night. While at the restaurant Lisa and her mother get into a quiet argument over dating again, with Lisa telling her mother that "if she got laid once in a while maybe she wouldn't be such a bitch about [her] dating." A furious Katherine goes to the bathroom telling Lisa to pay the bill with her credit card. Richard gets a love note from Lisa with the bill, which reveals Katherine's credit card information, which he uses to track her down.  Meanwhile, Richard begins to stalk the unsuspecting Katherine. While in Big Bear, Lisa decides to give Richard a call. He reveals to her that he knows her name is Katherine, and that he knows where she lives. On the night Lisa is to return from Big Bear, Katherine enters the apartment and hears a message from Richard. Meanwhile, Lisa returns home and enters the apartment. Running into her room she is attacked by Richard who has knocked her mother unconscious. Richard brings Lisa into Katherine's bedroom and plans to assault her; Lisa sees the candles and realizes he is the Candlelight Killer. Katherine regains consciousness, however, and knocks Richard out a window to his death.

Mollie and James tell Mikey that he's got to be [[potty training|potty trained]]. Mollie discovers she's [[pregnancy|pregnant]] again (this time a girl) and James is working diligently. Mikey learns that with his little sister, Julie, on the way, he has to be a responsible big brother. When Julie is about to be born, her [[umbilical cord]] gets caught around her neck, putting her in distress. She is born through a [[Cesarean section|c-section]] and is taken to the [[nursery (room)|nursery area]] for observation.  When Julie meets Mikey, she is unimpressed. Mikey, on the other hand, quickly begins to resent his sister when his dreams of being a responsible big brother don't match the reality. Meanwhile, Mollie's slacker right-wing brother, Stuart, comes to stay, to whom James takes an immediate dislike. This, combined with James being pressured into taking a demanding piloting job arranged by Mollie's parents and his belief that Mollie is too protective of Mikey, causes several arguments between the pair which eventually lead to James leaving. Mikey is upset about this and, believing he has left because of Julie, tears up one of his sister's stuffed animals. James occasionally hangs out with his kids (including scamming their way into a movie theater) and has fun with them. Following a burglary, Mollie's best friend Rona moves in with her and she soon starts dating Stuart.  Following the 'death' of her beloved stuffed penguin (whom she named Herbie), Julie decides to learn to walk and leave. Later, Julie manages to walk to the [[sofa]] without support. Mollie sees this and is initially excited but then saddened that James isn't there to share the moment. As he watches Julie sleep one night, Mikey realizes how badly he's treated her and resolves to change his ways. Mollie decides to win James back and dresses sexily for him, but he isn't interested. As the two bicker, Mikey uses the toilet for the first time and calls his parents, who are immensely proud of him and share a tender moment.  One night as James prepares to fly, Mollie watches the news and learns that storms are all around the area. She goes to get James before he takes off, leaving Stuart with Mikey and Julie. She catches him and tries to persuade him not to take off, just as the control tower cancel the flight. The two then makes up. Meanwhile, a burglar (presumably the same one who also robbed Rona) breaks in and runs when Stuart comes in with his unloaded gun. Stuart pursues him having forgotten about the kids and completely oblivious to the fact that he left paper on a hot stove which quickly causes a fire to start. Mikey doesn't panic and takes charge, pushing Julie out of the [[apartment]] to safety. Stuart and the burglar run into James who subdues the thief. Mollie and James soon find out the kids were left alone and spot the fire in the apartment, only for Mikey and Julie to emerge from the [[elevator]] as the two prepare to head in to save them. James then puts out the fire before it can cause too much damage.  The next day, James, Mollie, Stuart, Rona, and Mollie's parents attend a barbecue. There, Julie asks Mikey why he saved her when they're always fighting. Mikey tells her that for as much as they get on each other's nerves, they're the kids and should stick together since the grown-ups never make any sense to them. The two then walk off hand-in-hand.

Ellis suffers from a multiple personality disorder, which is aggravated when he is confronted with violence.

"Mac," as he's called, and Ellis attempt to track down the film through pornographer Harry "The Hippo" Gutterman (Dom DeLuise), who informs them that to do so they need to get to [[New York City]]. They decide to take a train, but first must evade a team of [[FBI]] agents led by Bob Smiley ([[Ronny Cox]]), whose orders are to prevent any embarrassment to von Metz by intercepting the film before it reaches the public domain. They all meet up at Washington's [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]], where Mac and Ellis trick Smiley and his team into boarding the New York-bound train they originally intended to take, while they jump off and hop onto one on the opposite track bound for [[Cleveland]] instead. While on board that train, Mac notices another undercover team that has been trailing them, which, as it turns out, is led by Rebecca "Riva" Lowengrin ([[Nancy Travis]]), a [[Mossad]] agent assigned to the [[Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.]].

Lord of the Flies (1990 film)
 An aircraft carrying 24 young American [[military school]] cadet boys returning home crash lands into the sea near a remote, uninhabited, jungle island in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The pilot of the plane Captain Benson ([[Michael Greene]]), the only adult survivor, is seriously injured and delirious. All of the survivors arrive on the island. During the night, Simon, the most independent cadet, finds a river and notifies the other boys, to which they all drink out of it and explore the island afterwards. Meanwhile, on the beach, an overweight cadet with glasses who is only known by his nickname "Piggy", finds a seashell and takes it to the grouped cadets, who adopt it to signal the right to speak and be heard by the group. The senior cadet, and one of the elder boys, Cadet Colonel Ralph, organizes a meeting to discuss surviving their predicament. Ralph and another of the older boys, Jack, emerge dominant, and an impromptu election is held to determine an official leader for the group. Ralph is declared the winner. They start a fire using Piggy's glasses to try and alert any passing craft. Things go smoothly for a while, but tensions soon begin to grow between Ralph and Jack.  One night, as they sleep, the delusional Captain Benson wanders away from the boys and into the jungle, eventually making his way to a cave deep inland. Jack brings all of his hunters to hunt in the jungle, leaving no one watching the fire. The fire goes out, preventing a passing helicopter from noticing them. Ralph blames Jack for failing to keep it going. During the ensuing fight, Jack, tired of listening to Ralph and Piggy, leaves and forms his own camp, taking many of the boys with him. As more and more boys defect to Jack's side, one of the younger boys, Larry, finds Captain Benson in the cave, mistakes him for a monster and stabs him, and then tells the other boys. Jack and his second-in-command Roger (Gary Rule) then go to the cave's entrance and mistakes Captain Benson's dying groans for the sounds of a monster.  One night, Jack and his savages steal a knife from Ralph so they can make more spears, but accidentally trample on Piggy's glasses in the process, breaking one lens. Expecting to be rescued, Ralph's civilized leadership establishes a permanent signal-fire to alert passing ships of their presence on the island. Not expecting or wanting to be rescued, Jack's savage leadership adapts to circumstance; he establishes his camp as spear-bearing hunters who provide meat for both camps. They kill a [[Wild pigs of the Philippines|Wild pig]] and leave its head as an offering to the "monster" that they believe is in the cave. Eventually, identical twins Sam and Eric (Andrew Taft and Edward Taft), two of Ralph's friends, leave him to join Jack's tribe, leaving Ralph with only Piggy and Simon left.  Meanwhile, Simon finds the pig's head on the stick. He then uses a glow stick to explore the cave and discovers the corpse of Capt. Benson. Simon realizes Capt. Benson was what the boys thought was the monster and runs to the beach in an attempt to alert the boys of his discovery, but his waving of the glow stick frightens the other boys, who mistake him for the monster and stab him to death with their spears. The following morning, Ralph blames himself and Piggy for not stopping the hunters from killing Simon. Meanwhile, Jack tells his gang that the "monster" can come in any different form.  After Piggy's glasses are stolen by Jack's savages that night so they could make fire, Piggy and Ralph travel to Jack's camp at Castle Rock, attempting to call a meeting using the conch. Piggy insists that everyone be sensible and work together, but Jack's savages refuse to listen. As Piggy speaks, Roger pushes a boulder off a cliff which lands on and kills Piggy. Ralph swears revenge on Jack, and Jack drives Ralph away by throwing rocks at him. Later that night, Ralph secretly returns to Castle Rock to visit Sam and Eric, who warn him that the hunters will chase after Ralph.  The following morning, Jack and his hunters begin setting the jungle on fire to force Ralph out of hiding and kill him. Just barely dodging the spreading fire and Jack's hunters, Ralph makes a desperate run to the sea. He falls onto the beach, where he encounters a U.S. Marine Corps officer who has just landed on the island after having seen the fire that engulfed much of the island. The officer then asks "What are you guys doing?" as Ralph breaks down in tears. All the hunters, especially Jack and Roger, are scared at what will happen to them for killing Simon and Piggy and their failed attempt to kill Ralph as more Marines show up.

  Mark Bannister, a stockbroker, and his wife Jessie, a TV Reporter/Anchorwoman, are a successful [[yuppie]] couple with an idyllic [[California]] life, aside from a [[toilet]] with a faulty handle. It is interrupted when both of them find out that Mark's timid cousin, Fred, and his [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] wife, Bernice, are flying in from [[New Jersey]] to visit that same day. The first days are slightly chaotic - particularly because of Bernice's cat - yet bearable. Mark gives them 300 dollars to spend in the city and grant the couple some alone time. They are interrupted when Jessie's gold digger sister Claudia arrives demanding hospitality. She had a fight with her rich Middle Eastern husband Kaddir, whom she divorces after he cancels her credit cards. Fred and Bernice's visit, meant to last only five days, is extended when Bernice [[Accident|falls]] on the way to the car. She is instructed by her doctor, Dr. Penix, not to leave until the baby is born.  At a local bar, Mark motivates Fred to quit being Bernice's pet, but Fred takes the message too far and leaves "to find himself." Meanwhile, Mark's next door neighbor and [[carpenter]] Dale builds a machine for Bernice to be comfortable in bed all day. Having to be waited on hand-and-foot, Bernice becomes increasingly irritating, even demanding constant burials for her cat who 'dies' multiple times (but comes back each time). Claudia's son Jonathan also comes to live with them. Jessie tries getting Dale to seduce Claudia, but things take a turn for the worse when Mark and Jessie inadvertently burn down Dale's villa, which can't be rebuilt for three months. As a result, Dale, his delinquent son C.K. and his phone-obsessed daughter Katy move in; Mark and Jessie are forced to accept them to avoid an [[arson]] lawsuit. Mark helps Jonathan get a job as a mail room clerk.  As the days pass, chaos persists for the couple with them essentially being forced out of their own home. Mark's friend and colleague Wes finds them outside living like [[hippies]], after Mark fails to show up for work. Wes motivates Mark to resist a little longer, especially as Mark is on the verge of closing a successful deal for his boss, Bob Grindle. At work, Mark gets a box from [[Bogota]] containing [[cocaine]] - sent to him but requested by Jonathan. Grindle tells Mark to sell a set of stocks due to a scandal, but Mark forgets to before leaving work with the cocaine. Fred comes back, having grown a mustache and now owning a baby [[elephant]]. Police arrive at the house and find the cat overdosing on cocaine; they subsequently destroy Mark's house during their drug bust, which gets televised by Jessie's TV station. The stress for Jessie manifests into an expletive-filled [[mental breakdown]] on live TV. Pushed to their limit and facing apparent ruin and imminent charges, Mark and Jesse decide to abandon the house to the guests and leave town to start new lives.  The next day, Mark and Jessie return to salvage what they can find. They hear a recording from Dr. Penix stating Bernice was never pregnant to begin with, breaking what little sanity they had left. An enraged Jessie catapults Bernice from her bed to the backyard and forces her to confess to knowing she wasn't pregnant. She then ruins her sister's expensive clothes to force Claudia out while Mark terrorizes Dale with an electric saw, making him leave with his two children. Lastly, Jessie puts [[fireworks]] on Jonathan's cocaine bag, which explodes as he tries to flee in Dale's (loaner) [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. Mark and Jessie then threaten to torch their own house in order to keep away their parasitic visitors for good. The police arrive and apologize, stating that their only evidence - Bernice's cat - disappeared, and that they will pay for all damages incurred. Grindle arrives and, believing Mark had meant to keep the stocks, declares that he amassed a small fortune when the scandal was found to be false. He offers Mark a portion of the profit and a promotion. Claudia takes the opportunity to seduce Grindle, and Dale starts flirting with one of the police officers, much to C.K's chagrin. The cat returns, but has changed sides, preferring to remain with Mark and Jessie. Bernice and Fred depart, with Fred taking much more control than before. Jessie and Mark try to get cozy before Mark, as a last touch, smashes the ever-malfunctioning toilet with a [[sledgehammer]].  In the epilogue it states that Mark and Jessie - who earned a TV show of her own due to her angry on-air outburst - move to a 3 bedroom house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] and live happily ever after... until their parents come to visit.

As John and Max celebrate their reunion, a gunfight breaks out between local drug dealers and a Jamaican gang at the bar where they celebrate. The gang, known as the [[Jamaican posse|Jamaican Posse]], is led by a notorious [[psychotic]] drug kingpin named Screwface ([[Basil Wallace]]) full of [[West African Vodun]] and [[wikt:sadism|sadism]]. John arrests one of Screwface's henchmen as the gunfight ends. News of Posse crimes occurring in Chicago and across the United States spread as the Posse expands its operations and recruits more members. The next day, Screwface and his henchmen do a drive-by shooting on the house where John, his sister Melissa, and Melissa's 12-year-old daughter Tracey live. Tracey is injured and hospitalized in critical condition.  John encounters a gangster named Jimmy whom he is forced to kill. A Jamaican gangster named Nesta arrives and is subdued by John, who asks about Screwface. Nesta gives information but tells him to go after Screwface alone and jumps out the window to his death. The next day, John discovers a strange symbol engraved on a carpet, and with the help of Jamaican voodoo and gang expert Leslie, a detective for the [[Chicago Police Department]], he learns that it is an African blood symbol used to mark their crimes. John decides to come out of retirement to join Max in a battle against Screwface.   At the same night of their rendezvous, John gets a phone call from Melissa, which is cut short when Screwface and his men invade the Hatcher household, but they leave upon his arrival. The next day, John and Max encounter another batch of Screwface's henchmen which results in a car chase wherein one of the henchmen is killed. The chase ends in a mall wherein the surviving three are subsequently killed by the duo amidst the chaos of shoppers fleeing the scene. During a meeting with Leslie, John realizes that the only way to stop the Jamaican Posse is to bring down Screwface. That evening, Screwface ambushes John under the guise of a construction crew; John escapes and survives after Screwface plants a molotov cocktail in his car.  The two team up with Charles, a [[Jamaican-American]] detective of the Chicago police, who has been trailing Screwface for five years, and trying to get to the root of the drug problem in the city. They acquire weaponry from a local weapons dealer, and, after testing the arsenal, they head for [[Kingston, Jamaica]] to find Screwface. Upon arrival, Max and Charles ask people in the streets for information about Screwface's and his hideout. A Jamaican local presents them a photo of a woman who is acquainted with Screwface. John meets her in a nightclub, and she describes hanging out with Screwface, his drug business, and his hideout, as well as the death of her sister in Screwface's hands. The woman also informs John of a cryptic clue: the secret of Screwface's power is that he has two heads and four eyes.  By nightfall, John, Max, and Charles (disguised as members of the Posse) head for Screwface's mansion, where a party is being held. Secretly infiltrating the premises through a nearby plantation, John assassinates three henchmen on the estate's balcony with a silenced sniper rifle, plants a bomb at a nearby power station and infiltrates the inner grounds by climbing across roofs. While Max and Charles keep a lookout, John detonates the bomb, causing the party to erupt into violence and gunfire. With Max and Charles opening fire on the ambushing Posse gang, John enters the building and disposes of many henchmen. He finds a sacrificial area but is captured by Screwface and his remaining henchmen. John manages to break free and kills every henchman before decapitating Screwface in a sword fight.  Upon returning in Chicago, the trio displays Screwface's severed head to the Chicago Posse to blackmail them in ending their crimes and leave. However, Charles is impaled by a man identically resembling Screwface, causing the gang ''(as well as the audience)'' to think that Screwface has returned from the dead. At this point, it is revealed that Screwface is actually a set of identical twin brothers posing as one man, and that despite both brothers being masterminds of Posse crimes in the entire United States, the twin himself was the real Chicago Posse crime mastermind. The meeting erupts in chaos, and the gang members open fire on the duo.   During the gunfight, Max holds off the henchmen despite being shot in the leg while John disposes more gang members before he engages Screwface's twin brother in a sword fight. The fight moves to a nightclub owned by the twin himself wherein Hatcher gives him more fatal injuries by gouging his eyes and breaking his spine before dropping him down an elevator shaft, impaling the twin in the process. As the surviving Posse members look at their dead boss, their fate remains ambiguous although the death of the Screwface brothers implies their arrest by law enforcement.  The final scene shows John carrying Charles' body with Max limping next to him before ending with [[Jimmy Cliff]]'s song "John Crow" being played in the credits.  
Maniac Cop 2
 After being impaled by a pipe and plunging into a river at the end of the previous film, the undead Maniac Cop Matthew Cordell acquires a junked police cruiser and continues his killing spree through New York City. Finding a convenience store in the middle of a robbery, he kills the clerk; the thief is subsequently killed in a shootout with police. As Cordell stalks the streets, his enemies Officers Jack Forrest and Theresa Mallory are put back on duty by Deputy Commissioner Edward Doyle, who has the two undergo a psychiatric evaluation under Officer Susan Riley. While Jack is content that Cordell is long gone and wants to go on with his life, Theresa is convinced that Cordell is still alive and plotting his revenge.  At a newsstand, Jack is stabbed through the neck by Cordell, killing him. In order to protect the memory of Commissioner Doyle, the corrupt official who originally framed Cordell, the police authority refuse to inform the public of the nature of recent events. This, along with her belief that Cordell is alive and killing, prompts Theresa to appear on a talk show to inform the public about Cordell. A traffic cop is murdered by Cordell later when he was towing someone's car. The man who was having his car towed is arrested on suspicion on the cop's murder. While en route to a hotel in a taxi, Theresa is joined by Susan, and the two are attacked by Cordell, who kills the cabbie and forces Susan and Theresa off the road. After handcuffing Susan to the steering wheel of a car and sending her into the busy streets, Cordell kills Theresa by snapping her neck. Gaining control of the car, Susan crashes and is found and given medical attention.  Elsewhere, a stripper named Cheryl is attacked in her apartment by Steven Turkell, who has strangled at least six other exotic dancers. As Turkell brutalizes Cheryl, Cordell arrives, murders the two officers earlier called by Cheryl, and helps Turkell escape. Grateful for the help, Turkell befriends Cordell and takes him back to his apartment, where Cordell stays for a short while. After Cordell leaves, Turkell goes out to find another victim but is identified at a strip club by Cheryl. He is arrested and placed in a holding cell by Susan and Detective Lieutenant Sean McKinney.  Turkell taunts Susan, telling him Cordell will break him out. Turkell's assumption proves correct, as Cordell breaks into the police station and murders a total of nineteen police officers and frees Turkell and several unnamed convicts. Using Susan as a hostage, Turkell, Cordell, and another criminal named Joseph Blum hijack a prison bus and head to Sing Sing, where Turkell believes Cordell wants to free all the inmates and create an army of criminals (Cordell even enforces this point by killing an inmate who disagreed and questioned him). McKinney and Doyle follow, and McKinney convinces Doyle to reopen Cordell's case and rebury his casket with full honors on the assumption that this will appease Cordell.  Cordell bluffs his way into the prison using Blum's paperwork, and he kills a guard for his keys. Shortly after entering death row, Cordell is contacted over the prison PA system by Doyle, who admits to Cordell that he was set up and states that his case has been reopened. After hearing Doyle's announcement, Cordell abandons Turkell, Blum, and Susan and heads deeper into the prison, where he is attacked with a [[Molotov cocktail]] by the three inmates who originally mutilated him. While burning, Cordell finally gets revenge and murders the three convicts who mutilated him and assaults the other prisoners (killing one of them, who didn't mutilate him, in the process), only to be attacked by Turkell, who realizes Cordell used him. As Cordell and Turkell fight, the two crash through a wall, fall onto the bus below, and seemingly dies when the vehicle explodes (killing Turkell in the process).  Sometime later, Cordell is buried with full honors alongside other fallen officers; Susan and McKinney attend his funeral. As Cordell's casket is lowered, McKinney throws Cordell's badge into the grave, leaves with Susan, and delivers a monologue about how there is a little bit of Cordell in every officer, and that every member of the force needs to rise above becoming a Maniac Cop. Before the credits roll, Cordell's hand bursts through the lid of his casket and grabs his badge.

Megaville
 National boundaries have been broken, two giant super-states remain—a bleak, decaying Hemisphere, and the sprawling media state Megaville. Travel between the states is restricted. The "CKS" governs daily life in the Hemisphere. All forms of media are illegal here.  Raymond Palinov, an unassuming captain of the media police finds himself drawn to a spaghetti western and cannot pull away from it during a media raid. Palinov is ostracized by his superior for the incident. After nearly losing his job, Palinov begins to exhibit strange character traits. During a rally in which outlawed media recordings are shown to the media police as examples of contraband, Palinov laughs out loud at a comedy clip. Palinov then appears to have a complete mental breakdown and loses consciousness. Whereas most agents would have been terminated following such an incident, Palinov is spared. Palinov is found to be exhibiting unusual brain activity and is sent for an examination. Palinov explains to Dr. Vogel that he has been having bizarre flashbacks and seeing memories in dreams which are not his own. Dr. Vogel tells Palinov he believes the strange behavior is due to years of exposure to media "filth" and initiates a procedure which will remove the unexplained brain activity and restore Palinov's personality in its entirety. The procedure doesn't work and Palinov's mental episodes become steadily worse.  Palinov is contacted by Mr. Duprell, the director of the CKS, with an infiltration assignment. The Hemisphere war against media is about to intensify with news of the introduction of "Dream-A-Life" (DAL) a hallucination-inducing consumer product. People in Megaville could start new lives in their own fantasy world of choice. The government of Megaville has deemed DAL legal and its use has become prevalent with the help of a mysterious figure in the Megaville underworld known as Mr. Newman. Duprell explains that Palinov bears a striking physical resemblance to Newman's only known contact in the Hemisphere, Mr. Jensen. Palinov's mission is to assume Jensen's life and infiltrate the criminal underworld of both the Hemisphere and Megaville, discover who Newman is working with, and who Newman's contacts are in the Hemisphere. In order to assist his infiltration, Palinov is implanted with some of Jensen's memories. As he slips into the role, he soon meets Jensen's almost lover, Christine, a former demolitions expert for the armed forces who went AWOL after being ordered to kill civilians. Christine demands that Jensen take her to Megaville. Christine and Palinov travel to Megaville and meet Newman, who refuses to reveal any information about his operation. Meanwhile, the president of Megaville, outspoken against DAL, is assassinated. Palinov suspects Newman is involved, but the only witness is the president's personal aide, who is now permanently trapped in a DAL induced hallucination.  When Palinov attempts to remove the headset, the aide is shot in broad daylight by Newman. Duprell contacts Palinov through his [[brain implant]], informs him to close the deal with Newman or his mother will die; Duprell does not want to stop DAL, he wants in on the deal. Palinov refuses and Duprell attempts to kill him via the implant. Palinov's mother saves him by destroying Duprell's transmitting device, but is then murdered. However, before she dies she reveals the truth to Palinov; she is not his mother at all, he is actually Jensen the man he thinks he is impersonating, Palinov's mind is the fake. Palinov escapes with Christine, pursued by Megaville's underworld; all except Palinov are killed in a shoot-out. Duprell has been watching Palinovs mind, which Palinov finally realizes. He uses a DAL device to fake Duprell's activities on a Megaville national broadcast, which Duprell believes to be real. Palinov says all the evidence of the conspiracy is in a briefcase at Christine's apartment. Duprell opens it and detonates the bomb inside. Newman reveals to Palinov that he is Jensen's biological father and claims he wishes they had spent more time together before shooting Palinov. Newman then notices his leg is handcuffed to Palinov and he is now trapped in the desert.

Mermaids (1990 film)
 The film is narrated by Charlotte Flax, a quirky and awkward 15-year-old girl living in [[Oklahoma]] with her single, eccentric mother, Rachel (whom she calls "Mrs. Flax"), and her sweet nine-year-old sister, Kate. Rachel's daughters have different fathers—Charlotte is a product of a teenage romance and a [[shotgun marriage]] that only lasted about a year and Kate is from an affair with an athlete.  The narration begins in early fall of 1963. Just as Rachel's latest fling with her married employer ends, she decides to relocate with Charlotte and Kate once again. This time, they move to a new home near a [[convent]] in the small town of Eastport, [[Massachusetts]], where Rachel gets a job as a [[secretary]] for a local [[insurance adjuster]]. Charlotte has an unusual obsession with [[Catholicism]], strengthened by her mother's disapproval, and idolizes the [[nun]]s living in the convent. Kate, on the other hand, loves all things swimming and is an avid competitor, apparently getting it from Rachel's Olympic one night stand from which she was conceived.  In Eastport, Charlotte becomes especially interested in Joe Poretti, the 26-year-old handsome caretaker of the convent and local school bus driver, while Rachel falls in love with a local shop owner named Lou Landsky. After the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of John F. Kennedy]], Charlotte finds Joe ringing the convent bell and consoles him. However, they begin to kiss and feeling filled with sin she flees. After the encounter, she begins [[fasting]] in order to purge her sinful thoughts, but eventually passes out from hunger and the fear of immaculate conception and starts eating again.  Soon fearing that God may be punishing through pregnancy and unable to talk to her mother about it, she steals her car and runs away. She stops at the house of a "perfect nuclear family" in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], asking to spend the night, telling them her name is Sal Val and other wild stories, which they don't seem to completely believe. Later on, she is picked up by Lou and taken home after the family reports her, where Charlotte immediately receives a harsh scolding from Rachel believing she could have been murdered.  When Rachel calms down, she tells Charlotte that she was worried sick about her safety, and, thinking that it's her fault that Charlotte ran away from home, admits that even though she's not an expert in parenting, she's willing to compromise and try her best to take care of both Charlotte and Kate. The next day, Charlotte makes an appointment at the nearest clinic under the name [[Joan of Arc|Joan Arc]], where she sees an obstetrician and is told she is still a virgin and therefore cannot be pregnant. Relieved, she goes home, dispelled of her assumption that "one kiss can get you pregnant".  At a [[New Year's Eve]] costume party sometime after a large fight with Lou, he asks Rachel to marry/move in with him but she declines both, reminding him that he's still married. However, she's not willing to break up with him nor let their relationship progress either. This ends with Lou calmly leaving in disappointment. Rachel then asks Joe for a ride home, before she wishes him a happy New Year and kisses him. Charlotte sees this and feels that her mother is trying to steal him away.  The night after the incident, Charlotte dresses up in Rachel's clothes and makeup in an attempt to show that she can be just as appealing as her mother. She and Kate get drunk on Rachel's [[jug wine]] and talk on the porch about Kate's birth. Hearing the church bells ringing, Charlotte then takes Kate to the convent and tells her that she'll be back. Kate decides to drunkenly collect rocks while Charlotte goes up to the bell tower to find Joe, where they have sex. Unbeknownst to them, Kate falls into a river and almost drowns due to her inebriation, but is saved by the nuns and is taken to the hospital.  Outraged at the turn of events, Rachel and Charlotte argue, eventually leading to an understanding of each other as mother and daughter and not just friends. After the argument ended, Rachel slaps Charlotte across the face. Charlotte convinces Rachel to stay in Eastport for at least another year.  Time passes in the small town and Rachel's relationship with Lou continues. Joe moves to California and opens up a [[plant nursery]], but keeps in touch with Charlotte via postcards. Charlotte, in turn, has gained a reputation in high school due to her sexual encounter with Joe and replaces her Catholicism obsession with [[Greek mythology]] and a less conservative look; Rachel now reminds her that they are not Greek. Kate, having recovered, is swimming again, although the accident has left her hearing sometimes [[Hearing loss|"sounding fuzzy"]]. The film ends with the three of them dancing while setting the table for dinner.  
Men at Work (1990 film)
 Carl Taylor (Sheen) and James St. James (Estevez) are a pair of troublemaking [[Waste collector|garbagemen]] who dream of owning a surf shop. The two uncover an illegal toxic dumping operation in their own city, Las Playas. The film begins with the pair collecting trash as they usually do, by tossing garbage cans in the street and making noise that disturbs the residents. One of the local cops, Mike, hassles them frequently, but Carl and James seem to have gotten used to this treatment and shrug it off.   After work, the pair spy on a woman living across the street with a telescope; they discover that she is being mistreated by a man who is with her. Determined to right the wrong, Carl shoots the man in the rear with a [[air gun|pellet gun]]. He and James both hide and laugh. Moments later, the man - a city councilman named Jack Berger ([[Darrell Larson]]), who's running for mayor - is strangled and ends up found the next day by Carl and James in a yellow drum. They decide that turning in the body would implicate themselves, as they had shot him earlier.  Carl and James ask the advice of crazed [[Vietnam War]] vet Louis Fedders ([[Keith David]]), who helps them to stash the body after reassuring them that the man died by strangulation, not any shooting. Carl goes over to meet Susan Wilkins ([[Leslie Hope]]), the woman who they saw with Jack the night before. Louis ends up exacerbating the situation when he kidnaps a [[pizza delivery]] man who sees James with the body.  James, Louis, the pizza man and the stiff end up leaving the apartment to follow Carl and Susan, but they are pulled over by Mike and his partner, Jeff. Louis, however, uses the pellet gun to get them out of trouble and to cuff Mike and Jeff together in a compromising position at a playground. Meanwhile, Carl and Susan are discovered by Biff and Mario, the hitmen who had killed Jack. The couple are eventually stuffed into cans and set to be disposed of in a lake that serves as an illegal toxic dump for a local businessman, Maxwell Potterdam III, who was also the man who had Jack killed.  Carl and Susan manage to escape from the cans and reunite with the others. The group fights the toxic dump workers and brings down Potterdam.  
Memphis Belle (film)
 In May 1943, the crew of the ''Memphis Belle'', a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress of the [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Force]], are grounded in England while their aircraft is repaired. The group is under the command of Col. Craig Harriman ([[David Strathairn]]), a no-nonsense, stoical leader, tasked with keeping the pressure on Nazi targets. An Army publicist, Lt. Col. Bruce Derringer ([[John Lithgow]]) is visiting the base, to interview the ''Belle'' crew in anticipation of their flying their 25th mission, a requirement to complete their tour of duty. Derringer is eager to use the crew on a war bonds tour stateside. He believes their success would help the war effort and confides to Harriman that many people back home are upset at the losses the Air Force has suffered. Some are beginning to think [[Combined Bomber Offensive|daylight bombing]] is ineffective, while Harriman openly favours it.  The officers of the squadron are informed the target for the day will be [[Bremen]], Germany. After a delay due to poor weather over the target, the ''Memphis Belle'' and her squadron are airborne. They are soon assembled in formation with bomb group and their escort of [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighters. They face frequent harassment by defending German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters along the way. Eventually, the escorting fighters, low on fuel, turn away, while the bombers continue alone.  Back at the base, Harriman and Derringer have harsh words after the latter starts decorating the mess hall for a celebration upon the Belle's return. Derringer accuses Harriman of being cold-hearted and concerned only with advancing his military career. In response, Harriman brings Derringer into his office and angrily dumps a pile of letters on his desk and forces Derringer to read some of them. They are replies Harriman received from the grieving families of lost airmen.  Meanwhile, the bombers have suffered significant losses. The German interceptors focus their attacks on the leading aircraft in the formation. The first lead bomber, ''Windy City'', loses its engines and explodes in front of the ''Belle'', piloted by Captain Dennis Dearborn ([[Matthew Modine]]) and co-pilot 1st Lt. Luke Sinclair ([[Tate Donovan]]). More attacks ensue, and the replacement lead bomber, ''C Cup'', is forced to break formation when its nose is crippled by a Bf 109. The crew of the ''Belle'' watch in horror when they see an airman fall out of the stricken aircraft without a parachute. The ''Belle'' is then tasked to lead the formation to the target.  Finding the target – an aircraft assembly plant – becomes difficult as bombardier 1st Lt. Val Kozlowski ([[Billy Zane]]) can't see the target because of a smokescreen the Germans have created. Dearborn aborts the initial bomb run and orders the formation to circle around for a second attempt, which frustrates the Belle crew who have had to endure the ongoing attacks from the Germans. On the second run, Kozlowski spots the assembly plant through a gap in the smokescreen and the bombers successfully hit their target. Once clear of the anti-aircraft fire, they are again attacked by fighters. Staff Sgt. Richard "Rascal" Moore's ([[Sean Astin]]) ball turret is destroyed, but he is saved by the safety strap. The attacks continue, blasting a hole in the fuselage, tearing off a large chunk of the tail, and setting the number four engine on fire. Radio operator Staff Sgt. (T/3) Danny "Danny Boy" Daly ([[Eric Stoltz]]), is wounded in the attacks, which puts Kozlowski in a difficult position when the crew enlists his self-exaggerated medical "expertise" to save the injured radioman.

Miller's Crossing
  Tom Reagan is the right-hand man for Leo O'Bannon, an Irish mobster and [[political boss]] who runs a U.S. city during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. When Leo's rival, the Italian gangster Johnny Caspar, announces his intent to kill [[Bookmaker|bookie]] Bernie Bernbaum, Leo goes against Tom's advice and extends his protection to Bernie. Bernie is the brother of Verna, who has begun a relationship with Leo – while also carrying on an affair with Tom.  Tom tries everything he can to convince Leo to give Bernie up to Caspar to prevent a war; he attempts to convince Leo that Verna is playing him to protect her brother, but Leo will not be swayed. After an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom reveals his affair with Verna to Leo to prove that she is dishonest. Leo beats Tom, and turns his back on both of them. Tom then approaches Caspar looking for work, and Caspar commands him to kill Bernie in the woods at Miller's Crossing to prove his loyalty. Bernie pleads with Tom to spare him, saying "Look in your heart". Tom fires his gun to fake the killing and tells Bernie to run and hide.  Caspar assumes Leo's position as boss of the city, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations. Meanwhile, Tom begins sowing discord between Caspar and his trusted enforcer, the brutal Eddie "the Dane" Dane. Upon finding that his men didn't actually see Tom kill Bernie, Dane takes Tom back to Miller's Crossing to see if Bernie's body is there. Tom nearly cracks as they approach the location, but they find a body that had been shot in the face and disfigured by birds. Unknown to Tom, Bernie returned to town and killed Dane's lover Mink, who was Bernie's lover too, and placed the body where his should have been. Bernie holds this over Tom's head and tries to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar.  Tom uses Mink's unknown whereabouts to convince Caspar that Eddie Dane has betrayed him. Dane denies it, and Caspar has to decide whom he believes, and whom he will kill. In a rage, he beats Eddie Dane before shooting him in the head. Tom then arranges a meeting with Bernie, but sends Caspar instead on the pretext that he will be meeting Mink. Bernie gets the jump on Caspar and kills him. Tom arrives and tricks Bernie into giving up his gun, saying they can blame Eddie Dane, then reveals that Dane is dead, and that he intends to kill Bernie in retribution for blackmailing him. Bernie again begs for mercy, saying "Look in your heart", but Tom asks "What heart?" and shoots him.  With Caspar and Eddie Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as boss.

Miami Blues
 Frederick J. Frenger Jr. (who asks to be called "Junior"), a violent [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]] recently released from a California prison, starts a new life in [[Miami]]. Before leaving the airport, he steals luggage and kills a [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] after breaking his finger. Junior checks into a hotel and hooks up with Susie Waggoner, a naive prostitute who is a student at a community college. They become romantically involved and take a house together, with Susie blissfully unaware of Junior's criminal activities and harboring fantasies of living happily ever after.  An investigation of the Hare Krishna murder leads grizzled policeman Sgt. Hoke Moseley to come knocking on their door. Moseley shares a home-cooked dinner with the couple, upon Susie's suggestion, and plays it cool while seemingly indicating to Junior that he's on to him. He overtly suspects Junior has been in prison and wants him to come to the police station for a lineup. Junior goes to Moseley's home the next day, assaults him, and steals his gun, badge and dentures.  Later, while Susie is taking a bath and writing a [[haiku]], Junior decides to break into a nearby apartment. He steals an [[IMI Desert Eagle]] handgun and a steak. As he is doing this, he speaks aloud a haiku of his own: "Breaking entering. The dark and lonely places. Finding a big gun". Junior begins using the badge, demanding [[bribery|bribes]] as rewards after breaking up robberies, only to keep the loot for himself.  While at a grocery store, Junior witnesses an armed robbery and decides to break it up. He lectures the gunman about avoiding a life of crime, but the gunman runs a truck over him. Junior complains to Susie that the "straight life" has made him too soft. Moseley tracks down the couple through a utility account opened up in Susie's name. He pretends to run into her at the grocery store, where they swap recipes. After she lies that she has left Junior, Moseley tells her that Junior is a murderer and that he and the police are looking for him.  Back home, to test whether he will lie to her, Susie deliberately ruins a pie by putting vinegar in it. To her disappointment, Junior compliments the dessert and eats it with gusto. The next day, Junior asks Susie to drive him around town on errands. Their first stop is a pawn shop, which he robs. In the course of the robbery, Junior kills the pawnbroker, but not before she chops several of Junior's fingers off.  Badly injured, he limps to the car, but Susie drives away upon realizing what he's done. Moseley pursues him to the house, where he shoots and kills Junior. Being ironic with his last words, Junior tells Moseley, "Susie's gonna get you, Sarge." Susie then arrives and Moseley asks why she stayed with him for so long. She explains that he ate everything she ever cooked and never hit her.  
Metropolitan (1990 film)
 Shot on location in [[Manhattan]] and [[Long Island]], the film depicts the lives of young, well-educated upper-class [[New York City|New Yorkers]] (or, as one character calls them, the "urban ''haute [[bourgeoisie]]'') home on [[School holiday#Christmas holiday|winter break]] from their first year of college during [[debutante|debutante ball]] season.   Middle-class [[Princeton University|Princeton]] student Tom Townsend, an admirer of [[Charles Fourier]]'s socialism, attends a dress ball one evening on a whim. After the ball, a mix-up leads to his meeting a small group of young [[Upper East Side]] socialites known as the Sally Fowler Rat Pack, after the girl whose apartment they use for after-hours parties. Believing that they accidentally stole a taxi from Tom, they decide to invite him to their after-hours party, to prevent ill feelings.  Tom decides to attend the party, and befriends several other attendees, including Nick Smith, a cynical [[dandy]]<ref name="Cinema199">[[Emanuel Levy]], ''Cinema of Outsiders: The Rise of American Independent Film'', p. 199)</ref> who takes Tom under his wing; Audrey, a shy<ref>Suzanne R. Pucci, James Thompson, ''Jane Austen and Co.: Remaking the Past in Contemporary Culture'', p. 254</ref> girl who enjoys [[Regency era]] literature and has a crush on Tom; and Charlie, an overly philosophical [[nerd]]<ref name="Cinema199" /> with an unrequited love for Audrey. Tom learns that he and the Rat Pack have some common friends, including his ex-girlfriend Serena Slocumb, with whom he remains infatuated.   Under Nick's tutelage, Tom ingratiates himself to the Rat Pack and soon becomes a full-fledged member. Much of the film is composed of [[dialogue]]s in which Tom and the Rat Pack discuss the nebulous social scene they occupy, including how they are coming of age just as the [[yuppie]] culture in which they were raised is ending, leaving them with uncertain social futures. During these discussions, Tom reveals that he, too, was raised wealthy, but that his father abandoned the family to marry another woman, leaving Tom and his mother with limited financial resources. As a result, Tom harbors a love-hate relationship with wealth and the upper class.  Serena has been dating Rick Von Sloneker, a young, [[Hereditary title|titled]] [[aristocrat]] notorious for his [[womanizing]]. At a party after the [[International Debutante Ball]], Nick alienates himself from the group by accusing Rick of getting a girl drunk and convincing her to "[[group sex|pull a train]]" several years before, after which she committed suicide. Other members of the Rat Pack point out holes in Nick's story. Nick later admits that the story was not literally true but a "composite" of incidents from Rick's life. Shortly thereafter, Nick leaves Manhattan, giving Tom his [[top hat]] as a token of friendship.   Believing that Tom is not interested in her romantically, Audrey decides to leave Manhattan to spend the rest of vacation in [[the Hamptons]] with Rick and another girl from the Rat Pack. Realizing that he's developed feelings for Audrey, Tom recruits Charlie to help him rescue her from Rick. The two travel to the Hamptons together, bonding en route. Against their expectations, they arrive to find Audrey in no peril. Tom and Charlie nonetheless instigate a fight with Rick, which ends with them being kicked out of his beach house. Afterward, Tom and Audrey talk on the beach, with Audrey saying that she is planning to attend college in France, and Tom contemplating going to visit her there. The film ends with Tom, Audrey, and Charlie [[hitchhiking]] together towards Manhattan.

Michael Madana Kama Rajan
  Venugopal, a wealthy industrialist, marries a woman named Sushila and they have quadruplets. His brother Nandagopal tries to have her and the newborns killed by hired goons. However, the leader of the goons has no desire to kill the babies, so he adopts one (Michael), leaves one in an orphanage (Raju), one in a temple (Kameshwaran) who is picked by Palakkad Mani Iyer, a [[Brahmin]], and one (Madhan) in a car that belongs to Venugopal.  30 years later, Madhan is now a [[London]]-educated businessman. Venugopal has raised Madhan as his adopted son, not knowing that he is his biological son. Venugopal is killed by Nandagopal and his nephew, Ramu for his inheritance, but unknown to them, the will has already named Madhan as the beneficiary. Madhan returns to [[Bangalore]] from England to take over his father's company. He confronts Avinashi, his father’s assistant, over his embezzlement, while reluctantly promising to forgive him if Avinashi accepted his culpability.  Meanwhile, in [[Chennai]], Michael, like his foster father, has become a petty criminal, and while escaping with his foster father from the police, accidentally causes a fire in an art gallery where artist Shalini's paintings are being displayed for exhibition. This brings in the firefighter, Raju, who saves Shalini and her paintings, leading to romance. Raju is also in debt to a money-lender over a failed stage play. While evading him, Kameshwaran is introduced as a cook for weddings and special events. He meets Thirupurasundari and her [[kleptomania]]c grandmother. Eventually Kameshwaran marries Thirupurasundari.  Someone contacts Madhan over phone and tells him that his father's death was no accident, but that it was planned, and gives him an address in Chennai and a time to meet. After some distractions involving a woman named Chakkubai and her mother Gangubai, Madhan meets the caller, Sushila, who, unknown to him, is his biological mother. While escaping from goons sent by Ramu in a car, Madhan meets Raju, and hires him to impersonate him in Bangalore while Madhan investigates in Chennai. Meanwhile, Ramu and Nandagopal have hired Michael to kill Madhan. Michael sabotages Madhan's car, not realising it is Raju and not Madhan. The brakes fail on the highway, but Raju brings the car to a safe stop. Sushila meets with him thinking he is Madhan, but he redirects her to the real Madhan in Chennai. Raju, Shalini and her father arrive at Madhan's house in Bangalore. Raju confiscates Avinashi's money not knowing Madhan's deal with Avinashi.  Meanwhile, Michael finds the real Madhan in Chennai. Madhan and Chakkubai have fallen in love and Madhan presents her with an [[Engagement ring|ring]]; unknown to them, they are being spied on by Michael and his foster father. Michael follows Madhan, Chakkubai, Gangubai and Sushila to Sushila's home where it is revealed that Madhan's father is alive but dazed from the assassination attempt. Michael and his foster father arrive at the scene. Sushila recognises the father as the person who had taken her quadruplets and realises that Michael and Madhan are both her biological sons. Michael and his father knock all of them unconscious and kidnap Madhan and the others to a mountain cabin near Bangalore.  Avinashi chances upon Kameshwaran on his wedding day, and hires him to impersonate Madhan to retrieve the money that Raju confiscated. Back in Madhan's house in Bangalore, Raju and Shalini plan to meet without her father knowing. Avinashi drugs Raju’s soup but the soup is drunk by Madhan's bodyguard Bheem. Raju and Shalini meet and profess their love for one another. Michael and his father arrive at Madhan's house to loot it. Michael sees Raju, mistakes him for Madhan and thinks that Madhan has escaped from the cabin. He knocks Raju unconscious. Avinashi sees the unconscious Raju, assumes it was the effect of his drugged soup, and brings Kameshwaran into the house to retrieve his money. Kameshwaran is mistaken for Raju by Shalini who then tries to get intimate with him. Thirupu and her grandmother drag Kameshwaran away from her. Shalini then witnesses Kameshwaran hugging Thirupu. This enrages her as she thinks that Raju is two-timing her. To add to the hilarity, Chakkubai and Gangubai also arrive at the house in search of Madhan. Chakkubai mistakes Kameshwaran for Madhan and introduces herself to everyone as Madhan’s fiancée, much to Avinashi's dismay, as his plan of using Kameshwaran to access Madhan's money keeps getting comically disrupted first by Raju's then by Madhan's girlfriend. Shalini takes a hunting rifle and holds everyone at gunpoint. Avinashi and the rest try to tell her that Kameshwaran is not Madhan/Raju but she does not believe them. Meanwhile, the real Madhan has escaped the cabin with his parents and comes to the house. In the midst of all this confusion, Michael steals Madhan's wealth and escapes to the cabin. The rest of the crew follows them back to the cabin in multiple cars.  Ramu and Nandagopal are already present in the cabin and hold everyone at gunpoint as they arrive one by one. All the brothers finally are in the same room at the same time and Sushila tells them that they are her quadruplets. The presence of all the people in the small cabin causes it to tilt over the cliff edge. The bad men are knocked out and the four brothers work together to safely get everyone out of the cabin. Everyone is happy as they are finally together.

Mo' Better Blues
 The film begins with a scene set in Brooklyn, New York in 1969.  A group of four boys walk up to Bleek Gilliam's brownstone and ask him to come out and play baseball with them. Bleek's mother insists that he continue his trumpet lesson, to his chagrin. His father becomes concerned that Bleek will grow up to be a sissy, and a family argument ensues.  In the end, Bleek continues playing his trumpet, and his friends go away.  The next scene brings us to the present (over twenty years later), with an adult Bleek ([[Denzel Washington]]) performing on the trumpet at a busy nightclub with his jazz band, The Bleek Quintet ([[Jeff "Tain" Watts]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]] and [[Bill Nunn]]). Giant ([[Spike Lee]], one of his boyhood friends from the previous scene and current manager of Bleek's band), is waiting in the wings, and advises him to stop allowing his [[saxophone]] player Shadow Henderson (Snipes) to grandstand with long solos.  The next morning Bleek wakes up with his girlfriend, Indigo Downes ([[Joie Lee]]). She leaves to go to class, while he meets his father by the Brooklyn Bridge for a game of catch, telling him that while he does like Indigo, he likes other women too and is not ready to make a commitment. Later in the day while he is practicing his trumpet, another woman named Clarke Bentancourt ([[Cynda Williams]]) visits him. She suggests he fire Giant as his manager; he suggests that they make love (which he refers to as "mo’ better"). She bites his lip and he becomes upset about it, saying, "I make my living with my lips", as he examines the bleeding bottom lip.  Giant is with his bookie, betting on baseball. Then he goes to the nightclub and argues with the doormen about what time to let the patrons into the club. He meets Bleek inside with the rest of the band, except for the pianist, Left Hand Lacey (Esposito), who arrives late with his French girlfriend and is scolded by Giant. Later Giant goes to the club owners’ office, points out how busy the club has been since Bleek and his band began playing there, and unsuccessfully attempts to renegotiate their contract.  Giant meets his bookie ([[Rubén Blades]]) the next morning, who is concerned that Giant is going too deep into debt. Giant shrugs it off, and places several new bets. He then stops off at Shadow's home to drop off a record. Shadow confides in him that he is cheating on his girlfriend. This leads to the next scene where Bleek is in bed with Clarke, and she asks him to let her sing a number at the club with his band, to which he declines.  Bleek and Giant are fending off requests from the other members of the band, especially Shadow, for a raise due to the band's success at the club. Bleek goes to the club owners to see about more money, which they refuse, reminding him that it was Giant who locked him into the current deal.  That night at the club, both Clarke and Indigo arrive at the club to see Bleek. They are wearing the same style dress, which Bleek had purchased for them both. Bleek attempts to work it out with each girl, but they are both upset with him over the dresses, and though he sleeps with them each again they leave him (after he calls each of them by the other's name). However, tension rises with Shadow, who has feelings for Clarke.  Bleek and Giant go for a bike ride, where Bleek insists to Giant that he do a better job managing and bringing in money. Giant promises to do so, then asks Bleek for a loan to pay off his gambling debt. Bleek declines, and later Giant is apprehended by two loan sharks ([[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Leonard L. Thomas]]) who demand payment. Giant can’t pay and gets his fingers broken. Later Giant tells Bleek that he fell off his bike on the ride home, but Bleek doesn't buy it. Giant asks the other band members for money and Left loans him five hundred dollars. When loan sharks stake out Giant's home, he goes to Bleek for a place to stay. Bleek agrees to help him raise the money, but fires him as manager.  Bleek misses both his girlfriends, leaving messages for each, but Clarke has begun a new relationship with Shadow. Bleek finds out about it, and fires Shadow after the two fight backstage before a gig. The loan sharks track Giant down at the club before Bleek can come up with the money, take him outside and beat him while Bleek plays. Bleek goes outside to intervene, and gets beaten as well.  Additionally, one loan shark ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) takes Bleek's own trumpet, and smacks him across the face with it.  This not only puts Bleek in the hospital, but it also permanently injures his lip, making him unable to continue playing trumpet.  Months later, Bleek reunites with Giant, who has gotten a job as a doorman and stopped gambling. He drops in to see Shadow and Clarke, who are now performing together with the rest of Bleek's former band. Shadow invites him on stage, and they play together. Bleek still has scars to his lips, and is unable to play correctly. He walks off the stage, gives his trumpet to Giant, and goes directly to Indigo's house. She is angry with him because she hasn’t heard from him in over a year. She tries to reject him, but agrees to take him back when he begs her to save his life.  A montage flashes through their wedding, the birth of their son, Miles, and Bleek teaching his son to play the trumpet.  In the final scene of the movie, Miles is ten years old, and wants to go outside to play with his friends.   Indigo wants him to finish practicing his trumpet lessons.  However, unlike the (almost identical) opening scene in the beginning of the film, Bleek relents and allows his son to leave and play with friends. This final scene uses exactly the same dialogue as the first, with changes only in the delivery of the dialogue. A major part of the film's themes is cause and effect and fate. In letting Miles stop practicing which Bleek never did, then maybe his life will lead to an alternate, and ultimately happier, conclusion.  
Mirror, Mirror (film)
 In the 1950s, Mary Weatherford [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]]s her sister Elizabeth in front of a large, framed wooden [[mirror]], stabbing her to death on a bed. Decades later, Megan Gordon, a shy [[goths|goth]] teenager, moves into the home from [[Los Angeles]] with her recently widowed mother, Susan. In her new bedroom, Megan finds the large mirror in the corner, left behind by the previous owners. Emelin, the auctioneer in charge of the [[house clearance]], finds a cache of journals which describe the mirror's apparent possession by a demonic force able to grant wishes.  At her new school, Megan is taunted mercilessly by her peers, apart from the friendly Nikki and handsome jock Ron, who are kind to her.

Meanwhile, as Megan becomes drawn to the mirror in her room, she is plagued by bizarre incidents at home; her mother's dog mysteriously dies, she is visited by a gruesome apparition of her dead father, and the mirror begins inexplicably dripping blood. Megan becomes convinced that the mirror is responsible for a series of misfortunes involving those around her, including Charleen experiencing a massive nosebleed in the cafeteria, and her teacher, Mr. Anderson, having a severe asthma attack during class.  Realizing the mirror's powers, Megan begins harnessing them herself, using them to manipulate Jeff, Charleen's love interest, into developing a crush on her instead. When Jeff stops a sexual encounter, the demon in the mirror brutally murders him before making his body disappear. The next day, Emelin attempts to retrieve the mirror from the house while Megan and Susan are gone, but her hands are mysteriously impaled, leading her to flee.

Nikki becomes discomforted by Megan's change in personality, and is disturbed when Megan suggests she "helped" her usurp the class presidency. Nikki meets with Mrs. Perfili, the local real estate agent, and Emelin to inquire about the history of Megan's house and the mirror. Emelin reveals the content of the journals to Nikki, and explains that Mary Weatherford sacrificed her sister in front of the mirror decades ago hoping to appease it. After Nikki leaves, Emelin is impaled to death with a shard of glass at her antiques store.  That night, Ron is attacked by a [[doppelgänger]] of Nikki in his house and brutally murdered. After finding Ron's body, Nikki receives a phone call from Megan asking her to come to her house. Meanwhile, Susan has her hand mangled in the [[garbage disposal unit|garbage disposal]] in the kitchen and bleeds to death, leading Megan to turn against the mirror. Nikki arrives armed with a dagger and attempts to shatter the mirror, but it is resistant. She and Megan attempt to flee as a torrent of wind fills the house, but are unable to escape. Megan sacrifices herself to the mirror, thus ending its reign of terror. Nikki invokes the mirror, begging it to restore things back to how they were before. She awakens in the room on the bed, dagger in hand, with Megan's corpse beneath her, in the same position as Mary Weatherford, having been subjected to an apparent [[time loop]]. The demon shows itself in the mirror before retreating, and Nikki fearfully covers it with a sheet.  
Miracle Landing
 In February 1988, two pilots in a flight simulator face the challenge of landing a crippled jet that experiences a cabin decompression, an engine fire and a loss of hydraulics. The three simulated emergencies foreshadow the events of Paradise Airlines Flight 243, taking place two months later.   Three crew members: Madeleine "Mimi" Tompkins (Connie Sellecca), Captain Robert "Bob" Schornstheimer (Wayne Rogers) and Flight Attendant Michelle Honda (Ana Alicia) are flying together on Paradise Airlines Flight 243.  First Officer pilot Tompkins has been selected for training to become a full Captain in the airline, having been the first female pilot to be hired by Paradise in 1979.  Paradise Airlines 243 is an inter-island flight from Honolulu to Hilo, with a return to Honolulu the same day. The flight takes off over Hilo, and soon beverage service begins. During that time, nothing out of the ordinary occurs, but soon after, David Kornberg ([[Will Estes]]), a young boy travelling with his mother (Jane Daly), calls the lead flight attendant, C.B. Lansing (Nancy Kwan) and asks her about the crack appearing in the ceiling.   At that moment, chaos breaks loose and the entire front and top half section of the airliner, apart from  the cockpit and cargo hold, blows off in a clean separation.  In the chaos, Michelle falls to the floor and clings to a passenger's seat, C.B. is blown from the aircraft off-screen, and passengers are badly injured from debris and decompression. The third flight attendant Jane Sato-Tomita (Patty Toy) is thrown to the cabin floor and sustains serious head injuries, clinging to other passengers to avoid the same fate as C.B. The cockpit crew is unaware of the full scale of the disaster and believe a bomb or decompression has occurred. Soon passengers seated in the section that was not swept away have oxygen masks fall but it is useless as all the lines were destroyed. However, the aircraft was at a low altitude thus it had not affected them as badly. Mimi and Bob contact Kahului Airport to declare an emergency.  Soon, the pilots are faced with the fact they may crash and passengers would die, and both Mimi and Bob have flashbacks to her training days and his US Air Force times, respectively. Michelle has a flashback to walking the shoreline with her father who as a soldier in the Army, has died. Jane's injuries worsen and Michelle struggles to climb to her and help her. Later, she also feels she might lose it from the chaos and picks up the call phone only to find it dead.   Dorothy Hendricks (Herta Ware) leans out of the airliner and appears to have a state of shock before her husband George (Jack Murdock) notices and pulls her back inside. Michelle then begins to instruct the passengers on a possible crash landing or water landing and passes out life jackets. Gail Kornberg becomes hysterical when she cannot get a life jacket for David, but soon is calmed by Michelle. Roy Wesler (Glenn Cannon) panics when he sees [[hydraulic fluid]] leaking from the wings. The tower alerts Kahului Fire and Rescue personnel and they arrive before the crippled jet lands. Finally after several tense minutes, Mimi and Bob are able to figure out a plan for the emergency.  After some time, the airliner lands but with difficulties in the brakes and hydraulics. The pilots were worried that the landing might result in a broken aircraft and fire, but miraculously their landing resulted in no deaths and the emergency notification allowed crews to treat and evacuate passengers immediately.  
Misery (film)
 Famed novelist Paul Sheldon is the author of a successful series of [[Regency novel#Modern Regency fiction|Regency]] [[romance novel]]s featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Wanting to focus on more serious stories, he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-Misery career. While traveling from [[Silver Creek, Colorado]] to his home in [[New York City]], Paul is caught in a blizzard and his car goes off the road, rendering him unconscious. A nurse named [[Annie Wilkes]] finds Paul and brings him to her remote home.  Paul regains consciousness and finds himself bedridden with broken legs and a dislocated shoulder. Annie claims to be his "number one fan" and talks a lot about him and his novels. Out of gratitude, Paul lets Annie read his new manuscript. While feeding him, she is angered by the profanity in his new work and spills soup on him, but apologizes. Soon after, Annie reads the latest ''Misery'' novel, discovers that Misery dies at the end of the book, and flies into a rage. She reveals to Paul that nobody knows where he is, and locks him in his room.  The next morning, Annie forces Paul to burn his new manuscript. When he is well enough to get out of bed, she insists he write a new novel titled ''Misery's Return'', in which he brings the character back to life. Paul complies, believing Annie might kill him. One day, when Annie is away, Paul sneaks out and begins stockpiling his painkillers. He tries poisoning Annie during dinner, but fails. Paul later finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about Annie's past. He discovers that she was tried for the deaths of several infants, but the trial collapsed due to lack of evidence. Annie had quoted lines from his ''Misery'' novels during her trial. Annie later drugs Paul and straps him to the bed. When he wakes, she tells him that she knows he has been out of his room and breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to prevent him from escaping again.  The local sheriff, Buster, is investigating Paul's disappearance. When a shopkeeper informs the sheriff he has sold Annie considerable quantities of typing paper, Buster pays Annie a visit. When he finds Paul drugged in the basement, Annie shoots Buster and tells Paul that they must die together. He agrees, on the condition that he must finish the novel in order to "give Misery back to the world". He conceals a can of lighter fluid in his pocket.  When the manuscript is done, Paul asks for a single cigarette and a glass of champagne, to which Annie complies. Using the match Annie gives him, Paul sets the manuscript on fire, and as Annie rushes to save it, he hits her over the head with the typewriter. They fight and Annie is killed.  Eighteen months later, Paul, now walking with a cane, meets his agent, Marcia, in a restaurant in New York City. The two discuss his first non-''Misery'' novel, and Marcia tells him about the positive early buzz. Paul replies that he does not care, and that he wrote the novel for himself. Marcia asks if he would consider a non-fiction book about his captivity, but Paul declines. Seeing a waitress, he imagines her as Annie. The waitress says she is his "number one fan", to which Paul uncomfortably responds, "That's very sweet of you".

Moon 44
 By 2038, all of Earth's natural resources have been depleted. Multinational corporations have taken control of the galaxy and rival companies battle each other for access to mining planets. A major battle is for Moon 44, a fuel mining operation in the Outer Zone. It is the only installation still controlled by the Galactic Mining corporation. Moons 46, 47 and 51 have recently been overtaken by the Pyrite Defense Company's battle robots. Galactic Mining had its own defence system, helicopters capable of operating in the violent atmospheres of the moons, but it was cancelled as too many pilots died while in training. The company sends new navigators to Moon 44 to assist the pilots. However, there is still a shortage of pilots, so the company is forced to use prisoners. Galactic Mining regards its fleet of mining shuttles as even more important, so if the base is attacked, the shuttles are ordered to leave the crews behind.  Galactic Mining hires Felix Stone ([[Michael Paré]]), an undercover agent, to investigate the disappearance of two shuttles that went missing under mysterious circumstances. Stone travels to Moon 44 and meets chief navigator Tyler ([[Dean Devlin]]) who suspects the shuttles were stolen by somebody after they modified the flight computers. The mining operation's defence director, Major Lee ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) and his assistant, Master Sergeant Sykes ([[Leon Rippy]]) are the prime suspects. Stone later catches Sykes reprogramming a mining shuttle shortly before its departure. Sykes attacks Stone with an axe but is quickly gunned down by Lee, who then refuses to hand over the modified computer to Stone, citing "company orders".  Having concluded his investigation, Stone prepares to leave, but the mining operation is attacked by a Pyrite "Medusa"-class battle cruiser. Major Lee sabotaged the alarm systems and then orders all of the mining shuttles to return to  Earth. Stone manages to single-handedly shoot down the entire first wave of enemy attack drones, while prisoner O'Neal ([[Brian Thompson]]) stays behind to destroy the remaining drones as Lee's actions at the base are discovered.  Lee tries to sabotage the last remaining mining shuttle, but he is trapped in an elevator by Stone and blown up by his own bomb. The others return safely to Earth, where Stone informs the Galactic Mining Chairman ([[Roscoe Lee Browne]]) that Lee was bribed by Pyrite to redirect the mining shuttles to a planet in the Outer Zone.

Mr. Destiny
 The story begins on "the strangest day" of Larry Burrows' ([[James Belushi]]) life (his 35th birthday) consisting of a series of comic and dramatic misadventures. Larry, who blames all of his life's problems on the fact that he struck out during a key moment of his state high school baseball championship game on his 15th birthday, wishes he had done things differently. His wish is granted by a [[guardian angel]]-like figure named Mike ([[Michael Caine]]), who appears at various times as a [[bartender]], a cab driver, and so on. Larry soon discovers that Mike has transferred Larry into an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] in which he had won the pivotal high school game. He now finds himself rich and (within his company) powerful, and married to the boss's ([[Bill McCutcheon]]) sexy daughter Cindy Jo Bumpers ([[Rene Russo]]). At first, his new life seems perfect, but he soon begins to miss his best friend Clip Metzler ([[Jon Lovitz]]) and wife Ellen ([[Linda Hamilton]]) from his previous life; he also discovers that his alternative self has created many enemies, like Jewel Jagger ([[Courteney Cox]]), and as Larry's problems multiply, he finds himself wishing to be put back into his old life.  The story begins with Larry's car, an old [[Ford LTD (Americas)|Ford LTD]] station wagon, stalled out in a dark alley. Suddenly the pink lights of "The Universal Joint," a bar, come on. Larry goes inside to call a tow truck, and tells bartender Mike his troubles. He reviews the day he just had, which ended with his getting fired after discovering his department head Niles Pender's ([[Hart Bochner]]) scheme to sell the company under the nose of its owners to a group of naive Japanese investors.  He tells Mike that he wishes he'd hit that last pitch out of the park, after which Mike fixes him a drink called "The Spilt Milk." The Spilt Milk was a drink that gave him his wish that he hit that home run in that championship game.  Larry leaves the bar, walks home (his car apparently towed) and discovers someone else living in his house, which is now fixed up (previously his yard and driveway were muddy and unfinished). Mike appears as a cab driver and drives him to his "new" home, a mansion in Forest Hills, explaining that he did in fact hit the last pitch and won the game.  He soon discovers that Cindy Jo is his wife and he's the president of his company, Liberty Republic Sporting Goods. Being a classic car buff, he's shocked to find that he owns a collection of priceless antique automobiles.  Larry soon discovers that Clip has a low-level job in the accounting department and is quite insecure, as opposed to the jokester he was before. Ellen is shop steward (in both realities) and is married to another man. Jewel, a forklift operator in the previous reality, is now Larry's mistress and his secretary. Ellen hates Larry and he discovers that the union is threatening a walkout due to massive layoffs and increased production, since Niles is selling Liberty Republic in both realities. Seeing Ellen, he realizes how much he misses her and agrees to all the union's demands, providing Ellen agrees to dinner at his favorite restaurant. She reluctantly agrees, and Larry eventually convinces her that they were married in a previous life.  After discovering that Larry has agreed to union demands, Niles takes revenge, by telling both Cindy Jo and Jewel of Larry's dinner date with Ellen. He then plots to kill Larry at the office that night. However, company owner Leo Hansen arrives to deliver a note to Larry, announcing his [[Termination of employment|termination]], and Niles kills him by mistake. Discovering the note, Niles calls the police who attempt to arrest Larry for Leo's murder. Larry escapes while jealous Jewel creates pandemonium outside in her attempts to shoot him (and shoots out a number of police cars in the process), leading to a police chase. Larry is eventually cornered in a dark alley, but the pink glow of "The Universal Joint" comes on and he runs into the bar. Unable to find Mike, Larry attempts to make the "Spilt Milk" himself, the ingredients clearly aged.  The flashing lights of the police cars appear and Larry surrenders, but instead of cops, a tow truck driver named Duncan enters (the police car lights now tow truck lights). Confused at first, Larry sees Mike back behind the bar and realizes he's back in his old life. Larry thanks Mike for everything and, upon exiting the bar, suddenly realizes that the deal with the Japanese investors is happening shortly. Driven by Duncan to company headquarters, Larry barges into the boardroom, decks Niles and exposes his scheme just as Leo is about to sign the deal.  Thinking everyone forgot his birthday, Larry returns home (which still has the muddy driveway and lawn) to a [[surprise party]] with his family and friends in attendance. Soon after, Cindy Jo and her husband Jackie Earle ([[Jay O. Sanders]]), the company president, arrive. Jackie offers Niles' job to Larry, plus a company car, a new Mercedes, and he accepts.   Back in the past, young Larry is about to leave the stadium, still upset about the loss, when he's approached by a mysterious stranger (Mike) who reassures him that everything will be all right. Larry thanks him for the reassurance, but walks off wondering who Mike thinks he's kidding.

Mounam Sammadham
 The plot revolves around the wrong conviction of a business man and the efforts taken by the protagonist, a lawyer, to find the truth. The portrayal of the characters is similar in many ways to Malayalam cinema's investigative thrillers. The suspense is well maintained until the climax with little clue to the audience on the identity of the real culprit. The arguments in court were mostly inspired from ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957).  
Music Box (film)
 [[Chicago]] defense attorney Anne Talbot learns that her father, Hungarian immigrant Michael J. Laszlo, is in danger of having his [[U.S. citizenship]] revoked. The reasons are that he stands accused of [[war crimes]]. He insists that it is a case of mistaken identity. Against the advice of her former [[father-in-law]], corporate attorney Harry Talbot, Anne resolves to defend her father in court. One of her reasons is how deeply her son, Mikey, loves and admires his grandfather.   According to prosecuting attorney Jack Burke of the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|Office of Special Investigations]], Michael Laszlo is not, as he claims, a simple political refugee, regular churchgoer, and family man. Rather, he is "Mishka," the former commander of an Arrow Cross [[death squad]]. During the [[Siege of Budapest]], Mishka's unit sadistically tortured and murdered scores of [[Hungarian Jews]], [[Hungarian Gypsies|Roma]], and their Gentile protectors. To Anne, these allegations are absurd. The loving single father who raised her could not possibly have committed such crimes.   Later, Jack Burke tells Anne that her father has no conscience, zero [[empathy]], and that his love for his family is a façade. An enraged Anne replies by accusing Burke of murdering his recently deceased wife.  Meanwhile, her father's accounts reveal large payments to a fellow Hungarian immigrant named Tibor Zoldan. Her father claims these were loans to help a destitute friend and which he was unable to repay before his death.  As the hearing unfolds before a Jewish judge named Irwin Silver, the crimes of Mishka's unit are described in grisly testimony by the few who survived contact with them. All the witnesses identify Anne's father as the man who tortured them. Equally damning is an Arrow Cross identification card that bears his photograph and the name, "Laszlo Miklos." An [[FBI]] agent initially confirms its authenticity. Her father claims that this is all a frame-up by [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary's then Communist government]] and its [[secret police]], the [[State Protection Authority|ÁVO]]. He says that it is retaliation for his protest against the U.S. tour of a Hungarian ballet troupe several years earlier.   Anne locates a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[defector]] who testifies about the [[KGB]]'s program to produce flawless forgeries of such documents to frame anti-Communists in the West. The defector further explains that this technique was shared with every [[secret police]] service in the [[Soviet Bloc]]. He explains that the Hungarian ÁVO was "very interested" in this tactic. This revelation, combined with Anne's questioning the reliability of witnesses who still live under a [[police state]], throws Burke's case into serious doubt.  Burke then announces that there is a witness who can testify that Michael Laszlo is "Mishka." Due to his medical problems, however, he is incapable of leaving [[Budapest]]. Anne, Burke, and Judge Silver travel to Hungary. Anne's father refuses, claiming that the Communists will assassinate him if he returns. Before her departure, Anne's legal assistant brings more details about Tibor Zoldan, who died in a hit-and-run car accident. She further declares "It feels like Tibor Zoldan was [[blackmail]]ing your father." She gives Anne the address of Tibor's sister Magda.  At her Budapest hotel, Anne is visited by a mysterious man who claims to be a friend of her father. He leaves a box with a hidden folder of documents. The next day, after hearing the damning testimony of the witness, Anne produces the documents — signed past affidavits in which the witness had identified three completely different men as "Mishka."   Despite the pleading of Burke and the witness, Judge Silver dismisses the prosecution's case. A devastated Burke tells Anne that, while it is too late to save the victims, he thinks that it is important to remember what happened to them. He accuses Anne of living in a fantasy world and urges her to visit the bridge where Mishka threw his victims into the [[Danube River]]. At the time, the [[Red Army]] was [[Battle of Berlin|storming Berlin]] and the [[Second World War]] was effectively over, yet Hungarians were still massacring their Jewish countrymen. An infuriated Anne screams "Some Hungarians! Not my father!"  As Anne's local guide is driving her back to her hotel, they casually pass through [[Chain Bridge (Budapest)|Széchenyi Lánchíd]], which is the bridge mentioned several times earlier in the court testimonies as the place of Mishka's executions. Anne asks the driver to stop so she can have a walk. After looking down on the river and seeing the place of the atrocities, Anne takes a cab to Magda Zoldan's apartment.  Anne introduces herself saying she knew Tibor, so Magda welcomes her warmly and mentions that the only thing she has of Tibor's is his wallet, sent to her by the [[Chicago Police Department]]. She produces from it a [[pawn shop]] ticket. Saying that she has little else to remember her brother, Magda implores Anne to retrieve whatever Tibor pawned and mail it to her. Before leaving, a horrified Anne sees a picture of young Tibor with a characteristic scar on his left face, and realizes he had been Mischka's Arrow Cross partner in the atrocities, also mentioned several times in the testimonies.  Back in Chicago, Anne visits the pawn shop and retrieves Tibor's music box. Anne winds it up and watches it go, taken in by its charm. Then, Anne sobs inconsolably as the music box dispenses a set of old black-and-white photographs. They depict her youthful father in an Arrow Cross uniform -- sadistically torturing and murdering Jewish men, women, and children.  At a party at Harry Talbot's mansion to celebrate the dismissal of the case, Anne confronts her father, accusing him of being Mishka and of running down Tibor Zoldan with his car. With bottomless self-pity, her father laments that "the Communists" have poisoned his daughter against him. Visibly sickened, Anne asks her father why he cannot just tell her the truth.  In the film's climax, Anne tells her father that she does not ever want herself or Mikey to ever see him again. Her father calmly explains that Mikey will never believe her. As Anne watches in silent horror, "Mishka" goes out to play with his grandson.  Anne is then seen typing a letter to Jack Burke, saying that she went to the Danube. She encloses Tibor Zoldan's photographs and negatives in the envelope.   Anne picks up a newspaper with a front-page headline: "Mike Laszlo: War Criminal! Justice Department Releases Atrocity Photos." The film fades out as Anne stops Mikey from going to school and sits down to talk to him.

Here, Jules decides to educate Joseph on hunting. Marcel wants to come hunting with them, but the two adults lie to him and leave the house while he is still just waking up. He follows them stealthily and is angered by the way Jules makes a fool of Joseph with his hunting prowess. Marcel is lost in the wilderness when he meets a boy called Lili, who tells him where the hunting party is. Joseph takes potshots at two rock partridges and they fall to ground beside Marcel. He watches as Jules reprimands Joseph for shooting at and missing the birds. At this point, Marcel reveals himself and the partridges.  Later, Lili, who knows everything about the countryside, becomes Marcel's friend and teaches him about the ways of the countryside. They regularly go exploring in the hills of Provence, in southern France.  As the holiday comes to an end, Marcel plans with Lili to hide himself in a cave and live there as a hermit, in order to continue living in Provence, of which he has grown very fond. On the day of his family's departure, Marcel gets up early in the morning. He has written a letter for this purpose earlier, explaining his disappearance to his parents, and excusing his behaviour. He warns them that they will not be able to find him in his "new home," and should not bother searching. He then walks to the cave with Lili, who has been waiting for him near his house. As they arrive, Marcel begins to become afraid of living alone. He invents all kinds of excuses to avoid living in the cave. He then runs home quickly to prevent his parents reading the letter, which he had placed on his pillow. As he returns home, everyone is already busy loading up a carriage for the journey home. He runs up to his room, and discovers that the letter is still on his pillow, and he assumes that no one has read it. As he gets ready to leave the house for a last time, his parents make a remark which indicates that they in fact did read the letter. The film ends with Marcel and his family departing in a coach, and Lili looking on.

Following the summer holiday which features in ''[[My Father's Glory (film)|My Father's Glory]]'', the family returns to [[Marseilles]] but Marcel still yearns for the hills. His wish is granted when they return for the Christmas holiday, much to Marcel's delight. Although only a few kilometers outside Marseilles, the journey to the holiday home is time consuming as [[public transport]] takes them only a short portion of the way and the rest is a walk along a long, winding road.   Marcel then tells of an encounter with a girl, Isabelle. He meets her whilst out in the hills collecting thyme for his mother, and they plan to meet at her house in the future to play. On his first visit to her house he meets her mother, an eccentric who appears to disapprove of his scruffy demeanour. On a subsequent visit, Marcel meets her father, another eccentric who drinks absinthe to aid his poetic composition. Isabelle herself is also a bit strange, always dressing up in different dresses, and demanding that Marcel dress up as a dog, a soldier, and a slave. When they play, Isabelle commands Marcel to do various tasks, which he obliges. At one point, she tells him to close his eyes and open his mouth. She then feeds him a grasshopper. Lili and Paul, Marcel's younger brother, observe this, and they report it to Marcel's father. He then forbids Marcel to continue meeting "with that crazy girl". Marcel later observes the departure of Isabelle and her family.  One day, when travelling to their house, the family encounters one of Marcel's father's former pupils, who now works in maintaining a canal which runs from the hills into Marseilles. The canal runs across private estates and so he is issued with a key which allows him to pass through several locked doors along the towpath. The employee points out to the family that this is a shortcut which will allow them to reach their house in a fraction of the journey time and offers them his spare key. Marcel's father, being honest and upright realises that this would amount to trespassing. He nevertheless accepts the key after much persuasion from his family for use in an emergency.  Despite his reservations, the family use the key more and more and the reduced journey time allows them to visit the holiday home every weekend. They still have an apprehension each time they unlock a door fearing they will be caught. As time passes, however, they encounter the owner of one property and the groundsman of another, who are friendly and quite happy that they cross their land.  At the beginning of the summer holidays they make the journey again and Marcel's mother feels a great fear and trepidation of meeting the owner. When they reach the final door they discover it has been padlocked. They are confronted by the caretaker of the final property who has been watching them for some time and who decides to make an official report.  Marcel's father is devastated, believing a complaint could damage his career prospects and he could possibly lose his job as a [[Teacher|school teacher]]. The employees of the canal however, confront the caretaker threatening him with prosecution for having unlawfully padlocked one of the company's doors. The caretaker withdraws his complaint against Marcel's family and the matter is concluded. Unfortunately during the ordeal between the canal workers and the caretaker they take the padlock, put it around the gate, and give the key to his dog so he can't leave the estate.  The epilogue mentions that uncle Jules hired a carriage for the family. The film jumps 5 years to the future, telling of the death of Marcel's mother. It also tells of Lili and Paul: Paul was a goatherd in the countryside of the Provence, until his sudden death at the age of 31. Lili is killed in 1917, during the First World War. Marcel is the only one left of their childhood company, now a successful [[film director]]. His company has purchased a large old house in the Marseilles area to turn into a [[film studio]]. When walking through the grounds he sees a familiar door and realizes that this is the last property on his childhood journey to his [[holiday home]].

The Nameless (film)
  In Spain, the vanished six-year-old daughter of the editor Claudia and her husband Marc is found completely mutilated in a well by the police, being recognized by her husband only due to a bracelet and leg defect (one legbone is shorter than the other). The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive.  Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers.  Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help.  After visiting a now-deserted clinic where she used to take her daughter (she has footage of it on a home video of herself and Angela), and finding strange pictures of angels there, Claudia calls a recently retired cop, Massera, to investigate the matter. She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find.  Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. He teams up with [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] journalist Quiroga, a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia's phone number written on the label. The tape shows what appears to be the murder or torture of a naked woman, and also footage of Claudia when she visited the derelict clinic.  Visiting a theological expert at the university, the two begin to uncover a bizarre [[cult]] called ''The Nameless'' that is said to sacrifice children. The cult was led by a now-imprisoned man called Santini who believed in absolute evil, and created his cult which also links to Germany's [[Thule Society]]. A doctor who helped him was also arrested but was released for lack of evidence. To make matters worse, Claudia finds herself stalked by psychotic ex-boyfriend Toni. Toni meets a strange man with a scarred eye in a bar (the man has previously encountered Claudia on a train); they decide to go see Claudia, and are followed by mysterious figures as they leave.  Meanwhile, Claudia visits Massera because she is scared to stay at home. She learns his wife died the year before. They then go to visit the prison where Santini is held. Santini has a degenerative skin disease which is believed to be due to inoculations he was given as a prisoner in the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Santini talks to Claudia cryptically but though he talks about the painful experience of having been placed in a cobalt capsule at the concentration camp, and how he has 'vermin' inside of him, Claudia pleads with him to reveal Angela's whereabouts but he only tells her to think, and says that Angela is in the place 'where the whole thing began'. It soon becomes evident that while Santini may be in jail, his followers are still at large; as Claudia returns to her apartment, she finds Toni murdered, along with another cryptic message.  The trail leads to an abandoned hotel where Angela was conceived years ago. Quiroga scouts ahead, soon followed by Massera; both men are quickly subdued and slain by cult members. Another call from Angela urges Claudia to investigate. On the site the woman is greeted by the cultists, among them Marc, her own husband. He reveals it was their plan all along to lead her to their den. Claudia then confronts her now grown daughter, alive and well, but twisted and indoctrinated by the cult with the intent to create a perfect evil being. It is now her task to commit the ultimate atrocity and kill her own mother. However, Angela attacks Marc instead and briefly seems to resist the indoctrination – before proclaiming she has in fact prepared an even more sinister plan and does not wish to share its fruits with the cult. She proclaims to Claudia that she will "see her later" and that she is going to be a [[saint]], before putting the gun in her mouth and pulling the trigger.

Navy SEALs (film)
 The , an aircraft carrier on station in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]], receives a [[mayday (distress signal)|mayday]] from a cargo ship. The ship reports that they have been attacked, are on fire and adrift. A deployed Navy [[SH-3]] helicopter attempts to rescue the crew, but is downed by a gunboat and the aircrew is captured.  Meanwhile, a squad of [[United States Navy SEALs]] ([[Charlie Sheen]], [[Michael Biehn]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], [[Rick Rossovich]], [[Cyril O'Reilly]], [[Bill Paxton]], and Paul Sanchez) are recovering from a [[bachelor party]]. Graham (Haysbert) is to be married, but the wedding is canceled at the last minute when the whole Team is [[Pager|paged]] to rescue the captured aircrew.  In the Mediterranean, the leader of the terrorists that shot at the Navy helicopter, Ben Shaheed, ([[Nicholas Kadi]]), orders the execution of the hostages. One crewmember is executed on the spot and another is beaten up, but the SEAL team arrives just in time to prevent any further executions. Responding to a suspicious noise, Hawkins (Sheen) breaks silence when he encounters Shaheed in an adjoining room, inadvertently alerting the terrorists. Shaheed claims to be an Egyptian sailor also being held by the terrorists, and is left by the SEALs. As the SEALs evacuate the hostages from the area, Hawkins and Graham stumble across a warehouse containing [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missile]]s. Hawkins attempts to return to the warehouse to destroy the missiles, only to be ordered by Curran (Biehn) to proceed with extraction.  On board an aircraft carrier later that night, the individual Team members are debriefed by Naval Intelligence. Curran's decision to leave the Stinger missiles behind is questioned, but Curran retorts that his primary mission was to rescue the aircrew and that Naval Intelligence did not do their job properly. Meanwhile, Hawkins is highly agitated by the mission and has trouble dealing with the emotional upheaval the mission provided. Curran tries to calm him down but is rebuffed by Hawkins.  At [[the Pentagon]], Shaheed is seen in a video interview. The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] identify Shaheed and his organization, the Al Shudadah. They also identify the interviewer as Claire Varrens ([[Joanne Whalley-Kilmer]]), a journalist and author who is half Lebanese. Her questioning of Shaheed yields an admission that he and his group participated in the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983]]. Shaheed admits the complicity freely, saying they only sought revenge for the bombing of their homes by Navy ships and warplanes. The Joint Chiefs are briefed on the recent mission and Curran requests permission to destroy the Stingers, but Navy Intelligence has learned they have already been relocated. The SEALs are ordered on R&R and enjoy a game of golf.  Curran, brooding over the previous mission, reads a book authored by Varrens. During the golf outing, Graham convinces his fiancée ([[S. Epatha Merkerson]]) to try to finish the wedding again, regardless of the hazards of Graham's job.  The team receives their orders for the next mission. Naval Intelligence has heard that the Stinger missiles are on board a merchant ship, the ''Latanya'', off the coast of Syria. The SEALs deploy from a submerged submarine, the USS ''Nyack'', and successfully board the ship, neutralizing two disguised gunmen, only to find out from an [[Bomb Disposal|EOD]] team that the missiles are not on board after all.  Frustrated by the recent unreliable intelligence, Curran solicits Varrens's cooperation. Curran takes Claire on a tour of Navy SEAL training and attempts to woo the journalist over an elegant dinner. Claire is initially wary but opens up to Curran after learning that a Stinger has been used to shoot down a peace delegation in Lebanon. Claire provides pictures of men she has encountered who may possibly provide information that may lead the SEALs to the location of the missiles. While trying to identify possible contacts, Claire tells Curran and Hawkins that one of her contacts is missing, most likely having been kidnapped by the Israelis. Inspired by this, and an outburst by Hawkins, Curran presents the idea of kidnapping a potential informant to his superiors who subsequently recommend the proposal at a National Security Council meeting. A [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] executive at the meeting identifies one of the targets as a known CIA informant who could be co-opted if taken into custody. On that basis, the SEALs are authorized to bring him in.  The SEALS infiltrate the area by performing a HALO jump and swimming to shore. Curran leads several of the team inside a house to secure the informant while Hawkins, Ramos, and Graham remain outside. When Ramos is pinned down by patrolling militia, Hawkins disobeys Curran's order to stay quiet and instigates a firefight. Although Hawkins finally succeeds in killing the militiamen, Graham is killed during the firefight.  Curran reluctantly informs Graham's fiancée of his death, and a funeral with [[full military honors]] is held. After the wake, the men drown their sorrows at a pizza bar. Hawkins gives a toast to Graham for being the best friend a guy could have. Curran scolds Hawkins for his carelessness that caused Graham's death. Later, Claire arrives at Curran's houseboat to find a still grieving Curran, leafing to a night of intimacy. Curran quietly leaves the next morning with Claire in bed.  The SEALs are deployed to Beirut, this time to meet a local resistance fighter who will guide them to the building containing the Stingers. Although Dane (Paxton) is killed while attempting to set up a sniping [[overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] position, the SEALs do locate the Stingers in an old school building in a heavily-bombed area of the city. Curran leads Leary (Rossovich) and Rexer (O'Reilly) inside the building to destroy the missiles while Hawkins and Ramos maintain overwatch outside. Hawkins shoots a local gunman questioning him, alerting the terrorists. Leaving the building, Curran gets shot in the abdomen and thigh. Curran is pinned down near the building door and orders Hawkins to destroy the building regardless of Curran's being in the blast radius. Hawkins disobeys the order and rescues Curran while the other SEALs provide [[suppressing fire]] before the building is finally destroyed. The SEALs commandeer a car and attempt to exfiltrate from the city while evading pursuit by an enemy [[BTR-152]] with a machine gun. The automobile is eventually hit by gunfire and Rexer killed by a stray bullet to the head. Leary, using a recovered Stinger missile launcher, manages to destroy the APC, and the four remaining SEALs escape to the beach.  Shaheed steals a boat from a pier-side fisherman and follows the SEALs across the water. He spots Curran's body floating in the sea. As he attempts to pull the body from the water he is attacked by the SEALs and, in an underwater fight, Hawkins kills Shaheed. The other SEALs take out the remaining topside terrorists and destroy the small boat. With the mission finally accomplished, the designated exfiltration submarine surfaces, recovering the SEALs.  
The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter
  Bastian Bux is having troubles at home: his father Barney's busy workload is keeping him from consoling Bastian's [[Acrophobia|fear of heights]], which in turn is hurting his chances of joining the school swim team. As such, he then heads to an old bookstore where he again meets Mr. Coreander, who proceeds to help find a book on courage. While waiting, Bastian rediscovers the Neverending Story's book, and is shocked to see its words disappear off its pages. Deciding to take the book instead, Bastian returns home and finds himself able to claim AURYN right off the book's front cover while hearing the Childlike Empress summon him to Fantasia.  Aware of Bastian's arrival and purpose, an evil sorceress named [[Xayide]] orders a creation from one of her servants to stop him. The servant creates a memory machine that will strip Bastian of a memory each time he uses AURYN until he is unable to remember where he came from, or why he is in Fantasia. Xayide then sends a [[bird]]-like creature named Nimbly to persuade Bastian into making him wish. As the two arrive in a populated area of Fantasia called Silver City, the sorceress sends large monsters referred to as giants to attack. Despite Nimbly's attempts to make him wish them away, Bastian is able to escape from them without doing so. After falling into a secret passage, Bastian is contacted by the Childlike Empress, who tells him of a new threatening force to Fantasia, which is keeping her prisoner in her own castle as well as causing the stories of the ordinary world to disappear, and that he must identify and defeat it.  While trying to gather Silver City's inhabitants to help him out, Bastian is reunited with Atreyu, who has heard about what has happened and reveals that the giants come from Horok Castle, "The Seeing Hand". As the two try to figure out how to get there, Nimbly manages to persuade Bastian into making a wish, which he uses to create a vicious, fire breathing dragon. However, it goes out of control and flies off with Atreyu trying to pursue it with his horse, Artax. With help from Falkor, Bastian is able to chase the dragon to Xayide's castle, where it is destroyed by its defenses. After a brief reunion with Rock Biter, Bastian and Atreyu, who has caught up, make their way into the castle's entrance with the latter's "army": several wind up toys. Although Bastian gets through, Atreyu is captured. Once getting further into the castle by wishing for climbing steps, Bastian manages to free Atreyu from a giant and the two battle it with the use of a spray can, an item the former had wished for. After the giant falls over and cracks into pieces revealing a hollow shell, Bastian identifies the threat as "The Emptiness", the form of humanity's dying imagination. The two make their way to Xayide in her throne room who admits defeat, stating she had wanted to bring order to dreams and stories, which she consider as forms of chaos. The sorceress is then forced to bring them to the Childlike Empress' castle to free her after Atreyu subtly threatens to kill her.  Having noticed his son's disappearance and the Neverending Story's book, Barney takes the latter to Mr. Coreander's bookstore to ask him of Bastian's whereabouts. The owner simply tells him that he will find the answers inside the book, much to Barney's confusion. Returning later with a police officer, he is shocked to see the bookstore abandoned as a result of the Emptiness. Eventually, Barney reads the book and is surprised to see his son's exploits in Fantasia being written by the book itself and that he is mentioned within.  During the travel to the Childlike Empress' castle, Xayide tries to trick Bastian into believing that his friends will turn against him and manages to get him to wish for a series of ridiculous wishes. It also becomes obvious to Atreyu that they are being led aimlessly. Becoming worried, Atreyu and Falkor believe that the only way to help Bastian is to remove AURYN from him as they have learned of the memory machine and its effects on him. Bastian overhears them, and through a confrontation with Atreyu believes that he has turned against him. The two then fight, with Atreyu being knocked over a cliff and falling to his death. Returning to Xayide, Bastian discovers the memory machine for himself and learns that he only has two memories - consisting of his mother and father - left. In an attempt to use Artax to follow Falkor, who has taken the fallen Atreyu away, he is nearly killed by an attack from Xayide. Now on foot, Bastian is encountered by Nimbly once more, who has had a change of heart after seeing one of his memories, and guides him to his friends' location before flying off.  Arriving back in Silver City, now in a heavily ruined state, Bastian finds Falkor with Atreyu's lifeless body, and uses his penultimate memory of his mother to wish the latter back to life. Shortly afterwards, Xayide arrives with her giants and tries to force Bastian to use his last wish to return home. Bastain agrees to do so, but wishes for the sorceress "to have a heart" instead. This fills Xayide with emotion, negating the Emptiness within her and which she controls. Overcome with compassion, Xayide explodes in a blast of light, destroying her giants and restoring Fantasia. Having been freed, the Childlike Empress thanks Bastian for his help and shows him the way home: a cliff overlooking a waterfall to help Bastian overcome his fear of heights. Encouraged by Barney and Atreyu, Bastian jumps off and returns home safely. As he reunites with his father, AURYN reappears on the front cover of the Neverending Story's book.

Investigating this homicide and a previous one are new sheriff Carl Carson, and mortician Walt Parker. As the bodycount rises and the killer begins taunting the police, suspicion falls on Charlie Puckett, a disfigured gardener who wears a mask similar to the serial killer's.  Charlie is brought in for questioning, but he refuses to talk, so Carson requests help from Walt, who had served alongside Charlie in the [[Vietnam War]]. Walt gets Charlie to confess, but Carson has doubts about his guilt, so he sets a trap which flushes out the real killer - Walt. Carson explains that he had looked into Walt's history, and discovered that he had dismembered a civilian in Vietnam, though the charges were dropped. When Carson mentions that Charlie was released from custody, Walt panics, and reveals that Charlie is just like him; Charlie helped him kill the Vietnamese girl, and is the one who murdered all of the Pakoe victims after Shannon Davis.  Carson leaves to look for Charlie, while the detained Walt is allowed to call home. Walt's daughter Tanya informs him that Jenny, his stepdaughter, has left to explore the abandoned barn that Charlie was living in. Fearing for Jenny's safety, Walt escapes custody.

As the sisters flee Charlie, they accidentally shoot their father with Carson's gun, though as a last act Walt saves his daughters by setting Charlie on fire.  The next day, Carson and his men scour the lake Charlie that ran into, but the search is called off by the district attorney, who prematurely closes the case, content with stating that Walt was responsible for all of the murders.

Nikita and Marco go on the trip and during their preparation to make love, the phone rings. She thinks it's the room service they just ordered, but it is instructions for her next job. She goes to the bathroom and as she prepares the rifle, Marco is attempting to talk to her through the door. The instructions on who to shoot take longer than expected and she can't answer him. She finally gets the instructions and takes out her target. She is barely able to conceal the rifle before Marco walks in, against her wishes. By then, she is distraught because she has ignored and hurt him due to her job.  Still, her career as an assassin goes well until a document-theft mission in an embassy goes awry.

Upon discovering that she abandoned the Centre, Bob goes to their apartment where he meets with Marco. Bob says she can't be out of danger because she still has the documents, after which Marco hands them over. They agree that they will both miss her.  
Nightbreed
 Aaron Boone dreams of Midian, a city where monsters are accepted. At the request of girlfriend Lori Winston, Boone is seeing [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] Dr. Phillip Decker, who convinces Boone that he committed a series of murders. Decker is actually a masked [[serial killer]] who has murdered several families. Decker drugs Boone with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] disguised as [[lithium]] and orders Boone to turn himself in. Before he can, Boone is struck by a truck and taken to a hospital. There, Boone overhears the rants of Narcisse, a seemingly insane man who seeks to enter Midian. Convinced that Boone is there to test him, Narcisse gives Boone directions to the hidden city before tearing the skin off his face in order to show his "true" face. He is quickly subdued by hospital staff, and Boone leaves.  Boone makes his way to Midian, a city beneath a massive graveyard in the middle of nowhere. He encounters supernatural creatures Kinski and Peloquin. Kinski says that they should bring him below, but Peloquin refuses to allow in a normal human. Boone claims to be a murderer, but Peloquin smells his innocence and attacks him. Boone escapes only to encounter a squad of police officers led by Decker. Boone is gunned down after Decker tries to get him to turn himself in and then yells that Boone has a gun. Due to Peloquin's bite, Boone returns to life in the morgue. When he returns to Midian, he finds Narcisse there and he is inducted into their society by the Nightbreed's leader Dirk Lylesburg. In an initiation ceremony, he is touched by the blood of their deity [[Baphomet]].  Seeking to understand why Boone left her, Lori investigates Midian. She befriends a woman named Sheryl Anne and drives out to the cemetery with her. Leaving Sheryl Anne at the car, Lori explores the cemetery, where she finds a dying creature. A female Nightbreed named Rachel pleads for Lori to take it out of the sunlight. Once in the shadows, it transforms into a little girl who is Rachel's daughter Babette. Lori asks after Boone, but is rebuffed by Lylesburg and scared off by Peloquin. While leaving the cemetery, Lori discovers Sheryl Anne's corpse and her killer Decker. Decker attempts to use Lori to draw Boone out of hiding. Boone rescues Lori and Decker learns that Boone cannot be killed due to his transformation. Decker escapes and Boone takes Lori into Midian. Rachel explains to Lori that the monsters of [[folklore]] were peaceful beings who were hunted to near-extinction by humans. Boone and Lori are banished from Midian by Lylesburg. Decker learns how to kill the Nightbreed and murders the residents of the hotel where Boone and Lori are staying. When Boone discovers the crime scene, he is unable to control his thirst for blood and begins drinking. The police find Boone and take him into custody. At Decker's urging, the police form a militia led by Police Captain Eigerman. A drunken priest named Ashberry joins them as God's servant in their upcoming battle against Midian. Lori, Rachel and Narcisse rescue Boone, and the four return to Midian where Boone convinces the Nightbreed to stand and fight.  During the battle, Ashberry learns that there are women and children among the Nightbreed. When he tries halting the attack, he is beaten by Eigerman. Ashberry finds the idol of Baphomet and swears allegiance to it. When he is splashed by its blood, he is burned and transformed. Boone learns from Lylesburg that Baphomet plans to destroy Midian. Boone argues to release the Berserkers, a monstrous feral breed that were imprisoned due to their insanity. When Lylesburg is killed before he can open the cages, Boone releases them and the Beserkers turn the tide of battle. Decker confronts Boone and is killed. When Boone faces Baphomet, Baphomet says that Boone has caused the end of Midian, which had been foretold. Baphomet charges Boone with finding a new home for the Nightbreed and renames him Cabal.  Boone leaves Midian with Lori and meets with the remaining Nightbreed in a barn where he says his goodbyes to Narcisse and promises to find a place where they will be safe. In the ruins of Midian, Ashberry stands in front of Decker's corpse and states that he wants vengeance on Baphomet and the Breed. When he presses Baphomet's blood to Decker's wound, Decker springs back to life with a scream as Ashberry repeatedly hollers "Hallelujah".  ===Alternative ending=== In the alternative ending used in ''The Cabal Cut'' and ''Director's Cut'' of the film, the Nightbreed await Boone in a barn whilst Boone says his goodbyes to Lori, as he must find a new home for the Nightbreed. Boone promises to return to her, but fearing she will become old whilst Boone will retain his youth and immortality, Lori stabs herself. Boone resurrects Lori as a Nightbreed. Narcisse is killed earlier in the battle by Decker, so he is not present during these events. Meanwhile, Captain Eigerman wanders the underground remains where he stumbles upon the transformed Ashberry, who now desires revenge. Eigerman shares this desire, but Ashberry rejects Eigerman's offer, kills him, and starts his hunt for the Nightbreed. The resurrection of Decker does not occur.  The surviving Nightbreed watch Boone and Lori in the distance. Babette asks Boone's name, and Kinski replies: "His name is Cabal. He unmade Midian". When she asks how soon he will come to take all of them to a new haven, Rachel's answer is: "In the next wind. If not tonight, then tomorrow". Babette repeats: "In the next wind", as the Nightbreed look expectantly at the couple, who are far away in the fields. It is then shown that Boone/Cabal and Lori are now part of their people's prophecy, and they are seen together as one of the paintings on the wall that relates the Nightbreed's history.  
Night of the Living Dead (1990 film)
 Siblings Barbara and Johnnie visit their mother's grave in a remote Pennsylvania cemetery. During their visit, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to her defense, but is killed. Barbara flees the cemetery and discovers what at first seems to be an abandoned farmhouse. She seeks shelter there, only to find another pack of zombies. Shortly after, a man named Ben arrives, and the two clear the house of the dead and begin the process of barricading the doors and windows.  They discover other survivors who have been hiding in the cellar of the house: Harry Cooper, a selfish and argumentative husband; his wife Helen; their daughter Sarah, who was bitten by a zombie and has fallen seriously ill; and teenager lovers Tom Bitner and Judy Rose Larson. The group is divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a "death trap" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that the group should simply leave the house on foot after she notices the zombies' limited mobility. An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement to tend to their ailing daughter, and the remaining members remain upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows. The loud construction attracts even more zombies to the farmhouse, soon collecting a large mob.  The group devises a plan to escape using Ben's truck, which is out of fuel, by refueling at a locked gas pump a few hundred yards away. A search of the corpse who lived in the farmhouse produces an unknown set of keys. Judy Rose, Tom, and Ben proceed up the hill toward the gas pump, but their plan begins to unravel when Ben falls from the bed of the truck and is left to defend himself. To their horror, the key to the gas pump is not among the bunch they brought with them. When Tom shoots the lock off, the gasoline gushing forth is ignited by a burning piece of wood in the truck. The resulting explosion kills both Tom and Judy.  Ben returns to the house to find things beginning to dissolve into chaos. Harry has wrestled Barbara's gun away from her and is now armed. Unknown to the survivors upstairs, the Coopers' daughter Sarah has died from the bite on her arm and has transformed into a zombie; she attacks and bites her distraught mother, who does not defend herself. When Sarah makes her way upstairs, she triggers a shootout between her father, who is trying to protect her, and Ben and Barbara, who are trying to protect themselves. Both Ben and Harry are badly wounded; Barbara shoots Sarah. Harry retreats upstairs to the attic, while Ben makes his way to the cellar, where he shoots a reanimated Helen. Ben gradually goes into shock, and after realizing the gas key has been in the cellar the entire time, he laughs mindlessly at the irony.   Meanwhile, Barbara leaves the house alone and attempts to find help. She eventually joins a group of countryside locals who are clearing the area of the undead, and awakes the next day surrounded by the safety of the media and townspeople. Noticing hillbillies playing around with a few zombies, she comments on the similarities between the living and the undead. She returns to the farmhouse to find Ben, who died of his wounds and has been reanimated; he gazes at Barbara before being shot by one of the posse members. When Harry emerges from the attic alive, Barbara kills him in a fit of rage for causing Ben to die, and turns to leave the house, telling the vigilantes they have "another one for the fire". The film ends as Barbara watches the bodies being burned on a pyre.

The plan to evacuate the wounded Kelso is upset by the arrival of [[Rommel]] on a surprise tour of inspection. But no-one of the party, and only one of the German officers, is aware that ‘Rommel’ is actually Corporal Erich Berger, an actor who is Rommel’s double. Rommel has been drawn into a plot to assassinate Hitler and needs to be temporarily away from Germany.  A small airplane is sitting at the airfield for the weekly mail flight, but the flight cannot be commandeered except by special authority. Harry unmasks ‘Rommel’ as Berger and gets him to give that authority.

Mackey is allowed to forego a ten-day suspension and to continue to work on the case if he agrees to supervise Dr. Powers. At the scene of the next murder Dr. Powers writhes on the floor in the tape outline of the victim and announces that the victim was raped. That night in bed Dr. Powers relives a murder she survived as a child.

No Retreat, No Surrender 3: Blood Brothers
  Washington D.C. A bank has been held hostage by terrorists with police surrounding the building. As the lead terrorist, looks over at the hostages, a crippled hostage begins to beg for his life. When the crippled hostage is kicked down, it turns out to be a trick as the hostage's crutches are a projectile and a blade. The "hostage" is revealed to be CIA agent Casey Alexander, who in the process of saving the hostages, was shot in the arm, but is successful. We soon meet Casey's brother Will, who is a martial arts teacher who does a demonstration of using skills in real-life situations. When Will's father John calls him, Will asks what time the party starts and John asks if Will is willing to spend the weekend with him and his father. Will is reluctant, but accepts the offer.  Meanwhile, John, a retired CIA agent, looks up information on a man when he is approached by two men. He manages to tie one up and points his gun at the other. The other man is actually CIA agent Macpherson, John's longtime friend who pays him back for a bet on football. When Macpherson and John speak in his office, Macpherson reveals that John is on the hit list and the man happens to be the face on his computer screen. When John refuses protection, Macpherson accepts and tells John he will see him at the party.  The party is to celebrate John's 65th birthday. Alongside Macpherson is CIA director Jack Atteron, who jokingly makes a bet who will get to sit next to the secretary for cake. Casey arrives with cast in arm from the shooting and talks briefly about the last mission. When Will shows up, he is wearing the Soviet flag on the back of his jean jacket. As Casey tries to show affection towards his brother, Will resists it. Things get worse when Casey tells his father that Will and him got him an around the world flight for his birthday. An angry Will leaves and when Casey follows him to talk to him, Will finally lets his anger out. He is mad that Casey won't admit that he is a spy and to stop acting like a hotshot with all his cash. Casey tells Will that he doesn't like the fact he's wearing "Khrushchev's jacket" in front of the CIA. Will drives off and John promises he will talk to Will. Casey leaves as well to take a friend home.  That night, John hears the door and hopes it is Will. However, when he doesn't get a reply, he is suspicious. He soon becomes attacked by some men dressed in black. John fights them off, even killing one in the process. However, when he opens a door, he is kicked down and two men are revealed. The face John saw earlier on his computer screen is Colombian terrorist Antonio "Franco" Franconi, who wants to get revenge on John for the death of his son in a mission years ago. Alongside Franco is his number one man, Russo, an agile martial artist. When Russo proves to be too powerful, John sees a gun. Franco challenges him to take it. When John reaches for the gun, Franco throws a dart, hitting John in the throat. Russo follows it up with a spinning back kick, sending John into the indoor pool, dead. When Will and Casey discover their father's body, Will has had enough of Casey, who vows to find out who is responsible.  When Atteron refuses to give Casey his father's case, he seeks the means to find out himself by going through an old friend who works in the IT department. Casey learns that Franco is planning something major in Florida. As he heads home, he is confronted by another group of terrorists. Will, who happens to be there, helps Casey fend off the terrorists, but Casey shoots them all down. Casey tells Will to go to his apartment and gives him the file he received at the office on their father. While Casey talks with the police, Will opens the file and learns where Franco is. He decides to head to Florida to find Franco himself. When Casey discovers Will's plan, he heads to Florida as well, pretending to be on vacation.  Will meets up with some old friends at a martial arts school in Tampa and asks for their help in finding Angel, a recruiter for Franco's organization. Meanwhile, Casey, who tries to look for Will, begins to have a hunch that Will may actually find his way into the organization and goes to look for old girlfriend Maria, who is also infiltrating Franco. At a bar that night, Will arrives as does his friends, who challenge and beat up Angel's men. As Angel is about to be beaten down, Will faces off against his friends as part of the plan. Will calls himself "Jessie Roby" and Angel takes him to see Franco. When Franco meets "Jessie", he tests him by saying that Jessie is a spy for the government. Will, as Jessie, faces off against one thug but matches skills with Russo and passes the test. Will is given a major assignment the next day.  Will and two men go to a house where it is revealed that he must kill Casey. However, Will tells Casey that he has met Franco and that they have to make the fight look real. Will tells Casey something major is planned and he will let him know once he gets the word. Will "kills" Casey, who fakes strangulation by curtain. Upon returning to the base, Franco's supervisor wants to meet the man who killed Casey. When Will meets the supervisor, it is revealed to be Atteron, who was also responsible for his father's death. Casey soon finds himself kidnapped and the two are tied up and confronted by Russo and Franco. When Will sees Casey being beaten horrendously, he tells Franco he will not do the job if Casey is dead, prompting him to stop the beating.  The plot is to kidnap the Mozambique Ambassador, who will be arriving at Tampa International Airport, and give a set of demands. However, it is a distraction for the real plan, the assassination of President [[George H.W. Bush]]. Will is being hired because of his impeccable martial arts skills. While Will plans the attack at the airport, Casey and a now kidnapped Maria, make their escape from Franco's men and head toward the airport. Casey catches up to Will and the Ambassador, whom they put on a plane with the engine on so they can find Franco and Russo, the latter armed with a rocket launcher aimed at [[Air Force One]]. The brothers find them and begin a showdown with them. Maria, who had seen Will as "Jessie", shoots Will in the shoulder and goes after him, only to be stopped by Casey. The two jump on the back of the truck where Franco and Russo are driving and then eventually stop at an airplane hangar.  At the airplane hangar, Casey tells Will they are going on a different sort of hunting trip. As the two search, Will is caught and is getting hit when Casey catches up. Casey takes on Franco and Will takes on Russo. The two duos fight it out when Russo heads on top of a scaffold with Will trailing him. On the scaffold, Will is able to outfight Russo and gives him a roundhouse kick to his face, causing Russo to fall to his death. Franco, who is revealed to be an agile fighter himself, jumps on the scaffold and knocks Will to the ground. Will is rescued by Casey when he lands on the ground, prompting Will to land on his back. Soon, Franco is taking on both Casey and Will. When Franco throws his dart, Will is hit in the shoulder. However, when Franco goes to throw another dart, Casey moves in the way and the dart deflects off his cast, which enables Will to kick it towards Franco, hitting him in the chest. As the brothers are about to go after Franco, they are stopped by Atteron, who shoots Franco in the face, killing him. Atteron admits he has planned to kill Franco after he had killed both Casey and Will. Both Will and Casey are upset by this as Atteron plans to kill them now to cover his tracks. A gunshot is heard, only to find that Atteron has been shot by Maria, who once again goes after "Jessie", until Casey reveals that Will is his brother. Maria is shocked but happy with the outcome. Casey goes as far as offering Will a job with the CIA, but Will laughs it off. As they open the airplane hangar, Macpherson, the CIA, and the Tampa police are all there with an arrested Angel. The brothers and Maria happily walk off towards a relieved Macpherson.

The Nutcracker Prince
 In 1850 in Germany Clara's family are celebrating on Christmas Eve. Clara is jealous because her older sister, Louise, has a boyfriend, leaving her feeling sad and wondering about growing up. She immediately cheers up when the eccentric Uncle Drosselmeier arrives at their home with special gifts: a fully automated toy castle for everyone, and a Nutcracker for Clara.  Upon giving her the Nutcracker, Clara's little brother, Fritz, breaks it while playing with his toy soldiers. Clara is heartbroken, but Drosselmeier promises to fix it for her. To cheer Clara up, Drosselmeier tells her a story about how the Nutcracker came to be the Prince of the Dolls.  ===The Story of the Hard Nut=== Once upon a time there were a King and a Queen who had a beautiful, but vain and normal daughter named Pirlipat. To celebrate the King's birthday, the Queen made a special cake out of [[blue cheese]], the King's favorite. However, the scent of the cheese drew out all the mice, who ate and destroyed the cake. The King was enraged and commanded his inventor, Elias Christian Drosselmeier, to capture all the mice. Drosselmeier and his nephew, Hans, were successful in capturing all the mice, except the Mouse Queen and her only son.  In revenge, the Mouse Queen casts a spell on Pirlipat, causing her to become unusually ugly and weird. Drosselmeier was once again given the task of figuring out how to cure her. He eventually learned that the fabled Krakatooth Nut can cure her, on the condition that it is cracked open in the teeth of a young man who has never worn boots. The King commanded all the princes and noblemen to apply, with the promise of marrying Pirlipat once she is cured.  However, the Krakatooth is so hard that all the men's teeth shatter upon trying to crack it. Drosselmeier is about to be beheaded for being unable to cure Pirlipat when Hans steps in. He manages to crack the nut open between his teeth and gives it to Pirlipat, breaking the spell. Then the angered Mouse Queen casts a spell on Hans, turning him into the Prince of the Dolls (in other words, a Nutcracker). During the ruckus, she is killed by a falling statue, and her son's tail is caught and bent. He survives and declares himself the Mouse King.  Drosselmeier is exiled from the kingdom for trying to pass a "Nutcracker as a son-in-law", while the King and Queen celebrate with their now-cured daughter. As Drosselmeier holds the Nutcracker that Hans has become, the Mouse King vows revenge upon Hans for ruining his tail ("And if you think your beloved nephew Hans is ugly ''now'', ha!  Wait 'till I turn him into a pile of splinters!").  ===Revenge of the Mouse King=== Clara is upset by the story for its unhappy ending, but is consoled when Drosselmeier tells her that the spell can be broken if he defeats the Mouse King and wins the hand of a fair maiden. That night, when everyone has gone to sleep, Clara ventures into the sitting room to dance with her Nutcracker and introduces him to her dolls, Trudy, Marie and Pantaloon, an old general in Fritz's toy soldier army.  Suddenly the Mouse King and his army of mice arrive, intent on getting his revenge on the Nutcracker for his injured tail and humiliation. Drosselmeier appears on the grandfather clock and brings the Nutcracker and all the dolls and soldiers in the room to life. The Nutcracker, who has no memories following being transformed, battles the Mouse King, while the soldiers fight the mice. Clara saves the Nutcracker from the Mouse King by throwing her slipper at him.  The first battle comes to a halt, though, when she slips on a cannonball and crashes into the clock, losing consciousness for the rest of the night. The next morning, she awakens in her own bed and tries to tell her mother about the battle, only to be told to rest. Drosselmeier visits with the repaired yet now lifeless Nutcracker, giving only vague answers to Clara's questions about the previous night.  The next night, the Mouse King returns, angry about Clara's interference from before. Before he can go after the Nutcracker once more, Clara tricks him, briefly trapping him within her drawer in her bedside table in her room. However, when she retrieves the unawakened toy, the Mouse King has escaped and threatens to harm her kitten, Pavlova, if she doesn't hand the Nutcracker over. Suddenly, Drosselmeier reappears, and the toys awaken once more.  The Nutcracker tells Clara not to worry, but then is cut by the mouse king. This leads into a fearsome fight under the Christmas tree. The Mouse King is supposedly defeated when he is stabbed in the chest and falls off the tree to his death. The leaderless army of mice runs away amid the cheering toys. When everyone sees that Pantaloon has been injured in the fight, they have to return to the Land of the Dolls to revive him.  Clara is then shrunken down to doll size thanks to Drosselmeier's magic (who also gives a cryptic warning of time), and they enter the Land of the Dolls through the toy castle. As they leave, Pavlova goes to inspect the Mouse King's body; but is frightened away when the Mouse King suddenly opens his eyes.  ===Land of the Dolls=== The Nutcracker, Clara, Pantaloon, Trudy and Marie arrive at the Land of Dolls on flying swans, passing forests of Christmas trees and arriving at a palace made of sweets. Once they are there, Pantaloon is cured. The Nutcracker is given a royal welcome as the Prince of the Dolls amid many cheering toys. Clara shares a romantic dance with the Nutcracker, who takes her by the hand and gets down on one knee. He then asks her to stay with him and be his princess.  Clara is ready to embrace her childhood fantasies and her beloved companion, but is conflicted due to her desire to not abandon her family whom she loves and is thus unable to give a true answer. Drosselmeier's warning of the time proves true when the dolls start to turn back into inanimate toys, and the severely wounded Mouse King suddenly arrives for one last chance at revenge while mentally unstable due to his agony. The Nutcracker tries to save Clara, but slowly turns back into a toy himself. Clara tries to keep the Mouse King at bay, but he corners her on a balcony, his mental state continuing to decay.  As the King strikes, he plummets into the darkness and vanishes, almost taking Clara with him. Clara pulls herself back up and finds the castle is completely empty. She begins sobbing for the Nutcracker as mist fills the lonely palace.  ===Home Again=== Clara wakes up to find herself back home. There is no sign of the events that she has experienced, except her brother's statement that Pavlova discovered a large dead mouse near the toy castle. Clara rushes downstairs to find the Nutcracker missing. She runs to Uncle Drosselmeier's workshop where he seems to be expecting her. She begs him to tell her whether the fairytale he told her was true or false.  Clara is suddenly silenced when a young boy enters the room, carrying a big clock. Drosselmeier introduces the boy as his nephew Hans, whom Clara recognizes as her beloved Nutcracker in his human form. The film ends with Hans and Clara addressing each other. "Hello, Clara." Hans says, and then she replies with a smile, "Hello, Nutcracker".  
Omega Cop
 In the year 1999 the world is in the midst of an environmental holocaust, the result of a series of solar flares which have scorched the Earth for the last 30 years. Exposure to the flares results in a radiation poisoning which causes the affected to degenerate into psychotic killers. The vast majority of the world's population is dead, the world is desolate and arid, and in the [[United States of America|United States]] the government and military now only control [[New York City]] and [[Washington DC]]. Otherwise, what is left of humanity is divided between militarised encampments protecting pockets of the unaffected survivors, and roving groups of slavers and scavengers. Unradiated water, gasoline and women have become precious resources which the surviving groups hoard jealously and are willing to kill to obtain.  John Travis ([[Ron Marchini]]), is the leader of a security patrol for one of the compounds led by Prescott ([[Adam West]]) when he and his squad are sent to investigate reports of a slaver auction of female captives. Suspecting that notorious bandit leader Wraith is there, he is ordered to break up the auction and kill Wraith if possible. The raid goes badly, however, as the group are forced to open fire, resulting in the deaths of all of Travis' comrades along with several dozen slavers and scavengers. Calling for backup, Travis is told that due to solar flare activity he is not only alone but he cannot be allowed back into the safety of his home compound. Wraith, learning of the identity of his attacker, conducts a ritual sacrifice of a woman and swears before his men that the next sacrifice will be of Travis.  Abandoned in a small urban area, Travis ends up freeing three women, who he takes back to an abandoned local [[baseball]] stadium which he apparently uses as a part-time hide-out. Realising that the third of the women is sick and needs medical attention, he takes the group to a clinic run by a friend, Dr. Latimer ([[Stuart Whitman]]). While there, he is led into a trap by a boy working for Wraith who steals weapons from his car. Although he escapes, the three women flee the clinic when the doctor reveals that he has been infected by the most recent flare. When Travis returns he finds the clinic abandoned save for Dr. Latimer, who he is forced to shoot.  Reuniting with the three women at the baseball field, Travis makes the decision to return back to the compound and demand medical aid from his erstwhile employers. Upon return he finds that Wraith's men already have the bunker under siege, and any chance of saving those inside has passed. Despite making an attempt at buying some time for the survivors inside, Prescott reports that Wraith's men have breached the bunker, ransacked its armory and are overrunning it, killing everyone inside. Left with no other option, Prescott tells Travis that his one chance to kill Wraith is to use the store's explosives to detonate the bunker, killing everyone inside. Travis reluctantly agrees, and aided by his female companions he clears the exterior of the compound, liberates the explosives and levels the facility. From there, he and his companions cross the country to live around the untainted mountain lakes of [[Montana]].  
Nouvelle Vague (film)
 La Contessa Elena Torlato-Favrini (her last name taken from ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'') is a wealthy Italian industrialist living in a sprawling estate near Lake Geneva, Switzerland. She is attended by Jules the Gardener, his wife Yvonne, their daughter Cécile, the chauffeur Laurent, and the mysterious Della La Rue (or "Della Street," a reference to [[Erle Stanley Gardner]]'s [[Perry Mason]] stories). At the film's opening, Elena goes for a drive by herself and encounters Roger Lennox (his last name taken from ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]''), an apparent drifter. Elena's trajectory is brought to an abrupt halt as she stops to help Roger, who has evidently been forced off the road by a truck (or is it the nearby tree?) and is severely incapacitated. Roger offers Elena his hand, and Elena accepts his offer (the "miracle of empty hands," borrowed from ''[[Diary of a Country Priest]]''). The series of exchanges constituting their relationship begins.  The narrative continues with Roger now Elena's [[kept man]]. He dotes on her and is obedient to her retinue that includes Elena's lawyer Raoul Dorfman, Raoul's girlfriend, the Doctor (one of Elena's shareholders), and the Doctor's wife Dorothy Parker, a writer like her [[Dorothy_Parker|namesake]]. After a series of episodes in which both members of the couple express dissatisfaction with the other, and together ruminate on regret, Elena decides to take a boat across the lake to visit some friends. Roger obediently rows the boat, and stops when Elena wants to get in the water, but refuses to join her, citing inability to swim. In a mishap evocative of their first meeting, Roger falls into the water as Elena gets back into the boat. This time, Elena does not help, appearing indifferent to or even unaware of Roger's plight.  The servants and Raoul quickly attempt to cover up any existence of Roger but almost immediately there is a new crisis: a man identical to Roger, calling himself Richard Lennox and claiming to be Roger's brother, appears. He claims to know about the boating incident and is apparently using that as leverage to take over one of Elena's companies. Where before the figure of Lennox was passive and docile, he is now shrewd and aggressive; it is Elena that now becomes pliant.  The power struggle reaches a climax in a recapitulation of the boating scene. This time, it is Lennox that decides to take the boat out, and it is Elena that falls into the water, apparently unable to swim. Richard, at first as indifferent to Elena as she was to Roger Lennox in the same situation, abruptly takes Elena's hand and saves her. In the end, an equilibrium is reached. Elena realizes that Richard Lennox is the same man as Roger Lennox ("the same, but different"). Richard has taken on a controlling role in Elena's affairs but Elena remains in charge. With renewed vigor, Elena warmly bids ''arrivederci'' to her servants (Richard having earlier arranged to sell the estate for a large sum of money), and Elena and Richard in turn drive away, apparently off to have more adventures as equals.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Speaking-about-Godard-Kaja-Silverman/dp/0814780660</ref>

After the men have left, Hayes calmly tells Ann, "The worst is over".   The scene shifts to [[San Francisco]], where an unmarried couple, Drake Goodman (Modine) and Patty Palmer (Griffith), purchase an expensive 19th-century [[polychrome]] house in the exclusive [[Pacific Heights]] neighborhood. They rent one of the building's two first-floor apartments to the Watanabes, a kindly Japanese couple. Soon after, Hayes visits to view the remaining vacant unit and immediately expresses a desire to move in. Hayes drives an expensive Porsche and carries large amounts of cash on his person, but is reluctant to undergo a credit check. He convinces Drake to waive the credit check in exchange for a list of references and an upfront payment of the first six months' rent, to be paid by [[wire transfer]].  Before any of this money is paid, however, Hayes arrives unannounced one morning and shuts himself into the apartment. As the days pass, Hayes' promised wire transfer fails to materialize. From inside the apartment, sounds of loud hammering and drilling are heard at all hours of the day and night, however the door is seldom answered. When Drake finally makes an attempt to enter Hayes' apartment, he finds that the locks have been changed. Drake attempts to put an end to the constant noise and drive out Hayes by cutting the electricity and heat to the apartment, but Hayes summons the police, who side with Hayes and reprimand Drake.  Drake and Patty hire a lawyer, Stephanie MacDonald ([[Laurie Metcalf]]), however the eviction case is thwarted by Drake's actions. Hayes, safe from eviction for the time being, infests the house with [[cockroaches]], which prompts the Watanabes to move out and pushes Drake and Patty further into debt. The heavy stress takes its toll on the couple; Drake drinks heavily and Patty suffers a [[miscarriage]]. Hayes visits the couple to offer his condolences, but an infuriated Drake attacks him and is arrested by the police, whom Hayes had already called to the scene in anticipation of an assault.  The assault allows Hayes to file a civil lawsuit against Drake and, unbeknownst to the couple, assume control of Drake's possessions and identity. Hayes also files a [[restraining order]], which forces Drake from the building. Once Drake is gone, Hayes begins stalking and harassing Patty, in an apparent ploy to lure Drake back to the building in violation of the restraining order. The ploy succeeds, as Drake becomes concerned and comes to check on Patty. Hayes confronts Drake and shoots him, then plants a crowbar at the scene to prevent any criminal charges.  While Drake is in the hospital, the eviction is finally handed down and authorities force entry into Hayes' apartment. By this time however, Hayes has disappeared, and the apartment has been destroyed and stripped bare of all its appliances, light fixtures, wood paneling, and even the toilet. Later, while cleaning out the destroyed apartment, Patty finds an important clue: an old photograph of Hayes as a young boy. Written on the back is the name "James Danforth", which Patty deduces is Hayes' real name. She phones Bennett Fidlow ([[Jerry Hardin]]), the Texas attorney whom Danforth had provided as a reference (albeit under his Hayes alias). Fidlow confides to her that Danforth has a long history of wrongdoing and has been [[disowned]] by his family.  Patty travels to Danforth's last-known address, a condominium in [[Desert Spring, California|Desert Spring]]. There she finds Ann, his girlfriend and previous co-conspirator who had earlier come looking for him in San Francisco. Ann tells Patty that Carter Hayes is the name of the property's former landlord, and that Danforth assumed Hayes' identity and took possession of the condominium after (the genuine) Hayes hired two thugs to carry out the assault shown in the film's opening scene. Ann also shows Patty a postcard from Danforth, written on the letterhead of a hotel in [[Century City]], which had just arrived the day before.  Patty tracks down Danforth at the hotel, where he has checked in under Drake's name. Patty bluffs her way into his suite by posing as his wife, and while rummaging through his personal effects she discovers he is using legal and financial documents in Drake's name. She calls Drake and tells him to cancel all of his credit cards and freeze the couple's joint bank account. She then places an exorbitant order for room service, which leads to Danforth being arrested.  Danforth is bailed out of prison by a wealthy widow, Florence Peters (played by Tippi Hedren), whom he was apparently vetting to be his next victim. Once out on bail, Danforth returns to San Francisco to seek revenge against Patty and Drake. Upstairs, he bludgeons Drake with a golf club, then attacks Patty in the downstairs apartment where she is busy making repairs. A struggle ensues, and a badly-wounded Drake makes his way into the crawl space between the basement and the first-floor apartment. He reaches through a hole in the floor and grabs Danforth by the ankle; Danforth loses his balance and is killed when he falls backward and is impaled by a water supply line.  Some time later, Patty and Drake have put their newly repaired building up for sale and show the property to another couple. The story ends with the couple having a private discussion about making an offer of $850,000, which is $100,000 more than what Drake and Patty had originally paid for it.

Soon, both Christine and Harris begin an affair which complicates things. When a patient, who is also  the wife of the chief medic, under Harris' care dies from his negligence, he is brought up on charges. But at his hearing, Christine takes the blame for the incident which gets her suspended from the hospital.  Things take another turn when one day, Alec Moran, one of the few friends that Harris had during his days while working as a porter in London, runs into him, and Harris goes to desperate measures to protect his charade. When Harris takes Moran to a remote area and confides in him about his scam of impersonating a doctor, Moran takes it very badly and threatens to report Harris to the hospital authorities. Harris follows Moran and pushes him off a cliff, thus resorting to murder to keep his job. However, Moran survives the fall critically injured, but long enough to be brought into the hospital for treatment. When trying to identify Moran, a nurse finds the silver cigarette case which has Mathew Harris engraved in side and assumes that he is he. Harris tries again to kill Moran in A&E, and succeeds by injecting a blood bag for Moran's emergency surgery with 20% potassium chloride.  When Christine finally figures out Harris' charade after seeing the real Dr. Simon Hennessey's gravestone in London while visiting her recently deceased father's grave in the same cemetery, she confronts him. Harris charms Christine into helping him so they can get married and live a good life together. Since neither he or Moran have any family, Harris manipulates Christine by making her claim that Alec Moran is the real Matthew Harris, so he can be legally declared dead and he can continue his impersonation of Dr. Hennessey. Christine does so, and Harris is again free and clear.  Due to growing negative views of him, Harris decides to transfer to another hospital in nearby Salisbury. He has however also agreed to stop pretending to be a doctor and move to London with Christine. On setting off by car rather than continue to London where Christine is waiting, he takes the turn to Salisbury leaving Christine waiting all night in front of the meal she had prepared for them both. As the now-amoral and murderous Harris settles into his new job at another A&E at another hospital to continue his impersonation of a professional doctor, the abandoned Christine must decide for herself if she will remain silent forever, or risk prosecution and imprisonment for her involvement in Harris' charade by reporting him to the authorities.

Passport (1990 film)
 Half-brothers Yasha (Yakov) and Merab Papashvili live in Tbilisi. Yasha is a musician, and Merab works as a taxi driver. In 1987, Yasha (being half-Jewish on his mother's side) decides to repatriate to Israel with his family. Merab, being quite happy with his own lifestyle of a careless playboy and not thinking of emigration, accompanies them to Moscow and then to the Sheremetyevo airport.  The brothers want to drink champagne together one last time, but the local cafe would not serve any and sends them to the duty-free shop instead. Not quite realizing the possible consequences, easy-going Merab grabs his brother's travel document and crosses the border checkpoint, pretending to be him. He buys champagne in the duty-free, but then realizes that he can't walk back quite as easily. He runs frantically around the airport, and due to a series of misunderstandings ends up being escorted to board a plane (meant for Yasha) which immediately takes off.  While onboard, Merab befriends the charming adventurer Borya, who is dressed as a stereotypical Russian peasant and sports a [[balalaika]]. The plane lands in [[Vienna]] (a common practice at the time, due to the lack of direct flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv). As soon as they leave the airport, Borya breaks his balalaika apart to reveal a large stash of US dollars hidden inside (which at the time was illegal to ''own'' in the Soviet Union, let alone earn). He proceeds to buy himself a stylish outfit in the nearest supermarket and casually offers Merab a job. When the latter refuses, Borya gives him a taxi ride to the Soviet embassy and leaves, cheerfully anticipating to continue his spending spree.  Merab tries unsuccessfully to get help from the embassy, but is told that the ambassador is off till Monday, and even then his case can't be resolved quickly. When Merab tries to press the issue, he is promptly apprehended by the Austrian police, taken mugshot of, and handed over to [[Sokhnut]]. There he again meets Borya, who had already managed to lose all his money in a casino. Undaunted, he contemplates the new business opportunities. Both decide to let Sokhnut fly them to Israel.  Once in Israel, Merab again pretends to be Yasha to get through the immigration procedures. His new plan is to borrow some money from the local relatives, then return to USSR on a tourist visa and switch places with the real Yasha. He is received by Uncle Izya (Isaac) and his wife. After hearing his improbable story, Izya thinks he is a KGB spy and throws him out of the house at gunpoint.  After spending a night in an abandoned boat on the beach, Merab visits the local market and encounters a casual acquaintance from Tbilisi, a former policeman, who brings him to a lavish party attended by another acquaintance of both, wealthy and influential Tengiz. At first Tengiz seems sympathetic, but Izya, who happened to be among the guests too, denounces Merab as a KGB agent. Merab is beaten and thrown out.  After spending another night on the beach, Merab tries to contact the Soviet mission, but they wouldn't believe his story and suspect him of being an agent provocateur of some kind. Enraged, Merab follows the official to the parking and handcuffs himself to his car (he borrowed a pair of handcuffs from another protester a little earlier). However, this turns out to be a wrong car, and the official departs. Having no keys to the handcuffs, Merab unhinges the car door and carries it around for a while, before being able to break free.  Merab is approached by an American journalist Jane and confides his story to her. She introduces him to old Senya (Semyon), a World War II veteran who works in a huge industrial freezing facility and seems to be involved in some shady business. He proposes a plan to sneak Merab secretly through the borders back to the USSR, and they depart on a fridge truck. On the way, both drink and sing Russian songs. Senya grows increasingly paranoid and incapacitates several innocent bystanders who seem suspicious to him. The truck is stopped by the police, while Merab is driving. Senya pretends to be asleep and not knowing Merab at all. Merab tries to run, is shot in the leg, arrested, taken mugshot of (this becomes a sort of a running gag in the movie), and thrown in prison. There he quickly changes several cells, being beaten by both Muslims and Jews after his unsuccessful attempts to blend in.  Soon thereafter, Merab is bailed out of prison by Tengiz, who was alerted by Senya and after checking with mutual acquaintances in Tbilisi realized that Merab is in fact not a spy. They drive through the desert, when Senya confronts them on his fridge truck and stubbornly insists on his original plan. When Tengiz protests, Senya incapacitates him, then also Merab, and forcibly brings the latter to the border. Resigned to his fate, Merab bluntly obeys. Suddenly turned somber and mournful, Senya gives Merab his wedding ring and asks to put it on his wife's grave back in the USSR. (A flash-forward sequence during the opening credits, unexplained until now, reveals that in due time Merab made good on this promise). Senya walks Merab through the minefield, gives him directions and contacts, walks back and blows up on a landmine in what was possibly a deliberate suicide. Devastated, Merab remains on the site until captured by Jordanian border patrol. He is apprehended, taken mugshot of, and imprisoned as an Israeli spy.  Three years later Merab is released from the prison. Using Senya's contacts, he crosses to Turkey and travels to the border with USSR. His original travel document is probably lost or expired, and in any case not meant for reentry, so he has no legal way of entering. Left without other options, he wades across the border river, waist-deep, with arms outstretched, begging the unseen border guards not to shoot.  The film ends with yet another mugshot.

Perumthachan (film)
 In this Indian story, based on a Kerala legend, a pious and self-disciplined master carpenter of a supposedly mixed-caste background,  moves easily in his world, building temples and then carving the stone statues which embellish them. He is at home in his traditional world, is at peace with his inner self and the social mores of the time. By way of contrast, he begets a son who is of rebellious nature and questioning of the traditional social hierarchies of the time. He falls in love with  the daughter of a royal household which ultimately leads to his demise.<ref></ref>  Raman Perumthachan ([[Thilakan]]) is unsurpassed as a wood-carver, sculptor and architect and his creations were so exquisite that he was regarded a reincarnation of the architect of the gods.He was also a man of great erudition. Though brought up  as a carpenter, he was alluded to be the son of a Brahmin. Perumthachan himself doubted this supposition and in one part of the film he smiles approvingly when his son suggests to him that perhaps the made up story about his Brahmanical antecedents was a ruse by the uppercastes to lay claim to some of  his ability and prestige.  The screenplay begins at dusk with an old ambalavasi trying to light a stone lamp. But due to a strong gust of wind the lamp struggles to remain alight. A man lying in the tanner pandal close by gets up and places a stone slab strategically in such a way  that the path of the wind is breached. He wears a sacred thread(poonool) and hence is mistaken for a Namboodiri. But he tells the ambalavasi that he is no Namboodiri, but an Asari(carpenter) who had forgotten to remove his thread which he had worn during the construction of a temple. Immediately the ambalavasi recognises that this was no ordinary carpenter but the legendary Perumthachan himself. News spreads about the arrival of Perumthachan .  He meets up with a rich Brahmin who was his childhood friend and who is now the Thampuran of a rich royal household(Kovilakam). He is requested to oversee the construction of the family's shrine and the sculpting of the image of the goddess . The ravishing beauty of the Brahmin householder's wife Bhargavi Thampuratti([[Vinaya Prasad]])catches his imagination and he sculpts the face of the goddess in the mould of the Thampuratti. Though a man of principles, Perumthachan feels drawn to the woman whose looks he compares to 'Swayamvara Durga'; but steps back, knowing well the consequences of any indiscretion on his part. This apparent attraction leads to a minor misunderstanding towards  Perumtachan in the mind of the Thampuran and consequently he is not allowed to complete the work on the idol  to his satisfaction and is insulted by the Thampuran during the consecration of the idol.Perunthachan leaves the place disillusioned.  Years roll on and his son Kannan([[Prashanth (actor)|Prasanth]])has grown into an insightful young man of great charms and talent. Perumthachan is  proud of his son's abilities and pleased by his son's growing reputation, but is also worried by his son's tendency to overlook the traditional rules and values of sculptural art  and by the strain of unscrupulousness in the son which is a mark of the new, more materialistic and self- centred generation. It is Perumthachan's long cherished wish that he be the one who  builds the Saraswati mandapam which Bhargavi Thamburatti had desired for.  Kunhikkavu Thamburatti([[Monisha Unni]]), the daughter agrees to her late mother's wish, but it is Kannan, not Perumthachan, who is called up to do the work. The young man goes to the very household of the same rich Brahmin for whom his father had carved the image of the goddess years ago and  designs and supervises the building of the temple. In an ironical repetition of his father's experience, he falls in love with Kunhikkavu. But unlike his father, he does not hold himself back and a scandal erupts in the royal household . Seeing that the scandal is slowly destroying his old patron, the father of the girl, Perumthachan arrives to oversee the construction of the temple. He tries to cajole his son to walk away from his relationship. The son refuses to yield and the distraught Perunthachan, in a final act of desperation, drops his chisel deliberately on his son's neck, killing him during the work of the final touches to the dome of the temple.<ref>http://www.cinemaofmalayalam.net/ajayan.html</ref>

But in trying to arrest the stranger, the officer is thrown over five feet, with one punch by the stranger, into the cruiser's windshield while being handcuffed which alerts the other officer who arrives to help and fires his weapon only to see the Stranger fall and, immediately, rise and run away. During the pursuit, the stranger hurdles over and clears a high wooden fence and runs into a heavy wooden door only to be momentarily stopped. Upon which he runs into and breaks down the door with his body.  Running to elude the police, he rushes into an apartment that is occupied by several people. When they pull out knives to defend themselves, the stranger attacks them, throwing the woman through the apartment door when the police officers arrive. The officer stare inside as they watch the stranger make short work of the two men. One, he sends through the apartment wall. When the officers fires on him he crashes through the apartment window and falls to the ground.  When the officers go down to see the body, They're startled to see the stranger quickly rise up screaming and they fire their guns, apparently, killing him. It's then when one officer asks to check under the Stranger's jacket to see if the stranger had large, "S" under it remarking, "I think we just killed 'Clark Kent.'"  Later, the stranger's body is taken to the medical examiner. At the same time, a man, (Robert Forster), monitoring the police, hears of the spacecraft crashing and a possible suspect killed and sent to the Morgue, and rushes out of his seedy apartment with a .44 Magnum revolver in hand.  The Stranger's body is about to be examined by Asst. Medical Examiner Dori Caisson, (Hilary Shepard), when she sees that the bullet holes on his body start to glow and his skin miraculously heal. Still staring, she's horrified to see the stranger rise from the autopsy table and seize her. As they leave,they're stopped by the security guard, Moses, (Wally Taylor), who is attacked by the stranger and is rendered unconscious. The stranger forces Dori out to the roof parking lot and into her car. It's then that the man from the apartment rushes up and aims his gun at the stranger who yells out the man's name (which sounds like "Yates", which is the man's name in the Alien's language). With Yates firing his gun at him, the stranger, who's at the steering wheel, drives forward, and abruptly starts into reverse, at high speed, toward Yates knocking him over the side of the building where he lands into a tree, severely injured. Yates runs off where he brakes into a closed library and he begins to heal in the same manner as the stranger.  At the Examiner's Office the guard is questioned by Detective Sergeant Frank Ramos, (Robert Davi),  with the Chief Medical Examiner, "Doc", (Bert Remsen)  present. He explains that Dori was kidnapped by one of the "corpses" who attacked him and fled with her. Ramos does not believe Moses, but Doc tells him that the body of the stranger, who was killed by the police officers, is missing.  Dori and the stranger end up at her home where he forces her into a chair and turns on her TV and radio to listening to all the programs. When Dori attempts to call the Police, thinking the Stranger distracted, he catches her and ties her up with the telephone cord and later they fall asleep. the next day Dori awakes to find the stranger wearing her late husband clothes. When she ask why he's wearing them she was surprised to find the stranger say "Forgive me, I was cold."  Saying that she did not believe that he understood her, he remarked that he could not until he had listened to all the TV programs. Dori remarked that he was not from around here to which he said "No. I'm from another planet". Still shocked after thinking he was dead, the stranger wondered why Dori thought he was dead because he had not begun to decompose. Dori stated that his injuries where fatal to humans. The stranger explained that his kind regenerate their major organs and die only after they suffer massive damage to their brain. When the stranger inquired as to humans, Dori wryly says, "No, we just go to work for the Department of Motor Vehicles". Baffled by the joke because his kind do not joke nor understand them, Dori tricks the stranger and escapes only to be caught at her car with her behind the steering wheel. Attempting to flee, she threaten to run him over. The stranger stops her by putting his foot on her car's bumper as she tries running him down.  Dori pleaded with him to let her go. The Stranger stated that he needed her to get his clothing for his crashed ship to lift off because the control card was in them and that he must return to his world because he is a "Peacemaker". "A policeman". Surprised and upset, Dori asked his name. He said "Townsend". Looking a little disappointed Dori said, "I thought your name would be Darth Vader or something".  Meanwhile, Yates is caught by the police, that day, in the Library and handcuffed. He then shears off his hand that was cuffed and escapes. Going to a phone booth, Yates finds Dori's address. Dori and Townsend, finding that the police was looking for them and that they could not get to the control card return to Dori's home to find Yates waiting and he attacks them. Knocking out Dori and damaging her home, Yates flees, with Townsend chasing him. Yates steals a pickup truck. With Townsend in the back of the truck they fight over control of it. Dori is discovered by Ramos at her home and is notified that Townsend and Yates were seen and that police cruisers was dispatched to stop them. After crashing through roadblocks and high-speed police chases, the truck swerves and explodes into flames.  Later that day, Ramos questions Dori at the police station about the attack on her and why Townsend, apparently not dead, kidnapped her. She said that she could not say positively why he was not dead but that both Yates and Townsend were possibly high on and drugs and that fooled her and cause the attack. Ramos, not believing but having no other explanation, lets Dori go.  Dori goes to her destroyed home only be captured by Yates who takes her to a deserted location. With wounds, Yates tells Dori that he is a Peacemaker and that Townsend was sent to kill someone who was in his world's Witness Protection. As Yates regenerates he tells Dori that when he joked with her, he could because he had lived on Earth for over 20 years and that if Townsend had a black card with him he needed it because it had the identity of Townsend's victim. Dori, somewhat believing, returns to her home only to be captured by Townsend this time, Who take her to a motel and now tries to convince her that Yates is lying and is a serial killer he was pursuing when they entered a "black hole" together. Before Dori could have the chance to believe him a S.W.A.T team surrounds the motel with Ramos  in charge. Ordering Townsend to surrender, Townsend, dragging Dori, escapes by going through the walls into adjacent rooms and steals a motel patron's car.  Still not being sure and Townsend having a gun, Dori helps Townsend find a cheap hotel to hold up but has second thoughts about him and she escapes him by running over him in a delivery van. Townsend hangs on but is scraped from underneath the van after holding onto the tailpipe. Dori finds Yates and take him to Townsend. Townsend, surprised at Dori, faces Yates who suddenly turns his gun on Dori and threaten to kill her if Townsend did not surrender the control card. Dori, surprised, as well, asked "How could you both have traveled here and arrived differently?" Yates sarcastically said that "We entered the blackhole at the same time but we came out 20 years apart". Still threaten Dori, Yates starts to torture her. Townsend relents and lays down his shotgun.  Looking at Townsend, Yates tells him to open his jacket where Townsend has a "nasty scar". Telling Yates he got it by being ran over by a van, Yates, mockingly jokes, "You do look a little "run down" and turns to Dori and says mockingly, "A joke". With Yates distracted Townsend attacks him and both fight. Yates gets the upper hand, however, and has Townsend dangling from a terrace. Dori, seeing Townsend, attacks Yates but he hits her and places the muzzle of the gun in her mouth to kill her. Townsend, still dangling, reaches into his wound and produce a .38 caliber revolver and fires it into Yates' head where he falls onto electric wires, burst into flames and falls to the ground where he explodes and decomposes in less than 20 seconds.  The commotion brings Ramos to the hotel and finds Dori with Townsend's body. Ramos ask what happen and how did Townsend die this time. Dori came up with a plausible explanation to where Ramos ask "Is that the truth?" Dori's only answer is "Well, it's my story and i'm sticking to it".  Later, at the Medical Examiner's, Dori opens the vault that holds Townsend's body and looking down on him he opens his eyes and looks at her. She smiles and, holding the control card she says "Surf's Up". On the beach, Dori knowing that Townsend was going to try for his ship, with her head hanging down, she tells him "Why do you even have to try?" Townsend remarks, "Because i am a Peacemaker!" Dori, at last says "I wish i could say a joke about now." Townsend, sadly says "Why? I would not understand it, anyway".

Predator 2
 In 1997, Los Angeles is suffering from both a [[heat wave]] and a turf war between heavily armed [[Medellín Cartel|Colombian]] and [[Jamaican posse|Jamaican drug cartels]]. A [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] watches a shootout between the police and Colombians, observing as Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drive the Colombians back into their hideout.  The Predator assaults the Colombians, causing a disturbance that prompts Harrigan and his police detectives Leona Cantrell and Danny Archuleta to defy orders and enter the hideout. They find the Colombians have been slaughtered. Harrigan pursues the crazed gang leader onto the roof and shoots him in self-defense, believing him to be attacking Harrigan, when the latter panickedly opens fire at the camouflaged Predator. Harrigan himself catches a glimpse of the alien, but dismisses it as an effect of the extreme heat and his [[acrophobia]]. At the station, Harrigan is reprimanded by his superiors for his defiance. He is introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes, leader of the task force investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert, the newest member of Harrigan's team.  Later that evening, several Jamaican cartel members storm the Colombian drug lord's penthouse. After they ritualistically murder him, they are slaughtered by the Predator. Harrigan's team enter the penthouse where they find the Jamaicans' skinned corpses suspended from the rafters, noting the similarity to the earlier Colombian massacre. Keyes arrives and kicks Harrigan's team out. Archuleta later returns to continue investigating. After he finds one of the Predator's speartip weapons in an air conditioning vent, the lurking Predator kills him. Harrigan vows to bring down Danny's killer, believing they are dealing with an assassin. Forensic analysis reveals the speartip is not composed of any known element on the [[periodic table]]. Seeking answers, Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie, a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] practitioner, in an alley. King Willie tells Harrigan that the killer is supernatural, and that he should prepare himself for battle against him. Harrigan, even more puzzled, leaves before the Predator kills King Willie, taking his head as a trophy. For Harrigan's persistence, the Predator begins to mark him as his ultimate hunting challenge.  Tracing a lead indicating Danny's killer had recently been in a slaughterhouse, Harrigan arranges to meet his team at a warehouse district to investigate. Cantrell and Lambert take the subway to the rendezvous when the Predator, hunting Harrigan's subordinates, suddenly attacks during a standoff between a gang and a group of vigilantes. The Predator kills the gang and multiple vigilantes; Lambert faces off against the Predator and is killed. Cantrell is spared after the Predator's scan of her body reveals that she is pregnant. Arriving on the scene to find numerous armed civilians dead in addition to Lambert, Harrigan chases the fleeing Predator but is intercepted by Keyes' men. Keyes reveals that the killer is an [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] hunter with [[infrared]] vision that uses [[active camouflage]] and has been hunting humans for sport throughout armed conflicts, [[Predator (film)|most recently in Central America]]. Keyes and his team have set a trap in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits and [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] weapons to capture it for study.  When the Predator arrives, the trap is sprung. However, the Predator uses its mask to scan through various [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wavelengths]] to identify the light from the team's large flashlights. It easily outmaneuvers and slaughters the men before heavily wounding Keyes. Harrigan then attacks the Predator, badly wounding it before it rallies, destroys his weapon and closes in. Harrigan is saved by the sudden reappearance of Keyes, who tries to incapacitate the alien but is killed by its throwing disc. The Predator chases Harrigan to a roof and the two foes clash, leaving them hanging from a ledge. The alien activates a self-destruct device on its forearm which Harrigan then severs using the throwing disc, rendering the device harmless. The Predator falls through an apartment window, treats its wounds and flees through the building.  Harrigan follows it down an elevator shaft and finds a spacecraft in an underground chamber. Inside the ship, after Harrigan briefly glimpses a trophy room with various skulls (including a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]]), he and the Predator face off in a final duel ending when Harrigan finally kills the Predator using its throwing disc. Several other Predators suddenly appear, collecting their dead comrade, and one of them presents Harrigan with an antique [[flintlock]] pistol as a trophy. Harrigan escapes from the ship as it takes off. He reaches the surface just as the remainder of Keyes' team arrives. As Keyes' subordinate Garber curses their lost opportunity to capture the alien, Harrigan privately muses that the creatures will return.  
Prayer of the Rollerboys
 Haim stars as Griffin, a rollerblader in near future [[Los Angeles]], a city overrun with crime and drug use in the wake of a catastrophic economic crash caused by the greed of previous generations. The film includes ominous events, including news reports of riots in Washington D.C., a newspaper headline that proclaims "GERMANY BUYS POLAND" and references to the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] "cleaning up Northern Ireland".   A rollerblade-wearing [[white supremacist]] gang known as the Rollerboys fight for control of what's left of the city. The fascist group is led by a childhood neighbour of Griffin's. The Rollerboys carry out their [[eugenics]] agenda through  violent battles with ethnic gangs and through the distribution of the drug "mist". When Griffin's little brother begins to idolise the Rollerboys and eventually starts abusing mist, Griffin is convinced by an undercover cop ([[Patricia Arquette]]) to join up with the Rollerboys as a mole, in exchange for a better life for his brother.   Having joined up, Griffin's loyalties to the gang are eventually called into question and he is tricked into nearly beating his African-American friend Speedbagger to death. He also discovers that the Rollerboys' mantra "the day of the Rope is coming" actually refers to a toxic chemical "Rope" being added to the mist drug which renders its (mostly non-Caucasian) abusers sterile, enabling the gang's [[genocide|genocidal]] goal.

Postcards from the Edge (film)
 Actress Suzanne Vale ([[Meryl Streep]]) is a recovering [[Addiction|drug addict]] trying to pick up the pieces of her acting [[career]] and get on with her life after being discharged from a [[drug rehabilitation|rehab center]] to kick a [[cocaine]]-[[Oxycodone/aspirin|Percodan]] habit; after overdosing while on a date, her mother admitted her to the rehab center from the emergency room. When she is ready to return to work her agent advises her the studio's insurance policy will cover her only if she lives with a "responsible" individual such as her mother Doris Mann ([[Shirley MacLaine]]). Suzanne is very reluctant to return to the woman from whom she struggled to escape for years after growing up in her shadow. The situation is not helped by the fact that Doris is very loud, competitive, manipulative, self-absorbed and given to offering her daughter unsolicited advice with insinuating value judgments while treating her like a child.  Producer Jack Faulkner ([[Dennis Quaid]]) runs into Suzanne on the set and reveals that he is the one who drove her to the hospital during her last overdose, and the two kiss. Suzanne then agrees to go out with him. During the course of a passionate first date, he professes intense and eternal love for her and she believes every word is true. Suzanne's euphoria is short-lived, however; she subsequently learns from Evelyn Ames ([[Annette Bening]]), a [[Bit part|bit player]] in her latest film, that Jack is sleeping with Evelyn as well. Still dressed in the costume she wears as a uniformed cop in the [[Kitsch|schlock]] movie, Suzanne drives to Jack's house and confronts him. As their argument escalates, Jack implies that Suzanne was much more interesting when she was trying to function while [[Driving under the influence|under the influence]].  At home, Suzanne learns from Doris that Suzanne's sleazy business manager Marty Wiener has absconded with all her money. This leads to a verbal brawl between the two women, and Suzanne storms out to go to a [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|looping]] session. There the paternalistic director Lowell Kolchek ([[Gene Hackman]]) tells her he has more work for her as long as she can remain clean and sober.  Suzanne arrives home and discovers that Doris has crashed her car into a tree after drinking too much wine (and [[Stolichnaya]] [[smoothie]]s). Suzanne rushes to her hospital bedside where the two have a heart-to-heart talk while Suzanne fixes her mother's makeup and arranges a scarf on her head to conceal the fact she bloodied her wig in the accident. Looking and feeling better, Doris musters her courage and faces the media waiting for her. Suzanne runs into Dr. Frankenthal ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]), who had pumped her stomach after her last overdose, and he invites her to see a movie with him. She declines, telling him she's not ready to date yet. Dr. Frankenthal tells her he's willing to wait until she is.  In the film's closing moments Suzanne performs "I'm Checkin' Out," a foot-stomping [[Country music|Country Western]] number, for a scene in Lowell Kolchek's new film.

Pretty Woman
 High-powered businessman Edward Lewis has broken up with his girlfriend after an unpleasant phone call wherein he asked her to escort him during his business trip - she is offended that he treats her as his "beck and call girl". Leaving a business party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], he takes his lawyer's [[Lotus Esprit]] sports car, and accidentally ends up on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in the city's [[red-light district]], where he encounters prostitute Vivian Ward. Having difficulties driving the car, he asks her to get in and guide him to the [[Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel]], where he is staying. It becomes clear that Vivian knows more about the Lotus than he does, and he lets her drive. Vivian charges Lewis $20 for the ride, and they separate. She goes to a bus stop, where he finds her and offers to hire her for the night; later, he asks Vivian to play the role his girlfriend has refused, offering her $3,000 to stay with him for the next six days as well as paying for a new, more acceptable wardrobe for her. That evening, visibly moved by her transformation, Edward begins seeing Vivian in a different light. He begins to open up to her, revealing his personal and business lives.  Edward takes Vivian to a polo match in hopes of networking for his business deal. His attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, and Edward tells him how they truly met. Phillip later approaches Vivian, suggesting they do business once her work with Edward is finished. Insulted, and furious that Edward has revealed their secret, Vivian wants to end the arrangement. Edward apologizes, and admits to feeling jealous of a business associate to whom Vivian paid attention at the match. Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on Edward, and he finds himself acting in unaccustomed ways. Clearly growing involved, Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' at the [[San Francisco Opera]]. Vivian is moved to tears by the story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man. Vivian breaks her "no kissing on the mouth" rule (which her friend Kit taught her) and they have sex; in the aftermath, Vivian tells Edward she loves him, but he does not respond. Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so she can be off the streets. Hurt, she refuses, says this is not the "fairy tale" she dreamed of as a child, in which a knight on a white horse rescues her.  Meeting with the tycoon whose shipbuilding company he is in the process of "raiding," Edward changes his mind. His time with Vivian has shown him a different way of looking at life, and he suggests working together to save the company rather than tearing it apart and selling off the pieces. Phillip, furious at losing so much money, goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for the change in Edward, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, wrestles Philip off her, punches him in the face and throws him out of the room.  With his business in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him, but because she wants to, not because he's paying her. She refuses. Edward re-thinks his life and has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from out the white limousine's sun roof and "rescues her." Edward asks, "So what happens after he climbed up the tower and rescues her?" to which Vivian responds, "She rescues him right back."  
Problem Child (film)
 Ben Healy ([[John Ritter]]) is a good-natured yuppie working for his father, "Big Ben" ([[Jack Warden]]), a very successful, but tyrannical sporting goods dealer running for mayor. Although Ben has worked under his father's employ without as much as a raise or promotion in return, his father plans on handing over control of the company and ownership of the land to the Japanese rather than following the classic "father-son" tradition, seeing his son as "too nice" to be his heir. Ben and his social-climbing wife, Flo ([[Amy Yasbeck]]), have been unable to conceive, because the fertility doctor told them they were both infertile.  Ben approaches an adoption agent, Igor Peabody ([[Gilbert Gottfried]]) with his dilemma, and Igor presents him and Flo with a cute 7-year-old boy named Junior ([[Michael Oliver (actor)|Michael Oliver]]). However, he is hardly a model child; devilish and incorrigible, he leaves a path of serious destruction in his wake, and is even pen pals with Martin Beck ([[Michael Richards]]), a notorious serial killer. The film is interspersed with an imprisoned Martin looking to escape and meet up with Junior, whom he misconstrues as a fellow criminal named "J.R."  Shortly after Ben and Flo bring Junior home, Big Ben visits, and is shocked that they adopted. Junior's bedroom catches fire when he shorts out the clowns in it, and Big Ben calls him "The Devil." Junior throws the cat at Big Ben and they both fall down the stairs.  Junior messes up a camping trip with the neighbors by urinating on the campfire, and manipulating a practical joke played on the kids by their father. He then terrorizes his neighbors' daughter's birthday party, after Lucy, the snobby birthday girl, bans him from her magic show, though her snobby banning possibly spurred him into terrorizing the party. Finally, he displays an effective but unethical method for winning in Little League, which involves beating rival players up with a baseball bat after they bullied him, as the bullying possibly spurred him into causing all that trouble.  (Coincidentally, a few of the rival players were from the camping trip earlier.) Ben is having serious doubts about him, and decides to take him back to the orphanage. However, upon hearing he was returned 30 times, he decides to keep and love him, something no one has ever done. Junior accuses Ben of lying to him. Ben left the keys in the car, and Junior drives it into Big Ben's sporting goods store. Ben has finally given up when his financial advisor calls and says his [[individual retirement account]] has been seized by Big Ben to pay for the damage done to his store. Martin then arrives at the house, who Junior claims as his uncle, and Flo sees this as a chance to be rid of him. He kidnaps them by pretending to take them on a family outing, and leaves a ransom note for Ben.  While Ben first sees this as good riddance to Flo and Junior, he soon notices signs that the latter is not the monster he appeared as. Through a series of pictures he drew, he depicts children and adults who treated him poorly as deformed monsters with hostile surroundings, but depicted Ben as a happy man in a pleasant background, revealing that he did value him as a father figure. Ben, realizing that Junior's behavior was simply a reaction to how he himself was treated by the rather selfish and condescending people he had been surrounded by most of his young life, undertakes a rescue mission to get him back from Martin.  Now exerting a more assertive attitude, Ben first steals his neighbor's car and hat and drives it all over their yard. He also appeals to Big Ben for the ransom money. When Big Ben says Ben ought to see the circumstances as the ultimate change for the better and let Flo and Junior rot, Ben pushes a button that puts him unknowingly on camera, where he ends up revealing his true nature on the news, even mooning the camera. Ben catches up with Martin and Junior at the circus. Junior is rescued after escaping from Martin through a trapeze act, and he calls Ben "Dad" for the first time.  Martin drives away, but the Healys are now on his tail. Flo, who was stuffed in a suitcase, tells Ben she wants a divorce, and he tells her to shut up. Eventually, the suitcase flies over the wall, and ends up in the back of a pig farmer's truck. Martin is arrested, but not before getting a shot off, which hits Ben in the chest. Thinking he has died, Junior tearfully apologizes and says he loves him. He wakes up and realizes the bullet ricocheted off his good-luck prune. Junior removes his bow tie and throws it over the bridge after Ben tells him he just wants him to be himself.  
Presumed Innocent (film)
 Rozat "Rusty" Sabich is a prosecutor and the right-hand man of district attorney Raymond Horgan. When his colleague Carolyn Polhemus is found raped and murdered in her apartment, Raymond insists that Rusty take charge of the investigation. With the election for District Attorney approaching, Tommy Molto, the acting head of the homicide division, has left to join the rival campaign of Nico Della Guardia. Rusty, a married man, faces a conflict of interest since he had a brief sexual affair with Carolyn. As he had shown little ambition and would have therefore been of little use in advancing her career, Carolyn abruptly dumped him. Rusty has since reconciled with his wife Barbara, but is still obsessed with Carolyn.  Detective Harold Greer is initially in charge of the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is type A, the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get evidence against him. Rusty's fingerprints are found on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.  Raymond grows furious with Rusty's handling of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty calls on Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that the beer glass is missing, and Stern persuades Judge Larren Lyttle to keep this from the jury. Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.  The thrust of Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty in order to cover up the bribery case. During the cross-examination of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a [[tubal ligation]], thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive and the fact that the fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.  At his home, Rusty discovers a small hatchet covered with Carolyn's blood and hair on it. As he washes the tool, Barbara admits that she murdered Carolyn, her motive being Rusty's adulterous affair. She expresses that she had left enough evidence for Rusty to know that she committed the crime, but did not anticipate him being charged with the murder. In a voice-over, Rusty explains that Carolyn's murder has been written off as unsolved, since trying two people for the same crime is "a practical impossibility" and he cannot leave his son without a mother even if she could be tried. Rusty regrets that it was his own lust that caused his wife to commit murder.  
Psycho IV: The Beginning
 A once-again rehabilitated [[Norman Bates]] is now married to a psychiatrist named Connie and is expecting a child. Norman secretly fears that the child will inherit his [[mental illness]], so he must seek closure once and for all.  Radio talk show host Fran Ambrose is discussing the topic of [[matricide]] with her guest Dr. Richmond, Norman's former psychologist. Norman calls the show, using the alias "Ed", to tell his story.  Norman's narrative is seen as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s, some [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. When Norman is six years old, his father dies, leaving him in the care of his mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma]]. Over the years, Norma (who is implied to suffer from [[schizophrenia]] and [[borderline personality disorder]]) dominates her son, teaching him that sex is [[sin]]ful and dressing him in girl's clothes as punishment for getting an [[erection]] in her presence.  The two live in contented isolation at the large house as if there is no one else in the world until, in 1949, she becomes engaged to a brutish man named Chet Rudolph. Driven over the edge with jealousy, Norman kills both of them by serving them poisoned iced tea. He then steals and preserves his mother's corpse. He develops a [[Multiple personality disorder|split personality]] in which he "becomes" his mother to suppress the guilt of murdering her; whenever this personality takes over, it drives him to dress in his mother's clothes, put on a wig, and talk to himself in her voice. As "Mother", he murders two local women who try to seduce him during their stay at his newly opened motel.  In the present day, Dr. Richmond realizes "Ed" is Norman and tries to convince Ambrose to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed. Norman fears he will go insane and kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want to create another "monster". He then tells Fran he realizes that his mother is dead, but he fears that his mother may [[Spirit possession|repossess]] him and kill Connie "with my own hands, just like the first time."  Norman takes his wife to his mother's house and does attempt to kill her, but Connie reminds Norman that it was his own choice to go insane and do the things he did (also expressing that she never murdered anyone) and reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster with their guidance; realizing the truth to having freedom of choice, and he drops his knife. Connie forgives him. Finally, Norman impulsively sets fire to the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. Norman barely flees the burning house alive.  He and Connie leave the next day. Norman happily proclaims, "I'm free," indicating that his mother will never again haunt his mind and drive him insane. Then, the wooden doors of the house cellar close on the rocking chair that continues to rock, at which point "Mother" screams for Norman to release her before the screen cuts to black & the sound of a baby crying is heard.

Trying to go on with his life after dumping Mary Lou, Alex tries to patch things up with Sarah by asking her to the prom inaugurating the new gym, only to learn she is going with nerdy Leonard Welsh ([[Jeremy Ratchford]]). Finding himself stalked by Mary Lou, Alex tells his best friend Shane Taylor (David Stratton) everything, which prompts Mary Lou to kill Shane by ripping his heart out. Shane's death is then blamed on Alex, who Shane's parents see fleeing from their house with blood on his hands. Tracked down to his house, Alex is arrested and put in jail. While in his cell, Alex is approached by Mary Lou who, after Alex rejects her once more, leaves to kill Sarah, electrocuting a pair of officers and leaving behind the keys to Alex's cell, which Alex uses to escape.  As Alex races to the prom, forcing Officer Larry (Brock Simpson) to drive him there at gunpoint, Sarah is attacked by Mary Lou, who had killed Leonard by wrapping him in [[magnetic tape]]. Reaching the gymnasium as Mary Lou is about to kill Sarah on stage, Alex willingly goes to Hell with Mary Lou, making her promise that if he goes with her she will leave everyone else alone. As Mary Lou and Alex descend into the ground, Sarah follows them, jumping into the portal before it closes.  After fighting off zombified versions of Shane, Leonard and Andrew in a nightmarish version of Hamilton High with a makeshift flamethrower, Sarah tracks Alex down to Hell's equivalent of Hamilton High's gym. There she sees Mary Lou about to kill Alex so he can be her prom king for all eternity. Sarah interrupts and, after a brief fight with her, manages to blow up Mary Lou by using her flamethrower as a bomb. Alex and Sarah make their way to a garage in the school and hotwire a car. Upon seeing a charred Mary Lou in the way, Alex drives into her and they disappear, reappearing on a street out of Hell.  Believing the event to be over, Alex and Sarah, drive to a diner to contact their parents. However, Mary Lou reappears as well and drives her arm through Sarah, killing her. While Alex tries to get others around him to help, he realizes he is in the 1950s where everyone around him apparently cannot see or hear him. Losing the last of his sanity, he admits defeat to Mary Lou and is left laughing hysterically.

However, the good king has fallen ill, and his greedy Captain of the guards, [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]], plunders and terrorizes the country in the king's name. One day, when [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Goofy]] and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], three [[Beggar|beggars]] are trying to get money for some food, Captain Pete's carriage, filled with stolen food, passes.

Pump Up the Volume (film)
 Mark Hunter (Slater), a [[high school]] student in a sleepy suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], starts an [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[pirate radio]] station that broadcasts from the basement of his parents' house. Mark is a loner, an outsider, whose only outlet for his teenage angst and aggression is his unauthorized radio station. His pirate station's theme song is "[[Everybody Knows (Leonard Cohen song)|Everybody Knows]]" by [[Leonard Cohen]] and there are glimpses of [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] by such alternative musicians as [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[Camper Van Beethoven]], [[Primal Scream]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Ice-T]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Concrete Blonde]], [[Henry Rollins]], and [[The Pixies]].  By day, Mark is seen as a loner, hardly talking to anyone around him; by night, he expresses his outsider views about what is wrong with American society. When he speaks his mind about what is going on at his school and in the community, more and more of his fellow students tune in to hear his show.  Nobody knows the true identity of "Hard Harry" or "Happy Harry Hard-on," as Mark refers to himself, until Nora Diniro (Mathis), a fellow student, tracks him down and confronts him the day after a student named Malcolm commits suicide after Harry attempts to reason with him. The radio show becomes increasingly popular and influential after Harry confronts the suicide head-on, exhorting his listeners to do something about their problems instead of surrendering to them through suicide—at the crescendo of his yelled speech, an [[overachieving]] student named Paige Woodward (who has been a constant listener) jams her various medals and accolades into a microwave and turns it on.  She then sits, watching the awards cook until the microwave explodes, injuring her. While this is happening, other students act out in cathartic release.  Eventually, the radio show causes so much trouble in the community that the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] is called in to investigate. During the fracas, it is revealed that the school's principal (Annie Ross) has been expelling "problem students," namely, students with below-average standardized test scores, in an effort to boost the district's test scores while still keeping their names on the rolls (a criminal offense) in order to retain government funding.  Realizing he has started something huge, Mark decides it is up to him to end it. He dismantles his radio station and attaches it to his mother's old [[jeep]], creating a mobile transmitter so his position can't be triangulated. Pursued by the police and the FCC, Nora drives the jeep around while Mark broadcasts. The harmonizer he uses to disguise his voice breaks, and with no time left to fix it, Mark decides to broadcast his final message as himself. They finally drive up to the crowd of protesting students, and Mark tells them that the world belongs to them and that they should make their own future. The police step in and arrest Mark and Nora. As they are taken away, Mark reminds the students to "talk hard." As the film ends, the voices of other students (and even one of the teachers) speak as intros for their own independent stations, which can be heard broadcasting across the country.

Puppet Master II
  The film begins in 1990, when [[Andre Toulon|André Toulon]]'s grave is being excavated in [[Shady Oaks]], a [[cemetery]] in the backyard of the [[Hotel Green|Bodega Bay Inn]]. We see [[Pinhead (Puppet Master)|Pinhead]] digging Andre’ Toulon's grave. Pinhead opens up the coffin, climbs out, and pours a vial of the potion on the skeleton, with [[Tunneler (Puppet Master)|Tunneler]], [[Leech Woman]], [[Blade (Puppet Master)|Blade]] and [[Jester (Puppet Master)|Jester]] watching. After pouring the formula, the [[skeleton]] raises its arms, indicating that André Toulon is alive again. A few months later, a group of [[parapsychologists]], led by Carolyn Bramwell, are sent to the hotel to investigate the strange murder of Megan Gallagher and the lunatic ravings of a now insane Alex Whitaker. It is explained that Megan's brain was extracted through her nose '''('''''by Blade''''')''', and Alex, suspected of the murder, is now locked up in an [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylum]]. While at the asylum, he begins to experience terrible [[seizures]] and [[premonitions]].  That very evening, one of the investigators, Camille Kenney, decides to leave after spotting two of the puppets in her room. However, while packing, Pinhead and Jester attack and kidnap her. The next day, Carolyn talks to Michael about the disappearance of his mother, due to finding Camille's belongings and car still at the hotel. That very evening Carolyn's brother Patrick ([[Gregory Webb]]) gets his head tunneled by Tunneler. Another investigator, Lance ([[Jeff Weston]]) runs in, knocks Tunneler out, and kills him by crushing him with a lamp. After dissecting Tunneler, they realize that the puppets are not remote controlled, but rather that their gears and wood are run by a chemical. From this, they deduce that the chemical must be the secret of [[artificial intelligence]].  The next morning, while still trying understand the puppet's motivation, a man named Eriquee Chaneé comes in, stating that he had inherited the hotel, and that he was in [[Bucharest]] while the investigators moved in. Afterwards, Camille's son Michael travels to the hotel, trying to figure out what happened to his mother. That very evening, Blade and Leech Woman go to a local farmer's house, where Leech Woman kills the husband, Matthew, but gets thrown into the fireplace by the wife, Martha. Just before Martha shoots Blade with her shotgun, a new puppet, [[Torch (Puppet Master)|Torch]], walks in and burns Martha with his flame-throwing arm. It is then revealed that Eriquee is really André Toulon and he created Torch after being brought back to life, and he believes that Carolyn is a [[reincarnation]] of his now deceased wife, Elsa.  Toulon then has a flashback of him and Elsa buying the formula of eternal life from a Cairo Merchant. The next morning, Michael and Carolyn go into town to find Camille and to find out more about Eriquee Chanee. During this, it is revealed that the puppets are killing because they are growing weaker and need the secret ingredient that makes that formula: brain tissue. Carolyn finds no records of Eriquee Chaneé, and starts to connect Eriquee to the disappearance of Camille and the death of her brother, Patrick. At the same time, she also realizes she has a crush on Michael. That same evening, Carolyn and Michael kiss, and have a little romantic interlude, as do Lance and Wanda, the remaining two investigators. While Wanda goes back to her room, Blade kills Lance, killing Wanda afterwards. After killing them, he uses their tissue for the formula.  During this, Carolyn sneaks into Eriquee's room, and finds two life sized mannequins in the wardrobe. Eriquee sneaks up behind Carolyn, and still thinking she is Elsa, ties her up. Michael, hearing her screams, wakes up and goes to rescue her, all while fighting off Torch, Pinhead, and Blade. On his way up, the [[freight elevator|dumbwaiter]] opens, revealing Jester and Michael's dead mother, Camille. Toulon transfers his soul into one of the mannequins, and explains that after seeing Carolyn, he decided for them to live together forever. The puppets, upon hearing this, realize Toulon used them for his evil needs, and start torturing him. Michael then breaks into the room, saves Carolyn, and the two run out of the hotel. Up in the attic, Torch sets Toulon on fire, causing him to fall out a window and die. Afterward, Jester goes back to Camille's body with the remaining of the formula.  Several days later, it is revealed that Camille's soul has been put in the woman-sized mannequin, and is now running her own little puppet show. Blade, Pinhead, and Jester, are locked up in a cage, leaving Torch free. Camille takes them to the Bouldeston Institution for the mentally troubled tots and teens. Camille puts the puppets in the back of her car, and Torch up on the passenger's seat, and drives off, leaving this movie as a [[cliff-hanger]].

Quick Change
 Grimm, dressed as a [[clown]], robs a bank in [[midtown Manhattan]]. He ingeniously sets up a hostage situation and then slips away with an enormous sum of money ($1 million) and his accomplices: girlfriend Phyllis and best friend Loomis.  The heist itself is comparatively straightforward and easy, but the getaway turns into a nightmare. The relatively simple act of getting to the airport to catch a flight out of the country is complicated by the fact that fate, luck and all of [[New York City]] appears to be conspiring against their escape.  To begin with, the trio is seeking the [[Brooklyn-Queens Expressway]] to get the airport, but the signs were taken during construction work, resulting in the three robbers becoming lost in an unfamiliar part of the city. Then, a con-artist/thief robs the trio of everything they have (except the bank money, which they have taped under their clothes).  When changing into new clothes, they are almost gunned down by the stressed incoming tenant of Phyllis' apartment, as members of the [[fire department]] respond to a call by pushing their hydrant-blocking car out of the way only to make it roll into a ditch.  When the three crooks eventually manage to flag down a cab, the driver is hopelessly non-fluent in English. This leads Loomis to jumping out of the moving cab to grab another, but he runs into a newsstand and the driver leaves, thinking he's killed Loomis. An anal-retentive bus driver, a run-in with mobsters and Phyllis' increasing desperation to tell Grimm the news that she is [[pregnant]] with his child add further complications.  All the while, Rotzinger, a world-weary but relentless chief of the [[New York City Police Department]], is doggedly attempting to nab the fleeing trio. A meeting on board an airliner at the airport occurs between the robbers and the chief, who gets the added prize of having a major crime-boss dropped in his lap with their assistance. Unfortunately the chief only realizes who they were after their plane has taken off.  
Quigley Down Under
 Matthew Quigley (Tom Selleck) is an American [[cowboy]] and sharpshooter with a specially modified rifle with which he can shoot accurately at extraordinary distances. He answers a newspaper advertisement that asks for a man with a special talent in long-distance shooting, using just four words, "M. Quigley 900 yards," written on a copy of the advertisement that is punctured by six closely spaced bullet holes.  When he arrives in [[Australia]], he gets into a fight with employees of the man who hired him, who are trying to force "Crazy Cora" (Laura San Giacomo) onto their wagon. After he identifies himself, he is taken to the [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] of Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman), who informs Quigley his [[Marksman|sharpshooting]] skills will be used to eradicate the increasingly elusive [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. Quigley turns down the offer and throws Marston out of his own house.   The aborigine manservant knocks Quigley over the head and Marston's men beat him and Cora unconscious and dump them in the [[outback]] with no water and little chance of survival. However, they are rescued by Aborigines. Cora now reveals that she comes from Texas. When her home was attacked by [[Comanche]]s, she hid in the cellar and accidentally suffocated her child while trying to prevent him from crying. Her husband had then put her alone on a ship to Australia. Now Cora consistently calls Quigley by her husband’s name (Roy), much to his annoyance.  When Marston's men attack the Aborigines who helped them, Quigley kills three. Escaping on a single horse, they encounter more of the men driving Aborigines over a cliff. Quigley drives them off with his deadly shooting and Cora rescues an orphaned baby she finds among the dead Aborigines. Leaving Cora and the infant in the desert with food and water, Quigley rides alone to a nearby town. There he obtains new ammunition from a local German gunsmith, who hates Marston for his murdering ways. Quigley also learns that he has become a legendary hero among the Aborigines.   Marston's men are also in town and recognize Quigley's horse. When they attack, cornering him in a burning building, he escapes through a skylight and kills all but one of them. The injured survivor is sent back to say he will be following. First Quigley returns to Cora and the baby, which she has just saved from an attack by dingoes. At first she had tried to stop it crying, but then told it to make as much noise as it liked as she gunned the animals down. Back in town, she gives the baby to Aborigines living there after Quigley tells her that the child has 'a right to happiness'.   The next morning, Quigley rides away to confront Marston at his station. At first he shoots the defenders from his location in the hills but is eventually shot in the leg and captured by Marston's last two men. Marston, who has noticed that Quigley only ever carries a rifle, decides to give him a lesson in the "quick-draw" style of gunfighting. As the two face off, Marston makes the first move, but is beaten to the draw by Quigley, who shoots the two remaining men as well. As Marston lies dying, Quigley refers to an earlier conversation, telling him, "I said I never had much use for one [a revolver]; I never said I didn't know how to use it."  Marston's servant comes out of the house and gives Quigley his rifle back, then walks away from the ranch, stripping off his western-style clothing as he goes. An army troop now arrives to arrest Quigley for murder until they notice the surrounding hills are lined with Aborigines and decide to withdraw. Later he and Cora book a passage back to America in the name of Roy Cobb, Cora’s husband, since Quigley is still wanted. On the wharf she reminds him that he once told her that she had to say two words before he would make love to her. Smiling broadly, she calls him "Matthew Quigley" and the two embrace for the first time.  
Q&A (film)
  Mike Brennan, a tough, crude, decorated [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detective lieutenant, has a hidden dark side as well as a partnership with certain figures of organized crime. Brennan shoots and kills a small-time Puerto Rican criminal and then threatens witnesses to testify that he acted in self-defense. The Head of the District Attorneys Homicide Bureau, Kevin Quinn assigns the case to Deputy District Attorney Aloysius "Al" Francis Reilly, a young lawyer with a past as a police officer and the son of an NYPD cop who was killed in the line of duty.  Reilly collects Brennan's deposition, who claims to have been acting on a tip from an informant and was forced to shoot in self-defense. Reilly's case leads him to a Puerto Rican crime boss called "Bobby Tex," Texador, whose wife Nancy Bosch was once the love of Reilly's life. She ended their relationship years ago after interpreting Al's reaction of surprise as racist when she introduced him to her father, a black man. Al tries to rekindle their past romance, but she rejects him because with Bobby, she feels loved, protected and accepted for who and what she is.  Al, along with detectives Sam "Chappie" Chapman and Luis Valentin, has doubts about the dynamics of the event, knowing the environment of the Puerto Rican underworld. Investigations reveal a link between Quinn and Brennan, while the latter goes on the trail of Roger "the dodger" Montalvo, the only witness who can disprove his testimony of self-defense. Brennan tries threatening Valentin and offering to bribe Chappie for help in finding Montalvo and shutting him up. Meanwhile, Bobby Tex is "invited" by the Mafia to step aside as a drug dealer, as Brennan's support is still useful to them. Bobby, in turn, begins looking for Montalvo to use as leverage against Brennan. At the same time he begins to shut down his business in order to retire to private life with Nancy in Puerto Rico.   Bobby finds Montalvo before Brennan, and together they leave for Puerto Rico, where the smuggler owns a mansion and a yacht. Here he is joined by Al, called secretly to give him an important information about the case. Al, after informing Chief Deputy District Attorney  Bloomenfeld, he goes to the island, where it is revealed that Quinn nicknamed "Skinny") was once part of Bobby's street gang, and participated in a murder by shooting a rival gang member.  Brennan appears to be hunting down all of the gang's former members on Quinn's orders, with the intention of erasing Quinn's past to fulfill Quinn's political ambitions to run for the office if NY State Attorney General.  Brennan is forced to go along with it because Quinn is holding an [[abuse of authority]] [[Criminal charge|charge]] over him.  Even the Mafia intends to close accounts with both Bobby and Brennan, whose position is becoming increasingly untenable. They fail in an attempt to kill Bobby, who has announced his retirement. Meanwhile, Brennan is able to find Montalvo's lover, the transgender José Malpica, and using a voice message from Roger that he is "on a boat chalked the 'Nancy' in Puerto Rico) then kills Malpica after listening to a message from Montalvo on his answering machine that reveals his location. Brennan finds Roger and strangles him. He then slices the boat's fuel line and waits for Bobby to arrive. A phone call made by Al saves Nancy at the last moment, but Bobby is killed in the subsequent explosion.  Al procures an arrest warrant for Brennan but fails to catch him at the airport. He returns to the DA's office to find Brennan waiting for him. Brennan reveals the truth about Al's father; that he was a [[bagman]] and [[bigot]], who was sort of a "line" to keep minorities down, and shoots Chappie when he tries to intervene. Brennan is then shot dead by another officer.  Al is summoned by Quinn, who informs him that he is aware of his activities, but the Department is going to hush up the incident to avoid embarrassment in the year's upcoming [[mayor]]al election. When Al threatens to go to the papers, Bloomenfeld tells him that he has ways of preventing that too, and in turn reminds Al that sources in the mayor's office could leak evidence of misconduct on the part of his late father, which would deny his mother her widows service pension.  Feeling betrayed and disillusioned, Al trashes his desk and office and resigns from the DA's office. He searches for Nancy, hoping she will return to him but when he finds her in Puerto Rico, she replies to his questions about getting back together for a possible [[marriage]] only with silence as she is mourning Bobby's death.

Bride of Re-Animator
 Eight months after the events of ''Re-Animator'', doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain are working as medics in the middle of a bloody [[Internal conflict in Peru|Peruvian civil war]]. In the chaos of battle and with plenty of casualties to work on, they are free to experiment with West's re-animation [[reagent]]. When their medical tent is stormed by the enemy troops, West and Cain return home to [[Arkham]], [[Massachusetts]]. There, they resume their former jobs as doctors at [[Miskatonic University]] Hospital, and West returns to the basement laboratory of Cain's house to continue his research.  Using parts pilfered from both the hospital's morgue and from the cemetery conveniently located next door, West discovers that his reagent can re-animate body parts by themselves. He becomes determined to create an entire living person from disparate body parts. West discovers the heart of Megan Halsey, Cain's fiancée, in the hospital morgue. With the promise to use her heart to re-animate a new Megan, West convinces Cain to help him with his project. Also stored in the morgue is the rest of the evidence from the previous "Miskatonic Massacre". Inside, [[pathologist]] Dr. Wilbur Graves discovers a vial of West's reagent and the severed head of Dr. Carl Hill. Using the reagent, he re-animates Hill's head.  Meanwhile, police officer Lt. Leslie Chapham begins investigating West and Cain. He bears a grudge against the pair, as they were the only unaffected survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre; the dead body of Chapham's wife was re-animated into a crazed [[zombie]] during the incident. Chapham suspects West and Cain were responsible. When he stops by their house to question them, he discovers West's corpse-filled lab and the two get into an ugly confrontation. A fight ensues and West ends up killing Chapham by means of cloth treated with a chemical which causes cardiac arrest when inhaled (a product of West's research into obtaining the freshest possible corpses for his experiments). West then re-animates the police officer with the intention of covering up his crime. Chapham violently wanders out of the house and into the cemetery next door.  Hill also bears a grudge against West, as West was responsible for his decapitation, the destruction of his body, taking away Megan (with whom he was obsessed), and having better theories about reanimation than himself. Using [[Hypnosis|hypnotic powers]], Hill commands Chapham to force Dr. Graves to stitch bat wings onto his neck, giving him back his mobility. He also extends his mental control to all of the zombie survivors of the Miskatonic Massacre.  When one of Cain's patients, the beautiful Gloria, dies, West collects the last piece he needs for his creation: her head. With a complete body stitched and wired together, West and Cain inject the re-animation reagent into Meg's heart. While waiting for the reagent to take effect, a package is delivered to their house. West retrieves and opens it. From inside, Hill's winged head flies out. Simultaneously, all of the zombies he controls break into the house. West retreats back to the basement lab, where his creation, the Bride, has awoken.  A [[catfight]] breaks out between the Bride and Cain's current girlfriend, Italian journalist Francesca Danelli, whom he met in Peru. Cain rejects the Bride's love and sides with Francesca. Heart-broken, the Bride rips Megan's heart out of her own chest and then literally falls to pieces. West diagnoses this as [[Transplant rejection|tissue rejection]].  Hill and his zombies force West, Cain and Francesca to retreat through the wall of the lab and into a crypt in the neighboring cemetery. Inside, all of West's prior test subjects arise and make their way towards him, stopping only when Herbert commands them to. The unstable crypt begins to collapse, trapping Hill, West and the zombies. Cain and Francesca manage to escape the debris and claw their way to the surface of the cemetery together. Hill, stuck in the debris, laughs manically, while Megan's heart, still in the hand of the Bride, stops beating.  
The Rescuers Down Under
  In the [[Australia|Australian]] [[Outback]], a young boy named Cody rescues and befriends a rare [[golden eagle]] called Marahuté, who shows him her nest and eggs. Later on, he falls into an animal trap set by Percival C. McLeach, a local poacher wanted by the [[Council ranger|Australian Rangers]]. When McLeach finds one of Marahuté's feathers in Cody's backpack, he realizes he knows the eagle's location, and reveals he killed another, Marahuté's mate.  McLeach throws Cody's backpack to a pack of [[crocodile]]s to trick the Rangers into thinking that Cody was eaten, and kidnaps him, intending to extract Marahuté's whereabouts.  A mouse, the bait in the trap, runs off to a secret outpost, from which a telegram is sent to the Rescue Aid Society headquarters in [[New York City]].  Bernard and Miss Bianca, the RAS' elite field agents, are assigned to the mission, interrupting Bernard's attempt to propose marriage to Bianca. They go to find Orville the [[albatross]], who aided them previously, but instead meet his brother, Wilbur, whom they convince to fly them to Australia.  There, they meet Jake, a [[hopping mouse]] who is the RAS' local regional operative. Jake becomes infatuated with Bianca and flirts with her, much to Bernard's dismay.  He serves as their "tour guide" and protector in search of the boy.  Wilbur accidentally bends his [[Vertebra|spinal column]] out of shape trying to help them, so Jake sends him to the hospital (an old abandoned ambulance).  As Wilbur refuses to undergo surgery and escapes his captors, his back is unintentionally straightened in the struggle with the mouse medical staff. Cured, Wilbur departs in search of his friends.  At McLeach's hideout, Cody is imprisoned with a number of captured animals after refusing to divulge Marahuté's whereabouts.  Cody tries to free himself and the animals, but is thwarted by Joanna, McLeach's pet [[goanna]].  Realizing that Marahuté's eggs are Cody's weak spot, McLeach tricks Cody into thinking someone else killed Marahuté and releases him, knowing Cody will go to Marahuté's nest.  Bernard, Bianca, and Jake arrive as McLeach gives chase and jump onto his [[Half-track|halftrack]] to follow him.  At Marahuté's nest, the mice try to warn Cody, but just then, Marahuté appears and McLeach captures her, along with Cody, Jake and Bianca.  McLeach then sends Joanna to eat Marahuté's eggs, but Bernard manages to trick her using egg-shaped stones, and she leaves without harming the real eggs.  Wilbur arrives at the nest, whereupon Bernard convinces him to sit on the eggs while he goes after McLeach.  McLeach takes his captives to Crocodile Falls, a huge [[waterfall]] at the end of the river he threw Cody's backpack into.  He ties Cody up and hangs him over a group of crocodiles in attempts to feed him to them, but Bernard, riding a wild [[razorback]] pig he tamed using a [[Horse whisperer|horse whispering]] technique he learned from Jake, arrives and disables McLeach's vehicle.  McLeach then tries to shoot the rope holding Cody above the water, but Bernard tricks Joanna into crashing into McLeach, sending both of them into the water.  The crocodiles attack McLeach and Joanna, while behind them Cody falls into the water as the damaged rope breaks.  While Joanna flees, McLeach fends off the crocodiles, but forgets until too late about the waterfall and plunges over it to his death.  Bernard dives into the water and holds Cody long enough for Jake and Bianca to free Marahuté, allowing her to save Cody and Bernard just as they go over the waterfall.  Bernard, desperate to prevent any further incidents, proposes to Bianca, who eagerly and happily accepts while Jake salutes him with a new-found respect.  Safe at last, the group departs for Cody's home.  Meanwhile, Marahuté's eggs finally hatch, much to Wilbur's chagrin.  
Repossessed (film)
 Father Jebediah Mayii (Nielsen) casts out the [[devil]] from the body of young Nancy Aglet (Blair). Seventeen years later, in 1990, Nancy's body is [[demonic possession|possessed]] once again, however, while watching ''The Ernest and Fanny Miracle Hour'', a religious broadcast.   After a visit to the hospital, and a visit from Father Luke Brophy (Starke), Brophy concludes that Nancy is indeed possessed. Mayii, however, refuses to perform the [[exorcism]], claiming he is too weak, and that both he and Nancy barely survived her previous exorcism. Brophy then visits the Supreme Council for Exorcism Granting. Ernest and Fanny ([[Ned Beatty]] and Lana Schwab) of ''The Ernest and Fanny Miracle Hour'' are also present. Ernest concludes that an exorcism is warranted, and convinces the Council to televise Nancy's exorcism. They agree, believing it will convert millions, so Ernest presents ''Ernest and Fanny's Exorcism Tonight'' to the network.   Feeling he may be needed, Mayii visits "Bods-R-Us", a gymnasium, to restore his physical strength. There, Brophy approaches him, informs him of the televised exorcism, and attempts once more to convince Mayii to conduct the exorcism, though he refuses again. The night of Nancy's exorcism arrives, presented by Ernest and Fanny.   After a montage of attempts to free Nancy's body using phone donations, song, and insults ("You're so tough, how come you possessed a woman's body?"), ''Ernest and Fanny's Exorcism Tonight'' is announced as having the largest audience in history. Upon hearing this, the devil, in Nancy's body, sets the studio on fire, causing the audience to flee. He reveals to Ernest and Fanny that he used them to get the largest audience, and turns them into a [[pantomime horse]].   Using the camera, the devil tries to claim the souls of the viewing audience, but is stopped by Brophy, who destroys the camera. The devil announces he knows another way to claim their souls, and runs away, heading for a satellite transmitter. He is pursued by religious figures from around the world, who have gathered at Brophy's command. Brophy teases the devil about his defeat to Mayii.   Back in the studio, the devil successfully uses the camera to lure Mayii to him for a rematch. The exorcism, with commentary by "Mean Gene" Okerlund and Jesse "The Body" Ventura, is ineffective until the devil mentions that he hates [[Rock 'n Roll]]. Turning the TV studio into a live concert, the song "[[Devil with a Blue Dress On]]" is played to the devil by the various religious figures, including [[The Pope]] on guitars. The devil is tormented so that he is finally driven from Nancy's body, declaring "[[I'll be back|I'll be back!]]".  
The Reflecting Skin
 Eight year-old Seth Dove (Jeremy Cooper) lives in an isolated American prairie community in the 1950s.  The film opens with Seth and his friends Eben and Kim, playing with a frog Seth has found in the fields.  The boys inflate the frog by inserting a reed up its anus and leave it by the side of the road.  When a local English widow, Dolphin Blue ([[Lindsay Duncan]]), stops to inspect it, Seth shoots the inflated frog with a [[slingshot]], causing it to explode over Dolphin.  Seth retreats back to the small gas station where he lives with his harridan mother Ruth (Sheila Moore) and shy father Luke (Duncan Fraser). Seth’s older brother, Cameron ([[Viggo Mortensen]]), is away on [[military service]] in the Pacific (Ruth refers to them as "the pretty islands").  Seth serves gas to a mysterious group of young men driving a black [[Cadillac]], who promise to see him again soon and drive off.  Seth is sent to Dolphin’s house to apologise for the frog prank.  Dolphin is haunted by the memory of her dead husband, who hung himself for unknown reasons a week after their wedding.  Surrounded by artifacts from her husband’s family’s whaling past, Seth takes some of her self-pitying remarks (she claims to be "two hundred years old") literally, and after learning about vampires from his father, who is reading a novel on that theme, Seth surmises that Dolphin must be a vampire.  After Eben goes missing, Seth and Kim go to Dolphin’s house to investigate, because Seth believes she is responsible for Eben's disappearance. The boys excitedly demolish Dolphin’s bedroom belongings, and run from the house screaming after spying on her masturbating. Seth runs home, and later finds Eben’s dead body floating in the water cistern. The local authorities believe Luke is responsible, because of a homosexual indiscretion years previously; believing himself to be doomed, Luke douses himself with petrol and incinerates himself.  Cameron returns home to look after Seth, as Ruth has become shell-shocked following Luke’s death.  Whilst visiting his grave, Cameron meets Dolphin, and romance sparks between the two, much to Seth’s horror.  In a nearby barn, Seth and Kim discover an ossified dead fetus, which Seth believes to be Eben incarnate as a fallen angel and takes home with him. The next day, Seth follows Cameron to Dolphin’s house, where he observes Cameron emotionally confessing to Dolphin his culpability in atomic bomb experiments. Cameron and Dolphin begin to make love; running in terror from the house, Seth witnesses the men in the Cadillac abducting Kim.  Cameron’s body begins to deteriorate from [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation sickness]], which Seth attributes to Dolphin's supposed vampirism. Kim’s body is discovered the next day, and law enforcement authorities still believe that Luke is alive and responsible. As Cameron and Dolphin grow closer and plot to run away together, Seth focuses his rage at Dolphin. After consulting with the fetus "angel" and on the spur of the moment, he does not warn Dolphin of the men in the black Cadillac as they approach the two, and lets her go off with them. The next morning, Dolphin’s body is found, and Cameron breaks down into tears. Realising the reality of what he has done, Seth runs to a nearby field and, overwhelmed with guilt and grief, screams at the setting sun.

The Return of Superfly
  Joey Maxwell, Manuel, and Reynaldo invade a Harlem, New York, drug den, killing three dealers. One escapes long enough to telephone his boss, Eddie Baker, but Eddie is having sex and is too intoxicated on drugs to respond. The three killers break into Eddie’s apartment and murder him and his girl friend. Reformed drug dealer Youngblood Priest, who has been living in Paris, France, for the past decade, returns to New York City for Eddie’s funeral. Arrested by customs officers at JFK Airport, Priest is sent to a detention center. He telephones Tom Perkins, his former lawyer, who arranges a meeting with New York Police Department Inspector Wolinski. Perkins tells Wolinski that the statute of limitations has expired on Priest’s crimes, but Wolinski informs him that there is no statute of limitations on perjury.   Wolinski introduces Priest to a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent who offers a bargain: Priest can return to his old gang if he works as an informant. However, Priest claims his gang no longer exists. Besides, he has changed since the old days and now has a legitimate business in Paris. Inspector Wolinski turns Priest loose for a week to think it over. Meanwhile, Tom Perkins informs local crime boss Hector Estrada that Priest is being “squeezed” by the “Feds,” and Estrada tells Joey Maxwell to get rid of the problem. Youngblood Priest goes to the penthouse apartment of his old friend, Armando, and finds a beautiful woman, Irene, taking a shower. She explains that Armando gave her a key, and that Armando’s Chevrolet Corvette is in the basement if Priest needs a car. Priest visits the home of Nate Cabot, one of his old drug partners. Nate laments that most of their friends are dead or in prison, but Joey Maxwell, one of Priest’s former employees, has become the henchman for drug kingpin Hector Estrada. Nate and his wife make crack cocaine in their kitchen for Estrada’s operation. Priest tells Nate he has money to spend and wants to meet Maxwell or Estrada. Nate promises to check around. Returning to Tom Perkins’s office, Priest meets another of the lawyer’s clients, a club owner named Francine. Perkins reminds Priest that the DEA is still waiting to hear whether he is going to cooperate.   As Priest gives Francine a ride to her club, she explains that she knew Eddie for a long time, but there was nothing romantic between them. She gives Priest her business card. Noticing that two white policemen, Mike and Ike, are following him, Priest drives into the garage of an apartment building, parks, and tries to elude them on foot, but the officers stop him in an alley and beat him. However, a white plainclothes cop, Louis, breaks it up and lets Priest go. Meanwhile, when Tom Perkins alerts Hector Estrada that Priest will be a problem, Estrada declares Priest to be “as good as dead.” Priest stops at Francine’s bar, recognizes nobody, and talks to the bartender. Elsewhere, Irene returns to the penthouse and finds Joey Maxwell, Manuel, and Reynaldo waiting. Irene pulls a gun and shoots Renaldo in the leg, but Manuel kills her. As the three leave, Priest arrives and finds Irene dead. Moments later, three uniformed policemen enter the penthouse and arrest him. He is taken to a police station, but the DEA intervenes and gets him released. Louis, the white plainclothes policeman who saved him from Mike and Ike, alerts Priest that the killers went to the penthouse to kill him, not Irene. Meanwhile, Hector Estrada orders Joey Maxwell to find Priest and kill him.   When Priest goes to Francine’s club, she warns him that people are looking for him and slips him out the back door. Getting into a taxi, Priest tells the Jamaican driver to evade the car behind them. Meanwhile, Joey Maxwell, Mike, and Ike visit Nate and tell him that since his friend Priest is a traitor, Nate is probably is as well. When Nate cannot tell them where Priest is, Maxwell orders Ike and Mike to kill him. After Priest and Francine make love at her place, she sends him to see Willy Green, Eddie Baker’s eccentric best friend. Dressed in camouflage clothes, Willy greets Priest with a shotgun, but recognizes his name from stories Eddie told him. Priest knows who killed Eddie, but needs Willy’s help to avenge his death. Willy is a Viet Nam war veteran whose specialty was demolition with nitroglycerin. He also has an arsenal of rifles, pistols, and automatic weapons, from which Priest selects a pistol. He returns to Francine’s office to ask her about a girl Willy mentioned as being Joey Maxwell’s girl friend. Francine reveals her name to be Jasmine Jackson. After Priest leaves, one of the white uniformed policemen enters the bar asking for Francine, the bartender silently signals her office, but as Francine slips out the back, the other cop is waiting.   Mike and Ike handcuff Francine and drive her to a park where Joey Maxwell waits. She insists she has no idea where Priest is, so Maxwell gives her to Ike and Mike for further persuasion and leaves. Later, as Maxwell arrives at his apartment with Jasmine Jackson, Priest accosts him with a gun. When Maxwell struggles, Priest knocks him unconscious, empties his wallet, gives all the money to Jasmine, and tells her to take a vacation. He takes the bound-and-gagged gangster to Willy’s house. Willy straps a nitroglycerin bomb around Joey Maxwell’s neck, and Priest warns him that the wrong move could blow his head off. Maxwell confesses that Ike, Mike, and Hector killed Irene. Priest makes Maxwell telephone Mike and Ike and order them to drive to a remote location. The cops park, and a boy on a bicycle distracts them while Willy Green crawls under their cruiser and plants explosives.   As Willy hurries away, the car blows up. Joey Maxwell reveals where he keeps his cocaine, and Priest and Willy go to a warehouse. While Willy distracts the security guard, Priest climbs a fire escape, breaks into Maxwell’s office, and mixes something into a large, plastic container of crack cocaine. Meanwhile, at a club, Hector orders Manuel and Reynaldo to get the latest batch of crack cocaine on the street. Manuel and Reynaldo hurry to the warehouse, where they bag and weigh packets of the contaminated drug, and deliver it to dealers. However, because of Priest’s added ingredient, addicts get sick and demand their money back. One angry young black man chases a dealer off a roof. At Willy Green’s house, Priest coerces Maxwell into divulging the addresses of his crack houses.   Meanwhile, Hector makes telephone inquiries from his office to find out who adulterated his drugs. Priest sends Willy to blow up several of the gang’s storefronts. The next morning, Tom Perkins advises Hector Estrada to “lay low” until the violence subsides, because the DEA is investigating. Manuel speculates that the explosions at the gang’s storefronts must be the work of Willy Green, the only bomb expert in Eddie Baker’s gang. Manuel and Reynaldo break into Willy’s house, shoot him, and free Joey Maxwell, who revives his spirits by inhaling drugs, not realizing they are contaminated. Suddenly, with his last breath, Willy shoots Reynaldo.   Returning to the house, Priest hears gunshots. He blows open the door with nitroglycerine and kills Manuel in the subsequent shootout. Both Priest and Joey Maxwell are wounded as they run, shooting from the house, but Maxwell stops to vomit. As angry neighborhood people surround Maxwell, police arrive to arrest him. Tom Perkins and Hector Estrada are offered deals in return for their cooperation to inform on the entire “Colombian set-up.” Youngblood Priest returns to Paris with Francine.<ref name=synopsis></ref>

Tibey tells his friend goodbye. At the airport, Tibey also gives Miryea one last kiss. Jay is secretly waiting to drive her to the cabin.  At their hideaway, they are surprised by Tibey and his men. Jay's beloved dog is shot dead. Calling Miryea a "faithless whore", Tibey strikes her and cuts her across the mouth with a knife (creating half a [[Glasgow smile]]), as Tibey's henchmen viciously beat and kick Jay. After setting fire to the cabin, they dump Jay in the desert, and leave him to die.  Miryea is placed in a whorehouse, where she is drugged, abused, and relegated to "common use". The young man responsible for keeping her drugged has AIDS. As Miryea no longer wishes to live the life of a common prostitute, she persuades him to share a needle with her, thus infecting her.  Jay's unconscious body is discovered by a Mexican Good Samaritan, who slowly nurses him back to health. He returns to the burnt cabin and retrieves some money he had stashed away. His rescuer drives Jay to town and gives him a knife to "cut the balls off your enemy". He encounters a Texan delivering a horse, who offers Jay a ride in his car. Inside a cantina, Jay notices one of the thugs who had thrashed him; he follows him into the men's room and cuts his throat.  After a day on the road, the Texan, clearly ill, trades his horse to a wealthy man, who recognizes Jay from an afternoon at Tibey's estate. The friendly Texan dies in his car, apparently of tuberculosis.  At a motel, Jay runs across Amador, the brother-in-law of the Mexican Good Samaritan who had saved his life. Amador and his quiet friend, Ignacio, have their own issues with Tibey Mendez and are willing to help. They capture another of Tibey's henchmen, who tells them where Miryea can be found. Jay barges into the brothel to rescue her, only to find that she has been moved. No one but Tibey knows where she is.  Jay, Amador, and Ignacio ambush Tibey and his bodyguard on a trail. Jay is here for revenge, but first Tibey requests that Jay ask forgiveness for having stolen his wife. Jay lowers his gun and asks forgiveness.   Miryea is in a convent hospice, dying of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. Jay arrives in time to tell Miryea that he loves her. He then carries her outside, Miryea then tells Jay that she loves him; moments before she dies in his arms.  
RoboCop 2
  [[RoboCop|After the success of the RoboCop program]], Omni Consumer Products (OCP) has a new scheme to have Detroit completely [[Corporatocracy|under their control]]. They plan to have the city [[Default (finance)|default]] on its [[Detroit bankruptcy|debt]], then [[Foreclosure|foreclose]] on the entire city, taking over its government. They will then replace the old neighborhoods with a new city.  To rally public opinion behind urban redevelopment and Delta City construction, OCP sparks an increase in street crime. As Detroit Police Department is owned by OCP, they terminate police [[pension]] plans and cut salaries, triggering a police [[Strike action|strike]]. RoboCop, due to his directives, is unable to strike and remains on duty with his partner, Anne Lewis. The two raid a manufacturing plant of Nuke, a new [[designer drug]] that has been plaguing the streets of Detroit. RoboCop kills all the criminals, except for a young criminal named Hob, who shoots him and escapes.  Later Robocop watches his wife in front of the property and his wife sees him and later complains of harassment, he is told he can never have his old life back and to not bother her again, he tells her the same to spare her feelings effectively allowing his wife to move on.  Meanwhile, OCP struggles to develop "RoboCop 2", which is expected to be mass-produced and completely replace police officers. To their frustration, all the newly resurrected officers immediately commit suicide. Dr. Juliette Faxx, an unscrupulous psychologist, concludes that Alex Murphy's strong sense of duty and his moral objection to suicide due to his [[Catholicism|Irish Catholic]] religion were the reasons behind his ability to adapt to his resurrection as RoboCop. Faxx convinces the Old Man to let her control the project, this time using a criminal with a desire for power and immortality. Despite executive Don Johnson's objection, Faxx is allowed to proceed.  Nuke's distributor, the power-hungry Cain, feels threatened by the Delta City plan. He fears that he will lose his market if the city is redeveloped into a capitalistic utopia. He is assisted by his girlfriend Angie, Hob, Catzo, and Duffy, a corrupt police officer and Nuke addict. RoboCop tracks down Duffy and beats Cain's location out of him. He confronts Cain's gang at an abandoned construction site, but is overwhelmed. The criminals cut apart his body and dump the pieces in front of his precinct. Cain has Duffy vivisected for revealing their location, and forces Hob to watch.  RoboCop is repaired, but Faxx reprograms him with over 300 new directives, severely impeding his ability to perform his duties. One of his original technicians suggests that a massive electrical charge might [[reboot (computing)|reboot]] his system. RoboCop shocks himself with a high voltage transformer. The charge erases all of his directives, including the original ones, allowing his human brain (Murphy) to be in complete control. Murphy motivates the officers to aid him in raiding Cain's hideout. As Cain tries to escape, RoboCop intercepts and heavily wounds him. Hob escapes and takes control of Cain's drug empire. Believing she can control him with Nuke, Faxx selects Cain for the RoboCop 2 project, and puts his brain in a towering and heavily armed body.  Hob arranges a meeting with the Detroit mayor, saying that the mayor needs to institute a "hands off" policy towards Nuke. In exchange, Hob presents the mayor with a truckload of cash and gold in order to retire the city's debt to OCP, which would nullify the Delta City project. Threatened by this move, OCP sends RoboCop 2/Cain to the meeting to kill Hob. Cain slaughters everyone in sight, except for the mayor who manages to escape. He kills Angie by breaking her neck and fatally wounds Hob. As RoboCop arrives, Hob identifies the attacker and dies.  During the unveiling ceremony for Delta City and RoboCop 2, the Old Man presents a canister of Nuke as a symbol of the current crime wave. Seeing Nuke, Cain goes berserk and attacks the crowd. RoboCop arrives and fights Cain. The two battle throughout the building, and the fight eventually extends to the street. The police force arrives and engages Cain, who opens fire at officers and civilians alike. RoboCop recovers the Nuke canister and has Lewis give it to Cain, who stops fighting to administer the drug to himself. As Cain feels the drug's effect, RoboCop leaps onto his back, shoots through his armor and rips out his [[brain]]. He crushes the brain, ending Cain's rampage.  The Old Man decides to scapegoat Faxx to escape blame, and leaves. As Lewis complains that OCP is escaping accountability again, RoboCop insists they must be patient because "We're only human."  
Robot Jox
 Fifty years after a nuclear holocaust, mankind is decimated and the surviving nations - the western-influenced Market and the Russian-influenced Confederation - have agreed to outlaw traditional open war. In their place, disputes are settled with gladiator-style matches between [[Mecha|giant robots]] operated by pilots called "robot [[jockey|jox]]" who are contracted to fight ten matches.  The Confederation champion is Alexander ([[Paul Koslo]]), who has killed his last nine opponents thanks in part to a spy in the Market leaking information to the Confederation. The Market's champion, Achilles ([[Gary Graham]]) has won nine fights and will fight his final match against Alexander for the territory of [[Alaska]].  Achilles is supported by robot designer "Doc" Matsumoto ([[Danny Kamekona]]) and strategist Tex Conway (Michael Alldredge), the only jox to win all ten of his contract fights.  As Achilles gets the upper hand in the match, Alexander launches a rocket fist at him.  The projectile goes out of control and heads toward the bleachers.  Achilles intercepts the projectile but his robot takes the full force of the impact and is knocked into the crowd, killing over 300 people. The referees declare the match a draw and order a rematch, but Achilles, shaken by what happened, declares this was his contractual tenth match and announces his retirement. He goes to live with his brother Philip and his family, and finds he is publicly branded a traitor and a coward. Meanwhile, a new jox is chosen to face Alexander, a genetically engineered "gen jox" named Athena ([[Anne-Marie Johnson]]), who is the first female jox. Worried for Athena and attracted to her, Achilles returns to the Market and agrees to fight Alexander again, infuriating Athena.  As Achilles' robot is rebuilt, Matsumoto refuses to divulge any knowledge of its construction so it cannot be leaked by the spy, and Conway confides in Achilles he believes Matsumoto is the spy. Conway confronts Matsumoto in his office. Matsumoto reveals he has analyzed Conway's final fight and deduced that the "lucky" laser hit Conway claims allowed him to defeat a clearly superior opponent was in fact deliberately aimed; Matsumoto accuses Conway of being a Confederation agent. Conway confesses and shoots Matsumoto, who secretly records the deed as part of the mission briefing. Conway informs the Market leadership that Matsumoto was the spy. On the day of the fight Athena drugs Achilles and steals his jox suit to commandeer the robot. Unable to stop the fight once she takes the field, the Market decides to support her. While watching Matsumoto's briefing on the robot's new weaponry, the footage of Conway killing Matsumoto is played and Conway jumps down the robot's elevator shaft to his death.  Alexander takes the field against Athena and takes an early advantage, incapacitating her. The fight is declared in Alexander's favor and referees order him to stand down. Achilles arrives on the field and takes over the robot from Athena while Alexander smashes the referee hovercraft; the two jox stand to continue the fight. Alexander critically damages Achilles' robot, forcing him to flee for cover to an arm of Alexander's robot Athena sliced off earlier in the fight. Achilles hotwires the arm to launch its fist at Alexander, destroying his robot. Alexander emerges from the wreckage and the two battle with poles before Achilles finally convinces Alexander a match does not have to end with the death of a jock. Alexander throws down his weapon, and they salute each other with the jox's traditional "crash and burn" [[fist bump]].</ref>|group="Note"}}  
Rockula
 Ralph Lavie ([[Dean Cameron]]) is a friendly vampire. He's 400 years old and still lives with his mother, Phoebe ([[Toni Basil]]), who is also a vampire. Ralph is living under a curse. After meeting Mona, the girl of his dreams, 308 years ago Ralph lost her after she was killed by her jealous boyfriend, a pirate. Since that time Mona has been reincarnated every 22 years, only to fall in love with Ralph and die under exactly the same circumstances (killed on Halloween by a rhinestone-peg-legged pirate wielding a giant hambone). Ralph, weary of the whole thing, vows to stay locked in his room and not meet Mona again until after Halloween, much to the chagrin of his sentient and libidinous reflection (another side effect of the curse).  Ralph meets up with friends at a local bar (including rock legend [[Bo Diddley]]) and once again recounts the story of his curse to them. Walking out into the streets he is hit by a car being driven by none other than Mona's latest incarnation, a local singer (Tawny Fere). Immediately warning her off him Ralph runs off, but a portentous dream reinvigorates him to try and save her life now that events have been set in motion. He goes looking for her and discovers a flyer with her band playing at a local club. When he goes to visit her, the two hit it off immediately much to the dismay of Mona's manager/ex-boyfriend, an eccentric mortuary owner named Stanley ([[Thomas Dolby]]). After Ralph is unable to adequately say what he does for a living, he states that he's in a band. Realizing that he actually is a decent musician after hundreds of years of piano and guitar lessons, he and his friends start the band Rockula, playing up his vampirism as the band's gimmick. Rockula's first gig is a success and the band quickly becomes a hit. Ralph and Mona start dating and even start collaborating musically, writing songs and filming a video together. Stanley sees this as a threat and seeks the council of a local Psychic, Madame Ben-Wa who reveals that Ralph is a vampire. He begins a plot to kill Ralph and cryogenically freeze Mona using equipment from his mortuary so he'll have her forever.  Ralph and Mona have dinner with Phoebe and her latest beau, which proves awkward as Phoebe makes no secret of her unnaturally long life, referring to things such as George Washington's bedroom prowess and speaking to Mona as if she's known her for years. The evening culminates in an impromptu musical number by Phoebe. On the drive home, rather than have Mona think he and his mother are crazy, he reveals that he is a vampire and tells her the details of the curse. Mona is skeptical until Ralph half-transforms into a bat in front of her. Disturbed by this, Mona drives off and leaves town. Halloween comes and Rockula is scheduled to perform. Stanley appears, dressed as a pirate, with a hambone, having been directed to do so by Madame Ben-Wa. Mona, having admitted that she loves Ralph returns and meets him on stage, only to be kidnapped and carted away by Stanley, who prepares to place her in the cryogenic freezing chamber. Ralph's reflection tells him where to find Mona and he comes to the rescue. Stanley and Ralph duel with Stanley wielding the hambone and Ralph wielding the rhinestone peg-leg. Madame Ben-Wa is then revealed to be Phoebe, who has orchestrated the curse for years, scared that Ralph will leave the nest. Phoebe apologizes, realizing that she needs to let Ralph grow up, but is knocked out by Stanley. Ralph then again half-transforms into a bat, scaring Stanley into falling into his own freezing chamber. Having saved Mona's life the curse is broken, and the two leave the club together happily.  Ralph's reflection has had enough and smashes his way out of the mirror dressed as [[Elvis Presley]] in a rhinestone jumpsuit and performs a final number as Rockula.

Riverbend (film)
 Three rebellious African-American army officers disobey orders in Vietnam and refuse to destroy a village inhabited with innocent people. They are sent to Georgia and are going to be court-martialed. The officers know that justice will not be served and manage to escape. The fugitives end up in the small town of Riverbend, taking refuge in the home of a sympathetic widow. The town is controlled by a brutal, racist sheriff who kills those opposing him and takes whatever he wants from the terrified residents. This bothers one of the officers who, with plans to take down the sheriff, convinces the others to help him create a secret training camp in the woods. They then begin recruiting the local African-Americans men and training them for combat. When they are prepared, the angry rebels take over the town, incarcerate the sheriff and all his cohorts and hold the rest of the town hostage in a church until their demands for media attention and an end to racism are met.  
Rocky V
  Shortly after [[Rocky Balboa]]'s victory over [[Ivan Drago]] in Moscow, he, his wife [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian]], his brother-in-law Paulie, and his trainer Tony "Duke" Evers, return to the United States, where they are greeted by Rocky's son, Robert. At a press conference, boxing promoter George Washington Duke attempts to goad Rocky into fighting his boxer, Union Cane, who is now the top-rated challenger, but Rocky declines the offer. Duke refuses to give up on the huge payday fight with Balboa and surmises he needs to come up with an angle to convince him to fight.    After returning home, it is discovered that Paulie unknowingly had Rocky sign a "[[power of attorney]]" over to Rocky's accountant, who had squandered all of his money on [[real estate]] deals gone sour; in addition, the accountant had failed to pay Rocky's [[Income tax|taxes]] over the previous six years, and his mansion had been mortgaged by $400,000. His lawyer confirms this, but tells Rocky that it is fixable with a few more fights. Unwilling to go bankrupt, Rocky decides to accept the mega fight with Cane. After seeing a doctor, however, he is diagnosed with permanent [[brain damage]]. Adrian convinces him to retire, which he reluctantly accepts. Adrian returns to working part-time at the J&M Tropical Fish pet store. Rocky plans to reopen Mighty Mick's Boxing Gym, willed to his son Robert by his late trainer Mickey Goldmill. He walks through the vacant gym and reminisces about a training session between the two just before Rocky fought the rematch against Apollo Creed years before.  One day, Rocky and Paulie meet a young fighter from Oklahoma named Tommy Gunn, and Rocky takes him under his wing. Training the young fighter gives Rocky a sense of purpose, and Gunn rises to become a top contender. Rocky becomes so distracted with Gunn's training that he ends up neglecting Robert, who is being bullied at school. After learning to defend himself, he falls in with the wrong crowd and becomes withdrawn and angry toward his family.  Union Cane wins the vacant world heavyweight title, while Gunn continues rising through the ranks. Still wanting to do business with Rocky, Duke sees Gunn's knockout streak and relationship with Rocky as a way of gaining control of him. Duke showers Gunn with luxuries and promises him that he is the only path to a shot against Union Cane for the title. Duke hopes to take control of Gunn as his manager and keep Rocky on as head trainer.   On Christmas Eve, Duke visits the Balboa house with Gunn to explain the new scenario, which would financially benefit all of them. However, Rocky insists dealing with Duke will end badly and is dirty business. Gunn drives off in a huff, leaving Rocky for good. Adrian attempts to comfort Rocky, but his frustration boils over. He confesses his life had meaning again when he was able to live vicariously through Gunn's success. She reasons with him, telling him Tommy never had his heart and spirit—something he could never learn. When this realization hits him, Rocky embraces his wife and they begin to pick up the pieces. After finding Robert hanging out on a street corner, Rocky apologizes to his son and they mend their broken relationship.  Gunn fights Cane for the heavyweight title as Rocky watches on television, still rooting for his protégé. Gunn wins the fight with a first round knockout but is jeered by spectators for leaving Rocky and hounded by reporters after the fight. They insist that Cane was nothing but a "paper champion", because Cane did not [[Lineal championship|win the title from Balboa]]. They claim he will never be the real champion unless he fights a worthy opponent, like Rocky; they drive the point home when one reporter announces, "...he's no Rocky Balboa!" With Gunn incensed by the press's reaction, Duke convinces him that he needs to secure a title fight with Rocky to refute the notion that he is not the real champion. Duke and Gunn show up at the local bar with a live television crew to goad Rocky into accepting a title fight. Rocky declines and tries to reason with him, but Gunn rebukes it and calls him weak, prompting Paulie to stand up for Rocky. When Gunn attacks Paulie, Rocky accepts the challenge, but tells him "my ring is outside."  Despite Duke's warnings to keep the fight in the ring, Gunn accepts. During the fight, Rocky is seemingly beaten down before he hears the voice of Mickey urging him to get up and continue the fight, to go just "one more round." Rocky gets up and, with Robert, Paulie, and the entire neighborhood cheering him on, utilizes his vast street fighting knowledge to defeat his former protégé. While Gunn is escorted away by the police, Duke threatens to sue Rocky if he touches him. After a brief hesitation, Rocky knocks him onto the hood of a car and quips, "Sue me for what?"  The next morning, Rocky and Robert explore the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], and Rocky gives his son [[Rocky Marciano]]'s cufflink, given to him years ago as a gift from Mickey. The film ends with a shot of Rocky's statue looking out over the Philadelphia skyline.  
The Rookie (1990 film)
 Nick Pulovski (Eastwood) and his partner, Powell (Williams), are assigned to the case of taking down the criminal empire of a German felon, Strom (Julia), who engages in grand theft auto for his chop shop operations. During an encounter with Strom and his men, who are loading a semi-trailer truck with stolen cars, Powell is shot dead by Strom. Nick, despite efforts to catch the criminals on the highway, ends up losing them and is subsequently taken off the case by his superior Lt. Raymond Garcia (Serna), who assigns him a new partner, David Ackerman (Sheen), a rookie cop only recently promoted to detective.  Against orders, Nick continues investigating Strom's gang and dealing with David's lack of experience, particularly a bar brawl during which David's badge is stolen by one of Strom's men, Loco. While attending the birthday party of David's mother, Nick meets David's wealthy father, Eugene (Skerritt), who attempts to bribe Nick to protect David no matter what. Nick threatens one of Strom's men, Morales, into helping him. He manages to plant a two-way radio inside Strom's house, but he is found out and killed by Strom and his lover, Liesl (Braga). While listening in on Strom's plans to flee the country, Nick and David ambush Strom at a casino, but David botches the operation when he cannot bring himself to shoot Liesl. He is shot in the back, but survives with his bulletproof vest, while Strom takes Nick hostage and demands a $2 million ransom.  Haunted by causing his little brother's death during their childhood and by his failure to help Nick, David overcomes his fears and goes on a brutal rampage, interrogating as many as Strom's associates as possible. He finds another of Strom's men, Little Felix, garroted to death in his own shop, and barely escapes the same fate by Loco, who escapes before David can subdue him. In desperation, David approaches his father to supply the ransom money in case he fails. David calls his girlfriend, Sarah, who tells him that Garcia is waiting to speak to him at their home, but detectives sent by Garcia intercept David for police brutality. Realizing that Loco is posing as Garcia, David escapes and races home to intercept Loco before he kills Sarah. They clash violently until Sarah shoots Loco dead. Though David needed Loco alive, Loco's car directs him to a garage where he and Nick had previously seen it.  At Strom's garage, Nick manages to free himself and attempts to escape but is cornered by Strom and Liesl. David arrives and chases them off, and they barely escape the garage before Strom detonates the explosives inside it. Catching Strom's contact sent to collect the money, Nick and David reach Strom at the airport and a long chase ensues. Strom's pilot is shot in the head, causing him to crash into another plane, while Nick and David pursue Strom and Liesl into the airport. David shoots and kills Liesl, while Nick runs out of bullets and is shot by Strom. David shoots Strom in the shoulder while Strom shoots David in the leg. Heedless to Strom's request for medical aid, Nick kills Strom with a gunshot to the head.  Sometime later, Nick, David and Garcia have been promoted. As the new lieutenant, Nick assigns David another rookie partner, Heather Torres.  
The Rogue Stallion
 Anna Peterson ([[Beth Buchanan]]) loves horses, and the fact that her father John Peterson ([[Bruno Lawrence]]) works at a racetrack in Sydney, Australia only adds to her enthusiasm. One night at dinner, her father announces that after the success of one of the stable's horses in a prominent trophy race, his boss gave the employees a bonus large enough for the Peterson family to go back to her father's ancestral home in New Zealand. Tragically the following day, there is an accident at the stables and John is killed. With nothing left to keep them in Australia, Anna's mother Rose ([[Michele Fawdon]]) decides to follow through on her husband's dream and moves Anna and her younger brother Mike (Andrew Shepherd) to Charlton, New Zealand.  Upon arrival, however, they find things are not quite what they expected. First, they are run off the road by Mr. Garrett (Peter McAllum), a prominent local horse breeder obsessed with hunting a beautiful brown wild stallion, as he and his men are in pursuit. Next, after walking several miles to their father's family homestead, they discover it has fallen into disrepair and is barely livable. The night they arrive, Anna hears the wild horse out in the woods behind the house and frees it from loose wire in which it had been caught. Before she can persuade the horse to come home with her, a mysterious man appears and frightens the horse away.  Meanwhile, a local shop owner Mr. Peabody (John Watson), who met the Petersons on their way into town and who seems aware of a connection between them and Mr. Garrett, informs his friend of their arrival. Garrett's three teenage children Tony ([[Dean O'Gorman]]), Ginny ([[Jodie Rimmer]]), and Wayne ([[Brian Rooney (actor)|Brian Rooney]]) overhear the conversation and discuss the rumour that John Peterson killed one of Mr. Garrett's best mares years before, explaining his cold behavior towards John's wife and children. Ginny warns the caring Wayne that he "best not get friendly with them, if you know what's good for you."  The next day, Jean Bailey ([[Beaver (singer)|Beaver]]) arrives at the homestead to offer her various services, including veterinary services, if the family plans on keeping horses. Rose declines, but invites Jean to stay for coffee, during which Jean tells Rose about the feud between her husband and Garrett. She also offers to tow their stranded car. Anna volunteers to show her where the car was run off the road. On the way, Jean Bailey invites Anna to join the local Pony Club, and they discuss the wild horse. Later, while Anna's mother runs into town for house supplies, she and Mike sneak off to check out the Pony Club in spite Rose's expressed wishes. Rose doesn't want her children around horses out of fear that they'll get hurt. Anna gets into a tiff with Garrett after he attempts to whip his prize horse, Eclipse, which threw his daughter Ginny during competition.  Anna and Mike start school the following day, and find themselves the targets of a band of bullies, led by Tony and Ginny. Only Wayne goes out of his way to befriend Anna, telling her about Old Gonzalez ([[José María Caffarel|Jose Maria Caffarel]]), the mysterious man she had seen in the woods, a supposed murderer who lives in the wild. After an incident on the bus, Jean Bailey, who is also the bus driver, threatens to tell the school principal and get Ginny and Tony in detention after school, causing them to miss Pony Club. Ginny plots revenge by inviting Anna and Mike to ride Eclipse after school. During Anna's turn, Tony and his friends throw stones at Eclipse, causing the horse to bolt. When Anna loses control and is thrown, Eclipse runs off into the woods, and Ginny and Tony jeeringly tell Anna to go back home to Australia. Dejected, Anna runs off after Eclipse.  In the woods, she finds the wild stallion who leads her to Eclipse, now stuck in a bog. After being saved from falling into a large trap Garrett's men dug throughout the woods by Old Gonzalez, Anna and the old man pull Eclipse out with the help of the stallion, called Wild Fire (Fuego Savaje) by Gonzalez. In contrast to Gonzalez's murderous reputation, he takes Anna to his remote animal sanctuary to rest and to check Eclipse for injuries.  In the meantime, Ginny and Tony claim that Anna has stolen the horse, fueling Garrett's determination to buy the Peterson homestead and send Anna's family back to Australia. Wayne is revealed to be friends with Gonzalez when he runs into Anna in the woods on his way to ask Gonzalez's help to find her. Wayne apologizes on behalf of his siblings, who he states only bullied her to get on the right side of their father, and explains his complicity in perpetuating rumours of Gonzalez's reputation as a murderer. He also tells her of his own horse riding accident during which he was injured while trying a difficult jump at his father's urging, resulting in his current limp.  Before Wayne and Anna escort Eclipse back to town, Gonzalez tells Anna and Wayne the real story of the fight between Garrett and Anna's father. John had worked for Garrett's father as an assistant trainer on his horse farm. John had a way with horses and unlike Garrett who is very rough with them. One day, Anna's father found Garrett whipping the prize stallion, slated to win the Melbourne Cup race. After an altercation, Garrett tried to persuade his father to fire John, but he refused to fire such a skilled trainer and risk losing the race. One morning some time later, both John and the horse went missing. John later claimed the stable door had been left open and the horse had wandered off. It fell in a gully and broke two legs, ruining any hope of winning the race. Garrett claimed John had tried to steal the horse, and this time his father fired John and told him to "get out of town." Gonzalez sends them off to take Eclipse back with instructions that she cannot be ridden for a minimum of two days.  As Anna and Wayne stroll back to town with Eclipse, they hear cries for help. Mike, who had gone off on his own to find his missing sister, fell into one of Garrett's horse traps and is seriously injured. Wildfire allows Anna to ride him into town to fetch help. Mike is taken to the hospital, where Rose declares that, in light of the unwelcoming community and the severity of Mike's injuries, they must go home to Australia. While Rose stays with Mike, Jean tries to drum up support for the family in town, encouraging everyone to stand up to Garrett. Anna goes back to Gonzalez's home to say goodbye to Wildfire, but Garrett has followed her and plans to shoot the horse, chasing it through the woods to the edge of a cliff where Wildfire leaps into the rapids, presumably dead. Gonzalez accuses him of leaving the stable door open all those years ago, declares that rather than leading the horse away John Peterson had been tracking it, and chastises Garrett for his arrogance which has caused so much hurt to those around him.  After Mike encourages his mom to not go back to Australia the family decides to stay. The community finally rallies around them, forming a working bee to fix up the house, and refusing to be intimidated by Garrett anymore. Wayne shows up riding a horse, having regained his confidence, and invites Anna to come riding with him. When she protests she has no horse, he indicates Wildfire, still alive, at the edge of the woods, and the two ride together through the hills surrounding the homestead.<ref name="scott">Ed.

Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (film)
 The film, like the play, focuses on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and their actions (or lack thereof) within the play of ''Hamlet''. The film begins as they travel on horseback to [[Elsinore]], contemplating fate, memory and language. Rosencrantz finds and continually flips a coin which always comes up heads, causing Guildenstern to conclude that something is wrong with reality. They meet a travelling troupe of tragedians on the way, and during their conversation with the lead Player, they are mysteriously transported into the action of ''Hamlet'' at Elsinore. They wander around the castle, trying to catch up to the action and understand what is going on by listening to other parts of the play. They are asked by the Danish royal couple to stay awhile in order to help find out the cause of, and hopefully cure, Prince Hamlet's gloomy state. They spend their time outside the scenes in ''Hamlet'' trying to figure out what is wrong with the prince and what is required of them.  The remainder of the play follows the [[Shakespeare]]an drama whenever the two characters are "on stage", while the title heroes remain largely occupied with the futile hazards of daily life whenever the "main action" is elsewhere. Soon the very same theatre troupe arrives to perform at court, as part of the Bard's tragedy. The Player simultaneously castigates them for abandoning their real play on the road, which cannot exist without an audience, and explains some of the plot and logic of conventional rules of plot-staging and -writing.  Ultimately, they are sent to England and outside the action of the play again. The final part takes place on the ship to England, where they read the letter they are to deliver with Hamlet – discovering that it is an order for his death. They decide to pretend they never saw it. Hamlet replaces the letter, and (as described in Shakespeare's play) escapes on an attacking pirate ship. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern worry about what they are to do now that Hamlet is gone, unaware that Hamlet has altered the letter so that it calls for their death rather than his own. The Player finishes the action by reading the letter that sentences them to death. Guildenstern, still trying to struggle against destiny, stabs The Player with The Player's own dagger, only to find that the weapon is a theatrical prop. Scenes of the deaths of Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet are shown, and both [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]], finally accepting their fate, are hanged. The film ends with the tragedians packing up their cart and continuing on their way.  
The Russia House (film)
  Bartholomew "Barley" Scott-Blair ([[Sean Connery]]), the head of a British publishing firm, is on a business trip to [[Moscow]]. He attends a writers' retreat near [[Peredelkino]] where he speaks of an end to tensions with the West. Attentively listening is a mysterious man called "Dante" ([[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]).  Dante later demands from Barley a promise to do the right thing if the opportunity arises.  A few months later, unable to locate Barley at a trade show, a beautiful young Soviet woman named Katya Orlova ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) asks publisher Nicky Landau ([[Nicholas Woodeson]]) to give Barley an important manuscript in her possession. Landau sneaks a look at the manuscript and delivers it to British government authorities.   The manuscript is a document detailing the [[Soviet Union]]'s capability for waging nuclear war.  An investigation reveals "Dante" is in fact renowned Soviet physicist Yakov Saveleyev and the author of the manuscript.  British intelligence officers  track Barley to his holiday flat in Lisbon, Portugal and interrogate him as to how he knows Katya. They realize he is as much in the dark as they are.  MI6 realizes that the manuscript is also of vital importance to the American CIA, with both agencies wanting Barley to work on their behalf.  British agent Ned ([[James Fox]]) then gives Barley some fundamental training as a spy.  Barley returns to the Soviet Union to seek out Dante/Yakov and confirm he is a genuine informant.  He meets with Katya, with whom he is instantly smitten. Through her, he confirms that Dante is indeed the brilliant scientist Saveleyev.  Barley also denies to Katya that he is a spy.  The British run the operation through its first phase while apprising the CIA of its results. The CIA team, headed by Russell ([[Roy Scheider]]), is worried because the manuscript states that the Soviet nuclear missile programme is in complete disarray, which suggests the United States has engaged in a useless arms race.  Katya sets up a meeting with Dante, going to great lengths to avoid being followed. Barley explains that the manuscript is now in the hands of British and American authorities. Yakov feels betrayed, but Barley convinces him that the manuscript can still be published.  Dante gives Barley another volume of the manuscript after Barley assures him that he's sympathetic to the scientist's cause.  Impressed by the additional volume, Russell's boss Brady ([[John Mahoney]]) and U.S. military officer Quinn ([[J. T. Walsh]]) interrogate Barley to be certain where his loyalties lie. Russell states he would help the British operation out of a true ideological belief in ''Glasnost'', although this would not be good news to his 'customers' of the weapons industry, who need an arms race for continued prosperity.  Convinced that Dante's manuscripts are truthful, the CIA and MI6 come up with a "shopping list" of questions which is meant to extract as much strategic warfare information as Dante can provide. "Russia House" handler Ned senses something is amiss with Barley but the British-American team continues with its plans.  Barley returns to Russia and declares his love to Katya and admits he is an operative. Katya confesses that Yakov is not acting like himself and fears he may be under [[KGB]] observation or control.  She gives Barley the address where Yakov will be staying when he is in Moscow.  Barley is under full British-American surveillance as he takes the shopping list to Yakov's apartment. Ned suddenly concludes that the Soviets know all about the operation and that they only let it run because they want to steal the 'shopping list' to learn exactly what the British and Americans know.  Ned is now convinced that Barley has made a deal to turn over the questions to the USSR. Russell disagrees and instructs the assignment to proceed as planned.  The British-American team expects the meeting with Yakov to last a short time, but when Barley doesn't return after seven hours, Russell admits he was wrong. The team must now pretend the questions were deliberately false.  Barley, meanwhile, sends a note to Ned explaining that during a pre-arranged phone call to Katya, Dante used a code word to let her know that he had been compromised by the KGB and that her life is in danger. Barley admits he traded the shopping list to the Russians in exchange for the safety and freedom of Katya and her family.  He admits that his actions might be unfair, but tells Ned, "you shouldn't open other people's letters."  Barley returns to his flat in [[Lisbon]], where he waits for Katya and her family to begin a new life with him.

But while they reach the mandir and camp there, many untoward events happen and many of their friends are ruthlessly killed by the Shaitaan. It happens as mostly the boys and girls venture into his lair in the dark, quite unwittingly losing their way. Once the devil even kidnaps Anju on her wedding night as she is bathing, and Lalbai wounds her with a metal pole. Shaitaan gets some of Anju's blood. As Deepak and friends reach there and rescue Anju, they even realise that for now thanks to Lalbai, Shaitaan has become strong enough to be able to leave his lair for a short time. Shaitaan even tracks them down to the stone fortress and attacks the girls there, but is unable to harm them as baba again saves them in the nick of time.  Kanwaljit, whose only sister also became one of Lalbai's sacrifice victims, helps them in all ways, but is later killed by Lalbai. Even when baba goes to fight with Lalbai, she weakens his powers by harming his body with a poison and he succumbs to the attack. Due to the chaos in the village, the townsfolk and few eve teasers realise that the girl who got married in the mandir must be offered to the devil in order to quieten him and stop all the carnage. The final confrontation occurs near the village square. People surround the mandir and after taking Anju hostage, tie her to a pillar, to be used as bait for Shaitan. As the growling Shaitan gleefully steps up to exact his vengeance, Deepak breaks free and attacks Shaitan. Shaitan fends him off with a powerful blow that pitches Deepak away. Deepak snatches a ''trishul'' (holy trident of Kali), which he finds at the altar. He discovers it repels Shaitan, and ultimately drives it into Shaitan. The powers of Kali, channeled through the ''trishul'', destroy Shaitan and bury him deep into the ground forever. The entire village is relieved by the devil's destruction and is blessed with Matarani's power for ever.

Shiva (1990 film)
 The film opens to a classroom in a (fictional) VAS college of Arts & Sciences. After the classes, upon the directions of a college student JD ([[J.D Chakravarthy|JD Chakravarthy]]), a bunch of goons led by Ganesh savagely assaults a group of students right outside the college gate. It's later made clear that JD was settling some campus scores and that the incident resulted in at least one student leaving the college, deepening the fear for JD in the campus.  It turns out that JD is the (unopposed) president of the college students' union and the leader of a notorious campus gang, powerful enough to prevent the college Principal from taking disciplinary actions against their unsavory conduct, which includes eve-teasing and insulting professors. JD's connections, through Ganesh, reaches a gangster named Bhavani Chaudhury ([[Raghuvaran]]), whose criminal network lends muscle to a local politician Tilak Dhari ([[Paresh Rawal]]).  Shiva ([[Akkineni Nagarjuna|Nagarjuna]]) is a new student at college. He joins a small group of friends including Prakash ([[Raj Zutshi]]) and Asha ([[Amala (actress)|Amala]]). Shiva's confident gait and tough attitude leads to JD locking horns with him. An inevitable fight ensues, in which Shiva and friends beat up JD's gang, in broad daylight within the campus. Emboldened by the incident, Shiva's friends plan to fight the students' union elections. Shiva proposes the nerdy friend Naresh ([[Jagan]]) to stand for president-ship. He also rebuffs Ganesh's initial warning to stay out of politics.  When Ganesh attempts to use force, Shiva beats him back too. The matter comes before Bhavani. Bhavani is mildly annoyed, but he studies Shiva as a potential replacement for JD. At his behest, Naresh is assaulted and rendered unable to run. At this point, Shiva accepts the nomination and decides to run.  Meanwhile, Bhavani has other troubles. He refuses to side with a worker's union leader Krishna Rao ([[Ajit Vachani]]). Krishna Rao takes his plight to Shiva; Shiva agrees to help in return for muscle, and Krishna Reddy provides this by calling upon the workers. Around this time, Asha expresses a romantic interest in Shiva. The friendship progresses and they eventually marry.  The stage is now set. Bhavani launches a set of sniper attacks on those close to Shiva. Shiva retaliates in kind and takes out many of Bhavani's leaders. Tilak Dhari notices that Shiva is launching a fitting response to Bhavani and decides to stop supporting Bhavani. Angered, humiliated and defeated, Bhavani strikes Shiva's home.  A final fight ensues in which eventually, Shiva manages to kill Bhavani, ridding the city of one of its most terrifying anti-social elements, while personally coming to terms with the fact that his wife is killed by the Bhavani gang, in the bargain.  
Shipwrecked (1990 film)
 Haakon Haakonsen (Stian Smestad), a young Norwegian boy in the 1850s, becomes the sole support of his family as a [[cabin boy]] on a ship after his father is injured. Jens ([[Trond Peter Stamsø Munch]]), a family friend and a fellow shipmate of Haakon’s father, becomes an older brother to Haakon on their voyage.  At first, Haakon has a difficult time adjusting to life at sea, but eventually earns the respect of his shipmates while earning the distrust of the first mate, supposedly known as Howell - after Haakon catches the first mate with weapons he shouldn't have. The first mate forces him to promise not to reveal to the captain about the guns, and then keeps tabs on Haakon.  Haakon even discovers a female [[stowaway]] (Louisa Milwood-Haigh) who turns into a [[love interest]]. After the mysterious death of the admired [[captain (nautical)|captain]] (who may have been poisoned by the first mate), a suspicious new batch of sailors come on board immediately after Howell's promotion to the top spot. Work onboard ship soon becomes terrible for Haakon, Jens, and the original sailors, which intensifies when the new captain finds Mary (the stowaway girl trying to reach her uncle in [[Calcutta]]) and demands whomever has been fraternizing with her to show his face. Haakon admits responsibility, and the captain sentences him to be lashed with the [[cat o'nine tails]]. Jens protests, saying that whipping Haakon would be an effective death penalty, to which Howell orders that Jens will be punished instead. However, before anyone can be flogged, the court martial is interrupted by a terrible [[storm]] that damages the mainmast, then sinks the ship. Haakon takes advantage of this to escape the doomed ship and wakes up on a deserted [[tropical]] island.  After searching the island, Haakon discovers treasure as well as [[wanted poster]]s for an English pirate named Merrick, who looks identical to Howell. (In the first scene of the film, the real Howell was murdered by Merrick, who then stole the identity as a [[doppelganger]]). Haakon discovers that the suspicious shipmates (a.k.a. the new batch of abusive shipmates who were brought on after Merrick's captaincy) are really [[piracy|pirates]], who arguably stored the treasure during a hot pursuit from naval forces, and will soon return to the island to extract their loot.  Following a self-training with a sword and gun, Haakon even manages to use a horn when a [[gorilla]] attacks. This makes the gorilla docile, who then starts to befriend Haakon, behaving like a pet. Although Haakon adjusts to the island, he misses Jens, and more so his family back in Norway. One day, Haakon sees smoke from a distant island and tries various attempts to get there on a raft of his own.  Upon successfully arriving there, he finds a bunch of [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] doing a night dance. Haakon eventually finds Mary with a bunch of traveling natives. When he sees one of the natives dragging Mary, Haakon springs into action frightening the natives with a gunshot until he backs into Jens, who explains that the natives are peaceful and saved his and Mary's lives.  Mary explains that they have been traveling island to island looking for Haakon. As the three leave for Haakon's island the next day, Haakon realizes that the pirates are returning to the island. Haakon and Jens managed to get help from Berg and Steine (Knut Walle and Harald Brenna), two of Jens' friends who also survived the sinking ship. Haakon manages to outsmart the pirates and he, Jens, Berg, and Steine return to their native Norway. Each man kept a small share of the treasure, with Haakon deciding to use his share to help his impoverished family.  Back home in Norway, Haakon reunites with his family and introduces them to Mary. His parents agree to take her in until she can reestablish contact with her own relatives.

Kit finds herself disoriented in the local marketplace and is set upon by a mob. She is eventually found, mute and almost insane, in a Catholic mission hospital by staff of the American embassy, who have been prompted to search for her by Tunner, who has found Port's grave. She is transported back to Tangier, and is told that Tunner is waiting for her there. After arriving at the hotel, Kit flees into the city before Tunner can meet her.

When a woman is discovered dead on the sidewalk, half-burned into ashes in an apparent case of the [[spontaneous human combustion]], Kim decides to pursue the story on her own without Eli's approval. While investigating, she crosses paths with Fima, a used bookstore proprietor whose shop is in the building the woman jumped from. As a gift, Fima offers Kim a book on feminism and the [[occult]].   On [[Christmas Eve]], Kim spends the evening with Hank's family, who recurrently make snide remarks about Kim being Jewish. Later at her apartment, Kim begins reading the book Fima gave to her, and finds a chapter on "The Fire of [[Lilith]]" depicting a woman engulfed in flames. The next day, Kim arrives at a picnic Fima invited her to, where she meets Katherine Harrison, a self-described old crone, and the young Jane Yanana. They tell her about Lilith, [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife and the "spirit of all that crawls."  At the ''Eye'', Eli, instead of being angry about Kim missing work, lets her officially have the spontaneous combustion story. That afternoon, Kim decides to visit Fima's apartment to ask her more questions. Fima serves her a cup of tea, which makes Kim nauseated. Fima tells Kim of her daughter Lilith. Fima offers her a date and demands that Kim eat it. She does, even though it looks like a roach in her hand. Soon after, Kim passes out.  She wakes up surrounded by Jane, Fima, Katherine, and Li. They perform a ritual on Kim: Ricky and Fima slice open a live rat over her, and insert a giant larva into Kim's vagina. It emerges from her mouth as a full-grown, giant, multi-segmented roach; she vomits the creature out. Ricky slices the creature in half and drips its innards onto Kim's face. Kim wakes up later fully dressed, still in Fima's apartment. She rushes home, terrified, and finds Hank, who is able to calm her. Ricky then enters the apartment and stabs Hank to death. Kim manages to answer her ringing phone during the fight and screams for her co-worker Janice to help her. Ricky captures Kim and binds her. Janice arrives, but doesn't help Kim. Instead, she admonishes Ricky for the mess and tells him to take Kim straight to Fima.  Ricky locks Kim in the meat locker at a meat shop next-door to Fima's bookstore where she passes out again. When she awakens, she is surrounded by the entire [[cult]]. Ricky, wearing a [[Phallus|phallic]] mask, rapes Kim. Kim reawakens alone in the meat locker; her fingers bind themselves together in a knot. Then she experiences incredible pain as her legs bind together into an insect-like tail. Kim passes out again. She awakens in the meat locker as Jo opens the door. He frees her legs from a brittle cocoon-like substance and covers her as best as he can. Jo tells her that she has been initiated and that she should go.  Kim brings a policeman, Detective Burt, to her apartment. There, everything is spotless and there's no trace of Hank's body. At her office's Christmas party, Eli claims that Hank is away on an assignment. Janice is there, and welcomes her to the family. Furious and confused, Kim storms out of the office and walks down onto the sidewalk. She notices Ricky following her and ducks into a motel room. Her feet begin to get painfully hot. She jumps into the shower, but they still burst into tiny flames. Ricky enters the room and, in pain, Kim agrees to kidnap Hank's teenaged brother Lonnie to complete the initiation. Kim lures Lonnie out of his house, and Ricky murders Hank's parents by strangling them with Christmas lights, then setting the house on fire.  On the building roof, Kim is asked to stab Lonnie; instead, she stabs Fima. In anger, Fima pulls the knife from her stomach and stabs Ricky. A giant larva feeds on the wounded man as Kim's legs begin to get hot. Kim's hands knot themselves together once again, then they start to burst into flame. Kim then stabs her fused hands into Fima's wound. This transfers the curse of Lilith to Fima, and Fima dives off the roof just as her daughter had.  
Silent Scream (1990 film)
 Based on a true story. Larry Winters was sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder in a [[Soho]] bar in [[London]] in 1963. Silent Scream, directed by [[David Hayman]] and starring [[Iain Glen]] as Winters, is based on the life and writing of Winters. A violent and drug addicted member of the [[Barlinnie]] Special Unit in [[Scotland]], Larry died in 1977 of a drug overdose at the age of 34.  The film is composed of flashbacks into his younger life as a soldier in the parachute regiment and his childhood in [[Glasgow]] and [[Carbisdale Castle|Carbisdale]]. The memories are triggered by drugs and isolation.  Since the film deals primarily with the convict Winters, the viewer experiences his memories to the fullest. His life as a child, in which he is encouraged by his brother to do wrong, is captured in beautiful nostalgia. His life as a young man is beset with problems.  The encouragement from his older brother is clearly the cause of his dysfunction. Together the two commit crimes including robbery, breaking and entering, shooting and fighting. His older brother Don (played by [[Jamie Morton]]) almost shoots Larry in the head by accident while playing with a [[World War II]] [[rifle]] stolen previously by Don. The childhood holidays in Carbisdale are fundamental to the biography of Winters. In his own writing he describes the times as his most peaceful. The adventures of the two boys feature heavily in the film.  His life in the Parachute regiment is captured with gritty realism. Content with messing about in the military, Winters soon becomes disenchanted with the army, takes part in a brutal beating of another soldier and goes [[AWOL]]. Before running off, the viewer witnesses his indecision to take the gun his older brother gave him. The gun which sent him to prison. His own internal battle with right and wrong is what drives the film. It becomes clear that he is gifted but unstable. A writer of poetry, Winters own work gave the film its name.  His memories of childhood are frequent but one stands out above the others. The two boys are being attacked by a [[Glasgow]] gang and Larry is cornered. His brother Don steps in to save him and gives Larry a glass bottle to fight with. Larry smashes it over the head of his adversary. This represents the beginning of his violence. Later, the two boys break into a mansion house and his brother Don finds a gun and some bullets. They run off and hide in the woods where they begin to play with the weapon. Don loads it and almost shoots Larry in the head.  Years later, after several years in prison, Larry has a home visit. Meeting with his older brother (now played by [[Alexander Morton]]) and his mother in the family home is one of the most upsetting recurring themes of the film.  
Silent Gunpowder
 Based on a [[novel]] by [[Branko Ćopić]] and set during [[World War II]], the film tells the story of a [[Serbs|Serbian]] village in the mountains of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and its villagers who found themselves divided along two opposing [[ideology|ideological]] lines, represented by the [[Chetniks]] and the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. These two opposing sides are personified in the Partisan commander ''Španac'' ([[Mustafa Nadarević]]) and a former [[Royal Yugoslav Army|Royal Army]] officer ''Radekić'' ([[Branislav Lečić]]). ''Španac'' sees Radekić as the cause of villagers' resistance to the new, [[Communist]], ideology and so the main plot axis is the conflict between them.  
Silence = Death
 This film explores the reactions and response of New York City's artistic community to the ravages of the AIDS epidemic and other issues of [[homosexuality]]. Activist interview include representatives from the many arts organizations that have alerted the public to the crisis through performance art, music, theater and literature. Even with the gentler voices, the film’s undercurrent is an angry demand for action and recognition.  Artist [[David Wojnarowicz]] appears shaking with anger as he confronts the diseased society that has turned its back on him and all other AIDS victims. He reads several angry tirades and provides experimental film material and paintings. Painter [[Rafael Gamba]] provides a vengeful indictment of homophobic bigotry.  Other segments include [[Keith Haring]]. He is seen working on a complicated [[erotic]] [[mural]], commenting that the painting is "about nostalgia. It's not about anything that could happen now". Haring shares his nostalgic longing for the days of [[casual sex|carefree sex]]. He died from AIDS-related complications on February 16, 1990, three months before the movie was released on May 4, which would have been his 32nd birthday.  [[Allen Ginsberg]]'s segment muses on sexual experimentation and attitudes, and declares that the planet itself has AIDS.  
Singapore Sling (1990 film)
 Two mentally ill women who are clearly suffering from not otherwise specified delusional disorders, a mother and a (grown) daughter, live together in a secluded mansion. They are in a relationship and both are recognised for their beauty. They spend their days playing perverse [[BDSM]]-related incestuous games in memory of their [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] patriarch who, when he was still alive, raped his daughter when she was eleven, murdered several servants, and is now a mummified corpse with which the daughter is shown having sex. They occasionally kill their servants and bury their bodies in the garden.  When first glimpsed the psychotic mother-daughter protagonists, half-dressed, are burying their disemboweled chauffeur in a pit they have just finished to dig in their backyard on a dark and stormy night under the thunder and heavy rain. They lay a shovel and drag out of the bushes his fresh corpse, put to death in one of their usual games combining incestuous sex with murder. Shortly after this and at first unnoticed by the two women a lovesick detective pulls his car up to the residence, suffering from a painful bullet wound and an equally painful yearning to track down Laura, his long-missing beloved for whom he has been searching for three years and about whom it is known that she has visited the area. What he does not know is that he has stumbled onto the lair of two profoundly insane women who have already lured Laura into their home and brutally killed her (in the process decorating their kitchen with her viscera, as a flashback helpfully shows). It is also revealed that the daughter is physically very similar to Laura and is desperately looking for a man's companionship. The film's protagonist's search for a woman named Laura is a direct reference to the classic [[film noir]] ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]) by American director [[Otto Preminger]]. The film uses as background music, in addition to classical music by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] and [[Giaches de Wert]], the compositions used by [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Julie London]] in ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]).  The duo then easily take the seriously wounded and bleeding detective, having already figured them out to be responsible for Laura's kidnapping, into their home, essentially kidnapping him. As the exhausted detective was silent and apparently refuses to speak, even in order to state his own name, the two women christen him Singapore Sling after they discover a recipe in his pocket notebook for that type of [[Singapore Sling|cocktail]] and seem quite content with that arrangement. They use him as a pawn in their sexually tinged [[Sexual roleplay|role-playing games]] and as a party to their distorted and perverse form of entertainment, during which Singapore Sling, now a prisoner, is tied up, chained to a bed, vomited on, electrocuted, used as a sex slave, and subjected to various other forms of torture and atrocities in which he is forced to participate. However, as Singapore Sling's confinement wears on he regains his strength and takes a more active role in the games. His deranged captors become concerned and alarmed when a sharp kitchen knife, belonging to the late father, goes missing and they discover Singapore Sling digging a deep hole in their backyard. As psychotic as these two are, they are still lucid enough to recognize that a killing is imminent, if not two or even three. In an atmosphere of decadence and dark madness, the characters gradually sink into the depths of their subconscious mind.  A few days later the daughter decides that she is fed up with having to suffer under the yoke of maternal authority, and, together with Singapore Sling, murders her mother. Singapore Sling then takes what up until now used to be the mother's role in the sexual games. However, during one of these games, a reenactment of Laura's murder, he stabs the daughter, playing Laura, with the aforementioned missing kitchen knife now attached to his penis. The daughter, while bleeding to death, shoots Singapore Sling and then he goes out to the garden and falls into the pit which he himself had recently dug. The film hence ends, in short, with all three characters dead.

Slumber Party Massacre III
  The opening credits show a montage of photos. The final image shows a still black-and-white photograph of Uncle Billy with a young Ken. The screen stays focused on it, zooming into the screen.  Then, it cuts to a group of teenage friends are playing volleyball at a Los Angeles beach. Jackie is sitting with Diane talking when a strange man appears and sits at the beach near them and stares at the girls. Duncan yells to the weirdo and tells him to keep his eyes to himself. Duncan then mentions to Diana and Jackie about a party, but they tell him that it is a slumber party and guys are not invited. Juliette goes to get the volleyball and talks to her boyfriend Ken. As they are leaving, Jackie goes back to pick up something and drops her address book. When Sarah gets into her car, she is grabbed by an unseen person and a drill is run through her stomach from behind the car seat, killing her.  Frank drives Jackie home and they kiss for a minute. When Jackie approaches  the front door, they see that it is wide open. Inside the house is Morgan, who though it was an open house since Jackie's parents are moving. Jackie says that he can stay and look around for a while. After Jackie listens to messages from her mom and Morgan on her answering machine, an apparently nervous Morgan finally leaves.  Later, Jackie's friends arrive for the slumber party and telling her that Sarah did not answer at home and suggests that she may have flaked out on them. Morgan calls the girls (while he is spying on them through a telescope from his house across the street) and he asks Jackie if he can look at the house again. Jackie responds negatively. A little later, when Juliette and Maria playfully perform a striptease, Frank, Tom, and Michael scare them with masks. Jackie tells the guys to leave.  The weirdo from the beach is hanging outside the house, spying on the girls. Frank and Tom go to get something for the girls, and Michael goes to apologize for scaring them. He knocks on the front door, and girls ignore him. When he walks away he has an encounter with a masked person and he runs back to the door and bangs for help. He gets impaled with a "house for sale" sign post. The masked killer drags his body away and returns the post to the front yard.  A little later, Ken calls Juliette wanting to speak with her, and she invites him over. Duncan waits outside and sees a pizza delivery girl arriving with a pizza. He bribes the pizza girl to switch shirts and let him have the pizza. Duncan delivers the pizza to the girls and to say "I'm sorry" to them for the prank earlier. The girls let him into the house. The pizza girl (wearing Duncan's shirt) is walking down the street when she is chased by the unseen killer and is pushed to the ground and drilled numerous times through her stomach.   At the house, Jackie is talking with Diane when they hear a noise and see the weirdo outside. Jackie calls the police, but Officer O'Reilly on the other end of the line thinks that it's "just a bunch of girls with overactive imaginations." The girls let Frank and Tom inside, and Ken appears right behind them and enters the house too. Frank gives Jackie some flowers and apologizes. Meanwhile, the weirdo from the beach gets into the basement.  Susie shows her boyfriend, Tom, a swordfish on display in the basement and the two of them kiss. Upstairs, Juliette is upstairs making out with Ken and when her hand moves over to his crotch, he stops her. Janie hears them and tells the others "they're doing it!" Tom accidentally drops the pizza on the carpet and Susie gets some bleach to clean it up. Juliette goes into the bathroom to shower, and Ken leaves. She finds a vibrator in the bathroom, she plugs it in and laughs. While Juliette is in the bathtub, the lights go out and someone enters the bathroom, turns on the vibrator, and throws it into the bath water, electrocuting Juliette.  A few minutes later, Maria enters the bathroom, dries up some of the water that is on the floor, opens up a closet to get another towel and finds the dead Juliette. The group gathers together in the living room and Maria suggests that the weirdo from the beach killed their friend. Jackie calls the police again, but Officer O'Reilly still does not take their call seriously and hangs up. Ken suggests that he make a run for it and find his uncle, who used to be a police officer. As he runs out the front door, Tom joins him. As the two are running down the street, Ken stops by a lumberyard and suggests getting tools for better weapons. Tom finds a sledgehammer and gives it to Ken, who suddenly whacks Tom with it. Tom and Ken fight until Ken finally gets a chain saw and slices into Tom's legs. After Ken leaves, Tom sits up and begins to crawl away.  Back at the house, Jackie goes with Frank to check the basement. After seeing the swordfish with the "sword" broken off, they find the missing piece sticking in the dead weirdo in a trunk. They realize that the weirdo is not the killer. Just then Ken calls the house from a payphone where he tells them that his uncle said it would be safer to stay inside the house. After Ken hangs up, he goes to a van and inside are photos of his cop uncle, the dead bodies... and the drill. Ken is the driller killer.  Back at the house, Duncan goes to answer a knock on the front door and Ken barges in and drills him in the chest. Frank jumps on Ken from behind and the two men struggle. Morgan (still looking through his telescope) calls the police and reports a disturbance. Jackie hits Ken with a lamp, and Frank is knocked down by the drill. Jackie sits by Frank and tells Ken that he killed him. The other girls run but cannot get the back door open (because Ken had apparently lodged something between the sliding doors). Maria is separated from them and Ken approaches her. She sees Tom dead by the window having bled to death after crawling back to the house. Janine runs in and knocks Ken on the head with a glass bowl. Janine and Maria run to the door, but Maria is swiped by Ken's drill. Janine jumps through the glass back door and collapses on the patio. Ken proceeds to kill her.  Ken goes upstairs to look for the remaining girls. He walks into a room where the wounded Maria and terrified Susie are hiding. He finds Susie in a closet, pulls her out, and throws her onto a bed where he hits her. After Maria comes out of hiding, she hits Ken on the head with a lamp. Maria, Jackie, and Diane run down into the basement. They try crawling out of a window to escape, but Ken appears. Jackie shoots him with a spear gun, hitting him in the leg. They run back upstairs and find the dead Janine and her innards on the patio. When the wounded and angry Ken staggers up from the basement, Susie pours liquid bleach in a bucket and throws it at his face, blinding him. He swings wildly with his drill and hits Maria again, who pleads with Ken not to kill her. She says she knows he has been hurt and she seems to relax him by letting him touch her. He blindly gets on top of her, and Maria reaches for the drill. Ken becomes upset when her other hand moves around too much and correctly assuming she's trying to get at the drill, he manages to get to it first and kills Maria.  Still blinded, Ken hears Susie's voice coming from the kitchen. Jackie and Diane are standing by the front door to the kitchen waiting for him to make his move. Ken heads for Susie until Diane calls out and gets his attention. They knock the drill away from Ken and throw a volleyball net over him, while Diane whacks him with a baseball bat until he is knocked out. Having finally subdued him, Jackie goes to call the police in the next room. Ken wakes up and his vision begins to return as Susie and Diane stand guard over him. Ken thinks back to his insane Uncle Billy whom apparently motivated him to become the killer that he is. Ken then jumps up and grabs Diane. Susie tries to stab him, but he knocks her to the side and fatally stabs Diane to death. Jackie runs in, seizes the drill and kills Ken.  Relieved that it's finally over, Jackie finds on the dead Ken a photograph of Uncle Billy with a young Ken. Dropping the picture, she and Susie leave the scene, just as a police officer knocks on their door. The final shot shows the picture, which then appears in the screen accompanied with Uncle Billy's laugh. It then fades out and the credits roll.

Soultaker (film)
  The film begins in a hospital where the Soultaker is trying to find a room containing an elderly man. He eventually finds the room. The Soultaker looks at his pocket watch before using a ring to take the man's soul. The next day, a rich teen-aged girl named Natalie McMillan and her friend Karen get ready to go to "Summerfest". Meanwhile, a teenaged boy named Brad ([[David "Shark" Fralick]]) goes to pick up Natalie's former boyfriend Zack to go to Summerfest. Zack tells Brad that he wants to see Natalie again, but Brad tells him that he can never win a girl like Natalie again without money. Later they go to pick up another teenager named Tommy Marcetto.  At Summerfest, the Angel of Death tells Soultaker to kill Brad, Tommy ([[Chuck Williams (actor)|Chuck Williams]]), Zack, Natalie, and Brad's girlfriend Candice at 8:00. During Summerfest, Karen leaves Summerfest with her boyfriend John leaving Natalie behind. Before Brad, Tommy, Zack, and Candice leave the festival, Zack notices Natalie alone. Zack comes up to Natalie and the two reconcile. Zack offers to take Natalie home. Natalie takes his offer. The five teenagers take Brad's car and leave Summerfest. Brad - who is high on cocaine - is speeding. The Soultaker steps in the middle of the road. To avoid running over the Soultaker, Brad swerves and crashes into a tree. After the crash, Natalie, Brad, Zack, and Tommy find themselves a little away from the car unharmed. The four realize that Candice is missing.  Meanwhile, the Soultaker is at the crash site where it is shown that everyone has been critically injured. Soultaker takes Candice's soul. When Soultaker tries to get Brad's soul, he discovers that Candice's soul was still in her body but every one else's souls flew out. The Soultaker delivers the soul to the Angel of Death and explains that the others were displaced from their bodies, however it is never explained how this happened. The Angel of Death tells Soultaker to hunt down the other souls before midnight, and he must abide by the rules of time and space (although this is never clarified either). Later, the police and the ambulance are at the site. The ambulance takes the bodies and the police search the car. The police finds the [[cocaine]] that Brad had hidden in the car. Everybody comes back to the crash site after the police and the ambulance have gone. Brad searches the car to find his cocaine. All of the souls realize that Candice had died in the crash.  The Soultaker reveals himself, materializing from within the car, and claims Brad's soul while the others are helpless to stop him, and flee. The others find a convenience store where they try to tell the cashier that someone is trying to kill them, but the cashier does not notice their presence. Assuming the man is ignoring them, they leave the store, and the Soultaker appears again and grabs Natalie, to claim her soul, but her resemblance to his past love stays his hand. Zack rescues Natalie and they both flee, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy runs back to the store, and pleads for help from the cashier, to no avail. Tommy attempts to gain his attention by breaking a soda bottle, but this only confuses the cashier. The Soultaker is about to claim Tommy, when the Angel of Death appears to collect Brad's soul, and to reprimand his subordinate for failing to take Natalie when he had the chance. After delivering Brad's soul, the Soultaker enters the store and claims Tommy's soul.  Natalie and Zack are still fleeing with The Man behind them. The duo make it to Natalie's house. Before they open the door, Natalie's mother, Anna (Jean Reiner) opens the door. Zack and Natalie tells them about the Soultaker. Anna tells them that they will be safe inside. Anna tells Natalie that she will run a bath for Natalie, so she can relax. After Anna goes upstairs, Natalie apologizes to Zack for the loss of his friend. Zack also apologizes about the cocaine in the car.  Natalie goes upstairs. When she gets upstairs Natalie and Anna talks about Natalie's relationship with Zack. Natalie tells Anna that she will go to her room and lie down. When Natalie goes lie down, she falls asleep and dreams about being taken to the hospital. Anna wakes her to tell Natalie that the tub is full. Meanwhile, downstairs Zack hears something growling in the kitchen. When he goes to investigate, it was only the family dog, Charlie. Zack tells Charlie that no one will hurt him. It is shown that the reason Charlie is growling is because he can't see Zack, but can sense his presence.  Back upstairs, Natalie gets ready to bathe, and it is revealed that her mother is watching her undress.  While watching T.V., the news comes on and reports about the car crash. One of the reporters interviewing Natalie's father Grant reports that with parents permission the life support systems for Natalie and Zack will be shut of at midnight. Zack sees Anna on the news. Natalie discovers her mother watching her, and is disgusted, then horrified when her mother suddenly morphs into the Man that has been pursuing them. Instead of attacking her, The Soultaker attempts to make a pact with her, offering her eternal life, with the one proviso being that she stay by his side forever. Zack arrives and attempts to attack the Soultaker, but is easily overpowered. Natalie gets her father's shotgun and shoots the Man, to no effect, as the Soultaker reveals his nature by claiming that she "can't kill a man that is already dead."  The two manage to escape and flee to the hospital to return to their bodies before midnight before their life support systems will be shut off. In the hospital, Natalie is captured by the Man on an elevator which leads to the afterlife. The Man claims he is an angel and his duty it to collect the souls of the dying. He manages to convince Natalie that there is nothing left for her in living realm, and that Zack is already dead, but she can be saved if she stays with him. While searching for Natalie, Zack encounters Brad, who has become a grim reaper. Brad reveals that those who take a life, even if accidentally, they must pay for it through service as a grim reaper. Brad gives Zach two empty soul rings to help Zach and Natalie into their bodies, and helps him rescue Natalie from the Soultaker.  Natalie places herself in the ring over her body, but she still remains comatose. Zach discovers that a pendant she was wearing somehow acted as a barrier between her soul and her body, and he pulls her soul from her body and is about to attempt to return her to her body again, when the Soultaker appears again. The Soultaker chases Zack all the way to the top of the hospital, and corners him on the roof. Zach remembers that he is a soul and is no longer bound by death or pain, and escapes by leaping off the roof. The Soultaker is about to give chase, but is confronted by the Angel of Death once again. The Angel of Death informs him that it is past midnight and that the Soultaker has failed, for if the two died now, their souls would be lost forever. The Soultaker pleas with the Angel, promising that he can correct these errors, but is beyond forgiveness, and is collected into a soul ring by his master.  The movie ends with Zack visiting Natalie in the hospital on the day of her release.  Zack is greeted happily by Natalie's parents who used to not care for Zack at all.

 In 1973, 26-year-old Cheung Hueyin is abroad in London studying media. Upon her graduation, she learns that she, unlike her Caucasian roommates, has been rejected the chance for a job interview by the BBC. Receiving a letter from her mother, she returns to Hong Kong to attend her younger sister's wedding. The relationship between Hueyin and mother Aiko, who is Japanese, has been strained since childhood, partly a result of Aiko's nationality and the cultural problems she encountered living in Hong Kong. From many flashbacks, we see it was Hueyin's paternal grandparents who did much of the early child-rearing, however, they would often overstep boundaries, resulting in [[Dysfunctional family|family dysfunction]].  Before the end of [[World War II]] and before eventually becoming Mrs. Cheung and Hueyin's mother, Aiko spent time living in [[Manchukuo]]. There, she and other Japanese faced serious dilemmas after Japan's defeat and the subsequent uncertainties of imprisonment and punishment. The most intense of these dilemmas came with the serious illness of Aiko's infant nephew. His illness was eventually cured by Mr. Cheung after a chance encounter and desperate roadside plea for help by Aiko. Mr. Cheung was an army translator from [[Guangdong]], China with a background in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Aiko developed a sense of fondness for him upon seeing his actions and character. Aiko's brother concurred, mentioning that kindness toward children usually indicates a man of integrity. After Mr. Cheung escorted Aiko's family to the Japanese repatriation site, he revealed to Aiko a strong desire to be a romantic couple.  In 1973, Hueyin reluctantly agrees to accompany Aiko on a visit to her birthplace in [[Beppu]], Japan. Hueyin initially feels very out of place, not being able to speak the language and having no understanding of Japanese culture.  Eventually, though, she bonds with an uncle, learns to accept her Japanese heritage, and finally reaches an understanding with her mother. The experience encourages Hueyin to move beyond the BBC's rejection and become a successful television journalist in Hong Kong. Some time later, Aiko encourages Hueyin to visit her paternal grandparents in Guangdong, where Hueyin finds out one of her very youngest relatives has a mental disability. The film ends with Hueyin praying before a dimly lit, incense-choked ancestral altar, contrasting the open-air shrine she visited in Japan and the outdoor political rallies she now reports on.

South Atlantic Raiders
  === Part One=== The story revolves around Stan (Planer), a lonely and not-very-intelligent [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] security van driver and [[ham radio]] enthusiast who strikes up a long distance romance with Frances (French), an [[ornithology|ornithologist]] on expedition to the Falklands with Kathy (Saunders), a lazier woman she detests immensely. One night while trying to contact her, Stan hears the sounds of a violent altercation and becomes convinced that the island is under attack and that Frances' life is in danger.  After his attempts to report his concerns to the police are rebuffed, he and his military-obsessed best friend Billy (Edmondson) decide to rescue her themselves, and hatch a plot to rob a bank that is on their route to finance their expedition. They break into the house of the manager, Max (Coltrane), an alcoholic with a crumbling marriage, and hold his wife Mary (Burke) hostage until he opens the vault and gives them the money; unfortunately, the bank vault has a [[time lock]], meaning it cannot be opened until the next morning and forcing the two would-be robbers to stay overnight. As a consequence, they strike up a friendship with Max, try to help him bond with his wife by cooking them dinner, and thwart the attempts of Rollo (Richardson), a smooth-talking burglar, to steal from him.  Rollo is persuaded to join the bank heist and Max, having been fired from his job and with nothing left to lose, throws his lot in with the robbers as well. The robbery goes well, but their attempt to purchase a jet from [[British Aerospace]] to get to the Falklands ends with everyone except Stan arrested and sent to [[HM Prison Dartmoor|Dartmoor]]. Resolving to get them out, Stan learns from the widow of an ex-convict that there is an unused tunnel dug as part of a failed escape attempt that has never been discovered leading from Cell 109b to the outside world.  On learning this, at his request Billy is moved into the cell with the tunnel, only to discover too late that it is now also occupied by Randy Ron, a violent [[Prison rape|prison rapist]], while Rollo and Max are moved into the cell next door, a scene of horrific squalor. Breaking into Billy's cell, they rescue Billy from Ron as Stan arrives to lead them through the tunnel to freedom, and the episode ends with the main characters fleeing Dartmoor in an [[ice cream van]].  === Part Two: Argie Bargie! === The episode opens with Stan and Frances facing an Argentinian firing squad before [[Leopoldo Galtieri|General Galtieri]] (Nesbitt), about to be executed as spies. It transpires that while Stan's initial impression of Frances' life being in danger was mistaken, there was in fact an Argentinian military force hiding on the island, preparing to retake the Falkland Islands. Stan manages to get a stay of execution by telling Galtieri and his men the story of how he reached that point; after the escape from Dartmoor, Stan and his accomplices sneaked about a passenger jet heading to [[Vancouver]] by pretending to be the crew, Max having had some limited experience in flying [[Cessna]] aircraft "before my first breakdown."  Once in flight, Max is surprised to discover Mary aboard, intending to move to Canada and start a new life; he resolves to try and win her back. After numerous set-backs and calamities on the way, the plane is safely landed on a beach on the island, and Stan and Billy set off to find Frances. They instead find Kathy, who has attacked Frances and left her on the rocky cliffs to die—however, having previously mistaken her for Frances, Stan is unaware of the difference, and Kathy begins to seduce him. Discovering evidence that she is not Frances, Stan confronts her; Kathy reveals herself to be both an Argentinian agent and Galtieri's lover and attacks him. Fighting her off, Stan escapes and discovers Frances on the cliff-edge. While he manages to rescue her, they are discovered by the Argentinians and captured. Billy, having left Stan and Kathy alone to give them some privacy, discovers the Argentinian forces.  Stan concludes his narrative by proposing marriage to Frances, who accepts. Galtieri mocks Stan's story, before suddenly collapsing; Max has infiltrated the Argentinian base posing as a cook and has fed him a poisoned omelette. Billy at that point attacks the camp wearing a [[Ned Kelly]]-style suit of armour and firing flare guns at the Argentinians, while Rollo and Mary stage an attack by British forces. Kathy, distraught over Galtieri's death, commits suicide and the Argentinians flee in disarray. Having thwarted the invasion, the group return to Britain as heroes and it is revealed that in light of their actions the [[Home Secretary]] has commuted the thirty-year prison sentence that Stan, Billy, Max and Rollo were facing into a sentence of "one year at an easy prison".  
Sons of Bitches
 The plot of the film is based on real historical situation in [[Taganka Theater]], when its leader [[Yuri Lyubimov]] left the [[USSR]] (1984), and made a number of anti-Party statements, after which he was removed from the management of the theater and deprived of citizenship.  ''Sons of bitches''  tells how the troupe has apprehended these events and the pressure on them, the state, and also shows the events that have not happened – strike actors strike, the threat of self-immolation. The House sent a functionary from the Ministry – Yuri Mikhailovich, which is to restore order in the rebellious cultural institution. The story ends in tragedy – the death of one of the protesters.  
Stanley & Iris
 Iris King, a [[widow]] still grieving 6 months after the loss of her husband, works in a baking factory in [[Connecticut]] and lives in a high-crime area.  She lives from paycheck to paycheck as she raises her two children, Kelly and Richard.  Also staying with her are her sister Sharon and Sharon's [[Domestic violence|abusive]] husband Joe, both unemployed.  With money already tight for the family, Kelly discovers she is pregnant, which makes matters worse.  Iris makes the acquaintance of Stanley Cox, a cook in the bakery's lunchroom [[cafeteria]], when he comes to her aid after her purse is snatched on a bus.  But as their friendship develops, she begins noticing peculiarities about Stanley − he doesn't own a car (he instead bicycles wherever he needs to go), he lives with and supports his elderly father, becomes frustrated when asked to sign his name, doesn't believe in opening Chinese [[Fortune cookie|fortune cookies]], and cannot pick out a specific item from a shelf.  Iris soon realizes that Stanley is [[Literacy|illiterate]], and when she innocently mentions this to Stanley's boss, Stanley is fired the next day over food safety and legal concerns, despite being a good cook and model employee.  Afterwards, Stanley is unable to obtain any steady work, forcing him to move into a garage and put his father in a shabby retirement home.  His father dies in the home only a few weeks later, upsetting Stanley over the fact that his illiteracy prevented him from caring for his father properly.  Stanley seeks Iris out and asks her to teach him to read, explaining that his traveling-salesman father moved him all over the country when Stanley was a boy, bouncing him to nearly 50 different schools in total, resulting in Stanley developing no reading or writing skills from this lack of educational stability.  Iris begins giving Stanley basic reading lessons and he gradually grows close to her and her family.  It is during one of these reading exercises that he tells her that he has wanted to be intimate with her since they first met, but Iris is hesitant.  Iris tests Stanley's developing reading skills by making him a map and having him meet her at a certain street corner in 15 minutes, but Stanley gets hopelessly lost.  Hours later, he reaches the corner where a frantic Iris is still waiting.  Frustrated, Stanley marches off alone without saying a word, his interest in learning to read gone.  Iris visits him at his garage home to try to persuade him to continue learning to read.  Looking around, she sees a large mechanical project that Stanley is working on, as he invents things as a hobby.  He has designed a cake-cooling machine that can outperform anything in the commercial marketplace.  Iris is immensely impressed and Stanley reveals that a local company has shown interest in his invention and even offered him a job.  Stanley agrees to start reading again with Iris, and in time learns to write short sentences.  Stanley surprises Iris by cooking a big dinner for her and her family, and the two of them begin to grow close again.  After Kelly has her baby, Iris is displeased when she drops out of school to work at the bakery, as she doesn't want her daughter wasting her life in the kind of dead-end job she herself is in.  Stanley and Iris finally decide to make love, but Iris is still clinging to her late husband's memory.  This threatens their budding relationship further and they don't see each other for some time.  Not prepared to give up on Iris the way she didn't give up on him, Stanley finally goes to see her.  Iris hands him an unmailed letter she wrote to him, and Stanley surprises her by reading it aloud nearly perfectly.  Iris, now ready to start letting go of the past, accompanies Stanley to a fancy hotel where they order room service and spend the night together.  Stanley soon moves to [[Detroit]] for a new, well-paying job he has been offered, his inventing ability finally having paid off.  Several months later, back in Connecticut, Iris is walking home carrying groceries when an expensive car pulls up next to her and she is surprised to find Stanley behind the wheel.  Stanley tells her that he's been given a raise and is looking to buy a large six-bedroom house in Detroit − and that he wants her to move there with him as his wife.  Iris accepts.  
The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)

Three time travelers, [[Adam-12|Adam-11]] (David Cassidy), [[Chanel No. 5|Chanel-6]] (Olivia d'Abo), and [[Heinz 57|Heinz-57]] (Geoff Hoyle) are sent back to July 4, 1776, to retrieve America's heritage, but due to an unnoticed time machine malfunction, end up in 1976 instead, during the [[United States Bicentennial]]. While pursuing their mission, the time travelers dress in period costume (e.g., tight [[bell bottoms|bell bottom pants]]), and experience [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]], the [[Sexual Revolution]], [[Pop Rocks]], [[disco]], long gas lines, the [[AMC Pacer]] and even drug paraphernalia shops.  They are in turn pursued by Rodney Snodgrass (Liam O'Brien), a science whiz and [[UFO]] buff, who thinks they are aliens, and plans to use them to win the Bicentennial Science Fair prize at his high school. His self-absorbed, disco-dancing brother, Eddie Trojan ([[Leif Garrett]]), pursues Chanel-6 for his own pleasure. Both are foiled by two dimwitted but good-hearted teenage friends, Tommy Sears and Chris Johnson (Steve and Jeffrey McDonald of [[Redd Kross]]), who help the time travelers repair their craft and return to 2176, with their 1970s artifacts and a copy of the Constitution, printed on a shirt which was bought from an est seminar attendee ([[Barbara Bain]]).  
Spaced Invaders
 The space armada from [[Mars]], known as the Imperial Atomic Space Navy (Battle Group Seven), fights an interstellar war against their long-time enemy, the Arcturans. The armada is forced into battle by Enforcer Droids, tasked to keep the Martian soldiers in line, despite objections by some that it won't work. Meanwhile, an incompetent crew of a small Martian spaceship, from the Civilian Asteroid Patrol, intercept a distress signal from the fleet, followed by a [[Halloween]] rebroadcast of [[Orson Welles]]' 1938 [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|''The War of the Worlds'']] radio dramatization.  Mistaking this for a real invasion and not wanting to miss out on the glory, they land their ship in the tiny community of Big Bean, Illinois and begin their invasion of Earth. The ship's smart-mouthed pilot, Blaznee, with more common sense than the others, doesn't think it's a good idea, but he is ignored by the rest of the crew: Captain Bipto, the overzealous optimist of the group; Lieutenant Giggywig, the ambitious, know-it-all hothead; Dr. Ziplock, the careful and calculating scientist; and Corporal Pez, who is overeager, yet timid. They search for the invasion fleet they think has already landed. Because it's Halloween, everyone assumes they are just kids in very good costumes. Eventually, though, a few locals realize the truth.  Among them is the town sheriff (Barr), his daughter (Richards) and an elderly farmer named Wrenchmuller ([[Royal Dano]]), on whose farm the Martians have crash-landed. The sheriff finds out about the aliens when his deputy records their ship doing 3,000&nbsp;mph.  The deputy tracks down the ship to give the occupants tickets for having no license, no registration, no headlights, no taillight, no wheels, and going 2945 miles over the posted limit. The sheriff's daughter, Kathy, discovers the aliens when they join a group of [[trick-or-treating]] kids. She befriends the Martians' "Scout-in-a-Can", a small robot that folds up into a sphere and is considered "smart, efficient, easy to use and expendable." Mr. Wrenchmuller tries to cash in on the Martians' existence in order to save his farm. Captain Bipto gets hit by a truck and turns a gas station attendant named Vern into his robotic slave. Giggywig, Ziplock and Pez try to blow up the town's Co-Op and instead just heat up a silo of corn kernals, creating a gigantic hot air popcorn popper. Kathy's new friend, Brian (the Duck) captures Blaznee by hitting him with a trashcan lid. He then tries to help the alien repair his ship. Wrenchmuller tries to blow the ship up and gets trapped in a paralyzing beam. The desperate Martians try to blow the Earth up using the D.O.D. (Doughnut Of Destruction), but it falls apart instead. The Martians finally realize they made a horrible mistake.  Things get worse when the ship's "hyperdriver" starts to go into meltdown, threatening to create a black-hole. Their ship's Enforcer Drone won't let them leave, making things even more complicated. The humans manage to destroy the Enforcer Drone with dynamite and help the grateful "invaders" return to space. As an unintentional gift the Martians jettison their ship's sewage tank while flying over Wrenchmuller's field to lighten the load on their ship so that they can reach gravitational escape velocity.  The alien manure rejuvenates the drought-stricken farmland and turns the regular green beans (for which the town is famous) into gigantic, 6 foot tall pods, enabling Wrenchmuller to save the town from greedy real-estate developers. As the Martians head home Captain Bipto suggests they go to Arcturus to "help torture prisoners", which is shot down by the rest of the crew.

Mare blames herself for the kidnapping and has difficulty processing the loss. Sixteen years later, Mare is now in a happy long-distance relationship with Dan ([[Chris Sarandon]]) - a California man who moved to Minneapolis after the suicide of his son - when a young man named Mark ([[Ricky Schroder|Rick Schroder]]) shows up, claiming to be her son. Mare is reluctant to take him in, fearing that he is playing a cruel joke, until he shares memories from the past and shows a scar from a stove burn that matches with Luke's. He explains that he was raised in Idaho, and is now on a rest stop in Minnesota before returning to New York City to take a job. Mare is excited to catch up on sixteen years with her son, but Dan continues to doubt Mark's credibility.  One day, Mare takes Mark to the supermarket where the kidnapping took place, but faints. In the hospital, Mark finds out that Mare is pregnant and is surprised that she does not want him to tell Dan. Dan continues to seek evidence that will prove whether or not Mark is actually Luke, despite Mare's confession that she does not want to know whether Mark's story proves to be either true or false. At the police station, Dan finds out that the city in Idaho where Mark claims to have grown up - "Emerald City" - does not exist. Upset with Mark, Dan reluctantly saves his life when he almost falls off the roof. Mark then claims that Emerald City was a lie told to cover up his much worse past, and assures Dan of his credibility by showing him a birth mole that Luke also had. Shortly after, Mare rejects the latest of several marriage proposals from Dan, who has just found out through Mark about her pregnancy.  During an [[ice fishing]] trip, Dan confronts Mark yet again about the lies about his past. Feeling trapped, Mark pushes Dan into the water and lets him drown to death under the ice. Mark then returns to the house and cuts the phone wire and electricity cable, as well as disabling the motor in Mare's car, thus ensuring that Mare has no way to call for help and no other place to go. Mare is unaware of his responsibility in all these occurrences, though, and is further manipulated by Mark's claim that Dan fell in the water due to his fight with her over their marriage views. A visit from a police officer changes her views on Mark, upon finding out that he did not inform the officer about Dan's death. Mark turns the confrontation by insisting that she has been a horrible mother to him. The police officer, meanwhile, finds out that there are flaws to Mark's claims.  As both realize that Mark is a sociopathic killer, they unsuccessfully try to get away. Mark first nearly kills the officer with a hammer, and then turns to Mare. She attempts to throw him out, but he easily overpowers her; knocking her head through a mirror before handcuffing her. Later, he releases her and gives her another chance "to be a good mother", only to attack her when she claims to love him. When she admits that she is a bad mother, Mark responds that she should die for it. Mare, who does not believe that Mark is her own son anymore, attempts to shoot him to death with the policeman's pistol, but runs out of bullets. She is then pushed into the basement and awakes next to the police officer's nearly lifeless body. While Mark is distracted while digging a hole to bury the two, the officer manages to weakly move his arm enough to indicate his bullet-belt, and so Mare retrieves the gun and reloads it. Mark, meanwhile, admits that he is not her son, before starting to bury her alive. To save her life, Mare shoots him. Mark survives the shooting and is about to kill her with a hammer, when suddenly the police officer's father appears behind Mare and saves her by shooting Mark to death. Mare awakes in the hospital, by her mother's side.

He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards.  ===''Cat from Hell''=== In the second tale, [[George A. Romero]] adapts a [[Stephen King]] short story of the same name. Drogan is a wealthy, wheelchair-bound old man ([[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]]) who brings in a hitman named Halston ([[David Johansen]]) for a bizarre hire: kill a [[black cat]], which Drogan believes is murderously evil. Drogan explains that there were three other occupants of his house before the cat arrived: his sister, Amanda ([[Dolores Sutton]]), her friend Carolyn ([[Alice Drummond]]), and the family's butler, Richard Gage ([[Mark Margolis]]). Drogan claims that one by one, the cat killed the other three, and that he is next. Drogan's [[pharmaceutical company]] killed 5,000 [[cat]]s while testing a new drug, and he is convinced that this black cat is here to [[Karma|exact cosmic revenge]].   Halston doesn't believe the story, but is more than willing to eliminate the cat since Drogan is offering $100,000. But when Drogan returns to the house to see if the deed is done, he finds that the cat has killed Halston by climbing down his throat. The cat emerges from the hitman's corpse and jumps at Drogan, giving him a fatal heart attack.  ===''Lover's Vow''=== The third and final segment is written by [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]] and based on the [[Yuki-onna]], a spirit or yōkai in Japanese folklore or more specifically [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s version in ''[[Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things]]''. A despondent [[artist]] named Preston ([[James Remar]]) witnesses a gruesome murder committed by a [[gargoyle]]-like monster. The monster agrees to spare Preston's life as long as he swears never to speak of what he saw or describe the monster's appearance to anyone. The monster vanishes, leaving Preston traumatized and confused, but bound by his oath never to talk about the incident.  After that night, Preston's life takes many turns for the better. He meets a beautiful woman named Carola ([[Rae Dawn Chong]]), and they fall in love, marry, and have two children. Preston's struggling art career becomes wildly successful, and life seems promising, but he is tormented by memories of his encounter with the monster, and his vow of silence weighs on him. One night he breaks down and tells Carola about the monster, even showing her a statue he sculpted of it. She appears upset and at first, Preston assumes she thinks he is lying. But then she lets out a heartbroken screech and reveals herself to be the very same creature he met that night.  With Preston's promise broken, she can no longer remain human, and their children transform into monstrous forms as well. She kills Preston (though she says that she loved him), gathers their children and flies away. The final scene shows that the gargoyle and children have turned to stone upon a building ledge, staring down at Preston's body with sorrowful expressions.  ===''Epilogue''=== Betty remarks that Timmy saved the best story ("Lover's Vow") for last, but he says that the next one is best, and has a happy ending. She replies that it's too late as she has to start cooking him, and that none of the stories in the book have happy endings. As Betty advances on Timmy, he narrates his own actions - throwing some marbles on the floor causing her to slip and fall on her butcher's block, impaling herself on her own tools. Timmy releases himself and pushes her into her own oven. The film ends with Timmy helping himself to a cookie and breaking the [[fourth wall]] by saying "Don't you just love happy endings?"

He traps D'Costa in his own words, making him confess his crime. He also provides evidence for the same.  The helpless D'Costa is suspended from service. But Ravi and Mohini know that D'Costa will never leave them in peace. They approach his mistress ([[Archana Puran Singh]]) for help; she says that D'Costa's desires can be used against him. They hatch a plan. Ravi leaves the house before Mohini, pretending to go out of the city. D'Costa learns of this and immediately goes to the couple's house, where he is met by a surprise reception.

The criminals together attack and kill D'Costa.  The film ends with D'Costa's burial, as Ravi sticks a cross with D'Costa's name on the grave.

Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!
 Ricky, a 23-year-old psychiatric patient, has been deemed cured and is released from a [[mental institution]]. Until then he has been the lover of the woman director of the hospital. An orphan, free, and alone, his goal is to have a normal life with Marina Osorio, an actress, former [[Pornographic film actor|porn star]], and recovering drug addict, whom he once slept with during an escape from the asylum.  Ricky discovers Marina’s whereabouts from a film journal announcement of the start of her next film. He goes to the studio where Marina is in her last day at work filming ''The Midnight Phantom'', a Euro-horror film about a hideously mutilated, masked muscleman in love with Marina’s character. The film is directed by Máximo Espejo, an old film director confined to a wheelchair after a stroke. Máximo is a gentle mentor to Marina and threatens to throw out a journalist who mentions the words "porn" and "junkie" in Marina’s presence. His protection of the actress is not completely innocent since he is sexually attracted to Marina and lusts after her, enjoying what could be his last experience of directing a sexy female lead.  When Ricky comes to the set, he steals a few necessary items including the keys to Marina’s apartment, and before long, he is an unwelcome presence in her life. Ricky, with a long-haired wig, does a handstand to try to capture her attention. Marina does not remember him and quickly dismisses him.  After filming the last scene, Marina goes home to change for the post-shoot party. Ricky follows her to her apartment. When she answers the door, Ricky forces his way in. He grabs her and headbutts her to silence her when she screams; he tapes her mouth and binds her with rope. Marina wakes with a terrible toothache, which normal painkillers do not relieve as she is addicted to stronger drugs. Ricky explains that he has captured her so that when she gets to know him better she will fall in love and they will get married and have children. "I'll never love you, ever," says Marina, understandably enraged at being handcuffed, gagged and lashed to the bed. "We'll see," says Ricky, who would do anything to win her heart.  Marina is shocked and in pain, and eventually persuades Ricky to take her to a doctor who can give her the necessary painkillers. Ricky barely leaves her alone with the doctor, and she is unable to communicate her plight. They cannot get the drugs in the pharmacy so Ricky goes off to get them on the black market. However, rather than paying the street price, he attacks the dealer to get the tablets.  During the after-filming party, Marina’s sister, Lola, who is the assistant director of ''The Midnight Phantom'', steals the show with a musical number. Increasingly worried about her sister’s disappearance, Lola visits Marina's apartment and leaves a note. To avoid being discovered, Ricky moves Marina to her next door neighbor’s apartment. The apartment is empty, but the owner has left his keys with Lola so she can water his plants while he is away during the summer.  In the street again, Ricky is spotted by the dealer who he had attacked. Ricky is then seriously beaten, robbed and left unconscious. During his absence Marina makes a desperate but somewhat halfhearted attempt to escape from her captivity. However, when Ricky returns covered with blood and cuts, she sees his vulnerability and devotion to her, no matter how misguided. She cares for him, cleaning and sterilizing his wounds, and is suddenly struck by the realization that she has fallen in love with her captor. They make love at length and Ricky seems to be on the verge of achieving his aim. They decide to take a trip together to his native village.  When he is about to leave to steal a car for the trip, Marina, who still considers herself his prisoner, tells him to keep her tied up so that she will not try to escape. However, in Ricky’s absence, Lola reenters the apartment and discovers Marina tied up and rescues her. Marina informs her sister that she is in love with her captor. Lola is astonished to learn that Marina really no longer wants to be rescued, but once convinced, she agrees to drive Marina to Ricky's birthplace. They find him there in the ruins of his family house in a deserted village, then the three climb into Lola's car to return to the city. Lola promises Ricky she will find him a job, Marina cries with happiness, and they drive off together into the distance, singing like a normal family.

Total Recall (1990 film)
  Construction worker Douglas Quaid is having troubling dreams about [[Mars]] and a mysterious woman there. His wife Lori dismisses the dreams and discourages him from thinking about Mars, where the governor, Vilos Cohaagen, is fighting a rebellion. At Rekall, a company that provides memory implants of vacations, Quaid opts for a memory trip to Mars as a secret agent. However, something goes wrong during the procedure, and Quaid starts revealing suppressed memories of actually being a secret agent. They sedate him, wipe his memory of the visit, and send him home. On the way, Quaid is attacked by his friend Harry and some other men and he is forced to kill them. He is then attacked in his apartment by Lori, who states that she isn't his wife; their marriage is a false memory implant, and Cohaagen sent her to monitor Quaid. He is then attacked and pursued by armed men led by Richter, Cohaagen's operative.  After evading his attackers, Quaid is given a suitcase containing money, gadgets, fake IDs, and a video recording. The video is of Quaid himself, who identifies himself as Hauser and explains that he used to work for Cohaagen, but switched sides after learning about the artifact and underwent the memory wipe to protect himself. Hauser instructs Quaid to remove a tracking device located inside his skull before ordering him to go to Mars and check into the Hilton Hotel with a fake ID. Quaid makes his way to Mars and goes to Venusville, primarily populated by people mutated as a result of poor radiation shielding. He meets Benny, a taxi driver, and Melina, the woman from his dreams, but she spurns him, believing that he is still working for Cohaagen.  Quaid later encounters Dr. Edgemar and Lori, who claim Quaid has suffered a "schizoid embolism" and is trapped in a fantasy based on the implanted memories. Edgemar warns that Quaid is headed for a lobotomy if he does not return to reality, then offers Quaid a pill that would waken him from the dream. Quaid puts the pill in his mouth, but sees Edgemar sweating, so he kills Edgemar and spits out the pill. Richter's men burst into the room and capture Quaid, but Melina rescues him, with Quaid killing Lori in the process. Melina and Quaid race back to Venusville and escape into the tunnels with Benny. Unable to locate Quaid, Cohaagen shuts down the ventilation to Venusville, slowly asphyxiating its citizens. Quaid, Melina, and Benny are taken to a resistance base, and Quaid is introduced to Kuato. Kuato reads Quaid's mind and tells him that the alien artifact is a turbinium reactor that will create a breathable atmosphere for Mars, eliminating Cohaagen's monopoly on breathable air. Benny reveals that he works for Cohaagen, whose forces burst in and kill most of the resistance, including Kuato.  Quaid and Melina are taken to Cohaagen, who explains that the Quaid persona was a ploy by Hauser to infiltrate the mutants and expose Kuato, thereby wiping out the resistance. Cohaagen orders Hauser's memory to be reimplanted in Quaid and Melina programmed as Hauser's obedient wife, but Quaid and Melina escape into the mines where the reactor is located. Benny attacks them in an excavation machine, but Quaid kills Benny. Quaid then confronts Richter and his men, killing them, too.  Quaid reaches the reactor control room, where Cohaagen is waiting with a bomb. During the ensuing struggle, Cohaagen triggers the bomb, but Quaid throws it away, blowing out one of the walls of the control room and causing an [[explosive decompression]]. Cohaagen is sucked out onto the surface, killing him. Quaid manages to activate the reactor before Melina and he are also pulled out and begin to experience the decompression effects. Before they die, the reactor releases air into the atmosphere, saving Quaid, Melina, and the rest of Mars' population. As humans walk onto the surface of the planet, Quaid momentarily pauses to wonder whether he is dreaming or not, before turning to kiss Melina.  
To Sleep with Anger
  Harry (Danny Glover), an enigmatic old friend from the South, comes to visit  Gideon (Paul Butler) and his wife Suzie (Mary Alice), who haven't seen him for many years,  who are delighted to see him again, and who insist that he stay with them for as long as he would like.  Gideon and Suzie live in [[South Central Los Angeles]], though they retain some of their rural southern ways, including raising chickens in the backyard. Harry has a charming, down-home manner, but his presence brings to a crisis the simmering trouble that is already in the family—especially as regards the younger son, Samuel or "Baby Brother" ([[Richard Brooks (actor)|Richard Brooks]]), and his relation to his parents, wife, and older brother, Junior ([[Carl Lumbly]]). His disruptive presence is dangerous (his influence threatens to break up Samuel's marriage and seems to be related to the illness that puts Gideon in bed in serious condition for a couple weeks), but ultimately purgative: Gideon's extended family is much more cohesive as a result of Harry's visit. Samuel and Junior struggle over a knife in a climactic fight during a storm, which ends in Suzie sustaining a knife wound. During a long wait in the emergency room, the storm clears, and, similarly, the simmering anger that Harry seemed to bring to a boil is also dissipated. Harry's death just before the end of the film suggests, ambiguously, that he has been to a degree a self-sacrificing savior of the family.  
Tom et Lola
 Tom and Lola are a young boy and girl who are victims of a rare disease which means that they are prevented from any contact with the outside world. They are kept inside plastic bubbles in a Paris hospital. In this aseptic and strictly controlled microcosm run by doctors especially chosen for the task, the children are left with almost no external stimuli, other than an old black and white TV set tuned to educational films about subjects such as whale song, trains, and a show called ''The Adventures of Tikira in Alaska.'' Tom's mother is in constant attendance, but her increasingly desperate attempts to beguile him have alienated her almost totally from them, and apart from Hélene, a member of the medical team who has been their nearest thing to a parent, Tom and Lola's only close attachment is to each other.  Eventually, the two children discover that by using the gauntlets that form part of their plastic pods, they are able to reach out and grasp each other's hands. One night, Tom discovers that if he pulls Lola's arms hard enough and she pulls his, they can draw their bubbles close enough for him to reach the external emergency deflate controls on her bubble. After he has activated these, Lola escapes her bubble and releases Tom from his.  Over the next few nights, the children regularly escape their plastic prisons and eventually meet Robert, a boy in another ward of the hospital. He is initially frightened by the two strange children. He thinks Tom and Lola are [[Martian]]s, possibly due to their nakedness and baldness which is required for hygienic living within the bubbles. However, they quickly make friends, and he shows them other areas of the hospital, including the hydrotherapy pool, where he has a seizure after his [[Intravenous therapy|medication drip line]] pulls out. The pair save him, and get him back to his room.  During another visit, Robert tells Tom and Lola that he is originally from Izouard, a small skiing village in the French [[Alps]] and shows them plans for escaping the hospital in order to return home. Tom and Lola agree this is a good idea and all three plan to escape the next night. However, when they arrive at his room the following night, Robert has already left and (they later discover) has come to grief while climbing over the hospital wall. Undeterred, Tom and Lola decide to escape anyway, having secured the address of Hélene.  Escaping the hospital, the two find their way across the Seine to a railway shunting yard in search of the train to Izouard, and climb aboard a passenger carriage where they fall asleep. They are discovered and taken to Hélene's home by a railway worker, having found on them a card with the address.  When Tom and Lola arrive at her house, her children are at home, alone as usual, as their mother spends more time with Tom and Lola at her work than with her own kids. A mutual regard and understanding develops between them, and together they contrive to set up a home situation more like the environment at the hospital, in the hope of regaining Hélene's attention. These hopes are dashed when she arrives home: her priority clearly remains the wellbeing of the escapees, and when her oldest son overhears her promise to the runaways that she will shelter them, he is disillusioned and calls the authorities.  The inevitable consequence in these circumstances is that the children will die, and the movie does not pull back from that, but treats the prospect in an allegorical, "magical realist" way. As the medical staff had planned in any case to separate the children without regard for their attachment - something they discovered only in the process of escaping - their ''pronostic'' had always been bleak.  
Too Much Sun
  A multi-millionaire is making out his will. His son is gay and his daughter a lesbian, yet he vows to leave his fortune to the first one who can produce a grandchild.  
To Play or to Die
 In this short motion picture, schoolboy Kees is intelligent, introvert and sensitive, but gets ridiculed verbally and physically at an all-boys school by mindlessly cocky class mates and even insensitive teachers, especially in gym, where his physical weakness is mercilessly abused to make him a defenceless laughing stock in front of his smirking peers. His awakening sexual interest goes to boys, and in particular to Charel, a beautiful athletic classmate who probably feels an undetermined interest but would never risk admitting (possibly not even to himself) having any gay or bi appreciation, least of all for a 'sissy', and thus remains unresponsive to shy Kees' overtures. When the hunk finally comes over to Kees' place while his parents are away, a desperate disappointment with a tragical twist is in the making.  
Truly, Madly, Deeply
 Nina, an [[Interpreter (communication)|interpreter]], is beside herself with grief at the recent death of her boyfriend, Jamie, a [[cellist]]. When she is on the verge of despair, Jamie reappears as a "ghost" and the couple are reconciled. The screenplay never clarifies whether this occurs in reality, or merely in Nina's imagination. Nina is ecstatic. But Jamie tells her about his days while she is at work, and one dialog suggests she should embrace the life around her; one of these is about a memorial plaque in a park about a dead child and how parents who read it feel an immediate, compelling need to hug their children. The returned Jamie also reminds her that he also irritated her, and as a ghost he manifests behaviors she'd have little patience for – turning up the [[central heating]] to stifling levels, moving furniture around and inviting back "ghost friends" to watch videos. This infuriates her, and their relationship deteriorates.  She meets Mark, a [[psychologist]], to whom she is attracted, but she is unwilling to become involved with him because of Jamie's continued presence. Nina continues to love Jamie but is conflicted by his self-centred behaviour and ultimately wonders out loud, "Was it always like this?" Over Nina’s objections, Jamie decides to leave to allow her to move on. Towards the end of the film, Jamie watches Nina leave and one of his fellow ghosts asks, "Well?" and Jamie responds, "I think so... Yes." At this point the central conceit of the movie has become clear: Jamie came back specifically to help Nina get over him by tarnishing her idealised memory of him.<ref name=minghella/>  
Tremors (film)
 Valentine "Val" McKee and Earl Basset work as handymen in [[Perfection, Nevada]], an isolated ex-mining settlement in the high desert east of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains. They eventually tire of their jobs and leave for Bixby, the nearest town. As they leave, they discover the dead body of another resident, Edgar Deems, perched atop an [[Electricity pylon|electrical tower]], still grasping the tower's crossbeams and his [[.30-30 Winchester]] rifle. Jim Wallace, the town doctor, determines that Edgar died of dehydration, apparently afraid for some reason to climb down.  Later on, an unknown force kills shepherd "Old Fred" and his flock of sheep. After discovering his severed head buried in the sand, Val and Earl become convinced that a killer is on the loose; they head back to town to warn the other residents. Two construction workers ignore Val and Earl's warning and are killed by the same force, causing a rock slide.  Val and Earl try to get help, but find the phone lines are dead, and the only road out of town is completely blocked by the rock slide. Out of sight, a snake-like creature wraps itself around their truck's rear axle; the creature is torn apart when Val stomps on the accelerator and drives away, and they find it when they return to town.  Val and Earl return to Perfection and borrow horses. They come upon Wallace and his wife's buried [[station wagon]] near their trailer, but the couple is missing (they were killed the previous night). As they press on, something suddenly erupts out of the ground, revealing the snake-like creature to be one of multiple-tentacled "tongues" joined to an enormous burrowing worm-like creature (later named a "[[graboid]]" by general store owner Walter Chang). Thrown from their horses, the two men run for their lives. The chase ends when the eyeless creature violently rams itself into the concrete wall of an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] and dies from the impact. Rhonda LeBeck, a graduate student conducting [[seismology]] tests in the area, stumbles onto the scene; she deduces from previous soundings that three other graboids are in the area. Rhonda, Val, and Earl become trapped overnight atop a cluster of boulders near one of the creatures. Rhonda has a brainstorm and grabs one of several left-behind fence poles; the three of them pole vault from each residual boulder to her truck, finally making their getaway.  After the people return to town, the graboids attack, eventually killing Walter and forcing the other citizens to the town's rooftops. Meanwhile, nearby [[survivalist]] couple [[Burt Gummer|Burt]] and Heather Gummer manage to kill another one of the creatures after unknowingly luring it from town to their basement armory. In town, the two remaining graboids attack the building foundations, knocking over the trailer belonging to Nestor and dragging him under. Realizing they cannot stay any longer, Val commandeers a bulldozer and chains a partial truck trailer to the rear, while everyone else distracts the creatures; the survivors use it to try to escape to a nearby mountain range. On the way there, both graboids create an underground sinkhole trap that disables the bulldozer, forcing the survivors to flee to the safety of large boulders.  Earl has an idea to lure in the creatures, then to trick them into swallowing Burt's homemade pipe bombs. While this works on one graboid, the other spits it back towards the survivors, forcing Val, Earl, and Rhonda to vacate the rock quickly to avoid the explosion. With one last pipe bomb, Val lures the creature to chase him to the edge of a cliff and then explodes the bomb behind it, frightening the graboid into tunneling through the cliff face, where it plummets to its death. The group returns to town, where they call in the authorities to begin an investigation, and Earl pushes Val into approaching Rhonda romantically.  
Troll 2
 Michael has always dreamed of being a farmer, and arranges a [[home exchange|home exchange vacation]] in which he and his family will move into a house in the rural farming community of Nilbog (which is "goblin" spelled backwards) for a month. The night before the family is scheduled to leave, Michael's son Joshua is contacted by the ghost of his dead grandfather, Seth, warning him that [[vegetarian]] [[goblins]] want to transform him and his family into plants so that they can eat them. Seth tells Joshua that goblins can turn people into plants by feeding them poisoned food or drink.  Meanwhile, Joshua's sister, Holly, receives a visit from her boyfriend Elliot. Holly accuses Elliot of being a [[homosexual]] since he seems to prefer spending time with his friends. Elliot promises to show his devotion by accompanying the family on vacation.  The next morning, Elliot fails to arrive and the family leaves without him; they encounter him en route to Nilbog, riding in an RV with his friends Arnold, Drew, and Brent. Outside of Nilbog, Seth appears as a hitchhiker, who warns Joshua that Nilbog is the kingdom of the goblins, and that if his family eats anything while they are there, they will be turned into plants. The family disbelieves Joshua's warnings and continue on to Nilbog. There, Joshua sets about destroying or contaminating all of the food the family finds or acquires.  Arnold goes for a walk outside of Nilbog and encounters a girl being chased by goblins. They flee to a [[chapel]] in the woods, where they encounter the goblins' queen, [[Druid]] Creedence Leonore Gielgud, who uses the "Stonehenge Magic Stone" to give the goblins power. Creedence tricks them into drinking a magic potion that dissolves the girl into vegetable matter and turns Arnold into a plant.  Joshua sneaks away from home and eavesdrops on a goblin [[Church service|church]] sermon, which bewails the evils of eating meat. The parishioners capture him and attempt to force feed him poison ice cream; Michael walks in on the scene and becomes suspicious, taking Joshua home.  Later, Drew goes to the town because there are no food or drinks in the RV. The sheriff takes him in his car and gives him a green hamburger. When he arrives in the town, Drew goes to the store and the owner offers him poisonous Nilbog milk. Feeling dizzy, he goes to a chapel and finds Arnold, who has turned into a plant. Drew drags him out, but Creedence appears. She knocks him out and chainsaws Arnold into pieces. Drew is then killed offscreen.  At the house, the family discover that the townspeople have prepared them a surprise party to apologize for the events at the church. Joshua attempts to make contact with Seth, only for Creedence to appear in goblin form. Seth's ghost appears and chops her hand off. Creedence returns to her chapel, where she transforms herself into a beautiful woman in revealing clothes; she then travels to Elliot's RV, where she seduces Brent and drowns him in popcorn.  Joshua, Elliot, Holly, Michael and Diane hold a [[séance]] to communicate with Seth, who returns from the dead and tells them that he can retain a physical form for exactly 10 minutes before he has to return to the afterlife. Seth gives Joshua a paper bag containing a "secret weapon" to use against the goblins. The goblins break into the house and transport Joshua to Creedence's chapel, where Joshua opens the bag, revealing a "double-decker [[Bologna sandwich]]". He eats the sandwich, making his body poisonous to the goblins; he then touches the Stonehenge Stone, which destroys Creedence.  The family returns home, where Joshua's mother is seen eating food from the refrigerator. The food, unknown to the family, has been poisoned by the family of goblins who took over their home during their exchange in the country. The film ends with Joshua walking in on a group of goblins eating his mother's green, bloated torso off of the kitchen counter and offering him a bite. Joshua screams in horror.

The Two Jakes
 In [[Los Angeles]] in 1948, Julius "Jake" Berman hires [[private investigator]] J. J. "Jake" Gittes to catch his wife, Kitty, in the act of committing [[adultery]].  During the sting, Berman kills his rival, who also happens to be his business partner in a [[real estate]] development company.  Gittes, not having known this, suddenly finds himself under scrutiny for his role in the possible crime, all of which centers around a [[wire recording]] that captured the illicit love meeting, the confrontation, and the killing of Mark Bodine.  It calls into question if Berman knew and killed his partner to wrest control of the partnership, making it murder, or was an act of jealousy, which may qualify as "temporary insanity" and be permitted as a defense to a charge of murder.  Gittes must convince LAPD captain Escobar that he should not be charged as an accomplice.  Oddly, Berman seems unconcerned with the possibility that he may be accused of murder.  Gittes has the recording, which Berman's attorney, Cotton Weinberger, and mobster friend Mickey Nice, both want, locked in a safe in his office in L.A., which is being rocked by earthquakes.  Berman's housing development in the Valley also is experiencing seismic activities.  Gittes is nearly killed in a gas explosion, waking to find Berman and wife, Kitty, standing over him.  Gittes has a confrontation, and later a sexual encounter, with Lilian Bodine, the dead man's angry widow.  He is presented with proof that Earl Rawley, a wealthy and ruthless oil man, may be drilling under the Bodine and Berman development, though Rawley has denied it.  This leads to a need to determine who owns the mineral rights to the land.  Gittes discovers that the rights are owned by one Katherine Mulwray, daughter of Evelyn Mulwray, his love interest from twelve years prior.  He also discovers that the deed transfers were executed in such a way as to attempt to hide Katherine Mulwray's prior ownership and continued claim of the mineral rights.  Gittes operatives have seen Berman in the company of a blond woman along with Mickey, and a bodyguard.  With a bit of sleuthing Gittes determines that the woman is an oncologist and is treating Berman for cancer somewhere below the waist. Gittes confronts Berman with this knowledge and gets a full confession.  Along the way, Gittes discovers that Berman is not going to survive and the entire set-up was to ensure that Kitty was protected once he died.  In order to get Kitty to talk to him, Gittes must prove that Berman set out to kill his partner.  Once accomplished, Kitty agrees to meet Gittes and tell him what she knows about Berman.  In the process of discussing Berman's possible motivations, mineral rights, and the possible whereabouts of Katherine, it is revealed that Kitty and Katherine are the same person.  Kitty had never suspected that her husband is dying.  In order to prove premeditation, passion, and perhaps even connections to a woman long missing, seemingly everyone wants the recording, which Gittes refuses to give up until the day of the inquest. Somehow, Gittes edits the recording, leaving Katherine's name chopped out of the dialog, shooting, and aftermath of Lillian's murder.  This makes the inquest a short, satisfying meeting where the judge has no reason to suspect murder, and Berman is now free of criminal charges. Confronted with the knowledge Gittes has of his terminal illness, Berman, knowing the model house he is in is filled with natural gas, convinces Gittes and Mickey to leave him alone in the house so he can "have a smoke." He doesn't want an autopsy to interfere with Kitty's inheritance. As they drive off, the house explodes.  The story ends with Kitty and Gittes in his office. They speak of regrets, and Kitty kisses Gittes, who rejects her advances, saying "That's your problem, kid. You don't know who you're kidding." She leaves, telling him to "Think of me time to time".  Gittes tells her, "It never goes away."  
Two Evil Eyes
  ==="The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"=== Jessica Valdemar, an attractive 40-year-old woman, rides in a taxi to the downtown Pittsburgh office of Steven Pike, her elderly husband’s lawyer, with some paperwork for Mr. Pike's approval. Pike sees that Jessica’s 65-year-old husband named Ernest Valdemar, who is dying from an unnamed terminal illness, is liquidating a number of his assets for cash and suspects Jessica of having undue influence on him. Jessica denies the allegations that she is any negative influence over her husband, while Pike makes a phone call to the house to talk with Ernest Valdemar, who speaks over the phone in a weak but coherent voice explaining about his decision to let Jessica take control of his money and assets from his personal signature on the written documents that she has. Pike reluctantly agrees to let Jessica have access to the money, but warns her that if anything were to happen to Mr. Valdemar within the next three weeks before the transfer of his estate over to Jessica is finalized, she will be investigated by the authorities.  Jessica returns home to Ernest Valdemar’s large suburban mansion where she meets with Dr. Robert Hoffman where it is revealed that he and Jessica have been conspiring to cheat the terminally ill Mr. Valdemar out of his estate by hypnotizing him and having him do what they wish from his deathbed.  Jessica doesn’t like the procedure, but Robert wants it done because he used to have a romance with Jessica and wants to run off with her after they acquire his $3 million assets. The next day, Jessica goes to a bank where she withdraws $300,000 and stores it in a safe. Robert sees this. But then, Mr. Valdemar goes into cardiac arrest and dies while under another hypnosis spell. Not wanting to reveal his death just yet, Robert and Jessica carry his body to the basement where they hide it in a freezer. But during the night, Jessica becomes frightened when she hears moaning coming from the basement, but when she tries to wake up Robert, he has put himself under a hypnotic-induced slumber to help him sleep.  The next morning, Jessica and Robert wake up and also hear the same noises coming from the basement. Upon checking the body, they hear Ernest Valdemar’s voice coming from the still body claiming that his soul is alive and trapped in a dark void between the living and the dead while under hypnosis. Valdemar tells them that he sees "others" in the dark void looking at him. While Jessica goes out to make sense of this situation, she returns to find Robert talking to Mr. Valdemar’s undead corpse who tells him that the "others" are vengeful spirits trapped in a realm and want to use him to enter our world. Valdemar tells Robert to wake him up and free him from his hypnotic state. In a panic, Jessica shoots Valdemar’s corpse and wants to bury the body and skip town with the money they have. While Robert heads outside to dig a hole to bury the body, Jessica goes back into the cellar only to find Valdemar’s body rising up out of the freezer and walking towards her saying that he is under control of "the others" to use him. Jessica shoots him, but he keeps on coming. Robert enters the house when he hears the gunshots and sees Jessica and Valdemar struggling on the balcony where the undead walking cadaver shoots Jessica in the head and she falls off the balcony, dead.  Robert finally tells Valdemar that he’s going to wake him and free him from his hypnosis. But after doing so by counting to five, Valdemar tells Robert that it's too late to wake him, for without his body as a conduit, the Others cannot return to their realm. "They're with you now!" exclaims Valdemar, who finally falls dead. Robert then steals all the cash that Jessica had stored in the safe and flees the house. Robert goes back to his apartment in downtown Pittsburgh, where he puts himself under a hypnotic sleep. Shortly after, the ghostly "Others" enter his apartment and kill him by shoving the hypnotic digital counter into his chest. The ghosts then form themselves into one large mass-like mist and enter Robert's dead body.  Several days later, the police led by Detective Grogan arrive at Robert’s apartment to answer complaints about a "strange smell" and constant moaning coming from the apartment. Grogan finds the apartment ransacked and the stolen cash scattered everywhere. But just then, the horribly decomposed body of Robert, under the control of the Others, appears and attacks Grogan, while telling him that there is nobody to wake him up and that he is trapped forever.  ==="The Black Cat"=== Rod Usher makes his entrance in a building decorated with the abject remains of dismantled corpses. A naked woman lies bound to a table, sliced in two by a huge pendulum-like blade. Rod is a professional crime scene photographer for as he puts it: "still life’s my art," a talent which ensures that he is frequently called upon the local authorities—led by Detective LeGrand—to document the horrors of the baroque crime scenes which are apparently commonplace in Pittsburgh where Rod lives.  After arriving home at a semi-fancy row house, Rod works in his darkroom in the basement developing the photos when his work is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious black cat, which has apparently been adopted by his live-in girlfriend Annabel. Rod and Annabel’s relationship is uncomfortably distant. Annabel is delicate, sensitive, and somewhat ethereal, while Rod is a rough, burly, brutish man who seem more at home with the gritty hyper-reality of crime scenes that he is with Annabel’s talk of witches and superstition. Annabel, in contrast to Rod, is a professional violinist who gives private lessons to local high school students who show up at the house after their school classes, and she even takes some of them on excursions to local opera houses to watch the arts of life.  Over the next several days, a strong antipathy grows between Rod and the mysterious cat, a situation worsened by Annabel’s excessive protection of it. Driven to distraction by the cat’s apparent hatred of him, Rod eventually strangles it during a photo shoot he has set up with the cat being the center of attention. Rod then uses the photos of him strangling the cat to post on the cover of his newest photography book, titled ''Metropolitan Horrors'', a lurid collection of his most revolting pictures. As Annabel begins to guess the truth about what has happened to her pet, the couple embarks on a series of violent arguments, one of which ends with Rod falling into an alcohol-induced sleep where he has a nightmare about participating in a Medieval Pagan festival where he is executed for the murder of the cat.  One day, when Annabel finally spots his book in a shop window, with the strangled body of her much-loved cat on the front cover, she immediately goes home and makes plans to leave Rod, who at that very moment is in a local bar drinking heavily. Rod becomes unnerved when the barmaid Eleanora gives him a stray black cat, which is identical to Annabel’s own cat. Rod notices that the inky feline has an identical white marking on its chest (an obscure white patch which seems to resemble the shape of a gallows). Rod brings the cat home and sets about to kill the feline once and for all. But Annabel intervenes and comes to the cat's rescue, causing a confrontation which ends in her gruesome and gory death when Rod hacks her to death with a meat cleaver. After shaking off his suspicious next door neighbor and landlord, Mr. Pym, who arrives after hearing the argument, Rod assures him that nothing is wrong.  Confident that he can escape detection, Rod conceals the body behind a wall in the house and invents a story to explain Annabel’s disappearance to her music students, Betty and Christian, when they show up the next day for their violin lessons.  But after a confrontation with Christian, who expresses doubt and suspicion to Rod about his story of Annabel leaving him, he confides in Mr. and Mrs. Pym about his suspicions that Rod might have killed Annabel. When Annabel’s friend in New York keeps phoning the house to ask of her whereabouts, Rod becomes increasingly trapped by his own increasing elaborate web of lies. The situation is exacerbated by yet another appearance of the black cat from behind the wall. But this time, Rod ensures its death by slicing it in two with a saw, and disposes of it in a garbage dump.  The next day, Detective LeGrand arrives with his partner to question Rod about Annabel’s whereabouts. Despite their stern questioning, Rod is not fazed by their questions. After looking around the house, the detectives leave, but immediately come back when an eerie, distorted mewing sound is heard echoing though one of the walls. Rod is handcuffed and the fake wall he put up is torn down and his crime scene is gruesomely revealed: the ever troublesome feline had given birth in Annabel’s tomb and its offspring are now feasting on the remains of their mistress. Not to be outdone, Rod grabs the pickaxe from LeGrand's partner and in seconds kills both policemen. Handcuffed and in panic, Rod tries to make his escape when his neighbors show up after hearing the commotion, pounding on the front door. Rod attempts to flee from his house by climbing out a second floor window by using a rope to tie around a tree in his backyard. But his plan fails when he gets tangled in the rope and slips, the rope tightening around his neck, asphyxiating and killing him. The black cat makes a final appearance, and stares at the fate Rod had coming for him.  
Ultra Warrior
 A failed space based defense system kills millions in a nuclear disaster. In the subsequent chaos, the wealthy developed cities run by brutal military fascists, while the poor roam the radioactive deserts created by the nuclear [[fallout]]. Many turn to extreme violence and slavery to survive. The weaker mutated victims of these violent bandits are called Muties.  In 2058 Kansas City, Rudolph Kenner is staying at a casino/strip bar when he receives a message notifying him that a zirconium mine on Mars was lost to rebel forces. He is ordered to complete his mission and to take care of his trainee, Phil, the son of a zirconium business leader. The next morning, Kenner, Phil, and Phil’s girlfriend Sheila, head east to Oblivion, a desolate area once known as the Atlantic seaboard.  Kenner finds a young Mutie stuck in a trap and returns her to her colony. While he is there bandits attack the colony, killing Phil and capturing Kenner and Sheila. Kenner is taken to a bandit base, the Colosseum. He is brought before Bishop, the leader of the bandits, who knows Kenner’s mission and plans to kill him during a gladiator battle. Fortunately, Kenner escapes from the base with a group of Muties in a bandits’ car.  Later, Kenner explains to Grace, one of the Muties, about his mission. He is to take radioactivity readings to see if they can zirconium around Oblivion. The precious mineral is important in fighting aliens from a parallel universe who transforms planets into stars. To thwart them, scientists developed a zirconium bomb which was used to destroy an alien starship. Kenner's mission is to find more zirconium. When Kenner asks about Grace’s family, she explains her parents were eaten by subterranean, cannibalistic mutants called “Whities”.  Eventually, Kenner and the Muties make their way back to camp, which is soon attacked by bandits. However, Kenner sits in the open and draws the bandits into the Mutie shelter. Meanwhile, the Muties hijack the bandits’ vehicles and Kenner escapes. The Muties demolish their shelter, crushing the bandits inside. They capture Elijah, a stranger who was helping the bandits and who Kenner encountered earlier.  The Mutie spiritual leader, Uncle Lazarus, puts Kenner in charge and reveals that he is part of an unfolding prophecy. Later, Uncle Lazarus kills himself. Initially, Kenner is reluctant about his new role but soon adapts to it.  The Bishop calls the bandit patrol over on one of the vehicles' radio and Kenner answers back, pretending to be a bandit. He then decides to take the hijacked convoy to the Colosseum disguised as a patrol. Later, Kenner and Grace talk about the world Kenner comes from and the two make love.  The band of Muties arrive at the Colosseum, but Elijah runs screaming out of the convoy and is shot. A firefight erupts between the Muties and the bandits. Kenner finds Sheila along with other prisoners, and then searches for the Bishop. Kenner and the Muties are ambushed by the bandits. They finally corner Bishop and discover he is actually a Mutie himself. During this confrontation, the Bishop escapes.  In the end, Kenner writes back to his employers stating the conditions in Oblivion are too radioactive to mine, so they would have to buy the zirconium from the resident Muties. Grace tells Kenner she does not feel at home in the city, and Kenner agrees. The film ends with them driving back into Oblivion.

The Voice of the Moon
 With a nod to the lunar-obsessed lyrics of Italian poet [[Giacomo Leopardi]],<ref>A portrait of Leopardi hangs in Ivo's childhood bedroom while a large Pinocchio puppet stands in a corner.</ref> the acerbic tale focuses on the capture of the moon by the Micheluzzi Brothers while Ivo, newly released from a mental hospital, tries to seduce Aldina Ferruzzi with whom he's infatuated. Although she wants nothing to do with him, Ivo equates her blond beauty with the moon, the origin of his madness and frustration. During the attempts to woo her, he meets various madcap characters including an oboist who sleeps in the local cemetery, a man whose hobby is meditating on rooftops, and Gonnella, the ex-prefect fired for his rising paranoia. Gonnella makes Ivo his lieutenant and together they investigate the "wild conspiracies" going on around them.  The oddball pair attends a farcical beauty pageant where Aldina is crowned "Miss Flour of 1989" and ends up lost in the farmlands among graceful African women chanting in the moonlight. Inside an abandoned warehouse, they discover an Inferno-like disco of fashion victims dancing and bopping deliriously to Michael Jackson's "The Way You Make Me Feel." Ivo realises that Aldina's shoe, obtained surreptitiously, fits every Cinderella who tries it on. To the dancers' stupefaction, Gonnella orchestrates a waltz but is thrown out after smashing the disc jockey's cache of records.  Meanwhile, the three demented Micheluzzi brothers have caught the moon using gigantic farming equipment and roped it down in a stable. What ought to be a sacred event becomes a squandered opportunity as priests and politicians turn it into a conference for official propaganda voiced to the assembled public. The conference rapidly degenerates into violence by a madman with a pistol screaming, "What am I doing here? Why was I put here in the first place?" leaving Ivo Salvini with the film's last words: "If we all quieted down a little, maybe we'd understand something."  
Vincent & Theo
 ''Vincent & Theo'' has a prelude, which is documentary footage of the 1987 auction of one of Vincent van Gogh's paintings at [[Christie's]], a famed London art business. The painting sells for millions of pounds. The film then cuts to scenes that take place in the period from 1883 through 1891, commencing with Vincent van Gogh's decision to work exclusively as an artist, and concluding with his death and that of his brother Theo a few months later. The film is a double portrait of both men; Noel Murray has summarised this aspect, "Altman and screenwriter Julian Mitchell contrast Theo's life—which mostly consists of him guiding rich people through galleries and selling them paintings he despises—with Vincent's gradual development of his own voice and style, through hard physical labor. ''Vincent & Theo'' also shows both men as warped by a similar madness, torn between their lusts for sex and alcohol, and their yearnings for social respectability and religious connection."<ref name=Murray></ref>  The film portrays several of the better-known episodes of this period of the brothers' lives, including Vincent van Gogh's move from his brother's apartment in Paris to Provence, Theo van Gogh's establishment of an art gallery in Paris and his marriage to [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo Bonger]], Vincent van Gogh's relationship with the painter [[Paul Gauguin]] in Provence, his mutilation of his earlobe, the birth of their son Vincent Willem to Johanna and Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh's care by the physician [[Paul Gachet]], and his ultimate suicide.

However, immediately after Abbas and the terrorists have left for [[Tunis]] aboard of an Egyptian plane, Klinghoffer's execution is discovered by the authorities (since Molqi had forced the ''Achille Lauro''s Captain to lie about the murder in front of the negotiators, since the condition for negotiate was his word that all of the passengers were alive), and at that point [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] orders to a couple of [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] and a [[Delta Force]]'s division led by General Daevis to intercept the plane, force it to land in the [[Naval Air Station Sigonella|Sicilian NATO base of Sigonella]] and then arrest the terrorists.  Unfortunately, when the plane successfully lands in Sigonella, the [[Italian Army]], by order of the Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]], refuses to hand over the terrorists to the Americans, since the base is located on the Italian soil and the murder itself has happened aboard of an Italian ship.  For an entire night the tension rises, with the Italian [[Carabinieri]] and the American Delta Force that almost reach the point to shoot each other, but at the end President Raegan has no choice but accept the Italian jurisdiction over the terrorists. Molqi and his three companions are then taken in custody by the Italians, while Abu Abbas is left free to leave the Country, despite the American request to arrest him too, since there are not enough proofs of his involvement in the hijacking.  The terrorists will be sentenced by seventeen from thirty years of prison, while Abu Abbas will be arrested in 2003 in Iraq and will die in prison in US one year later in strange circumstances.

Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael
 The film's main character is a 15-year-old girl named Dinky Bossetti (Ryder). Dinky was [[Adoption|adopted]] as a baby. She appears to have little acceptance in her social circle, although it is not obvious which came first - her antisocial attitude or her being rejected by her peers. Her adoptive mother is disappointed that the daughter she chose has no interest in "feminine" things, such as makeup and nice clothing. Her classmates ostracize, taunt, and throw things at her regularly. Dinky finds solace in her "Ark", a small cabin-boat beached on a lake shore. In and around the boat, Dinky has collected a menagerie of abandoned animals.  As the story begins, Dinky is befriended by a new school guidance counselor, who recognizes her intelligence and spirit. Dinky becomes convinced that she is the abandoned daughter of Roxy Carmichael, a minor film star who left town for Hollywood 15 years ago after giving birth to a baby girl out of wedlock. Miss Carmichael has been invited to return to town to assist in the dedication of a new municipal building, and she has accepted. The news of her return stirs up old jealousies and insecurities: old schoolmates start acting in irrational ways, while Denton Webb ([[Jeff Daniels]]), the husband she abandoned when she left town, becomes so obsessed by the idea of her return that his wife moves out.  As the date for Roxy's return draws nearer, Dinky becomes more and more desperate to prove that she is Roxy's daughter, visiting the star's childhood home (which is maintained as a museum), and obsessively questioning Denton about what happened the night she left, believing that Roxy will take her away to a new life. On the day that Roxy is due to arrive, Dinky packs her suitcase and arrives at the welcoming ceremony in a beautiful dress. Her adoptive mother has invited representatives from a foster home so she can send Dinky away, but her husband (who has been silent around his strident, unloving spouse) leaves in disgust and angrily tells her "I'm going find Dinky. I'm going to FIND OUR DAUGHTER." A limousine draws up, but a man gets out with a note of explanation: Roxy has not come back. Before the limousine can drive away, Dinky runs after it. Denton catches up with her and tells her the whole story (having realized the reason for Dinky's obsession with Roxy): although Roxy did have a baby, and did leave it with him, the baby died. Roxy is not Dinky's mother.  Left with nothing, Dinky is rescued by Gerald Howells, a popular boy who has become increasingly interested in her. At first, Dinky is suspicious of his interest, but the end of the film shows them together in a relationship where she finally holds the upper hand as things return to normal in the town.

The Week of the Sphinx
      
White Palace (film)
 27-year-old St. Louis advertising executive, Max Baron ([[James Spader]]), has completely shut himself off from the world in the two years since the auto accident that killed his wife Janey ([[Maria Pitillo]]). On the way to his friend Neil's ([[Jason Alexander]]) bachelor party, Max picks up 50 burgers from a diner called White Palace. At the party, he discovers that the order is six burgers short and, to the ridicule of his friends, returns to the restaurant to complain. In a moment that defines his initial character, Max declares, "It's the principle."  He is roundly mocked by his cohorts.  At the White Palace diner, after a heated exchange occurs between Max and a 43-year-old waitress, Nora Baker ([[Susan Sarandon]]), she exasperatedly refunds him. Max returns to the party but leaves upset and heads to a bar, where he runs into Nora. Drunk, she flirts with him, but he pushes her advances away and starts to leave. She senses he's upset, asks why, and discovers his wife died in a car crash. She discloses that she lost her young son to [[leukemia]]. The 'connection' prevents him from leaving. They have a few drinks and eventually he gives her a lift home to the Dogtown neighborhood in St. Louis, but drunkenly crashes his car into her mailbox. She invites him to spend the night at her house, with the couch as his bed. Max starts dreaming about his late wife, then wakes up to find Nora performing [[fellatio]] on him. They end up having passionate sex.  After visiting his wife's grave on the second anniversary of her death, Max returns to White Palace to watch a busy Nora from a distance.  He visits her at home with the pretext of replacing the broken mailbox, but instead they begin a relationship. Max becomes more relaxed and cheerful around Nora and at his work, but remains reluctant to reveal their relationship to his family and friends. At one point, he gets frustrated that all he and Nora do are sit and watch TV in her house. She firmly reminds him of their differences in age and social backgrounds.  Nora is angry after Max has lied to her about his friend Neil's wedding and that he didn't take her. They argue about how Max keeps their relationship a secret and that he is probably ashamed of being seen with her. Nora's sister, Judy ([[Eileen Brennan]]), meets Max the following day and explains to him, in Nora's absence, how they were abandoned as children and that she left a young Nora to fend for herself. Judy also explains that Nora's son drowned.   While at the supermarket with Nora, Max leaves her at the counter and runs into Neil's wife, Rachel ([[Rachel Chagall]]), who invites him and his "mystery woman" to Thanksgiving. At Max's apartment, Nora hears a message on his answering machine inviting them to the Horowitzes' home for Thanksgiving. Nora brings up the subject to an initially hesitant Max; however, they resolve to attend as a couple. At the Thanksgiving dinner with Neil, Rachel, Mrs. Baron ([[Renee Taylor]]), Max's friends, and the Horowitz extended family make Nora uncomfortable. Following an argument between Nora and Neil's father, she walks out, Max and his mother following. After the dinner, Nora and Max argue in her house over what had happened and she tells him to leave.  Some time later, Max finds Nora's house empty and a note explaining to him that she left and that he shouldn't come looking for her. He visits White Palace and is informed that Nora quit. He goes to a brunch with friends and meets Heidi Solomon ([[Kim Myers]]), but cannot stop thinking about Nora. He then realizes that everyone around him seem stuck-up with their "perfect" upper-middle class lives. He travels to New York to find Judy and is informed that Nora is waitressing in a restaurant. Max finds Nora there and confesses his love to her, revealing that he quit his job and moved to New York to be with her. They reunite, kissing tenderly as patrons of the restaurant look on. Max playfully clears the table of its contents and lays a laughing Nora down on it, climbing on top of her and passionately kissing her, while the whole restaurant cheers and applauds.

Wheels of Terror
 The film opens on a desert highway in Arizona, where a man and his daughter have broken down on the side of the road. After a truck does not stop to help them, they are then approached by a dirt-covered black 1974 Dodge Charger with a 383 V8. The driver of the Charger (who is never seen) then strikes the man, killing him, before backing up and abducting the screaming girl. Later, the girl is seen walking down the deserted highway, with signs of being assaulted. She is then spotted by two highway patrol officers, who put her in the back of their police car and take her to the hospital.   Meanwhile, in the nearby town of Copper Valley, Laura (Cassidy) is a newly hired [[bus driver]] who has moved from Los Angeles, California in hopes of the small town being a better place to raise her daughter, Stephanie (Leeds). One day, she encounters the black Charger as she is taking kids home from school on a 1982 Chevy G30 Wayne Busette with a Chevy small-block engine. Shortly afterwards, the driver follows a young girl home and abducts her. The girl is sexually assaulted, but is later found alive, although clearly traumatized by what has happened. As the driver of the car continuously stalks Laura, it soon abducts Stephanie's friend Kim who is later found dead, floating in a nearby lake.  Laura visits the police station and talks with Detective Drummond (Snyder), who says that in spite of all of the searches, nobody claims to have seen the car or its driver. The night after Kim's funeral, the Charger reappears in front of Laura's house. As Laura tries to contact the detective, the driver continues to rev his engine and drive around the front of the house, but soon drives away into the night. The following day, Stephanie is waiting on her mother to pick her up from gymnastics practice, but Laura is delayed by a passing freight train. As Laura arrives, the Charger appears and abducts Stephanie in front of her, prompting her to give chase, with kids still on the bus.  After pursuing the car through town and down dirt roads, Laura loses sight of the car and is pulled over by a [[motorcycle cop]]. While the officer is talking to Laura and calling for backup, the car reappears and rams the cop, killing him instantly. The driver then speeds away with Stephanie leaning out the window, crying for help. Laura resumes the chase after the car, despite the kids continuously pleading for her to slow down. Soon, the bus nearly drives off the edge of a cliff near a train bridge. As Laura tries to restart the bus and put it in reverse, the car appears behind the bus and rams it repeatedly, trying to send it over the edge, but Laura manages to start up the bus and back it away from the edge, making the chase resume once again.  Laura chases the car to a construction site and lets the kids off, asking them to call the police at a nearby trailer. After a long hunt, the car appears and tries to run Laura down when she gets out of the bus, but she manages to climb aboard and continue the chase. As they rumble into a quarry, Laura rams the car repeatedly, but is unsuccessful at stopping it. Finally, after a lengthy chase around the quarry, Stephanie manages to climb out of the Charger and climb onto the bus to her mother. Laura then rams the Charger and sends it tumbling over the edge of a cliff. Laura and Stephanie are tearfully reunited, however, just when it seems that the whole ordeal is ending, the car unexpectedly reappears and accelerates straight towards the bus.   Laura manages to restart the bus and reverse out of the path of the speeding Charger, causing the car to fly off of a cliff and drop down the into the quarry. The car lands in a small storage building full of explosives, resulting in an explosion which incinerates the car and the driver.  In the ending scene, Laura and Stephanie are seen boarding the school bus and driving off into the sunset.

Wild at Heart (film)
 Lovers Lula ([[Laura Dern]]) and Sailor ([[Nicolas Cage]]) are separated after he is jailed for killing a man who attacked him with a knife; the assailant, Bobby Ray Lemon, was hired by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune ([[Diane Ladd]]). Upon Sailor's release, Lula picks him up at the prison where she hands him his [[snakeskin]] jacket. They go to a hotel where she reserved a room, make love and go to see the [[speed metal]] band [[Powermad]]. At the club, Sailor gets into a fight with a man who flirts with Lula, and then leads the band in a rendition of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]". Later, back in the room, after making love again, Sailor and Lula finally decide to run away to [[California]], breaking Sailor's [[parole]]. Marietta arranges for private detective Johnnie Farragut ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]) – her on-off boyfriend – to find them and bring them back. Unbeknownst to Farragut, however, Marietta also hires gangster Marcello Santos ([[J. E. Freeman]]) to track them and kill Sailor. Santos's minions capture and kill Farragut, sending Marietta into a guilt-fueled [[psychosis]].  Unaware of all of the events happening back in [[North Carolina]], Lula and Sailor continue on their way until – according to Lula – they witness a bad omen: the aftermath of a two-car accident, and the only survivor, a young woman, dies in front of them. With little money left, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he contacts "old friend" Perdita Durango ([[Isabella Rossellini]]), who might be able to help them, although she secretly knows he is under contract to be killed by Lula's mother. While Sailor agrees to join up with gangster Bobby Peru ([[Willem Dafoe]]) in a feed store robbery, Lula waits for him in the hotel room, trying to conceal that she is pregnant with Sailor's child. While Sailor is out Peru enters the room and forces Lula to implore him to make love with her, but in the end he refuses, stating he has no time. This traumatizes Lula, who was raped as a child.  The robbery goes spectacularly wrong when Peru unnecessarily shoots the two clerks. Peru then admits to Sailor he's been hired to kill him and Sailor realizes he has been given a pistol with dummy ammunition. Chasing Sailor out of the store, Peru is about to kill him when the sheriff's deputy opens fire on him and Peru accidentally blows his own head off with his own shotgun. Sailor is arrested and sentenced to six years in prison.  While Sailor is in jail, Lula has their child. Upon his release Lula decides to reunite with him. Rejecting her mother's objections over the phone, she throws water over her mother's photograph and goes to pick up Sailor with their son. When they meet Sailor, he reveals he will be leaving them both, having decided while in prison that he isn't good enough for them. While he is walking a short distance away, Sailor encounters a gang who surround him. He insults them and they quickly knock him out. While unconscious, he sees a vision in the form of [[Glinda the Good Witch]], who tells him, "Don't turn away from love, Sailor". When he awakens, he apologizes to the men, tells them he realizes the error of his ways, then runs after Lula. The photograph of Marietta in Lula's house sizzles and vanishes. As there is a traffic jam on the road, Sailor begins to run over the roofs and hoods of the cars to get back to Lula and their child in the car. Sailor sings "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]" to Lula, having earlier said that he would only sing that song to his wife.  
Wilt (film)
  Henry Wilt is a [[community studies]] teacher at a poorly funded college where most of the pupils seem to be fairly apathetic to learning. Eva Wilt, his wife, is interested in the spiritual aspects of [[martial arts]], [[Transcendental Meditation]] and similar pursuits.  Eva's disdain for Henry's interest in reading adds to his general frustration at work, including being turned down for a promotion again, and leads him to occasionally fantasize about killing her. Her '[[Yuppie]]' friends, Hugh Westroper and his beautiful, glamorous wife Sally, only exacerbate his alienation from her world by talking disparagingly about teaching as a profession and about his car.  While he is walking home and speaking out one of his fantasies, he crosses paths with a botched sting operation by the incompetent Inspector Flint, whose wire has fallen off while trying to bust a drug dealer.  Wilt intervenes in the resulting struggle and, thinking he is witnessing a mugging, unknowingly helps the drug dealer to get away.  Soon afterward, a construction worker at the school sees what looks like a woman's body in a hole being filled with concrete. Meanwhile, Henry Wilt has had to get a lift into work as apparently he had had an accident in his car the previous night. Inspector Flint arrives at the school as they start work on digging out the body. Some papers are found at the hole where the body was seen, and a brief search identifies the writer of those papers as Henry Wilt.  Evidence against Wilt mounts as he makes a phone call to his home from the police station and pretends the answerphone is his wife while Inspector Flint is present at Wilt's house.  During the interview, Wilt initially claims that he and his wife had an argument, and she disappeared and he has no idea where she is. Inspector Flint superficially accepts this explanation and tells him he can go, only to be confronted at the door by an old woman who claims to have seen him repeatedly stab a woman to death. Returning to the interview again, Wilt starts to go into more detail about the night of the party.  It is revealed that at the party Henry and Eva argued as normal and that Sally is sexually interested in Eva. While arguing with Sally, Henry managed to knock himself unconscious opening a door that turns out to be a cupboard. When he woke up, he was naked and tied to a blow-up [[sex doll]]. Eva walked in on him trying to burst the doll by writhing around, and also saw him appearing at a balcony above the disco in front of almost everyone at the party. After these incidents, Eva refused to return home with Henry.  On the way home, Wilt found that the doll had been put on the back seat of his car; distracted, he crashed into a telephone box. Losing his temper, he pulled the doll out of the car and tried to burst it by stabbing it repeatedly, but failed. He was spotted doing this by the old lady who identified him later at the police station. Wilt then headed to the school and dumped the doll down the same hole where the corpse was found.  Back in the present, Inspector Flint follows the lead to Sally and Hugh's mansion, to find that they have also disappeared.  They also find a knotted stocking at the scene, the signature of the notorious Swaffham Strangler.  Flint takes Wilt down to the morgue where they claim to have found Eva's body, although it actually turns out to be another sex doll. It turns out that Flint is only on such an important case because the far more competent Inspector Farmiloe is on holiday and that it is generally agreed that this is a chance for Flint to gain a promotion.  The next day, they are preparing to bring up the body in front of a huge crowd of students and other members of the public, much to Wilt's amusement.  Unfortunately for the college, this also coincides with the visit of a group of [[Japan]]ese businessmen who are being courted to sponsor the college. The body, encased in concrete, is lifted out but slips free and is dropped onto the bonnet of a police car, cracking the cement and freeing the blow-up doll for all to see, much to Inspector Flint's chagrin. Undaunted, Flint determines that the whole doll incident is just an attempt by Wilt to cover up the actual murders of Eva, Sally and Hugh.  After many hours of interrogation, Wilt changes his story and starts telling Flint of his later return to the mansion on the night of the party. He claims to have attacked the alleged victims with a chainsaw and disposed of the bodies at the meat factory where many of the students work. Flint launches a search using massive amounts of manpower to find the evidence of this before his superior points out that Wilt signed his confession "[[Sweeney Todd]]". Following this, Wilt is released, although his wife and her friends are still missing.  Meanwhile, Eva has been stuck on a small yacht on a mudbank in the middle of a lake with Sally and Hugh, where Hugh finally tells her that Sally arranged the whole farce with the doll, intending to get Eva to split from her husband so that she would go on the trip and give Sally the opportunity to pursue her interest in her. Eva, realizing how she has been duped, immediately leaves the boat using a small inflatable swimming ring and finds her way to a vicarage where she calls Wilt to get him to pick her up. She meets the vicar, who has apparently only recently moved to this location from Swaffham and happens to have a knotted stocking in his top pocket.  Wilt, originally reluctant to go get Eva, hitchhikes to the village, just in time to find the vicar about to strangle Eva in the cemetery. Unfortunately, as he tries to intervene, Inspector Flint – who has followed him from his house – confronts him with a shotgun. Wilt hits him with the shovel he has been given by Flint to "dig up his wife's body", knocks him into an open grave and heads into the church where his wife has fled followed by the vicar ("If anybody's going to kill my wife, it's going to be me!"). Eva temporarily fights off the vicar using her martial arts knowledge. Flint arrives, ignoring the vicar, to arrest Wilt for the murder of Sally and Hugh, who happen to arrive covered in mud, at that moment. Flint then tries to arrest him for the murder of Eva, who of course is present as well. Finally cracking up, he arrests himself, reading himself his rights.  The vicar, while trying to escape, is knocked out by a golf ball hit by Inspector Farmiloe and taken into custody.  The story finishes with Henry Wilt reconciled with Eva and meeting Flint in his wife's new martial arts class; Flint has had to leave the force and join a private security firm which insists on his taking the class as a refresher course. Conversely the Japanese investors in the college are impressed with the way Wilt has dealt with the adversity and had him promoted to Department Head ("In Japan, I'd be made a god").  
The Witches (1990 film)
 During a vacation with his grandmother Helga in Norway, Luke Eveshim is warned about "real" witches, female demons with a genocidal hatred for children, all of whom emit an odor obnoxious to witches. Helga tells him that her childhood friend fell victim to a witch and cursed to spend the rest of her life trapped inside a painting. After Luke's parents are killed in a car accident, Helga becomes Luke's legal guardian and they move to England. While building a treehouse, Luke is accosted by a witch, though he sees through her ruse and avoids his potential death, hiding at the top of the tree. On Luke's ninth birthday, Helga falls ill with diabetes. Her doctor advises them to spend the summer by the sea.  They stay at a seaside resort, where Luke meets and befriends a gluttonous but friendly boy named Bruno Jenkins, while getting on the bad side of the hotel manager, Mr. Stringer, after his pet mice frighten a maid who is having an affair with the manager. Also staying at the hotel are a convention of witches, masquerading as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, with the [[Grand High Witch]], the all-powerful leader of the world's witches, attending their annual meeting.  Luke inadvertently discovers the witches while playing with his pet mice inside the ballroom, where the witches hold their meeting. The Grand High Witch unveils her latest weapon: a magic potion to turn children into mice, which they will use on confectionery products in sweet shops and candy stores to be opened using money provided by the Grand High Witch. Having already been given chocolate laced with the formula a few hours earlier, Bruno is lured into the room, turns into a mouse and flees. Luke attempts to escape and runs to Helga in their room, but finds her resting after having a dizzy spell. He is kidnapped and is forced to drink a potion, turning him into a mouse, though he avoids being squashed. He finds Bruno and reunites with Helga, who has since recovered.  Luke devises a plan to kill the witches by sneaking into the Grand High Witch's room to steal a bottle of the formula. Luke manages to drop the bottle into a pot of cress soup destined for the witches' dinner tables. Mr. Jenkins also orders the soup, though Helga stops him from consuming it at the last minute. As the witches enter the dining room, Miss Irvine, the Grand High Witch's assistant who has become disillusioned by her mistress' harsh treatment of her, quits working with the witches and thus gets spared from the massacre that is about to happen. The formula turns all the witches into mice, and the staff and hotel guests join in killing them, unknowingly ridding England of its witches, as Helga returns Bruno to his parents. The Grand High Witch is spotted by Helga, who traps her under a water jug, enabling Mr. Stringer to dispatch her with a meat cleaver.  Luke and Helga return to their home, where they are delivered the Grand High Witch's trunk full of money and an address book of all witches in the United States. That night, Miss Irvine pays a visit to the house and uses her power to return Luke to his human body and return his pet mice, along with his glasses, before leaving to repeat the process with Bruno.

Wataru befriends a young man named Johnny who, prior to the incident, was part of a government experiment designed to expand the [[memory capacity]] of the [[human mind]] and, therefore, was able to retain his [[memories]].

However, as a result of the physical toll his body endured due to the government experiments, Johnny dies after encouraging Wataru to travel the world.  Wataru encounters a strange woman named Sophia after she helps him escape from an encounter with an unmanned Police Mech Unit and  agrees to take Sophia to New York City. Together the two travel to Los Angeles where they help save Sue and her father, Little John, from a mob. Sue was to be offered as a bride to appease a "god", which in reality is a Construction Mech controlled by a man, but fled to escape her fate. However, upon realizing that if she were not sacrificed another woman would be in her stead, she flees from the group to rejoin her tribe. Wataru destroys the Construction Mech but Sue is killed in the conflict. Little John remains in Los Angeles to keep order of the tribe and rebuild society.  Wataru and Sophia resume their travels only to be attacked once more by the Police Mech. Sophia rescues Wataru and brings him to an advanced city called Eternal Town for medical attention. When Wataru regains consciousness, he discovers that the city is run by a super computer that has brainwashed two of its original citizens into running the day-to-day operations of the city. The super computer attempts to persuade Sophia and Wataru into becoming citizens as well but the two escape with one of the original citizens, Lisa. As they depart from the city, Lisa begins to recall memories from her past including the fact that the other citizen who was brainwashed into running the city was her father. As a result, Lisa decides to remain in Eternal Town. Sophia then explains that she is a member of an alien race that is responsible for the wind that erased Earth's citizens' memories. Sophia makes a wager with Wataru that if he is able to convince another person to join him in his travels, she will return humanity's memory.  Wataru and Sophia are chased across the country by the unrelenting Police Mech until they reach New York City. Upon arriving, Wataru drops Sophia off in order to defeat the Police Mech by himself. After destroying the Police Mech, Sophia saves Wataru as he falls from a building. Sophia leaves in order to rejoin her race and convince them that humanity deserves to have their memories.

The Willies (film)
  === Prologue ("Camping Out") ===  Two brothers, Kyle and Josh, and their cousin, Michael ([[Sean Astin]]), gather around a campfire and decide to tell scary stories to one another, each one of which they claim to be absolutely true (in the style of [[urban legends]]). In the first ten minutes of the film (even before the opening credits), they tell a series of brief stories:  * "Tennessee Frickasee" - A woman at a fast food restaurant finds a rat in her fried chicken. * "Haunted Estate" - An old man ([[Bill Erwin]]) dies of a heart attack after experiencing the terrors of an amusement park's horror ride. * "Poodle Souffle" - An old woman puts her [[toy poodle]] in the microwave to dry off (with predictable results).  At this point, Michael says he knows a story they haven't heard of yet (Kyle asks if it's about when his friends "found the pirate ship in that old cave," a reference to Astin's earlier film ''[[The Goonies]]''), and promises that this story will give them the willies.  === "Bad Apples" ===  A young boy named Danny struggles at his school with bullies and an overbearing, impatient teacher ([[Kathleen Freeman]]). The only one who shows him any sympathy is the school custodian, Mr. Jenkins ([[James Karen]]). While on duty, Mr. Jenkins disappears in the bathroom, and Danny enters later to find Mr. Jenkins' body with a detached head, and a humanoid monster lurking in the stall. Danny tells his teacher, who goes into the bathroom to investigate, only to be killed by the monster. Danny lures the bullies into the bathroom, and they too are killed. It is soon revealed that Mr. Jenkins was the monster all the time, with his body being a disguise.  Mr. Jenkins moves to another school, where it is revealed that he is still targeting bullies.  === Interlude ===  Michael explain that his father, the brothers' Uncle Henry, knew Mr. Jenkins personally, hence the accuracy of the story. Kyle and Josh say they have an even stranger story to tell.  === "Flyboy" ===  Gordy Belcher ([[Michael Bower]]) is a reclusive, mischievous kid who often plays pranks on others, and who is overly obsessed with flies (even pinning them into positions inside a model church). He becomes fascinated with a secret manure created by Farmer Spivey, which causes crops to grow in increased sizes. He often steals the manure from the old man, much to Spivey's chagrin.  After being kicked out of the school after tricking a girl into eating flies, Gordy stops by Spivey's farm, where the old man offers him a special manure with new ingredients, as a way to "call a truce." Gordy goes home to find his mother has thrown away all his flies, save for three he kept in a hiding spot. He places them in the jar of manure which causes the flies to grow to an immense size overnight. They attack Gordy when he wakes up, and the boy's parents find him with bloody stumps where his arms and legs had been. Gordy awakes the next day with prosthetic replacements.  === Epilogue ===  The brothers explain that Gordy is now made fun of by the kids he used to pick on. Michael is incredulous, to which the brothers contend that Michael's story was far less believable. At that point, Uncle Henry arrives, and the brothers ask him to prove the story about Mr. Jenkins. Uncle Henry (also played by James Karen) then rips off his face, revealing the humanoid monster from "Bad Apples".  
Without Her Consent
 When she moves from [[Idaho]] to [[Venice, Los Angeles]] because of a new job offer, Emily Briggs (Gilbert) quickly meets Jason Barnes (Valentine), a friendly neighbor who works as a set decorator for movies. He invites her to his home in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] to pick up an old table which she can use at her new place, though abuses the meeting to [[rape]] her. Emily unsuccessfully struggles to get away, and fears for her life throughout the rape. Her cousin Marty (Bernard) insists for her to report the case, but the [[District Attorney]] denies the case because she voluntarily went to his house, and there were no witnesses present. The fact that he was arrested five times before with the same allegations does not influence the case. Emily tries to move on with her life, but finds out that she is not able to share intimacy with her boyfriend Trey Cousins (Tubb).  Sometime later, Emily receives a visit from a woman named Marcia Daily (Riker), who tells her that she was raped by Jason as well, and that all of the women were stalked by him afterwards as a way of power control. Marcia tells her that an attorney named Gloria Allred (Neuwirth) can make a case of the rape if they combine powers, but Emily is reluctant to go to court. Emily later admits to being raped to Trey, when he overhears her conversation with Marcia. Trey is upset that she went to a stranger's house and estranges from her by claiming that she was asking for the rape. He tries to avoid doing harm to Jason out of anger, but eventually runs him over with his car. Aware that her fiancé is facing a prison sentence, Emily turns to Gloria for help. Gloria agrees to take on his case, and takes Emily's rape story to the media in hopes of influencing the jury. Trey is reluctant to allow Emily's rape to become a national sensation, but the story is printed anyway on Emily's insistence.  In court, Trey is sentenced to 36 months of probation, as well as getting a [[restraining order]] against Jason's residence and having to pay for his medical expenses. He is too overwhelmed with the case and its media attention, and Emily leaves him when he admits that he is too distressed with his own problems to support her with recovering from the rape. Meanwhile, a young woman named Claire Sugarman (McCullough) steps forward to being raped by Jason as well, which enables Gloria to make a case. Emily is reluctant to go court yet again, until she grows determined to prove to everyone that she was not lying about being raped. Trey visits her in hopes of a reconciliation, but Emily tells him that she honestly does not think that he believes that she was raped.   During the trial against Jason, Emily is being battered while on the stand on being promiscuous. Their attorney hopes to break Jason by confronting him of having lied to the police about knowing Emily, though Jason lies himself out of the situation, endangering the case for Emily. Trey, convinced of regaining Emily's affection, sets out for himself to prove that Jason is guilty, and meets with Jason's neighbor Pete Raymond (Hobbs), who can serve as a witness. Emily is touched by Trey's actions, especially due to the fact that he ignored his restraining order in her sake. After Pete tells in court that Emily left his place shocked and battered, in torn clothes, Jason breaks and admits to the crime. He is sentenced to 10 years in jail, and Emily now reconciled with Trey, receives $5 million for damage repairs.  
Young Guns II
 In 1950, attorney Charles Phalen is contacted by an elderly man named "Brushy Bill" Roberts. Brushy Bill tells Phalen that he is dying and wants to receive a pardon that he was promised 70 years before by the Governor of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], claiming that he is really William H. Bonney aka "Billy The Kid", whom "everyone" knows to have been shot and killed by Pat Garrett in 1881. Phalen then asks if Bill has any proof that he is the famous outlaw.  Brushy Bill's story begins with the remaining Regulators having gone their separate ways. Billy has become part of a new gang with "Arkansas" [[Dave Rudabaugh]] ([[Christian Slater|Slater]]) and Pat Garrett ([[William L. Petersen|Petersen]]). The New Mexico governor has issued warrants for the arrests of those involved in the Lincoln County Wars, including Billy, Doc Scurlock ([[Kiefer Sutherland|Sutherland]]), and Jose Chavez y Chavez ([[Lou Diamond Phillips|Phillips]]), who are dragged into town and imprisoned to await hanging.  Meanwhile, Billy meets with the new governor Lew Wallace who agrees to pardon Billy if he testifies against the Dolan-Murphy faction. Billy soon finds out that he was tricked into being arrested with no chance of testifying against his old enemies. After escaping, Billy along with the help of Rudabaugh and Garrett, pose as a lynch mob to spring Doc and Chavez from jail. When the gang successfully escape Lincoln, Billy mentions the Mexican Blackbird (a broken trail only he and few others know that leads down to Mexico). Garrett decides not to go with the gang and, instead, open a boarding house. It is clear that Rudagaugh, in competition with Billy, wants to lead the gang.  As they make a run for the border along with farmer Henry William French ([[Alan Ruck]]) and 14-year-old Tom O'Folliard ([[Balthazar Getty]]), cattle baron John Simpson Chisum ([[James Coburn]]) and Governor Wallace approach Garrett to offer him the job as [[Lincoln County, New Mexico|Lincoln County]] [[Sheriff]] and $1000 to use whatever resources he needs to hunt Bonney down and kill him. Garrett agrees and, forming a posse, begins his pursuit of the gang.  Billy and the gang soon come to the town of White Oaks where they meet up with former companion, Jane Greathouse ([[Jenny Wright]]) who runs a local bordello. Later that night, the town lynch mob comes for the gang and are intent on a hanging. Deputy Carlisle tries to negotiate a deal, "the Indian" (Chavez) for a safe rideout. Billy refuses the offer and pushes the Deputy out the door, who is then accidentally killed by the lynch mob. Garrett soon tracks Billy to the bordello, but is too late. Billy and his gang are continuously tracked by the posse, narrowly evading capture, but Tom (being mistaken for Billy) is soon shot dead by Garrett. As they hideout, Billy admits that the Mexican Blackbird doesn't exist; it was just a pawn to get the gang back together and to keep riding. Doc is angered and tries to leave for home, but he is shot by one of Garrett's men and sacrifices himself to enable his friends to escape.  Billy the Kid is soon brought back into Lincoln by Garrett and is sentenced to death by hanging. He is visited by Jane Greathouse, who arranges to leave a pistol in an outhouse. Billy uses the pistol to kill two guards and escapes to Old [[Fort Sumner]]. By the time he arrives, Dave has abandoned the group to make his way to Mexico, and Chavez is dying from a bullet wound. During the night Garrett finds Billy unarmed. Billy asks Garrett to let him run to Mexico and tell the authorities that he killed him. Garrett declines because he believes Billy would not be able to resist coming back to the United States (which would lead to Garrett's death for lying). Billy turns around, forcing Garrett to have to shoot him in the back, which he does not. In the morning, a fake burial is staged for Billy and Garrett's horse is seen being taken by an unknown figure (implied to be Billy). Brushy Bill admits he never stole a horse from someone he didn't like, and further admits he didn't like Garrett; he loved him. Phalen, convinced that Brushy Bill is Billy the Kid, agrees to help him.  The epilogue reveals that Arkansas Dave was beheaded once he reached Mexico to discourage more outlaws from crossing the border; Garrett's book detailing his pursuit of Billy was a dismal failure and he is eventually shot and killed in 1908; Brushy Bill met with the Governor of New Mexico but despite corroboration from several surviving friends of The Kid, he was discredited and died less than a month later; whether or not Brushy Bill was Billy the Kid remains a mystery. The final shot shows Billy pointing his gun at an off screen target, saying to the target "I'll make you famous".
