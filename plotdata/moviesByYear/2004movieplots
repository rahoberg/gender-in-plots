3-Iron
 Tae-suk ([[Jae Hee]]) is a loner who drives around on his motorbike, taping takeout menus over the keyholes of front doors and breaking into apartments where the menus have not been removed. He lives in those apartments while their owners are away, washing their clothes and mending their broken appliances while usually playing "Gafsa" by [[Natacha Atlas]] on their CD player. When he breaks into one large home, he is unaware that he is being watched by an abused housewife Sun-hwa ([[Lee Seung-yeon]]). Tae-suk leaves after making eye contact with Sun-hwa, but then returns. He witnesses Sun-hwa's husband abusing her and proceeds to catch his attention by practicing golf in the yard. He hits Sun-hwa's husband with golf balls and then leaves with Sun-hwa.  The couple begins a silent relationship, moving from one apartment to another. At one home, after drinking, they are caught by the returning owners, sleeping in their bed and wearing their pajamas. They also get into trouble with the law when they break into the home of an elderly man who died alone. They proceed to give him a proper [[burial]]. When the man's son and daughter-in-law arrive at the apartment, they assume that Tae-suk and Sun-hwa killed him. The couple is interrogated by police, but remain steadfastly silent. An investigation reveals that nothing was stolen from any of the houses and the old man died of lung cancer. Sun-hwa's husband arrives to take her home, and bribes the policeman in charge of the investigation to allow him to strike Tae-suk with golf balls. Tae-suk ends up attacking the police officer and is sent to jail. There, he practices golf with an imaginary club and balls and develops his gifts for stealth and concealment, frustrating his jailers by remaining out of sight.  After being released from prison, Tae-suk rejoins Sun-hwa in her house, using his skills to evade her husband's detection: standing behind the man and moving as he turns, even kissing Sun-hwa over her husband's shoulder (as seen in the poster). Sun-hwa appears to say "I love you" to her husband, but reaches out for Tae-suk. The husband leaves on another business trip, after which Sun-hwa and Tae-suk embrace.

7 mujeres, 1 homosexual y Carlos
 Carlos (Mauricio Ochmann) is a 21-year-old who finds himself married to Camila (Adriana Fonseca), his 18-year-old girlfriend after dating for five years and discovering that she is pregnant.  Carlos decides to pursue married life since, he thinks, people marry every day and thus everything will work out fine. He gets a job to support his new family but does not realize the seriousness of his decisions until he discovers that his new boss (Luis Felipe Tovar) is having an affair with his secretary, Lucy (Anaís Belén), and Monica, his attractive new co-worker (Ninel Conde) is attempting to seduce him.  To complicate things even more, Camila's father does not approve of the decision that she and Carlos made.

7G Rainbow Colony
 The movie begins with Kadhir (Ravi in Telugu version) ([[Ravi Krishna]]) on his way to work. People stare at him and laugh behind his back as he travels to his office. He appears distracted throughout the day and even instructs his assistant to postpone an important meeting with a big client. He then waits for someone at the [[Marina Beach]] ([[Rushikonda Beach]] in Telugu version) with a bouquet of flowers. His best friend, Lakshmi ([[Suman Shetty]]) sees him and asks him who he is waiting for her. Kadhir explains he is waiting to meet his girlfriend, Anita ([[Sonia Agarwal]]) for their date. In flashbacks, we are shown how Kadhir first met Anita.   Kadhir belongs to a [[lower middle class]] family, living with his parents and younger sister in Rainbow Colony in [[Chennai]] (Telugu version as Brundavan Colony in [[Hyderabad]]). He is perceived as a good for nothing person as he skips classes, fails in exams, and gets involved in fights. Kadhir believes that his father ([[Vijayan (actor)|Vijayan]]) ([[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandra Mohan]] in Telugu version) hates him and often quarrels with him, even threatening to leave the house, only to be persuaded not to do so by his mother ([[Sudha (Telugu actress)|Sudha]]). Kadhir's life changes when a once well lived family moves into the same colony due to loss in business. Kadhir is attracted to the daughter to his new neighbour, Anita. Although he tries to woo her, Anita treats him with disdain. One day, Kadhir confesses to Anita that he loves her. He tells her that having always been ridiculed, he found respite in the fact that she at least bothered to look at him. He promises to wipe her thoughts out of his mind, as he is not right for her.  Despite himself, Kadhir continues pursuing her. Anita realizes that Kadhir is not such a useless fellow when Lakshmi tells her that he can dismantle and assemble a motorcycle within minutes. Anita takes Kadhir to a [[Hero Honda]] dealer and asks them to give him a job. He is promised a job if he can assemble a bike. Initially, the lethargic Kadhir is disinterested and gives up the task. Anita takes him to a corner and slaps him before revealing that she has fallen in love with him. She then tells him that they can only be together if he gets a proper job and gets his life straightened out. Kadhir then demonstrates his skill in motorcycle assembly, securing a job with the dealer.  Later that evening, Kadhir plans a treat for his friends. However, Anita confronts him and makes him break the good news to his parents first to get their blessings. However, Kadhir's father berates him as usual for getting a job instead of completing college. Then later at night, Kadhir overhears his father telling his mother how proud he is of their son since getting a job with such a prestigious company is not easy. Only then does Kadhir realize his father's love for him and weeps in joy.  The intimacy between Kadhir and Anita is discovered by her mother and she refuses to permit their marriage even as Kadhir's father tries to persuade her otherwise. Anita's family is heavily indebted to another Northern Indian family that has been supporting them since Anita's father suffered losses in his business. Anita's parents want Anita to marry the son of the family that has helped them.  Anita escapes her home and meets Kadhir in a tourist place near [[Thekkady]] in Kerala and they end up in a hotel room. Anita reveals that she has made the biggest decision of her life by deciding to make love to him, as he should not regret falling in love with her when she marries the man her parents chose. Though stunned by her decision, Kadhir goes with her plan and the two consummate their love. The next morning Kadhir and Anita argue when Kadhir says he wants Anita to live with him, while Anita accuses him of being attracted to her only because of the sex. They continue arguing as they exit the hotel. While crossing the road, Anita is knocked down by a truck as a helpless Kadhir watches. Kadhir is also hit by a speeding vehicle. Anita dies on the spot and after sadly returning to [[Chennai]], Kadhir tries to commit suicide only to be helped by a group of nuns. Kadhir then hallucinates about Anita's spirit coming to him and advising him to live life to the fullest.   Back in present day, it is revealed that Kadhir has become very successful person in his life but has remained mentally damaged since Anita's death. He still believes that she is alive and always imagines talking to her. The film ends with Kadhir talking to himself at the beach, thinking that he is talking with Anita.

7 Dwarves – Men Alone in the Wood
  The land of the queen is divided in two parts. At one side, there is a residential area which is overwhelmed by the mighty castle. On the other side is a dark forest named Unterwaldt. Both parts are only connected with a little bridge over the river. One day [[Little Red Riding Hood]] is picking flowers at the border of the residential area. She sees a beautiful flower across the bridge and decides to enter Unterwaldt. The forest takes Little Red Riding Hood in its power and the girl forgets time. She decides to swim in the river, but suddenly a shark-fin appears. However, it is the hat of dwarf Bubi who spies on the woman. Bubi is attacked by a bear. A scared Little Red Riding Hood runs further into the forest. The bear takes Bubi to the cottage of the dwarves. It is revealed the bear is the disguised dwarf Tschakko. As Bubi looked at a woman, which is forbidden by the dwarves, he is punished. Squirrels tickle his feet until Bubi can't stop laughing.  The dwarves consider women to be calamitous troublemakers and have a meeting about Bubi's incident. It turns out Bubi's parents were bank robbers who escaped by air balloon. As the balloon had a hole, his mother had to throw over some weight. She decided to throw out Bubi and to keep the money. Brummboss tries to tell his story once again, but never gets further than: "I was a happy and satisfied man until that night which changed my life". The meeting is interrupted by "giant" Ralphie. He wants to become a member of "the seven dwarves", but this is impossible as "there are already seven dwarves". The dwarves sent Ralphie away and decide to blow up the bridge so women won't be able to enter the forest in future. As they have a bad experience with dynamite they only place a sign which forbids women to pass.  Meantime, the queen asks her jester to tell a joke. As the queen has blond hair, the jester only tells jokes about "dumb black haired". She frequently asks her magic mirror: "who is the most beautiful in the land?". One day, the ghost in the mirror tells the queen is beautiful, but Snow White the more. The queen calls the hunter and his bloodhound Brutus (a [[West Highland White Terrier]]). She once gave him the task to get rid of Snow White. It turns out the hunter took her to the orphanage.  The story moves to the orphanage where a naive Snow White still plays with her dolls. The ghost of the mirror suddenly turns up in the mirror of the dollhouse. He informs Snow White a round-up is organized to find her. Snow White runs away to the bridge. As she may not pass the bridge, due to the sign, she uses a marker to turn the women's face into a man's face. She is soon traced by Brutus and the hunter. The hunter uses a razor to remove the beard Snow White had drawn on the sign. In the forest, the hunter meets Ralphie who keeps him up. As the hunter lost Snow White's track, he returns to the castle. He tells the queen his dog Brutus mauled up Snow White in thousand pieces and ate her.  When the dwarves return at their cottage, they find a sleeping Snow White in one of the beds. They want to get rid of her as they can't stand women. Their opinion changes after Snow White suggests to split up the house in (literally) two parts. Snow White considered dwarves to be much smaller. They declare the length of a dwarf is an old prejudice. It is not the length, but the lifestyle which determines whether someone is a dwarf or not. Upon this, Ralphie once again asks if he can be a dwarf, but this is again rejected as "there are already seven dwarves".  Snow White discovers why the dwarves have an aversion to women: Sunny and Cloudy were expelled from a school play by their female teacher as their audition for [[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]] was not convincing. Speedy got in love with [[Rapunzel]]. She threw out her long braids. Whilst Speedy was climbing her left braid, he was passed by a knight via the right braid. Rapunzel cut off her left braid and Speedy fell. Tschakko's aversion is caused as he can't and won't beat up women. Coocky once made vegetarian food which was not appreciated by his mother. Brumboss once again starts his story, but does not get further than the first sentence.  The queen consults her magic mirror and finds out Snow White is still alive. The hunter is locked up in the dungeon. She dresses up and goes to Snow White. Just before leaving, she meets the jester. He does not recognize the queen and tells a joke about dumb blondes. He is also locked up in the dungeon.  The dwarves find out Snow White becomes 18 years old. Whilst the dwarves are preparing a secret surprise party, the queen kidnaps Snow White. The dwarves are disappointed Snow White does not turn up, but suddenly realize she is not aware of this event. The dwarves seek for her, but only find the queen's crown. They conclude Snow White has been kidnapped. They take their horse and head to the castle. Once there, they notice Brummboss is missing. They can get into the castle as there is an audition for a new jester, but none of them is selected.  Snow White is in the dungeon and gets a visit from Brummboss, disguised as a priest. He finally tells why he hates women. According to the midwife, his wife and child died during delivery. Thereupon Brummboss took abdication and threw away his crown. The midwife took the crown and put in on her head. She became the new queen as the law tells the ruler is the person who wears the crown.  The "priest" takes Snow White to the scaffold. Just before her "execution", Brummboss presents to be the king who disappeared 18 years ago and also reveals he is Snow White's father. Brummboss puts the crown on his head and becomes king again. Brummboss takes Snow White and the six other dwarves to the throne hall. He throws a feather in the air. The dwarf on which the feather falls, will marry Snow White. Snow White objects: she is in love with the former jester who she met in the dungeon.  The six dwarves return to their cottage and are upset. As they are now with six, Ralphie is selected as the seventh dwarf. The dwarves decide not to help women ever again as they are once again betrayed by such creature. This promise does not stand long: Little Red Riding Hood knocks at the door and searches for help as she got lost in the wood.

The 7th Day
 In an isolated village in [[Extremadura]], the Jiménez and Fuentes families have a violent history of land disputes, jealousy, envy, and violence. The hatred between the two families begins in the 1960s as a love story, between Amadeo Jiménez and Luciana Fuentes. Their romance ends when the fickle Amadeo drops Luciana, when she already has prepared for marriage. Feeling betrayed, Luciana expresses a vengeful wish on her seducer in the presence of her fragmented, devoted brother Jerónimo who, in turn, executes his sister's wish, resulting in the young man's cold and brutal murder in an open field.   Despite Jerónimo's capture and 30-year prison sentence, the shame on the Fuentes family still proves to be terrible burden as the townspeople continue to treat the siblings with open contempt and derision, culminating one day in a suspicious fire that engulfs the family home with their mother still inside. The Fuentes siblings move to a nearby village to avoid direct contact with the Jimenez family headed by Amadeo’s brother, José, who feels the two families are now even.   Humiliated, forcibly driven out of town, and struggling with Luciana's delusional obsession over her broken engagement, the Fuentes's harbored animosity festers with each passing year, awaiting Jerónimo's release and pondering the inevitable day of reckoning against the community that had turned its back against them.  Two decades later when Jerónimo is released from jail, he rushes to look for Jóse and stabs him. Jóse survives.  Carmen, Jóse's  wife, deeply affected by the attempt on her husband’s life, pressures him to leave the village and move out to a big city, but Antonio is unable to sell his butcher shop for the money he is asking, and refuses to leave  town out of fear.  The events are narrated by Isabel, the oldest of José’s three young daughters. A summer romance develops between the teenager Isabel and Chino, a young rebel who goes around town riding his motorcycle. He is sincere in his affections and she falls for him. With his help, Isabel is determined to discover the seed of hatred that has tragically marked the story of the two families for more than thirty years. There is a town crazy, a "tonto", that watched Jose light the Fuentes house on fire. However, Isabel dismisses the testimony of the slow-witted, drug-addicted witness, the child of an incestuous relationship.  Isabel’s love for Chino ends, before it has time to deepen, when Chino is forced to leave town abruptly fleeing the authorities that have discovered his illicit drug dealing. He gives her a gold chain as a farewell gift. Upset, she throws the chain into a swimming pool then dives in to retrieve it.  "On the seventh day of creating the world, God rested", Isabel notes, and that is why the most horrible things happen on Sunday.  One Sunday the two aging brothers Antonio and Emilio Fuentes come to town with shotguns and ammunition. Their revenge engulfs the entire village and its inhabitants pay with their blood. Systematically and in cold blood, they gun down every person that cross their path beginning with the three young Jiménez sisters. Nine (9) are killed, 12 are injured. When the killing spree is over, Isabel is among the wounded survivors, but her two sisters Antonia and Encarna are, like many others, dead. When the police look for the two Fuentes brothers, they find them in a field and they do not struggle to be arrested. The two Fuentes sisters go to an asylum.   The next day, the Fuentes brothers are captured and sent to jail for life. Their two sisters, Luciana and Ángela, are also found guilty, but regarded as mentally unstable, they are locked away in a mental institution. Isabel Jiménez and her mother (Carmen) move to a city on the coast, leaving Jóse behind. He has refused to leave the village. Isabel beholds a picture of happier times in which she is with her sisters.  
13 Going on 30
  On May 26, 1987, Jenna Rink, a gawky girl, yearns to be popular, but the only way she can get the ruling [[clique]]—the "Six Chicks", led by the unkind Lucy "Tom-Tom" Wyman—to attend her upcoming 13th [[Party#Birthday party|birthday party]] is by doing their homework. Jenna's best friend, the geeky boy Matty Flamhaff (with the nickname of Beaver because he looks like the star of ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''), arrives early to the party to give her a bright pink, dream [[dollhouse]] that he built for her. He sprinkles his second gift, a packet of glittery "magic wishing dust", on its roof.  The Six Chicks soon show up with the cutest boys in class and make Jenna play "[[seven minutes in heaven]]". While Jenna waits, blindfolded, in a dark closet, thinking a popular boy she has a crush on is about to enter, the Six Chicks vanish with all the boys, half the food and Jenna's completed homework. It is Matt who walks into the [[closet]], to Jenna's horror. She locks herself in the closet and cries, wishing to be 30; above her, the glittering wishing dust from the dollhouse gently rains down.  The next morning, Jenna awakens in a gleaming [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] [[apartment]]. Jenna's dream has come true: It is now 2004, and Jenna, at first utterly baffled, particularly by the handsome hunk in her [[shower]], realizes she has magically turned 30 overnight, with no idea of what happened in the intervening 17 years.  Jenna discovers that she works for ''Poise'', her favorite fashion magazine. Tough-as-nails Lucy is her co-editor and best friend, but the magazine itself is in serious trouble, having been scooped by a rival magazine named ''Sparkle'' so often that the editor-in-chief believes someone inside ''Poise'' is tipping them off. Jenna, freaking out like the frightened teen she still is, wants only to find Matty. She gets his address and races down to [[Greenwich Village]] where the now-grown Matt ([[Mark Ruffalo]]) is a struggling photographer. To her confusion, he is distant and cold, and cannot even fill Jenna on much of her missing past, because she became head of the "Six Chicks", and never spoke to Matt again. She even became Prom Queen—and Lucy, her only friend, is actually the original "Tom-Tom" after [[plastic surgery]].  While delighting in her freedom and great clothes, Jenna stumbles through a grown-up world, learning enough of life to advise other 13-year-olds whom she actually prefers to hang with. But her slowly emerging past reveals she was nothing like the sweet, shy girl she had been the day before: this grown-up Jenna stole ideas, refuses to speak to her parents, and has office sex with the husband of a co-worker. After Jenna overhears her supposed best friend Lucy badmouthing her, in a plan to save the magazine behind her back, she decides to fix the sins of the past she cannot remember.  She returns to her hometown in [[New Jersey]] and weeps in the same [[basement]] closet. Her parents find her there, and they hug. She gets back in touch with Matt, gingerly apologizes and hires him to do the photography on her own new plans for ''Poise'', which is a huge break for him. Even though Matt has a fiancée in [[Chicago]] who is eager for him to move there, Jenna and Matt begin to fall for each other.  Everyone loves Matt's photos and Jenna's new plans to save the magazine, but when ''Sparkle'' shows up yet again with this exact material, including Matt's own photographs, and with Lucy as their new head, ''Poise'' folds. Outraged, Jenna confronts Lucy for stealing, but Lucy scornfully tells her that Jenna was the one sabotaging her own magazine all along; Lucy merely found out about it and did the same thing.  Matt, wounded by what he thought was Jenna's betrayal of him, is getting married the next day. Jenna rushes out to the leafy suburb on his wedding day, hoping to convince Matt that she was not the person she had seemed to be, that he would marry her if he could see who she really was, but Matt, already in his tux, says the past cannot come back and hands Jenna her pink homemade dollhouse, which he had kept all these years. While the wedding begins in the background, Jenna leaves in tears, closing her eyes and clinging to the dollhouse—on which a few bits of wishing dust still remain.  When Jenna opens her eyes, she is back in 1987, on that same 13th birthday night with a second chance. This time, when Matt finds her huddled alone in the closet, she kisses him. They run upstairs together, bumping into Tom-Tom on the way; Jenna rips up the homework in Tom-Tom's hands and Jenna and Matt run out of the house, emerging as a wedding couple on the other side of the door, and, as credits roll, they are moving into a bright pink house just like the dollhouse that started it all.  
The 24th Day
 Tom ([[Scott Speedman]]) and Dan ([[James Marsden]]) meet in a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] and then proceed to Tom's apartment together.  While there, Dan realizes that he had been in that same apartment before.  Five years earlier, Dan and Tom had a [[one night stand]] there.  According to Tom, that encounter with Dan was his first and only homosexual experience.  Some years later, Tom's wife is found to be [[HIV]] positive.  Despondent after receiving this diagnosis from her doctor, Tom's wife drives through a red traffic light and is killed in an ensuing collision.  Subsequent to these events, medical tests reveal that Tom is also HIV positive.  Tom blames himself for passing HIV on to his wife and, in turn, he blames Dan for passing the virus on to him.  Reasoning that Dan, ultimately, is to blame for his wife's death, Tom devises a plan to exact revenge.  He holds Dan [[hostage]], keeping him bound and gagged to a chair in his apartment. He draws blood from Dan in order to conduct a test to determine Dan's HIV status.  If Dan's test results are positive for HIV, Tom vows to kill Dan.  If the results are negative, Tom agrees to release Dan unharmed. In the end, Tom returns to the apartment and lets Dan go. As Dan is leaving, Tom asks him when he had last been tested. A few moments later, he reveals that Dan's test was, in fact, positive. He decided to let Dan go because he realized that his positive status was the result of his choices which he couldn't blame on anyone else. The screen fades with Dan standing in Tom's doorway in shock.

Henry's closest friends are Ula, a [[marijuana]]-smoking [[Pacific Islander|Islander]]; his assistant Alexa, whose gender is unclear; Willy, his pet [[African penguin]]; and Jocko, a [[walrus]].

On the way back, they had a serious car accident that left Lucy with [[anterograde amnesia]], which inhibits her ability to form new memories. As such, she wakes up every morning thinking it is Sunday, October 13, of last year.  To spare Lucy the heartbreak of reliving the accident every day, Marlin and Doug, Lucy's [[lisp]]ing [[steroid]]-addicted brother, re-enact Marlin's birthday by following a script, including putting out the Sunday newspaper, refilling Lucy's shampoo bottles, re-watching the same [[Minnesota Vikings]] game, and re-watching the movie [[The Sixth Sense]] where Marlin and Doug halfheartedly say, "Wow. Didn't see that coming," during the famous plot-twist.  Despite Sue's warning, Henry invites Lucy to have breakfast with him. Eventually she does, but it ends poorly when Henry unintentionally hurts Lucy’s feelings. He follows her home to apologize where Marlin and Doug instruct Henry to leave Lucy alone. Henry begins concocting ways to run into Lucy on the following days, such as pretending to have car trouble, creating a fake road block, or by having Ula beat him up. Eventually, Marlin and Doug figure this out due to Lucy singing [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]" on the days when she meets Henry.  One day, as Henry is about to sit with Lucy at breakfast, she notices a police officer writing her a [[Parking violation|ticket]] for her expired [[Vehicle registration plates|plates]]. Lucy attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, and takes a newspaper to prove herself, but sees that the date on all the newspapers is not October 13 as she thought. Lucy rushes home, and Marlin and Doug are forced to admit their ruse when she confronts them (and presumably not for the first time; when Marlin sees Lucy's frantic behavior as her truck pulls up to the house, he immediately realizes what happened and loudly announces to Doug that Lucy "had a bad day").  Henry comes up with an idea to make a video explaining to Lucy her accident and their relationship. Although Lucy is upset over understanding about her accident and memory loss, Henry believes that she is more upset realizing her life is a lie every day. Because of this, Henry, Marlin and Doug show Lucy the tape every morning and help her spend her days by picking up where the tape says she left off. She spends more time with Henry and goes to see some of her old friends. Lucy decides to erase Henry completely from her life after learning of his decision not to take a sailing trip to [[Bristol Bay]] to study [[walrus]]es, something he has been planning for the past 10 years. Although Henry would rather spend that year making Lucy fall in love with him every day rather than go on the sailing trip, Lucy is convinced she is a burden on him and is preventing Henry from really living his life. Henry reluctantly helps Lucy destroy her journal entries of their relationship.  A few weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his sailing trip. Before he departs, Marlin tells him that Lucy is now living at the brain institute and teaching an art class. He also tells him that she sings. Then he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD. Listening to the CD, Henry becomes emotional and curses Marlin for giving him the CD and causing him to miss Lucy. He then remembers that Marlin once told him that Lucy only sings after she meets him.  Concluding that Lucy remembers him, he returns home. Henry rushes to the brain institute where Lucy now resides and asks if she knows who he is. Lucy says she does not know him but shows him the pictures she has painted of him, saying she dreams about him every night.  Some time later, Lucy wakes up and plays a video tape marked "Good Morning Lucy." It again informs her of her accident, but ends with her and Henry’s wedding. On the tape, Henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready. Lucy then sees that she is on Henry’s boat, which finally made it to [[Alaska]]. She goes up on deck and meets Marlin, Henry and their daughter, Nicole.  
100 Days with Mr. Arrogant
 After being dumped by her boyfriend just before their 100-day anniversary, Ha-Yeong ([[Ha Ji-won]]) meets a college guy named Hyung-Jun ([[Kim Jaewon]]) when she kicks a can that accidentally hits him in the face and causes him to scratch his Lexus. He demands she pay him $3000 on the spot. She escapes from him, accidentally leaving her wallet behind.  Hyung-Jun stalks her, demanding money to pay for his car. Since she is a poor high school student Hyung-Jun writes up an "Enslavement Agreement" for Ha-Yeong in order to pay for the damage to his car. Ha-Yeong is thrown into a nightmarish slave life for 100 days, running his errands, i.e.: cleaning his house, carrying his shopping, and cleaning his car.  By accident she finds out that the damage to Hyung-Jun's car costs only $10. She then takes her revenge by damaging his car and his reputation. But Hyung-Jun takes revenge by becoming her new tutor. This brings them close to each other and they realize they love one another. Hyung-Jun frees Ha-Yeong from "slavery" as the 100 days are over and later even kisses her standing in-front of her house's main gate. Ha-Yeong's mother sees this and threatens Hyung-Jun to stay away from her daughter's life, then brings a new tutor to teach Ha-Yeong. Ha-Yeong tells Hyung-Jun that she wants to marry him but he says that he only toyed with her. Hyung-Jun leaves his apartment which makes Ha-Yeong more vulnerable. She studies hard so she can get into Hyung-Jun's college.  After the exams, when she finds out she was not selected to enter the same college as Hyung-Jun, her tutor takes her to a place where she finds Hyung-Jun telling her that she was selected into his college but he wanted to give her a surprise. After a long time we see Ha-Yeong driving while talking to Hyung-Jun about all the chores that he did not do. A high school kid is shown who kicks a can that accidentally hits her in the face and causes her to scratch her Lexus. She tells him that there is only one way to get out of paying for damages, hinting at working for them and do the chores she was just talking to Hyung-Jun about.  
69 (film)
 Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan, 1969: Inspired by the iconoclastic examples of Dylan, Kerouac, Godard and Che, a band of mildly disaffected teenagers led by the smilingly charismatic Ken (Tsumabuki Satoshi) decide to shake up "the establishment," i.e., their repressive school and the nearby US military installation. A series of anarchic pranks meets with varying levels of success, until Ken and company focus their energies on mounting a multimedia "happening" to combine music, film and theater. Complications ensue.  
36 Quai des Orfèvres (film)
 The story revolves around two [[Prefecture of Police]] officers: Léo Vrinks ([[Daniel Auteuil]]), head of the [[Brigade de recherche et d'intervention|BRI]] and Denis Klein ([[Gérard Depardieu]]), head of the [[Brigade de Répression du Banditisme|BRB]]. Both want to catch a vicious gang of armoured-car robbers that have killed nine people. But when their immediate superior, the chief of the [[Direction Régionale de Police Judiciaire de Paris|criminal police]] ([[André Dussolier]]), announces that he will soon retire, the rivalry pushes Klein to play dirty in order to get the promotion.  Vrinks is a good investigative detective with a loyal cadre of detectives and officers, as well as a stable of unsavory informants he has cultivated over the years. Klein, who has questionable ethics, is not so accomplished. Vrinks also helps people, in particular a bar tender who was raped and beaten by a criminal, Bruno ([[Ivan Franek]]), who was robbing the bistro where she was employed. Vrinks and his team kidnap Bruno, and drive him out to a forest for punishment. The gangster is stripped naked, given a mock execution, pushed into open grave, and warned to never molest that woman again. Unfortunately, Vrinks' methods catch up with him when he is tricked by Silien ([[Roschdy Zem]]), an incarcerated informant on day release, to be his getaway driver in the murder of Silien's gangster colleagues whose testimony had sent Silien to prison. However, the murdered guy was also one of Klein's informants, so Silien, in a [[quid pro quo]] exchange of Vrinks's alibi and silence, reveals the detective   where the armoured-car gang are hiding, in an industrial suburb.   Vrinks and his team stake out the factory, with Klein's team acting as backup, but after patient surveillance, when on the verge of catching the robbers, Klein ignores procedure, and drunkenly comes out of hiding. The gang, alerted thereby, spark a firefight, which results in the death of Vrinks' best friend and taking hostage a young detective woman.  An internal investigation is launched into the botched operation, but Klein avoids censure for his behaviour, when finding a prostitute and illegal immigrant who witnessed Silien's murder, and saw Vrinks who drove him out of the scene. Vrinks is arrested and thrown into jail for his role by a cop-hating judge, whereas Klein is exonerated by  the police inquiry of the failed gang arrest, because Vrinks' evidence is ruled inadmissible to incriminate him. While awaiting his indictment proceeding, Vrinks manage to disarm his guards just to obtain a free short face to face meeting with Camille ([[Valeria Golino]]) in the Court's corridor.    Later Camille is contacted by Silien, and they agree to meet, but their phone call is tapped by Klein's team, who follow her to the meeting our of town. Silien gets into her car, gives her some money to keep on, whereas Klein's people move in, and a car chase is on, whereby Camille's car is forced off the road. It ends by her car crushing, and the killing of both her and Silien, which enables Klein to clear his name again. He uses Silien's gun to first shoot the already dead Camille, then use his own gun to shoot at Silien body. It now looks like the informant shot Camille in the car, causing them to veer off the road, and Klein shot Silien in self-defence.  Seven years later, Vrinks is released from prison for just his silence in Silien's killings. Klein, who has become chief of the Paris criminal police, kept people silent by handing out promotions or by forcing others to retire or transfer.  Vrinks then has an emotional reunion with his now grown up daughter, telling her that they are going far away, but first he has to take care of unfinished business. Vrinks goes to see Titi, an old colleague, who quit the police and works at a club, where he was recently threatened by men who were ejected out and seemed strangely familiar, namely the friends of Bruno, the rapist whom Vrink's people abandoned naked in the forest.  Vrinks gets a gun from Titi, planning to take revenge on Klein who is attending the annual Parisian police ball. Using a stolen police ID, Vrinks gets into the venue and confronts Klein in the lavatory. Meanwhile, the men who were ejected from the club follow Vrinks to the soiree, and wait ominously outside. Klein explains that Camille was already dead when he shot her, and Vrinks realises what a sad man Klein has become and suggests he kill himself with the gun that he brought. After Vrinks leaves, Klein follows him into the street shouting obscenities and blaming Vrinks for Camille's death. Afterwards, Bruno shows up on a motorcycle and shoots Klein in the head. It is then revealed that Titi said to his attackers at the bar, Klein's name, instead of Vrinks's name.  Vrinks meets his daughter at the airport. The film ends with them queuing at the airport security check, on their way for a new life abroad.  
2046 (film)
 The film is the third chapter of a shared story that began with ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' and continued with ''[[In the Mood for Love]]''.  There are four main story arcs to the film. Three are about the relations of Chow with women that he meets after losing Su Li-zhen.  The first concerns Chow and Wang Jing-wen, the second is about Chow and Bai Ling, and the third is about Chow and a different woman who is also named Su Li-zhen. The fourth takes place in Chow's mysterious world of 2046 and concerns a [[Japan]]ese passenger falling in love with a gynoid. Typical of Wong Kar-wai films, the arcs are presented in pieces and in non-chronological order.  The approximate order of the arcs is listed below.  ===2046 arc part I===  This section is the only part narrated by Chow's fictional character and not Chow himself. Set in the far future, a huge rail network connects the planet. The world is a vast dystopia, and lonely souls all try to reach a mysterious place called 2046 in order to recapture lost loves. In the world of 2046 nothing ever changes, so there is never loss or sadness. No one has ever returned from 2046 except the protagonist, a lonely Japanese man named Tak (played by [[Takuya Kimura]]). As the story begins, Tak is on a long train ride returning from 2046.  ==="All Memories Are Traces of Tears"===  As Chow Mo-wan's life is revisited, we learn that he is still struggling to get over the loss of his idealised love, Su Li-zhen. He returns to Hong Kong after being in Singapore for a number of years to try to forget his anguish. To cover up his pain, he becomes a suave ladies' man. Chow attends many lavish parties and beds many women.  On Christmas Eve, Chow meets Lulu from the first film (''[[Days of Being Wild]]'') whom he remembers from Singapore, although she has no recollection of him. That night, Chow Mo-wan takes Lulu home as she is quite drunk, but accidentally keeps her room key. As he leaves, he notices that her room number is 2046, the same room number that he and Su Li-zhen had during their emotional affair. Upon returning a few days later to return the room key, the landlord informs Chow that the room is not available due to renovations. The landlord offers him the adjacent room 2047. Chow later learns that Lulu was stabbed in the room the night before by a jealous boyfriend.  Chow agrees to rent room 2047 in the meantime. After the renovation of room 2046 is complete, the landlord asks Chow if he wants to move in. However, by this time he has gotten used to room 2047 and decides to stay there. The rooms 2046 and 2047 are connected by a common hallway, Chow regularly watches and gets involved with the people that move into 2046.  ===Wang Jing-wen and Wang Jie-wen arc part I===  The first person that moves next door into 2046 is the landlord's daughter, Wang Jing-wen (played by [[Faye Wong]]). Chow spends a good deal of time just observing her from his room. He learns that she has a Japanese boyfriend working in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the relationship is forbidden by her father. Eventually, Wang breaks up with her boyfriend, then suffers a breakdown and is institutionalised. Afterwards, the next tenant that moves into 2046 is the younger daughter of the landlord, Wang Jie-wen. She is young, attractive, and flirtatious. She frequently tries to seduce him but he refuses each time.  A short time later, Chow runs into some financial difficulties, and stops going out. To make some extra money, he starts to write a science fiction series called ''2046''. The story is set in the distant future, about a group of heart sick individuals looking for love. The only place to find it is at a mysterious location called 2046. Virtually all of the characters in ''2046'' are based on people that Chow has met, such as Su Li-zhen, Lulu, or Wang Jing-wen. Whether 2046 is a place, a room, or a state of mind is never explicitly defined. Chow makes the story somewhat bizarre and erotic, and readers seem to take notice.  ===Bai Ling arc part I===  The third person to move into room 2046 is the coquettish Bai Ling ([[Zhang Ziyi]]). She wears similar [[qipao]] dresses as the original Su Li-zhen but radiates a much more aggressive sensuality than her. While it is never explicitly stated in the film, it is implied that she is a nightclub girl who occasionally doubles as a high-class prostitute. However, she is intent on finding a long-term relationship. In one instance, when Chow overhears her arguing with a man, Bai tells the man that to continue seeing her, he must end his relationship with the other woman. Chow again spends a lot of time observing her across the thin wall separating rooms 2046 and 2047.  On the next Christmas Eve, Bai runs into Chow just after she is dumped by her boyfriend before they are to go to Singapore. Chow suggests that they go for dinner, to which she grudgingly accepts. During dinner, Chow tells Bai about his experiences in Singapore. She is intrigued, and after dinner she agrees to try to form a platonic friendship with him by borrowing time from each other. Their brief friendship does not last however, as they soon develop carnal lust for each other. Not surprisingly, Chow wants to keep the relationship strictly physical; he continues to pick up other prostitutes. To compromise, Bai soon develops a compensation system where he pays her 10 Hong Kong dollars (a trivial sum) each time he stays over. However, over time Bai finds that she has feelings for Chow, and she asks him to discontinue seeing other women. Chow refuses and gives a counter offer, the option to be his customer for $10 each night. Bai is crushed and breaks things off with Chow. As a way of revenge, Bai then descends into seeing men exclusively for money, frequently changing partners. A short while later, she moves out of Room 2046.  ===Wang Jing-wen part II===  After Bai Ling moves out, Wang Jing-wen moves back into 2046 after returning from the mental hospital. She is a shell of a former self, and still very depressed over the loss of her Japanese boyfriend. Her ex writes numerous letters in an attempt to reconcile with her, but she refuses due to her father.  Wang passes the time by assisting her father at the hotel. She also starts to spend more and more time with Chow helping him with his writing and editing. At this point, he is regularly publishing chapters of ''2046''. These scenes are very similar to those in ''In the Mood for Love'' when Su Li-zhen used to help Chow with his writing in their hotel room. Chow remarks that this period in his life is the happiest that he has been after Su Li-zhen. However, before he realises it, he develops feelings for Wang Jing-wen. He makes some minor attempts to start a romance with her, but nothing develops since she is still very much in love with the Japanese man.  One day Wang Jing-wen asks Chow rhetorically if some things in life never change. He answers her by writing a story called ''2047''. In this story, a Japanese man leaves the world of 2046, but falls in love on the journey home. While he initially tried to base the story on Wang Jing-wen's ex-boyfriend, he realises that the story is ultimately about himself.  ===2047 arc part II===  Chow's fictional world is revisited. However, this time it is narrated by Chow himself. Set in the far future, for passengers to reach or leave 2046 they must take a long journey on a vast train network. The main character, Tak (who is portrayed by Wang Jing-wen's Japanese boyfriend) is trying to leave 2046 because he lost the love of his life in that world. As the train travels through the extremely cold sections 1224–1225, Tak becomes intimate with one of the train's gynoid assistants (played by Faye Wong) and later falls in love with her. He then asks her numerous times to come with him. However, each time the gynoid does not answer. Tak has heard earlier that excessive operation causes the gynoid's response time to slow down and decides to wait on the train to see if this is the case. He sits quietly on the train, and counts the seconds that go by, hoping the gynoid will decide to leave with him. However, the gynoid still does not respond. Ultimately, Tak realises that it is not a delayed reaction that causes that gynoid not to respond, but that she is in love with someone else and that their relationship is simply not meant to be. With this knowledge, he finally has the strength to leave the train and 2046. Completing the story marks a turning point in Chow's recovery.  ===Wang Jing-wen part III===  Next Christmas, Chow invites Wang Jing-wen out to dinner. After finding out that she still misses her ex in Japan, he takes her to his office so that she can call him to wish him well. Looking sadly through the window panes as Wang Jing-wen is overjoyed talking to her ex, Chow remarks that in fact Section 1224-1225 from the story are simply the dates for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day when everyone is especially lonely and needs additional love. He goes on to say that while he had feelings for her, and most likely could have taken advantage of the situation (as he did the previous year with Bai Ling) he was happy that in this situation he did the "right thing". The call re-ignites the romance. Soon afterward, Wang Jing-wen moves to Japan and gets engaged.  A short while later, while still feeling depressed over the loss of Wang Jing-wen, Chow runs into Lulu again as she has a violent confrontation with another woman that is sleeping with her current playboy boyfriend. This incident is identical to one that occurred in the original ''Days of Being Wild'' when she confronted the original Su Li-zhen for sleeping with Yuddy. Chow remarks that Lulu, is likely to forever remain living in the past. However, he then remarks that this is not really a sad thing, as she seems perfectly content to be miserable. The incident strengthens Chow's resolve to get over Su Li-zhen.  ===Bai Ling arc part II===  Some time later, Chow gets a call from Bai Ling and the two go out to dinner. This time, Bai looks much less glamorous and more "run-down". She informs Chow that she plans to leave for Singapore, and asks him to provide a reference and plane fare. She also asks where he was last Christmas, as she stopped by at that time, and was hoping to see him. In fact, she remarks that she really misses him. It turns out, during last Christmas, Chow had gone back to Singapore in an attempt to find a former lover, another woman named Su Li-zhen (played by [[Gong Li]]).  ===Su Li-Zhen Arc===  Chronologically, this arc occurs first in the film. Chow met the second Su Li-zhen some years back when he first arrived in Singapore. At that time, he was still grieving over losing the original Su Li-zhen and spending much of his free time in the local casinos. After losing much of his savings, he encounters the second Su Li-zhen, a mysterious gambler. They become lovers, and he soon wants to know everything about her. But she insists that he beat her in a "high-card" draw before she will reveal anything about her past, which he never is able to do. Eventually, she agrees to help him win back his money so that he can return to Hong Kong. When she does so, he prepares to leave, and asks her to go with him. Again, she challenges him to a high-card draw, which he again loses. Knowing little about her, Chow speculates that she, like himself, has a troubled past.  Initially heartbroken about this, he remarks that after he completes the story '2047' he finally understands why the second Su Li-zhen did not go with him, as he would again have tried to recapture the past by looking for elements of the original Su Li-zhen. When Chow went back to Singapore to visit her the second time, he does not find her. He makes some inquiries as to her whereabouts and speculates that she either returned to Cambodia or was killed.  ===Bai Ling arc part III===  Shortly after the events of 'Bai Ling arc part II' and the night before she boards a plane for Singapore, Chow again meets Bai Ling for dinner. Bai remarks that, between their two meetings, one of her clients has given her a lot of money and she wants to pay Chow back immediately. He refuses to take the money. Bai insists on paying for dinner, and Chow is stunned when she hands him a stack of money, each $10 bill representing one night they had spent together. Bai tells Chow to pay for dinner with this stack of bills, while unbeknownst to him, she sadly watches behind the restaurant's green window veils.  After dinner, Chow walks her back to her apartment. Grasping his hands at the apartment door, she begs him to lend his time to her once more and spend the night. She then asks him "Why can't it be like it was before?" He refuses to stay over, even out of pity, coldly stating that ''that'' is simply something he would never lend. He exits by jerking his hands away from her and remarks in voiceover that this was the last time he ever saw her. He leaves in a taxi, staring emptily into space, as the camera slowly enters a whispering hole.

Able Edwards

A biological contaminant is released into the atmosphere and over the following years, decimates nearly ninety percent of the world's population. Fleeing the poisoned planet, humanity relocates to a space station orbiting the Earth. It is there that life continues with the hope of one day returning to Earth.  The film unfolds during the probate hearing determining the disposition of assets of the estate of Abel Edwards beta, the clone of the founder of the Edwards Corporation (EC), the most successful entertainment conglomerate of the 20th Century. The EC included an enormously successful film and television studio and the Abel Edwards' Fantastic Wonderlands Theme Parks based on the characters populating Abel Edwards' animated films.  The EC has an extensive animatronic background and has morphed into a manufacturer whose significant product is the humanoid robot; their market share has fallen sharply and sales have softened. They understand the need to develop a new market, but after several failed attempts, recognize they lack the intuition and imagination necessary for the success of such a bold course change. As a last-ditch effort, their marketing department develops a plan to clone their dead genius founder, Abel Edwards. They will grow a genetic replica, and they will infuse him with the same life-altering experiences that shaped the original man. Nature plus nurture, or something like it.  Upon his 25th birthday, Edwards takes the reins of the company and rides a 20-year wave of success with every passing day. When the potential rival of the status quo career politician abruptly drops out of the race, Edwards sees his chance to expand beyond his defined boundaries and bring the 'Edwards Standard of Living' directly into people's living rooms, rather than maintaining a park to give them a transitory experience. When Edwards moves from a 'Celebrity Politician' to a front-running candidate, the power struggle reaches its breaking point.  The Anti-Reality Organizations finally have their scapegoat. He loses the Senate race in a landslide. Edwards has lost his son, the Senate seat and his position as CEO of the company. Edwards commandeers a space shuttle and heads for the site of the original Able Edwards Fantastic Wonderland beginning a journey of no return.

Ab Tak Chhappan
 The section of the Mumbai Police Department responsible for handling the underworld known as Crime Branch is headed by Sadhu Agashe ([[Nana Patekar]]). Sadhu is the city’s best inspector with an enviable reputation and record of encounter shootings. Though tough, he is a loving husband to his wife ([[Revathi]]) and father and also helps his informers and other poor people in times of need. His immediate junior, Imtiyaz Siddiqui ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]) despises Sadhu to no end; he feels Sadhu intentionally belittles him. Also Imtiyaz is more concerned about adding to his encounter score and therefore ends up killing more than the primary target which is the main reason Sadhu dislikes him. To add to his woes, Imtiyaz is unable to surpass Sadhu’s encounter "score". Enter Jatin ([[Nakul Vaid]]), a rookie to this line of policing who manages to impress Sadhu. The inspector takes the newcomer under his wing, further antagonizing Imtiyaz.  All of them report to the Commissioner Pradhan ([[Mohan Agashe]]) who is a fair and honest police officer.  During these events, Sadhu establishes a love-hate friendship on the phone with Zameer (Prasad Purandare), a notorious underworld don based abroad, who grudgingly admires Sadhu for his no-nonsense attitude. Zameer and rival don, Rajashekhar run the Mumbai underworld.  Sadhu Agashe’s world begins to turn upside down as Pradhan retires and with the entrance of the new commissioner, M P Suchak ([[Jeeva (Telugu actor)|Jeeva]]) who has a strong link with the don, Rajashekhar. Suchak takes a liking towards Imtiyaz who is willing to do encounters primarily of Zameer's men mainly on Rajashekhar's orders. Suchak starts undermining and belittling Sadhu. Sadhu continues on his honest path. Eventually, the pressures of his career take a toll on his personal life as some men kill his wife in the Jatin and Vaishali's wedding reception party. During his personal investigation into this matter, Sadhu kills Feroz, right-hand man of Rajashekhar. Sadhu is compelled to resign from the force and Suchak (on Rajashekhar's orders) sends Imtiyaz to kill Sadhu. Imtiaz gets killed in a peculiar chain of events and Sadhu Agashe, a once famed inspector, becomes a fugitive of the law. Suchak announces shoot at sight orders against Sadhu despite Pradhan's advice to the contrary and Sadhu is forced to ask Zameer for help in escaping from India.  Meanwhile, Jatin, who has been growing increasingly disenchanted by Suchak's behaviour, resigns and calls for a press conference and exposes Suchak's connection with Rajashekhar. Suchak disputes this in his press conference but is suspended pending investigation.  Sadhu goes to Zameer's HQ and thanks him for releasing him and tells him that he is now Zameer's man. As Zameer and Sadhu are drinking alone, Sadhu breaks a glass. Sadhu accuses Zameer of killing his wife. When Zameer tells Sadhu that it is Feroz who killed his wife, Sadhu informs him that he had killed Feroz earlier and hence he was convinced that using Feroz's name, Zameer had murdered Sadhu's wife. Suddenly, Sadhu uses the broken glass to kill Zameer and escapes. Then the scene rolls forward to a location abroad where Sadhu and Pradhan are having coffee. When Pradhan asks Sadhu about why he had run away thereby proving the allegations against him, Sadhu tells him that it is part of his plan. He was able to kill Zameer as a fugitive which he never could have done as a cop. He says that he will now go to Rajashekhar since Rajashekhar is thrilled at Zameer's death and kill him too. Sadhu says that he doesn't care what the world thinks of him and he will always be a cop and will continue his work of eliminating crime until he dies. He requests Pradhan to look after his son who is with his maternal aunt in Pune and Pradhan contemplatively agrees. The end credits roll as Sadhu gets up and walks off after saying good bye to Pradhan.

Auto suggest to Natarajan about hiring a rowdy to take care of the tenants, instead of hiring a lawyer, as by doing that, not only will the tenants get out of there, but also he and Gayatri.

Auto lied to Natarajan that Mani was in the prison because he killed a house owner, but really, Mani was actually visiting his uncle in there, as his uncle is the jailer in the prison.

Even the students were scared of Mani, but later warmed up to Mani and Auto and became fast friends with them. Mani and Auto started staying with them. Mani also became best friends with Gayatri and had helped saved her from a gang of goons at a marketplace, who confused him to be 'Bottle' Mani and have harassed Gayatri. Gayatri kept on talking about Mani to Natarajan a lot later that day, causing him to think that Mani and Gayatri are in love with each other.  Mani warns the students to get vacate the house immediately. The students accepted to vacate the home within a week. One of the students requests Mani to help him unite with his lover, when he attempted to commit suicide, upon hearing that her family are doing an arranged marriage for her, but was mainly saved by his friends, Auto and Mani, who witnessed him doing his suicide attempt.   Mani and Auto kidnap Priya ([[Sadha]]) on the day of her marriage from the wedding hall thinking her to be the lover of the non-bachelor student.

Slowly, Priya gets attracted towards Mani seeing his kind nature and also after coming to know about the sacrifice made by him for the well being of his cousin, while also of his help to get an acceptance from the family of the married student's wife of their marriage. Mani was then later confronted by the doctor ([[Bosskey]]) that checked on Priya and he revealed to him that Priya was poisoned, when she was kidnapped by Mani and Auto at her wedding and at the time, she was admitted at the hospital.   Confronted by Mani, Priya reveals a flashback where she is the only daughter of a rich politician ([[Vijayan (stunt coordinator)|FEFSI Vijayan]]). Her father wants Priya to get married to ACP ([[Assistant Commissioner of Police]]), Raghavan ([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]), an corrupt cop and an affluent sadist, who was once married, but had killed his own wife in a sadistic manner. Although, Priya is not interested in the proposal having learned Raghavan's true nature from the priest, who is conducting her wedding and had conducted Raghavan's first wedding, her father wanted her to agree, just because Raghavan helped him escape from a police case. Priya decides to commit suicide on the day of her wedding with Raghavan, but luckily gets kidnapped and saved by Mani, whom she first met at a shopping mall mistaking him to be Raghavan, which is coincidentally is the very day she and Raghavan first met. It was also the very day Mani and Raghavan first met each other in a scuffle Raghavan had with Mani over his engagement ring for Priya, that Mani accidentally got it pretty dirty, only for him to clean it up.

Natarajan accepted them, and while he and most of the tenants were gone, one of them made advances toward Gayatri, only for Gayatri to scold him. As she left, the tenant ([[K.S.

Adam & Paul
 Adam and Paul are childhood friends who as adults have withered into two hopeless, desperate addicts, tied together by habit and necessity. The film is a stylised, downbeat comedy, following the pair through a single day, which, like every other, is devoted to scrounging and robbing money to buy heroin.  Adam and Paul wake up sick in the middle of a field with Adam glued to a mattress. They make their way into town via a run-in with a belligerent drug dealer named Martin living in [[Ballymun]], a hasty exit from the top deck of a bus, a long trudge down the median of a dual carriageway and an incident with a moped that injures Paul's leg. Wandering through [[St Stephen's Green]] they meet their old gang who are drinking cans and having "a little picnic for the kiddies". Made feel unwelcome, the boys sit down to a roasting from Marian and Orla who are furious with them for not turning up that morning to the [[Month's Mind|month's mind]] of Matthew, the boys' best friend and Orla's brother. Marian, backed by her brother Wayne, warns them to stay away from his sister, Janine. To the disgust of Wayne and the girls, Georgie lets slip that there is a "do" on for Matthew that night in the Bunker pub.  From here we follow the boys aimlessly wandering around the city looking for an unknown person—perhaps a contact that might be able to sort them out with a fix. They have a misunderstanding with a homeless guy in a sleeping bag who thinks they're looking for a local troublemaker under the alias of "Clank" who he mistakenly gathers owes them money. Paul hurts his hand in a botched attempt at a [[smash and grab]]; they get kicked out of a café for trying to steal a handbag and Paul gets barred from a shop for "feelin' bread". After a random argument with a Bulgarian immigrant (who asks them infuriated "Why the fuck, are you here?"), and failing to get anywhere in their search for drugs, they make their way to Janine's. She is not home but the door is left open. The boys are just about to steal her television, when they hear the sound of a baby crying. Janine returns home to find the two gently holding and whispering to the baby. They leave Janine with the promise that they will see her again that night at the Bunker.  The pair mug an adolescent with [[Down syndrome]], but he does not have any cash or valuables. Later, a furious man grabs them, accusing them of spreading rumours that he owes them money. He identifies himself as Clank. Clank and his friend Zippy kidnap the two and force them to keep a lookout for trouble while they "cause a bit of mayhem" in a nearby garage with baseball bats. Adam and Paul fail to notice the arrival of police and both Clank and Zippy are arrested.  The pair decide to take Clank's car to a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]], but crash in the process. Sitting on an old cooker down a back lane, they come across a large television set. With the help of a fence named Kittser, they take the TV to Ballymun and attempt to sell it to an older man. But Kittser and the buyer argue and the TV gets damaged in the altercation, forcing the again hopeless depressed Adam and Paul to leave. On the way out they pass the door of drug dealer Martin who is being attacked by a gang of vigilantes. As the two sit outside the block, the contents of Martin's flat are thrown off of his tower block and land on the ground around the boys including two bags of heroin.  After spending the night in the centre of Dublin intoxicated on their find, Paul wakes up the next morning on [[Dublin Bay]]. Adam, who is lying behind him, has overdosed and is dead. Paul, visibly distraught and conflicted, resigns to taking the two bags of heroin from Adam's pockets and leaving.

Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London
 Agent Cody Banks ([[Frankie Muniz]]) attends summer camp, actually a secret facility for training CIA teenage agents. When a group of CIA soldiers attempt to abduct head counselor Victor Diaz ([[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]]), Cody helps him escape, mistaking the CIA operation for a training exercise. The director informs Cody that Diaz stole disks containing plans for a secret mind-control device, and sends Cody to recapture him.  In the [[United Kingdom]], Cody poses as a summer orchestra student at the Kenworth estate to spy on owner Lord Duncan Kenworth, suspected of working with Diaz, supported by his handler, Derek ([[Anthony Anderson]]) and Kumar, Derek's right-hand man, who are disguised as a chef hired by Lady Josephine Kenworth and a taxi driver respectively. Whilst keeping his mission a secret from his fellow students, Cody sneaks around the estate and confirms that Diaz and Duncan are working together and that they have a working prototype of the mind control device, evidenced when Duncan makes a dog serve drinks and play the piano.  The next day, Cody breaks into a lab owned by Duncan, where he sees the finished device: a microchip inserted as a filling into a tooth cavity by dentist Santiago. Shortly afterwards Cody and Derek chase Diaz, armed with a rocket gun, through London streets, but Cody is captured by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] and taken to [[Scotland Yard]]. He is later freed by Emily ([[Hannah Spearritt]]), a fellow student who, similar to Cody, is actually a British [[Scotland Yard]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|undercover operative]]. While Emily buys coffee and soda, henchmen sneak up on Cody, knocking him unconscious by drugging him with spray. They kidnap him and implant him with the microchip.  Under Duncan, Santiago and Diaz's influence, Cody meets the CIA director, who is then also converted. This is witnessed by Emily, who explains things to Derek. To get the microchip out of Cody, Derek cuts one of Cody's gadgets, exploding Mentos mints, into a precisely minuscule amount to safely remove it. The group later realise Diaz's plan: to implant all of the world leaders, who are all in London for a [[G7]] summit at Buckingham Palace, effectively giving him control of the world.  Deducing that with the CIA director under Diaz's control, they may be put on a most wanted list, Cody, Derek and Emily infiltrate the party before the summit. There, they realize that most of the dignitaries have already been implanted due to bizarre behavior and Duncan being appointed director of the Royal Mint by the British Prime Minister (upon accepting this, Duncan cruelly states to Josephine that he is leaving her). They explain the truth to the other students, who are performing for the guests, and urge them to keep the world leaders from attending the G7 summit. They later proceed to do so with an impromptu but rousing performance of [[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]], accompanied by dancing and clapping from the assembled dignitaries and Queen Elizabeth herself, whilst Cody, Emily and Derek search for the villains. Derek is implanted with the microchip, and is set on Cody by Santiago. Before Santiago can kill him through Derek, Emily finds and subdues him, disabling the mind control software and rescuing the U.S. President, who was to be implanted.  Shortly after Cody kicks out Derek's microchip, the two of them remove the CIA director's microchip. Diaz, realising that his plan has failed attempts to flee, but ends up fighting, and being defeated by Cody in the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s gift room, destroying numerous priceless artifacts in the process. Duncan also attempts to escape, but is tripped by his apparently senile and blind butler, who turns out to be Emily's handler and is arrested, much to Lady Kenworth's delight.  After the villains are arrested, Cody returns to the camp, where Derek is now in charge as reward. Cody's parents pick him up, none the wiser about his dangerous exploits. Alex, Cody's younger brother tries to eat a few of his explosive Mentos, but Cody tosses them into the pond where they explode harmlessly.

Inya ([[Judy Ann Santos]]) is a lovely young lady who had just married her childhood sweetheart Edilberto ([[Raymart Santiago]]) and they're excited about starting a new family. Ignacio "Igna" Basa ([[Dennis Trillo]]) is Inya's best friend, a [[transgender woman]] who has been in love with the handsome Edilberto for years. Ignacio falls for Ichiru Hamaguchi ([[Jay Manalo]]) a Japanese Army official who returns her affection, but becomes torn between fulfilling her duty to her country and her love for Ichiru.  The arrival of the Japanese throws the town into chaos, days after the Japanese air raid in [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]] on December 7 - which marked the start of the war. Meanwhile, on December 8, Japanese air bombings included Manila, Baguio, Davao, Iba and Clark fields to signal the Japanese invasion to the [[Philippines]].  But Edilberto, Inya and Ignacio aren't the only ones the war will change forever. Traitorous Japanese interpreter and local collaborator Maura ([[Angelu de Leon]]), strong-willed Tiyang Mabel ([[Jacklyn Jose]]), tough guy Anton ([[TJ Trinidad]]), and pure-hearted Julia ([[Iya Villania]]) also get caught in the winds of the war, and find themselves doing things they never thought they'd do... all for the hope of living and dying another day.  Starting on December 1941, the guerrilla leader captain Ediberto Manalang ([[Raymart Santiago]]) was named Commander Berto, and was supported by other local guerrilla forces in the town of San Nicolas during the [[Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)|Fall of the Philippines]]. Meanwhile, battles between the Japanese and USAFFE troops ends in the [[Battle of Bataan]] on 1942 and the [[Bataan Death March]] begins on April 9 of that year. 76,000 surrendered Filipino and American troops became Prisoners of War under Japanese hands. The defeated troops were forced to march from [[Bataan]] to [[Tarlac]].Anton joined the guerrilla movement. Ignacio became the movement's spy inside the Japanese forces, catching Maura's suspicion. Anytime Kapitan Berto attacks a Japanese patrol, the latter burns a village and executes suspected guerrilla members under direction from Maura. Inya is also suspected as a Japanese spy and tortured by the guerrillas.  She revealed Ignacio's secret to Hiroshi, who in turn told Ichiru. At first, he did not believe. Until he suffered a nightmare that he was holding his father's blood in front of the Americans. He tried to make love with Igna, but the latter refused. Ichiru revealed that he knew Ignacio is transgender and he never cares about it as long as he loves Igna.  A few years later, local guerrilla forces are led by Captain Inya Marasingan Manalang, who replaced Commander Berto in 1943 after Edilberto died during a Japanese attack on their camp. The Japanese retaliated with brutality, hanging the mayor and others. Anton and Igna's transgender friend Edna were released at Igna's request. A guerrilla raid sealed Igna, Ichiru and Akihiro's fates. As Igna returned to the camp after she warned Inya of the raid, she was caught along with Ichiru by Maura and Hiroshi. Igna was beaten. Ichiru escaped along with Akihiro and Igna. They returned to Tiyang Mabel's house, where Akihiro and Ichiru committed [[seppuku]]. Igna again was arrested by Maura and Hiroshi.

Inya's men open fired on Maura's vehicle, killing her and the Japanese inside. Igna's last words said she was a traitor, so she deserved a traitor's death.  Many decades and many coercion later, Inya told the whole truth about what happened during the time. As the mayor and the historian discusses future plans, she left them.  
Ai-Fak
  A young man, Fak, is a revered novice [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, and the entire village has turned out to the local temple to hear him preach a sermon. Fak's talk is interrupted a coughing fit by his widower father, though, and Fak struggles to maintain his focus. Fak then decides he must put aside his aspirations for monkhood to take care of his father. Then he is [[conscription|conscripted]] by lottery into the [[Royal Thai Army|army]]. He hopes that when he completes his national service, he will return to the village, be ordained as a monk and devote his life to religion.  On his return home from the army, the bus to his village breaks down. During the stop, Fak steps over to the side of the road, near a [[Lotus flower|lotus]] pond, to urinate. There, among the lotus, he sees a beautiful woman bathing, fully clothed (as is customary in Thailand). Fak zips up and eventually arrives at home, where he finds his father in a very happy state. His father's reason for being so happy is that he has remarried. Fak's [[stepfamily|stepmother]] then appears from behind a [[mosquito net]]: it's the woman from the lotus pond. Her name is Somsong, and though she is sweet and devoted, there is something clearly wrong with her, perhaps some type of [[mental illness]].  Though there are happy times, with Fak joining his father at work as a [[janitor]] for the local [[school]], his reunion with his father is short-lived after his father becomes ill and dies. Because Fak made a promise to his father that he would look after his stepmother, Fak's goal of returning to the monkhood must again be put aside.  Though Fak is well liked in the village, the villagers do not like Somsong and have labeled her "crazy". And after Fak's father's death, the villagers start to treat Fak differently: they believe he is having an [[affair]] with his stepmother. Fak at first ignores the [[gossip]], but it becomes harder and harder to deny because of Somsong's behavior. On one occasion, during a [[Thai dance|likay]] performance at a village fair, Fak is accosted by Somsong after she sees Fak talking with a young woman. Somsong is suffering from [[delusion]]s that she and Fak are married, and she is [[jealousy|jealous]]. Somsong also has the unfortunate habit of shedding her clothes and running naked in public, or simply lifting her dress and [[exhibitionism|exposing]] herself. During one of these episodes, some villagers happen upon Fak just as he's chased the nude Somsong down and is attempting to cover her up. But what the villagers think they are witnessing is Fak having sex with his stepmother. Fak has been judged.  Fak has taken his father's old job as school janitor. One day a dog that's thought to be [[rabies|rabid]] wanders onto the school grounds. Fak is given the job of killing it. He grabs a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]] and uses it to strike the animal, hitting it with a glancing blow that only injures it and makes it angrier. Fak eventually finishes the snarling dog off, but it is a bloody task. For a brief moment, Fak is seen as a hero by the students and faculty, and he feels a bit better about himself.  Fak must prepare for his father's [[Funeral#Funerals in East Asia|cremation]]. He invites the school's headmaster, the village headman and others. He orders 50 [[sandalwood]] blossoms for attendees to place on the burning casket. But no one shows up for the ceremony, except for the monks he engaged to chant over his father, and the local undertaker.  Fak makes friends with the undertaker, a lowly person who is not well liked by the [[superstition|superstitious]] villagers because they believe he is unclean. Even Fak didn't particularly like the man, but after Fak tells him that he has never had sexual relations with Somsong, the man believes him.  After the cremation rite, the undertaker offers Fak some rice whiskey. Fak at first doesn't like the taste or the way it makes him feel. But he has a few more drinks and starts enjoy himself. Looking for relief from the pressure of taking care of his mentally ill stepmother and the harsh judgment of the villagers, Fak turns to the [[alcohol|bottle]] and becomes an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]. His downward spiral continues until he has angered the villagers, and they turn on him and beat him, leaving him to be assisted home by Somsong.

In addition to these, he maintains a casual relationship with a single mother named Julie ([[Marisa Tomei]]) that he refers to as his "semi-regular-quasi-sort-of-girlfriend thing", and the unhappily married Dorie ([[Jane Krakowski]]). At the first inkling that Dorie wants something more than casual sex, he decides to stop contacting her.  Alfie wants to go into business with his coworker and best friend, Marlon ([[Omar Epps]]), but Marlon is preoccupied with trying to win back his ex-girlfriend, Lonette ([[Nia Long]]). Marlon asks Alfie to put in a good word with Lonette. Alfie meets with her at a bar to persuade her to get back together with Marlon - after both becoming intoxicated, they end up having sex on a pool table.

Alfie goes to Julie's place for another [[booty call]], but she throws him out after confronting him about his affair with Dorie, which she learned about after finding her panties in her rubbish bin, which Alfie had discarded there earlier after discovering them in his pocket. Later attempting to reconcile by attending her son's birthday, bringing a [[teddy bear]] as a gift, Alfie discovers that his actions have led to Julie reconciling with her estranged husband.

Alfie becomes infatuated with her, but she wants to keep their relationship strictly sexual. Alfie then ends his relationship with Nikki.  Alfie runs into Julie in a coffee shop, and realizes that he has genuine feelings for her; to his dismay, however, she's now happy with another person. A trip upstate to visit Marlon and his now-wife, Lonette, who reveals that she never actually went through with the abortion.

Alexander (2004 film)
 The story begins 40 years after 323 BC, around 283 BC, with [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who narrates throughout the film. Alexander grows up with his mother Olympias and his tutor [[Aristotle]], where he finds interest in love, honor, music, exploration, poetry, and military [[combat]]. His relationship with his father is destroyed when Philip marries [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]]'s niece, [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Eurydice]]. Alexander insults Philip after disowning Attalus as his [[kinship|kinsman]], which results in Alexander's banishment from Philip's palace.  After Philip is [[assassination|assassinated]], Alexander becomes King of Macedonia. Ptolemy mentions Alexander's punitive campaign in which he razes [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and burns [[Persepolis]], then gives an overview of Alexander's west-Persian campaign, including his declaration as the son of [[Zeus]] by the [[Oracle]] of [[Amun]] at [[Siwa Oasis]], his great battle against the Persian Emperor [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]], and his eight-year campaign across Asia.  Also shown are Alexander's private relationships with his childhood friend [[Hephaistion]], [[Bagoas (courtier)|Bagoas]], and later his wife [[Roxana]]. Hephaistion compares Alexander to [[Achilles]], to which Alexander replies that Hephaistion must be his [[Patroclus]] (Achilles' best friend and lover). When Hephaistion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaistion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife. Hephaistion shows extensive jealousy when he sees Alexander with Roxana and deep sadness when he marries her, going so far as to attempt to keep her away from him after Alexander murders [[Cleitus the Black]] in India.  After initial objection from his soldiers, Alexander convinces them to join him into his final and bloodiest battle, the [[Battle of Hydaspes]]. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Later on, Hephaistion succumbs to an unknown illness either by chance or perhaps poison, speculated in the movie to be [[typhus]] carried with him from India. Alexander, full of grief and anger, distances himself from his wife, despite her pregnancy, believing that she has killed Hephaistion. [[Death of Alexander the Great|He dies]] less than three months after Hephaistion, in the same manner, keeping his promise that he would follow him. On his deathbed, Bagoas grieves as [[Diadochi|Alexander's generals]] begin to split up his kingdom and [[Wars of the Diadochi|fight over the ownership of his body]].  The story then returns to 283 BC, where Ptolemy admits to his scribe that he, along with all the other officers, had indeed poisoned Alexander just to spare themselves from any future conquests or consequences. However, he has it recorded that Alexander died due to illness compounding his overall weakened condition. He then goes on to end his memoirs with praise to Alexander.  The story then ends with the note that Ptolemy's memoirs of Alexander were eventually burned, [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|lost forever]] with the [[Library of Alexandria]].  
The Alamo (2004 film)
 The film begins in March 1836 in the Mexican State of Coahuila y Tejas town of [[San Antonio de Bexar]] (now Downtown [[San Antonio]] in the U.S. state of Texas), site of the Alamo, where bodies of Texan defenders and Mexican attackers are strewn over the Alamo. The film then flashes back to a year earlier. [[Sam Houston]] ([[Dennis Quaid]]) attends a party where he tries to persuade people to migrate to Texas. He meets with [[David Crockett]] ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]), recently defeated for reelection to Congress. Houston explains to Crockett that as an immigrant to Texas, Crockett will receive  [a square mile] of his own choosing. Crockett, with a grin, pointedly asks Houston whether this new republic is going to need a president.  Meanwhile, in [[San Felipe, Texas]], the Texas provisional government is meeting to discuss what action to take after the recent capture by the Texans of the Alamo and Bexar from Mexican forces at the first Battle of San Antonio de Bexar. Texas having rebelled against Mexico and its dictatorial president [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]], who is personally leading an army to retake the Alamo, the Texan War Party calls for the Texas army to depart Bexar, cross into Mexico and confront Mexican forces at the town of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]]. The Opposition Party seeks to rebuild the Texan army and establish a permanent government to be recognized by other nations of the world.  The provisional government votes out Sam Houston as commander of the Texas army. While having drinks with [[Jim Bowie]] later, the disgusted Houston tells Bowie to go to San Antonio and destroy the Alamo.  [[William B. Travis|William Barret Travis]] ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]) is also in San Felipe, reporting for duty. His character is quickly established as a man who seeks respect as a uniformed military officer, a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army. Interlaced scenes show him granting his wife a divorce (for his adultery, abandonment, and "barbarous treatment"), and seeking to begin a new life in Texas.  The Texas provisional government orders him to take command of the Alamo.  There he meets [[James C. Neill|Col. James Neill]] (Brandon Smith), who informs him that Travis will be in command of the Texas Army regulars while Neill is away on leave. Travis is alarmed that the Alamo's small force cannot withstand the Mexican Army which is rumored to have thousands of foot soldiers, plus the formidable Mexican cavalry.  Again he sends a rider to deliver his plea for reinforcements.  As small groups of Texans arrive, Travis oversees defence preparations, hoping that enough reinforcements will arrive before the inevitable attack.  Crockett arrives in San Antonio, where he tells a crowd, "I told them folks you'all can go to hell, I'm going to Texas'".  He is told that the other defenders are impatient for Santa Anna to arrive now that Crockett is on hand to fight alongside them to which a puzzled Crockett replies, "I understood the fighting was over... Ain't it?"  Santa Anna soon arrives in San Antonio, much to the surprise of the Texan fighters, who were not expecting the Mexican Army to arrive until late March or early April. The Texans retire to the Alamo compound despite its vulnerability, and begin fortifying it as best they can. Amid the chaos Travis writes letters asking for reinforcements. Only a couple dozen men arrive to join them.  Santa Anna's army surrounds the Alamo compound and the siege begins. Bowie leaves the Alamo to meet with Mexican General [[Manuel Fernandez Castrillon|Manuel Castrillón]] ([[Castulo Guerra]]) to talk things over before matters get out of hand; however, an incensed Travis fires the 18-pound cannon on the south-west wall, thus cutting short Bowie's impromptu attempt at diplomacy.  This virtually ends the chance to forestall the Mexican attack and Bowie returns to tell Travis that Santa Anna has offered surrender at discretion. Travis offers all within the Alamo an opportunity to leave. Almost to a man the defenders decide to stay and fight to the end. At least one woman remains, Mrs. Susanna Dickinson (Laura Clifton), whose husband, Lt. Almeron Dickinson ([[Stephen Bruton]]), has decided to stay.  Bowie becomes debilitatingly ill and is bedridden in one of the buildings. For the next several nights the Mexican Army band serenades the Texans with the "Degüello" (slit throat), followed by an artillery bombardment of the surrounded compound. Convinced that the Texans will not leave the Alamo, Santa Anna orders a blood-red signal flag to be raised, the sign for "no quarter". The flag is visible also to the Alamo's defenders, who know its meaning.  Crockett, having stayed awake through the night, checks the walls and notices the approaching Mexican army. The Texans are awakened by his first shot and begin rushing  to their posts. The Texans also hear the battle cry of the Mexican soldiers: "Viva Santa-Anna!" After a long, brutal battle the Mexicans, despite taking heavy casualties, breach the north wall of the mission where Travis is killed, shot in the head by a young Mexican soldier.  A small group of Mexican engineers, armed with axes and crowbars, assault and break down the boarded-up doors and windows of the west wall, while another small group storms the southwest wall.  The few surviving Texans fall back to the buildings, where they are all killed. Attackers discover the bedridden Bowie in his room, where he fires his pistols and attempts to fight with his knife, but is swiftly bayonetted to death. Crockett and the last 4 defenders retreat into the church where they fight their last stand. Crockett is taken prisoner. In a final act of defiance, he mockingly offers to lead Santa Anna and the Mexican Army to Sam Houston in order to ensure the formers' safety; Santa Anna thereupon angrily orders Crockett to be executed.  Days later, after hearing that the Alamo has been taken, Houston, once again in command of the remnants of the Texan army, orders a general retreat eastward.  His army and the families of most of the soldiers flee. They are pursued by the victorious Mexican Army, led by the confident Santa Anna.  (Historians call this near-panic flight the "Runaway Scrape".) However, against the advice of his officers, Santa Anna decides to split his army in an attempt to catch the retreating Texans, leaving only a few hundred men to defend him. A few weeks later, Houston halts his retreat near the San Jacinto River (south of the future site of the City of Houston), where he decides to face the Mexicans in a final stand. With the support of two cannons and a small group of mounted Texans ("Tejanos"), Houston's army surprises Santa Anna's army during its afternoon siesta. During the ensuing short rout (called by the victors the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]), the vengeful Texans massacre at least seven hundred Mexican soldiers and capture General Santa Anna, whose identity is given away when Mexican prisoners respond to his presence by reverently rising to their feet. Santa Anna surrenders to the wounded Houston, and in exchange for his life agrees to order all Mexican troops to withdraw from Texas and to accept Texan independence, despite the Texans wanting to hang him as revenge for the Alamo. The last scene in the movie shows the spirit of Crockett playing his fiddle on the top of the Alamo and then looking out on the horizon.  
Aitraaz
 Raj Malhotra ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a product engineer for a telecommunications company, Air Voice. Priya Saxena ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), a junior lawyer goes to Raj's house for an interview, mistaking him for barrister Ram Chautrani ([[Annu Kapoor]]), a neighbour and Raj's friend. They fall in love, marry and are soon expecting a child. Raj expects to be promoted to CEO when the company's chairman ([[Amrish Puri]]) arrives with his new wife, Sonia Roy ([[Priyanka Chopra]]) to announce the promotions. Sonia Roy is named the company's new Chairperson; and after a discussion with her husband, she announces the promotions. The CEO position instead goes to Raj's friend Rakesh ([[Vivek Shauq]]), while Raj is placed on the Board of Directors. At a party, Raj, accompanied by Priya, learns about his new boss, Sonia Roy. Priya is surprised that Sonia is the wife of the much older Mr Roy. Raj and his colleagues talk about Sonia being very attractive and the age difference between her and her husband, and Raj jokes that his magnetic personality was responsible for his massive promotion. It is implied that Raj may have encountered Sonia previously.  A flashback explores Raj's previous relationship with Sonia. Five years earlier, Raj and Sonia (then a model) meet at a beach in [[Cape Town]]. They fall in love and move in together; Sonia becomes pregnant with Raj's child, which makes him happy, but Sonia refuses Raj's marriage proposal and says she is going to terminate the pregnancy as her child would stand in the way of wealth, fame, power and status and their relationship ends.  The next day, Rakesh tells Raj about a defect in the company's new mobile handset: a call goes to two people simultaneously—the intended recipient and another random person on the phone's contact list. Raj needs Sonia's permission to stop production, and she invites him to her house to discuss the matter. Sonia makes provocative and sexually explicit statements to Raj, who ignores her. She then aggressively tries to pursue Raj, who resists. Although he repeatedly rejects her advances, Sonia continues trying to seduce him. As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has told her husband that he sexually harassed her. Since he has admitted finding Sonia attractive, his claim of innocence is not believed, and the company pressures him into resignation.  Raj asks Chauthrani to take his case; Chauthrani tells him not to resign, and to keep going to work. This case goes to court; Sonia and Roy engage a lawyer ([[Paresh Rawal]]). Initially, the bulk of the evidence is against Raj and the case gains widespread media attention. Raj's bank manager returns from Bangkok and gives him a tape that recorded Raj's encounter at Sonia's house. After the tape is proven genuine, Chauthrani is struck by a car driven by a goon hired by Sonia and the tape is destroyed. When Priya asks Raj why he called their bank manager from Sonia's house, he replies that he had called Rakesh, and the call went through to the bank manager as well due to the defect in the company handset. Priya continues the case after Chauthrani's injury. She exposes Sonia's earlier relationship with Raj in Cape Town and finally plays Rakesh's voice mail to the court - revealing what really occurred between Raj and Sonia. It is revealed that Sonia married Roy for money, power and status, but when he could not satisfy her sexually, she tried to resume her relationship with Raj. Priya wins the case and Roy leaves Sonia. Guilt-stricken and humiliated, Sonia commits suicide by jumping from a building. The end credit scene shows Raj and Priya walking their child.  
Al otro lado
  === Mexico === Priciliano, the first boy introduced in the story, has a very strong bond with his father. At the beginning of the film, his father tells him a story about a princess who was kidnapped by a conquistador and commits suicide in the lake he and his friend have been playing in. He is trying to teach his son the importance of respecting the dead, a very prevalent theme in Mexican culture. However, Priciliano is struck with grief when his father leaves his family to go find work "al otro lado" (on the other side). He is particularly upset because he is about to celebrate his ninth birthday, which his father will be missing. Frustrated, he attempts to cross the river to the other side with his friend and nearly drowns but is rescued by the ghost of the princess his father told him about. An older man in the community tells Priciliano that it is important to stay with his family because they need him, and the boy accepts his role as "the man of the house" in his father's place and begins to learn how to live everyday life without him.  === Cuba === The second boy introduced in the story, Ángel, is ashamed of his mother, who is promiscuous. He was told before the story began that his father is a famous person and lives "al otro lado." Desperate for a sense of pride, he and his friend, Walter, attempt to cross the ocean in a primitive raft to find his father. In their attempt, however, their raft is hit and overturned by a large wave. Walter drowns in the ensuing chaos, while Ángel miraculously escapes. He doesn't have the courage to tell his friend's mother of what happened and feels extremely guilty. His grandfather notices something is wrong and urges his mother to talk to him. He tells his mother a little of what happened in the ocean and why they were there, and his mother figures out the rest and tells him that his father knows nothing of Ángel's existence. But tells him that he is all that she and his grandfather have and vice versa. Ángel learns to be content in his situation and the cinematography suggests that his friend's death is no longer a burden to him, but a memory to carry with him.  === Morocco === Fátima is a girl who runs away from home to find her father, bringing only a picture of him with her. She is intercepted, though, by slave traders, who offer to take her across to Spain on their boat. Once the traders arrive, a woman who works with them refuses to send Fátima to work because Fátima is too young and they have enough girls anyway. This woman, who does not speak Arabic, takes Fátima in and eventually softens enough to drive Fátima to [[Málaga]] and help her find her father. The father is with a Spanish woman, but once confronted with his daughter, he leaves the other woman to return Fátima home.

 The film starts with Neil([[Prithviraj Sukumaran]]), a writer bidding farewell to his partner Kamala, who wishes him luck with his writing. He intends to write about Rose, his sister as promised to a publisher. However, Kamala plans on leaving Neil, complaining of his selfishness all along and preference to his own life. He even blames their daughter leaving them on him. She asks him to dedicate his time for Rose now, though it is meaningless to her. Neil admits that he always hated himself. As he leaves, he sees a familiar face and then is stuck by the pangs of realization. The very sight provokes a sudden outflow of memories and the story goes back into a flashback.  Neil  and his Anglo-Indian family lives in [[Kerala]]. He is a disturbed youth working as a clerk in a factory for low wages. His intention is to become a writer. He lives with his mother Margaret ([[Sheela]]) and sister Rosemary([[Geetu Mohandas]]). His father was a Portuguese sailor who left the family when the children were very young. Rose, his sister is slightly handicapped and because of this, she is always in her shell. She is bound to inferiority complex and mental fragility. She is very much interested in glass figurines that adorn her showcase. She simply gazes at the iridescent beauty of the figurines in her loneliness. Margret, Neil's mother hates his care-free attitude towards life and his late-night movies. She is a very possessive mother and she is always worried about the future of her daughter. She doesn't allow her daughter to do household chores and talks about the tenderness of Rose's age, which must not be doomed by working at home. One day, Margaret goes to the Type writing class where she had previously sent Rose. She finds out that Rose had quit the class very early and had even fainted while taking a speed test. Margaret confronts Rose and learns that she had been spending her spare time at the church and the museum. As Rose feels sorry for her crippled stage, Margaret advises her to develop her other skills and that girls with no such duty must be sent off in marriage. They gaze at the portrait of their father as Margaret explains how handsome he was.  The next day, Margaret finds some adult novels with Neil. She angrily scolds him and this later turns into a violent fit of rage. Neil ends up calling his mother an " old chattering witch" and storms out. As he is leaving, breaks one of Rose's figurines, and Rose watches this with pity. Neil returns drunk at night and says to Rose that he had been to a Magic Show. He gives Rose a magic scarf that he got from the show in order to make up for her broken figurine. He convinces that this scarf will impart life to her glass animals and Rose is instantly mesmerized by it. Her isolated world is symbolized by her glass animals who are in a similar way much like Rose herself. The next day, Neil and Margaret reconcile and Margaret expresses her deep fears about her children, at the same time admitting of their talents. That night, Margaret makes Rose wish for everything, while looking up at the crescent moon though Rose is not sure what to wish for. Margaret asks Neil to bring a fine young man for dinner one day for Rose to get acquainted with that man. So Neil invites his co-worker Freddy ([[Tom George Kolath]]) for a dinner at his home. Margaret plans a light supper and digs up her old gown and reminisces about her tender teens. She dramatically slips into  talking of her old days, how they had many servants while living in [[Goa]] and her fate of having reached a pathetic situation now. Neil's mother thinks that Freddy will get interested in Rose and they can marry her off. Margaret dresses up in the gown and compels Rose to do so. At this point, she says that all pretty girls are a trap in which handsome men must fall into. Rose reluctantly agrees to cooperate. Later, on hearing that the man about to come is her former senior schoolmate, Freddy, she refuses to sit for dinner. She had a crush on him for her was very artistic and athletic.  As the dinner is about to start, Rose faints and Neil takes her to lay her down on the sofa. Later, Freddy and Rose get to talking and realizes their past connection. A flashback shows a young Rose who lives a pitiful time deprived of friends. Freddy remembers the time when he nicknamed her "Blue Rose" when Rose said that she had [[Pleurisy]]. Rose introduces her glass figurines to Freddy and particularly displays a unicorn figure, which was her favorite one and furthermore a reflection of her own life. She explains that the unicorn is odd due to its difference from all the others. Freddy enlightens Rose's spirit by saying that her difference from all the similar people of the world is her greatest peculiarity, just like the magical unicorn. People tend to like the oddness among the evenness. He even encourages her to be more smart at times and to think better of herself. Then both of them quietly dance to the beautiful song heard from the community dance hall outside. Rose is able to overcome her stereotypes and is able to keep up with the dance moves. Rose is lifted both physically and mentally. As the dance concludes, Freddy accidentally brushes against the table, knocking off the unicorn from the table. It falls and breaks the horn. But Rose is happy that with this incident, he can join the others as a normal one, for he had just undergone an operation  to rectify his painful oddness. By these words, Rose indirectly refers to her own state of mind at that time for she becomes totally rejuvenated . But her hopes get crushed when she comes to know that Freddy is already engaged to a girl named Betty. She is heartbroken, but bids farewell to Freddy as she gifts her unicorn to him. Margaret brings in Lime juice for them, but is so struck on hearing from Freddy that he is engaged. She feels so humiliated but tries to keep up a smiling face. She blames this on Neil and taunts him verbally for cheating them. Neil however was unaware of the fact that Freddy was engaged. An argument arises as Margaret calls him selfish and deprived of feelings. With this, Neil storms out of the house, leaving them all alone forever. Margaret and Rose watch as their hope goes away.  The story returns to the present. Having recognized the man he saw at the ferry as Freddy, he decides to pay him a visit. He then takes him along with his family to see an aged and timid Margaret. She instantly recognizes Freddy and Betty. She is consoled by their presence as Freddy's little daughters gift her a bouquet of flowers. She explains that after Neil left them, Rose was admitted to a Mental Asylum near [[Madurai]] and that she lived a completely withdrawn life there. After a slight improvement, she suffered from an unexpected Nervous Breakdown and had died. Neil feels no guilt or sympathy, but only pain for Rose. He pens down her story to immortalize her as he imagines her spirit showing him light from the beyond. Later they all sit down for dinner as Rose's picture is shown at a distance ( Signifying the title), over which the magic scarf flies gently, giving life to her memories.  
Alien vs. Predator (film)
 In 2004, a [[satellite]] detects a mysterious heat bloom beneath [[Bouvet Island|Bouvetøya]], an island about one thousand miles off the coast of [[Antarctica]]. Wealthy industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]) discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2000 feet beneath the ice. He attempts to claim it for his multinational communications company, Weyland Industries, a subsidiary of the Weyland Corporation, and assembles a team of experts to investigate. The team includes archaeologists, linguistic experts, drillers, mercenaries, and a guide named Alexa "Lex" Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]).  As a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam that creates a passage through the ice towards the source of the heat bloom. When the team arrives at the abandoned [[Whaling|whaling station]] above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious [[pyramid]] and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured [[Human rib cage|rib cages]].  Meanwhile, three Predators consisting of Scar, Celtic and Chopper arrive and kill all the humans on the surface. They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure and are trapped within it. The [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] Queen awakes from [[Cryopreservation|cryogenic stasis]] and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by an Alien, and Weyland buys Lex and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa ([[Raoul Bova]]) enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien with a [[shuriken]] before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Lex and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him not wearing his mask.  Through translation of the pyramid's [[hieroglyph]]s, Lex and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids, and were worshiped as gods. Every 100 years they visited Earth to take part in a [[rite of passage]] by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Aliens, creating the "ultimate prey" for the Predators to hunt while being able to survive in the pyramid; if overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a self-destruct device to eliminate the Aliens and themselves. The two deduce that this is why the current Predators are at the pyramid, and that the heat bloom was to attract humans for the sole purpose of making new Aliens to hunt.  Lex and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed in their hunt so that the Aliens do not escape to the surface. Sebastian is captured by an Alien, leaving only Lex and Scar to fight the Aliens. Scar uses parts of a dead Alien to fashion weapons for Lex and the two form an alliance. The Queen Alien, using her acid blood, is freed from her restraints and begins pursuing, along with the other Aliens, Lex and Scar. Just as they are about to escape, Scar detaches and uses his wrist bomb to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Aliens. Lex and Scar reach the surface, however the Alien Queen has survived and continues chasing them. They defeat the Queen by attaching its chains to the exploration team's water supply tank and pushing her over a cliff, dragging the Queen to the ocean floor. Scar, however, had been impaled by the Alien Queen's tail and succumbs to his wounds, dying.  A Predator ship [[cloaking device|uncloaks]] and several Predators appear. They retrieve their fallen comrade and an elite Predator presents Lex with one of their spear weapons as a gift. The other Predators recognize her for her skill as a warrior symbolized by the alien blood Scar burned on her cheek before he died. As the Predators retreat into space, a chestburster with a hybrid form of an Alien and a Predator erupts from Scar's chest.

 In 1974, [[Ron Burgundy]] is the famous [[News presenter|anchorman]] for a local [[San Diego]] television station, fictional KVWN channel 4. He works alongside his friends, whom he had known since childhood, on the news team: lead field reporter Brian Fantana, [[Sports commentator|sportscaster]] Champ Kind, and intellectually-disabled, but loyal and good-hearted weatherman Brick Tamland. Station director Ed Harken informs the team that they have retained their long-held status as the highest-rated news program in San Diego, leading them to throw a wild party, where Ron unsuccessfully attempts to pick up a beautiful blonde woman, Veronica Corningstone. Ed later informs the team that they have been forced to hire Veronica Corningstone, the same woman Ron attempted to pick up. After a series of unsuccessful attempts by the team to seduce her, she finally relents and agrees to a "professional tour" of the city with Ron, culminating in a sexual relationship. Despite agreeing to keep the relationship discreet, Ron announces it on air as well as shouting about it in the office.  After a dispute with a motorcyclist ends in Ron's dog Baxter being punted off the [[San Diego–Coronado Bridge]], Ron is late to work. Veronica fills in for him on-air, gets higher ratings than Burgundy normally gets, and the couple breaks up. Veronica is promoted co-anchor, to the disgust of the team, and both co-anchors become fierce rivals on and off the air. Depressed, the news team decides to buy new suits, but Brick, who was leading the way, gets them lost in a shady part of town. Confronted by main competitor Wes Mantooth and his news team, Ron challenges them to a fight. However, when several other news teams converge onsite, a full-on melee ensues, only to be broken up by police sirens that cause them to flee. Realizing that having a female co-anchor is straining their reputation, Ron gets in another heated argument with Veronica, and they get in a physical fight after she offends him about his hair, further increasing tensions.  One of Veronica's co-workers informs her that Ron will read anything written on the [[teleprompter]], so she sneaks into the station and changes the text in revenge. The next day, Ron (unaware of what he is saying) concludes the broadcast with "Go fuck yourself, San Diego!", instead of his signature closing line, "You stay classy, San Diego!", subsequently triggering an angry mob outside the studio and prompting Ed to fire Ron. Realizing she went too far, Veronica attempts to apologize, but Burgundy angrily dismisses her. Burgundy becomes unemployed, friendless, and heavily antagonized by the public while Veronica enjoys fame, although her male co-workers hate her. Ed also informs Champ, Brick, and Brian that if they see Ron they may not speak with him or they will be fired.  Three months later, when a panda is about to give birth, every news team in San Diego rushes to the zoo to cover the story. In an attempt to sabotage her, a rival news anchor pushes Veronica into a [[Kodiak bear]] enclosure. When Ed could not locate Veronica, he recruits Ron. Once at the zoo, Ron jumps in the bear pen to save Veronica, as the public watches helplessly. The news team then jumps in to save Ron and Veronica. Just as a bear is about to attack, Baxter, who miraculously survived, intervenes and encourages the bear to spare them. As the group climbs out of the pit, Wes appears and holds the ladder over the bear pit, threatening to drop Ron back in, and says that deep down he has always hated him, but then admits to Ron that he also respects him and pulls Ron out to safety.  After Ron and Veronica reconcile, it is shown that in years to come, Brian becomes the host of a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] reality show named ''Intercourse Island'', Brick is married with 11 children and is a top political adviser to [[George W. Bush]], Champ is a commentator for the [[National Football League|NFL]] before getting fired after being accused by [[Terry Bradshaw]] of [[sexual harassment]], and Ron and Veronica are co-anchors for the [[CNN]]-esque ''World News Center''.  
Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid
  A team of researchers funded by a New York pharmaceutical firm Wexel Hall, including Dr. Jack Byron, Gordon Mitchell, Sam Rogers, Gail Stern, Cole Burris, and Dr. Ben Douglas leave for a jungle in [[Borneo]] - [[Indonesia]] to search for a flower called ''Perrinnia Immortalis'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for Blood Orchid), which they believe can be used as a type of [[fountain of youth]]. Though their guide Captain Bill Johnson and his partner Tran Wu has misgivings about which path to take, Jack convinces him to take an unsafe path. The team goes over a waterfall and has to wade through the river. A giant anaconda emerges from the water and swallows Ben whole, but the rest of the team escape from the river. Bill assures them that it was the largest snake he has ever seen and that it should take weeks for it to grow hungry again. However, most of the team demand that the expedition be called off. They travel to Bill's friend, John Livingston, who lives on the river, to see if Bill can borrow his boat, but they find Livingston dead and his boat crashed.  They find themselves in a small native village consisting of thatched huts and a disemboweled anaconda with a pair of human legs hanging out of the snake's abdomen. The team realizes that the snakes are unusually large in size because their lives have been extended through the orchids, which are a part of the local food chain. Jack says that since they must be close to the orchids, they should press on. However, the others contend that there is no evidence that the orchids will have the same effect on humans. Wanting to leave, they start building an escape raft.  Gordon discovers Livington's radio and gun and realizes they could have called for help long ago. Jack is unable to convince him to allow the expedition to continue, so he paralyzes him using a poisonous spider. As Jack joins the others at the raft, Sam discovers Gordon and the spider bite. An anaconda drops down from the rafters and swallows Gordon alive soon after she leaves the building. The others arrive just as it finishes, so Bill sets the building on fire in hopes of killing the anaconda, but notices that it already made its escape. Jack uses the commotion to steal the raft.  With no more material to make another raft, they hack through the jungle to beat Jack to the orchids and retrieve their raft. On the way they fall into a cave trying to escape from an anaconda. Cole gets lost and panics after finding a skeleton. He runs into Bill's partner, Tran, and as they return to the others, Tran gets pulled under and Cole tries to find him, but all he sees is Tran's lost flashlight floating. Tran is eaten by an anaconda under water. Bill tries to find Cole and Tran, but also notices Tran's lost flashlight floating and with his blood surrounding it. The terrified Cole escapes from the caves behind the group, seconds ahead of the snake, which follows him through the hole and gets stuck. Sam uses a machete to behead it, but another snake captures Cole. The team follows and find him being constricted, but still alive. Bill throws his knife and impales the snake through the head, killing it and freeing Cole.  The group finds the raft just as Jack finds the blood orchids, hanging precariously above a pit in which a ball of male anacondas are mating with the queen. Jack shoots Bill in the arm and forces the party to accompany him to the orchids. He has Sam cross the pit via a thin log to fill a backpack with orchids. As she returns, the log cracks. Jack orders her to throw him the backpack, but Sam threatens to drop the flowers into the pit unless he drops the gun. The log breaks, and she falls, hanging by her leg halfway down the pit. As the others try to help her, Jack attempts to retrieve the backpack. The spider he used to paralyze Gordon escapes from its jar and bites him. Jack falls into the pit and is devoured. The vine holding Sam also gives away and she too falls into the pit, but is alive. She climbs out just in time as one of the anacondas tries to get her feet.   The female anaconda notices them, but Gail tricks it into biting their fuel container. Bill tries to shoot the snake, but the gun is empty. Cole shoots it with a flare, causing a chain reaction that sets the anaconda on fire and kills the other snakes and destroys the blood orchids. Bill, Sam, Cole, and Gail make it back to the raft and leave the place behind.  
Anatomy of Hell

Only when the man and woman confront the most unspeakable aspects of their sexuality will they have a pure understanding of how the sexes view one another.  
Amrutham
 The film is a typical family entertainer with ample doses of sentiments, tears and humour - all ingredients vital to keep viewers glued to their seats. Add a dash of student politics, campus violence and an inter-religious marriage, and the perfect recipe is ready.  It is to the director's credit that he has used an age-old formula and made a taut film that does not put the audience to sleep.  The story of "Amrutham" is about two brothers, Gopi (Jayaram) and Dinesh (Arun). Gopi is a farmer who works hard to give his brother a good education after their father (Nedumudi Venu) deserts them when Dinesh is just a child.  Dinesh, now a final-year degree student, is involved with the daughter of the local teashop-owner played by Bhavana.Dinesh is also involved in college politics. On the other hand, Gopi is involved with a Muslim girl Sainaba (Padmapriya). All hell breaks loose when Gopi marries Sainaba and brings her home.  The natural treatment given to the theme ultimately wins the day for this film.  There is no excessive use of melodrama, which tends to ruin this kind of story. The relationships are handled deftly. Nothing seems to be over the top or out of place. The performance of the lead actors has also helped in achieving this. Padmapriya is the surprise package of this film. She is natural as Sainaba.

Appleseed (film)
  Deunan Knute, a young soldier and one of the Global War's last survivors, is rescued by Hitomi, a Second Generation Bioroid. Knute's escape attempt is stopped by her former lover [[Briareos Hecatonchires]], now a [[cyborg]]. She realizes that the war had ended and she is in a [[Utopia]]n city called Olympus. Its population is half-human and half-[[Cloning|clone]], a genetically-engineered species called [[Biorobotics|Bioroid]]s. Olympus is governed by three factions: Prime Minister Athena Areios; General Edward Uranus III, head of the Olympus Army; and a Council of Elders. Everything in the city is observed by an [[artificial intelligence]] named Gaia from a building called Tartaros. While there, Deunan joins the counter-terrorism organization ESWAT.  The Bioroids were created from the [[DNA]] of Deunan's father, Carl, making the Second Generation Bioroids her brothers and sisters. However, they have a much shorter lifespan than humans due to suppressed reproductive capabilities. The Bioroid's life extension facilities are destroyed by a secret faction of the Regular Army in a terrorist attack against the Bioroids. However, the Appleseed data, which contains information on restoring the Bioroids reproduction capabilities, still exists.  Olympus is plagued by conflicting factions. Along with a strike force, Deunan and Briareos head to the building where the Bioroids were originally created. She activates a holographic recording showing the location of the Appleseed data. Dr. Gilliam Knute, who created the Bioroids, entrusted Appleseed to Deunan, but was inadvertently killed by a soldier. After mourning the death, Leyton turns against his men. They then get cornered by the Regular Army. Deunan discovers from anti-Bioroid terrorist Colonel Hades that Briareos had intentionally allowed his Landmate, a large [[Powered armor|exoskeleton-like battlesuit]], to escape. Kudoh then sacrifices himself to get Deunan and Briareos out of harm's way and escape to the rooftop. Uranus attempts to convince Deunan that Bioroids seek to control humanity, and he wants to destroy Appleseed and the D-Tank containing the Bioroid reproductive activation mechanism. Briareos tells Uranus that the Elders manipulated the Army into wanting to destroy the D-Tank, but Athena is trying to prevent them from doing so and protect humanity. Hades, who resents Carl, wounds Briareos. She and Briareos flee into the sea, killing Hades in the process. Despite Deunan's pleas not to leave Briareos behind, he persuades her to search for the Elders. Mechanic Yoshitsune Miyamoto arrives in his Landmate and begins repairing Briareos after receiving an SOS from him. Deunan flies back to Olympus in Yoshitsune's Landmate and uses the Appleseed data to fully restore Bioroid reproductive functions.  As Deunan encounters the Council of Elders, they reveal their involvement in Gilliam's death and also plan to use the D-tank virus to sterilize humans, which will leave the Bioroids the new rulers of Earth. They needed the Appleseed data to keep the Bioroids alive, but Gilliam hid the data so they could not move forward with their plan. Athena, stepping in to stop them and announcing that Uranus has surrendered, tells Deunan that the Elders had been acting on their own and had shut Gaia down once they realized humanity had softened their stance against Bioroids. The Elders state that they will soon die since Gaia kept them alive, but that they were ready to sacrifice themselves. They then activate the city's mobile fortress defenses, which begin marching towards Tartaros. Athena states that D-tank's security system is nearly impenetrable, but a shot from the fortresses' main cannons might puncture the tank, releasing the virus. ESWAT begins mobilizing, but suffer heavy casualties due to the fortresses' heavy weaponry.  Briareos arrives and asks Deunan to join the battle. Despite the Elders' objections, she goes with him to the seventh tower, and attempts to enter the password to shut the defenses down, but a malfunction makes it difficult. The final password letter appears by itself, and Deunan secures the D-Tank, shutting down the towers. She reveals that the sins of humanity will probably get worse, but that there is always the chance that future generations will learn from these mistakes; she vows to keep fighting for the children.

Arie (film)
 Izrael (Izia) Arie, a Lithuanian Jew and a world-renowned Moscow heart surgeon, learns that he has only six months to live because of [[pancreatic cancer]]. He retires immediately and sets out to find his first love, Sonia Schworz, with whom he shared an attic on a Lithuanian farm while hiding from the Nazis for a large part of [[World War Two]]. Their re-union takes place in [[Israel]], where Sonia settled after the war. Although the couple has not seen each other for sixty years, it turns out that in the meantime they have been following similar life paths, not unlike twins separated at birth. Both have achieved enviable prosperity and enjoy the company of much younger bedfellows. To get these youngsters out of the way, Sonia unceremoniously dumps her lover Chaim, while Izia's pregnant wife Olga is quickly persuaded to marry Sonia's grandson Yossi.  Yossi bears an uncanny resemblance to the Lithuanian farmer Juozas, who hid Sonia and Izia as children  in 1941, and won over Sonia's heart in 1944 in an unequal competition with the inexperienced Izia. Although Juozas is killed by Lithuanian Nazi sympathizers, Izia does not forgive Sonia for what he sees as betrayal, and refuses to follow her to Palestine when Lithuania is liberated. The irony of it all, commonly known as "Jewish happiness", lies in the patterns that keep repeating themselves sixty years after: Izia loses his woman (Olga this time) to a Juozas look-alike again and fails to keep Sonia too (she suddenly dies in a terrorist explosion at Yossi's and Olga's wedding). Apparently, Sonia's and Izia's union was never meant to last, either at the beginning or at the end of their lives. On his deathbed, pondering on the lost opportunities, Izia reiterates God's commandment to multiply and replenish the earth in the form of an impassionate plea to Olga and Yossi to waste no time in going forth and procreating, presumably to contribute to the survival of the Jewish people, constantly threatened by extermination.  
Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)
 [[File:BerlinTournage80jours2.jpg|thumb|Film set at Berlin's [[Gendarmenmarkt]] in April 2003. The building doubles as a background building outside London's Royal Academy of Science.]] In 1890, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|England]], a Chinese man, Lau Xing, robs the [[Bank of England]]. To evade the police, Xing becomes the valet for Phileas Fogg, an inventor, taking the pseudonym Passepartout. Phileas, just before Xing arrived, had been trying to break the 50-mph speed barrier, and after succeeding with the help of Passepartout, they head to the Royal Academy of Science. There, Fogg is insulted by the other "brilliant minds", in particular [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], who believes that everything worth discovering has already been discovered. After a debate between the scientists about the bank thief, Phileas is pressured into a bet to see whether he can travel around the world in 80 days. If he wins, he will become Minister of Science in Lord Kelvin's place, if not, he will destroy his lab and never invent anything again. Phileas and Xing start their journey around the world, taking a carriage and leaving London after a confrontation with Inspector Fix, a corrupt officer hired by Lord Kelvin to stop them.  Xing and Phileas journey to Paris, [[French Third Republic|France]]. Pretending to take Phileas to a convention with [[Thomas Edison]], Xing leads him to an art school where Phileas meets Monique La Roche, a would-be [[impressionist]]. There, Xing is attacked by disguised warriors, the Black Scorpions, sent by General Fang, a warlord from China who is after the [[Jade]] [[Buddharupa|Buddha]] that he stole. Fang had previously given it to Kelvin in exchange for military assistance in China. When Monique learns of Phileas's ambition, she convinces them to take her with them. They depart in a [[hot-air balloon]], chased by Fang's warriors.  Whilst on the [[Orient Express]], Monique learns that Xing is trying to return the Jade Buddha back to his village, and is travelling with Phileas to get there quickly. Monique keeps his secret in exchange for him convincing Phileas to let her travel with him. They travel to [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]], where the train stops. Guards climb onboard and inform the trio that they are greeted by Prince Hapi. During the Prince's banquet, he orders Monique to stay as his seventh wife while the men are ordered to leave. The men [[blackmail]] Prince Hapi into releasing Monique using a prized but apparently flimsy "[[The Thinker]]" statue of the Prince. The statue is destroyed, much to Hapi's anger, but the trio escape from the guards.  Lord Kelvin, learning that Phileas has been abetting a thief's escape, orders the British colonial authorities in [[British Raj|India]] to arrest both. Xing notices this and warns his companions, disguising themselves as Indian women to evade capture and successfully flee to [[Qing Empire|China]]. On the train Xing tells the story of the Ten Tigers of Canton to children. Fogg tells him legends are meaningless and Xing tells him that him traveling around the world in eighty days is a legend.   Xing leads his friends to his village, [[Lanzhou]], where they are happily greeted. Phileas, however, finds out Xing stole the Jade Buddha and leaves, but is immediately captured along with Xing and Monique by the Black Scorpions. With them is a man who was imprisoned for public urination. Xing challenges the leader of the group to a fight, during which he is joined by the martial arts masters of the "[[Ten Tigers of Canton]]", of which Xing is a member. The Tigers drive the Black Scorpions from the village and free the Westerners. The Buddha is returned to the village temple. Phileas, feeling used by Xing and Monique, leaves for San Francisco, [[United States]], alone, only to be proven wrong when the latter decide to help him win his bet. In New York City, Fang's disguised minions trick the trio to an ambush site. Fang reveals the nature of their arrangements with Lord Kelvin to take Lanzhou and tap the jade reserves underneath it. A battle against Fang and her minions commences in the workshop where the [[Statue of Liberty]] is being constructed, resulting in Phileas missing a boat to help Xing. Fang's minions were defeated and Xing nearly dies to save Phileas. Fang also survived but was knocked out by Monique with a punch and Xing joked that she was the 11th Tiger. Phileas feels he has lost, but the other two say they may still make it if they catch the next ship.  They board an old ship and Phileas convinces the captain to let him build a plane out of the ship's old wood in exchange for a new ship. Using an altered version of the [[Wright brothers]]' plans, Phileas builds the plane while the ship's crew builds a catapult to launch it into the sky. They reach London, where the machine falls apart and they crash in front of the Royal Academy. Lord Kelvin sends police to arrest them for robbing the bank, in order to stop them from making it to the top step of the Academy, and proclaims himself the victor when [[Big Ben]] strikes noon, seemingly ending the wager. Monique, Fix and other ministers attest to Kelvin's unfair methods and his bullying nature, but Kelvin scoffs at them. In the process he insults [[Queen Victoria]], who arrives on the scene. She learned that he had sold her arsenal to Fang in exchange for [[jade]] mines in China thanks to one of his aides. Kelvin is arrested and sent to prison, and Phileas realizes he is one day early thanks to crossing the [[international date line]]. He victoriously ascends the stairs of the Academy and kisses Monique.

In the 1990s he produced and directed one of the first digitally captured film experiments based on the characters in Alice in Wonderland, often known as "Through the Looking Glass". His last known film project, "Meth" filmed in and around Palmdale/Lancaster CA involved a film "completion fund" scam where he ran off with the Sony Camera equipment loaned to him and the money he had collected from several investors. Upon returning to CA, he would die in 2001 awaiting a liver transplant, without ever contacting his sons. Christopher Walken bore an uncanny resemblance to Robert Jordan both in the physical and in his ability to appear menacing and unpredictable.

Art Heist
 The film is a [[romantic thriller]] that starts off by showing a daring, well-planned robbery of a very famous and expensive painting from the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC art museum]] in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]]. The museum has many security features that are problematic for the thieves, but because of their skill they are able to circumvent the security and steal the famous [[El Greco]] [[Christ Carrying the Cross]] on display courtesy of Victor Boyd ([[Ed Lauter]].)<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/art_heist/</ref>  After the first heist, Sandra Walker ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), is called by her boss Victor Boyd and sent to Spain to ensure his El Greco is returned. Victor Boyd, the owner of the stolen El Greco, is a very rich and powerful businessman who Sandra works for as an art consultant. She is called in to find the stolen El Greco because she persuaded Victor to display it at the MNAC art museum, from which it was ultimately stolen. <ref>http://www.reelfilm.com/artheist.htm</ref> While getting ready for her trip to Spain to track down the missing El Greco, the audience is given some insight into Sandra’s life: She is separated from an NYPD detective, Bruce ([[William Baldwin]]), and they have a young daughter together, Allison ([[Madison Goeres]]) The couple appears to be going through a bit of a rough patch, but still seem to love each other. Sandra is able to convince her husband to watch their daughter while she’s away. Bruce is skeptical of the whole situation and worried about Sandra’s well-being.  Upon her arrival at the crime scene in Barcelona, Sandra is reunited with an old colleague of hers, Daniel ([[Abel Folk]]), who was brought in to consult on the investigation. It quickly becomes apparent these two have a deep history and there are many secret feelings. The two of them make a great team and quickly narrow down the list of suspects to the ruthless Russian mobster Dimitri Maximov ([[Simon Andreu]]) Dimitri is portrayed as a questionable individual who seems to be scheming some sort of master plan as the art heists continue. This plays right into Sandra and Daniel’s suspicion that he is the culprit.  Another El Greco is stolen during an auction that both Sandra and Daniel as well as all potential suspect attend.  While in the bathroom, Sandra observes one thief escaping. After alerting Daniel, they pursue the suspect through Barcelona but crash into a restaurant. After waking up in the hospital, Bruce and their daughter arrive from New York. Soon after, Sandra’s life is threatened in a park where she was together with her daughter and husband. The attacker demands that she leave Spain. However, Bruce chases them away and follows them on a motorbike. Although he manages to catch up with one attacker, they eventually flee after knocking him down. However, he managed to see the face of one of them as well as ripping a piece of his clothing which gave him a clue to a night club. When Maximov's yacht gets blown up with all the paintings, the original theory seems confirmed. Several clues point towards Sandra as a main accomplice. However, Sandra’s partner in the investigation, Daniel, who had been nothing but helpful and affectionate turns out to be the villain in a dramatic ending scene.  After Bruce and Sandra discover the paintings in Daniel's studio, Daniel kidnaps their daughter and sets up a meeting at a closed amusement park overlooking the sea where he arrives by helicopter with the last surviving thief (the others having been killed by him to keep his fee to himself). Daniel, in his capacity as an art professor, had been using his students to steal the art under orders from Sandra’s boss, Victor Boyd. Victor planned to frame Sandra by depositing large amounts of money in her bank accounts to make it appear as though she sold security information to the robbers. As the final scene unfolds and all of this information is revealed to the audience, we ask “Why?” As it turns out, Daniel was frustrated with his persistent failures as an artist while other artists around him flourished. He participated in this long and carefully thought-out scheme for his own revenge and Victor's promise to help him become famous. At the last moment, Bruce comes to the rescue of his estranged wife and daughter, only to be shot by Victor after subduing Daniel. Although it appeared as though Daniel and Victor were going to make a dramatic helicopter getaway, after Victor explained that he planned to kill Sandra and her daughter, Daniel had a change of heart and tried to protect them from Victor; only to be shot. Right before his death, Daniel passed Bruce his gun and with it Bruce was able to kill Victor. The movie ends with Sandra's family reunited.  
Art of the Devil
 ''Art of the Devil'' tells the story of Boom ([[Supaksorn Chaimongkol]]), a young Thai girl who meets  a married man named Prathan ([[Tin Settachoke]]) at a country club.  The two soon begin an affair, and Boom finds herself pregnant.  When she breaks the news to Prathan, he appears to settle for giving her a sum of money in exchange for her silence, reassuring her that he will not leave her. However, he then wakes her up in the middle of the night, informing her that for that large an amount of money, he had the right to share her.  While Prathan wields a video camera, his friends chase a terrified and screaming Boom out of the room and onto the beach, where they apparently gang-rape her.  After getting an ultrasound at the hospital, Boom shows up at the restaurant where Prathan's daughter is celebrating her birthday and informs him that the sum of money he had given her was not enough.  He pulls her outside and hits her, tossing a wad of cash at her and warning her not to come near his family again.  Furious, Boom enlists the aid of a [[black magic]] user to exact revenge on her ex-lover and his entire family, notably causing the eldest son to shoot his girlfriend and his little sister before turning the gun on himself.  After their deaths, Boom visits a temple and finds that if she donates coffins for the spirits, they will not bother her.  She makes some offerings.  While leaving the temple, she sees the ghosts of her victims in the back of a car and steps off of the sidewalk to get a better look, whereupon she is hit by a car.  The accident causes her to lose her baby.  Prathan's first wife inherits his fortune. She and her four children move into the house. Boom again uses black magic to kill this new family off.  However, her motive this time is not for revenge, but in order to claim the inheritance. A young newspaper reporter becomes suspicious, so Boom arranges for his death, as well. Throughout this, the ghost of Boom's dead daughter is seen around the house.  The story ends with only the youngest son and eldest daughter surviving the massacre. Boom voluntarily falls to her death from the roof of the hospital after seeing her daughter's ghost.  
The Aryan Couple
  Joseph Krauzenberg ([[Martin Landau]]) is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] '[[Final Solution]]' is sweeping through Europe.  The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's "Europa Plan", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to [[Switzerland]] for himself, his wife Rachel ([[Judy Parfitt]]), and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe.  Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – [[Adolf Eichmann]] ([[Steven Mackintosh]]) and [[Heinrich Himmler]] ([[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]]).  However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann ([[Kenny Doughty]]) and his wife Ingrid ([[Caroline Carver (actress)|Caroline Carver]]) are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews.  As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance. Young, married, in love and expecting their first child, they work as valet and maid for the elderly Jewish couple. They have everything to look forward to or so they would have believed.  In a sub-plot one of the officers, Edelhein ([[Christopher Fulford]]), the most repulsive of the group, pursues Ingrid Vassman – despite her pregnancy – as a perfect foil for implanting his precious seed in the 'Aryan beauty' to populate the new Germany.  As they serve the Nazis in their secret mission, Hans and Ingrid toy with the idea that they should kill Eichmann and Himmler for the greater good, even if it would mean certain death for the Krauzenbergs and themselves. Instead, the Vassmans, place their fate in the hands of the Krauzenbergs, to whom they express their admiration for and they end up ultimately confessing that they are Jewish and wish to escape with them,  Nothing can be done immediately – "if we had known we could have placed you on the list of people to come with us".   On his way to the plane that is to take him and his family to the safety of Switzerland, Josef Krauzenberg makes a unknown deal with a German Captain, called Dressler. Dressler then deceives Eichmann, thus giving the Vassmans the means to escape.  In the final climactic scene, the Vassmans are confronted at the last checkpoint before Switzerland by Edelhein, who has discovered Dressler's treachery and has pursued them for the so-called murder of a German soldier, and of course for being Jews. However, the Reichsfuhrer himself, hearing of the events, and wanting to avoid any bloodshed that could reveal his plot concerning the Krauzenbergs to a wider audience, has sent word that they should be allowed to pass freely and safely. Angered that he has lost his chance to 'plant his seed' in Ingrid, Edelhein, regardless of the Reichsfuhrer's orders, attempts to stop them passing. This results in his demise at the hands of the commanding Major, who shoots him dead before he manages to harm them.  The film ends with the couple being reunited safely in Switzerland with the Krauzenbergs.  
As It Is in Heaven
 Daniel Daréus ([[Michael Nyqvist]]) is a successful and renowned international [[conductor (music)|conductor]] whose life aspiration is to create music that will open people's hearts. His own heart, however, is in bad shape. After suffering a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on stage at the end of a performance, he retires indefinitely to [[Norrland]] in the far north of [[Sweden]], to the village where he endured a terrible childhood of [[bullying]].  Daniel buys the old [[elementary school]] in the village, and soon after is asked to come along one Thursday night and listen to the local [[choir]]. He is only asked to listen, and maybe offer some helpful advice, but their intentions of persuading him to help are obvious. He eventually agrees to help, albeit reluctantly. Daniel approaches the [[parish]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] to seek for the position of [[cantor (Christianity)|cantor]]. He starts helping the choir grow and develop, rediscovering his own joy in music.  Almost immediately, Lena ([[Frida Hallgren]]), an attractive young girl in the choir, catches his attention. As they grow closer and fall in love, he realises that he is surrounded by the villagers' personal problems. Inger ([[Ingela Olsson]]) is married to the respected minister, Stig ([[Niklas Falk]]), but has failed to develop a loving sexual relationship with her husband. Siv ([[Ylva Lööf]]) is so obsessed with morality that she cannot enjoy herself. Arne ([[Lennart Jähkel]]) is so ambitious for the choir's success that he obsesses over tiny mistakes, failing to see that he is making bigger mistakes himself. Tore ([[André Sjöberg]]) is mentally handicapped and shunned but is eventually included in the choir; Holmfrid ([[Mikhael Rahm]]) has put up with being called "Fatso" by Arne since childhood and eventually stands up to him. Gabriella ([[Helen Sjöholm]]) is beaten and abused by her husband, Connie ([[Per Morberg]]), a fact that is known and ignored by the whole village. She eventually finds the strength to leave him, as the whole village finds its strength to help her. Connie himself turns out to be the bully who was at school with Daniel and drove him from the village. He blames the choir and Daniel for his wife's decision and beats him up. This lands Connie in jail. The minister, Stig, is jealous of the choir's success and tries to close it down. His failure precipitates his eventual nervous breakdown. The heart of each member of the choir starts to open, as it has always been Daniel's dream.  The choir is accepted into the annual "[[Let the Peoples Sing]]" competition (Arne has decided to register the choir without previous notice), and they journey to [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]], to perform. Lena fears Daniel will leave her for his sophisticated friends from the music world, when she see their kissing and hugging him. He dares at last to tell her he loves her and then they make love. On the day of the competition, the choir is ready on stage but Daniel is nowhere to be seen. His heart has been affected by his [[anxiety]], and he has another [[heart attack]]. Daniel staggers into the restroom, unsure of how to handle the situation, then stumbles and hits his head on the pipe below a sink, causing him to bleed severely. He lies helplessly on the tile, blood gushing from his head, listening to the choir harmonising over the loudspeakers. The audience in the auditorium is enchanted and sings along. Daniel smiles to himself and turns motionless, thus leaving the viewer to decide whether he lives or dies, completely fulfilled by reaching his goal.  The final scene shows Daniel rushing towards his younger self within the wheat fields as he embraces his life's goal, to "create music that will open a person's heart".  
The Assassination of Richard Nixon
  Samuel Bicke (the name was changed in the film to avoid offending living relatives) is shown to be a constant moralizer but also a deluded liar, making him a hypocrite. He clearly wants to reconcile with his estranged wife Marie but cannot accept that she's done with their marriage. He states that he stopped working for his brother because of lies, yet he also lies that he's happily married to get a job. He attempts to join the [[Black Panthers]], as he believes that discrimination affects poor white people just as much as it does [[African American|blacks]], but the Panther leadership just ignores him.  While out drinking with his new employer at an office furniture sales office, the employer describes Richard Nixon as the greatest salesman in history, because his election promise in 1968 was to exit the [[Vietnam War]], and he massively increased troop numbers but won an easy re-election in 1972 on a promise of ending the same war. His employer gives him patronizing advice, while his awkwardness makes him an abysmal salesman.  Throughout the film he becomes increasingly disillusioned with friends, family, his status in society, the lot of those who are employed and his job in particular. He decides to set up a mobile tire sales business so that he will no longer be employed by others, and applies for a government loan to set up the business.  Bicke then suffers several setbacks in short succession. His sales figures continue to deteriorate, and a failed flirtation with a female customer reveals his happy marriage claims to be false. He then desperately tries to get Marie to join him for a company event, but she refuses and later sends him a divorce decree in the mail, leaving him weeping in despair. Shortly afterwards, he deliberately tanks a sale and quits, and begins ranting when he sees President Nixon giving a speech on TV, repeatedly screaming "It's about MONEY, DICK!!!". With the feeling the loan will come through, he breaks into his brother's tire sales business to make a large order that will be delivered to his best friend and prospective business partner, Bonny.  However, the loan is rejected and Bicke comes home one night to find a notice on his door that his rent is past due, and his brother, Julius, waiting inside. Julius reveals that the vendor became suspicious and contacted police, and Bonny was arrested for receiving stolen goods, which Bicke pathetically tries to say is due to racism against the African-American Bonny. Julius has bailed Bonny out and smoothed things over with the police, but says he is done entirely with his brother and leaves. A broken Bicke then begins obsessing about Richard Nixon. One night, after he watches a news story about a helicopter pilot who did a fly-by around the White House and got arrested, he begins putting together a plan to hijack a passenger airliner himself and crash it into the White House.  Bicke closes his bank account, steals a gun from Bonny which he conceals on his leg, and heads to a restaurant where his old boss and colleague are dining. He aims the gun at the boss under the table, but cannot pull the trigger and flees. He goes to his and Marie's old house; he sleeps in the deserted, mostly barren home before he shoots and kills the family dog. The next morning, he goes to the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. He buys a ticket and waits in line to board his flight. Seeing the security procedures, he has a last minute change of plan and rushes on board the airplane, shooting a cop as he goes.  Once on board he haphazardly shoots one pilot in the head and the other in the shoulder, and finds a passenger to act as co-pilot. However, he is shot through the window in the plane's door. While the authorities close in on the plane, he commits suicide. The day's events are shown on TV, but his ex-wife and former best friend have no reaction to the mention of Bicke's name. Bicke then runs around his apartment with a toy plane and heads straight into the camera as the screen cuts to black. The film ends with a title card that says even if Bicke had managed to hijack the plane and crash it into the White House, his plan would have failed because Nixon was out of the office that day.

Bad Education (film)
 In 1980 Madrid, young film director Enrique Goded is looking for his next project when he receives the unexpected visit of an actor looking for work. The actor claims to be Enrique's boarding school friend and first love, Ignacio Rodriguez. Ignacio, who is using now the name Ángel Andrade, has brought with him a short story titled "''The Visit''" hoping that Enrique would be interested in making a film out of it giving him the starring role. Enrique is intrigued since "The Visit" describes their time together at the Catholic school and it also includes a fictionalized account of their reunion many years later as adults.  "''The Visit''" is set in 1977. It tells the story of a drag artist and transgender woman called Zahara, whose birth name is Ignacio. Zahara plans to rob a drunken admirer but discovers that the man is her boyhood lover Enrique. Next she visits her old school and confronts Father Manolo, who abused her when she was a boy. She demands one million pesetas from him in exchange for halting publication of her story "''The Visit''". The story is set in a Catholic boarding school for boys in 1964. At the school, Ignacio, a young boy with a beautiful singing voice, is the object of lust of Father Manolo, the school principal and literature teacher. Ignacio has found his first love and cinema in the company of Enrique, a classmate. One night, Manolo discovers them together and threatens to expel Enrique. In an attempt to prevent this, Ignacio gives himself to Manolo. The priest [[Child sexual abuse|molests]] Ignacio, but expels Enrique nonetheless.  Enrique wants to [[Film adaptation|adapt Ignacio's story into a film]], but Ángel's condition is that he plays the part of Zahara, the [[transsexual]] lead. Enrique remains skeptical, for he feels that the Ignacio whom he loved and the Ignacio of today are totally different people. He drives to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to Ignacio's mother and learns that the real Ignacio has been dead for four years and that the man who came to his office is really Ignacio's younger brother, Juan.  Enrique's interest is piqued, and he decides to do the film with Juan in the role of Ignacio to find out what drives Juan. Enrique and Ángel start a relationship, and Enrique revises the script so that it ends with Father Manolo, whom Ignacio was trying to blackmail to get money for [[sex reassignment surgery]], having Ignacio murdered. When the scene is shot, Ángel breaks out in tears unexpectedly.  The film set is visited by Manuel Berenguer, who is the real Father Manolo, who has resigned from Church duty. Berenguer confesses to Enrique that the new ending of the film is not far from the truth: the real Ignacio blackmailed Berenguer, who somehow managed to scratch together the money but also took an interest in Ignacio's younger brother, Juan. Juan and Manolo started a relationship and after a while realized they both wanted to see Ignacio dead. Juan scored some very pure [[heroin]], so that his brother would die by [[Drug overdose|overdose]] after [[Intravenous drug abuse|shooting up]]. After the crime, the relationship disintegrates; Berenguer wants to continue the relationship with Juan, but Juan is uninterested. Berenguer claims that he will never let Juan go, and Juan threatens to kill him if Berenguer continues to pursue him. Berenguer attempts to blackmail Juan for his part in the murder of Ignacio.  Enrique is shocked and not at all interested in Juan's weak vindications for what he did to his brother. Finally, before he leaves, Juan gives Enrique a piece of paper: a letter to Enrique that Ignacio was in the middle of typing when he died.  In the [[epilogue]], it is mentioned that Enrique releases his film later and achieves great success.

The Aviator (2004 film)
 In 1913 [[Houston]], eight-year-old [[Howard Hughes]]' mother gives him a bath and warns him about the recent [[cholera]] outbreak in [[Houston]]: "You are not safe." Fourteen years later, he begins to direct the film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'', and hires [[Noah Dietrich]] to manage the day-to-day operations of his business empire. After the release of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the end result and orders the film to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress [[Katharine Hepburn]], who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening [[OCD|obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)]].  In 1935, Hughes test flies the [[Hughes H-1 Racer|H-1 Racer]], pushing it to a new speed record. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in [[Trans World Airlines|Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA)]]. [[Juan Trippe]], company rival and chairman of [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American World Airways (Pan Am)]], gets his crony, Senator [[Owen Brewster]], to introduce the Community Airline Bill, which would give Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. Hepburn grows tired of Hughes' eccentricity, and leaves him for fellow actor [[Spencer Tracy]]. Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old [[Faith Domergue]], and later actress [[Ava Gardner]]. However, he still has feelings for Hepburn, and blackmails a reporter to keep reports about her and the married Tracy out of the press.  Hughes contracts two projects with the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] for: a [[Surveillance aircraft|spy aircraft]] and a [[Military transport aircraft|troop transport unit]]. In 1946, with the [[Hughes H-4 Hercules|''Spruce Goose'']] [[flying boat]] still in construction, Hughes finishes the [[Hughes XF-11|XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft]] and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight, and the aircraft crashes in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], with Hughes getting severely injured. With the end of [[World War II]], the army cancels its order for the H-4 Hercules, although Hughes still continues the development with his own money. When he is discharged, he is informed that he must choose between funding the airlines or his 'flying boat'. Hughes orders Dietrich to mortgage the TWA assets so he can continue the development.  As his OCD worsens, Hughes becomes increasingly paranoid, planting microphones and tapping Gardner's phone lines to keep track of her. The [[FBI]] searches his home for incriminating evidence of [[war profiteering]], searching his possessions and, to his horror, tracking dirt through his house. Brewster privately offers to drop the charges if Hughes sells TWA to Trippe, but Hughes refuses. Hughes' OCD symptoms become extreme, and he retreats into an isolated "germ-free zone" for three months. Trippe has Brewster summon him for a Senate investigation, certain that Hughes will not show up. Gardner visits him and personally grooms and dresses him in preparation for the hearing.  An invigorated Hughes defends himself against Brewster's charges and accuses the senator of taking bribes from Trippe. Hughes concludes by announcing that he has committed to completing the H-4 aircraft, and that he will leave the country if he cannot get it to fly. The bill is promptly defeated. After successfully flying the aircraft, Hughes speaks with Dietrich and his engineer, [[Glenn Odekirk]], about a new jetliner for TWA. However, the sight of men in germ-resistant suits causes Hughes to have a [[panic attack]]. As Odekirk hides him in a restroom while Dietrich fetches a doctor, Hughes begins to have flashbacks of his childhood, his obsession for aviation, and his ambition for success, repeating the phrase, "the way of the future".  
Autograph (2004 film)
 The romantic story begins with Senthil (Cheran) setting off on a journey, to invite his friends and family for his forthcoming wedding. Along the way, he encounters various individuals from his past, who bring back memories of three women that have influenced his love life.  The movie begins with Senthil, who runs an advertising agency, boarding a train to visit his native village to invite all his friends for his wedding. During the journey he reminisces his teenage days. The happenings in the school, his tussle with his friends and his first love with his classmate, Kamala ([[Mallika (actress)|Mallika]]), are all pictured with fun and drama. Senthil reaches the village and invites all including Kamala, who promises to come to the wedding, with her husband and three children.  Then, he goes to Kerala where he had his college education. His major crush at that time was Lathika ([[Gopika]]), a Malayalee girl, with whom he falls in love but later the affair proves to be short-lived as her parents marry her off to her cousin, Madhavan. On reaching Kerala to invite her, Senthil is slightly disturbed to see his ex-lover as a widow. He attempts to re-kindle his love for her, but she corrects him.  On his journey he comes across his trusted friend Divya ([[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]]), who instills confidence and elucidates him to the life lesson - that one has to go ahead in life without looking back. While she and Senthil travel on a bus, she reveals her tragic experience, that her mother is a paralytic patient and that she is the bread-winner of the family. As time passes by, she reveals that she was in love with someone and believed that he was the man of her life, but was let down.

Barbershop 2: Back in Business
 Since the events of the previous film, Calvin Palmer, Jr. has finally settled comfortably into his role as the owner of the inner city [[Barbershop (hair)|barbershop]] founded by his grandfather and father. The shop's latest threat comes from overzealous developer Quentin Leroux who opens a rival barbershop [[Chain store|chain]] across the street, called "Nappy Cutz".  While Calvin attempts to figure out how to deal with the coming threat of direct competition from Quentin's flashy establishment, his barbers have issues of their own. Isaac, the lone white barber, is now the star of the shop, and begins to feel that he deserves star treatment, feeling neglected by Calvin and the other barbers. Terri is finding success in managing her anger, but has trouble dealing with the growing mutual attraction between Ricky and her. Dinka is still interested in Terri, but is distraught when he finds out that she loves Ricky, instead. Jimmy has quit the shop to work for the local [[alderman]] Lalowe Brown; his replacement, Calvin's cousin Kenard, is fresh out of barber school and horribly inept at cutting hair. Meanwhile, the barbershop and other businesses like it are under threat from [[gentrification]], and Calvin is offered a substantial bribe from Brown and Leroux in exchange for his support of the city council's gentrification legislation.  A subplot involves Eddie recalling his time as a young man in the late 1960s, when he first started working at the shop with Calvin's father, including the [[King assassination riots|riots]] following the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Also, Eddie remembers his long-lost love, Loretta. This subplot causes Eddie and Calvin to begin bonding. The film also introduces Calvin's good friend and ex-lover, Gina, who works at the beauty shop next door. The girls at the beauty shop have similar conversations and experiences as the barbers and Gina has a bitter rivalry with Eddie.  After attempting to change his own barbershop's style and decor to match those of his rival, Calvin decides to refuse the bribe money and speak out against the neighborhood's gentrification at the local city council meeting. Though Calvin gives a passionate speech about the legislation helping the region to earn money at the cost of its soul and the community, the council still unanimously votes to approve the legislation and move forward with the project. Despite a mutual attraction, Terri and Ricky agree to remain friends (but not before sharing one last kiss). Dinka still loses out on Terri, but finds love with a stylist at Gina's beauty shop. Though the gentrification project is approved, the community remains loyal to Calvin's barbershop.  
Barbie as the Princess and the Pauper
 In an unnamed kingdom, a [[blonde]] [[princess]] and a [[brunette]] [[pauper]] are born simultaneously. The princess, Anneliese, craves freedom from her royal duties, especially because she wants to marry her tutor and true love, Julian. Despite this, she is informed by her widowed mother, Queen Genevieve, that she must marry the wealthy king of a nearby kingdom because their royal treasury is nearly bankrupt. The pauper, Erika, craves a different sort of freedom as she is an [[indentured servant]] at Madame Carp's Dress Emporium to work off her parents' debt, but dreams of becoming a singer and seeing the world.  Queen Genevieve doesn't know that the reason behind the kingdom's bankruptcy is her adviser, Preminger. He has been stealing the gold from the royal mines with his sidekicks, Nick and Nack, for a long time. His plan is to have Princess Anneliese go mysteriously missing and then bring her back, thus making the queen so grateful that she will ask him to marry Anneliese. Then Preminger can succeed to the throne and achieve all that he wants as the king.  While Anneliese is studying with Julian, he tells her that King Dominick (who is disguised as a page) and Ambassador Bismark have come to see her with an engagement gift, a necklace. The Queen wants the wedding to be a week from then, which gives Preminger less time to carry out his evil plan.  Julian takes Anneliese for a day out into the kingdom so that she can be free for once. Anneliese hears Erika singing and goes to listen. Erika is singing in the street to earn money for herself, but Madame Carp takes the money. Anneliese and Erika talk to each other and learn they are identical, apart from the crown shaped birthmark Anneliese has on her shoulder and their hair color. They become fast friends, and Anneliese returns to the palace. That night, she is being kidnapped along with her cat, Serafina, by Nick and Nack, who leave a letter saying she ran away.  Julian suspects that Preminger kidnapped Anneliese so he asks Erika to pretend to be the princess until she is rescued. Preminger is surprised when Erika, as Anneliese, comes to the palace because he thought she had already been kidnapped. King Dominick decides to reveal himself to Anneliese (who is really Erika in disguise) and walks in on her singing with her beautiful voice. Over time, Erika and Dominick fall in love, but Erika is worried about what will happen when people find out she is not Anneliese.  The real Anneliese has escaped from Nick and Nack. Julian is able to follow Preminger to the house where they had Anneliese and overhears Preminger's plans to become the king. He is discovered by the trio and gets kidnapped. Anneliese is turned away from the palace because the guards think Anneliese is already in there. She gets taken away by Madame Carp because she thinks Anneliese is Erika.  Preminger figures out that the Anneliese in the castle is an impostor. Anneliese had used her cat Serafina to take a clue to the castle about where she was. Unfortunately, it is Preminger and his dog Midas who gets the clue and is able to take the real Anneliese to the royal mines with Julian and tells his henchmen to collapse the mine with Anneliese and Julian trapped inside. He goes back to the palace, exposes Erika as a fake and accuses her and Julian of treason.  Erika is sent to the dungeon. She sings a lullaby to make the guard asleep and takes his keys so she can escape. As she does, she bumps into King Dominick. He tells her that he doesn't believe what Preminger said about her. In the mines, Anneliese and Julian find out how to restore the kingdom's resources from some rocks that have geodes in them. They confess their love and escape from the mines with an idea they get from Erika's barking cat Wolfie.  Preminger convinces the Queen that Anneliese is dead and says that they must marry to save the kingdom, and since she has no other options, she agrees. Before they can be married, Anneliese arrives and tells everyone the truth about Preminger, who, along with Nick and Nack, are later arrested. She tells her mother that she wants to marry Julian and that they can save the kingdom. Dominick and Erika say they wish to marry as well, and Madame Carp goes out of business.  Erika wants to sing so she doesn't marry Dominick right away, but she returns after realizing that sometimes being free means choosing not to go, but to stay. Anneliese and Julian, including Dominick and Erika, all have a double wedding together, and their cats, Serafina and Wolfie, have many, many, many kittens. They ride off happily together in their wedding carriage.  
Bangkok Loco
 Bay is a talented young [[Rock music|rock]] [[drummer]] in Thailand in the 1970s. One day, he is practicing on his drum set in his apartment and is in a [[trance]], but he suddenly notices that everything is covered in blood and that his drumsticks are actually knives. Apparently, he has killed his landlady, Mrs. Victoria. Panicked, he runs out his door, through the streets and alleys to his friend, Ton, who is also a drummer and is in a band called The [[personal computer|PC]] with Meow and Ooh. Despite Bay's circuitous flight to Ton's apartment, she only lives next door to him.  Ton is a long-time childhood friend of Bay, as the two were classmates at [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple where they were instructed by an old monk in the Drums of the Gods.  Meanwhile, the police have arrived at Bay's apartment, led by Inspector Black Ears. The inspector has a habit of trying to kick in doors that open to the outside. Whenever the inspector yells "Damn!" (''Batsop!'' in Thai), a man named Sombat appears and leans his head on the inspector's shoulder (''sop'' means to lean on shoulder). The inspector also has a smart dog named Dumbass to sniff for clues.  Through his drumming, Bay is able to convince Meow and Ooh that he is innocent. Had he actually killed Mrs. Victoria, Bay would have broken one of the Buddhist precepts and his Drums of the Gods skills would no longer be effective. So they all go on the run and hide out from the cops.  Bay and The PC make their way to a village fair, where The PC has been booked to play. Meow and Ooh sit around and make Bay do all the work to set up the stage. When he's finished, they plan to call the cops on him anyway. Soon the cops do show up and a chase around the village fair ensues, with the inspector pursuing Bay on the various carnival rides. Just as it looks like Bay will escape, the inspector is given a rifle and proves that he is an expert marksman. Bay, however, manages to catch one of the bullets with his drumsticks, but another finds its mark in Bay's shoulder. Bay ends up getting away and finds himself on a dam overlooking a reservoir. On the dam, he meets a man who is going to commit suicide, but Bay talks him out of it. Bay is then picked up by a passing truck and makes his escape just as the inspector and his men have caught up. The inspector witnesses the drowning of his dog Dumbass and also meets a polite boy in a red shirt (meant to resemble tennis pro [[Paradorn Srichaphan]]).  Bay has been picked up by a truck hauling films to the village fair, and so he joins the film company and works as a [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubber]] on the film. His performance is a hit, causing the audience to laugh their heads off. Afterward, Bay gives the man, who looks like [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]] [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] an idea to start a new political party called [[Thai Rak Thai|Thais Love Thais]].  Bay is eventually caught and jailed. However, Ton and The PC are in jail, too. After Bay sings a sad song that makes everyone cry, Meow and Ooh decide to help Bay escape. They are able to rig up an explosion and Bay runs away with Ton. She sees that Bay is under stress and guesses it must be because of the upcoming battle of the Drums of the Gods vs the Devil's Drums. Bay's and Ton's teacher, Professor Tuengpo, faced the dark side drummer [[Ringo Starr]] in the last competition 10 years ago. He defeated Ringo but also died in the aftermath of the duel, before he could reveal to Bay and Don the secret of the crucial 10th level of the Drums of the Gods. In order to overcome the forces of evil, Bay or Ton must somehow achieve the elusive 10th level, and neither of them feel they are ready. Thinking perhaps that sex will help them achieve the level, they check into a shabby guesthouse and hole up in a room.  While in the guesthouse, which is very dirty, Bay complains to the owner, Mr. [[Chuwit Kamolvisit|Chuwit]], and tells him that the rooms should all have bathtubs so guests can clean up. This apparently gives Chuwit the idea to start a chain of [[Prostitution in Thailand|massage parlors]], all with bathtubs in the massage rooms.  The police again catch up with Bay who is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, the medical examiner tells him that the body of the person Bay is suspected of killing is not Mrs. Victoria, but the police won't consider the evidence. However, the ME lets Bay leave the room.  Bay finds the drumming duel and sees that it is Ton who will face the new Devil's Drums master, who is named Mr. Davis. Bay then realizes that the secret to the 10th level of drumming was the [[hermaphrodite|double-sexed]] technique, which means his penis was cut off and attached to Ton, giving her the power.  There is a climactic drumming duel in a boxing ring, in which all styles of drumming are explored, and the result is that the Drums of the Gods are victorious.

Before Sunset
   Nine years before, Jesse and Céline had met and had a brief encounter in Vienna. Jesse's new novel, ''This Time'', was inspired by that night, and becomes a bestseller. He does a book tour in Europe, including Paris. He does a reading at the noted bookstore, [[Shakespeare and Company (bookshop)|Shakespeare and Company]]. Flashbacks express elements of his time with Céline in Vienna. Three journalists attend the reading to interview Jesse: one is convinced the book's main characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. As Jesse speaks with the audience, his eyes wander and he sees Céline there, smiling at him.  After the presentation, the bookstore manager reminds Jesse of his need to leave for the airport in about an hour for his plane. Céline and Jesse's time together is again constrained. They make the best of it, and their conversations become deeply personal. They begin with themes of work and politics and, with increasing passion, approach their earlier feelings for each other.  They touch on their failure to have met as planned six months after their first encounter. Jesse returned to Vienna but Céline did not, because her grandmother had died suddenly. Since the pair had never exchanged phone numbers, they had no way to contact each other at the time.  Their talk reveals how their lives have changed during the nine years they spent apart. Jesse, now a writer, is married and has a son. Céline has become an advocate for the environment, and has a photojournalist boyfriend. They each express some dissatisfaction with their lives.  They talk as they walk in Paris, with scenes showing a café, garden, ''[[bateau mouche]],'' and Jesse's hired car. Their former feelings are slowly rekindled, as their one night together looms large in memory, unmarred by ordinary trials. Jesse says his book was inspired by his hope of seeing Céline again. She says that it brought back painful memories. They begin to approach each other tentatively but pull back.  In the concluding scene, Céline and Jesse arrive at her apartment. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar. Her song is about their earlier brief encounter. Jesse puts a [[Nina Simone]] CD on the stereo system. Céline dances to the song, "Just in Time," as Jesse watches her. Céline imitates Simone, saying, "Baby ... you are gonna miss that plane." Jesse smiles and says, "I know."  
Being Julia
 Set in [[London]] in 1938, the film focuses on highly successful and extremely popular theatre actress Julia Lambert ([[Annette Bening]]), whose gradual disillusionment with her career as she approaches middle age has prompted her to ask her husband, [[stage director]] Michael Gosselyn ([[Jeremy Irons]]), and his financial backer Dolly de Vries ([[Miriam Margolyes]]) to close her current production to allow her time to travel abroad. They persuade her to remain with the play throughout the summer; and Michael introduces her to Tom Fennel ([[Shaun Evans]]), an enterprising American, who confesses his deep appreciation of her work. Seeking the passion missing from her marriage, and anxious to fill the void left when her close friend Lord Charles ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) suggested they part ways to avoid scandalous gossip, Julia embarks on a passionate affair with the young man and begins to support him so he may enjoy the glamorous lifestyle to which she has introduced him. Their relationship revives her, sparking a distinct change in her personality. Always hovering in the background and offering counsel is the spirit of her mentor, Jimmie Langton ([[Michael Gambon]]), the theatrical manager who gave Julia her start and made her a star, while flesh-and-blood Evie ([[Juliet Stevenson]]) serves as her personal maid, dresser, and confidante.  Michael suggests they invite Tom to spend time at their country estate, where he can become better acquainted with their son Roger ([[Tom Sturridge]]). At a party there, Tom meets aspiring actress Avice Crichton ([[Lucy Punch]]), and, when Julia sees him flirting with the pretty young woman, she becomes jealous and anxious and angrily confronts him. He slowly reveals himself to be a callous, social-climbing, gold-digging [[gigolo]], and Julia is shattered when their affair comes to an end.  Avice, now romantically involved with Tom, asks him to bring Julia to see her perform in a play in the hope the actress will induce her husband to cast her in a supporting role in Julia's upcoming project. The play is dreadful, and Avice is not much better. Backstage, Julia compliments her even-worse co-star and barely acknowledges Avice, although she promises to tell Michael about her. Afterwards, she forces Tom to admit he loves Avice, then - although her heart is broken by his admission - she assures him she will insist the [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] be cast in her next play.  When Julia's performance in her current play begins to suffer from her personal discontent, Michael closes the production; and Julia visits her mother ([[Rosemary Harris]]) and her Aunt Carrie ([[Rita Tushingham]]) in [[Jersey]], where Lord Charles comes to visit her. Julia suggests a romantic tryst, and he gently tells her that he's [[gay]]. Meanwhile, back in London, Avice auditions for Michael; and, although Julia resents it, she is given the role.  Julia returns home to begin rehearsals for the new play. Shortly after, she learns from her son that Avice has been one of Michael's casual trysts. Still, she is uncharacteristically solicitous toward the girl, making suggestions that place her in the spotlight and insisting her own wardrobe be drab to allow Avice to shine. What her director and fellow cast members don't realize is there's a method to her seeming [[Insanity|madness]] - Julia has planned her sweet revenge for the opening night performance, during which she successfully affirms her position as London theatre's foremost [[diva]] by upstaging every aspect of her performance.

After getting a job at the house with his mother, Binh discovers that she is sexually harassed constantly by Mrs. Hoa's son.  While dusting with his mother, Binh lifts a red glass statue of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], a precious family heirloom, to allow his mother to dust. As Binh lifts the statue to see it glow in the sun, the mistress walks in and charges Binh, calling him a thief. As Binh tries to keep the Buddha safe in his arms, the mistress slips on a wet patch of the floor, falling to her death. Binh and his mother quickly escape the house back to their apartment. They frantically pack the belongings of Binh and Tam. His mother gives them American money, the address of Binh's American father, and passage on a boat.  Binh and Tam both make it onto a boat bound for the United States, but a storm knocks them off course and instead takes them to [[Malaysia]]. Stuck in a [[refugee camp]], Binh and Tam adapt to their new circumstances and meet Ling, a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] prostitute whose passage to America was also detoured to Malaysia. Binh and Ling seem to develop feelings for each other, kissing after Ling sings a ballad in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and dances for him.  Ling had been selling sexual favors for some time (though she dreams of a life as a singer) and had managed to buy herself, Binh, and Tam's way out of the refugee complex and onto a barge captained by the [[United Kingdom|British]] Captain Oh. During the voyage Binh, Ling, and Tam suffer shortages of food and fresh water. A gambling game (two contenders shout off American brand names in succession) threatens the other passengers by unfairly winning their food, water, and money. Several people succumb to the conditions, as does little Tam. A heartbroken Binh and Ling give him a funeral at sea.  The immigrants finally reach the United States, but are quickly rushed into transport trucks, bound for [[Chinatown]] in [[New York City]]. Binh works at a [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]] as a delivery boy and Ling works in a Chinatown [[cabaret]], though she still keeps prostitution as her main source of income. Ling eventually meets a wealthy businessman to support her. Binh's feelings for Ling go unanswered. Binh sends a letter explaining Tam's death to his mother, along with all the money he had saved thus far.  Binh finds out (over a poker game with his friends) that Vietnamese children born to American fathers are allowed free airplane passage to the United States and granted citizenship. Angry because he didn't have to lose his brother, he promptly leaves his job and hitch hikes toward [[Houston, Texas]], meeting amputee [[Vietnam War]] veterans and a Hispanic family along the way. Upon reaching the address Binh finds a woman, his father's ex-wife. His father had relocated after their divorce, working as a handyman at a ranch in [[Sweetwater, Texas]]. Binh is finally confronted with his father, blinded after opening a crate filled with explosives he thought was beer during the war. While Binh doesn't confess that he's his son, his father realizes it and the film ends with Binh and his father joking and laughing as he cuts his father's hair.  
Before the Fall (2004 film)
 In 1942, Friedrich Weimer's ([[Max Riemelt]]) boxing skills earn him an appointment to a [[National Political Institutes of Education|National Political Academy]] (NaPolA), a high school that serves as an entry to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] elite. His father, a skilled factory worker who despises the Nazis, flatly refuses to allow Friedrich to enroll. Friedrich, who sees the school as his ticket to university and a better life, forges his father's signature on the permission form and leaves during the night. He makes his way to the town of [[Allenstein]], where the school is located, getting a ride from passing cars or trucks when possible and walking the rest of the way. Friedrich's forged papers are overlooked when he arrives, and he is greatly impressed in his first day at Allenstein.  However, Friedrich's idealistic view of Allenstein is soon tarnished by the harsh, rigid discipline that governs the school. Older students are able to bully younger students almost at will, since there is little interference from school officials, who not only encourage such behavior but actually participate in it themselves. One boy, Siegfried Gladen, endures repeated public humiliation for his tendency to wet the bed as he sleeps.  The school teaches the [[Nazi Party]] creed to its students, with sections of Hitler's speeches and writings being analyzed in classes. "[[Survival of the fittest]]" is advocated as the natural way of life, and [[Jews]] and all other enemies of the state are presented as treacherous and by nature [[Untermensch|inferior]]. The boxing trainer who got Friedrich appointed works with him one-on-one, teaching Friedrich to be hard and ruthless in fights, dismissing any kind of compassion for the other boxer as "bullshit". Back at his room, Friedrich receives a letter from his mother, informing him that his father has been paid a visit by the [[Gestapo]].  Friedrich visits Albrecht one evening, finding him in a writing and mail office that the students use. Albrecht confides that his talents lie in writing and the arts, areas his father sees as unfit for men. His mother is more supportive but is ultimately just as disinterested. Albrecht begins writing for the school newspaper, taking advice and criticism from Friedrich. When Friedrich has his first competitive boxing match against another NaPolA school, he gradually overpowers the other boy, knocking him down into a corner. Urged on by the shouts of his trainer and other students and officials, he delivers a brutal knockout punch, winning the match. Friedrich is congratulated by staff and students alike, but Albrecht is far less enthusiastic.  One day, the seventh-year boys are taken to the trenches on school grounds, where the sports instructor demonstrates use of live [[Model 24 grenade|stick grenades]]. Each of the boys in Friedrich's year make the throw successfully, until one boy, Martin, panics and drops it. The sports instructor screams at him and flees the trench, leaving the boys to their fate. At that moment, Siegfried Gladen pushes through the ranks and dives on the grenade barely a second before it explodes. Gauleiter Heinrich Steiner arrives to make a speech at the funeral, praising Siegfried Gladen as a martyr of the Fatherland and posthumously awarding him the [[Lifesaving Medallion]].  Albrecht invites Friedrich to come with him to the Steiner family's home, a vast mansion in the countryside. Heinrich Steiner returns home for his birthday, treated to a special dinner by his wife and a group of friends from the Nazi Party, German Army, and Waffen-SS. He wastes no time criticizing Albrecht for his polite, artistic manner and lack of athletic talent. A boxer himself, Heinrich Steiner is far more interested in Friedrich than in his own son, and delights in Albrecht's inability to even compete with Friedrich when the two are taken downstairs and forced to fight a boxing match.  During the winter, a group of military vehicles arrives at the school at night. The entire seventh-year class is called outside, where Gauleiter Heinrich Steiner informs them that a group of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Prisoner of war|POW's]] have overpowered their guards, stolen weapons, and escaped from the nearby village. The boys are armed with [[Karabiner 98k]] rifles and sent into the woods to search for them. Friedrich and Albrecht, assigned to the same group, end up deep in the frozen woods. Abruptly, a group of figures come out of hiding and try to run back over the crest of a nearby hill, ignoring the boys' shouts to halt. The boys open fire, shooting each of the Russians. Moving closer, they are shocked to find that not only were none of the prisoners armed, but they were all young boys, no older than the German students. A horrified Albrecht vainly tries to bandage the wounds of one prisoner still left alive, but his father arrives with a search party and shoots the Russian. As the boys are taken back to Allenstein, they see the rest of the POW's being rounded up and hear a long, rattling fusillade of gunfire in the woods.  In class the next day, Albrecht reads aloud an essay in which he condemns the execution of the Soviet POW's as a criminal act and his own participation in it as "evil". Outraged, school authorities summon his father, who coldly informs Albrecht that he will write a new essay, starting with an apology for his previous statements. Albrecht instead writes a second essay in which he condemns his father for ordering the POW's executed. Learning that Albrecht is to be expelled from school and drafted into the [[Waffen-SS]] to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], Friedrich asks what he will do next. Albrecht answers, "I don't know."  The next morning, the sports instructor wakes the boys up early and orders them out onto the frozen lake near the school. Two holes have been made in the ice, and each boy must dive in one and swim to the other, using a rope that the first pulls through as a guide. Friedrich makes the swim through the freezing water, but Albrecht dives in and doesn't come out. Friedrich finds him halfway between the holes, having deliberately halted under the ice. Hearing Friedrich's shouts, Albrecht looks up and gives a slight shake of his head. Touching a hand to the underside of the ice, Albrecht lets go of the rope, sinking deep into the freezing water and vanishing from sight. Deeply grieved, Friedrich writes an obituary for his friend and asks the headmaster to publish it in the school newspaper, but the headmaster refuses, stating that "Amidst people who have died for Fuehrer, Fatherland, and Nation, there is no place for suicides."  The upcoming boxing match against the NaPolA school in [[Potsdam]] is a great source of interest for both schools. Friedrich, who has been accused of complicity in Albrecht's death by his indifferent father, is told that his future at Allenstein is very much tied to the outcome of this match. Scouts from prominent German universities are watching, as well as Allenstein's headmaster and Gauleiter Heinrich Stein. Despite managing to overpower his opponent, Friedrich now hesitates to strike a fallen opponent. The other boy gets back up and begins punching Friedrich, who does not retaliate. Friedrich stands impassively until he is knocked out, turning what nearly was a victory for Allenstein into a humiliating defeat. As the camera gradually blurs the scene out of focus, Friedrich, knocked out and lying on the floor, closes his eyes and smiles with relief.  Friedrich is expelled the next day. He is not allowed to speak to any of his roommates as he leaves, and is taken to the gates by the sports instructor with the same suitcase and summertime clothes that he arrived in. The instructor shoves Friedrich out the front gates and closes them in his face. A defeated Friedrich looks back at Allenstein briefly, then begins walking, soon disappearing into the falling snow.  A closing narration states:  ''Until 1945 there were in the German Reich around 40 National Political Educational Institutes with more than 15,000 students. When the war was finally acknowledged as being lost, they were sent out into the "Final Struggle". Blinded by instructed fanaticism and insufficiently armed, they still offered bitter resistance in many battles. Half of them died.''  
Benji: Off the Leash!
  The film starts with the understanding that the makers of the [[Benji (1974 film)|Benji films]] are going to various towns in the U.S. looking for the next dog to play Benji. In a small [[Mississippi]] town, a freelance, abusive dog breeder named Hatchett keeps a backyard kennel under poor conditions behind his home. He lives with a young boy named Colby and his mother and is verbally and physically abusive to them, but Colby loves dogs and secretly nurtures a female black dog, Daisy, who is Hatchett's top breeder.  He goes to an abandoned house in the neighborhood and takes food and water to the black dog so she can produce milk for her new pups.  Hatchett learns of this and accuses Colby of stealing his most prize breeder, then orders Colby to take the black puppies, but abandons a fluffy, light-colored "[[Mixed-breed dog|mongrel]]". Over several months, Colby secretly cares for the puppy, and she grows into the unnamed fluffy dog that will become Benji.  Meanwhile, two Animal Control officers named Livingston and Sheldon come across a shaggy dog that is impossible to catch. A local elderly man, Zachariah Finch, offers food to the stray at his home in the woods and becomes attached to him. The dog is dubbed "Lizard Tongue" by the officers looking for him (due to its long tongue always hanging out of its mouth). When the fluffy dog sees that her mother is sick in the kennel, she opens her cage and helps her escape. Then she gets Lizard Tongue to help when she is too weak to eat, and they both draw the Animal Control officers to the abandoned house and the ailing black mother dog. At the shelter, a veterinarian determines she is dying from over-breeding and poor care, so the shelter director and the local sheriff authorize the vet to spay the dog.  When Hatchett learns that the Benji film producer is in town and wants the fluffy dog to be the new Benji, he intimidates Colby into lying about being the owner. At the shelter, the fluffy dog is reunited with her mother, and Colby tells everyone the truth about the dog, which makes Hatchett lose his temper, which makes Ozzie take him out and get arrested, then states that in the meantime, Hatchett won’t do any more harm to them. The end credits show various scenes from the film as they were shot and make reference to the origins of the shelter dogs used in the film.

Huang is first introduced into the movie, with two of his fellow bookie friends drinking at a coffeeshop. He then shares his thoughts about the gambling issues in Singapore, in which his sister then enters trying to lecture him, which he refuses to heed her advice. Shun and Richard are then introduced in a phone call Huang makes to Richard, where it is shown Shun goes beyond the speed limit and is caught. They later rush to work, late for a meeting. The latter in which results in a disgraced Richard unwanted of his proposal and Shun fired from his job.  While clearing his desk, Shun, together with Richard are approached by their colleagues. A woman named Coffee-Lady wishes to ask for digits, which exasperates Shun who tries to tell her about her addiction. While Shun leaves, the colleagues and Richard talk about benefactors as a way to pick numbers, which ridicules the way how even the worse people can be a benefactor to one. The discussion goes on later back in the coffeeshop with the three friends just as they offer prayings.  Before Shun meets back with his friends, he is caught beating a red light, and throws a rock at the [[road safety camera|red light camera]]. Unknown to him, a van also beats the red light and catches him attempting to destroy the camera.  The three friends return to the stall, with Hui Min wishing to lend an encyclopaedia to her brother which enrages him, making her think that it will ruin his luck to win in his gambles. A fake monk shows up near the bak kut teh stall and recommends the [[4-Digits|4D]] number 3791, but Huang, who is skeptical of fake monks, refuses to buy the number, especially after the feud with his sister. A fellow stallholder (Tony Koh Beng Hoe) buys the number just then. When the number comes out, Huang lashes out at Hui Min, blaming her that the number came out and he she had supposedly ruined his luck.  Shun has trouble paying the instalments for his condominium, and his girlfriend Evita compounds his financial woes by demanding he buy her expensive gifts. Huang suggests Shun rent out a room in the condominium to two of Huang's friends, who moved from China to Singapore. Although this causes a furious Evita to dump Shun, he is touched by the gesture, and suggests Huang and Richard start a business with him. They welcome the idea, and take a bank loan to fund the business.  Things go well with the business as they prepare everything for a stall and even a grand opening ceremony. Everything goes fine at the opening ceremony until the official opening where the trio cut the red ribbon.  Unfortunately, at the opening ceremony of their business, Shun is arrested and sentenced to jail for breaking the red light camera and housing Huang's friends, who turn out to be [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]].

Richard and Huang visit a remote Chinese Fortune God shrine in the wilderness, which Huang manages to ask for good numbers, turning out to be the numbers 7272. Somehow, others also get the number.  Thus, Huang and Richard try to clear their debts by borrowing from a [[loan shark]], but the police ambush them at the coffeeshop. While Huang hides in a public toilet, he refuses to comply with a policeman and beats him up, but he is later succumbed to. Huang is arrested and sentenced to jail for illegal [[Bookmaker|bookmaking]] and causing hurt to a public servant, but he was temporarily bailed out to settle family matters. Richard is now left alone.  Coincidentally, Huang, Shun and the fake monk are incarcerated in the same cell. The fake monk recommends the number 7272, exactly the same number Huang had received in the wilderness. As the fake monk had previously recommended the number 3791, which came out, Huang and Shun are determined to buy the number. After a discussion with Richard, who also wishes to buy the number, they agree that Richard will place a joint bet, paying S$100 for each person.  When the number comes out, Richard's wife tempts him to keep all the winnings, because Huang and Shun had not paid for their bets.

Bionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui
 The film begins with Turaga Vakama describing a land that existed before [[Locations in the Bionicle Saga#Mata Nui|Mata Nui]] called [[Locations in the Bionicle Saga#Metru Nui|Metru Nui]], where the local Toa were falling in battle as a relentless shadow sought to conquer the great city.  [[Lhikan]], the last remaining Toa, travels throughout the entire city, giving Toa stones to six [[List of characters in Bionicle#Matoran|Matoran]]: Whenua, Nuju, Matau, Onewa, Nokama, and Vakama.  After giving the last stone to Vakama, Lhikan is captured by two [[List of characters in Bionicle#Dark Hunters|Dark Hunters]], Nidhiki and Krekka. Vakama later meets the other Matoran at the Great Temple in Ga-Metru; there, they are transformed into six new Toa. After Vakama has a vision, they all set out to recover the six Great Disks hidden throughout Metru Nui, hoping to prove to [[List of characters in Bionicle#Turaga|Turaga Dume]], the city's leader, that they are worthy Toa.  However, Dume issues that "small gifts" will not confirm them as Toa, and puts them to a grueling test instead.  When the six fail to pass, Dume denounces them as "imposters" and unleashes the [[List of characters in Bionicle#Vahki|Vahki]] (the city's law enforcers) upon them. In the ensuing chaos, Onewa, Nuju, and Whenua are captured while Vakama and the others escape the Coliseum by leaping into a chute system, with the Dark Hunters giving chase.  Vakama, Nokama, and Matau abandon the chute system at Ko-Metru when the Dark Hunters get the flow reversed and set out to find the other Toa and Lhikan, whom Vakama believes is still alive.  They hitch a ride on a Vahki transport to Po-Metru, where are ambushed by the Dark Hunters and flee from a herd of Kikanalo beasts.  Nokama discovers that her mask allows her to speak and understand foreign languages and persuades the Kikanalo to help them find Lhikan; Matau discovers his mask power (shape-shifting) along the way.  Meanwhile, Onewa, Whenua, and Nuju are trying unsuccessfully to escape when are approached by a mysterious Turaga, who explains that Toa mask powers are needed to escape and teaches them how to activate them.  Growing impatient, the Toa argue until Onewa's mind-control and Nuju's telekinesis mask powers activate, and Nuju uses his to create an escape route.  Whenua then discovers his mask power (night vision) before the four reunite with Vakama, Nokama, and Matau.  The Turaga then reveals himself to be Lhikan, who sacrificed his power to turn Vakama and company into Toa.  He inquires as to the safety of the "Heart of Metru Nui", which Vakama believed was Lhikan himself, but is actually the Matoran.  Vakama then discovers a small canister that contains Dume; the Dume from before was an impostor.  Pursued by the Vahki, the Toa, along with Lhikan, set out to stop the false Dume, who has summoned the Matoran to the Coliseum to be placed in canisters to sleep.  The false Dume reveals himself to be [[List of characters in Bionicle#Teridax|Makuta]] in disguise, and plunges the [[List of characters in Bionicle#Great Spirit Mata Nui|Great Spirit Mata Nui]] into slumber.  The Toa gather as many Matoran capsules as they can and race to escape the crumbling city.  On the way out, the Dark Hunters attack them again, but are killed, along with a Nivawk (Makuta's spy), when Makuta absorbs them.  As the group leaves Metru Nui, Vakama creates the legendary Mask of Time, which he unsuccessfully tried to do as a Matoran, from the Great Disks.  Makuta pursues and in the ensuing battle, Lhikan is killed protecting Vakama.  In an anguished rage, Vakama knocks the Mask of Time into the sea and defeats Makuta in combat using his newfound concealment mask power.  The Toa combine their powers to seal Makuta in a protodermis prison and move on to the surface, emerging on an island they name "Mata Nui", in honor of the Great Spirit.  There, they sacrifice their Toa power to awaken the Matoran and become Turaga.  Vakama gives Lhikan's mask to an injured Matoran named Jaller, to the cheers of the other Matoran and Turaga, and their new lives on Mata Nui begin.  
The Big Swindle
 Choi Chang-hyeok ([[Park Shin-yang]]) is driving in his car, when he suddenly finds himself followed by the police. In the following chase he tries to get away, but as his car emerges from a tunnel it goes over the side, down a cliff and he is killed in the burning wreck.  The reason he tried to get away, is that he had just left the Bank of Korea, where he was part of a scam, that got him and his four accomplices the neat sum of 5 billion won. He died, one of his accomplices was caught, and the other three disappeared – and so did all the money.  Eol-mae ([[Lee Moon-sik]]) was the one caught by the police, and they try to get him to talk and reveal the scam and his accomplices. In flashbacks we see how the plan was hatched, and get to know the criminals.

Birthday Boy (film)

We first meet him in the wreck of an [[aeroplane]], looking for a particular piece of war refuse – a bolt – to turn into a toy soldier for his collection. He sings a song about a bear. Upon hearing the unmistakable low whistle of a train in the distance he runs to the track and places the bolt on the rail. The train thunders past on its urgent mission to carry tanks to the front. Manuk stands mesmerised, and grins widely. Once the train has passed he retrieves the bolt which has become magnetised. He makes his way through the town, pretending to be a soldier engaged in house-to-house fighting until his attention is captured by the drone of aeroplane engines. Silently he watches them slowly cross the sky. His war game begins again as he crouches behind rocks on a ridge overlooking an area with houses jumbled together. A postman cycles down the road below Manuk’s hiding place. Manuk imagines he is with his dad, pinned down by enemy fire. “Dad, there are too many of them,” he cries as the sound of machine guns and [[artillery]] fire fill his head. “But we are braver than them,” his father replies in the game. Manuk picks up a rock as if it is a [[hand grenade]], expertly pulls the pin with his teeth and hurls it at the enemy crying “Dad, get down!” He waits, crouched, fingers in ears for the explosion which never comes. Instead, we hear the postman cry in surprise and pain, before crashing his bicycle and shouting at his unseen tormentor. Manuk slinks away and climbs the hill towards his home. He takes a key from a special hiding spot, and approaches the [[verandah]] in front of his house. He notices a parcel and hurries to open it. He pulls out an old leather wallet containing a faded black and white photograph of a man crouching with a child dressed as Manuk is now, but much younger. Manuk gently caresses the photograph with his thumb. He then pulls out a set of dog tags, and an old boot. He marches up and down in front of his house, wearing the boots as if he is a soldier on guard. Later, inside the house, he plays with the toy soldiers and tanks he has made from bits and pieces of metal he has found and falls asleep on the floor. His mother appears at the door, saying “Manuk, Mum is home”.

Investigators discover that the bombs were made of [[RDX]], smuggled into the city with the aid of customs officials and the border police.  In turn, the film traces the motive for the blasts to the [[Bombay riots]], the bloody warring between the Hindu and Muslim communities from December 1992 to January 1993, which left over 1500 people dead.

After the blast, the accomplices in the crime are forced to lead a life of anonymity and secrecy as it becomes evident that Mumbai police have started picking up the suspects one by one. To make matters worse, their passports seem to have been destroyed at the behest of Tiger Memon.

Blade: Trinity
 Vampires investigate an ancient tomb in the [[Syrian Desert]], which they believe belongs to Dracula, the first vampire. To keep Blade from interfering, they frame him for the murder of a human [[Familiar spirit|familiar]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents subsequently locate Blade's hideout and kill his mentor and friend, [[Abraham Whistler]]. Demoralized, Blade surrenders and is arrested.  The vampires' familiars have arranged for the authorities to turn Blade over to them. He is rescued by [[Hannibal King]] and Abigail Whistler, Abraham's daughter, who invite Blade to join their band of vampire hunters, the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]. From them, Blade learns that Danica Talos, an old enemy of King's, has revived Dracula, or "Drake", with the goal of using his powers to cure vampires of their weaknesses. As the first of the vampires, Drake's DNA is untainted and he is able to survive in sunlight.  Along with newly-innovative [[ultraviolet]] "[[Sun dog]]" [[ammunition]], the Nightstalkers have created an experimental [[bioweapon]] known as Daystar, capable of killing vampires at the genetic level. However, they need a purer blood source to make it effective. As Drake is too powerful to kill via normal means, they hope that the virus will kill him and, with his blood in the mix, ensure the rest of the species is wiped out, but also fear that this will include Blade, too.    Eager to test Blade, Drake isolates him from the Nightstalkers, as he considers them unworthy of challenging him. He explains that all humans and vampires are inferior in his eyes and that he intends to wipe them from the Earth.  Abigail finds evidence of the vampires "Final solution": a network of 'farms' where comatose humans are drained of their blood for vampire consumption. Told the humans are all brain dead, Blade [[Euthanasia|deactivates]] the farm's life support systems.  Returning to the Nightstalkers's hideout, Abigail and Blade find all of them dead except for King and Sommerfield's daughter Zoe, both of whom have been taken captive. A recording left by Sommerfield, Daystar's creator, reveals that Drake's blood is all that is needed to make it complete and effective. King is tortured by the vampires for information, but refuses to talk, even when they threaten to turn him and feed him Zoe's blood.  Blade and Abigail arrive and free the captives. Drake eventually bests Blade in single combat and prepares to kill him with his own sword. Abigail fires the Daystar arrow, but Drake catches it before it strikes him. He drops it to the floor by Blade, not realising the danger it poses to him. At the last second, Blade stabs him with it, triggering a chemical reaction that completes the "Daystar" virus, releasing it into the air, the virus becomes airborne, killing Danica and the rest of the vampires. As Drake slowly succumbs to his wounds and the virus, he praises Blade for fighting honorably, but warns him that he will eventually succumb to his need for blood, thus proving that Blade already is the new type of vampire.  Using the last of his power, Drake disguises himself as Blade. The FBI recover the body and declare Blade legally dead (In the unrated cut, as the FBI tries to do an autopsy on "Blade", Drake springs back to life, killing several of the autopsy members before ominously looming over one of the orderlies). Hannibal narrates that the virus didn't kill Blade as the human half of his heart didn’t stop beating, it only slowed down, causing him to enter into a comatose state until his body was ready to fight again. Blade awakens several months later ready to continue his fight against the vampires.

 Two 13-year-old [[blindness|blind]] girls Marie and Inga are close friends in a boarding school for the blind, and share a love for music.  The girls are fairly sheltered in their school, and have a motto, "Trau bloß keinem Gucki!" ("Don't trust a "lookie"" [sighted person]).  They try out for a school band, but despite their musical skills they are turned away for their blindness.  Then Marie meets a young émigré from Kazakhstan, "Herbert" (Oleg Rabcuk), and hides him from the police in the school, with the help of the sighted caretaker Mr. Karl (Dominique Horwitz).  Herbert needs money to return to his homeland, against his father's wishes.  Inga proposes that the three form a band of clowns (which is what the German name of the film implies) to play music in the street, "The Blind Flyers", with Herbert pretending to be blind as well.  The band is successful—for a time.  According to the director, the film was not supposed to be about blindness ''per se'', and aimed to portray blind people as normal.

Just when it seems their dreams are impossible, the couple are given the opportunity to receive free treatments from a new, and relatively unheard of, fertility clinic. The Spiritus Research Clinic is in [[Lakeview, New York|Lakeview]], a small town two hours away, and they move to the clinic.  It soon becomes clear something is amiss. In the laboratory where the couple's eggs and sperm samples are being mixed, the scientist takes a large, engraved metal needle and injects a red substance into Craig's sperm without the couple's knowledge. After the treatments, they are overjoyed when it is discovered Samantha is pregnant with twins.  Earlier in the film, Craig was introduced at a party to book publisher Earl Sidney. Suddenly the publisher wants to publish Craig's book and offers Craig $100,000 as an advance.  The pregnant Samantha begins feeling unusually painful scratching from the unborn twins. She is also suspicious of her husband's new business associate and friend. She feels ignored and distanced from Craig.  Meanwhile, a hooded stranger begins stalking Samantha. Samantha becomes friends with a priest, Father Carlo. It is he who tells Samantha she is the unknowing victim of a pact with evil. The book publisher and the scientists at the clinic are connected to "The New Light of Dawn" church, a secret [[Theistic Satanism|devil-worshiping]] cult. The red liquid injected into the Howards' [[Test tube|test-tube]] pregnancy was the Devil's DNA. The cult plans to kidnap the babies shortly after birth and raise them to eventually destroy mankind. Father Carlo tells Samantha to drink a poison that will kill the babies, but she smashes the glass against his face. The crazed priest is also the hooded figure that has been following Samantha and sets the motel room he had taken her to on fire. He then gets in a car and drives away towards the clinic, with the intention to destroy it. He crashes through one operating room to another until crashing into Dr. Leeds' office. Gasoline spills on the priest as he tells the doctor "He who walks with Satan shall burn in Hell" and then sets himself on fire with a lighter.

We cut to see the man making the call, Ramon. He informs Broddick that his "package" has arrived overseas from [[South America]] and is being delivered. Broddick is delighted and promises lucrative compensation to Ramon for his work.  As they drive, something goes wrong; whatever is sealed inside the back of the truck has awakened and become enraged. The convoy stops. Ramon gets a [[tranquilizer]] gun and orders a panel to be opened. Unfortunately, a serpentine tail smashes through the panel and begins to wreak havoc. One of the men is startled and fires his gun, accidentally hitting the main control circuit on the back of the truck. The main door of the sealed container opens, and an abnormally large, nightmarish [[reticulated python]], about 80 feet long, emerges and kills the group, but not before Ramon manages to detonate a [[bomb]], destroying the convoy, but not the snake.  Broddick reveals his plan to bring extreme [[Game (food)|big-game]] [[hunting]] to the city, as yet another pastime for the mega-wealthy, and the python is to be the quarry.  Broddick then sees a news report detailing the destruction of Ramon's convoy. Now realizing the python has escaped, Broddick decides to bring his [[Big-game hunter|big-game hunting]] associates to their prey.   [[FBI]] Agent Alan Sharpe ([[Kirk B.R. Woller]]) investigates the wrecked convoy and discovers a large snake scale on the wreckage. Quickly realizing what he is up against (Agent Sharpe is familiar with the events in the film ''[[Python (film)|Python]]''), Sharpe is determined to prevent the snake from killing more people. He enlists [[herpetologist]] Dr. Steven Emmett ([[David Hewlett]]) and [[marine biologist]] Monica Bonds ([[Jaime Bergman]]) to devise a plan to stop the python. They plan to merge Monica's [[dolphin]]-camera headgear and tracking system to Dr. Emmett's giant 70 foot, genetically enhanced [[Boa constrictor|Scarlet Boa]] named Betty. They hope Betty will seek out and kill the python.  The trio, now joined by a backup team of [[FBI]] agents and [[US Army]] soldiers, transports Betty to the water treatment facility. She quickly enters and begins to track the python. The tracking system proves faulty, providing only sporadic coverage.  Broddick and his surviving hunters enter the opposite end of the treatment facility and begin to track the reptile. They are surprised when they stumble upon a nest of [[snake|eggs]], guarded by Betty, whom they had not expected to see. Betty constricts Eve, killing her, which causes Broddick to snap. Eventually, he makes his way out (the rest of his team is killed by both Betty and the python). Broddick finally meets up with Dr. Emmett and Monica. The python devours the eggs, enraging Betty, and the two snakes finally begin their epic battle.  Broddick is taken into custody. The tracking system starts to function again, and Dr. Emmett finally sees Betty's nest. He decides to go back into the treatment facility to save the nest. Monica goes with him. Broddick, however, has sneaked away and commandeered an [[Armored personnel carrier|APC]]. Dr. Emmett and Monica, using the tracking system, track Betty to underneath a [[nightclub]].

Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius
  In 1936, golfer [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], while traveling to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], makes a stop in [[Scotland]] to visit the [[Old Course at St. Andrews]]. Anxious about his reception, he is warmly welcomed by many spectators, some of whom have closed their local shops for the day to watch him play.  The scene changes to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where Jones, a young boy, observes his father "Colonel" Jones playing golf, poorly. The more young Bobby watches, the more he emulates the better players he sees, such as [[Stewart Maiden]], a club professional originally from Scotland. By the time he is 14, Jones wins the 1916 Georgia State Amateur Championship and makes the quarterfinals of the [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur]] that same year. Notable sportswriters of the era such as O.B. Keeler and [[Grantland Rice]] take a keen interest in him.  With [[World War I]] coming to an end, Jones participates in war-relief matches with several famous golfers such as the colorful [[Walter Hagen]], who eventually becomes Bobby's chief rival on the course. He also attends [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], where he receives a diploma and meets Mary Malone, whom he ultimately marries. Despite his great skill as a golfer, he also has a hot temper that affects his game and reputation. His first time at [[Old Course at St Andrews|St. Andrews]], in [[1921 Open Championship|1921]], Jones walks off the course after 11 holes of the third round, expressing his dislike for the course. His idol [[Harry Vardon]], who would win [[The Open Championship]] six times during his career, cautions Bobby never to quit, particularly at St. Andrews, which he considers the greatest golf course of all.  In 1923, Jones finally overcomes his temper troubles and wins his first major championship at the [[1923 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], defeating [[Bobby Cruickshank]] in a playoff. In the following years, great success follows as Bobby wins 2 more U.S. Opens, 4 U.S. Amateurs, and 2 Open Championships through 1929. During that timeframe, Jones attends [[Harvard College]] and later [[Emory University School of Law]], becoming a lawyer by profession (which was his grandfather's wish), never turning professional as a golfer. By 1930, Jones begins to lose interest in tournament golf. He tells Mary his final goal is to win all 4 majors in the same year and will then retire. That year, Jones accomplishes that goal, becoming the first and still only golfer to win the calendar [[Grand Slam (golf)|Grand Slam]]. Soon after, Bobby keeps his word and he shocks the sports world by retiring from tournament golf at only 28 years old.  A title card reveals that after retirement, Jones would continue to make contributions to the game of golf such as founding the [[Augusta National Golf Club]] and [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]]. He served in the [[United States Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. In 1948, Jones was diagnosed with [[syringomyelia]] which crippled him for the rest of his life until his death in 1971.

The Bourne Supremacy (film)
 Two years after their disappearance, [[Jason Bourne]] and Marie Kreutz are in [[Goa]]. Still experiencing [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] about his life as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assassin, he records them in a notebook.  In Berlin, a CIA agent working for [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Pamela Landy is paying $3 million to an unnamed Russian source for the "Neski files", documents on the theft of $20 million seven years prior. The deal is interrupted by Kirill, an agent for Russia's [[Federal Security Service]] who works for [[Russian oligarchs|oligarch]] Yuri Gretkov. First Kirill plants two explosive devices on the building's electrical circuit. One takes out the power to the building, the other does not go off but has Bourne's fingerprints on it in order to frame him. Kirill then kills the agent and the source and steals the files and money. Gretkov then sends Kirill to Goa to kill Bourne, but Bourne spots him and flees with Marie. Kirill shoots and kills Marie instead of Bourne, as Marie and Bourne had swapped seats in the vehicle. Their vehicle plunges into a river and Bourne leaves and travels to Naples.   After finding Bourne's fingerprint, Landy asks Deputy Director Ward Abbott about Operation Treadstone, the defunct CIA program to which Bourne belonged. She tells Abbott that the CIA agent who stole the $20 million was named in the Neski files. Some years previously, Russian politician Vladimir Neski was about to identify the thief when he was murdered by his wife in a Berlin hotel. Landy believes that Bourne and Treadstone's late supervisor, Alexander Conklin, were somehow involved and that Bourne killed the two people. Both Abbott and Landy go to Berlin to capture Bourne.  In Naples, Bourne allows himself to be identified by security. He subdues his CIA interrogator and [[Phone cloning|copies the SIM card]] from his cell phone. From the subsequent phone call, he learns about Landy and the frameup. Bourne goes to Munich to visit Jarda, the only other remaining Treadstone operative. Jarda informs Bourne that Treadstone was shut down after Conklin's death, and tries to incapacitate him. Bourne kills Jarda and escapes before the CIA arrives. Bourne follows Landy and Abbott as they meet former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons to question her about Bourne. Believing that the CIA is hunting him again, Bourne calls Landy from a nearby roof and is told of the reason for his pursuit. He demands a meet-up with Nicky and indicates to Landy that he can see her in the office, shocking the entire CIA team.  Bourne kidnaps Nicky at the meet-up in [[Alexanderplatz]], and learns from her that Abbott was the head of Treadstone, not Conklin. He remembers that he murdered Neski in Berlin, but Nicky knows nothing about it, so he lets her go. Bourne then visits the hotel where the killing took place and recalls more of his mission—he killed Neski on Conklin's orders, and when Neski's wife showed up, he shot her to make it look like a [[murder–suicide]].  Danny Zorn, Conklin's former assistant, suspects that Bourne was not involved. He explains his theory to Abbott by showing the bomb with Bourne's fingerprint that had not gone off. Abbott kills Zorn and heads back to his hotel. Bourne breaks into Abbott's hotel room and records a conversation between him and Gretkov that incriminates them in the theft of the $20 million. Abbott admits to Bourne that he stole the money, ordered Bourne to murder Neski, ordered Kirill to retrieve the files, and have Bourne framed and silenced in Goa. Abbott expects Bourne to kill him, but Bourne refuses, believing Marie's wishes not to kill, but leaves his gun on the table. After Bourne leaves, Landy confronts Abbott about her suspicions and he commits suicide. Later, Landy returns to her hotel room where she finds an envelope containing the tape of Abbott's conversations with Gretkov and Bourne. Listening to the tape, she realizes that Bourne is now vindicated.  Bourne travels to Moscow by train to find Vladimir Neski's daughter, Irena. Kirill, tasked once again by Gretkov with killing Bourne, finds and wounds him. Bourne flees in a stolen taxi and Kirill chases him. After a long high-speed chase, Bourne forces Kirill's vehicle into a concrete divider. Bourne walks away, leaving a seriously wounded Kirill. Gretkov is subsequently arrested. Bourne locates Irena and confesses to murdering her parents; after apologizing, he leaves.  Later in New York, Bourne calls Landy; she thanks him for the tape, reveals to him his original name and date of birth, and asks him to meet her. Bourne says, "Get some rest, Pam. You look tired."

Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)
 The film begins shortly before Bridget's mother's ([[Gemma Jones]]) annual Turkey Curry Buffet. [[Bridget Jones|Bridget]] ([[Renée Zellweger]]) is ecstatic about her relationship with Mark Darcy ([[Colin Firth]]). However, Bridget's confidence in her relationship is shattered when she meets Mark's assistant, a beautiful, slim and quick witted Australian named Rebecca Gillies ([[Jacinda Barrett]]). Bridget meets her ex, Daniel Cleaver ([[Hugh Grant]]), at her job for TV morning show ''Sit-Up Britain'' and is offered a position alongside Cleaver in a new travel tv series. Bridget initially refuses and declares that Daniel is a "deceitful, sexist, disgusting specimen of humanity". Bridget eventually relents and agrees to sign on to the project, despite her friends' serious misgivings.  Bridget is delighted when Mark invites her to the "Law Council Dinner", assuming he will propose afterwards, but the night does not end well. She is overdressed for the event, wearing a gold dress while everyone else is wearing serious lawyer black; the hairdresser has ruined her hair, which her friends hurriedly repair at her flat; she heavily rouges her cheeks in the taxi and then as a final debacle, makes a critical error in the trivial quiz that almost causes her team to lose with a question about Madonna. Rebecca Gillies wins the night by chiming in with the correct answer. Bridget's confidence is thoroughly deflated.  After the "Law Council Dinner", Mark and Bridget have an argument and she walks away from him in a huff. Mark goes to Bridget's apartment, apologizes, and tells her he loves her for the first time. Later in the night, Mark asks Bridget if she'd like to go on a ski holiday in [[Lech (Vorarlberg)|Vorarlberg]], Austria. Once on the slopes, she learns Rebecca recommended the vacation spot to Mark. While on the holiday, Bridget suspects she's pregnant; after an argument concerning the upbringing and education of their future children, the pregnancy test proves negative. After they return home, Bridget and Mark attended a scheduled lunch with both of their parents. When the subject of marriage comes up during conversation, Bridget is hurt by Mark's comment that it's not something they're even thinking about yet.  Bridget overhears a message from Rebecca on Mark's answering machine and discusses it with her friends, who advise Bridget that "If Mark says 'I refuse to dignify that question with an answer', then you know he's having an affair". Bridget asks the question, Mark responds predictably and Bridget breaks up with him. She travels to Thailand with her friend, Shazzer ([[Sally Phillips]]) and Daniel Cleaver to film "The Smooth Guide". Bridget and Daniel film the show, visit several exotic locations and flirt while off duty. Bridget loses faith in Daniel again when she is in his hotel room and while getting ready to romance, notices that a Thai prostitute has arrived for him. She decides he has not changed.  During the Thailand vacation, Shazzer has a fling with a younger British man called Jed. While packing up for their trip back home, Shazzer asks Bridget to put Jed's ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]) gift in her bag. Bridget is arrested and sent to a Thai prison after airport security dogs detect a large stash of [[cocaine]] inside the gift. In prison, Bridget spends her time sharing stories with the inmates, giving relationship advice and teaching them how to sing and dance to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]". Mark arrives to tell Bridget that his superiors have sent him to put her release in motion. Bridget identifies Jed in a picture as the man who gave Shazzer the hidden cocaine. Mark states that he was "just the messenger" and after confirming Jed's identity and that Bridget "spent the night with Daniel Cleaver", declares that her sex life does not interest him. Bridget does not protest or correct his presumption. In Britain, Mark confronts Daniel for not helping Bridget when she was arrested, and they start a fight outside a museum. Eventually, Daniel swears off Bridget for good and sarcastically suggests to Mark "why don't you just marry her".  Bridget arrives at Heathrow Airport as an international human rights celebrity. She is greeted by her parents, who have been busy planning their [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|vow renewal ceremony]]. Her mother apologises for not making a bigger effort to participate in Bridget's jail release campaign, saying she's been busy. At home, Bridget is surprised by her friends, who inform her that Mark personally tracked down Jed the drug trafficker, arranged for his custody and extradition, and force Jed to admit Bridget's innocence. Hopeful that Mark still loves her, Bridget immediately runs to his house. She finds Rebecca there and assumes that there is a romantic relationship between Mark and her. Rebecca reveals that she is not seeking an affair with Mark; she is actually infatuated with Bridget and kisses her. Bridget is flattered but politely turns her down.  Bridget confronts Mark at his legal chambers and asks him to take her back. Mark proposes to Bridget and she accepts. The film ends with Bridget's parents renewing their vows and Bridget catching the bouquet outside while snow is falling.

The Butterfly Effect
   Growing up, Evan Treborn and his friends, Lenny and siblings Kayleigh and Tommy Miller, suffered many severe [[psychological trauma]]s that frequently caused Evan to [[Amnesia|black out]]. These traumas include being coerced to take part in [[child pornography]] by Kayleigh and Tommy's father, George Miller ([[Eric Stoltz]]); being nearly strangled to death by his institutionalized father, Jason Treborn ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), who is then killed in front of him by guards; accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with [[dynamite]] with his friends; and seeing his dog burned alive by Tommy.  Seven years later, while entertaining a girl in his dorm room, Evan discovers that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he can [[Time travel|travel back in time]] and redo parts of his past. His time traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced as a child, since those are the moments that his adult self occupied his consciousness, such as the moment his father strangled him when he realized that Evan shared his time-traveling affliction. However, there are consequences to his revised choices that dramatically alter his present life. For example, his personal time-line leads to alternative futures in which he finds himself, variously, as a college student in a [[fraternity]], an inmate imprisoned for murdering Tommy, and a double [[amputee]]. Eventually, he realizes that, even though his intentions to fix the past are good, his actions have unforeseen consequences, in which either he or at least one of his friends does not benefit. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternative timelines causes him brain damage and severe nosebleeds. He ultimately reaches the conclusion that he and his friends might not have good futures as long as he keeps altering the past, and he realizes that he is hurting them rather than helping.  Evan travels back one final time to the day he first met Kayleigh as a child. He intentionally upsets her so that she and Tommy will choose to live with their mother, in a different neighborhood, instead of with their father when they divorce. As a result, they are not subjected to a destructive upbringing, do not grow up with Evan, and go on to have happy, successful lives. Evan awakens in a college dorm room, where Lenny is his roommate. As a test, he asks where Kayleigh is, to which Lenny responds "Who's Kayleigh?". Knowing that everything is all right this time, Evan burns his journals and videos to avoid altering the timeline ever again.  Eight years later in [[New York City]], Evan exits an office building and passes by Kayleigh on the street. Though a brief look of recognition passes over both of their faces, they both decide to keep walking.   
C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America
  ===War and Rebellion=== In 1861, the southern, slave-owning states of the [[United States|United States of America]] secede from the Union to form the [[Confederate States of America]] (C.S.A.) after [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] is elected president in [[United States presidential election, 1860|the 1860 election]], due to fears over the abolition of the ownership of [[African Americans|Negro]] [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]. The C.S.A. engage with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in "[[The War of Northern Aggression]]"; following the Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]], President Lincoln issues a revolutionary proclamation entitled the "[[Emancipation Proclamation]]," but—within this [[alternate history]]—the proclamation fails.  [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] takes this opportunity to counteract the Proclamation and send politician [[Judah P. Benjamin]] to persuade the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]] to provide military and financial aid to the Confederacy in their fight against the Union. Benjamin also promotes the "Southern Cause of States' Rights", which proclaims Southerners have the right to private property (slaves not being mentioned specifically). Benjamin's gambit succeeds, and soon the Confederates—with the aid of British and French forces—are able to win the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], capture [[Washington, D.C.]] and take over the [[White House]] a few months later.  [[General (United States)|Union General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] surrenders to [[General officers in the Confederate States Army|Confederate General]] [[Robert E. Lee]] on April 9, 1864 (exactly a year before the date of [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Lee's actual surrender to Grant at Appomattox]]), effectively ending the Civil War.  The hunt for the now-deposed President Lincoln (on the run and disguised in [[blackface]]) and [[abolitionist]] [[Harriet Tubman]] is undertaken, and both are eventually captured, becoming the prime subject of [[D. W. Griffith]]'s fictional 1915 [[silent film]] ''The Hunt for Dishonest Abe''. Lincoln is quickly tried for war crimes against the Confederacy and is imprisoned in [[Fortress Monroe]], [[Virginia]], where he watches the execution of Tubman from his cell. In 1866, Lincoln—frail and gaunt from his two-year sentence—is fully pardoned by President Davis and exiled to [[Canada]], where he remains until he dies in June 1905 at the age of 96, almost entirely forgotten in history.  Shortly before his death, Lincoln laments in an interview his failure to make the abolition of slavery the primary aim of the Civil War, and blames himself for it. He also hopes that the colored people of the C.S.A. will one day gain independence, but regrets he will not live long enough to see it happen.  ===Reconstruction=== [[Reconstruction Era|After the war ends]], [[American Civil War alternate histories|the victory of the South]] becomes a cause of immense celebration, with many plantations welcoming back the troops to a now "blessed and triumphant" lifestyle. After Confederate soldiers move further east to raid [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], the Confederacy annexes the remainder of the United States with the stroke of a pen, renaming the nation the Confederate States of America (C.S.A.) and abolishing all of the old American symbols and replaces them with their own: the national flag is changed from the traditional [[Flag of the United States|U.S. Flag]] to the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate Naval Jack flag]]; the [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate dollar]] becomes the dominant currency of the C.S.A.; and the national anthem is changed to "[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]" (whose composer, [[Dan Emmett]], was a northerner).  After leaving [[Richmond, Virginia]] and moving into the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], President Davis faces difficulty in inducing the North to accept the institution of slavery, until John Ambrose Fauntroy I introduces a tax that is alleviated by the purchase of slaves. Meanwhile, [[Samuel A. Cartwright]], whose theories dominate Confederate medical science, "discovers" [[drapetomania|a fictional disease that causes slaves to run away]], and declares slaves livestock. Following the success of the new slave tax, 20,000 former U.S. citizens—most of them Northerners (e.g., [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]], among many others)—lead an exodus from the C.S.A. to Canada. Canada, along with [[Russian America|the Russian colony of Alaska]], is able to remain free from the C.S.A. and soon becomes a haven for refugee abolitionists, runaway slaves, and former citizens of the United States, thanks to the efforts of both Garrison and [[Frederick Douglass]] in convincing the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian Parliament]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[John A. Macdonald]] to not repatriate escaped slaves. Opponents of slavery form an organization known as the "[[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Chattel People]]" (N.A.A.C.P.). This "Red Canadian Injustice" fosters a deep enmity for Canada within the C.S.A., and relations between the two nations deteriorate but remain in a state of tense peace.  Reconstruction efforts for the C.S.A. prove to be a challenge, as a 30-year war with the [[Plains Indians]] slows efforts by [[American pioneer|pioneers]] and [[prospecting|gold prospectors]] to migrate west, and hinders construction of a [[First Transcontinental Railroad|transcontinental railroad]] into the [[Great Plains]]. In the 1890s, a decision is taken to enslave the [[Chinese American|Chinese]] migrant workers on the West Coast. In 1895, the government of the C.S.A. (which has not [[separation of church and state|separated the Church from the state]] due to fear of foreign slaves using their native religious traditions to influence the C.S.A.) outlaws all non-[[Christian]] religions; after much debate, [[Roman Catholicism]] is accepted as a Christian religion. Originally, [[Judaism]], too, is outlawed, but a dying Jefferson Davis, citing the crucial contribution of the Jewish [[Judah P. Benjamin]], persuades Congress to allow some Jews to remain on a reservation (similar to a [[South African Homeland]]) on [[Long Island]].  ===A "Splendid Little War"=== By the beginning of the 20th century, the Confederate States of America has finished Reconstruction and embarked on an expansionist campaign to claim the [[Western Hemisphere]] as part of their "[[Golden Circle (proposed country)|Golden Circle]]". They begin with [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and the rest of the [[Caribbean]] islands during the fictionalized version of the [[Spanish–American War]], then move on to completely annex [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]; only Canada and [[Russian America|Russian Alaska]] manage to remain free of the Confederate yoke. The Confederates impose "Juan Crow"" laws in their conquered territories to divide [[Hispanic|Hispanics]]  from Confederate settlers and Chinesse and African property; and while they believe in an ordained and divine quest reminiscent of [[Manifest destiny]] for world domination, conquest of South America proves highly difficult due to the intensity of the will of the South Americans to stay independent from the invading Confederates.  ===The Great Depression and World War II=== In 1929, with Mexico, Central, and South America, Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and the Caribbean all incorporated into its "growing empire", the C.S.A. is hit by an [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|economic crash]], which forces it to retreat into [[isolationism]]; however, the C.S.A. extricates itself by reviving the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]], with new African slaves provided by collaborationist African leaders who enslave members of other tribes and sell at the Confederate state of [[Liberia]].  During [[World War II|the Second World War]], the C.S.A. becomes friendly with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Nazism|their ideologies]], calling them "[[politically correct|biologically correct]]", though they disagrees with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s "[[Final Solution]]" for a pure [[Aryan]] continent, hoping to exploit non-white races as a slave labor force rather than exterminate them. The C.S.A. agrees to remain [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] in any German war, but it becomes hostile with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], seeing its expansionism as a threat to the entire [[Pacific coast|Pacific Coast Region]]. On the morning of December 7, 1941 (the date of the actual Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]), the C.S.A. strikes two Japanese naval bases and bombs the city of [[Kyoto]] as the opening blow in a war against the "[[Yellow Peril]]". Confederate leaders assume that the C.S.A. will easily win the war, judging the [[Japanese people|Japanese]] as small and weak in physical stature, but like their enemies in South America the Japanese prove to an intense foe to defeat.  During the war, the C.S.A. military suffers massive losses and tries to solve its manpower shortages by recruiting a black [[regiment]],  promising the slaves freedom after the war.  This regiment receives the most dangerous missions and suffers high casualties, and despite earning the respect of white officers, when the war concludes the black soldiers are enslaved once more, their promises of freedom being broken without explanation. The Japanese are defeated by [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of the atomic bomb]]; the European war still ends in the Nazis' defeat, albeit with many more Soviet casualties. [[Joseph Stalin]] expands control over all [[Continental Europe]] and supports the holding of their colonies with exception of the British Empire (thanks to Canadian military assistance).  ===Cold war with Canada=== During the 1950s, the C.S.A. suffers the effects of "[[Abolitionism]]" (analogous to [[Red Scare]]) and violent attacks from a splinter group of the N.A.A.C.P. called the "[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] Underground" (J.B.U.). To safeguard and counter the fears of Abolitionism and the Red Canadian Injustice, the C.S.A. erects a border barrier wall along the entire Canada–U.S. border called the "Cotton Curtain" (in reference to the real-life [[Iron Curtain]]) to divide the C.S.A. from Canada. After the C.S.A.'s neutrality in the war and friendly relations with Nazi Germany, the countries of mainland Europe and their overseas colonies (now under Soviet control) impose international trade sanctions and embargoes on the C.S.A., forcing the nation into isolation once again and leaving [[South Africa]] as the only [[British Empire]] [[colony]] to trade with the C.S.A.  ===A New Frontier=== In [[United States presidential election, 1960|the 1960 election]], when only 29 percent of voters approve of slavery, Roman Catholic Republican [[John F. Kennedy]] is elected president over [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Richard Nixon]]. However, foreign policy issues such as the [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Newfoundland Missile Crisis]]<ref></ref> distract him, and he is unable to implement his domestic agenda.  Also throughout the 1960s, the [[Vietnam War]] is briefly mentioned as another "expansionist campaign" of the C.S.A., while [[Feminist movement|women organize in groups to demand greater control over their lives]]. Canada increasingly becomes the [[popular culture|pop culture]] capital of the world thanks to the contributions of American emigrants (such as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[James Baldwin]], and [[Elvis Presley]]), whereas the C.S.A.'s culture never evolves beyond its [[propaganda]]. Canada continuously defeats the C.S.A. in the [[Olympic Games]], forcing the Confederate Congress to include slaves in sports. This illustrates the increasing consensus that it is time to break the [[color barrier]] and support Kennedy's movement to emancipate; however, before this movement can be set into motion, [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy is assassinated]]. Kennedy's assassination completely dismantles the hopes of emancipation of slaves and enfranchisement for women; slaves throughout the country rebel in fury and retaliation as a direct result of the assassination. By the 1970s, the [[Social Revolution]] has been crushed and many fear that the "[[Golden Age]]" of the Confederate States of America has ended.  ===Modern day=== By the start of the 1980s and the 1990s, the Confederacy has largely put away the social anxiety self-doubt of the preceding decades. Democratic Senator John Ambrose Fauntroy V, a candidate in the Confederate Presidential election of 2002, campaigns on programs returning the Confederacy to its [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[Protestant]] [[Bible|Biblical]] values, encouraging husbands to [[domestic violence|beat their wives]] and negating tolerance of [[homosexuality|homosexuals]]. The documentarians ask Senator Fauntroy (a member of a prominent [[political dynasty]] going back to the founding of the Confederacy) to arrange an interview with some slaves, but it becomes clear that the slaves have been coached. However, during the interview, the film crew is clandestinely passed a note instructing them to meet a black man named Big Sam (earlier identified as the fugitive leader of the J.B.U.—John Brown Underground). Big Sam, in turn, leads them to Horace, a lifelong slave of Fauntroy's, who alleges that Fauntroy V is [[Multiracial|part black]], a result of an affair between John Ambrose Fauntroy I and one of his slaves. The allegations, while left unconfirmed, cost Fauntroy the election, and he commits suicide a month later. Narration then states that [[DNA]] tests turned up "negative" for the late politician, although whether this confirms or denies the allegations is deliberately left unclear.  ===Expanded timeline=== The film's official website contains an expanded timeline of the history of the C.S.A., which features events not covered in the documentary. The timeline identifies President [[William McKinley]]'s [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassin]] as an abolitionist rather than [[Leon Czolgosz]], an [[anarchist]]. The C.S.A. manages to advance in space technology by [[Operation Paperclip|smuggling Nazi scientists]] out of [[Germany]] before its annexation by the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>.</ref> [[Rosa Parks]] is identified as a Canadian terrorist and a member of the J.B.U. The [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|failed assassination attempt]] on [[Pope John Paul II]] occurs in [[New York City]] instead of [[St. Peter's Square]], with the assailant being a [[Southern Baptist]] who is subsequently executed for the crime.<ref>.</ref> The [[Gulf War]] has [[Kuwait]] as C.S.A. territory. In 1995, [[Timothy McVeigh|Tim McVeigh]] blows up the [[Jefferson Memorial]] instead of [[Oklahoma City bombing|the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City]]; his execution is broadcast on [[pay-per-view]].<ref>.</ref> The [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] and subsequent American interventions in the [[Middle East]] are known as the "1st and 2nd [[Crusades]]", with the goal of eradicating the "[[Muslim]] Menace" by overthrowing the Islamic governments, taking over their [[oil production]], and converting their entire populace to Christianity.<ref>.</ref>

Cachorro
 As a favor to his [[hippie]] [[sister]] who has gone off to [[India]], Pedro, a [[gay]] [[dentist]], has agreed to look after his nine-year-old [[nephew]], Bernardo. Bernardo’s [[father]] is dead and the boy and his [[uncle]] have not had much to do with each other until now. Originally, the boy was to stay with Pedro for a few days, but six weeks have passed with no word from the boy's mother.  His nephew’s presence forces Pedro to take a break from his otherwise extremely active sex life. In fact, Pedro was beginning to tire of the superficial nature of his many relationships. Even his boyfriend, Manuel, who suddenly pays Pedro a visit and who shares his penchant for leather and latex, is not really the man with whom he wants to spend the rest of his life, although they express love for each other. Then, all at once, an entirely different set of problems crops up. For one, there is Doña Teresa, Bernardo’s paternal [[grandmother]], who one day darkens Pedro’s door and puts the emotional screws on him. Worse still, however, is the news that Bernardo’s mother has been arrested in India for [[drug smuggling]]. She may be facing a prison sentence of thirty years, so the embassy informs Pedro. Pedro is just as shocked at this news as Bernardo; nevertheless, he realizes that he is now responsible for the boy. Without further ado, he decides to rise to the challenge this represents. There suddenly seem to be so many things to organize – such as repairs to the house and finding a school for the boy – that Pedro hardly misses the life he used to lead. Gradually, however, he succeeds in rekindling his sex life – albeit in a less excessive form.  Then Doña Teresa puts in another appearance, this time demanding custody of Bernardo. But Pedro is ready to fight for the boy's welfare. After illegally obtaining his medical history (revealing that Pedro is [[HIV positive]]) and hiring a [[private investigator]] who obtains pictures of Pedro on a night out in a gay club, and threatening him with both, he ends up letting her put Bernardo in a [[boarding school]]. When his grandmother goes to visit him later on, revealing Pedro's HIV status (despite their previous agreement), Bernardo reveals that he already knew from his mother, and that his mother was HIV positive as well. She then reveals that he is in the hospital with [[pneumonia]]. He then tells her that he hates her and that it's her fault that he's currently in the hospital, because he wasn't there to care for him.  Three years pass, during which several letters go back and forth between Bernardo, Pedro, his mother and his grandmother. We then see Bernardo and two of his friends, a boy and girl, at a funeral, and a casket being lowered, although it is not immediately revealed whose funeral this is. Shortly after, a cab pulls up with Pedro inside, out of the hospital and healthy, and he expresses lament at the passing of Bernardo's grandmother. After a brief conversation, Bernardo returns to his two friends, kisses both, and parts from them, leaving the viewer to wonder whether or not he's romantically involved with one of them. Bernardo then returns to his uncle and they ride away together in the cab.

Care Bears: Journey to Joke-a-lot
 The Care Bears live in a cloud-filled land known as Care-a-lot ("With All Your Heart").  One of the Bears, Grumpy, is working on a rainbow [[carousel]] for the upcoming Care Bear Fair.  His fellow Care Bears come by for a look; one of them, Funshine, loves telling jokes and making the other Care Bears laugh.  After they reluctantly agree to try the carousel, it goes out of control and sends them into the sky before crashing down.  Grumpy feels even worse after Funshine tries to cheer him up with a joke on height restrictions, which the other Bears find funny.  Grumpy is not amused and even goes so far as to tell Funshine that if he doesn't understand that cheering up isn't making fun of, then maybe Funshine doesn't belong in Care-A-Lot.  As a result, the Bears take Grumpy to help him and Funshine make up.  Reading from a note, Tenderheart Bear realizes that Funshine has felt sorry for Grumpy and has gone in search of a place where his talents can be better appreciated.  The other Bears are worried about his fate; as they cannot hold their Fair without him, they decide to look for him regardless and bring him back to Care-a-lot.  Five of them&mdash; Tenderheart, Grumpy, Wish, Cheer and Share volunteer, while Laugh-a-Lot, Love-a-Lot, Friend, Good Luck, Bedtime, and Champ stay home to get ready for the fair.  The day after he runs away ("Make Em Laugh"), Funshine hears circus music in the distance and strays from his camping spot to find out.  Taking a seat on a [[bumper car]], he embarks on a long ride which leads him to Joke-a-lot, a town where humour is dominant ("In the Land of Joke-a-Lot").  The area's residents are astonished when he lands via parachute upon the town square; a female piglet called Gig tells him where he now is.  Then a rat named Sir Funnybone arrives at the scene and dubs Funshine the area's long-lost King (although Funshine insists otherwise).  Funnybone actually placed the car within the woods so that he could begin to gain his own power; he tells that to his henchmen, a trio of houseflies named Phido, Cleon, and Bidel.  Eventually, Funshine learns the hard way that "serious" is a very bad word in Joke-a-lot.  The Joke-a-lot residents celebrate a "Laff-Fest" in his honour; Funnybone gives him a tour of the town and takes him to his Royal Palace, where Funshine learns of the last two Kings and is introduced to the Royal Sceptre.  Stored in a vault within the voice-activated Royal Treasury, the sceptre holds the Royal Jewels of Joke-a-lot, which Funnybone says are "the source of the magic power behind all the fun" there; only the king is granted access.  Funshine wants to look, but Funnybone tells him that a coronation is about to take place.  He plans to take command of the sceptre, now in the hands of a slow, elderly alligator called Grand Duke Giggle.  At the coronation, Joke-a-lot's new "king" tells his audience two jokes to pass the time, before Grand Duke Giggle proceeds to give him the sceptre.  Meanwhile, the other Care Bears find his belongings and take the same ride that he did.  After they crash into the Royal Palace, Funshine is delighted to see them, but the Bears are a bit puzzled over what he has become.  They miss Funshine and want him to return to Care-a-lot where he belongs; thus, he must make a very difficult decision&mdash;to head back home with them, or remain King of Joke-a-lot ("Here I'm a King").  He then announces that he will go home, but Sir Funnybone wants him to stay as king.  During the "Laff-Fest", Giggle gives the sceptre to the new king.  Funnybone orders Phido, Cleon, and Bidel to steal it when Funshine is not looking.  He gets into the Treasury with it, unlocks the Royal Jewels, and escapes with this loot on a pink [[airship|dirigible]].  As Grumpy is fixing his carousel, the other Bears must use it to stop Funnybone.  The machine spins onto the dirigible, bursting the balloon and sending it aground.  When the Care Bears come to the rat, he reveals his real name and homeland&mdash;[[Basil Rathbone|Basil Ratbone]], from the No Fun Atoll, whose inhabitants have lived through a "serious" ''[[modus operandi]]''.  He wanted the jewels so much to enliven his fellow residents that he planned on stealing them from Joke-a-lot, and even pretended that Funshine's "tummy symbol" was the royal birthmark.  Instead, the real one&mdash;a "smiley mouth"&mdash;was at the back of Gig's ears.  The other Bears open the chest to find a jack-in-the-box, and other toys, which Funshine assures them are the real magic jewels. Funnybone apologizes for his misdeeds, and soon all of Joke-a-lot attends a coronation in which Gig becomes their Princess (though she is really more like a Queen). The Bears promise to return to Joke-a-lot some other day and ride home on the flying horses from their carousel.  
Calvaire (film)
  Marc Stevens is a struggling low-level performer, who makes his living performing light pop ballads and easy listening tunes at retirement homes and other small venues around Belgium. En route to perform at a [[Christmas special]], his van — which doubles as his home — breaks down during a storm and he is stranded deep in the woods. Lost, cold, and succumbing to the elements, Marc is rescued by a local, an emaciated young man named Boris, who takes Marc to a run down inn.  The sole occupant of the inn is its proprietor, Mr. Bartel, an amiable old man who lives there as a [[hermit]] of sorts. Claiming to be a retired [[standup comedian]], Bartel welcomes Marc to stay and offers to repair his van as a token of brotherhood between professional entertainers. Marc accepts the offer, but remains aloof, not speaking with Bartel about his own career or personal life.  The next morning, Mr. Bartel tows Marc's van into the front yard of the inn. Marc tells Bartel he is going for a walk, at which point Bartel suddenly becomes paranoid and aggressive, warning Marc not to go into the nearby village. Marc agrees, but during his walk he approaches a nearby farm, where he witnesses a family [[voyeurism|voyeuristically]] watching a teenage boy have intercourse with a pig, calling the experience "so tender". Meanwhile, rather than repairing Marc's van, Bartel snoops through Marc's living quarters and takes his mobile phone and some amateur pornographic photographs presented to Marc by a fan ([[Brigitte Lahaie]]).  That night, Bartel becomes even more aggressive, working himself into a frenzy while recalling his adulterous wife Gloria who abandoned him years before. He insists that Marc sing him a song before going to bed. The next day, Marc finds the homemade porn in the inn and realizes Bartel has been going through his things; when he attempts to call for help, he discovers that the telephone Bartel has been regularly using isn't even wired into the wall. Confronting Bartel, Marc discovers him vandalizing the van and pouring petrol over it; Bartel knocks Marc unconscious and blows the van up.  Marc wakes to find himself tied to a chair, clad only in an old [[sundress]]. Mr. Bartel, now babbling, addresses Marc as if he were his wife, asking why "she" has come back after leaving him. Mr. Bartel sets about shaving one half of Marc's scalp, to "protect" him from the villagers, before forcing him into bed and cuddling next to him.  The next day, Bartel ties Marc to a tractor and takes him out into the woods to chop down a [[Christmas]] tree. Marc escapes, but ends up getting caught in a [[snare trap|rabbit snare]]. He lies there prone while darkness falls, until Boris wanders by. Marc begs him for help, but Boris ignores his pleas, addressing Marc as if he were his lost dog. He sits beside Marc and pets and strokes him until the desperate Marc bites his leg, at which he goes away. The next morning, Bartel, alerted by Boris, retrieves Marc, driving him back to the inn covered by a blanket on the back of a hay truck. A pair of villagers see Boris driving the truck with something concealed under a blanket, but they take no action.  Back at the inn, Bartel chastises "Gloria" for running away, then [[crucifixion|crucifies]] Marc behind the inn before going into the village to have a drink at the local pub. Seemingly convinced that his wife was a "[[slut]]" who was sleeping with every man in town, Bartel warns the men drinking in the bar that now "she" has "returned", none of them can "have her". The men all appear frightened at Bartel's ramblings, but once he leaves, one of the patrons sits at the antique piano and begins to play nightmarishly discordant [[polka]] music. Gradually the men all get up and begin dancing with one another.<ref></ref>  Back at the inn, Bartel brings Marc into the kitchen and they sit down for Christmas dinner. Boris arrives with a calf, convinced that it is his missing dog. Bartel gives a tearful, impassioned speech about love, togetherness, and the spirit of the holidays, before a sudden rifle shot rings out and a bullet explodes through the inn's window, killing Boris. The villagers lay siege to the inn, rushing the inn with a pig on a leash as one would employ a dog, intent on reclaiming the calf, and it quickly becomes apparent that they are also intent on raping Marc, in the shared delusion that Marc is Bartel's returned wife. The villagers mortally wound Bartel before turning their attention to Marc; one of them then briefly rapes Marc on the dining room table.<ref></ref>  Shots are fired among the men and in the confusion Marc manages to escape from the mob and into the forest. He spends the night running from them through the woods, coming across a cemetery with an imposing crucified Christ gravestone, aligning with the [[Calvary (sculpture)|Calvaire]] of the title. Marc manages to elude all but one of the men, who is about to capture "Gloria" when he falls into a bog and starts being swallowed up by the mire. Crying and broken, Marc approaches the drowning man. Instead of using the man's gun against him - or making any attempt to save him - Marc watches as he sinks below the surface. Finally, just before the man's head sinks into the marsh, Marc, as Gloria, responds to his impassioned question by telling him that "she" does, in fact, love him. Within seconds, the villager is dead, and Marc is alone in the wilderness.<ref></ref>

Brisbane's guest, Francois Nuffaut, apologizes to Molly and redirects the blame onto Brisbane, for throwing a party at the bank before the security system was operable. Maddy and her friends go to the hospital with the money to pay the surgery, but Molly realizes who the thieves are (through the amount they stole being equal to that of surgery costs and the climbing gear Maddy left in the vault) and intercepts them.

Casshern (film)
 A fifty-year war between the Eastern Federation and Europa ends, with the Federation taking control of the Eurasian continent. A [[resistance movement]] rises in Zone 7 and the Federation mobilizes its military. However, the war and heavy industry have exhausted the Federation and polluted the [[Natural environment|environment]].  Dr. Azuma presents his discovery of [[Stem Cell|Neo Cells]], human cells that, in theory, can be converted to regenerate human tissue.  The Neo Cells are only found in the [[genome]] of "a primitive ethnic group." He states that he can develop the Neo Cells for human use, but is quickly denounced. But Kaoru Naito, from Nikko Hairal Inc., offers Dr. Azuma sponsorship. Azuma is persuaded when Naito insinuates that accepting will also help Dr. Azuma cure his wife, Midori.  A photo shoot at the Azuma Residence follows, commemorating Tetsuya's (Azuma's son) engagement to Luna. They argue about Tetsuya joining the military. One year later, Tetsuya is deployed to Eurasia Zone 7. He kills civilians, and is killed by a [[booby trap]].  Azuma invites Luna's father, Dr. Kozuki, to his lab. They are rivals, since Azuma's cell research makes Kozuki's armor research redundant. However, although organs have been grown from the Neo Cells, they are not usable. Meanwhile, Midori, now almost blind, is visited by Tetsuya's [[ghost]]. Shortly after she is told of his death. His body is sent to Azuma's lab.  Tetsuya's ghost sees the body. A lightning bolt strikes the facility and stimulates the Neo Cells, causing the limbs and organs to restructure  into humans. Naito calls for the military to kill them. But a few escape and encounter Midori in her car, which they hijack.  Azuma carries Tetsuya's body into his lab. Tetsuya is [[Resurrection|resurrected]], but his condition is unstable, and he is brought to Kozuki's residence.  Kozuki puts him in prototype battle armor.  The Neo humans travel to Zone 7, sheltering in a derelict castle, where they discover a robot army. Calling themselves "Neo-Sapiens," they vow revenge and reactivate the robots to wage war upon humanity.  Kozuki's residence is attacked and Tetsuya is awakened. He kills a female Neo-Sapien, Saguree, but cannot save Kozuki. He escapes with Luna but is confronted by a robot battalion. After eliminating them, Tetsuya battles the leader, Burai, only to lose consciousness. When he comes to, he and Luna go to Zone Seven, but the route is [[contaminated]], and Luna falls ill.  Tetsuya is found in the forest by a doctor and led to a nearby village in Zone Seven, where the doctor treats Luna. It is revealed the people of Zone Seven aren't terrorists at all, but have been slaughtered for decades because of the government's discriminatory policies. The doctor, in conversation, informs Tetsuya of a local legend of a protective deity named "Casshern"-a deity whose statue makes numerous appearances in the movie. Tetsuya fights Barashin as the village comes under attack by the military and Neo-sapiens, and it is here that he first refers to himself as Casshern. While both suffer injuries in the fight, Casshern is the victor and Barashin is killed. Fighting Barashin has caused Tetsuya to lose Luna, who escaped with a Neo-sapien and eventually found her way to a train full of captured villagers from Zone Seven. Here, Luna and the Neo-sapien are confronted by a bereaved scientist who blames the Neo-Sapiens for the loss of his daughter. Luna is rescued by Dr. Azuma, but the Neo-Sapien is injured.  A [[coup d'état]] takes place and General Kamijo's son takes over, while in the laboratory Naito reveals that Neo Cells are not what they seem. The Neo Cells were acquired from the slaughtered "original humans" of Zone Seven for the purposes of prolonging General Kamijo and his cohorts' lives, and the Neo Cell culture did not in fact create the Neo-Sapiens. It simply rejoined the body parts that were harvested from the victims of Zone Seven after being struck by the stone lightning bolt. Even though Dr. Azuma had been spearheading the macabre experiments, he is unable to explain what has happened. As they talk, the stone lightning bolt crumbles and Casshern appears to fall from the sky into the laboratory, which is now in ruins.  Burai arrives with an airship and abducts Luna, Casshern and the dying Neo-Sapien, leaving a now fatally wounded Naito, Dr. Azuma and General Kamijo's son alone. Burai gives his reasons for hating humanity, and Casshern finds his mother, but she's apparently dead. Burai launches a giant machine that appears to be set to self-destruct, which slaughters countless soldiers. Casshern uses all his strength to stop the machine, although it still detonates, albeit away from any urban or heavily populated area.  In the finale, the General's son kills Burai with a grenade after revealing he was human all along, and it is learned that Tetsuya, during his military service, slaughtered Burai's family. Casshern stops his father from resurrecting his mother, so Dr. Azuma retaliates by shooting Luna in the head. Luna is revived by the blood of Burai, only after Casshern kills his father.  The souls of the dead come onto Casshern as he and Luna embrace each other.  Luna rips out Tetsuya's containment suit and a pillar of light fires through space and crashing down onto another planet. The film ends with a montage of the characters in happier times.  
Catwoman (film)
 Artist and graphics designer Patience Phillips is a meek people-pleaser whose main support is her best friend Sally. She works for a [[cosmetics]] company called Hedare Beauty, which is ready to ship a new skin cream, called Beau-line, that is able to reverse the effects of aging. However, when Patience visits the [[Research and development|R&D]] laboratory facility to deliver a re-done ad design, she overhears a discussion between the scientist, Dr. Ivan Slavicky, and Laurel Hedare, the wife of company-owner George Hedare, about the dangerous [[side effect]]s from continued use of the product. Laurel's guards discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. Washed up on shore afterwards, Patience is mysteriously brought back to life by an [[Egyptian Mau]] cat, which had appeared at her apartment earlier; from that moment on, she develops cat-like abilities.  From Mau's owner, eccentric researcher Ophelia Powers, Patience learns that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess [[Bastet|Bast]]. Patience realizes that she is now a "catwoman," [[Dying-and-rising god|reborn]] with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. Disguised as [[Catwoman]] to hide her identity, Patience, under cover of darkness, searches for answers as to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search (which includes finding Slavicky's body, and later being accused of his murder) leads her to Laurel. She asks Laurel to keep an eye on George, to which Laurel agrees. However, when Patience confronts George (who is attending an opera with another woman) as Catwoman, he reveals he knows nothing about the side effects. The police, led by Patience's love interest Detective Tom Lone, arrive and Catwoman escapes. Later on, Laurel murders her husband for his infidelity, and admits to having Dr. Slavicky killed because he wanted to cancel the product's release. She contacts Catwoman and [[Frameup|frames]] her for the murder. Catwoman is taken into custody by Tom, but not before Laurel reveals the side-effects of the product: discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin as hard as marble. She also plans to release Beau-line to the public the following day.  Patience slips out of her jail cell, and confronts Laurel in her office, rescuing Tom, who'd come to question Laurel after second thoughts about Patience's guilt, in the process, and revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for her death. During the fight, she scratches Laurel's face multiple times, causing Laurel to fall out of a window and grab onto a pipe for her life. Laurel sees her face in a window's reflection and, horrified by her skin's rapid disintegration (as a result of the scratches and her own use of Beau-line for years), fails to grab hold of Patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death. Though Patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of Dr. Slavicky and the Hedares, she decides to end things with Tom, choosing to continue living outside the law and enjoying her new-found freedom as the mysterious Catwoman.  
Cellular (film)
 Jessica Martin ([[Kim Basinger]]), a high school biology teacher, takes her son Ricky to his bus stop for school. After she returns home, several men break into her house, kill her [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], and confine Jessica in the attic of their [[safe house]]. Ethan Greer ([[Jason Statham]]), the group leader, smashes the attic's telephone. Jessica uses the wires of the broken phone and contacts the random number of Ryan ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), a carefree young man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Chloe ([[Jessica Biel]]).  Jessica persuades Ryan to go to the police station, where he briefly reports to Mooney ([[William H. Macy]]) but has to leave to avoid losing connection. When Jessica denies knowledge of information Ethan wants, he leaves to get Ricky. Overhearing them, Ryan gets to Ricky's school, only to see the boy kidnapped. He hijacks a security officer's car and gives chase. When his phone battery runs out, he takes the gun in the car, cuts in line at a shop and buys a charger.  Deciding to check on Ryan's kidnapping claim, Mooney visits Jessica's house. He meets Dana Bayback ([[Valerie Cruz]]), the kidnappers' accomplice, posing as Jessica. Believing the claim is a false alarm, Mooney leaves. With Ricky in tow, Ethan returns and asks Jessica about a place her husband Craig mentioned, "The Left Field", and Jessica confesses that it is a bar at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]].  A cross-connection between phone lines causes Ryan to rob a nearby lawyer's cellphone and car to maintain connection. At the airport, Ryan plants the gun on one of the kidnappers, tripping the alarm. When security intervenes, the kidnappers are revealed to be police officers and they proceed to apprehend Craig.  After viewing a news report of Ryan holding up a store for a charger, Mooney calls Jessica's home. He notices the voice on the answering machine is different from that of the woman he met.  The kidnappers escort Craig to his bank [[safe deposit box]] to retrieve a bag. Ryan intervenes and flees with the bag, but loses the lawyer's cellphone. When Ryan opens Craig's bag, he finds Craig's video camera, on which Craig unintentionally filmed [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detectives Ethan, Mad Dog, Dimitri, Bayback, Deason, and Jack Tanner (a friend of Mooney's) robbing and murdering two drug dealers, marking them as dirty cops.  Ryan steals the lawyer's car from the impound lot and retrieves his own cellphone. Mooney returns to the Martin residence, where he kills Bayback in self-defense when she attacks him. Back at the safe house, Mad Dog learns that Jessica has been trying to contact help and attacks her. Jessica—being a biology teacher—purposely cuts his [[brachial artery]], and he bleeds to death in seconds. Before Jessica and Ricky can escape, Ethan's gang returns with Craig and are about to execute the family when Ryan contacts Ethan and makes a deal: the videotape in exchange for the Martin family at the [[Santa Monica Pier]].  At the pier, Ryan disguises himself but is inadvertently exposed by Chloe. Tanner sends Mooney away for medical attention, arrests Ryan and brings him to Ethan. Ethan destroys the videotape, and Tanner radios the order to execute the Martins; however, Mooney overhears the transmission. Ryan escapes, following a distraction by his friend Chad. Mooney overpowers Dimitri and handcuffs him, then returns to the pier. Tanner and Ethan confront Ryan in a boathouse. Ryan knocks out Tanner. Ethan tries to kill Ryan, but Mooney shows up. After a brief chase, Ryan notices Ethan has circled behind Mooney and calls Ethan's cell phone. The phone's ring betrays Ethan's position, and Mooney shoots him.   Jessica strangles Deason with her handcuff chain in the van, then frees her husband and son. However, Deason was merely stunned and aims his gun at them. Ryan intervenes and kills Deason. While Ryan and Mooney are being treated by medics, Tanner is also exposed, because Ryan had copied the video recording onto his cellphone. Jessica finally meets Ryan, the man who risked his life to save her family.  When she tells him she doesn't know how to thank him, Ryan humorously tells her to never call him again.  
Cashback (film)
 Aspiring artist Ben Willis develops [[insomnia]] after a painful breakup with his girlfriend, Suzy. To take his mind off Suzy and to occupy the extra waking hours he has recently gained, Ben begins working at a local [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, where he meets colourful co-workers. Among them is his colleague Sharon, with whom he soon develops a mutual crush. As his personal means to escape the boredom inherent in the night shift, Ben lets his imagination run wild. In particular, he imagines that he can stop time so that he can walk around in a world that is "frozen" like the pause of a film. He imagines female patrons of the supermarket stopped in time, allowing him to undress and draw them.  Finally the ability to stop time becomes real.  A series of flashbacks occur with each progression of the plot, accompanied by Ben's narration and an examination of the effect the situation had had upon him. He explains how he always has been impressed by the beauty of the female body: how he, as a young boy, witnessed a Swedish boarder walk naked from the shower to her room. In another flashback, the young Ben and his best friend Sean share Sean's discovery of his parents' adult magazines, and Sean pays a neighbourhood girl [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|fifty pence]] to show him, and all the neighbourhood boys, her [[vulva]].  Ben's boss, Alan Jenkins, recruits the staff for a weekend football game and, after an embarrassing defeat, 26-Nil, Ben freezes time again. This time he discovers that he is not alone when he sees a mysterious stranger who is able to move inside the frozen world as he can. When Jenkins throws a party to honour his own birthday and as a consolation for their defeat, Sharon asks Ben to be her date, to which he eagerly but nervously agrees. While there, Ben encounters his ex-girlfriend Suzy, who implores him to try their relationship again. Ben refuses her advance but she kisses him, just as Sharon witnesses from afar. Sharon angrily leaves the party. Ben realizes Sharon has seen the kiss, and freezes time. After spending several days "frozen", Ben concludes that although he can stop time, he cannot reverse it to correct the mistake. He eventually seeks to explain himself to Sharon at her apartment, and a confrontation similar to the film-opening breakup occurs. Sharon henceforth does not show up to work at the supermarket.  As a [[practical joke]], colleagues Barry and Matt phone Ben; Matt poses as an art gallery owner who is interested in displaying Ben's drawings, and schedules an appointment for Ben to present more to him. When Ben arrives as agreed, the reaction of the owner quickly reveals that he has been pranked. However, the gallery owner is nonetheless interested in Ben's work and decides to exhibit Ben's drawings. Sharon receives an invitation to the exhibition and visits. She is moved as most of the pieces depict her and she happily greets Ben, congratulating him on his success. The finale occurs as Ben shares his ability to stop time with her and the two step outside into a time-frozen snowfall.

Chameli (film)
 Aman Kapoor ([[Rahul Bose]]) is a wealthy investment banker, whose pregnant wife, Neha ([[Rinke Khanna]]) was killed in a car accident more than a decade ago. The incident has left him depressed and lonely. Forced to engage in social events, he reluctantly hosts a party. The stormy weather puts Aman in a pensive mood, and he decides to go home. While driving, his car breaks down on a flooded road and his cell phone battery dies. He takes refuge in an alleyway where he meets Chameli ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), a street-smart prostitute.  Chameli offers Aman a match for his cigarette, and he is initially repulsed by her after she propositions him. Aman's presence scares off a potential customer, and he offers to pay for her missed wages, which Chameli declines. Soon, two police officers arrive, looking for their bribe. They begin to manhandle Chameli, which aggravates Aman, who is then intimidated by the officers. Chameli diffuses the situation, and Aman's attitude towards her softens after the pair begin a conversation about their lives. The discussion is interrupted by Johnny, a young boy selling coffee and cigarettes. Chameli is familiar with him, paying his school fees and looking after his health. He promises to come back with a mechanic to fix Aman's car. Chameli then attends to Raja, an unstable young man who has stolen Rs 50,000 from his father. Raja is in love with Haseena, and is convinced that she has run off to become a prostitute. Chameli consoles and advises him, and then takes him away. Haseena, a hijra/trans-woman, arrives and playfully propositions Aman. Chameli returns and advises Haseena to run away with Raja to another city with the money. Raja's homophobic father turns up to look for them, but he leaves soon when he realises they are not there. Each incident further develops the friendship between Chameli and Aman.  Chameli's pimp, Usman, has rented her out to Naik, a brutish local politician who has a reputation for injuring prostitutes. Naik's henchmen seek Chameli out, and the pair manage to escape and go to a local bar, to talk to Usman. Chameli reveals that she cannot free herself from her pimp because she still owes him money which she borrowed. At the bar, Aman offers to pay off Chameli's debt in exchange for her not having to entertain Naik. At the ATM Usman demands more money, threatening Aman with a knife, and the pimp is stabbed in the ensuing scuffle. Aman and Chameli are picked up by the police, and his temperament causes him to be placed in a holding cell. Chameli convinces the officers to allow Aman to make a call, and he speaks to a friend who has connections with the Assistant Commissioner of Police K.P. Singh. Singh listens to Aman's story and decides to withdraw the police protection over Usman, who previously became an informant after being arrested. Chameli tells Aman that the withdrawal of protection means that Usman and his family are now vulnerable to being killed by other, more dangerous criminals. Singh reluctantly agrees to continue protecting Usman. At the hospital, Singh forces Usman to call Naik, and the ACP threatens him, eventually convincing Naik to leave Chameli alone.  As they leave the hospital, Chameli playfully teases Aman about how his wife will react to the situation. Aman breaks down and tells her about the accident, adding that it is his fault that Neha died since he chose to drive in heavy rains. As dawn breaks on the next day, Aman finally returns home, a changed man. The highly eventful night has altered his outlook on life and allowed him to come to terms with his loss. He reconnects with his father-in-law, whom he had avoided since his wife's death. After some time, he returns to see Chameli, and they meet again.

Upset at Ben's rejection, Anna hitchhikes a ride in a truck, leaving Ben to chase her through the Austrian countryside. Anna comes to a bridge, where she meets the Jumping Germans, a [[bungee jumping]] group. Ben arrives just as Anna is being strapped into the harness, and insists on jumping with her.  Later that evening at the Jumping Germans' camp, one of the Germans asks Anna to share his tent for the night. She refuses and flirts with Ben, who rejects her advances again. Upset, she declares that she will share the German's tent after all; Ben finally admits his feelings for Anna and they spend the night together. At the Love Parade, as Ben explains his actions on the phone to his fellow agents, Anna discovers his identity.

A Cinderella Story
 Sam Montgomery lives in the [[San Fernando Valley]] area of [[Los Angeles]], with her widowed father Hal, who runs a popular sports-themed [[diner]]. Feeling Sam needs a mother, Hal marries a vain [[gold digging|gold digger]] named Fiona, who has socially-awkward fraternal twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella. During the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], Hal is killed when he runs to save Fiona. Having supposedly left no will, Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the house, the diner, and to her dismay, Sam.  Eight years later, Sam is employed as a waitress at the diner to save money to attend [[Princeton University]], but she is regularly tormented by her stepfamily, who constantly insult her and treat her as if they were popular, despite being regarded as obnoxious. Even worse, Fiona, in her vanity, uses the inheritance to live as if they were insanely rich, including spending on minor facial surgeries, and even refuses to save water during the ongoing drought. She has also transformed Hal's beloved diner into something befitting of her own image, demands that salmon be served and included in over half the dishes and takes Sam's earnings. Sam struggles to cope socially at North Valley High School, where queen bee cheerleader Shelby Cummings also torments her and calls her "Diner Girl", along with other members of the [[popular clique]].  Sam confides in her online pen pal "Nomad" about her dream to attend Princeton, a dream which he also shares. However, Nomad's true identity is Austin Ames, the popular, yet unhappy, quarterback of the school's [[American football|football]] team and Shelby's ex-boyfriend, although she refuses to accept that he has broken up with her. He is unhappy because Austin's father planned for him to go to the [[University of Southern California]] with a football scholarship rather than going to Princeton. Nomad proposes that they meet in person at the school's [[Halloween]]-themed homecoming dance. On the night of the dance, Fiona orders Sam to work the night shift at the diner, then leaves to drive Brianna and Gabriella to the dance. Initially reluctant, Sam is convinced by her best friend, Carter Ferrell, to go to the dance and meet her mysterious online friend.  Rhonda, Sam's other best friend, and the rest of the diner staff also convince her to disobey Fiona and go to the dance anyway. Sam, wearing a mask and Rhonda's old wedding dress, meets Nomad at the dance, and is surprised to learn that he is Austin, who had become smitten with her upon her entrance. The two decide to leave the party to walk alone and get to know each other a little better. While sharing a romantic dance, Sam and Austin begin to fall in love. But just as Austin is about to unmask her, Sam's cell phone alarm goes off, warning her to return to the diner before Fiona returns at midnight. She leaves without revealing her identity to Austin, and drops her phone on the way out.  Austin picks up her phone and begins a desperate search to figure out who his "Cinderella" really is, but every girl at school claims to be the mysterious owner of the phone. Sam is reluctant to reveal her identity to Austin, feeling that he will not accept her due to her being ordinary and Austin being popular. When Austin comes into the diner one day, Sam is forced to help him and, after a talk, she attempts to reveal her identity to him, but is cut off by Fiona. Sam's stepsisters end up discovering Sam and Austin's email relationship, and (after having failed to convince Austin that one of them is the owner of the phone) convince Shelby that Sam tried to steal Austin from her. During a pep rally, they and the other cheerleaders humiliate Sam in front of the entire school and expose her identity, as well as naming her an impostor, horrifying the school staff, Carter and Sam. Austin, hurt by Sam's secrecy, is unable to step up to defend her, and Sam leaves the pep rally in tears.  Like Austin, Sam had been accepted at Princeton, only to be duped by Fiona into believing she was rejected by having a fake rejection letter made to keep Sam working at the diner and as her slave. Sam then decides to give up on her dreams and resigns herself to a lifetime of working at the diner, but Rhonda gives Sam a pep talk not to lose hope. When her stepsisters come into the diner, they slam the door, causing a guitar clock to fall off the wall, tearing the wallpaper down with it, and quickly blame it on Sam. However, the torn section reveals an inspirational quote Hal often said, "Never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game" (in real life, this quote came from [[Babe Ruth]]) and fills Sam with hope. She stands up to Fiona and her stepsisters stating that she will no longer put up with their [[emotional abuse]], quits her job at the diner, and moves in with Rhonda, who also quits along with the entire diner staff, all of whom had only put up with so many years of Fiona's abuse after Hal's death for Sam's sake. The customers, who witness the entire scene, promptly leave in disgust as well.  Before the school's homecoming football game, Sam confronts Austin about his cowardice and not defending her at the pep rally, as well as for his seeming reluctance to show his true self. Before the final play of the game, he sees Sam making her way out of the stands, and finally stands up to his father, saying he wants to attend Princeton rather than simply play football all his life. He chases after Sam and apologizes. She accepts his apology, and they share their first kiss as rain falls over the drought-plagued valley (at the same time, the North Valley High Fighting Frogs win the football game). Soon after, Sam finds Hal's will hidden in her childhood fairy-tale book, stating that all of his money and possessions actually belong to her. Since this leaves her as the rightful and legal owner, Sam sells her stepfamily's fancy cars so that she can pay for college, and Fiona, who claims to have never seen the will before despite that she clearly signed it as a witness, is arrested for [[Fraud|financial fraud]] and violating California's child labor laws for all the times she made Sam work long hours at the diner in spite of her being a minor.  Sam finds that she was in fact accepted at Princeton; the acceptance letter is retrieved from the garbage by her stepsisters, who knew where Fiona hid it. Fiona, Brianna, and Gabriella are made by the District Attorney to work off the money they stole from Sam at the diner, which is restored to its former glory by its new owners, Sam and Rhonda. Also, Austin's father comes to accept his son's desire to attend Princeton. Things even work out in the end for Carter as he makes a commercial for a new acne medication. Shelby, having previously cheated off of Carter's school work and rejected him for being an outcast, even after he was a proper gentleman to her at the Halloween dance, aims to pursue him since he is now popular, but after finally seeing her true shallow and cruel nature at the pep rally, he turns her down for Astrid, the high school's goth DJ and announcer. The film ends with Sam and Austin, now officially a couple, driving off to Princeton together after Sam gets her phone back from Austin.  
The Chronicles of Riddick
 [[Richard B. Riddick]] has been in hiding for five years, evading [[bounty hunter]]s and mercenaries sent to capture him. After killing a crew led by the mercenary Toombs and stealing his ship, he heads to New Mecca on the planet Helion Prime in the Helion System, after Toombs reveals his bounty originated there. Riddick is reunited with Imam, the man he rescued in [[Pitch Black (film)|the first movie]]. Imam believes Riddick is a Furyan, a race of warriors long thought extinct, and wants to know about his homeworld and if anyone other than himself is left. Imam believes Helion Prime is the next planet to be conquered by a mysterious force crusading across the stars. Aereon, an Air Elemental, identifies the army as the Necromongers, religious fanatics who seek to convert everyone and kill those who refuse. The Necromongers attack, and take control of the capital in a single night. In the battle, Imam is killed and Riddick escapes.  The next day, the Necromonger high priest called "The Purifier" coerces the populace into converting, except for Riddick, who kills the man who killed Imam. Intrigued, the Lord Marshal orders Riddick be scanned by the Quasi-Dead, half-dead [[Telepathy|telepaths]], who determine that he is indeed a Furyan survivor. Lord Marshal orders Riddick's death, but Riddick escapes only to be recaptured by Toombs. Riddick is taken to Crematoria, a harsh [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] prison moon, where Jack, the girl Riddick also rescued, is being held.   The Lord Marshal sends Commander Vaako to hunt Riddick down. Vaako's wife speaks to Aereon, who reveals that Furya was devastated by the Lord Marshal after he was told a child from that planet would kill him. Dame Vaako and her husband determine Lord Marshal wants Riddick dead, as he may be the child of said [[prophecy]]. On Crematoria, a disagreement breaks out between Toombs and the prison warden over what Toombs is owed for Riddick's bounty. Word about the Necromongers has reached the prison warden, who deduces that Toombs has stolen Riddick from them. Meanwhile, in the prison, Riddick finds Jack, now named Kyra, and they eventually reconcile.  The guards kill the bounty hunters (except Toombs), take the reward money, and prepare to leave before the Necromongers arrive. Riddick leads several prisoners across Crematoria's [[Volcano|volcanic]] surface to steal the ship. The guards reach the hangar, just as the prisoners arrive to find the Necromongers have cornered them there. All of the guards and prisoners are killed, and Riddick is incapacitated by Vaako. With the approach of the vicious sunrise, Vaako leaves Riddick to die; Kyra is captured by the Necromongers.  However, Riddick is saved by the Purifier, who tells him that if he stays away from the Necromongers, the Lord Marshal promises not to hunt him. The Purifier then reveals that he too is a Furyan before committing suicide by walking out into the scorching heat after encouraging Riddick to kill the Lord Marshal. Meanwhile, Vaako reports Riddick dead and is named heir apparent by the Lord Marshal. Riddick flies back to Helion Prime using Toombs' spacecraft, after leaving Toombs caged inside the prison.  Riddick infiltrates the main hall; Dame Vaako sees him but encourages her husband not to warn the Lord Marshal, but to let Riddick strike first and pave the way for Vaako to kill the Lord Marshal and take his place as leader. When Riddick attacks, the Lord Marshal presents Kyra, who appears to have been converted. Riddick fights the Lord Marshal one-on-one in front of his army, who prevails with his supernatural powers. When it appears that Riddick is about to be killed, Kyra stabs the Lord Marshal in the back with a spear. The Lord Marshal responds by punching her into a column of spikes, mortally wounding her. Vaako attempts to strike the wounded Lord Marshal, but misses. The distraction provides Riddick with the opportunity to deliver a killing blow. Kyra dies in Riddick's arms just before the Necromongers, including Vaako, kneel before Riddick as their new leader.  
Churchill: The Hollywood Years
 In this parody, the British court and war government consist mainly of idiots and traitors. [[Adolf Hitler]] moves into [[Buckingham Palace]] and plans to marry into the [[British Royal Family|Windsors]].

The Chorus (2004 film)
 In 1999, Pierre Morhange, a [[Conducting|conductor]] performing in the United States, is informed that his mother has died before a concert. After the performance in which he conducted the [[Künstlerleben|Künstlerleben Waltz]] by [[Johann Strauss II]], he returns to his home in France for her funeral. An old friend named Pépinot arrives at his door with a diary which belonged to their teacher, Clément Mathieu. They proceed to read it together.  In 1949, fifty years earlier, Clément Mathieu, a failed musician, arrives at Fond de l'Étang ("Bottom of the Pond"), a French boarding school for "troubled" boys, to work as a supervisor. At the gates, he sees a young boy, Pépinot, waiting for Saturday at the school's gate, where he says his father will pick him up. The viewers later learn that his parents were killed in the Second World War, but Pépinot does not know about this. Mathieu discovers the boys being ruthlessly punished by the headmaster Rachin, and attempts to use humour and kindness to win them over. When a [[booby trap]] set by Le Querrec injures the school's elderly caretaker Maxence, Mathieu keeps the culprit's identity from the headmaster, while encouraging him to nurse the caretaker during his recovery. On discovering the boys singing rude songs about him, Mathieu forms a plan: he will teach them to sing, and form a choir as a form of discipline. He groups the boys into their [[Voice type#Children's voices|voice types]], but one student, Morhange, refuses to sing. Mathieu catches Morhange singing to himself, discovers he has a wonderful singing voice, and awards him solo parts on the condition that he behaves.  Morhange's single mother, Violette, arrives at the school. When Mathieu goes to explain that Morhange cannot be visited because he has been locked up as a punishment, he finds himself feeling sorry for, and attracted to, the boy's beleaguered mother, and instead tells her that Morhange is at the dentist. Meanwhile, a cruel, "[[wikt:pervert#English|perverted]]" boy named Mondain (played by Gregory Gatignol) arrives and begins causing trouble by bullying the others and generally being rebellious. After stealing a watch, he is locked up for two weeks. The choir is improving rapidly with Morhange as its lead soloist; the children are happier, and the faculty less strict—even Rachin begins to loosen up, playing football with the boys and making a [[Paper plane|paper aeroplane]]. After Mondain is released from lock-up, he runs away. At the same time, all the school's money disappears. Rachin beats Mondain, who in turn attempts to strangle the headmaster. Rachin hands him over to the police, despite not knowing the location of the stolen money, and disbands the choir. This causes Mathieu to teach his choir "underground," practicing at night in their sleeping chamber.  Mathieu continues to meet Morhange's mother, who is unaware of his attraction to her. He plans to help her son win a scholarship to the [[Music school#Conservatory|music conservatory]] in [[Lyon]]. One day she blithely informs him that she has met someone else: an engineer. Mathieu is dejected, but expresses his strained happiness as he watches her leave in the engineer's car. The Countess, a sponsor of the school, finds out about the choir: they perform before her and others, and Morhange enchants the audience with his solo. Mathieu discovers that another boy, Corbin, stole the money that Mondain was accused of taking. Despite this, Rachin refuses to accept Mondain back at the school—Mathieu is upset at this injustice. When Rachin departs to accept an award from the board after taking credit for the choir, Mathieu and Maxence rebel by taking the boys on a [[Paper Chase (game)|paper chase]]. While they are out, Mondain returns and [[Arson|sets fire to the school]] with a cigarette. Mathieu is fired for breaking the rules, even though he saved the boys' lives, and Maxence is suspended. As Mathieu leaves, the boys—forbidden to say goodbye—lock themselves in their classroom, sing and throw messages out of the window on paper planes. Touched, he walks away, musing about how he has failed and nobody knows of his existence.  Back in the present, Morhange finishes reading the diary and recounts what happened afterwards: he won his scholarship to the conservatory, and the headmaster Rachin was fired for his brutal discipline. Mathieu, Pépinot relates, continued to give music lessons quietly for the rest of his life.  The final scene shows Mathieu waiting for his bus after being fired. As he boards it, he looks back and finds Pépinot running after him, insisting that he come too. Initially Mathieu refuses because it is not allowed, and leaves Pépinot behind. Suddenly, the bus stops and Mathieu gives in: the two board the bus together. Morhange says that Pépinot finally got his wish, for he and Mathieu left on a Saturday, showing Mathieu raised Pépinot.  
Christmas with the Kranks
 After [[Riverside, Illinois]] couple Luther ([[Tim Allen]]) and Nora Krank ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) see their daughter, Blair ([[Julie Gonzalo]]), depart for a [[Peace Corps]] assignment in [[Peru]] on the Sunday following [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[empty nest syndrome]] sets in. Luther calculates the couple spent $6,132 during the previous year's holiday season and, not looking forward to celebrating Christmas without their daughter, he suggests they invest the money usually spent on decorations, gifts, and entertainment and treat themselves to a ten-day [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] cruise instead. Skeptical at first, Nora finally agrees under the condition that they still give a donation to the church and Children's Hospital. Luther tries to refuse but finally agrees and they begin planning the trip.  The Kranks are amazed to discover they are considered [[Pariah state|pariahs]] as a result of their decision. Luther's co-workers think he has become [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] when he gives all his employees letters that state about his Christmas boycott, local stationer Aubie is distressed to lose the couple's order for their engraved greeting cards and [[Christmas Eve]] party invitations, the [[Boy Scout]] troop is upset and angered when the Kranks refuse to purchase one of their [[Christmas tree]]s to help the scouts make enough money for a camporee, and the police are stunned to discover they won't be buying this year's calendar from them. Most vocal in their objections are neighbors Vic Frohmeyer ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) and Walt Scheel ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]). Vic, who's the unelected leader of the street, organizes a campaign to force the Kranks to decorate their home so Hemlock Street won't lose the coveted award for best decorations. Vic has political and bureaucratic connections in Chicago. Walt doesn't seem to like Luther, so his efforts are primarily personal. However, it is revealed that Walt's wife Bev is suffering from [[cancer]], perhaps dampening his holiday spirits. Children picket, led by Vic's son Spike ([[Erik Per Sullivan]]), neighbors constantly call, and [[Christmas carol]]ers try to revive the Kranks' holiday spirit by singing on their lawn, which Luther stops by freezing his front lawn. Even the newspaper gets into the act by publishing a front page story complete with a photograph of the unlit Krank house and states that the Kranks' street has lost the prize and won sixth place because of how Luther and Nora refused to decorate their house. Still, Luther and Nora continue to stand their ground.  The two are in the process of packing on Christmas Eve morning when they receive a call from Blair, who announces she's at [[Miami International Airport]], en route home with her Peruvian fiancé as a surprise for her parents. She's anxious to introduce Enrique to her family's holiday traditions, and when she asks if they're having their usual party that night, a panicked Nora says yes. Comic chaos ensues as the couple finds themselves trying to decorate the house and coordinate a party with only twelve hours to spare before their daughter and future son-in-law arrive.  While Nora scrambles to find food, especially Blair's favorite honey glazed ham, Luther goes to buy a tree from the Boy Scouts but they only have one worthless non-green tree left since their sales went big and rapid. Luther decides to give a donation by giving them money but taking the tree in the process; he then rejects it by throwing it in his backyard. While Spike leads a picket at the Kranks', Luther arranges to borrow the tree of neighbor Wes Trogdon (who is going away for a week with his kids and wife to close relatives) being given the warning that he is not to break one ornament or damage it. Luther and Spike try to transport it across the street on Spike's [[Radio Flyer]] wagon, only for the neighbors to confuse this with Luther stealing the family's Christmas tree and end up calling for the police to arrest him for theft. Spike comes to Luther's rescue by showing the neighbors and officers that Luther has Trogdon's keys and thus was given permission to borrow the tree. Nora comes home enraged at Luther for making the borrowed Christmas tree a "Disaster" and how she had to buy "Smoked Trout" to replace the honey ham (which was crushed by a truck). Once it is established why Luther is trying frantically to decorate his home, the neighbors, led by Vic, come out full force to help him and Nora ready it for Blair. Blair calls to say she landed from Miami; despite this, she is sent by a police transport to their house thus leaving her still unaware of the chaos.  After subtly giving everybody, including Blair and Enrique, a half-hearted toast, Luther tries to convince Nora to accept the cruise when she confronts him for the toast, but she refuses, disgusted that he isn't happy Blair is home. Having a change of heart, Luther sadly slips out of the house and goes across the street to the Scheel home. Bev's cancer, once in [[Remission (medicine)|remission]], has returned and, knowing this may be their last holiday together, Luther insists they take the cruise in place of him and Nora, going so far as to offer to take care of their hated cat, Muffles, so they can go. At first Walt and Bev decline, but ultimately decide to accept his generosity; as a result, Luther, whose holiday spirit has been renewed, realizes skipping Christmas wasn't as good an idea as he had originally thought.

On his 40th birthday, Jack is still in shock of hearing this. He sleeps on the bench near the church, in front of the nativity scene. When the maintenance worker discovers him there, he brings him inside the church for some coffee. The maintenance worker then reveals himself to be Joe Ottoman, Jack's grandfather. That night, Jack's wife Megan arrives in Texas, and Jack tells her everything that happened. Megan reveals that they are going to be parents. On Christmas Night, the townspeople of Clearwater gather around the nativity scene while the reverend talks about it.

The Clearing (film)
 Wayne Hayes ([[Robert Redford]]), and his wife Eileen ([[Helen Mirren]]) are living the [[American dream]] in a wealthy [[Pittsburgh]] suburb, having raised two children ([[Alessandro Nivola]], [[Melissa Sagemiller]]) and built up a successful business from scratch. He is looking forward to a peaceful retirement with Eileen. Everything changes when Wayne is kidnapped in broad daylight by a former employee, Arnold Mack ([[Willem Dafoe]]). While Wayne tries negotiating with the kidnapper, Eileen works with the [[FBI]] to try to secure her husband's release. During the investigation, Eileen learns that Wayne has continued an extramarital affair that he promised to end months previously.  Eileen is eventually instructed to deliver the ransom to the kidnapper, but Arnold takes the money without returning her husband; Arnold murdered Wayne the day of the kidnapping. Although Eileen's ordeal takes place over the course of a week, the film is edited to show Wayne's kidnapping as if it was happening at the same time.  Arnold is eventually caught when he begins to spend the ransom money in the neighborhood where he lives. At a local grocery store, he uses a $100 bill to make a purchase. The store manager calls authorities and verifies the serial number on the $100 bill is on a watch list the FBI distributed to local businesses. During questioning Arnold is asked if he wanted to be caught, and he admits that the kidnapping was to get money for his depressed wife, but it took him all day to bring himself to kill Wayne and he couldn't live with the guilt of his crime. In the end, Eileen receives a loving note written by Wayne before his death.  
Closer (2004 film)
  In the opening scene, 24-year-old "Alice Ayres" (Portman) and Dan Woolf (Law) see each other for the first time from opposite sides of a street as they are walking toward each other among many other rush-hour pedestrians. "Alice" is a young [[United States|American]] [[stripper]] who just arrived in [[London]], and Dan is an unsuccessful [[United Kingdom|British]] writer who is on his way to work, where he writes obituaries for a newspaper. She looks in the wrong direction as she crosses the street and is hit by a taxi cab right in front of Dan's eyes. After he rushes to her side, she smiles to him and says, "Hello, stranger." He takes her to the hospital, where Alice is treated and released. Afterward, on the way to his office, they stop by [[Postman's Park]], the same park that his father and he visited after his mother's death. Pausing in front of the office before he leaves her and goes to work, Dan reminds her that traffic in England tends to come on from the right, and on impulse, he asks her for her name. They soon become lovers.  A year later, though the two are in a relationship, Dan is cheating. He has written a novel based on Alice's life, and while being photographed to publicize it, he flirts with the American photographer Anna Cameron (Roberts). Anna shares a kiss with Dan before finding out that Dan and Alice are in a relationship. Alice arrives and uses Anna's bathroom, leaving Anna and Dan alone again. Dan takes the chance to try to persuade Anna to have an affair with him, but is cut short by Alice's return. Alice asks Anna if she can have her portrait taken, as well. Anna agrees and Alice asks Dan to leave them alone during the photo shoot. While being photographed, she reveals to Anna that she overheard them, and she is photographed while still weeping over it. Alice does not reveal what she overheard to Dan, even as he spends a year stalking Anna.  Another year later, Dan enters a cybersex chat room and randomly meets Larry Gray ([[Clive Owen]]), a British [[dermatologist]]. With Anna still on his mind, Dan pretends to be her, and using the pretense that they will be having sex, Dan convinces Larry to meet at the aquarium (where Anna told Dan she often went). Larry goes to the rendezvous and has his rude awakening there. Anna tells Larry that a man who had pursued her, Dan, was most likely to blame for the setup. Soon, Anna and Larry become a couple and they refer to Dan as "Cupid" from then on.  Four months later, at Anna's photo exhibition,<ref>The scene at the photo exhibition is the only one where all four characters are seen together.</ref> Larry meets Alice, whom he recognizes from the tearful photograph that is one of many being exhibited. Larry knows that Alice and Dan are a couple, from talking to Anna. Meanwhile, Dan convinces Anna to become involved with him. They begin cheating on their respective lovers for a year, even though Anna and Larry marry halfway through the year. Eventually Anna and Dan each confess the affair to their respective partners, leaving their relationships for one another.  Alice goes back to being a [[stripper]], heartbroken by her loss. One day, Larry runs into her accidentally at the [[strip club]] and he (heart-broken himself) is convinced that she is the girl he met before. He asks her if her name is Alice, but no matter how much money he gives her, she keeps telling him her name is "Jane Jones." He asks her to have a one-night stand with him but she refuses. The line of questioning becomes pornographic, albeit without any explicit nudity.  Eventually, Larry convinces Anna to see him one last time; she agrees to sleep with him so that he will sign the divorce papers and leave her alone. Dan suspects the affair, to which Anna confesses, and following their argument, she returns to Larry. Distraught, Dan confronts Larry to try to get Anna back. Instead, Larry tells him Alice's whereabouts, and suggests that he go back to her. Suddenly, however, out of a sheer malicious impulse, he also tells him that he had a [[one-night stand]] with her.  Alice takes Dan back. Alice also decides that she wants to return to her home country and invites Dan to come with her and he agrees. While in a hotel room celebrating being back together (and noting that it has been four years since they first met on that London street when Alice was hit by a car in the opening scene), Dan asks her whether she had a one-night stand with Larry, she initially denies it. But when he insists on the truth, she suddenly tells him that she doesn't love him anymore and goes on to say that she did sleep with Larry. Dan reveals that Larry had already told him about the [[one-night stand]] but that he's already forgiven her. She insists that it's over and tells him to leave. The argument culminates in Dan slapping Alice.  [[Image:AliceAyres.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[Alice Ayres]] tile in Postman's Park, London]] In the end, Larry and Anna are together, and Alice returns to [[New York City|New York]] alone. As she passes through the immigration checkpoint on her way back into the [[United States]], a shot of her passport shows her real name to be Jane Rachel Jones. Thus she had lied about her name during her four-year relationship with Dan.  Back in London, Dan returns to Postman's Park, and to his surprise, notices the name "[[Alice Ayres]]" on a memorial that is dedicated to a young woman, "who by intrepid conduct" and at the cost of her young life, rescued three children from a fire. The final scene shows Alice/Jane walking on Broadway towards West 47th Street with male passers-by staring at her beauty. This completes the visual symmetry within the film as it echoes the opening scene where Alice/Jane and Dan are staring at each other on the sidewalks of London.  
Club Dread
 Pleasure Island is a resort off the coast of [[Costa Rica]], owned by famous musician Coconut Pete. Staff members Rolo, Stacy, and Kelly sneak into the jungle to have sex. They are ambushed by a masked figure, who stabs Rolo to death. The killer chases the girls through the jungle. The killer pushes Kelly off a cliff and decapitates Stacy before she can reach help.  The resort staff remain unaware of the killings until Carlos' body is found behind the kitchen. Dave relates a story about a former employee who lost his mind and murdered his fellow staff members; though Pete insists it's a story made up to scare guests around the campfire, the mounting death toll suggests otherwise. Putman alerts the others when he finds Cliff murdered in a hedge maze. A message left by the killer suggests that he is targeting only the staff. All communication devices and transportation have been stolen or destroyed.  Hank, a former FBI agent, convinces the staff to continue with their jobs and allow him to catch the killer. Yu remains intent on warning the guests, despite warnings not to do so from the killer. When she lures the guests to the beach to make the announcement, she is attacked by the killer. Hank intervenes, but the killer slashes his throat and turns on Yu. Their bodies are found the next day.  The staff begins to suspect one of the guests, Penelope. Juan, believing her innocent, tries to eliminate her as a suspect. Putman disappears into the jungle after having a nightmare. Sam and Dave find a shrine of photos of Lars and his friends, in which all of the faces except Lars' have been replaced with Pete's; suspicion turns on Lars and the staff lock Lars in a room. The killer electrocutes one of the guests, causing a power failure. Putman returns, and he and Jenny deduce that Lars is not the killer, but Lars has escaped.  When Pete is found dead, the staff members turn on each other. Jenny tries to convince the group that they must work together to survive until the shuttle from the mainland returns for the guests. They reject this and split into smaller groups. Dave manages to restore the electricity. Jenny and Lars are drawn by music to the electricity hut where they find Dave's severed head. Putman is next to be killed.  During a party in the nightclub, Jenny and Lars discover Dave and Putman's bodies. The guests see the corpses and a panic ensues. Penelope, Juan, Lars and Jenny find Sam's apparently lifeless body in a mud bath. While they consider their next move, Sam leaps from the bath with a machete and grabs Lars.  Sam reveals that he wanted to kill everyone on the island because Pete had intended to sell the island to the military, but decided to give the island to Dave. Jealous, Sam decided that Dave would mismanage the resort and destroy it. Lars grabs the machete, allowing the others to escape. Penelope is lost among the party-crazed guests, and Jenny and Juan lock themselves in the nightclub. They see Sam drowning Penelope in a large tank. Juan smashes the tank and rescues Penelope. Sam prepares to kill them, but Lars appears and stabs Sam.  Sam pursues Lars, Jenny, Penelope, and Juan as they escape through the jungle. Cornered on a cliff, they jump to the water below. They find the resort's damaged boats, and try to cobble together enough working parts to leave the island. Sam appears and kills Juan, then attacks Jenny and Penelope. Lars overcomes Sam, and Sam is bisected by a rope attached to the power boat. As they motor away, Sam's lower half continues to pursue them despite his fatal wounds.  
Clifford's Really Big Movie
 A giant red [[Labrador Retriever]] named [[Clifford (character)|Clifford]] visits a [[carnival]] with his owner, Emily Elizabeth and her friends, Charley and Jetta, and Clifford's friends, Cleo and T-Bone. Clifford, Cleo, and T-Bone are amazed by an animal act known as Larry's Amazing Animals, consisting of Shackleford the Ferret, Dorothy the Cow, Dirk the Dachshund, and Rodrigo the Chihuahua. After the show, Shackleford discovers that the only way for their performances to continue is to win a Tummy Yummies Animal Talent Contest, promising fame, fortune, and a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies. When Clifford and his friends go to collect their autographs, Shackleford attempts to convince them to join the act, believing Clifford's appearance would help them improve, but none of them agree because they do not want to leave their owners.  The next day, Clifford overhears the Howards' conversation with their neighbor. He mistakenly believes he is a financial burden on the family and decides to join the Amazing Animals, with T-Bone and Cleo joining him. After escaping a town afraid of Clifford, the group finds Larry's animals. Since Larry cannot accept animals with owners, they dispose their [[dog tags]], claiming they are to trick dogcatchers. Clifford helps the others improve their acts and immediately becomes the star of the show, much to Shackleford's annoyance. Meanwhile, Emily Elizabeth searches for Clifford and finds out he ran away.  Larry's Amazing Animals finally receives entry for the Tummy Yummies contest, and Shackleford tells Clifford how much he despises him, causing Clifford to get angry and leave, although Cleo and T-Bone convince him to return. Larry's Amazing Animals wins the contest, but the CEO of Tummy Yummies, George Wolfsbottom, steals Clifford for his spoiled daughter Madison.  At a hotel, Shackleford tries to get everyone to realize Clifford just wanted the Tummy Yummies, prompting a furiously disgusted Cleo to expose his true intentions. Shackleford realizes he was wrong about him and shows the tags to Larry, and he contacts Emily Elizabeth. The animals break Clifford out of his cage, but T-Bone accidentally sets off the alarm. The group narrowly escape, and Emily Elizabeth arrives in time to claim Clifford before Wolfsbottom can get him. Clifford reconciles with Shackleford, and he, his friends, and Emily Elizabeth return to Birdwell Island.  
Citizen Dog (film)
 Pod is a country boy who moves to [[Bangkok]], despite his grandmother's warning that he'll grow a tail. He finds a small house to live in and takes a job in a [[sardine]] cannery, getting rides to work on the back of a [[motorcycle taxi]], the rider of which has been made a [[zombie]] after one day it rained motorcycle helmets and he wasn't wearing one.  One hot day the assembly line at the [[cannery]] malfunctions. In the confusion, Pod chops his [[index finger]] off and it ends up in a can that is trucked away to a local grocery store. He searches everyday, buying can after can of sardines. Eventually he sees a can jumping around and opens it to find a finger. He attaches it simply by pressing it into place.  But something doesn’t feel right. He must have someone else’s finger. During a lunch break, he recognises his own finger on a co-worker who’s getting ready to [[Nose-picking|pick his nose]]. He wrests the finger away and gives the man the other finger in return. The nose-picker is named Yod, and the two become friends.  Not wishing to lose any more fingers, Pod quits the factory and becomes a security guard. On the job in an office, he meets Jin, a maid who has her nose perpetually buried in a mysterious white book written in a foreign language that she dreams of someday understanding. The book literally landed at her feet one day while she was still living in the countryside, and since then she has been trying to decipher its meaning. She has [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], which makes her want to constantly clean and set things in order.  Pod is smitten and wishes to be closer to Jin. Inspired by Yod and his Chinese empress girlfriend, who consummated their relationship on a crowded bus, Pod asks Jin if she would like to ride the bus. But Jin refuses, saying she breaks out in a [[rash]] whenever she takes crowded public transport. Pod quits his job as a guard and becomes a [[taxicab]] driver so he can drive her to work.  Eventually, he expresses his true feelings for Jin, but she’s become obsessed with a [[hippie]] [[farang]], whom she's seen reading the same white book she has. She imagines the man is named Peter and believes he is an environmental activist who was killed in a protest in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Inspired, she starts collecting [[plastic]] bottles, gathering enough to create a mountain that towers over the city, and joins an environmental protest movement calling for a ban on plastic.  Meanwhile, Pod has adventures in his taxicab, giving rides to a little girl with a foul mouth who smokes [[cigarette]]s and plays videogames. She has a [[teddy bear]] who also swears, smokes and drinks whiskey, and she eventually throws the teddy bear away. Another passenger is a man who incessantly [[licking|licks]] things, and Pod must find a solution to make him stop. He also meets his grandmother, reincarnated as a [[gecko]], who repeats her premonition that he'll grow a tail if he stays in the city.  Jin discovers Peter at a rally, who reveals his name is actually Andre and that the white book is an Italian gay romance novel. Crestfallen, Jin throws away the book and her activist lifestyle and leaves Bangkok, telling Pod she needs to be away from him. Pod quits as a taxi driver and returns to the country, only to grow bored as country life has literally slowed down compared to his life in Bangkok. He returns to the city to find that everyone now can and has grown a tail, except for him. He becomes a celebrity, but continues to search for Jin in vain. Pod climbs the plastic mountain and finds her there, confesses his love again and kisses her, overwhelming her doubts about their future.  Six months later, the mountain is a picnic for lovebirds, the girl and her teddy bear marry, and Jin, now running a plastic company into the ground as a successful business woman, is married to Pod and expecting a child. Through a long list of reincarnated animals, Pod believes that his child will actually be his grandmother.

Collateral (film)
 Max Durocher ([[Jamie Foxx]]), a meticulous [[Los Angeles]] [[Taxicab|cab]] driver, is working to earn enough to start his own limousine business. One of the evening's fares is [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] prosecutor Annie Farrell ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]). On the drive to her office, they strike up a conversation and Annie gives Max her business card.  Max's next fare is Vincent ([[Tom Cruise]]). Impressed by Max's skill at navigating L.A., Vincent offers Max $600 to drive him for the night, against regulations, which Max reluctantly accepts. As Max waits at the first stop, a corpse falls onto his car. Vincent reveals himself as a [[Contract killing|hitman]], and the body is one of his five targets. He forces Max to hide the body in the trunk and continue driving.  At the second stop, Vincent restrains Max to the steering wheel with cable ties. Max attracts the attention of a group of young men and asks them for help, but two of them rob him and take Vincent's briefcase. Vincent returns and kills both men with his pistol. Vincent then offers to buy Max a drink at a jazz club he likes. At the club, Vincent engages the owner Daniel ([[Barry Shabaka Henley]]) in conversation, then unexpectedly kills him in front of Max. Max asks Vincent to let him go, but Vincent threatens to kill him if he refuses to obey.  Max's boss, who has been hectoring him over the radio, informs Max that his mother Ida ([[Irma P. Hall]]) is trying to reach him. Learning of Max's nightly visits to his hospitalized mother, Vincent insists that Max does not break his routine. At the hospital, Ida proudly tells Vincent that Max has his own limousine company, revealing that Max has been lying to her.  Overwhelmed, Max leaves, taking Vincent's briefcase containing files on his targets, and tosses it onto a freeway. Vincent forces Max to meet [[drug lord]] Felix Reyes-Torrena ([[Javier Bardem]]) to obtain information on his last two marks, threatening to murder Ida otherwise. Max, posing as Vincent, successfully acquires the information, but Felix orders his men to kill "Vincent" if he does not complete the job. Max heads with Vincent to the next target, Peter Lim, who is at a nightclub.  Meanwhile, Narcotics Detective Ray Fanning ([[Mark Ruffalo]]) uncovers the connection between the three victims and reports his finding to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] Frank Pedrosa ([[Bruce McGill]]). Pedrosa identifies the victims as witnesses in a federal grand jury indicting Felix the following day. Pedrosa assembles a force to secure Lim. At the nightclub Vincent manages to kill all of Felix's hitmen, Lim's bodyguards and Lim himself, then leaves the club. Fanning rescues Max and smuggles him outside, but is killed by Vincent, who beckons Max back into the cab.  Following their getaway, the two trade insulting psychological summaries of each other's life. Vincent mocks Max for his lack of ambition, while Max berates Vincent for his inability to understand other people. Aware that Vincent intends to kill him, Max deliberately crashes the cab, but both survive and Vincent escapes. A police officer arrives to help, but sees the corpse in the trunk and tries to apprehend Max. During the arrest, Max sees Vincent's open laptop, which reveals that Annie is his final target. He overpowers the police officer, pockets his gun, and rushes toward Annie's office building.  Max uses the officer's gun to steal a bystanders phone, and then uses the business card from earlier to call Annie and warn her of Vincent's approach. She is initially incredulous, until Max reveals details about the witnesses Vincent has already killed and the crime boss Felix and Max urges her to call 911. Vincent is already in the building, and Max enters in pursuit; Vincent uses a fire axe to cut the power and telephone lines on the floor Annie is on.  A tense hunt in the dark ensues. Vincent finally finds Annie, aims at her, but is shot and wounded by Max, who escapes with Annie on foot. Vincent pursues the pair onto a [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|metro rail]] train. Finally cornered at one end of the train, Max decides to make a final stand, in which he and Vincent engage in a shootout. In the final moments of their confrontation, the subway car momentarily goes dark as they exchange gunfire, the pitch darkness rendering Vincent's advantage of experience and marksmanship useless. Vincent, fatally wounded, slumps into a seat as Max and Annie look on. He repeats a remark that he had previously made about a man dying unnoticed on a Metro train, asking Max if anyone will notice, before dying himself.  Max and Annie get off at the next station, in the dawn of a new day.  
Coffee and Cigarettes
 The eleven segments that make up the film are as follows:  === Strange to Meet You ===  This is the original 1986 short ''Coffee and Cigarettes'' with [[Roberto Benigni]] and [[Steven Wright]] having a conversation about coffee and cigarettes. Steven tells Roberto about his coffee ideas, such as freezing it into "caffeine Popsicles" for kids, and how he likes to drink coffee right before he goes to sleep so he can dream faster "like a camera on those [[Indy 500]] cars". Roberto does not understand anything he says but is entertained to listen. They experiment with switching chairs, but decide to switch back again. Steven suddenly remembers he has a dentist appointment that he is afraid to go to, but has to. Roberto happily volunteers and goes instead of him.  === Twins === Originally the 1989 short ''Coffee and Cigarettes, Memphis Version'' – aka ''Coffee and Cigarettes II'' – this segment features [[Joie Lee]] and [[Cinqué Lee]] as the titular twins and [[Steve Buscemi]] as the waiter who expounds on his theory on [[Elvis Presley]]'s evil twin. Cinqué Lee also appears in "Jack Shows Meg his Tesla Coil". The scene also features a recounting of the urban legend that Elvis Presley made racist comments about African Americans during a magazine interview.  === Somewhere in California ===  Filmed in 1993 as the short ''Coffee and Cigarettes - Somewhere in California'', and won the [[Short Film Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref></ref> In this segment musicians [[Iggy Pop]] and [[Tom Waits]] smoke cigarettes to celebrate that they quit smoking, drink some coffee and make awkward conversation.  === Those Things'll Kill Ya === [[Joseph Rigano]] and [[Vinny Vella]] have a conversation over coffee about the dangers of smoking. The silent Vinny Vella Jr. also appears to beg his father for money, which is given in exchange for affection, which is not provided.  === Renée === [[Renée French (actress)|Renée French]] (played by herself) drinks coffee while looking through a gun magazine. [[E. J. Rodríguez]] plays the waiter, who is eager to be of service. He initially approaches her to serve more coffee, to which she reacts by saying "I had the right color, right temperature, it was just right". After that, he comes back several times, hesitates, and leaves. He seems intent on striking up a conversation with her.  === No Problem === [[Alex Descas]] and [[Isaach De Bankolé]] are a couple of friends who meet and talk over some coffee and cigarettes. Alex has no problems, or so he answers to Isaach's repeated questioning.  At the end of the scene, Alex takes out a pair of dice and rolls three sets of doubles.  It could be assumed that [[Alex Descas]] has an excessive gambling problem but to him it is not a problem because of what he can roll. Notice he doesn't roll the dice in front of his friend.  === Cousins === [[Cate Blanchett]] plays herself and a fictional and non-famous cousin named Shelly, whom she meets over some coffee in the lounge of a hotel. There is no smoking in the lounge, as the waiter informs Shelly (but not until Cate is gone).  Shelly tells Cate about her boyfriend, Lee, who is in a band.  She describes the music style as hard industrial, similar to the band Iggy describes.  Cate tells Shelly she looks forward to meeting "Lou" someday. Cate is made to feel awkward and uncomfortable by Shelly's constant envious remarks about how she perceives Cate's life and attitude.  === Jack Shows Meg His Tesla Coil === Features [[Jack White (musician)|Jack]] and [[Meg White]] of the band [[The White Stripes]] having some coffee and cigarettes.  They play themselves, although the scene seems to perpetuate the band's former pretense that they are indeed siblings. Jack shows Meg his [[Tesla coil]] that he says he built himself and waxes intellectual on the achievements of [[Nikola Tesla]]. In the beginning, Jack seems upset that Meg doesn't share his excitement, and it takes Meg some coaxing to get Jack to agree to show Meg his [[Tesla Coil]]. He introduces the line, "Nikola Tesla perceived the earth to be a conductor of acoustical resonance."  Cinqué Lee plays a waiter in this segment. In the end, the coil breaks, and Meg and the Waiter offer suggestions as to why it might be broken. Finally Meg says something that Jack seems to agree to, and he leaves to "go home and check it out". Meg clinks her coffee cup to produce a ringing noise, pauses, says "Earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance" and clinks her coffee cup to produce the noise again; she looks pensively out into the distance before a cut to black. Early during the segment, "Down on the Street" by [[The Stooges]] is played in the background.  === Cousins? === British actors [[Alfred Molina]] and [[Steve Coogan]] have a conversation over some tea. (Coogan offers Molina a French cigarette, but Molina saves his for later.) Molina is a very enthusiastic fan of Coogan's, who contrarily is very uninterested at their meeting and barely manages to hide this. Molina excitedly shares with him research he came across, learning that they are distant cousins, and proposes a friendship or show business project to capitalize on this. Steve Coogan still remains evasive, lightening up only when an attractive female fan recognizes him. He later tries to make up excuses to keep from ever having to hear from Alfred Molina again, and then clumsily tries to reverse this when he overhears Molina get a call from good friend [[Spike Jonze]]. But it is too late and Molina, disappointed, leaves Coogan with the bill. Although the scene is set in LA, the segment was actually shot in Brooklyn at Galapagos, Williamsburg.  === Delirium === Hip-hop artists (and cousins) [[Gza|GZA]] and [[Rza|RZA]] of the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] drink naturally caffeine-free [[herbal tea]] and have a conversation with the waiter, [[Bill Murray]], about the dangers of caffeine and nicotine. During this conversation GZA makes a reference to how he would drink lots of coffee before going to bed so his dreams would "whip by" similar to the camera-shots at the [[Indianapolis 500|Indy 500]], very similar to the same reference that Steven Wright did in the first segment. Murray requests that GZA and RZA keep his identity secret, while GZA and RZA inform Murray about nontraditional methods to relieve his smoker's hack.  === Champagne === [[William "Bill" Rice]] and [[Taylor Mead]] spend their coffee break having a nostalgic conversation, whilst [[Janet Baker]] singing "Ich bin der Welt abhanden gekommen" from [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s [[Rückert-Lieder]] appears from nowhere.  William Rice repeats Jack White's line, "Nikola Tesla perceived the earth as a conductor of acoustical resonance."  It is possible to interpret the relevance of this line to the constant recurrent themes throughout the seemingly unconnected segments.  
A Common Thread
 When Claire (played by Lola Naymark) learns that she is five months [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] at the age of seventeen, she decides to keep the baby and not to tell the [[father]] (who seems to be married). Instead, she quits her current job at a local supermarket and goes to work as an assistant for Madame Mélikian ([[Ariane Ascaride]]), an [[embroiderer]] for [[haute couture]]. Mélikian has just lost her only son in a [[motorcycle]] accident. Claire shows her willingness in taking her duties, as well as taking over Mélikian's private order when she is treated in the hospital.  
Comic Book: The Movie
 The story revolves around [[comic book]] fan Don Swan and his battle against a fictional film studio which is about to announce a film based on his favorite [[superhero]], Commander Courage.  
Cold Light
    
Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen
 Mary Elizabeth "Lola" Steppe ([[Lindsay Lohan]]) is a 15-year-old girl who grew up in New York City and wants desperately to be a famous [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] actress. Lola narrates the story. Much to her annoyance, she moves with her family to the [[suburb]]s of Dellwood, [[New Jersey]], but she confidently tells the audience, "A legend is about to be born. That legend would be me."  At school, Lola makes friends with an unpopular girl, Ella Gerard ([[Alison Pill]]), who shares her love for the rock band Sidarthur. Lola idolizes the band's lead singer Stu Wolff ([[Adam Garcia]]). She also meets Sam ([[Eli Marienthal]]), a cute boy who takes a liking to her, and makes enemies with Carla Santini ([[Megan Fox]]), the most popular girl in school.  When Lola auditions for the school play, a modernized musical version of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' called ''Eliza Rocks'', she is chosen over Carla to play Eliza, and Carla promises to make her life miserable. Lola also beats Carla on a [[Dance Dance Revolution#Similar games|dancing video game]] at an arcade, where Carla reveals that she has tickets to the farewell concert of Sidarthur, who recently decided to break up. Afraid of being one-upped by Carla, Lola falsely claims that Ella and she have tickets, too. She loses her chance to buy tickets and new clothes when her mother takes away her allowance, and the concert is sold out by the time she persuades Ella to pay for the tickets. Lola explains that they can buy tickets from a [[ticket resale|scalper]], though, and she gets Sam to sneak Eliza's dress out of the costume room for her to wear at the concert.  On the night of the concert, Lola and Ella take a train to New York City, but Lola loses the money for the tickets, and her plan to sneak into the concert does not work. Lola and Ella finally give up and walk through the city to Stu's after-show party. When they get there, Stu stumbles drunkenly out of the building and passes out in an alley. The two girls take him to a diner to sober him up, but he gets in trouble, and they end up at a police station, where Lola gives her father's New York City address.  At this point, Lola's dishonesty becomes a problem. When she met Ella, she tried to impress her by telling her a dramatic story about her father dying years earlier. Ella highly values honesty, so she becomes infuriated when she discovers that Lola's story was a lie. After Lola's father arrives, and they explain what happened, Stu gratefully takes them all back to the party, where Ella forgives Lola for lying (under the condition that she will never lie to her again), and the two girls see Carla, who sees them, as well, and looks upset. Lola talks with Stu about his work, but is disappointed to discover that he is a [[Alcoholism|drunk]].  Back at school, Carla humiliates Lola by denying that she saw Lola or Ella at the party and calling Lola a liar. None of the other students believes Lola's story about being arrested with Stu and leaving her necklace at his house.  Afterward, Lola goes home, depressed, and refuses to perform in the play, but she is spurred on by Ella's encouragement and arrives backstage just in time to prevent Carla from taking over her part. As she is about to go on stage, her mother wishes her good luck and finally calls her by her nickname, "Lola". The modernist interpretation of ''Pygmalion'' (''Eliza Rocks'') ensues. After a great performance that brings a standing ovation, the cast goes to an after-party at Carla's house, where Stu arrives to see Lola. Carla tries to save herself from humiliation by saying he is there to see her, but is proved wrong when Stu gives Lola her necklace in front of everyone. As Carla's lies become apparent, she backs away from the crowd on the verge of tears and falls into a fountain, greeted by everyone's laughter. In a conciliatory gesture, Lola helps her up, and Carla accepts defeat. After dancing with Stu, Lola dances with Sam, and they eventually share a kiss.  
Connie and Carla
 Connie ([[Nia Vardalos]]) and Carla ([[Toni Collette]]) are two performers whose lifelong friendship and co-obsession with [[musical theater]] have brought nothing but career dead ends. Despite this they continue their optimism, hosting a variety act at an [[airport lounge]]. After accidentally witnessing a mafia hit in [[Chicago]], they go on the run, landing in [[Los Angeles]]. After being fired from a beauty salon, they pose as [[drag queen]]s and audition to host a drag revue at a [[gay club]] called "The Handlebar."  Because they sing their own songs (a rarity for queens), they are hired, and their variety show (at first titled ''What a Drag (Pun Intended!)'' then later re-titled ''Connie and Carla and the Belles of the Balls'' after they add a few friends to the act) becomes a hit. Things are going smoothly but the two make a pact not to let men interfere with their life. This causes conflict when Connie falls for Jeff ([[David Duchovny]]), the straight brother of Robert ([[Stephen Spinella]]), one of their drag queen friends. As the show gets bigger, the two convince the club owner, Stanley ([[Ian Gomez]]), to convert it into a full dinner theater, and eventually their popularity threatens to expose them.  On the official opening night of the dinner theater, the mob killers catch up with them. But with the help of their drag queen friends, and to great applause from the audience (who think it is part of their act), Connie and Carla take them down. They ultimately confess their real identities to the audience and are accepted for who they are. Connie reveals herself to Jeff, who arrives after the chaos. He accepts her and becomes her boyfriend.  ===Musicals referenced or featured=== The following is a list of [[Musical theatre|musicals]] referenced or featured in the film (in the order of which they are presented in the film): [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Debbie Reynolds]] were mentioned several times before Reynolds herself appeared and performed with Connie and Carla. * ''[[Oklahoma (musical)|Oklahoma!]]'' – Connie and Carla perform "[[Oklahoma (state song)|Oklahoma!]]" as young girls in their school lunchroom and in the airport lounge and "[[I Cain't Say No]]" during their audition at "The Handlebar," the gay club where they eventually become successful. * ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' – Connie and Carla perform "[[Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)|Superstar]]" in the airport lounge and "Everything's Alright" during their first performance at The Handlebar. * ''[[Yentl]]'' – Connie and Carla perform "[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]" in the airport lounge. * ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' – Connie and Carla perform "[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]" in the airport lounge. * ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' – Peaches 'n' Creme perform "[[The Time Warp]]" at The Handlebar. * ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' – Connie and Carla perform "Maybe This Time" at their audition at The Handlebar. * ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' – Connie and Carla perform "[[Don't Cry for Me Argentina]]" at their audition at The Handlebar. * ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' – Interludes during the picture with the character Tibor seeing several performances of ''Mame'' at different venues across the country. * ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' – "[[I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair]]", is part of Connie and Carla's performance in ''What a Drag (Pun Intended!)'' at The Handlebar.

Company (film)
  The story revolves around a young man named Chandu (Chandrakant Nagre) ([[Vivek Oberoi]]) joining the world of crime in the [[Mumbai underworld]] to "make it big" someday. Gradually he learns the tricks of the trade and increases the gang's earnings and profits. This leads to his affinity with Malik ([[Ajay Devgn]]), the leader of the gang. The film features one cold-blooded murder scene in which Malik and Chandu kill Saeed and his brother Anis in the rear seat of the car on a chilling rainy day. Thereafter Malik goes on a bloody rampage killing all his opponents, to take the reins of underworld in his hands. In this stage, Malik says a prominent dialogue "Sab ganda hai par dhanda hai yeh" (It's all dirty, but it's business).  His rival gang leader and colleague under Aslam's umbrella Sharma, who was in a meeting with police inspector Rathod, is killed off. Inspector Rathod, who once tortured and abused Chandu in jail in early days, is killed at Malik's permission. However, both come at loggerheads during the execution of a [[contract killing]]. Chandu stops the deliberate vehicle crash and falls from Malik's favor. The contract was from a politician who tries to use Malik's gang to eliminate a front-runner, a contender for Home Minister's post. The assassination (a staged truck-car collision) takes place in spite of Chandu's emotional misdemeanor since Malik, not relying on Chandu anymore, gives direct orders. The rift between Chandu and Malik widens due to misunderstandings. The [[Police Commissioner of Mumbai|Commissioner of Police]], Sreenivasan [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] ([[Mohanlal]]) uses the rift to bring the mafia under control. Chandu and Malik end up becoming bitter enemies. After Chandu's retaliation of the assassination of his lifelong friend of one of lieutenants Warsi, two factions of Mumbai's once most powerful gang 'Company' went to a full-scale war.  Malik and Chandu killed as many members of each opponent gangs as possible. Sreenivasan, as the police chief of murders due to the war, became criticized greatly. But he and his men knew this war ultimately is shortening the to-do list of his department. Big numbers of button men and lieutenants from the gangs were being killed. The war results in an intense chase sequence shot in Kenya where Malik hires hitmen to kill Chandu. Chandu survives, though he is injured severely. Sreenivasan convinces Chandu to come back to Mumbai and fight his war with Malik by helping the police bring the mafia under control.  In the climax, Chandu kills the politician (the mastermind of the contract killing) in prison. At the same time, one of Chandu's aides, Koda Singh, who swore revenge to kill who went against his friend Chandu, shoots Malik point blank to death in Hong Kong. Chandu and Malik came to a truce but Chandu never withdrew his order to Koda to kill Malik. It's not confirmed that whether Chandu has forgotten to withdraw his orders or deliberately kept that on. After the assassination, Sreenivasan notified Chandu and Chandu became tremendously shocked at this news. Koda Singh was arrested by suspicion by Hong Kong police on that day. The ends shows Chandu spending the rest of his life in prison after being persuaded by the Police Commissioner to surrender.  
The Consequences of Love
 Titta Di Girolamo is a middle-aged loner who has spent the last eight years living in an upmarket hotel in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]]. Every day he puts on his suit and wanders around, avoiding contact with people. In the morning, he solves the chess puzzles in the paper and in the evening he plays Grabber with a bankrupt aristocratic couple who are marooned in the hotel they used to own. Occasionally, he rings his family in [[Italy]] but his wife is always reluctant to talk, and his grown-up children despise him. He develops feelings for Sofia, the beautiful and stylish waitress at the bar of the hotel but he refuses to speak to her because, in his shyness, he fears that love would complicate his monotone but quiet life.  The reasons behind Titta's strange existence gradually become apparent. Eight years ago, it is revealed, Titta was a [[broker]] who invested large sums of money. One day, he invested 250 billion [[Italian lira]]s on behalf of [[Cosa Nostra]], losing 220 billions in a few hours. By way of punishment, Titta was forced to live for the rest of his life as a [[Sicilian Mafia|mafia]] pawn, making regular deliveries of suitcases full of money to a Swiss bank.   Titta's other secret is that he is a [[heroin]] user. Every Wednesday at ten a.m., he goes up to his hotel room and injects himself with the drug.  One day, things start to happen: Titta's gregarious younger stepbrother turns up. He encourages Titta to engage with Sofia more. Later, two Mafia men suddenly arrive in his hotel room, which they intend to use as a base in order to carry out an assassination. As the two gangsters leave, they notice the suitcase containing the  money that Titta must deliver that week. Sofia and Titta begin an awkward relationship which is romantic but not sexual. They go shopping together, and Titta buys her some shoes.  Meanwhile, during Titta's trip to the bank that week, the bank staff counting the money by hand discover that there is $100,000 missing. Titta is already aware of this, but calmly pretends to be disgusted at their "mistake" and asks to close his account. His bluff achieves the intended result: in order to avoid offending him, and partly out of fear of the Mafia, the bank staff pretend that they miscounted, and so his theft goes unreported.  It eventually turns out that Titta has stolen the money in order to buy an expensive car for Sofia. She is initially appalled by this gift, as she feels she does not know him well enough, but later comes up to his room to apologise and to try to discover more about him. Titta reveals all his secrets to her, and Sofia is so touched that she offers to celebrate his 50th birthday with him on the following evening. He accepts.  The next day, the two Mafia assassins return and steal that week's suitcase. Titta panics and immediately telephones his [[Mafia]] contact, Pippo, who tells him to fly to Southern Italy that day to explain, but Titta says he will arrive in two days because he has an appointment to keep. However, when Sofia fails to turn up to celebrate his birthday, a despondent Titta, thinking that no-one loves him, leaves for the airport early. In reality, Sofia does not turn up because she has been in a car crash, and her ambulance passes Titta's car on the way out of town.  Arriving at his destination, Titta is taken to a nearby hotel and, after waiting in a guestroom, is interrogated by the boss. Titta explains that he has recovered the money [in a flashback we see that when the money was initially stolen by the two men, Titta regained his composure, grabbed his gun and switched off the power for the elevator, forcing them to use the stairs as a getaway. This slowed them down, and Titta was able to use the lift himself to get to the carpark ahead of them. He hid in his car, and killed the duo when they arrived].   The boss asks Titta why he did not just deposit the money and save himself a trip, but Titta tells him that he does not want to give it back, because they stole his life. At this point, the Mafia boss ominously tells a subordinate to transfer Titta's account to someone else before asking Titta to tell him where the money is. Titta again refuses. He is led away by guards and the next morning is taken to a building site. Here he is suspended from a crane above a container of fresh concrete, and told that unless he reveals the money's whereabouts, he will be drowned in the concrete. As he has already given the money to the elderly aristocrats in the hotel, he refuses.  The film ends with Titta being lowered into the concrete and thinking of his long-lost best friend Dino, who works as an electrician in the [[Alps]].  
Control (2004 film)
 [[File:Control_FilmPoster.jpeg|thumb|Still from the film]] Lee Ray Oliver is a [[death row]] inmate who is given a [[lethal injection]] before a room of witnesses. He awakes in the [[morgue]] to find that he had only been administered saline and anaesthetic. A neuropharmacologist, Dr. Copeland, tells him that he has a choice: either agree to be a human subject for an experimental drug trial with potentially serious or fatal side effects, or he will receive a truly lethal injection.  Oliver opts for the drug trial, where he is administered a "calming" medicine on a daily basis and tested extensively to see if his [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]ic tendencies decrease. Twice, Oliver fakes being relaxed to lull the guards and scientists into a false sense of ease, whereupon he attempts an escape. First he asks for a smoke, second he talks to  Dr. Copeland.  Over time, the medicine and psychological counseling do appear to lower his sociopathology, as measured physiologically and emotionally, and Oliver undergoes "phase two" of the procedure, where he is reintroduced into society, with a false identity and a changed appearance (tattoos and scars removed, dress and hairstyle change).  Oliver is under constant surveillance, but manages to escape supervision to attempt to befriend and assist a helpless bystander who was victimized during one of Oliver's past crimes. Oliver feels deep remorse now for shooting the man, which left him mentally handicapped. Though the man no longer recognizes Oliver, he cheerfully accepts the friendly offerings. However his brother, who is the man's caretaker, recognizes Oliver and seeks revenge. Simultaneously, Oliver is also being sought by the Russian mafia, who seek revenge upon Oliver for killing the nephew of a mafia boss.  Though Oliver makes progress in establishing a new life, getting a job, keeping his anger and violence in check, and developing a relationship with a female co-worker (Teresa), his past comes to haunt him, and he is captured by the victim's brother, who kills one of Oliver's pharmaceutical supervisors while kidnapping Oliver. This ultimately leads to a hit squad being sent out to put Oliver down. The doctor believes that Oliver was making progress and did not kill the man, so secretly tries to help him, entangling himself in the situation. They eventually learn that Oliver's progress was not due to the medicine after all, as he was in a control group which received a placebo, but instead was due to the counseling and Oliver's willingness to change. They try to flee the state, but are caught by the hit squad, which kills Oliver. Then the cops arrive and stop the squad from killing Dr. Copeland.  The film ends with Dr. Copeland as a counselor in a youth center.

Crash (2004 film)
  Detective Graham Waters has suffered a car accident with his partner Ria. He mentions that the citizens of Los Angeles have lost their "sense of touch." Ria and the driver of the other car, Kim Lee, exchange racially charged insults. When Waters exits the car, he arrives at a police investigation crime scene concerning the discovery of a "dead kid." While purchasing a revolver at a gun store, Farhad, a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri, argue over what box of bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as "[[Osama bin Laden|Osama]]." Farhad asserts that he is an American citizen, but the store owner continues insulting Farhad and has the security guard escort him out of the store. Faced with a choice, the store owner gives the gun to Dorri who then leaves with a specific box of bullets. Two black men Anthony and Peter carjack a married couple named Rick, a district attorney, and Jean Cabot as they are about to enter their SUV. At the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz changes their locks and leaves the keys on the kitchen counter when Jean notices his tattoos.  Waters and Ria arrive at the scene of a shooting between two drivers, both of whom are undercover police officers consisting of one who survived and the other who is dead. LAPD officer John Ryan calls an [[HMO]] on behalf of his father and has a racially charged argument with a representative named Shaniqua Johnson. Ryan and his partner Tom Hansen pull over the vehicle similar to the one carjacked earlier, despite discrepancies in the descriptions, and order the couple, director Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine, to exit. Cameron is cooperative, but Christine is argumentative. Arriving home from work, Daniel gives his young daughter Lara an "invisible impenetrable cloak," which makes her feel safe enough to fall asleep in her bed.  In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter hit a Korean man while passing a parked van, dump him in front of a hospital, and drive away. Hansen talks to his superior Lt. Dixon about switching partners, but Dixon denies that. Ryan visits Shaniqua and apologizes for the argument, but Shaniqua nearly calls security to escort Ryan out of her office. Daniel replaces a lock at Farhad's shop, but is accused of cheating by Farhad. He discovers the store has been wrecked and defaced with graffiti, causing it to face closure and Farhad to vow revenge on Daniel. Waters visits his hard drug-abusing mother, who asks him to find his missing younger brother.  Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine trapped. With the help of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. Anthony and Peter approach another navigator which happens to be Cameron's. They only see Cameron driving after they open the door and are shocked to see that the driver is black. Anthony tells Peter to shoot Cameron, but Peter does not. As police officers arrive, Cameron and Anthony both race for the car and jump in. Cameron drives away, with Anthony continuing to point a gun at him. Cameron drives into a dead end, puts Anthony's gun into his pocket, and exits the car, all the while yelling insults at the officers. Hansen vouches for Cameron, fending off the other officers, and promising to give him a "harsh" warning.  Farhad locates Daniel's house and waits in ambush. As he confronts Daniel with his gun in hand, Lara jumps into Daniel's arms, attempting to protect her father with the "invisible cloak." Daniel's wife Elizabeth runs out the front door and watches in horror as Farhad shoots Lara. Daniel clutches his daughter as Fahrad stands shocked as both realized she has not been hit by any bullet. Daniel runs into the house with his wife and daughter, leaving Fahrad outside. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes the little girl was his guardian angel, preventing him from committing a terrible crime. Dorri is then shown with the box of bullets she had purchased, labeled as [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]].   Hansen pulls over to pick up a hitchhiking Peter. As the two converse, it is clear that Hansen does not trust Peter. Peter begins to laugh suddenly, offending Hansen and causing him to pull over. As Peter attempts to explain why he is laughing, Hansen believes he is pulling out a gun and mistakenly shoots and kills Peter. In his hand is a statuette similar to the one on Hansen's dash. Horrified, Hansen hides the body in the bushes and burns his car. Waters arrives at the scene with his partner and the connection is made that Peter is his missing brother. His mother collapses upon seeing his body at the morgue, and Dorri is revealed to be the coroner. When Waters promises to find who is responsible, his mother tells him that it was his fault for not finding his younger brother.   Anthony decides to steal the van of the Korean man he accidentally hit, and drops it off at a chop shop he frequents, only to discover a number of Cambodian immigrants locked in the back of the van, revealing that the Korean man was involved in [[human trafficking]]. The chop shop owner offers him $500 per immigrant. Whilst resting in her bed after falling down the stairs, Jean hugs Maria, saying she is the only true friend she has ever had and apologizes. Anthony is seen driving into [[Chinatown, Los Angeles|Chinatown]] and sets the Cambodian people free, passing a car crash on his way out which turns out to involve Shaniqua.

Corn (film)
 Emily Rasmussen (Malone) drops out of college upon realizing that she is pregnant, and reluctantly returns to her stepfather's ([[Don Patrick Harvey|Don Harvey]]) [[sheep]] ranch to get her life together. She plans on keeping the baby, even though the father of the child, a politician, refuses to help her for fear of a scandal. Emily's mother died when she was young, and she has a very awkward relationship with her father.  Upon her arrival, Emily notices that her father's sheep are acting rather strangely; they appear to be viciously fighting over a weed that is the byproduct of their neighbor's [[maize|corn]]. That neighbor began growing corn when provided with a newly generated seed that was meant to be immune to all [[pesticide]]s. The corn was altered genetically so it could grow with very little water so it could be used in otherwise barren places, such as parts of [[Africa]], to feed starving people.  After witnessing a lamb being born with only two legs, Emily decides to investigate this corn and its weed byproduct, and learns that it is an experiment in [[genetic engineering]]. After hearing about the death of the newborn baby of a friend who regularly ate lamb, Emily realizes she has to do something to put a stop to this. Her efforts will entail standing up to the big corporation that is testing the corn, her employers, and ultimately, her father.

Crawlspace (2004 film)
 A strange man stuck in a desert wakes from his coma and goes in search of water. He discovers a lush green forest, alive with plants and animals the likes of which he could never have dreamt of. He finds a watersnake (a bizarre creature that is a snake with a human hand as its head; is made of a semi-transparent fluid; has the ability to float in air) that has been captured by a giant plant that resembles a venus flytrap, and rescues the strange creature from its clutches. In return, the creature reveals to him the secret place in the forest where water can be found.  
Creep (2004 film)
 Arthur ([[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]]) and George ([[Vas Blackwood]]) are two London sewage workers who discover a tunnel in one of the walls that neither of them is familiar with. Arthur starts exploring the tunnel alone, while newbie George stays behind. After a while, George decides to enter the tunnel too, and soon discovers Arthur, injured and in a state of shock. Moments later, a similarly injured young woman jumps out in front of them, crying for help, only to be pulled back into the darkness.  The focus then shifts to a young German woman, Kate ([[Franka Potente]]), at a party. After hearing that her friend, Jemma, went to seek [[George Clooney]] at another party without her even though they had planned to go together, she decides to try and join her. She heads to [[Charing Cross tube station|Charing Cross Underground station]], but soon falls asleep on the platform while waiting for the train. When she awakens, she is alone and the entire station has been locked up for the night. An empty train arrives and she boards it, but it soon abruptly stops and the lights go dark. While searching for help, she meets Guy ([[Jeremy Sheffield]]), a coworker who followed her from the party and whose awkward advances she kept rejecting. Guy, who appears to be under the influence, starts to flirt aggressively, and the situation quickly escalates into a rape attempt, only stopped by an unseen aggressor who drags Guy out of the train. Guy briefly reemerges, covered in blood, warning Kate to run.  Kate flees from the train and runs into a homeless Scottish couple living in a storeroom, Jimmy (Paul Rattray) and Mandy (Kelly Scott), and their dog Ray. Kate explains what happened and Jimmy reluctantly agrees to help her by taking her to the night guard after she pays him. Together, they find Guy, horribly maimed and in shock but still alive. Meanwhile, Mandy, left alone, is also attacked and kidnapped, triggering Jimmy's despair and escape into a heroin-induced stupor. Kate manages to communicate with the security guard through intercom, but the man gets killed before being able to call for help, and Guy also dies of his wounds. Kate and Jimmy decide to walk through the tunnel to the next station. A train passes by and stops near them, and Kate fears he's the maniac killer driving it, so Jimmy decides to face him to avenge Mandy's probable death, but is slaughtered as well.  While fleeing in panic, Kate falls into the sewer system below the station, where she finds Arthur's body, and from there she ends up in a storage facility with hundreds of boxes, where she finally meets and is captured by the killer, the titular "creep": a hideously deformed, [[mentally ill]] [[hermit]] named Craig ([[Sean Harris]]), who keeps his victims in semi-submerged, rat-infested cages until they're dead, after which he eats them. Kate finds herself in one of these cages, along with George. Together, they manage to escape, and end up in an abandoned medical facility (looking like an illegal abortion clinic with a long series of fetuses lined up along a wall) where they find an unconscious Mandy strapped to a rusty surgical chair. Thinking she's dead, Kate and George move on. After they're gone, Craig puts on a surgical gown and mimics the gestures of a surgeon in front of a terrorized Mandy before he disembowels her with a bone saw while apparently mimicking an abortion procedure.  Back in the railway tunnels, Kate and George find the disused railcar where Craig lives. Ray is there, and also old pictures of a medical doctor with a deformed child. Craig ambushes them, but George gains the upper hand. Kate has an opportunity to finish the creep but Craig parrots Mandy's pleas for mercy, which confuses Kate long enough for Craig to kill George. Kate tries to run away, but she's relentlessly hunted down by Craig. In a last, desperate effort, she sinks a hook and chain in Craig's throat, then has a running train rip it apart and Craig eventually bleeds to death. Tattered and filthy, Kate eventually gets back to the initial station when it's already the next morning. She collapses on a platform's floor; Ray the dog shows up and curls onto her lap. Mistaking her for a beggar, a man waiting for the train leaves a coin next to her; Kate breaks into hysterical giggles and tears.

After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees.  Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.

 Shin-chan and his friends discover an abandoned movie theater where some sort of western film is being displayed to an empty room. Shinnosuke's friends mysteriously disappear thus making the Nohara family start searching for them at the location they were last seen. While looking for the other kids, the Noharas inexplicably find themselves taken into the movie being exhibited.  
Cube Zero
  The film starts with a man, Ryjkin, trying to escape from the Cube. He enters a room and is sprayed with liquid that he thinks is only water. However, when he rubs the back of his hand due to itchiness, his flesh liquifies and falls off. This soon happens all over his body, as he then melts on the floor and dies as a result.  A man named Eric is watching a video feed of this in an observation room with a co-worker named Dodd. Afterwards, Eric is shown to be sketching a portrait of Dodd in the form of a [[superhero]] called Chessman, while playing chess with him at the same time. Dodd has the chess board in front of him, but Eric is at another table, simply drawing and naming his moves. Eric seems to be vastly intelligent, calculating all of Dodd's moves. After Eric wins, he asks Dodd questions about their missing colleagues. Dodd tells him not to ask too many questions or get involved with the occupants of the Cube because it wouldn't make "those upstairs" happy.  Both Eric and Dodd get an order from "upstairs" that asks them to record the dream of a subject, Cassandra Rains. In her dream, Eric sees that she was captured while walking in a pleasant forest with her daughter named Anna. After waking, Cassandra meets the other occupants of the Cube. One of the men, Robert Haskell, has a tattoo on his forehead like the soldier who captured Cassandra. However, Haskell, like everyone else, has no recollection of his former life or how he got there - he only knows his name. According to what Eric and Dodd know, everyone in the Cube faced a death sentence and was presented with a choice: Go into the Cube with their memory completely erased, or take the death sentence. For this process, a unique consent form must be signed for someone to be placed in the Cube. Eric discovers that there is no consent form in Cassandra's file and argues with Dodd that they should inform the people "upstairs" about this. Meanwhile, Eric and Dodd get "lunch", in the form of a flavored pill, from "upstairs" via the elevator.  Just when Eric is about to make a call to the superiors, the phone rings. They are instructed to perform the "exit procedure" for a subject who has reached one of the exits of the Cube; one of their former colleagues, Owen. During the exit procedure, Owen is asked if he remembers his name, which he answers correctly. Owen is then asked if he believes in God, to which he says no, which prompts Eric to press the "no" button, which immediately [[incineration|incinerates]] Owen. Eric argues with Dodd over the fate of Owen, on which he says that he said "no", and that no one said yes. Eric realizes that the Cube is inhumane and that those "upstairs" are planning to place people in the Cube randomly without consent. He decides to enter the Cube to help Cassandra escape it. He distracts Dodd and enters the elevator, which contain only three buttons: "UP", to the "upstairs" room; "MIDDLE", pointing to their office; and "DOWN", to one of the entrances into the Cube, which he selects.  Jax, one of the Cube's supervisors who monitors the employees, and two of his analysts arrive from "upstairs" to stop Eric from helping Cassandra, but despite their efforts to stop them, Eric and Cassandra make it to the exit room with the help of Dodd, who sabotages the control panels servicing the Cube. He then swallows the main power coupler for the cameras inside the Cube in an act of defiance. Jax paralyzes him and guts him open alive, retrieving the coupler. The sabotage incapacitates the Cube, causing every trap to shut down like Eric planned. He informs Cassandra that they only have 10 minutes to escape before the Cube enters "Reset Mode," which sterilizes the rooms by vaporizing everything inside.  Once Eric and Cassandra reach an "exit room," Haskell catches them. They escape using a secret auxiliary exit just as the Cube enters "Reset Mode," which vaporizes Haskell. They escape into a lake and end up in a forest; however, soldiers searching for them have already arrived. Cassandra manages to escape, but Eric is shot by a dart and passes out.  Eric wakes up in a surgery room and confronts Jax, who reveals that Cassandra may have gotten away. He claims that Eric has been found guilty of "high treason" and "sabotage" against "country and your [Eric's] God", and also tells him that "your sentence has been extended for two more lifetimes". Jax claims Eric has already been convicted in a trial and shows him his consent form, saying he agreed to become a test subject many years ago but does not remember. Against his will, his brain is surgically altered, as Eric dreams about Cassandra reuniting with her daughter and praising Eric as a superhero. Eric is then lobotomized and put back in the Cube. After his brain was altered, Eric is left mentally handicapped. He repeatedly mentions the color of the room and has a repetitive twitch in his right hand. He is found by new captives of the Cube who wonder how he could have possibly survived, mirroring Kazan's initial appearance in the [[Cube (film)|first film]], hinting that he and Kazan may have been given the same condition, or even be the same person (In the DVD commentary of the film, director [[Ernie Barbarash]] stated they are not supposed to be the same character, specifying that perhaps he was also a technician like Wynn, and was subject to the same mental procedure, much like a tool of those in charge of the cube-like structure).

D.E.B.S. (2004 film)
 Four female students are about to graduate from a secret paramilitary academy known as D.E.B.S. (Discipline, Energy, Beauty, and Strength). The team consists of Max Brewer, who tends to draw her gun at the slightest provocation; Janet, who wishes for nothing but to earn her stripes as a true D.E.B.; the chain-smoking and promiscuous Dominique; and Amy Bradshaw, who is doubtful about being a spy, despite being an honor student at the academy. Amy has broken up with her boyfriend Bobby Matthews, a [[Homeland Security]] agent. Her personal life takes a back seat to the re-emergence of Lucy Diamond, a criminal mastermind who, by coincidence, is the subject of Amy's thesis. The D.E.B.S. are sent by the heads of D.E.B.S., Miss. Petrie and Mr. Phipps, to survey Lucy, expecting to witness criminal dealings, and unaware that Lucy has simply been set up on a blind date by her chief henchman and best friend, Scud to meet Russian assassin Ninotchka Kaprova.   The date is a complete disaster, ending in a shootout where Lucy escapes in the chaos. As the D.E.B.S. follow her, they split up, with Amy eventually running into Lucy. Lucy attempts to charm Amy, who is surprised to learn Lucy is a lesbian, since none of the material she studied for her thesis reveals this, into lowering her gun and disappears the moment Amy's attention wavers. The team is reunited, and they praise Amy for being the only federal agent who has ever encountered Lucy and lived to tell about it. Later, Lucy returns to speak with Amy and coerces her into going out for a night of fun, roping Janet into the events to prevent being found. They end up at a club, where Janet ends up bonding with Scud while Lucy further charms Amy. The two learn more about each other, and as Lucy senses Amy's attraction, she leans in to kiss her, only to be interrupted by a shocked Janet. Lucy takes the two D.E.B.S. home. Janet is indignant, claiming that Amy is violating protocol, and is further troubled at learning Amy might not be straight.  Amy blackmails her into silence by telling her that she can withhold her stripes if she tells anybody.   The next day, Miss Petrie meets with Amy and promotes her to squad leader, effectively replacing Max. Max is furious, but must follow Amy as they respond to a bank heist orchestrated by Lucy. Amy and Max continue to bicker when responding to the bank heist, while unbeknownst to them, Lucy has only committed the crime in order to see Amy again. Amy finds Lucy, they kiss, and Lucy asks Amy to come with her. The other D.E.B.S. find a note spray-painted on the wall reading "I have the girl", that leads them to assume Amy has been kidnapped, though Janet seems to know exactly what has happened. Miss Petrie organizes a nationwide manhunt to find Amy, while Janet desperately tries to keep Amy apprised of the situation by calling, though Amy never hears any of Janet's phone messages. Amy tells Lucy of her dreams of running off to Barcelona, but Lucy and Amy are seen by a jealous Ninotchka, and she anonymously tips the D.E.B.S. to their location. The D.E.B.S. catch the two women having sex, causing Max storm out in disgust, followed by Dominique, Bobby and Janet. Though Lucy tries to reassure her, Amy returns, mortified, to the D.E.B.S. in attempts to explain herself.   Miss Petrie decides to exile her, but Max steps in with an alternative to save Amy's reputation and thus prevent the D.E.B.S. from looking foolish. Meanwhile, Lucy does everything she can to win Amy back, returning everything she has ever stolen, and with Scud's help, plans to crash the D.E.B.S. year-end dance, where Amy is to be made D.E.B. of the year. Lucy fights her way to the auditorium, and is just in time to hear Amy publicly give her speech about how awful it was to be Lucy's captive, but when Amy and Lucy meet eyes, Amy retracts her entire speech, and admits that the days she spent with Lucy were the best days of her life, before running offstage. She and Lucy find each other in a storage room very like the one in which they first met, and they share another long-awaited kiss. Max and the squad catch up to them, but Max reconciles herself with the fact that her best friend is in love. She lets them go and helps Amy and Lucy make their escape, later awarding Janet with her stripes. Lucy and Amy ride off into the night, heads on one another's shoulders.

He walks into the darkness, disappears, and the ball is bounced outside again.  While Nao sorts the drinks in the freezer, she sees a pair of eyes staring back at her. Meanwhile, Ryouko finds a product that expired three years previously. She questions the Kituras, who blankly continue staring in a [[CCTV camera]]. Two crows crash into the window, killing themselves. Nao and Ryouko go to outside to investigate, where the Kituras are somehow already present and hosing away the crow remains, laughing madly. That night, a man and woman make purchases for 699 yen and 999 yen respectively. On the way home, the woman is stalked by a man with a [[sledgehammer]], who eventually appears inside her apartment and attacks her.  The next day, Ryouko receives a call from Tejima, who tells her "everyone has feet" before the signal cuts to static. After dark, the night clerk, Komori, serves the hooded man. The till registers 44.44444 yen, and Komori looks up to find only blackness in the hood. The man then forces Komori's head inside the hood. Komori comes out in shock and panic. Ryouko arrives and sees that one of Komori's eyes has monstrously bulged out of his sockets. Ryouko takes over Komori's shift and charges a woman 666 yen.

When he wakes up, the man is attacked and killed by the elderly clerk of the bathhouse. He grabs the man's steamed bun and eats it while watching the television.  That same night, Nao is standing at a [[railroad crossing]] when the hooded man appears and tries to pull her toward the passing train. She resists until the train passes and the hooded man disappears. The following day, Nao finds a homeless woman who tells her to come with her to learn more about the store. Nao and the woman are joined by Ryouko at the park. The woman reveals that the store's owner mistreated his [[General contractor|contractor]] when it was being built. The contractor, in anger, broke apart the tombstones of people without families and used the fragments to build the store's foundation, resulting in its haunting. Ryouko tells Nao to stop working there.  Nao comes to the store and saves Komori from a ghost in the bathroom. Komori, regaining his sanity, runs out of the store where, in the sun, he [[baptism|baptizes]] himself in the river. He throws away his jacket, regains his composure, and leaves with Nao. Ryouko, walking toward the store to work, finds a wheelchair rolling down the hill. Her boss Temija tells her every ghost does not have feet and he is happy. Ryouko thanks him and walks away.

One day he ran into an old school friend, Song Man-su, by chance and they spent the next few weeks partying every night, to his wife's chagrin. Soon Man-su approached him at his place of work, asking if he could use one of the rooms to teach ballroom dance, openly admitting that he is a gigolo. Park vocally turned him down, but a co-worker ended up giving Man-Su permission. The classes proved to be a great success and Man-su asked Park if he would want to help teach the classes. Initially, Park refused, not wanting to be a part of that world, but eventually he agreed to take a single lesson from Man-su. Upon taking the first step of his [[Jive (dance)|jive]], Park instantly fell in love with dance.  Over the next few days, Park assisted Man-su in his lessons by day, and took additional ones from him at night, his entire life being obsessed with dance. However, this happiness came to an end when Park's office was trashed by a man cuckolded by Man-su. That night, Man-su met Park, saying that he would be going to prison for a while, revealing that he doesn't think of dance as art, just as a way of seducing women. Park was inflamed by this and resolved to redeem dance from the image of scumbags like Man-su.  Since studios were scarce, Park left his home, wife, and child in a quest to learn how to dance properly. His teachers included a geriatric old man who could barely move unless he was dancing Jive, an alcoholic lighthouse keeper who threw himself into the ocean after he finished teaching Park the [[waltz]], a [[quickstep]]ping rancher, a steelyard worker who danced the [[cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], a monk who could [[paso doble]], and a construction worker who taught him the [[tango (dance)|tango]]. After spending five years across the country, Park finally returned home to his family.  Song relays this part of the story to her superior, who is struck by how callous Park must be to abandon his family for five years. However, Song expressed doubt that someone who could pursue dance so earnestly could be a swindler. Back at the hospital, Song asks Park to teach her how to dance. Just like Park, she fell in love with dance with the first step of her jive. For then on, she stalls on getting more testimony from Park, instead taking numerous dance lessons from him. Eventually, the two go out together and he continues his story.  Despite his wife growing increasingly angry at him, the only thing on Park's mind was dance. He eventually lowered himself to going to a shady cabaret bar in order to dance. There he met a woman he only referred to as Madame, and they began to waltz together nightly. Park was happy just to be dancing, but Madame wanted more out of the relationship, eventually forcing herself upon him. After that incident, Park cut off all contact with Madame, despite her persistent efforts to get in contact with him.  After a few weeks, he decided to meet with her. In order to spare her feelings, Park made up a story about how he couldn't see her because he had to tend to his failing business.  This touched her heart and the next day she gave him an envelope of money, which he reluctantly accepts. Following this, Park went through a long string of dancing relationships, each ending similarly, with him receiving an envelope of money. He used this money to provide for his family and his married life seemed to have improved.  Man-su caught up with Park once again, telling him even though he was in and out of prison that he heard about Park's exploits, and that he was quickly becoming a legend in the gigolo community. Park was disgusted by being compared to the likes of Man-su, and he angrily maintains that he is not a gigolo. However, this belief was brought into question when he was attacked by the angry husband of one of his former partners.  While taking his son to a school recital one day, Park ran into Madame, also taking her child to the recital. After an awkward conversation, Park agreed to have one last waltz with Madame, dancing to the sound of their children singing. Park's wife arrived as they were finishing their dance, and angrily slapped him. Soon after they were divorced.  After hearing this part of his story, Song turns on Park calling him a gigolo. As always, Park denies this, but Song leaves all the same. She meets her superior telling him that Park confessed, but she doesn't have it on tape and asking to be removed from the case. Torn between her love of dance and her disgust at Park, she tracks down Man-su asking him where she can find Park. In telling her where he will be, Man-su relays more of Park's story to Song.  Shortly after his divorce, Park met woman named Ji-yeon at the cabaret bar and they began dancing rumba together. For the first time, he fell for one of his partners; her soft-spoken purity enraptured him. However, she didn't reciprocate his feelings, eventually falling out of contact with him.  When they finally meet again, Ji-yeon told him about how her cafe was on the verge of bankrupt. They met again after this and Park gave her an envelope of money, which she tearfully accepts. As they are on the verge of consummating their relationship, Ji-yeon's brother walked into the room and beats Park so viciously that he ends up in the hospital Song would go undercover in. Even throughout his recuperation, Park went out to the cabaret bar every night hoping to see her again. Man-su found him and told him that Ji-yeon was actually an escort, as famous as Park is in the field. He also told him where she would be that night.  Song and Man-su race to the club, hopefully before Park does something foolish. However, Park is already there and confronts Ji-yeon, who is working another mark. She publicly denies knowing Park, though later she coldly acknowledges him, telling him to stop acting like a kid. This sets him off and he grabs her by the hair, intent on harming her. Song arrives just in time and defuses the situation; however, the police arrive just after. With the chief's wife finally agreeing to testify, they arrest him.  Two years later, ballroom dancing has been legitimized in Korea, rebranding itself as [[DanceSport]]. Song now runs a dance studio herself. She manages to find Park, who is living at the lighthouse of his former teacher. Park claims that he no longer dances, but Song reignites his passion with an energetic jive and romantic waltz.

Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)
  After finishing a long shift as a nurse, Ana returns to her suburban neighborhood and her husband, Luis. Caught up in a scheduled date night, they miss an emergency news bulletin. The next morning, a neighborhood girl enters their bedroom and kills Luis, who immediately reanimates as a zombie and attacks Ana. She flees in her car, crashes, and passes out. Upon waking, Ana joins police sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda. They break into a nearby mall and are attacked by a zombified security guard, who scratches Luda. Three living guards—C.J., Bart, and Terry—make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. They split into groups to secure the mall. On the roof, they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded in his gun store across the zombie-infested parking lot.  The next day, a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot, pursued by zombies. C.J. and Bart wish to turn them away but are overruled and disarmed. The newcomers include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen, Frank and his daughter, Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside via wheelbarrow, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the group determines the disease is passed by bites. Andre leaves to see Luda, who has kept her scratch hidden from the group. They realize that Frank has been bitten and is a potential threat. After some debate, Frank elects to be isolated.  When he dies and turns, Kenneth shoots him.   Kenneth and Andy start a friendship by way of messages written on a whiteboard; romance also buds between Ana and Michael, and Nicole and Terry. When the power goes out, CJ, Bart, Michael and Kenneth go to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator; they find a friendly dog and worry about a breach. Zombies attack and kill Bart, forcing the others to douse the zombies in gas and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, Luda—tied up by Andre—gives birth and dies. She reanimates as Norma checks on the couple. When Norma kills the zombified Luda, Andre snaps; they exchange gunfire and both are killed. The others arrive to find a zombie baby, which they kill immediately. The group decides to fight their way to the local marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on [[Lake Michigan]]. They reinforce two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape.  To rescue Andy, the group straps supplies onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters Andy's store safely, but a zombie follows through the dog door. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and C.J shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation via the buses.  While navigating through the city, Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing himself and Monica; blood splatters on the windshield, causing their bus to crash. Steve tries to flee on his own, but is ambushed by a zombie. While C.J., Kenneth, and Terry look for survivors, Ana kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. At the marina, C.J sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Michael, after revealing a bite wound, kills himself as Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips flee on the yacht. Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows Steve's escapades before the outbreak and concludes as the group runs out of supplies, arrives at an island, and is attacked by a swarm of zombies.  The camcorder drops, leaving their fate unknown.  
Darkness (2002 film)
 Forty years after an unfinished [[occult]] [[ritual]] resulted in the disappearance of six young children, an American family has moved into a never-before inhabited house in Spain. The mother, Maria (Olin), wants to get the place in order, while the father, Mark (Glen), goes to work, and their children, teenager Regina (Paquin) and her younger brother Paul (Enquist), try to settle into their daily routines.  It helps that Mark's doctor-father, Albert Rua (Giannini) has furnished them with their residence and is nearby, especially when Mark begins to suffer from seizures again due to the progression of his [[Huntington's disease]], which also causes him to become increasingly mentally unstable. Regina is not only worried about him, but also Paul who is now scared of the dark for the first time. The young boy has reason for that, however, as there seems to be some sort of supernatural entity beneath his bed. Furthermore, there are instances when ghostly figures of children are seen standing in the shadow and darkness, watching the family.  As Paul becomes more scared and their father continues to mentally deteriorate, Regina eventually figures out it must have something to do with their home where the power is lost every day. With the help of her new friend, Carlos (Martinez), the two eventually meet the man, Villalobos (Reixach), who designed the house, and learn that it was built for a supernatural ritual requiring the [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of seven children (each sacrificed by "hands that love them") to coincide with an [[eclipse]] that only occurs every forty years. With the next one quickly approaching, and now armed with the knowledge that the earlier occult ritual needs one more death to be completed, Regina races to make sure that Paul is not the final victim.   Stopping first at her grandfather Albert's house to warn him as well, Regina finds out that her grandfather is, in fact, a member of the cult which has been performing these [[Satanism|satanic]] rituals. Her grandfather explains that in the ritual forty years ago, there actually ''were'' seven children in the original ritual, the seventh child being none other than Regina's father, Mark. Albert did not sacrifice his son because at the last minute he realized that he did ''not'' love Mark. Waiting 40 years he has brought Mark and his family to the house with the intention of completing the ritual during this eclipse. Regina also discovers the target is not Paul but still Mark, who is to be sacrificed by "hands that love him."   Armed with this knowledge, Regina races back to her home to find her father in the midst of another attack, choking on pills as the eclipse begins. Maria tries to perform a [[tracheotomy]] on him, but is unable to bring herself to make the cut. Regina does instead, but Mark bleeds out and dies when the supernatural forces within the house hide the tube needed to complete the procedure. Since Regina genuinely loved Mark, the ritual is finally complete. The darkness then takes the form of Regina and Paul, convincing their mother to turn off the lights. The darkness kills Maria, and then takes the form of Regina's friend Carlos, who picks them up in his car; shortly after they leave, the real Carlos arrives at the house, and is likely killed. The movie ends as Carlos' [[doppelgänger]] drives Regina and Paul into a dark tunnel, implying their doom.

Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King
 '''''Part 1'''''  The film is set around the time when many Europeans had changed their religion from paganism to Christianity. The film is split into three parts, and comprises the story of Siegfried from childhood to his death. The film opens with a young Siegfried awakening in the middle of an invasion of his parents' castle by [[Saxons]]. The castle is soon overrun and all are slain except for Siegfried, whose mother has sent him down the river. In the morning he has lost his memory and is picked up by a blacksmith, Eyvind, who raises him under the name Eric.  Twelve years later, [[Brunhild]], the Queen of [[Iceland]] (still a pagan like Eyvind and Eric) follows her adviser's [[rune]]s that lead her to where Eric lives. The runes foretell that a star will fall from the sky and from its smoke a man will appear who will defeat her. Brunhild initially has doubts as no one has ever beaten her in a fight before. That night a [[meteor]], a described announcement to a war between the gods called [[Ragnarök]], hits the earth near the smithy and despite Eyvind's warning, Eric goes to investigate. In the middle of the crater there are two rocks of a strange kind of metal. Wearing a cloak over her face, Brunhild arrives and Eric, believing she is a Saxon, attacks her. After a short battle he defeats her, and they instantly fall in love with each other, seeing their gathering as the will of the gods. After making love, Eric promises to go to Iceland to meet Brunhild and they fall asleep. In the morning Eric wakes up alone after Brunhild has taken one of the rocks and left. Eric convinces Eyvind to let him go with him to Burgund (the [[Burgundians#First Kingdom|kingdom of the Burgundians]]) and on their way down the river they see a town in flames.  Once in Burgund the [[hawk]] Arminius, belonging to King Gunther's brother Giselher, lands on Eric's arm and there is a brief fight between Eric and some of the townspeople. Afterwards Eyvind presents his [[sword]]s to Gunther, who reveals that the [[dragon]] [[Fafnir]] has awakened and is responsible for the burnt village. King Gunther and his best men, including army chief Hagen, leave to slay the dragon; Giselher befriends Eric and says that his sister Kriemhild is wanted by every man in the kingdom but she doesn't want any of them. Eyvind leaves Eric to use the rock from the meteor to make a sword.  Gunther returns injured with Hagen; all the other knights have been killed. Eric promises to Kriemhild that Gunther and his men will be avenged. He enters Fafnir's lair and, after a fierce battle, manages to slay the dragon while receiving only a scratch on his arm. Seeing that Fafnir's blood has healed his scratch, Eric bathes in the blood, rendering his skin invulnerable (save for a single spot where an errant leaf had fallen upon his upper back, leaving that one spot untouched by the blood).  '''''Part 2'''''  Eric explores the cave and finds a vast hall filled with treasure. He finds a ring, the [[Ring of the Nibelung]] and is then confronted by [[ghost]]s of immortal twilight beings, the [[Nibelung]]s. They warn him that taking any of the treasure will bring a [[curse]] down on him, but he does not listen and takes the ring and promises to come back for the rest. Outside he is attacked by an ex-Nibelung who lost his immortality for trying to take all the treasure, who happens to be Hagen's father [[Alberich]]. Eric soon defeats Alberich and takes his [[Tarnhelm]], an item that lets him take the shape of anyone else. The Nibelungs tell Siegfried again to return the treasure, and when Siegfried offers to return half to them they say it will not be sufficient. Eric returns to Burgund with Fafnir's head and shows it to the people and Gunther proclaims he is a [[hero]], which makes Hagen jealous.  That night, Eric dances and spends the evening with Kriemhild who wears a mask during the party and tells her he is already in love with another woman (Brunhild). Meanwhile, the entire dragon's hoard is moved to the Burgund treasury and fills it near to overflowing. The Saxons suddenly decide to invade Burgund to take the gold and Eric rides with the army to confront the twin Saxon kings, the men who slew his father. During a short fight Eric remembers who he is, then he declares the kingdom to be split between himself and King Gunther. He sadly remembers his father's death, giving the two Saxons the choice to leave, but they attack again and are slain.  It is also at this point that Eyvind (who tells Eric that he suspected his origin from the beginning) passes away from old age and Siegfried gives him a proper pagan [[funeral]] in his honor.  A [[raven]] lands on his arm that delivers a message to Brunhild that Eric is actually Siegfried of Xanten, that he had found his real place and identity and that he will visit her soon, planning to make her his wife as soon as possible, but warning it may take a little longer because he desires to take his treasure to Xanten for her. Having overheard Eric and Kriemhild at the party, Hagen's father makes a potion that Kriemhild gives Eric, that causes him to fall in love with her and forget Brunhild. A raven who would deliver this news to Brunhild is then shot down by Hagen.  '''''Part 3'''''  Siegfried, having forgotten about Brunhild, asks to marry Kriemhild, but Hagen reminds Gunther that he must marry before any of his siblings. Gunther reveals he is pining for Brunhild, but he is not the best fighter and she challenges all her suitors to single combat and no-one has beaten her yet. Gunther promises Siegfried that he may marry Kriemhild if he uses the Tarnhelm to look like Gunther and defeat Brunhild; Siegfried accepts this offer. On the ship to Iceland Giselher has stowed away and after support from Siegfried, Gunther lets him accompany them to Iceland. Once they arrive Brunhild is immensely happy that Siegfried has returned to her but is shocked to see that he doesn't recognize her or is challenging her. Siegfried simply presents King Gunther to her, and explains he is the one who came here to ask her hand in marriage. Gunther his then challenged to [[single combat]] with double bladed [[axe]]s on the condition that if he loses it will cost him his life. He agrees partially because it will be Siegfried fighting, not him.  The fight starts and unbeknown to everyone else Giselher sees the two Gunthers and becomes suspicious but tells no one. Brunhild loses the fight after the two fall off a waterfall and Siegfried saves her. She reluctantly and sadly returns to Burgund where she is devastated to find that Siegfried had found Kriemhild for lover. She then  marries Gunther next to Siegfried and Kriemhild who are also marrying on the same day. Brunhild confronts Siegfried who (due to effects of the potion) claims he never loved her, which Brunhild ardently refuses to believe and tries to find reasons that would explain his actions, but Siegfried once again denies caring for her, and Brunhild declares she will not know joy until she forgets how much she loved him, or until he remembers. She is deeply hurt and upset. She takes her anger out by first challenging Siegfried to combat which he purposely loses to take away any thoughts that it was him who defeated Brunhild, then Brunhild ties Gunther up after revealing the power she possess comes from her pageant belt. And overpowering him, pointing out her doubts in the way Gunther defeated her back in Iceland by nearly accusing him to have cheated his victory, and leaves him tied up for the night greatly convinced she had been deceived. Gunther requests Siegfried use the Tarnhelm again to get the belt away from Brunhild which he does after hesitation. He overpowers Brunhilde who is surprised to see that Gunther once again found his strength, she then offers herself to Siegfried as Gunther, who is briefly conflicted perhaps remembering of his old feelings towards Brunhild, but nonetheless retrieves himself from the room to get rid of the belt he has taken from her.  The real Gunther shortly returns to the room at his place and is spotted by Giselher who again sees two Gunthers and tells his girlfriend Lena what he saw in Iceland. Siegfried returns to his bedroom to see Kriemhild waiting for him, she convinces him to explain what has happened and he does, breaking his vow of secrecy towards Gunther. The next day outside the church Kriemhild is stopped because she cannot enter before Brunhild, Brunhild arrives quickly afterwards and Kriemhild reveals to her that it was Siegfried who defeated her both in Iceland and in her bedroom thereby publicly confronting and insulting Brunhild. She proves her says by showing Brunhild her belt around Kriemhild's waist. This drives Brunhild over the edge. Hagen kills Alberich after not returning the Tarnhelm to him and then serves of council to Gunther after the incident at the church. Hagen points out the betrayal of Siegfried on his vow and his threatening power that could well plot the downfall of Gunther knowing Siegfried also had a claim to the throne, being married to the king’s sister Kriemild. He tells Gunther that the people will not forget the way Siegfried had substituted for him both in Iceland and in the privacy of his room, he convinces Gunther that they may go as far has to Believe that any son of Gunther will be considered as the bastard son of Siegfried. Gunther then decides to send Siegfried back to Xanten and out of Burgundy, but is then stopped by Brunhilde who establishes that the punishment is far too light, and describing herself as disgraced and fooled, she asks for Siegfried’s death to Gunther who firstly refuses given his relationship with Siegfried but reluctantly accepts because Brunhild threatens to kill herself if the punishment is not carried out. Gunther is disillusioned but Hagen plans on Siegfried’s death the next day during the hunt as a simple accident. Siegfried confronts Kriemhild who breaks down after thinking about all she has done, Siegfried assures her that everything is all right, and that they are leaving to live in Xanten the next day after the hunt. The men leave for the hunt, where Gunther and Hagen plot to cause Siegfried's death, but for a long time they are unable to. Kriemhild confronts Brunhild again and returns her belt, Brunhild reveals her troubled state of mind is because of Siegfried forgetting about their love. Kriemhild realizing that Siegfried's previous love was in fact Brunhild is devastated with guilt and confesses upon her use of  the potion given to her by Hagen.  Brunhild realizes that it was not Siegfried's fault that he forgot her and that she has just sentenced him to death. On the hunt Hagen kills Siegfried by throwing a [[javelin]] through his weak spot (which Hagen found out about by eavesdropping on Siegfried and Gunther while going through a blood brother ritual). Siegfried remembers his love for Brunhild and says her name before death seizes him. His body is found by Giselher before they must go back to Burgund and it is wept over by Kriemhild. Gunther claims it was a Saxon ambush but she accuses him of murder by [[envy]] and guilt. She throws the Nibelung's ring onto the ground (Siegfried gave it to her for an engagement ring) and Gunther and Hagen fight over it to Gunther's death. Giselher then tries to kill Hagen but is easily overpowered. A vengeful Brunhild arrives and furiously kills the men who allied themselves with Hagen using the belt that Kriemhild returned to her earlier. Brunhild defeats and beheads Hagen and disappears.  '''''Epilogue'''''  Kriemhild places the ring on Siegfried's hand as they give him a pagan funeral. Giselher wishes the Pagan gods would live again on his death but Lena tells him that the Pagan gods die with him. When the boat has burst into flames Brunhild appears from below Siegfried's altar and kills herself with his sword. She collapses on top of Siegfried's body, and the boat sinks into the river where the treasure hoard is shown having been thrown into the river.

 As he is about to die, Porter's life flashes before him in the form of a [[musical theatre|musical production]] staged by the [[archangel]] [[Gabriel]] in the [[Indiana]] theater where the composer first performed on stage.  He immediately calls to mind the start of his story - the night he met his wife, [[Linda Lee Thomas]] - Paris' latest divorcee and stunning beauty. From the start, they "click" and become a devoted couple. Linda is well aware of Cole's [[homosexual|gay identity]] and activities; her "ex" was the same but violent with her. Cole is completely different, she declares on their wedding day - he loves and adores her and shows it, so she tolerates his dalliances. Her love for and devotion to him are strong enough for her to overlook his romantic flings outside their [[marriage]]. With Linda his fun with music turns into a top international career. Their lavish lifestyle is enviable worldwide. At film's end he tells her the songs were all about her - "not all" she corrects - but enough of them. The leaders in music praise his work and his amazing shows begin. Linda begins a tradition for his show opening nights - a Cartier cigarette case custom designed and engraved to commemorate each show, but almost misses one of his openings herself due to miscarriage and they remain childless.  To cheer Linda, the couple move the showbiz, by invitation, to Hollywood. Great excitement, a new extravagant home, but trouble:  his flings get too overt and indiscreet and it creates tension. Cole is photographed in an amorous embrace with another man in a public [[restroom]] of a gay [[nightclub]], and both he and Linda are blackmailed into paying a heavy settlement to suppress publication of the pictures. When he shrugs off the [[blackmail]], she finally goes to [[Paris]], leaving him bereft.  Not until he is injured in a horseback riding accident that seriously cripples him does she return to his side, willing to forgive but still finding difficulty in coping with his extramarital affairs. Eventually Linda is diagnosed with [[emphysema]], and as she prepares them both for her impending death, she introduces him to her decorator and estate advisor, in an attempt to give Cole a new partner once she's gone. The match is successful.  Linda dies in 1954, and Cole is devastated. But he continues his work until 1958, when degeneration of the bad leg finally requires amputation, affecting his creative output. He never writes again, but works in productions of his earlier works, dying in 1964 at age 73.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  
Dead Friend
 Three high school girls are bored while studying for their test the next day, so they decide to conduct a [[séance]] with a bunshinsaba - a traditional Korean [[ouija board]]. As the spirit is called by Eun-jung ([[Lee Yoon-ji]]), her sister, Eun-seo ([[Jeon Hye-bin]]), wakes up screaming. Eun-seo goes to her sister's room and scolds the girls for doing the séance rather than studying. Before going to sleep, Eun-jung jokingly wishes that the ghost had taken Eun-seo away and that if they do not send the ghost away, it will kill them. The girls are unaware as Eun-seo is killed by a ghostly-water presence in the kitchen.  After a visit to her doctor, the amnesiac Min Ji-won ([[Kim Ha-neul]]), who is an expert swimmer, is told there is a high chance that she may regain her memories back. She tells her former boyfriend, Park Jun-ho ([[Ryu Jin]]), whom she does not remember since her losing her memories, that she will leave college and her mother ([[Kim Hae-sook]]) to go overseas and find a new life. However, Ji-won begins to have nightmares of a ghost from her forgotten past, which seems to be connected to water and which soon manifests itself in reality. She is confronted by an estranged friend, Yu-jung (Jeon Hee-ju), who tells her of Eun-seo's death and that because of Ji-won's action in the past, "Su-in" is coming for them. Yu-jung is soon found dead right after her meeting with Ji-won.  Ji-won slowly remembers that she used to lead an elitist [[clique]] back in high school which consisted of herself, Eun-seo, Yu-jung, and Mi-kyung. Before she became part of the clique, Ji-won was friends with Su-in ([[Nam Sang-mi]]), but her ego turned her to regard the introverted Su-in as a laughing stock while still pretending to be her friend. Ji-won visits her last remaining clique member, Mi-kyung (Shin Yi), who is confined to a mental hospital, but the latter lashes out at Ji-won for bringing Su-in back. Ji-won learns from Su-in's mother ([[Choi Ran]]) that the event that led to her amnesia was a trip to a forest with her clique and Su-in, from which Su-in never came back. She races to save Mi-kyung but is too late to stop her from being drowned to death by the ghost.  Heading to a spring in the forest, Ji-won remembers the full event: Ji-won asks Su-in if she can swim, then pushes her into the spring.  Su-in comes up and all four girls gather and laugh.  The three girls then push Ji-won into the spring as a joke, but upon learning that she could not swim, Su-in dived to save her. While Ji-won was saved, Su-in herself got stuck in the riverbed and drowned.  The other three girls just watch as this happens.  With her body not decomposing due to the chemicals in the water. Ji-won alerts the authorities and informs Su-in's grieving mother of the fact.  Thinking everything have ended, Ji-won returns to her mother, only to realize the horrifying truth: Ji-won and Su-in had swapped bodies during their struggle to get out of the spring. "Ji-won" did not lose her memories because she has never been Ji-won in the first place; she is actually Su-in. Ji-won's spirit has been terrorizing her and the clique to regain her body back, and now she inhabits her mother. Her mother then starts to vomit up water and collapses and everything seems to end.  But then Ji-won crawls from the water to get her body back.  Su-in manages to grab a broken vase to and uses it to cut her wrist so Ji-won can't have it.  Ji-won's boyfriend, Jun-ho, hears Ji-won scream and comes in to save Ji-won and her mother.  They are then rushed to the hospital. Su-in is later seen walking through the fish market where her mother, who believes her daughter had died, works. She leaves the market after hesitating for a while, while her mother looks ominously at her, with Ji-wom's tell-tale smirk, implying that Ji-won is still attempting to regain her body by possessing Su-in's mother.

Dead Man's Shoes (2004 film)
 The story details the return of Richard to his home town of [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]], [[Derbyshire]] in the [[Peak District]], England, after serving as a [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|paratrooper]] in the [[British Army]]. Richard and his younger, mentally-impaired brother Anthony, camp at an abandoned farm near the town. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] reveal Anthony's abuse by a group of drug dealers in the town; Richard vows to take revenge.  Richard puts on a mask and has a verbal confrontation with Herbie, one of the abusers, who does not recognise him at first. Later, Herbie and friends Soz and Tuff are in a flat taking drugs. He tells them about the confrontation, and states he thinks the man might be Anthony's brother, who has been away serving in the army. When Herbie leaves he sees a man in a military gas mask banging on the front door of the block. Soz and Tuff run outside but the man is nowhere to be seen. When they go back into their flat they discover Richard has ransacked it, stolen the drugs and spray painted the words "[[Cheyne-Stokes respiration|Cheyne Stoking]]", a pun on the scientific name for the pattern of breathing a human being goes into when they are dying.  The next day the thugs visit Sonny, the de facto leader of the gang, to explain where the drugs went. When they meet, Sonny has had his face painted but doesn't realise. The other gang members arrive during this time and they have had their hair and clothes painted as well. They all suspect one another of playing games until Herbie states that the man he saw in the pool hall is Richard, Anthony's brother. All of the gang become silent as they realise that Richard is back in town.  The men encounter Richard while driving in their [[Citroën 2CV]]. He makes it clear that he is not scared of any of them and invites them to come and find him at the old farm where he is staying. The gang leaves with Sonny visibly concerned at Richard's apparent lack of fear. That evening, while the gang are hiding out and playing cards, Sonny decides that they should shoot Richard. When one of the members leave, Richard (having snuck into the house) brutally kills him with an axe, using the dead man's blood to smear the words "One Down" on the wall.  The next morning, they take their car and go to the farm where Richard is staying with Anthony. Sending in Big Al (one of their members) to draw Richard out, Sonny prepares to shoot him with a rifle and their only round. However, he misses and kills Al. With no rounds remaining in the rifle they retreat and return to town, while Richard smiles.  The surviving members stop at a local petrol station where the car breaks down and Tuff runs off, scared of Richard's revenge. Later at Sonny's house, they arm themselves and search the place, expecting Richard to be there. They do not find him, although he is hiding in the kitchen pantry. While they are upstairs Richard laces their kettle with a cocktail of the drugs he took from the gang earlier in the film. The three men become completely intoxicated a few hours later and Richard reappears to kill them one by one. He toys with them, dancing and joking. He shoots Sonny in the head, and kills Soz with an upward palm strike. He then sits down Herbie and brings out a suitcase, which has Tuff's corpse inside. Richard then tells him he is a good man and will let him live if he tells him where the final gang member is as he left the gang years before. He tells him without hesitation and Richard hugs him. But he finds Herbie's knife and asks him if it was to be used on him. Herbie lies at first then tells the truth, but Richard stabs him regardless. Richard leaves right after.   The next day, Richard arrives in a nearby town where the final gang member, Mark, lives with his wife and two boys. He talks with the children's mother and asks her to let her husband know that he is Richard, Anthony's brother. When Mark returns home, she explains the conversation to her husband. Terrified, he tells her how the gang abused Anthony. The abuse culminated with them pretending to hang him at a local ruined castle whilst he was high on acid. This final episode of abuse culminates with Anthony actually hanging himself after his 'friends' run off. It then becomes clear that Richard has been alone the whole time, and talking to a vision of his dead brother.  The next morning, Richard sneaks into Mark's house and takes him hostage using a knife. He makes him drive to the same ruined building where Anthony hanged himself and demands he tell him his part in what happened. Mark explains how his fault was in not stopping the abuse. Richard confesses to his crimes against the other men. He tells Mark how he now feels like the monster and that he simply wants to lie down with his brother. Richard gives the knife to Mark and demands that he kill him lest he continue his monstrous ways. Mark refuses but Richard clasps his hands and pulls them towards him. Mark eventually stabs and kills Richard, then stumbles away.  
Dead Leaves
 Retro and Pandy, two unlikely renegades, awaken naked on Earth with no recollection of their past, but with superior physical abilities. After embarking on a brief but devastating crime spree for food, clothing and transportation in downtown Tokyo, they are captured by authorities and sent to the infamous prison called Dead Leaves, on the half-destroyed Moon.   Once incarcerated, Retro and Pandy are subjected to the activities taking place inside the prison facility, such as forced labor, straitjackets and mandatory [[defecation]]. During one such time, Retro meets Chinko, an inmate with a drill for a penis. 666 and 777, the super-powered prison guards, demonstrate their power when 777 flicks an inmate in the face, killing him along with everybody else behind him.  Back in their cell, Retro and Pandy orchestrate a mass prison break and discover the secret work being carried out at the facility. Over the course of the film, it is discovered that Pandy and Retro were spies working at the facility and the crazed warden is trying to get revenge on Pandy by re-creating a deranged fairy tale she remembers from her childhood.  In the finale, Pandy has Retro's child, who comes out with twin machine guns and blows the warden away. A giant caterpillar (part of the demented fairy tale) begins consuming the station until the mutant baby sacrifices himself so that his two parents can live. The film ends with Pandy and Retro crashing in the middle of Earth's [[dystopian]] metropolis in their escape pod, crushing a previously-victimized bystander and presumably restarting the events from the beginning of the film.  
Dear Frankie
 Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer) and nine-year-old [[deafness|deaf]] son Frankie (Jack McElhone) frequently relocate to keep one step ahead of her abusive ex-husband and his family. They are accompanied by her opinionated, chain-smoking mother Nell. Newly relocated in the [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[Greenock]], Lizzie accepts a job at the local [[fish and chips]] shop owned by a friendly woman named Marie, and enrolls Frankie in school.  Through a [[Glasgow]] post office box, Frankie maintains a regular correspondence with someone he believes to be his father, Davey, who allegedly is a [[Merchant shipping|merchant seaman]] working on the HMS ''Accra''. In reality, the letters he receives are written by his mother, who prefers maintaining this charade instead of telling the boy the reason she fled her marriage.  When she learns that the ''Accra'' will soon be arriving at the docks at Greenock, Lizzie in a panic concocts a scheme to hire a man to impersonate Davey. When her effort to find someone at the local pub fails, she enlists Marie's assistance. Marie arranges for her to meet an acquaintance who coincidentally is passing through town at the same time the ''Accra'' will be in port. When Lizzie and the stranger (Gerard Butler) meet, he doesn't tell her his name. Lizzie explains the situation and gives him the letters to provide some background. He agrees to spend a day with Frankie in exchange for the meager payment Lizzie can offer him.  When the stranger arrives at their home to pick up the boy, he brings with him a book about marine life (to Lizzie's surprise), one of Frankie's passions, and a bond is forged immediately. The two spend a day together (with Lizzie secretly following them), collecting on Frankie's bet at a soccer match from a school mate, ordering chips, and later in the evening setting up another half day visit.  The second day is magical, ending with a nice evening at a dance, as Frankie wins another bet by getting Lizzie and the stranger to dance together. Afterwards, they walk together to get around the "discuss no past" ground rules, and Lizzie tells the stranger about Frankie's deafness—a "present from his daddy"—and her reason for leaving her husband. She explains that the letters from Frankie are so important to her because this is how she "hears" her son. The stranger tells her she is a great mother for protecting Frankie. Returning home, Frankie gives the stranger a hand-carved wooden seahorse as a parting gift. At the door, after a long pause together, Lizzie and the stranger kiss each other goodbye. After he leaves, Lizzie discovers he has returned her payment to him, stuffed into her coat pocket.  Sometime later, Lizzie learns that her husband is terminally ill, and reluctantly visits the hospital without Frankie. She experiences her husband's angry fury again, when he demands to see Frankie. Later when she tells Frankie that his dad is really sick, he writes him a note and draws him a picture. On a second visit, Lizzie delivers them to her husband, along with a snapshot of Frankie. Davey's death brings peace to them all.  Lizzie asks Marie about the stranger and she learns he is Marie's brother. Frankie's last letter shows that he has known the truth for a while—that the stranger was not his real dad. He knows too that Lizzie is sad, but she has him for support. The letter also indicates that Frankie intends to carry on with his life, telling about his real dad passing, his friends and their gold stars in school, and getting onto the reserve [[football]] team. He closes the letter by saying he hopes the stranger will visit again.  Lizzie finds Frankie sitting at end of a pier, and they enjoy a quiet moment together, looking out to sea.  
Dear Wendy
  The teenage members of a group of self-proclaimed [[pacifist]]s decide to carry guns. They call themselves [[Dandy|The Dandies]]. Their club is assembled from the young misfits in a fictional small American mining town, Electric Park. It is started after the main character, Dick (Jamie Bell), buys what he thinks is a toy gun. His co-worker tells him the gun is real, and the two start shooting and studying guns in their spare time. They later recruit other outcasts, young men and one young woman who do not, or cannot, work in the mine, including one boy in leg braces and his younger brother Freddie.  The film is framed by Dick's voiceover, resembling a love letter to his gun Wendy. He is the chosen leader of the group and tells them that their group is a "social experiment" and will reveal their true nature.  The script shares characteristics with earlier von Trier scripts, depicting violence and race relations in the United States in a highly stylized, exaggerated manner and mixing realistic and fantastic elements.  Though more substantial than the bare sound stage of ''Dogville'', Electric Park is reminiscent of a western set on the back lot of a movie studio. The Dandies spend most of their time on this one block or in an abandoned mining shaft that they decorate and call the Temple.  The Dandies have several quirks and idiosyncratic rules. A Dandy may never brandish his weapon in public, but instead gains self-confidence simply knowing he is carrying a concealed weapon. As a badge of membership, they cultivate a 'Brideshead Stutter' (a reference to the character [[Anthony Blanche]] in ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', who also adopts a deliberate stammer). They refuse to say the word 'killing' and instead refer to it as 'loving.' They live up to their name, [[dandy|Dandies]], by dressing in colorful, outdated clothing, including vests, long jackets and hats. Though they regularly shoot targets (bull's eyes are oddly common), they spend just as much time playing gun-related games, watching instructional videos and studying diagrams. They use their own personal guns, all antiques with names and back stories, more as props than weapons. Even when they do load and shoot their weapons, they favor style over function (for example, Dick decides to shoot from the hip, Susan uses two guns and works on indirect hits using ricocheted bullets).  Most of the characters in the film are white, save for two: Clarabelle, Dick's loving childhood nanny, and her grandson Sebastian. Sebastian shows up at Dick's house one day with the town sheriff (Bill Pullman). He has been put on probation for a weapons-related crime (he says he "blew a guy away") and has to regularly check in with Dick, whom the sheriff judges to be a good role model. The irony being that Dick and the Dandies spend all of their time using guns. Dick allows Sebastian to break probation and asks him to join the Dandies (Dick sees it as a bit of a ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]''), but only if he does everything on their terms.  One day, Sebastian gives them a suspicious box full of guns, and soon breaks a club rule by firing another member's gun. Dick complains that Sebastian is "ruining it for everyone." The group's sole female member, Susan (Alison Pill), takes a shine to Sebastian and this threatens Dick. Freddie suggests that she likes "big schlongs". Like Dick, she lost a parent early on in the film though it doesn't seem to disturb her. Most of the film plays out like a child's game of cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians, and most of the non-Dandies portrayed are police officers and faceless miners.  Sebastian's natural manner is in stark contrast to the affectations of the Dandies, especially the awkward poetry of Dick's voiceover. He speaks like a regular teenager and seems out of place in the one-block world of Electric Park. He points out their oddities, including their strange clothing. He is an outsider among outsiders, but still enlisted in the group.  Sebastian tells Dick that he and his friends carry guns because they're scared, that everyone is scared. He tells them that his grandmother, Dick's former nanny, is too scared of "the gangs" to even leave her home (these vague, mysterious "gangs" had already been mentioned by Dick's boss at Salomon's grocery store, who was terrified of them to the point of a nervous breakdown). Like a good [[Boy Scout]], Dick devises a sort of war plan for assisting Clarabelle on her yearly visit to her cousin's. He believes it is the "decent American" thing to do.  The Dandies accompany Clarabelle on her walk, but she becomes panicked when they encounter a deputy sheriff. There is a scuffle, he tries to help out and the old lady ends up shooting the deputy.  The sheriff asks the Dandies to hand over Clarabelle, even telling them they can keep their guns if they do so. He tells the boys that they are what the country is made of. The Dandies notice his automatic gun, which Dick calls "treacherous," and sense that they are being set up just as several other police officers appear. The Dandies flee to the Temple to hide.  Now outlaws, the Dandies decide to take Clarabelle to her cousin's once and for all. Their decision is based more on principle than practicality, and it is clear that they are willing to martyr themselves. They treat it as a suicide mission, cutting themselves ceremonially and donning their fanciest clothes. Sebastian discovers Dick's now-finished letter to Wendy, which ends with the coded threat: "And now, it's the time of the season for loving" ("loving" is Dandy code for killing).  They head outside one by one, armed, to face the team of [[shotgun]]-toting police officers assembled by a legion of squad cars. The first to go, Huey (Chris Owen), tells them "We're not interested in shooting anybody, so don't make us." The Marshall arrives and tells Huey to "Drop the pathetic gun right this minute." He is promptly shot by Huey, who smiles and announces "Officer d-d-down I'm afraid!" before hobbling into gunfire. Huey discovers that he can walk fine without his crutches just as he's gunned down. Meanwhile, a bullet ricochets and hits Clarabelle in the leg as the Dandies continue attempting to escort her to her cousin's house (like all the film's location, it is located within a one-block radius).  Dick realizes that there is a [[sniper]] in their midst and sets on shooting the offender down. Susan is the next to shoot, using both of her guns and her carefully honed ricochet method. All the while, white lines and numbers on the screen graphically depicting the trajectories of the Dandies' shots. Susan is shot in the head. Stevie and his gun Badsteel come to her defense and he is shot in the heart.  Sebastian asks Dick "What happened?" and a series of morgue photographs flash across the screen. Only Sebastian, Dick and Freddie remain. The three attempt to drag Clarabelle to safety. Freddie is the next to go. He has tied a cord around his testicles, a tactic with roots in Native American history that he championed earlier on, and grabs his crotch before getting up and firing. He is quickly shot down, rises, then is shot several more times.  Clarabelle stirs and Dick is hit as he comes to her aid, though he manages to get her all the way to her cousin's house. While he is inside, police officers are scanning the windows and lining him up in their guns' sights.  Sebastian remains outside, unharmed and hidden by the door of a police car. He sees Dick's gun, the one he called Wendy, lying in the street and recalls a line of Dick's letter: "Dear Wendy, I always dreamed that if someone were to make that final exit wound in me, it should be you. My saviour." He grabs the gun and then runs inside the home of his grandmother's cousin. He goes upstairs and shoots Dick in the back, mouthing "Dick, [unknown]?"  Dick resembles a pilgrim as he turns around in his buckle hat. His life, at least that which was contained by the film, flashes before his eyes. He examines the exit wound and whispers "Wendy". The police on the roof across the street shoot up the windows and, mostly likely, Sebastian.  All the while, the "[[Battle Hymn of the Republic]]" plays in the background.  The film features many tracks by the 1960s pop-rock band [[The Zombies]], including "[[She's Not There]]", "[[Time of the Season]]". Dick's final words to Wendy in his letter, "it's the time of the season for loving" is a quote from the latter song.  
The Death of Poe
 After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a [[hallucination]] where he is [[premature burial|buried alive]].  He prepares to take a trip to [[New York City]] via a ferry steamboat from [[Richmond, Virginia]], to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine ''[[The Stylus]]''.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.   Poe is depicted as having some type of [[memory loss]], which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local [[tavern]] rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at [[West Point]].  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised $1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his [[Prospectus (book)|prospectus]] for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the $1,000 he had collected.  An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a [[cooping]] ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.  A couple of victims of the [[scam]] die amidst the brutality of their captors.  Afterwards, Poe is released and he eventually collapses in the street and is found by a local tavern owner.  The man calls for Poe's uncle Henry Herring and Dr. Joseph Snodgrass.  The men discuss what to do with the incoherent, half-conscious Poe.  Snodgrass assumes he is drunk and suggests they let him sleep it off - a theory the film seems to dispute by showing him early in the film declining offered [[alcohol]] several times.  Herring becomes more concerned and demands Poe be taken to Washington College Hospital, despite the expense.  At the hospital, Dr. John Moran tends to Poe, unable to accurately determine his situation or the cause of his failing health, or how he received his injuries.  He muses to his wife, Mrs. Moran, that he does not want to be known as the physician who killed Edgar Allan Poe.  Over the next three days, the bedridden Poe is kept in seclusion in a private room as Moran denies Poe visitors, including his Baltimore cousin Nielson Poe, who becomes convinced that his cousin is about to die.  Poe ultimately does die after one final hallucination or perhaps a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] where he sees his dead wife [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]].

Decoys (film)
 A jock sneaks into his supposed girlfriend's house with flowers for her. It is cold inside and when he approaches his girlfriend's room he finds a dead man with his mouth wide open. He then spots two more corpses.  Elsewhere, Luke Callahan and Roger, two college freshmen and [[virgin]]s, are desperate to get laid. While doing their laundry after drinking too much beer, Luke meets two seductive girls named Lily and Constance. When Lily deliberately leaves a roll of quarters in the laundry, an inebriated and horny Luke goes to return them to her. He finds her room is unlocked and he decides to sneak in, finding that it is very cold inside. But when the girls suddenly return, he decides to hide in the closet. Luke watches as the girls open the windows and let the cold winter air surround them, seemingly arousing and comforting them as they strip naked, much to Luke's amusement. He then watches in horror and confusion as reptilian [[tentacle]]s unfold from their chests and sexually arouse them while Constance sprays Lilly down with a can of [[liquid nitrogen]].  The police have found the body of a young man named Bobby from the college, frozen from the inside out and his mouth wide open with a look of terror on his face. He oddly also has a noticeable [[erection]]. The [[forensic scientist]]s assume a "[[keg drinking tube]]" was shoved down his throat, not realizing it was actually Lily, who shoved her alien tentacle down his throat. Luke, with his girlfriend Alex, decide to try to find out what these aliens are and if needed, exterminate them.   Luke and Roger's friend Gibby wanders into a cemetery with his girlfriend Natasha. They enter a [[mausoleum]] and begin to have sex on a cement slab. As Gibby ejaculates, Natasha reveals that she is an alien as her tentacles emerge from her chest and immobilize Gibby as a toothy [[ovipositor]] tentacle unfolds and is shoved down his throat as part of the alien mating process. After completing the mating process, Gibby freezes solid and dies, and thus does not survive the mating process, much to Natasha's disappointment.     Luke invites Lily to his room and they begin to have sex. Luke had placed a camera in the room to attempt to capture strange activity, but the camera malfunctions and fails to capture anything suspicious. Lily attempts to mate with Luke and her tentacles appear, but the tentacles knock over a candle, which causes her dress to catch fire. Lily sheds her human form and Luke then gets a good look of what the aliens look like in their true form; humanoid reptilians. Lily escapes, but there is no evidence of her in her true form.        Constance explains to Roger that the aliens have come to Earth to [[impregnate]] men, as their race is dying out. To save their people, the aliens persuade men to come with them, promising sex. However, the "mating" process involves sticking their tentacles down the male's throat. Most men die because they cannot survive the cold temperature. Roger allows Constance to "mate" with him after she explains everything as she has fallen in love with him when she wasn't supposed to. She explains that they're merely trying to survive and that they don't want anyone to die. He agrees to allow her to impregnate him, giving her race a chance to survive. Luke comes in just in time to see a baby alien crawl out of Roger's mouth. Roger dies soon after, leaving Constance horrified because she didn't want him to die.   Luke has discovered that, while the aliens love the cold, they hate heat. Luke has also discovered that Gibby is dead at this point having been frozen by Natasha. Luke teams up with Detective Amanda (his former girlfriend) and obtains a home-made [[flamethrower]] and is determined to put an end to the aliens' terror. Luke confronts the aliens and kills Natasha and Lily by burning them, not realizing the truth of their mission. He then confronts Constance, but the flamethrower runs out of [[propane]]. Using an ax, Luke breaks open high pressure pipes and kills Constance with steam. Luke now has solid evidence of the aliens' existence as there were witnesses who saw them in their true form. Afterwards, Alex congratulates Luke and they start to have sex. There's a sudden flashback to the very beginning of the movie when the jock finds the dead men. He looks up and sees Alex who then says "You're early". Suddenly Luke realizes Alex is an alien. He screams as she pins him down and her tentacles appear. The camera zooms out of the room as Luke's screams fade away as Alex presumably rapes him to death.  
The Defender (2004 film)
 The global war on terror rages on. The United States will not give an inch against terrorists, especially Mohamed Jamar (Geoffrey Burton), who is considered to be the worst of them all. Jamar has been missing for months, but his network continues its functions.   The President ([[Jerry Springer]]) stands firm before the world, but behind the scenes, his teams are working to find the final solution. Jamar represents a paradox: he can never be killed, because if he was found dead, he would become an instant martyr.  If caught he must be tried. If he is found guilty he would become a martyr and further inspiration to acts of terror. If acquitted, the policies of the entire western world would be destroyed. So he must remain invisible.  Roberta Jones ([[Caroline Lee-Johnson|Caroline Lee Johnson]]), the head of the [[National Security Agency]], is working to ensure he remains invisible, forever. Under the guise of attending an Eastern European conference on Terror in Romania, she attends a secret meeting with Jamar at a secluded hotel outside Bucharest.   No one knows about this meeting, and her goal is to buy his invisibility. Her only companions are her security team of six, headed by her personal bodyguard, Lance Rockford ([[Dolph Lundgren]]). They are the best of the best, former military special forces personnel capable of anything.   When they arrive at the hotel for the secret meeting, they are ambushed. No one is supposed to know about the meeting, but someone wants it stopped. They have to fight for their lives against an unknown attacker.  Lance, a man of highest integrity with an impressive record of service for his country, is forced into a situation which challenges his very beliefs. Throughout the crisis, it is revealed that Jamar and his loyal bodyguard were actually undercover agents from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[MI5]] who have uncovered evidence against high-ranking military officials involved in a conspiracy to topple the President to continue [[war profiteering]], and Rockford's trusted agent, Kaye ([[Shakara Ledard]]) was the mole involved in the conspiracy. With all of the members of the team, as well as the undercover agents dead, a wounded Lance kills Kaye with a thrown combat knife. The conspiracy is toppled by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] as well as [[military police]], while Lance voluntarily leaves his bodyguard duties.  
Deewaar (2004 film)
  Indian Army Major Ranvir Kaul and some 30 of his colleagues were captured in Pakistan and held under brutal conditions for 33 years. Kaul attempts another escape but is caught, beaten, berated and thrown back in prison. During the fracas one of his men does flee and through a sympathetic friend, Jabbar, sends a letter home. Kaul's wife and son petition the Indian Army but the General, though sympathetic, has his hands tied. He raises the subject and Pakistan will deny it and immediately the men will be shot; he cannot authorize Army action absent hard evidence (not just a letter); there are no other options. Kaul's son, Gaurav, sets off to find his father.  Gaurav meets Jabbar and discovers that his father has been transferred to a different prison camp, Saran Jail under the cunning and sadistic Sohail. Kaul meets another set of captured Indian POWs at this new prison. Kaul attempts another escape. One man sacrifices himself on the electric fence as others go through. Sohail bemusedly sighs as the others, once past the fence, are blown up by the landmines. Kaul and the remaining prisoners are again beaten and kicked back into their barracks. One of the prisoners, Khan, manages to evade the landmines and escapes. Gaurav brings him to safety.  Gaurav attacks a military courier and, using his uniforms, infiltrates a Pakistan Army office block. He steals a set of plans which reveal a water main under the prison. His father and the men can dig their way to this main and crawl out. With great reluctance Khan gets arrested again. Sohail correctly guesses that Khan is back for a reason. Khan discloses to Kaul that his son is here; this news, and the water main, is a great inspiration for the men.  The men quietly begin digging a tunnel to the water main. They discover the body of an Indian Army Captain Jatin in the debris under the prison, but this Jatin is among them! Khan and Kaul discover that he is in fact a Pakistani spy. Gaurav and Khan had planned the escape for the night of the tenth and Jatin, the spy, had dutifully reported this back to Sohail. Kaul and Khan decide that the escape will happen on the ninth. Jatin is not told of this but the men manage to send a coded message to Gaurav. The following day Khan notices the number 9 scrawled on an army supply truck entering the prison: it is Gaurav’s reply. He will await the men near the water main outlet on the ninth.  On the night of the escape the men overpower the guards and kill Jatin. They enter the water main and begin digging away the last few meters of remaining debris. The knocking in the pipes travels up to Sohail’s kitchen sink; Sohail quickly discovers the escape and hotly pursues the men down the pipe. Gaurav digs from the other side and, just in the nick of time, the debris is cleared and father and son are reunited. The men make it through. One of them sacrifices himself on a land mine inside the water main which caves in and blocks Sohail.  Gaurav leads his father and the men to a railway line but the train is delayed. The men split up to avoid detection and arrange to meet at dawn near a border point. They arrive at the border point but Sohail and his men are in close pursuit. There is a firefight. Khan puts up a brave fight but is shot down. Ranvir Kaul and Gaurav and the handful of remaining prisoners finally get across the border in a Pakistan army truck. Sohail is right behind them but his jeep is disarmed and he is surrounded by Kaul and the prisoners. Kaul points to the border line behind them; they are now on Indian soil. Kaul, now an Indian Army soldier, attacks and kills Sohail in hand-to-hand combat, and throws his body across the border.  The film ends as Ranvir Kaul and his men are reinstated in the Indian Army and salute the Indian tricolor.  <ref></ref>

 The film begins with Ed ([[Ben Anderson (actor)|Ben Anderson]]) shopping in the supermarket with his wife, Gina (Kate Gorman). Ed searches the shelves for [[dental floss]], but can't find any. Both Gina and a supermarket employee seem to have never heard of it before: "You mean, toothpicks?"  Ed asks his friends, his dentist, Google, and even the local radio station, all of them confused as to the origin of the product and as to why toothpicks would not suffice.  Finally, Ed proposes the idea of dental floss to [[Oral-B]]. The CEO rejects it, saying "The wheel's already been invented, mate!" The CEO too, has never heard of it. In desperation, Ed purchases some candles, which he begins to strip down in order to use the wax-covered string inside as dental floss. Gina, sensing his maddening fight with this problem, convinces Ed to move on.  As she does this, however, she is searching frantically through her bag to find her [[tampon]]s. Confused, Ed asks, "What the hell are tampons?"

Dev (film)
 Joint Commissioner of Police Dev Pratap Singh, a duty-bound, self-righteous officer, and Special Commissioner Tejinder Khosla, the balancing force between the political interests of Chief Minister Bhandarker and Dev's commitment to the law, are lifelong friends, each with his own ideals. Farhaan, a law graduate, was brought up with ideals of non-violence and patriotism. Dev unwittingly gives Farhaan the wound that plunges him into rage and violence after witnessing the death of his father during a peace demonstration. Taking advantage of the situation, corrupt politician Latif sets the vulnerable young man on a path of violence and destruction that threatens to ignite the city. Aaliya is the light in Farhaan's life. Beautiful and innocent, the young woman also gets caught in extraordinary circumstances that transform her life and she dares to stand up for the truth. Dev is the saga of Dev and Tej's friendship, a bond stronger than blood ties in which Farhaan emerges as the wedge driving them apart. The story unfolds against the vitiated atmosphere of present times where innocent lives become fodder for political expediency. The spark of terrorist violence unknowingly set off by Farhaan under the aegis of the corrupt politician Latif engulfs the whole city in its flames. Tej transgresses beyond the boundaries of law in his passion to eliminate anti-national crime. Dev is faced with the spectre of the tragic human cost and a moral compulsion to act. The stakes rise beyond self-interest. Dev and Tej are set on a path of dramatic collision. Even as Dev and Farhaan's fate gets irreversibly linked, two soldiers whose allegiance may be to different causes but admiration for each other's courage and integrity brings them together.  On a train bound for Bombay from Surat, a Police Inspector questions a young man named Farhaan, who has just obtained his law degree, for his reason to go to Bombay, and whether he has any alliance with Pakistanis. Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He comes to know that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes a wave of riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer. But will Dev trust a man who just attempted to kill him? And will Latif and Mangal Rao join forces to eliminate Farhaan, who now has become a liability to both sides.

On the day of the theft, Kid appears at the theatre disguised up as Shinichi Kudo but ends up fleeing in the end without the jewel. To thank them, Julie invites Kogoro and everyone to [[Hakodate]], and they all travel on an airplane to get there. In the air, one of the show actor, Shinjo, who was supposed to be elsewhere and Ran's mother, Eri, joins them on the plane. As the plane takes off, Julie comes in physical contact with most of the individuals she invited, making them all suspects in the case of her death. The case was solved by Eri and the culprit was later found to be the makeup artist, Natsuki.  The captains were also poisoned from Julie and were not able to pilot the plane, so Shinjo agrees to take over because he supposedly "took courses", and appoints Conan to assist him. Conan figures out that Shinjo is Kaito Kid when Conan is asked to assist, as this logic would not apply in a similar situation. Kid tells Conan that he is no longer interested in the sapphire as he discovered that it was a fake. The storm and fire at the airport make it impossible to land while the plane fuel is running low. Conan picks a stable area that can support a commercial plane. Ran Mori and Sonoko Suzuki eventually take over piloting the plane while Kid escapes by jumping off the plane and Conan has to "go to the bathroom." Conan then switches over to Shinichi's voice and guides Ran for landing the plane. During the flight, Ran mentions how Shinichi is like an eclipse; one moment he's there, the other he's not. When the plane lands, Ran tells Shinichi that she loves him, but ends the moment by telling him that she suddenly sees lights at the site.  It turns out that Kid went near a police station and used police cars (because this policeman is obsessed with catching him) as guiding lights to land the plane. After the plane safely lands, the criminal is apprehended and Ran and Sonoko are treated by a medic. The medic reveals himself to be Kaito Kid, who commends Ran for landing the plane safely. He tells her they will meet again before suddenly vanishing. All went well, and the movie ends with Ran talking to Shinichi over the phone again arguing about silly things, thinking that it was Kid who guided her to land the plane, and is relieved that her secret isn't out.  
The Deviants (film)
 Norm ([[Doug Dezzani]]) the matchmaker at Hopeless Romantics can find surprising love matches for anyone, no matter how strange their behavior. However, when Norm hires sassy protégé Monique ([[Tamara Curry]]) and tries to teach her the tricks of the trade, they encounter the wildest clients he's ever had, some of whom are:  * Marina ([[Tiffany Shepis]]), a female [[Nudism|nudist]] who seeks someone who will share her views on [[Nudity and sexuality#Social nudity and sexuality|social nudity and sexuality]]. That is, someone who will see her constant nakedness in appreciation of the human body rather than an invitation for sex. * Norm himself, who always feels incomplete in sex due to his failure to experience simultaneous orgasms with his female partner. * Cecilia ([[Angel Boris]]), a [[Hypersexuality|hypersexual]] woman who can't talk to men in private without immediately [[Non statutory female on male rape|raping them]] at gunpoint and/or by knocking them out (see [[somnophilia]]). She does the latter to Norm himself when she first presents her problem to him in his private office, and the former to Monique's former boyfriend (in a date which Norm later arranged for them). * A house cleaner, who is aroused by [[pubic hair]]. Therefore, she either collects it from her clients' houses or sneaks up on her male clients and plucks their pubic hair directly. * A man who is aroused by cats. * A bodybuilder who feels his [[penis]] is too small. * A woman who can only reach orgasm while standing upside down on her head. * Chad ([[Brad Yoder (actor)|Brad Yoder]]), a [[pool guy]] who can't help peeing into his clients' swimming pools for arousal. * Ivan ([[Christopher Bradley]]), a "handicapped" [[gay]] man who uses his wheelchair as an excuse to stare at people's crotches. He's unable to do so directly, as he feels unwanted in the gay community due to his older age.  Somehow, Norm and Monique find the right match for each of their clients as well as for themselves, thus ending the movie on the positive note that there's a right match out there for everybody.

Jassi and Gursharan get married as Jassi has no other relatives. When the police find a duffel bag of automatic weapons in Soman's house, they immediately arrest Gursharan and beat him up severely, even though he claims his innocence, alleging that real terrorists had forced themselves upon the family at gun-point.

Devilman
 Akira Fudo is a timid teenage boy who lives with Miki Makimura and her family after his parents died on a trip to the [[Arctic]]. One day, Akira's best friend, Ryo Asuka, asks for help when his archaeologist father died after uncovering a mask during an excavation of the ruins of an ancient temple from the Maya civilization, confirming the existence of [[demon]]s (prehistoric apex predators which have the ability to possess other lifeforms, including other demons, in order to evolve). This mask turns out to be a fossilized demon skull, which upon putting it on, shows the wearer what the world was like millions of years ago when demons ruled the Earth. Ryo's plan is to prevent the revival of demons: "To fight a demon, one must become a demon."  Ryo believes that people like Akira with a pure heart may be able to harness a demon's powers when possessed and Akira agrees to help after they encounter demons in Ryo's house. Ryo takes his friend to a nightclub in his father’s basement then picks a fight and draws blood to attract demonic attention.  Demons begin to possess the clubbers and threaten Ryo and Akira, until a demon known as Amon – the Lord of War, also called the Beast of Hell – attempts to possess Akira. However, Akira manages to gain the upper hand of the possession and transforms into Devilman. Devilman retains the raw power and instincts of the demon Amon, as well as the mind and conscience of Akira, giving Akira virtually complete control.  Akira also inherits some of Amon's bravery, pride, and rage. He becomes very aggressive as well as more confident and courageous, and no longer lets anyone push him around. Throughout the series, Devilman has many battles with the demon hordes, encountering foes such as Sirène the demon bird, the water demon Geruma, and a large turtle-like demon called Jinmen.  Eventually, the demons start a [[world war]] with humanity causing paranoia and fear to spread rapidly around the entire planet. Mankind is unable to fight sufficiently. Akira starts to gather all of the world's Devilman in order to make a counterattack against the demons. Ryo reveals to Akira that he is actually [[Satan]] in disguise. He tells Akira that he only pretended to be a human in order to learn the weaknesses of men. Ryo then feeds the paranoia of demons through lies to the population and reveals to the public that Akira is a devilman. Miki's parents are soon arrested by the government and tortured due to their association with Akira while Miki and her brother are brutally murdered by a paranoid mob. Akira slaughters their killers in retribution. With no one left to protect, Akira enters the final battle against Satan, who reveals that he has fallen in love with Akira during his years as a human. 20 years later, humanity is extinct, the demons and Devilman being the only beings left on a barren Earth. The final battle between Devilman and Satan and his armies ensues.  At the war's end, Satan reveals to Akira the truth behind his reason for defying God: even though God unintentionally created demons, He wished to destroy them. Satan was appalled at this, believing demons still had a right to live. He convinced them to enter a state of [[hibernation]] in the ice, to conserve their strength for the final battle with God. Upon awakening, Satan discovered the beautiful planet they fought for had been ruined by the human race. Enraged at this damage, Satan led the demons in a war to exterminate humanity. While Satan explains this to Akira, he also realizes that in the end, he and the demons were no better than God. He begs Akira to forgive him. At this point, it is revealed that Satan has actually been addressing Akira's corpse. Satan had won the final battle against Devilman and realized he accidentally killed him. The series ends with Satan and the demons triumphant, however Satan is shown looking sad and forlorn. Finally, as the Sun rises an army of [[angel]]s appear in the distance, ready to destroy the remains of Satan's army as Satan weeps for the death of his friend and the love of his life.

Shagun's mother requests Shagun to talk to Nikhil for one last time and listen his side of story as well. A.R. Rehman believing Sarah to be the reason of Nikhil's agony tries to fix him up with Sarah, who has apparently returned after realizing that her boyfriend was a fraud. She hugs him and again, Shagun, who has come to talk to Nikhil, sees them and goes berserk.  After hearing the whole story from Nikhil, A.R. Rehman arranges a party at a yacht; all the girls attend.

A Dirty Shame
 The people of [[Harford Road]] are firmly divided into two camps: neuters, the [[puritan]]ical residents who despise anything even remotely carnal; and the perverts, a group of [[Sexual addiction|sex addicts]] whose unique [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]es have all been brought to the fore by accidental [[concussion]]s.

Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights
 In 1958, Katey Miller ([[Romola Garai]]), her parents ([[Sela Ward]] and [[John Slattery]]), and her younger sister Susie ([[Mika Boorem]]) arrive in Cuba during the [[Cuban revolution]]. A self-described bookworm, Katey is not very happy about having to move to a different country during her senior year of high school, as she had been planning to attend [[Radcliffe College]], although the rest of her family seem extremely pleased to be in Cuba.  Meeting several other rich American teenagers down by the pool - including James Phelps ([[Jonathan Jackson (actor)|Jonathan Jackson]]), the son of her father's boss -, Katey becomes disgusted when one of the teenagers insults a local waiter when he accidentally knocks over some of their drinks. Katey attempts to talk to the waiter—Javier ([[Diego Luna]]), who works at the hotel to support his family—because she feels awful about what had occurred, but he is not interested.  Katey watches a film of her mother and father dancing and wishes she could dance as well as they did. She and her father dance a bit. The next day in class, Katey is asked to read aloud from ''[[The Odyssey]]'' - a passage about love and passion. After class, James invites her to a party at the country club the next day and she accepts.  While walking home from school, she sees Javier dancing at a street party, and he offers to walk her home. They stop to listen to a street band and police show up, stopping Javier while Katey runs away.  The next day, Katey tries some of the dance moves she saw. Javier sees her and asks her to come see the real dancers Saturday night, but she says she is already going to the country club. Javier gets upset and leaves. Katey wears one of her maid's dresses to the country club party and impresses James. Katey convinces him to take her to the Cuban club where Javier is dancing with the ladies.  Javier dances with Katey while James sits at the bar. Soon he is accosted by Javier's brother, Carlos, who tells him that they will eventually kick the Americans out of Cuba. Javier comes over and argues with his brother. James takes Katey back to the car and assaults her after she refuses to kiss him. She slaps him and runs into the club, and Javier agrees to walk her home.  The next day, Katey walks by a dance class. The teacher ([[Patrick Swayze]]) asks if anyone wants to enter the big dance contest and then dances with Katey for a bit. She grabs a flyer for the competition.  While walking to the pool, James apologizes to Katey and then tells her that Susie saw Javier with her and got him fired. Katey argues with Susie and goes to find Javier. He is now working at a [[chop shop]] with Carlos. She asks him to enter the dance contest with her, but he refuses. Meanwhile, it is becoming apparent that Carlos is helping the revolutionaries.  The next day, Javier shows up at Katey's school and agrees to enter the dance contest with her. They start teaching each other dance moves and Javier convinces her to "feel the music". They practice all the time, and Katey dances some more with the dance teacher, until it is the night of the dance. Katey and Javier dance with the other couples on the floor and are chosen to go on to the next round.  Katey's parents disapprove of her relationship with Javier, but Katey reconciles with them. On the night of the contest's final round, while Katey and Javier are on the dance floor, Javier sees his brother and some revolutionaries disguised as waiters, and the police soon try to arrest them. The contest stops as everyone flees the club, and Javier has to save Carlos from the police. Javier and Carlos talk about how they miss their dad, then they hear that [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista]] has fled the country and join the celebration.  Later, Javier comes to the hotel and finds Katey. He takes her to the beach and they make love. The next day, Katey's parents tell her they are leaving Cuba and she has one last night with Javier. They go to the Cuban club where they first danced, and the floor is theirs.

Dinocroc
 A North African dinosaur, related to the crocodile, is found which could grow up to fifty feet long.  Dr. Campbell ([[Bruce Weitz]]) uses its DNA to create two hybrids of it with a modern-day crocodile at Paula Kennedy's Genetic Research Co. (Gereco) lab. One creature kills Dr. Campbell's assistant and the other creature before escaping. This information is kept from Sheriff Harper (Napier) by Kennedy, stating the dead creature killed Campbell's assistant. His daughter, county dog catcher Diane Harper, helps her ex-welding artist, Tom Banning, and his 12-year-old brother Michael ([[Jake Thomas]]) find their three-legged dog, Lucky, who was lost a few days earlier.  Meanwhile, Kennedy sends a trapper to feed Dinocroc (the animal still being on Gereco Property). The trapper uses Lucky as bait, but Lucky runs away and Dinocroc quickly devours the trapper soon after. Later in the morning Diane and Tom find Lucky running around in the woods and try to catch him, unaware that Dinocroc is lurking nearby, but Dr. Campbell saves them by shooting at it. Kennedy then hires an Australian crocodile hunter, Dick Sydney ([[Costas Mandylor]]), to help kill Dinocroc. Later that night, Michael sneaks out to look for Lucky when he witnesses the creature. Dinocroc chases Michael through the forest into a tool shed sitting above water. Dinocroc then gets under the shed and devours Michael from below, leaving only his head.  The next day, not having noticed that Michael has gone, Tom, Diane, Dick and Campbell find that the creature is headed toward the town's lakeside beach. It kills three people, the last one being Campbell. In a press conference after the incident Kennedy lies that Campbell was not part of Gereco. Sheriff Harper then plans to kill the creature with his police force and Diane. While looking for it, they stumble upon Michael's damaged bike and Michael's remains in the shed. Tom, who knows Michael is missing, appears on his motorbike, then speeds away after seeing what is left of his dead brother. After trying to get drunk, Tom cries loudly over his brother and Diane comes to comfort him along with Lucky. Meanwhile, five of Sheriff Harper's officers are killed by Dinocroc.  The next day, Tom, Diane and others devise a plan to trap Dinocroc in a tunnel and gas him to death. Sheriff Harper uses some dogs for bait, which Diane and Tom object to, so Harper has them handcuffed and put in the police car. The two escape and use a blowtorch to release the chained dogs, while the creature chases them. They trap Dinocroc in the tunnel and gas him, seemingly killing it.  While a local news crew is taping Kennedy (who arrived after the creature's death) inside the tunnel, telling the reporter false stories about the events, Dinocroc awakens, devours Kennedy whole and comes after Tom and Diane, who are left after the news crew drives away quickly. After hiding under a truck they hear a train and lure Dinocroc across the tracks. It is rammed by a passing train, followed by Tom stabbing it in the eye with a small pipe as revenge for Michael's death. As the sun rises the next day, Diane and Tom drive away, contemplating leaving for a vacation together. Then the camera pans slowly back as their truck passes and Dinocroc is seen walking weakly across the road, still alive.  
District 13
 In 2010, social problems have overrun the poorer suburbs of [[Paris]]; especially [[Banlieue]] 13, commonly referred to as B13: a [[ghetto]] with a population of two million people. Unable to control B13, the authorities surround the entire area with a high wall topped by [[barbed tape]], forcing the inhabitants within to survive without education, proper utilities or police protection. Police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out. Three years later, the district has become overrun with gangs. Leïto ([[David Belle]]) is a fighter of such gangs. He disposes of a case of drugs down a drain, then escapes the gang who has come to collect the drugs. The gang's leader, Taha, kidnaps Leïto's sister Lola in retaliation. Leïto is able to rescue her and take Taha to the police station, but the police arrest Leïto and let Taha leave with Lola, stating that they are leaving the district.  Six months later, undercover policeman Damien Tomaso completes a successful operation at a casino in Paris. His next assignment: Taha's gang has taken a bomb from a nuclear transport vehicle and accidentally activated it, giving it 24 hours before it wipes out the district. Posing as a prisoner, Damien infiltrates the district and disarm the bomb. Leïto immediately sees through Damien's cover, but the two reluctantly team up to save Leïto's sister as well. The pair surrenders to Taha in order to gain access to his base, where they find the bomb has been set up on a missile launcher aimed at Paris, with Lola handcuffed to it. Taha demands a high ransom to deactivate the bomb; the government refuses. After Damien gives them Taha's bank account codes, they drain his funds. Leïto and Damien escape, and Taha is killed by his own men when they realize he will be unable to pay them. The much more benevolent K2 takes over and allows Leïto and Damien to stop the bomb.  After fighting their way to the building, Damien calls his contact to receive the deactivation code. However, after recognizing certain symbols in the code, Leïto deduces that the government has [[frameup|framed]] them, and the code will actually detonate the bomb instead of deactivating it. After Leïto and Damien fight, Lola is able to restrain Damien long enough for the timer on the bomb to run out. The bomb does not explode, proving Leïto right. The pair return to the government building with the bomb and use it to force the government agent to admit that he had planned to blow up B13 as a means to end its existence, catching it on camera and broadcasting nationally. Soon the rest of the government promises to tear down the containment wall and bring back schools and police to B13. Leïto and Damien depart as friends, and Lola kisses Damien, encouraging him to visit B13.  
Direct Action (film)
  With fifteen years on the force, Sergeant Frank Gannon ([[Dolph Lundgren]]) has spent the last three years on the Direct Action Unit (DAU) task force, fighting gang crime and corruption.  The DAU, led by Captain Stone ([[Conrad Dunn]]), is a special unit of the Metropolitan Police Department focusing on gang violence, drugs, and prostitution. It's made up of highly trained officers with at least 10 years on the force. They have been untouchable in every way.  With the highest arrest record in the department, two Medals of Valor, the youngest officer ever to make detective, and the son of a cop himself, Gannon does everything with integrity. His father was the late Captain Michael J. Gannon.  Although the Direct Action Unit appears to have been the saving force in city over the past few years—fighting against theft, larceny, conspiracy, extortion, and murder—evidence is coming to light that some members of the DAU were up to much more than keeping the city streets safe.  The Direct Action Unit task force has been under intense federal investigation for 8 months on suspicions of stealing drugs and money, the jailing of innocent people, and possibly murder. And the investigation is being overseen by Assistant Attorney General LoPresti ([[Daniel Kash]]).  At the end of his shift on this day, Gannon is to testify at a federal grand jury about the DAU, which is making Gannon's bosses extremely nervous.  That morning, Gannon is suddenly partnered with detective trainee Billie Ross ([[Polly Shannon]]), and is asked to show her the ropes. With little experience on the streets, Ross is thrilled to start her two-week detective training period with the legendary Gannon.  This not good news for Gannon, as Ross is hardly the experienced backup he needs on the toughest day of his career as Captain Stone keeps sending men to kill him. And Stone has been working with a drug ring led by Khalid Manseur ([[Anthony J. Mifsud]]). Even LoPresti has been working with Stone.  Stone frames Gannon and Ross for murder in the self-defense killings of three corrupt cops, and to prove their innocence, Gannon and Ross will have to take down Stone and everyone he's working with.

DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story
 Peter LaFleur is the owner of Average Joe's Gymnasium, a small, dilapidated gym with only a few members. When he [[Default (finance)|defaults]] on the gym's [[mortgage loan|mortgage]], it is purchased by his rival, the arrogant White Goodman, a fitness guru and owner of the Globo Gym across the street. Unless Peter can raise $50,000 in thirty days, White will [[foreclosure|foreclose]] on Average Joe's and demolish it to build a parking garage. Attorney Katherine "Kate" Veatch is working on the transaction for White. White unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her; she is repulsed and kindly refuses his advances, citing [[conflict of interest]]. Meanwhile, she develops a close friendship with Peter while reviewing his financial records.  Average Joe's employees Dwight and Owen and members Steve "the Pirate" (who acts like and truly believes he is a pirate), Justin, and Gordon try to raise the money needed to save the gym. Gordon suggests that they enter a [[dodgeball]] tournament in [[Las Vegas]] with a $50,000 prize. They form a team with Peter and watch a 1950s-era training video narrated by dodgeball legend Patches O'Houlihan and a 12-year old boy named Timmy. They are soundly defeated by a [[Girl Scout]] troop in a local qualifying match but win by default when the Scouts are disqualified because of one member's [[steroid]] and beaver tranquilizer use.  White spies on Average Joe's using a hidden camera in a cardboard cutout of himself, and forms his own dodgeball team to defeat them. Peter is approached by the aging Patches, who is a wheelchair user. Patches volunteers to coach the team. Patches's unusual training regimen includes throwing wrenches at the team, forcing them to dodge oncoming cars, and constantly berating them with insults. Kate demonstrates skill at the game but declines to join the team as it would be a conflict of interest. Meanwhile, White arranges for Kate to be fired from her law firm to free her from her conflict of interest and clear the way for him to date her. Enraged, but now free of conflict, she joins the Average Joe's team.  At the tournament in Las Vegas, Average Joe's suffers early setbacks but manages to advance to the final round against Globo Gym. The night before the match, Patches is killed by a falling sign. Peter expresses his anxiety that the team will lose and angrily tells Steve that he is not a pirate, causing Steve to leave the team. Returning to his room, Peter encounters White, who offers him $100,000 for the deed to Average Joe's. The day of the final round, Justin leaves to help his classmate Amber with a cheerleading competition, leaving the team without enough members to compete. Peter has a chance encounter with [[Lance Armstrong]], who talks him into rejoining his team. But he and Justin return too late; Average Joe's has already forfeited the match. Gordon finds a loophole in the rules: a majority of the judges can overturn the forfeiture. [[Chuck Norris]] casts the tie-breaking vote allowing the team to play.  After an intense game, Peter and White face off in a [[sudden death (sport)|sudden-death]] match to determine the winner. Inspired by a vision of Patches, Peter blindfolds himself and is able to dodge White's throw and strike him, winning the championship and the prize money. White declares the victory meaningless, revealing that Peter agreed to sell Average Joe's to him the previous night, but Peter reveals that he used White's $100,000 to bet on Average Joe's to win; with the odds against them at 50 to 1, he collects $5 million. Because Globo Gym is a [[public company]], he purchases a [[controlling interest]] in it, thus regaining Average Joe's, and fires White. Steve, now with a more normal appearance, returns to the group and apologizes to Peter, but quickly returns to his pirate persona when Peter shows him his winnings.  Peter is shocked when a girlfriend of Kate's kisses her passionately, but Kate then reveals that she is [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and kisses Peter as well. Justin finds romance with Amber, while Owen begins dating Fran from the Globo Gym team. Peter opens youth dodgeball classes at a newly renovated Average Joe's, while White spirals into depression and morbid obesity.

 Timoteo ([[Sergio Castellitto]]), a surgeon, gets the shocking news that his fifteen-year-old daughter Angela (Elena Perino) has been seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. As she is operated upon, Timoteo looks out of a window to see (or imagines seeing) a woman, her back facing him, proceeding to sit down on a chair in the rain outside. He notices her prominent red heels and turns away in disbelief, indicating he was familiar with them. His subsequent reminiscences about an old affair comprise the remainder of the film.  A subsequent scene shows Timoteo sitting in a bar in an unfamiliar location on a hot day. Italia ([[Penélope Cruz]]), a woman of Albanian origin working at the bar and wearing red heels, offers to let him make a seemingly important call from her home.

Meanwhile, Italia also becomes pregnant with his child. Timoteo, now in a real dilemma, cannot gather the courage to confront Elsa in her condition. Italia, unaware of this, interprets Timoteo's hesitation as a lack of commitment on his part and is heartbroken by this perceived betrayal. Later, Timoteo encounters a seemingly unstable Italia dancing frenziedly outside her house. On his chiding her, Italia tells him agitatedly that she has had their child aborted at a nearby gypsy's,adding bitterly it was for the best as she wouldn't have made a good mother anyway. Greatly disturbed by this development,Timoteo leaves and goes home to his pregnant wife.  Some months later, Timoteo, shopping with his wife who is about to deliver, spots Italia in a crowd and rushes after her in the rain. After catching up with her, he profusely apologises to Italia, asking her forgiveness for all the pain he caused. After reacting violently initially, Italia tells him that she knew now why he could not leave his wife and that she understood. He also learns from her that she would be moving to another town shortly.  Next morning, Timoteo offers to drive Italia down to her new town. During the journey, his feelings for Italia grow stronger and he confesses his desire to marry and settle down with her in the new town. While having dinner, Timoteo marries himself off to Italia and refers to her as "my wife" while speaking to a waitress. That night, he is woken by Italia's screams as she is gripped by unbearable pain in her abdomen. She is rushed to the local hospital, where an ultrasound reveals her belly to be full of blood, indicating a botched abortion. A desperate Timoteo then proceeds to operate on Italia. She dies soon after briefly regaining consciousness.  His recollections are interrupted by a nurse who informs him that his daughter's condition has stabilised. He then visits her with his wife. In the final act, a relieved Timoteo takes out Italia's red shoe, which she had lost on the way to the hospital the day she died, and that the funeral company had refused to put in the closed coffin, and which he had carefully preserved, and kisses it as a gesture of thanks.

Downfall (2004 film)
  In November 1942, Hitler orders that a secretary be hired, with [[Traudl Junge]] getting the job at the [[Wolf's Lair]] in [[East Prussia]]. The time then changes to Hitler's birthday in 1945. During the [[Battle of Berlin]], an artillery blast wakes up Traudl, [[Gerda Christian]] and [[Constanze Manziarly]], the other assistants. Down in the ''[[Führerbunker]]'', Hitler is informed by [[Wilhelm Burgdorf]] that Berlin is under attack and the [[Red Army]] has advanced to within  of central Berlin. ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] leaves to negotiate surrender terms with the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] behind Hitler's back after he refuses to leave the city. Meanwhile, a group of [[Hitler Youth]] members bolster defenses. Peter, one of the members, is urged by his father to desert but refuses.  SS physician [[Ernst-Günther Schenck]] convinces an SS general to allow his ignoring of an evacuation order and is then requested by ''[[Brigadeführer]]'' [[Wilhelm Mohnke]] to bring medical supplies to the [[Reich Chancellery]]. Hitler discusses his new [[scorched earth]] [[Nero Decree|policy]] with his Minister of Armaments, [[Albert Speer]], while [[Eva Braun]] holds a party that is broken up by artillery fire. After General [[Helmuth Weidling]] explains to [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] and Burgdorf that he allegedly ordering a retreat to the west was a misunderstanding, Weidling is appointed to oversee Berlin's crumbling defenses. Hitler orders an attack from [[Felix Steiner]]'s unit to stem the future Soviet advance – army groups. But is told afterwards that Steiner could not mount the attack, to which he flies into a furious rage at what he perceives as betrayal.  General Mohnke confronts [[Joseph Goebbels]], who is relentless against civilians of the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', while Hitler orders Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] to find Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] and help plan an offensive to recover the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] oil fields. Later on, [[Martin Bormann]] interrupts a meeting between Hitler, Goebbels, and [[Walther Hewel]] to read a message from [[Hermann Göring]] [[Göring Telegram|requesting command and head-of-state]]. Hitler strips Göring of rank, and orders him arrested, naming [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] as replacement. Speer admits defying Hitler's scorched earth policy orders, however he does not punish Speer.  Hitler then receives report that Himmler contacted [[Folke Bernadotte]] attempting to negotiate surrender. Hitler orders test pilot [[Hanna Reitsch]] to find him and his adjutant [[Hermann Fegelein]]. After learning that Fegelein has deserted, Hitler orders him executed. Fegelein is found drunk and executed by an [[Reichssicherheitsdienst|RSD]] squad.  Reichsphysician SS [[Ernst-Robert Grawitz]], head of the [[German Red Cross]] also responsible for [[Nazi human medical experiments]], asks Hitler's permission to evacuate for fear of reprisal from the Soviets, which Hitler denies. Grawitz commits suicide by detonating two grenades, which also kills his family. Weidling reports no reserves left, and Mohnke reports that the Red Army is only 300 to 400 metres from the Reich Chancellery. Hitler reassures that General [[Walther Wenck]]'s [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|12th Army]] will save them. After midnight, Hitler dictates his last will and testament to Traudl, before marrying Eva Braun. The following morning, Weidling reports the remaining armies are now incapable of any meaningful action. Hitler plans to kill himself before he can be captured, so Dr. [[Werner Haase]] explains the best method for suicide as well as for administering poison to [[Blondi]], his dog. Hitler bids farewell to the bunker staff, and gives [[Magda Goebbels]] his own [[Golden Party Badge]] before he and Eva then commit suicide. As per Hitler's orders, they are cremated in the Chancellery garden. Krebs then meets with Marshal [[Vasily Chuikov]] to negotiate peace terms, but returns unsuccessful.  Goebbels refuses to surrender. Magda murders her six children with [[cyanide]] before she commits suicide with her husband in the Chancellery garden. As remaining staff in the bunker evacuate, Krebs and Burgdorf kill themselves. Weidling broadcasts that Hitler is dead and that he is seeking an immediate [[ceasefire]]. The remaining SS troops of the bunker try to flee the city, Hewel joins them, but after word reaches them of the surrender he and several others shoot themselves. Meanwhile, the child soldiers have all died except Peter, who discovers a ''[[Greifkommando]]'' or ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]'' squad executed his parents. Traudl decides to leave. Peter pulls her through the masses, where they find a bicycle at a ruined bridge to leave Berlin.  
The Door in the Floor
 The film is set in an exclusive beach community on [[Long Island]], where children's book author and artist Ted Cole ([[Jeff Bridges]]) lives with his wife Marion ([[Kim Basinger]]) and their young daughter Ruth ([[Elle Fanning]]), who usually is supervised by her nanny Alice. Their home is filled with photographs of the couple's teenaged sons, who were killed in an automobile accident; the tragedy left Marion deeply depressed and her marriage in a shambles. The one shared experience that holds the family together is a ritualistic daily viewing of a home gallery of family photographs of the deceased sons.   Ted and Marion temporarily separate, each alternately living in the house and in a rented apartment in town. Ted hires Eddie O'Hare ([[Jon Foster]]) to work as his summer assistant and driver, since his own license was suspended for drunk driving. An aspiring writer, Eddie admires Ted, but he soon discovers the older man is a self-absorbed womanizer with an erratic work schedule that leaves the young assistant to fill his time as best he can. Eddie and Marion soon engage in a sexual relationship, which seems not to bother Ted, who is enjoying trysts of his own with local resident Evelyn Vaughn ([[Mimi Rogers]]) during sketching sessions at which she serves as his model. When Ruth walks into the room while Eddie and her mother are making love, Ted becomes upset with his wife and advises Eddie he may have to testify about the incident if Ted decides to fight for full [[Child custody|custody]] of the child.  Marion eventually leaves Ted and their daughter, taking with her all the photographs and negatives of her dead sons, save one that is being reframed after it was broken, injuring Ruth. Eddie takes the initiative to retrieve the one remaining reframed picture so that Ruth can have at least one partial image of her brothers.  Ted reveals to Eddie the story of the car accident that caused his sons' deaths.  Ted suggests his and Marion's drunkenness and Ted's failure to remove snow from the rear tail light and turn signal lights likely contributed to their sons' deaths. Eddie learns more about what may have contributed to Marion's intense despair, mental states, and choice to abandon her remaining child.  At the end of the film, Ted does not fully understand why Marion left, and he questions, "What kind of mother leaves her daughter?"  At the end of the story, Ted stops while playing alone in his squash court, looks into the camera with resignation, then lifts the door in the floor and descends.

When she arrives home, she admits her affair to Steve, who tells her to move out.  Lucy gives her a place to crash, although she's angry with Irene for flaking out on a job. Irene eventually finds herself a house. After another of Irene's Narcotics meetings, Bob shows up to apologize for getting her caught up in his mess and subsequently avoiding her calls. Irene forgives him and he begins to stay at her house. Meanwhile, Bob is using, but intends to start going to support meetings again. His dealer tries to persuade him to sell some pills, but he refuses. Irene realizes he's been getting high, and as a result endangered her kids; she confronts him and silently asks him to leave.  
Dorian Blues
 High school senior Dorian Lagatos realizes he is gay and meets another gay youth locally, but remains confused, and finally comes out to his brother, Nicky. Nicky is a scholarship-winning quarterback and favorite son to their hetero-normative and argumentative father. Dorian starts therapy, then resorts to confession in the Church. When his therapist and the church politely avoid offering any real help, Dorian has his first intimate encounter with a local gay youth. Dorian goes back to Nick, who was at first reluctant to accept his brother's sexuality. Nick attempts to teach Dorian how to fight and arranges to have him spend a night with a prostitute in order to make him become straight; from these efforts Dorian gains only a concussion and lesson in dancing, respectively.  After much soul-searching, Dorian comes out to his father (while wearing a fuchsia shirt) for which he is kicked out of the house after a very surreal argument over whether or not Dorian is gay. His father is very preoccupied with who else may know of Dorian's defective nature although Nick confesses that he knows and an anti-climatic scene resolves with Dorian packing his bags. Dorian moves to [[New York City]], a city he adores. Dorian expresses all kinds of angst over his life style, defending his true nature to his father over the Christmas holidays. Returning to New York, Dorian experiences a series of encounters with the darker side of homosexuality. Dorian finds a boyfriend, but he gets dumped after two months with no given reason. Dorian develops a deep depression and finally, in despair gives in to it, coincidental to Nicky visiting Dorian in the city.  Nicky reluctantly joins Dorian with friends at Dorian's favorite local [[gay bar]]. Just as Dorian pleads with a friend to flaunt his newly found popularity, Nicky reunites with obsequious football friends—stealing Dorian's thunder. Dorian then learns his ex-boyfriend dumped him for another. The after-discussion of the evening revolves around Nick defending his sexuality to Dorian in the face of Nick's football friends being gay and Dorian defending his own sexuality to his brother. Later that night, Dorian awakes to Nicky crying and learn that Nick was cut from the football team and was stripped of his scholarship. In the middle of the discussion, they both learn their father has died of a [[heart attack]]. At the funeral, Dorian's mother, finally freed of the overbearing influence of Dorian's father, tells Dorian she regrets not stopping his father from being angry with him.

Doraemon: Nobita in the Wan-Nyan Spacetime Odyssey
 An elderly dog goes to a [[Time travel|time machine]], which he plans to use to drive to the future so he can meet with "someone" who gives him a [[kendama]]. However, the machine encounters "temporal turbulence" and goes haywire and the dog is regressed back to his infant state, eventually found by a researcher cat.  In the present day, Nobita finds a stray dog drowning in a river while playing with Gian and Suneo by the river side. Feeling sorry for the dog, he decides to take it home by hiding it in a "kennel on the wall" and names it Ichi (originated from "One", which is a [[homophone]] of the sound of a barking dog in Japanese), and secretly feeds it and plays with Ichi with his kendama to find. Soon after, he also adopts a stray cat named Zubu (or ''wet'' in Japanese, due to the discovery of it in a rainstorm). Eventually, Nobita's mother gets suspicious and checks in on Nobita's room. To avoid being caught with Ichi and Zubu, he and Doraemon travel through The Anywhere Door to the Mountains, but accidentally finds more stray dogs and cats endangered by [[deforestation]]. With so many pets, Nobita and his friends decide to send them back in time, 300 million years ago, where there was no other living beings around. After using the Ray of Evolution to allow them to operate a food-making machine, they depart, with Nobita promising Ichi that he will return later.  However, when they try to visit them the next day (from their point of view), they encountered a time-space anomaly, sending them crash landing 1,000 years after their original time-destination; to their surprise, they found out the dogs and cats have overused the Ray of Evolution which makes them evolved enough to form a civilized society that rivaled those of Future Society. As the time machine is broken, they have to wait until it can be fixed. In the meantime, they explore the society, where they meet with a group of teenage thieves: Bulltaro, Duk, Chiko, and the leader, Hachi. Nobita is certain that Hachi is really bow bow Ichi in disguise, despite the difference in time. Nobita and his friends accompany the thieves in infiltrating an amusement park, where they believe is the location where the thieves' parents are held prisoner. Using a drill, the group arrives at a room containing a time machine, but the group are attacked by the guards and separated; Doraemon is stunned and taken by the guards while the rest are taken prisoner.  Meanwhile, the government predict a cluster of asteroids that will collide with Earth and to evacuate the citizens, they order chunks of Noradium, materials capable of building spacecrafts to be sent to the government, but they are stolen by Nekojara, a treacherous high-ranking official. Doraemon awakes to meet with Nekojara, who explains that he plans to use a Noradium-powered time machine to travel to the future so he can take revenge against humans for abandoning unwanted animals using the "devolve" function on the Ray of Evolution as written in a prophecy book written by his ancestor, Zubu. He manages to trick Doraemon to fix the ray after threatening to kill Shami, an idol cat who Doraemon falls in love with, who is actually his underling. After being freed from prison, the others stage a mission to rescue Doraemon and take the Noradium back. Doraemon manages to break the Ray of Evolution and escapes from the machine with Shami (whom Nekojara abandons) while Nobita and Hachi successfully stop the time machine from functioning. However, a meteor hits the machine and sinks it, rendering the Noradium unusable. Hachi is also sent underwater and as Nobita rescues Hachi from drowning, Hachi learns that he is in fact Ichi and is the elderly dog shown in the beginning of the film. He remembers that he had stored a Nobita-shaped statue built purely by Noradium. The group takes the statue and delivers it to the government, destroying Nekojara's time machine and captures him and his underling along the way.  The government successfully build several spacecrafts and quickly evacuate the citizens right before the asteroids fall. As Nobita departs along with his friends in the repaired time machine, he bids Ichi farewell.  
Dost (2004 film)
   
Dracula 3000
  In the year 3000, the space salvage ship ''Mother III'' happens upon the derelict transport ''Demeter''. Captain Van Helsing ([[Casper Van Dien]]) and his crew board the abandoned ship.  They explore the bridge and find the corpse of the ''Demeter's'' captain, ([[Udo Kier]]) tied to a chair and clutching a crucifix. Despite the misgivings of crew, particularly intern Mina Murry ([[Alexandra Kamp]]) and vice-captain Aurora ([[Erika Eleniak]]), the Captain claims salvage rights and decides to tow the ship back to Earth. As the crew prepares to return, ''Mother III'' suddenly uncouples from the ''Demeter'', leaving them stranded with no means of communication.  Later, cargo specialist 187 ([[Coolio]]) and deckhand Humvee ([[Tiny Lister]]) discover a cargo bay full of coffins. 187 speculates that the coffins could contain smuggled goods and opens one, only to find sand. Humvee heads back to the bridge while 187 stays to open the other coffins; he is soon mysteriously attacked. The crew rushes to 187's aid, only to find he is now a vampire. Under orders from his "master", 187 vows to kill the entire crew.  Aurora, fleeing 187, runs into the "master" ([[Langley Kirkwood]]), a vampire named [[Count Orlock]]. Aurora makes her way to a recreation room where she reports her encounter with Orlock and reveals his intentions to return to Earth. Upon questioning, she is unable to explain how she escaped Orlock unharmed.  Thinking Aurora could be lying, the Captain ties her up and Humvee guards her. Soon, 187 gains entrance and attacks Humvee, who manages to stake him in the heart with a pool cue. Aurora, still tied up, confesses that she is an undercover android cop investigating salvage activities. The Captain and Humvee feel betrayed, but untie her.  Searching the ship's database, the Captain and the Professor (Grant Swanby), who uses a wheelchair, discover that the legendary vampire hunter [[Abraham Van Helsing]] was one of the Captain's ancestors. The Professor believes Orlock will seek revenge against the Captain. The Captain learns how vampires can be stopped and decides to steer the ''Demeter'' on a course towards a [[binary star]] system.  The Captain and Aurora are soon confronted by Orlock. Aurora leaves to rally reinforcements, leaving the Captain to fight Orlock alone. Orlock eventually gains the upper hand and turns the Captain into a vampire. Aurora and Humvee return, only to be attacked by the Captain. Aurora stakes him with another cue stick, but Mina (now a vampire herself) attacks, allowing Orlock to escape. Mina is dispatched by Humvee.  The Professor, despairing of his chances of survival, finds Orlock, who promises to free him from his disability in return for aiding Orlock's return to Earth. When Aurora and Humvee return to the bridge, they find the Professor passed out. Aurora stabs him with a cross, revealing that he was a vampire. A furious Orlock tries to enter the bridge, but Humvee and Aurora close the door on him, cutting off his arm in the process.  As the ''Demeter'' draws closer towards one of the binary stars, Humvee and Aurora confess to each other that neither knows how to pilot the ship. Knowing they are about to die, they take comfort in the fact that Orlock's plan to return to Earth have been foiled. Aurora reveals that she is programmed for sexual pleasure, and it is implied the two spend their final moments having sex.  The movie ends with a video segment from the ''Demeter's'' Captain Varna, who announces his intention to sacrifice himself and his ship. The ''Demeter'' explodes in space, killing Humvee and Aurora, and destroying Orlock.  
Dragons: Fire and Ice
 The movie starts with the history of how mighty fire-breathing dragons came to be. The dragons and their crystals of tremendous power came to the human world through a portal from their world of the dragons. But while the dragons brought knowledge and wanted only peace, the human kingdoms of Norvagen and Draigar wanted war and, having misused the knowledge brought by the dragons, battled erupted. Thoron, the Dragon King and holder of the legendary Aurathon crystal, appointed Xenoz the wizard as an ambassador for both the dragons and the two kingdoms with gifts of immortality and power and strength over all of the dragon crystals. However, when things started looking good, an evil force came upon the land and killed the Dragon Queen and took her ice crystal. After this, The Dragon King and many followers returned to their world, vowing to return only after the war had ended.  In the present day, King Olsef of the Norvagen Kingdom is giving his eight-year-old son, Prince Dev, some practice for battle while expressing his hatred for the Draigar, who he believes hunted the remaining dragons to near-extinction. While Dev's practice shows him to be too impulsive, Olsef believes nevertheless that he is ready to begin riding on Targon, the only dragon that they have left. During this time, Xenoz arrives and gives Dev his blessing.  Meanwhile, in the Draigar kingdom, King Siddari is training Princess Kyra in the same form and blames the Norvagen for the disappearances of the dragons. Xenoz comes by to give the same blessing he gave to Dev so that Kyra can begin flying on the Draigar's last dragon, Aurora. During the flight, the dragons are drawn to a fireball in the sky where a portal opens and a black dragon on fire falls through, knocking the dragons and royals into an old battle field. The black dragon absorbs a bright green crystal on its neck and marks both the children with his mystical teardrops, disappearing into the ground soon after. As Dev and Kyra prepare to fight, their fathers appear and duel. While Dev and Kyra are taken away by their dragons, Xenoz watches through his scrying crystal, stating that the battle begins again.  Eight years later, Dev and Kyra are both sixteen-year-old teenagers with strange abilities and want the war to end, but their fathers object to their ideas on how it should. They both violate orders and continue with their ideas anyway, catching the eye of Xenoz in the process. The two royals fight until their fathers and armies show up to fight to the death once and for all. Just before the battle commences, an army of vorgans show up and capture the kings. Xenoz arrives just in time to save Dev and Kyra and takes them to his ice mountain home. Once there, Xenoz recommends that they retrieve the Aurathon from a rogue dragon in order to rescue their fathers. In the cave where the dragon resides, they fight him but are quickly overpowered. The dragon then reveals that they were sent there to try and trick him into giving the Aurathon's location so that Xenoz could take it for himself. They escape the following vorgan attack and go to the Ring of Oroborus. There, the Dragon reveals himself to be the Dragon King Thoron. The kings, meanwhile, have discovered Xenoz's treachery when they learn that he kept the bones of dragons  he had slain. Thoron explains the truth behind everything that made him leave. When Xenoz was granted the ability to use dragon crystals, it was only to promote good things between the two worlds. However, Xenoz conspired to kill the Dragon Queen with the help of an evil and vengeful dragon named Stendahl and take her ice crystal. When Thoron arrived, he flamed them in his fury, but it wasn't strong enough. He took Stendahl back to the dragon and imprisoned him. Stendahl broke free 1,000 years later and attacked Thoron again. During the battle, the Aurathon became activated. While Stendahl was stopped, he hurled Thoron through where he bumped into the royals eight years earlier. Knowing he didn't have any strength to fight Xenoz (who was still alive thanks to his gift of immortality), he absorbed the Aurathon into himself and placed it inside Dev and Kyra. Knowing now where their elemental abilities came from, Dev and Kyra begin practicing their powers over fire and air. Unfortunately, they tear a hole in the Ring of Oroborus, alerting Xenoz to their position. They escape the attack with Targon and Aurora's help and head for Xenoz's castle.  Back at the castle, Xenoz summons ice dragons to fight Thoron. Dev and Kyra break in and quickly dispatch the vorgan guards but are captured by Xenoz, who uses a mind-reading crystal to discover the Aurathon's hiding place within Dev and Kyra. He then proceeds to extract it from their bodies. Thoron crashes through and falls to the base of the castle, where he discovers the skeleton of his queen. With a new driving force, he heads off to fight Xenoz. After betraying Gortaz, the leader of the vorgans, Xenoz gets hit in the face by Kyra. A mask falls off to reveal that Xenoz's face is burned. The downside of Xenoz's immortality was that he could never heal himself and he wants revenge for this. He opens the portal to Dragon World but Thoron gets in the way. However, Xenoz traps him in ice then explains that Dev and Kyra are weak and cannot do anything. Thoron begs to differ, pointing out that Dev and Kyra were chosen by the dragons themselves. With this, Dev and Kyra use their elemental abilities to break free and put the Aurathon back on Thoron's necklace. Thoron sticks himself in front of Xenoz's ice shards, seemingly sacrificing himself. However, he stands back up and then drags Xenoz back to Dragon World. With Xenoz gone, the ice castle begins to fall apart, so the kings and their children escape on Targon and Aurora.  The next day, both Norvagen and Draigar armies celebrate at Olsef's castle. During the celebration, the dragons return. Dev and Kyra jump on to Targon and Aurora to join the flight. As the celebration continues, Xenoz vows from his prison in Dragon World, which seems to be inside the Aurathon itself, "This is not over!"

Sara pushes him away and runs away while Måns yells at Ynge for going too far. Sara runs out and finds Måns current girlfriend hanging dead in the hallway. Ynge goes to have some milk and is killed by a fork struck through his head. Måns find the hysterical Sara and tries to calm her down and apologize.  A masked man appears and rams an axe into Måns' head as Sara runs off. Sara locks in Leo into a storeroom and calls for Therese and Felix to help. Sara finds an 8&nbsp;mm film in a box that had belonged to Rebecka, and discovers that Rebecka had a brother who has a weird similarity to Felix. Felix shows up and tells Sara that he and Rebecka were siblings. They were separated because their father was mentally unstable and put away. When Rebecka died, he swore to avenge her, dressed up as the Drowning Ghost, and started to kill the students who tormented Rebecka. He asks Sara to not say anything but believes she would any way and tries to kill her. Sara knocks him out and runs away with Therese. Therese falls into the well and breaks her leg. Sara climbs down after her. Morning comes and Felix awakens. He finds Sara and Therese, who are too afraid to call for help, in the well and climbs after them. Sara and Therese crawls down the pipe to the lake but Felix catches up with Therese and kills her off screen. Sara manages to reach the lake and escapes in a boat at the beach. She keeps her eyes on the pipe to see when Felix comes out of there, but falls asleep. When she awakens she has no idea how long she has been sleeping, and Felix is nowhere to be found. Felix tries to climb into the boat from underwater, but Sara cuts his hand by starting the boat engine. Felix tries to attack once more but Sara apparently kills him by bashing the anchor into his back. Felix sinks down to the bottom.  Sara is saved by the police and reunited with Leo on the beach; the police try to fish Felix up but instead find the farmer. Sara and Leo leave the boarding school and graduate at a school in [[Stockholm]]. During the graduation day eight months after the events, with all parents and friends of the many students present, Sara looks out over the sea of people and suddenly sees a sign with the words written in red paint "My beloved sister Rebecka". The film ends with Sara realizing that even though she cannot see him in the crowd Felix is still alive and amongst the people watching her and her classmates graduate.  
Dr. Moreau's House of Pain
 A group of friends investigate various strange events and find themselves trapped in a house at the mercy of a strange doctor and his various hideous "creations".  
Dumplings (film)
 Mrs Li, a former actress, is losing her good looks and longs for passion with her wealthy husband, who is revealed to be having a love affair with his younger and more attractive [[masseuse]]. In order to boost her image, she seeks the help of Aunt Mei, a local chef. Mei cooks her some special [[Jiaozi|dumpling]]s which she claims to be effective for rejuvenation. After Mrs Li sneaks a look in the kitchen and sees a [[foetus]] being used as an ingredient within her next meal on her visits, she is initially disgusted and runs away, but later comes back. Mei tells her that the secret ingredient for her rejuvenating dumplings is unborn foetuses imported from an abortion clinic in [[Shenzhen]], where she used to work. Mrs Li asks her to keep finding more potent remedies, until one day she is in luck: Mei had just performed a [[black market]] abortion on Kate, a girl five months pregnant who has been [[Incest|impregnated by her father]]. Mei makes the foetus into dumplings, which Mrs Li devours. This has a wondrous effect on her [[libido]] as she goes into the hospital and has sex with her husband, who has recently injured his leg.  In a short flashback, Kate and her mother are seen riding a bus home after the abortion. After getting off, Kate collapses on the pavement, bleeding from her [[uterus]]. With no one around, her mother can only watch as she slips into unconsciousness. Muttering her last words, "I don't want to die..." Kate dies soon afterwards, presumably from a ruptured uterus.   Mrs Li hosts a dinner party for her friends, who compliment her and wonder about her newfound beauty and youth. When she joins them, they claim there is a horrid fish-like smell in the air, which turns out to be from Mrs Li herself. She excuses herself from the table and runs to the bathtub. Furious with Mei, Mrs Li calls her, demanding to know what she has ingested. Mei merely claims that a child conceived by way of incest is the most potent. Curious at what his wife is yelling about, Mr Li gets on the other line and overhears the conversation between her and Mei about what happened, and pays the latter a visit to find out if her special dumplings really work. Mr Li eats one of the dumplings and has violent sex with Mei. After seeing an old poster of her, he is shocked to learn that she is actually in her 60s but has managed to preserve her physical appearance as a woman in her early 30s. Although she attributes her looks to her [[cannibalism]], the revelation does not stop Mr Li from continuing to have sex with her.  Soon, Mrs Li realises that she can not stay young without eating Mei's dumplings. Ignorant of her husband's affair with Mei, she pleads with Mei to continue to find her the most potent ingredients for the dumplings and promises to pay her handsomely. Presumably a mistress of Mr Li at this point in time, Mei ignores Mrs Li's plea and tears her cheque into pieces.  The next morning, police officers arrive at an apartment, where they find Kate's mother, crying, bloodied and clenching a knife. Upset about her daughter's death, she has stabbed her incestuous husband to death. It is implied that upon finding Kate's mother and her dead husband, the police find out Mei's identity and raid her apartment. Mei, however, has already fled. It is revealed that Mr Li has impregnated his masseuse. When Mrs Li finds out, she tracks down the pregnant masseuse and offers to pay her if she aborts the foetus immediately. The masseuse reluctantly accepts. Mrs Li insists to the doctor that the foetus should come out alive. She then takes the foetus, makes dumplings out of it, and ingests her husband's unborn child. Mei, on the other end, ends up selling dumplings on the streets in Shenzhen.  
Drum (2004 film)
 The story is based on real events and real people and is set in the mid-1950s freehold township of [[Sophiatown]], [[Johannesburg]]&mdash; one of the few areas in South Africa where blacks could own property and drink alcoholic beverages. ''Drum'' begins with the central character, sportswriter [[Henry Nxumalo]], reporting on a boxing match with [[Nelson Mandela]]. Nxumalo leaves his wife Florence at home while going out into his community's night life and has an affair with a female singer. He works for ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' magazine, which was "the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa."<ref name="swood"> </ref> The magazine was financed by whites and had a multiracial staff; it was popular among the black community. ''Drum'''s British editor, [[James R. A. Bailey|Jim Bailey]] (Jason Flemyng), asks Nxumalo to write on the township crime scene, and Nxumalo, while at first unwilling, finally agrees. While on the job, he encounters Slim (Zola), a gang leader, that he had previously met in [[shebeen|illegal township drinking places]], and witnesses him kill a man in Sophiatown.  Initially Nxumalo stays away from political articles, but eventually writes about more than entertainment after his wife and Mandela encourage him. When a young man goes missing at a [[Boer]] farm and is feared enslaved, Nxumalo decides to investigate [[undercover]]. He gets employment as a labourer at the farm, where he is treated like a slave and nearly killed. He becomes a celebrity when his story is published, further reinforced by getting himself in prison and reporting about its conditions. Nxumalo decides that his destiny is to be a [[muckracker]] and, with the help of the German photographer Jürgen Schadeberg (Gabriel Mann), ventures on more risky investigations.  Nxumalo frequently fights the racism and [[apartheid]] that is beginning to creep into his hometown. He tries to tackle stories important to his society's well-being. However, he is no match to the plan to evict residents and ultimately destroy Sophiatown. Constantly harassed by the government, at the end of the film he is stabbed to death. The attacker has never been identified.  
The Dust Factory
 Ryan Flynn ([[Ryan Kelley]]) is a young boy who, [[psychological trauma|traumatized]] by the death of his father, has not spoken aloud or exercised his imagination since. While on a walk with a friend, Ryan falls from a bridge and apparently drowns. He finds himself in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] called the ''Dust Factory'', which houses all humans who are on the verge of death, but have yet to die. The Dust Factory's topography is immense, encompassing lakes, forests, mountains, and a wide field covered by dry grass. In the center of the Dust Factory is a [[circus]] pavilion whose Ringmaster is a figure of some authority and dread. Each person dwelling in the Dust Factory must enter the circus pavilion and make a leap (a literal ''leap of faith'') across the arena into the arms of a trapeze artist to proceed into death or return to life. The latter decision occurs when a participant falls into the arena during the leap, leaving behind a pile of dust which marks the passage, gives the realm its name, and when disturbed allows the one doing so to enter a hidden chamber where they play a game of the individual's choosing against the Ringmaster. In the Factory, Ryan regains his voice and is reunited with his grandfather ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), whose [[Alzheimer's disease]] has (in his real life) prevented him from communicating with his family. The grandfather, who is apparently knowledgeable about the inner workings of the Dust Factory, advises and tells him stories. The stories he tells, which outwardly appear to convey no obvious meaning, contain hidden parables that Ryan must solve. The theme of belief and hope ''versus'' cynicism or despair surfaces in relation to one of these.  Throughout the main body of the plot, Ryan spends a single endless day exploring the Dust Factory under weather conditions that are always favorable to wandering through the environments and marveling at natural beauty. He is guided by his grandfather and accompanied by a girl of his own age called Melanie Lewis ([[Hayden Panettiere]]), who has been in the Dust Factory for years, lacks any memory of her previous life, and lives under the [[illusion]] that the [[climate]] is of perpetual winter, despite the appearance to Ryan and the viewer of interminable summer. Melanie and Ryan, under the eye of Ryan's grandfather, become intimate friends. Their time is passed in an emotional atmosphere of joy and discovery, mitigated only by the influence of the mysterious Ringmaster, who interferes several times with their activity, and by Melanie's conflict with Ryan's grandfather, who wishes Ryan to ''make the leap'' across the arena and thereby contradicts Melanie's desire that all things remain as they are forever. Matters gradually reach a climax, after which Ryan's grandfather ''makes the leap'' and dies. Subsequently, against Melanie's wishes (who does not want to be left alone in the Dust Factory), Ryan makes the leap himself, but falls into the pile of dust and is sent back to life. Melanie then defies her own delusion of continual winter and makes the decision to determine her own fate.  Having returned to life, Ryan resurfaces from beneath the water and is rescued by his friend. Although he no longer has any conscious memory of the Dust Factory, it seems to be present in his subconscious, as implied by the facts that he has regained his voice, and a general feeling of [[joy]] in life. He subsequently encounters Melanie, who in real life has recovered from a [[Intracranial aneurysm|cerebral aneurysm]]. Although neither Ryan or Melanie has any conscious memory of the other, they appear to subconsciously recognize each other.  
Duel (2004 film)
 Zeinal, an Iranian soldier who has been a prisoner of war for more than 20 years, returns only to see that he has been deemed a traitor. The story revolves around Zeinal and Eskanadar who both are looking for a chest containing several important documents.  
Eating Out
 After getting dumped by his girlfriend Tiffani von der Sloot ([[Rebekah Kochan]]), [[University of Arizona]] student Caleb Peterson (Scott Lunsford) commiserates with his roommate Kyle ([[Jim Verraros]]), who notes that while he has trouble getting the men he wants, he could get any woman because he is gay. Later at a party, Gwen Anderson ([[Emily Stiles]]) dumps her boyfriend after he comes out to her. Caleb sees her and becomes infatuated and meets Marc Everhard ([[Ryan Carnes]]), with whom Kyle is infatuated. Marc, meanwhile, sees Caleb and is instantly attracted. Kyle comes up with a crazy scheme. He tells Gwen that Caleb is gay so she'll set him up with Marc. Kyle figures that Caleb can use Marc to get to Gwen, while Kyle uses Caleb to get to Marc. Also, Tiffani lives next door to Gwen and Marc so seeing Caleb date Marc would make her crazy.  Caleb and Marc go out on a date then go back to Marc's place to watch a movie. Marc tries to put the moves on Caleb, who is unresponsive. Suddenly Gwen, who is stuck at a friend's house and bored, calls. She talks to Caleb, relaxing and seducing him verbally while Marc takes advantage by performing [[oral sex]] on him. Gwen hangs up to come home and Marc [[masturbation|masturbates]] next to Caleb. Caleb, feeling confused and insecure, leaves. He passes Gwen on her way home and she seduces him again, this time physically. They have sex in his convertible. Caleb goes home and goes to bed.  The next morning, Marc calls Caleb and leaves a message. Kyle overhears it and realizes that Marc and Caleb had sex. As Kyle storms into his room, Marc calls back. After the call Caleb goes to Kyle and tells him he has invited Gwen and Marc to dinner to clear everything up. Caleb also tells Kyle that he knows Kyle has feelings for him and that, if Caleb were at all gay, he'd be with Kyle. Gwen and Marc come over for dinner and Caleb is chagrined to see that Kyle has invited Caleb's family as well. Kyle convinces Gwen to "pretend" to be Caleb's date and Marc to "pretend" to be his. Dinner is going well, if a little awkwardly, until Tiffani inexplicably crashes the party. Gwen takes it upon herself to [[Outing|out]] Caleb to his parents (Murph Michaels and Mattie van der Voort). His parents take it quite well and everyone ends up in a bizarre group hug.  After Caleb's family and Tiffani leave, Gwen verbally attacks Kyle, thinking he is trying to steal Marc from Caleb. She makes it clear that "someone like Marc" would never go out with "someone like him." Caleb convinces Marc to talk to Kyle and Gwen figures out the entire scheme, which she thinks is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for her in light of the lengths to which Caleb went to sleep with her. Marc goes to talk to Kyle and tells Kyle that he was into him all along, having feigned disinterest this whole time. They finally kiss.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Marc and Kyle are shown shirtless, making out in his bed; it is implied they are about to have sex.  
The Edukators
 Set in 2004, the film revolves around three young [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] activists in [[Berlin]]'s city centre: Jule ([[Julia Jentsch]]), her boyfriend Peter ([[Stipe Erceg]]) and his best friend Jan ([[Daniel Brühl]]). Jule is a waitress struggling to pay off a €100,000 debt she incurred a year ago when she crashed into a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] belonging to a wealthy businessman named Hardenberg ([[Burghart Klaußner]]). After her eviction for non-payment of rent she moves in with Peter and Jan, who are often out all night. While Peter is in [[Barcelona]], Jan tells Jule that he and Peter spend their nights "educating" upper-class people by breaking into their houses, moving furniture around and leaving notes saying ''"die fetten Jahre sind vorbei"'' ("the days of plenty are over") or ''"Sie haben zu viel Geld"'' ("you have too much money").  After hearing this, Jule convinces the reluctant Jan to break into Hardenberg's home in the affluent Berlin suburb of [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]] while he is away on business. During the break-in, the thrill of the moment entices them to kiss before Jan leaves Jule alone for a few minutes; he does not want to destroy his friendship with Peter. As she wanders around outside Jule accidentally sets off the house's floodlights, and they quickly leave.  When Peter returns the next day, Jan and Jule do not tell him about their activities the night before. Jule realises that her mobile phone is gone, and she and Jan leave later that night to look for it in the house. After she finds it, Hardenberg walks in the door and struggles with Jule when he recognises her. Hearing them, Jan comes downstairs and knocks Hardenberg unconscious with a [[flashlight]]. Not knowing what to do, they call Peter and he comes to their aid.  The three cannot decide what to do with Hardenberg and take him to a remote, rarely used cabin belonging to Jule's uncle in the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]] Austrian [[Alps]] near [[Jenbach]], overlooking [[Achensee]]. As they try to decide how to deal with their hostage, they learn that Hardenberg was a radical himself during the 1960s. A leader of the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union]], he was a good friend of [[Rudi Dutschke]] before marrying, getting a good job and abandoning his ideals.  As the story progresses, political ideology and the characters' relationships become the main issues. Peter and Jan temporarily fall out over Jan's developing romance with Jule, and Hardenberg seems to regain some of his former self.  The trio finally decide that kidnapping Hardenberg was wrong and take him back to his house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (''[[Spezialeinsatzkommando]]'') gather outside their flat and knock on the door. Jule wakes up when she hears a knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule opens the door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: ''"Manche Menschen ändern sich nie"'' ("some people never change"). In the original German version, the Edukators set off in Hardenberg's boat in the Mediterranean, presumably to disrupt the island signal towers supplying most television programming to Western Europe.  
Ella Enchanted (film)
 Within the kingdom of Emir, in the town of Frell, a baby girl named Ella is born to Sir Peter and his wife Lady Eleanor. She is given the "gift of obedience" by a misguided and obnoxious fairy called Lucinda. This turns out to be more of a [[curse]], as it forces Ella to do anything she is told to do, even if the command is against her wishes. Ella's mother, on her deathbed, warns her daughter not to tell anyone about the curse she is under for fear that someone might use it to exploit Ella. After her mother's death, only Mandy, the household fairy, knows the secret.  Several years later, Ella's father remarries to a wealthy socialite, Dame Olga, who dislikes Ella. Her spoiled daughters Hattie and Olive notice Ella's obedience and start to humiliate her. Ella stumbles upon Prince Charmont, the handsome heir who will soon take the throne, as he's being pursued by his fan club of besotted young women. He invites Ella to the Coronation Ball, but Olga intercepts the invitation. Hattie and Olive, fan club members themselves, are overcome with jealousy. They force Ella to insult and cut ties with her best friend Areida.  Ella cannot bear her situation a moment longer, and resolves to find Lucinda, as she is the only one who can reverse the spell. Mandy helps by lending Ella her boyfriend Benny, whom she accidentally transformed into a talking magical book that can show people in their current surroundings. During her journey, Ella encounters an elf named Slannen, who wants to be a lawyer instead of an entertainer as the laws now require. They are both captured by a group of ogres, who want to eat them. Prince Charmont rescues them and accompanies them to a wedding in the land of giants, where Ella hopes to find Lucinda. En route, Ella opens Char's eyes to the cruelty of the laws [[Anthropocentrism#In fiction|oppressing elves and giants]] established by the [[Regent|acting ruler]], Char's sinister uncle Sir Edgar. Char invites Ella to visit the palace's Hall of Records and find Lucinda faster. But Edgar's talking snake, Heston, is spying on them.  At the palace, Heston tells Edgar about Ella's obedience, which Hattie confirms when Edgar offers her Char's hand in marriage. Knowing that Char intends to marry Ella, Edgar orders her to kill him when he proposes, and keep the plan a secret. Edgar also reveals that he murdered Char's father. To save Char, Ella writes him a letter, saying she is leaving permanently and cannot explain why, which breaks his heart. She then asks Slannen to tie her to a tree and get the giants to help. Lucinda then appears before Ella, who asks her to undo the "gift" of obedience. Lucinda is offended that Ella doesn't like her gift and simply tells Ella to remove it herself. She unties Ella, gives her a fancy dress, and tells her to attend the ball, where Char almost immediately takes her to the Hall of Mirrors and asks her to marry him.  Ella is about to stab him with the dagger Edgar provided, when she realizes Lucinda has provided the answer: looking into a mirror, she says, "You will no longer be obedient!" She drops the dagger and Char sees it. But Edgar is spying on them, and before Ella can explain, he orders the guards to lock her up, to be executed the following day.  Meanwhile, Benny informs Slannen, the giants, and the ogres that Ella is in trouble, so they all sneak into the castle to rescue her. They find out that Edgar is switching the crown Char will receive during the ceremony with a poisoned crown. Ella and her allies burst in just in time to stop him putting it on. Edgar and Heston call for the knights and Red Guards, and a battle ensues. Ella explains everything while fighting alongside Char, while Mandy manages to transform Benny back into a human. When Edgar's forces lose, Heston tries to [[Snakebite|bite]] Char, but is stopped by Ella, then trampled by Char's fan club. Caught trying to kill the prince, Edgar admits to the crowd that he killed the King, but says only he deserves the crown. Then, carried away by his own rhetoric, Edgar crowns himself and accidentally poisons himself.  Char and Ella kiss; her stepsisters arrive and order her to stop, but she happily refuses. Char once again asks Ella to marry him, and she agrees: "Now ''that'' I'll do." The movie ends with their wedding and a musical number. During all this, it's shown that Slannen is in a relationship with a giant named Brumhilda, Ella has rekindled her friendship with Areida, and Edgar has survived (albeit cognitively impaired by the poison). The Narrator announces two final words: The End.  
Electric Shadows
 '''Mao Xiaobing''' ([[Xia Yu (actor)|Xia Yu]]), a water bottle delivery boy in Beijing, loves to watch movies. One day, however, while riding his bike, he is attacked by '''Ling-Ling''' ([[Qi Zhongyang]]), a disturbed young woman, that lands him in the hospital. Ling-Ling is promptly arrested, but refuses to say why she attacked Mao Xiaobing, asking him only to feed her fish. Upon entering her apartment, however, Mao Xiaobing finds that Ling-Ling has created a veritable shrine to the 1930s film star, [[Zhou Xuan]]. When he stumbles upon her diary and begins reading, the film flashes back to Ling-Ling's mother as a young woman in [[Ningxia]].  Her mother had been working in radio when she became pregnant and subsequently abandoned by her lover. Branded a counter-revolutionary, she travels to the countryside where she befriends '''Pan''', a movie-projectionist where the two eventually marry. Ling-Ling meanwhile, thinks that her real father is a movie star of Zhou Xuan's era. Mao Xiaobing had been hit by his father, and so Ling-Ling's mother took care of him for some days. When Ling-Ling's mother and Pan marry, Mao Xiaobing had been sent away to live with relatives by his father because Mao had been a troublemaker. Ling-Ling later recalls the time they were apart as miserable, saying also that the arrival of her younger brother was "disgusting." Despite that, it is later revealed that Ling-Ling learns to accept her younger brother, but the acceptance is short lived. Mao Xiaobing later realizes that she has been watching over her parents, and after tracking down the old couple, he asks why Ling-Ling is now deaf. Recalling the events, Pan explains that Bing-Bing (Ling-Ling's younger brother) had lied to their mother to get Ling-Ling out of the house. Both of them then went up to the rooftop where she and Mao Xiaobing would watch the movies through his binoculars. After saying she would leave, Bing-Bing begs her not to leave, but then falls to the ground. Pan then hits Ling-Ling for her brother's death, leaving her deaf in both ears.   The event severely traumatizes Ling-Ling, and she runs away not too long after. Living alone for so long in the city, she looks around and finds both her parents have moved to the same place, not too far from where she lives now. She finds a puppy and decides to name it after Bing Bing, but she leaves the puppy with her parents to help ease their loneliness. When Mao Xiaobing had accidentally knocked over a pile of bricks, consequently killing the puppy, it triggered Ling-Ling's memories of losing her brother; hence she attacked Mao Xiaobing.   Finding out where the mental institution is, Mao Xiaobing pays Ling-Ling a visit. He reveals his identity by giving back her film strip, and she is reunited with her parents watching an old movie on the same screen she grew up watching.

After knocking him out, she chains him in a cavern infested with rats. As Karan regains consciousness, Sarika tells him how she used to be scared of rats and she chose this spot because she wanted him to go through the pain and suffering that she went through while she was in prison. Karan is baffled at her talk, but she leaves him in the cavern, with light from a flashlight pointing towards him.  Karan screams, but nobody hears as he is in a secluded place. Soon the flashlight goes out and Karan loses strength. The rats attack and kill him brutally (shown by dimming of lights and screams). Karan dies a long and painful death. With her mission of exacting revenge from Karan accomplished, Sarika eventually surrenders to the police, turning in the bag of money that she stole from Karan's boss to the ACP.

Enduring Love (film)
 Joe ([[Daniel Craig]]) has planned an afternoon in the English countryside with his partner, Claire ([[Samantha Morton]]). As they prepare to open a bottle of champagne, a hot air balloon drifts into the field, obviously in trouble. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down. Joe and three other men rush to secure the basket. Just as they grab on, wind rushes into the field, and at once the rescuers are airborne. Joe manages to drop to the ground, as do the others, except for one (Lee Sheward) who is lifted skywards. They watch as the man falls to his death.

Days later, Joe, feeling guilt, spends a lot of time trying to map out ways that could have saved the man. One day, he receives an odd phone call from Jed, telling him to come outside so that they can talk about what happened. Joe looks out the window and sees Jed standing across the road from his house staring up at Joe's window. Joe is reluctant but Jed promises that he will leave Joe alone if he just comes outside and talks to him. After Jed makes some comments that make Joe uneasy, he decides to leave, telling Jed to leave him alone. Not too long after this, Joe visits a local bookshop and out of nowhere Jed makes an appearance, appearing to have followed Joe. Joe is confused and angered by this and tells Jed that he doesn't want to see him at all. Jed is hurt by this and continues to tell Joe to 'be brave' and admit what passed between them at the field. Then Jed leaves Joe and says, "don't let me down, not like you let ''him'' [the man who fell from the balloon] down".  The next time we see Joe is when he is lecturing at the college where he works. At lunch, he sits down with a colleague and then spots Jed sitting at the table next to him. He shouts at Jed, causing a scene when Jed tells him to "be brave" again. Joe tells Jed that all he wants is for Jed to leave him alone, which after hearing this, Jed leaves the restaurant.  Joe then visits the wife of the man who had died and she tells him that she believes that he was having an affair after the police returned a picnic basket for two that was found in his car, along with a unknown woman's scarf. After hearing this, he decides to figure out who was with the man on the day he died.  On Joe's birthday, Claire makes him a special birthday dinner. At dinner, it is clear to see the strain on their relationship. After Claire sees that Joe is lost in thought and not paying her any attention, she angrily clears the table. It is obvious that she is fed up with Joe's behaviour and lack of communication. The next day, Joe goes swimming and sees Jed standing by the window of the pool. Joe asks Jed to meet him in the café. They talk and Joe demands to know why Jed won't leave him alone. Jed, once again, makes Joe uneasy and he leaves.  Later, Joe and Claire are joined by Robin and Rachel, Claire's brother and his new girlfriend. Joe then tells Claire that he had planned to propose to her on the day of the accident. She asks Joe if he's changed his mind and he remains silent. This drives another wedge between them and the evening is ruined.  The next day at Joe's lecture, Jed turns up in the class and sings to Joe. They then go outside and Jed talks about how Joe is sending him signals, using a curtain reference. Joe is confused, tells Jed to leave and then later that night researches the significance between stalkers and "curtain signals". He finally concludes that Jed standing beneath his window every night watches him draw the curtains, thinking that the way they are drawn is a secret message (such as "come and see me", "I love you", or "talk to me"). After explaining this to Claire, he looks out of the window and sees Jed sitting in the park across from his house watching him. Joe asks Claire to come to the window and look at Jed but she, frustrated, goes back to sleep.  The next morning, Claire comes down the stairs and tells Joe that it's over between them. Joe, angry, pays a visit to Jed and they argue. Joe then gets drunk before going to Robin and Rachel's house where he stays the night. When he wakes up, his friend tells him that Claire just called and that Claire had told him to come over as Jed was in their house. Joe races to his house and enters the living room to find Jed and Claire sitting next to each other on the sofa. Jed looks as if he has been beaten up and falsely blames Joe. Claire appears to believe Jed's story. Joe loses his temper and then out of the blue, Jed stabs Claire with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor, bleeding profusely. Joe then pretends to accept Jed into his life and they kiss. As they kiss, Joe grabs hold of the knife from Jed and stabs him. Jed falls to the floor, while Joe rushes to Claire's aid and phones an ambulance.  In the closing scenes, Joe is back on the field where it all started, with the wife and daughter of the man who died. They are joined by a couple who explain that the woman's husband had not cheated on her but was giving the couple a lift in his car. The picnic basket and scarf were theirs, and they were too embarrassed to intercede, as ''they'' were having an affair. The wife is happy to discover the truth and sad that she had believed her husband was cheating. Joe then tells the man's daughter her father was very brave.  After this, Joe is joined by Claire, who survived the stabbing; they are still separated. As they sit on the grass and talk, Joe produces a bottle of champagne and tries to find words to apologize for what happened to them. Claire says, "Don't say anything". It is left to the audience to determine what happens next.  During the ending credits, Jed, who also survived, is shown in a mental institution and appears to be obsessively writing a letter. He looks up at the camera and smiles while the end credits roll.

Employee of the Month (2004 film)
 Dave Walsh ([[Matt Dillon]]) is a bank employee whose day begins badly when he gets fired from his dream job and dumped by his fiancée Sara Goodwin ([[Christina Applegate]]) the day after their engagement party was crashed by his best friend, Jack ([[Steve Zahn]]). Jack tries to console him by telling him that it's for the best, that Dave was headed down the wrong path. In a further effort to console him, Jack arranges for a hooker named Whisper ([[Jenna Fischer]]) to show up at his apartment, but instead she steals his car. The next day, Dave goes back to the bank with a gun tucked into in his waistband. He surreptitiously makes his way into his former boss's office, where he pulls out the gun and threatens to end his boss's life. Though intimidated, the boss stands up to Dave, and Dave, deciding he does not want blood on his hands after all, pistol-whips him instead.   When Dave emerges from his boss's office, he finds the bank being robbed. A sequence shows him killing the robbers single-handedly, but this is then shown to have been a daydream. When one of the robbers seizes his co-worker Wendy ([[Andrea Bendewald]]), he shoots the robber and saves her, but he is shot, tackled, and forced into the getaway vehicle, whereupon the robbers make their escape.  A montage shows various people's reactions to the incident, including that of Dave's ex-fiancée Sara (who is crying uncontrollably), and then a burning van. A reporter announces that dental records have shown that the body found in the van was Dave's. A complex series of plot twists follows. It turns out that the robbery had actually been part of plan hatched two years ago, by Dave and his friends Jack, Wendy, and Eric ([[Dave Foley]]), to rob the bank and fake Dave's death, erasing his identity so that he would not be caught, and leaving him and his friends filthy rich. Eric, who is Sara's dentist, is revealed to have driven the getaway vehicle and falsified the dental records of the corpse in the van. Dave, Wendy, and Jack meet up in a motel room, prepared to divide their loot and part ways. When Wendy leaves the room, however, Dave kills Jack. (It turns out that Dave had secretly hated Jack ever since Jack scarred Dave's face and torso extensively in a childhood accident.) Wendy returns and kills Dave. She grabs the money and runs off to pick up Sara, with whom it turns out she's involved in a lesbian relationship. (Sara, for her part, had previously gone to Eric's office, killed him, and taken his share of the money.) After the credits, Sara and Wendy's car is shown being hit by a bus.

The murder of Bhavani's father, is wrongly accused on SP's father. He starts to help Bhavani's family and mortgages his own house to finance her factory with the intention of making it up to them as he still believes that it's his father who killed Bhavani's father. But Bhavani is now trying to take revenge for her father's murder. SP's mother is now on her deathbed. While in the hospital, his mom tells how his father had a different wife and he should ask them forgiveness. He storms into Bhavani's house and accuses her uncle (who really killed Bhavni's dad), also trying to make her understand the truth but she doesn't believe him. Then Prabhakaran says he doesn't love her any more and vows that he will never trust a woman by remaining a chronic bachelor forever.  Then film comes to the present time showing a legal battle between Prabhakaran (now called SP) and Bhavani. Bhavani becomes furious when SP wins the legal battle to get back his house. She threatens to destroy SP. From here, the story moves to the day-to-day life of SP and falls into a comic track throughout the first half. SP is now a successful businessman.

SP agrees to take care of Kannan (Prabhu Deva). He is the son of Manivannan, his uncle who had helped SP to become a successful businessman. Prabhu Deva is a flirt and womanizer so his mother wants SP to take care of him and change his behaviours for the better. But what SP and his mother doesn't know is that Kannan has only agreed to stay in the house when he comes to know that Parvathi lives next door to SP and in order too woo her. Comical scenes recur throughout the movie, where Mayilu, who doesn't like Kannan and his friend Cheenu (Pandiya Rajan) staying with them, tries to get them out of the house. Gowri comes to know SP is sponsoring Parvathi's studies and confronts him. SP tells her that Parvathi is his sister. Gowri then asks Parvathi to call SP for her birthday party. But SP gets upset and confronts Gowri. Gowri then reveals that her sponsor was SP all the while. During the birthday party, Bhavani comes and takes Gowri away. Then it becomes clear that Gowri is Bhavani's sister. Rivalry arises between Gowri and Bhavani. Parvathi starts showing affection towards Kannan but says it's wrong and walks away. At this time, Bhavani's brother and his gang come to kidnap her. While rescuing Parvathi from Bhavani's brother, Kannan decides to bring Gowri back too. Then Gowri's family members come to take her forcefully, but is stopped by Kannan. When told off by SP for doing so, he tells Mayil that he will sponsor the girl that loves SP like how SP sponsors the girl that he loves.  That's when SP asks Parvathi to move to his house. Kannan and Cheenu are moved to the guest house. Parvathi shows affection to Kannan. One day SP and Mayilu catch Kannan trying to reach Parvathi through the balcony. That is where SP knows that both of them love each other. He tells Kannan to promise that he will never look at another girl in his life and she (being Parvathi) should be the only one, which Kannan agrees to whole-heartedly. He fixes the marriage of Kannan and Parvathi. He transfers everything he has to Parvathi's name because Kannan's family thought Parvathi was an orphan. SP tells everything to Kannan's parents which is overheard by Parvathi who runs home crying. SP upset runs to comfort her, where he explains how he will live his life as an apology to her mother's curses. But Parvathi tells that her mother loved him and told her to ask forgiveness if she sees him. Now Parvathi and SP re-unite as siblings. During the marriage festivities, Bhavani and her brother come to prevent the celebrations. Along with them comes the elder brother of Sandhya, Veerapandi. He challenges SP, saying that he has more right over Parvathi as he is her brother, while SP is just a stepbrother. Veerapandi then claims all of SP's property, which SP is willing to give, provided Parvathi lives happily and marries Kannan. Bhavani's household members uses Veerapandi to take advantage of SP; first by trying to snatch his company then trying to snatch his home. In the brawl, SP vows that Parvathi will marry Kannan and he will wipe off everyone who stands in the way. Bhavani then tells SP that Parvathi will be married off to Bhavani's brother. Veerapandi supports in the name of revenge.  Parvathi, torn between two brothers, comes running when the brothers fight among themselves on the account of who Parvathi will marry. She says she wants to be happy with both her brothers so to stop fighting. Parvathi has been emotionally forced to marry Bhavani's brother. She is rescued by Prabhu Deva, Mayilu and Cheenu. SP goes and pours kerosine on Bhavani to get her husband to tell the truth and he finally admits that it was him and his dad. He says how his father has done it for the money but he done it because he loved her and she was his life. Bhavani realizes her mistakes and goes to SP's house to apologize. But she tells SP that only thing she can now offer is the marriage proposal of her sister Gowri to SP. SP initially refuses when Kannan tells that he'll also remain bachelor if SP doesn't marry.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
 [[File:Montauk LIRR train station.jpg|thumb|Train station of Montauk where Joel and Clementine meet each other again after erasing of their memories.|alt=]] Shy, soft-spoken Joel Barish and unrestrained free-spirit Clementine Kruczynski begin a relationship on a [[Long Island Rail Road]] train from [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]] to [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]]. They are almost immediately drawn to each other, despite their contrasting personalities, and both had felt the need to travel to Montauk that day. Although they do not realize it, Joel and Clementine are former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine had hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to [[Memory erasure|erase all her memories]] of their relationship. Upon discovering this from his friends Rob and Carrie, Joel was devastated and decided to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps.  Much of the film subsequently takes place in Joel's mind, during this memory erasure procedure. Joel finds himself revisiting his memories of Clementine [[reverse chronology|in reverse]], starting from the disintegration of their relationship. As he comes across happier, positive memories of Clementine early in his relationship, he decides to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her, trying to evade the procedure by taking his idealized memory of Clementine into [[False memory|memories not related to her]] or waking up to stop the process. Despite his efforts, the memories are steadily erased. He comes to the last remaining memory of Clementine, the day he had first met her at a beach house in Montauk. As this memory disintegrates around them, she tells him, "Meet me in Montauk."  Separate, but related, story arcs revolving around the employees of Lacuna are revealed during Joel's memory erasure. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, uses Joel's memories and mannerisms to seduce and romance Clementine. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan, but has feelings for Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, a married doctor and the head of Lacuna. During Joel's memory wipe, Mary discovers she had previously had an affair with Dr. Mierzwiak and agreed to have this erased from her memory when Dr. Mierzwiak's wife found out. On learning this, she asks Stan whether he knew about this, to which he claims that he didn't. Mary then quits her job and steals the company's records, mailing them to all of Lacuna's customers out of revenge.  The film returns to the present after Joel and Clementine have met at the train station of Montauk. They both come upon their Lacuna records later that day, and react with shock and bewilderment – they have no clear memory of having known each other, let alone having had a relationship and having had their memories erased. Joel pleads with Clementine to restart their relationship; Clementine initially resists, pointing out it could go the same way. Joel accepts this and they decide to try anyway.

After Tim's wife Debbie ([[Rachel Weisz]]) and children temporarily leave and he is fired from 3M, Tim's jealousy reaches new levels.

Tim accidentally shoots him in the back with an arrow and J-Man, believing that Tim has tried to kill him, backs down in fear.  Tim eventually confesses all to Nick who forgives him for his jealousy and agrees to continue with the partnership; however, at a press conference for Natalie's electoral campaign (where she promises to withdraw her candidacy if it is proven Vapoorize is harmful to the environment in any way), Corky's body is seen floating down the nearby river. The animal's [[post-mortem]] reveals that the horse was not killed by the arrow as previously thought but actually [[poison]]ed by a by-product of Vapoorize, used by Tim to treat his garden after Corky came to eat the apples off of his tree. The [[veterinarian]] informs the pair that she is obliged to notify the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], and Vapoorize is immediately pulled from the market. Nick and Tim almost lose all their wealth and glory, until Tim comes up with an invention of his own: Pocket Flan, inspired by Nick's family's love for [[crème caramel|the dessert]].

Eulogy (film)
 The film opens with Kate Collins walking up to a house. She knocks and a woman answers the door. Kate explains that although she doesn't know her she has a long story to explain.  The story begins with the death of her grandfather, Edmund Collins. The movie then goes on to show how all the family members found out about the death, and how they came together for the funeral. As the Collins family joins their widowed mother/grandmother, Charlotte Collins, the family's dysfunctions and idiosyncrasies come to light. Kate's father, Daniel Collins, is an "[[Pornographic film|obscure foreign film]]" actor whose career peaked at age 8 when he appeared in a peanut butter commercial. Kate's uncle, Skip Collins, is an overly hormonal father of overly hormonal twin sons (Fred and Ted) who managed to run their mother out of their family. Kate's aunt, Lucy Collins, and her girlfriend Judy Arnolds are both criticised throughout the movie because of their relationship. Most of this criticism comes from Kate's other aunt, Alice Collins. The bossy, intimidating Alice has managed to both raise her three children and drive her husband into submissive silence, because of her persistent talking and badgering. Once they all arrive at the only family home  Kate is told by Charlotte that her grandfather wished for her to give the [[eulogy]] at the funeral.  After a family dinner that goes south when Lucy and Judy announce that they are getting married, tired of the family feuding, Charlotte tries to commit suicide by overdosing on a medication. While the family sits in the waiting room they run into Samantha, a nurse at the hospital who is also an old friend of Alice's. After having her stomach pumped and after rejoining the family, she tries again by jumping out of a moving van on a bridge and although she does not die, she is seriously injured and spends the remainder of the movie in a wheelchair.  During the film, Kate continually tries to come up with a eulogy while dealing with a previous romance with Ryan, from whom she ran away after being caught by Ryan's mother who came home while Ryan and Kate were having sex. Kate gets reacquainted with Ryan (after trying to dodge him several times around town) and their relationship reignites.  At Edmund's [[Will (law)|will reading]], it is revealed that Edmund has three families that don't know about each other. This explains Edmund's inability to keep names and number of children straight over the years before also dropping the bomb that he was up to his "prostate in debt". Kate is tasked with finding and telling the other two families of Edmund's demise.  Ultimately, per Edmund's will, he is placed in a casket and floated out on a local lake in a boat. Ted and Fred, having previously filled the casket with [[gasoline]], start shooting fiery arrows from a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] at the casket. During this time Kate finally gives her eulogy. One of the arrows eventually hits the casket and a moment later the casket, completely unexpectedly, explodes in a fiery explosion and completely demolishes the boat, body, and casket in a splintery mess.  The movie ends with Kate talking to the woman from the beginning of the film. The woman explains she is not actually the person she was looking for but rather her neighbor.

Exorcist: The Beginning
  The film opens with a bloodied and terrified priest slowly making his way across an ancient battlefield full of the bodies of thousands of dead soldiers. The priest reaches the dead body of another priest and tries to take a small demon idol of the head of [[Pazuzu]] from his hand, but suddenly, the dead priest briefly comes back to life and stops the living priest from taking it. The camera pulls back to reveal that the entire valley is littered with dead soldiers, many of whom have been [[Cross of Saint Peter|crucified upside down]].  The film then cuts to [[Cairo, Egypt]] in 1949, where the young Father Lankester Merrin (played by Skarsgård, who played the same part in ''[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist]]'') has taken a sabbatical from the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and devoted himself to history and archaeology as he struggles with his shattered faith. He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in the [[Netherlands in World War II#German occupation|occupied Netherlands]] during [[World War II]], where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter.  After World War II, Merrin is an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] in [[Cairo]], when he is approached by a collector of antiquities named Semelier who asks him to come to a British excavation in a valley called Derati in the [[Turkana region]] of [[Kenya]]. This dig is excavating a [[Christian]] [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]-era [[Church (building)|church]] built circa 500 A.D. — long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. Semelier asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon, thought to be in the church, before the British can find it; small head of the Pazuzu idol.  Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] scholar who was on his way to do missionary work in [[East Africa]] but was diverted by the Vatican to ensure the church is not desecrated.  Upon arriving at the site, Merrin meets Major Granville, the [[British Army]] officer in charge of the dig. Merrin also meets the chief excavator, a brutish man named Jefferies with visible [[Boil|boils]] on his face. He also meets Sarah Novak, a doctor who spent time in a concentration camp during World War II and is haunted by what happened to her there. Merrin's translator and guide is Chuma. In addition, Merrin learns that the diggers are disappearing or leaving in droves because the local tribesmen fear the church is cursed. Merrin witnesses a digger inexplicably experience a seizure.  Merrin visits the dig site. Only the [[dome]] is uncovered; the rest of the church is buried beneath the earth. Merrin discovers that the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been buried immediately after its construction was completed. Merrin, Francis, and Chuma enter the church through the dome. They find it in near-pristine condition, but there are two oddities. First, all of the statues of the angels holding weapons are pointing the spears downward, whereas it is conventional for statues of angels to either have no weapons or to point them triumphantly toward heaven. Merrin and Francis deduce the sculptors were trying to depict the angels restraining something that was beneath the church. The second disturbing discovery is that someone has vandalized the church by ripping the enormous crucifix from its place on the altar and suspending it with Christ on the cross in an upside-down position, which is considered a desecration.  Merrin is determined to learn more about the archaeological dig and asks to consult with the lead archaeologist, Monsieur Bession. Sarah tells Merrin that Bession went insane three weeks earlier and was transferred to a mental hospital in [[Nairobi]]. Merrin visits Bession's tent at the dig site and sees dozens of drawings of the same thing, the demon artifact the collector had asked Merrin to find. Merrin then travels to Nairobi to visit Bession, but when he enters Bession's room, he discovers Bession has carved a [[swastika]] on his chest and is speaking through demonic possession in the voice of the sadistic SS commander who tormented Merrin during the war. As Merrin registers these events, Bession slashes his own throat after saying he was "free." Father Gionetti, warden of the asylum, speculates that Bession was not [[Demonic possession|possessed]] but rather "touched" by a demon, which drove him mad and eventually to suicide. Merrin is very skeptical, but before he returns to the dig site, Father Gionetti gives him the volume of Roman rituals to use in exorcism, although Merrin claims he will never use them.  Upon returning to the village, strange events continue. A local boy is attacked and killed by [[Hyena|hyenas]] that seem to continuously stalk the dig, night and day. His younger brother, Joseph, enters a fugue state after watching his brother get ripped to pieces. The local chief's wife gives birth to a stillborn baby who is covered in [[maggot]]s. Around the same time Merrin discovers a passageway leading to a cave underneath the church that houses an ancient pagan temple with the statue of the demon Pazuzu. He also finds evidence that this temple was used to conduct human sacrifices. Upon his return, he sees the local tribe cremate the stillborn baby. This makes Merrin suspicious, because there are stories of an epidemic that wiped out an entire village in the valley 50 years earlier. He had been told that the dead were buried in a graveyard just outside the valley. When he digs up one of the graves of the supposed victims of this plague, it is found to be empty.  Merrin confronts Father Francis about it, and Francis reveals to him the history of the Derati valley and the real reason he was sent there. He says that 1,500 years prior, a [[Byzantine army|great army]] led by two priests came to the valley searching for the origin of evil. When they arrived in the valley, the evil presence consumed them and they killed each other. When the lone surviving priest made it back, [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] ordered a church be built over the site, specifically the pagan temple, and then buried to seal the evil force inside of it. Father Francis reveals to Merrin that the builders of the church never meant it to be recorded in Vatican documents, however, a vague reference to it was recorded and found in 1893. Four priests subsequently came to Derati and enlisted the local tribe to help them. All of the tribesmen and the priests disappeared. The Vatican then ordered that the false graveyard be built and stories of a plague spread around to keep people away from the valley. Then the British just so happened to stumble upon the site. Francis then reveals that the Vatican sent him to see if the legend was true. When Merrin asks about the legend, Francis reveals that it is believed that the valley in Derati was the traditional spot of [[Lucifer]]'s fall after the war in heaven.  At the end of the film, the dig's doctor, Sarah, turns out to be the possessed individual and she kills Francis. Merrin has the demon exorcised from her in the tunnels below the church but she dies. Fr. Merrin and Joseph emerge from the church, (once again buried in sand) and [[Historic recurrence|history has repeated itself]]. Everyone at the site was killed by an evil presence from the church, except for one priest. Now, only Father Merrin and the little boy are left as the British soldiers and the local tribes have annihilated each other. Merrin returns to [[Rome]] and meets with Semelier at a cafe, explaining he was unable to find the relic, Semelier replies, "But you found something....Didn't you?" As he leaves, Merrin is revealed to be wearing a collar and is now a priest again, having regained his faith in God, after defeating the demon with holy exorcism rituals.

For years, Evilenko eludes Lesiev and psychiatrist Aron Richter, who is assigned to [[offender profiling|profile]] the killer.

Almost eight years later, Lesiev finally captures Evilenko, who by now has killed 55 people, mostly children and young women. On 22 May 1992, Evilenko goes to court, and on 14 February 1994, he is finally executed. Before his execution, several governments expressed interest in Evilenko's psychic abilities and asked for extradition of Evilenko but were denied.

Fighter in the Wind
 At the tail-end of [[World War II]], [[Mas Oyama|Choi Bae-dal]] is a young Korean man who longs to be able to fly fighter planes. Stowing away to Japan in order to join their air force, Bae-dal's first experience of the country is when a [[confidence trickster|con-man]] tries to steal his money. Bae-dal discovers that the man is a fellow Korean called Chun-bae ([[Jung Tae-woo]]), who has survived the harsh treatment of Koreans in Japan by turning to petty crime. With their different motives: Bae-dal driven by desire for action and Chun-bae needing to escape from some gangsters, the two Koreans stow away in a truck to the air force training camp.  The commander in charge of the camp is a pompous imperialist called Kato ([[Masaya Kato]]). Having mistreated the two Koreans, he is amused by Bae-dal's fighting spirit and says that if Bae-dal can beat him with his inferior "foreign" [[Taekkyeon|fighting style]], he will release them. The two men fight with Kato easily defeating Bae-dal, but an [[United States of America|American]] attack on the airforce base allows Bae-dal and Chun-bae to escape.  Later, Bae-dal is found helping Chun-bae to run a [[pachinko]] stall in a Japanese market place. When local [[yakuza|gangsters]] try to take protection money from Chun-bae, Bae-dal tries to defend him but is beaten up and humiliated by the gangsters. His ordeal is ended by the intervantion of Bum-soo ([[Jung Doo-hong]]), a martial arts expert from his home town who had also emigrated to Japan. Bum-soo invites Bae-dal back to the circus where he, and many fellow Korean immigrants, work and where he is attempting to build a decent standard of living for his countrymen. After some persuasion, he agrees to teach Bae-dal some of his more sophisticated fighting style.  Meanwhile, Bae-dal has taken to working as a rickshaw driver, honing his fighting skills by defending Japanese women from the rapacious advances of American servicemen. His success at protecting the women makes him something of a local hero, although his real identity is not known. One of the women he protects is the beautiful Yoko ([[Aya Hirayama]]), with whom he strikes up a romantic relationship.  When Bum-soo is killed by local gangsters, the Koreans from the compound vow revenge and attack the Japanese gangs. The fight ends abruptly for Bae-dal when he is knocked unconscious by a blow to the head. Bae-dal, vowing to never again lose a fight, retreats to the mountains where, living in his [[karate gi]], he trains day and night; running in the mountains, lifting tree trunks and using makeshift training equipment to harden his body and fighting spirit through austerity.  Returning from the mountains, Bae-dal takes a Japanese name: Masutatsu Oyama, and sets about challenging the best fighters Japan has to offer. Wearing his ragged karate gi and looking like a cave-man with his unkempt appearance, Oyama challenges the first [[dojo]] he passes. He defeats every fighter in the dojo - often with only a single strike.  As word of his notoriety spreads, Oyama's actions come to the attention of the head of the [[Japan Karate Association]] - the former Air Force camp commander Kato. Kato is hugely offended that a foreigner would not only try to learn Japanese martial arts, but would consider himself worthy to beat Japanese fighters. Nevertheless, Oyama continues to defeat every fighter that Japan has to offer, including competitors in [[karate]], [[judo]], [[ninjutsu]], [[aikido]], and [[Okinawan kobudō|kobudo]], becoming a sensation in the Japanese media. Oyama explains to Yoko that, although he is scared of dying, he is more scared of living as a cripple, and this is why he is willing to sacrifice anything to win.  When the organization sends one of his followers to challenge and kill Oyama, the agent is instead killed by Oyama. Learning that the man he killed had a wife and son, Oyama feels a great deal of guilt for his actions and tracks down the family to apologise and offer to work for them to make up for killing the father of the household. Oyama surrenders his uniform to the wife, vowing to never again fight in martial art duels. Although initially angry and unaccepting of Oyama's offer, after fulfilling the son's wish of being carried to the top of the nearby mountain to view the sunrise, he eventually convinces them that he is a man of honour and not a violent thug. The wife asks Oyama to take back his uniform and become the best fighter in Japan.  Returning to the city, Oyama finds that Kato's martial arts association has threatened his own family (Kato is not involved) and demanded a challenge between Kato and Oyama. Dressing in his weathered gi once again, Oyama treks out to the countryside location where Kato is waiting for him. Easily defeating Kato's henchmen, Oyama then faces a final showdown with Kato himself. Although it is clear that Kato would like to see Oyama dead, Kato's ankle is broken after receiving a kick in the fight sequence. When Kato stands up, he falls to a one-knee-down position, Oyama shows mercy to Kato, by stopping 2&nbsp;cm short of punching him squarely between the eyes, defeating him in combat but not killing him.  At the end of the movie, Oyama is shown fighting with a bull, grasping the horns and digging into the ground to stop him, and finally delivering a bone-shattering chop to the center of the top of the head.  
Feng Shui (2004 film)
 While on a bus, Joy Ramirez ([[Kris Aquino]]) finds a package left by a man. She visits Aling Biring (Luz Fernandez) at the bakery and shows her the package: an antique [[bagua]] mirror. Following Chinese belief, Aling Biring thinks that the mirror will drive away evil spirits and bring good luck to her husband Inton ([[Jay Manalo]]) and their children Denton ([[John Manalo|John Vladimir Manalo]]) and Ingrid (Julianne Gomez).   Joy places the bagua mirror in her home and a series of fortunate events happens: her friend Alice ([[Lotlot de Leon]]) grants her a promotion and she wins the grand prize at a grocery store. Soon, Joy becomes suspicious of how she became so lucky.   The next day, Joy learns that the man Evart Mendoza, who left the mirror in the bus, was run over by a [[Philippine Rabbit|Rabbit Liner bus]]. She discovers that he was born in the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|year of the Rabbit]] after she examines his age. Later, Joy learns that Aling Biring died from [[leptospirosis]] that morning and that she was born on the [[Rat (zodiac)|year of the Rat]].  Joy notices her husband reconciling with his former lover Dina ([[Jenny Miller]]) at work. Denton's neighbor Billy (Ernesto Sto. Tomas) tells Joy about the omens in the neighborhood and the deaths occurring in their neighborhood. Joy sees her tricycle driver Mang Nestor, who was killed earlier in a [[cockfight]]. Nestor is revealed to be born in the [[Rooster (zodiac)|year of the Rooster]]. She is later haunted by the ghosts of Nestor, Biring, Evart, and a woman. Their deaths seem to be connected to the Chinese zodiac of their birth year. Joy visits Evart's wife Lily ([[Cherry Pie Picache]]) and she tells her about the mirror's history.   When Lily was still working as a real estate agent, she found the bagua mirror from an old rental house. As it brought her good luck it also left deaths. Lily tells Joy that now that she is the owner of the mirror, it would bring her both good fortune and a curse. She urges Joy to give the bagua mirror back, but Joy refuses and leaves. Later, after Joy accepts an inheritance from her late client, she learns that the security guard, whose reflection he had seen in the bagua mirror, has been found dead after being bitten by a snake. The security guard was found to be born on the [[Snake (zodiac)|year of the Snake]].  Joy, along with Alice and their friend Thelma (Ilonah Jean), seeks help from a [[feng shui]] expert Hsui Liao ([[Joonee Gamboa]]). Liao tells them that the bagua mirror was once owned by the children of a rich Chinese family from [[Shanghai]]. During the revolution of [[Sun Yat-sen]], his colleagues and other rich families were evacuated. The brother and his family left, leaving behind his [[Foot binding|foot-bounded]] sister, nicknamed "Lotus Feet", stating she is a burden. Her nickname refers to the Chinese tradition of binding the feet of young girls to keep it small. Her servants betrayed her and killed her by burning her at the stake. Before she died, she took the bagua mirror and placed a curse where in she will take the soul of anyone who stares at the mirror. Liao warns Joy that if she tries to destroy the mirror, the soul of the owner will be taken away before it restores itself.  Before they leave, Alice realizes that she had glanced at the mirror earlier. Joy then confronts her husband about his affair. Joy remembers that when she accepted the prize she had won from the grocery store earlier, she and her family had witnessed a robbery from Billy's house which resulted in a gunfight. The robbery suspect was born in the [[Monkey (zodiac)|year of the Monkey]], revealing that Alice was next. After an argument, Alice, who was born in the [[Horse (zodiac)|year of the Horse]], was killed when she landed on the crates of [[Red Horse Beer]] bottles after she was attacked by her drunken neighbor who pushed her out of the window. The ghosts of all the victims haunt Joy's house and her family is forced to leave. Joy attempts to destroy the mirror, but is stopped by Alice's ghost. Joy eventually faints, overwhelmed with all the ghosts.  The next morning, Master Liao calls Joy and tells her the key to end the curse: she must reject offers of good luck so that she would be able to destroy the mirror and save the next victim. Just before they leave, Billy gets involved in an accident and Joy volunteers for a blood transfusion to save him. She then realizes that Inton is the next victim.  Joy arrives at the motel where Inton and Dina are but she arrives too late. As they are attempting to flee, they are shot and killed by Louie, Dina's husband. Both Inton and Dina were born in the [[Dog (zodiac)|year of the Dog]]. Louie tries to kill Joy but she pleads and tells him that both of them were cheated on by their spouses. Louie spares her as he shoots himself.   Later, Joy calls Thelma about what happened. Thelma took Denton and Ingrid with her in the hopes of taking them to Joy. Thelma sees a truck of cows and chickens in front of her car. She comes to the realization that Ingrid was born in the [[Ox (zodiac)|year of the Ox]], and Denton and herself were both born on the [[Rooster (zodiac)|year of the Rooster]]. Horrified, Thelma tries to alert the truck but an oncoming vehicle speeds towards them.   Joy arrives home and was greeted by Attorney Regalado, a lawyer sent by Lily to offer Joy the chance of returning the bagua mirror to her in exchange for money. Joy refuses the offer. Distraught by the string of deaths that followed her, Joy finally destroys the mirror. Thelma arrives with Denton and Ingrid. Joy is filled with relief thinking that she has finally broken the curse and saved her kids but she soon discovers that they were all killed earlier in the truck accident along with Thelma after she saw her dead husband joining with them as Joy screams.  A family is shown moving into their new house and the family's twin daughters wander into Joy's former home while playing. They find the restored bagua mirror and decide to show it to their parents. From Joy's house's window, the Lotus Lady watches over them, awaiting her next victim.  
Fida
 Somebody empties the bank accounts of many people, including Babu Anna ([[Akhilendra Mishra]]), an underworld don, via an Internet theft. The police are clueless about the robber, and Anna wants revenge. In another story, Jai Malhotra ([[Shahid Kapoor]]) lives with his best friend, Sonia ([[Kim Sharma]]). He meets Neha Mehra ([[Kareena Kapoor]]) and falls in love with her instantly. At first Neha rejects Jai, causing him to attempt suicide. After Sonia chastises Neha regarding Jai's actions, she then falls for him too.  One day, Jai sees Neha trying to hang herself after getting a phone call. She tells him that her dead father owed a huge amount of money to Babu Anna's underworld. To repay the amount, he became part of a gang of hackers who were responsible for the Internet thefts. After his death, Babu's Anna underworld began pursuing Neha to recover the money. Jai and Neha try to sell their apartments to get enough money, to no avail. A visit from a client leads Jai to consider robbing a bank to get the necessary money. At a bank, Jai spots a rich man named Vikram Singh ([[Fardeen Khan]]) withdrawing a huge sum of money and instead decides to steal from him. However, Vikram catches Jai during his attempts to break into his house.  Instead of reporting Jai to the police, Vikram demands an explanation for his actions. Upon learning the whole story, Vikram reveals that he is the hacker behind the internet thefts but agrees to help Jai. In return, Jai has to take the blame for the thefts. Jai agrees, gives the money to Neha and turns himself in. Jai is escorted by police to be presented for the trial, but Anna has his men intercept them to kidnap Jai. A shootout results between the gang and police as Jai is able to escape and runs to Neha's apartment, only to find both Neha and Vikram waiting for him. He is horrified to learn that they conspired against him to steal all the money and Neha's love was just a ruse to con him to take a fall.  Jai escapes from the apartment, but is shot off a train by a police officer. Even though his body is not found, he is presumed dead. Two months later, Neha and Vikram start getting anonymous phone calls. Neha believes that the calls are from Jai and that he is still alive. Jai, who is very much alive, is bent on getting revenge on both Neha and Vikram.  Jai makes life miserable for both Vikram and Neha. One day when Neha and Vikram go out for a movie, Vikram finds Neha hanging by her neck in the toilet, and Neha confirms that Jai is alive. Vikram out of rage tracks Jai down and severely beats him up, threatening to murder him if he comes back into their lives again. Vikram then reports Jai to Babu Anna, thus giving him a whiff of the affair. This does not deter Jai as he later blackmails Vikram by kidnapping Neha, forcing him to turn himself in. Vikram obliges and is lead to Neha; however, all three are intercepted and taken hostage by Babu Anna and his gang, demanding all his money from them. Jai cleverly deflects Anna and forces Vikram to transfer Anna's money back into his account. Catching them off guard, Jai and Vikram finish Anna and his gang.  In the melee, Vikram has Jai cornered but Jai finally overpowers him. However, Neha strikes Jai hard from behind, allowing Vikram to gun Jai down. Vikram and Neha mock Jai as they watch him struggle with his fatal injuries. Jai stuns the two by rising with Babu Anna's gun and shoots Neha in the forehead, killing her instantly, to Vikram's horror. Jai collapses and boasts about settling the score for once whilst finally succumbing to his injuries, leaving Vikram alone to grieve over Neha's corpse. Later, a news reporter reveals that somebody has made a very hefty and generous donation to the Missionary Charity Fund, whilst Vikram is shown heading out in a boat. Thus it is implied that Vikram gave away all of Babu Anna's money to charity as he no longer has any good use for it.  
Fear of Clowns
  Lynn Blodgett, an artist with [[coulrophobia]], has a nightmare in which she is a young girl and encounters a clown with a decomposing face after a car crash at a [[carnival]]. Lynn's nightmares have been getting worse since she filed for divorce from her husband, Doctor Bert Tokyo, who hit her upon getting the news, and is fighting for full custody of their son, Nicholas. One night, a shirtless clown ("Shivers") with black eyes and a [[battle axe]] gazes at Lynn's house, then walks away. In the morning, Lynn is told that a family living near where she was [[house sitting]] was massacred.  At a gallery exhibiting her work, most of which involves monstrous clowns, Lynn meets Tucker Reid, a roller coaster tycoon who purchases one of her paintings for $8000. Tuck invites Lynn to his office, and after the tour, the two are attacked by a mugger, Heston, but escape. Lynn is shaken by the attempted robbery, but brushes off Tuck's offer to stay at her house. Lynn answers a call from the gallery owner and faints after spotting Shivers standing on her patio. The gallery owner then calls the police, who later question Lynn and dismiss her story.  At the gallery, Lynn reluctantly accepts an offer of $20,000 to do a portrait of a man's father, a clown and convicted child molester. Elsewhere, Shivers is tormented by voices, which tell him that he will get better if he continues to terrorize Lynn. Lynn meets with Bert and his lawyer, who state that Bert not only wants custody of Nicholas, but also wants child support, and half the rights and profits to all the paintings that Lynn has created and sold since they married. It is also revealed that Bert has been out of work for six months, and has been lying about being preoccupied with his job.  Shivers stalks Lynn as she is walking with Tuck, and later murders Lynn's friend Amanda. Lynn is contacted by Detective Peters, who tells her about Amanda's death, and that he now believes her story about being scared by a clown, as grease paint was found under Amanda's nails, and in a colorful pattern on one of her windows. In a parking lot, Bert meets with Heston, who he has hired to kill Lynn so he can collect [[life insurance]]. Heston successfully badgers Bert into giving him more money, due to the complications caused by Shivers and the police. Bert visits Shivers, who is revealed to be Doug Richardson, a former patient of his, a sex offender with [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]]. Worried that Shivers will wreck his plans, Bert orders him to leave Lynn alone.  Ignoring Bert, Shivers sends a party clown to Lynn's house to distract the guard, who he beheads, spotting Heston nearby as he does so. When Shivers leaves, Heston breaks into Lynn's home, and is shot with his own gun during a struggle with Lynn and Tuck, who had stopped by to check on Lynn. At the Tokyo residence, Shivers murders Bert, due to Bert trying to have Heston assassinate Lynn, and thus almost ruining Shivers's chance to be "cured". While the authorities are content with believing that Heston was Shivers, Lynn is unconvinced. Nevertheless, she decides to go out on a date to a theatre with Tuck to celebrate being paid $100,000 for the painting she was hired to do.  Shivers continues his mission of trying to rid himself of his [[schizophrenia]] through Lynn. He kills her boss, abducts Nicholas after dismembering his babysitter, and breaks into the theatre, where he butchers two employees. As Shivers pursues Lynn and Tuck, Detective Peters races to the theatre, having gotten an alert about a 911 call from it, and news that the DNA under Amanda's fingernails matches Doug. Shivers uses Nicholas to lure Lynn out, and as the clown is about to kill her, Tuck blinds him from a [[projectionist]] booth, incapacitating him long enough for Peters and other officers to arrive, and arrest him.  Lynn goes home, and has a nightmare about Shivers escaping from prison, and attacking her and Nicholas.  
The Fever (2004 film)
 The film follows the [[existential crisis]] of an unnamed urban sophisticate ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]) who becomes aware of the nature of world politics, economic exploitation and the vapid [[consumerism]] around her. A series of events lead her to visit an unnamed [[third world]] country, representing an exotic location somewhere in [[Eastern Europe]], where the entire economy and populace are geared towards the tourist industry. Even as she enjoys the rare taste of its products she is made starkly aware of the reality behind the façade by a journalist ([[Michael Moore]]) who, subsequently, suggests a visit to the country's war-torn neighbour in order to experience a true picture of life in the region. She does so and her life is changed forever.  Once back, and now acutely attuned to the world about her, she can no longer fit back into her old [[Elitism|elitist]] and [[Conspicuous consumption|consumer]]-driven lifestyle; watching operas, discussing art and theatre with friends, shopping for "beautiful things" and aggrandizing her  trifling everyday struggles, all seem meaningless to her compared with her recent [[Macroscopic|macro]] epiphany. Compared with the global struggle for existence, her life begins to feel insignificant. Having lived in the bubble her guilt-free, pleasure-filled, life she is now challenged to look beyond comfort and soon finds herself in the throes of a moral dilemma, questioning the moral consistency of her own life and the choices that have affected the lives of the poor in far corners of the globe. She feels that she cannot be truly free having apprehended this new reality, which confronts her blindness to  the harsh truths of the class struggle and her sense of [[entitlement]], which had, in the past, been broken, only occasionally, by displays of sympathy.  She returns to the war-torn nation to explore her feelings further, this new reality now drawing her ever-deeper. This leads to a [[Delirium|delirious]] bout of fever in a run-down hotel where her inner-self challenges her need for comfort and entitlement, culminating in a moment of [[spiritual awakening]] and a perceived 'oneness' with all reality. Finally she sees the truth about her own life and her innate connection with every human being, apprehending the transient nature of her material life. She can no longer sit, immersed in her personal comforts and vanity, or "clean sheets" as she terms it, and pretend it’s all right when the world around her is filled with strife and exploitation for millions of people. She is lustrated of her previous immunity towards their predicament and is, by extension, finally able to see the truth of own life, as summarised by film's tag-line: ''Enlightenment Can Be Brutal''.<ref name=new/><ref>[http://store.hbo.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2885302&cp=&keywords=The+Fever&searchId=31457675213&parentPage=search  The Fever] ''[[HBO Films]]''.</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Fever-Vanessa-Redgrave/dp/B000QUCNOA The Fever (2004)] ''[[Amazon.com]]''.</ref><ref>[http://turnerclassic.moviesunlimited.com/Product.asp?sku=D94600 The Fever]  ''Turner classic''.</ref>

First Daughter (2004 film)
 Samantha MacKenzie ([[Katie Holmes]]) is the only daughter of United States president John MacKenzie ([[Michael Keaton]]).  Because of her father's political career, she has been in the public eye her entire life and spent most of her high school years in the White House.  Having to deal with lack of privacy and public scrutiny for the most ridiculous things, Samantha has had a sheltered existence and her father has trouble letting her have more freedom yet is too busy to spend time with her.  Though her mother Melanie is supportive, she still stands by her husband's decisions, leaving Samantha feeling restricted from having a normal life.  Accompanied by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents everywhere she goes, Samantha finally believes she has the chance to break out of her cocoon when she is given the opportunity to attend college in California.  In California, Samantha ends up sharing a dorm with boy-crazed Mia Thompson, who finds it difficult when Samantha steals her spotlight, and they form a begrudging partnership.  She becomes interested in James Lansome, a college student and Sam's student advisor, since he does not treat her differently because of her father.  Unknown to Sam, James is actually a Secret Service agent posing as a residential advisor in order to watch over her.  
The Final Cut (2004 film)
 A brief introduction describes "cutters", who edit the collected memories of the recently dead into [[feature length]] memorials that are viewed by loved ones at funerals. Their code forbids them to have the requisite implant or to sell memories.  The film opens with Alan Hakman as a child. While visiting a city with his parents, he meets another boy, Louis, and the two bond as they play together. Louis reluctantly joins Hakman in exploring an abandoned factory, and Hakman crosses a wooden plank suspended high above the ground. Goaded by Hakman, Louis also attempts to cross the plank, but he loses his confidence and falls. Hakman races to the ground and panics when he steps in what he thinks is Louis' blood. Hakman flees the scene and tells no one what happened.  Later that day, he leaves the city with his parents.  Years later, Hakman ([[Robin Williams]]) is a skilled cutter who specializes in editing the memories of controversial people into [[hagiography|hagiographies]]. When Fletcher ([[Jim Caviezel]]), a former cutter, confronts him at a [[funeral]], Hakman describes himself as a [[sin-eater]], who brings redemption to the immoral. Fletcher offers him $500,000 for the memories of his latest client, wealthy businessman Charles Bannister, but Hakman refuses. In a later meeting, Fletcher demands the memory recordings so that he can use Bannister, who he suspects was a [[pedophile]], as a [[scandal]] to shut down EYE Tech. Hakman again refuses, and, worried for his safety, uses his knowledge from memory tapes to shake down a shady criminal for a pistol.  As Hakman works through Bannister's memories, he encounters a scene that implies that Bannister was [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] his daughter, Isabel. Hakman wordlessly deletes it and presses on. He eventually comes upon a person that he is convinced must be his childhood friend Louis. Excited, he sets up a meeting with Bannister's family to find out more information. Bannister's wife is dismissive, but Isabel reveals that the man, recently dead of a car crash, was a teacher named Louis Hunt. Hoping that Hunt had an implant, Hakman organizes a break-in at EYE Tech, but they have no record of Hunt. Instead, Hakman finds a file on himself, which he is surprised to find documents his parents' purchase of an implant for him.  In his distress, Hakman turns to his lover, Delila. At his apartment, he shows her the equipment that he uses to view memories, and he demonstrates surreal footage from a defective implant. He leaves her alone as he seeks help from anti-implant protestors, who have discovered a way to block the implant through specialized [[body modification]]. When he returns to his apartment, he assumes that Fletcher has broken in; instead, Delila confronts him after having found memory tapes that document her prior relationship. She accuses him of [[voyeurism]] and angrily destroys his memory viewer, which results in Bannister's files also being damaged.  Fletcher and his associate finally break in, but they find nothing. Hakman tells Bannister's wife that the footage was lost in an accident, and she feigns disappointment, content to let dirty secrets stay hidden. Hakman asks his colleagues to recover live footage, a potentially deadly process. They agree, but admonish him that he can never cut memories again; a cutter with an implant is a violation of the "Cutter's code". The resulting memories show Hakman attempt to dissuade Louis from crossing the plank and stepping in red paint, not blood. Hakman, relieved, visits Hunt's grave but is confronted again by Fletcher, who has learned about Hakman's implant. After chasing Hakman through the graveyard, he hesitates and seems willing to let Hakman go; however, Fletcher's associate kills Hakman.  In the last scene, Fletcher loads Hakman's memories into a viewer and promises to use them for the greater good. As he pages through Hakman's memories, looking for evidence of Bannister's guilt, he sees Hakman watching himself in a mirror, and the memory implant lingers on the scene after Hakman has left.  
Finding Neverland (film)
 The story focuses on Scottish writer [[J. M. Barrie]], his platonic relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, and his close friendship with [[Llewelyn Davies boys|her sons named George, Jack, Peter and Michael]], who inspire the classic play ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Never Grew Up]]''.  Following the dismal reception of his latest play, ''Little Mary'', Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons (George, Jack, Peter and Michael) in [[Kensington Gardens]], and a strong, close friendship develops between them. He proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas which he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, especially one named after troubled young [[Peter Llewelyn Davies]]. Although Barrie sees this family as wonderful and inspirational, people question his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family. Sylvia was a widow: her husband died from cancer and left her with four boys to bring up on her own. Barrie's wife Mary, who eventually divorces him, and Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, object to the amount of time Barrie spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia becomes increasingly weak from an unidentified illness. Along the way, Barrie goes on adventures with Sylvia and her boys. He too is a boy at heart and spending time with the family is special. Barrie takes those adventures he has with the boys and makes them into a play called ''Peter Pan''.   [[Theatre producer|Producer]] [[Charles Frohman]] skeptically agrees to mount ''Peter Pan'', despite his belief that it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby [[orphan]]age, and the adults present react to their infectious delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success. Barrie is all set for his play, but when Peter arrives alone to the play, Barrie goes to Sylvia's house to check up on her, and misses the show. Peter attends the play and realises the play is about his brothers and Barrie.   Sylvia is too ill to attend the premiere, so Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in her home. He gets the actors, props and musicians together in the Llewelyn Davies house. At the end of the play, Peter Pan points to the back doors and implies that Sylvia should go off to Neverland. She takes the hands of her boys and slowly walks out into Neverland. The living room and back garden transform into Neverland and Sylvia continues to walk on her own.  In the next scene everyone is at Sylvia's funeral. Barrie discovers that her will says that he and her mother should look after the boys, an arrangement agreeable to both. The film ends with J. M. Barrie finding Peter on the bench in the park where they first met after Peter ran off from the graveyard. Peter is holding his book where he wrote the plays that he ripped apart and that his mother glued back together for him. Barrie sits down and puts his arm around Peter to comfort him. They both fade, and all that is left is the bench.  
First Love (2004 drama film)

Fighting Tommy Riley
 Tommy Riley ([[J. P. Davis]]) stands in boxing gear in a dingy dressing room. There is a knock at the door and a voice calls out, "Are you ready?"  The film [[Flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] seven months. Tommy is a former boxer who almost made the [[Boxing at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 U.S. Olympic boxing team]] as a [[middleweight]]. He works laying computer cable and earns money on the side as a [[sparring]] partner in a local gym. His lack of motivation has led his girlfriend Stephanie ([[Christina Chambers]]) to move out.  Marty ([[Eddie Jones (actor)|Eddie Jones]]) is a former boxer, now a high school teacher and boxing trainer/manager who had previously coached a fighter to a title shot, only to have the fighter leave him just before the fight. Marty and his business partner Diane (Diane Tayler) arrive at the gym where Tommy spars to scout his sparring partner. The fighter's manager instructs Tommy to make his fighter look good, but after he suffers a low blow, Tommy knocks the fighter out with one punch. The manager and the gym's owner angrily order Tommy from the gym but Marty and Diane chase after him, inviting him to train with Marty.  Tommy's reputation and news of his return to the ring spark interest from promoters. After training some time, Marty and Diane set up a fight so that promoters can see him in action. He wins the fight but the promoter at ringside shows no enthusiasm.  Diane gives Marty a tape of Tommy's 1999 Olympic trial fight. Tommy was ahead after two rounds but quit before round three because of a hand injury. Marty realizes that Tommy faked his injury because of the poor coaching and abuse coming from his stepfather, who was serving as his [[cornerman]]. Marty and Tommy talk about Tommy's stepfather and Marty's former fighter. Marty tells Tommy that boxing is a team sport and that Tommy will never be alone in the ring. Tommy's renewed motivation as a fighter leads to a reconciliation with Stephanie.  Leroy Kane ([[Don Wallace (actor)|Don Wallace]]), the fighter who went to the Olympics instead of Tommy, wants a "tune-up" fight before his fight for the middleweight title. His scheduled opponent is injured and Diane sets Tommy up for the bout instead. The fight is in four weeks, so Tommy and Marty go to Marty's cabin in the woods to train without distractions. After several days, during a rubdown following a workout, Marty touches Tommy inappropriately. Tommy reacts strongly negatively and Marty apologizes. They agree to ignore the incident but return to the city ahead of schedule.  On the night of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself pursuing Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes to the hospital and finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's [[homosexuality]], so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.  Bob summons Tommy, alone, for a meeting. Bob offers him a million dollar three-fight contract on the condition that he leave Marty. Marty, Bob says, has a "tainted rep" in the fight game and represents an "element" that boxing will never be ready for. Tommy refuses the deal if it means leaving Marty. Diane and Marty both advise Tommy to take the offer but he still refuses. Stephanie and Tommy argue about the offer and Tommy drives Stephanie away.  Marty tries to alienate Tommy by ignoring him during training and becoming verbally abusive. After Marty slaps Tommy several times during a training session, Tommy attacks him, yelling that if Marty ever puts his "faggot-ass hands" on him again, he will kill him. Later that night Tommy goes to Marty's place to apologize and to tell him that Marty can't make him go away. Marty refuses to take him back. Tommy reduces himself to offering himself to Marty sexually. Marty explodes at him, furious that Tommy would think that of him after all they'd been through.  The next morning, Tommy rushes back to Marty's house where he and a distraught Diane find Marty's body. He has committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Tommy calls Stephanie to apologize and to tell her of Marty's death.  The film returns to the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon catching sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty standing behind him. He finishes dressing for the fight and, as he walks to the ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring and the camera pulls back to reveal that he is dressed in Marty's old ring robe in tribute.  
Five Children and It (film)
 The film begins with five children (Robert, Cyril, Jane, Anthea and The Lamb), whose father has gone to fight in [[World War I]]. Consequently, the children must meanwhile stay at their aunt and eccentric uncle's house with his unpleasant son, Horace. While exploring the house, Robert finds a locked door in the forbidden greenhouse and brings the other children. They manage to open the door, which leads them through a secret path to the beach surrounding the house. There they discover a large shelled creature, which reveals itself as a "psammead crustacean decapodlium wishasaurus," or sand fairy for short. The children, befuddled by this confusing name, refer to the creature simply as "It." It seems rather mischievous and Cyril doubts whether the children should trust him, but upon confirming that It can grant wishes, the children wish for all the house chores on their list to be done by magic. When they return to the house, they see dozens of copies of themselves doing the chores and wrecking the house in the attempt.  Suddenly, everything disappears in clouds of golden dust. They are then forced to tidy up the mess themselves. When they return to It and ask why their clones disappeared, It explains that at sunset, all wishes fade away. The children blame It for the mess, but It responds by saying that wishes bring valuable lessons.  The children need money to fix all the broken items, so they wish for buckets of gold and go off into town to buy some items. The children aren't able to buy anything because the owners will not accept gold, believing it is fake. They manage to purchase a car, having nothing else to do with the gold, and end up crashing it during a test drive. Mr. Peasemarsh, the owner, becomes furious and causes a scene with the children as the authorities and their aunt both appear on the scene. When Mr. Peasemarsh tries to reveal the children's "stolen gold", it vanishes just before he can show it to the officers, who take him away, believing he is out of his mind.  Horace, meanwhile, is becoming suspicious of the children, and when they refuse to tell him what secret they're hiding, he manages to catch them in a room and locks it, telling them he won't let them out until they come clean. Robert, who was not with the rest when Horace trapped them, goes to It and wishes for wings so they can go off to [[France]] and find their father. The other children fly out the window when they discover their new wings, and Horace eventually decides to let them out only to discover them missing and the window open. While flying, the children are almost killed by heavy aircraft, but they just barely manage to escape danger. With sunset drawing near, they have no choice but to go home. During their return trip, their wings begin to fade, and it appears they will fall into the sea, but It's face appears among the clouds and blows on the children, sweeping them through the air back to shore.  When the children's mother returns, the children learn that their father has gone missing. Robert talks to It that night, and falls asleep next to It on the beach. Horace, having followed Robert, captures It and brings him to his basement. The next morning, Robert confronts Horace but is unwilling to act, as Horace has his father's compass. Seeing that Horace plans to dissect It to find out how he works his magic, Robert suggests Horace wish for something instead. Interested in the idea, Horace wishes for his fossilized dinosaur egg to hatch. The children arrive in time to see Horace's dinosaur standing high above them and threatening to eat them. After trying to calm it down, It makes the dinosaur vanish. Shocked, Horace passes out, and Robert takes him to their mother, while the other children wish for their father to come home. He appears on the beach and talks to the children, but only minutes later he vanishes as sunset hits the beach. Robert, having just nearly missed returning to see him, is devastated.  The children go to Horace, and they talk about what happened in the basement. Horace, surprised at the secret, becomes agreeable, and the children settle their differences, and agree to share the secret of Its existence together. On It's birthday, the children wish It a good future and prepare to return home. When their car breaks down, they are forced to stay in the house and Horace suggests a game of hide-and-seek. As Robert counts, his father appears. When Robert realizes that its really their father, he and the children are overjoyed, joined by their mother. Finally reunited with their father, the children prepare to go home. In a post credits scene, It contemplates a sequel "It and Five Children".

The Football Factory (film)
 Tommy Johnson ([[Danny Dyer]]) is a member of a violent Chelsea hooligan [[Football hooliganism in the United Kingdom|firm]]. His friends and fellow hooligans include Tommy's best friend Rod King ([[Neil Maskell]]), the hot-tempered Billy Bright ([[Frank Harper]]), and impulsive younger members Zebedee ([[Roland Manookian]]) and Raf (Calum MacNab). Tommy spends his days [[Lager|drinking]], [[Recreational drug use|using drugs]], [[Lothario|womanising]] and fighting, much to the disappointment of his grandfather Bill Farrell ([[Dudley Sutton]]), a pensioner and veteran who plans to move to [[Australia]] with his best friend Albert ([[John Junkin]]).  Tommy has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] about his lifestyle during a fight with the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] hooligan firm. Tommy, Billy and Rod are arrested for assaulting two [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] fans whilst travelling to an away match. These actions draw the fury of Harris (Tony Denham), the leader of the Chelsea firm, whose attempts to keep order are thwarted by Billy's aggressive outbursts.  Rod begins a relationship with Tamara (Sophie Linfield), the court clerk at their arraignment, and she pressures him to skip his weekend meets. Zebedee and his friend Raff accidentally burgle Billy's house and are forced to stand in his living room, whilst Billy's children throw darts at them. Billy deals with his increasing loneliness after he overhears Harris discussing his irrelevance. Bill's plan to retire to Australia are postponed when Albert dies the night before they are to leave.  Early in the film, Tommy is caught and held hostage by the brother of Shian (Michele Hallak), a girl he picked up at a club. He is saved when Rod hits the man on the head with a cricket bat. Sian's brother turns out to also be the brother of the rival [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] firm's leader, Fred ([[Tamer Hassan]]), who then hunts Tommy down throughout the entire film. The film culminates in a pitched battle between the Chelsea and Millwall firms. Rod (after a few [[espresso]]s and a line of [[cocaine]]), leaves a dinner with Tamara's parents after offending them, and attends the "meet". Tommy is severely beaten by Fred and a group of Millwall hooligans, and ends up in the hospital with Bill, who, in the meantime, has suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]].  A recurring sub-plot concerns a racist taxi driver ([[Jamie Foreman]]), whom the characters encounter at various points throughout the film.  At the end of the film, Tommy decides that his place is at the firm with his friends, Bill moves to Australia and Billy Bright is incarcerated for seven years after being arrested at the Millwall meet (whilst saving Harris from being arrested). Zebedee is killed by a drug dealer whom he had previously mugged, fulfilling a recurring bad dream that tormented Tommy throughout the film.  
Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)
 When an Amacore [[Drilling rig|oil rig]] in the [[Gobi Desert]] of [[Mongolia]] proves unproductive, Captain Frank Towns ([[Dennis Quaid]]) and co-pilot A.J. ([[Tyrese Gibson]]) are sent to shut down the operation and transport the crew (Amacore executive Ian, rig supervisor Kelly, Rodney, Davis, Liddle, Jeremy, Sammi, Rady, Kyle, Newman, and Dr. Gerber) out of the desert, along with a load of cargo from the site to be liquidated or redistributed to another site, causing the plane to overweight.  However, en route to [[Beijing]], a major [[dust storm]] disables one engine when Towns attempts a vertical climb with the overweight plane, forcing them to crash land their [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119 Flying Boxcar]] in an uncharted area of the [[Gobi Desert]]. Kyle falls to his death and the crash kills Dr. Gerber and Newman.  Their cargo consists of used parts and tools from the rig, the rig's crew, and Elliot ([[Giovanni Ribisi]]), a hitchhiker.  When the dust storm ends, it becomes apparent that they are 200 miles off course with only a month's supply of water. Jeremy  ([[Sticky Fingaz|Kirk Jones]]) thinks about walking to get help, but Rady ([[Kevork Malikyan]]) explains that July is the hottest month in the Gobi, and that he won't make it.  In the middle of the night, Davis ([[Jared Padalecki]]) goes out to urinate without informing anybody, trips, gets lost in a sandstorm, and dies. The group panics after a failed search for him, and Kelly ([[Miranda Otto]]) argues with Frank, who says that walking out of the desert would fail and that their only option is to await rescue. The group initially agrees but reconsiders after Elliot, claiming to be an aeronautical engineer, pitches a radical idea: rebuild the wreckage of their C-119 into a functional aircraft. Frank initially refuses, which causes Liddle ([[Scott Michael Campbell]]) to wander off on his own in protest. Frank attempts to find him. He comes across a valley littered with debris, cargo from the aircraft, which dropped out when the tail was torn open. Among the debris he discovers the bullet-ridden and stripped body of Kyle, after which Liddle appears saying he came to retrieve his watch which he lost to Kyle in a poker game; Towns then deduces that either nomads or smugglers used Kyle's corpse for target practice. Liddle says he will only go back with him if they build the plane, and Frank agrees.  They struggle for several weeks building the new aircraft, losing their fuel reserves in a spark fire, through an electrical storm, lack of water, and fighting amongst the group. Rady christens it ''Phoenix'' after the [[Phoenix (mythology)|legendary bird]]. A problem evolves when a group of smugglers camp nearby; when Ian, A.J., and Rodney attempt to communicate, the bandits kill Rodney ([[Tony Curran]]) after Liddle notices that one of them is wearing his watch, but they are killed in a short, fierce skirmish when ambushed by Frank who was with Liddle, save one who escaped. When going through the smugglers encampment, they find a wounded smuggler and argue about what to do until Elliot walks over and executes him with a pistol. Towns accuses him of murder, but Elliot states that that Towns murdered him and got Rodney killed by going to investigate the smugglers and wasting a whole days work; Towns punches out Elliot which causes the project to stall, until they give Elliot creative control. After it's finished, it is revealed that Elliot's aircraft design experience has been restricted to the design of model aircraft, much to the anger of everyone, especially Ian ([[Hugh Laurie]]), who threatens to shoot Elliot. However as a storm is brewing the high force winds cause the plane to lift off temporarily; forced to take shelter in the old plane's hull during the sandstorm, they later dig out the plane from beneath the sand and take off, barely in time to escape a larger group of bandits seeking revenge for the murdered smugglers.  Through a series of photos, we see what became of the survivors when they made it back to civilization. All have been revitalized by the experience: Frank and A.J. start their own airline (appropriately named Phoenix Aviation), Sammi ([[Jacob Vargas]]) and his wife start their own restaurant (Jeremy and Rady are there to celebrate), Liddle is reunited with his wife and kids, Ian becomes a professional golfer, Kelly is working at an ocean oil rig, and Elliot is wearing a flight suit on a ''[[Flight International]]'' magazine cover with the headline: "[[NASA]]'s New Hope?"  
The Five of Us
 Manon ([[Jacinthe Laguë]]), Anne (Julie Deslauriers), Isa (Ingrid Falaise), Claudie (Brigitte Lafleur), and Sophie (Noemie Yelle) are all childhood friends. Ever since they were children, they would spend time at Sophie’s cottage in Montreal. The five girls, now at the age of 17, return to the cottage as they have permission from their parents to spend the weekend on their own. The girls plan to host a party during the absence of their parents. Manon and Sophie depart to pick up groceries in preparation of the party. They do not have access to a car, so they decide to hitchhike with a stranger. Manon quickly develops a romantic interest for the stranger, while Sophie remains suspicious of his behavior.  The party has begun, but Manon and Sophie have yet to return. The girls are having a blast, while Anne is worried about the safety of Manon and Sophie. Eventually, Isa takes a rowboat out with a boy in hopes to get some privacy. As the rowboat approaches land, Isa discovers Manon in the forest, stabbed and covered in blood. Sophie is missing. The boy brings Manon to safety, while Isa runs off to find Sophie.  15 years have passed since the incident. Manon is working as an administrator for a large firm. She expresses no interest in staff outings, nor does she express romantic interests towards men. She also avoids taking the elevator with any men, hence being uncomfortable in private places with them. Stéphane (Sylvain Carrier) enters the scene and invites Manon on a date, to which Manon accepts on the condition of being in a public space. Manon also refuses him from staying at her place for the night. Several days pass, and Manon begins to develop an intimate relationship with Stéphane.  Manon drives into a car wash, and recognizes the stranger that was responsible for her traumatic experience. She experiences an anxiety attack, rushes home, and locks her doors. Several flashbacks reveal that Sophie was chained to a tree and covered in blood. Manon collects and reviews the court files only to discover that the parole board granted the stranger, Richard Thibodeau (Peter Miller), [[conditional release]]. Manon then takes her medication to reduce her anxiety. Stéphane arrives unexpectedly, and discovers the court files which Manon was reviewing. He confesses his love for her, but she does not reciprocate.   Manon visits Sophie’s parents to discuss the parole board’s decision. Sophie’s mother admits that she had pardoned Thibodeau because she was exhausted, and wanted to move forward. However, Sophie’s father and Manon were in disagreement of her decision.   Manon returns home and invites Anne, who is now a mother, to her condo. Manon reveals that she had asked Sophie’s parents for permission to return to the cottage, which was granted. She makes the decision to invite all of the girls on a trip to the cottage in hopes to leave her experience in the past and move on from her trauma. At this time, Isa is a model in New York, and Claudie is a chef in Montreal. All the girls agree to accompany Manon to the cottage in hopes to confront their past.  A flashback reveals that Sophie and Isa were best friends, and that Sophie was suppose to join Isa in New York.  The girls arrive at the cottage, and explore the area in silence. Back in Montreal, Stéphane studies the case files in the library and uncovers Manon’s past. A flashback confirms that Thibodeau had raped, beaten, and stabbed Manon.  After the girls have a heated discussion on Thibodeau’s release, Manon spots Isa on a rowboat returning to the crime scene. It is revealed that Isa had found Sophie’s lifeless body, stabbed and chained to a tree. Thibodeau had forced Manon to witness him stab and rape Sophie. Manon couldn’t handle the trauma and attempted to escape, which resulted in Thibodeau murdering Sophie as a consequence for her actions. Manon faces her fear, and pursues Isa. Anne and Claudie follow along. Once they arrive at the scene, they remain relatively silent.  Another day passes by, and the girls become more comfortable and accepting of their experiences. Anne, Claudie, and Isa return to Montreal and witness the parole board’s decision on Thibodeau’s release upon [[parole]]. Manon leaves a tape for Thibodeau, expressing her thoughts and feelings towards him and her freedom of the trauma. Manon returns to Stéphane, and becomes more accepting towards her romantic and sexual relationship with him.

Formula 17
 Naïve country bumpkin Chou T'ien Tsai goes to [[Taipei]] to meet an internet friend face-to-face. Being a romantic, and believing in 'true love' (he even has a book called ''Love Is A Kind Of Faith''), he is sorely disappointed when his internet friend, Kevin, suggests they have sex with no love. T'ien instead goes to a bar and runs into his ex-classmate Yu and Yu's friend CC. In the same bar, he encounters the 'Number One Playboy' Bai Tieh Nan, who is notorious for one night stands. Despite professing his dislike for 'men who play with love', T'ien can't help but be drawn to Bai.  T'ien becomes roommates with Yu. Yu enlists another friend, Alan, to try and set T'ien up with someone so he'll lose his virginity, but their efforts fail against T'ien's unyielding belief in saving himself for true love. T'ien later gets a job as a clubhouse attendant, where he has several run-ins with Bai, who seems to like T'ien mutually. Despite warnings from his friends and rumors about Bai's past, T'ien very quickly develops a liking towards Bai.  Scenes with Bai and his psychologist show that Bai has a problem kissing people despite having no qualms about sleeping with them. After being advised to practice kissing a mirror and then a mannequin, both of which fail to help him, he tries to kiss his longtime friend, Jun, but can't bring himself to do it.  One night, T'ien shows up at Bai's doorstep and they end up kissing and having sex consensually. True to his nature, Bai disappears the next day, leaving Jun to turn up at his house and explain to T'ien that 'he hopes you don't misunderstand', causing T'ien to misunderstand the situation. T'ien, hurt and unknowing of the entire story behind Bai's intimacy issues, leaves a message saying that 'this kind of misunderstanding won't happen again'.  Later, Bai, who would like to make amends with T'ien, is thwarted from doing so before having to leave for an important business trip.  After failing to reach Bai by phone, T'ien prepares to leave his roommate's dwelling and return to his own home. Meanwhile, T'ien's friends corner Bai and Jun as they get back from the business trip. They ask Bai to tell them the truth, but Bai is very resistant to tell the story, so Jun decides to share instead. As a young boy, Bai was told by a fortune teller that he is cursed and that anything that he loves will be doomed. A lifetime of self-fulfilling this prophecy is what led Bai to become a serial one-night stander and lose his ability to love. Falling in love with T'ien caught Bai off guard and, as a result, they both suffered. After a silent prayer for a second chance, he sees T'ien heading up an escalator. His first attempt to apologize fails, and T'ien literally runs away. He nearly gets run down by a scooter, but Bai saves him and they make up.  The ending credits include a short segment on Yu, CC, and Alan and their somewhat stereotyped views upon gay fashion.  
The Forgotten (2004 film)
 Telly Paretta ([[Julianne Moore]]) believes that her son Sam (Christopher Kovaleski) died 14 months ago in a plane crash, but her husband Jim ([[Anthony Edwards]]) tells her that she's delusional and that they have never had a son. Her friend Eliot ([[Jessica Hecht]]) doesn't appear to believe in Sam's existence despite her closeness to him. Dr. Munce ([[Gary Sinise]]) tells her that Sam was merely a figment of her imagination and that she is just imagining a life that might have been. He recommends that she be sent to a hospital, but she runs away and meets with a man named Ash ([[Dominic West]]), who she thinks is the father of a girl named Lauren (Kathryn Faughnan), who was Sam's friend and died in the same crash. At first he dismisses her, claiming he never had a daughter, and calls the police. After she is taken into custody, he remembers his daughter and rescues Telly. Together they escape and go into hiding, pursued by National Security agents.  Telly and Ash capture and threaten an agent ([[Lee Tergesen]]), who reluctantly reveals that he and other agents are merely helping ″them″ in order to protect humankind. Without warning, the roof of the house blows off and the agent, along with the roof, is sucked into the sky—presumably taken by "them"—and Telly and Ash flee. Eventually, Telly visits Dr. Munce again and he reveals that the disappearances are the work of "them", and that the government monitors their trials, all too aware that they have no power to stop "them" from doing whatever they want.  Munce takes Telly to an airport and the dilapidated hangar of Quest Airlines, where he introduces her to an agent of "them" ([[Linus Roache]]). He tells the agent that it's over and to stop the experiment, because it will only cause more harm. But the agent replies that it's not over. He reveals to Telly that she has been a part of an experiment to test whether the bonds between mother and child can be diminished. In her case, her memories could not be fully erased. Telly refuses to deny her son's existence. The agent mentions that if he fails to erase her memory then he will look like a failure. The agent then subdues her and convinces her to think of the first memory she had of Sam. Telly thinks of the day he was born in the hospital, which allows the agent to successfully erase Sam's memory from existence. As the agent is walking away, thinking he's succeeded, Telly's motherly bond kicks in deeper, to before Sam was born, when she was pregnant, triggering her memory that she indeed had life in her at one time. All of her memories of Sam return. Before the agent can comprehend what's happening, part of the hangar roof is suddenly blown off, and he's yanked into the sky himself, supposedly for his failure to erase her memory. This ends the experiment.  Telly finds herself living a normal life, although she remembers everything that has happened. She reunites with Sam at a park. Also at the park is Ash, watching over his daughter.  Like Sam, he has no memory of what has happened. Telly reintroduces herself, and the two sit and watch the kids play in the playground.

They explore the interior while Elmer waits in the canoe outside. They discover the remains of the crew in the hold. Upset, Mary clumsily knocks Elmer from the canoe and something drags him down. Sam and Mary flee in the canoe, unaware that they have triggered a homing signal on the ship. On the mainland a team relays the information to their employer a wealthy [[bounty hunter]].  One of the villagers heard noises while on his porch. He leans over the edge and a frankenfish leaps up and decapitates him. His girlfriend attempts to escape the houseboat on a canoe but the fish flips her out and kills her. Frightened, the group tries to flee in boats but the fish destroys them. On a neighboring stilt house, Ricardo baits a large hook using an entire catfish and manages to land one of the frankenfish. Nearly as big as a full-grown man, the fish can breathe air and hops forward biting at Ricardo's legs. Ricardo manages to kill it with a shotgun blast to the head. In vengeance he tears out its heart and barbecues it. As he takes his first bite a second frankenfish leaps from the water and devours him.  While everyone panics, Mary declares she has an idea on how to get off the boathouse. Before she can explain, she is shot by the house. A fire propels a propane tank into the boathouse causing an explosion that sends Eliza into the water. Sam dives in and rescues her at the same time a frankenfish leaps from the water and bites off Gloria's legs. The fish have begun attacking the boathouses, punching holes in them to make them sink.  The bounty hunter and his crew arrive and the fish attack them too. Knocked out of the boat, they swim quickly to the safety of the sinking stilt houses. The hunter explains that the fish are genetically engineered [[Snakehead (fish)|snakeheads]]. Sam, Eliza and Dan have no choice but to join the hunter in pursuing the fish.  The crew follows a trail of blood back to the fish's den. The hunter forces Sam at gunpoint to enter first. Sam flees the den as behind him a frankenfish kills two hunters. Dan, Sam and Eliza quickly leave on the fan boat, chased by the frankenfish. Dan falls from the boat during the chase but scrambles up a mudbank. Realizing they cannot outrace the monster, Sam drives the fanboat up a stand of tree stumps and knocks off the protective lining of the fan. Unable to slow its momentum, the frankenfish launches into the whirling blades to its death. Sam and Eliza kiss and go back the way they came to get Dan. However, Dan is trapped in the mud as dozens of baby frankenfish attack him.

Friday Night Lights (film)
 As preseason practice begins for the [[Permian High School]] football team in August 1988, the town of [[Odessa, Texas]] has high expectations for the players and their coach [[Gary Gaines]] to win a state championship with their star [[running back]] [[Boobie Miles|James "Boobie" Miles]]. The [[quarterback]], Mike Winchell, runs under the expectation of handing off the ball to Miles on most plays. [[Fullback (gridiron football)|Fullback]] Don Billingsley struggles with his ball handling and is abused by his alcoholic father Charles, who won a state championship with Permian. The players frequently party as they deal with the pressures of Odessa's expectations.  In the season opener against the Marshall Bulldogs, the Permian Panthers make the game a blowout. Gaines intends to bench Miles in the waning minutes, but keeps him in after third-stringer Chris Comer is unprepared to go in. Miles tears his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] after being tackled at the knee, and afterwards Gaines is widely criticized by the town for keeping Miles in. In the next game during the start of district play, Permian gets blown out as Winchell struggles with consistency in his increased role and the second-string running back gets hurt. Comer goes in, but avoids contact, and discussion arises about Gaines losing his job. However, the Panthers start winning again as Winchell and Comer improve, and safety Brian Chavez and linebacker Ivory Christian emerge as defensive standouts.  Miles holds out hope that he can return to playing soon, and although his [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan shows otherwise, he rejects it and lies to Gaines so he can suit up again, with his uncle and guardian L.V. backing him up. Permian plays its final district game against Midland Lee, with first place and a playoff spot on the line. The Panthers fall behind, and Gaines puts Miles in out of desperation, but Miles is soon injured again. Winchell leads a comeback drive, but Permian loses as his final pass flies over the receiver's hands. After the game, Billingsley fights with his drunk father, who throws his state championship ring onto the side of the freeway. The next morning, Don reveals to his father that he recovered the championship ring and gives it back to him. Charles partially apologizes and makes the point that his state championship was the best thing that happened to him, and he now has nothing happy except those memories. The loss puts Permian in a three-way tie for first place with Lee and Abilene Cooper, and a [[Coin flipping|coin toss]] is held to determine which two teams make the playoffs. Permian and Lee win the toss, and as the Panthers prepare for the playoffs, Miles clears his locker. While in his uncle's car, he cries about his future in football becoming bleak.  Permian is successful in the playoffs, but all eyes are on the state powerhouse [[David W. Carter High School|Dallas Carter High School]]. Permian and Carter make it to the state championship game, which is held at the [[Astrodome]] due to the schools' different demographics. Miles rejoins the team and watches from the sidelines as the Panthers head into the game. They are initially overwhelmed by Carter's superior size and fall behind, but mount a comeback in the second half to pull within one score. The defense improves its tackling, and the offense pushes through despite injuries. After a defensive stop, Winchell, Comer, and Billingsley mount a final drive, but Comer and Billingsley are injured. Billingsley goes back in, and holds onto the ball for a big run, but it is called back for a holding penalty. On fourth down, Winchell is stopped just short of the goal line as the clock runs out, and Carter wins the championship.  Afterwards, Gaines removes the outgoing seniors from his depth chart, and it is revealed that Winchell, Billingsley, Miles, and Chavez went on to have successful lives after their football careers ended, with only Christian receiving a Division I scholarship. The movie ends with the statement that Gaines and Comer led Permian to an undefeated state championship season the following year.

His friend Brennan, who found him knocked out, thinks the fraternity brothers did it and tries to tell it to a campus police officer.  Brennan goes to the LGBT Club and claims that Clay was gay bashed and that the campus police are covering it up. The Club therefore thinks a hate crime was committed and they arrange to have all of the historically oppressed minority groups unite and go fight against the fraternity.  Meanwhile, Amanda tries to prevent Clay from going to the upcoming party because she doesn’t want to break up with him. Clay nevertheless shows up and after seeing a number of break ups on the spot, realizes that it was a set-up and dumps Amanda. He returns and discovers that Matt is gay.  When walking across campus the next day, Clay sees posters up with his picture on them, claiming him to be the victim of a hate crime. He sees Marjorie, who's now lesbian, putting up one and asks her to take it off. He also reveals to her that he’s not even gay and she gets mad.  Clay sees Professor Jackson in the library and she reveals that she knew the whole time that he wasn’t gay. After a talk with her, he decides to go make up with Amanda. He shows up at a fraternity house, where a party is being held, and sees a brawl going on between the minority groups and the fraternity and sorority. He gets on stage and gets everyone’s attention. He reveals that Sherman was the attacker and the LGBT Club members get mad at Sherman. Clay reveals to everyone that he’s not gay and that he's in love with Amanda. He tries to get everyone in the room to reconcile, but they start rioting when a black woman is called “dyke”. Amanda storms out of the house. Clay tries to get back with her, but she still leaves and decides to go back to Pittsburgh.  Clay goes back to the gay bar where he reveals to Rodney that he wasn’t gay and that he was only pretending in order to get Amanda to like him. He asks Rodney if he’s mad, who responds by saying that he isn’t and feels honored to hear a straight man wanting to be gay.  Amanda, who has lost her scholarship but got a job at a make-up counter, is seen sitting at a bus stop. Clay goes up to her and tells her that pretending to be gay made him a better person. They rekindle their relationship and Amanda, having already missed her bus, misses the next bus, in order to spend a little more time with Clay.

He also says that his father, who is his [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], put him on the medication. Andrew finds Sam outside the office and offers her a ride home. Sam invites him into her house, and he meets her mother, who inadvertently reveals that Sam has [[epilepsy]]. Andrew tells Sam of his mother's death, and Sam tearfully eulogizes her hamster. After returning home, Andrew's father confronts him and is insistent that they have a talk before Andrew leaves.  Later, Andrew and Jesse sit in the cemetery as Mark digs another grave. Andrew observes Mark stealing jewelry from the corpse he is burying. Andrew then returns to Sam's house, and the two spend the rest of the day together, joining his friends later at Jesse's mansion.

Sam, Andrew, and Mark spend the day together, ending it in a [[quarry]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] where Mark talks to a man named Albert ([[Denis O'Hare]]), who is employed in keeping intruders out of the quarry. The three visitors discuss the reasons for which Albert and his wife choose to live in the quarry. Albert explains that living there and exploring the quarry is "doing something that's completely unique, that's never been done before," mirroring an earlier speech by Sam. Finally, Albert explains that what actually matters is living with his family. Andrew is inspired by the conversation, and outside in the rain, he climbs atop a derelict crane and screams into the quarry, joined by Sam and Mark. He and Sam then share a kiss.  When Sam and Andrew look at the gift later on, it turns out to be Andrew's mother's favorite pendant, one of the items Mark stole from her grave, sold, and subsequently located. Andrew eventually talks with his father, and states that he was not to blame for his mother's accident and that he will live the rest of his life without medications. He forgives his father and says he wants to build a better relationship with him.  The morning after, Andrew says his goodbyes to Sam at the airport, while she begs him not to leave. He acknowledges that she has changed his life but also recognizes that he still has to fix his personal problems before continuing the relationship. Andrew boards the flight, and Sam is left crying in a telephone booth. Andrew then returns, saying that he doesn't want to waste any more of his life without Sam. He wonders what to do next, and the two then kiss.

Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence
 The story is loosely based on ''Ghost in the Shell'' manga chapter "Robot Rondo" (with elements of "Phantom Fund"). Opening in 2032, [[Public Security Section 9]] [[cybernetic]] operative [[Batou]] is teamed with [[Togusa]], an agent with very few cybernetic upgrades, following the events of ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]''.  After a series of deaths due to malfunctioning [[gynoid]]s—doll-like sex robots—Section 9 is asked to investigate. As the gynoids all malfunctioned without clear cause, the deaths are believed to be premeditated murders; Batou and Togusa are sent to investigate possible terrorist or political motives. Additionally, the most recent gynoid's remains show they all contained an illegal "ghost". Section 9 concludes human sentience is being artificially duplicated onto the dolls illegally, making the robots more lifelike, and possibly acting as a motive in the murders.  Called to a homicide scene, information warfare/technology specialist Ishikawa explains the victim is Jack Walkson, a consignment officer at gynoid company LOCUS SOLUS, who may have been killed by the [[Yakuza]]. A previous Yakuza boss was recently killed by a gynoid, so Ishikawa concludes Walkson was held responsible and killed in an act of revenge. Batou and Togusa enter a Yakuza bar to question the current boss, only to be threatened by the bar occupants. Batou opens fire, killing and wounding numerous gang members, including the cyborg that murdered Walkson. The current boss then admits his predecessor was somehow involved in LOCUS SOLUS, but insists he doesn't know how.  Entering a store on his way home, Batou is then seemingly warned by [[Motoko Kusanagi|the Major]] and shot in the arm by an unseen assailant. Caught in a [[shootout|firefight]], Batou nearly kills the store owner in confusion, but is subdued when Ishikawa appears. While having his damaged arm replaced, Batou is informed by Ishikawa that his [[Cybernetic implant|e-brain]] was hacked, causing him to shoot himself and attack the store occupants. Ishikawa explains that Batou was hacked to try and cause further scandal following his Yakuza assault in an attempt to stop the Section 9 investigation.  Batou and Togusa then head for the mansion of Kim, a soldier-turned-hacker with an obsession with dolls. Seemingly dead, Kim soon reveals he "lives" inside the shell of a human-sized [[marionette]], and discusses philosophy with his visitors. Kim admits ties to LOCUS SOLUS, divulging that the company has secret headquarters in [[international waters]]. Warned again by the Major, Batou realizes that Kim has secretly hacked into his and Togusa's e-brains, and is currently trapping them in a false reality. Resetting Togusa's brain, Batou subdues Kim, noting he knows Kim hacked his brain in the store.  Resolved to gather material evidence, Batou infiltrates the LOCUS SOLUS headquarters ship while Togusa remotely hacks its security systems using an unaware Kim as a [[Proxy server|proxy]]. The ship's security becomes aware of the hacking and retaliates with a virus that fries Kim's cyberbrain. Simultaneously, a hidden virus loads a combat program into the production-line gynoids, causing them to attack everyone aboard. As Batou fights to the ship's center, the Major then appears by controlling a gynoid remotely, helping Batou fight the gynoids and hack the ship's security.  Taking control of the ship, the Major then reveals to Batou the truth about the gynoids. Hiring the Yakuza to [[Trafficking in human beings|traffick]] young girls, LOCUS SOLUS duplicated their consciousnesses into the gynoids, giving them human "ghosts" to make them more realistic. Batou rescues a young girl from a "ghost dubbing" machine, and she explains that Jack Walkson, learning the truth about LOCUS SOLUS, promised to save the girls by tampering with the ghosting process; this caused the gynoids to murder their owners, allowing Walkson to attract police attention and indirectly kill the Yakuza boss. Despite Walkson's actions saving the girls, Batou objects that he also victimized the gynoids as well, causing them severe distress by giving them damaged ghosts. Having solved the case, Batou asks the Major if she's happy now, and she notes that she'll always be beside him on the network, before disconnecting from the gynoid.

She pleads to be released, but the clinic's director Alice refuses.  Tyler, a worker at the clinic, offers to trade monkshood for sexual favors, which she declines. As her healing rate accelerates, so does her rate of transformation. Ginger continues to appear, taunting Brigitte as she experiences growing cravings for sex and murder, as did Ginger previously.  While at the clinic, a girl named Ghost – the granddaughter of Barbara, a severe burn victim at the hospital – shadows Brigitte and realizes her secret. <ref></ref><ref></ref>  Brigitte and Ghost escape the clinic through air vents and the old hospital's crematorium, pursued by a male werewolf.  The next day, they arrange a meeting at a gas station with Tyler to procure more monkshood and all three of them return to Barbara's house to inject the monkshood — which Brigitte's body rejects. Worried that Brigitte is OD'ing, Tyler calls Alice. Ghost tricks Brigitte into thinking that Tyler abused her, and Brigitte locks Tyler outside, where the werewolf kills him. When Alice arrives, Ghost mistakes her for the werewolf, and attacks her with Barbara's hunting rifle. Meanwhile, Brigitte realizes that Tyler did not abuse Ghost, and that Ghost herself burnt Barbara.  Brigitte, whose transformation is almost complete, fights the werewolf. As they struggle, they both fall into the basement, where the werewolf is impaled on a prepared trap. Instead of helping or killing her with the rifle, Ghost pushes Brigitte back down and locks the basement. In the final scenes, Ghost is shown to keep Brigitte in the basement as a werewolf pet waiting to be unleashed on her enemies.  
Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning
 Each spring, a party from a fort travels to [[Hudson Bay]] to trade pelts for winter provisions, but, in 1815, nobody returns.  Brigitte and Ginger are lost with their horse in the Canadian wilderness when they come across a seemingly abandoned camp. An elderly Indian woman, who warns them that they must kill a boy to prevent one sister from killing the other, gives them each a pendant. As their startled horse runs off, Brigitte's foot is caught in a trap. Ginger seeks help, but the hunter frees Brigitte before she returns. He leads them to Fort Bailey, where they take refuge. Ginger says they are the daughters of a drowned trader and are seeking passage east.  Werewolves have besieged the fort for some time. Murphy, the fort's physician, inspects Brigitte’s wound and applies a leech, surreptitiously testing for [[werewolf]] infection. They are given a room that belonged to Wallace's son. Awakened by a voice, Ginger investigates the corridors, where she eventually finds the source: a deformed boy kept in a small, bolted unlit room; he bites her shoulder as he flees.  When Ginger and Brigitte attempt to leave, James confronts them. While Ginger and James are fighting, werewolves attack, killing one of the residents. Reverend Gilbert leads the sisters to an allegedly safe building, which actually contains a werewolf. The sisters run up the stairs, chased by the werewolf, but the hunter appears and kills it. As Ginger and Brigitte are going to their room Ginger's nose starts to bleed; a sign that she is infected.  The sisters discover the boy who bit Ginger is Wallace's son, Geoffrey. As Ginger sleeps, he sneaks into the bedroom and wakes her. She tries to grab him, but he gets away, taking a lock of her hair; Geoffrey then kills a man who investigates the noise, and frames Ginger for his murder. James holds Brigitte captive as the others drag Ginger away. Wallace arrives, dismisses James, and makes a deal with Brigitte: her sister's life in exchange for their silence regarding his son. Wallace and Brigitte find Ginger at the doctor's, strapped to the examination table and held at gunpoint, about to be tested with a leech. When Wallace demands they release Ginger, Murphy ignores the order. Wallace shoots him dead, which prompts the other men to leave.  Determined to kill Geoffrey, Ginger finds him as he cries at his mother's grave. He escapes and is captured instead by the men. Wallace arrives and kills his son himself. The sisters' protection at an end, Ginger is forced to leave, and Brigitte goes with her. Desperate for a cure, the sisters go to the hunter's cave, and Ginger kills their guide shortly before they arrive.  At the cave, the hunter and Indian seer woman reveal the sisters' coming had long been prophesied and that the Red and the Black would decide the destiny of the werewolf bloodline. After Brigitte enters a trance-like state, she has a vision of her destiny - the hunter attempts to kill Ginger, and she kills her sister herself. As Brigitte emerges from the trance she finds the seer is dead, killed by Ginger, who has fled. The hunter leads Brigitte back to the fort.  Back at the fort, Brigitte is taken prisoner. Gilbert tells her to beg forgiveness, but she spits in his face. Gilbert drags her out onto the parade square and prepares to burn her alive. Wallace interrupts him, runs Gilbert through with his sword, and sets him on fire. James engages Ginger in a fight, and she slashes his throat. As he falls to the ground, Ginger opens the gates and ushers in the werewolves. While the hunter holds his own against them, Wallace is soon bitten and sets the fort on fire before killing himself. The hunter urges Brigitte to kill her sister; instead, Brigitte kills the hunter and flees with her sister.  The film ends with only Ginger and Brigitte left alive huddled in the snow. When Brigitte says that she is cold, Ginger says that she is not. Brigitte then holds out her hand and presses a cut on it against a cut on Ginger's hand - mingling their blood and infecting Brigitte.

Adam says that he was at the river playing. When Paul asks who he was playing with, Adam responds that he's "not supposed to say". The next day, as the Duncans are driving on their way home over a bridge, they are slowed by a police officer. They walk to the side of the bridge to see the woman who had telephoned about her missing child the previous night, screaming at the sight of her son being retrieved by paramedics from a river where he had drowned. Paul believes Adam was involved with the child's death.  With the help of Richard, Paul examines Adam and talks to him about his visions.  He finally finds out that the school in Adam's visions is called Saint Pius and that Zachary's last name is Clark. With this information, Paul is able to track down the child's address and find a former nanny of Zachary. The nanny informs Paul that Zachary was deeply disturbed. He was bullied at school tremendously, and in wake of his emotions Paul set fire to the school. When he returned home Zachary killed his mother with a hammer before setting fire to their house, where he burned along with his mother’s body.  When he asks the nanny, Paul learns that Zachary's father was a geneticist&mdash;enough information to uncover that this man was none other than Richard Wells himself, living now under a false identity. Through the operation to clone Adam, Richard had secretly mixed Adam's DNA with that of Zachary (as the fire damaged Zachary's DNA to where it could not be cloned without the assistance of other living cells) with the hope of bringing his own son back to life, and then kidnapping him. The operation did not yield a complete success. After arguing with Richard and learning what has caused Adam's erratic behavior, Paul races home.  He finds Adam and Jessie in the shed in the woods.  He has arrived just in the nick of time to stop Adam (with Zachary's personality in control) from killing Jessie with a hammer, in nearly the same way as Zachary had killed his mother. Adam's personality manages to regain control, and everything seems to be okay.  In an attempt to shake the psychological transitions from Adam to Zachary, the Duncans escape from Richard and move to a different neighborhood. All seems well. Adam is friendly and happy, but as he is left alone in his room, Adam hears a noise in the closet. When he opens the closet door, a slightly burnt and decayed arm wearing Zachary’s jersey, reaches out from the darkness of the closet and pulls Adam in. Paul comes back to check Adam and looks in the closet, but he doesn't see anyone.  Adam then appears from behind and shocks Paul by touching him, indicating that Zachary has regained control.  
Godzilla: Final Wars
 Years after an initial attack of Tokyo in 1954, Godzilla is entrapped under ice in Antarctica after a battle with the original [[Atragon|Gotengo]]. In later years, environmental disasters cause the appearance of giant monsters and superhumans, dubbed "mutants", who are then recruited into the Earth Defense Force (EDF) to battle the monsters. An upgraded Gotengo, commanded by Captain Douglas Gordon, battles and destroys [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]], but the ship is wrecked in the process and its captain is suspended from the EDF.  Mutant soldier Shinichi Ozaki is tasked with guarding a [[United Nations|U.N.]] biologist, Dr. Miyuki Otonashi, who is sent to study a mummified monster. They are teleported to Infant Island where they encounter the Shobijin, fairies of [[Mothra]], who reveal the mummified monster as [[Gigan]], an alien cyborg sent to destroy the Earth who was ultimately defeated by Mothra. They warn that a battle between good and evil will happen soon and that Ozaki must choose a side. Giant monsters begin attacking several major cities. [[Rodan]] attacks [[New York City]], [[Anguirus]] attacks [[Shanghai]], [[Zilla (TriStar Godzilla)|Zilla]] attacks [[Sydney]], [[King Caesar]] attacks [[Okinawa]], [[Kamacuras]] attacks [[Paris]], [[Kumonga]] attacks [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Ebirah]] attacks [[Tōkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]], and [[Hedorah]] attacks an unknown location. The EDF engage the creatures, who mysteriously vanish at the same moment when an alien mothership appears over [[Tokyo]]. The aliens, named Xiliens, warn that an incoming planet called "[[Gorath]]" will soon impact the Earth. A peace pact is signed between Earth and the Xiliens. Meanwhile, Minilla, Godzilla's son, is found in the forest by a boy and his grandfather.  Distrusting the Xiliens, Ozaki, Miyuki, and her sister, Anna discover that Gorath they saw is actually a hologram and that the aliens have replaced several members of the EDF with duplicates. After their kind is exposed, killing his superior to assume command, the Xilien Controller X reveals their plans to use humans as a food source while taking control of all the mutants save Ozaki. X also has the monsters placed under his control and awakens Gigan to have them to wipe out the EDF. The group escapes with Gigan pursuing them, Gordon convincing them to travel to Antarctica to release Godzilla who easily destroys Gigan. The Gotengo then guides Godzilla into battle with the other monsters and returns to Tokyo to engage the Xiliens. After penetrating the mothership, the group is captured and brought before X as he has summoned Gorath to Earth. Though Godzilla destroys Gorath just before it crashes, it unleashes [[Monster X]] and the two monsters battle.   An upgraded Gigan aids Monster X, but is intercepted by Mothra, who is gravely wounded while managing to destroy the cyborg. In the Xilien ship, as a fight breaks out while unable to take control of the human due to the Shobijins' blessing, X reveals that both he and Ozaki are superior beings known are "Keizers". X is fatally wounded, but he triggers the ship's self-destruct as the group fall back to the Gotengo moments before the mothership explodes. Godzilla and Monster X continue their battle as the latter transforms into its true form, Keizer Ghidorah. Keizer Ghidorah initially gets the upper-hand but Godzilla emerges victorious in the end. Minilla shows up at the scene and convinces Godzilla not to destroy the Gotengo. The survivors watch Godzilla and Minilla return to the ocean.  
A Good Woman (film)
 Set in 1930, the film opens in [[New York City]], where [[femme fatale]] Mrs. Erlynne finds that she is no longer welcomed by either the high-ranking men she has seduced or the society wives she has betrayed. Selling her jewelry, she buys passage on a liner bound for [[Amalfi]], Italy, where she apparently sets her sights on newlywed Robert Windermere. When his car frequently is seen parked outside her villa, local gossips become convinced the two are having an affair.  Robert's demure wife Meg remains oblivious to the stories about the two circulating throughout the town, but when she discovers her husband's cheque register with numerous stubs indicating payments to Erlynne, she suspects the worst. What she doesn't know is that Erlynne actually is her mother, who has been [[extortion|extorting]] payments from Robert in return for keeping her secret. She is consoled with the advice, "Plain women resort to crying; pretty women go shopping."  In retaliation for what she believes is her husband's transgression, Meg wears a revealing gown to her twenty-first birthday celebration, attended by Erlynne - wearing the same dress - in the company of Lord Augustus, a wealthy, twice-divorced man who has proposed marriage to Erlynne. Complications ensue when Lord Darlington professes his love for Meg and implores her to leave her supposedly wayward husband, an invitation she accepts.  Erlynne, having found Meg's farewell note to Robert, intercepts her on Darlington's yacht, where the two are trapped when Augustus, Darlington, Robert, and friends arrive for a night of drinking. Robert is startled to see the fan he gave Meg for her birthday on board; while Meg makes a hasty escape, Erlynne reveals herself and claims she had taken it from the party in error; and Augustus, thinking his fiancée was planning a romantic rendezvous with Darlington, ends their engagement.  Robert pays Erlynne to leave Amalfi immediately and begs her not to reveal her identity to Meg. Reluctantly, she complies with his wishes, although she returns his cheque before she departs. On board the plane waiting to take her to a new life, she discovers Augustus, who presents her with the fan Meg gave him when she confessed to him all that had really happened. Erlynne accepts his renewed proposal of marriage and the two depart for places unknown.  
Goodbye Dear Moon
 In the year 2068 the Earth is plagued by [[typhoon]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[drought]]s, and [[flood]]s. Against this apocalyptic background an Argentine scientist, Carlos Nahuel Goldstein, outlines a theory: knowing that the axis of rotation of our planet is inclined due to the gravitational force exerted by the Moon, if men were able to destroy it, the Earth would be straightened and then climate would become stabilized.  While the international community rejects that reasoning, the Argentine government, without consulting the other nations, decides to send a secret mission to bomb the Moon. The project is called "Good bye, dear Moon." When the great powers find out, they threaten to apply severe [[economic sanctions]] to Argentina, forcing it to abort the mission. The crew of the Estanislao ship are left on their own, flying without control or ground support towards the [[Moon]]. The crew is made up of three Argentine astronauts: the commander ([[Gabriel Goity]]), the subcommanders Esteban Ulloa (Alexander Urdapilleta) and Silvia Rodulfo (Alejandra Flechner).  Facing an uncertain destiny, the passions among the crew build up. An extraterrestrial presence watches them and ejects the commander into space. When they are alone, Rodulfo confesses his love to Ulloa. His love made him become astronaut, so he could be near her. Affected by the confession, Ulloa gives herself to him. Unexpectedly, the extraterrestrial bursts into the ship to declare its love to Rudolfo.

Going Under (2004 film)
 Peter ([[Roger Rees]]) and his [[dominatrix]], Suzanne ([[Geno Lechner]]), develop a personal relationship during their [[sadism and masochism|sadomasochistic]] sessions and, when Suzanne quits her job, they attempt to maintain that relationship outside her workplace, without the rules and boundaries that existed in the [[sadism and masochism|S&M]] [[dungeon]].  During the opening credits, images are shown of [[fresco]]es from a villa in [[Pompeii]] called the [[Villa of the Mysteries]]. Of particular relevance to the film is a fresco depicting an angel with a whip.  Suzanne is in a dungeon setting with her client, Peter. Suzanne informs Peter that she is quitting at the end of the month, and gives in to Peter's request to see her on the outside. Their agreement causes Peter to be distracted at home with his wife, Pat ([[Kit Flanagan]]), and at his work as a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]]. Pat confronts him and, although she already knows and accepts Peter's sadomasochistic activities, she is concerned to hear of Peter's attachment to Suzanne.  Upon meeting Peter on the outside for the first time, Suzanne is unsure if she has made the right move in deciding to see him, but her curiosity overpowers her reluctance and they continue talking. Later, it becomes apparent that Suzanne is just as preoccupied by their relationship as Peter, when she is shown in bed with her girlfriend, Miko ([[Miho Nikaido]]), who notices Suzanne's distraction and confronts her about it.  Flashback to Peter, calling himself "Robert", meeting for the first time Suzanne, who was going by the name "Mistress Diana". He removes his clothes and tensely waits for her. He describes to her his favorite masochistic acts and she begins their session. They feel a connection quickly and at the end of that session, they share their real names.  In the present time, Suzanne's relationship with Miko is faltering. Peter is struggling to write a psychiatric paper, remembering his childhood of coping with a severe [[learning disability]] and [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention Deficit Disorder]].  Peter and Suzanne continue exploring their S&M relationship in flashbacks, with Peter receiving  piercings and pinching. Outside the dungeon, Peter clings to her, but also tries to analyze her or overpower her at the same time. In a meeting at a [[diner]], Suzanne tells Peter about a time in her teens when she tried to make friends with a boy named Tim in a new community by performing [[oral sex]] on him. Suzanne says she felt proud of herself until everyone at her new school found out about it. Peter suggests that if the memory did not still hurt, she would not have brought it up. He tells her about his struggles in school with a learning disability and how it still affects him. Suzanne again becomes uncomfortable with Peter's intimacy with her.  After Suzanne puts off meeting with Peter on the outside again, he goes to an S&M club, but he is unable to get in the mood and stops his dominatrix, Mistress Terry ([[Angela Forrest]]), shortly after she begins [[flagellation|flogging]] him. He leaves a pleading message on Suzanne's answering machine. Rather than meet with him again, she goes to Philadelphia for a one-time session with an old client, facilitated by Suzanne's former [[madam]], Juno ([[Phyllis Somerville]]). When she returns to [[New York City]], she gets news that her mother, Gretchen ([[Jenny Sterlin]]), has cancer. She calls Peter to drive her to her mother's house. Suzanne and her mother are shown to have a tense relationship, causing her to lean on Peter after the visit.  Peter drives Suzanne back to her apartment and they go inside. They begin passionately kissing for the first time. Suzanne says that she will never be comfortable with how they met, and although she seems to want more, she stops Peter before he [[sexual intercourse|penetrates]] her. She leaves the room only to return and begin to allow Peter to touch her again sexually, at which point her face goes blank and she collapses in his arms, sinking to the floor. Peter sits with her for a while and returns home.  Days later, they meet again outdoors. Suzanne says she cannot allow herself to want Peter. He says he understands how she feels but does not want to lose her, but Suzanne ends the relationship anyway.  In the final scene, Peter and Pat are sitting lakeside. Peter apologizes for the things he has done to hurt her through his relationship with Suzanne. Finally, in a [[voice-over]] telephone conversation, Peter asks Suzanne if they can meet on the outside again, and Suzanne says it will not be any different than it was a year ago. Peter falls silent.  
Grande École (film)
 Paul is an upper-class young man who is about to start at a ''[[grande école]],'' one of the system of mostly public colleges to which students are admitted based on a highly competitive process and whose graduates often gain prestigious employment. He has chosen to live with two new roommates instead of his girlfriend Agnès.  As a result, with his studies, he has little time to see her. Agnès perceives cracks in their relationship when she suspects Paul's attraction to one of his new roommates, the aristocratic Louis-Arnault.  Paul denies any homosexual attraction, but Agnès decides to make a bet with him: whichever of them beds Louis-Arnault first, wins.  If she does, Paul must stop exploring his sexuality; if he does, she will leave him.  Before the bet plays out, Paul meets Mécir, a young Arab worker, who becomes besotted with him. With Mécir, Paul goes on a journey of discovery that changes many of his ideas about class, cultural differences and sexuality.  
Le Grand Voyage
 Réda ([[Nicolas Cazalé]]) is a French-Moroccan teenager due to sit for [[Baccalauréat]]. When his devout father (played by Mohamed Majd) asks Réda to accompany him on a [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]], he reluctantly agrees. However, the father insists that they travel by [[car]]. As both embark on a road trip thousands of kilometers away from [[southern France]], the once-icy father-and-son relationship starts to thaw as both gradually come to know each other.  Réda speaks only in [[French language|French]] to his father, who is seen speaking only [[Arabic]] for the majority of the film.  Later, when necessary, the father proves that he, in fact, speaks impeccable French; his choice to speak only Arabic to his son is, therefore, purposeful.<ref></ref>  Along the way, the two meet several interesting characters. They encounter an aged woman clad in black. Though they attempt to leave her behind, she repeatedly reappears in various scenes. The son learns about Islam and why his father thought it would be preferable to make the pilgrimage by car rather than by plane. Throughout the trip, different situations expose how different the father and son are through their actions and outlooks. In one instance, after the father claimed to have been robbed, Réda refuses to part with any of the remaining money when a mother with a child asks him for some, but his father readily gives the woman money.   During their journey, Réda dreams that he is watching his father herding goats, but does not respond when he calls out for his father to save him from quicksand.  After all their hardships, they reach Mecca but the father dies soon after the first day. That night, he is still looking for his father, but instead, sees a person herding goats who barely glances at him. After he finds out his father dies, he sells his car and gives to a beggar on the street.  The route taken by the father and son goes from Provence, [[France]] through [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]] before reaching [[Saudi Arabia]].  
The Great Water
 Based on a children's book written by [[Živko Čingo]] in the 1970s, the movie is about the difficult transition in Macedonia after [[World War II]]. The film begins in the present as old Lem (Meto Jovanovski), Macedonian politician who is experiencing a heart attack and while he is being wheeled into a hospital and examined and wired, he has memory flashbacks to his childhood in 1945. He is brought to the 'orphanage' where orphans are children of the enemies of the new regime. There he learns how to adjust to the role of obedient brainwashing. He becomes mesmerized by a new kid, Isak, a beautiful and charismatic boy. The struggles quietly underplaying all of the camp surface activity are many: the dichotomy of a Communist ideology removing the Church from existence with a people dependent upon the spiritual values of religion, the Stalin/Tito issue, the adjustments to the policies of Communist regime in a country where fierce national pride had ruled, and the depersonalization of children into political pawns despite the need for role models and the luxury of growing up with friends and confidants.  
Grayson (film)
 While no cohesive plot is apparent from the vignette style of the trailer, it can be pieced together that [[Batman]] has been murdered, and his killer remains at large. Dick Grayson is long since retired from his superhero days and raising a family with to his wife [[Barbara Gordon]]. After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the [[Nightwing]] identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.<ref name="comicbookbin"/>  [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the [[Batman (TV Series)|1960's Batman TV series]], who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's "crimefighting days are over") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle/Catwoman]] to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter [[Clark Kent]] that he wants "him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon. * Grayson is aware of [[Superman]]'s secret identity; he addresses him as "Clark". Superman apparently is also motivated (obviously from O'Hara) to discourage Grayson's return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume. Grayson is also angered to violence by the sight of a Superman comic book, suggesting a strongly negative history between the two. Other comic books also appear of characters from the film, including [[Wonder Woman]] and Catwoman. Fiorella used his own comic book collection for this scene.  * Longtime Batman villains [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] and [[Riddler|The Riddler]] briefly appear, with a larger role taken by [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]. A brief scene adapted from ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' appears, with Barbara Gordon crawling away from a door as the Joker breaks in. Afterwards, the Joker is seen walking through a park with the Graysons' daughter. * In three brief appearances, Wonder Woman is shown deflecting bullets from her bracelets, snaring Robin in her golden lasso, and mourning over what appears to be the body of Superman. * [[Green Lantern|The Green Lantern]] (caucasian and dark-haired, suggesting either [[Hal Jordan]] or [[Kyle Rayner]]) has a momentary appearance, standing next to a fallen Robin, though the context is unexplained. *All in all, the trailer suggests the [[Justice League]] wants to stop Grayson from announcing Batman's death. The filmmakers clarified that it was never their intention to portray the other superheroes as villains. They might be rather ordered to stop Dick because he is heading down a dangerous road.<ref name="comicbookbin"/>  It is implied that Batman may not actually be dead, and Fiorella's commentary on the "Behind the Scenes" video confirms that this ambiguity was his goal: "I wanted to make people wonder if in fact Batman had really been killed."  
Gowri (film)
 Gowri ([[Sumanth]]) is a motorcycle mechanic living in Dhoolpet area of [[Hyderabad]]. Shweta ([[Charmme Kaur]]) is a college student who is the daughter of media baron Chandra Shekhar (Vizag Prasad). Gowri and Shweta fall in love with each other to the disapproval of Chandra Shekhar. He seeks the help of a mafia leader Sarkar ([[Atul Kulkarni]]) to separate Gowri and Shweta. The rest of the story is all about how Gowri overcomes Shweta's father and Sarkar to gain Shweta's hand in marriage.

The Doctor asks his friend about his take on the story.The friend replies that there is no way to tell what exactly happened but must take into consideration that  Kanakayya did get better. perhaps there was an illicit relationship with Kanakkaya and Saradamba.The Doctor counters by saying that it might have been merely a coincidence that Kanakkayas fever broke after the application of blood.The friend replies that there is no way to conclude this and that the nature of the relationship is only known to two people, Kanakkaya and Saradamaba.  At this point the doctor reveals that he is Kanakkaya and that there was nothing illicit between him and Saradamba.He moved out of his house, went to Madras to become a Doctor and changed his name.

"Unless you believe in some principles to be true, there can be no peace. The intellect of all those who say "this is all we know, this what there is" is weak and fatigued. Perhaps there is another explanation, another truth, perhaps we don't know it yet!"- [[Gudipati Venkatachalam|Chalam]]  
The Grudge
 ''The Grudge'' describes a [[curse]] that is born when someone dies in the grip of a powerful [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] or extreme [[Suffering|sorrow]]. The curse is an [[entity]] created where the person died. Those who encounter this [[supernatural]] force die, and the curse is reborn repeatedly, passed from victim to victim in an endless, growing chain of horror. The following events are explained in their actual order; the original film is presented in a nonlinear narrative.  The Saeki family lived happily in suburban [[Tokyo]], but housewife [[Kayako Saeki]] fell in love with her college professor, Peter Kirk, obsessively writing about him in her diary. Her husband Takeo discovered the diary. Believing Kayako was having an affair, he became mentally disturbed and brutally murdered his wife. He then drowned his young son Toshio - who witnessed his mother's murder - in the bathtub, along with the pet cat, Mar. Takeo hid the bodies in the house before Kayako's ghost murdered him. Peter came to the Saeki house to speak to Kayako after receiving a letter from her, only to find her corpse. Shocked, he fled, killing himself the next day. The Saeki family rose again as ghosts due to the curse, notably Kayako, who appears as an ''[[onryō]]'' ghost.  The present timeline starts a few years later, with the Williams family moving in from [[United States|America]]. While husband Matt is thrilled with the house, his wife Jennifer and [[dementia]]-ridden mother Emma feel uncomfortable. Matt and Jennifer are killed by Toshio. Yoko, a [[Care work|care worker]], arrives at the house to find Emma alone, and encounters Kayako, who attacks her. Concerned about Yoko's disappearance, her employer Alex sends another care worker, [[Karen Davis (The Grudge)|Karen Davis]], to take over the care for Emma. At the house, Karen is shocked when she finds Toshio and Mar, and contacts Alex for help.  Alex finds Emma dead and Karen in a state of shock after her encounter with Kayako, and summons the police, including Detective Nakagawa. Nakagawa and his partner Igarashi find the bodies of Matt and Jennifer in the attic along with a human's lower jaw. Matt's sister Susan disappears after being attacked by Kayako, and Alex is killed as he was leaving work by Yoko's ghost, seen missing her lower jaw. Karen begins to be haunted by Kayako, informing her boyfriend Doug of the situation. She researches the house, eventually confronting Nakagawa, who explains three of his colleagues investigating the Saeki deaths all were consumed by the curse. That night, Nakagawa tries to burn down the house, but is killed by Takeo.  Karen races to the house upon learning Doug has gone there to look for her, experiencing a vision in which she sees Peter visiting the house and finding Kayako's corpse. Karen finds Doug paralyzed by fear, and attempts to flee with him, only to witness Kayako crawl on Doug, who dies of fright. Karen spots the petrol and manages to ignite it just as Kayako is about to kill her. Karen is whisked to a hospital, but learns the house survived the fire. Visiting Doug's body, Karen realizes she is still haunted by Kayako.  
Gunner Palace
 The film documents the operations of 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, an element of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] beginning in the late summer of 2003 until the unit was relieved by [[3rd Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment]], of the [[39th Brigade Combat Team]], an element of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] in April 2004.  The soldiers were stationed in the [[Adhamiyah]] neighborhood of Baghdad which lies between the Tigris river on the west and Sadr City on the east. The unit's Forward Operating Base was at a former Presidential Palace, known as Adhamiyah Palace.  ===Adhamiyah Palace, a.k.a. Fort Apache, a.k.a.

 Sarah ([[Asia Argento]]) becomes involved with a series of men who treat her and Jeremiah ([[Jimmy Bennett]]) poorly, and she uses them as an excuse to abandon her son. She disappears to [[Atlantic City]] with her boyfriend, Emerson ([[Jeremy Renner]]), and then abandons him; Emerson returns to their home and [[rape]]s Jeremiah. After a trip to hospital, Jeremiah's grandmother ([[Ornella Muti]]) takes him to a [[West Virginia]]n radical [[Christian]] [[cult]] led by his grandfather ([[Peter Fonda]]). After he has been three years with the cult, Sarah returns to reclaim the 11-year-old Jeremiah ([[Dylan Sprouse|Dylan]] and [[Cole Sprouse]]).  Sarah's current lover, Kenny ([[Matt Schulze (actor)|Matt Schulze]]), a truck driver, eventually abandons them at a truck stop while Sarah is soliciting. Sarah realizes that if she is going to keep her men she cannot say Jeremiah is her son. She persuades Jeremiah to [[Cross dressing|cross dress]] so he can act as her "little sister", and Jeremiah's cross-dressing evolves to include his mother's seduction techniques. After dressing up as a "baby doll" version of Sarah which consisted of her makeup, her white nightgown and her red High Heel Pumps, Jeremiah (although the audience sees Asia Argento as Jeremiah because this scene could not be done with child actors as it was too inappropriate) seduces Jackson ([[Marilyn Manson]]), his mother's latest man, who initially tries to rebuff the boy's advances, but then gives in. Sarah is furious with Jackson for giving in to the boy's advances and with Jeremiah for ruining her panties with drops of blood on them, and she takes Jeremiah and leaves.  Later, they are in a house where the basement houses a [[Methamphetamine|methamphetamine laboratory]], which later blows up with Sarah's latest boyfriend inside. After fleeing, and while detoxing from methamphetamine, Sarah is convinced that everyone is after them and that only certain foods are edible (mainly chips and soda). She convinces Jeremiah that if they eat anything but those foods, they will be poisoned which leads them to a failed attempt to shoplift at a grocery store; afterwards, Jeremiah finds a hamburger to eat from a dumpster. His mother, in a state of "meth psychosis", is convinced the food he ate was poison, and makes him drink [[ipecac]] in order to make him better and rid him of any "poisons".  Jeremiah wakes up in the hospital with his grandmother beside him. She tells him that Sarah is in the psychiatric ward. Later that night, Sarah collects Jeremiah from his hospital room, and, rather than have him go back to the cult, she clutches his hand and they walk away in hospital gowns. The final scene is of Sarah and Jeremiah driving away.  
Head in the Clouds
 In a [[prologue]] set in [[Paris]] in the year 1924, a young 14-year-old Gilda Bessé, the daughter of a [[French people|French]] aristocrat and an emotionally unstable [[United States|American]] mother, reluctantly is told by a [[Fortune-telling|fortune teller]] that the [[Chiromancy|life line on her palm]] doesn't extend past the age of 34. Fast forward to a rainy night in 1933, when Gilda stumbles into the room of Guy Malyon, an [[Irish people|Irishman]] who is a first-year [[scholarship]] student at [[Cambridge University]]. She has had a lover's quarrel with one of the [[University don|dons]], and rather than turn her out into the storm, Guy gallantly allows her to spend the night. Later, they become lovers, but the two are separated when Gilda's mother dies and she opts to leave [[England]]. A few years later, Guy sees her as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] in a [[Hollywood]] film, and shortly after he coincidentally receives a letter from her inviting him to visit her in Paris, where she's working as a [[photography|photographer]].  Guy discovers that Gilda is living with the [[Spain|Spanish-born]] nursing student/model Mia and has a lover, whom she quickly discards when Guy moves in. The trio are enjoying their unusual living arrangement, but world events are beginning to affect their existence. It is the height of the [[Spanish Civil War]], and idealistic Guy, a long-time supporter of the army of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], is determined to do what he can to help them as [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[fascism|fascists]] gain strength. Mia, too, is anxious to come to the aid of her native land. Gilda, however, has no interest in politics or anything else that might disrupt her life of luxury, and pleads with the two to ignore the conflict, but they feel compelled to act and depart for Spain.  By January 1938, Guy becomes a soldier, while Mia becomes a nurse and tends to the wounded. They cross paths one night and, before sleeping with Guy, Mia confesses she was Gilda's lover. In the morning, her ambulance is destroyed by a [[land mine]] resulting in Mia's death as well as the ambulance driver. A few months later in July 1938, Guy returns to Paris, where he is ignored by Gilda, who feels his abandonment of her was a form of betrayal.  Six years later, Guy is working as a spy with the underground in occupied Paris under the auspices of [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|British intelligence]]. He learns that Gilda has taken [[Nazism|Nazi]] Major Franz Bietrich as a lover and visits her in their old apartment, where the two make love. The following morning she tells him their affair is over and the two can never see each other again. [[D-Day]] is approaching, and Guy throws himself into his work. One day he arrives at a café to meet a contact, but instead is approached by Gilda, who has overheard her German lover plotting a trap and has come to help him escape in cleric's clothing she has concealed in the restaurant's [[washroom]]. That night, he and his associates destroy a rail station, but only Guy manages to elude the German soldiers.  Guy returns to [[London]], where he discovers Gilda joined the [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]] a few years earlier. With the [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation of Paris]] having come to an end, he realizes that the locals, who had long regarded Gilda as a Nazi sympathizer and [[treason|traitor]], will seek revenge. As he returns to Paris to find her, Guy is unaware that Bietrich has been killed in Gilda's apartment and that she has been taken captive by a mob intent on avenging the deaths of their loved ones. She is finally killed, off-camera, by a local youth to avenge the death of his sister. The movie ends with Guy in Gilda's ransacked apartment reading the last letter written by her to him.

Hellbent (2004 film)
 The night before [[Halloween]], a gay couple are making out in a car when a bare-chested killer in a devil mask (Nick Name  Kent Bradley James) appears and [[decapitation|decapitates]] them with a [[sickle]].  Halloween finds Eddie (Dylan Fergus) at his job as a police technician talking with his police officer sister. He distributes flyers about the murders and dresses in his father's police uniform for a Halloween costume. While distributing the flyers, he meets Jake (Bryan Kirkwood) in a tattoo shop.  Eddie meets with his friends Chaz (Andrew Levitas), Joey (Hank Harris), and Tobey (Matt Phillips), and they head for the [[West Hollywood, California#West Hollywood Halloween Carnival|West Hollywood Halloween Carnival]]. They visit the murder scene, where the devil-masked killer appears. They taunt him because they think he's [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] them.  Eddie and his friends enter the carnival, and Eddie sees Jake coming in as well. Eddie leaves to find Jake. Joey sees a man on whom he's had a crush on for weeks entering one of the dance venues. Chaz encourages Joey to talk to the man, but when he does Joey is cruelly turned down. Chaz goes to the restroom with Joey to console him, then waits for Joey outside. Chaz takes ecstasy and leaves when he sees a good-looking man walk past. Joey's crush comes into the bathroom and apologizes, leaving Joey ecstatically happy. Just then, the killer emerges from a bathroom stall and decapitates Joey, taking his head as a trophy.  Chaz goes into another dance venue, where the killer catches up with him on the dance floor. In his drugged state, Chaz doesn't realize that the killer is slashing his torso with the scythe. The killer then decapitates Chaz while the crowd dances on (thinking it is a Halloween gag).  Tobey, drunk and angry that no one's hitting on him while he's in his Halloween drag, spots the killer, who's still carrying Joey and Chaz's heads in [[trick or treat]] bags. Tobey pursues the killer, who dismisses him. When Tobey partially removes his drag costume, the killer returns and decapitates him as well.  Eddie finally finds Jake. They go to the first dance venue but find it closed following the discovery of Joey's body. Jake climbs over a tall chain-link fence to retrieve his motorcycle, and Eddie goes after him. On his motorcycle, Jake heads for the exit to circle around and return to Eddie. The killer finds Eddie inside the closed dance venue and attacks him. Eddie locks himself in a shallow chain-link enclosure. The killer slashes at Eddie with his scythe; the tip of the blade just touches Eddie's glass eye. Jake arrives with a police officer, and the killer leaves.  Eddie and Jake give their statements at police headquarters. Jake learns that Eddie wanted to be a policeman like his father, but he'd lost an eye in a training accident and having a glass eye means he cannot join the force. The two go to Eddie's place and start having sex. Jake handcuffs Eddie to his bed and searches for condoms. As Jake is returning, the killer stabs him and leaves him for dead. Eddie hears the struggle and calls out. As the killer approaches and Eddie struggles with the cuffs, Jake hits the killer from behind with a baseball bat. Eddie slips a hand out of the cuffs, tends to Jake's wound, and heads off to call an ambulance, but the killer wakes and disables the phone. Eddie runs to the kitchen. He finds a knife but also finds the heads of Joey, Chaz, and Tobey in a closet. Eddie evades the killer and retreats to his bedroom, locking Jake and himself in. As the killer chops at the door, Eddie retrieves his father's gun and some bullets. Eddie pushes Jake onto the fire escape and loads the gun. The killer breaks down the door and attacks Eddie, knocking him out the window and over the fire escape railing. As Eddie dangles from the fire escape, the killer turns toward Jake. Eddie fires the gun, grazing Jake (as Eddie lacks the stereoscopic vision and depth perception to aim well). Eddie fires again, hitting the killer in the forehead.  The film ends with Jake taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and Eddie promising to be there when he wakes up. Eddie's sister gloats over the fallen killer, but Eddie realizes the man is still alive. In the final moment, the killer opens his eyes and grins hideously, disclosing that he has Eddie's artificial eye clenched between his teeth.  
Heaven's Bookstore
 Kenta ([[Tetsuji Tamayama]]), a classically trained pianist, is fired from his orchestra, and gets drunk in a bar.  He wakes up the following morning in what turns out to be a bookstore in heaven.  The owner of the bookstore had brought him there, and explains that people live to be 100; people who die before this age go to heaven to live out the rest of their allotted time, before they are reborn on earth.  In heaven he meets Shoko ([[Yūko Takeuchi]]), a pianist who he had admired on earth.  Together, they start work on a special composition that she had started writing on earth.  Meanwhile, on earth, Shoko's niece Natsuko (also played by Yūko Takeuchi) wants to organise a fireworks display that was discontinued twelve years ago.  It turns out that Shoko had been engaged to Takimoto ([[Teruyuki Kagawa]]), a talented firework maker, but her hearing had been damaged by a firework accident he caused.  As a result, she stopped playing music, he stopped making fireworks, they split up, and later she died.  Natsuko wants Takimoto to make his special 'loving fireworks' for the fireworks display. These are the special fireworks that inspired Shoko to compose her special composition, uncompleted when Takimoto stopped making them.  He is vehnemently opposed to making fireworks again.  However, at the end of the firework display 'loving fireworks' unexpectedly appear in the sky, set-off by Takimoto. Kenta returns to earth and plays Shoko's now completed composition to accompany them. Natsuko and Kenta meet.  She asks how he knows the piece, to which he responds that he met 'her'. In the end they start laughing together (as the credits begin to roll).  
Hellboy (2004 film)
 In 1944, with the help of Russian mystic [[Grigori Rasputin (Hellboy)|Grigori Rasputin]], the Nazis build a dimensional portal off the coast of [[Scotland]] and intend to free the [[Ogdru Jahad]]—monstrous entities imprisoned in deep space—to aid them in defeating the [[Allies]]. Rasputin opens the portal with the aid of his disciples, Ilsa von Haupstein and [[Obersturmbannführer]] [[Karl Ruprecht Kroenen]], member of the [[Thule Society]] and Adolf Hitler's top assassin. An Allied team is sent to destroy the portal, guided by a young scientist named Trevor Bruttenholm, who is well-versed in the occult. The German team is killed and the portal is destroyed—in the process absorbing Rasputin—while Haupstein and Kroenen escape. The Allied team discovers that an infant demon with a right hand of stone came through the portal; they dub him "[[Hellboy]]" and Bruttenholm adopts him.  Sixty years later, FBI agent John Myers is transferred to the [[Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense]] (BPRD) at the request of Bruttenholm, where he meets the adult Hellboy and a psychic, amphibious humanoid named [[Abe Sapien]]. He learns that a third BPRD member, [[Liz Sherman]], has recently checked into a mental hospital to protect others from her volatile [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] abilities. Despite regular visits and coaxing from Hellboy, she is determined not to return. Kroenen and Haupstein resurrect Rasputin in the mountains of [[Moldova]] and the three unleash a demon known as [[Samael|Sammael]]. Rasputin imbues Sammael with the power to reincarnate and split his essence, causing two of the creature's eggs to hatch and mature each time one dies. Rasputin visits Liz as she sleeps, activating her powers and almost destroying the hospital. Myers convinces her to return to the Bureau.  Sammael's ability to multiply becomes a problem, as Hellboy repeatedly kills it, dozens are born. Concluding the eggs are in the sewer, Hellboy, Abe and several FBI agents go down the sewer to destroy them. Abe is injured while looking for the eggs, while Kroenen kills most of the agents. Kroenen, whose mutilated body is run by mechanical parts, shuts himself down, pretending to be defeated. Kroenen's body is brought to the bureau. FBI Director [[Tom Manning (comics)|Tom Manning]] is angered by Hellboy's recklessness. Myers takes Liz out for coffee and to talk. Hellboy, jealous, covertly follows them, leaving the bureau unguarded. Kroenen reanimates himself and Rasputin appears at the bureau, confronting Professor Bruttenholm. Rasputin offers him a vision of the future, showing Hellboy is the agent that will destroy the world. Rasputin, respecting Bruttenholm for raising Hellboy, directs a quick death. Bruttenholm is stabbed in the neck by Kroenen and dies clutching a [[rosary]].  Manning takes over the BPRD and locates Rasputin's mausoleum in an old cemetery outside [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. A team led by Manning and Hellboy enters the mausoleum, but swiftly becomes separated. Hellboy and Manning find their way to Kroenen's lair and defeat him. Hellboy reunites with Liz and Myers at Sammael's new nest, but the creatures overwhelm them. Liz uses her pyrokinetic powers to incinerate the Sammaels and their eggs. Hellboy, Liz and Myers lose consciousness and are captured by Rasputin and Haupstein. Rasputin sucks Liz's soul out of her body, then tells Hellboy to release the [[Ogdru Jahad]] in return for her soul. Hellboy awakens his true power as Anung un Rama, causing his horns to regrow, and begins to release the Ogdru Jahad. Myers breaks out of his restraints, subdues Haupstein, and reminds Hellboy that he can defy his destiny. Remembering his true self and what Bruttenholm brought him up to be, Hellboy breaks his horns, reseals the Ogdru Jahad and stabs Rasputin with one of his broken horns.  Instead of dying, though, Rasputin is possessed by a creature from the Ogdru Jahad. The tentacled [[Behemoth]] bursts out of his body and grows to immense size, killing him and Haupstein. Hellboy allows himself to be swallowed by the beast, then detonates a belt of [[hand grenade]]s and destroys it from the inside. He whispers something in Liz's ear and she is revived. When she asks how her soul was returned, Hellboy replies that he said "Hey, you on the other side, let her go, because for.. for her I'll cross over, and then you'll be sorry'. Liz and Hellboy share a kiss.  
Hellbreeder
 English police are baffled after a number of children are brutally murdered. Alice (Uphill) takes a profound interest in the murders as her own son, Daniel, was killed years ago and she is haunted by recurring nightmares. The event replays in her mind, as she remembers walking her son home late one night when they stop to rest on a park bench. They sit next to a clown, who gives Daniel a balloon. A man then rushes at them from the darkness and kills Daniel, injuring his mother. Alice clearly remembers the man's face. The same man has been spotted close to each of the murders in the current slayings. She confides this to Detective Weiss, the investigating officer.  Alice finds and confronts the man, and holds a gun to his head but can't bring herself to kill him. She instead takes him prisoner in an effort to hear his story. The man's name is Sam and informs Alice that he is hunting a creature from hell who kills children. Alice is unsure whether to believe him when she receives a call informing her that another child has been killed in front of witnesses, who report the murderer as being a clown. It is now that she comes to the realization that it wasn't Sam who killed her child but the clown and that her memory was wrong. She agrees to help Sam, who has been present at the murders not as a perpetrator but as the hunter of the monster, known as the Hellbreed.  Meanwhile, Detective Weiss has pulled up Alice's files and it is revealed that she has been committed to a mental institution in 1989. She escaped in 1995 and is still wanted by the authorities.

Hidalgo (film)
  In 1890, Franklin T. Hopkins and his mustang, Hidalgo, are part of [[Buffalo Bill]]'s [[Wild West]] show, where they are advertised as "the world's greatest endurance horse and rider." Hopkins had been a famous long-distance rider, a cowboy, and a dispatch rider for the United States government; in the latter capacity he carried a message to the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment]] authorizing the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] of [[Lakota Sioux]].   Wealthy [[Sheikh]] Riyadh has sent his attaché Aziz, accompanied by Rau Rasmussen, to ask the show to either stop using the phrase "the world's greatest endurance horse and rider" or allow Hopkins and Hidalgo to prove themselves by entering into the "Ocean of Fire": an annual 3,000-mile race across the [[Najd]] desert region. The Sheikh is custodian of the ''[[al Khamsa|al-Khamsa]]'' line, considered to be the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred [[Arabian horse|Arabian horses]] and [[Bedouin]] or [[Arab]] riders.   In addition to the grueling conditions, prevailing animosity and contempt for a Christian "[[infidel]]" and “impure” horse, horse and rider face stiff competition, including the wealthy and unscrupulous British horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport.  To complicate matters, Sheikh Riyadh has promised his daughter, Jazira, his only surviving child, in marriage to the rider of his horse, should he win. She hopes to prevent this by giving Hopkins advice and information to help him win, thereby resulting in greater danger for them both. Sheikh Riyadh's outcast brigand nephew, who will stop at nothing to gain control of the al-Khamsa line, raids the race camp, kidnaps Jazira, and threatens to kill her unless he gets his uncle's prize stallion racer as her ransom. Hopkins manages to rescue Jazira. However, Davenport and the Sheikh's nephew try to sabotage the race by eliminating the rival riders, but are thwarted when Hopkins kills the nephew.  For Hopkins the Ocean of Fire becomes not only a matter of pride, honor and survival, but of identity: it emerges that his father was European American while his mother was Lakota Sioux. The Lakota call him “Blue Child” or “Far Rider.” As a [[Mixed-race|half-breed]] he feels sympathy and pity for his mother's people, but does not generally reveal his heritage, especially after the [[Wounded Knee massacre]], for which he feels partly responsible. Jazira compares his relation to his heritage to her desire to avoid wearing the [[sartorial hijab|veil]], saying that he mustn't "go through life hiding what God made you....like me."   Nearing the end of the race, Hidalgo is severely injured, and Hopkins is dying of thirst. He considers shooting Hidalgo to alleviate his suffering, but is unable to bring himself to do it. Kneeling, he chants a prayer to ''[[Wakan Tanka]]'' as a possible death song, and images of Lakota elders and his mother appear before him before Hidalgo suddenly struggles up, and Hopkins rides bareback to come from behind to win the race. Hopkins wins the respect and admiration of the Arabs, and becomes friends with the Sheikh, giving him his revolver as a gift. As he bids farewell to an unveiled Jazira, she asks him if he is fulfilling the traditional Western tales' ending where the cowboy rides away into the setting sun and calls him Blue Child as she smiles kindly at him and turns to go.  Returning to the United States, Hopkins uses his winnings to buy a herd of mustangs that by government order are about to be culled to force [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to convert to farming. Hopkins has the horses released and frees Hidalgo to join them in the wilderness. The epilogue states that Hopkins went on to reportedly win 400 long-distance races and was an outspoken supporter for wild mustangs until his death in 1951, while Hidalgo's descendants live free in the wilderness in and around Oklahoma.

The Hidden Blade
 The film takes place in Japan in the 1860s, a time of [[cultural assimilation]].  Two samurai, Munezo Katagiri ([[Masatoshi Nagase]]) and Samon Shimada ([[Hidetaka Yoshioka]]), bid farewell to their friend, Yaichiro Hazama (Yukiyoshi Ozawa), who is to serve in [[Edo]] (present-day [[Tokyo]]) under the shogunate of that region.  Though the position is desirable, Katagiri voices his concern that a man of Yaichiro’s character is likely to run into trouble.  His doubts are assured when the married Yaichiro expresses an intention to indulge in Edo’s sensual pleasures while stationed there.   During dinner that evening, Katagiri’s mother reminds Samon of the financial hardships the family has endured since the death of her husband (who committed [[Seppuku|ritual suicide]] after a construction job gone wrong).  She desires a match between Samon and Shino ([[Tomoko Tabata]]), Katagiri’s sister.  Also present is Kie ([[Takako Matsu]]), the Katagiri’s housekeeper, who is schooled in etiquette and literacy.  In a voiceover, Katagiri hints at an affection for Kie, but then mentions that around the same time Shino married Samon, Kie married a man of the merchant class and left the Katagiri household.  Three years go by during which Katagiri's mother passes away.  While walking through town, he sees Kie in a kimono shop where she assures him that she is well.  Weeks later, however, Shino tells Katagiri that from the start of her marriage, Kie has been forced to perform all manner of duties to the point that she is little more than a slave to her new family.  Concerned, Katagiri visits Mrs. Iseya (Sachiko Mitsumoto), Kie’s mother-in-law, and finds her incoherent with illness.  Outraged, he demands that Kie’s husband file divorce papers then carries her to his own house to recover.  In the midst of everything, the changing times have forced Katagiri and his fellow samurai to learn the art of Western weaponry, a thing that the elder members of the clan treat with disdain.  Word arrives from Edo that government officials thwarted an uprising against the shogun and that Yaichiro, Katagiri’s friend, was involved.  After being brought back to the village in a prisoner's cage, Yaichiro is denied the honor of ritual suicide and must live out the remainder of his days in a cell.  Believing that Yaichiro’s friends are complicit, Hori ([[Ken Ogata]]), the clan’s chief retainer, demands that Katagiri identify them, but he refuses, citing his honor as a samurai, and is violently dismissed.  Meanwhile, Kie has since recovered and is once again Katagiri’s housekeeper.  Though their fondness for one other is evident, both are keenly aware of their difference in social class and act accordingly.  Despite this, gossip prompts Katagiri to send Kie back to the countryside to live with her father.  Shortly after, Yaichiro breaks out of prison and takes a family hostage.  Hori demands that Katagiri dispatch him.    Knowing that Yaichiro is the better swordsman, Katagiri visits their former teacher ([[Min Tanaka]]), who is now a farmer, and learns a dangerous maneuver that involves turning ones back on the enemy.  The next day, Katagiri arrives on the outskirts of the village and attempts to persuade Yaichiro to surrender.  When the latter refuses (accusing Hori and the other leaders of incompetence), the two engage in single combat during which Katagiri uses the new technique to deliver a mortal blow.  A dying Yaichiro attempts the same, but is gunned down by foot soldiers hiding in the woods.  Knowing that this is a blatant dishonor to a samurai, Katagiri is dismayed.  On returning to the village, he runs into Yaichiro’s wife ([[Reiko Takashima]]) who reveals that she paid a visit to Hori the night before and exchanged sexual favors for his promise to keep Yaichiro alive (a promise that was never fulfilled).  Bound by an oath to commit suicide should Yaichiro die, she takes her own life.  Unsure of his fealty, Katagiri approaches Hori with his treachery, to which he crudely admits.  Realizing that the Hazamas were victims of a corrupt system, Katagiri avenges them both by stabbing Hori in the heart with a thin blade (the technique known as “the hidden blade” which leaves almost no trace of blood (in the original Japanese version the technique is actually called "the demon's claw/scratch", the wound was so small it appeared to be caused by nonhuman sources) ).  Katagiri buries the blade at the Hazama’s grave as a form of atonement and relinquishes his samurai status.  Resolved to become a tradesman, he leaves the village for the island of [[Ezo]] (modern day [[Hokkaido]]), but not before seeing Kie.  With custom no longer a breach, Katagiri proposes marriage and Kie accepts.  The film ends with them sitting on a hill holding hands, pondering a future together.

Home on the Range (2004 film)
  Maggie is the only cow left on the Dixon Ranch after Alameda Slim (a cattle rustler capable of stealing 500 in a single night) stole all the rest of Mr. Dixon's cattle. Dixon sells Maggie to Pearl, a kind and elderly woman who runs a small farm called Patch of Heaven. The local Sheriff arrives to tell Pearl that her bank is cracking down on debtors. Pearl has three days to pay the bank $750, or her farm will be sold to the highest bidder. Hearing this, Maggie convinces the other cows on the farm (Grace, a happy-go-lucky character, and Mrs. Caloway, who has had leadership go to her head) to go to town to attempt winning prize money at a fair. While the cows are in town, a bounty hunter named Rico (whom Buck, the Sheriff's horse, idolizes) drops a criminal off and collects the reward. Stating he needs a replacement horse to go after Alameda Slim while his own horse rests, he takes Buck. When Maggie find out that the reward for capturing Slim is exactly $750, she convinces the other cows to try to capture him to save Patch of Heaven.  That night, they hide among a large herd of [[cattle|steers]], when Alameda Slim appears. Before any of them can do anything, Slim begins a [[yodeling]] song which sends all the cattle (except Grace, who is [[tone deaf]]) into a trance that causes them to dance madly and follow Slim anywhere. Grace is able to bring Maggie and Mrs. Caloway back to their senses just before Slim closes the path behind him with a rock-slide to stop Rico and his men from chasing him. As Rico discusses with his men what his next move will be, Buck starts talking with Maggie, Grace, and Mrs. Caloway as old friends and miming actions. This causes Rico to believe Buck is frightened by cows, so he sends Buck back to the Sheriff. Buck escapes, determined to capture Slim for himself to prove his worth.  Maggie, Grace, and Mrs. Caloway continue their search for Slim, determined to pass Buck and get to Slim first, but they have a fallout when they lose the trail in a downpour. Mrs. Caloway accuses Maggie of wanting to go after Slim only as a personal vendetta, arguing that she and Grace are better off without Maggie. The three spend the night under a large rock, with Maggie deciding to leave the next morning while Grace and Mrs. Caloway decide to return to Patch of Heaven to say their final farewells. The next morning, however, they are awakened by a peg-legged rabbit named Lucky Jack, who has also lost his home, an old mine, to Alameda Slim. Maggie decides to go after Slim with Lucky Jack in tow, but Grace convinces Mrs. Caloway that they help. Lucky Jack leads the three cows to Slim's hideout in Echo Mine. At the mine, Slim reveals that he has been stealing all cattle from his former patrons. When his former patrons can no longer support their land, Slim buys the land when it is auctioned off, under the guise of the respectable-looking Yancy O'Dell, using the very money he gets from selling the cattle he stole.  After arriving at Slim's hideout, the cows capture Slim. They run off with Slim's accomplices and buyer in pursuit on a steam train. Rico arrives. When the chase stops, Rico is revealed to work for Slim. Crushed by this, Buck decides to help the cows and fights Rico while setting the other cattle free. Slim dons his Yancy O'Dell costume and leaves the cows stranded in the middle of the desert with the train, while he goes to attend the auction. However, the cows arrive using the train to the farm and expose Slim. Slim is arrested, and Patch of Heaven is saved by the reward money.  A few weeks pass, and at the county fair most of the livestock on Patch of Heaven have won prizes. 'Lucky' Jack Rabbit moves in with Jebb the Goat, and two steer and Slim's charming and gentlemanly steed Junior the Buffalo arrive unexpectedly to live at Patch of Heaven, expanding the farm.  
Hotel Rwanda
 Tensions between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples lead to a civil war in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians are routine. [[Paul Rusesabagina]], manager of the [[Hôtel des Mille Collines]], is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana, is Tutsi. Their marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, including Georges Rutaganda, a goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of [[Interahamwe]], a brutal Hutu militia.  As the political situation in the country worsens following the assassination of the president, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed, initiating the early stages of the [[Rwandan Genocide|genocide]]. Paul curries favour with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbours, Paul barely negotiates their safety and brings them to the hotel. More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened [[United Nations|UN]] refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages. As the situation becomes more violent, Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength for his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning hotel.  Paul drives to collect his hotel supplies from Georges Rutaganda and witnesses Tutsi hostages being treated violently by the Hutu militia. Georges explains to Paul that the "rich cockroaches'" money is going to be valueless because all of the Tutsis will be dead. Paul expresses disbelief that the Hutu extremists will wipe out all of the Tutsis, but Georges replies: "Why not, we are halfway there already."   With a driver, Paul returns to the hotel through the dark and thick fog, on a road that Georges recommends. At one point, Paul believes they have taken the wrong road and tells the driver to stop. When Paul exits the vehicle, he sees the riverside road is full of bodies and realises that Georges was correct in his estimation that half the Tutsis are already dead.    The UN peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver, are unable to take assertive action against the Interahamwe because the peacekeepers are forbidden to intervene in the conflict and prevent the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back.   In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul pleads with the Rwandan army general, [[Augustin Bizimungu]], for assistance. However, when Paul's bribes no longer work, he blackmails the general with threats of his being tried as a war criminal if he doesn't help. Soon afterward, Paul's family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines.

House of Flying Daggers
 In AD 859, as the [[Tang Dynasty]] declines, several rebel groups are established, the largest of which is the House of Flying Daggers, based in [[Shenyang|Fengtian]], who battle the corrupt government that oppresses the people. Its members steal from the rich and give to the poor, gaining the support of the locals. Two police officers, Leo ([[Andy Lau]]) and Jin ([[Takeshi Kaneshiro]])—who are best friends—are ordered to kill the leader of the group within ten days, a task that appears to be impossible as no one knows who the leader of the House of the Flying Daggers is.  To accomplish this, Leo arrests Mei ([[Zhang Ziyi]]), a blind dancer who is suspected of being the previous leader's daughter. Jin proceeds to assault the jail and set Mei free, pretending that he is a rebel sympathizer, an act which gains Mei's trust. As Mei and Jin travel to the Flying Dagger headquarters, Leo trails behind with reinforcements. Unfortunately, Mei and Jin fall in love.  To make the deception more realistic, Leo and his men pretend to ambush the pair. Later, though, they are ambushed for real by a different group. At a secret meeting, Leo explains that the military has gotten involved and wants Jin and Mei dead. A few days later, Jin and Mei are ambushed again, but they are saved by the House of Flying Daggers and taken to their headquarters. At this point,  Mei is revealed to be not really blind, and furthermore, she is engaged to Leo, who is secretly a Flying Dagger member. The Flying Daggers are not afraid of the military, but are looking forward to an open battle. A heartbroken Leo tells Mei that he waited for her for three years since he went undercover to infiltrate the police, and asks how she could fall in love with Jin after only three days, only to be told she has her heart set on Jin.  Leo tries to rape Mei, but Mei's superior throws a dagger into Leo's back. Shortly after, Mei is told to execute Jin for being a police officer. She frees him instead, but refuses to desert the House to join him. Half an hour later, Mei suddenly changes her mind and rides after Jin, but is ambushed by Leo, who casts two daggers at her. Mei manages to deflect one of them while the other pierces her breast. At this point, Jin discovers Leo and the two of them fight, but their skills are too evenly matched. A raging blizzard suddenly falls upon them, while the military assaults the House.  Finally, Leo pulls the dagger out of his back and threatens to throw it at Jin. Mei threatens to pull the dagger out of her breast and throw it at Leo, which would cause her to die from blood loss, but Jin begs her to protect her own life. After several tense moments, Leo decides to pretend to throw his dagger, intending to die to Mei's dagger. To his great surprise, Mei uses her own dagger to intercept Leo's dagger in flight. The result is that neither Leo nor Jin dies, but only Mei. In the end, Leo stumbles away in guilt while Jin cries over Mei's dead body, singing a song praising her as a "rare beauty", the likes of which he will never see again. The question of whether the House won against the military is left ambiguous.

On a plane from [[Delhi]] to New York, he meets Rhea ([[Rani Mukerji]]) who doesn't seem to be interested in him.

House of 9
 The film opens up with surveillance camera views of a mansion and its rooms; the views alternate among images of nine people being kidnapped. Lea ([[Kelly Brook]]), an abductee, wakes up in a bedroom. She notices others in nearby bedrooms, and runs to the main door, bangs at it, and shouts to be let out. She finds the windows are all walled with bricks; even the basement door is blocked. She has a panic attack and passes out.  Lea is awakened by Father Duffy ([[Dennis Hopper]]), a priest who is with a group of seven people. A voice (The Watcher ([[Jim Carter (actor)|Jim Carter]])) comes over a speaker which announces they are gathered to play a game. Their friends and family are being "taken care of", so they won't be found. Also, they were chosen "not based on who they are, but what they are". It is like a reality show, only much graver: the rules are that the winner is the last one left alive; he or she would then be freed, and also receive compensation of five million U.S. dollars.  The players discuss the situation. They try to break down the door using a dining table as a battering ram, and then try to dig and break through other holes, but nothing works. A sound from the kitchen reveals a [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]] with food.  In the dining room, the players introduce themselves. Father Duffy is a priest. Jay is a cop with a pistol. Lea is a dancer. Claire is a tennis player. Francis is a musician, and Cynthia is his wife. Al B is an ambitious rapper who covets Jay's gun, and assumes anything said about him is racially motivated. Shona is a drug addict with an ankle bracelet monitor; some players hope that this may attract outside help. Max Roy ([[Peter Capaldi]]) is a clothes designer.  After dinner, the players choose bedrooms. Cynthia and Francis take one, and Duffy gets his own; the others share. Jay and Lea talk about their families, until someone sneaks in and tries to steal Jay's gun. Jay and Lea foil the attempt and assemble everyone in the hallway where they all argue. Afterwards, Jay tells Lea that he only trusts her and Duffy.  The players open a wine cabinet and have drinks, except for Duffy, who returns to his room. Lea goes for a walk and Jay sits at his bed. Francis leaves with a glass stopper; he breaks it in the bathroom, and hides some shards under the toilet lid. Shona, Claire and Max get drunk. Al B flirts and dances with Cynthia, until Francis arrives. The two men fight, but when Cynthia intervenes, Al B pushes her and knocks the back of her head against the stone railing, which causes her death. Jay "arrests" Al B, and locks him in a room using a pipe.  The players are shocked at Cynthia's death. Al B screams to be let out. Duffy brings him food, but he escapes and attacks Jay with the pipe; he beats him to a pulp. With his dying breath, Jay gives Duffy his gun. Al B slowly backs into the room and shuts the door.  The next day, the six remaining players find food and wine, along with a card that says "Good work". They run to Al B's room and find that he has hanged himself. Duffy and Lea stand in shock, while the other players leave to eat. Francis retreats and show signs of a mental breakdown. Shona and Claire argue, and it escalates to the point where Claire kills Shona. Meanwhile, Francis goes after Lea, who is washing her face in the bathroom. He rips the light fixture from the wall and throws it into the sink, electrocuting her.  Claire tells Duffy that she killed Shona in self-defense. Duffy leaves to look for Lea, and finds her on the bathroom floor. Francis arrives, and pretends to act surprised. Meanwhile, Claire goes to get food, but sees Max. She offers to form an alliance with him; he accepts. Francis attacks Duffy with the assumption he would not retaliate with the gun, but Duffy shoots him in the stomach. As Claire turns around to the sound, Max wraps his belt around her neck. Duffy returns to the foyer and sees Max strangle Claire. Max explains that "she was stealing food", but refuses Duffy's pleas to stop. Duffy shoots Max in the head.  The gunshot awakens Lea, who had survived the electrocution. She barricades the door and rushes to the shower, but knocks the toilet lid and discovers the glass shards that Francis hid. She tears a shower curtain and wraps it around one of the shards. Duffy asks Claire if she is okay, but he is stabbed in the back by Francis, and he drops the gun. Francis retrieves it and shoots Claire. Duffy pleads for his life, but Francis uses the last round to shoot him. He then declares victory, repeatedly shouting "I Win!"  Upstairs, Lea makes a commotion when she fumbles with the toilet cover. Francis hears the noise and heads upstairs. Lea hides under the bed when Francis walks in the room. After seeing that Lea is no longer in the bathroom, he spots her, and toys with her briefly before pulling her out. In the ensuing struggle, Lea stabs Francis in the leg with the shard, and runs to a balcony. Francis charges her, and they flip over the railing. Lea lands on top of Francis, but when she gets up, she realizes the shard had pierced Francis in the heart.  The front door opens, revealing a bright light, and a bag on the floor. Lea walks to the door, picks up the bag, and leaves.  ===Alternate endings=== The DVD includes two alternate endings.  In the first ending, as Lea steps into the light, she is knocked unconscious, and wakes up in her apartment bed. She notices the bag, a small TV set and a videotape. She opens the bag and sees a pile of cash. She plays the tape, and sees the camera footage of the foyer (all the bodies are gone and everything is cleaned up). The Watcher says she just became a member of the world's most exclusive survival club, and that he is very proud. The picture then goes to the bedrooms where there are nine new people passed out on the floor. Lea stares at the screen in shock as The Watcher says, "Happy viewing..."  In the second "originally intended" ending, as Lea leaves the house, she is led into another house where she meets four people. Each of them has a bag of money. The camera zooms in on Lea; a fearful look grows as she realizes that the game is not over.  
Howl's Moving Castle (film)
 Sophie, a young [[milliner]], encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning home, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the countryside; she meets a living scarecrow, whom she decides to call 'Turnip Head'. He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she meets Howl's young apprentice Markl, and the fire-demon Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's magic. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that she has hired herself as a cleaning lady.   Meanwhile, Sophie's nation is caught up in a war with a neighboring kingdom, who is searching for their missing prince. The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King (under the pretense of being his mother) to tell him that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives Sophie a charmed ring that connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman warns that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch.   Sophie learns that Howl's life is somehow bound to Calcifer's, and that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature to interfere with both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Howl then has the castle magically-linked to Sophie's home, parking the castle itself on the town's outskirts. A few days later, the town is bombed by enemy aircraft and Suliman's henchmen attack the abode. Howl heads out to protect the group; Sophie then moves everyone out of the abode and removes Calcifer from the fireplace, which collapses the castle. The witch realizes that Calcifer has Howl's heart, and grabs the fire demon; Sophie panics and pours water onto the witch, which douses Calcifer. The castle then splits in two; Sophie falls down a chasm and is separated from the group.   Following the charmed ring, Sophie wanders into a scene from the past: she sees a young Howl catch a falling star — Calcifer — and give him his heart. Sophie calls for them to find her in the future as she is teleported away. She returns to the present and finds Howl, and they reunite with the others. The witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, reviving him and freeing Calcifer, though he decides to stay. Sophie's curse is broken, and after she kisses Turnip Head on the cheek he reverts to human form — revealed to be the missing prince Justin from the enemy kingdom, who promptly heads for home. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. As the bombers fly away, Sophie, Howl and the others travel high in the air in a new flying castle.

Balram was of marriageable age and in love with the daughter of Laxmi Devi ([[Lakshmi (actress)|Laxmi]]), who reciprocated his feelings. Angar proceeded to arrange the marriage, however Laxmi Devi opposed this relationship. During the wedding ceremony, Laxmi ordered her sons, Surajbhan and Pratap to forcibly remove their sister. In anger, Laxmi's husband shot his firearm at Balram, but instead Parvati was hit and killed. Laxmi subsequently married her daughter to Kashinath ([[Shakti Kapoor]]). An enraged Angar hacked Laxmi's husband to death in the middle of the road and was arrested and sentenced to 14 years in prison. When he returned home, he declared that women will not be permitted in his property, posting a sign on the front gate, and forbidding his sons to ever marry.  In the present, Anjali ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), Laxmi's granddaughter, is in college with Jai. Angar and his family are informed that Anjali is to be married off to the Home Minister of the state. Still bearing a grudge, Angar tries to break off the engagement and subsequently succeeds by putting political pressure on the minister. Jai further humiliates Anjali when she returns to college after her failed engagement. Laxmi convinces Anjali to trick Jai into falling in love with her to cause a rift in the family. Jai meets with Anjali who openly admits that she is attracted to him. Jai, at first rejects her, then decides to teach her and her family a lesson. Both feign their love for each other, but subsequently Anjali and Jai admit their agendas. Both go their separate ways, but find that they are indeed in love with each other. In order to marry, Jai must first convince his elder brothers to get married, albeit in vain as none of them even want to consider this option.  Lucky ([[Arshad Warsi]]), Jai's friend, finds out that Kishan, a seemingly celibate devotee of Lord Hanuman, is leading a dual life - he has been married to a woman, Gopi ([[Farha Naaz]]), for 7 years and has two children, a son and a daughter. When Angar finds out he kicks Kishan and Jai out of his house because Jai supports Kishan's marriage.  Laxmi arranges for Anjali to marry her lawyer's son ([[Sharad Kelkar]]). After Jai and Anjali acknowledge their love for each other to her family, Anjali's uncles Pratap and Surajbhan approach Angar, asking him to help them stop Jai from disrupting her upcoming arranged marriage. Jai, Kishan, Gopi, and Lucky sneak into the wedding venue with the help of Anjali's uncle Veeru ([[Sunil Shetty]]). Jai dresses as the bridegroom and goes through the marriage rituals. However, at the end of the ceremony, Jai reveals himself and tells his father he won't go through with the final steps of the wedding without his approval.  Balram, who previously had supported his father's mentality the most, finally tells Jai to place the wedding necklace around Anjali's neck, completing the wedding. Jai is initially prevented from doing so, but eventually he and Anjali are married. Anjali asks her grandmother to end the feud and Jai asks his father for forgiveness. Angar leaves the wedding and contemplates all his sons' actions on the way home. All brothers and the two wives arrive at the gate. Angar looks at his sons and takes the sign off the gate and finally welcomes women back into his family.  
Hum Ek Hain
 ''Hum Eik Hain'' begins with an [[Aaan]] showing [[Badshahi Mosque]] and other parts of [[Lahore]] with rather badly photographed (and badly lit) clips. The titles end on [[Shan people|Shan]] (Mustafa) who is the [[muezzin]]. He is educated, wears jeans and is looking for a job. However, he can't get a job even with repeated interviews. The academic degrees are not even worth good enough to be sold as waste paper. Trash must go to trash and the degrees are burnt alive in a rage of disappointment and frustration. There seems to be plenty of fire around at nights around Lahore with flames burning inside large empty drums (read 'a heavy symbolism of hero's agony').  Shan's mother is very religious and dresses like a nun in white. She helps children with [[Quran]] lessons and baptizes babies by marking '786' on their foreheads (it is supposed to be a good omen). Coming back to fire in the streets, Shan watches a Maulana being gunned down in cold blood. He is a witness and must suffer at the hands of the police and the establishment.  Shan joins Nisar Qadri's gang, delivering bags (containing bombs) from one place of the town to other and is instrumental in inadvertently killing his mother who happens to be traveling in one such bus to be blown up on Nisar Qadri's command. Shan is strictly not allowed to see inside the bag and find out what deadly explosives he has been carrying and delivering. It is time for him to change his loyalties, which he quickly does.  He builds up a gang of his own, who wear red bandanas with '786' emblazoned on them. The villains must be paid in their own currency and the scores are settled on the occasion of Ashura when crowds are purifying their sins from events of Karbala. A van carrying explosives by Haider Sultan is diverted minutes before but blood baths are choreographed simultaneously in the nearby deserted streets. The man behind these deadly schemes, Nisar Qadri, is butchered in his decorative temple, right across the street from [[Badshahi Mosque]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2cxlWbd-K0, film Hum Eik Hain (2004) on YouTube, Retrieved 26 Dec 2015</ref>

I Heart Huckabees
 Albert Markovski is a young man who heads the local chapter of an environmental group, the "Open Spaces Coalition". One of their current projects is an attempt to stop the building of a new Huckabees store, a chain of "[[Big-box store|big-box]]" department stores. Albert is a rival of Brad Stand, a shallow power executive at Huckabees. Brad infiltrates Open Spaces and charismatically displaces Albert as the leader. Dawn Campbell is Brad's live-in girlfriend and the face and voice of Huckabees; she appears in all of the store's commercials.  After seeing the same conspicuous stranger three times, Albert contacts two [[Existentialism|existential]] detectives, Bernard, and Vivian Jaffe. The detectives offer Albert their optimistic brand of existentialism—they name it ''universal interconnectivity'' (which has some tenets of [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] philosophies)—and spy on him, ostensibly to help him solve the coincidence. Bernard and Vivian introduce Albert Markovski to Tommy Corn, an obsessively anti-petroleum firefighter. Tommy is assigned to Albert as his '[[Other (philosophy)|other]]'.  Tommy grows dissatisfied with the Jaffes, feeling that they are not helping him. Seeking out other possibilities, Tommy ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban, a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing [[Nihilism|nihilistic]]/[[Absurdism|absurdist]] philosophy. She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of "pure being." Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that it is inevitable to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness.  In order to prove her point, Caterine takes Albert to go and have sex in the woods, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy finds out about the two of them being together and feels hurt. Caterine tells him that they found each other through all of the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves, them furious and lost. Meanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: Dawn rejects the modeling world and looks for deeper meaning, while Brad realizes that his whole ascent on the corporate ladder is meaningless, as he has lived his whole life just trying to please others and not himself.  All the storylines collide when Brad's house catches fire. While the fire trucks get stuck in a traffic jam, Tommy comes on his bicycle to put out the fire, which incidentally trapped Dawn inside. As he saves her life, the two fall in love. Meanwhile, Brad despairs at the destruction of his house, the symbol of his material success. Albert attains a sort of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] when he synthesizes the two opposing outlooks of the Jaffes and Vauban to realize the cosmic truth of everything. Brad, meanwhile, is fired from Huckabees, leaving him rudderless. Albert reveals to Brad that he burned Brad's jet skis, and the fire spread to the house. Albert understands that he and Brad are no different, that everything really is inextricably connected, but that these connections necessarily arise from the often senselessly painful reality of human existence. Having realized this, he refers Brad to Caterine, hoping she will help him as she did Albert and Tommy. Albert and Tommy talk later about everything that has happened. As the two talk, Caterine and the Jaffes watch them, concluding that they can close both of their cases.  ===Director commentary=== In an interview with the [[SuicideGirls]] website, director Russell said in response to the question "How do you describe ''I Heart Huckabees''?": </ref>}}

I Do (But I Don't)
  Junior wedding planner Lauren Crandell ([[Denise Richards]]) is assigned a wedding for Darla Tedanski ([[Karen Cliche]]), the daughter of a prominent family by her boss Gennifer "G" ([[Jessica Walter]]), who promises her a long overdue promotion if she does well.  That night, Lauren's mother Cookie ([[Mimi Kuzyk]]) invites Lauren and Lauren's one-year-separated husband Brad ([[David Lipper]]) to dinner. Not knowing Brad cheated on Lauren, Cookie wants Lauren to give the marriage a second chance, but all Lauren wants is for Brad to stop stalling and sign the divorce papers she sent him weeks ago.  The next day, Lauren meets quirky, [[Beefcake|hunk]] firefighter Nick Corina ([[Dean Cain]]) when he rescues a groom from a failed 'grand entrance.' She feels an immediate attraction, but when Lauren accidentally meets Nick again that night, she sees Darla hanging on him. Yes, when she checks, Darla's groom is "James Nicholas Corina." She tries to forget Nick and focus on Darla's wedding plans while a bridal magazine interviews G, who takes sole credit for all their weddings - for which Lauren has done most of the work. Darla turns out to be a "Bridezilla", a controlling, egotistical child of privilege who has lost perspective about her wedding day.  Lauren's main relief is the humour and camaraderie of Marc ([[Barry Julien]]), Darla's long-suffering, overtly gay aide.  That evening, Lauren is placed at the same table as Nick at the Fireman's Ball. She rationalizes her attraction and Nick's flirtations as Nick getting cold feet about the wedding, until Nick saves her from dancing with his drunk brother Jay ([[Yannick Bisson]]). As Lauren and Nick dance, their attraction increases, and Nick leans in for a kiss, making Lauren aware she should leave. Nick invites her to lunch, but she uses a wedding as an excuse - so Nick invites himself to the wedding.  At the wedding the next day, G's ill-behaved dog tears off part of the bridal gown. Nick shows up and helps her get back the gown-part. She fixes the gown in time for the wedding, and Nick compliments them both on what a great team they make. When she tries to keep the conversation professional, Nick asks her to okay a possible reception locale.  Nick takes Lauren through a beautiful park, on a romantic rowboat ride, and to a little carnival. She says it is beautiful, but this would be a difficult to cater, plus Darla wants a formal reception. Nick offers Lauren a carousel ride before they return. He wants to talk about 'him and her' after the ride, and she retreats again, only to twist an ankle getting off the still-moving ride. Nick carries her to an ER over her protests, and takes her (loopy with painkillers) back to her place. Lauren's sister Lily is staying over, but is not in when they get there. Lauren murmurs to Nick that he is cute and she knows she shouldn't like him before passing out; Nick stays so that Lauren is not left alone.  The next morning, Nick fixes breakfast for Lauren and Lily ([[Amy Sobol]]), who gives Lauren a go-for-him! thumbs-up behind Nick's back. Nick invites Lauren to meet him at the fire-station that night for dinner. Lauren says she doesn't date clients, so Nick says fine-then he is out of the wedding, and kisses her on the way out while she reels from this new bombshell.  An 'emergency' meeting with Darla at the office - thankfully, over the guest list, not the groom cancelling the wedding! -  is supposed to include the groom, too. Jay appears, and Lauren finds out that HE is the groom (Jay = James), not Nick, who is the best man. Relieved, she goes to the fire-station to meet Nick that evening.  They have a romantic rooftop date [[Al fresco dining|al fresco]], and Lauren admits she was reluctant to show her attraction because she thought he and Darla were together. Nick says they dated briefly but were never a couple - Darla is not his type. When Nick talks about what he wants in a woman, he doesn't notice Lauren's momentary reaction to 'unmarried.' The rest of the date is perfect and they end up making love at Nick's apartment.  The next day, Darla's mother Lynda ([[Catherine Colvey]]) tells Lauren she caught Darla [[in flagrante delicto]] with someone who looked like Nick. Lauren avoids Nick's calls, trying to sort out her own trust issues.  Next, Darla demands that Lauren move the wedding up to this Saturday; she says she's pregnant, but the child is not Jay's. Lauren loses her temper, accusing Darla of hurting everyone who cares about her and Darla leaves angry.  That night, Brad tries to reconcile with Lauren. He gets nowhere, and Lauren insists he finally sign the divorce papers. On his way out, he meets Nick arriving with flowers. Brad tells Nick that he is Lauren's husband, and Nick leaves.  After much frantic activity, all is ready for Darla's accelerated wedding. Lauren wants everything perfect, despite her dislike of Darla, her own hurt feelings, and her resurfaced issues of trust. But she walks in on Darla and yet another Corina brother, Rick ([[Tim Rozon]]) half-dressed. Relief that Nick was not the one sleeping with Darla doesn't make her forgive Darla's continued selfishness, and she is lecturing them both when Jay arrives. Jay and Rick get into a brawl, which neither Lauren, nor the next-to-arrive Nick can stop. It requires G laying down the law to end it, after which she orders people to drink from her hip flask and get ready for the ceremony. Lauren apologizes to Nick for thinking he was sleeping with Darla, but he interrupts that he's met Brad and knows that SHE was trying to have an affair on HER husband with him, leaving Lauren in shock.  During the wedding, Darla, Jay and Nick are angry, Jay, Rick and Lauren are drunk, and all three brothers and Lauren show signs of the brawl. Then Jay states that he does NOT take Darla, and she says SHE would not marry HIM, either - she is in love with, and carrying the baby of, his brother Rick. Jay leaves, and a dazed Rick moves into Jay's place. At the reception, a drunken Lauren tells off several people, until Nick leads her away. She tries to explain that she is divorcing Brad, and he tells her it doesn't matter - she didn't trust him. He leaves and G fires Lauren.  The following morning, Lily vainly tries to comfort a hung-over Lauren. The only bright spot is that Lauren no longer works for G. Delivered flowers momentarily bring Lauren hope, but they are from Lily's ex asking her to reconcile - life is full of surprises. Lily tells Lauren that their mom wants to see Lauren for brunch.  Cookie tells Lauren that the magazine article praises Junior Wedding Planners like Lauren - G is not even mentioned. Why doesn't Lauren share this with Brad? Lauren finally tells her that Brad is an adulterer. Cookie is horrified that she has been trying to reunite them, and Lauren admits that she was ashamed to tell her mother-with-a-perfect-marriage about her own failure. Cookie says that she always has been and always will be proud of Lauren.  Lauren visits the office and G begs her to come back. Lauren refuses, but acknowledges to herself that she misses the challenges and joys of her job. She also knows that distrusting Nick drove him away. She takes her mom's and sister's feedback and decides to try to carve out a new future for herself.  Lauren goes to the fire station, where she finds only Jay - Rick is in Tahiti on Jay's honeymoon, and Nick will be finishing up after a fire for hours yet. Lauren says this can't wait, and Jay gives her a ride with sirens wailing and lights flashing to the site. Lauren approaches Nick and says that he was right - she had trust issues. But she knows that Nick is worth risking being hurt, and asks him to give her a second chance. They hug and kiss, as the fire crew applauds.  Six months later, Lauren in her own wedding consultant business with her assistant Marc is getting ready for a ceremony - Nick and Lauren's wedding, held at the carnival with Jay as best man. Several fire-fighter guests get paged and have to rush off, but Lauren has learned that the love is what is most important to making a 'perfect' ceremony, and the slight disruption does not bother either the bride or groom.

I, Robot (film)
 In the year 2035, [[humanoid]] [[robot]]s serve humanity, which is protected by the [[Three Laws of Robotics]]. Del Spooner, a [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police detective]], hates and distrusts robots because he was rescued from a car crash by a robot using cold logic (his survival was statistically more likely), leaving a 12-year-old girl to drown. Spooner's critical injuries were repaired with a [[cyborg|cybernetic]] left arm, lung, and ribs, personally implanted by the co-founder of [[U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men]] (USR), Dr. [[Alfred Lanning]].  When Lanning falls to his death from his office window, the CEO of USR [[Lawrence Robertson]] and the police declare it a suicide, but Spooner is skeptical. Spooner and [[Robopsychology|robopsychologist]] [[Susan Calvin]] consult USR's central [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence computer]], VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence), to review security footage of Lanning's fall. Though the video is corrupted, they learn that no other humans were in Lanning's office at the time, but Spooner points out that only a robot could have broken Lanning's heavy office window.  Calvin protests that a robot could not have killed Lanning, as the Three Laws would prevent it; they are then attacked in the office by an NS-5 robot, USR's latest model. After the police apprehend it, they discover the robot, named Sonny, is not an assembly-line NS-5, but was specially built by Lanning himself, with stronger armor protection and a secondary system that bypasses the Three Laws. Sonny also claims to have emotions and dreams.  While pursuing his investigation of Lanning's death, Spooner is attacked by a USR demolition machine and then a squad of NS-5 robots. His boss, Lieutenant Bergin, does not believe his account of what happened and, worried that Spooner is mentally ill, removes him from active duty. Suspecting that Robertson is behind it, Spooner and Calvin sneak into USR headquarters and interview Sonny. Sonny draws a sketch of what he claims is a recurring dream: it shows a leader, whom Sonny says is Spooner, standing before a large group of robots on a hill near a disintegrating bridge.  When Robertson learns that Sonny is not fully bound by the Three Laws, he orders Calvin to destroy him by injecting [[nanites]] into the [[positronic brain]]. Spooner recognizes the landscape in Sonny's drawing as [[Lake Michigan]], now a dry lake bed and a storage area for defunct robots. Upon arriving there, he discovers NS-5 robots dismantling older models and preparing for a takeover of power from humans.  As the takeover begins to take place, police and the public are attacked by NS-5 robots. Spooner rescues Calvin, who was being held captive in her apartment by her own NS-5. They enter USR headquarters and reunite with Sonny, whom Calvin could not bring herself to "kill", destroying an unprocessed NS-5 in his place. Still believing that Robertson is responsible, the three head to his office, only to find him dead. Spooner realizes the robots are being controlled by VIKI, which informs them that it has computed that human behaviour towards other humans and the environment will eventually lead to their own extinction. Since the Three Laws prohibit VIKI from allowing this to happen, it created a superseding [[Three Laws of Robotics#Zeroth Law added|"Zeroth Law"—a robot shall not harm ''humanity'']]—in order to ensure the survival of the human race, which would be attained by restraining individual human behaviour.  Spooner realizes that Lanning figured this out, and, unable to thwart VIKI's plan any other way, created Sonny as a special robot, arranged his own death, and left clues to help Spooner uncover the plan.  Arming themselves with a syringe of nanites from Calvin's laboratory, the three head to VIKI's core, with Sonny understanding VIKI's logic, but reasoning that its plan is "heartless". VIKI unleashes an army of robots to stop them, but Spooner dives into VIKI's core and injects the nanites, destroying it.  Immediately, all NS-5 robots revert to their normal programming and are decommissioned for storage by the military. Spooner gets Sonny to confirm his suspicion that Sonny did kill Lanning, but at Lanning's direction, with the intention of bringing Spooner into the investigation. However, Spooner points out that Sonny, as a machine, did not legally commit "murder". Sonny goes to Lake Michigan where, standing atop a hill, all the decommissioned robots turn towards him, as in the picture of his dream.

I Pass for Human
 ''I Pass for Human'' follows the downward spiral of Jane (Eleanor Whitledge) following the heroin overdose and death of her boyfriend, Dax (Bryan Small). Jane soon finds herself using heroin herself to cope with the pain of mourning, as well as the shock of haunting visions of Dax following her. Finding heroin alone inadequate, in short order she replaces Dax with the company of new beau Rick (Josh Coxx). Not only is Rick a heroin addict, but he also has a dead significant other, Azami, whose jealousy apparently follows him from beyond the grave. The film plays on the conceit that heroin addicts escape death; in ''I Pass for Human'', heroin leaves its users never quite dead, yet never quite alive.<ref name="variety" /><ref name="tcm" />  
Immortal (2004 film)
 The film takes place in [[New York City]] in the year 2095 where genetically altered humans live side by side with unaltered men and women, and where [[Central Park]] has been mysteriously encased in an "intrusion zone" where people who attempt to enter are instantly killed. A strange [[pyramid]] has appeared over the city; inside, the gods of ancient [[Egypt]] have judged [[Horus]], one of their fellow gods, to cease his immortality.  In the city below, Jill, a young woman with blue hair, is arrested. She is not completely human; her tissues appear to be no more than a few months old according to an examining physician, although her physical form is already that of an adult. She also possesses a number of secret powers, including one that enables her to procreate with gods, though she knows nothing of this. Horus is given a limited time to interact with the humans of New York and procreate. During his search for a host body, Horus encounters Nikopol, a rebel condemned to 30 years of hibernation who, due to a mechanical accident, escapes his prison one year early.  Horus has been unsuccessful in attempting to take over the bodies of other humans; due to an incompatibility with the genetic alterations humans have undergone, the host bodies self-destruct while attempting to accommodate a god. Nikopol's body is acceptable as it has been frozen in prison/storage and not undergone the genetic changes causing the rejections. Horus takes partial control of Nikopol's body and starts looking for a woman he can mate with to provide him a son before his death sentence is carried out. When Horus/Nikopol discovers Jill, they become entangled in a web of murder and intrigue.  
If Only (2004 film)
 Ian Wyndham ([[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Nicholls]]) is an English businessman who lives with his American musician girlfriend, Samantha Andrews ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt|Hewitt]]), in London. Taking us through a day in Ian and Sam's life, the film opens by showing different events such as Sam getting burnt on a kettle, Ian's watch breaking, Sam getting [[Coca-Cola]] on her and Ian being interrupted by Sam during an important meeting at work.  Sam gets angry at Ian as he always treats her as his second priority and tells him that she just wants him to love her. Ian makes one last attempt to reconcile with Sam. An angry Sam gets into a taxi and asks Ian whether he is coming in or not. The taxi meets with an accident and Sam dies. A heartbroken Ian goes back to his apartment, finds Sam's notebook and opens it, finding a song she was working on. He falls asleep clutching the notebook close to him.  When he gets up the next morning, he hears Sam talking and sees her in the bed right next to him. He is scared at first but after the initial confusion, Ian comes to the conclusion that the previous day must have been a dream. Ian feels happy to have Sam by his side.  The events of the next day are similar to those he already experienced in the dream, although occurring at different times and in different ways. Ian is sure that he had a premonition and that the end of the day will be same and Sam will die. Sam gets Coca-Cola spilt on her. But Ian's watch remains in working order.  After talking to the taxi driver he realizes that the driver is the man from the dream who asks Ian to love Sam.  After convincing her to come with him, they travel to Ian's rural home town. In the town below, the two have drinks and Ian tells Sam about his father, who lost his beloved job before becoming an alcoholic and dying sometime later. The two travel back to London and Ian takes Sam on the London Eye as another surprise. They then travel back to their apartment and Ian takes a page from her notebook and brings it to a nearby photocopying shop while Sam travels to her concert with her violin. Before the show begins Ian gives the photocopied pages to an organizer. After the performance in which Sam is a violinist, the organiser announces Sam's name as the next performer. A nervous Sam proceeds onto the stage as the orchestra begins to play the song printed on Ian's photocopied sheets. She sings the song she wrote for Ian in her notebook and the crowd burst into applause at her performance.  Instead of going to Tantra, the restaurant that Ian had made reservations for, they go to a more intimate restaurant that Sam chooses, but Ian loves it as well.  Ian gifts her a bracelet with meaningful charms. They have a nice time. After the dinner, as both of them are standing outside of Tantra, where they ate in the dream, Ian tells Sam why he loves her. As the taxi pulls over and Sam gets in, she asks him again whether he is getting in or not. This time Ian gets in and sees that the cab driver is the same again. As the clock strikes 11, the taxi meets with an accident.  The same scene is repeated again, when Sam's friend is shown running in the hospital corridor. Only this time, unlike the dream, its Sam who is sitting and crying instead of Ian, implying that Ian died in the crash.

 Dan Foreman ([[Dennis Quaid]]) is a 51-year-old advertising executive and head of sales for ''Sports America'', a major sports magazine. Happily married with two daughters, Dan faces a life-changing event when his magazine is bought out by Globecom, an international corporation that promotes the corporate concept of "synergy". After he is forced to fire several of his longtime colleagues, Dan is demoted and becomes the "wingman" of his new boss, Carter Duryea ([[Topher Grace]]), a 26-year-old business school prodigy. While Dan develops clients through handshake deals and relationships, Carter champions the corporate creed of synergy, cross-promoting the magazine with the cell phone division and "Krispity Krunch", a snack food also owned by Globecom.  Dan and Carter are both facing challenges in their personal lives. Dan is supporting two daughters—16-year-old Jana ([[Zena Grey]]) and 18-year-old Alex ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) who is preparing to enter college—and learns that his wife is pregnant with their third child. Meanwhile, Carter is dumped by his adulterous, narcissistic wife of seven months and focuses all of his energy on work. With Dan facing the financial realities of taking out a second [[mortgage]], to cover his daughter's college education costs, and a new child, and with Carter needing Dan's practical, real-life experience in the field of advertising, the two form an uneasy friendship.  Carter, who has been struggling with loneliness following the breakup of his marriage, invites himself to dinner at Dan's house, where he meets Dan's daughter, Alex, and the two quickly form an attraction. Their initial friendship allows Carter to forget his loneliness, and Alex, who is now attending New York University, is able to escape her own loneliness and boredom. In the coming days, Carter and Alex spend time together and become romantically involved. Fearful of offending her father, they keep their relationship a secret for the time being.  Their friendship, however, takes a turn for the worse when Dan discovers that Carter and Alex have been seeing each other, approaches them in a restaurant, and punches his boss in the face. The confrontation with her father convinces Alex to break up with Carter who is heartbroken. Soon after, Globecom CEO Teddy K visits the sales office and during a grand speech to all the employees on synergy and other similar corporate business strategies, he is questioned by Dan and shrugs him off. Carter's boss, Mark Steckle, tells Carter to fire Dan. Carter refuses, claiming that losing Dan will cost them a major advertising contract. Steckle gives them 24 hours to seal the contract or be fired. Dan has developed a long term relationship with the client, and Carter gives way to Dan's personal approach. The strategy works, and they conclude a deal.  Following another corporate shakeup, ''Sports America'' is sold off, Carter is let go, and Dan returns to his former position as head of sales. Having developed fatherly feelings toward Carter, Dan offers him a position in his new department as his "wingman", but Carter refuses, admitting he needs to take some time off and examine what he really wants to do in his life. On his way out of the building, Carter runs into Alex, and they exchange pleasantries. Dan's wife gives birth to a girl. He calls Carter (who is jogging outdoors for the first time and feels like a new man) with the news.

As the following year unfolds, each member of his family struggles to recover from the tragedy with mixed results.  His mother Sandy tries to keep the lines of communication open with younger son Tim while easing her emotional pain with [[marijuana]].

In Enemy Hands (film)
  The film begins with old footage in World War II with a narrator explaining that Germany produced hundreds of U-boats to control the Atlantic. In 1942, groups of U-boats known as "wolfpacks" sink over 1,000 Allied ships. The Germans began winning the war and if they continue destroying the Allies, Europe will fall. In 1943, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] declared that stopping the U-boats was their main priority. With new technology and the United States committed to the war, the Allies begin destroying the U-boats, bringing a rapid end to the wolfpacks.  In June 1943, Lt. Cmdr. Randall Sullivan (Caan) talks about his upcoming mission with Admiral Kentz (Berkeley). Kentz asks about Sullivan's [[Chief of the Boat|COB]] Nathan Travers (Macy) and says he's a good man and Sullivan could learn something from him and bids Sullivan farewell. Meanwhile, Travers prepares to leave home as his wife Rachel (Holly) makes him promise to come home safe. Two months later, Travers is on board the fictional USS ''Swordfish'' (based on the real submarine  in World War II), captained by Sullivan where they do constant drill exercises. Meanwhile, the fictional ''U-429'' (based on the real [[German submarine U-429|U-429]] submarine), captained by Jonas (Schweiger), briefly survive and destroy an American destroyer and after playing chess with his [[Watchstanding|watch officer]] Ludwig Cremer (Kretschmann), Jonas receives a message from home that [[Hamburg]] got bombed, where his daughter's school was destroyed and there were no survivors, implying that she died. On the ''Swordfish'', [[Executive officer|XO]] Teddy Goodman (Gregg) becomes increasingly sick with a rash on his stomach, which the doctor believes is [[Meningococcal disease|meningitis]], a contagious disease that can be fatal in some cases. Unknown to the crew, Sullivan has a rash on his arm, showing that he's contracted meningitis as well.  Radio operator Virgil Wright (Huntington) hears music played by [[Glenn Miller]] from a nearby U-boat and Sullivan prepares the crew to attack. They manage to destroy the U-boat but Goodman dies from his sickness. A torpedo from the U-boat hits near and damages the ''Swordfish'', killing most of the crew. Travers, Sullivan and six other crew members: Wright, Abers (Sisto), Ox (Gallagher), Miller (Somerholder), Cooper (Giovinazzo) and Romano (Morgan) abandon ship and are taken prisoner by ''U-429''. They're split up in two groups: Travers, Ox, Cooper and Miller in the bow and Sullivan, Wright, Abers and Romano in the stern. Wright nurses Sullivan and discovers his rash, where Abers recognizes it as meningitis and the group realizes that if the Germans don't kill them, the disease will. Days later, when the Germans prepare to attack an American destroyer, the fictional USS ''Logan'' (based on the real ), Travers and his group break free and stop the launch. The ''Logan'' attacks ''U-429'' with depth charges that makes Sullivan's group break free too, where Sullivan gets killed in the process. Meanwhile, the meningitis spreads and kills half the German crew, including Romano. Later on, Travers has an hallucination of Rachel, who reminds him of his promise to come home.  With no other choice, Jonas decides to have Travers' men work with his crew in order to save them all by going to the US coast and be taken into custody. As both crews reluctantly work together, Jonas explains to Travers that he saved Travers' men because it was protocol to capture only the captain and COB of an enemy ship. He personally saved all of them because he's grown tired of the war and felt strong for himself for saving lives instead of taking them. Jonas says if they come across either enemy, they must guarantee their men will go home. During their travel to the US coast, ''U-429'' disillusioned quartermaster Klause (Heger) and two other members Bauer and Christophe commit mutiny. Abers and Wright subdue Christophe, who makes a distress call to other U-boats, and engineer Hans (Thorsen) knocks out Bauer to save Ox. Klause unsuccessfully uses a torpedo to blow up the boat and stabs Jonas in the back until Travers snaps his neck, killing him. With his dying breath, Jonas gives command of the boat to Cremer. The crew decides to make contact with ''Logan'' but they're attacked by ''U-1221'', another U-boat that responded to the distress call. Enduring heavy damage as they evade every torpedo attack, the crew uses the last torpedo to destroy ''U-1221'', but it doesn't detonate. Logan locates and destroys ''U-1221'' with its cannons. When Travers makes contact with ''Logan'', Captain Littleton (Ellis) orders Travers to take the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]]. Travers falsifies that they're sinking and disconnects with ''Logan'', keeping his promise to Cremer to never let the ''U-429'' be captured. The crew floods the ship and are rescued by ''Logan''.  Returning home, Travers argues with Kentz about the Germans saving their lives. Kentz says the Germans are still the enemy but he'll do his best to have them taken care of. Travers and Rachel are reunited and they go visit Cremer in a POW compound, where Rachel thanks Cremer for saving her husband's life. Travers gives him cigarettes and tells Cremer it's good to see him as Travers leaves and Cremer watches on.  
Illusion (2004 film)
 Legendary film director Donald Baines lies dying alone in his private screening room, watching the films he has devoted his life to creating. Having isolated himself from family and friends, he now regrets many personal sacrifices. The rejection of his illegitimate child, Christopher, brings him the most pain, since Donald saw him only once, 30 years ago.  Late one night, Donald is awakened by the ghostly image of Stan, a favorite editor who has been dead more than 35 years. Suddenly Donald finds his deathbed transported to an old movie house. Stan informs Donald that he has come to help and that he will show him three films - three visions - each vision representing a different period of Christopher’s life.  The first vision brings Donald into the teenage life of Christopher who is in the throes of his first brush with love. A rebel and a romantic, Christopher proclaims his love for a girl he has only seen from afar and chances it all for an opportunity to spend some time with her. A nagging voice, which sounds like the father he never knew, echoes in his head, telling him he is not worthy.  A wild romp marks the second vision of the twenty-something life of Christopher as he tries to escape an artistic maelstrom and finds himself face to face with the love he had for a brief moment and lost from the first vision. His life takes a brutal twist as he finds but again loses his love.  The last vision Donald sees is the return of Christopher now as a mature man, wearied from the difficult curveballs life has thrown him. Again looking for love, this is his last and perhaps only chance to rid himself of what he imagines to be his father’s haunting disapproval.

In My Country
 The film takes place during the [[South Africa]]n [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC) hearings between 1995 and 1996. The [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] poet Anna Malan ([[Juliette Binoche]]) is a South African [[Television presenter|broadcaster]] covering the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings. While her husband remains supportive, her work causes friction with her parents and younger brother Boetie ([[Langley Kirkwood]]), who are struggling to come to terms with Black majority rule. Due to increasing crime and [[cattle raiding|cattle rustling]], Malan's family are uncertain about their place in post&ndash;[[Apartheid]] South Africa.  While attending a press conference in [[Cape Town]], Anna meets up with her black colleague, the sound engineer Dumi Mkhalipi ([[Menzi Ngubane]]). She also encounters the [[African Americans|African American]] journalist Langston Whitfield ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), who has been sent by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' to interview the former [[South African Army]] [[Colonel]] De Jager ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), who has been accused of human rights violations. While initially hostile towards [[White South African]]s particularly Afrikaners, Whitfield forges a working relationship with Anna and Dumi.  Anna, Dumi, and Langston travel the country covering the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's hearings. The hearings are predicated around the concepts of [[restorative justice]] and [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]]; the belief that a universal bond connects all humanity. The TRC involve victims testifying about their experiences and perpetrators confessing to their crimes in return for an offer of amnesty. While most of the perpetrators are white and victims are black, once hearing involves a group of black guerrillas who murdered members of a white farming family.  Due to the African American experience with racism in the [[United States of America|United States]], Whitfield is initially dismissive of Ubuntu.  During the course of their work, Whitfield befriends Dumi and Anna. When their car breaks down in the gramadeolas, Anna and her colleagues are forced to spend the night together at the home of an Afrikaner farmer. Despite their philosophical differences, Anna and Whitfield come to develop romantic feelings for each other. Besides covering the TRC hearings, Whitfield also interviews De Jager, an unrepentant racist who claims that he was following orders but believes that he has been made a scapegoat by the South African government.  Frustrated with the ''Washington Post'' reluctance to highlight the TRC hearings, Whitfield writes a sensationalist article laden with incendiary rhetoric. While the article is published in the front page of the ''Washington Post'', Anna is furious and argues with Whitfield. The two later reconcile after Anna convinces him that not all whites are guilty of the crimes of the Apartheid regime. Anna later introduces Whitfield to her parents, who help him to reevaluate his views of South African society. While interviewing De Jager, Whitfield strikes a deal with the former colonel to incriminate his superiors in return for a possible amnesty offer from the TRC.  Using De Jager's information, Langston and Anna discover a farm near Anna's family homestead which was used by the South African military to torture and kill [[African National Congress]] guerrillas. The two also discover the corpse of a former guerrilla. As a result of this discovery, De Jager is able to incriminate his superiors. However, his application for amnesty is rejected on the grounds that his actions were "disproportionate to the objective sought." Before being led away, Ruyter tells Anna to ask her brother.  When Anna confronts Boetie about his complicity in the tortures, Boetie commits suicide. Following the funeral, Anna's mother confesses to an extramarital affair with a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] poet. This leads Anna to confess to her romantic affair with Langston to her husband. While initially angry, Anna's husband finds the power to forgive his wife. Anna and Langston depart on friendly terms. While Langston is driving with Dumi to visit his family, Dumi is killed by a gang of carjackers he had wronged earlier. This murder leads Langston to reflect on the importance of forgiveness. Meanwhile, Anne reflects on the sins of her people and pleads for the land to forgive then.  The postscript mentions that 21,8000 victims testified to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and that 1,165 perpetrators received amnesty under the peace process.  
In Rwanda We Say…The Family That Does Not Speak Dies

But gradually, the victims and oppressors start talking to the camera, and then to each other as they start the difficult task of living with each other. The documentary portrays how the people's spirits cannot be crushed by the [[Rwandan Genocide]], the 1994 mass killing of hundreds of thousands of Rwanda's minority [[Tutsis]] and the moderates of its [[Hutu]] majority by the [[Interahamwe]] and the [[Impuzamugambi]].

The Incredibles
  Public opinion turns against superheroes—also called "Supers"—due to the collateral damage caused by their crime-fighting. After several lawsuits, the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, which forces supers to permanently adhere to their [[Secret identity|secret identities]]. Fifteen years later, [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Bob and Helen Parr]]—formerly known as [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Elastigirl]]—and their children [[Violet Parr|Violet]], [[List of The Incredibles characters#Dash Parr|Dash]], and baby [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] are a suburban family living in Metroville. Although he loves his family, Bob resents the mundanity of his suburban lifestyle and white-collar job. Together with his friend Lucius Best, formerly known as [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Frozone]], Bob occasionally relives "the glory days" by moonlighting as a [[vigilante]]. After his [[List of The Incredibles characters#Gilbert Huph|supervisor]] prevents him from stopping a mugging, Bob loses his temper and injures him, resulting in his dismissal. Returning home, Bob finds a message from a mysterious woman named [[List of The Incredibles characters#Mirage|Mirage]], who gives him a mission to destroy a savage [[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|tripod]]-like robot, [[List of The Incredibles characters#Omnidroid|the Omnidroid]], on the remote island of Nomanisan. Bob finds the Omnidroid and deactivates it by tricking it into ripping out its own power source.  Bob finds the action and higher pay rejuvenating; he improves his relationship with his family and begins rigorous training while awaiting more work from Mirage for the next two months. Discovering a tear in his suit, he visits superhero costume designer [[Edna Mode]]. Assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, Mode also makes new suits for the other family members. Leaving for Nomanisan once again, Bob discovers Mirage is working for Buddy Pine, a disaffected former fan whom Mr. Incredible had rejected as his sidekick. Having adopted the alias of [[List of The Incredibles characters#Syndrome|Syndrome]], he has been perfecting the Omnidroid by hiring different superheroes to fight it, modifying it on the occasion that a super wins. Syndrome intends to send the latest Omnidroid to Metroville, where he will secretly manipulate its controls to defeat it in public, becoming a "hero" himself. Later, he will sell his inventions so that everyone can become "super", rendering the term meaningless and creating a society where everyone possesses equal physical power.  Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. Helen activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be captured. Helen borrows a private plane to head for Nomanisan; she discovers that Violet and Dash have stowed away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Helen's radio transmissions are picked up by Syndrome, who sends missiles to shoot her down. The plane is destroyed, but Helen and the kids survive and use their powers to travel to the island. Helen infiltrates the base, and discovers Syndrome's intentions. Distraught by Syndrome's callousness when her life was threatened, Mirage releases Bob and informs him of his family's survival. Helen arrives and races off with Bob to find their children. Dash and Violet are chased by Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with their powers before reuniting with their parents. Syndrome captures them, leaving them imprisoned while he follows the rocket transporting the Omnidroid to Metroville.  The Parrs escape to Metroville in a spare rocket. True to its programming, the Omnidroid recognizes Syndrome as a threat and targets the remote on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling it while knocking him unconscious. The Parrs and Frozone fight the Omnidroid; the battle is indecisive until Bob acquires the remote, allowing Helen to control one of the robot's claws and use it to destroy its power source. Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome, who plans to kidnap and raise Jack-Jack as his own sidekick to exact revenge on the family. As Syndrome is traveling upward to reach his jet, Jack-Jack's own superpowers start to manifest and he attacks Syndrome midair. As Helen catches Jack-Jack, Syndrome manages to board the plane, but Bob throws his car at Syndrome, causing him to be sucked into the jet's turbine, killing him and causing the aircraft to explode. The Parrs survive with Violet's force field, though the plane destroys their house when the fuselage falls.  Three months later, the Parrs witness the arrival of a new supervillain called [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|The Underminer]]. They put on their superhero masks, ready to face the new threat together as a family.  
Incident at Loch Ness
 After a mysterious shot of a body floating in Loch Ness (reprised near the end), ''Incident at Loch Ness'' flashes back to the beginning of a [[Documentary film|documentary]] called '''''Herzog in Wonderland''''' being directed by [[John Bailey (cinematographer)|John Bailey]] with an overview of Herzog's work as he himself begins work for a separate documentary to be called ''Enigma of Loch Ness'', in which he is exploring the [[Loch Ness Monster]] myth.<ref name="nytimes"></ref> Throughout the film, Herzog asserts the Loch Ness Monster is merely a creation of a collective psychological need in society.<ref name="offscreen" />  As the film continues, Herzog hosts a dinner party to kick off film production. In attendance are his wife ([[Lena Herzog]]), several Hollywood celebrities ([[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Ricky Jay]]), and the film's crew. Difficulties begin to arise as the untested [[Film producer|producer]], [[Zak Penn]], attempts to transform Herzog's film into a high-grossing [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]. In this attempt, Penn commits several Hollywood clichés such as hiring a beautiful woman ([[Kitana Baker]]) for a dubious role as a [[sonar]] operator and a self-deluded [[cryptozoologist]] (Michael Karnow) for comic relief.<ref name="nytimes" />  As the shooting progresses, the tension between Herzog and Penn escalates with each revelation that Penn is acting in an underhanded manner. First, it becomes quite apparent the producer has commissioned a fake "[[Nessie]]" to be used. Then both Kitana and Karnow are revealed to be actors hired by Penn.<ref name="offscreen" />  In a twist of events, when Herzog and his crew are working on their film, the crew begins to see what appears to truly be the Loch Ness Monster. Herzog and crew become more and more concerned as first the boat's motor fails and then the "monster" appears to be attacking the vessel in a deepening fog. The crew huddles below decks until the monster returns again to ram the boat hard enough to cause it to begin to sink. Karnow is thrown overboard during another attack, "Nessie" now clearly visible to the crew. Karnow is lost in the fog and presumably eaten by the monster.  After Penn and the [[assistant director]], [[Robert O'Meara]], sneak away in the liferaft, Herzog decides to put on the ship's sole [[wetsuit]] and swim to shore for help.<ref name="ebert" /> Before he can do so, however, "Nessie" returns to finally sink the ship. While holding a camera in a water-resistant housing, Herzog captures underwater images of a large creature passing him in the murky, dark water.  The next day, Penn is found by vacationers and leads them back to recover all but O'Meara and Karnow, who are presumed dead. At this point, it appears that both the documentary film we have been watching and the documentary film we were watching Herzog make could be fictitious. However, this never becomes completely obvious, and the film ends without making it clear exactly who is duping whom.<ref name="offscreen"></ref>  
Inside I'm Dancing
 Michael Connolly is a 24-year-old with [[cerebral palsy]] who is a long-term resident of the Carrigmore Residential Home for the Disabled run by the formidable Eileen. His life, mundane and schedule-driven by the institution's authorities, is transformed when the maverick Rory O'Shea, who suffers from [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]], suddenly moves in. Michael is stunned to discover that fast talking Rory, prone to lewd and/or overt jokes at unpredictable intervals, and who can move only his right hand, can understand his almost unintelligible speech. Rory's dynamic and rebellious nature soon sparks a flame in Michael, introducing him to the wider world outside of Carrigmore.  On a day out in Dublin led by Carrigmore collecting for "the needs of the disabled", Rory leads Michael astray, sneaking off to a local pub with their donation bucket, charming a group of girls at a corner table at which sits Siobhán; later they see Siobhán again while traversing a neighbouring [[nightclub]], which they get into only by Michael citing Irish and EU Disability Discrimination Law text to the [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]].  Rory has meanwhile repeatedly failed in his application for the Independent Living Allowance; he is always denied that on the grounds of irresponsibility and poor judgement, but told to reapply in six months. Inspired by his example Michael applies for the allowance himself; with the help of Rory as his interpreter Michael gets the allowance but they struggle to find an apartment that is both [[wheelchair accessible]] and affordable. Rory convinces Michael to visit his estranged father who, out of guilt, gives them the money and property they need to set up on their own.  They interview for a care-giver with little success, but later they meet Siobhán working in a local supermarket, and try to convince her to take on the job. Despite not having any professional experience she reluctantly accepts. Seeing that Michael and Siobhán are platonically friendly to each other, Rory becomes jealous – culminating in a [[Joyride (crime)|joyride]] with local kids in a stolen car, crashing it, subsequently getting briefly detained by the police.  Siobhán invites Rory and Michael along to a costume party; but after Siobhán rejects Michaels advances she decides to bring in Peter, a qualified Personal Assistant to replace herself. Michael is distraught over Siobhán's departure from their lives, and considering suicide; Rory finds him on the edge of the [[James Joyce Bridge]]. Michael jokingly complains the edge is too high for him to throw himself off, and Rory talks him out of it, reminding him he has a future and to enjoy it.

Michael visits Siobhán and with her help goes to the review board on behalf of Rory to argue his case, another chance having come up after six months. The board initially refuse, restating the same arguments, however Michael responds that ''"the right must exist independently of its exercising"'' and as a gesture the board approve Rory's independent living allowance in principle – but before they can get to the hospital to tell Rory the news, he has already died.  Michael and Siobhan attend Rory's funeral. Michael hears in his mind Rory's words ''"Well, then, are we going out?"'' and after saying goodbye to Siobhan, Michael heads out on his own.  
Infection (2004 film)
 At a run down, understaffed hospital, Dr. Akiba refuses to admit a patient with a strange black rash and is alerted to a serious crisis in Room 3 where a burn victim has died, having apparently been given the wrong drug. Akiba, another doctor, and four nurses decide to cover up the cause of death and move the body to an unused room. Akiba then discovers that the patient he refused to admit has been left in the hallway. Doctor Akai decides to study his symptoms: though he is still alive, his body mass is liquefying into green goo. Not knowing how much Akai knows about the events in Room 3, Akiba and the others reluctantly agree to help with the examination but when they return to the patient's room, they find he has vanished and the head nurse has been knocked unconscious.  The doctors find that they are risk of infection, when the head nurse begins to bleed green goo from both her ears and eyes. The doctors put her on a bed and cover her with plastic in an attempt to limit the infection's spread.  Soon after, the mean nurse finds the young nurse drawing blood on herself. Their conversation goes awry, when the young nurse lets out a manic laugh and plunges two needles into her body, splattering the nurse with green goo. While speaking with a patient he killed earlier, Uozumi is overcome with guilt and starts crying. Akiba walks in, but finds Uozumi alone. His eyes turn white and green goo starts seeping from him. Akiba panics and turns to find a nurse, now infected and covered in green goo, smiling and hanging upside down from the ceiling. After finding the nurse giving her own blood to the dead burn patient and running into the infected head nurse, Akiba flees the room.  Akiba confronts Akai and accuses him of creating and spreading the virus. Akai denies this and explains that the infection is actually spread mentally, infecting the [[subconscious]] of its victims. He then urges Akiba to remember what really happened in Room 3 earlier in the night. Dr. Nakazono walks in to find Akiba talking to himself, forcing him to realize that he's been speaking with his reflection. He looks around and sees the corpses of the two nurses who are dead and covered in blood with no green goo in sight. Soon, Dr. Nakazono realizes that the last few hours have all been a hallucination. Nakazono calls the police, as Akiba recalls the events in Room 3 and realizes that "Akai" was actually the burn patient. The same series of events is shown again, but with Akiba as the burn patient and Akai as Akiba, giving the order for the wrong drug, which massacres the entire staff.  The hospital is evacuated the next morning as all of the staff, except Nakazono, are dead and the police is searching for Akiba who has disappeared. When Nakazono leaves the hospital, she sees all the red lights change to green and vice versa; panicking, she accidentally cuts her hand and green blood pours out. A shot of a locker is seen in the room where the burn victim was kept. Someone inside the locker is calling for help as green goo starts pouring out of it. The top of the locker opens and Akiba's hand covered in goo reaches out before falling to the floor.  
Innocence (2004 film)
 After a series of images of rushing water, forest, and dark, empty subterranean hallways, six-year-old Iris arrives in a coffin placed in the dormitory's common area, where she is met with curiosity by the other six girls of the house. After grooming and dressing her, they all exchange hair ribbons with each other – each girl gets the ribbons passed down from the girl a year above her. Iris, the new youngest "red ribbon", excites the ire of Selma, the former red ribbon, who complains about absence of the former violet-ribbon Natacha—the oldest who had been her friend. The new violet ribbon, Bianca, takes Iris under her wing. At first Iris is homesick, and believes that she will be reunited with her brother, but Bianca matter-of-factly tells her there is no possibility of that: there are no boys allowed. All of the girls in the school go swimming, and Iris quickly befriends Laura, the red-ribbon of another house. That night, much to Iris's dismay, Bianca leaves on an authorized mysterious errand that she cannot discuss. The next day, Iris has a routine day at the school – dance lessons, classroom time with animals, and recreation. The classes at the school are run by two young women: Mademoiselle Edith, who walks with a cane and teaches lessons, and Mademoiselle Eva, who teaches dance. Each house is cared for by an elderly serving woman; the girls whisper that all of the employees are girls who tried to escape the walled school in their youth, and were pressed into permanent service as punishment.  One night, Iris follows Bianca on her secret errand, but she loses track of the older girl once she reaches the main building. She explores, but only stumbles across more she does not understand: a shadowy man preparing an injection for a shadowy woman. She flees, and is lost in the woods for the night. After a period of smoldering animosity, Selma makes overtures to befriend Iris, but then beats her with a switch (stem) when Iris asks about Bianca's nightly departures. Selma also uses her fingertip, touching Iris's wound, to gingerly taste Iris's blood. As time passes, Laura, unlike Iris, is morose and unable to adapt to life at the school. With Iris's help – and a pledge of secrecy – she steals a rowboat in an attempt to escape, but drowns. A distressed Iris tells Bianca nonetheless. The school holds a funeral, where Laura's coffin is burned on a pyre.  As the year changes, the focus shifts to Alice, the fifth-year blue ribbon, who is hungry to leave the school and see the world outside. She has placed her hopes on winning the annual inspection of the blue ribbons, where the mysterious headmistress arrives from afar and after watching them dance, chooses one girl from the class to leave with her. Though Mademoiselle Edith cautions that she shouldn't get her hopes up, Alice has been anticipating this moment – and her own winning of the honor of leaving. Though the competition is close, another girl is chosen instead. Alice collapses at the headmistress's feet. She convalesces, but isn't the same as before: she doesn't speak, and aimlessly and perpetually stares into space. Finally, she runs away, and climbs the stone wall that surrounds the school. As we see her flee into the woods beyond, we hear the sound of distant gunshots and barking dogs. Later, as Eva looks pensively out a window, Edith informs her that Alice cannot be found; she then informs the group of girls that Alice is very bad, and will not be seen or spoken of again.  After Alice's escape, the focus turns to Bianca. The violet ribbons are told about the bodily changes that they will soon experience, and Bianca grows pensive. For the first time, she brings Nadja, the black-ribbon girl a year her junior. Together, they go to the main school building, and enter a secret passage behind the grandfather clock. There, the girls get into butterfly costumes, and prepare: each night they put on a recital for an audience. The next night, Nadia falters, but a man in the audience tells Bianca she is the most beautiful, and throws her a rose. After the show, Bianca and another girl explore the empty theater. They find an abandoned glove, and encounter one of the servants counting the performance's receipts—this, the girls are informed, is how the school makes its money. Bianca keeps the rose and the glove as a treasure, and fantasizes about the glove's touch, but casts them both into the water. Iris and Bianca spend the morning together on what Bianca explains will be her last day at the school. After a formal, tearful goodbye, she passes off her duties to Nadja. Bianca and the other violet ribbons put their ribbons in a box, and accompany Eva and Edith further down the hallway behind the clock than they've ever been before. There, they board a subway train, and leave the school. Eva smokes a cigarette. Back at the house, a new girl emerges from her coffin. The train arrives at a grand, modern plaza, and the girls are left by Eva and Edith. Bianca immediately begins playing in one of the fountains. A group of nearby teenage boys lose their ball in the fountain, and one wades in after it. Though he is obscured by the fountain's display, he fascinates Bianca. She splashes at him, and he splashes back. The film ends as it began, with a shot of rushing water.  
Inconscientes
 In 1913 [[Barcelona]], Alma, who is nine-months pregnant, returns home one day to find her husband, Leon, an eminent psychiatrist, about to flee their home and his practice. He has come back from a session with Dr. [[Freud]] in [[Vienna]] that has left him distraught. Left to have her baby alone, the witty and beautiful Alma enlists the help of her sister’s husband – also a psychiatrist - the dispassionate, repressed Salvador, to help her solve the mystery of Leon’s sudden departure. Ignoring his better judgment, Salvador agrees to help her, even though he sees it could be trouble for him with his prim, frigid wife, Olivia, Alma’s sister.  There is a sibling rivalry between Alma and Olivia that is shared by their husbands. Olivia is jealous of her feminist sister as the favorite of their father, Dr. Mira, the pompous chief of staff in the hospital where both Leon and Salvador have their practice. Helping her father, Alma serves as translator in a lecture by Dr. [[Alois Alzheimer]] – who is unable to remember anything.  The beautiful Alma is as free-spirited as Salvador is uptight. Helping her, Salvador quickly runs into trouble. After an accidental self-hypnosis, he confesses that he is deeply in love with Alma, and that he married her sister, the ostensibly sexually inhibited Olivia, only to be near her. Still under hypnosis, traumatized by comments made by his wife regarding the size of his member, he exposes himself in a public place and his father-in-law fires him from his job.  A trail of clues initially indicates that Leon’s disappearance may be connected to the concealment of embarrassing revelations about the sex life of the King of Spain, [[Alfonso XIII]]. Hints also led them to the back room of a barn that serves as a hide-out for making pornographic films. They also visit a deranged woman in a mad-house, a cross-dressing club and a high-class bordello, led all the while by clues contained in Leon’s thesis: a detailed journal of his psychoanalytic sessions with four women he is treating for “hysteria”: a psychotic woman who tried to murder her husband; an actress with a persecution complex; a woman with a serious crisis concerning her sexual identity; and a stranger who has discovered a terrible secret about her past.  Salvador and Alma's investigation reveals a series of outrageous secrets. These include that Olivia has been living a secret life, going to a transvestite club. She has a lesbian lover and plans to leave her husband. Alma’s alcoholic housekeeper, the unsympathetic Senora Mingarro, turns out to be Leo’s biological mother, the result of a torrid affair with Dr. Mira, which makes Alma and Leon's marriage an incestuous union. The sudden reappearance of Leon only complicates things further.  Eventually they all attend a distinguished gathering in honor of Dr. Freud, who has come to Barcelona to discourse on his new book, “Totem and Taboo.”  Since Leon attributes all of his problems to Dr. Freud's theories on sexuality, he plans to kill him. However, the fall of a big chandelier aborts the assassination attempt. Leon and Dr. Mira die as a result of the accident with the chandelier. Olivia leaves for Paris where she wants to have a freer life with her lesbian lover. Alma gives birth to a baby boy. She realizes that she has fallen in love with Salvador and they become a happy couple.  
Iron Jawed Angels
 [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] return from England where they met while participating in the [[Women's Social and Political Union]] started by radical suffragette leader [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and led by her daughter [[Christabel Pankhurst]]. The pair presents a plan to the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association|National American Woman's Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA) to campaign directly in Washington D.C. for national voting rights for women. They find that their ideas are too forceful for the established suffragette leaders, particularly [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], but they are allowed to lead the NAWSA Congressional Committee in D.C. They start by organizing the [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|1913 Woman Suffrage Procession]] on the eve of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s inauguration.  While soliciting donations at an art gallery, Paul convinces labor lawyer [[Inez Milholland]] to lead the parade on a white horse. Paul also meets a Washington newspaper political cartoonist, Ben Weissman (a fictional character), and there are hints of romantic overtones. In a fictional scene, Paul tries to explain to [[Ida B. Wells]] why she wants African American women to march in the back of the parade in order to not anger southern Democrats and activists, but Wells refuses, and she comes out of the crowd to join a white group during the middle of the parade (Wells did refuse to be segregated, and marched with her state delegation, but never met with Paul about it.<ref>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2226351</ref>). After disagreements over fundraising, Paul and Burns are forced out of the NAWSA, and they found the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP) to support their approach. Alice Paul briefly explores a romantic relationship with Ben Weissman.  Further conflicts within the movement are portrayed as NAWSA leaders criticize NWP tactics, such as protesting against Wilson, and their sustained picketing outside of the White House in the [[Silent Sentinels]] action. Relations between the American government and the NWP protesters also intensify, as many women are arrested for their actions and charged with "obstructing traffic."  The arrested women are sent to the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]] for 60-day terms. Despite [[Night of Terror (event)|abusive and terrorizing treatment]], Paul and other women undertake a [[hunger strike]], during which paid guards [[Force-feeding|force-feed]] them milk and raw eggs. The suffragists are blocked from seeing visitors or lawyers, until (fictional) [[U.S. Senator]] Tom Leighton visits his wife Emily, one of the imprisoned women. News of their treatment leaks to the media after Emily secretly passes a letter to her husband during his visit. Paul, Burns, and the other women are released.  Pressure continues to be put on President Wilson as the NAWSA joins in the NWP call for passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Wilson finally accedes to the pressure rather than be called out in the international press for fighting for democracy in Europe while denying democracy's benefits to half of the U.S. population. During the amendment's ratification, [[Harry T. Burn]], a member of the Tennessee legislature, receives a telegram from his mother at the last minute, changes his vote, and the amendment passes.  
Intern Academy

During on-the-job training taught by Dr. Olson, interns brave blood, vomit and exploding colostomy bags. The students include Mike Bonnert, whose parents are physicians, Mitzi Cole, who works as a stripper to pay her way through school, and the innocent Christine who loses her inhibitions when intoxicated.  Mike discovers that his girlfriend, Mitzi, became sexually active with another intern.  They begin to fight in the morgue, using human organs as weapons.  They are caught and expelled from St. Albert's. But when a 76-car pile up occurs, they return to ER to help the patients. One patient, who was saved in an emergency surgery, was a billionaire, and saves the hospital from going bankrupt.

It frees the Four War Gods (Ryūra, Jūra, Kyōra and Gōra), and the scars appear on the rest of all children. Ai, not affected by the gods, leaves the island to meet up with Inuyasha and his friends. The heroes learn that Gōra used Kikyo's blood to create her [[doppelganger]] and Ryūra placed the scar on Inuyasha, though Inuyasha and the children cannot resist it. One man tells the story about the myth of the island, before Kikyō sets out to aid Inuyasha. As the rest of the villagers safely head to the shrine, Sesshomaru remembers the day he got the scar. Upon arriving at the island, Inuyasha and his friends are ambushed by Jūra. While Miroku and Sango manage to distract Jūra, Inuyasha saves Kagome and Ai from Ryūra. After the heroes meet the rest of the children, they head to the cauldron. When Inuyasha and Asagi end up in the dimension of the cauldron, they learn that the priestess Kanade died sealing the gods fifty years ago. Before Inuyasha and Asagi leave the cauldron, they obtain the sealed box. When the doppelganger steals it, she breaks it to release the power spheres and strengthen the gods. The heroes plan to abandon the island. Sesshomaru kills Kyōra and destroys the cauldron, Miroku and Sango defeat Jūra, and Kikyō kills the doppelganger to save Inuyasha. After Inuyasha defeats Ryūra and Gōra, the four spheres combine to create the final War God. After the spiritual fireflies lead the children to Kikyo's bow, Kagome uses it. With the blessing of the fireflies, Inuyasha and Kagome combine their attacks to defeat the god. With the island gone, Inuyasha, Sesshomaru and the children are freed from the curse.  
It's All Gone Pete Tong
  Frankie Wilde was a music producer and a DJ, born in London ([[United Kingdom]]). After years of playing in night-clubs he loses his hearing. Frankie's loss of hearing is first apparent when he hears a high-pitched whine instead of an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] [[Association football|football]] match on TV. At this time, Frankie is making his next album with his "two [[Austria]]n mates" Alfonse and Horst, who seem more suited for a rock band. Frankie continues working on his album and playing gigs at clubs, but his hearing degrades rapidly. As a result, progress on his album stagnates. However, Frankie refuses to acknowledge his problem until a gig in [[Amnesia (nightclub)|Amnesia]], when he cannot hear the second channel in his headphones and must crossfade one song into the next without being able to beatmatch them. The result sounds terrible, and the crowd boos him. Overcome with fear and frustration, he throws the turntable and the [[mixing console|mixer]] onto the dance floor, and is forcibly removed from the club.  The next day, Max confronts Frankie about the performance. Frankie agrees to see a doctor, who tells him he's lost hearing in one ear and has 20% left in the other. He warns Frankie that unless he stops abusing drugs and listening to loud noises, he will soon be completely deaf. Even the use of his hearing aid would only further degrade his hearing.  Then, during a recording session, Frankie confesses the full nature of his hearing loss to Alfonse. He inserts his hearing aid to demonstrate, and, overwhelmed by the sudden sound exposure, leans close to one of the monitor speakers. Before he can react, a frustrated Horst smashes a guitar into an amplifier whose volume Frankie has maximized. The noise is excruciating, and the feedback knocks Frankie unconscious. The damage leaves him permanently deaf.  Without his hearing, Frankie cannot complete his album. He loses his recording contract, and Max abandons him. Soon after, Sonya leaves him. The talking head sequences describe this period as his darkest hour, in which he shuts himself into his home, which he has "soundproofed" with pillows in a desperate bid to recover his hearing. His drug use intensifies, and he appears to be heavily depressed. In one scene, he repeatedly throws his body against the walls. In other, he wraps [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]]s around his head, either an attempt at suicide or a drastic way to recover his hearing, but dives into the pool before they ignite.  In a culmination moment of the movie, Frankie flushes all his drugs down a toilet, only to be faced with the vision of the menacing badger again. The two begin to scuffle, with Frankie eventually gaining the upper hand and beating the badger with a shovel, then grabbing a shotgun and shooting it, upon which the badger begins to bleed cocaine. Frankie then grabs the dying badger's head, and removes it, only to reveal that the badger is, in fact, himself. He then shoots the dying vision of himself in the head.  After this dark period, Frankie finds a deaf organization and meets Penelope, an instructor for the deaf who coaches him in lip-reading. They become close, and eventually intimate. He confides his unhappiness at losing music, and she helps him perceive sound through visual and tactile methods instead.  Frankie then manages to devise a system for mixing songs, in which he watches [[Oscilloscope|an oscilloscope trace]] while resting his feet on the pulsating speakers, a callback to an earlier claim he made in the film about flip flops. Using this system, he heads to the studio and manages to produce new mix CD (Hear No Evil) entirely by himself. He delivers it to Max, who is wildly pleased – particularly by the potential of using Frankie's disability to increase record sales. He has Frankie take part in advertising and promotional deals which are increasingly offensive and insensitive to deaf people, which Penelope silently disapproves of. He also treats Penelope like he did Sonya; as Frankie's sexual object, not recognizing her substantial role in Frankie's life. In general, Max tends to patronizingly characterize the deaf as pained, helpless victims desperate for a deaf role model.  Max convinces Frankie to play live at [[Pacha Group|Pacha]] as a career comeback. He thinks it is an opportunity for Frankie to prove himself to others, despite Frankie's insistence that he has nothing to prove to his critics. The gig goes exceedingly well, and many claim it showcases even greater talent than his early work. After the show, Frankie and Penelope disappear from Max, the media, and the music scene altogether. In a talking heads sequence, characters speculate on where he is now (if alive).  As the film ends, we see Frankie disguised as a homeless street musician, who is then met by Penelope and a child (presumably their own). They affectionately walk together down a street unrecognized.  Additionally, we see Frankie teaching a group of deaf children how to perceive sound like he does.

Jaago (2004 film)
 After a long day in school, ten-year-old Shruti Varma is accidentally locked in the school house, and by the time she is found and released, it is already night time. She boards a commuter train home, with an elderly couple and their daughter being her only company in the compartment. Then a trio of three young men, drug-hazed and violent, enter the wagon, notice the young girl and brutally [[gang-rape]] her. The other passengers are too timid to intervene; only after the culprits have left the train do they call the police. Shruti is taken to a hospital, but the trauma of the rape proves too much for her to bear, and she eventually dies from a massive shock in front of her anguished parents, Shrikant and Shradha Varma.  Kripa Shankar Thakur, an honest and upright inspector of the Indian police, is entrusted with the case by the Police Commissioner. He begins to sympathise with the parents, especially after coming face to face with the indifference and selfishness of the authorities (even within the police force itself) and everyone who is – even indirectly – responsible for Shruti's rape and death. In addition, the culprits turn out to be the sons of wealthy and influential citizens, making it highly difficult for justice to be dealt out in the regular way.  After tracking down the identities of the witnesses, Shankar sets a trap to catch the offenders in the act: Dressed provocatively, Shradha acts as bait by boarding the same train her daughter had taken. Indeed, the three culprits reappear and attempt to rape her as well. In her rage over her daughter's suffering at the hands of these men, Shradha retrieves a knife from her handbag and viciously stabs one of her attackers to death; consequently, she is arrested and detained for manslaughter.  More determined than ever, Inspector Shankar continues his pursuit for justice, even with the weight of corruption rising to obstruct him; he meets threats with counter-threats and attempts at bribery with the arrest of the perpetrators, and even gains popular support from influential people in law enforcement. But this is not enough for Shrikant: with his desperation having become unbearable, he bursts into the courthouse where the offenders are on preliminary trial, and shoots one of them.  Just when the cause seems lost for the surviving rapist, his lawyer Satyaprakash Satwani resorts to vicious methods: he manages to buy off Shankar's friend Sawant, who is to kill the witnesses before they can testify in court. But Shankar proves to be too resilient; he kidnaps Sawant's wife and son, forcing the latter to release the witnesses. With the family's testimony and the moving pleas of Shrikant and Shradha for more justice, and Shankar's own accusation of the corruption in India's political system, the presiding judge acquits the Varmas and sentences the last of the culprits to death by hanging, with Shrikant and Shradha acting as his executioners.  Following the execution, the film ends with the judge walking towards a sunset beach, saying by [[voiceover]]: "After delivering the verdict, I handed in my resignation. I don't know how those who know the law will react to my decision. What I do know, however, is that I have done justice to my soul. I have truly awakened," and then turning to the audience with the reminder: "It's time you awakened too."

 Randy (Pitt), a 20-year-old convict, is taken to his cell by a Correctional Officer (David Zayas). He is greeted by his new cellmate, Jake (Guirgis), a veteran prisoner serving a [[life sentence]].  Randy explains that he is serving 25 years for spray painting his neighbor's [[Mercedes-Benz]].  The next morning, Jake begins telling Randy a story about the worst sexual encounter he ever had.  The story terrifies Randy, who begins to realize that Jake's motive may be more than just friendship.  The conversation turns toward how Jake feels [[homosexuality]] is a state of mind. The breakfast bell rings and the story is interrupted, much to Randy's relief.  Jake seems to drop the topic and return to his more friendly demeanor.  However, Randy is quickly brought back to the horrible reality of his situation when Jake forces him to wear his shirt in a feminine style and to hold his hand as they go to lunch (See [[prison sexuality]]).  Several months later, Randy's mother ([[Laila Robins]]) visits him at the prison. Randy lies to her and says his cell mate and he are getting along well. The brief visit only highlights Randy's isolation, as his mother is powerless to do anything to help him.  Moments later, Jake again prods the now bruised and bloody Randy to tell him about his "worst fuck."  Randy tells Jake about his first sexual experience: he was 17 and drunk in a [[Tijuana]] strip club, and paid a stripper $35 for [[oral sex]] in a room above the dance floor. Afterwards, he saw the same stripper perform a striptease in which she revealed that she was a pre-operational [[transsexual]]. Randy then tells Jake that he "thought that was the worst it was ever going to get," insinuating that his current situation as Jake's sex slave is far worse. Jake appears angry and offended, but then seems guilt ridden.  Again, Jake snaps out of his more tender feelings and, replacing them with cruelty, forces Randy to perform oral sex on him.  Afterward, Jake makes pleasant conversation as Randy lies in the [[fetal position]] in his bunk.  That night, as Jake sleeps, Randy creeps silently to his cellmate's bedside, preparing to stab him in the throat with a pencil as the older man sleeps.  Randy hesitates and Jake wakes up.  Jake doesn't attempt to physically restrain Randy, but instead tells him that he doesn't have the heart to kill a man in cold blood, and that even if he did he wouldn't kill him. Jake tells Randy that he is all that Randy has, that he is his protection, alluding perhaps to an even more brutal sexual slavery among other inmates were he not tied down to Jake.  He sincerely tells Randy that he is his only friend. Jake then tells Randy to go back to his bed and think about all the things he will do when he is finally released.  Jake then tells the now nearly tearful Randy why his mother stopped writing back; she had died and no one told him. The prison authorities had refused to let him go to his mother's funeral.  Jake then tells Randy to make sure that he gets to see his mother's funeral, that it is very important to be able to say goodbye.

However, Hung is unhappy with Lefty's leadership style of fear and brutality to keep his underlings in line, and is hesitant to cede power to Lefty. To further complicate matters, news of Hung becoming a father has spread unrest amongst his under-bosses, and there are rumours that someone has placed a hit on Mr. Hung.

Kamaraj (film)
 The narration is divided into three phases. The pre-Independence period, depicting Kamaraj's childhood, the influence of Satyamurthy, Kamarajs growth as a politician and his prison life.  The second phase depicts his taking over as the Congress Chief Minister of the state, the reforms he tries to bring in, especially in education, his largesse and his bending the rules for a good cause-like for the urgent eye-operation of a kid. It also displayed his sense of humour (like his response when his mother in the village sends word that she needed a fan and a blanket), his refusal to take advantage of his position (asking for the newly installed tap to be removed from his village-house).  The third phase where he puts forth the Kamaraj Plan, resigns from the post of CM, involves himself in party work; his influence on national politics, his emergence as a kingmaker and finally his disillusionment with the emerging non-ethics in political life.  The closing scene (taken from the record files of the actual funeral), show swarms of humanity mourning the death of their beloved leader.

Keane (film)
 Searching for his missing daughter Sophia in the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]], from which she was abducted several months earlier, William Keane confronts ticket agents and random passersby with a newspaper account of her disappearance, but no one recalls seeing the little girl. After spending the night wandering the streets and sleeping along the side of the highway, he returns to the cheap hotel where he is living and finds he is unable to get into his room. The desk clerk tells him his payment is in arrears, and Keane covers the cost of another week's stay with a disability check.  Alone in his hotel room, Keane drinks beer and talks to himself about his ex-wife and the birth of their daughter, and he reads the clippings about another abducted New Jersey girl who was found and reunited with her parents he keeps in an envelope. He makes contact with a drug dealer and purchases cocaine, and the more he ingests the more paranoid he becomes, certain he is being followed and watched and even going so far as physically attacking a man he believed was watching him. He goes to a nightclub and snorts coke with a woman named Michelle, then has sex in a bathroom stall with her.  Back at his motel, Keane meets Lynn Bedik and her daughter Kira, who is close in age to his missing child. Lynn clearly is having financial difficulties, and he insists she take the $100 he offers her. She asks Keane to watch Kira for a few hours, then calls the motel and leaves a message she will not be returning that night as planned. Keane reassures a despondent Kira, who fears Lynn has abandoned her, that her mother loves her and will be back.  The following day, Keane takes Kira to a local indoor skating rink and teaches her how to ice skate. While they are playing [[skee ball]] in the adjacent arcade, Keane believes he is being watched by another patron and becomes agitated. Kira manages to calm him and they return to the motel. When Lynn arrives later, she explains she was with Kira's father Eric, who has arranged for them to move to [[Albany, New York]], where he has found a job.  Desperate not to lose Kira because she reminds him so much of Sophia, Keane goes to her school, takes her without permission, and brings her with him to the Port Authority, allegedly to meet her mother there and board a bus to Albany. There he sends her to buy candies, as his daughter had done several months earlier, just minutes before she was abducted. It seems as if Keane is reviving the tragic loss of his daughter, perhaps expecting the abductor to show up again and try this time to abduct Kira too — as he was expecting him to show up every time he was visiting the station for all those months, imagining his plan and his schedule. This doesn't happen. He cries for his losses and decides to really get her to her mother. Kira tells him she loves him and he says he loves her too.

Kekexili: Mountain Patrol
 The film opens with the summary execution of a patrol member by poachers and then follows, in quasi-documentary style, reporter Ga Yu (played by [[Zhang Lei (actor)|Zhang Lei]]) who is sent from [[Beijing]] to investigate. In Kekexili he meets Ritai (played by Tibetan actor [[Tobgyal]], or Duo Bujie (多布杰) in Mandarin) at the [[Sky burial]] of the deceased patrol member. Ritai is the leader of the vigilantes who, despite poverty and the lack of any government support, roam the land to protect the endangered [[Tibetan antelope]] from extinction. Admitted into the patrol, Ga becomes a sort of [[embedded journalist]] in the hunt for the poachers across Kekexili.  The patrol team hunts down a family of poachers and learns from them the whereabouts of their gunman and leader. But the long journey means they can no longer afford to follow on with the entire team and captured poachers. They release the poachers and send one of the cars, driven by Liu Dong (played by [[Qi Liang]]), back with the injured and sick team members to the hospital.  He did not have sufficient funds for the medical fee and Ritai tells him to sell some antelope skins to raise the money. Ga questioned the sales of antelope skins and learns from Ritai that they have received no funds from the government for at least a year.  The two remaining vehicles continue the search but one of them breaks down. Ritai ask them to wait for the other car to return and pick them up, but severe weather forces them to trek their way home. Liu Dong, travelling alone on the way back to join Ritai with his vehicle fully stocked with supplies, is swallowed by [[dry quicksand]] when his vehicle gets stuck.  Ritai and Ga finally finds the gunman and leader. But, outnumbered and outgunned, Ritai is killed by the poacher. Ga is free to go as he is not a patrol member. Ritai's body is brought back home for a [[Sky burial]].  Captions at the end of the film state that Ga's reports on the atrocities in Kekexili shook the country. After the authorities initially arrested four patrol members for selling pelts, public pressure had them released, but the patrol is nevertheless disbanded. A year later the Chinese government declared Kekexili a "national nature preserve" and established a forestry bureau to protect it. The captions further state that antelope numbers increased to 30,000 at the time of the film’s release.

He has not been able to cope with the fact that Paolo’s mother died in childbirth and Paolo has not grown up like all the other children because of his handicap. Paolo is now fifteen years old and is about to meet his father for the first time. Gianni has been asked by the caretakers of his son to take him to a [[Berlin]] hospital for yearly tests and check-ups. According to their doctor, the "shock" of meeting his own father could help Paolo in his treatment.    When Gianni boards the night train which Paolo is already riding, it is Gianni who is in for a shock. Paolo does not seem particularly impressed nor disturbed by this first meeting with his biological father. He seems more interested in his Game Boy instead. Gianni and Nicole ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) meet accidentally in the Berlin hospital, and even though he feels awkward and almost ashamed at being seen as having fathered "such a child", they somehow connect. Nicole has spent her life caring for her daughter and could teach Gianni something if only he were willing to listen. Through a series of chance encounters aided by a book left behind by Nicole (''Born Twice'' Italian title: ''Nati due volte'', incidentally the book on which the film is based), they meet several times and get talking.  
Kekko Kamen

However, before the teachers can take their sexual advances too far, Kekko Kamen steps in and delivers a sound beating to the teachers, and usually performs a finishing attack by jumping into the air and landing crotch-first onto her opponent's face.  
Khakee
  [[Maharashtra Police]] seizes a large quantity of arms from a house in the communal riot torn town of Chandangarh. The house belongs to Dr. Iqbal Ansari ([[Atul Kulkarni]]), a Muslim doctor. The police conclude that he is an agent for [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], and is responsible for engineering the riots. Ansari is arrested and is set to be presented before a special court in [[Mumbai]]. However, the convoy of police vehicles transporting Ansari from Chandangarh is ambushed by an unknown group. The police team manages to secure him, but suffers heavy casualties.  Additional Commissioner of Police, [[Additional Commissioner of Police|AD.CP]] Naidu ([[Prakash Raj]]) assemble a team of five police officers to bring Ansari to Mumbai so that he may appear in the special court for the hearing. The leader of the team, [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|DCP]] Anant Shrivastav ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), is an honest policeman at the end of a failed career, because he refused to bend for the corrupting forces in the system. He accepts the mission, thinking that his career will finally mean something and he will be promoted to Additional Commissioner of Police in recognition of his efforts and his service. His team consists of Senior Inspector Shekhar Verma ([[Akshay Kumar]]), a corrupt cop, rookie Sub-Inspector Ashwin Gupte ([[Tusshar Kapoor]]) and two constables, Kamlesh Sawant and Gajanan Mhatre.  Before their departure, the team catches a photographer who is trying to take pictures of them. He is revealed to be linked to Yashwant Aangre ([[Ajay Devgn]]), who is spying on the team. Aangre kills the photographer and his entire family by linking explosives to their telephone's receiver in order to destroy any links the police might discover between himself and the photographer.  When the team reaches Chandangarh, the police receives a call from a school teacher named Mahalakshmi ([[Aishwarya Rai]]), who suspects that the people living on school's property are terrorists. The team accompanies the local police to find a corpse in the terrorists' room. When they raid the room, the phone rings, but Anant ensures that no one answers it, and discovers a bomb linked to the phone, set to go off when anyone answered it. He also finds evidence that the group staying there had information about their travel plans, which prompts him to change them.  Back at the police station, Ansari's mother ([[Tanuja]]) and son come to see Anant, and plead with him to ensure that Ansari reaches the court, instead of killing him en route. Shocked to hear this, Anant promises her that she will see her son in court. Anant then receives a call from Aangre, who appears to know him. Anant is unable to recognise him, and all attempts to trace the call fail. He hears the voices of his wife and daughter on the line, but it turns out that it is a recording that Aangre played to scare him.  The team, along with Mahalakshmi, leaves for Mumbai by road, only to find the highway blocked by a pile-up. They decide to take a dirt track to bypass the pile-up, but find their way blocked by an extremely crowded cattle fair. While trying to clear a path for the convoy, Anant gets a call from Aangre, who is present at the scene in disguise. Anant spots him and chases him through the fair along with Ashwin Gupte. Shekhar Verma, realising that the place was perfect for an ambush, ensures that no one gets near the van carrying Ansari.  Aangre causes a stampede, and Anant fails to catch him. As the team carries on, Shekhar realises that he left the Jeep unguarded while he was trying to guard the van. He pulls over and sees a bomb attached to the bottom of the Jeep. He makes sure that everyone gets away from it in time, but the Jeep explodes, and the shock wave of the blast causes damage to the van's engine.  The team pushes the van to a secluded house off the highway, where they decide to stay until they repair the van. Anant calls Naidu to appraise him of the events, and tells him their location so that he can send a police team. At the house, as Anant is trying to figure out who the man at the fair was, he remembers Aangre, an extremely corrupt and ruthless ex-cop, who was thrown off the force and imprisoned after Anant caught him killing five innocent men.  The team sees a police van outside, and think that it is the rescue team, but it turns out to be Aangre's men. After a few minutes of heavy firing, which thoroughly depletes the team's ammunition, Aangre's men drop off the body of the constable who was trying to repair the police van, along with a message to hand Ansari over to them. Shekhar, realising that there is no alternative, grabs Ansari and tries to hand him over, but Anant stands in his way. There is a showdown between the two, in which Shekhar accuses Anant of being a useless cop who's going to get them all killed because of his high-minded principles.  The argument reaches a point where Anant and Ashwin have their guns trained on Shekhar. At this point, Ansari breaks down and tells them that the terrorists are there to kill him, not free him. He goes on to reveal that he was an honest citizen living in Chandangarh with his family when a journalist, Bhaskar Joshi, came to him and revealed that the communal riots were actually engineered by minister Deodhar, who killed off a few social workers who had compiled evidence that would've put him in prison for a long time. Bhaskar was in possession of the file containing the evidence, and wanted Ansari to give him the post-mortem reports of the social workers so that he could expose Deodhar. However, Bhaskar was killed before he could do that, and Ansari began to receive threatening calls asking him to hand over the file of evidence against Deodhar. When he refused to cooperate, corrupt cops destroyed his house, killing most of his family, and framed him as a terrorist.  Meanwhile, Aangre and his men enter the house and hold everyone at gunpoint, except Shekhar and Ashwin, who manage to sneak Ansari to the warehouse attached to the house. As his men try to find them, Aangre tells Anant that his idea of revenge is to take away what matters the most to Anant - honour and dignity - because they mean much more to him than his life. Aangre's men locate the warehouse, but when they enter, they see a few LPG cylinders, which Ashwin shoots at from outside, causing an explosion that kills some of Aangre's men. The team manages to get into the police van, but as they're driving away, Aangre manages to shoot Ansari, who gets gravely injured. Anant then receives a call from Naidu, who accidentally lets slip that he knows that Ansari has been shot. Anant realises that Naidu is actually a corrupt cop working for Deodhar, and he was responsible for giving Aangre information about their travel plans at every turn.  The team takes Ansari to a hospital in a small town, where the doctors manage to save him, but declare that his condition is quite serious. Anant tells his team that they're free to leave, since the very people who sent them on the mission do not want them to succeed. He tells them that he has decided to go on right till the end. Shekhar apologises for their showdown the night before, and says that he would accompany Anant right till the end, if only to make up for being a corrupt cop. The rest of the team also decides to go with him.  The local police find out about the team and bring them over to police station, telling them that they have orders to relieve them and take charge of Ansari. Anant gives the officer in charge a fiery speech about how unbelievably corrupt the police force is, and how politicians like Deodhar can get away with anything only because cops like Naidu do their bidding. The officer decides to help them, and tells Naidu on the phone that they've arrested the wrong people.  At this point, Deodhar and Naidu come up with a plan to turn the local public against the police team by declaring in a press conference that the team has gone rogue and is now answering to [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]. Seeing the news on television, several locals gather at the hospital and threaten to kill Ansari. Anant confronts them head on, and tells them that they do not know what the truth is, and are being used by corrupt politicians for their personal gain.  They manage to get away to a railway station, where they're supposed to catch a service train to take them to Mumbai. Aangre and his men arrive on the train, but the team has taken precautions. Constable Kamlesh drives away from the station in the police van as a decoy. Aangre and his men fire at the van, thinking that the team is in it, but Shekhar manages to take control of the train, and the team boards it while engaged in a shootout with the terrorists. Kamlesh stops the van close to the tracks and tries to catch the train, but fails and is shot dead by Aangre.  Upon reaching Mumbai, when Ansari is being carried into the hospital, the doctors realise that he has succumbed to his injuries and died. His mother, thinking that Anant did exactly what she begged him not to do, slaps him in front of a host of reporters before he can explain things to her. The team however, gives Ansari a proper burial, and declare to the media that the case is not over.  Enraged by Anant's statement to the media, Deodhar invites him over and tells him to toe the line, but Anant refuses to bend. Later, the team tracks down journalist Bhaskar's son, who has unknowingly had the location of the file is all along. Shekhar and Mahalakshmi go to the grand post office and recover the file, but Aangre ambushes them. After a fight, Shekhar hands the file to Mahalakshmi and tells her to take it to Anant, while he stays back to fight Aangre's men. However, he is lured into a stadium where it is revealed that Mahalakshmi is actually Aangre's girlfriend and was planted on the team by him to find out where the file is. Aangre's men brutally shoot down Shekhar, but not before he places a call to Anant, letting him know that Mahalakshmi was a double agent.  Anant and Ashwin manage to track Aangre down by following Mahalakshmi. In a shootout, Aangre uses Mahalakshmi as a shield and she dies. Anant chases Aangre and manages to surround him with a large number of cops. Enraged by the horrors Aangre has inflicted throughout, Anant beats him unconscious before he is held back by the police force.   Armed with compelling evidence from the file, the court is able to convict Aangre, Deodhar, and Naidu. On the way to prison in a police van, Aangre sees that the bolts holding his handcuffs are actually loose. Breaking free, he grabs a rifle and attacks the constable in the van. Ashwin jumps out of the van to find Aangre pointing a rifle at him. Aangre pulls the trigger, but there are no bullets in the gun. He puts the gun down and surrenders with a smirk, but Ashwin shoots Aangre twice, and shows him the screws of the bolts, indicating that they were deliberately removed. Ashwin instructs the constable to stage the scene and then calls a senior officer to say that Aangre has been fatally wounded while trying to escape from custody.  
The Ketchup Effect
 Friends and future seventh-year (upper primary school) students Sofie, Amanda and Emma anxiously await the start of term. This is virtually no major change education-wise, but a social watershed moment when [[clique]]s come into play, more or less serious relationships start being developed, and students, to hear them tell it, leave behind childish things to move into their teens; certainly the three girls are confident in how grown up they now are.  Sofie develops a crush on Mouse, a ninth-year and the local heartthrob. Mouse takes slight notice of her and tells her about an upcoming party. There he tries to hook up Sofie with Sebastian "Sebbe", a relatively quiet and awkward boy from his group. Sebbe and Sofie end up alone and drunk in a bedroom. At the prodding of his friends Sebbe asks for a [[blow job]], which Sofie refuses to do; then Sebbe requests a [[hand job]], which she agrees to do but doesn't know how. He compares the act to emptying a [[ketchup]] bottle. Ideally he would have described it more accurately; in a scene featuring prosthetic frontal male nudity, Sofie grabs his [[penis]] and she, thinking Sebbe meant a glass ketchup bottle, delivers a few sharp strikes with her palm. The situation then breaks up.  After this situation, knowing that Sebbe has been hurt, Sofie leaves the room and gets extremely drunk. Mouse then proceeds to take advantage of what has occurred by assaulting her, even though she is passed out. The guys take pictures of her in compromising positions, but Sebbe holds back from joining in. The next day, there are pictures all over the place of her and Mouse is spreading rumours about her. Every time she has to go past him, he and his friends grope her. To the teachers, it looks like he has a harmless crush on her. Her dad finds out as someone sent him a picture anonymously. He then says that if she didn't dress so provocatively, the guys might not respond in such a crude manner. Sofie leaves and is at the underground station when she runs into Sebbe again. They see Mouse coming and so they run to his house. They have the awkward first conversation, as Sebbe knows more of what went on than she did. They listen to some of his music and he actually starts to hit on her a bit. At one point, they are at the underground station and he compliments her boobs, which she doesn't appreciate and leaves. He realises he's said the wrong thing, but it's too late.  Sofie's best friends don't understand what is going on with her. They hear what other students say about her and also care what others think of them. They therefore dump her as a friend and try to get accepted into the "in crowd" at school, which means becoming friends with Beatrice, the [[Youth subculture|queen bee]]. They get invited to a party at someone's house. Sofie manages to get to where the party is, uninvited. She enters and her friends ignore her. She goes to a window and jumps. After a short period of time, she is seen going to the hospital, with Amanda running after the ambulance before they let her in. Sofie is in the hospital, not paralysed, but unable to move. Her dad arrives at the hospital and when Amanda tries to open up to him, he turns a blind eye and goes straight to his daughter's side. After she returns home, Amanda and Emma repeatedly call her mobile phone, but she refuses to answer it. Eventually they come to her house, where Sofie tells them to "go to hell" because they did not stand by her like good friends should.  Sofie eventually returns to her school, deciding not to transfer, and dressed the way an upper primary school student should. She sees Mouse again and, as a safeguard against future assault, injures him in the groin. He then screams "that fucking whore" and tries to throw a chair at her, but Amanda puts her foot in front of him causing him to slip onto the floor. Everyone in the school is laughing at him and his friends do not stand behind him right away. After Sofie and her friends run away, Sebbe runs after them too, wanting to talk to her. He proceeds to apologise and tells her that he likes her a lot, and wants to be friends with her. He suggests that he cook them dinner at his place, to which she responds "maybe". The final scene shows the two eating dinner, with a bottle of [[ketchup]] on the table.

King Arthur (2004 film)
  [[King Arthur|Arthur]] ([[Clive Owen]]) is portrayed as a [[Roman cavalry]] officer, also known as [[Lucius Artorius Castus|Artorius Castus]], the son of a Roman father and a [[Celts|Celtic]] mother, who commands a unit of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] [[Roman auxiliaries|auxiliary]] [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] in [[Roman Britain|Britain]] at the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|close of the Roman occupation]] in 467 A.D. Arthur is loyal to Rome and a devout [[Catholic]], but follows the teachings of [[Pelagianism]], which many consider heretical. He and his men guard [[Hadrian's Wall]] against the [[Picts|Woads]], a group of [[Britons (historical)|native Britons]] who are rebels against Roman rule, led by the mysterious [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] ([[Stephen Dillane]]).  Arthur and his remaining knights [[Lancelot]] ([[Ioan Gruffudd]]), [[Bors]] ([[Ray Winstone]]), [[Tristan]] ([[Mads Mikkelsen]]), [[Gawain]] ([[Joel Edgerton]]), [[Galahad]] ([[Hugh Dancy]]) and [[Dagonet]] ([[Ray Stevenson]]) expect to be discharged from their service to the Empire after faithfully fulfilling a fifteen-year commitment.  However, on the night when they are to receive their freedom, [[Germanus of Auxerre|Bishop Germanus]] ([[Ivano Marescotti]]) sends them on a final and possibly suicidal mission to rescue an important Roman family living north of Hadrian's Wall. Marius Honorius ([[Ken Stott]]) faces impending capture by the invading [[Saxon people|Saxons]], who are invading from mainland Europe, led by their king [[Cerdic of Wessex|Cerdic]] ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]) and his son [[Cynric]] ([[Til Schweiger]]). According to Germanus, Marius' son Alecto is the [[Pope]]'s favourite godson and may be "destined to be Pope one day". Though angry, the knights follow Arthur once more but only after he and Lancelot argue over Arthur's deeply held beliefs.  At the remote estate, Arthur discovers that Marius has [[Immurement|immured]] pagans, including a Woad named [[Guinevere]] ([[Keira Knightley]]) and a small boy named Lucan. Arthur defies Marius and frees the captives before deciding to take everyone, along with Marius' family, back to Hadrian's Wall.  One night, Guinevere takes Arthur to meet with Merlin, the leader of the Woads and her father. At first, Arthur thinks Guinevere has betrayed him, but Merlin has come in peace. It is revealed in a flashback that Arthur's mother [[Igraine]] had died in a Woad attack when he was a boy. Arthur's famous sword, [[Excalibur]], had belonged to his father, [[Uther Pendragon]], and marked his [[burial mound]]. Arthur had pulled it from the mound in an effort to rescue his mother from a burning building. Merlin suggests an alliance between the Woads and the Sarmatian knights against the invading [[Saxons]].  Marius then betrays the group, takes Lucan hostage and attempts to kill Dagonet but is shot by Guinevere with an arrow. While moving on to the south, Alecto informs Arthur that Germanus executed [[Pelagius]] after being insulted by his teachings of equality. Tristan returns from scouting the area and tells Arthur that a Saxon army is close behind them. The knights stay behind to delay the Saxons and allow the refugees to escape. They soon encounter the Saxons at an ice-covered lake bordered on each side by steep cliffs. Greatly outnumbered, Arthur, Guinevere and the knights attempt to repel them with arrows. The battle is won when Dagonet runs to the middle of the ice and breaks it with an axe at the cost of his life. Many Saxons are also killed, and the rest are forced to turn back.  Upon their return to the wall, Germanus awards the knights their discharge papers and Dagonet is buried. Guinevere attempts to persuade Arthur to remain in Britain and defend the people from the Saxons. The pair have sex in Arthur's room prior to the Saxon army's arrival. Despite Lancelot's pleas, Arthur decides to stay and defend the wall, sending his knights away to live the rest of their lives in freedom.  Now in command of the Woad forces, Arthur prepares to face the Saxon army. As the knights are leading the evacuation, they hear the Saxon drums and turn back to join Arthur.  In the climactic "[[Battle of Badon Hill]]" set just south of Hadrian's Wall, the Woads catapult flaming missiles at the Saxon army. When the hosts meet, Guinevere engages in combat with Cynric. Cerdic fights and kills Tristan before facing off with Arthur. Meanwhile, Cynric disarms Guinevere and is engaged by Lancelot. Cynric shoots Lancelot with a Saxon crossbow. Lancelot then throws his sword into Cynric and kills him. Lancelot dies with Guinevere at his side. Arthur kills Cerdic and the Saxons are defeated.  While he realises that his ideal Rome exists only in his dreams, Arthur despairs over the deaths of his men. The film ends with the marriage of Arthur and Guinevere, after which Merlin proclaims him to be their king. United by their defeat of the Saxons and the retreat of the Romans, Arthur promises to lead the Britons against future invaders. Three horses that had belonged to Tristan, Dagonet and Lancelot run free across the landscape, as the closing narrative from Lancelot describes how fallen knights live on in tales passed from generation to generation.

Kinsey (film)
 Professor [[Alfred Kinsey]] is interviewed about his sexual history. Interspersed with the interview are flashbacks from his childhood and young-adulthood. The young child years show his father, a [[lay minister]], denouncing modern inventions as leading to sexual sin, then in early adolescence, humiliating Kinsey in a store by denouncing its keeper for showing him cigarettes, while his adolescence shows his experiences as a [[Boy Scout]] and a late teenage scene shows Kinsey disappointing his father by his chosen vocational intentions. The adult Kinsey teaches at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] as a professor of biology lecturing on [[gall wasp]]s.  Kinsey falls in love with a student in his class, whom he calls [[Clara McMillen|Mac]], and marries her. Consummation of their marriage is difficult at first, because of a medical problem Mac has that is fixed easily with minor surgery. At the university, Professor Kinsey, who is affectionately called "Prok" by his graduate students, meets with them after hours to offer individual sexual advice.  At a book party celebrating Kinsey's latest publication on [[gall wasp]]s, Kinsey approaches the [[dean of students]] about an open-forum [[sex education]] course as opposed to the anti-sex propaganda taught in a general [[health education]] class. It is approved, but on the grounds that it is open only to teachers, graduate or senior students, and married students. Kinsey begins teaching the sex course to a packed auditorium.  Kinsey continues answering students' questions in personal meetings but his answers are severely limited by the paucity of scientific data about human sexual behavior. This leads Kinsey to pass out questionnaires in his sexual education class from which he learns of the enormous disparity between what society had assumed people do and what their actual practices are. After securing financial support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Kinsey and his research assistants, including his closest assistant, [[Clyde Martin]], travel the country, interviewing subjects about their sexual histories.  As time progresses Kinsey realizes that sexuality within humans, including himself, is a lot more varied than was originally thought. The range of expression he creates becomes known as the [[Kinsey scale]], which ranks overall sexuality from completely [[heterosexual]] to completely [[homosexual]].  The first sexological book Kinsey publishes, which is on the sexual habits of the male, is a large-scale success and a best seller. Kinsey's research turns to women, which is met with more controversy. With the release of the female volume, support for Kinsey declines. [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]] pressures lead the Rockefeller Foundation to withdraw its financial support, lest it be labeled "Communist" for backing the subversion of traditional [[American values]].  Kinsey feels he has failed everyone who has ever been a victim of sexual ignorance. A customs officer is tipped off to an importation of some of Kinsey's research material, which only exacerbates the financial hardship of Kinsey's research organization. Kinsey suffers a heart attack, and is found to have developed an addiction to [[barbiturate]]s. Meeting with other [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]s fails to garner the support needed. Still, Kinsey continues his taking of sex histories.  Returning to the initial interview, Kinsey is asked about love and whether he will ever conduct research on it. He responds that love is impossible to measure and impossible to quantify, but that it is important. Kinsey and Mac pull over to the side of the road for a nature walk. She remarks about a tree that has been there for a thousand years. Kinsey replies that the tree seems to display a strong love in the way its roots grip the earth. The two walk off together, Kinsey remarking "there's a lot of work to do".  
Koma (film)
 The movie begins with a young woman, who attended a wedding party held in a hotel and became drunk, waking up in one of the hotel rooms; only to realize in horror that her kidney has been surgically removed. Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai ([[Andy Hui Chi-On]]), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed. Ling was released uncharged due to insufficient evidence as police believed Ching could be framing her for cheating with her boyfriend. Rather than quickly disappear, Ling starts stalking Ching, apparently jealous that Ching could have everything Ling wanted without an effort while Ling has to fight for it. Ching, at the beginning, sees that as a form of harassment, but soon twists it around and follows Ling instead. Ling seems accepting of this, showing her the darker side of life living as a poor girl compared to Ching's rich-girl background. The two engage in a subtle cat-and-mouse game, and Ching begins to fear for her life when Ling starts making threats to remove her kidney too.  One night, Ching is kidnapped by a mysterious man that seems to be an ally of Ling's. Here, Ching reveals that her kidney is weak, and the man will not be able to sell it for much. She passes out, and wakes to find Ling injured beside her. Ching takes her to the hospital, and it isn't long before Ching finds out that Ling is actually a kind person, more true then the friendships Ching shares with her superficial socialite friends. She learns that Ling has a childhood sweetheart, whose identity she does not reveal.  Ching and Ling then make a deal with the mysterious man so that Ching can get a kidney. However Ching informs the police beforehand, and when they arrive, the man holds Ling hostage. However, Ling supposedly kills the man. Wai begins to suspect Ling, and breaks into her house. Meanwhile, Ching invites Ling to her house where she learns that the man who was killed was none other than Ling's childhood sweetheart. Ling tells her that since she was in need of money for her mother, she and the man planned to make a living selling kidneys. However, because of Ching's 'betrayal', the man killed himself. Ling then discovers that Wai has been searching her house. She holds Wai hostage and asks Ching to come to her workplace, a research center, and give her kidney. Ching, armed with an axe chases Ling, her anger intensifying when she learns that Wai is dead. But Ling suffocates her with plastic.  In the end, Ching wakes up in hospital, where a doctor tells her that she was in critical condition, but saved by a kidney that belonged to the dead at the scene where she was found. She realizes that Ling hacked herself to death to give her the kidney she always wanted. Unable to digest this information, she starts screaming, begging the doctor to remove her kidney, as the camera cuts to a shot of Ching telling Ling they will always be together, and another of Ling lying dead with her voiceover saying, "You'll owe me this forever." There is a final shot of Ching, under the effect of sedatives, falling unconscious.

Kung Fu Hustle
  In Shanghai during the 1930s, Sing and his friend Bone aspire to join the notorious Axe Gang, which rules the town under the leadership of cold-blooded Brother Sum. A flashback shows Sing's story when he was a young boy. He bought a pamphlet from a beggar, who called him "a potential Kung Fu genius", and learned the Buddhist Palm moves. He tried to protect a mute girl named Fong from bullies, but he got beaten as the Buddhist Palm moves didn't work. The humiliating event convinced him that good guys never win, and he is determined to be a relentless criminal to survive in the wicked world.  One day, Sing and Bone visit the Pigsty Alley - the slums of the town. Claiming to be Axe Gang members, the two blackmail the residents there, but the Landlady chases them off. Sing, in an attempt to bluff them, throws a firecracker (which he claims is a signal to summon his gangs), which accidentally blows up the hat of a minor Axe Gang boss passing by. Sing lies and claims that the Pigsty Alley residents threw the firecracker. The gang boss attacks a barber, only to be struck by an unseen assailant. The remaining gangs fire the signal to summon more gangs there. Three of the tenants - Coolie, Tailor, and Donut - reveal themselves to be Kung Fu masters and defeat all of the gangs. Fearing the Axe Gang's retribution, the Landlady quickly evicts the trio.  Sum is furious because the bitter defeat of his gangs results from Sing and Bone's impersonation. After capturing the two, he wants to kill them by throwing axes at them. However, Sing successfully frees themselves just in time with his lock-picking skill, impressing Sum. Sum allows them to join the gang if they kill a person. The two return to the Pigsty Alley to kill the Landlady, but their plan backfires, and Sing barely escapes from the Landlady's wrath. Seeking safety in a traffic pulpit, Sing is surprised as his body rapidly heals from the injuries sustained during the escape. The pain causes him to strike the sides of the pulpit with extreme force, covering the surface with hand-shaped indentations.  Later, Sum hires The Harpists - two mysterious assassins whose weapon is a Guzheng - to kill the three tenants who beat the gang earlier. After the encounter, Coolie is beheaded while Tailor and Donut suffer mortal injuries. The Landlady and her husband - the Landlord - reveal that they too are Kung Fu masters, having gone into self-exile with an oath of non-violence after their son's death. The two defeat the assassins, but Tailor and Donut both end up dead. The Landlords temporarily evacuate the other tenants for their safety.  Meanwhile, Sing attempts to rob an ice cream vendor, who turns out to be Fong - the mute girl of his childhood. She offers him a lollipop, but he knocks it away, ashamed of himself and how far he has fallen. After shooing Bone away, whom he blames for his misfortunes, Sing is brought to Sum. Sum orders Sing to free "the Beast" from an asylum to use against the Pigsty Alley, offering Sing membership of the gang upon completing the mission. Though appearing to be a middle-aged, slovenly, and flippant man, the Beast is quickly shown to be a formidable and ruthless fighter.  When the Landlords arrive at the Axe Gang's casino to settle the score, Sum sends the Beast to fight them. Feigning defeat, he stabs them both with his hidden pins before the three get stuck in a tight hold, immobilizing each other. Sum orders Sing to strike the Landlord to break the stalemate, but Sing has a change of his heart, causing him to strike Sum and the Beast instead. Enraged, the Beast brutally pummels Sing until he is rescued by the Landlords and taken back to the Pigsty Alley. Sum berates the Beast for letting his rivals escape. The Beast kills Sum for disrupting his fight, then takes over the Axe Gang and wages an all-out assault on the Pigsty Alley.  Back at the Alley, Sing undergoes a transformation as a result of the Beast's attack. He fully heals himself, accessing his inner powers and becoming a Kung Fu master instantaneously. He sees to the well-being of the Landlords as the gangs arrive. Sing easily defeats them all before facing the Beast, who uses his Toad style moves to launch Sing high into the sky. While aloft, Sing comes to peace with Buddha and is finally able to deliver the mighty Buddhist Palm moves to subdue the Beast. Accepting his defeat, the Beast breaks down and cries, calling Sing his master.  With the Axe Gang eliminated, the townsfolk enjoy their peaceful lives. Sometime later, Sing and Bone open a candy store (with Fong's lollipop as their logo). When Sing sees Fong outside, he invites her in to share their childhood memories. The beggar that sold the pamphlet to Sing in the past appears on the street. He tries to sell all of his pamphlets to a young boy, whom he calls "a potential Kung Fu genius", as the movie ends.

The professor and the principal were witnesses to Amar and Disha's death. Disha has now returned as a spirit to reclaim her lost love.  Sunita suggests the only way to stop Disha: Manav and Shanti must be married, as this bond is too strong for a spirit to break. The wedding ceremony commences that night, and Disha's spirit attacks, throwing Sunita up, in the air and she falls down on a tree branch which impales her belly, killing her. Manav then agrees to go with Disha's spirit, but says that while the spirit may claim his body, his heart belongs to his wife Shanti. This finally appeases the spirit and liberates it.

Quartered with Engine 33 is Ladder Company 49. On Engine 33, Jack learns the ropes of firefighting. He quickly becomes close friends with his fellow firefighters, including Mike, his Captain at the time. Jack's first fire takes place at a burning vacant [[rowhouse]]. Engine 33 and Ladder 49 respond and are the first companies on the scene. Jack and Mike enter the building with a hose line and tackle the blaze, with Jack on the nozzle of the hose. They quickly and triumphantly extinguish it.  After some time working on Engine 33, Jack arrives at the scene of another vacant rowhouse fire, where a fellow firefighter from Ladder 49, Dennis Gauquin ([[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]]), dies after falling through a roof of the building. Jack decides, although it is more dangerous, to take his friend's position as a "truckie", a [[search and rescue]] member on Ladder 49 by transferring to the Truck.  As the years go by, Jack suffers some traumatic experiences, including rescuing a man from the ledge of a burning high-rise building in [[Downtown Baltimore]], and witnessing another friend and fellow firefighter from Ladder 49, Tommy Drake ([[Morris Chestnut]]), suffer severe burns following a steam explosion at an industrial building who continues firefighting even after sustaining such a terrible injury. He finds the work rewarding, but his wife initially worries about his safety and opposes the change. However, she eventually accepts his new role and even talks him out of taking an administrative position that Mike, who has now become a Deputy Chief, offers him.  One Christmas Eve, Jack and the members of Engine 33 and Ladder 49 respond to a burning apartment building. Jack is able to rescue a young girl trapped in an engulfed apartment, but is briefly trapped himself before being rescued by a fellow Firefighter from Ladder 49, Leonard "Lenny" Richter ([[Robert Patrick]]). Both men receive the department's [[Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor|Medal of Valor]] for their actions.  Back at the grain building fire that opened the film, Jack's fellow firefighters become extremely determined to rescue him, and Jack does his best to reach the only possible safe area Mike tells him about. However, upon reaching that room he sees that the only exit is cut off by raging flames and, out of air and with the heat intensifying, Jack realizes his situation is hopeless. He radios Mike to pull his men back, so no one else will be hurt while trying to rescue him. Mike reluctantly agrees, and Jack accepts his fate to die in the fire, devastating Mike.  At Jack's funeral, Mike delivers an emotional [[eulogy]] in celebration of Jack's life, which inspires a standing ovation from friends and family in attendance. Jack's body is then carried to his resting place, with full honors, on the back of Engine 33 in a typical fireman's funeral procession. The film ends with Mike and the guys en route to a call while the former flashes back to Jack and his fellow firefighters going to fires and a final shot of Mike and Jack coming out of Jack's first ever burning building in triumph.

The battalion has been assigned to secure Point 5179, a crucial vantage point dominating the army's main supply line, the National Highway 1D. The northern side of the mountain is on the Pakistani side of the LoC, the western side has a 1000-foot vertical rock cliff and the southern side has 3&nbsp;km of empty ground with no cover. Therefore, the battalion decides to attack from the eastern side of the mountain. The first part of the assault is successful.

Meanwhile, Romi gets stationed to Kargil as a war correspondent, when her fiancé forbids her to go there, she breaks off the engagement.

The unit sets off on their mission and while moving through a grass field toward the rock cliff, they come under fire. The unit discovers a Pakistani mortar unit in the field and destroys it, but loses their commanding officer and a number of other soldiers. The team's radios are also destroyed, so they cannot communicate with battalion HQ. Out of the initial 12, only 6 remain. They decide to continue with the mission. They successfully scale the cliff and attack the Pakistani position during the night. Their assault is successful although Karan is wounded, and the team loses 3 more men. The next morning, Karan limps to the peak, where he plants the Indian flag and fires a flare, signalling to Col. Damle that they captured the peak.  The film ends with Karan leaving a military hospital and reuniting with his parents and Romi. He then announces his next goal i.e. Romi.

 Mrs. Marva Munson, a strict, religious and elderly widow, meets "Professor" Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr, a southern [[classicist]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] enthusiast who expresses interest in the room she has for rent and asks to use her root cellar for rehearsals of an [[early music]] ensemble he directs, to which she agrees. The fellow musicians in the pretend ensemble are actually a gang of criminals. The band are composed of a dim football player named Lump as the "muscle", the overconfident movie effects technician Garth Pancake as the "jack of all trades" (who suffers from [[irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]]),  the crass and sloppy Gawain McSam as their "inside man", and the Vietnamese, tough-as-nails General as their "tunneling expert" (who hides his chain smoking from the disapproving Mrs. Munson by concealing his cigarette in his mouth). The group of criminals plan to dig a tunnel through the exposed wall in the cellar in order to break into the underground vault for a nearby riverboat [[casino]]. The dirt they remove is taken out at night and tossed off a bridge onto a garbage [[barge]] as it passes below.  A series of mishaps threaten to derail their plan, including "inside man" Gawain losing his janitorial job at the casino, Mrs. Munson's cat Pickles running off with Garth's finger when he accidentally sets a [[plastic explosive]] off in his hand, and a visit from the local sheriff. Nonetheless, the group manages to break through the wall of the vault and snatch the loot. Before the group can get away, Mrs. Munson uncovers the plot and tells Dorr to return the money and go with her to church on Sunday, or face the authorities. Dorr attempts to persuade her otherwise, by claiming that the casino's insurance company will replace the money, resulting in each shareholder only losing a single penny. He also claims he will donate a full share of the stolen funds to [[Bob Jones University]], a Bible college which Mrs. Munson admires, but she insists on her judgment.  The gang decides they have no choice but to murder her. None of them are eager to kill an old woman so they [[Sortition|draw straws]]. The task falls to Gawain but he fails to go through with it after he realizes Mrs. Munson reminds him of his mother. This starts a fight between Garth and Gawain which results in Gawain being fatally shot with his own gun; the group dumps his body off the bridge onto the trash barge. Garth then attempts to steal the entire sum of money and escape with his girlfriend, "Mountain Girl," but the General kills them both with a [[Garrotte|garotte wire]] and discards their bodies onto the barge. After drawing lots again, the General is about to kill Mrs. Munson in her sleep, concealing his cigarette in his mouth as per usual. He is suddenly startled by a [[cuckoo clock]], accidentally swallowing his cigarette.  In a frenzied search for water, The General trips over Mrs. Munson's cat and falls down the stairs to his death.  As Lump and Dorr dispose of The General's body onto the barge, Lump has a change of heart and tells Dorr he wants to do what Mrs. Munson says. When Dorr refuses, Lump attempts to shoot him with a revolver but the chamber is empty; he peers down the barrel and accidentally shoots himself with the round that was in the next chamber, falling off the bridge onto the barge. Dorr, now alone, pauses to admire a passing raven and recite poetry until the raven dislodges the head of a crumbling grotesque on top of the bridge. The head falls, knocking Dorr over the railing, and his cape gets caught on the ironwork and strangles him to death. As the barge passes under the bridge, the fabric tears and he too falls onto it.  Finding the stolen money in her basement, Mrs. Munson believes that the criminals have fled and left it behind. She informs the police about the money, but they think she is insane and tell her to keep it; she decides to donate it to Bob Jones. The movie closes by showing Pickles dropping Garth's severed finger onto the barge.

Layer Cake (film)
  XXXX, a 30-something man, is a London underworld criminal who has established himself as one of the biggest cocaine suppliers in the city, with legitimate cover. Considering himself a businessman and patience as a virtue, XXXX leaves the darker aspects of the business to his henchman Morty, a man having recently ended a 10-year prison sentence for murder. Once he has earned enough to be financially secure, XXXX plans to retire.  On the evening XXXX intends to set these plans into motion, his sponsor and supplier Jimmy Price tells him to do two favours. The first is to track down Charlie, the teenage daughter of Jimmy's associate Eddie Temple, who has fled a rehabilitation centre along with her drug-addicted boyfriend Kinky. XXXX decides to enlist two [[confidence trick|con men]], Cody and Tiptoes, to find them. They find the boyfriend dead and Charlie apparently kidnapped, although no ransom has been demanded.  The second favour is to organise the purchase and distribution of one million [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]] tablets from a low-level gangster who styles himself "The Duke". Unbeknownst to XXXX, the pills had been stolen from a gang of Serbian war criminals based in the Netherlands, a massive drug production outfit with an honour-avenging bent.  XXXX encounters the Duke's out-of-touch nephew Sidney at a bar and becomes attracted to his disillusioned girlfriend Tammy. XXXX tries to broker the sale of the ecstasy pills to Liverpool gangsters Trevor and Shanks but they refuse, knowing where the E comes from and that the Serbs have sent an assassin, known as Dragan, to find the pills and kill the thieves. Duke had mentioned XXXX's name to the Serbs, so he too is in danger. Members of the Duke's gang soon start turning up dead and the Duke himself goes missing.  XXXX arranges a tryst with Tammy but before it can be consummated, he is kidnapped by henchmen of Eddie Temple. Eddie informs him that Jimmy Price has recently lost £13 million in a failed investment in Africa and wanted Charlie as a hostage until Eddie got his money back. Jimmy was also hoping to sell the pills to recoup his losses; Eddie plays XXXX a recording which reveals that Jimmy has been an informant for [[Scotland Yard]] for years and intends to betray XXXX to the police as soon as the deal is done, to gain clemency and take XXXX's wealth. Eddie demands that XXXX sells the pills to him instead.  A furious XXXX shoots and kills Jimmy at his home but does so with a gun that Gene, Jimmy's henchman and his main liaison with XXXX, had used to commit murder, putting Gene under police attention. XXXX discovers that his accountant, who operated his legitimate front and was referred to him by Jimmy Price, has stolen all of his money and disappeared. Gene and Morty suspect XXXX of foul play; after being shown the evidence that Jimmy is a grass, the pair acknowledge XXXX as the new acting boss and show him the corpse of the Duke. Gene killed him along with girlfriend and crime-partner, Slasher, when the latter threatened to alert the police about the pills.  XXXX tips the police off to the Duke's hideout, who raid it. XXXX is present during the raid to feign purchasing the pills from the Duke's crew and Dragan, who has been following XXXX, witnesses the raid from afar as the police confiscate the drugs and XXXX and Duke's surviving crew escape. XXXX has arranged for Cody and Tiptoes to infiltrate the police and con the unit out of the pills. XXXX delivers the severed head of the Duke to Dragan as a peace offering, who reports to his Serbian boss that the police have seized the drugs. Cody and Tiptoes return the drugs to XXXX in exchange for a fee and XXXX in turn looks to sell them to Eddie Temple as planned. During the handover at the latter's bonded warehouse, Eddie's henchmen rob his crew of the drugs at gunpoint. To end XXXX's faux assignment given by Jimmy, Eddie reveals that his daughter Charlie's boyfriend died at his men's hands; she was recovered before Jimmy Price ever sent XXXX to look for her and Eddie had her back in rehab all along.  To mollify XXXX, Eddie gives him a "Welcome to the Layer Cake"; a membership to the [[Stoke Park, Buckinghamshire|Stoke Park Country Club]] of which he is (and Jimmy was) a member. Expecting betrayal, XXXX arranges for Trevor, Shanks and young Dizzy to steal the drugs back from Eddie's men. The gang assembles for lunch at the Stoke Park Club, honouring their new boss XXXX who sticks to his plan for retirement. When leaving the club with Tammy, mentally running through the names of his fellow murdered businessmen he hopes to avoid joining, XXXX is shot by a heart-broken Sidney. XXXX collapses bleeding and he lies twitching on the front steps while contemplating his possible death.  
The Last Shot
 [[FBI]] agent Joe Devine ([[Alec Baldwin]]) has been assigned to come up with an elaborate scheme to take down infamous mob boss [[John Gotti]].

He finds unsuspecting wannabe screenwriter/director Steven Schats ([[Matthew Broderick]]), who'd do just about everything to get the chance to direct a feature. Schats falls for the pitch, but what Devine doesn't tell Schats is that the movie will never be made.   Though Schats' screenplay is titled ''Arizona'', and the main character is supposed to euthanize herself in a [[Hopi]] cave at the end of the movie, he is so desperate to make the film that Devine convinces him to film it in [[Rhode Island]]. Devine's target there is Tommy Sanz, who muscles in on the production. Devine records Sanz accepting a bribe for the [[International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters|Teamsters']] approval of the production. Instead of ending the investigation at that point as the FBI expects, Devine plows ahead with the film production, because he has fallen in love with the movie business.  Devine's mania leads him to pitch a three picture deal to his FBI superiors. He is convinced that he can ensnare more mobsters with a similar scheme, while also producing actual films. The FBI agrees to the idea, and Devine throws himself into production full tilt. Just as filming begins, the FBI arrests Gotti and puts an end to the production, against Devine's wishes. The film jumps forward two years to the premiere of a movie based on the sting operation. Schats is working as a manager at a movie theater. Devine visits him and apologizes. He reveals that he has been working on a screenplay, and Schats gets excited about the pitch.

Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events
 In the opening, the narrator, who identifies himself as Lemony Snicket, while typing on a type-writer, tells the audience the story of the Baudelaire children.  Fourteen-year-old inventor Violet Baudelaire, her twelve-year-old brother Klaus, and their baby sister Sunny are orphaned when a fire burns down their house and kills their parents. Mr. Poe, the family's banker, manages their fortune and leaves them in the care of their closest relative Count Olaf, who is only interested in obtaining their fortune despite Violet not being the [[Age of majority|legal age of eighteen]] to obtain it. He also forces them to work through grueling house chores and belittles them.  The day Olaf obtains full custody, he pretends to go into a store claiming to buy soda, but Violet notices the car is parked directly on train tracks with a train heading towards them. They manage to build a device to turn the switch controlling the tracks so that they are not hit. Mr. Poe arrives and takes them away when he sees Sunny in the front seat, believing her to have been "driving." Olaf initially says farewell, but threatens them that they will always be found.  The orphans are then taken to their uncle Dr. Montgomery, a kind, caring [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] who is planning to take the children with him to [[Peru]]. However, Olaf arrives in disguise as an Italian scientist named Stephano. The orphans attempt to warn Montgomery, and he believes to an extent. Montgomery believes Stephano is after a large [[viper]] in his museum, which despite its looks, is actually very gentle. He is discovered dead shortly after, and the orphans cannot prove that Stephano is responsible for Montgomery's death. They are almost taken back to him when Sunny proves the viper's innocence when it plays with her, disproving its hostile nature. Stephano flees the scene, ridding himself of all evidence of his disguise as the police pursue him.  Mr. Poe leaves them with their Aunt Josephine, a kindly woman who is nonetheless obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location: Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town - ultimately destroying the house - but the children manage to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract [[leech]]es due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose Leeches after she annoys him by correcting his speech.  A play is soon planned, titled "The Marvelous Marriage" that involves Olaf and Violet as the leads: a groom and a bride. Klaus's suspicions reveal that Olaf is planning to take advantage of the play to marry Violet in reality in a desperate attempt to get the fortune. Unless Violet follows her lines or finds a loophole, Sunny, who is being held hostage in a cage, will be dropped to her death.  Klaus manages to escape and finds a hidden tower in Olaf's house, with a large lens which, if positioned correctly, can focus the rays of the sun. He discovers this way that it was Olaf who set the fire to their old house. He uses this window to burn the marriage certificate before the marriage is officially complete, leading to Olaf's arrest. However, a jury of his peers overturn his sentence and Olaf vanishes.  Violet, Klaus and Sunny are taken to visit their old home one last time. As they observe the burned remains, a letter lost in the mail finally arrives, and inside is a [[Telescope|spyglass]] announcing their family's secret society. Though their future is unclear, despite the children's misfortune, they still have each other, thus making them "Very Fortunate Indeed".   In the end, Snicket concludes the story, finishes typing the book, and prepares to publish it.

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
 While oceanographer Steve Zissou is working on his latest documentary at sea, his best friend and chief diver, Esteban du Plantier, is eaten by a creature Zissou describes as a "jaguar shark". For his next project, Zissou is determined to document the shark's destruction.  The crew aboard Zissou's aging [[research vessel]] ''Belafonte'' includes his estranged wife Eleanor, chief strategist and financial backer; Pelé dos Santos, a safety expert and Brazilian guitarist who sings [[David Bowie]] songs in Portuguese; and Klaus Daimler, the German first mate who views Zissou and Esteban as father figures. Minor crew members include Vikram Ray, cameraman; Bobby Ogata, frogman; Vladimir Wolodarsky, physicist and soundtrack composer; Renzo Pietro, sound man; and Anne-Marie Sakowitz, script girl. Also included is a recent group of unpaid interns from the University of North Alaska. However, the "Team Zissou" venture has hit a decline; they have not released a successful documentary in nine years.   Ned Plimpton is a longtime Zissou fan whose mother had recently died, and he believes that Zissou is his father. After they meet at Zissou's latest premiere, Ned takes leave from his job as an airline pilot in Kentucky to join his crew. As Oseary Drakoulias, Zissou's producer, can not find anyone to finance their latest documentary, Ned offers his inheritance. Eleanor feels her husband is taking advantage of Ned and leaves. A pregnant reporter, Jane Winslett-Richardson, comes to chronicle the voyage. Both Ned and Zissou are infatuated with Jane, and a rivalry develops between them. Klaus becomes envious of the attention Zissou pays to Ned.   On their mission to find the jaguar shark, the ''Belafonte'' steals tracking equipment from a remote station owned by Alistair Hennessey, a more successful oceanographer and Zissou's nemesis. They then sail into unprotected waters and are attacked by Filipino pirates, who steal Ned's money and kidnap Bill Ubell, a "[[Corporate bond|bond company]] stooge" assigned to the project. They are then rescued by Hennessey and towed to [[Ponza|Port-au-Patois]]. Sakowitz, along with all but one of the interns, jump ship once they reach port.   Zissou convinces Eleanor to rejoin the ''Belafonte'', and then leads the crew on a rescue mission. They track Bill to an abandoned hotel on a remote island, saving him along with Hennessey, whom the pirates have also kidnapped. Ned and Zissou then make one last search for the shark in the ship's helicopter, but the aircraft malfunctions and they crash. Ned dies from his injuries and is [[buried at sea]]. Prior to Ned's death, Eleanor revealed to Jane that Zissou is sterile, therefore Ned could not have been his son.  Zissou finally tracks down the shark in a [[submersible]] but he decides not to kill it, both because of its beauty and not having any more dynamite. At the premiere of the finished documentary (which is dedicated to Ned), Zissou receives a standing ovation while waiting outside the theater for the premiere to finish. The crew returns triumphantly to the ship the next day.  
The Libertine (2004 film)
 John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester (Depp), delivers a prologue of themes of his fondness for drink, his sexual proclivities, and his disdain for his audience.  King Charles II (Malkovich) retracts his banishment of the earl as he has need of him in the House of Lords. Back in London, Rochester finds his "Merry Gang" friends, [[George Etherege]] (Hollander) and [[Charles Sackville]] (Vegas), in a bawdy house. Rochester encounters on the street the thief Alcock (Coyle). Impressed by his dishonesty, Rochester hires him as his [[Valet#Domestic valet|gentleman]]. The Merry Gang introduce to Rochester who will be its newest member, 18-year-old Billy Downs (Friend). Rochester warns Downs, "Young man, you will die of this company."  The Merry Gang attend a play where the actress [[Elizabeth Barry]] (Morton) is booed off the stage, refusing to participate in a [[curtain call]], and is fired. Rochester is taken with Barry, secures her re-employment with the theatre company, and undertakes to coach her in acting. Barry's acting improves dramatically and she delivers a brilliant performance in her next production. The King approaches Barry to spy on Rochester as to the progress of the intended tribute to the French Ambassador.  Charles, in need of money from France, asks Rochester to write a play in honour of the French Ambassador's visit. The king requests it be a "testament" to his reign. Rochester writes ''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery]]'', a scathing satire of the king's reign, which he claims is "a testament to Charles" — just what the king had asked for. The play involves vulgar language, simulated sex acts, and Rochester portraying the king being serviced. At the premiere, the king interrupts the play and on the stage confronts Rochester. Downs is injured in a sword fight outside the home of a Constable; Rochester backs away from his dying friend, whispering, "I told you."  Hiding from the king in the English countryside and sick with symptoms of [[syphilis]], Rochester peddles phony [[gynaecology|gynaecological]] "treatments" for women, including the selling of "potions" made from Alcock's [[urine]]. Rochester's face has become disfigured by syphilitic [[gummata]], which he hides beneath a mask. Charles eventually tracks down Rochester, but decides that the worst punishment possible is to simply "let you be you." Rochester returns to his estate and wife, Elizabeth (Pike), admitting to having been constantly for five years under the influence of "the drink". Elizabeth declares her love for him.  Charles' choice of heir, his [[Roman Catholic]] brother [[James, Duke of York]], leads to a showdown with [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] with the [[Exclusion Bill]] that would deny James the throne. Rochester uses [[Foundation (cosmetics)|make-up]] and a silver nose tip to hide the indications of syphilis as he enters the House of Lords hobbling on two canes. His denunciation in the Lords of the bill ingratiates the appreciation of the king when it is defeated. When Rochester reveals his desire to have wanted Barry as his wife she reveals she never had the desire to be the wife of anyone, she had a daughter by him that he was unaware of, and this daughter is called Elizabeth.  Rochester returns to his estate where he is bedridden in the care of Elizabeth, his mother, a priest summoned to "bring God to him" as she did not want Rochester to die as an atheist, and Alcock. Before he dies, Rochester asks the priest to recite from [[Book of Isaiah]], chapter 53; he also asks his wife to retell the story of how he had abducted her when she was 18 years old and they fell in love. Rochester's death is followed by a scene of Elizabeth Barry is playing the role of his wife in ''[[The Man of Mode]]'', the play about him written by his friend Etheridge.  The [[epilogue]] is Rochester slipping into the darkness of an increasingly fading candlelight, asking "Do you like me now?"

 As [[Timon and Pumbaa]] watch [[The Lion King|the original film]] in a theater, Timon decides to fast-forward to his scenes. Pumbaa's protest over this eventually prompts Timon to share his backstory.  Timon is a social outcast in his [[meerkat]] colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands due to frequently messing things up by accident. Though he is unconditionally supported by his mother [[List of The Lion King characters#Ma|Ma]], Timon dreams for more in life than his colony's bleak existence hiding from predators.

This becomes the last straw for the colony, prompting Timon to leave to find a better life. He meets [[Rafiki (The Lion King)|Rafiki]], who teaches him about "[[Hakuna Matata]]" and advises him to "look beyond what you see". Timon takes the advice literally and observes Pride Rock in the distance. Believing Pride Rock to be his paradise home, Timon ventures there and encounters Pumbaa on his way. The two quickly form a bond and Pumbaa accompanies Timon.  The pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of [[Simba]] to the Pride Lands' animals. As they make their way through the crowd of onlookers, Pumbaa explosively [[Flatulence|passes gas]], causing nearby animals to faint but prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Following this, Timon and Pumbaa make multiple attempts to set up homes throughout the Pride Lands, but wind up being forced away every time after witnessing several events from the original film, such as Simba singing "[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]", Mufasa's fight with the Hyenas, and [[List of The Lion King characters#Scar|Scar]]'s conspiring with the hyenas. Eventually, the pair are caught in the wildebeest stampede that killed Mufasa in the original film, and are thrown off a waterfall. Exhausted, Timon decides to give up, until Pumbaa discovers a luxurious green jungle. The pair finally settle there with the philosophy of "Hakuna Matata".

Timon indulges in the jungle's luxuries by himself, but [[loneliness]] starts to overcome him. Rafiki appears again and helps Timon [[Epiphany (feeling)|realize]] that his true Hakuna Matata is with the ones he loves, prompting Timon to take off after Simba, Nala, and Pumbaa.  Timon catches up and reconciles with Pumbaa, before they journey onward to Pride Rock. After helping Simba and Nala distract the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa run into Ma and Uncle Max, who came looking for Timon. Timon proposes that they all help Simba by getting rid of the hyenas. Whilst Simba battles Scar, Ma and Uncle Max are directed to construct a series of tunnels beneath the hyenas, and Timon and Pumbaa use various tactics to distract them while the tunnel is being made. When the tunnels are finished, Max knocks down the sticks, breaking the ground under the hyenas. However, the last few get stuck, prompting Timon to dive underground and break them himself. The cave-in commences, and the hyenas are ejected through the tunnels. Immediately afterwards, Scar is defeated by Simba.

He's having an affair with Rita ([[Silvina Bosco]]), an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend Estella ([[Melina Petriella]]), and fantasizes of emigrating to [[Poland]], where his family came from during [[World War II]].  He carps at his grandmother (Rosita Londner) for immigration documents that will support his claim to Polish citizenship as he wants to become "European."  This forces his grandmother to remember her memories of [[Holocaust]] Poland.  Ariel also visits the rabbi in order to get documents. One of them has been cut in a corner and the rabbi explains: "So, no one can use it again." - "Oh! Like circumcision!", Ariel retorts. Like Woody Allen in "Deconstructed Harry", Burman takes an ironic stand against circumcision.  At one point, the shop owners organize a race against another group of merchants.  They hope to earn a cash purse and fix up the exterior of their gallery and install air conditioning.  Other characters include: a large Italian family whose noisy arguments drown out the radios in their radio repair shop; a quiet [[Korea]]n couple who run a ''[[feng shui]]'' boutique; Mitelman (Diego Korol) who runs a travel agency, but which is really a front for currency smuggling; and a solitary stationer named Osvaldo (Isaac Fajm).  Right before the big race his father suddenly shows up in Buenos Aires. His mother confesses to Ariel that his father left Argentina and the family because she had a brief affair with Osvaldo, the retailer next door. It was a one time thing and did not mean anything but it ruined the marriage.  Ariel finally gets to hear his father's side of the story: he could not get over the fact that his mother had betrayed him with Osvaldo. Elías can finally enfold his son in a long-overdue embrace, and Ariel embraces his father as well in the closing moments of the film.  The grandmother sings a [[klezmer]] song over the closing credits.

While in a restaurant, his mother reveals to him that she has been unfaithful to her husband many times with his knowledge and feels no shame about it. She then insists that her son accepts her promiscuous ways.  Soon after this, Pierre finds a closet full of his father's pornography. His reaction is to furiously masturbate and then to urinate on the magazine pages. However, there are several far more shocking surprises in store for Pierre.  Hélène encourages her uninhibited sex buddy, Réa (Joana Preiss), to take her son's virginity. She does so but in public and on a concrete floor at Gran Canaria's Yumbo Centrum, a popular shopping and nightlife complex.

Machuca
 The film is shown from the perspective of Gonzalo Infante, an 11 year upper middle-class Chilean boy, during a time period in which the lower classes demand more rights and fundamental change and have won the recent democratic election. Many from the middle and upper class, including member's of Gonzalo's own family, grow fearful of the [[Socialist Party of Chile|socialist movement]] and plot against the country's elected president, [[Salvador Allende]].  Gonzalo's father, while sympathetic to the poor and not part of the right-wing movement, wants to leave the country to Italy, where he frequently travels for work at the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]. Gonzalo's mother, Maria Luisa Infante, is having an affair with a wealthy older [[Argentines|Argentinian]], Roberto Ochagavia, who gives Gonzalo gifts to keep him quiet. Gonzalo is sometimes bullied by his sister's boyfriend, who is a violent anti-Allende right-winger who uses [[nunchaku]]s to intimidate people. The family often buys products off of the black market, due to rationing and shortages.  Gonzalo attends a private school where the strong-willed school principal, Father McEnroe, is developing a [[social integration]] project, which is seen by some parents as left leaning rather than a work of the Christian faith. When five poor students are admitted to Gonzalo's class, Gonzalo becomes friends with Pedro Machuca, one of the new students, after he refuses to participate in bullying started by other pupils. Gonzalo accompanies Pedro and his neighbor Silvana, as they sell flags and cigarettes at demonstrations: first nationalistic flags at a demonstration of right-wing nationalists, then flags of the red brigades at a leftists rally in support of the government. Silvana calls Gonzalo a snob and strawberry-face, but eventually befriends him and they even exchange first kisses.   Pedro Machuca visits Gonzalo's home and is impressed at Gonzalo having a separate room with toys and a closet full of his own clothing, but also witnesses the tensions and cruelty latent in Gonzalo's family. When Gonzalo visits the shantytown dwelling of Pedro, he is appalled at the conditions. The friendship of the two mirrors the friendship between the [[Lone Ranger]] and the Indian Tonto in Gonzalo's favorite comic-book series. Gonzalo knows that he is acting against expectations, mentioning that his favorite comic is unbelievable because "Indians and white men do not team up."  As political unrest in Chile grows, the boys' friendship begins to be tested.  Pedro's drunk father taunts him, telling him that while Gonzalo and his friends will grow up wealthy, he will be stuck in the lower class cleaning toilets. The wealthy parents of the students at St. Patrick's school are divided on the issue of the new poor students. While some, such as Sr. Infante, support Father McEnroe's policies, many, including Sra. Infante, think that the classes should be segregated. The school farm run by the students is a failure and jeopardizes the financial basis for the inclusion of poorer students. At an [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] political rally, Gonzalo's mother sticks up for Silvana when Silvana is threatened by the group Gonzalo's mother is with--until Silvana spits on their car in retaliation and calls Gonzalo’s mother a whore. As the class tensions increase, the friends get into a fight and are driven apart.  Gonzalo's family witnesses the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-backed [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|military coup of 1973]], where Salvador Allende commits suicide and [[Augusto Pinochet]] takes over. After Father McEnroe is removed from the now militarized school, he visits the worship performed by a new priest, consumes the [[sacramental bread]] to save it from [[Host desecration|desecration]] and declares the ground to be desecrated. Machuca leads the other students in honoring the priest and is expelled. Gonzalo tries to visit the shantytown where Pedro and Silvana live but arrives to find it being destroyed by the soldiers. He then witnesses a soldier murdering Silvana.  Himself being dragged into the conflict, Gonzalo convinces a soldier that he is not from the shantytown due to his nice clothing and fair complexion, and is forced to abandon his friend. He returns to his family's new home, which is now even more opulent thanks to his mother's lover and the new redistribution of wealth under the new government. He remains distraught over the events he has witnessed as he remembers his friends as he stares down at the ruins of their homes. The [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|17 years of Chilean dictatorship]], in which 250,000 Chileans were detained, have begun.  
The Machinist
 Trevor Reznik ([[Christian Bale]]) is a [[machinist]] whose insomnia has led to his becoming [[Emaciation|emaciated]]. His appearance and behavior keep his coworkers away, and they eventually turn against him when he is involved in an accident which causes his coworker, Miller, to lose his left arm. Trevor, who was distracted by an unfamiliar co-worker named Ivan, is blamed for the accident. No one at the factory knows of Ivan and there are no records of him. Trevor seems to find peace only with Stevie, a prostitute with genuine affection for him, and with Maria, a waitress at an airport diner he frequents. He is haunted by brief flashes of recurring imagery, and things such as his car cigarette lighter take on a [[Panphobia|menacing air]]. A mysterious series of post-it notes appear on his refrigerator, depicting [[Hangman (game)|a game of hangman]].  These vague incidents send him further into paranoia, but he nonetheless attempts to establish a relationship with Maria. Meeting her at an amusement park, Trevor goes with her son Nicholas on a fun house ride called "Route 666," whose flashing lights cause Nicholas to suffer an [[Photosensitive epilepsy|epileptic]] seizure. No longer able to think clearly, Trevor suspects that the bizarre events are [[Gaslighting|a concerted effort to drive him insane]]. These ideas are fed to him in small random clues. One of them is a picture of Ivan fishing with Trevor's coworker Reynolds, which he discovers in Ivan's wallet when Ivan leaves it unattended in a pub. Another near-accident at work causes Trevor to lash out in rage at his co-workers; as a result, he is immediately fired. Increasingly distracted and alienated, Trevor forgets to pay his utility bills and his electricity is disconnected. A dark, viscous liquid begins trickling out of the freezer, coating the fridge door with streaks of what appears to be blood.  After several attempts to confront Ivan, Trevor tries to trace his license plate. He follows Ivan's car to read its license plate, but runs out of gas during the pursuit. When a [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] clerk insists that personal information cannot be released unless a crime has been committed, Trevor throws himself in front of a car in order to accuse Ivan of committing a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]. He files a police report with Ivan's plate number on it, only to be baffled when he is told that the car in question is his own; he had reported the vehicle totaled one year ago. He flees from the suspicious policemen and goes to Stevie, who clothes and washes him, but he finds the photo of Ivan and Reynolds framed in her home and accuses her of conspiring against him. Confused, Stevie says the picture is of Reynolds and Trevor, but he refuses to look at it and is thrown out after a verbal conflict. He goes to the airport diner, but is told by an unfamiliar waitress they've never had an employee named Maria. The waitress at the counter tells Trevor she has served him every day for a year, and in all that time he spoke so little that she began to think he was a [[muteness|mute]].  In the film's climax, Trevor sees Ivan take Nicholas into Trevor's apartment and, fearing the worst, sneaks inside. Nicholas is nowhere to be seen and doesn't respond to Trevor's calls. He confronts Ivan in the bathroom and kills him after a struggle. He pulls back the shower curtain, only to find the bathtub empty. He goes to the refrigerator and opens it to find rotting fish and other spoiled food tumble out. His mind then flashes back to the fishing photo, which actually shows a healthy Trevor with Reynolds, just as Stevie claimed, and Trevor's hallucinating Ivan in it. The scene returns to one which occurred during the opening credits, in which he tries to dispose of someone's corpse - presumably Ivan's - by rolling it in a rug and casting it into the ocean. When the rug unravels, there is nothing inside. Ivan, alive as ever, appears holding a flashlight and laughs.  Trevor stares into a mirror at home, repeating the words, "I know who you are." It is revealed that one year prior, Trevor ran over and killed a boy identical to Nicholas after taking his eyes off the road to use the car's cigarette lighter, which was witnessed by the boy's mother, identical to Maria. He decided to drive away, and the resulting guilt became the deep-seated cause of his insomnia, emaciation and repressed memory. Ivan was a figment of Trevor's imagination and a manifestation of himself before the accident. He fills the missing letters of the hangman note to spell "killer." He briefly considers going to the airport and escaping, but instead drives to police headquarters, signifying his "road to salvation," a recurring theme in the film. He is accompanied by a silent but encouraging Ivan, who bids him an approving farewell outside the station. At the police station's front desk, he confesses to the hit and run. Two police officers escort Trevor to a cell, where he states his wishes to sleep and does so for the first time in a year.  
Madhouse (2004 film)
  The film opens with a flashback depicting a young boy escaping from Cunningham Hall, a mental facility. The boy escapes through his window and manages to run into nearby woods, where two of the facility's staff pursue him. The boy escapes into an open area, when a car emerges from the darkness and runs him over, sending him tumbling into bushes. A man exits the car and looks on before returning to the car, assuming the young boy dead.  Clark Stevens ([[Joshua Leonard]]), a psychiatric intern, has come to Cunningham Hall Mental Facility to train before he can graduate to medical school. Inside, he meets some of the patients (with one convincingly pretending to be a doctor working there) and is welcomed by nurse Betty. Betty gives him keys to the facility and a walkie-talkie for communication, then takes him to the person in charge of the facility, Dr. Franks ([[Lance Henriksen]]). On the way however, they are suddenly interrupted by one of the patients named Carl, who claims that he "shouldn't be here" and patients aren't allowed to go home when they're mentally stable. Betty shrugs the accusations off and pushes Carl away.  In Dr. Franks' empty office, Clark examines his bookcase whilst waiting for Franks to arrive. He finds a book titled "Psychology and the Paranormal," which strikes his interest. He reads the first page, which implies connections between mental stability and the paranormal. Before he continues reading, Franks arrives. Clark and Frank talk about the facility and its patients, with Clark suggesting some improvements for the building, but Franks replies stern and bluntly. At this point, Dr. Morton and Dr. Douglas enter, wanting to meet Clark.  Clark now meets nurse Sara ([[Jordan Ladd]]) in the cafeteria, and she takes Clark on a tour around the facility. As they leave, mental patient Alice ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) sits watching a window, where she sees flashes of a demonic-looking boy. Sara continues the tour with Clark, but come across head nurse Hendricks, who talks to Sara privately. Whilst they're talking, Clark examines a flickering light when a mental patient claims "there's something up there." Sara returns and continues the tour, and finishes it off by taking him to the basement cells, where they hold the patients that are potential murderers and rapists - a place nicknamed "Madhouse."  These basement cells are supervised by security guard Wallace, who grants Clark and Sara access to the Madhouse. However, one of the patients seems to have a paranoid fit, and starts smashing glass with his head. Sara calls Drake, another security guard, to come down and help. This scares Clark, who backs up against a wall and is grabbed by a patient, who is holding a sharp shard of glass, trying to self-harm and bleed over Clark. Luckily, Drake arrives and beats the patient, with Clark telling him to cease because the patient didn't hurt him. Drake does indeed stop the beating and leaves, saying "let's hope he gets it right next time."  Later at night, Clark is in his room, when he witnesses a boy pass the bathroom door. Clark investigates, but no-ones there. Over the walkie-talkie, Clark overhears a report about a "situation in the rec room," and goes to help. Instead, he spies on the situation from the door and watches Hendricks badly treat Alice with a stun gun over medication. She continues shocking Alice with the stun-gun, but Alice is saved by Carl, who treats her sympathetically and takes her to her room.  Clark makes his way back to his room, but finds the boy from before in the hallway. Clark gives chase, and ends up at the Madhouse, where he finds no-one at the supervision desk and the door to Madhouse open. Clark enters to investigate, but finds nothing. However, Dr. Morton finds him and they talk about the mysterious boy. Morton recalls a patient from Cell #44, who escaped but apparently died - however, Morton believes him to still be alive and back in the facility. Before he can continue, Hendricks arrives and gives Clark the task of cleaning up a mess in the rec room.  Sometime later, Clark confronts Franks about the boy. Franks denies that anyone could be running around un-supervised. Clark retells the Cell #44 story to Franks and notices a book titled "Ghosts and Hauntings" on the desk, which Franks hastily removes. When Clark leaves the office, Hendricks arrives and argues with Franks. Clark overhears some of the argument, such as Hendricks shouting "[she] knows." Soon, Sara arrives and they discuss Franks selection of weird books before Sara is requested at the nurses station for night duty.  In the nurses station, Sara and Hendricks hear a mysterious sound. Hendricks, equipped with her stun-gun, investigates the source and is led into dark stairway, when someone in a cloak attacks her and renders her unconscious. She wakes up strapped to an electric chair, and the cloaked figure plays loud music whilst torturing her with the stun gun. She begs him to stop, and the figure disappears. However, a few moments later, he pops back up from behind the chair and continues the torture - eventually killing Hendricks.  The next day, Hendrick's body is found and is taken away. Franks assures everyone he'll "seriously review the safety protocol" to prevent this happening again. The staff are then assigned patients to interview about the murder, with Clark being assigned to the Madhouse with Drake. Drake, after getting angry at one of the patients, leaves. Clark, alone, only has a few more to get through and goes to Cell #44, where a patient hides in the darkness and refuses to talk. Clark goes away, but then the patient - who identifies himself as Ben London - starts to talk cryptically and sometimes in riddles. He tells Clark that if he's looking for the murderer, "the top of the food chain is a good place to start," which Clark infers to be Franks.  Sometime later, Clark asks Grace (the nurse in charge of medicine) what Ben's prescription is and what it's for. Grace replies that everyone in the Madhouse are on the same drugs, and Clark takes a bottle for examination. Outside, Clark sits watching the patients play, when he sees the mysterious young boy from before playing with a ball. Carl then joins him and recalls his past to Clark of how he ended up in the facility. Clark says that Carl shouldn't be in the facility anymore, and Carl agrees, "but the day [he] leaves here is the day [he] dies." Sometime later, Clark attempts to confront Sara with some questions about the Facility, but is unable due to loud screams coming from a nurse. When Clark and Sarah enter the room, they find Carl's corpse hanging from some sheets.  Alice is dancing around the body and shouts to Clark "This is the only way you get out of here Clark! Carl knew and now he's free!"  The death is filed as a suicide, but Clark is suspicious about it.  In a meeting later, led by Clark and Sara, Alice talks about seeing the young boy. Clark is intrigued and Alice continues, saying the boy makes sure that she "never forgets what madness feels like." After the meeting, on his way back to his room, Clark comes across Drake having sex with a patient in an open room. After Drake notices him looking, Clark leaves. Waking up the next morning, Clark gets a phone call from Sara that Drake is the murderer and has been arrested by the police.  Later, Clark and Sara are in a room together where they try to solve what is happening in the Madhouse.  They begin to put the pieces together, but put the mystery on hold as they spend an intimate night with each other.  Taking Ben's advice, Clark does some research on Dr. Frank as well as the medication that they hand out.  It is revealed that Dr. Frank has been using placebos on the patients, and that the reason none of them are getting better is because Dr. Frank was embezzling all the funding for himself.  Meanwhile, the same apparition that killed Nurse Hendricks kills Dr. Morton by cleaving the upper part of his head off with an axe.  The next night, Clark confronts Ben again, and again, is only greeted by cryptic answers.  Clark tells him that he is going to call the authorities about the placebos Monday morning, but still needs to find out how to stop what's killing everyone until then.  The only piece of information the man gives Clark is "The truth is right in front of you."  Clark goes to Sara with what he knows, and she gives him some coffee to drink filled with sleeping pills.  While dreaming, Clark is haunted by the voice of the cryptic inmate and visions of the little boy.  The dreams make Clark realize that it was Sara doing all the killings.  Clark wakes up and fights the effects of the drugs long enough to get back to the Madhouse to talk to Ben.  He arrives at Cell 44 and asks Ben to show his face. He tells him that he'll be freed if he does so. Ben takes off the mask that was concealing his face to reveal himself as the little boy.  Shocked,  Clark stands there as the little boy quickly grows up into him.  Apparently, Clark was Ben who ran away as a little boy and was presumed dead when Dr. Frank ran him over with his car.  The real Clark died, and he took his identity to get back into the Madhouse.  He doesn't believe it at first, but then realizes his shirt is covered in blood. Ben begins to remember killing all the remaining doctors and nurses leaving only Dr. Frank and Sara still alive.  Ben confronts Dr. Frank in his office, attempting to flee and destroy all evidence of his embezzlement.  He tells Frank who he really is right before he kills him with the same axe he used on Dr. Morton.  Sara sees him kill Dr. Frank and runs to the Madhouse where she becomes trapped.  Clark tells her that he returned to this place to make it better, and to get rid of everyone who didn't even try to help him.  Sara tries to convince Clark that he shouldn't kill her because he loves her.  Ben lowers his guard from this, and Sara attacks him, only to eventually be overpowered by Ben.  As Sara begs Clark not to kill her, he replies "Clark isn't here. In fact, he never existed" right before he brings the axe down on her and the screen goes black before it makes contact.  In the final scene of the film, Ben is shown entering another mental health facility, dressed as "Clark" was in the opening scene.

After sabotaging the race as requested, they find out that the dog, 'Boots' as they call him, is useless as a racing dog. When propositioned by someone else to help sabotage the booky's attempts to win a very important race, they receive a dog, Cerberus as a reward.  They decide to test out Cerberus' ability and enter him in a race. However, instead of racing, Cerberus lies down inside the box and does not move, losing the boys some money. Outside the track after the race, the boys argue over what to do with the dog, when they are kidnapped and put in the back of a van. When they wake up, they find themselves hung up in a dog-food processing plant with the bookie and his henchman, Mooney in front of them. The bookie says that because they sabotaged the race his dog was in, which had a prize of £50,000, that they owed him that amount. He gives them a week to pay it.  The boys decide to go 'down south' to the [[Republic of Ireland]] in order to escape their pursuers. While in the south, they see a local fair and decide to race the dog so as to win some money. The dog loses and angers Scud, who sells him to some travellers who are there, against Mo Chara's wishes.

As the boys are discussing what they should do, the travellers appear on the scene again and hold the boys over a cliff, about to kill them. At the last minute Mo Chara offers them a deal where if the dog wins, the boys get to keep the dog, but they'll give the travellers the money they bet on the dog, plus half the prize money and if the dog loses, they'll pay the traveller's what they think he's worth, which they say is 50 grand in an unspecified currency. They can't win the money themselves because the dog is in the boys' name.  After some tense moments, the dog eventually wins and the travellers get their money and the boys get theirs.

One night, while drinking heavily, Creasy tries to commit suicide with his pistol, but the cartridge fails to fire when he pulls the trigger. He calls Rayburn, who says that "a bullet always tells the truth." At first, Creasy distances himself from Pita, but soon becomes a surrogate father to the girl, allowing him to stop drinking and find purpose in life. Creasy and Pita begin to bond over Pita's swimming lessons, as Creasy helps Pita get better in her swim meets.  One day, as Creasy waits to escort Pita from a piano lesson, a group of gunmen try to kidnap her. As Pita leaves her lesson to meet with Creasy, Creasy fires a shot in the air and tells Pita to run. A gunfight ensues between Creasy and the kidnappers. Creasy kills four of the kidnappers, including two corrupt policemen, in a [[shoot out]]; however, Creasy is shot multiple times and collapses from his wounds, while the abductors escape with Pita. Creasy is hospitalized and arrested for the murders of the policeman and suspected in Pita's kidnapping, but is moved to a veterinary hospital by Miguel Manzano ([[Giancarlo Giannini]]), a senior agent of the [[Agencia Federal de Investigación]] (AFI), who suspects Creasy will be killed by rogue policemen in retaliation.   Meanwhile, the Ramos family agree to deliver a [[dead drop]] ransom of [[U.S. dollar|US$]]10 million per the instructions of "La Voz" ("The Voice") (Roberto Sosa), head of the kidnapping ring. Samuel's attorney Jordan Kalfus ([[Mickey Rourke]]) and police lieutenant Victor Fuentes ([[Jesús Ochoa (actor)|Jesús Ochoa]]) arrange for the ransom to be collected from Samuel's kidnapping insurance policy, then delivered to the kidnappers. The drop, however, is ambushed by members of "La Hermandad", a powerful [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]] composed of corrupt police officers, who steal the money and kill The Voice's nephew in the process. The Voice notifies the Ramoses that in retribution for this, Pita will now be lost to them forever. Pita's mother, Lisa Martin Ramos ([[Radha Mitchell]]), tries to negotiate directly with La Voz, but he informs her that it's too late. An angry Lisa demands everyone to leave her house, as Lisa and Samuel are resigned to Pita's fate.  While Creasy is recovering from the shootout, he hears from Rayburn that the ransom from Pita's kidnapping went south and Pita was killed as a result. Rayburn learns from Creasy's doctor that Creasy wounds are great and leaving now before he has healed will lead to Creasy's death. Creasy leaves the hospital anyway before fully recovering, and returns to the scene of the crime. Creasy also goes to the Ramos residence, and goes to Pita's room, looking for her notebook for any clues to lead him to the kidnappers. Lisa appears and Creasy swears to her that he will kill everyone involved in her daughter's abduction. Lisa quietly approves and Rayburn helps Creasy purchase multiple weapons, including [[black market]] firearms, a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] launcher, and explosives. Mariana Guerrero ([[Rachel Ticotin]]), a journalist investigating kidnappings, and Manzano also offer their support to aide Creasy.   Creasy one by one tracks down low-level operatives involved in various stages of the kidnapping, torturing each for information about other operatives, then killing them in brutal ways. Eventually, Creasy learns from Fuentes, who is revealed to be the "president" of "La Hermandad", that the bags they stole at the ransom drop contained only $2.5 million of actual currency while the rest was blank paper. Fuentes also reveals that Kalfus was in on the plan before Fuentes is killed by an explosive placed inside of him.  Creasy goes to the home of Kalfus to find him beheaded in his pool, and Creasy finds evidence of questionable financial dealings with Samuel, linking Samuel to the kidnapping. He confronts Samuel and Lisa for the truth behind the kidnapping. Samuel confesses to Creasy and Lisa that he agreed to Kalfus' plan to stage Pita's kidnapping, so he could pay off business debts he inherited from his father, keeping $5 million of the ransom for himself and splitting the rest between Kalfus and the kidnappers. He was told by Kalfus that Pita would be returned after the ransom was paid, but Fuentes, who had been promised a cut of the money by Kalfus, became greedy and betrayed him and Samuel in an attempt to take the entire ransom for himself. Samuel held Kalfus responsible for the botched drop and confesses to killing him after learning that Kalfus had known all along about Fuentes' corruption. Lisa demands that Creasy kill Samuel. Creasy instead leaves Samuel with a pistol and the misfired round, which Samuel uses to commits suicide.  Using the information provided by Creasy, The Voice's identity is revealed by Manzano to be Daniel Sánchez, who Mariana exposes on the front page of her newspaper. Creasy sneaks into the home of Sánchez's ex-wife and children, and is fatally shot by his brother Aurelio ([[Gero Camilo]]), whom Creasy then captures. Creasy finds out that he not only has The Voice's brother hostage, but his pregnant wife. Creasy calls Daniel Sánchez and threatens to kill all of his family unless he gives himself up (shooting Aurelio's fingers off with a shotgun as a warning while Sanchez listens on the phone), but Sánchez reveals that Pita is still alive, and offers her in exchange for Aurelio and Creasy. After Sanchez confirms Pita's identity (Creasy has him identify what Pita calls her teddy bear as proof), Creasy agrees to the demands. Creasy contacts Lisa to confirm that Pita is alive and to meet him at the exchange. He instructs her to hold the shotgun to Aurelio and to not let him go until Lisa has Pita. He surrenders himself to Sánchez' men, after Pita is released to him. After an embrace, Creasy instructs Pita to runs to her mother. Aurelio is then released and Creasy surrenders to the kidnappers as Lisa and Pita drive away. As Creasy drives off with the kidnappers, it is implied that Creasy, at peace with himself, succumbs to his wounds and dies. Daniel Sánchez is later shot and killed by Manzano during an AFI arrest raid.  
The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)
 Major Ben Marco ([[Denzel Washington]]) is a war veteran who commanded a famous [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] raid during the [[Persian Gulf War]]. For his role in that mission, Sergeant Raymond Shaw ([[Liev Schreiber]]) was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for single-handedly defeating the enemy and rescuing all but two of his men. Shaw has gone on to become a famous [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] and, thanks to the influence of his mother, [[Virginia]] [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] Eleanor Prentiss ([[Meryl Streep]]), is nominated as the Vice-Presidential candidate over the favourite Senator Tom Jordan ([[Jon Voight]]). Shaw is withdrawn, but he opens up only to his mother and his childhood sweetheart, Tom Jordan's daughter Jocelyn ([[Vera Farmiga]]).  One of Marco's former NCOs, [[Corporal#United States|Corporal]] Al Melvin ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]), contacts him and says that he experiences confusing memories and "dreams" about their lost Army unit. He is clearly mentally ill, but he shows Marco some images he has drawn from his dreams. Marco begins to also have dreams about being captured on that raid and brainwashed by scientists led by a mysterious South African man ([[Simon McBurney]]), and of himself and Shaw murdering their fellow soldiers. Marco begins investigating what really happened during the war, and travels to New York. A woman named Eugenie, an outgoing supermarket clerk with whom Marco interacts frequently, sits with him on the train and ultimately offers him a place to stay.  As Marco investigates, he discovers an implant in his back and, soon thereafter, one in Shaw's after a confrontation at campaign headquarters. After having the one taken from Shaw analyzed, Marco realizes that it is a [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnological experiment]] connected with Manchurian Global, a powerful [[private equity]] firm with major political connections. Marco researches Manchurian and recognizes the British man as Dr. Atticus Noyle, a former Manchurian geneticist-turned-mercenary, from one of his nightmares. Marco brings his findings to the attention of Jordan, who, although he doesn't entirely believe the story, confronts the Shaws and suggests that Raymond bow out of the campaign. Instead, Eleanor "activates" Raymond and orders him to kill Jordan. Jocelyn is also killed when she tries to stop an entranced Raymond.  Eugenie reveals herself to be with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and have been monitoring the conspiracy for years. They found an implant in Melvin, who died like all of Shaw and Marco's squadmates in mysterious circumstances.  They arrange a meeting between Marco and Shaw to convince Shaw of his condition. The meeting takes place just as Governor Arthur and Shaw win the White House, and Shaw receives a phone call from Eleanor for Marco. Eleanor, who is deeply linked with Manchurian, uses trigger words to control Marco's mind, giving him commands to assassinate the [[President-Elect of the United States|President-Elect]] so that Shaw can become President. Eleanor admits to Shaw that she voluntarily gave him to the brainwashers for the good of the country. However, the trauma of Jocelyn's death gives Shaw the strength to resist the mind control.  At the climactic moment, Shaw deliberately places himself between Marco and the President-Elect. As Eugenie rushes through the celebration crowd trying to find Marco, Shaw nods gravely at the hidden Marco. Shaw then dances with his mother and steers them both into the marked position, where Marco kills both of them with a single shot from his rifle. Marco prepares to kill himself, but Eugenie, who saw Shaw's nod, arrives and stops him.  The FBI decides to protect Marco's innocence by framing a deceased Manchurian Global contractor as the shooter. The Manchurian executives watch their entire conspiracy revealed on television, but make no attempt to flee, knowing the truth's exposure has left them nowhere to run. In the last scene, Eugenie takes Marco to the compound where he was conditioned, which by now the FBI has found. Marco proceeds to drop Shaw's Medal of Honor into the sea.  
Marebito (film)
  Masuoka ([[Shinya Tsukamoto]]) carries a camera everywhere he goes. He becomes obsessed with the idea of [[fear]] when he sees a frightened man shove a knife in his eye to commit suicide. Wishing to understand the fear that the man must have felt before his death, Masuoka descends into a labyrinthine underground area beneath the city, where he sees human-like creatures that walk on their hands and knees and whimper like dogs. While searching the series of tunnels and passages, Masuoka encounters a homeless inhabitant who warns him about the [[Richard Sharpe Shaver|Deros]]. He then meets the ghost of Kuroki, the man who killed himself, and learns more about the underworld. After hours of searching, Masuoka discovers a mountain range with a village built by the underground dwellers. He finds a naked girl ([[Tomomi Miyashita]]) chained to a wall. He takes her back to his apartment and notices she doesn't eat, drink, or speak.    The girl, whom Masuoka dubs 'F', appears to be something other than human, and Masuoka becomes obsessed with understanding her. He sets up cameras that enable him to observe her from his cell phone when he leaves the apartment, and checks on her regularly. On a trip to the shopping mall, he sees F speaking to someone off camera, and a menacing man in black appears behind him. When he returns to the apartment, a woman in a yellow jacket is hiding in the stairway outside his door. Inside, he finds F convulsing, and unsuccessfully attempts to feed her. He discovers that twelve seconds of camera footage is missing, and receives a mysterious phone call from a pay phone call warning him that he is in serious trouble.  After being beaten with his camera by a stranger whom he filmed, Masuoka cuts his finger on the broken lens and returns home. He discovers that F survives on blood when she licks his finger, and cuts himself to feed her further. Masuoka begins to care for her by providing animal carcasses, deciding to treat F more as a pet than a human. The woman in yellow confronts him in the street, saying the girl is his daughter Fuyumi and asking where she is. Masuoka denies having a daughter and runs away, returning to the apartment to find it has been broken into and F missing. He wanders the streets searching for F and encounters the man in black, who expresses his disappointment in Masuoka's handling of her, speaking to him telepathically in the same voice as in the phone call. When Masuoka gets back to the apartment, he finds that F has returned and sees her hands are bloody.  When Masuoka leaves his apartment, the woman in yellow follows and demands that he speak to her. He walks to an alley without speaking, and turns his camera on. The woman says she wants to see her girl, at which point Masuoka stabs her to death. Later, he murders a young girl whom he met under the pretense of filming pornography. He drains their blood into bottles and feeds it to F. Masuoka calls the pay phone and speaks to the stranger, who agrees that Masuoka is taking better care of F now. While filming for a news crew at the scene of the second murder, Masuoka sees a woman he filmed in her apartment previously. He takes F out of the apartment, and leaves her in a [[karaoke]] room to travel on his own for a period. Sitting on a dock, Masuoka discusses his interest in fear with Kuroki.  Masuoka becomes homeless and sleeps in the park where he killed the young girl. He briefly admits to himself that he murdered his wife and a stranger and treated his daughter like an animal, before seeing a pair of Deros and finding a cell phone that leads him back to his apartment to find F. His wife's ghost appears behind Masuoka in the elevator, and he enters the apartment to find F weak on the floor. She speaks to him for the first time, and he cuts his mouth at the corner to feed her.  At the end of the film, F leads Masuoka back down into the underworld, and films him as it appears he has finally discovered the same fear that initially intrigued him.

Mythili ([[Jyothika]]) also learns music from the same college. Mythili gets scared seeing Madhan because once she had a dream of getting raped by him. Later on, she realizes his kind nature and they both become good friends.  But Madhan also has another side under the pseudonym '''Manmadhan''', in which he finds and kills morally incorrect girls in Chennai. He takes the dead bodies of those girls to drainage and burns them to ashes and stores it in bottles with the names of the girls pasted over the bottle. Media attention turns towards the case of missing girls and Chennai Assistant Commissioner of Police, Deva ([[Atul Kulkarni]]) takes the charge to find the person behind the mystery.  One day, Mythili finds Madhan riding a bike with a girl at the pillion. On the next day, Mythili gets shocked to see the news that the girl whom she spotted with Madhan the previous day goes missing. Mythili thinks that Madhan is behind all the crimes in the city and informs Deva about Madhan and his whereabouts. Hence Madhan gets arrested.  During the investigation, Madhan reveals that it was his younger brother Madhan Raj ([[Silambarasan|also Silambarasan]]) who was responsible for destroying the incorrect girls under the pseudonym '''Manmadhan'''. The story then moves to a flashback where Madhan Raj and Madhan Kumar were affectionate with each other. They lived with their Maternal Uncle '''Puncture''' Pandiyan ([[Goundamani]]). While Madhan Kumar was brave and intelligent, Madhan Raj was an innocent and sentimental person who went to [[Coimbatore]] in to join in an engineering college. There he got mingled with a friend named Bobby ([[N. Santhanam|Santhanam]]). He fell in love with his collegemate Vaishnavi ([[Sindhu Tolani]]). Vaishnavi also reciprocated her love for Madhan Raj seeing his good nature. But Madhan Raj's friends informed him that Vaishnavi was having an illicit affair with her relative Seenu who also studied in the same class. When Madhan Raj asked about this to Vaishnavi, she got angry thinking that Madhan Raj did not trust her.  Madhan Raj realized his mistake and went to Vaishnavi's house to apologize, but got shocked to see her on a bed with Seenu. Now he realized that his friends were correct. He also heard Vaishnavi's conversation with Seenu that she pretended to love Madhan Raj but would like to marry him, so that she could take advantage of his innocence and sincere love which would help her lead a life the way she wanted and Madhan Raj would be like a slave for her throughout her life. Madhan Raj got furious on seeing this and killed both Vaishnavi and Seenu. He returned to Chennai for meeting his brother Madhan Kumar and narrated the whole happenings. Madhan Raj set out in search of girls cheating in the name of love to kill them. Hence the flashback ends here.  Back to the present, the police investigates about Madhan Raj and gets all evidence about his existence. Madhan Kumar, with the help of Puncture Pandiyan, is released from the case. Now Mythili apologizes to Madhan Kumar and also proposes her love towards him which he rejects saying that he does not love her and mingled with her as a best friend. Mythili leaves the place saying that she will wait for Madhan Kumar believing he will accept her love someday.  The story again moves to a flashback where it is shown only to the audience that it was Madhan Kumar, who was none other than '''Manmadhan''' and he was really behind all the murders and Madhan Raj didn't have any links with the murders as he was innocent. In the flashback, Madhan Raj met his brother, informed about the happenings and committed suicide. Madhan Kumar hence decided to take revenge for his brother's death by killing girls who cheat in the name of love, under the pseudonym '''Manmadhan'''. Kumar has hidden his brother Raj's death thereby making him be absconding so that he could escape in the case of being caught. The movie ends showing that Madhan Kumar has hidden his love towards Mythili and spared her as she was very good and innocent. He also exclaims that if his brother loved a girl like her, he would also be lived happily and he would be married her. Hence Madhan Kumar will not marry Mythili because he will still proceed to kill such incorrect girls.

The Lizard (film)
 Reza Mesghaly, known as Reza the Lizard, is a [[thief]] known in criminal circles for his ability to bare-handedly climb all walls (from which he derives his name, "the Lizard", or "Marmoulak" in [[Persian language|Persian]]). At the very beginning of the film, he is [[arrest]]ed and charged with armed robbery, a [[crime]] that as revealed near the ending of the film, he did not commit. Nonetheless, he is sentenced to life in prison, and is met at the jailhouse by a strict [[Prison warden|warden]], who says that his intention is to "make a person out of prisoners"; thus they will be led into [[heaven]]; "by force," if necessary.  Reza is very restless at the prison, to the point where he steals medicine from the infirmary in order to attempt suicide. He is unable to go through with the act, however, and is stopped by his cellmate, who in the course of fighting with Reza causes the medicine bottle to break and cut open his arm. Reza is sent to the hospital to recover, where he meets a cleric, also staying in the hospital, also by the name of Reza. During his stay, the two become friends, and Reza Marmoulak overcomes his dislike of the Islamic clergy to accept the [[Islamic cleric|mullah]] after he is told a profound statement which stays with him for the rest of the film - "There are as many ways to reach God as there are people in the world."  Before he is discharged back into the prison, Reza Marmoulak steals the cleric's clothing, and impersonating him, is able to escape the prison and contact one of his friends, who tells him to go to a small border village and contact a man who will give him a fake [[passport]] to cross the border with. In the meantime, the warden is informed that Reza has escaped, and seeing this as a personal blemish on his record, pursues the criminal to the border village. Arriving by train at the village, Reza is taken in by the villagers who mistake him as the new mullah who was supposed to join their mosque.  The remainder of the film documents Reza's attempts to get in contact with the criminal underworld to obtain his false passport, while the police pursue him at the behest of the warden; and all along Reza tries to avoid tipping off the villagers to his actions. In the course of this, he becomes something of a hero in the eyes of the villagers, who misinterpret his attempts to track down his false passport as his visiting the homes of poor people and giving them charity. These actions continue to draw the praise of the villagers, convincing those who have abandoned faith in their religion to come to the mosque once again to hear the [[sermon]]s of Reza Marmoulak, most of which are derived from his brief contact with the cleric in the prison's hospital.  At the end of the film, Reza is finally tracked down by the warden, and on the night of a religious celebration at the mosque, he is arrested, without the villagers noticing. He hands over his robes to a small boy who had watched him over the course of the entire film, possibly the only person in the village who had guessed his identity all along, and goes peacefully with the warden and the police officer back to the prison in Tehran. As they are entering the car, the officer attempts to handcuff Reza, an attempt stopped by the warden and followed by his famous line, "That's not needed anymore".  The film ends with a shot inside the mosque, now being finally full of eager prayers because of Reza. as the police car leaves for Tehran, the prayers look at it; probably wondering about the petty thief in it, while waiting for the great Mullah. This frame is frozen, and the same words spoken by the mullah in the hospital and the most important message of the film are heard for one last time; this time expressing Reza's destiny: "There are as many ways to reach God as there are people in the world."

To aid them, Mudo calls his friend, the legendary pro wrestler Ruben "Mascarita"  (who hates being called Mascarita) and his sidekick, Tony "the Cannibal", a man-eating dwarf.   They then agree to go to a bar and there decide that the best plan is throw Cabos' body in his house, as a massive party is taking place that evening, and make him believe he drank himself to unconsciousness. After toasting for the plan to work, a rugby player in the bar recognizes "Mascarita" and calls him by that name. A huge fight "Santo" style takes place. While "Mascarita" takes away all of the students in the table, another group of students from  a billiards table get mad and provoke him again. "Mascarita" prepares for more, but Tony stops him. "Mascarita" understands and tells Jaque and Mudo to leave with him and let Tony do his thing. They are seen outside the bar while noises and shouts are heard from inside. Tony then exits the places, spitting out a ring, taken from one of the students finger, thus explaining the nickname "Cannibal".  Meanwhile, the kidnappers arrive to a girl's house, leaving the abducted tied in a chair with a bag on his head. They now attempt to call Cabos' house and inform his wife that they have him and ask for ransom. However, the maid is confused about the call and hangs up repeated occasions. After the wife takes the phone, she interprets this as an excuse for her husband not to show up at the party, and hangs up again.  After being worn out from the bar fight, "Mascarita", Mudo and Jaque go to the latter's apartment to change clothes for the parties occasion. While Jaque is selecting a presentable shirt, Mudo and "Mascarita" are annoyed by the neighbor's bird and go to the door and complain. They stay a while waiting for an answer. Then Jaque's girlfriend arrives to argue with him for standing her up and not taking her to her father's party. Angrily, she leaves and takes Jaque's car (with Cabos still in it). When Mudo and "Mascarita" finally hear the neighbor's voice, Mudo flips out and starts screaming for him to shut his bird up. The neighbor then opens his door (after unlocking around five locks) and points two Tec-9's at each of their faces. He explains his emotional bondage with the bird and threatens them to not complain again. After that, Jaque tells them to get going.  Ironically, Jaque's girlfriend, Cabos' daughter, is also the kidnapper's ally's friend. She goes to her house and asks her to join her to her father's party. The kidnapper's leader then appears from their hideout and pretends to be her boyfriend, and the three go to Cabos' party.  In the party a series of mix-ups occur, resulting in the dumping of Cabos' friend by mistake and Cabos being left in Jaque's house. He then returns to his house, and finds his wife having sex with Tony. Tony escapes out the window. Cabos chases him and sees his friend lying in the yard, who wakes up to the sight of an angry Cabos and subsequently receives a golf club to the face.

Meet the Fockers
 Set two years after the events of the [[Meet the Parents|first film]], Gaylord "Greg" Focker ([[Ben Stiller]]) and his fiancée Pam Byrnes ([[Teri Polo]]) decide to introduce their parents to each other. They first fly to [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on [[Long Island]], to pick up Pam's father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes ([[Robert De Niro]]), her mother Dina ([[Blythe Danner]]) and one-year-old nephew Little Jack (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to [[Miami]] to meet the Fockers in his new [[Recreational vehicle|RV]].  Once they arrive, they are greeted by Greg's eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), and mother, Roz ([[Barbra Streisand]]), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Concerned that Jack might be put off by the Focker's lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. However, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. The meet gets off to a bad start when a chase between the Focker's active dog, Moses (a brown [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] with black trim), and the Byrnes's cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RV's [[toilet]], forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jack's back during a game of [[football]].  Meanwhile, Pam informs Greg that she's pregnant, and the two decide to keep it secret from Jack. Jack again becomes suspicious of Greg's integrity and quality, when they are introduced to the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos ([[Alanna Ubach]]), with whom Bernie reveals Greg had a sexual affair fifteen years before. Jack later takes the RV to Isabel's 15-year-old son, Jorge ([[Ray Santiago]]), to fix the toilet, but is disturbed by Jorge's striking resemblance to Greg, and the fact that Jorge never met his father, and jumps to the conclusion that he might be Greg's son with Isabel. Meanwhile, Roz, Bernie and Dina realize Pam is pregnant, but promise not to tell Jack. Growing envious of Bernie and Roz's active sex life, Dina consults Roz on sex tips in order to seduce Jack, but none of them work.  Greg and Jack's relationship goes off with a bang when Greg is left alone to babysit Little Jack, whom Jack has been raising via the [[Ferber method]]. Despite Jack's instructions to leave Little Jack to self-soothe, Greg is unable to stand listening to Little Jack's cries and tends to the boy to cheer him up by hugging him, letting him watch [[television|TV]] (even putting on ''[[Elmo's World]]'' for him), acting funny, and inadvertently teaching Little Jack the word "asshole." Disaster strikes when Greg answers a brief phone call from Roz, which is long enough for Little Jack to wander out of his [[playpen]] (after being opened by Jinx), put on ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and glue his hands to a bottle of [[rum]]. After a furious argument with the Fockers and his own family (though amends are quickly made), Jack resumes his spying on Greg and sends Greg and Jorge's hair samples for a DNA test, while inviting Jorge to the Fockers' planned engagement party in the hope of getting Greg to admit he is Jorge's father. At the engagement party, Jack, who automatically assumes that Greg knew about Jorge and has deliberately been keeping him a secret from Pam, introduces Greg to Jorge. Later, when Greg denies knowing anything about Jorge, Jack still refuses to believe him and drugs him with [[truth serum]] to make him talk. On stage, Greg uncontrollably blurts out that Pam is pregnant and that Jorge is his son in a [[Darth Vader]]-esqe matter before immediately [[unconsciousness|losing consciousness]].  The next morning, Pam questions Greg about Jorge, and Greg does not confirm or deny that he is Jorge's father, but insists that he knew nothing about him before the previous evening. Pam believes him, and is willing to work things out with him. Jack reaches his breaking point with Greg's dishonesty and demands that Pam and Dina leave the island with him. Dina refuses and reveals Jack's actions to everyone. Everyone turns against Jack, with Pam announcing her intent to marry Greg regardless of him having Jorge with Isabel, and Dina admits that they were all aware of Pam's pregnancy. A shocked and hurt Jack leaves with his grandson.  Bernie and Greg pursue Jack, but are soon [[taser]]ed and arrested by an incompetent deputy [[sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], Vern LeFlore ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]), due to a refusal to cooperate with him when he attempts to pull them over for speeding. Jack returns to defend them after being informed Greg is not Jorge's father (his real father turns out to be a baseball player who also resembles Greg), but the overzealous LeFlore tasers and arrests him as well. In their cell, Greg, Jack, and Bernie are released by the local judge, Ira ([[Shelley Berman]]), who is a client of Roz and close friend of the Fockers. Before they leave, Greg requests that Jack and Bernie stop their feud. Jack admits that he made a mistake regarding Jorge and reveals his past career in the CIA to Bernie, before apologizing for his actions and making up with the two of them.  Greg and Pam are married that weekend by Pam's ex-fiancé, Kevin ([[Owen Wilson]]), who is now an ordained interfaith minister. During the party, Jack asks Roz for some sex tips and sneaks into the RV with Dina.  During the [[post-credit scene]], Jack watches hidden baby-cam footage of the Fockers giving attention to Little Jack over Jack's previous objections: Roz gives Little Jack chocolate, Bernie advises him to use his crying to disagree with everything Jack says, and Greg pretends to drunkenly tell Little Jack to keep it a secret that he left to smoke pot, not answer the phone, when he left Little Jack unattended and that Pam is not really pregnant and only said it so that Jack would let them get married. Greg then pretends to only just discover the camera but then after making teasing gestures at it, Greg reveals that he knew about it all along and none of the things he said before were true.  
Mean Creek
 When small and quiet Sam admits to his older brother, Rocky, that the school bully, George, has hurt him because he moved George's video camera while George was filming himself shooting baskets, Rocky tells his friends, reserved Clyde and troubled Marty, and they devise a plan for revenge. Part of the prank entails taking George on a boating trip to celebrate Sam's fictional birthday. Then, they will get him to strip in a game of truth or dare, then make him run home naked.  Sam invites his new girlfriend, Millie, along, and all six of them are driven to the river by Marty. During the ride, George reveals a different side by being genuinely pleased to be invited; the group also learns he is dyslexic. However, Sam does not tell Millie the real plan until they arrive near the river. Millie refuses to continue until Sam promises he will call the plan off, which Sam agrees to do. Sam tells his brother he wants to stop, and Rocky then tells Clyde and Marty. Although Clyde has no problem with not going through, Marty is very reluctant to not do so. Throughout the trip, George clumsily attempts to fit in with the group. Despite this, George also gets confrontational when questioned about his motives (or lack thereof) when attacking someone. The group soon realizes although George is annoying and extremely insecure, he is very lonely and just wants to be accepted and liked.  On the boat, Marty deviates from the others' plan and initiates a game of [[truth or dare]], though the rest decide to go along with the game. After George shoots Rocky with a water gun in good fun, George makes a funny quip about Marty's father, not remembering that it is a sore subject as Marty's father killed himself years ago. This sets off Marty, who dares George to strip naked and jump in the water. When George does not comply, Marty exposes the whole plan and starts to ridicule George. Angered and humiliated, George launches into a vulgar tirade against everyone else on the boat, ending by crudely mocking Marty's dead father. Marty snaps and Rocky, in an attempt to stop the fight, accidentally pushes George off the boat. Unable to swim, George struggles to remain afloat in the water. As the others regard the scene in horror, George accidentally hits his head with his video camera and does not come to the surface. Rocky dives into the water but is unable to find George. Minutes later, George appears face down in the shallow water close to the shore. Rocky exhorts the others to help him bring George to shore, where Millie gives him [[CPR]]. The effort is in vain as George is dead.  The group is traumatized and in fear of being charged with murder. They dig a hole and bury George. Clyde's plan is to explain that it was an accident, but Marty threatens them, reminding them that George's camera (now lost in the water) has recorded Marty's taped confession of the original plan and the authorities will find out if the camera is discovered. Marty then gains the complicity of both Clyde and the rest of the group. As they had already tricked George into not telling his mother where he was going, she would not know of their involvement. At the end of the day, they all gather at Sam and Rocky's house. Sam, Rocky, Clyde, and Millie have had a change of heart and are willing to accept the consequences as opposed to having the guilt of George's death hanging over their heads. Marty refuses to turn himself in and feels betrayed. He storms out and convinces his brother to give him his gun and car. The brother again agrees to the favor, albeit reluctantly. Marty robs a gas station with the gun and drives off, becoming a fugitive. Meanwhile, the others go to George's house and confess to his mother with genuine remorse on their faces.  Sam is later seen in an interrogation room, telling the story to the police, who later find and view the tape from George's video camera. In a final scene, audio of George explaining his dream of becoming a filmmaker and documenting his life in hopes those who see it will finally understand him plays in the background. The police force, along with Sam, Rocky, and their father, and George's mother, find the location of the corpse while Sam watches the sheriff exhume George's body, as George's mother cries with devastation, his face full of regret and great pain for what he, his older brother, and friends have done.  
Mean Girls
  Sixteen-year-old [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] Cady Heron and her zoologist parents return to the United States after a twelve-year research trip in [[Africa]], settling in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]]. Attending a public school, North Shore High, for the first time, Cady meets new classmates Janis Ian and Damian Leigh. Janis and Damian educate Cady on the school's various cliques and warn her to avoid the most popular and infamous one, the "[[Airhead (subculture)|Plastics]]", who are led by [[queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]] Regina George and include insecure rich girl Gretchen Wieners and sweet but dimwitted Karen Smith. The Plastics take an interest in Cady, and invite her to sit with them at lunch. Seeing that Cady is getting along with the Plastics, Janis devises a plan of revenge against Regina for some past slight, using Cady as the infiltrator.  Cady soon learns about Regina's journal, "The Burn Book", which is filled with rumors, secrets and insults about other girls and some teachers at school. Despite this discovery, Cady decides to forgo Janis' scheme for ethical reasons. Meanwhile, Cady becomes attracted to Regina's ex-boyfriend, Aaron Samuels, whom a jealous Regina proceeds to steal back at a Halloween party by kissing him in front of Cady. This spurs Cady to fully commit to Janis' plan to cut off Regina's "resources", which involve breaking Regina and Aaron up, tricking her into eating Swedish "[[Candy bar|nutrition bars]]" that actually make her gain weight, and turning Regina's fellow Plastics against her. In the process, Cady unwittingly remakes herself in Regina's image, becoming spiteful and superficial, and abandons Janis and Damian.  When Regina is finally made aware of Cady's treachery, she retaliates by spreading the contents of the Burn Book all over the school, quickly inciting massive socially motivated brawls throughout the school. To avoid suspicion, Regina inserts a fake libel of herself in the book in order to blame Cady, Gretchen, and Karen, the only female juniors not mentioned in the book. Karen convinces Principal Duvall that they did not spread the book. The principal soon quells the fighting, and gathers all of the junior girls in the gymnasium. Math teacher Ms. Norbury, whom the Burn Book defamed as a drug dealer, makes the girls face the ways they all treat each other, confess their transgressions, and apologize to each other and the teachers; the plan sees success, as friendships are rekindled. When Janis' turn comes, she defies Norbury, confessing her plan to destroy Regina with Cady's help and openly mocking Regina with the support of the other girls. Pursued by an apologetic Cady, Regina storms out of the school and is struck by a school bus, breaking her spine.  Without any friends, shunned by Aaron, grounded by her parents and despised by her peers at school, Cady takes full blame for the Burn Book, and becomes an outcast. After she makes amends with Regina, Cady's guilt soon dissolves, and she returns to her old personality. As part of her punishment for lying and failing Ms. Norbury's class, she joins the Mathletes in the state championship finals, and wins the championship for the school. At the Spring Fling dance, Regina's new boyfriend, Shane Oman, is elected King, while Cady is elected Queen. Onstage, Cady declares that all of her classmates are wonderful in their own way, breaks her plastic tiara, and distributes the pieces to some other girls. She then reconciles with Janis, Damian, and Aaron, and reaches a truce with the Plastics.  By the start of the new school year, the Plastics have disbanded. Regina has joined the lacrosse team to deal with her anger, showing intense talent for the sport, Karen has become the school weather reporter (claiming that her breasts can tell when it is raining), and Gretchen has joined the "Cool Asians" clique. Aaron has graduated from high school and attends [[Northwestern University]] in [[Chicago]], and Janis has begun dating Mathlete Kevin Gnapoor, whom she initially disliked. A group of new "Junior Plastics" has arisen, and Cady imagines them being hit by a bus.

The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)
   
Metallic Blues
  The film (often categorized as a [[tragicomedy]], but the comedic elements are limited) concerns two Israeli car salesmen who initially think the world is their oyster after a rare 1985 Lincoln Continental limousine – curiously with [[Quebec]] license plates (perhaps a nod to the largely Québécois production crew, although real plates in Quebec are actually only available in the rear of a car, not the front like in the film) – falls into their laps at their used-car dealership in [[Tel Aviv]]. After reviewing a publication by the corporate German dealership Auto Decker in [[Düsseldorf]], they are led to believe that the car could net them as much as €50,000 and sail with the vehicle to Germany in order to sell it. While learning that the task may not be as easy as hoped, they are also confronted with a number of emotional episodes. Shmuel (portrayed by [[Avi Kushnir]]) is an [[Ashkenazi Jew]], whose parents were [[Holocaust]] survivors, and is surprised to find how affected he is by the voyage. His companion Siso (played by [[Moshe Ivgy]]) is a [[Mizrahi Jew]] of modest means who, unlike his companion, has no working knowledge of English (spoken routinely by Shmuel to the various German characters they encounter), and is therefore often overwhelmed and confused during their experience. To Siso, Shmuel's history is largely unknown, and a tragic curiosity.  The dialogue between Siso and Shmuel is in Hebrew, but due to the circumstances, much of the film is also in English and German.

Mickey (2004 film)
 Tripp Spence (Harry Connick, Jr.) is a widowed Virginia-based lawyer who becomes the focus of an intensive [[IRS]] investigation regarding false bankruptcy claims he filed during his wife's fatal illness.  Realizing his case against the inevitable criminal charges is hopeless, he takes his 13-year-old son Derrick (Shawn Salinas), who loves playing [[Little League]] baseball and is competing in his final year of eligibility due to age restrictions, and flees from the investigation, moving out west to Las Vegas, Nevada. Through a corporate connection, Tripp acquires new identities for the two of them, with Tripp becoming Glen Simon Ryan and Derrick becoming Michael "Mickey" Jacob Ryan, whose fictional backstory is that they recently moved into town from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Derrick's new identity makes him a year younger, which enables him to play another year of Little League, an endeavor both of them look forward to since their spontaneous move forced Derrick to miss his All-Star team's participation in the official Little League qualifier tournaments. Tripp researches the local Little League operations and discovers that the most successful league's top team is coached by Tony (Mike Starr). Tripp contacts Tony and convinces him to give Mickey a private tryout session by reciting the Fort Lauderdale story (Florida is known as a major "hotzone" for youth baseball). Tony is impressed with Mickey's pitching velocity and ultimately drafts Mickey once the real tryouts roll around. Glen also begins dating Patty, who works at Mickey's school.  A full year of physical development ahead of the rest of the players, Mickey displays outstanding abilities on the field, quickly emerging as the league's top pitcher and hitter, which unanimously earns him a spot on the All-Star team. Glen is initially satisfied, but begins to worry as Mickey's team continuously ascends their way through the district and regional brackets, which attracts considerable media attention as they earn a spot at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Paranoid that the media attention will ultimately give away their location to the IRS, Glen tries to convince Mickey to quit playing, but Mickey refuses to let his new friends down, stating that they knew the risks from the beginning.  After pitching a perfect game against the Gulf States team, Mickey removes the faux glasses that were used as a disguise (despite Glen's warnings not to), which allows the IRS agents pursuing Glen and Mickey to positively identify them. Mickey's team ultimately reaches the [[Little League World Series]] Championship game as the U.S. representative against a highly publicized team from [[Cuba]], the International finalist. The IRS agent in charge of the investigation approaches Glen, telling him he will be arrested following the tournament. During the game, a politician who had vowed to ban the Cuban team from participating in the tournament passes on information to LLWS officials of ineligible players on both the Cuban and U.S. teams. It is found that the Cuban team, which is supposed to be strictly from Havana, is made up of [[All Star]] players from various island teams, and Mickey and Glen's true identities are exposed.  Following the game, Glen is arrested and a press conference is called. Tripp/Glen reveals the truth about Derrick/Mickey. The LLWS Commissioner announces that both teams' participation in the tournament will be forfeited, and that the semifinal losers will play the next day for the championship. Derrick confesses the truth to his coach and teammates, but his friends forgive him because they never would have made it as far as they did without him. Derrick visits Tripp at the local precinct, where they say goodbye. After a year in prison, Tripp is released, and in the final scene he throws a baseball to Derrick that hits the windshield of Patty's car.  
Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers
 The story begins with Troubadour, a French accented turtle who loves songs, backstage of a show trying to remind the narrator that he promised to use one of Troubadour's songs. The narrator ignores the turtle and breaks his promise, but accidentally falls through a trapdoor just as the show is about to begin. Consequently, Troubadour is ushered to tell the audience the story at the last minute. Panicking, Troubadour quickly picks up [[The Three Musketeers]] storybook and begins reading.  Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Mickey's dog Pluto are [[Street|street urchin]]s, who, while being robbed by masked bandits (played by the [[Beagle Boys]]) are saved by the Royal Musketeers, [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Aramis]], [[Porthos]] and [[D'Artagnan]]. Mickey is gifted one of their hats, inspiring them to follow their example and become musketeers; however, in the present day, Mickey, Donald and Goofy are lowly janitors for the musketeers' headquarters. Unfortunately, they are very clumsy and constantly cause messes. After an incident disturbs the captain of the musketeers, portrayed by [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]], he tells the trio that they cannot become musketeers because Donald is a "coward", Goofy a "doofus" and Mickey "just too small", leaving the three downhearted.  Meanwhile, Minnie Mouse, princess of France, and her lady-in-waiting, Daisy Duck, are in a palace discussing Minnie's obsession with finding her "one true love". Daisy says that she must marry someone who is of royal blood, and Minnie insists that she cannot marry someone she does not love. Minnie says she will know "the one" when he makes her laugh. Minnie then takes a walk in the palace garden and barely survives an attempt on her life as the Beagle Boys attempt to drop a safe on her.  The Beagles run to tell their boss, revealed to be Captain Pete, that they were not successful in dropping the safe on Minnie. In response, Pete clobbers them for misunderstanding his orders, saying he wanted them to "keep her safe" until he can take over the kingdom. Pete is summoned by princess Minnie, who demands he produce musketeer bodyguards. Realizing that skilled musketeers will jeopardize his plan to overthrow the princess, Pete quickly goes to the janitor room, and tells Mickey, Donald and Goofy that they passed his test and have what it takes to become musketeers, knowing that will be easy to get rid of. After meeting each other, Minnie falls in love with Mickey.  While Minnie and Daisy, protected by Mickey, Donald, and Goofy, go on a journey, they are ambushed by the Beagle Boys. Donald hides and is eventually thrown off the carriage, and Goofy is easily defeated, leaving Mickey to fight the intruders. Mickey is also defeated, leaving the three heroes stranded. Mickey encourages his friends not to lose hope and they rush to rescue Minnie and Daisy. Mickey, Donald and Goofy manage to save Minnie and Daisy in a tower where the Beagle Boys are keeping them. Afterwards, Mickey manages to make Minnie laugh and the two mice fall in love and spend time alone with each other.  Pete is furious that the Beagle Boys failed in their task and realizes that the three protagonists are more of a threat than he originally anticipated. He then plans to get rid of them one by one. While on night duty, Goofy is lured away from the palace by Clarabelle and subdued. The Beagle Boys attack Donald, scaring him into hiding, before Pete traps him and puts Donald to the guillotine. Donald escapes his execution at the last second, causing Pete to lose his peg leg as he dove under the guillotine's blade to try to prevent his escape. Donald returns to the castle and tells the whole story to Mickey before running off in fear, leaving Mickey by himself. Mickey is then captured by Pete, who chains him up in a dungeon in [[Mont Saint-Michel]] that will flood when the tide comes in. Goofy is meanwhile chained by Clarabelle and is about to be thrown off a bridge over a river to drown, but Goofy falls in love with Clarabelle and wins her heart with his "numbskull charm". As Clarabelle reveals Pete's true intentions, the bridge crumbles and Goofy and Clarabelle fall to the river below. Donald, who is rowing across the river to escape France, breaks their fall. Goofy fails to convince Donald to help him save Mickey, but thanks to a ridiculing song from Troubadour, the duo save Mickey in time and after reconciling with each other, they set off to rescue Daisy and Princess Minnie.  Minnie and Daisy are captured in a theater and locked in a chest by the Beagle Boys who then impersonate Minnie, announcing to the public that control is now being handed over to "King Pete the Magnificent". Mickey, Donald and Goofy arrive and battle Pete and the Beagle Boys onstage, finally defeating them and saving Daisy and the Princess. Mickey and Minnie finally declare their love for one another, as do the others. At the end, Princess Minnie dubs Mickey, Donald and Goofy royal musketeers.  
Meu Tio Matou um Cara
 After Eder shows up and confesses to what he has done, Duca's father ([[Aílton Graça]]) calls his lawyer friend to help Eder prepare his [[defense (legal)|defense]]. Duca then goes to his long-time friend Isa's house, whom he secretly has feelings for, to tell her about the excitement. Soon after, his other friend Kid (Renan Augusto) arrives as well, and they explain the story to him as well. Duca sees Kid touch Isa's shoulder, though, and becomes jealous so he decides to return home.<ref>http://www.adorocinema.com/filmes/filme-108954/</ref>  The following day, Duca talks with Isa (Sophia Reis) again, and his skill for detective work by spotting flaws in her story that she did not spend much time with Kid after Duca left; he does not mention this to her, though, and finds out the truth from Kid later while they are shopping for CDs.  As the story develops, Duca continues to try to subtly keep Isa and Kid from getting together due to Isa's obvious attraction to Kid, while simultaneously looking into the murder. To this end, Duca asks permission to visit Eder in jail.  Isa eagerly volunteers to go along on the adventure, and they set out the following day. When they meet Eder, he asks Duca to give a message to his lover. Eder asks Duca to tell her not to visit him while he is in jail, and to tell her that he is fine. On the way back, Isa remembers the [[Pokémon]] pen that was confiscated from her and they return to the jail to retrieve it. Since they took the bus through a dangerous part of town, they are forced to walk the distance. The two encounter a group of men who aggressively hit on Isa, causing her to run away.  The next day at school, she brags about her adventure, embellishing the details greatly to her friends. Duca remains silent, but when pressed for details himself, he disagrees with Isa, and she storms away angrily. Attempting to get past the incident, he pretends it never happened, to the annoyance of Isa. Kid, however, is eager to have an adventure of his own and so agrees to travel to Eder's girlfriend's condo and relay the message.  After locating Eder's Lover, Soraya ([[Deborah Secco]]), they are permitted up by the [[doorman (profession)|doorman]]. She answers her door scantily clad, and invites the boys in. They relay the message, to her general disinterest, and she requests that Duca repair her automatic pool cleaning device - a product of Eder's that failed to sell well. Out by her pool, Duca notices several items which lead him to believe another man is living with Soraya. Moving inside, his suspicions are confirmed when he sees a tattooed male arm answering a phone downstairs. While leaving, they accidentally track soil from a broken vase over the carpet downstairs to the fury of the doorman. They flee, giving Kid something to brag about at school the next day as well.  Duca again visits his uncle, and this time asks him more questions. He decides that Eder is lying about his involvement and is covering for Soraya, who Duca believes is the true killer. Duca believes that his uncle is taking the fall for a woman who is being unfaithful to Eder and may be simply using Eder. He believes that Eder would never take Duca's word for it about the man living with Soraya, and so he goes about hiring a private investigator to obtain photographic evidence.  Meanwhile, during the investigation, Duca is worried that an upcoming party will lead to Isa and Kid getting together at last, so he craftily plays [[matchmaking|matchmaker]] with Kid and another classmate. However, upon seeing how unhappy Isa becomes after watching the two dance, Duca helps to repair the situation and leaves the party with his two friends dancing closely together.  When the investigator shows the photographs, Duca is surprised to find it showing Kid back at Soraya's condo. The series of pictures seems to suggest that the two had sex, and when Isa asks to see the photographs, Duca refuses to show them, causing yet another fight between the two friends.  Duca mails the photographs to Eder, hoping it will convince him to tell the truth to the [[police]], and he remains not on speaking terms with his two friends for nearly a week. Isa, hoping to make up, comes to his house and has lunch with Duca and his family. Eder shows up, having obtained [[Habeas corpus]] pending his trial. He has not yet opened the package containing the photographs Duca sent him, and becomes furious upon seeing them. He rushes from the house intent on killing both his girlfriend and her new lover. Isa also sees the pictures as well and is also crushed.  Duca convinces her that they must go to Soraya's condo, though, to try to stop Eder from doing something foolish. Eder, meanwhile, attacks the man living with his girlfriend and discovers that it is Fabio, Soraya's brother. The man in the pictures, however, is Kid (although the two do resemble each other). Soraya explains the series of photographs with an innocent story; but Duca can see that she is lying. As usual, though, he does not mention it to anyone. Eder and his girlfriend make up, and Duca decides to keep Soraya's secret seeing Eder so happy. Isa and Kid also break up, though Kid tells Duca privately that he had misread the situation and never had sex with Soraya. Isa informs Duca that she and Kid broke up, to which Duca offers condolences. Isa asks him if that is really how he feels and Duca admits that he is happy they are no longer together. The film ends with the two friends kissing and Eder's fate still unknown.

Million Dollar Baby
 Margaret "Maggie" Fitzgerald, a waitress from a [[Missouri]] town in the [[Ozarks]], shows up in the Hit Pit, a run-down [[Los Angeles]] gym  owned and operated by Frankie Dunn, an old, cantankerous boxing trainer. Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses. Maggie works out tirelessly each day in his gym, even after Frankie tells her she's "too old" to begin a boxing career at her age. Eddie "Scrap-Iron" Dupris, Frankie's friend and employee—and the film's narrator—encourages and helps her.  Frankie's prize prospect, "Big" Willie Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Frankie rejecting offers for a championship bout. With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local priest, with whom he spars verbally at daily [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]].  Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her [[lightweight]] bouts with first-round knockouts. Earning a reputation for her [[Knockout|KOs]], Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.  Eventually, Frankie takes a risk by putting her in the junior [[welterweight]] class, where her nose is broken in her first match. Frankie comes to establish a paternal bond with Maggie, who substitutes for his estranged daughter. Scrap, concerned when Frankie rejects several offers for big fights, arranges a meeting for her with Mickey Mack at a diner on her 33rd birthday. Out of loyalty, she declines. Frankie begrudgingly accepts a fight for her against a top-ranked opponent in the UK, where he bestows a [[Irish language|Gaelic]] nickname on her. The two travel to Europe as she continues to win; Maggie eventually saves up enough of her winnings to buy her mother a house, but she berates Maggie for endangering her government aid, claiming that everyone back home is laughing at her.  Frankie is finally willing to arrange a title fight. He secures Maggie a $1 million match in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] against the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] women's welterweight champion, Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman, a German ex-prostitute who has a reputation as a dirty fighter. Overcoming a shaky start, Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but after a round has ended, Billie knocks her out with an illegal [[sucker punch]] from behind after the bell has sounded to indicate the end of the round. Before Frankie can pull the corner stool out of the way which was inappropriately placed on its side by Frankie's assistant, Maggie lands hard on it, breaking her neck and leaving her a ventilator-dependent [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]].  Frankie is shown experiencing the first three of [[Kübler-Ross model|the five stages of grief]]: first seeking multiple doctors' opinions in denial, then blaming Scrap in anger and later trying to bargain with God through prayer.  In a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie looks forward to a visit from her family, but they arrive accompanied by an attorney and only after having first visited [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]; their only concern is to transfer Maggie's assets to them. She orders them to leave, threatening to sell the house and inform the [[IRS]] of her mother's [[welfare fraud]] if they ever show their faces again.  As the days pass, Maggie develops [[bedsore]]s and undergoes an [[amputation]] for an infected leg. She asks a favor of Frankie: to [[Assisted suicide|help her die]], declaring that she got everything she wanted out of life. A horrified Frankie refuses, and Maggie later bites her tongue repeatedly in an attempt to bleed to death, but the medical staff saves her and takes measures to prevent further suicide attempts. The priest Frankie has harassed for 23 years, Father Horvak, warns him that he would never find himself again if he were to go through with Maggie's wishes.  Frankie sneaks in one night, unaware that Scrap is watching from the shadows. Just before administering a fatal injection of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]], he finally tells Maggie the meaning of a nickname he gave her, ''[[Macushla|Mo Chuisle]]'' (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"): [[Irish language|Irish]] for "my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse"). He never returns to the gym. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Frankie's daughter, informing her of her father's true character. The last shot of the film shows Frankie sitting at the counter of a diner where Maggie once took him, and after having a homemade lemon meringue pie with her, said "Now I can die and go to heaven".  
Millions (2004 film)
 ''Millions'' tells the story of Damian ([[Alex Etel]]), Catholic school boy, whose family moves to the suburbs of [[Widnes]] after the death of his mother. Soon after the move, Damian's "hermitage" in a cardboard box by the train tracks is disturbed by a bag of money flung from a passing train. Damian immediately shows the money to his brother, Anthony ([[Lewis Owen McGibbon]]), and the two begin thinking of what to do with it. Anthony wants the money all to himself. Damian, kind-hearted and religious, had recently overheard three [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Latter-day Saint missionaries]] lecture other members of the community on building foundations of rock rather than foundations of sand, an old Christian principle which dictates that self-worth should be based on the teachings of [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] rather than any other object of worship such as Money/[[Mammon]] or Power. The lecture inspires Damian, who looks for ways to give his share of the money to the poor; at one point he even stuffs a bundle of cash through the missionaries' letter box, having heard about their modest lifestyle and deciding that they too must be poor.   Throughout the story, Damian commits small acts of kindness like buying birds from pet stores and setting them free and taking beggars to [[Pizza Hut]], while Anthony bribes other kids at school into being his transportation and bodyguards, and looks into investing the money in real estate.  The story takes place in the weeks leading up to [[Bank of England|The Bank of England]]'s (fictional) change from the [[pound sterling|pound]] (£) to the [[euro]] (€)- an event publicised as '€ Day'. An assembly is held at Damian's school to inform the children about the change, as well as to educate the children about helping the poor. Realizing that the money, which is in pounds, will be no good after a few days, Damian decides that the best thing to do would be to give it away before the conversion. He drops £1,000 into the donation can at the assembly. The woman collecting the money, Dorothy ([[Daisy Donovan]]), is forced to report Damian; when questioned by the principal, Anthony lies that he and Damian stole the money from the missionaries. Damian and Anthony are grounded that night. When their father collects them from school he chats with Dorothy, and there is an obvious attraction between them.  After the donation, Anthony's friend informs them that a train carrying notes which were to be destroyed after the conversion had been robbed. One bag was stolen in a diversion, while the robber remained on the train disguised as one of the emergency staff, and the money had been dispersed by throwing it off of the train at various locations throughout the country to be collected by the robbers. The boys logically conclude that their money was stolen, and Damian, who thought the money was from God, feels terrible.  Around this time, a mysterious man comes snooping around the train tracks and asks Damian if he has any money. Damian thinks that the man is a beggar and tells him he has 'loads of money'. However, Anthony realises he is one of the robbers, and gives the man a jar full of coins to cover Damian's tracks.  The robber eventually finds out where Damian lives and ransacks his house. Damian had informed his father about the money just before they came home to their destroyed house. The robbery is then explained. The robbers boarded the train. They then escaped the police by dressing as football fans and joining a crowd of similarly dressed fans leaving a game. However, one man remained on the train. He began to throw the money off, to be collected later. The robber who came sneaking around hid in Damian's room after ransacking it, much in the way the train robbery was carried out. Damian's father, who had resolved to give the money back, decided that if the robbers were going to steal his family's Christmas, then he would steal the robbers' money. The family, as well as Dorothy, go on a massive shopping spree on Christmas Eve.  That night, after they are asleep, their house is bombarded by beggars and charities begging for contributions, and seeing the confusion that ensues, Damian runs off to the train tracks to burn the money, deciding that it was doing more harm than good. While he is burning the money, he is visited by his dead mother, who tells him not to worry about her.  In the final scene, the audience sees Damian's dream of the family flying a rocket ship to [[Africa]] and helping develop water wells, while Damian narrates over the scene that each family member but him had hidden a little bit of the money beforehand. Damian convinced them to spend this money on the wells he is dreaming about. Earlier in the movie this was shown to be the most crucial and cheapest way to drastically improve the quality of life for many African communities.  
Mind Game (film)
 Nishi is a 20-year-old loser with dreams of becoming a comic book artist. One late evening he runs into his childhood crush, Myon, on the subway. She tells Nishi she is due to marry. Nishi has flashbacks of exchanging love letters and messages with Myon and ends up declaring that he has always loved Myon (but in an insincere fashion), which Myon brushes off.  They go to her father's [[yakitori]] restaurant, and see Myon's father and her elder sister Yan (who runs the restaurant). Nishi also meets Myon's fiancee, Ryo. Two yakuza gangsters enter, Atsu and a senior yakuza whom Atsu calls Aniki (lit. brother. A term used by Yakuza to refer to each other). They are looking for Myon's father, who seduced and stole Atsu's girlfriend, and now hides cowering behind a corner. It is later revealed through flashbacks that the senior yakuza is actually the first boyfriend of the girls' mother, who was also seduced away by her husband during a disco in their youth.  As Atsu threatens Myon with a gun, Ryo steps in and tries to punch Atsu, but instead gets knocked out. Atsu then prepares to rape Myon, who calls out Nishi's name. Atsu turns on Nishi, who is rolled in a ball, terrified, placing his pistol against Nishi's anus. Atsu fires when Nishi finally musters the courage to yell, "I will hurt you!", thus killing him instantly. The senior Yakuza, offended by Atsu's lack of control, shoots him dead, and then nonchalantly orders dinner.  Meanwhile, Nishi is in some sort of [[limbo]] where he encounters a being whose physical image changes every fraction of a second, Kami-sama (God). Kami-sama directs Nishi to walk into a red portal where he will disappear, but at the last moment Nishi runs for the opposite blue portal in order to return to life. Kami-sama becomes impressed by Nishi's sheer will to live, and so lets him escape.  Nishi returns to the moment just before Atsu pulled the trigger. This time, Nishi seizes Atsu's gun with his buttocks, and shoots him dead. He, Yan and Myon all pile into the yakuza's car, leaving the father and Ryo (still unconscious) behind. They speed off, followed by the massed yakuzas. The Yakuza boss rings (calls) Nishi using the yakuza's car phone and reveals that Atsu was a player on the Japanese national soccer team. Then after further chase the boss has his men force the trio in to a dead end on a bridge. However, Nishi steers the car off the bridge and they are swallowed up by an enormous whale.   Inside the whale, they meet an old man who was formerly yakuza and has been trapped in the whale for more than 30 years. (He is later shown through flashbacks to be the father of the senior Yakuza shown earlier). He shows them to the elaborate suspended house he has constructed over the 'sea' inside the whale's belly. Nishi attempts to escape the whale but he fails and they resign themselves to life inside the whale. Yan practices dancing and art, Myon practices swimming (a dream she gave up when her breasts got bigger), Nishi practices writing and drawing humorous manga and he and Myon finally become sexually intimate.   They attempt to leave the whale, again failing. And the old man reveals that the water level inside the whale is rising, and he believes the whale is probably dying. They concoct a plan to make a motor boat out using spare parts and fuel from the car they arrived in. On the day before the final match of the soccer World Cup, the whale returns to Osaka (their home town) and Yan, Nishi, Myon, as well as the Old Man, manage to escape.   As the four fly through the air, the film returns to its very first scene, with Myon running from the Yakuza, only this time she does not get her leg caught in the door of the train, and the Yakuza is left behind on the platform. This is followed by a lengthy montage, similar to that of the opening credits, showing the histories of the various characters. The movie ends ambiguously, with the phrase "This Story Has Never Ended" appearing before the credits roll.

He convinces [[Walter Bush]] ([[Sean McCann (actor)|Sean McCann]]), the executive director of the committee, that he has their best interests at heart. Bush reluctantly agrees to take the heat from the committee for Brooks' decisions.  During the initial practice, tempers flare as forward [[Rob McClanahan]] and defenseman [[Jack O'Callahan]] get into a fight based on an old college rivalry. Brooks bluntly tells the players that they are to let go of old rivalries and start becoming a team. As practices continue, Brooks uses unorthodox methods to winnow the roster down to 20 players. The players themselves worry about being cut at any time, knowing that Brooks himself was the last player cut from the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Olympic hockey team]] that won the gold medal, so he will do anything to win.   During an exhibition game against [[Norway national ice hockey team|Norway]] in [[Oslo]] that ends in a 3–3 tie, Brooks notices the players are distracted by girls in the stands and not playing up to their potential. After the game, he orders them back on the ice to skate "Herbies", which they do for an extended period of time even after the rink manager turns off the power. Exhausted, forward [[Mike Eruzione]] interrupts Brooks and cries out whom he plays for: The United States of America. Getting the answer he wanted all along, Brooks finally tells the players they are done. Eventually, the team comes together, with the players thinking of themselves as a family representing the United States.   The team plays the Soviets in an exhibition game at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The Soviets manhandle the young American team, winning by a score of 10–3. During the game, O'Callahan receives an injury that could keep him out of the entire Olympics, and starting goaltender [[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]] is told he may be benched in favor of back-up goalie [[Steve Janaszak]]. Craig ends up retaining his starting job when the coach brings him to realize that he hasn't been giving his very best.   As the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] begins, the Americans trail [[Sweden]] 2–1 in the first game. Brooks fires up the team during the break by overturning a table in his way and accusing injured McClanahan of quitting. (Doc had said his injury wouldn't get worse if he played on it.) McClanahan ends up playing despite his pain, which inspires the team and [[Bill Baker (hockey player)|Bill Baker]] scores a goal with less than a minute remaining in the third period for a dramatic 2–2 tie. They follow that up with a 7–3 win over heavily favored [[Czechoslovakia]].  As the Olympics continue, the Americans defeat Norway, [[Romania]], and [[West Germany]] to earn a spot in the medal round. The Americans are considered overwhelming underdogs to the Soviets in the first medal round game. The game begins and the Soviets score the first goal. Then O'Callahan, having healed enough from his injury, enters the game for the first time. He makes an immediate impact by heavily checking [[Vladimir Krutov]] on a play that leads to a goal by [[Buzz Schneider]]. The Soviets score again to retake the lead but in the final seconds the Soviet goalie [[Vladislav Tretiak]] stops a long shot by [[Dave Christian]], but [[Mark Johnson (hockey player)|Mark Johnson]] gets the rebound and scores with less than one second left in the period.   During the first intermission the Soviet coach replaces Tretiak with backup [[Vladimir Myshkin]]. In the second period the Soviets score a goal to go up 3–2. Early in the final period the Soviet team is called for a penalty, giving the Americans [[Power play (sporting term)|a man advantage]]. Johnson scores his second goal of the game just as the penalty is about to expire. Later, Eruzione puts them ahead 4–3 with 10 minutes left. The Americans hold off the Russians to win the game, completing one of the biggest upsets in sports history.   Two days later the team would go on to defeat [[Finland]] 4–2 to win the gold medal. The movie ends with Brooks staring out over his team with pride as the entire team crowds together on the gold medal platform.  
MirrorMask
 Helena ([[Stephanie Leonidas]]) works with her parents ([[Gina McKee]] and [[Rob Brydon]]) at their family circus, but desires to run away and join real life. At the next performance, after Helena and her mother have a heated argument, Helena's mother collapses and is taken to the hospital. Ten days later, while Helena is staying with her grandmother, she finds that the doctors determine that Helena's mother requires an operation, and Helena can only blame herself for the situation. That night, she wakes up in a dream-like state and leaves her building to find three performers outside. As they try to perform for Helena, a shadow encroaches on the area and two of the performers are consumed by it. The third performer, Valentine ([[Jason Barry]]), a juggler, helps to quickly direct Helena to safety through the use of magical flying books. She learns they are in the City of Light which is slowly being consumed by shadows, causing its widely varied citizens to flee. Soon Helena is mistaken for the Princess. She and Valentine are taken to the Prime Minister (Brydon). He explains that the Princess from the Land of Shadow stole a charm from the City of Light, leaving their White Queen (McKee) in a state of unnatural sleep and the City vulnerable to the Shadows. Helena notes the resemblance of the Queen and Minister to her mother and father, and offers to help recover the charm along with Valentine. They are unaware their actions are being watched by the Queen of Shadows (also McKee) who has mistaken Helena as the Princess of the Land of Shadows.  Helena and Valentine attempt to stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, learning that it is called the "MirrorMask". Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her bedroom in the real world, through the drawings of windows that she created and hung on the wall of her room. She discovers that a [[doppelgänger]] of herself is living there and behaving radically different from her. The doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Valentine betrays Helena to the Queen of Shadows in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen's servants warp Helena's mind so she will believe she is the Princess of Shadows. Valentine has a change of heart and returns to the Queen's palace, and helps Helena to break the spell on her. They search the Princess' room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the Princess' mirror. They flee the castle with the charm.  As they escape to Valentine's flying tower, Helena realizes that her doppelganger in the real world is the Princess of Shadows, who had used the MirrorMask to step through the windows in Helena's drawings. The Princess destroys the rest of the drawings in Helena's room, preventing Helena from returning, and Helena and Valentine disappear in the collapsed world. The Princess takes the drawings to the building's roof to disperse the shreds into the wind, but discovers one more drawing Helena had made on the back of the roof door. Helena successfully returns to the real world, sending the Princess back to her realm. At the same time, the White Queen finally awakens and the two Cities are restored to their natural balance.  Helena returns to her apartment to learn that her mother's operation was successful; Helena returns to happily help at the circus. Sometime later, Helena becomes fascinated by a young man, strongly resembling Valentine, who wants to be a juggler for the circus.  
Mindhunters
 The titular Mindhunters are a group of young [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] students who are undergoing training as [[offender profiling|profilers]]. Their instructor, experienced profiler Jake Harris ([[Val Kilmer]]), employs a highly realistic training approach by assigning the group variants of real investigations, including elaborate sets, props, and FBI actors to play out each [[scenario]].   The students include Bobby ([[Eion Bailey]]), a young man with a talent for fixing things; Vince ([[Clifton Collins Jr.]]), a wheelchair-using ex-cop who goes nowhere without his gun; Nicole ([[Patricia Velásquez]]), a smoker who is attempting to quit; Sara ([[Kathryn Morris]]), a talented but insecure profiler who is terrified of drowning; Rafe ([[Will Kemp (actor, born 1977)|Will Kemp]]), a very intelligent, caffeine-powered British investigator, Lucas ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]), a supposedly fearless man whose parents were killed when he was a child; and J.D. ([[Christian Slater]]), their leader and Nicole's lover. Nearing the end of their training, the group's over-all morale is high, though Vince discovers that neither he, nor Sara, will make the rank of "Profiler" after secretly reading their training evaluations.  The group travels with their instructor to a small island off the coast of [[North Carolina]] to complete their final training exercise. At the last minute, they are joined by Gabe ([[LL Cool J]], listed as James Todd Smith), an outside observer who has requested to see Harris's teaching methods in action. The island, used by the Navy to train for [[hostage]] rescue and outbreak scenarios, has an existing "population" of target dummies, vehicles on mechanical rails, and small town storefronts. Similar to their earlier training scenarios, Harris plans on using the town for their final exam, tracking a [[serial killer]] calling himself, "the puppeteer." The team settles down for the evening and practice their profiling skills on each other and Gabe, who reveals that he is also a skilled profiler in his own right. Sara and Lucas briefly bond over losses in their families; Sara reveals that her sister was murdered and drowned, creating her persistent fear of water, while Lucas shares that his parents died when he was 10. The two resolve to use the scenario to confront their personal fears.   The following morning, during the initial investigation of the "puppeteer" scenario, J.D. dies after triggering a clock mechanism that causes a tank of [[liquid helium]] to freeze him instantly. Convinced that J.D.'s death is neither accidental, nor part of the training simulation, the group heads to the dock to leave the island, but the boat explodes. After returning to base, the group realizes that broken watches and clocks found at each scene point to the fact that there is a real serial killer on the island, who has co-opted the training exercise and is now hunting them down. The killer's [[modus operandi|M.O.]] indicates that he or she plans to kill someone at a time designated by the broken clocks.  After a thorough search of the island reveals no other personnel, the group concludes that the killer is one of them.  At first, suspicions seem to point to Gabe, as Lucas found maps and documents of the island; however, before the group finishes confronting him, they each pass out, realizing that their coffee was drugged. They awaken to discover that the killer murdered Rafe while they were unconscious, and suspicions again return to Gabe. He temporarily deflects these suspicions when he saves Vince from another trap involving broken water pipes and lights electrocuting the water. However, Bobby is killed by a secondary trap when he goes to turn off the water. Sara, meanwhile, deduces that the traps are based on their strengths, talents, and weaknesses; the remaining profilers elect to stick together, to keep an eye on each other. After more clues are discovered, suspicion shifts to Sara, who insists that she's being framed. Nicole, suspicious that the killer is among the group, leaves to be alone, but she becomes the next to die after she smokes a cigarette laced with acid.  Unexpectedly, the island's speakers begin to broadcast a taunting message from Harris, making them realize that he did not leave the island, though he led the profilers to believe that he had; convinced that Harris has been the killer all along, the remaining profilers search for him. Vince refuses to join the search party and stays behind at the lab. Sara, Gabe and Lucas find Harris and two other FBI agents next to him, all dead; Harris has been strung up to wires from the ceiling as a sort of marionette, just like the fake "puppeteer" crime scene that they were to investigate. The three turn on each other after triggering another trap, and Lucas is shot during the ensuing gun battle. Vince finds himself trapped in a freezer after he tries to reload his empty gun, but he escapes and then dies when his gun backfires on him in the elevator.   Sara finds Vince's body, but she is ambushed by Gabe, and the two struggle physically and mentally to profile the other, each believing the other person is the killer. Gabe manages to overpower Sara but is then attacked by Lucas, and the two of them get into a protracted fight. Sara eventually recovers and hits Gabe over the head with a [[fire extinguisher]]. Lucas reveals that he had been wearing a [[bulletproof vest]], allowing him to survive getting shot on the street. With Gabe subdued, he expresses doubt that there's enough evidence to prove that Gabe was the killer. Sara, however, reveals that she found a way to get one step ahead of the killer. Knowing that the killer was relying on timed mechanisms and remotes, as well as enjoying watching their anxiety under pressure, she changed one of the clocks to appear slow by fifteen minutes, and covered it in a powder that glows [[Phosphorescence|phosphorescently]] under [[blacklight]]. Reasoning that the killer would not be able to resist setting the clock to the correct time, she grabs a black light to scan Gabe's hands and reveal him as the killer. Sara instead finds the marking powder on Lucas' hands instead of Gabe's. Lucas confesses that his parents did not die in an accident, but that he killed them. Struggling ever since to find more thrilling targets to kill, he joined the FBI and planned to kill his brilliant fellow profilers, the only people he thought would be "worthy prey." Lucas tries to drown Sara, but she manages to kick him into the water. The two both manage to recover their weapons underwater, but Sara manages to shoot Lucas first.   Lucas recovers and begins to taunt her about the evidence he planted blaming her until Gabe reappears. In a last desperate effort, Lucas attempts to regain his weapon, forcing Sara to kill him, shooting him through the top of the head as he bends down to retrieve his weapon. The following day, Gabe and Sara flag down the U.S. Navy [[helicopter]] to leave the island, determining that they've sufficiently secured the scene.

A Moment to Remember
 The first act of the film introduces the protagonists, a woman named Su-jin and a man named Chul-soo. The movie highlights their accidental meeting, followed by their subsequent courting despite their difference in social status that should have kept them apart. Kim Su-jin is a 27-year-old fashion designer, spurned by her lover, a colleague who was also a married man. Depressed, she goes to a convenience store, where she bumps into a tall, handsome man with whom she has a slight misunderstanding. Following that, she returns home and, receiving her father's forgiveness, decides to start life afresh.  One day while accompanying her father, who is the CEO of a construction firm, she coincidentally meets the man whom she earlier bumped into at the convenience store. He is Choi Chul-soo, the construction site's foreman who is studying to become an architect. Though he initially appears like a rough and dirty construction worker, Chul-soo exudes sheer masculinity in its most basic physical form. Su-jin instantly takes a liking to Chul-soo and actively courts him. There are many sweet events that take place in the occurrence of their courtship, eventually leading to their marriage.  The second act follows the couple happily settling into married life, with Chul-soo designing their dream house and Su-jin learning to become a housewife. As time passes, however, Su-jin begins to display forgetfulness, including an incident in which a fire breaks out because of a stove she'd forgotten to turn off. While Chul-soo caught the fire in time, the seriousness of the incident and others like it leads them to seek medical help.  The third act deals with Su-jin's [[early-onset Alzheimer's disease]] diagnosis, and the couple's consequent response to it. Su-jin at first experiences denial, then becomes heavily burdened by the knowledge that she will forget her husband. Nevertheless, they make the commitment to stay together and as the disease progresses, the trials the couple go through increase because of Su-jin's deteriorating memory. Finally, Su-jin makes the decision to leave their home and check herself into an assisted facility.  Despite his grief, Chul-soo remains at Su-jin's side even when she doesn't remember him, hiding his eyes behind sunglasses when he visits her so she can't see his tears. At the end of the film, Chul-soo reenacts the first time they met in the convenience store, with all of Su-jin's friends and family there. In the final scene, Su-jin is riding in a car beside her husband at sunset, and he tells her, "I love you."  
Monster Island (2004 film)
 The film begins with a high school senior, Josh, who is stunned to see that he unknowingly won an [[MTV]] contest to see [[Carmen Electra]], and it was actually his sister, Jen, who won the contest and invites everyone they know in their school. Josh and his classmates arrive on an isolated island (which is later revealed to be located in the [[Bermuda Triangle]]) where they have an enormous party, but Josh, who has been dumped by his girlfriend, is not really into the fun. Despite having his best friends Andy and Stack with him, he is angry that Jen, who wanted her brother to have an awesome time, scammed him.  After catching a quick glimpse of a flying [[winged ant]], Josh and Jen got backstage passes to see Carmen Electra. Josh then finds himself attracted to the singer. Later on, a concert featuring Carmen begins and Josh dances with joy. Suddenly, the flying ant Josh saw earlier appears before the crowd, sending everyone into a panic, and heads toward the stage. Eightball, Carmen's bodyguard, is grabbed by the insect followed by Carmen. Josh then watches as the flying ant takes Carmen to a faraway [[mountain]] (which later turns out to be a [[volcano]]) after dropping Eightball.  The partygoers, terrified, attempt to call on their cell-phones but are cut off from the mainland, and despite the assured announcements by Bob Staton, they then start to leave on the boats. However, Josh, who thinks he can go and rescue Carmen, halts them and manages to convince them to join him but thanks to statements by Staton, they leave for real. Josh, Andy, Stack, and Jen then prepare for the journey, but before going, they are joined by Lil Mindi, who is determined to highlight her career, and her cameraman GT as well as Josh's ex-girlfriend Maddy and her new boyfriend, arrogant class president Chase.  As the gang travel into the jungle, Stack climbs up a tree after settling down the arguing group and catches a glimpse of the mountain before falling down. Eightball appears, having fell on the tree after being dropped, and faithfully joins the group's search for Carmen. Before moving on, Maddy finds a mysterious necklace and wears it, which leads her to point out to the mountain. The group heads further down, encounters a gigantic [[praying mantis]], and escapes with a canoe on a lake. On the other hand, Carmen awakens to find herself deep within the mountain and is held prisoner.  The group camps out, and are attacked by a [[fish]]-like monster (Piranha Man), which kills GT. The creature is then tranquilized by a mysterious man in a white suit. He introduces himself as Dr. Harryhausen, who leads them to an abandoned United States military base and tells them that he has been on the island for many years while he reveals that the island was once home to a tribe of prehistoric humans that disappeared and the military attempted to claim this land but to no avail. The doctor also says that the monsters that the gang has encountered have been transformed thanks to [[radioactive]] bombs dropped on the island, and warns them that the island, polluted and dumped with [[toxic waste]], will soon sink to the bottom of the [[ocean]].  Josh and company take the doctor's advice and continue. They then see that Maddy is acting strangely heroic and determined, and shows them the way to the mountain. The team then hide from a pair of praying mantises, and flee from the female which killed its mate. Josh and the others cross a [[bridge]], and Eightball sacrifices himself to save the others by using a [[bulldozer]] to knock down the mantis down the ledge and him along with it. Panicked, Chase yells about the dangers they may face and Maddy rejects him furiously.  Upon reaching the mountain, Josh, Stack, Andy, Maddy, and Jen arm themselves before heading up. Meanwhile, Chase abandons Lil Mindi, who is then eaten by a monstrous [[spider]], and takes her camera footage. Josh and the remaining group reach the top, and Josh manages to kill an attacking soldier ant with his makeshift [[bow and arrow]]. They see Dr. Harryhausen who decides to join them, and go into the mountain. In there, they see the queen ant and her underlings order a group of ancient people, revealed to be the disappeared tribe, to bring food to a pile and discover Carmen, who is being worshipped. Maddy, revealed as an incarnation of the island's [[goddess]], uses the necklace to break the tribe free from control of the ants, and they retaliate.  Eventually, the gang manage to get out of the volcano with Carmen while Harryhausen remains behind and uses an explosive to destroy the attacking queen along with himself. Soon enough, the island begins to shake and Josh then grabs the necklace from Maddy, bringing her back to her senses. However, the boat waiting for Lil Mindi left, and just when hope seems to be lost, a [[helicopter]] carrying [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] arrives and saves the group and a couple of ancient people. In the helicopter on the way home, Rudy, a creature left in the care of the group, comes along and Josh and Maddy renew their relationship.  The film ends with Chase being left behind, and he is then pursued by the Piranha Man.  
Modigliani (film)
 Set in Paris in 1919, this biopic presents the life of Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, centering, artistically, on his relationship to and rivalry with [[Pablo Picasso]] when they both lived in Paris. Modigliani, an [[Italian Jews|Italian Jew]] from [[Livorno]], has fallen in love with Jeanne, a young and beautiful French [[Catholic]] girl. The couple has a child, and Jeanne's bigoted father sends the baby to a faraway convent to be raised by nuns. Modigliani is distraught but needs money to rescue and raise his child. Paris' annual art competition is in the offing. Prize money and a guaranteed career await the winner.  Neither Modigliani nor his rival Picasso have ever entered the competition, believing that it is beneath true artists like themselves. But push comes to shove with the welfare of his child on the line, and the impoverished Modigliani signs up for the competition in a drunken and drug-induced act at the center of a café frequented by artists, including Picasso, who is, by Modigliani signing the roster for the competition, himself induced to sign.  All of Paris is aflutter with excitement at who will win. Modigliani tackles the work of his entry with the hopes of creating a masterpiece, and knows that all the artists of Paris are doing the same. Once completed, he calls his agent and dearest friend,Léopold Zborowski, personally to take the painting to the competition and to make sure no one touches it. While his friend is taking the painting, Modigliani is at City Hall waiting to finally obtain a marriage license. City Hall closes before he is called, but he manages to persuade the woman clerk who is shooing him out to have mercy and give him the license anyway because he has a beautiful daughter and another on the way—and because he is an artist, as is she!  As the last person to leave, he decides to celebrate with one drink. Unfortunately his addiction, and his nervousness about the competition, make him drink many more.  The competition was going to start at eight o'clock, and when he realizes he is very late he finally rushes out, without paying.  While drinking, he had been asked whether he had the money to pay, and he had answered that he had 5,000 francs (the prize money) and could buy everyone in the café a drink.  Two guys that were in the bar follow him and assault and severely beat him, under the assumption that he has a lot of money.  Once they find that he has no money they leave him in the snow, bloody and more than half dead.  His painting of Jeanne in a blue dress he had stolen from a shop window wins the competition, besting even Picasso's cubist portrait entitled "Modigliani." Unaware of this victory, he somehow manages to make it home, where Jeanne washes the blood from his face.  But then his artist friends come, realize that he needs to be in a hospital, and take him there over Jeanne's protests. He dies in hospital.  Jeanne commits suicide by falling from a window.  They are buried together, along with the unborn child.  
Mohetjata
 A woman who was assassinated in the past life seeks a family to reborn into.  
Morning Raga
 The story is set deep in the [[Andhra Pradesh]] countryside, in the [[West Godavari]]. Swarnalata ([[Shabana Azmi]]) is a classically trained Carnatic singer who lost her son and best friend, Vaishnavi in a bus accident. The story reopens after a period of 20 years, when Vaishnavi's son, Abhinay [[Prakash Kovelamudi]], plans to leave his business of composing jingles with a desire to start a music troupe to compose an everlasting music just like the Charminar, and with these plans returns to his home in his village. His plan irks his father [[Nasser]] who wants him to look after the ancestral lands in the village. On the day of Death Anniversary of Vaishnavi, Abhinay spots Swarnalatha, and hears her song "Pibare Ramarasam" in the temple. When Swarnalatha leaves the temple, Abhinay stops her, saying, "you knew my mother" and follows her. The duo reach the bridge when a car comes and hits Abhinay, and the car was being driven by Pinky [[Perizaad Zorabian]]. Swarnalatha screams and reaches her home, with the 20 years old guilt in her mind that her one step on the bridge caused the accident. Here, the Car gets some glitch and Pinky is compelled to stay for the night in the village. Next morning both Abhinay and Pinky set for Hyderabad to seek the perfect artists for the proposed troop, and they get a guitarist and a drummer Balaji [[Shaleen Sharma]]. All land up at Pinky's boutique whose environment irritates Abhinay but somehow Pinky consoles him and the practices start, with a few opportunities coming up their way, but their rock-band does not receive the respect as Abhinay had expected. After a few days Abhinay receives the violin his mother used to play when she was alive. He returns to the village to return the violin to Swarnalatha, saying that both her voice and the sound of the violin are complementary to each other and one cannot exist without one another, and invites her to sing with their troop, for which she refuses saying that she won't come to the village and returns the violin. Swarnalatha's husband asks him to bring his troop to the house on Ganesh Chaturthi day. The troop arrives on the said date and Swarnalatha starts singing "Mahaganapathi Manasa Smarami", but stops in between and sings the sophisticated sargam of the song, for which no compatible music could be played. That evening Abhinay again compels Swarnalatha to sing in the city, but she again refuses, and Abhinay ends the communication with the note that She owes him a lot as he is her best friend's son, after all. Next morning Abhinay's father expresses his dislike in his son's musical career in front of Swarnalatha, and at the same time Swarnalatha agrees to sing for Abhinay in the city. She starts from her house with her husband. On the way their car breaks down and they are forced to take the bus, which crosses the bridge. Swarnalatha starts screaming, stops the bus and starts running and falls ill. Both return to home and her husband reports that she cannot come for singing. Next day Swarnalatha personally calls pinky and asks her to learn Carnatic Music. Pinky learns carnatic music from Swarnalatha. After a few days Abhinay plans a concert, though for Pinky to sing but always urges Swarnalatha to come for singing, but she continues to express her reluctance because she considers the bridge as a punishment for her ambitions. One day, while driving, Pinky gets irked at the repetitive reluctance of Swarnalatha, and speeds up the car and crosses the bridge, and Swarna starts screaming, "Stop the car! We all are going to die". Finally Pinky stops the car and reveals that her father was drunk and was responsible for the accident. The film ends with the concert in which Swarnalatha appears and sings "Thaaye Yashoda" on repeated urging from Pinky, and the concert becomes a 10-week hit.  A side plot involving Pinky and her city slicker mother ([[Lillete Dubey]]) and the villager Appa Rao([[Dharmavarapu_Subramanyam]]) with his buffalo Annapoorna add comedy into an otherwise serious and thoughtful film. The film was photographed by Rajiv Menon and edited by [[A. Sreekar Prasad]]. Music was composed by [[Mani Sharma]].  
Moolaadé
  The film is set in a colourful Burkina Faso village dotted with termite mounds, and a mosque made from clay that resembles a gigantic hedgehog. The village is a symbol of green Africa, a time capsule that nonetheless is not immune to the influences of the outside and ‘modern’ world.<ref name="wguc"></ref>  Collé is the second of her husband's three wives. She is the most intelligent, humorous, charming, and is also loved most by her husband, who is portrayed as a temperate enlightened man. Her nubile daughter, Amasatou, has become engaged, although she has not undergone [[female genital cutting]], considered a prerequisite for marriage in the local tradition. Collé opposes this practice. This has led the elders in the village, women as well as men, to despise her daughter. Amasatou herself unceasingly requests to have her genitals cut to secure her social status and marriage acceptance, but Collé remains unmoved. She is willing to protect not only her daughter from the life-threatening genital cutting but also four little girls who join her to refuse the practice. Collé draws a symbolic line, the colorful rope ''Moolaadé'', a "magical protection," across the gate of the family's premises. ''Moolaadé'' prevents the women elders who carry out the practice, and who have been searching for the girls, from entering the house.  In the beginning, the first wife seems to be against Collé's plan to protect the girls. However, later they become closer and she tells Collé that she also opposes female genital cutting. She feared making it known, but has been helping her all along, without anyone's notice.  While facing her daughter's request to be circumcised, Collé explains that she does not want her daughter to end up on the same road she travelled. Her first reason is that it has too many indefinite outcomes, some of which can be fatal. An even bigger reason is that Collé had two unsuccessful pregnancies before Amasatou, which caused her great physical and emotional pain and were almost fatal. In a flashback, there is a scene of her and her husband having sexual intercourse which is clearly causing her physical pain. He falls asleep, while she is unable to do so because the sexual intercourse brings unbearable pain for her rather than pleasure. She keeps biting her ring finger, symbol of her marriage, and dares not say a single word even when her finger bleeds. At dawn, she is still awake to wash her body, as well as her blood off the bed sheet.  If Collé represents African women who awaken to resist patriarchal control, then her daughter's fiancé Ibrahima, a rich, upstanding, and open-minded young man living in France, one of Africa's former colonizers, who returns, filmically representing the enlightened elite educated abroad who is welcomed home and observes the barbaric tradition of his village home. His knowledge, money and technologies such as television are appreciated. He witnesses a funeral of two little girls, who desperately drowned themselves in a well to avoid the mutilation of their genitals. The girls' relatives are sad, but the incident does not lead the villagers to question the tradition. Ibrahima is shocked and worried by this scene which keeps fermenting in his mind. Meanwhile, Ibrahima's father wants him to renounce his engagement to Amasatou, and marry his innocent eleven-year-old cousin instead, who has already undergone female genital cutting. Ibrahima refuses to do so, recognizing such an act as child abuse, and visits Amasatou's house despite what the villagers say. He confirms her as his fiancée, regardless of her "impure" status according to the local tradition.  The African women's most important daily entertainment, besides sitting together and chatting under the tree shadow enjoying the cool air, is enjoying the radio which transmits news of the world and the music. However, the elders deem this atmosphere to be counterproductive due to a number of recent events such as Ibrahima refusing to marry his cousin or Collé's protection of the five children (including her daughter). The elders think that Ciré Bathiliy, Collé's husband, has lost the ability to control his own wife so the elders insist that he beat her with a leather whip in front of the village to show that he still controls her. The elders want her to utter the magic word so they can take the four girls from her protection but, no matter how hard her husband whips her, she endures and refuses to give her tormenters the satisfaction of a scream or cry. Opposite groups of men and women shout to her to revoke or to be steadfast, but no woman interferes. When she is on the verge of collapse, a merchant steps out and stops the whipping.  The womanizing merchant is called Mercenaire by people in the village. He is a war veteran who has become a travelling merchant after being discharged from the army after he accused his superiors of corruption. When he converses with Ibrahima, he accuses him, his father, and his uncle of [[pedophilia]] and is suddenly no longer concerned about the money that he could possibly get from the rich young man. He is bringing all the plastic junk to the village; the junk is brightly and boldly colored as the magnificent costumes the people wear in Africa. He sells his wares at extremely high prices. Later he is hunted out of the village and, when out of sight, murdered.<ref name="wguc"/>  During the whipping, one of the four girls' mother steals her daughter from Collé's house and sends her to get her genitals cut, although the little girl screams and tries to resist. The girl dies as a result of the cutting and her mother regrets her previous support of the practice. The other mothers all see the tragedy happen and thus change their minds and begin opposing genital cutting. This persuades Cire to revoke the protection and return the children to their parents.  From the men's point of view, the radio is a bad influence on the women because it teaches them things from the outside world, such as the idea of equality or how excision isn't truly necessary. Therefore, the elders decide to burn the radios that they confiscated earlier. Although all the radios are supposed to be burned, some are hidden by the women of the village. The women are united because of the pain caused by the genital cutting. They are all mourning, they are all awakened, and when the elders return, they are greeted with shouts of, “No more genital cutting!”. Colle demands that the women give up their knives, which she then carries to the elders, proclaiming that genital cutting is now a thing of the past. After her demonstration, Ibrahima stands up to his father, says he is not going to listen to him, and despite his threats to disown him (which is quite foolish seeing how Ibrahima is the family's breadwinner) announces that he is going to marry Amasatou because he is proud of her. The end of the movie is the smoke of the burning radios, which speaks both to speaking out and repression of speech.

The Motorcycle Diaries (film)
 </ref>}}  In 1952, a semester before Ernesto "Fuser" Guevara is due to complete his medical degree, he and his older friend Alberto Granado, a [[biochemist]], leave [[Buenos Aires]] in order to travel across South America. While there is a goal at the end of their journey - they intend to work in a [[leper colony]] in Peru - the main purpose is initially fun and adventure. They desire to see as much of Latin America as they can, more than  in just four and a half months, while Granado's purpose is also to bed as many women as will fall for his pickup lines. Their initial method of transport is Granado's dilapidated [[Norton 500 motorcycle]] christened ''La Poderosa'' ("The Mighty One").  Their planned route is ambitious, bringing them north across the [[Andes]], along the coast of Chile, through the [[Atacama Desert]] and into the [[Peruvian Amazon]] in order to reach [[Venezuela]] just in time for Granado's 30th birthday on 2 April. However, due to ''La Poderosa's'' breakdown, they are forced to travel at a much slower pace, often walking, and don't make it to [[Caracas]] until July.  During their expedition, Guevara and Granado encounter the poverty of the indigenous peasants, and the movie assumes a greater seriousness once the men gain a better sense of the disparity between the "haves" (to which they belong) and the obviously exploited "have-nots" (who make up the majority of those they encounter) by traveling on foot. In Chile, for instance, they encounter a penniless and persecuted couple forced onto the road because of their [[communist]] beliefs. In a fire-lit scene, Guevara and Granado ashamedly admit to the couple that they are not out looking for work as well. The duo then accompanies the couple to the [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine, where Guevara becomes angry at the treatment of the workers.   However, it is a visit to the ancient [[Incan]] ruins of [[Machu Picchu]] in Peru that solidifies something in Guevara. His musings are then somberly refocused to how an indigenous civilization capable of building such beauty could be destroyed by the creators of the eventual polluted urban decay of nearby [[Lima]].<ref name = "PicchuScene">[https://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=aO4G2cRvUjQ&vq=medium Excerpted Clip of Machu Picchu from the film ''The Motorcycle Diaries''] directed by [[Walter Salles]], distributed by [[Focus Features]], 2004</ref> His reflections are interrupted by Granado, who shares with him a dream to peacefully revolutionize and transform modern South America, to which Guevara quickly retorts: "A revolution without guns? It will never work."  Later, in Peru, they volunteer for three weeks at the [[San Pablo, Peru|San Pablo]] [[leprosy|leper]] colony. There, Guevara observes both literally and metaphorically the division of society, as the staff live on the north side of a river, separated from the deprived lepers living across the river to the  south. To demonstrate his solidarity, and his medical belief that leprosy is not contagious, Guevara refuses to wear rubber gloves during his visit as the head nun requires, choosing instead to shake bare hands and interact normally with the surprised leper patients.  {{Quote box   | quote  = "Every generation needs a journey story; every generation needs a story about what it is to be transformed by geography, what it is to be transformed by encounters with cultures and people that are alien from yourself, and you know that age group 15 to 25, that’s the perfect generation to get on a motorcycle, to hit the road, to put on your backpack and just go out."| source = — [[José Rivera (playwright)|José Rivera]], screenwriter, ''[[NPR]]''<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4058889 Thirty Years After His Death, Che Guevara Still an Icon] by ''[[NPR]] Weekend Edition Sunday'', 3 October 2004</ref>  | width = 30%  | align = left  }}  At the end of the film, after his sojourn at the leper colony, Guevara confirms his nascent [[egalitarian]], anti-authoritarian impulses, while making a birthday toast, which is also his first political speech. In it he invokes a pan-Latin American identity that transcends the arbitrary boundaries of both nation and race. These encounters with social injustice transform the way Guevara sees the world and his purposes in it, and by implication motivates his later political activities as a Marxist revolutionary.  Guevara makes his symbolic "final journey" at night when, despite the danger and his [[asthma]], he swims across the river that separates the two societies of the leper colony, to spend the night in a leper shack, instead of in the doctors' cabins. Later, as they bid each other farewell at an airport, Granado reveals that his birthday was not in fact 2 April, but rather 8 August, and that the aforementioned goal was simply a motivator: Guevara replies that he knew all along. The film closes with an appearance by the real 82-year-old Alberto Granado, along with pictures from the actual journey and a brief mention of Che Guevara's eventual 1967 [[CIA]]-assisted execution in the [[Bolivia]]n jungle.  
Mr. 3000
 Stan Ross is the franchise player of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[baseball]] team. After recording his 3,000th [[hit (baseball)|hit]], the selfish, narcissistic Ross immediately retires, leaving the team without one of its star players in the middle of the [[1995 Milwaukee Brewers season|1995]] [[Playoffs#Major League Baseball|playoff]] race, showing every bit of disregard for his teammates' feelings. During the next nine years, Ross uses his nickname as a business tool, owning several profitable properties under the name "Mr. 3000" that make him increasingly wealthy.  In 2004, the Brewers [[List of Major League Baseball retired numbers|retire Ross' number]] so they can get rid of Ross for good, and also draw a large crowd. Although many fans come to the ceremony, other players, including teammates and fellow stars [[Robin Yount]], [[Cecil Cooper]], and [[Paul Molitor]], stay away. Only his best friend Anthony (Boca) Carter and a [[middle relief pitcher]] from his early days in the majors named Bill (Big Horse) Berelli attend, and the ex-pitcher chastises Ross for his arrogant attitude.  Ross learns that, due to a [[clerical error]], he retired with 2,997 hits instead of 3,000. The error also partially contributes to Ross not being voted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]<ref name="hof">Voters have elected all eligible ([[Pete Rose]] is ineligible) players with 3,000 or more hits to the Hall of Fame, except for controversial player [[Rafael Palmeiro]].</ref> and makes his "Mr. 3000" marketing gimmick inaccurate. Ross seeks to return to the game at the age of 47 to get three more hits, secure his place in the record books, and keep his local post-career marketing gimmick intact.  A top Brewers executive, citing the large attendance at Ross' number retirement ceremony and the fact that the Brewers are out of playoff contention, agrees to bring Ross back during the [[Major League Baseball rosters|September roster expansion]]. The team's younger players only know of Ross as a self-centered player, and team superstar Rex "T-Rex" Pennebaker, who is pompous and arrogant like Ross, sees him as unneeded and too old to play. Manager Gus Panas refuses to speak to Ross because of his abrupt retirement, and the [[sportswriting|sportswriters]] continually criticize him.  Despite his predictions to the contrary Ross struggles to regain his baseball form. He goes hitless in his first 27 at-bats. His comeback is reported by television sportscaster Maureen "Mo" Simmons, who resumes a former romantic relationship with Ross. He gets two hits, including a home run, to increase his career total to 2,999.  Ross becomes a mentor to the younger players and urges Pennebaker to learn from his own mistakes as a baseball star and to be a team player, so that Pennebaker will not end up like him – all alone. This inspires the Brewers to a late-season comeback and a respectable finish. Ross attempts to become serious with Simmons and make her a permanent part of his life, but she is reluctant to believe he is a changed man, particularly after he skips a team practice to go on national television with [[Jay Leno]] and begin boasting again.  In his last at-bat of the season, with a chance to be a hero, Ross has a vision of his earlier years, when he was considered always dependable for the team. It inspires him to sacrifice his last chance with a [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] instead so the team can win a game and finish third in [[National League Central|its division]]. Although Ross never reaches the "3,000" milestone, his newfound generosity and attitude gets him inducted into the Hall of Fame. He renames his businesses "Mr. 2,999."  
Motives (film)

Emery kills a man who tries to get information out of him, which is then witnessed by another man who flees. Emery does not notice the dead man's cell phone, which has all their calls logged in.  He then makes a phone call to his friend who does not answer. Later, he meets Allanah whose car has broken down. He gives her a ride to her job unaware she is working an angle to get what she wants. He then calls her and insists they have dinner. They do, but the police follow them, seeing them make out as does another man that is following Allanah. The crazed man comes to the restaurant and attacks Emery.  Emery goes to see Allanah and sees that the place she lives in is unsatisfactory, so he takes her to one of his properties - a condo. She makes herself at home and even invites a friend over, who tells her that she can keep the condo and lifestyle if there "is a hole in the condom". Emery drops by for sex and she has her friend wait outside so she can do what she needs to with Emery.  Emery then visits his friend Brandon Collier ([[Sean Blakemore]]), gives him a box cutter and tells him to help him unpack. The two reminisce about the fun times they had in college. Allanah meets Emery in a park where children are playing and announces she is pregnant. Shocked, Emery tells her to abort the baby, but Allanah tells him no.  She then sets up a meeting with Connie ([[Vivica A. Fox]]), Emery's wife, sending her a romantic note, which Connie thinks is from Emery. When Connie arrives at a park where the meeting is to take place she finds a beautifully dressed table with flowers and a bottled of chilled wine waiting. Allanah then appears and the two women sit down for a chat.  Allanah tells Connie she is pregnant with Emery's child and asks her for money. Connie gives her a check for $100,000 then returns home to pack her bags to leave Emery. When Emery walks in the two get into an argument over Allanah, her pregnancy and the pay off. In the meantime, Allanah returns to the condo where her husband, Derrick Woods ([[Joe Torry]]), shows up demanding money. Emery soon follows to confront her about the meeting with Connie, and finds Allanah and Derrick having sex. He tells them both to leave and demands that Allanah give back the check. Derrick goes ballistic on Allanah upon finding out what she did, as Emery searches her purse for the check. Emery hurls an insult at Derrick and the two fight. In the struggle, Emery drops the check, Allanah picks it up then flees the condo very much alive.    Allanah soon turns up dead, her throat cut. Emery is asked to come to the police station and is interrogated by Detective Morgan ([[Mel Jackson]]) about her murder.  Emery insists that when he left the condo Allanah was alive, just as Derrick insists the same in his interrogation. They are both released upon investigation of the murder. Connie returns to Emery, but still doesn't trust him.  While she is home, Emery goes in search of pictures taken of him having sex with Allanah in his car, but cannot find them.

Before this happened, he goes to see Brandon who tells him that he wants Connie and his life. The two fight, Emery stops, leaving Brandon alive. After Emery is sentenced and sent to prison, Connie visits him and presents him with divorce papers, forcing him to sign them. Reluctantly, he does. Connie then gets up and walks away as Emery screams for her to come back.  As Emery is being led back to his cell, he sees Connie walks to Brandon. She looks back at him as the two embrace and with a smug look Brandon stares intently at Emery. In Emery's flashback, the viewer sees and reveals that it was Brandon (with Connie's assistance) who set him and Allanah up, murdered her, and sent a box of evidence to Detectives Pierce ([[Victoria Rowell]]) and Morgan all in an attempt to get Connie all to himself. Emery, in a fit of rage, then attempts to attack Brandon yelling "You did this to me!", but security guards hold him back. Yelling to Connie that it was Brandon who was the cause of everything, Connie walks out the door. Brandon winks at Emery and leaves as he's being dragged back to his cell, still yelling for Connie to return. The film ends with credits revealing that Emery is currently awaiting for an appeal for the murders of Allanah James and Kenneth Stroud.

Mulan II
 A month after the events of the [[Mulan (1998 film)|first film]], [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Li Shang|General Shang]] asks [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Fa Mulan|Fa Mulan]] for her hand in marriage, and she happily accepts. Hearing about their engagement, [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Mushu|Mushu]] is thrilled for them, until the leader of the ancestors informs him that if Mulan gets married, he will lose his job as a guardian dragon and have to leave Mulan and his pedestal, which is his place of honor as a guardian. The ancestors are happy with this because Mulan would be getting married to Shang, she would become a part of his family, which would mean that Shang's family ancestors and guardians would become hers. Wanting to keep his job and his friend, Mushu attempts to tear the couple apart, having noticed that they are not very compatible, while [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Cri-Kee|Cri-Kee]] tries to foil his attempts, and keep the couple together. Meanwhile, the Emperor calls upon Mulan and Shang to escort his three daughters, [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Ting-Ting, Mei, and Su|Princesses Ting-Ting, Mei, and Su]], across China to be betrothed to three princes so that an alliance can be formed with the kingdom of Qui Gong. If the task is not completed within three days, the alliance will crumble, and the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] will destroy China.  Mulan and Shang set out, along with [[List of Disney's Mulan characters#Yao, Ling and Chien-Po|Yao, Ling and Chien-Po]], to safely escort the princesses to their new kingdom. Along the way, Ting-Ting, Mei, and Su fall in love with Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, respectively. Mulan, who has long believed arranged marriages are wrong, decides to go against her orders and, despite Shang's wishes, stop the joining of the kingdoms.   Mushu attempts to cause problems for Mulan and Shang, but keeps on failing several times. In despair, he causes the carriage to roll away with Ting-Ting, Mei, Su, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po. Seeing that they're heading towards a cliff, Mulan and Shang rush to the rescue, and try to get the princesses to safety. This fails, and the carriage is destroyed while everyone falls into the river, unharmed.   On the night of the carriage's destruction, Chien-Po, Ling, and Yao take the princesses out to a village, and declare their love for them. Meanwhile, Mushu tricks Shang into thinking Mulan is taking advantage of him. Shang orders everyone to return and forbids Chien-Po, Ling and Yao from speaking to the Princesses. After a very heated argument, Mulan and Shang realize they are far too different and end their relationship. While traveling through bandit country, Mushu, overwhelmed with guilt, confesses to Mulan what he had done. Although Mulan is angered by what Mushu tried to do, at the same time, she is enlightened about the news, and she attempts to reconcile with Shang, only to be attacked by bandits moments later. While saving the princesses, the bridge Mulan and Shang are standing on breaks, leaving the two dangling off by a loose rope. Realizing that the rope can only support the weight of one person, Shang sacrifices his life to save Mulan, and allows himself to fall into the river below.  Saddened by Shang's death, Mulan continues on the trip alone to Qui Gong. Not wanting the princesses to be forced into a loveless marriage, she offers herself to marry one of the ruler's sons. Shang, who actually survived the fall, soon hears about the news, and rushes to stop the marriage, but the ruler denies it. Mushu decides to help by pretending to be the Great Golden Dragon of Unity, and forces the ruler to stop the marriage. Still under the guise of the Great Golden Dragon, Mushu marries Mulan and Shang, with their marriage apparently being the one to unite the two kingdoms, and releases the princesses from their vows. Some time later, Mulan and Shang officially get married back home, and after the wedding, Shang combines the family temples, meaning that Mushu gets to keep his job, much to the ancestors' dismay. In his happiness, Mushu accidentally reveals himself to Shang, even though Mulan had already told Shang about him, as she "has no secrets from her husband."

He begins prostituting himself at the age of 15, and continues doing so three years later when he moves to New York City, where his best friend, Wendy Peterson, now lives. In New York, Neil has an emotional encounter with a client, Zeke, who is dying from AIDS.

National Treasure (film)
 Benjamin Franklin Gates is an American historian, [[cryptographer|cryptologist]], and treasure hunter. As a child, his grandfather John told him of a story that [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] passed on a secret to their ancestor in 1832 of a fabled national treasure hidden in America by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] and [[Freemasons]]. The clue leading to the treasure is the phrase "The secret lies with Charlotte". While Ben is convinced by the story, his skeptical father Patrick dismisses it as nonsense.  Thirty years later, Ben leads an expedition with Ian Howe, and his friend, Riley Poole, a computer expert, to find the ''Charlotte'', a ship lost in the [[Arctic]], which holds the first clue to finding the national treasure. They find a [[meerschaum pipe]], which has a clue implying the next is on the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. When Ian suggests they steal the Declaration of Independence, Ben opposes, causing a fight to ensue resulting in a massive fire fueled by gunpowder, and the group split in two. Ian and his men escape the ship while Ben and Riley take cover just before the ship explodes.  Ben and Riley return to [[Washington D.C.]] and report the potential theft of the Declaration to the [[FBI]] and Dr. Abigail Chase of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]], but both dismiss their claim. Ben decides to steal the document himself from the Archives' preservation room during a gala event. Obtaining Abigail's fingerprints, Ben successfully obtains the Declaration but is spotted by Ian's group just as they break in to steal it. Ben tries to leave via the [[gift shop]] but has to buy the Declaration when the clerk mistakes it for a souvenir copy; having no cash in hand at the time, Ben pays for it with a credit card. Abigail, suspecting something is astray, pursues Ben and takes back the document. Ian kidnaps her, but Ben and Riley rescue Abigail, tricking Ian by leaving behind a purchased copy of the Declaration. FBI Agent Sadusky begins tracking Ben down, using Ben's credit card information.  Unable to return home, the trio goes to Patrick's house. Patrick tries to convince Ben that the treasure is a myth, but Ben dismisses this. The trio then study the Declaration and discover an [[book cipher|Ottendorf cipher]] written in invisible ink. The message refers to the [[Silence Dogood]] letters written by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Patrick formerly owned them but donated them to the [[Franklin Institute]]. Using a school boy to acquire the letters' key words, Ben, Riley, and Abigail discover a message pointing to the bell tower of [[Independence Hall]], where the [[Liberty Bell]] once stood, unfortunately Ian and his men question the school boy and pursue the new lead. A chase ensues throughout Philadelphia. Ben finds a hidden cache containing a pair of glasses with multiple colored lenses invented by Benjamin Franklin, which, when used to read the back of the Declaration, reveals a clue pointing to the symbol of [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] which is located on Wall Street and Broadway in New York City.  The group is chased by Ian's associates. Ben is arrested by the FBI, while Abigail and Riley lose the Declaration to Ian. However, Abigail convinces Ian to help them rescue Ben in exchange for the next clue. Ian agrees, arranging a meeting at the [[USS Intrepid (CV-11)|USS Intrepid]] where they help Ben evade the FBI.  Ian returns the Declaration and asks for the next clue, but when Ben remains coy, Ian reveals he has kidnapped Patrick as a hostage. They go inside Trinity Church where they find an underground passage but it appears to lead to a dead end lit by a lone lantern. Patrick claims it is referencing the Midnight Ride of [[Paul Revere]], pointing Ian to the [[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]]. Ian leaves Gates trapped in the chamber, heading for Boston. Patrick reveals the clue was a fake, then enter the treasure room but it seems looted. After a heart to heart between Ben and Patrick, they find a notch which the meerschaum pipe fits into, opening a large chamber containing the treasure, then escape through the back exit. Ben contacts Sadusky, actually a Freemason, surrendering the Declaration and the treasure's location in exchange for clemency. Ian is later arrested when Ben tips the FBI off.  Later, Ben and Abigail have started a relationship. Meanwhile, Riley is somewhat upset that Ben turned down the 10% finder's fee for the treasure but accepted a much smaller amount, which still has netted them all significant wealth.  
Napoleon Dynamite
 Napoleon Dynamite is a socially awkward 16-year-old boy from [[Preston, Idaho]], who lives with his grandmother, Carlinda Dynamite, and his older brother, Kipling Ronald "Kip" Dynamite. Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours on Internet [[chat room]]s with his girlfriends and aspiring to be a [[Cage fighting|cage fighter]]. Napoleon [[daydream]]s his way through school, doodling [[liger]]s and fantasy creatures and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock, Don. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself and his outlandish "skills" while having a sullen and aloof personality.  Napoleon's grandmother breaks her [[coccyx]] in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious steak-loving former athlete who lives in a [[campervan]], treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a [[get-rich-quick scheme]] to sell numerous items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and his recent breakup with his girlfriend.  Napoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college; and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from [[Colonia_Juárez,_Chihuahua|Juarez]], [[Mexico]]. A friendship soon develops between the three outcasts. During this time, preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro first asks Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl, to be his dance partner, but is rebuffed. He then asks Deb, who accepts happily. Pedro encourages an upset Napoleon to find a date for himself, and he picks an attractive classmate called Trisha from the school yearbook. As a gift, he draws a bad picture of her and delivers it to Trisha's mother, who is incidentally a customer of Rico. Rico tells embarrassing stories about Napoleon to evoke sympathy from her. She buys the goods and also forces Trisha to reluctantly accept Napoleon's request.  Inspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, putting him against Summer. The two factions put up flyers and give out accessories to the students to attract voters. In an attempt to increase their respect by demonstrating "skills", Napoleon and Pedro enter a [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] competition, grading milk and cow udders. They do well and win medals, but this does little for their popularity. Incidentally, Napoleon visits an [[Charity shop|op-shop]] and buys a dance instructional [[VHS]] called "D-Qwon's Dance Grooves", becoming a skillful dancer.  Kip, meanwhile, is head-over-heels in love since LaFawnduh has come to visit him from [[Detroit]]. She gives Kip an urban makeover, outfitting him in [[hip-hop]] regalia. Seeing that he dances, LaFawnduh also gives Napoleon a mixtape.  Rico's ongoing scheme causes friction with Napoleon as he continues to spread embarrassing rumors about him to his prospective customers. Rico later tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends when he visits the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, to try and sell her the breast enhancements; Rex walks in and beats him up after witnessing Rico's demonstration.  On the day of the class president elections, Summer gives a speech before the student body, and then presents a dance skit with a school club. Pedro and Napoleon then discover that a skit was also required from them, and a despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech. In an attempt to save Pedro's campaign, Napoleon gives the sound engineer LaFawnduh's tape, and spontaneously performs an elaborate dance routine to "[[Canned Heat (song)|Canned Heat]]" by [[Jamiroquai]]. Summer and her boyfriend Don are unimpressed, but the routine receives a [[standing ovation]] from all the other students, including Deb.  The film concludes with Pedro becoming the class president, LaFawnduh leaving with Kip on a bus for Michigan, Rico reuniting with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returning from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb making up and playing [[tetherball]].  In a [[post-credits scene]], Kip and LaFawnduh are married in an outdoor ceremony in Preston. Napoleon, absent for the vows, arrives riding a horse, claiming that it is a "wild honeymoon stallion" that he has tamed himself. Kip flicks LaFawnduh's garter as a "keepsake" towards Napoleon, Pedro and Rico (who catches it) before he and LaFawnduh ride off across the fields.  
Narco (film)
 The main character Gus experiences vivid dreams during his narcoleptic episodes, which inspire him to create [[comic book]] style art of extremely high quality. When Samuel Pupkin, the psychiatrist who runs a group attended by Gus, learns of this, he recalls his own desire to be a comic book artist, instead of following the family tradition of psychiatry, a dream prevented by his lack of artistic talent.

New York Minute (film)
  Seventeen-year-old identical twin sisters Jane ([[Ashley Olsen]]) and Roxy Ryan ([[Mary-Kate Olsen]]) are completely different and never see eye to eye. They live with their [[widow]]ered father, and attend the fictional Atta Westland Grove High Van School in [[Syosset]], a suburban Long Island town. Over a 24-hour period, the two begrudgingly journey together into the city for Jane, an uptight overachiever, to deliver a speech to qualify for a prestigious college scholarship abroad, and for Roxy, a laid-back punk-rock rebel, to get backstage at a music video shoot so that she can give her demo tape to the group.  Jane and Roxy board the train into New York but are soon thrown off together after Roxy is found without a ticket. At the station, Jane bumps into Jim ([[Riley Smith]]), and they flirt back and forth before he gets on the train. Meanwhile, Roxy becomes unknowingly involved in a shady black-market transaction after an illegal chip device is mistakenly planted in her bag. Bennie Bang ([[Andy Richter]]), the man behind the plan, offers Roxy a ride in a swanky limousine and she accepts, dragging Jane along who is reluctant about getting into cars with strangers. He locks them inside but they escape through the sun roof and he chases them into the city subway where they help one another to fight him off.  Meanwhile, Max Lomax ([[Eugene Levy]]), an overzealous truant officer, is on the hunt to find Roxy after news of her continuously missing school and forging absence letters from her father. Several unlucky incidents occur as they begin their journey such as Jane's heels snapping and being drenched by a hobo's blue slush drink. At the nearest store, Jane realizes she's left her day planner in the limo, which has "her whole life" in it including money and the prompt cards needed her for college speech later that day. To clean up, they break into a posh hotel room and soon receive a phone call from Bennie who threatens to meet him to give the chip back or they won't get the day planner, but before they can leave, they meet Trey ([[Jared Padalecki]]), the son of the powerful Senator who's staying at the hotel, and his dog, Reinaldo, who swallows the chip. They are forced to take Reinaldo with them.  They make their way to their destinations and decide to part ways. Roxy heads to the Simple Plan video shoot being followed by Max, while Jane goes to meet Bennie for an exchange. When he finds out the dog, Reinaldo, has swallowed the chip, he tries to attack Jane who flees from the car and goes to find Roxy. While running from Max and Bennie, the two end up on stage with the band and crowd surf to get away. Trey is also trying to find Roxy who runs into Bennie and gets kidnapped in the trunk of his car. Meanwhile, Jane and Roxy end up in the underground sewer with Reinaldo with Jane's speech in less than two hours.  A little later, they walk into the House of Bling where Big Shirl (Mary Davis Bonde) gives them both a makeover. Max hunts them down and they escape in a cab even when Jane failed her driving test. They accidentally pick up the same man that Roxy spilled her drink on in the train. When they stop, they argue. Jane explains that Roxy has never been there for her and never takes life seriously, and she feels she stopped taking responsibility for anything after their mother died, leaving Jane in charge. Conversely, Roxy believes Jane doesn't need to take control of everything and feels she's been pushed away, since she wasn't even invited to Jane's speech.  Jane goes to meet Bennie who throws her in the back of a van with Reinaldo and drives her to see his mother who is in charge of the whole operation: they buy and sell illegal pirated DVDs and CDs. Roxy finds Bennie's limo and retrieves Jane's day planner, but finds Trey locked in the trunk. They both rush to the building where Jane is meant to give her speech, while Jane fends off Bennie and escapes once again and then runs into Jim who gives her a ride to the same place. When they arrive, Roxy pretends to be Jane so she can give a speech on time, but drops the prompt cards beforehand and has to make it up on the spot, which confuses the judges. The head judge is Senator Hudson McGill ([[Darrell Hammond]]), the man from the train and the taxi, alongside Trey's mother, Senator Anne Lipton. Jane turns up just in time who tries to explain what their day has been like and the reason for why she wasn't there. Suddenly, Max intervenes who tries to arrest Roxy and Bennie appears who tries to kidnap Jane, but they both exploit his illegal doings and he is arrested by Max.  Knowing she has no opportunity to give her speech, Jane leaves with Roxy. Outside, Hudson McGill catches up to Jane who found her prompt cards and gives her a college scholarship to Oxford, because she "didn't just want to win, she absolutely refused to fail."  Months later, Roxy is in the studio recording with her band, watched by Jane, Trey and Jim, who celebrate all together.  
Never Die Alone
  Hardened criminal and drug dealer King David ([[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]) returns to his unidentified [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] city, where he can find redemption by settling an old score with drug lord Moon ([[Clifton Powell]]). He keeps tape-recorded journals about his life and is always talking about a woman named Edna. Upon David's return, he meets up with Jasper ([[Luenell]]), a barkeep who expresses a strong dislike towards him. She contacts Moon to inform him of his return and willingness to pay his debt, as well as momentarily passing by Paul ([[David Arquette]]), a struggling writer.  Mike ([[Michael Ealy]]), one of Moon's henchmen, is assigned to collect his boss's money from David, appearing to be very interested in him for some reason. Prior to the deal, he is warned to not sabotage the deal in order to avert police attention. He, his friend Blue ([[Antwon Tanner]]) and his sister Ella ([[Drew Sidora]]) go to David and collect the money. Mike is very tense upon arriving at the location of the pickup, prompting Blue to authorize it for him. After a brief but tense transaction between Blue and David, the latter is set up for an ambush. Mike angrily demands if David recognizes him, and proceeds to stab him multiple times in the [[abdomen]] after receiving several taunts. A weakened David stabs Blue in the eye with an ice pick before they abandon him in a gutter. Paul, who passes by at that moment, drives David, a total stranger, to the hospital.  Paul is informed that King has died and has left him all his personal possessions. The items include jewelry, his car (which is a rare [[Stutz Blackhawk]]), and a collection of his audio tapes. Meanwhile, Moon is unnerved by Mike botching the deal by using violence against David and becomes paranoid of police attention. After being informed of Blue's injury, he tells the two to wait in a parking garage for a car to come and drive them to the hospital. Instead, he sets them up as two henchmen shoot and kill Blue and Ella, to Mike's horror. Just before Mike can be killed himself, he gains gravity of the situation and guns down the henchmen, but is unable to retain his sister's life as she dies in his arms. He then vows revenge against Moon for the double-cross.   As Paul listens to the journal, the story of David's life is told: after a particularly bad drug experience in the east, David relocated to the west in search of a second chance. He finds assistance with the Vietnamese and even a new girlfriend, Janet ([[Jennifer Sky]]), whom he abuses. A television star, she turns to David's heroin and becomes sick and detached in the process. David abandons her as she presumably turns to selling his drugs to pay the bills and for her drug habit.  In the present, Moon sends out a duo of henchmen to kill Mike. Additionally, Moon learns of Paul's involvement in the situation from bystanders as his role of David's driver to the hospital, and requests for his murder, as well. Paul, meanwhile, continues to listen to the tapes; after he abandons Janet, David moves on to Juanita ([[Reagan Gomez-Preston]]), a college student that he meets in an upscale bar. Their relationship goes well as David starts to make a lot of money, but then Juanita tries his drugs. She doesn't get addicted, but she does turn out to be very selfish by refusing to move in with David, insisting that $250,000 isn't enough on which to retire. Angry, David secretly switches her cocaine with heroin, getting her addicted.  Paul realizes that the money David talked about might be in David's trunk. It is, but at the same time, Moon's henchmen are sprawling all over the city in search of him. Mike follows Moon's limo via cab to a secluded back-alley, at which he follows him into a bathhouse and proceeds to kill him.  Paul listens to the last tape; David leaves Juanita, but she soon comes back, addicted and begging for help. He agrees to help her out, providing her a drug fix in exchange for sex. The humiliation and disgrace shatters her dreams and causes her severe emotional distress, thus making her addictions even stronger. After a while, she demands that he pay for her entrance to rehabilitation or else she'll call the police. Enraged, David decides to do the same thing he did to Edna: mix her heroin with car battery acid, resulting in a fatal seizure for her. Through a flashback, it is revealed that David is the biological father of Mike, who is also Edna's child, and that David brutally hit him before poisoning Edna (which explains the scar on his face). The tape ends with David speculating on how his return to the East Coast will bring about his redemption with Moon and tie the loose end with Edna's child, who he is completely unaware of as Mike in their second encounter.  Paul is found by Moon's henchmen, who hold him at gunpoint, but Mike arrives just on time and kills them. Paul tells Mike that King is his father, which greatly haunts the latter. As the police converge on the scene, the two make good their escape as Paul flees on foot and Michael takes David's car. Shortly afterward, Paul writes a story based on that night, titled "Never Die Alone," which is turned down by a publishing magazine as the agent believes it to be a fictionalized story. David is cremated soon after. His narration focuses on the end of his life and how fate had such a powerful effect on not only his life but also on the lives of Paul, Mike, Edna, Juanita, Moon, and everyone else. Meanwhile, Mike drives through a tunnel and escapes without capture as David closes his narration with "I wonder what lies ahead for me on the other side".  
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero
 Set up in [[British Raj]], after a political disagreement with [[Mahatma Gandhi]], Bose's arrest and subsequent release sets the scene for his escape to Germany, via [[Afghanistan]] and the Soviet Union. A few days before his escape, he sought solitude and, on this pretext, avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard. On the night of his escape, he dresses himself as a Pathan to avoid being identified. Bose escapes from under British surveillance at his house in [[Calcutta]] on 19 January 1941, accompanied by his nephew Sisir K. Bose in a car.  Bose journeys to [[Peshawar]] with the help of the [[Abwehr]], where he was met by Akbar Shah, Mohammed Shah and [[Bhagat Ram Talwar]]. Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan, a trusted friend of Akbar Shah's. On 26 January 1941, Bose begins his journey to reach Russia through [[British India]]'s [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West frontier]] with Afghanistan. For this reason, he enlists the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a Forward Bloc leader in the North-West Frontier Province. Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union, and suggests a novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak one word of [[Pashto language|Pashto]], it would make him an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggests that Bose act deaf and dumb, and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen. Bose's guide Bhagat Ram Talwar, unknown to him, is actually a Soviet agent.  Supporters of the [[Aga Khan III]] help Bose across the border into [[Afghanistan]] where he was met by an Abwehr unit posing as a party of road construction engineers from the [[Organization Todt]] who then aided his passage across Afghanistan via [[Kabul]] to the border with [[Soviet Russia]]. After assuming the disguise of a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] insurance agent ("Ziaudddin") to reach Afghanistan, Bose changes his disguise and travels to Moscow on the Italian passport of an Italian nobleman "Count Orlando Mazzotta". From Moscow, he reached [[Rome]], and from there he travels to [[Germany]]. Once in Russia the [[NKVD]] transport Bose to [[Moscow]] where he hope that Russia's traditional enmity to British rule in India would result in support for his plans for a popular rising in India. However, Bose found the Soviets' response disappointing and was rapidly passed over to the German Ambassador in Moscow, [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg|Count von der Schulenburg]]. He had Bose flown on to [[Berlin]] in a special courier aircraft at the beginning of April where he was to receive a more favorable hearing from [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] and the Foreign Ministry officials at the [[Wilhelmstrasse]].  In Germany, Bose is attached to the [[Special Bureau for India]] under [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]] which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored [[Azad Hind Radio]]. Bose initiates the Free India Center in Berlin, and created the [[Indian Legion]] (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]] prior to their capture by Axis forces. The Indian Legion is attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the [[Waffen SS]].  Its members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: "I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, [[Adolf Hitler]], as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose". This oath clearly abrogates control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India. He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the [[Indische Legion|Azad Hind Legion]]; many question his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.  In all, 3,000 Indian prisoners of war sign up for the Free India Legion. But instead of being delighted, Bose was worried. An admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler's tanks rolled across the Soviet border. Matters were worsened by the fact that the now-retreating German army would be in no position to offer him help in driving the British from India. When he meets Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, and he comes to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military ones. So, in February 1943, Bose turned his back on his legionnaires and slipped secretly away aboard a submarine bound for Japan. This leaves the men he had recruited leaderless and demoralized in Germany.  Bose lives in Berlin from 1941 until 1943. During his earlier visit to Germany in 1934, he had met [[Emilie Schenkl]], the daughter of an Austrian veterinarian whom he marries in 1937. Their daughter is [[Anita Bose Pfaff]]. In 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, he leaves for Japan. He travels with the German submarine [[U-180]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to the southeast of Madagascar, where he is transferred to the  for the rest of the journey to [[Imperial Japan]], The INA's first commitment was in the Japanese thrust towards Eastern Indian frontiers of [[Manipur]]. INA's special forces, the Bahadur Group, are extensively involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary attacks in Arakan, as well as the Japanese thrust towards [[Imphal]] and [[Kohima]], along with the [[Burmese National Army]] led by [[Ba Maw]] and [[Aung San]].  However, the Japanese Navy remains in essential control of the island's administration. On the Indian mainland, an Indian Tricolor, modeled after that of the [[Indian National Congress]], was raised for the first time in the town in [[Moirang]], in [[Manipur]], in north-eastern India. The towns of [[Kohima]] and [[Imphal]] were placed under siege by divisions of the Japanese, Burmese National Army and the Gandhi and Nehru Brigades of INA during the attempted invasion of India, also known as Operation U-GO. However, Commonwealth forces held both positions and then counter-attack, in the process inflicting serious losses on the besieging forces, which were then forced to retreat back into Burma.  When the Japanese were defeated at the battles of Kohima and Imphal, the Provisional Government's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever. The INA was forced to pull back, along with the retreating Japanese army, and fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in its Burma campaign, notable in Meiktilla, [[Mandalay]], [[Pegu]], Nyangyu and [[Mount Popa]]. However, with the fall of [[Rangoon]], Bose's government ceases to be an effective political entity. A large proportion of the INA troops surrenders under Lt Col Loganathan. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards [[British Malaya|Malaya]] or made for [[Thailand]]. Japan's surrender at the end of the war also leads to the eventual surrender of the Indian National Army, when the troops of the British Indian Army were repatriated to India. On 17 August 1945, Bose leaves from Saigon to Tourane, French Indo-China in the [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] twin-engine heavy bomber. Subsequently, on 23 August 1945, [[Reuters]] announces the death of Bose and General Tsunamasa Shidei of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The film ends with the [[INA trials|trial of INA war heroes]] at [[Red Fort]], Indian Navy rebellion, and the resulting [[India]]n Independence in 1947.  
New Police Story
  In the present day, a group of rebellious youths rob a bank with the intention of shooting police officers before making their escape. Inspector Chan Kwok-wing and his squad are called to arrest the gang after their hideout is revealed. However, the hideout is rigged with traps, and the entire squad is decimated. Being the sole survivor of the incident, a guilt-ridden Chan takes a year long leave from the police force to binge-drink.  Chan is discovered by a stranger (Nicholas Tse) and taken to the stranger's home. The stranger identifies himself to Chan as PC 138, Frank Cheng, his new partner. Frank tries to convince Chan to cancel his leave and take up the case but Chan refuses. However, Chan comes to his senses eventually by apprehending the same two youths that robbed him in an earlier scene while Chan was drunk. At the police station, Frank tells Chan that he is Kwong's younger brother, which convinces Chan to relook into the case. Chan's superior Chiu Chan (Yu RongGuang), initially believing that Chan's overconfidence alone was responsible for the disastrous raid, challenges them to solve the case before he does.  Frank and Chan convince former colleague Sam Wong to reveal a clue from the night of the first robbery, a watch which he snatched from one of the robbers during a confrontation. He tells them that one of the gang members is a woman and that they like to play X-Games. Chan and Frank are tailed by Chiu and the police as they search the owner of the watch at an upcoming X-Games event; Sam had been arrested by the police to assist in the investigation. At the event, held on the rooftop of a skyscraper, Frank and Chan manage to locate one of the gang members, Fire (Terence Yin), while Sam and the police interrupt the event and single out the woman robber, Sue (Coco Chiang). Before they can apprehend her, however, Fire instigates a gunfight by killing Sam in order to escape. Sam confesses to Chan that he was blackmailed by the gang to aid them in ambushing Chan's team due to the bag of money he took from Sue to pay off his debts. Chiu, upon overhearing this, has a change of heart.  To distract Chan's pursuit, Fire shoots at a bus driver, forcing Chan and Frank to save the bus. When Chan's old commanding officer, Chief Tai comes to him to complain about the collateral damage, he admits to him that he never sent for PC 138. Chan angrily confronts Frank, when Frank admits that even though he failed the exam, all he wanted to be is a good cop. Chan is convinced that Frank is sincere, and the two are briefed by Frank's friend, Officer Sa Sa (Charlene Choi) that the gang members all come from rich families and the leader Joe (Daniel Wu) is actually the son of the police chief.  Sue and Fire return to the gang's new hideout. Seeing Sue's gunshot injury, Joe fatally shoots her. Joe's gang accesses Chan's police file on a computer, and plant a bomb on Chan's girlfriend, Ho Yee, in the police station. He wraps a time bomb around her neck before leaving. When Chan learns of the bomb he desperately tries to free her. Ho Yee cuts the wires, with no effect, leading the police to believe that it is a fake. But when the two get ready to leave, a small wire attached to Ho Yee's back pulls out the secondary trigger, causing the bomb to explode. The blast causes pipes to land on her, knocking her into a coma. Learning of Frank's false identity, Chan and Frank are arrested by the police force temporarily, long before the pair are unofficially released to apprehend the gang.  Chan, Frank and Sa Sa learn that the gang's next target is the Bank of Hong Kong.   In order to avoid another botched raid, Chan has the officers escort the public out of the building, and brings the gang members' parents to cause dissent within Joe's gang, prompting Joe to kill gang member Max for surrendering. Frank manages to disable Fire. Chan chases Tin Tin, and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat, with Chan defeating Tin Tin. Joe then chases Frank into the hall and shoots at him. In the crossfire, Tin Tin is shot in the chest.  Joe chases Frank out of the room moments before the Special Duties Unit arrives. Tin Tin grabs a gun from the floor and points it at Chan's back. Chan, oblivious to what's happening behind him, calls out to the squad to bring in a medic for Tin Tin, prompting Tin Tin to spare Chan.  Chan finds Joe on the roof. Having captured and tied up Frank, Joe threatens to throw him to his death. Joe challenges Chan to a race to assemble a semi automatic pistol, a rematch of an earlier challenge. This time, Chan wins. A number of policemen arrive on the roof, along with Joe's father. Joe's father reprimands him, while Chan tells Joe that he knows that he doesn't hate cops, he merely hates his father for berating him. Joe finally admits defeat and deliberately unloads the single bullet in his gun and aims the empty gun at Chan, choosing suicide-by-cop. Chan rushes to rescue Frank and both of them fall off the building, landing on a fireman's inflated cushion.  In the hospital, Ho Yee has recovered and prepares to leave before accepting Chan's marriage proposal. Meanwhile, Frank is led away by Officer Sa Sa. When Chan looks at the jacket Frank left behind, he remembers meeting an orphaned Frank.

The zombie's ashes are gathered in an urn, which is promptly stolen and sold before it can be buried.  Three months later, Philip Fleischhacker ([[Tino Mewes]]) is left to watch his parents' house as they go on a trip in their RV, specifically forbidding him to have any parties, drink, or do drugs.  He is then picked up by his two friends Wurst ([[Manuel Cortez]]), a party-loving stoner and Konrad (), a nerd who is frequently bullied.  The three also give a ride to Philip's neighbor Rebecca ([[Collien Fernandes]]), a [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl who has an unrequited crush on Philip.  At school, Philip attempts to ask out a popular girl named Uschi (Nadine Garmann), which prompts her jock boyfriend Wolfe (Hendrik Borgmann) to bully and humiliate Philip and his friends.  While in Frau Niedermacher's (Patricia Thielemann) class, Rebecca and her two goth friends Gunther (Oliver Grober) and Frederik (Tom Lass) give a presentation on [[Haitian Voodoo|Voodoo]], which is ridiculed by the class, including Wurst and Konrad.  When Philip learns that Rebecca knows of a love spell, he asks if she'd use it for him so that he could woo Uschi.  Though she tells him it will not work, she tells him to meet her and her friends at the cemetery, where she, Gunther, and Frederik planned to perform a ritual.  Later that night, Philip, Wurst, and Konrad show up at the cemetery, where they learn that Rebecca and the goths plan to use the ashes of a zombie (specifically the zombie from the beginning of the film), and a chicken from the grocery store, to raise the dead, specifically to raise [[Kurt Cobain]] so that he can play music for them.  Though the spell is cast, as the urn is being emptied, a gust of wind picks up and covers Philip, Wurst, and Konrad in the zombie's ashes.  Disappointed and frustrated, the three leave.  While driving home, Wurst loses control of his van while messing with his bong, causing an accident that kills all three boys.  The zombie ashes slowly re-animate them.  The three wake up in a mortuary, and discover that they are dead, but are somehow still alive all the same.  They escape the morgue, and after returning home realize that they have become zombies as a result of the ritual.  The next morning the three eat raw steaks before going to school.  At school, the boys are bullied again by Wolfe, but quickly discover that because they are now zombies, they no longer feel pain and have tremendous strength.  Realizing this, Konrad begins to take revenge on those who bullied him (as he has written down every incident since he started school), while Philip seeks out Rebecca.  He initially tries to get her help in fixing his zombie condition, but she mistakenly thinks he remembered her birthday, causing him to promise to spend it with her.  Throughout the day Konrad begins to crave raw meat and human flesh, causing him to get in trouble after he bites one of his classmates.  At gym class, the boys use their newfound strength and immunity to pain in order to trounce Wolfe and the school [[Rugby football|rugby]] team, which earns them the admiration of their whole class.  To celebrate their victory, Wurst announces a party at Philip's house, and Uschi publicly declares that she will have sex with Philip.  When Rebecca sees this, she storms off, angry and hurt.  Konrad sneaks into the office of the gym teacher (Tim Wilde) and takes revenge upon him by eating him.  When Philip and Wurst discover this, they scold him and end up ripping of Konrad's ear, which he staples back on.  To keep him from eating anyone else, Philip and Wurst chain Konrad to a pipe in the basement.  Later on, Uschi and the rest of the school show up at Philip's home and proceed to throw a wild party.  Wurst uses his being undead to win numerous bets, particularly drinking competitions, and seduces Frau Niedermacher.  Wolfe, eager for revenge for being humiliated by Philip, sneaks in, leaves a stash of drugs in the basement, and calls the police.  Konrad consumes all of the drugs and breaks free from his confinement.  Philip pleads for Rebecca to come join the party, which she agrees to eventually.  She arrives just as Philip and Uschi were about to have sex, causing her to leave, again feeling hurt.  Philip attempts to seduce Uschi, but she accidentally pulls off his penis, causing him to quickly run away.  With the help of Wurst, he reattaches his penis with a stapler.  Uschi catches the two in the middle of this, and assumes Wurst was giving Philip fellatio.  She then ridicules and humiliates him, prompting people to start leaving.  The police show up and search the house, but find nothing, much to the dismay of Wolfe (who didn't realize the drugs he planted were gone) and Philip (who discovered Konrad had escaped).  The police find nothing and break up the party finally.  Once alone, Konrad bites and kills Wolfe, prompting them to hide his body in the freezer.  Desperate for a cure, Philip goes to Rebecca once again.  While alone with her, he loses control, attacks her, accidentally burns her spell book, and then runs away in shame.  Rebecca then correctly deduces that the ritual she and the other goths performed turned Philip and his friends in to zombies.  The next morning, Konrad is gone, but Rebecca arrives and agrees to help them find an antidote.  She has Philip and Wurst steal another copy of her spell book from a museum, and then sends them off to gather the necessary ingredients, including holy water and the blood of a virgin.  Wurst and Philip gather all except the blood, which Rebecca reluctantly offers.  As she prepares the potion, Philip and Wurst scramble to clean up the house, as Philip's parents (Henry Grundler and Sissi Perlinger) call to inform him they're on their way home.  En route, they accidentally run over Konrad and take him to the hospital.  When Philip's parents arrive at home, Philip and Wurst fail in convincing them that there was no party held there the previous night, but manage to escape and consume the potion, making them human again.  Philip, Rebecca, and Wurst rush for the hospital, using Frau Niedermacher's car.  At the hospital, the group confront Konrad (who had gone through a large portion of the hospital's blood bank), and give chase in an attempt to get him to drink the potion.  While cornering him in an autopsy room, Philip ends up impaled on a knife which Konrad threw at Rebecca, and starts dying for a second time.  Overcome with remorse, Konrad saves Philip by turning him into a zombie again using his own blood, and agrees to drink the potion.  Wurst accidentally drops the bottle containing it, causing it to break.  After tasting the contents of the bottle, however, Wurst realizes it was Frau Niedermacher's special cocktail of "moonshine, vodka, and orange juice," and that she in fact had the real potion.   Frau Niedermacher then appears with the bottle, and Philip and Konrad become human again.  In the final scene, Philip and Rebecca acknowledge their feelings for one another and have sex in Philip's bed after sneaking her into his room.

Ocean's Twelve
 Terry Benedict locates all eleven members of [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]]'s gang, demanding they return the $160&nbsp;million they stole from his casinos plus $38&nbsp;million interest. Short by half, the group schemes to stage another heist in Europe to avoid problems with United States authorities. They are tipped off by an informant named Matsui about the location of the first [[stock certificate]] ever. After a complex series of schemes they find the document has already been stolen by "The Night Fox", another master thief. [[Europol]] Detective Isabel Lahiri is called in to investigate the theft and realizes that she gave Rusty the idea of how to solve a complication of the heist with a description of a similar burglary earlier during their relationship. Surprising the group at their accommodation, she warns them they cannot beat the Night Fox or his mentor, the mysterious master-thief "LeMarc",<ref>[http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/oceans-12_roughdraft1.pdf Spelling of "LeMarc" from the script]</ref> both of whom excel in practicing the "long-con". She has been hunting both for years.  Danny and his gang discover the Night Fox is François Toulour, a wealthy baron who has a mansion on [[Lake Como]]. Toulour invites Danny to his mansion and reveals that he had hired Matsui to inform the gang about the certificate in order to arrange the meeting with Danny. Toulour is upset that LeMarc did not describe him as the best thief in the world, and challenges Danny to steal the [[Imperial Coronation (Fabergé egg)|Fabergé Imperial Coronation Egg]]. If Danny and his gang win, Toulour will pay off the debt to Benedict.  Danny and his gang begin to plan an elaborate heist to swap the egg for a [[Holography|holographic recreation]], but the engineer hired by the group accidentally tips off Lahiri to their presence, and she captures most of the gang on their first attempt. Linus comes up with a second plan involving Danny's wife, Tess, posing as a pregnant [[Julia Roberts]] in order to get close to the Egg and swap it. They are foiled by Lahiri and a coincidentally present [[Bruce Willis]], and the rest of the group are captured. Lahiri is told that they are to be extradited to the United States. Linus is chosen first to be interrogated by the FBI agent assigned to collect them. It turns out that she is his mother, who organizes the release of the whole gang. She points out to Lahiri that Lahiri will face only retribution for forging a signature on a Europol form to obtain the necessary arrest warrants for Ocean's gang.  Some time later, Danny and Tess return to Toulour's estate where he reveals his glee at their failure. Toulour claims to have stolen the egg at night using his agility and dancing skills to evade the heavy security. Toulour's celebration is short-lived when Danny reveals that his group stole the egg while it was in transit to the museum and Toulour realizes they were tipped off by LeMarc. A flashback reveals that Danny and Rusty had met LeMarc earlier when he revealed his confidence trick intended to humiliate Toulour, and at the same time, to restore to himself the Fabergé egg that he had stolen years ago and had returned following his wife's wishes. Toulour is forced to admit Danny won the bet and gives him the money for the debt. They pay back Benedict and promise not to perform any more heists in his casinos—even as Toulour himself is in the background spying on Benedict. Rusty takes Lahiri to a safe house that he claims has been lent to him by LeMarc. She is reunited with her father, who is revealed to be the man she has been pursuing for years: LeMarc.  
Notre musique
 The film is divided into three parts inspired by the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]. "Realm 1: Hell" is a relatively brief, non-narrative montage composed of appropriated documentary and narrative fictional footage depicting war, carnage, and violence.  The second segment, "Realm 2: Purgatory", makes up the bulk of the film. Godard, playing himself, is waiting at the airport to depart to a European arts conference in [[Sarajevo]]. There he meets Ramos Garcia, a nationalized French Israeli, who is going to the conference as an interpreter. Ramos is looking forward to seeing his niece at the conference, Olga Brodsky, a French-speaking Jew of Russian descent. Another young woman at the conference, Judith Lerner, a journalist from [[Tel Aviv]], visits the French ambassador and entreats him to have an on-the-record conversation about Jewish-Palestinian relations ("not a just conversation; just a conversation"). Later she interviews the poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]], who says that the Palestinian struggle defines Israel. In between these encounters, Judith surveys the city, and visits the [[Mostar]] bridge, where she reads [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (''Entre Nous'').  Meanwhile, Olga attends Godard's lecture, ostensibly about the relationship between image and text. In addition to touching on a variety of other topics, Godard explains his opposition to the common [[trope (cinema)|cinematic trope]] of "shot/reverse shot," the cutting back and forth between two characters in a conversation or an exchange. Godard explains that presenting two characters in such a way, framed identically, regressively effaces their differences, and can be used as a tool of propaganda. Later Olga meets with her uncle Ramos, and discusses with him the philosophical problem of suicide.  After the conference, Godard is back home, watering his garden. He gets a call from Ramos Garcia, who tells Godard about a young woman who ran into a theater and declared she had a bomb in her bag. She asked for one person to die with her for Israeli-Palestinian peace; everyone left the theater. The police came and shot her. When they opened her bag, all they found were books. Garcia tells Godard that he is sure it was Olga.  In "Realm 3: Heaven," a brief postlude, Olga wanders contemplatively through an idyllic lakeside setting that appears to be guarded by American marines.  
November (2004 film)
 On the evening of November 7, photographer Sophie Jacobs (Cox) and her attorney boyfriend Hugh (LeGros) go to dinner at a [[Chinese food|Chinese]] restaurant. As they travel home afterward, Sophie develops a craving for "something sweet" and stops their car at a convenience store. While Hugh is in the store buying some chocolate for Sophie, an armed man (Carey) arrives and holds up the store, shooting the store clerk, his son, and Hugh dead. He runs away as Sophie arrives.  Sophie sinks into a deep [[clinical depression|depression]], and cannot bring herself to erase Hugh's voice from their apartment's answering machine. She consults her [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]], Dr. Fayn (Dunn), about persistent headaches that she has been suffering from since his death. She tells Dr. Fayn that the headaches started to occur before the incident at the convenience store, and that she had been having an affair with a co-worker, Jesse (Ealy). After Hugh's death Sophie has dinner with her mother, Carol Jacobs (Archer), who accidentally knocks a glass over.  During a college photography class that she teaches, Sophie sets up a slide projector for the students to showcase their best photographs. One slide in the slide show depicts the exterior of the convenience store on the evening of November 7. Sophie contacts Officer Roberts (Offerman), the head of the investigation into the shootings at the convenience store, who is as puzzled as she is as to who is responsible for the photos. Sophie's headaches continue, and she begins to hear strange noises coming from within her apartment building and mysterious voices on the phone. Later, Officer Roberts discovers that the photo of the convenience store was paid for with Sophie's [[credit card]].  The film presents two more different versions of these events, and Sophie must figure out which is real before she loses grip on her sanity, and her life. The second version suggests that Sophie was present at the shootings and was only spared because the shooter ran out of bullets, and the third suggests both Sophie and Hugh were killed. In the words of Cox, her character "goes through three phases. First there's denial. Then she feels guilty and sad about the situation. Then she has to learn to accept it."<ref name="NYDailyNews-Jul2005">Mills, Nancy. [http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/story/329582p-281679c.html "Dramatic turn for Courteney"] . ''[[New York Daily News]]''. July 20, 2005. Retrieved September 19, 2005.</ref> According to Greg Harrison, the events in the film were Sophie's memories as she and Hugh lay dying on the floor of the convenience store: "Each movement of this memory was her process of coming to terms with the terrible trauma, which was that she was killed for absolutely no reason, and it was some random act of violence she couldn’t confront". He added he felt ''November'' was "open-ended" enough that he hoped viewers would "come up with the most beautiful stories themselves that are very different from how I saw it."<ref name="TCM">Mapes, Marty.

The Off Season
 In the beginning, The Off Season appears to be the story of a young couple from New York City moving up to Maine to get away from it all. Soon, strange things begin to happen in the one-room apartment that they occupy—things that the once close couple cannot discuss with each other. This is not a typical ghost story resulting from a tragic death, but the tale of a place haunted by guilt and the fear of abandonment.  Unlike most traditional ghost stories, which take place in an old mansion, castle or other giant structure, The Off Season is about the haunting of a tiny room. The main characters have nowhere to hide when confronted by unhappy spirits. It can be easy to run away and slam a door between yourself and something that scares you, but few things are more terrifying than being forced to look the source of your fear directly in the eye.

After a few years being together, the two become engaged, to the delight of Allie's parents.  When Noah returns from the war, his father has sold their home so that Noah can buy the abandoned house. While visiting Charleston, Noah witnesses Allie and Lon kissing at a restaurant; he convinces himself that if he restores the house, Allie will come back to him. Later, while Allie is being fitted for her wedding dress, Allie is startled to see in the newspaper that Noah has completed the house to the specifications she made years before.  After Allie asks permission from Lon to take a little trip before the wedding, Allie returns to Seabrook to find Noah living in the restored house. The two renew their relationship and make love. Several days later, Anne appears in the morning on Noah's doorstep to warn Allie that Lon has followed her to Seabrook. Anne reveals that, in her youth, she had been in love with a lower-class young man and was still thinking about him; Anne then gives Allie the letters that Noah wrote to her as an admission that she had hidden them from Allie.  Subsequently, Allie confesses to Lon that she had spent time with Noah, and eventually returns to her relationship with Noah.  In the present narrative, it is revealed that the elderly woman is [[dementia]]-stricken Allie, Duke is actually Noah and that he had been told by Allie during the early stages of her illness to reread their journals to help her recall her past.

The Old Negro Space Program
  To impress a girl that he likes, Wallace "Suitcase" Jefferson applies for a job at the newly formed [[NASA]].  Unfortunately, since America's "love affair with racism was in full swing", Jefferson learns that NASA is whites-only.  Undaunted, Jefferson and his friend "Loopie" Louie Hays form their own astronaut group.  Their creation—the Negro American Space Society of Astronauts (NASSA)—is a resounding success, with more than 240 "blackstronauts" signing up by 1960.  The venture also brings personal success to Jefferson—he wins the girl's heart and later marries her.  Using spaceships cobbled together from old rocket engines, landing capsules, a school bus, and a used Cadillac, NASSA quickly becomes a major player in the space race.  Its members farm out across the country, barnstorming in small towns to raise money and becoming minor celebrities.  In Washington, the US government worries about losing the space race to the [[Soviet Union]], but is "ten times as worried" about losing the race to NASSA.  Like NASA, NASSA suffers some significant setbacks.  Sullivan Carew dies a hero's death when his rocket-powered school bus burns up in the atmosphere, while Peter "Stinky Pete" Carver catches fire in an Illinois church parking lot.  Unlike NASA, however, the blackstronauts refuse to slow the pace of their program (Stinky Pete is extinguished and makes another launch the following day).  The film features a letter from Sullivan Carew to his wife written two days before his death.  It is a parody of the real-life letter by [[Union Army]] soldier [[Sullivan Ballou]], which was used by Ken Burns in his documentary ''[[The Civil War (documentary)|The Civil War]]''.  NASA attempts to lure away those members of NASSA who have light skin and can [[passing (racial identity)|pass as white]], including [[Gordon Cooper]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]].  When this fails to produce the desired effect, the government issues a "black blackout" and forces the mainstream media to focus only on negative issues affecting the black community.  Soon the newspapers are full of stories about crime and riots, and the achievements of NASSA go unreported.  On September 31, 1966, Suitcase Jefferson and Louie Hayes land their rocket-powered [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville|Coupe de Ville]] on the surface of the [[Moon]] and return safely to Earth.  Their amazing feat is buried by the black blackout, and appears on page 34 of the ''Cincinnati Enquirer'' (and, presumably, gets the same treatment in other papers).  The article reads as follows:  {{cquote|'''Negroes Land on Moon'''  Talk about getting lost! Wallace Jefferson and Louis Hayes, both negroes, have wandered all the way to the moon!  The hapless pair entered lunar orbit late yesterday afternoon and finally landed on the surface of the moon several hours later. They plan to return later this week.  The incident is not a total tragedy. "We may want to talk with these negroes," said NASA mission commander Deke Slayton. "Their mishap may just help us in our goal to land a man on the moon by the end of the decade." }}  Saddened by the nation's lack of interest in their heroics, Jefferson and his friends decide to shut down NASSA.

One Missed Call (2003 film)
 While out at a pub with university friends, Yoko Okazaki misses a call on her cell phone, but the ID is from herself. She and her friend Yumi Nakamura listen to Yoko's voice message, dated two days in the future, where she says it's starting to rain, followed by a horrendous scream. Two days later, Yumi receives a call from Yoko and realizes that she is on exactly the same routine as the voicemail. Yoko screams as she is violently tossed and then thrown off an overpass onto a speeding commuter train; her severed hand is seen dialing a number. Although authorities assume suicide, her schoolmates recall other similar deaths that were preceded by the voicemails. Yoko's boyfriend Kenji Kawai tells Yumi he got a voicemail from himself dated two days after, but disbelieves it. Yumi watches as Kenji is pulled into an elevator shaft. A red [[Gobstopper|jawbreaker candy]] falls out of his mouth as his phone dials another number by itself.  Yumi invites her friend Natsumi Konishi to stay at her apartment when she hears the same cursed ringtone. A video message dated two days later shows Natsumi with a ghastly arm behind her. Natsumi's attempt to discard the phone proves futile as she gets the same ringtone and voicemail message from an unrelated phone. Desperate, she agrees to a television producer's offer to meet with an exorcist. Yumi meets Hiroshi Yamashita, a detective who has been investigating the curse that had also claimed his sister Ritsuko. Yamashita shares that the next victim is called a minute after the death, and that the victims have red jawbreakers in their mouths.  Yamashita and Yumi trace a number common to the victims' phones to a hospital which has since changed its building and number. Yumi recognizes a sound she heard before Kenji's death: a spritz from an [[asthma inhaler]]. They trace the autopsy records to a girl Mimiko Mizunuma who had died from an asthma attack, with her mother Marie going missing. Ritsuko's journal shows that whenever Mimiko had an attack, her sister Nanako would suffer some injury at the same time. They suspect [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], where a parent purposely makes a child sick so she can take care of her and be praised for it. Natsumi's exorcism goes horribly wrong and she is killed when her body horribly contorts. Yumi then gets the cursed voicemail on her phone where she says "Why me?" and then screams. The same night, she reveals to Yamashita that her mother abused her as a child.  At the Mizunuma residence, Yumi finds a torn-up family photo, but screams when she sees a figure in a cupboard. There, Yamashita finds an old camcorder. At an orphanage, Yamashita meets Nanako, who is unable to talk, but possesses a teddy bear that plays the same song as the ringtone. At the old abandoned hospital building, Yumi is haunted by the spirit of Mimiko in her attempt to escape. Yamashita finds Yumi and they lock themselves in a room. Yumi's cellphone messages that she will die in one minute. Yamashita finds an arm nearby clutching an active cellphone, and stops its call. After the minute elapses, Yamashita comforts Yumi, but when he uncovers a crate holding Marie's body, it comes to life when Yumi approaches it. With Yamashita locked out, Yumi sees her own abusive mother's image in Marie and apologizes for leaving her. She tearfully embraces her, and Marie's body returns to a corpse.  Yumi returns home, as Yamashita returns to the orphanage. The Mizunuma videotape reveals that Marie did not abuse her children, but that Mimiko abused her sister. The tape shows her cutting Nanako, then suffering an asthma attack. Marie found out the truth and rushed Nanako to the hospital, leaving Mimiko to die. Nanako tells Yamashita that she would get a candy from Mimiko if she stayed silent. Yamashita rushes to Yumi's apartment as Yumi is being haunted by Mimiko; Yumi says "Why me?" and screams. When Yamashita arrives, he finds Yumi acting like nothing happened, but is stabbed by her with a kitchen knife when they embrace, and sees Yumi appearing as Mimiko in the mirror. After a brief dream where he helps the dying Mimiko with an inhaler, Yamashita wakes in a hospital where a possessed Yumi, brandishing the knife behind her back, feeds him a candy with her mouth and smiles, revealing that Mimiko found "a new Nanako" in Yamashita to care for.  
Orgy of the Dead
 The film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin ([[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]]) sits up to deliver an opening narration. This narration mostly matches the prologue of ''[[Night of the Ghouls]]'' (1959), with one minor variation and an additional line. The phrase ''"world between the living and the dead"'' of the original is changed to ''"void between..."''. There is also a new line at the end: ''"A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world!''"<ref name="Craig">Craig (2009), p. 217-241</ref> The opening credits feature the image of "an immobile young woman clad in gold". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964).<ref name="Craig">Craig (2009), p. 217-241</ref>  Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone [[Chevrolet Corvair]] driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley ([[Pat Barrington]]) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration.  The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff.<ref name="Craig">Craig (2009), p. 217-241</ref>  The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his "Princess of the Night", the Black Ghoul ([[Fawn Silver]]), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.<ref name="Craig">Craig (2009), p. 217-241</ref>  As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser). The Black Ghoul explains that this woman loved flames, and that both she and her lovers died in flames.

The Overture
  Starting out in the 1940s, the story finds the elder Sorn bed-ridden. To an old friend, he recalls his childhood growing up in 1880s Siam, during the reign of [[Chulalongkorn|King Chulalongkorn]] and the action [[flashback (literary technique)|flashes back]] to that time.  Sorn's brother was a gifted classical musician, so gifted in fact that it caused a rivalry with other musicians that ended in Sorn's brother's death. Because of that, Sorn's father bars the boy from taking up the ''[[ranad-ek]]'' (Thai [[xylophone]]). However, Sorn, who has shown a talent for the instrument since an early age, defies his father and sneaks off to practice playing in an abandoned temple in the jungle.  Eventually, he becomes so skilled at the instrument that his father lets him play after he speaks to a monk who advises him that he should not deny him the right to play ranad-ek. Sorn excels in his studies to the point where he is noticed by other bands. They ask for his presence to complete. He becomes arrogant and misses practice telling his father that his faith isn't misplaced. His father teaches his place by putting him on the Kong-wong. At the competition, the competitor scares his uncle (the substitute on ranad-ek) and becomes clear that the competitor has superior skill. As their playing, the judge realises that Sorn isn't playing on the ranad-ek and calls the teacher out on the fact that if they have a good player, might as well bring out the good material because then you can lose with  dignity. The band starts over and plays the same song, but it is obvious that Sorn is skilled. He wins every competition as a boy. So  One day, in a local village, Sorn and his ensemble are set up to perform in a courtyard. Across the courtyard is another ensemble, led by a fierce-looking bearded ''[[ranad-ek]]'' player dressed in black. As the rival player starts to perform, a storm whips up adding to the ominous mood of the setting. Sorn is disturbed by his fiery ability to play and wants to learn like him.  But Sorn's talent does not go unnoticed and he is soon chosen to play for a local nobleman and is sent to the palace for more formal music training. There he meets an older man that he thinks is a palace caretaker, or some type of lowly person that does not know about music. However, later, when Sorn is to meet his new teacher, Master Tian, it is revealed to be the old man he met earlier. Tian turns out to be a strict teacher and instructs Sorn on all the instruments of the Thai classical music ensemble. At one point, Sorn is punished for being too flashy a player and is made to relinquish the ''[[ranad-ek]]'' to an inferior player, much to the dismay of other members in his ensemble, as well as a high palace official watching the performance.  So when it comes time for the kingdom's musical competition, it is Sorn who is again the lead player. However, Sorn must overcome his fear at the competition, because he must again face the fierce, bearded ''[[ranad-ek]]'' performer.  The story flashes back forward to the 1940s again, showing Sorn as a respected teacher. One day Sorn's son has a [[piano]] moved into his father's studio. The expectation is that his father will be furious at having a newfangled [[Western world|Western]] instrument brought into his house. But instead of being mad, he instructs his son to play a tune on the piano. The elder Sorn then takes up his [[ranad-ek]] mallets and [[improvisation|improvises]] with his son, blending Thai and Western music.  This is during the rule of the dictator, Field Marshal [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]], whose government called for the accelerated modernisation of Thailand. As a result, performances of traditional Thai music, dance and theatre were frowned upon. In Sorn's neighbourhood, the orders are enforced by Lieutenant-Colonel Veera.  Sorn teaches the Lieutenant a nation can only withstand outside forces if their nation is strong. For that to happen, they must believe in themselves. No matter what, they must protect their heritage and honor it regardless of what they are to become. Sorn plays not only to defy the rules, but to teach a lesson about culture and heritage.

He lived with his mentally deranged son, Babya (Ameya Hunaswadkar) and his trusted aide Kirkire (Vijay Chavan). Inamdar plans his son's marriage in a village far away from theirs. The fact that Babya is not of sound mind was concealed from the girl's parents and the wedding was fixed at the Temple of Narsobachi Wadi. During the wedding Durga, who was an old friend of the girl's mother, tells everyone that Babya was mentally deranged and this fact was hidden by Inamdar. The marriage is broken and the irate guests attacked Inamdar and Kirkire is killed.

Das Paar im Kahn
 The young Roma ''Zarah'' burgles an apartment in Basel, witnesses a murder, and escapes undetected but loses an amulet. In the meantime, Reto Hunkeler (Mathias Gnädinger), ''Kommissär'' (inspector) of the Basel Police, reflects on his impending retirement – in fact his boss, (prosecuting attorney) ''Staatsanwalt Suter'', has already written him off and sends Hunkeler to [[Alsace]] to research a study about youth crime, but he prefers to spend his time at the local spa.  When Hunkeler returns to Basel, a colleague tells him about the murder case that his partner is investigating: ''Aische Aydin'', a young woman of Turkish origin, is found slain in her apartment in Basel where she lived the past five years. Her husband ''Ali Aydin'' (Baris Eren) is suspected, but he keeps silent, and Hunkeler's ambitious young colleague ''Madörin'' (Giles Tschudi) leads the investigations and arrests the victim’s husband. Later, Aydin even attempts suicide when alleged staff of the Turkish consulate tried to get further information.  Hunkeler is assailed by doubts, and finds an amulet in the apartment – representing a couple in a boat – that attracts his attention. Hunkeler meets a colleague in a bar that recommends him to ask a [[Narc (narcotics)|narc]] of the drug police in Basel, and ''Fredy'' later 'assists' Hunkeler to complete his investigations. Hunkeler is looking for further hints, surveys ''Theo Ruf'' who gave a job as charwoman to Aische, and a neighbor of the ''Aydin's'' tells Hunkeler that she observed a Roma girl escaping the house. Hunkeler investigates the strange amulet in the neighbouring Alsace in France ''in private'', as he assumes that Madörin is wrong, where Hunkeler meets [[Romani people|''Roma'' families]] to find the girl.  Shortly afterwards, the heroin addict ''Theo'' is found murdered, Hunkeler is sandbagged by the murder, but the police assumes a ''drug delict'' as there is a greater amount of heroin. Acquaintances of Aydin confirm that the amulet belonged to Aische, but the forensic scientist ''Anne de Ville'' (Emanuela von Frankenberg) remarks that there's no forensic hint that Aische was wearing an amulet, but she was beaten, and ''Theo'' even was tortured by his murder. Aydin remains hospitalized, but now is also associated by the police with drug trafficking: Madörin investigates the drug case and homicide, and Hunkeler now officially investigates the murder of Aische. Advised by his lawyer Spälti who also assisted Aische to bring their children to Switzerland, Ali still keeps silent. Attorney Spälti introduces Hunkeler the Turkish diaspora in ''Kleinbasel'', and informs Hunkeler about the Basel drug scene, doubting that the police will try to solve the homicide, but rather will concentrate their effort to solve the 'drug' case. Theo's alleged killers continue to search for the missing material. Hunkeler contacts again the ''narc'' Fredy to get further information, and once again, travels to Alsace to find the supposed witness, the Roma girl.  Hunkeler finds the girl as she breaks a car at a train station in Alsace: ''Zarah'' (Sophie Scholz) lost the amulet and confirms that she observed the murder from a hiding place. Hunkeler brings Zarah for a comparison to Basel, wins her to do so by entertaining Zarah to dinner, and they spend a day in his favourite spa. But first the young Roma woman has to be surveyed by the youth advocate, and Hunkeler's boss is cheesed with him because he ''kidnapped'' Zarah from France to Switzerland. The youth advocate interrogates Zarah as a witness, but claims involuntary commitment to the underage Roma girl as she committed other crime delicts in Basel. Hunkeler's friend was attacked by two alleged employees of the Turkish consulate, but in fact members of the drug mafia, who later even menace Hunkeler who guests his friend and Zarah. The next day, the two Turkish gangsters have been arrested, but on occasion of the identification parade, Zarah identifies Ali's lawyer, attorney Spälti, and tells what she saw that evening when Aische was killed.  Now, Ali is talking about: He had been forced by the mobsters to courier services, but his wife had hidden the goods. Fearing reprisals, he had been reluctant to satisfy the desire of his wife Aische, and to bring their children to Switzerland. Spälti admits to have slain Aische in the dispute. She had sought his advice, because she necessarily wanted to have their children in Switzerland. Aische liked Spälti, but he wanted ''more'' from her then friendship. After Spälti had learned a lot about the background, he tried to blackmail Aische. As she still rejected him, he went berserk and thereby became the killer. Hunkeler sends Zarah back to France to prevent that she is arrested for the minor delicts in Basel. At the end, Hunkeler meets again Anne de Ville.  
Paparazzi (2004 film)
 Rising movie star Bo Laramie ([[Cole Hauser]]) has finally achieved major success with his latest film. A persistent group of unscrupulous photographers — Kevin Rosner ([[Kevin Gage (actor)|Kevin Gage]]), Leonard Clark ([[Tom Hollander]]), Wendell Stokes ([[Daniel Baldwin]]) and their leader Rex Harper ([[Tom Sizemore]]) - harass Bo and his wife Abby ([[Robin Tunney]]), and their 8-year-old son Zach (Blake Michael Bryan). When Bo takes Zach to soccer practice, he sees Rex taking photos of Zach and confronts him, where Rex provokes Bo into punching him, caught on camera by his fellow photographers. Bo is sued for $500,000 and placed into anger management, while Rex vows to destroy Bo's life.  As Bo, Abby and Zach return from an event, Rex and his crew drive up beside them, in four different vehicles, and blind them by taking pictures. Bo's car is hit by a pickup truck, and Rex and his crew snap photos of the wreck they caused. While Bo is not seriously injured, Abby's spleen is removed and Zach is placed in a coma. Bo is told by LAPD detective Burton ([[Dennis Farina]]) that the paparazzi each gave him the same story of finding the wreck after it happened, with no witnesses to dispute their claims. Some time later, Bo accidentally causes Kevin to wipe out on his motorcycle, careening onto a precipice. Bo tries to save him, but when Kevin gloats that they'll put his family through hell, Bo lets him fall to his death.   Bo next goes after Leonard, secretly placing a prop gun in the jacket left in Leonard's car, whilst Leonard invades Bo's movie set and is ejected by security. Following him, Bo calls 911, and describes Leonard's car, saying that the driver is waving a gun. Leonard is pulled over and, reaching into his jacket for his ID, instead pulls out the prop gun, causing the cops to shoot him dead.  Convinced Bo will target them next, Rex and Wendell break into Bo's house to plant cameras inside. Abby runs into Wendell, who assaults her and threatens to kill Zach if she tells the cops. Burton assigns Deputy Walker ([[Forry Smith]]) and Deputy Wilson ([[Donal Gibson]]) to provide extra security, but Bo sneaks out past the two deputies and into Wendell's house, discovering the feed from the cameras. Wendell arrives home, and Bo confronts him with a baseball bat. In the morning, Bo puts the car back where it was at, and races to beat Burton, on his way to the house. Burton shows Bo a video taken by a camera in a button of Leonard's shirt on the movie set, and thinks someone planted the gun in Leonard's coat.  Rex finds Wendell beaten to death, and Bo planted the bat in Rex's houseboat to frame him.  Burton realizes traffic camera footage will prove what really happened at Bo's crash, along with the testimony of Emily ([[Andrea Baker]]), who was with Rex at the event, prompted by her guilt to come forward. At Wendell's house, Burton notices the video feed from the cameras in Bo's house and Rex entering with a gun. Rex goes to Bo and Abby's bedroom and opens fire, only for Bo to hit Rex and throw him to the floor. He viciously beats Rex, gloating about how he got his revenge. Rex is arrested and relentlessly photographed by paparazzi as he is led away. Later, as Bo is finishing filming, he's called to the hospital, where Zach has awakened from his coma. Bo, Abby, and Zach attend at the premiere of Bo's latest film, and Abby is now pregnant with a girl. After the film, Bo meets the press out front, taking a paparazzi's jibe at him in his stride.

However, Islet loves Duroy.  Ibô ([[Reiven Bulado]]), Duroy's brother, is also smitten with Iset. As Duroy adores his family and does not want to get in his brother's way, he stops courting Iset.

The Passion of the Christ
 In the late hours of the night at the forested garden of [[Gethsemane]], [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (Caviezel), at the height of his cause, prays while his disciples [[Saint Peter|Peter]], James, and John (James's brother) are asleep. After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Jesus walks to a secluded portion of the forest wherein during his prayer, [[Satan]] appears in a hooded ghost-like [[androgynous]], [[Albinism|albino]] form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating, "It is not right for one man to die for their (humanity's) sins." Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, and he rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head with his heel, and Satan vanishes.  Meanwhile, [[Judas Iscariot]], another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and gravely injures [[Malchus]], one of the guards and a servant of the high priest [[Caiaphas]], by slashing his ear. Jesus, in turn, heals Malchus' injury while simultaneously reprimanding Peter for his actions. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the [[Sanhedrin]].  John informs [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Mary begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene but a temple guard assures them that she is unbalanced. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When questioned by Caiaphas if he is the [[Son of God]], Jesus replies, "[[Tetragrammaton|I AM]]". A horrified Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for [[blasphemy]]. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he angrily denies this. But after cursing at the mob during the third denial, a sobbing Peter flees after remembering that Jesus had foretold Peter that he would deny him thrice before the cock will crew thrice (the cock crow is not shown in the movie). At the same time, a guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the [[priests]]. Tormented by [[Christian demonology|demons]], he flees the city and finds solitude, eventually hanging himself from a tree with a [[halter]] rope he finds on a decaying donkey corpse by morning.  Caiaphas brings Jesus before [[Pontius Pilate]] to be condemned to death, but at the urging of Pilate's wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, a sympathetic Pilate transfers him to the court of [[Herod Antipas]], as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of [[Nazareth]], Galilee. After Jesus is again found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd options either for him to chastise Jesus, or to release him. He then attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and a violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. To his anger, the crowd demands to have Barabbas freed and Jesus crucified. In an attempt to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that he simply be flogged but not crucified. Jesus is brutally scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards until Abenader, their officer, angrily stops them. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and falling on their knees, they tease him saying “Hail, king of the Jews”. One of them hits Jesus’ head with a stick. A bruised Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' verbal backing, continues to demand that Jesus be crucified as an impostor and Barabbas released. Admonished, Pilate washes his hands, takes no responsibility for the incident, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. During the course of events, Satan observes Jesus' painful sufferings with great interest.   As Jesus labors to carry a heavy wooden cross along the [[Via Dolorosa]] to [[Calvary]], [[Saint Veronica|a woman]] avoids the escort of soldiers and then she requests Jesus to wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. After that, she offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten and pressed by the guards until the unwilling [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]]. The very act seems to affect the weather conditions of the earth itself.  Hanging from the cross, Jesus prays to [[God the Father|God]] asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides [[salvation]] to a [[Penitent thief|criminal]], who is crucified beside him, for his strong faith and repentance. Succumbing to impending death, Jesus surrenders his spirit to [[God the Father|the Father]] and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering a sudden earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the [[Holy of Holies]] in two, to the horror of Caiaphas and the other priests. Satan is shown screaming in agonized defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross, and entombed. In the end, the healed body of Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|rises from the dead]] and exits the tomb resurrected, with wounded holes visible on his palms.

However, there is a great difference in their personalitites. Himal’s thinking is Westernized and has friends of poor character.

Kiran arrives in Hong Kong, and meets Himal and Suraj; during her stay with the family she gets to know them and finds herself gradually falling in love with Suraj. Himal, on the other hand, is happy with his girlfriend Jenny, drinking and using drugs. Due to absenteeism at work, he is fired from his job, refuses to get another one, and runs through his savings; this drives Jenny to leave him.

The Perfect Score
 The film revolves around [[everyman]] high school student Kyle ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), who needs a high score on the SAT to get into his preferred architecture program at [[Cornell University]]. He constantly compares himself to his older brother Larry, who is now living above his parents' garage. Kyle's best friend, Matty ([[Bryan Greenberg]]), wants to get a high score so he can go to the same college as his girlfriend, but he is an [[Slacker|underachiever]] who had previously received a low score on his [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]]. They both believe that the SAT is standing in the way of their futures.  The two boys realize that fellow student Francesca Curtis' ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) father owns the building that houses the regional office of [[Educational Testing Service|ETS]], where the answers to the SAT are located. Francesca initially doesn't want to help but changes her mind, saying "What the hell? It sounds like fun." Meanwhile, Kyle becomes attracted to Anna Ross ([[Erika Christensen]]), the second-highest ranked student in the school, and tells her about the plan. Anna had bombed a previous SAT and needs a good score to get into [[Brown University]]. However, Matty doesn't like the fact that she now knows about the plan and has a rant, right in the presence of [[Cannabis consumption|stoner]] Roy ([[Leonardo Nam]]), who then has to be included in the heist. And finally, Anna tells the school basketball star Desmond Rhodes ([[Darius Miles]]), who needs a score of 900 or better to join the basketball team at [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]].  An early attempt to break into the ETS offices fails, but the team then devises another plan. On the eve of the exam, Francesca will arrange for Kyle and Matty to have a meeting near the top floor, staying after closing. The other three will wait outside and watch the night guard until Francesca, Kyle, and Matty have successfully stolen the answers.  The first part of the plan goes well, with Francesca, Kyle, and Matty successfully avoiding security cameras and the night guard. However, the answers are located on a computer, and only the technical genius Roy can crack the password; he and the other two get into the building, and Roy correctly guesses the password after seeing a photograph of an employee. Still, the answers can't be printed, so the group decides to take the test with their combined knowledge and get the answers that way. In the early hours of morning, they are finished and have all the answers written down.  Just then, the guard comes up the stairs, and they try to escape through the ceiling; however, Francesca is left behind and is about to be discovered, so Matty bravely sacrifices himself in order to save her. Everyone else escapes, but each faces a certain confrontation before the exam: Kyle's brother asks him if he's really worse than a thief, Matty is bailed out by Francesca, Anna finds independence from her parents, and Desmond's mother convinces Roy to quit drugs.  Before the SAT testing begins, the group realizes that, although it will help get them what they want, they would be better off without cheating. Roy grabs the answers and distributes them in the bathroom. After the decision, Matty comments that "this whole thing was for nothing." Kyle replies, "I wouldn't say nothing", as he glances at Anna. Matty and Francesca also share a look, as they have also presumably started a relationship. Each person eventually gets their desired test score without the answers: Kyle's dream of becoming an architect is still alive by attending [[Syracuse University]], Desmond ends up going to St. John's, Matty becomes an actor, Francesca writes a novel (which is about [[metafiction|six kids who conspire to steal the answers to the SAT]]), and Anna decides to travel to Europe for a while before starting college. As for Roy – the narrator of the film – he earned the highest SAT in the county, and, under Desmond's mom's guidance, he gets a [[GED]]. He then puts his untapped intelligence to use through programming, becoming a successful [[video game designer]].

A battle ensues, destroying a nearby research site and traumatizing a young boy named Tory as he gets caught in a stampede of [[Spheal]], [[Sealeo]], and [[Walrein]]. Deoxys engages Rayquaza and the two take turns delivering devastating blows to each other, but the fight draws to a conclusion when Rayquaza surprises the alien Pokémon and fires a point blank Hyper Beam at it. Deoxys' body is destroyed, leaving only the purple crystal in its chest that falls into the sea, while some researchers take the green crystal back with them to the Hoenn region. Beneath the sea, the injured Deoxys begins to regenerate, and waits.  Four years later in the Year 2020, Ash Ketchum and his friends May, Max, and Brock travel to the technologically advanced LaRousse City in Hoenn, where block robots patrol the area.

Outside, the train's [[Conductor (rail)|conductor]] ([[Tom Hanks]]) introduces the train as the Polar Express, bound for the [[North Pole]].

The train is forced to stop while the conductor disperses a herd of [[caribou]] that is blocking their way, whereupon the engineers return to the cabin and the boy, girl and conductor remain on the catwalk on the front of the locomotive.

The boy returns the girl's ticket, and as the three return to the passenger car, the boy is accosted by an [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] [[marionette]] (controlled by the hobo), taunting him and calling him a doubter.  The train finally arrives at the North Pole, where the conductor announces that one of the passengers will be chosen to receive the first gift of Christmas, from Santa himself. The girl discovers Billy still alone in the rear car, and she and the boy persuade him to come along; however, the boy accidentally unhitches the car, sending it back along the line to a [[railway turntable]] in [[Santa's workshop]]. The children sneak through an [[Christmas elf|elf]] [[command center]] and a gift sorting office before accidentally being dumped into Santa's sack, where they discover that the know-it-all stowed away along with them, hoping to open his Christmas presents early. The elves rescue them as Santa arrives, and the boy grows frustrated, unable to see Santa through the crowd. A [[jingle bell]] flies loose from the galloping reindeers' reins; the boy initially cannot hear it ring, until he finds it within himself to believe. He returns the bell to Santa as he passes, and Santa selects the boy to receive the first gift of Christmas. The boy asks to keep the jingle bell, and places it in his robe pocket.  The wayward rear car is returned to the train as the children board to return home, but then the boy discovers that he had lost the bell through the hole in his robe pocket. He returns home and awakens Christmas morning to find a present containing the bell. He and his younger sister ring the bell to their delight; their parents, not believing in Santa, lament how the bell is "broken".

Pinocchio then realizes that everything was his fault. Cyberina appears, Pinocchio tells her that he has learned about Right and Wrong and turns Pinocchio into a real boy and Geppetto back into a human. Suddenly, Scamboli, turned into a robot, appears and Marlene was shocked. Cyberina borrows Cynthia's "Funbrella" to make sunshine and bring back all the plants Scamboli has destroyed.

Poster Boy (film)
 The film opens with Henry Kray being interviewed by a reporter about the events about to unfold on-screen. Henry is the son of a powerful and conservative [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[North Carolina]]. Senator Kray has gained a national reputation in part by attacking [[homosexuality]]. Unknown to the senator, Henry is gay.  The senator plans to kick off his re-election campaign at a luncheon at Henry's college campus and he expects Henry to deliver his introduction. Henry's sexuality is something of an open secret around campus, to the extent that the campus gay activist group has created a chart of his many sexual partners. The night before Senator Kray is scheduled to arrive, Henry has sex with Anthony, a former [[ACT UP]] activist who's drifted away from activism.  The day of the speech, Anthony is approached by a campus activist who wants to enlist his help in [[outing]] Henry. Anthony and his friend Izzie have an argument about it and Izzie (who is [[HIV]]-positive) storms off. She's hit by the limousine transporting the senator and his wife Eunice. The senator's party brings her along with them and Eunice takes a shine to her. She gives Izzie a suit and invites her along for the luncheon.  Henry invites Anthony as well, insisting that he sit at the dais with him. Henry introduces his father, who begins his speech. As the speech continues, Henry stands up, pulls Anthony to his feet and kisses him in full view of the national media, outing himself before the activists have the chance to. In the firestorm of controversy, the Senator and his team decide to [[Spin (public relations)|spin]] the event by stressing that the Senator still loves his gay son. Meanwhile, one of the campus activists congratulates Anthony for outing Henry, and even though Henry decided to "out" himself, the bond of trust that had started to form between him and Anthony shatters.  The film closes with Henry summarizing the aftermath. He and Anthony never see each other again, Izzie has died of [[AIDS]] and the Senator won re-election despite, or perhaps because of, the controversy.

Post Impact
 In 2010, during a party at the US embassy in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]], scientist Gregor Starndorf is told that the [[comet]] he discovered, designated ''Bay-Leder 7'', is headed towards [[Earth]]. It is large enough to cause an [[extinction level event]] and is only days away. He develops a satellite weapon called ''SolStar-2'', which is moderately successful against the comet: the microwave beam cut ''Bay-Leder 7'' in two, but the smaller part impacts in western [[Russia]]. The head of US embassy security, Captain Tom Parker picks up his family so they can be evacuated. However, his superior, Colonel Waters, forces Parker to leave them behind, watching helplessly as the aircraft takes off. News reports depict the after effects of the impact.  Three years later, the situation has not improved. Due to the debris thrown into the atmosphere, all of [[Europe]]'s population was evacuated to [[Africa]], where a new ruling body, the New United Northern States (NUNS), has been established. Oil prices also skyrocketed, enabling the [[Middle East]] to establish a firm grip on the world economy. A NUNS technician finds that ''SolStar-2'' is still active. But the satellite can only be controlled from the command center below the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]]. The problem is, since the comet impact, Germany is covered in huge layers of ice. An aircraft, carrying personnel sent to investigate, explodes while flying over the area. Evidence points to ''SolStar-2'' in the attack. NUNS President Miranda Harrison recruits Parker to lead an expedition—including ex-[[Special Air Service|SAS]] Sarah Henley and Anna Starndorf, Gregor Starndorf's daughter, to find out who controls the satellite and destroy it. Although Parker knows the mission is led by Colonel Waters, he asks to join, secretly hoping that his family is somehow alive.  During their flight in, the ''SolStar-2'' zeroes in on their position and destroys the aircraft. The team manages to parachute out with two [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs), though. During the trip, they must cross through [[Cologne]] and use the [[Cologne Cathedral]] as a guide there. However, they lose several men to marauders and one APC to an ice [[geyser]]. When they finally reach Berlin, they find that the city is buried in several meters of snow.  Shortly afterwards, they come under attack from survivors. There are about 600 people hiding in the subway tunnels and supplied by the "Distributors". They find out a blind man called "the doctor" is hiding below the Reichtag and supplies the people with food. The doctor's quarters are actually a verdant greenhouse and he is Gregor Starndorf. He explains that he and his chief engineer Klaus Hintze were the designers of ''SolStar-2''. It was originally meant to be a new power source to lessen the dependency on oil, but due to military funding, it became a weapon. He orders Hintze to reactivate the satellite to execute a program he has devised to extend its area of effect and stop the permanent winter. He is alarmed to hear that Hintze is using it as a weapon, but the Distributors suddenly return and during the battle a sniper kills him.  Enraged, the four confront Hintze, who is powering up the satellite to destroy Tangier, the NUNS' headquarter city, as a revenge for having been left behind. Sarah shoots him and Col. Waters apologizes to Parker for his earlier actions and allows him to leave and find his family. While he is away, Sarah unexpectedly kills Waters and orders Anna to retarget ''SolStar-2'' to destroy Mecca and possibly other targets in the Middle East, for which she says she will be paid $10 million by an unnamed group. Parker returns and, despite being wounded, attacks Sarah, nearly losing before Anna shoots her. Anna aims the satellite to Europe and executes her father's program to "kickstart the weather," causing ''SolStar-2'' to use up its last energy reserves to release a massive, wide-beamed microwave torrent which begins warming the atmosphere.  Parker and Anna continue the search for his family and find his home. Inside he discovers his wife's final message to him beside their frozen bodies. Back outside, they watch the thick, permanent clouds over Germany dissipate, revealing the warming sun once again.  
Primer (film)
 [[Image:Time Travel Method-2.svg|thumb|500px|The operation of time travel in ''Primer''.]] Two engineersAaron and Abesupplement their day-jobs with entrepreneurial tech projects, working out of Aaron's garage. During one such research effort, involving electromagnetic reduction of objects' weight, the two men accidentally discover an 'A-to-B' time loop side-effect: objects left in the weight-reducing field exhibit temporal anomalies, proceeding normally (from time 'A,' when the field was activated, to time 'B,' when the field is powered off), then backwards (from 'B' back to 'A') in a continuously repeating sequence, such that objects can leave the field in the present, or at some previous point.  Abe refines this proof-of-concept and builds a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized to accommodate a human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, so as not to interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.  Abe and Aaron repeat Abe's six-hour experiment multiple times over multiple days, making profitable same-day stock trades armed with foreknowledge of the market's performance. The duo's divergent personalitiesAbe cautious and controlling, Aaron impulsive and meddlesomeput subtle strain on their collaboration and friendship. These tensions come to a head after a late-night encounter with Thomas Granger (father to Abe's girlfriend, Rachel), who appears inexplicably unshaven and exists in overlap with his original suburban self. Granger falls into a comatose state after being pursued by Aaron; Aaron theorizes that, at some unknown point in the future, Granger entered the "box", with timeline-altering consequences. Abe concludes that time travel is simply too dangerous, and enters a secret second box (the "failsafe box," built before the experiment begun and kept continuously running), traveling back four days to prevent the experiment's launch.  Cumulative competing interference wreaks havoc upon the [[timeline]]. Future-Abe sedates Original-Abe (so he will never conduct the initial time travel experiment), and meets Original-Aaron at a park bench (so as to dissuade him), but finds that Future-Aaron has gotten there first (armed with pre-recordings of the past conversations, and an unobtrusive earpiece), having brought a disassembled "third failsafe box" four days back with his own body.  Future-Abe faints at this revelation, overcome by shock and fatigue.  The two men briefly and tentatively reconcile. They jointly travel back in time, experiencing and reshaping an event where Abe's girlfriend Rachel was nearly killed by a gun-wielding party crasher. After many repetitions, Aaron, forearmed with knowledge of the party's events, stops the gunman, becoming a local hero. Abe and Aaron ultimately part ways; Aaron considers a new life in foreign countries where he can tamper more broadly for personal gain, while Abe states his intent to remain in town and dissuade/sabotage the original "box" experiment. Abe warns Aaron to leave and never return.  The epilogue reveals that multiple "box-aware" versions of Aaron are still alive and circulatingat least one Future-Aaron has shared his knowledge with Original-Aaron, via discussions, voice-recordings, and an unsuccessful physical altercation. Future-Abe watches over Original-Abe, going to painstaking extremes to keep him unaware of the future. The film's final scene depicts a fully aware Aaron, directing French-speaking workers in the construction of a warehouse-sized box.

 High school teacher Hideki Satomi ([[Hiroshi Mikami]]), his wife, Ayaka ([[Noriko Sakai]]) who works as a psychology teacher, and their five-year-old daughter, Nana ([[Hana Inoue]]) are driving home to [[Tokyo]] after a vacation. While on a country road, Hideki stops to upload a file on a phonebooth. Inside, he sees a newspaper scrap showing his daughter being involved in a car crash, dated just a minute later at 8:00 PM. As Ayaka steps outside to get Hideki's help on Nana's jammed seatbelt, a truck smashes through their car, killing Nana. A distraught Hideki tries to find the newspaper scrap when the media comes while Ayaka tearfully tries to stop him.  Three years later, Ayaka, having divorced Hideki, interviews a psychic, Satoko Mikoshiba ([[Kazuko Yoshiyuki]]) to learn more about the "Newspaper of Terror". After showing fear and reluctance, Mikoshiba tells Ayaka that a lawyer had once contacted her about the newspaper, but he disappeared soon after. While on home, she receives a mysterious phone call from Mikoshiba and decides to visit her home. Inside, Ayaka finds several journals that archived newspapers that foreshadowed future accidents. She finds Mikoshiba lying dead and surrounded by polaroid photos. Grabbing a photo from Mikoshiba's hand, she quickly calls Hideki about the Newspaper of Terror, but he frantically shuts off as he believes she still thinks he is insane.  Meanwhile, Hideki is haunted by premonitions and is restless whenever he sees any newspapers. A student of his, Sayuri Wakakubo ([[Maki Horikita]]) who talks about something that could not be prevented, catches his attention. One night, Hideki sees a newspaper foreshadowing Wakakubo's death. He rushes to Wakakubo's home, but is too late to stop her being stabbed to death by a lunatic. Meeting Ayaka, Hideki tells her about his student's death as well as his premonitions; they agree to team up to solve the case. The two visit the house of Rei Kigata, a man who is reported having researched about the Newspaper of Terror. His house is deserted and covered with dirt. Finding a set of video tapes, they watch the first video dated 13 years ago in 1992, in which Kigata ([[Kei Yamamoto]]) explains that after receiving premonitions, he worked to prevent it, which, while saving people, caused his hand to mysteriously darken as a side effect. The 32nd video shows him covered in ashes and waving at the camera. Hideki and Ayaka eventually find what is left of his remains: a lump of ashes with a vague shape of a human body.  Hideki is uncertain whether he should let people die or save them at the cost of his life like Kigata had, though Ayaka begs him not to. The two reaffirm their relationship and make love. The next day, Ayaka goes work by train when her car breaks down, unknowingly leaving her phone inside. In Ayaka's apartment, Hideki sees a newspaper showing a train accident with more than 100 casualties, including Ayaka. He quickly follows Ayaka and manages to save her, but is unable to save everyone else, including Ayaka's friend, Misato ([[Mayumi Ono (actress)|Mayumi Ono]]). Ayaka notices that Hideki's hand darkens as a side effect. Planning to move together with Ayaka, Hideki packs his belongings, but is confronted by visions of the victims of the accidents, including Misato, Wakakubo, Kigata, and Mikoshiba. He even flashbacks to when he confronted a depressed Ayaka after Nana's death as well as the car accident itself. Knowing that he cannot save both his wife and daughter as long as he is alive, Hideki flashes to the car accident and chooses to remain at his car which explodes shortly after he saved both Ayaka and Nana. A distraught Ayaka screams, while Nana sees the Newspaper of Terror dropping on her, revealing Hideki as the casualty of the car accident.

There, she will await her reign once her grandmother, Queen Clarisse, steps down as Queen. During Mia's twenty first birthday party, she dances with all the eligible bachelors in hope of finding a husband. She becomes attracted to a handsome gentleman named Nicholas. During the course of the night, Mia's tiara falls off and is caught by a Member of Parliament, Viscount Mabrey, who secretly plans to steal Mia's crown. While the Parliament is in-session the next morning, Mia stumbles upon a hidden room that allows her to secretly listen in. Viscount Mabrey reveals his nephew, Lord Devereaux, is another heir to the Genovian throne. Despite Queen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the month. Clarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace, while Mia is shocked to discover Lord Devereaux is actually Nicholas. Mia's best friend, Lilly Moscovitz, surprises her by visiting. Together, they pick through potential husbands. Mia eventually chooses Andrew Jacoby, Duke of Kenilworth, and days later, they are engaged. Mabrey plans to have Nicholas woo Mia and dissolve the engagement.  For a ceremony, Mia is to ride sidesaddle, but is inexperienced. Queen Clarisse provides an [[ancestral]] wooden leg decoy to make it look like she's riding sidesaddle. Mabrey spooks Mia's horse with a rubber snake, and Joe rushes to aid Mia, but accidentally tears off the wooden leg. Humiliated, Mia flees to the stables, where Nicholas fails to comfort her. At a garden party, Mia and Nicholas quarrel about Mia's relationship with Andrew; Nicholas tricks Mia into admitting she doesn't love Andrew. Frustrated, she argues, but instead gets bombarded by a kiss. At first, she kisses him back but then backs away. Nicholas pursues her even more, which causes both of them to fall into a fountain. Queen Clarisse finally tells Mia that her behavior with Nicholas needs to stop.  During the Genovian Independence Day parade, Mia sees some boys harassing a little girl, and abruptly halts the parade to comfort the girl. Learning that the children are orphans, Mia has a vendor give them all tiaras and lets them walk with her in the parade. Everyone is impressed by her act of generosity, while Mabrey sees it as a political maneuver. Mia later decides to convert one of the royal palaces into a temporary children's center. That night, Mia has her bachelorette party, where Queen Clarisse surfs on a mattress and sings a duet with Princess Asana, one of Mia's good friends. In the meantime, Mabrey realizes Nicholas has fallen for Mia, but Nicholas says that Mia will never love him. Nicholas comes upon Mia as she is practicing her archery as part of her [[coronation]] rites. He helps her succeed in getting the arrow to hit the bullseye, something she had been struggling with. Nicholas then informs Mia that he is leaving, but asks to see her just one more time before he goes. She declines, saying she is under close guard.  That night, Nicholas appears outside Mia's window and asks her to come out. Lilly encourages her to go, and Mia sneaks out. They ride out to a lake where they share secrets, dance, and eventually fall asleep. They awaken to find a man in a boat videotaping them. Mia thinks Nicholas set her up, while he insists he had no idea. By the time Mia returns to the palace, the scandalous footage is already being broadcast. Andrew is disappointed and kisses Mia to see if there is a romantic spark between them. They realize that they do not love each other, but do not call off the wedding for the good of Genovia. The wedding is to take place the following day, and Mia's mother, Helen comes with her new husband, Patrick and their newborn son, Trevor. Nicholas decides against attending, but his surly housekeeper, Gretchen, informs him that Mabrey engineered their televised scandal.  Before the wedding, Joe informs Mia that Nicholas is innocent. Queen Clarisse encourages Mia to follow her heart, something she has never done and has now cost her Joe, the only man she truly loved. Mia reenters the church, and after pointing out how her grandmother has ruled Genovia while unmarried for a number of years, she tells the members of parliament in the audience to consider the significant women in their lives and questions if they would have them do what they're trying to force her to do (marry someone she does not love). Mabrey cites the law again and once again suggests that his nephew be named King, but just then, Nicholas not only refuses the crown, but also disowns Mabrey as his uncle. Mia proposes the law on royal marriages be abolished, and the Parliament unanimously gives its assent. Encouraged by Mia to have her own happy ending, Clarisse proposes to Joe and they are promptly married.  About a week later, Mia is preparing for her [[coronation]] when Nicholas shows up.

The Duke has a younger son from a different mother now and receives Tonny coldly, but he ultimately allows Tonny to work for him on a trial basis.

Enraged over the death of his son, Howard Saint acquires confidential information regarding Krieg and learns of his true identity. He orders Castle killed at a family reunion, while his wife Livia requests that his family be killed as well. At the reunion, Saint's men, among them Quentin Glass and Bobby's identical twin, John, kill Castle's entire family and shoot Castle, leaving him for dead. Castle survives and is nursed back to health by a local fisherman.  With the police and FBI unable to pursue the killers, Castle moves into an abandoned apartment occupied by three outcasts, Joan, Bumpo and Dave, and begins his mission to bring the Saints down. With information provided by Mickey Duka, one of Saint's more benevolent and disgruntled associates, Castle studies the Saint family and learns their every move, in the process discovering Glass to be a [[coming out|closeted]] [[gay|homosexual]]. He openly attacks Saint's business and sabotages his partnership with his Cuban partners.  Saint discovers Castle is alive and sends assassins to kill him. The first, Harry Heck, ambushes Castle on a bridge but is killed when Castle slits his throat with a ballistic knife. The second, a Russian behemoth, nearly beats Castle to death in his own apartment. Castle kills him by dousing his face in boiling oil and pushing him down a flight of stairs, breaking his neck. John, Glass and the goons arrive for Castle. The tenants hide Castle and refuse to disclose his location, despite Glass pulling Dave's piercings out with pliers. They leave a one of their men to intercept Castle, but Castle kills him after they leave.  With Mickey's help, Castle arranges for Glass to be at certain places posing as an anonymous blackmailer while planting Livia's car in the same location, and ultimately placing one of Livia's earrings in Glass's bed, leading Saint to believe they are having an affair. Saint confronts and kills Glass in his own home by stabbing him to death, and throws Livia onto a railroad, where she is run over by a train. With Saint despondent, Castle assaults Saint's club and kills every last member of his mob, among them John, though Saint, wounded, escapes. Castle pursues him and shoots him fatally. As Saint lies dying, Castle reveals his schemes that led Saint to kill his friend and wife, and ties him to a car leading to a car park laced with explosives, killing Saint in the ensuing explosion. The fires from the explosion forms the skull logo identical to one on Castle's costume.   Castle returns home and prepares to kill himself with his mission fulfilled, but sees a vision of his wife and changes his mind, instead deciding to continue to fight crime as the Punisher. He leaves some of Saint's money as a farewell gift to the tenants for protecting him, and leaves to pursue [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|his next target]]. The film ends with Castle standing alone on the [[Sunshine Skyway Bridge]], as he vows, "Those who do evil to others...the [[murder|killers]], the [[rape|rapists]], [[psychopathy|psychos]], [[sadomasochism|sadists]]...you will come to know me well.

When she begged her father for him to get her toys that live, when he couldn't get them he tried to live up to his goal as a nice father and went to the length of getting in contact with Bael (the [[demon]] of [[wealth]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profits]]) in which he made a deal to have toys that live in exchange for his soul. The toys which he was given were found in the darkest corners of [[Hell]] and had previously raised a lot of havoc elsewhere. After Erica's father dies, the toy company is handed down to her. After getting fed up with her rude toy companions who fail to behave or follow any of her orders, she does some research and uncovers Andre Toulon's epic tale and learns of the living, loyal puppets who are now in the hands of a former employee at her toy factory that she fired: Robert Toulon. She has had a secret [[spy camera]] in the Toulon residence for a long time and after watching Robert and Alex finally find the formula and bring them to life, she orders a team of thieves to break into the Toulon residence and retrieve the puppets, but when they do the puppets put up a fight and the workshop is set ablaze where the puppets are burnt by the accident from [[Six Shooter (Puppet Master)|Six Shooter]].

That very tree was the one Andre Toulon used to carve his first [[Retro Puppet Master|retro puppets]].  Still being a selfish unforgivable demon like Bael, Jean Paul Toulon's debt still needs to be paid off so he makes a deal with Erica that in exchange of Alex Toulon's life he will let her keep the Toulon puppets and bring all the evil toys to life.

Throughout the film, Terri develops a mutual fondness for Jay, but she faces competition from Robin Childers ([[Lauren C. Mayhew]]), who was involved with Jay the previous summer.

Later, finding him drunk, Terri and her roommate Denise ([[Dana Davis]]) take Jay elsewhere to sober up. When he does, Jay apologizes, and Terri agrees to finish the song they've been working on for the scholarship contest.  At home, Simon learns of Terri's ruse and becomes furious. Simon then flies to Los Angeles to bring Terri home in an effort to keep her safe. On the final day, Simon comes to the school and Terri finds him packing up her belongings; he reams Terri for disobeying and deceiving him, and for turning his own sister and wife against him. She begs him to let her finish what she started and not let the summer go to waste. Ultimately, realizing how selfish he had been acting concedes and allows her to perform. Terri and Jay then perform the song they wrote with Terri dedicating it to Paul. The scholarship prize is won by Denise, yet Simon is proud of his daughter and her talents. He is also glad that her last memory of Paul is one worth having (the concert), as opposed to Simon's own (their argument, and Paul's subsequent restriction to his bedroom). Terri's teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might. Over the end credits, Terri performs for her parents and Nina, with Jay cheering her on.

Red Dust (2004 film)
 Sarah Barcant ([[Hilary Swank]]), a lawyer in [[New York City]] who grew up in [[South Africa]], returns to her childhood dwelling place to intercede for Alex Mpondo ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]), a Black South African politician who was tortured during [[apartheid]]. Under the [[Truth and Reconciliation]] terms, the whole truth must come out. As it is, under duress Mpodo had identified one of his underground comrades, Steve Sizela.  But he also confirms that he kept a much more important secret – a buried list that names some new recruits.  This is still where he left it, years ago.  The full truth now emerges.  Dirk Hendricks ([[Jamie Bartlett]]), the local policeman, admits Sizela was killed by his boss, Piet Muller ([[Ian Roberts (South African actor)|Ian Roberts]]).  Also that much of the torture was carried out at a ranch rather than at the police station – thus confirming Alex's apparently false memories of a 'dirt floor' and a 'tap in the corridor.  Visiting the ranch, he puts details together.  Dirk admits where he buried Steve Sizela.  The bones are found and dug from the ground; Mpondo decides to allow amnesty as the whole truth has been said. Muller, who denied the charges and pleaded not guilty, ironically applies for amnesty himself, infuriating members of the Black South African community.  Parallel with this story is Sarah Barcant's confrontation with her own past.  She was arrested as a teenager for having a black boyfriend, breaking the apartheid laws.  She got out after one night, thanks to Ben Hoffman, a white lawyer who has worked all of his life against apartheid and is a strong believer in 'Truth and Reconciliation'.  Sarah Barcant is there because she owes him a debt, and he is now too weak to take the case himself.  He sees the outcome as positive.  
Red Lights (2004 film)
 One summer mid-afternoon, Antoine (Darroussin) leaves his insurance firm job to meet up with his wife Hélène (Bouquet), as they are to fetch their kids (somewhere distant, but it is not explained as to exactly where they are or who they’re with), and then head on to his in-laws in the ‘Basque Country’ for two weeks vacation, and he wants to beat the traffic (and the two million cars that will be on the road). They arrange to meet at a local bar, but she is late arriving and it gets on his nerves. When she does arrive, it’s clear their relations have been strained for some time.  She wants to go home to shower and have a quick cold dinner, so they do, further frustrating him. They finally get on the road, but after a while the horribly jammed traffic gets to him, and he decides to get off the highway and take ‘the back way’, at least to [[Tours]] anyway. He’s tired, but won’t let her drive, and they bicker. He stops several times along the way to grab a drink or two at local bars, while she sits in the car. He becomes slightly inebriated, further causing tension and argument among them. Her breaking point is reached when he stops again, and she threatens to drive on without him, telling him he can take the train and meet up with her later. He takes the car keys and goes into the bar, where, as he drinks, he sees a news item on the TV about a man who has escaped from a nearby prison. When he eventually leaves the bar and returns to his car, Hélène is not there, having left him a note: “I’m taking the train.”  Somewhat frantic, he drives to the train station nearby to look for her, but the last train of the night has left. He drives on to the next train stop, but is delayed along the way at a police check-point, where they’re looking for the escaped convict. After arriving after midnight and twenty-five minutes too late at the train station, he yet again goes into a bar to drown his sorrows. He tries to strike up a conversation with a large, quiet man, who is not particularly interested in chatting and leaves while Antoine is not looking.  Eventually leaving the bar, Antoine finds the large man outside, asking to hitch a ride on to [[Bordeaux]], which Antoine allows. After being on the road awhile, Antoine realizes the man (Vincent Deniard) is the escaped convict, but this thrills him more than causing any fear. Antoine even openly admires the thug for his 'independent' spirit, and they even manage to get through another check-point.  Antoine stops to buy gasoline, and manages to get a small bottle of whiskey too, downing it almost completely. The convict is annoyed at his drinking, but soon falls asleep, when Antoine, now drunk, runs off the road causing the car’s tire to go flat. The convict demands he change it, but Antoine passes out, so the convict does. The convict slaps Antoine awake, and they get back on the road to Bordeaux. Not much later the convict turns off the road, causing them to argue, and the convict beats Antoine. When he comes to, he finds the convict dragging him from the car out in the woods, likely to be killed and left there. Antoine says, "Make it fast and clean; I don't want to suffer." While the convict retrieves the tire jack from the car to use as a weapon, Antoine manages to hide. The convict finds him and they struggle, Antoine getting hold of the jack, which he uses to beat the convict to death.  He tries to leave, but manages to disable the car, and eventually hitches a ride into town. After making arrangements to get the car fixed, he makes more than a dozen phone calls attempting to locate his wife.  Finally succeeding, he discovers she is in hospital after being wounded in an ‘incident’ at the train station in [[Poitiers]]. He goes to the hospital where she is, whereupon police lieutenant Levet (Jean-Pierre Gos) notifies him his wife was beaten, robbed, and raped by the dangerous convict, whose body has now been discovered. Antoine explains to the lieutenant what had happened between himself and Hélène, but leaves out his subsequent ‘adventure’, of course. The lieutenant may suspect Antoine, but the issue is not pushed any further.  Antoine suffers a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] nightmare as Hélène is recovering, realizing the terrible things he has done. Antoine finally gets in to see Hélène, and apologies for everything. They reconcile and express their love for each other. After another day, leaving the hospital to fetch their kids, the last scene is the two of them driving happily and quietly down a country road.  
The Red Colored Grey Truck
 The story takes place in  June 1991 in [[Yugoslavia]], only a few days before the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav War]]. Ratko ([[Srđan Todorović]]), a [[Bosnian Serb]], leaves [[Belgrade]] prison and steals a red-coloured [[Mercedes-Benz]] truck. The fact that he's (almost pathologically) passionate about stealing trucks and driving them while at the same time being [[colour-blind]] brought him to prison in the first place. Suzana ([[Aleksandra Balmazović]]), an urban Belgrade girl, discovers she is pregnant and wants to do an abortion. As her father, who believes that the emerging chaos won't last, uses their money for a speculative investment, she decides to go to [[Dubrovnik]] to earn the money for abortion.  After nearly running her over while she was hitch-hiking, Ratko decides to give her a lift.  Despite the initial awkwardness and mistrust mostly due to fact that they come from different social background (Ratko coming from a rural countryside and Suzana coming from the big city), they eventually become fond of each other and fall in love.  On their road through Yugoslavian countryside, they enter numerous, sometimes funny sometimes life-threatening, situations and encounter numerous people of virtually all ethnicities, soldiers of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA), smugglers, gunrunners, foreign [[mercenaries]], petty thieves, members of illegal local [[militias]], all of them just waiting for the war to break out.   After witnessing that everything around them starts collapsing, they decide to change route to [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]]-Italian border.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse
   In [[Resident Evil (film)|the previous film]], former security operative [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and environmental activist Matt Addison fought to escape an underground genetic research facility called the Hive, the source of a [[zombie]] outbreak. The pair were part of an attempt to expose illegal experiments being performed there by pharmaceutical company [[Umbrella Corporation]]. The film ended as Alice and Addison were taken into custody by Umbrella.  Umbrella sends a team to the Hive to investigate what happened there; the team is overrun by zombies who quickly spread to the nearby Raccoon City. Umbrella responds by quarantining the city and evacuating their personnel from it. Angela Ashford, the daughter of Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford, goes missing after her security car is involved in a collision. Alice awakens in a deserted hospital and wanders the city in search of supplies, while Umbrella uses the only bridge out of the area to evacuate civilians. At the bridge, disgraced police officer [[Jill Valentine]] meets with her former partner, Sgt. Payton Wells. A zombie bites and infects Wells. In response to the virus reaching the bridge, Major Timothy Cain, leader of the Umbrella forces in Raccoon City, seals the exit and forces the residents to return to the city.  After being abandoned by their employer following a failed attempt to rescue a civilian, Umbrella soldiers [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Oliveira]] and Nicholai Ginovaef team up with the Raccoon City Police [[List of Resident Evil characters#STARS|Special Tactics And Rescue Squad]] (STARS) to repel zombie attacks. Their position is overrun, and Oliveira is bitten and infected. At a separate location, Valentine, Wells, and news reporter Terri Morales, are about to be overrun, though they are saved by Alice. Umbrella deploys a heavily mutated experimental [[supersoldier]], [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]], who kills the remaining STARS members before searching for Alice. Dr. Ashford hacks into the city's [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] system and uses it to contact Alice and the other survivors, offering to arrange their evacuation from the city in exchange for help in locating his daughter. He makes an identical offer to Olivera and Ginovaef, and explains that Umbrella intends to rid Raccoon City of the zombie infection by destroying it using a nuclear bomb.  Alice and the others head to Angela's location, where they are ambushed by Nemesis. Valentine kills Wells after he turns into a zombie. Alice engages Nemesis but is wounded and forced to retreat separately, luring Nemesis away from the rest of the group. Valentine and Morales continue, picking up stranded civilian L.J. en route. Valentine meets Olivera and they find and rescue Angela, although Morales and Ginovaef are both killed. Angela reveals that the zombie outbreak is the result of a virus created by her father to treat the genetic disease from which she suffers: only by regularly injecting herself with the virus is Angela able to survive, though she must also take anti-virus serum to prevent turning into a zombie. Alice uses some of the anti-virus to cure Olivera. Dr. Ashford gives Alice the location of an extraction point where a helicopter awaits. The group makes it to the rendezvous point, but are ambushed by Umbrella forces. Major Cain kills Dr. Ashford and forces Alice to fight Nemesis. Alice gains the upper hand over the supersoldier, though she ceases fighting after realizing that he is Matt Addison, mutated by Umbrella's experiments.  Nemesis turns on Major Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops, but is killed protecting Alice. The rest of the survivors seize the helicopter; they eject Major Cain from it and he is eaten by zombies, including a zombified Dr. Ashford. As the survivors escape, the nuclear bomb detonates over the city, and the resulting blast wave causes the helicopter to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela and is impaled on a metal pole. TV footage attributes the nuclear attack to a meltdown of the city's power plant, covering up Umbrella's involvement. Alice wakes up in an Umbrella research facility and escapes with help from Olivera, Valentine, L.J., and Angela. As they are escaping, Dr. Alexander Isaacs, a high-ranking Umbrella employee, reveals that Alice's escape is part of Umbrella's plan for her.

In the language of science, it is a 'multi-dimensional hologram' in the form of a seed. Meanwhile, Bhuria ([[Sunil Shetty]]), a [[Rakshasa]], mentally communicates with Varun, so they can share their abilities since neither of them can utilize full power of the Rudraksha alone.

Saints and Soldiers
 In 1944, Allied troops have defeated the Germans after the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. In [[Malmedy]], [[Belgium]], they find and uncover the frozen bodies of over 70 American soldiers who were held prisoners and killed by their German captors. Three weeks earlier, the prisoners, members of the [[101st Airborne Division]] and [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]] are rounded up and searched by the German troops while medic Steven Gould ([[Alexander Polinsky|Alexander Niver]]) tries to help a seriously wounded American soldier. One soldier tries to escape, and is shot dead, causing confusion and fear from the prisoners. The Germans open fire on the prisoners, in what is known as the [[Malmedy massacre]], killing many troops as they try to run away. The soldier Gould tried to save is shot dead and Gould manages to escape with Corporal Nathan 'Deacon' Greer ([[Corbin Allred]]). Deacon disarms a German but doesn't shoot him, even at Gould's insistence.  Gould and Deacon are joined by two other survivors, Shirl Kendrick ([[Larry Bagby]]), a member in Gould's division, and Deacon's close friend Sergeant Gordon Gunderson ([[Peter Holden|Peter Asle Holden]]). Gunderson explains it would be better to hide out until the Allies retake the area and the four hide out in an abandoned building. When a German patrol comes along, the soldiers hide under the floor. While there Deacon loosely translates a German message about a downed plane in the area. Leaving after the Germans, the Americans find [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot [[Flight Sergeant]] Oberon Winley ([[Kirby Heyborne]]).  Winley explains he has important [[military intelligence|intelligence]] photographs he has to get back to the Allies and the group decide to try and reach the Allied lines some 20 miles away. While on point, Deacon has a [[hallucination]] and breaks down. Gunderson explains that Deacon had inadvertently, when clearing a building during an earlier mission, killed two women and six children recently. Gould begins to criticize Deacon for not shooting the German and for being religious. Deacon offers him his [[Book of Mormon]], which Gould refuses. Deacon says that Gould is asking too many questions for someone who is not interested in religion.  Shortly afterwards, Kendrick falls through the roof of an old building that had been covered by the snow. Looking for shelter, Gunderson enters a house and finds a woman and girl who speak [[French language|French]], Catherine and Sophie Theary. A coming snow storm causes Gunderson to surmise that the Germans will be pinned down and immobilized. He suggests staying the night but Winley insists that he must get the information to the Allied troops and leaves during the storm. The others are sure he will die in the cold.  Catherine brings some bread to the soldiers. While she is with the soldiers, two Germans arrive and Catherine talks to them. One German starts scouting the building while the other attempts to rape Catherine. She yells and Deacon kills one German and misses the other as he runs into the woods. Winley returns with this German as his prisoner. Deacon recognizes the German as Rudolph, a convert during his mission serving as a minister for his Church in [[Berlin]]. Deacon understands then why he, who was well known for never failing to hit what he aimed at, missed Rudolph.  In the morning, Deacon has let Rudolph go, after Rudolph had told him where the Germans lines were and how to get through them. With captured weapons they set out but soon encounter a small group of German soldiers. Gunderson is fatally shot by a sniper, whom Deacon then kills. More Germans attack and Winley is hit in the leg. During the firefight the Allied group is split in two. While carrying Winley, Kendrick is shot in the stomach and dies. Winley kills the German and, trying to hobble away, falls into a river. Deacon and Gould find him. While they care for Winley, Rudolph finds them and tells them where there is a jeep, and an escape route they could use with it closer to the Allied lines, then goes off in the direction of the pursuing Germans.  The three remaining Allied soldiers, now dressed as German soldiers, get in the [[Willys MB|jeep]] and head toward the German lines. They manage to talk their way past a German guard (as Deacon speaks fluent German) but when they veer towards the American lines the Germans open fire. Speeding toward the safety of the American lines (where observers work out they are Allied soldiers) the jeep is overturned by mortar fire. Deacon gives covering fire as Gould and Winley head for safety. Deacon is killed by a sniper, and before he dies, he sees the spirits of the women and children he killed one last time. Gould and Winley make it through and the important intelligence is passed on to headquarters. Winley is then transported to a medical station because of his injuries.  As Gould sees Deacon's body being carried away, he takes out Deacon's Book of Mormon, places the photo of Deacon's wife into Deacon's hands and keeps the book, which Deacon had offered to him earlier, and wishes him to rest in peace. After this, he looks up and sees a [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighter flying over, signaling that the weather is improving, and the turning of the tide in the Battle. Gould encounters a now captured Rudolph, nods to him, with Rudolph answering back in kind, and then helps an injured German soldier whom he recognizes from the massacre at the start of the film.  
Saint Ange
 In 1958, Anna Jurin accepts a job as a housekeeper of Saint Ange, a rusty and isolated orphanage located in the [[French Alps]] and owned by Madam Francard. The last batch of children have been sent elsewhere shortly after the mysterious death of a boy in the bathroom, which tarnishes the orphanage's reputation and threatens its closure. Other than Anna, the orphanage is now populated by only two people: the long-time cook Helenka and an adult orphan, Judith, who suffers from a mental disability and claims that there are other, unseen, children in the location.  Throughout her stay, Anna experiences apparent supernatural phenomena. However, Helenka dismisses her worries as mere hallucinations, especially after she learns that Anna is pregnant due to a [[gang rape]], a fact that she tries to hide at first. Anna learns that Judith is one of the many sent to Saint Ange in 1946 as a war orphan of [[World War II]]; because of shortages of supplies and logistics, Judith is the only survivor.  Despite this explanation, Anna suspects that the orphanage deliberately killed and hid the children. She gains the trust of Judith by befriending and calming her when her kittens are apparently drowned by Helenka, enough for her to disclose that the children inhabit an area somewhere behind a mirror in bathroom, revealed to be an abandoned dormitory. Helenka tries to prevent them from heading to the area, but Judith knocks her unconscious. The two women proceed to the dormitory and find remains of toys and rotten food. Judith realizes that the children had really died and begs Anna to stop searching, but the latter insists on continuing and boards an elevator heading to the underground. Anna arrives at a sterile, hospital-like structure with clean white walls and brightly lit lamps. She is confronted by the children who rise from a series of murky baths, who surround her. Anna goes into a sudden labor and is helped to deliver the baby by the children.  Sometime later, Francard and her assistant search for Anna in the underground, which is now damp, dark, and rust-walled. They find Anna and her baby on the floor, both dead. Deciding to leave them there, the two head upstairs to leave the premises alongside Helenka and Judith; it is implied that Anna has been hallucinating the phenomena due to the stress, as she is revealed to be the true culprit for the drowning of the kittens. However, before they leave, Judith throws away her medication, as Anna advised her earlier, and peeks into Anna's former bedroom, where she sees her and her baby, now as spirits of Saint Ange, alongside the dead children.

She and her two best friends, Hilary Faye ([[Mandy Moore]]) and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai), have formed a [[girl group]] called the Christian Jewels.

In her shock, Mary hits her head in the pool, and has a vision in which [[Jesus]] tells her that she must do everything she can to help Dean. Hoping for a sign, Mary goes to a shooting range with Hilary Faye, who has a "spiritual solution for everything," and tells Mary (not knowing about the situation with Dean) that, if all else fails, Jesus could still restore their "spiritual and emotional virginity." Believing that Jesus will restore her purity, Mary sacrifices her virginity to have sex with Dean in an attempt to restore his heterosexuality.  Despite Mary's efforts, when she comes by Dean's house on the morning of the first day of school, Dean's parents tell her that they found gay [[pornography]] under his bed, and that they're sending him to Mercy House, a Christian treatment center.

When they arrive at school, they see Cassandra Edelstein ([[Eva Amurri]]), the school's only Jewish student, and a rebel who despises Hilary. In homeroom, Mary meets new student Patrick ([[Patrick Fugit]]), who is the son of the school's principal, Pastor Skip Wheeler ([[Martin Donovan]]), a skateboarder who has been doing [[missionary]] work (through skateboarding) in South America. Mary tries to put up a good front at the assembly, in which Cassandra fakes [[speaking in tongues]] in order to get under the skins of the other students.  Mary soon realizes that she is pregnant from her encounter with Dean. When she goes to [[Planned Parenthood]] to confirm the pregnancy, she is seen by Roland and Cassandra. Roland reveals that he is not really a Christian, unlike his fanatically religious sister.  Cassandra reveals she is only at American Eagle after being thrown out of her old school, and decided she could "handle the freaks" at American Eagle over being home-schooled by her parents.  Roland and Cassandra bond over their shared skepticism. Mary finds out that she's not due to give birth until after her high school graduation and decides to hide her condition from her friends and family until then.  However, she feels forsaken by Jesus and loses her faith, causing her to be ostracized by Hilary, and replaced in the Christian Jewels with a previously unpopular girl, Tia ([[Heather Matarazzo]]), who's been struggling to get into the Christian Jewels for years. Later, after Pastor Skip gets word about Mary, he tells the Jewels to help Mary regain her faith, but they seem to misunderstand him and stop Mary in the street and try to [[exorcise]] her of demons instead.  By Christmas, Mary is still hiding her pregnancy. Cassandra mocks her about it when they are alone in the bathroom, but when she realizes Mary's anguish, Cassandra changes her tone and offers her support. They cut school with Roland, and the three of them become good friends. When they run into Patrick and Hilary at the mall, Cassandra distracts Hilary (pretending she wants to be [[religious conversion|converted]]) while Patrick and Mary sneak away, and Patrick confesses his feelings for Mary. Pastor Skip warns his son against dating Mary, even as Pastor Skip (still married to his wife, although they live separate lives) has been secretly dating Mary's mother, Lillian ([[Mary-Louise Parker]]).  A few months later, after multiple fights at school between Hilary Faye and Cassandra, Pastor Skip puts Roland, Cassandra and Mary on the school prom committee (chaired by Hilary Faye) to punish them. While working together, Patrick asks Mary to go with him to the prom, which Mary accepts, but as friends. Later that day, Roland and Cassandra get their hands on a picture of a younger, much heavier, and much more awkward Hilary Faye, and load it onto the desktop of every computer in the school. The next day, someone vandalizes the school with [[graffiti]]. Mary and Cassandra are initially the prime suspects, and to their shock, the spray cans are found in their lockers. While searching the lockers with the Jewels looking on, Mary's homeroom teacher finds a [[Medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] of Mary's baby. She tries to hide it, but it drops to the ground in front of Pastor Skip's feet. Cassandra is expelled from school, while Mary is banned from the prom.  Pastor Skip tells Lillian that he will break off their relationship if she does not send Mary to Mercy House. Lillian decides that she's going to send Mary away, saying that it's the best thing for Mary and the baby, but secretly because she doesn't want Skip to break up with her. Despite being banned, Cassandra and Roland scheme to go to prom, and to bring Mary with them, providing her with a dress and inviting Patrick to meet them.  Roland also finds that Hilary Faye charged several cans of spray paint to her credit card just hours before the attack — indicating that ''she'' was the one who spray-painted the school.  Hilary Faye, Tia, and Veronica head to the prom. On their way in, Tia finds a credit-card receipt for the spray paint—signed by Hilary Faye. When Mary, Patrick, Cassandra and Roland arrive, Hilary attempts to have Mary and Cassandra thrown out, but Pastor Skip decides to let them stay. The four then accuse Hilary Faye of committing the vandalism herself, and framing Mary and Cassandra for it as revenge for humiliating her. Hilary Faye attempts to swear before God that she is innocent, but Tia, fed up with Hilary Faye's lies and [[hypocrisy]], reveals the signed receipt to everyone, exposing Hilary as the true vandal. Veronica turns on Hilary as well, calling her a fake.  As the now-exposed Hilary Faye flees with the others in pursuit, Dean suddenly arrives with other teenagers from Mercy House. Dean is surprised, but not upset, by Mary's pregnancy; he meets Patrick warmly, and Mary is similarly accepting towards Dean's roommate/boyfriend Mitch. Pastor Skip tries to send the new arrivals back to Mercy House, but they refuse, and Mary and her friends support them. Suddenly, Hilary crashes her van into the school's huge effigy of Jesus. Realizing what she has done, she breaks down in tears of regret. Cassandra shows some sympathy towards Hilary, feeling sorry for her. As paramedics arrive to the accident scene, Mary abruptly goes into labor and is taken to the hospital. There, Mary gives birth to a girl.  In her hospital room, Mary's and Dean's friends and family crowd around the baby girl, while Pastor Skip waits outside debating whether to come in. In a voice-over, Mary tells the audience how she has returned to believing in a God who loves and helps the ones that love and help others in need.  
Saw (2004 film)
 Adam, a [[photographer]], awakens in a bathtub in a large dilapidated bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an [[oncologist]], is chained to a pipe across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a [[revolver]] and a [[microcassette]] recorder. Each man finds a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two [[hacksaw]]s inside a toilet; which they try to use to cut through their chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant to be used for their chains, but for their feet, and identifies their captor as the [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|Jigsaw Killer]], whom Lawrence knows of because he was once a suspect.  [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] show that while Lawrence was discussing the terminal brain cancer of a patient named John Kramer he was approached by Detectives [[David Tapp]] and [[Steven Sing]], who found his [[penlight]] at the scene of a Jigsaw "game". Lawrence's alibi cleared him, but he agreed to view the testimony of the only known survivor of one of Jigsaw's games, a [[heroin]] addict named [[Amanda Young]], who escaped a "reverse bear trap", and ultimately believes that Jigsaw helped her.  Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon are being held captive in their home by a man who is watching Adam and Lawrence through a camera hidden behind the bathroom's two-way mirror. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after Amanda's testimony and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from Amanda's game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing was killed by a quadruple shotgun trap while pursuing him. Still convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp continued stalking him after his discharge.  In the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box containing two cigarettes, a lighter, and a one-way cellphone. He then recalls his abduction: he was trying to use his phone after being trapped in a parking garage, and was suddenly attacked by a pig-masked figure. They try to use a cigarette dipped in the corpse's poisoned blood to stage Adam's death, but the plan fails when Adam is zapped through his ankle chain. Adam then recalls his own abduction: he was in his photo development room when the power went out and, after finding [[Billy the Puppet|a puppet]], he was attacked by the same pig-masked figure.  Alison calls Lawrence at gunpoint and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was being paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the bag containing the hacksaws. Adam also reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students; who he had visited the night he was abducted. After urging Adam to describe the man who was paying him, Lawrence realizes that it was Tapp. Adam then finds a photo he ''didn't'' take, of a man staring out a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep, an orderly at his hospital. Unfortunately, the clock strikes six as he realizes this, and Zep moves to kill Alison and Diana.  Alison manages to free herself and fights Zep for the gun, after he calls Lawrence. The struggle gets Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is eventually shot in the chest after a brief struggle. Lawrence, aware only of gunshots and screaming, is electrically shocked as well and loses reach of the phone. In desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence because it is "the rules", but Adam, who only suffered a flesh wound, overpowers Zep and bludgeons him to death with the toilet tank lid. As Lawrence crawls out of the room to find help, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another microcassette recorder, which reveals that Zep was another victim following rules in order to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body. As the tape ends, the "corpse" rises and is revealed to be Lawrence's patient John Kramer, the real Jigsaw killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain was in the bathtub he woke up in, which went down the drain when Adam first woke up. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John activates a remote control, shocking Adam. John then shuts off the lights, and yells "Game Over" before slamming the door shut, leaving Adam to die.  
Scarecrow Gone Wild
 Sam (Caleb Roehrig) is one of the freshman on the baseball team who are being hazed by upperclassmen, including his friend Jack (Matthew Linhardt). Because Sam needs a scholarship to attend college, Jack gave him a urine sample so that no one would know he was [[diabetic]] and he would make the team, thus giving him a chance at a scholarship.  Although Jack promises his coach that there will be no hazing, the rest of the team (and some girls) go to the haunted corn field and continue the hazing. The hazing ritual comes to a bitter end in a haunted cornfield when the baseball players mistake one of Sam's [[diabetes|diabetic]] attacks with Sam trying to start a fight. They tie him up to the scarecrow and leave him for dead. Sam becomes the evil Scarecrow who decides to seek bloody revenge on his tormentors and pretty much everyone else in the film. The only way for Jack and his friends to stop the scarecrow is by getting their friend out of his coma, a task which proves to be near impossible since the nearest hospital is conveniently under construction. After a series of attacks by the scarecrow the students finally figure out how to stop him and bring back their friend.  The movie skips to 3 weeks after the attacks, and show Jack and his new girlfriend (a survivor of the scarecrow's attack) getting ready to pick the coach up to take him to his [[red-eye flight]], and Sam and baseball jock, Mike getting ready to attend a sorority party. Just as things are beginning to look up for our protagonists, Sam murders Mike and the coach. He then chases Jack and his girlfriend into a chapel where they battle for the final time. Suddenly the scarecrow (Sam) also has the power to shoot what looks like electrical currents out of his hands. Through their epic battle Jack somehow becomes the scarecrow and does the logical thing, impaling himself on a nearby cross.

Secret Window
 Author Mort Rainey catches his wife Amy having an affair with Ted. Depressed and suffering from [[writer's block]], Mort delays finalizing the [[divorce]] and retreats to his cabin at Tashmore Lake in [[upstate New York]]. A man named John Shooter, accuses Mort of [[plagiarism|plagiarizing]] his short story, "Sowing Season". Upon reading Shooter's manuscript, Mort discovers its resemblance to his own story, "Secret Window", except for the ending.  The following day, Mort tells Shooter that his story was published years before Shooter's. Shooter demands proof and warns Mort against involving the police. That night, Mort finds his dog Chico killed and reports to Sheriff Dave Newsome.  Mort drives to his house in Riverdale to retrieve a copy of the magazine his story was published in, but leaves when he sees Amy and Ted. He contacts [[private investigator]] Ken Karsch for help. Ken agrees to travel to Tashmore Lake to watch the cabin and talk to Tom Greenleaf, a resident who might have seen Shooter talking to Mort. Shooter visits Mort at the cabin and demands Mort revise the ending of "Secret Window" to Shooter's version, where the protagonist kills his wife. Shooter then attacks and chokes Mort.  Amy calls Mort, saying their house was burned down. Mort travels to Riverdale and the two are questioned by a police officer. Ken calls Mort and says Tom Greenleaf denied seeing Mort. Ken suspects Tom was threatened by Shooter. They agree to confront Shooter together and arrange a meeting with Tom at a local diner.  The next morning, Mort oversleeps. Arriving at the diner, he learns that Ken and Tom didn't show up. Seeing Ted at a gas station, Mort approaches him and Ted demands Mort sign the divorce papers. The two have a confrontation and Ted breaks his own hand. Shooter calls Mort to a meeting place. When he arrives, Mort finds Ken and Tom dead inside Tom's truck and faints. When he wakes up, Shooter says they were murdered with Mort's screwdriver for interfering with his business. Mort has the magazine as proof and Shooter agrees to meet at Mort's cabin. He leaves and Mort covers up the crime by removing his screwdriver from Tom's head and running the truck into a water-filled stone quarry.  Amy calls Mort, reminiscing about a [[miscarriage]] she had suffered during their marriage in hopes that she can convince him to sign the divorce papers, but Mort refuses once again, causing her to drive to his cabin to try and convince him in person. Afterwards, Mort picks up the magazine sent by his literary agent. He finds the package already opened and the pages containing the story cut out. Back at his cabin, Mort sees Shooter's hat. Mort wears the hat and begins speaking to himself, trying to make sense of the events. Mort realizes that Shooter is just a figment of his imagination; brought to life through Mort's undetected [[dissociative identity disorder]], and carried out malevolent tasks like killing Chico, Tom, Ken and burning down his house.  When Amy arrives at the cabin, she finds it in disorder, with the word "SHOOTER" carved repeatedly on the walls. Mort appears behind her and Amy realizes that the name represents Mort's desire to "SHOOT HER". Mort, speaking with Shooter's accent and wearing his hat, chases Amy and stabs her in the ankle. Concerned about Amy's safety, Ted arrives and is ambushed by Mort, who hits him in the face with a shovel. Amy watches helplessly as Mort beheads Ted with the shovel. Mort recites the ending of "Sowing Season" as he kills Amy as well.  Mort recovers from writer's block and experiences a mood improvement. Sheriff Newsome later stops by the cabin to warn Mort that he is the prime suspect in Amy and Ted's disappearances. Mort dismisses the threat and the Sheriff leaves. In Mort's room there is a secret window that overlooks a secret garden. It is implied that the bodies are buried in the garden, which is now a cornfield, and the police will probably never find them. Mort is seen eating corn for dinner and the screen cuts to black.  
Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed
 [[Mystery Inc.]] ([[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]], [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]], [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]]) attend the opening of an exhibition at the Coolsonian [[Criminology]] Museum commemorating their past solved cases with monster costumes on display. However, the celebrations are interrupted by a masked man known as the Evil Masked Figure who steals two costumes using the reanimated [[Pterodactyl]] Ghost. The gang are ridiculed by journalist Heather Jasper Howe, who starts a [[smear campaign]] against them. Concluding an old enemy is the mastermind, the gang revisit old cases, dismissing the former Pterodactyl Ghost, Jonathan Jacobo, due to his death during a failed [[prison escape]], they guess that Jeremiah Wickles, the Black Knight Ghost's portrayer and Jacobo's cell mate in prison, is the culprit.  Going to Wickles' mansion, the group fall through a trapdoor and into a cage targeting unwelcome callers, but escape with the aid of Daphne's cosmetics. Inside, the gang find a book that serves as an instruction manual on how to create monsters. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo find a note inviting Wickles to visit the Faux Ghost nightclub. They are attacked by the Black Knight Ghost, but escape when Daphne fights him off while Velma discovers its weak spot and disables it. Before fleeing, the rest of the gang had previously discovered through the book found in Wickles' mansion that the key ingredient to creating the monsters was a substance called "randomonium", which can be found at the old silver [[mining town]].  After Daphne helps Velma overcome her fears of intimacy and assert herself by changing up her image, Daphne, Velma and Fred go to the museum accompanied by the curator Patrick Wisely, but discover that the rest of the costumes have been stolen. Heather Jasper Howe ridicules the gang further by turning the city against them. The gang go to the mines, finding Wickles' plans to turn it into an [[amusement park]]. As they confront Wickles, he states that he and Jacobo were cell mates who hated each other, and denies any connection to the museum robberies.  Shaggy and Scooby, after overhearing the rest of the gang criticizing their tendency to bumble every operation, and especially their most recent offense in failing to secure the Pterodactyl Ghost at the museum, resolve to better themselves and become real detectives. Following the lead from Wickles' note, their first clue ever, they sneak into the Faux Ghost wearing disguises to try and solve the mystery. After speaking to Wickles, they learn he has resolved his ways. Scooby eventually causes a scene and his disguise falls off, leading Scooby and Shaggy to escape through a trash chute. On their way out, they spot Patrick uncharacteristically assaulting someone who appears to be a member of his staff, ordering him to find answers to who vandalized his museum. Escaping an awkward interaction with Patrick, Shaggy and Scooby spot Wickles leaving the club and follow him.  The gang then find the Monster Hive where the costumes are brought to life as real monsters. Shaggy and Scooby play around with the machine's control panel, bringing several costumes to life, and the gang flee with the panel as the Evil Masked Figure terrorizes the city. Escaping to their old high school clubhouse, the gang realize they can reverse the control panel's power by altering its wiring. Captain Cutler's Ghost emerges from the [[bayou]], forcing the gang to head back to the mines, encountering the various monsters along the way. Velma sees Patrick in the mines, finding a shrine dedicated to Jacobo built by Patrick, but Patrick proves his innocence by helping Velma after a catwalk unexpectedly gives way under her.  The gang confront the Evil Masked Figure, but the Tar Monster captures and attempts to drown all of them, but Scooby escapes, and uses a [[fire extinguisher]] to freeze the Tar Monster's body. He reactivates the control panel, transforming the costumes back to normal. The gang take the Evil Masked Figure to the authorities, unmasking him as Heather. When asked why Heather did what she did, Velma suddenly pulls and peels Heather's face off, revealing she is actually Jacobo in disguise; Jacobo had actually survived the fall from the prison wall, and sought to get revenge on Mystery, Inc. by discrediting them. Jacobo's cameraman Ned is also arrested as an accomplice.  Mystery, Inc. are praised as heroes once again in Coolsville. In the Faux Ghost, the gang celebrates their victory with the now reformed criminals, whom they unmasked in the past (including Wickles).  After the credits, Scooby-Doo is seen playing a ''Scooby-Doo 2'' [[Game Boy Advance]] game. After he succeeds, he tells the viewers to enter the ''Scooby-Doo 2'' Game Boy Advance code.

Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster
 The Mystery, Inc. gang travel to [[Loch Ness]] in [[Scotland]] to see the famous Blake Castle, the home of [[Daphne Blake]]'s Scottish ancestors as well as her cousin, Shannon. The castle grounds are home to the first annual [[Highland games]], composed of many traditional Scottish sports. When they arrive, Shannon informs them that the castle has recently been terrorized by the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Shannon says she has seen the monster and it is indeed real, a position shared by Del Chillman, the Loch Ness Monster enthusiast and amateur [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]], and Professor Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has staked her whole career on proving the monster exists. Taking the opposite end of the argument are Colin and Angus Haggart, their father Lachlan, local competitors in the games, and Sir Ian Locksley, the head judge of the games (as well as director of the Scottish natural history museum). Locksley and Pembrooke share a mutual hatred for each other (she was Ian's research assistant at his museum until he fired her for spending too much time on the Loch Ness Monster's trail).  That night, [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] are chased by the monster, and destroy the playing field in the process. Velma discovers that the Loch Ness Monster tracks head into town instead of the loch. The next day, the gang and Shannon travel to [[Drumnadrochit]]. After enlisting the help of the Haggart's to rebuild the field, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], Daphne, [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] and Shannon take Professor Pembrooke's boat, filled up with out of date research equipment, to search for the Loch Ness Monster by sea, while Shaggy and Scooby take the Mystery Machine and search by land. While Shaggy is distracted, a hand switches a sign on the road leading to Shaggy getting lost. Both groups are attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, which is seemingly in two places at once.  After returning the badly damaged boat back to Professor Pembrooke, the gang discovers Sir Ian has taken it upon himself to patrol the waters with a high-tech ship to prevent any further "peculiarities", as he is still not convinced of the monster's existence. On Locksley's ship, the gang and Shannon find something deep in the loch using sonar equipment. They take Locksley's [[midget submarine|mini-sub]] down to investigate. In the water, the gang is attacked by the Loch Ness Monster, but is saved by a large magnet claw on the ship (before reaching the surface, the Loch Ness Monster knocks the submarine's sonar camera off of its hull). When they return to Blake Castle, they find Del sleeping in the Mystery Machine, who explains his van has been stolen. The Loch Ness Monster later chases the gang, Shannon and Del into a bog, where it is revealed to simply be a canvas covering Chillman’s van. Fred deduces the Loch Ness Monster to be a decoy, and sets up a trap to catch the real one.  Fred sends Shaggy and Scooby out on the loch to act as bait, while he and Del prepare to use nets to surround the cove to capture the Loch Ness Monster. A large fog appears, blocking visual contact with Shaggy and Scooby. Making matters worse, Locksley’s crew mutinies because they want to capture and sell the Loch Ness Monster, and capture Daphne, Shannon, and Locksley himself. The Loch Ness Monster attacks Shaggy and Scooby, chasing them out of the cove. Locksley’s ship attaches to the nets, dragging Del and Fred with it. The crew attempts to harpoon the Loch Ness Monster, but Daphne and Shannon distract them long enough to make them miss. Just as the Loch Ness Monster is about to attack Del, Fred, and Locksley Daphne captures it by using the ship’s magnetic claw. All of a sudden, a second Loch Ness Monster appears and gives chase to Shaggy and Scooby, but falls into a previously set trap. This monster is revealed to be a huge puppet controlled by the Haggart brothers, and the one Daphne captured is revealed to be a home-made submarine operated by Professor Pembrooke. Pembrooke used a secret entrance in her boat to go into the Loch Ness Monster and operate it. She also hired the Haggart brothers to man the second monster on the assumption that they wanted to sabotage the games, but Angus and Colin reveal that they just wanted to do it as a [[prank]]. Velma explains that Pembrooke’s plan was to use her machine to convince Locksley the real monster existed, and enlist his aide in finding it.  The next day, the games begin on schedule, but Locksley calls everyone to his ship to look at new pictures of the monster that his mini-sub's sunken (and yet obviously still working) camera had taken, at a depth well below what a ramshackle home-made submarine like Pembrooke's could survive. These, plus three other photos that Pembrooke had taken several days earlier are enough to convince him that the Loch Ness Monster might be real. The film ends with the gang leaving Blake Castle, during which Velma admits that she is actually glad they didn't find out if the Loch Ness Monster was real. Velma's reason for this being, "Some mysteries are best left unsolved." The final scene shows Scooby briefly seeing what could be the real Loch Ness Monster swimming by them in the water.  
The Seat Filler
 Derrick, an aspiring lawyer who is studying for the bar exam, struggles to keep his head above water financially. His best friend and roommate E.J. suggests Derrick join him at his job as a seat filler at awards shows. When seat filling at the Video Beat awards gala, Derrick meets popular R&B singer Jhnelle, who mistakes him for a regular guest. Believing that he is Alonzo Grant, entertainment lawyer to the stars, Jhnelle asks Derrick out on a date.  During the date Derrick tells Jhnelle that he is not Alonzo Grant and that he cannot afford the meal, but she says she was planning to pay for it anyway and laughs, believing Derrick to be kidding. They leave the restaurant with plans for a second date.  Derrick plans on cancelling the date because he cannot afford it, but E.J. tells him not to worry and that he's got everything covered as long as he takes him along.

They get off and walk around town, where Derrick again tries to tell Jhnelle the truth, but she interrupts him with a kiss.  The next day Jhnelle leaves a message on Derrick's phone saying she wants to have lunch and that she'll meet him at "his" office. Derrick panics over what to do and E.J. yells at him to run. He quickly gets dressed and runs to the building where Alonzo works and is just in time to meet Jhnelle there, suggesting they do something "better than lunch" which is a movie at a theater in the hood.

Sethurama Iyer CBI
 The movie begins with [[Sethurama Iyer]] ([[Mammootty|Mammooty]]) visiting Isow Alex ([[Kalabhavan Mani]]), a convicted serial killer who is awaiting his execution. Alex was arrested and convicted for the cold-blooded murder of seven people in two different families. Alex, who had been living a wild life then, had committed the crime high on narcotic drugs. The murder case was left to the CBI for investigation and an able officer, played by Siddique, nabbed Alex in no time. Alex is now a new man, mainly due to the influence of a priest (Gopi), who requests Iyer to visit Alex.  What Alex tells Iyer is startling; he didn't commit one of the seven murders he was convicted for. The murder was that of Manikkunju, a businessman. Manikkunju, along with his daughter-in-law Mosi, was murdered at his house. Alex tells this all the same confessing that he murdered Mosi. The possibility of another killer involved is very remote and Alex is a serial killer who thoroughly denied any hand in the murders when he was arrested, but yet Iyer decides to reopen the case and investigate. He faces many odds; to prove Alex right would be proving his own bureau wrong and to prove Alex wrong would be wasting time and money.  It was later revealed that Mani had an affair with Mosi and they were caught in a compromising position by Manikkunju. Since Mani was married he did not wish his affair to be leaked and hence he murdered Manikkunju.

His teacher turns out to be not Paulina, but the older Miss Mitzi, and John proves to be just as clumsy as his equally clueless classmates Chic and Vern on the dance-floor. Even worse, when he does meet Paulina, she icily tells John she hopes he has come to the studio to seriously study dance and not to look for a date. But, as his lessons continue, John falls in love with dancing. Keeping his new obsession from his family and co-workers, John feverishly trains for Chicago's biggest dance competition. His friendship with Paulina blossoms, as his enthusiasm rekindles her own lost passion for dance. But the more time John spends away from home, the more his wife Beverly becomes suspicious.

Shankar Dada M.B.B.S.
 Shankar Prasad, nicknamed "Shankar Dada" (literally "Brother Shankar") is a bhai or gunda: a crime don in Hyderabad. Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor, he creates the faux Sri Satya Prasad Charitable Hospital (named after his father) and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father ([[Girish Karnad]]) and mother ([[Venniradai Nirmala]]) visit him in Hyderabad.  One year, however, Shankar's plan goes awry when his father meets an old acquaintance, Dr. Ramalingeswara Rao ([[Paresh Rawal]]) and the two older men decide to marry Shankar to Ramalingeswara Rao's daughter, Dr. Sunitha "Chitti" ([[Sonali Bendre]]). At this point the truth about Shankar is revealed. Ramalingeswara Rao insults Shankar's parents and calls them "fools" for being ignorant of Shankar's real life. Shankar's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village. Shankar, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and to gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Ramalingeswara Rao is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an M.B.B.S. degree, the graduate medical degree in South Asia.  With the help of his right-hand man A.T.M. ([[Srikanth (Telugu actor)|Srikanth]]) and others, Shankar "gains admission" to the Osmania College of Medical Sciences, where he again encounters Dr. Ramalingeswara Rao, who is the dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the (coerced) help of faculty member Dr. Mohammad Rafi (Surya). While Shankar Dada's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the "Jantar Mantar" (Heartful Hug) — a method of comfort taught to Shankar by his mother — and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Shankar constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead child called "Sriram" (Vaishnav Tej) as if the kid were able to perceive and understand normally; interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated janitor; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery.  Dr. Ramalingeswara Rao, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and he begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behavior is explained early on as an attempt to practice laughter therapy, an attempt that seems to have backfired — Ramalingeswara Rao's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, his daughter becomes increasingly fond of Shankar, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Shankar is unaware that Dr. Sunitha and his childhood friend "Chitti" are one and the same; an ignorance that Sunitha hilariously exploits. Ramalingeswara Rao tries several times to expel Shankar but is often thwarted by Shankar's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Shankar, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods.  Eventually, Shankar is shamed into leaving the college: His guilt for not being able to help a dying friend gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Shankar's departure, Sriram miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point Sunitha gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticizes her father for having banished Shankar, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness, etc. from the college. Ramalingeswara Rao eventually realizes his folly. Shankar later marries Dr. Sunitha, learning for the first time that she is "Chitti". Finally his parents Reconcile and now, Shankar Prasad is Shankar Dada M.B.B.S..

Frankie sees Oscar being electrocuted by Sykes' two [[jellyfish]] enforcers Ernie and Bernie and charges at Oscar. However, Frankie is killed when an [[anchor]] falls on him. Lenny flees, overcome with grief and guilt. As there were no other witnesses and Oscar was seen near the body, everyone comes to believe that he killed Frankie, an opportunity that Oscar decides to exploit for fame.  Oscar returns to the city with a new title of "Sharkslayer". Sykes becomes his manager and Oscar moves to the "top of the reef" to live in luxury. At the same time, Don Lino has everyone search for Lenny. When several sharks approach Oscar's neighborhood, his neighbors expect him to drive them away so he goes and runs into Lenny. Since he does not wish to return home, Lenny begs Oscar to let him stay at Oscar's house. Soon, Angie finds out about the lie and threatens to tell everyone. Oscar and Lenny stage an event in which Lenny pretends to terrorize the town and Oscar defeats him. Though this further cements Oscar's reputation, it greatly angers Don Lino.  Oscar buys some Valentine's Day gifts for Angie, but before he can present them to her, he finds that Don Lino has kidnapped Angie to force a sit-down. Lenny attends disguised as a [[dolphin]] named Sebastian. Don Lino threatens to eat Angie if Oscar does not comply. Lenny grabs Angie into his mouth, but later regurgitates her. When Don Lino realizes that "Sebastian" is really Lenny, he chases Oscar through the reef. Oscar heads for the Whale Wash and ends up trapping both sharks. He is given an ovation by the other fish, but Oscar confesses that he is not a "Sharkslayer" and reveals the truth behind Frankie's death. He then tells Don Lino that everyone likes Lenny for who he is and urges him not to prejudge people before he knows them properly. Realizing that Oscar is right, Don Lino makes peace with him and Lenny, stating that he and his gang bear him no ill will. Oscar forsakes all the wealth he has acquired, makes peace with the sharks, becomes co-manager of the Whale Wash (now frequented by sharks, killer whales, and swordfish), and starts dating Angie.

  Shaun is an electronics salesman with no direction in his life. His colleagues disrespect him, he is estranged from his stepfather Philip, and his girlfriend Liz breaks up with him, unhappy spending every date at his local pub, the Winchester. He drowns his sorrows with his housemate and best friend Ed at the Winchester. At home, their housemate Pete, complaining of a bite wound from a drunk, berates Shaun to get his life together.  By morning, a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie apocalypse]] has overwhelmed London, but the hungover Shaun is slow to notice. He and Ed encounter two zombies in their garden and kill them with blows to the head. They form a plan to rescue Shaun's mother, Barbara, and Liz, then wait out the crisis in the Winchester. They escape in Pete's car, and pick up Barbara and Philip, who has been bitten, then Liz and her friends Dianne and David. Philip makes peace with Shaun, dies from his bites, and reanimates as a zombie.  The group abandon the vehicle and continue on foot. The streets surrounding the Winchester are overrun, so the group go through a line of gardens where Barbara is bitten by a zombie in a dressing gown without revealing it to the rest of the group. Shaun sees the zombie and impales it on a swing ball pole, which he then punctures a tree with to disable the zombie. They then encounter another group of survivors, but they have different destinations and continue on their own paths. Shaun and the others reach the high street; however there is a large horde of zombies. To get past, the group pretend to be zombies in order to sneak past them. Ed answers his phone, attracting the zombies' attention; while Shaun leads them away, David smashes the window to get in. They seek refuge inside the Winchester and barricade the broken window, where Shaun rejoins them; they then stay in the pub.  In the middle of the night Shaun discovers that the [[Winchester rifle]] above the bar is functional and the group attempts to use it to defend themselves. Barbara reveals she has been bitten and dies after giving Liz and Shaun her blessing. Shaun, distraught, is forced to shoot her after she reanimates. While David is resetting the fuse box in the back room he sees a horde trying to break in via the back door and the zombified landlord escapes from his flat above and attacks the group. They kill him but accidentally activate the jukebox and many zombies break into the pub. In the ensuing commotion, David is disemboweled by the zombies and Dianne rushes out to avenge him - disappearing into the advancing horde. A zombified Pete breaks in and bites Ed, but Shaun shoots Pete and sets fire to the bar. The fire spreads, setting off the rifle ammunition while Shaun, Liz and Ed flee into the cellar and contemplate suicide. Discovering a barrel hatch elevator that opens to the outside, Shaun and Liz escape as the wounded Ed volunteers to stay behind with the rifle. Shaun and Liz escape the pub and defend themselves from the few remaining zombies out there, however Shaun's friend Yvonne (whom he ran into earlier) and the British Army arrive and gun down the remaining zombies. Yvonne reveals to Shaun that while she was fighting the zombies, the ones outside were gunned down and she was rescued and joined them in taking down the attacking zombies. They are then taken to safety.  Six months after the outbreak, civilization has returned to normal, although no explanation for the outbreak has been discovered by the government. Zombies are now used as cheap labor and entertainment. Liz has moved in with Shaun, while Shaun hides the zombified Ed in his shed tethered to a pole where they play video games together.

She believes that she has to behave in a particular fashion in order to fit in with her more sexually-active peers.  As Hannah becomes more sexually "advanced", she does not reveal her sexual encounters and activities with Nick to her mother, who is quite concerned about the subject.

Meanwhile, Becca is outraged when her religious parents (who do not know about her sexual history) decide to send her to boarding school, and Hannah is alienated at school because of her mother. She leaves her house one night and goes to her friend Tommy's house. They both realize they like each other and make out. Hannah wants to have sex, but Tommy refuses, explaining that he likes her but wishes to wait, as they are too young. Hannah becomes even more emotionally distraught, thinking he is not interested because she has been called a 'slut' and runs off.

At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and Harold's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.  Harold is reprimanded by the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming, her son, by reminding Harold that Charming was to marry Fiona in exchange for his own happy ending, and requests that he finds a way of getting rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which actually is a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, Puss in Boots. However, unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fiona's love for him.  Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep through the rain, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome human, while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order "to make the change permanent", Shrek must kiss Fiona "by midnight". Shrek, Donkey and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well.

At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, thinking that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.  To ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey and Puss, who are however arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon. While the royal ball begins, several of Shrek's friends band together to free the trio. The gang meets with the Muffin Man in order to create a monster-sized [[gingerbread man]], which breaks through the castle's defenses so Shrek can prevent Charming from kissing Fiona. He arrives too late, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a [[headbutt]]. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek. In the ensuing melee, Harold sacrifices himself to save Shrek: his armor ricochets the Fairy Godmother's spell which disintegrates her into bubbles, but turns himself back into the [[The Frog Prince|Frog Prince]]. Harold gives his blessing to the marriage and apologizes for his earlier behavior, and admits to using the Happily Ever After potion years before in order to marry Lillian, but she tells him that she loves him regardless of his appearance.  As the clock strikes midnight, Shrek and Fiona happily let the potion's effects wear off and revert to their ogre forms, while Donkey changes back to his natural form as well, and the party resumes.

Jane discovers that the girl was Natre (Achita Sikamana), a shy young woman who had attended the same college as Tun. After confronting Tun, Tun admits that he and Natre were in a relationship, which Tun had kept secret from his friends. Natre loved Tun dearly and threatened to commit suicide when Tun abruptly broke off the relationship. Tun witnesses his friend, Tonn, committing suicide, and discovers that his two other close friends from college have also committed suicide. Believing that they have been coerced into doing so by Natre's ghost, Tun becomes convinced that he will be next.  The haunting of Tun by Natre's ghost escalates, so he and Jane visit Natre's mother. At her house, they discover the decaying body of Natre in her bedroom. They learn that Natre had committed suicide, but her mother could not bear to have her cremated. Natre's funeral is held the following day, after which Jane hopes that everything will return to normal. Tun and Jane spend the night in a hotel, where Tun wakes up and is confronted by Natre's ghost. Tun tries to escape but is pursued; ultimately, while trying to get away, he falls off a fire escape and is injured.  However, on returning to [[Bangkok]], Jane collects some photographs. One of the films shows a series of images of Natre crawling towards the bookcase in Tun's apartment. Jane finds a set of negatives hidden behind the bookcase. She develops the negatives to find photographs in which Tun's friends—the ones who committed suicide—are sexually assaulting Natre. Utterly disgusted by her findings and now convinced that Natre tried to warn her, a teary Jane confronts Tun. Tun admits that he witnessed the rape but did nothing to stop his friends, and that he was the one who had taken those photos. He says he did it out of peer pressure and has never forgiven himself, but Jane leaves him.  Knowing that he is still haunted by Natre, Tun throws the camera across the room in a rage, only for it to go off, taking a photograph of Tun, revealing Natre sitting on Tun's shoulders. In the ensuing confrontation, Natre covers Tun's eyes making him unable to see, making him lose balance and fall out of the window.  The final scene shows a badly bandaged Tun slumping over in a hospital bed while Jane visits him. As the door swings closed behind Jane, the glass reflection shows Natre still sitting on his shoulders.  
Shwaas
 A villager (Vichare) brings his 8-year-old grandson Parshuraam (also known as Parshya) to a doctor in Pune to diagnose the child's eyes. They are accompanied by Parshya's maternal uncle Diwakar. On the first day Vichare is asked to sign the usual papers before admission in hospital. Upon asking, he learns that the papers say the doctor would not be responsible if anything goes wrong. Vichare, the rustic grandfather finds these terms unacceptable. A medical social worker, Aasawari, quickly comes in and explains the practice to Vichare. She calms him down and accompanies them during the first appointment with the doctor. Dr. Sane quickly diagnoses child as a victim of [[retinoblastoma]] — a rare retinal cancer. After consulting with other colleagues in US and UK doctor finds that only way to save child's life is to perform an operation that will leave the child blind. As per rule, doctor explains this and insists child be informed of this before surgery. He cannot be operated without this knowledge as it was against ethics. Aasawari (Amruta Subhash) who helps the doctor in convincing the grandfather and the grandson, tries to keep track of Vichare and persuades him not fall prey to other doctors promising false medicines. She tries to befriend Parshya to explain him what is going to happen. However, she finds it is too difficult to explain to him that he will turn blind.  The film then depicts the grandfather's struggle to accept the reality that the only way to save his grandson is at the cost of his eyesight. He tries to come to terms with the situation and his personal agony is shown in scenes, like taking second opinion, explaining his grandson the reality and his desire to show him everything possible before his grandson loses his eyesight. For some reason, the surgery has to be postponed by a day. That afternoon, grandfather and grandson disappear from the hospital ward and a frantic search follows. Confronted by an angry surgeon on their return, the grandfather states quite simply that he wanted to show Parshya the sights of the city for one last time.  ''Shwaas'' has been applauded for scenes which depict the difficulty faced by the doctors to explain to grandfather and Parshya that nothing can be done and the truth is but inevitable. It shows the medical fraternity in a very positive light, with the doctors and nurses being extremely supportive and doing the best they can, and helping the village with the best facilities. The last shot where Parshya returns home wearing dark glasses, waving to his family and friends from the boat was widely appreciated by film critics.<ref name="moview review"></ref>

Six Shooter (film)
 After a doctor informs Donnelly (Gleeson) that his wife died at 3 o'clock in the morning, he brings Donnelly to his wife's bedside to say goodbye, then excusing himself as the doctor is unusually busy: there'd been two [[Sudden infant death syndrome|cot deaths]], and a woman shot so brutally by her son 'she had no head left on her'. Donnelly spends a few final moments awkwardly talking to his wife and gives her a photo of 'David', their pet rabbit.    While on a train ride home, Donnelly sits opposite a chain-smoking kid (Conroy), who reveals himself to be a manic foul-mouth.  In his forlorn state, Donnelly tolerates the kid, allowing himself to be engaged in some inane conversations. Less accepting of the kid's abrasive manners are a couple sitting across the aisle. After some animated exchanges, the kid leaves to get something from the buffet cart.  At this time, Donnelly inquires, and learns that the couple just lost their son from a cot death.  The kid returns after the couple leaves their seats, where Donnelly tells the kid about the baby's death.  The kid seems surprised and immediately asks, 'Did they kill "it"?'.  When Donnelly explains that it was 'cot death', the kid asserts that they must have 'banged it on something'. Upon the couple's return, things heat up. The two almost come to blows, but Donnelly steps in.  Donnelly goes to the buffet cart to get a drink. The man comes out to get tea and engages Donnelly in a brief conversation. With her husband gone, the woman is now left alone with the kid, who quickly moves to harass her as she clutches a picture of her deceased baby. He accuses her of 'bang[ing] it on something', because the baby was 'ugly'.  Aghast, the woman steps on a table to get away from him, only to trip, fall, and tear the photo.  Moments later, the kid, now back in his own seat, is startled by a thump at the window; the woman had thrown herself out of the train. He goes to investigate, to discover an open gate with the torn picture of the baby on the floor.  Donnelly and the husband return. The kid nonchalantly informs the husband that his wife has jumped off the train, and is 'dripping down the half of it'. The husband takes this as a joke, and sets out to look for his wife. When Donnelly turns to see the blood on the window, he pulls the emergency stop.  The police arrive and the man learns of his wife's suicide. Donnelly and the kid are questioned by a policeman, who questions the kid: 'Do I know you from somewhere?'. As the train departs, the policeman sees the kid wildly waving goodbye, and realizes he is 'wanted'. He orders the train stopped, 'and tell the boys to get the guns out'.  On their way again, the kid tries to get Donnelly to take his side. When he gets no sympathy, the kid reveals that HIS mother was murdered last night, but he's not mourning. Donnelly tells the kid that his wife just died as well, and begins to weep. The kid again presses Donnelly with his 'deadly' story of a cow with trapped wind. Donnelly capitulates, and the kid tells his 'true' story, which is so bizarre that Donnelly can't help but laugh. 'Best day of me fucking life – that cow exploding', the kid concludes.  As the train pulls into the station, Donnelly notices armed cops everywhere. He realises that the kid is responsible for the murder to which the doctor alluded in the beginning. A shootout between the kid and the cops ensues, which leaves the kid mortally wounded. His last words are regrets that he didn't even hit one policeman. The kid dies as Donnelly cradles him. He then takes one of the kid's six shooters and hides it in his coat.  At home, Donnelly prepares to kill himself. He looks in the gun which contains two bullets. As he is about to shoot himself, he hears scratching sounds from David, his wife's pet rabbit.  He takes David in his lap, and tells the rabbit: 'I'll be following you shortly', before shooting it in the head. Moving the gun to his own head, Donnelly fumbles and drops it, accidentally discharging its last bullet. He looks at the smoking six shooter, then at the dead rabbit in his arms. He sighs, looks skyward and moans, 'Oh Jesus; what a fuckin day.'

Silver Hawk
  Silver Hawk riding her motorcycle through China. She is chasing thugs who have stolen pandas and are getting away in a truck. She attaches her bike to the truck, jumps on top of and fights the men in the truck until they give up. She heads back to Polaris City (located where [[Hong Kong]] is in our world) where she meets an old childhood friend, Rich Man. Then a flashback occurs, going back to the martial arts training academy.   He is the new head of the police department. He recognizes Lulu, Silver Hawks's name in real life, from magazine covers. He tells her of his mission to arrest Silver Hawk. When they arrive at the airport, he asks for her phone number, but she asks for his phone instead. She implants a tracking chip so she can overhear his conversations and agrees to a date if he can recall who she is.  At home, she is telling her assistant Mimi about her trip when her adoptive aunt arrives with Professor Ho Chung for a blind date. Prof. Ho starts to tell her of his new project when she gets word of a bank robbery. She suggests going to the movies and leaves. The pattern of fighting crooks and disappearing before the police arrive repeats until she arrives at a mugging. This is really a sting for Rich Man to arrest her, but she fends him off and handcuffs him to a pole. As she leaves, he yells that she's leaving without a goodbye. This triggers a flashback to when she left the academy with a monk who would train her further in kung fu, leaving him heartbroken.  Back at home, she finds the professor's assistant waiting in his place. The assistant, Kit, escorts her to the professor's demonstration of his project: an [[artificial intelligence|A.I.]] chip that would tap into several databases with information about the user to suggest ways for the user to improve his or her way of life. Lulu doesn't like it because it might infringe on free will. Later, Kit reveals he is a Silver Hawk fan and Man, who is there to provide security, recognizes his "little sister." Then the professor is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, with the police and Silver Hawk soon giving chase. At one point, the escape truck is blocked and the two kidnappers get out to slow the pursuit until the truck can move. Silver Hawk battles the two while a camera on his head sends images of her to his boss. The chase ends at an outdoor wedding where she chooses to save the bride instead of following the crooks.  While Man investigates Shiraishi Inc., who expressed interest in Ho's chip, Ho is brought before Alexander Wolfe, who wants his chip to take over the minds of the phone's users. He coerces Prof. Ho into helping him.  Man's investigation takes him to Zenda City (a.k.a. Tokyo), where Shiraishi is headquartered. His friend on the local force, Lt. Lisa Hayashi, takes him to the CEO, who is already seeing his niece, Lulu Wong. Later, the CEO's daughter Tina is kidnapped by Morris and Jane, and Lulu intervenes. The camera on Morris' head transmits images of Lulu to his boss (Wolfe), who deduces who Silver Hawk is.  The crooks escape, and Man brings her to the local police station and asks her about her kung fu skills, which she had earlier denied maintaining.  Outside the station, they see the CEO driving away and follow him, knowing that he'd refused to cooperate with police. They tail him to a meeting with Wolfe, who whisks him away in a helicopter before the two can intervene. All Lulu can do is take a picture of Wolfe and later send it to Kit, knowing that he's a fan.  Wolfe wants the CEO to put Ho's chip in a new phone and distribute them in exchange for his daughter. Later, he forces Prof. Ho to speed up his preparation of the [[Subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] messages that phones will transmit, despite possible long-term damage to the user's mind. Ho manages to slip a secret message into the phone's computer code.  Days later, Shiraishi is promoting its new phone, and the CEO is more focused on that than on seeing Lulu about his daughter. Lulu goes to her apartment and finds flowers and a message from Wolfe to meet him about Tina.  As she's about to leave, she finds Man, who has begun to guess who Silver Hawk is, waiting outside to talk to her. She tells him to wait in the hotel bar, but he leaves some tracking chips on top of the door.  when she leaves, the chips fall onto her hair, and he tracks her to her meeting. Inside the building, she meets Wolfe, who then sends four men attached to [[bungee cords]] to attack Silver Hawk and leap away before she can respond. She manages to fend them off until Wolfe injures her shoulder with his prosthetic arms.  She then uses one bungee cord to leap up to a window and escape. Man tracks her to where she'd passed out from the pain and takes her to his apartment to confront her about her vigilante actions. This is interrupted when Kit walks in and start to blab about the e-mail he'd sent her about Wolfe. Man drags him away to get the information about Wolfe.  That interrogation is interrupted by a newsflash about the CEO's support of Wolfe to run for premier. Kit sees how unnatural the CEO's face is; Man sees he's wearing a new phone. The two investigate the connection.  As Lulu bathes to heal her shoulder, she recalls a lesson her teacher gave her about the nature of water and kung fu. This gives her an idea on how to deal with Wolfe.  The next day, Kit has discovered the secret message Prof. Ho put in the code. Wolfe plans to activate the mind control in a few hours, but they don't know where to look for him until Silver Hawk sends them the address. There, the police battle Wolfe's thugs until Silver Hawk arrives to help put them away. Kit finds a way to Wolfe's lair and then tend to Prof. Ho while Silver Hawk and Man battle Wolfe and his men.  She uses cloths attached to her flying blades to subdue his prosthetics, and she and Man finally defeat him.  But they must use Wolfe's [[retinal scan]] to stop the process, so Kit tricks him into opening his eyes. This foils his plan but also activates the self-destruct system.  Silver Hawk and the rest escape, but Wolfe is crushed to death.  Back in Polaris City, Lulu has a date with Man. He's called away on official business, leaving the question of whether he'd arrest Lulu unanswered. Silver Hawk later drives up next to Man, and the two tease each other about their signature moves.

The next day, the team encounters Cottonmouth Joe. The heavy weapons specialist charges him but is killed and the team opens fire to no effect. A support helicopter of Citizen's Militia is also destroyed. One man goes to recover the heavy weapons specialist's body but finds it missing.

Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow
 In a technologically-advanced 1939, the [[zeppelin]] ''Hindenburg III'' moors itself atop the [[Empire State Building]]. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished.  Polly Perkins, a reporter for ''The Chronicle'', is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to [[Radio City Music Hall]], against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]].'' He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, seemingly indestructible robots attack the city. Clearly outmatched, the authorities call for "Sky Captain" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero and Perkins' ex-lover and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion.  While Joe engages the robots with his modified [[Curtiss P-40]] pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her personal safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and convinces Joe to reluctantly let her in on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of [[ornithopter]] drones. Dex tracks the origin of the signal controlling the drones and notes it on a map before his capture.  Joe and Polly find Dex's map and fly to [[Nepal]] and then [[Tibet]], where they discover an abandoned mining outpost and meet up with Joe's old friend Kaji. Two guides working for Totenkopf force Polly to turn over the vials, locking the duo in a room full of dynamite. Joe and Polly manage to escape just before the room explodes, knocking them unconscious and destroying most of Polly's film. They wake up together in the mythical [[Shangri-La]]. The Tibetan-speaking monks there tell of Totenkopf's enslavement of their people, forcing them to work in the uranium mines. Most were killed by the radiation, but the final survivor provides a clue to where Dr. Totenkopf is hiding. With insufficient fuel to make it there, they run into a [[Royal Navy]] [[Airborne aircraft carrier|flying aircraft carrier]] commanded by another of Joe's ex-flames, Commander Franky Cook.   Franky leads the attack on Totenkopf's island lair while Joe and Polly enter through an underwater inlet. Joe and Polly find themselves on an island with dinosaur-like creatures, which Polly hesitates to photograph as she has only two shots left. They find a secret subterranean facility in a mountain, where robots are loading animals, as well as the mysterious vials, onto a large "[[Noah's Ark]]" rocket. Joe and Polly are detected but Dex, piloting a flying barge, arrives with three of the missing scientists. One of the missing scientists explains that Totenkopf has given up on humanity and seeks to start the world over again: the "World of Tomorrow". The vials are genetic material for a new [[Adam and Eve]]. Sky Captain says they should just let Totenkopf go but Dex states that they can't; if the rocket reaches space, the afterburners will ignite the atmosphere and kill everyone on Earth.   As the group attempts to enter Dr. Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is electrocuted by the defense system. A hologram of Totenkopf appears, speaking about his hate for humanity and his plans to rebuild it as a new master race. Dex disables the defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf's mummified corpse inside with a scrap of paper clutched in his hand: "forgive me". He had died 20 years prior, but his machines continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to tag along, but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and saving him from Dr. Jennings' assassin, a female robot. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same assassin robot. He jolts the robot with its electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. Joe and Polly use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket safely explodes.  Joe and Polly watch the animal pods splash down around their escape pod, while Commander Cook leads a group of flying aircraft carriers towards them. Polly then uses the last shot on her camera to take a picture of Joe rather than the animal pods. Joe grins and says: "Polly&mdash;lens cap."

Sons of Provo
  Will and Danny Jensen are brothers, and the film begins with an interview with their parents.  They talk about Will and Danny's youth-pageant championships and their singing abilities.  Will and Danny's parents can't sing, as their poor attempt shows.  Will Jensen (Will Swensen) is an [[Aerobic exercise|aerobics]] instructor and is popular with women (the blonde he is constantly seen with is a different girl on camera each time. He sees the band as his.  Kirby later says that Will is near controlling, but not quite.  Danny Jensen (Danny Tarasevich) is an [[ice hockey]] player and has a life philosophy that is a fusion of [[Buddhism]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormonism]].  His introductory interviews are done in front of posters of [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] & [[Marie Osmond|Marie]].  Whenever he has a moral dilemma, he thinks, "What Would Donny & Marie Do?" (WWD&MD).  Will and Danny Jensen are the remaining members of an LDS boy-band from [[Provo, Utah]] that recently lost its third member because of "artistic reasons." Will and Danny begin the search for a new third member of their band that does not yet have a name.  They begin by posting flyers and holding auditions in their own house.  After that fails, they start searching local plays and baseball games (for singers of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]).  They eventually decide on the star of a production of ''[[Forever Plaid]]'' at a local community theatre.  He turns them down without reservation.  They then do an impromptu try-out of one of the costars, Kirby Laybourne (Kirby Heyborne), and recruit him for the group.  Kirby is a [[scrapbooking]] specialist who works at Daisy Cutter Scrapbooking Company.  His [[Choose the right|CTR ring]] is his most important possession.  The group needs a manager, so Will and Danny hire their nephew (who is older), Grayson Jensen (Peter Brown), for the job.  The first gig he books for them is as the targets of a pie-throwing booth at a local fair.  They sing while pies are being thrown at them.  They are not pleased with their manager.  Their second gig is at a local wedding reception in a church gymnasium.  The gymnasium is partitioned off so that half is for the wedding reception.  When they begin to perform, one of the microphone stands collapses.  A boy scout troop begins to shoot hoops in the other end of the gymnasium.  Kirby turns up the music to overpower the sounds of the basketball playing and causes feedback.  The bride and groom then begin to argue and the bride walks out.  Then the group ends their performance and argues vociferously with their manager during which the manager uses the words "fetchers", "flippin'", "heck" and "butt".  Will tells him, "Watch your language!"  In the next scene, Will says, "I, for one, am fine with the fact that we had to let Grayson go.  There is a certain level of conduct that is expected from a boy-band's manager.  I know that [[Justin Timberlake]]'s manager doesn't throw out language like that."  At the next official group meeting, the first order of business is to find a new manager.  The band ends up hiring an old girlfriend of Kirby's who works at [[Provo Theatre Company]], Jill Keith (Jennifer Erekson).  Meanwhile, Will has set up their next gig to perform at a local [[Fireside (Mormonism)|fireside]].  Will [[splurge]]s and purchases headmikes that are "the same model as [[Jessica Simpson]] used at her last two mall appearances."  One of the men who hears them there has a recording studio in his house and offers to record their music so he asks, "What's your band's name?"  They hold a brainstorming session in a park and come up with the name "Everkleen" (eventually shifting to the spelling, "Everclean.")  They decide that they need to hire a professional [[choreography|choreographer]], a local [[ballet]] instructor, Yvonne Bolschweiler (Maureen Eastwood).  She insists on them working hard without backtalking.  After recording their first album, they begin to get some paying gigs.  It doesn't take long until they have a tour starting in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] and including [[Logan, Utah]]; [[Salem, Utah]]; and [[Moscow, Idaho]].  During their tour, the reservations that they had made for the [[Days Inn]] in [[St. George, Utah]] had been lost and, "There's no room in the inn." They camp out that night on the Red Hill in Utah, with a short campfire song named "I Am Called Buttercup." This is the first concert where they let Kirby sing lead vocal, in the song "Spiritchal as Me".  Some time after this performance, they read a review in the newspaper which pans their performance.  It was written with such [[highbrow]] words that they think that it is a good review.  At a performance at [[Utah State University]], Kirby loses his CTR ring down a drain just before a performance.  In one of the earlier interviews, he conveys how important it is to him.  He can be seen clearly performing below par.  During the performance, the band manager gets someone to take the drain apart and retrieve the ring, which she returns to Kirby during the performance.  One of the songs that they perform in their concerts is titled "Dang, Fetch, Oh my Heck"  It starts out with the lyrics, "Dang! Fetch! Oh my Heck! What the holy scrud? / H-E double hockey sticks! That's frickin' flippin' crud!"  Their former band manager, Grayson, who is at the performance walks out calling them [[hypocrisy|hypocrites]], and saying some other near-profanities.  Their next performance is at the Jensen family reunion.  It will be the first time since the band has seen Grayson since he was fired.  When they encounter each other, they are cordial.  Everclean performs to some applause.  Then Grayson introduces the singing group that he has been managing for the past few months, [[moosebutter]] (an actual [[a cappella]] comedy group) who performs to wild applause.  The Everclean tour ends up at Centerville High School ([[Provo, Utah]]), where the Jensen brothers went to high school.  While practicing for the performance, Will doesn't appreciate that a high school junior is managing the technical aspects instead of a senior.  This escalates in to an argument between the band members from which they all walk away.  The band manager talks to Will and convinces him to listen to the tape that Kirby has made of the song that he wrote and wants to perform.  Will then apologizes to Danny.  They both call up Kirby who is listening as they leave a message on his [[answering machine]].  Will and Danny are practicing Kirby's song just before the performance not knowing if Kirby will show up.  He does show up, and Will admits that the group can't get along without Kirby.  The last scene is a performance of Kirby's song by Everclean, with Will and Danny [[Backup vocalist|singing backup]].  
Someone Special (film)
 Despite having dated a number of women, professional baseball player Dong Chi-sung has never had a first love. "I always think it's love, but sooner or later I find out it's not..." Sure enough, his latest girlfriend dumps him, and then on the same day, he goes to the doctor and finds out he has a malignant tumor, with only three months to live. It's September now, so he won't even live to see the new year. With his mind in a tailspin, he goes to a friend's bar to drink away his pain.  Not a heavy drinker by habit, Chi-sung passes out, and wakes up to find himself in a hotel room with the bartender, a rather quirky woman he's mostly ignored until now."How did I get here?" he asks her in confusion, and she tells him she folded him up and carried him in a box. Then she starts telling him about how he acts when he's drunk, before leaving him alone in the hotel room. What a strange woman...  The next day he goes to baseball practice, completely unable to concentrate. Formerly a successful pitcher in university, he was moved to the outfield after a shoulder injury, and then demoted to the minor leagues. On his way home, he hears an oddly familiar story being told on a radio program devoted to "confessional love stories." Someone calling herself "Writing Princess" is talking about carrying a man in a box to a hotel room, and talking to him there. What kind of woman is this, anyway?...  Han Yi-yeon works part-time in a bar and at a coffee shop, and listens to radio programs as a hobby. Ten years earlier, a young student in a baseball uniform moved into her neighborhood, and from that day on she has slowly fallen in love with him from afar. But she had never found the opportunity to talk to him, until the night when he came alone into the bar where she works. She is shocked to see him start crying, and then after just three drinks he passes out.  Without much choice she takes him to a nearby hotel and looks after him there. Seeing him sleep so peacefully, she just wants to stay together with him for as long as she can. But when he wakes up, all the words she wants to say get stuck in her throat, and all she can do is tell him that he's a well-behaved drunk. Frustrated and embarrassed, she leaves him there and goes back home. She decides to send a postcard—or five—to her favorite radio programs...  Although Chi-sung angrily confronts Yi-yeon about the "radio incident," it provides her with an opportunity. One radio station sends her a free mobile phone as a gift... Chi-sung has recently lost his, so she stops by his home to give it to him. Another radio station sends her free movie tickets, so she takes him along. While at the theater, Chi-sung runs into his old girlfriend and describes Yi-yeon as "just a woman I know." Is that all?! Is there any way that she can become "someone special" to him?...

Soul Plane
 Nashawn Wade ([[Kevin Hart (actor)|Kevin Hart]]) has a horrible experience with a typical [[airline]]: his dog '''Dre''' was classified as a [[checked baggage]] instead of a [[Hand luggage|carry-on]], he eats a horrible [[airline meal]], his buttocks gets stuck in the toilet during turbulence, and Nashawn's dog is sucked through a jet engine (after a stewardess accidentally opens the cargo door). In response, he sues the airline and is awarded $100,000,000 by the jury. He decides to use the money to start his own airline, called N.W.A. (Nashawn Wade Airlines), whose acronym and logo are a pop culture reference to rap group [[N.W.A]]. The airline specifically caters to African Americans and hip hop culture.  The [[Airport terminal|terminal]] at the airport is called the [[Malcolm X]] terminal, the plane is a heavily modified [[Boeing 747SP]], customized with low-rider [[hydraulics]], [[Spinner (wheel)|spinners]], [[Wingtip device|blended winglets]] to compensate for the drag from the decorations, and a dance club. The [[Pre-flight safety demonstration|safety video]] is also a spoof of the [[Destiny's Child]] song "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]".  After taking off from [[Los Angeles International Airport]], Nashawn must  deal with a multitude of problems, starting with his [[Acrophobia|acrophobic]] captain, Captain Mack ([[Snoop Dogg]]). At a cruising altitude of Flight Level 330, it is revealed that he has never left the ground because he learned to fly on computer simulators in prison. Meanwhile, his cousin Muggsey ([[Method Man]]), sets up a miniature casino and strip joint in one of the areas of the plane (as seen in the workprint and unrated versions of the film), and Nashawn's ex-girlfriend is on board and less than happy to see him. Meanwhile, the Hunkee family, the only caucasian passengers on board, must also deal with their own problems; Elvis Hunkee's ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) daughter is turning eighteen and plans to use her newfound freedom by drinking and having sex, his son has transformed from an exact duplicate of him to a stereotypical [[wigger]], and his wife has found a new interest in black men after viewing pictures in a pornographic magazine.  The pilot seemingly dies after eating mushrooms that the co-pilot, First Officer Gaemon ([[Godfrey (comedian)|Godfrey]]), uses to soothe his [[Crab louse|genital crabs]]. Nashawn attempts to contact Gaemon, who is incapacitated after slipping near a hot tub, forcing Nashawn to attempt to land the plane himself. Nashawn lands the plane safely, using the airplane stewardess' ([[Sofía Vergara]]) flight knowledge which she learned while having sex in the cockpit with the pilot on another plane. The plane lands in the middle of [[Central Park]] instead of [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], and the spinners are stolen from the plane. Nashawn reconciles with his ex-girlfriend after earlier revealing to her that he only broke up with her so she would not give up her college opportunities for him.  The movie ends with Nashawn telling the audience the fate of his crew. He claims that he and his ex-girlfriend are back together taking their relationship slow this time around, his cousin Muggsey has started a strip club and gambling casino located in another airplane similar to the club in Nashawn's plane, Elvis Hunkee has begun a sexual relationship with one of the abrasive airline security guards ([[Mo'Nique]]), and Elvis Hunkee's son has become a major music video director but has disappeared shortly after filming a [[Michael Jackson]] video. The pilot later wakes up with both his chain and clothing stolen.  
Spanglish (film)
 Cristina Moreno ([[Shelbie Bruce]]) is applying to [[Princeton University]]. For her application essay, she tells the story of a year from her childhood, and how it shaped the person she has become today (narrated by [[Aimee Garcia]]).  Flor Moreno ([[Paz Vega]]) is a poor [[Mexican people|Mexican]] single mother who moved to America seeking a better life for her and her daughter, Cristina. She takes on two jobs, but soon cannot maintain them, so Flor's cousin takes her to a job interview to work as a [[nanny]] for the Clasky family, consisting of John ([[Adam Sandler]]) and Deborah Clasky ([[Téa Leoni]]), their children Bernice ([[Sarah Steele]]) and Georgie (Ian Hayland), and Deborah's mother Evelyn Wright ([[Cloris Leachman]]). John is a successful [[chef]] and an easy-going man who enjoys cooking and spending time with his children, while Deborah is a former businesswoman turned stay-at-home mother, and Evelyn is slowly developing into an alcoholic. Deborah is uptight and her neurotic behavior often upsets the family - Deborah mentally abuses her daughter, body shaming Bernice by forcing her to exercise, buying her smaller-sized clothes and putting her down for certain behaviors; she frustrates John by expecting him to be submissive and accepting of her parenting style with Georgie. John is more laid back and supports the mental well-being of his children, but he feels that he cannot stand up to Deborah, and so usually decides to let her be.  Soon, Flor is needed to be a full time nanny at the Claskys' home for the summer. Unable to communicate well in English, Deborah finds a neighbor to translate, and Flor admits she is unable to maintain these hours because she has a daughter. Out of desperation to keep Flor as their nanny, Deborah invites Cristina to come stay with them, to act as interpreter for her mother. Deborah immediately becomes attached to Cristina since she is beautiful and thin, and begins to treat her more like a daughter than Bernice. The clothes and gifts which Deborah buys for Cristina do not go unnoticed by Flor, who does not approve. Needing to get materials for a project that he is working on, John gives the children a small task, in which they will receive money in exchange for various pieces of glass they collect from the beach. Cristina takes the task seriously and ends up receiving $640 for her collection. Flor finds out about this, and is overwhelmed and angry at the large sum of money given to her daughter. Flor and John argue, with Cristina as the interpreter, and Flor wants to leave because of the awkward family dynamic. John coaxes her into staying, much to Cristina's delight, and Flor begins to learn English so she can better communicate with the Claskys.  In the meantime, John opens a new restaurant, but falls into a temporary depression because of the stress of the business, while Deborah begins an affair. Deborah enrolls Cristina into a private school with Bernice, upsetting Flor, who wants Cristina to keep in touch with her Mexican roots and working-class values. Flor feels that her employer is overstepping her bounds and voices her objection to John, who tells her he is also frustrated with Deborah because Bernice has no support system from her own mother. Flor tries to encourage Bernice and build her self-confidence, by showing her small acts of kindness, especially after Deborah has been hard on her.  Summer ends and Cristina and Bernice attend their first day of school together. That afternoon, Cristina is allowed to bring her school friends back to the Claskys' house; however, Bernice is not. Flor, who had not given permission for this, is upset at the situation and Deborah tries to cover for Cristina. The now-sober Evelyn realizes that her daughter is having an affair and that her marriage is in trouble. She pleads with Deborah to end the affair, telling her she will never get another man as good as John. Deborah confesses to John that she cheated on him and begs him to stay so that they can work things out; however, a dejected John walks out and bumps into Flor, who was about to inform him that she is quitting. He offers to give Flor a ride to the bus stop, but the pair end up going to his restaurant, where he cooks for Flor. They have a genuine and deep conversation, and become closer, but Flor is afraid of the consequences of a relationship, since they both have children. Flor tells John that she has feelings for him, but leaves before he can kiss her. A desperate Deborah continuously tries to contact John, but Evelyn prevents her from doing so. Evelyn says that her own failings as a parent have caused Deborah to become the person that she is, and the two have a frank conversation during which they become closer as mother and daughter.  Flor decides to quit and take her daughter home, which angers Cristina, who got along well with the Claskys. As they are about to leave, John tells Flor that he envies whoever will get to have her in the future, before parting ways forever. On their way home, Flor tells Cristina that she cannot attend to the private school anymore, upsetting Cristina even more. She screams in the middle of the street, accusing Flor of ruining her life. Flor loses patience with Cristina after she asks her mother for 'space', similar to the Claskys avoiding each other and asking for space when they cannot solve a problem. Flor explains to her daughter that it is time she answers the most important question of her life: "Is what you want for yourself, to become someone very different than me?" Cristina considers this on their bus ride home, and they make up and embrace.  Cristina, in her university essay, acknowledges that her life rests firmly and happily on the simple fact that she is her mother's daughter.

She doesn't have any friends to hang out with, and appears awkward and uncomfortable when speaking to others.  Throughout the day, she is made fun of by several students, repeatedly called a "[[whistleblower|squealer]]". A series of flashbacks reveal that she called the police to a house party during the previous summer. Her actual reason for calling [[9-1-1]] was that she'd been raped by a senior student at the party, Andy Evans, but her trauma prevented her from reporting the rape over the telephone or when the police arrived.  When her parents see her report card, they prompt Melinda to see a teacher nicknamed Mr. Neck, who tells her to write an essay on any history topic. After refusing to read her paper aloud to her class, she is sent to the principal's office. Melinda is nice to a new student named Heather Billings, who claims to be Melinda's "friend", but Heather soon abandons Melinda when the chance for social advancement arises. The only other student with whom Melinda has a positive experience is her lab partner, Dave Petrakis, who has successfully managed to avoid affiliating himself with a clique.  The restoration of Melinda's confidence progresses at a painfully slow rate, with some help from Dave and her art teacher, Mr. Freeman. Her former best friend, Rachel Bruin, starts dating Andy, and Melinda fears that Rachel will suffer the same fate as her. Melinda meets Rachel at the library and tells her the truth about what happened at the party by writing it on paper. Rachel first refuses to believe, thinking that Melinda is lying out of jealousy, and calls her "sick", but comes to realize the truth by confronting Andy. Rachel then avoids Andy and tells other people of what happened at the party. Exposed as a rapist, Andy retaliates against Melinda, cornering her; he tries to force her to tell everybody at school that the incident is false and attempts to rape her again. Melinda struggles and irritates his eyes with [[turpentine]], overpowers him after holding a shard of broken mirror to his neck, threatening to kill him. They are found by Melinda and Rachel's friend Nicole, who, along with other girls from her lacrosse team, help Melinda and trap Andy to prevent further attack. The altercation removes any doubt about what happened at the house party, and the girls who restrain him are outraged by it and tempted to beat him with their sticks. Mr. Neck sees Melinda walking away from the scene and asks what was going on, but Melinda doesn't respond.  On the way back from the hospital after being treated for her injuries, Melinda rolls down the car window and breathes in deeply. She finally finds the strength to tell her mother, who already suspects something awful, the truth about what happened at the party. Although it becomes clear that Melinda will need time to fully recover from her ordeals, this is a significant and empowering event in her life, as she finally finds the courage to speak.  
Spider-Man 2
  [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] finds his personal and professional lives strained due to his secret life as the superhero Spider-Man; he is estranged from both his love interest [[Mary Jane "M.J." Watson]] and his best friend [[Harry Osborn]], and discovers his [[Aunt May]] is facing eviction. He also finds himself suffering temporary but recurring losses of his powers, often in life-threatening situations.  Harry, now head of [[Oscorp]]'s research division, sponsors a [[fusion power]] project by nuclear scientist Otto Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful [[robotic arm|robotic tentacle arms]] with [[artificial intelligence]]. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius stubbornly refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical — killing his wife, fusing the harness to his spine, and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter, as Spider-Man, shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process.  At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius' harness. However, without the inhibitor chip, the arms, having developed sentience, attack them. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbor. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, he robs a bank in order to fund a second experiment. Peter and May coincidentally are there, and Octavius takes May hostage. Peter rescues her as Spider-Man, but Octavius flees with stolen money. The ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' subsequently dubs the scientist [[Doctor Octopus]].  Later at the [[Hayden Planetarium]], Mary Jane rejects Peter for missing her play and becomes engaged to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], the son of the Bugle's publisher and Peter's boss, [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Meanwhile, Harry, in a drunken rage, lashes out at Peter, accusing him of loyalty towards Spider-Man. Because of this, Peter suffers an emotional breakdown over his inability to balance his life, resulting in him losing his powers. Abandoning his Spider-Man identity, he attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings Peter's Spider-Man costume to Jameson, who takes credit for driving Spider-Man into hiding. Peter tells May the truth behind his [[Uncle Ben]]'s death and how he is responsible. May forgives him, but the rise in [[New York City]]'s crime rate in Spider-Man's absence worries Peter.  Requiring the isotope [[tritium]] to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man's life. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but requests Octavius not harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and abducts Mary Jane to motivate him. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers resurfacing. Just as J. Jonah Jameson admits he was wrong about Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the ''Bugle'' and confronts Octavius.  During their battle, they fall onto a [[New York City subway]] train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Peter to save the passengers, which he does with great exertion. When he faints from exhaustion, the grateful passengers save him from falling and bring him into the train, seeing his unmasked face but promising to keep their knowledge secret. They unsuccessfully try to protect him when Octavius returns to capture and deliver him to Harry.  After giving Octavius the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair. Spider-Man arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane. Octavius discovers him and they fight once again as the nuclear reaction swells. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his Parker identity, and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius finally commands the tentacles to obey him, and gives his life to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Spider-Man's true identity and feelings, which he says is why they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.  Harry is visited by a vision of his father in a mirror, pleading for Harry to avenge his death. Refusing to hurt Peter, Harry shatters the mirror, unintentionally revealing a secret room containing prototypes of the [[Green Goblin]]'s equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment, determined to be with him despite the risks. After they kiss, they hear police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages him go help as Spider-Man.  
Spartan (film)
 Robert Scott is a former [[United States Marine Corps]] [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] [[Master gunnery sergeant|Master Gunnery Sergeant]], acting as a selection cadre member for [[Delta Force|1st SFOD-D]]. While observing an exercise designed to [[Delta Force#Recruitment|evaluate Delta candidates]], Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife-fighting instructor.  Scott is drawn into a [[Wetwork|clandestine operation]] to find Laura Newton, the [[President of the United States|President's]] daughter, who is missing. He and Curtis go first to the beach house of one of Laura's professors, with whom she is said to have a relationship.  They find neither person there but find two unidentified men who react aggressively, leading Curtis, who has taken up position outside with a sniper's rifle, to shoot the men.  Another lead takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman from the bar to a [[brothel|bordello]] that funnels some of these girls to an international [[sexual slavery|sex slavery]] ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone.  Calls placed to the pay phone are traced to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport for medical treatment and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation.  When the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner who was on [[death row]]. He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in [[Dubai]].  Scott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.  As the team prepares an assault in Dubai, a news broadcast reports that Laura and her college professor were discovered drowned while sailing off the coast of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. The rescue operation is called off. Scott returns home, convinced there is no more to be done, but Curtis tracks him down and insists that Laura is alive.  He shows Scott an earring that was caught in his sniper's mat from the beach house identical to the earrings Laura is wearing in a news photograph.  When they return to the beach house to investigate, Curtis is killed by a sniper positioned on a nearby boat. Scott evades the sniper and when he finds Laura's unique sign on a window in the beach house indicating she was there, he realizes that she may not be dead. He takes his pager and phone apart and finds a tracking device.  He tries to contact Laura's mother, who is visiting a rehab facility, but he is intercepted by a female [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent assigned to guard the First Family. When he shows the agent the earring, the agent, who knows Laura well, explains that for years the President has used visits to his daughter as a cover for extramarital affairs, and that he pulled Laura's Secret Service detail to use as extra protection for himself during the latest trip, leaving her vulnerable to the members of the sex trafficking ring.    Scott enlists Sergeant Black to help him rescue the girl from Dubai and turns to Avi, a former Israeli operative. Avi agrees to get him into Dubai and smuggle Laura out concealed in a cargo container at the airport, obtaining weapons for him and support from a local man known as Jones.  Jones is killed during the rescue and Scott flees with Laura to a [[safe house]], where he persuades her that although he is alone, he is acting under orders.  Correctly guessing that he is really acting on his own, Laura says that King Leonidas of Sparta would respond to requests for help from neighboring kingdoms by sending one man, and decides to trust him.  When he takes Laura to the airport to seal her in the cargo container, Scott discovers he is being tracked when he finds a transmitter hidden in his knife. He rushes her out of the container just as his old team arrives to apprehend them. Scott is shot and Laura is captured. Her captor reveals herself as Sgt. Black, who shows her the earring and photos from the Secret Service agent, convincing Laura to stop struggling. A Swedish news crew witnesses the struggle as they are about to board their own plane nearby, and recognize Laura. Black is shot, and a hysterical Laura is hustled to safety aboard the journalists' plane. Scott finds the injured Black, who asks if Laura is now safe, which Scott confirms.  Later, on a [[London]] city street, a stubbled Scott is shown watching an evening news broadcast regarding Laura's return on a television in a shop window. The government spins the story of Laura's kidnapping as an opportunity for the President to take action to end the trafficking of American girls as sex slaves.  A [[British people|British]] man watching alongside Scott says, "Time to go home," and walks away.  Scott watches him leave and says, "Lucky man."  Scott is then seen walking off into [[Piccadilly Circus]].  
Spider Forest
  Awaking alone in the middle of a dark forest, Kang Min sees a secluded cabin nearby and wanders towards it. Upon entering the small home, he is shocked to discover a brutal, bloody crime had taken place. A man, hacked repeatedly by a sickle, lies on the floor, dead. Min hears a noise nearby and discovers his girlfriend Su-Young, stabbed and nearly dead, stammering something about "spiders."  Before he could save his loved one, Min is caught off guard by the killer who unexpectedly emerges and dashes out of the cabin. Min grabs the sickle and pursues the dark figure through the shadowy woods of the Spider Forest, only to be temporarily knocked out with a blunt blow to the face. Min, being disoriented and slightly dazed,  sees the killer enter into a tunnel on a road nearby and stumbles after him. Yet upon entering the tunnel, a speeding SUV collides with Min and throws him to the ground, severely injured by the impact.  As he lies on the pavement with his blood streaming across the ground, the dark figure approaches Min and stands mere inches away, as if mocking his inability to capture him. Min extends his arm, desperately trying to grab him, but in vain and he soon loses consciousness...  Min wakes-up fourteen days later at a local hospital with his head heavily bandaged. His friend, a police detective named Choi, is at his bedside to both comfort and question him about the murders. Min discovers that he, in fact, is the prime suspect of the killings due to his fingerprints being on the sickle that he picked up and his relationship with the victims. Choi, wanting to believe in his friend's innocence, asks Min to tell him everything that had happened leading up to the brutal crime. Weaving in and out of consciousness, Min tries to reconstruct the bizarre events, but it proves to be a too difficult task. Min finds that there are some details he cannot remember, while other details he can't even be sure they actually happened. The boundary between dreams and reality become blurred as he tries to piece together his enigmatic past in an effort to complete a puzzle that will, hopefully, prove his innocence...

The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie
 A group of [[pirates]] find tickets to ''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie'' in a treasure chest and enter a theater to watch the film.  [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] is dreaming about managing the [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant and saving the day during a crisis. He wakes up and cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for the Krusty Krab 2, expecting his boss, [[Mr. Krabs]], to promote him to manager of the new restaurant. Instead Krabs names [[Squidward Tentacles]] as manager, believing SpongeBob is too immature to handle the role, much to SpongeBob's disappointment. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs' business rival, [[Plankton (character)|Plankton]], complains about his failures to Karen (his computer wife), being unable to steal the Krabby Patty Secret Formula, and so on; exhausting plans A-Y, Plankton at Karen’s correction finds Plan Z, which he begins to enact.  That night, SpongeBob goes to his favorite restaurant, Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat, where he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend, [[Patrick Star]]. Elsewhere, [[Plankton (character)|Plankton]] steals [[King Neptune (SpongeBob SquarePants)|King Neptune]]'s [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to Shell City, a distant, mysterious land from which no fish has returned. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob later arrives and chastises Krabs under the influence of an [[ice cream headache]], but seeing his boss's life is at risk, he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune is convinced by his sympathetic daughter Mindy to spare Mr. Krabs for the time being and freezes him instead, ordering SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Krabs' life. Princess Mindy gives SpongeBob a Bag of Winds so that they can return from Shell City once they find the crown. SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a car shaped like a [[Krabby Patty]].  After SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the [[Chum Bucket]], claiming that Krabs bequeathed the recipe to him before Neptune froze him. He also gives free ‘Chum Bucket Helmets’ with every Patty. However, the helmets are in fact mind control devices which Plankton activates to control Bikini Bottom's residents and take over the city, after Squidward's failed attempt to report him to King Neptune.  As their journey continues, SpongeBob and Patrick reach a dangerous, monster-filled trench. After coming to the conclusion that they cannot complete their journey due to just being ‘kids’, they tearfully give up but Mindy arrives and pretends to use her 'mermaid magic' to turn them into men. With their confidence boosted, they brave the trench but are confronted by Dennis, a hitman hired by Plankton to eliminate them. He prepares to crush them with his spiked boots, but he is in turn stepped on by a [[standard diving dress|hardhat diver]] they believe to be a [[Cyclops]]. The diver grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.  At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but are dried out by the Cyclops with a heat lamp. Luckily, their tears [[short-circuit]] the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the [[Fire sprinkler system|sprinkler]] system, reviving their bodies and the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the vengeful sea creatures attack and overwhelm the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach but Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it. Fortunately, [[David Hasselhoff]] appears and offers them a ride. He swims from the beach to Bikini Bottom carrying them on his back. Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a [[catamaran]] back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.  At the Krusty Krab 2, King Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just in time thanks to Hasselhoff launching them through the roof of the Krusty Krab 2. They confront Plankton, who drops a mind-control bucket on Neptune, enslaving him. Before Plankton can direct Neptune to kill them, SpongeBob bursts into song, singing "Goofy Goober Rock" (a parody of [[Twisted Sister]]'s "[[I Wanna Rock]]") and transforming into an [[electric guitar]]-wielding [[wizard (fantasy)|wizard]]. He uses his guitar as if it were a magic wand to destroy the mind-controlling helmets, freeing [[Neptune]], Squidward, Gary, Sandy, Mrs. Puff, and the rest of Bikini Bottom's residents from Plankton's rule. Plankton tries to escape the Krusty Krab, but is stepped on and crushed by other citizens. After that, Plankton is arrested, and Neptune thanks SpongeBob for his bravery, thaws Mr. Krabs, and apologizes for falsely accusing him. Mr. Krabs decides to make SpongeBob manager of the Krusty Krab 2 in gratitude, thus concluding the series.  
Stage Beauty
 [[Edward Kynaston|Ned Kynaston]] ([[Billy Crudup]]) is one of the leading actors of his day, particularly famous for his portrayal of female characters, predominately [[Desdemona]] in ''[[Othello]]''. His loyal dresser, Maria ([[Claire Danes]]), aspires to perform in the legitimate theatre but is forbidden because of a law enacted by the [[Puritan]]s prior to the restoration of the [[House of Stuart]]. Instead, she appears in productions at a local tavern under the pseudonym [[Margaret Hughes]]. Her activity aided by the novelty of a woman acting in public, which attracts the attention of Sir [[Charles Sedley]] ([[Richard Griffiths]]), who offers his patronage. Eventually she is presented to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] ([[Rupert Everett]]).  [[Nell Gwynn]] ([[Zoe Tapper]]), an aspiring actress and Charles II's mistress, comes upon Kynaston ranting rabidly about women on stage and literally seduces Charles II into banning men from playing female roles.<ref>In actuality it was not men who were banned but allowing women on stage. "Women as actresses" (PDF). Notes and Queries. The New York Times. 18 October 1885. Archived from the original on 27 April 2009. Retrieved 2009-03-14. "There seems no doubt that actresses did not perform on the stage till the Restoration, in the earliest years of which Pepys says for the first time he saw an actress upon the stage. Charles II must have brought the usage from the Continent, where women had long been employed instead of boys or youths in the representation of female characters."</ref> Kynaston, having gone through a long and strenuous training to play female roles finds himself without a guise by which to keep the attention of his lover, [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]] ([[Ben Chaplin]]), the [[Duke of Buckingham]], as the latter never had intentions to lead a homosexual life and Kynaston has lost the acceptance of London society which started to circulate rumors about their association. He is reduced to performing bawdy songs in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] in music halls, while Maria's career thrives, although her ability to emulate that of Kynaston falls short because, as she says, Kynaston never fights as a woman would do.  Called upon for a royal performance, Maria panics and her friends implore Kynaston for coaching during which she coaches him to develop his ability to regain a theatrical career in male roles. He agrees with the proviso that he replace the company head Thomas Betterton in the role of [[Othello (character)|the titular protagonist]]. Maria evolves as an acclaimed theatrical star.  
Springtime with Roo
 It is [[Easter]], and [[Roo]], [[Tigger]], [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Pooh]], [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]] and [[Eeyore]] head to [[Rabbit (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Rabbit]]'s house for an [[Egg hunt|Easter egg hunt]]. However, much to their surprise, Rabbit has organized a "[[Spring cleaning]] day" instead. He orders the gang to clean his house while he tidies up in his garden. Initially dejected, the gang, not wanting to let Rabbit down, proceed to carry out Rabbit's orders. While dusting, Pooh sneezes violently, cluttering the house. A large trunk falls out of Rabbit's closet, revealing Easter eggs and decorations. Assuming Rabbit had forgotten about Easter, the gang decide to surprise Rabbit by decorating the house. Furious at his friends for disobeying him, Rabbit throws them out.  Tigger returns to Rabbit's house and tries to persuade him, but Rabbit refuses and declares that the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] will never celebrate Easter again. Tigger and the narrator tell Rabbit that he used to love Easter, but Rabbit does not believe them, so Tigger takes him back through the book to last year's Easter celebration.  The gang prepare for Easter, painting [[Easter egg]]s and making decorations. Rabbit wants everything to be as organized and orderly as possible, treating Easter as a professional occasion rather than a fun holiday. The others grow tired of Rabbit's bossiness and, under Tigger's suggestion, sneak off with the Easter eggs. Rabbit goes after them and finds them having the Easter egg hunt without him, with the gang agreeing that Tigger is "the best Easter Bunny ever". Overhearing this, Rabbit sadly leaves.  Outside the book, Rabbit admits to Tigger that he did once look forward to being the Easter Bunny, but his exclusion the previous year made him feel unwanted. Tigger says that it was not his intention to leave him out, but Rabbit, still bitter, continues to refuse the Hundred Acre Wood Easter. Tigger returns to the present and delivers the bad news, while Rabbit makes his way back home. The narrator purposely stops on the wrong page, at Roo's house, where Roo says he wishes he could make things up to Rabbit. Rabbit remains unswayed and returns home. He puts away Piglet's pink Easter basket, Pooh's honey pot, Eeyore's bunny ears and Tigger's striped Easter egg in the trunk before going to sleep, much to the narrator's frustration.  The narrator wakes Rabbit up, startling him by speaking in a ghost-like voice, before transporting him forward in time to unwritten pages of the book or (the future of the Hundred Acre Wood). On one page, it is Spring Cleaning Day and everything is organized exactly as Rabbit wants. Initially delighted, he asks where everyone is, thinking that they're late, but the narrator says they all moved away. Refusing to believe this, Rabbit tries to find them but realizes that the narrator was right when he discovers that their homes are empty. This lead him to regret his terrible behavior towards his friends, but the narrator claims that he certainly "didn't treat them like friends", annoying him. He proves this by showing Rabbit the bad things he said to them and claims that he cared about nobody but himself. Denying this at first, he finally realizes how his actions affected his friends and tries to correct his mistakes. He runs back to his house intent on having Easter, but finds that their things have gone with them.  Rabbit then wakes up on Easter morning and finds himself back in the present and that he still has a chance to change the future when he sees the Easter supplies are back in the box. Overjoyed, he immediately begins to plan the grandest Easter the Hundred Acre Wood has ever had.  At the same time, Roo and the others (unaware that Rabbit has changed) come up with another idea in hopes of cheering Rabbit up and, while they are busy working, Rabbit, feeling as "giddy as a jackrabbit" (also pretending to be his mean usual self at first), brings out all of the Easter decorations (along with a bunny tail for Eeyore) and starts happily preparing a big surprise for his friends, which everyone is very happy to see. Roo gives Rabbit a surprise as well: his Easter Bunny hat, now fixed up (after being crushed by Rabbit earlier in the story).   The story ends with the annual Easter celebration proceeding as planned, and Roo popping out of the book for a bit saying, "BBFN, Bye-Bye For Now!"

Starsky & Hutch (film)
 In the 1970s, detectives David Starsky and Ken 'Hutch' Hutchinson work for the Bay City Police Department. Starsky ([[Ben Stiller]]) is a loud, macho acting cop who loves his [[Ford Gran Torino]], and recklessly pursues people for minor offenses, while Hutchinson ([[Owen Wilson]]), is a cool easy-going cop, who sometimes actually works alongside criminals, claiming to be undercover, to investigate their activity. The two cops are made partners, almost as punishment for their recent shenanigans. Meanwhile, Jewish-American drug kingpin, Reese Feldman ([[Vince Vaughn]]), and his partner-in-crime, Kevin Jutsum ([[Jason Bateman]]), are planning to bring in a shipment of drugs worth millions of dollars. They have developed a new type of cocaine which is untraceable in scent and taste. When Feldman finds out that one of his drug pushers failed a drug transport operation, he kills him and leaves the body in the ocean.  Starsky and Hutch are called to the scene where the body of the murdered pusher washes up a few days later. A clue from the dead man leads them to Feldman's house for questioning. Feldman denies any knowledge of the crime and states his regret for the man's death, but his wife mentions that the pusher had been dating a cheerleader. During questioning Hutch admires Feldman's boat, to which Feldman replies "It's a yacht." After meeting cheerleaders, Stacey ([[Carmen Electra]]) and Holly ([[Amy Smart]]), they learn from another cheerleader, Heather ([[Brande Roderick]]), that a jacket worn by the dead pusher was made by Big Earl ([[Will Ferrell]]). Their street-wise, underworld contact, Huggy Bear ([[Snoop Dogg]]) directs the two to a motorcycle bar operated by Big Earl. Starsky and Hutch go undercover to the bar dressed as the characters "Captain America" and "Billy" from the film ''[[Easy Rider]]''. Discovering Big Earl is in jail, they go to the prison to speak with Big Earl, who has connections with Feldman's drug business. Big Earl, who is implied to be gay and has an obsession with dragons, then makes the officers do embarrassing things to get what they want. He gives them a packet of what they think is cocaine. When it is taken to the lab for testing, Doby ([[Fred Williamson]]), their captain, angered and humiliated about their interview (which was caught on security camera) tells them it is 'artificial sweetener' and takes them off the floater assignment. The duo invite Stacy and Holly to Starsky's place where Starsky puts the 'sweetener' in his coffee while Hutch sings ''[[Don't Give Up on Us (song)|Don't Give Up on Us]]'' (the original of which was actually recorded by [[David Soul]], the original "Hutch"). Starsky, Hutch, Stacey, and Holly go to a disco where Starsky, while suffering the effects of the drug, challenges an arrogant dancer to a dance off, and goes crazy when he loses. Hutch takes him home and proceeds to have a threesome with Holly and Stacey.  Feldman continues to be the main suspect of the duo's investigation, after they are assaulted by an Asian dealer and his knife-throwing son, and the dealer mentions that his boss "had a yacht." Further investigation leads them to believe that Feldman stores drugs in his garage, and during his daughter's [[Bat Mitzvah]], they go undercover as mimes attempting to locate the drugs. After confronting Feldman, Starsky shoots the lock off the garage door, accidentally shooting and killing a pony inside. As a result, Captain Doby indefinitely suspends both of them. Starsky tries to cover for Hutch, but Doby reveals that Starsky had filed a complaint against Hutch weeks ago, right after they first became partners. Starsky tries to explain, but the partners argue, and it leads to a split in their friendship.  Meanwhile, Hutch's young neighbor, Willis (Jeffrey Lorenzo), whom Hutch watches on Wednesdays, is involved in a bomb blast in Hutch's house, and breaks his leg (the bomb was intended for Hutch). Starsky comes to visit Willis in the hospital where a "who's at fault" argument with Hutch, finally leads to reconciliation. They both decide to go after Feldman and put an end to his drug business. With help from Huggy Bear, who grudingly acts as a golf caddie for Reese, they learn that Feldman plans to sell the drugs at a charity ball by hiding them in Volkswagen Karmann Ghias to be given away to preplanned dope pushers.  The disguised duo manage to enter the party and hold up Feldman, pretending to be winners of a car. Upon shooting open the trunk of the car, a large amount of cocaine is found. Feldman takes Hutch hostage, and in Starsky's attempt to rescue him, he accidentally shoots Captain Doby in the shoulder. Hutch covers for Starsky telling Doby that Reese shot him. In the ensuing confusion, Feldman and his girlfriend Kitty ([[Juliette Lewis]]) escape outside with the money that was used to buy the drugs. Starsky and Hutch pursue them in a car chase over a golf course.  Feldman and Kitty then take off in his yacht hoping to escape the partners. Not far behind, Starsky and Hutch decide the only way to catch Feldman is to land Starsky's car onto Feldman's yacht, which Starsky is fearful to do. Starsky gets the car up to speed on a pier and then hits a ramp, but jumps way off course and misses the yacht. It slams into the sea and sinks as the partners safely escape. However all is not lost; Huggy, who was hiding in the yacht, knocks out Feldman, with the golf club that Reese had accused him of losing earlier. After knocking Reese out, Huggy steals a briefcase full of money that belonged to Reese along with his sun glasses.   In the last scene, at a party celebrating the capture of Feldman, Jutsum, and Kitty, Starsky is still upset about the loss of his car. Huggy surprises him by buying him another Gran Torino from the original Starsky and Hutch duo ([[David Soul]] and [[Paul Michael Glaser]]). The two happy cops roll out in their new car answering to the police radio.  
Steamboy
  In 1863, where an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate]] nineteenth century Europe has made tremendous strides in steam-powered technologies, scientist Lloyd Steam and his son Edward have succeeded, after a lengthy expedition, in discovering a pure mineral water. They believe the water can be harnessed as an ultimate power source for steam engines (the main industrial engine of the time). An experiment in [[Russian Alaska]] goes terribly wrong, with Edward being engulfed in freezing gases, but results in the creation of a strange [[sphere|spherical]] apparatus.  Three years later, back in [[England]], Edward's son, Ray Steam, is an avid young inventor who works at a textile mill in [[Manchester]] as a maintenance boy, often working on a personal steam-powered [[monowheel]] at home. While he usually lives alone with his mother, his friend Emma and her brother Thomas have recently been sent over to stay until their mother returns from a business trip.  Ray's life is suddenly disrupted by the arrival of a package from his grandfather Lloyd; the metallic ball seen earlier, along with its schematics and a letter instructing him to guard it. Then, Alfred and Jason, two members of a company called "The O'Hara Foundation" arrive and attempt to steal the sphere, but Lloyd appears just in time to distract them, allowing Ray to escape with the package.  With Emma's help, he manages to activate his monowheel as more agents, operating a large [[traction engine|steam automotive]], give chase, succeeding in thwarting it on a railway line by putting it in the way of an incoming [[locomotive|train]]. By coincidence, [[Robert Stephenson]], who was the intended recipient of the Steam Ball, was on his way to Manchester to meet with the elder Dr. Steam, and happens to be on the train. However, as the train approaches the station, a [[zeppelin]] carrying Alfred descends over their compartment and kidnaps Ray, taking the ball with them.  Arriving in [[London]] sometime prior to the 1866 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]], during a dining session Ray meets Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled granddaughter of the Foundation's head chairman; Archibald Simon, an administrator of the company; and finally his father Edward, who has been partially mechanized for his severe injuries from the Alaskan experiment. He promptly takes Ray (and an insistent Scarlett) on a tour of the "Steam Castle"; an elaborate facility run by an army of engineers, and entirely powered by the compressed gas in three "Steam Balls", one of which was the one sent to Ray. He is enamored both by the castle, and his father's vision of using it to enlighten mankind. Ray is then quickly recruited to help complete the castle, and begins developing a love/hate friendship with Scarlett, who has become attracted to him.  Ray later encounters Lloyd again, who has escaped from his cell in the castle and is attempting to sabotage it from within, knowing that Eddie's intentions for it were evil. The Foundation's true intentions for the exhibition is to sell weapons to Britain's enemies. Upon discovering an arsenal of war machines in its underbelly, Ray struggles with the moral dichotomy of being a scientist - of how to contribute to the world without giving into vanity, conveying his conflict towards his father, and the one brewing between Eddie and Lloyd.  The two eventually reach the core section of the castle, and manage to pry away one of the Steam Balls before security surrounds them. Lloyd is shot by Alfred and recaptured, while Ray makes another elaborate escape with the ball. The next morning, the exhibition is underway, and Ray has reunited with Robert Stephenson, giving him the ball and the knowledge he acquired in captivity. An assault on the castle is then met with a demonstration by the Foundation of its new steam-powered weapons, which turn the exhibition into a war zone. Ray becomes aware of his folly when Stephenson uses the ball to enhance his own company's battle [[tank]]s (which resemble the real-life [[Richard Hornsby & Sons|Hornsby Chain Tractor]] of 1905), leading him to realize that he had no better intentions than the Foundation's.  Eddie, eager to show the world the castle, enters the observation/control room and orders the engineers to "launch" it, causing the structure to rise and shed its decorative outer shell, revealing a monstrous floating fortress, the steam generated by the structure's gigantic propulsion jets flooding the city and freezing everything in its path.  Ray steals the ball again to create a makeshift rocket vehicle, and attempts to gain entry as the British Royal Navy attempts in vain to shoot it down. Stephenson attempts to hold back the castle by shooting chains at it and pulling it back with steam locomotives. This attempt works for a few moments, but eventually all the chains snap from the strain.  Scarlett has since become worried about Ray, and has found herself trapped in the castle whilst searching for him. She is in the control room with Eddie as Ray arrives, and Lloyd (having escaped again) confronts Eddie about his actions before shooting him with a stolen gun, and having his body disappear in a cloud of steam.  With the castle steered off course from the battle, the structure has become unstable and threatens to explode over the city. Lloyd and Ray rush to redirect the castle over the [[Thames]], defeating Alfred, who is controlling a pair of gigantic construction claws in the process. At the last minute Eddie, whose metal body repelled the gunshot, appears alive and decides to lend a hand. Ray re-installs the stolen steam ball, and makes his way to the control room to make a final escape with Scarlett on an emergency jet pack, while Eddie and Lloyd halt the machine over the Thames and leave as well. The castle eventually detonates in a spectacular explosion, sparing the city of most of the destruction.  The ending montage reveals Ray returning home, and later becoming a global superhero (aka Steamboy) using the jet pack gear from the castle; his grandfather Lloyd introducing Ray to electricity and finally passing away; the [[Great War]] being fought with paratroopers and zeppelins; his father Eddie founding a corporate conglomerate; and Scarlett maturing and becoming a famous pilot.  
Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation
   On a planet inhabited by [[Bug (Starship Troopers)|Arachnids]], a squad of [[Mobile Infantry (Starship Troopers)|soldier]]s find themselves pinned down and surrounded on all sides by Arachnid forces—even with their new [[laser gun]] technology and assistance from [[psychic]] soldiers, the Arachnid assault overwhelms them. General Jack Shepherd ([[Ed Lauter]]) decides to make a last stand with four of his best soldiers to allow the majority of his surviving troops to escape. The plan works and the soldiers  escape, including Sergeant Dede Rake ([[Brenda Strong]]), psychic Lieutenant Pavlov Dill ([[Lawrence Monoson]]), Private Jill Sandee ([[Sandrine Holt]]) and her lover Private Duff Horton ([[Jason-Shane Scott]]), and Private Lei Sahara (Colleen Porch). Despite reaching relative safety, the team is whittled down by deadly storms and arachnid ambushes—including the only member of the platoon with a radio, Corporal Thom Kobe ([[Brian Tee]]). Lieutenant Dill is unable to command his soldiers as he receives traumatic visions of utter annihilation. He takes his anger out on Private Sahara, who is revealed to have been psychic but lost reliable control of her psychic abilities during [[puberty]].  The remaining [[refugee]]s find themselves sheltering within Hotel Delta 1-8-5, an old and abandoned structure containing Captain V. J. Dax ([[Richard Burgi]]), a disgraced soldier who killed his commanding officer and was sealed in a furnace. As a deadly [[dust storm]] kicks up, they find themselves without communications or back-up for a lengthy period of time and protect themselves with an electric pulse fence. Dax takes command, to the annoyance of Dill, and the two develop enmity. Dax sees Dill as an incompetent commander, while Dill sees Dax as a traitor to the Federation.  Soon after defenses for Hotel Delta are set up, General Shepherd and three soldiers return. While the troops there first think that all but one of their comrades has reached safety, it becomes clear that all their comrades but Shepherd have died, and Shepherd has been rescued by three soldiers including: the comatose private, Charlie Soda ([[Kelly Carlson]]); the strangely behaving technical sergeant Ari Peck ([[J. P. Manoux]]); and the medic, corporal Joe Griff ([[Ed Quinn]]). With the help of the newcomers they solve their technical issues, including lack of communication, and wait for a Fleet [[Dropship (science fiction)|dropship]] to rescue them. At the base, Soda showers and seduces Horton. Meanwhile, Sandee finds a new significant other in Griff, causing tempers to flare; however, both Horton and Sandee soon act strangely, as do many other survivors. Sahara seems to have become ill as she has nightmares and wakes up vomiting. Sahara accidentally brushes Griff's hand and she has a psychic vision. She goes to Rake for advice and tells her what has happened. Rake suggests that Sahara is simply pregnant, which can cause visions, make girls temperamental, and make them think that "they know it all". Eventually private Sahara and Dax, the male ex-hero of the federation, find themselves facing a new breed of Arachnid—a bug that infests the human body by entering through the mouth and propagating inside the [[brain]]. They go to Dill with their news and make amends with him, also learning that he made bad decisions only because of the visions he was having and that he feels incredibly guilty over the loss of men under his command during the escape. Sahara tells Dill that she has been receiving parts of the vision as well, and Dill tells Sahara that an occasional side-effect of [[pregnancy]] is a temporary return of the psychic abilities lost at puberty.  Soon after making amends, Dill finds the general recently infected by Soda, who, just as with Horton, had seduced him to transmit the mind-controlling bug orally.  He attempts to capture her along with several infected soldiers to be studied, but as he rants about the horrors that await them, another infected soldier kills him with the knife that Dax had given him. The murder is blamed on Dax, as his name was inscribed on the knife, and he is imprisoned.  Eventually a dropship arrives to find all the troopers infected, including Shepherd who, if returned to [[Earth]], may infect the leaders of the Federation. Rake takes multiple [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]] shots, managing to wound one infected soldier and kill another before freeing Dax, but then kills herself because she has also been infected. A soldier attempts to infect Sahara, but she manages to kill him and escape. Sahara uses her restored psychic abilities to read the mind of the Arachnid that had attempted to control Rake's mind, and discovers the bugs plan: use General Shepherd to infest High Command, allowing the bugs to wipe out the human race and cause Sahara's vision to come true. Sahara and Dax kill the rest of the infected troops, and make it to the roof to confront the infected Shepherd just as the pulse fences fail. Shepherd is about to be rescued when Dax kills him. He gets Sahara onto the ship and tells the bewildered crew that she holds information vital to the survival of the Federation. He then refuses to get onto the ship ("''Murderers don't go home!''") and dies in a blaze of glory, fending off bugs.  Planet Earth, one year later. Sahara, now discharged from the military, attends a recruiting seminar with her newborn infant son to speak about her experience, and of Dax's actions which she credits for saving her life. Although Dax is labeled a Hero of the Federation, his death is shrouded in propaganda as the Federation uses his end as a means of recruitment. As Sahara leaves the recruiting station, the recruiting officer approaches her to thank her for attending and also tells her to raise her son well, as "We need fresh meat for the grinder." Sahara is visibly alarmed and flees the recruiting station, while the recruiter smiles callously.

The Stepford Wives (2004 film)
 Joanna Eberhart ([[Nicole Kidman]]) is a successful [[reality television]] executive producer. With her husband Walter ([[Matthew Broderick]]) and their two children, they move from [[Manhattan]] to Stepford, a quiet [[Connecticut]] suburb.  Joanna becomes friends with Bobbie Markowitz ([[Bette Midler]]), a writer and recovering [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], and Roger Bannister ([[Roger Bart]]), a [[Flamboyancy|flamboyant]] [[Homosexuality|gay]] man who has moved to town with his long-time partner, Jerry ([[David Marshall Grant]]). Joanna, Bobbie and Roger witness an incident in which Sarah Sunderson ([[Faith Hill]]), violently dances and then collapses.  Joanna argues with Walter about the incident with Sarah. He tells her that her children barely know her, that their marriage is falling apart, and that she is so domineering that people literally want to kill her. Walter tries to walk out of their marriage but Joanna appeases him by trying to fit in with the other Stepford wives.  Joanna changes her look and tries to become a housewife. Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger go to Sarah's home to check up on her. They discover that Sarah has left the door open and they walk in and try to go upstairs. They quickly return downstairs to hide, and they find a [[remote control]] labeled SARAH. While playing with it, they inadvertently cause Sarah's breasts to enlarge before she falls on the staircase behind them. They run away to Bobbies messy and unmade home. Roger confides to them that Roger and his husband are having marital issues and went to Stepford to get better like Bobbie (court order), Joanna (as a last resort) and their husbands.  The Stepford women appear extremely vapid and shallow; in the Stepford [[Book discussion club|book club]], their story is a catalogue of [[Christmas]], [[Chanukah]] collectibles, and decoration tips. In the men's assosiation, Walter tells the other husbands that Joanna is planning to change. They show Walter that Ted's wife is a robot.  Joanna and Bobbie sneak into the men's association to spy on the husbands. They discover a hall filled with family portraits and are caught by Roger. Roger tells them that there is nothing wrong and the girls leave. The next day Joanna and Bobbie discover Roger's favorite flamboyant clothes, playbills, and a photo of Orlando Bloom in the Trash.  Jerry tells them to meet them in town hall and they see Roger, apparently running for senator, with a new look and a new personality. Joanna wants to leave and Walter agrees with her saying that they should leave the next day. At night, Robo dog gives her a remote with her name. Joanne goes into Walter's study and discovers that all the Stepford wives were once working women in high power positions and that a champion terrier vanished and is believed to be robo dog.  The next day, Joanne visits Bobbie and she notices her house is spotless. Bobbie is blond, dressed in a Sunday dress, and blends with the other Stepford wives. The new Bobbi says that she is a whole new person and the most important thing is her cookbook. Bobbie, while telling Joanna that she can help her change, puts her hand over the fire and doesn't notice.  Joanna wants to leave and calls the camp for her kids but she finds out that they were taken by Walter. She goes back to the mens association and finds her family picture where looks like a Stepford wife. She sees all the husbands and discovers Walter confesses that after marrying Joanna he has felt undermined and all the husbands feel the same. Mike shows how they insert nano chips into their wives brain and turn them into Stepford wives. The men corner Joanna and Walter and force them toward the transformation room, but before Joanna enters, she makes a final appeal by asking whether the new wives really mean it when they tell their husbands that they love them.  The next scene shows all of the Stepford wives, including Joanna who is dressed in a Sunday dress and is blonde, are in the grocery.  With Joanna and Walter as the guests of honour, Stepford hosts a formal ball. During the festivities, Joanna distracts Mike ([[Christopher Walken]]) and entices him into the garden while Walter slips away. Walter returns to the transformation room where he destroys the software that makes the women obedient. Walter returns to the ball, where the baffled husbands are cornered by their vengeful wives. Walter reveals that Joanna never received the microchip implant; her argument during the struggle had won him over and out of his love for and loyalty to the human being he married, he joined her plan to infiltrate Stepford with her ''pretending'' to be a cyborg. Mike threatens Walter, but before Mike can attack, Joanna hits Mike with a candlestick, decapitating him and revealing that he is a robot, and not even partially biological.  Claire ([[Glenn Close]]) explains that she created Stepford because she, too, was a bitter, career-minded woman; in her case, a tired brain surgeon. When she discovered that Mike was having an affair with her research assistant Patricia, she [[murder]]ed them in a jealous rage. When Joanna wonders aloud why Claire did not simply make the men into cyborgs, she replies that she planned to turn the whole community into cyborgs. Claire then [[electrocution|electrocutes]] herself by kissing Mike's severed robotic head.  Six months later, [[Larry King]] is interviewing Joanna, Bobbie, and Roger, with Walter also in attendance. They have all met with success; Joanna has made a documentary, Bobbie has written a book of poetry, and Roger broke up with Jerry and won his State Senate seat as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Independent (politician)|Independent]]. Before ending the interview, King asks about the fate of the other husbands of Stepford. Bobbie reveals that they are being retrained back in Connecticut. The closing scene of the film reveals that the irate wives have taken over Stepford and forced their husbands to atone for their crimes by placing them under [[house arrest]].  
Stella Street
  Stella Street depicts its celebrities as finding refuge from the madness of their famous lives in the banality of suburbia and the "everyday" situations they may come across, albeit tinged with a hint of surrealism and comedy referenced from their own stereotyped behaviour.  Examples include Roger Moore visiting David Bowie at Christmas in order to give him a face flannel as a present. A game of ''[[Monopoly]]'' between the celebs. Michael Caine trying to instruct Dean the builder on how to build him a kidney shaped swimming pool, and [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]] running the local [[corner shop]].  
Strähl (film)
  Lonesome and medicament addict narcotics detective Herbert Strähl ([[Roeland Wiesnekker]]), who hardly can handle his own life, wants to clean up the [[Langstrasse]] area. Strähl often watches Berisha ([[Adem Kicai]]), the head of a drug trafficking ring, leaving his limousine and entering a dubious building, but he isn’t able to arrest him, due to the lacking of an evidence (Berisha never touches the drugs by himself).  Strähl, who hides his depression and craving for love behind rage, clamor and stimulant drugs, has arguments with his chief Brunner ([[Max Rüdlinger]]) and with his co-workers, e.g. with Ruedi Lautenschlager ([[Mike Müller]]), who is rather dull and often visits brothels. When Beat ([[Raphael Clamer]]), a former member of the Seepolizei (Police unit on lake), joins the team, Strähl thinks, the new blood was too calm and not tough enough.  During a [[Search and seizure|house search]], a junkie named René Wehrli ([[Manuel Löwensberg]]) falls out of the window. Strähl gets suspended from police service. Moreover, René and his girlfriend Carol “Caro” Hertig ([[Johanna Bantzer]]) blackmail Strähl for smart money.  The drug addict couple buys a lot of articles in a kiosk, and Strähl has to pay for them (René also fills out a “Toto”-ticket (sports betting) there, and Strähl positively influences him doing it). Despite that, René doesn’t want to take back his inculpatory statement – René demands a huge amount of heroin from Strähl.  Strähl catches the dealer Beko (Nderim Hajrullahu), who is related to Berisha’s drug mafia, and presses him to cooperate. Beko shows a lot of hidden drugs to Strähl. Strähl uses a part of the drug depot's heroine to satisfy René. René, Caro and Strähl drive to the police station, where René wants to deny his statements to Strähl, while the others wait in the car. René stays in for a long time, and Strähl gets curious about what happened in the building. He goes in, too – and finds René dead in the restrooms.  Strähl and Caro smoke drugs on a foil at Strähl’s. Suddenly, the police enter the flat and find the heroin. The delinquents are escorted away in a car, but Strähl manages to open Caro’s door to let her escape (Her plastic-handcuffs can be cut off later).  Before René entered the police station he had given a roll of [[Smarties]] to Caro. It contained a 120'000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] winning “Toto”-ticket. Caro, on the run, now wants to encash the ticket as fast as possible. But the kiosk-woman isn’t allowed to pay out such a high amount of cash (the ticket has to be sent in). So Caro asks Beko, if he knew someone, who could exchange the ticket against cash within an hour. The mafia agrees (They offer 80’000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]]) and the parties meet at a small park. The situation escalates and Caro throws a handgrenade (that René once took from a dead junkie). The grenade doesn’t go off.  Finally Strähl succeeds in arresting Berisha, thanks to a hint by new blood Beat – hiding a serious amount of confiscated drugs in Berisha’s trunk.  
The Story of an African Farm (film)
 The setting is a farm on the slopes of a Karoo Kopje, South Africa, during the 1870s. Fat Tant Sannie ([[Karin van der Laag]]) looks after her charges, the sweet Em ([[Anneke Weidemann]]) and the independent Lyndall ([[Kasha Kropinski]]), with a strict Biblical hand - it was Em's father's dying wish. Gentle Otto ([[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]), the farm manager, runs the farm and cares for Waldo, his son. Waldo ([[Luke Gallant]]) is bright, and busy building a model of a sheep-shearing machine that he hopes will make them all rich. Things change when the sinister, eccentric Bonaparte Blenkins ([[Richard E. Grant]]) with bulbous nose and chimney pot hat arrives. Their childhood is disrupted by the bombastic Irishman who claims blood ties with Wellington and Queen Victoria and so gains uncanny influence over the girls' gross stupid stepmother, Tant Sannie.  As the story of Lyndall, Em and Waldo unfolds to its touching end, we learn not merely of a backwater in colonial history, but of the whole human condition.  Olive Schreiner's intense story of three children living in the African veldt has often been compared to [[Emily Brontë|Emily Brontë's]] [[Wuthering Heights]]. Wildly controversial at publication (1883) because of its feminist sentiments, the story has remained a touching and often wickedly funny portrayal of life on a late Victorian farm in South Africa.  
Steve + Sky
 Steve is a small-time drug runner, sentenced to time in prison when he is caught after his girlfriend accidentally rear-ends a police van. While in prison he meets Jean-Claude, a wheelchair user, and together they agree to start stealing motorcycles after they are both released.

There are two encounters between the two, both while at a bowling alley, before they first meet formally, at a [[brothel]] that Jean-Claude has opened, as Sky is a friend of Jean-Claude's daughter Charlotte.  The two start a casual relationship, but Sky seems to be genuinely in love whereas Steve if less committed. Steve plans to move to [[Slovenia]] with Jean-Claude to start a business, but it is ambiguous as to whether they actually make it. The film ends with Steve almost running over Sky while she is dancing across a pedestrian crossing and he is speeding in a stolen motorbike.  
Sternenberg (film)
 Franz (Mathias Gnädinger) is shocked when he returns after 30 years to his hometown Sternenberg – the primary school of Sternenberg will be closed as there is a just a handful of students in the small isolated village in the [[Töss Valley]], and the teacher thus would lose her job. Franz is concerned personally, hides a secret, as the teacher, Eva Joos (Sara Capretti), is his daughter. But he did not dare to tell Eva that he is her father. And, Eva repeatedly stressed that her father was an "asshole" who has never been interested in his family; she would not want to meet him, even if she could. To help Eva and to get in touch to her, Franz decides to save the school, and practices his action in an unusual way: he subscribes as a student and assumes that he had not attended as a child full-time school. He claims now his "right to education". The trick seems to work, and the minimum number of students is reached, but it needs to ensure that the school will continuously be funded. Franz goes along with the children to school, thus Eva reacts very dismissive at first, but they getting closer...<ref name="srf-sternenberg"></ref><ref name="cineman"></ref><ref name="outnow"/>  
Stratosphere Girl
  Teenager Angela (Chloé Winkel), who is skilled at drawing, meets and falls in love with an attractive [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Disc jockey|DJ]].  Encouraged by him, she goes to Japan to work at an exclusive club for rich businessmen, who like to meet with young blonde women.  From the start, the film is surreal with unique characters, clear and sharp cinematography, and slow panning camera work. [[Manga]] drawings are also used to enhance the plot and ambiance.  Angela seeks work at the aforementioned club and, after having been begrudgingly let in, she is met with derision by the other girls working there. However, despite having spurned some of the other girls, she soon proves to be a favorite among the patrons by pretending to be a [[Lolita]]-style 15-year-old to please the businessmen.  The plot has a sinister undertone of the possibility of murder of a girl, Larissa, whom Angela has replaced.  As the film goes on, we learn Larissa was possibly murdered, not by Japanese men in search of sick sexual fantasy fulfillment, but at the envious and jealous hands of her workmates.  In the last scenes we learn Larissa lives and, furthermore, this is when Angela is heralded with the contract to be a Manga artist.  
Straight-Jacket
 Guy Stone ([[Matt Letscher]]) is blissfully closeted, picking up tricks for one-night-stands, while capturing the country's heart as "America's most eligible bachelor" (starring in such films as ''The Love Barrel'' and ''I Married the Ghost''). However, Guy's carefully managed façade collapses when he comes up for the lead in S.R.O. studio's version of ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]''. Things turn sour for the film idol when a fellow actor, Freddie Stevens ([[Jack Plotnick]]) (famous in the film for portraying "Captain Astro" in a succession of [[Buck Rogers]] or [[Flash Gordon]]-type serial films), decides to steal the lead in ''Ben-Hur'' from Guy by taking a picture of Guy exiting a gay bar. Freddie plans to out Guy to the world and ruin his career. Jerry ([[Veronica Cartwright]]), Guy's repressed lesbian ball-bustingly ambitious agent, connives to cover up the impending outing and ensure Guy the role in ''Ben-Hur'' by marrying her client off with great fanfare to the studio head's secretary, Sally ([[Carrie Preston]]), who just happens to also be a slavishly devoted Guy Stone fan. However, Sally isn't aware the marriage is a sham.  To avoid his adoring new bride as much as possible, Guy has Jerry sign him onto the next available film, which turns out to be 'Blood Mine' — a disastrously arch pro-union film about the corrupt goings on at a coal mine (with lines like 'how can they call this a MINE when everything is THEIRS!?!'). The studio head, in fear of the red-baiting going on in Hollywood at the time, decides — true to Hollywood stereotype — rather than stop production on the film to instead water down the pro-union content wherever possible. The young, idealistic, and terribly handsome writer of the novel that the film is based on, Rick Foster, quickly gets roped into convoluting the plot of this already-bad adaptation of his heartfelt book largely because of a chance meeting between him and the film's star, Guy. The attraction the two men feel for one another is instantaneous and propels the rest of the plot forward.

These, among others, have come to Austria to make the film against the backdrop of a long-historied [[castle]].  While exploring this castle, Caroline meets and befriends a boy called Iakob and his [[dog]] [[Hannibal]]; who in turn introduce her to the castle's [[community]] of ghosts. These ghosts are variously the animated memories of the castle's deceased inhabitants or spirits of the nearby [[forest]]. All are longtime friends of Iakob.  Shortly after Caroline's introduction to the Ghosts, Otto's equipment begins to malfunction during the filming of crucial scenes. Iakob suspects the Ghosts; he and Caroline investigate, accompanied by Otto. At a [[lake]], they learn that the [[Nun]]s (the ghosts of heiresses consigned to the [[convent]]) have sabotaged Otto's tools so as to avoid being disturbed by them. To prevent such trouble without mitigating the film-making, Caroline and Iakob arrange for the relocation of the set to another [[courtyard]], which is larger and better situated.  Later, more trouble arises. A [[rooster]] living in the castle is in the habit of crowing every day at a particular [[hour]]; the Nuns depend on this for knowledge of when to wake and when to sleep. Without the rooster's crow, the Nuns would wake at the wrong hour and be disintegrated by the sunlight. Because the crowing interferes with the film's sound effects, sound manager Steven attempts to remove or kill the rooster; whereupon Caroline and Iakob endeavour to keep the rooster safe without allowing him to cause trouble.  More trouble arises when a group of boys with whom Iakob habitually plays sports envy his attention to Caroline. To punish Iakob, these boys distract Caroline, seize Iakob, and imprison him in a shed. Caroline, offended at being left alone, returns without investigation. Sometime after nightfall, Iakob is discovered by Hannibal, who overcomes a strong [[fear of ghosts]] to solicit help from the Nuns.  During the next day, Caroline refuses any contact with Iakob, believing that he was a willing participant in the plot. Iakob, uncertain of what he must do, visits the Nuns and asks for help. Initially, the Nuns reject his request; but Amalia, the eldest Nun, visits Caroline and leaves with her a [[scrying]] [[mirror]]. Looking into this mirror, Caroline sees the truth of the earlier events and consequently forgives Iakob.  Later, Caroline and Iakob notice that an unusual number of near-fatal accidents are occurring to Otto. Suspecting the ghosts of mischief, they confront the Nuns, who confess to desiring to kill Otto so that he may remain in the castle as a ghost. Iakob dissuades them, saying that even if Otto becomes a ghost, he will not forgive the Nuns for arranging his [[death]].  On the night before Caroline's departure, the ghosts invite Caroline, Otto, Lakob, and Hannibal to a farewell party. In the courtyard, the whole community of ghosts and spirits stand as if on a stage and recite a [[poem]] that evidently they have composed for the occasion;  "We are standing here, Where we belong, Singing to you A good-bye song, For Caroline... and Otto."  Having sung this repeatedly, with variations, the ghosts descend their platform and begin to [[dance]]. Otto, Caroline, and Iakob join in. Caroline thereafter makes another farewell to Iakob in the morning; and he, in turn, watches from the castle's wall as she departs.

Desperate not to spend Christmas alone, Drew calls all of his contacts to find a place to stay on Christmas, but he is not close enough to anyone to be invited.  He tracks down Missy's therapist, Dr. Freeman, at the airport, hoping to squeeze in a therapy session. The hurried doctor tells him to list all of his grievances and then burn them at his childhood home. The house is now occupied by the Valcos, who wonder what Drew is doing on their front lawn. When he sets his grievances on fire, Tom Valco sneaks up behind him and knocks him out with a shovel. After he comes to, Drew explains what he was doing and asks for a tour of the house. Thrilled to see his old room, Drew impetuously offers Tom $250,000 to let him spend Christmas with the Valcos. Tom accepts, and Drew's lawyer draws up a contract that requires the Valcos to pose as his family.  The next day, Drew forces the family to go out and buy a tree together, requiring Tom to wear a Santa cap in public. While they are trimming the tree, the eldest child Alicia arrives for the holidays and is stunned by Drew's presence.

He hires a local actor to play the part of his grandfather, whom he calls Doo-Dah.  Drew takes Alicia and her brother Brian sledding the next day. After crashing at the bottom of a hill, he moves in to kiss Alicia, who sneezes instead.

Meanwhile, Missy was won over by the bracelet, and when Drew's assistant informed her that he was spending Christmas with his family, Missy visits the Valcos' house with her parents. Drew promises the Valcos an extra $75,000 if they will play along for the evening, and they agree to pretend to be his family.  The visit between the two families steadily descends into chaos, culminating with everyone seeing Christine's glamour shots manipulated into pornography on Brian's computer. Missy's parents storm out, and Drew informs her that their relationship is over. Alicia finally draws out of Drew the truth about his family.

After his parents’ death, Kaveri Amma went to live in an old age home in [[Delhi]] and lost contact with Mohan. Mohan wishes to go to India and bring Kaveri Amma back with him to the [[United States|US]]. He takes a few weeks off and travels to India. He goes to the old age home but learns that Kaveri Amma no longer lives there and went to a village named Charanpur a few years ago. Mohan then decides to travel to Charanpur, in Uttar Pradesh.  Mohan decides to rent a [[caravan]] to reach the village fearing that he might not get the required facilities there. Upon reaching Charanpur, he meets Kaveri Amma and gets to know that it was Gita ([[Gayatri Joshi]]), Mohan’s childhood friend, who had brought Kaveri Amma following her parents’ death to stay with her. Gita runs a school in Charanpur and works hard to improve the living conditions of the villagers through education. However, the village is divided largely by caste and religious beliefs. Gita does not like Mohan’s arrival as she thinks that he will take Kaveri Amma back with him to the US, leaving her and her younger brother Chikku alone. Kaveri Amma tells Mohan that she needs to get Gita married first, and that it is her responsibility. Gita believes in women empowerment and gender equality. This attracts Mohan towards Gita and he too tries to help her by campaigning for education among backward communities and also girls.  Slowly love blossoms between Mohan and Gita. Kaveri Amma asks Mohan to visit a nearby village named Kodi, and collect money from a man named Haridas who owes it to Gita. The story gives a journey to Mohan very similar to what happened to Mahatma Gandhi after he came back from South Aftrica.  Mohan visits Kodi and feels pity seeing Haridas' poor condition, which is such that he is unable to provide his family with meals everyday. Haridas tells Mohan that since his caste profession of a weaver wasn't earning him any money, he shifted to tenant farming. But this change in profession led to his ostracization from the village and the villagers even denied him water for his crops. Mohan understands the pathetic situation and realises that many villages in India are still like Kodi. He returns to Charanpur with a heavy heart and decides to do something for the welfare of Charanpur.  Mohan extends his leave by three more weeks. He learns that electricity inconsistency and frequent power cuts are a big problem in Charanpur. He decides to set up a small hydroelectric power generation facility from a nearby water source. Mohan purchases all the equipment needed from his own funds and oversees the building of the power generation unit. The unit works and the village gets sufficient, consistent power from it.  However, Mohan is repeatedly called by NASA officials as the NASA project he was working on is reaching important stages and he has to return to the US soon. Kaveri Amma tells him that she prefers to stay in Charanpur as it will be difficult for her to adapt to a new country at her age. Gita also tells him that she will not settle down in another [[country]] and she would prefer it if Mohan stayed in India with her. Mohan returns to the US with a heavy heart to complete the project. However, in the US, he has flashbacks of his time in India and wishes to return. After the successful completion of his project, he leaves the US and returns to India with intentions of working at the [[Vikram Sarabhai Space Center]], from where he can also work with NASA. The movie ends showing Mohan staying in the village and wrestling near a [[temple]] .

Jin-tae is told by a superior that if he can earn the highest award for a South Korean soldier, the [[Order of Military Merit (South Korea)|Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit]], his brother can be sent home. Jin-tae volunteers for many dangerous missions and performs suicidal acts of bravery to earn the medal, and is quickly promoted to [[Chungsa|sergeant]]. His heroism during the urban battle of [[Pyongyang]] finally result in Jin-tae's nomination for the medal, but his combat experiences have made him into an emotionless killer, horrifying his younger brother.  The [[United Nations Command|U.N. coalition]] is eventually forced to retreat all the way back to Seoul when the Chinese enter the war on the North Korean side. Jin-tae finally earns his medal, but, in Seoul, Young-shin, suspected of joining the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Communist party]] during the Communist occupation, is arrested by a South Korean militia, and the brothers attempt to stop them. During the struggle, Young-shin is shot dead and the brothers are arrested for trying to rescue her. In the jail, Jin-tae's request to release his brother is refused and the security commander orders the prison set afire with the prisoners inside when the enemy forces approach. Trying to rescue his brother, Jin-tae loses consciousness and wakes up believing Jin-seok died in the fire. He murders the surrendering prison warden before being captured by Chinese soldiers.  In truth, however, Jin-seok had been transferred to a military hospital after barely escaping, rescued by 'Uncle Yang', a now-disabled veteran from their old unit. He learns that his brother had defected to the North Koreans, and now leads an elite North Korean formation known as the "Flag Unit." Jin-seok chooses to rejoin the Army, which had by now had retaken all of South Korea with U.N. support. He demands to be allowed to fight, at the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], but is denied. Jin-seok eventually defects, claiming to his captors he is Jin-tae's brother. The North Koreans, however, believe Jin-seok is a spy and are about to take him away for interrogation when their position is attacked by U.S. and South Korean forces. The attack frees Jin-seok, who continues his search as the position is captured in a vicious hand-to-hand battle. Before the U.N. forces could secure their gains, however, the "Flag Unit" arrives, tearing into them with Jin-tae at its head.  The brothers come face-to-face, but, not recognizing Jin-seok, Jin-tae attempts to kill him, with Jin-seok barely avoiding death before the elder Lee is briefly incapacitated. Jin-seok attempts to carry him away but is shot in the leg. With both of them wounded, Jin-tae finally recognizes his brother and the two have a tearful reunion, but this is cut short as the North Koreans force back the U.S. and South Korean troops. Jin-Tae orders his brother to save himself. Jin-seok initially refuses, but relents after Jin-Tae promises that they will meet again. As the wounded Jin-seok limps to safety, Jin-tae mans a machine gun and provides cover fire for his brother and the other South Koreans before being killed.  In 2003, the elderly man, Jin-seok, stands at the excavation site; the remains initially identified as him are those of Jin-tae. He examines Jin-tae's few excavated belongings, including their long-lost silver pen, and begs his brother's skeletal remains to speak to him, quoting his promises as his granddaughter looks on with sympathy. Back in the 1950s, in the [[aftermath of the Korean War]], Jin-seok returns to his mother, who also survived, discovers the shoes to which his brother had dedicated himself to perfecting, and heads off with Young-shin's younger siblings in a now-peaceful, but ruined, Seoul as the nation begins rebuilding. He reassures them that he will return to school, fulfilling the promise he made to Jin-tae.  
Swing Girls
 On a hot summer's day, 13 schoolgirls are bored in a remedial [[math]] class. One girl, Tomoko, watches the school's [[brass band]] leave to perform at a baseball game, but their [[bento]] lunches arrive just moments after the bus leaves. Tomoko and the other girls persuade their teacher, Mr Ozawa, to let them deliver the lunches. On the train, the girls eat one of the lunches, then fall asleep and miss their stop. Rather than wait for a return train, they walk back to deliver the lunches to the band.  However, the delay in the summer heat has spoiled the meals, and all 42 band members become sick, as is their instructor, Ms. Itami. Only the cymbal player, Nakamura, whose lunch had been eaten, is unaffected.  The next day, Nakamura holds an audition for band replacements, to play at an important, upcoming baseball game. Initially, only three girls show up -- two former members of a punk band, and the shy Sekiguchi. As electronic guitars and Sekiguchi's flute will be of no use, Nakamura confronts the other girls. Knowing that they were at fault for the food poisoning, he threatens to turn them in if they don't join. The girls have no musical experience and clown around with their instruments, except for Sekiguchi. As they are several members short of a brass band, Nakamura decides to turn the girls into a [[big band]] and perform [[swing jazz]], incorporating the electronic bass and guitar to fill out their numbers.  Sekiguchi's interest and inherent talent inspire the other girls to pay more attention, and they, too, come to enjoy playing their instruments, as Nakamura trains the girls hard throughout the week.  Nakamura buys an electronic keyboard, necessary for the Big Band sound. However, on the day before the game, just as the girls have become proud of their growing abilities, the recovered brass band members return to good health, school and their instruments.   The girls are devastated.    As the new school year begins, Tomoko and Sekiguchi visit the school band, but don't join.  Tomoko instead buys an aged, used saxophone, and while playing it by the river, discovers Nakamura playing his keyboard. The members of the swing band gather at school, and decide to buy their own instruments.   The girls get supermarket jobs to earn money, but Tomoko and several others lose their wages when a cooking demonstration gets out of hand, triggering the store's fire sprinkler system. The girls who keep their jobs go their own way, to spend their money on designer clothes and run off with the school baseball team. The remaining girls spend a day picking [[matsutake]] mushrooms, but they are attacked by a boar; they manage to kill it and claim reward money, as the boar had been destroying crops.  With the reward money, they buy second-hand instruments, but these are in need of repair.  The two rockers convince their ex-boyfriends (who operate an auto wrecking yard) to repair them. The group, now dubbed "Swing Girls" (to which Nakamura adds "And A Boy") play their first public show (a flop) where Sekiguchi meets an anonymous jazz fan, who gives her a few words of advice.  Chasing him to his home, they discover that he is their math teacher, Mr. Ozawa, who possesses an extensive collection of jazz records.  Believing him to be an expert saxophone player, they convince him to lead the band and teach them, not knowing that he was actually an untrained amateur.   Their skills improve, and the girls who had left buy their own instruments and rejoin.  The band records an audition tape for a winter music festival. They leave Tomoko in charge of the tape, but she sends it too late and the band is rejected as the bands are selected on a first-come, first-served basis. Tomoko is too embarrassed to tell the others, as they prepare for their big performance. Nakamura discovers that Mr. Ozawa is not really a professional saxophonist, and the embarrassed teacher leaves the band.   On the train to the music festival, Tomoko confesses that the band have no place at the festival, and the train is halted by snow.  However, Ms. Itami finds them and informs them that another band could not perform due to the snow, so she had come in the school band's bus to rush them to the festival. Late, they rush onstage as the festival is ending, barely in time to perform. They gave a 15-minute concert, wowing the crowd.  
The Syrian Bride
 Set in the summer of 2000, Mona ([[Clara Khoury]]), a young [[Druze]] woman living at [[Majdal Shams]] in the [[Golan Heights]], is about to marry a successful [[Syria]]n actor. Following the hostilities between [[Israel]] and [[Syria]] there is now the demilitarised [[UNDOF]] zone between [[Golan Heights#History since the Six-Day War|occupied Golan]] and Syria observed by [[United Nations]] staff. Crossing of the zone is extremely rare as it is only granted by both sides under special circumstances. It has taken 6 months to obtain permission from the Israeli administration for Mona to leave the Golan. When Mona crosses she will not be able to return to her family on the Golan even to visit. Mona is a bit hesitant also because she doesn't know her husband-to-be.  Her father Hammed ([[Makram Khoury]]) openly supports the reunification with Syria and has just been released on bail from an Israeli prison. For this personal sacrifice he is respected by the elders of the village—yet when there is word that his son Hattem ([[Eyad Sheety]]) who has married Evelyna ([[Evelyn Kaplun]]), a Russian doctor, breaking with Druze tradition, is returning to see his sister off, they make it clear to the father that they will shun him too if he allows Hattem to come to the wedding.  Mona's sister Amal ([[Hiam Abbass]]) is unhappily married and has two daughters who are almost grown up. She is considered a somewhat free spirit as she and her daughters wear trousers. Now she is even considering training as a social worker. Her elder daughter wants to marry the son of a pro-Israeli villager. Amal's husband feels put in an awkward position, as tradition demands that the male head of the family controls the other members of the family to act in a socially acceptable manner. Amal is seen advising her daughter not to give up her studies irrespective of whatever pressures she may face from the family or society. This gives insight into Amal's persona.  The second brother, Marwan ([[Ashraf Barhom]]), is a shady merchant doing deals in Italy and obviously a womanizer. Yet nobody seems to object to his slightly unsettled lifestyle—quite a contrast to his brother who is only greeted by his mother and siblings.  Then, after the wedding feast, the bride is escorted to the border where her emigration runs into trouble, as the Israeli government has just decided to stamp the passports of Golan residents bound for Syria as leaving Israel. The Syrian officials still regard the Golan as part of Syria under foreign occupation, and a stamp like that is viewed as an [[wikt:underhanded|underhanded]] ploy by the Israelis to force the Syrian side to implicitly acknowledge the annexation.  So the UN liaison officer Jeanne goes back and forth until the Israeli official who put the stamp into the passport in the first place finally agrees to erase it with some [[correction fluid]]. Yet just as the problem seems to have been peacefully resolved, the solution is threatened by a change of position on the Syrian side.  In the end when it looks as if the wedding will be delayed at least for some days (which is regarded as a bad omen), the bride takes matters into her own hands. In our final view of her, she is walking with energy and determination toward the Syrian border; at the same time Amal walks away from the group with a determined face as if she would shatter the invisible fences which prevent her from pursuing her dreams.

  Deven Chaudhary ([[Ajay Devgn]]) lives with his mother ([[Farida Jalal]]) and only son Raj ([[Vatsal Sheth]]). Deven spends considerable time designing the perfect car, calling it DC &mdash; which is very futuristic and more advanced than any other car in the market &mdash; and registering its patent. The SUV car is said to have 400BHP and 500NM of torque, as well as making it from 0-60 in 5.2 seconds. He also looks after an older model car, handed over to him by his late father, and calls it "Taarzan". He meets with Rakesh Kapoor ([[Pankaj Dheer]]) and his partners, who praise his design but decline dealing with him, as they do not want to give [[royalty payment|royalty]] as part of the deal.  Later, Deven finds that Rakesh and his partners conned him and registered his design under their name. Deven reports this to a police officer, Inspector Sanjay Sharma ([[Deepak Shirke]]), but the latter turns out to be on Kapoor's payroll.

Twelve years later, Raj studies at a college and falls in love with a rich girl named Priya ([[Ayesha Takia]]). The young Raj now works in the garage of Kartar Singh ([[Amrish Puri]]) as a mechanic. One day, Raj discovers Taarzan and recognizes it immediately. He somehow pools money and buys it at a throwaway price, which was 5000 rupees. Raj wants to update the car that reminds him of his father. Little does he know that with the car, he has also brought back his father, whose soul is trapped inside the car.  Kartar is moved on learning this and aides Raj in repairing Taarzan. Taarzan is totally revamped and Raj decides to rename it DC, to honour his father's memory. Here, Deven's spirit possesses Taarzan and starts killing all the gentlemen responsible for the murder, including Inspector Sanjay Sharma. Since the car now belongs to Raj, he becomes a suspect in eyes of Inspector Khurana ([[Gulshan Grover]]), the investigating officer. Here, Kapoor returns to India after learning that all his partners have died. Kapoor is revealed to be Priya's father.  On Priya's insistence, Kapoor goes to meet Raj, but after learning that Raj is Deven's son, Kapoor assumes that Raj has somehow found the truth and is using Priya as a pawn. Kapoor decides to kill Raj and take Priya back with him. Priya and Raj are both clueless, but Raj is shocked when Kapoor tells him the truth. Here, Taarzan comes alive again and in front of disbelieving eyes of Kapoor and Raj, jumps in the ocean to save Raj. Deven's spirit now becomes visible to everybody.  In front of Raj, his grandmother, Priya and Inspector Khurana, a terrified Kapoor confesses the crime. Khurana arrests Kapoor, while Deven says his last goodbye to his mother and son. With Raj, his mother and Priya united, Deven's spirit becomes free and he ascends to heaven, with Raj and Priya living a happy life afterwards.

Taking Lives (film)
 In the early 1980s, teenagers Martin Asher ([[Paul Dano]]) and Matt Soulsby ([[Justin Chatwin]]) meet on a bus to [[Mont-Laurier|Mont-Laurier, Quebec]]. Seemingly uncertain of their ultimate destination, the two talk about their plans for the future. When their bus breaks down, the two acquire a car from a nearby garage. While Martin is driving, a tire blows. Matt struggles to change the tire and Martin comments on how he and Matt are both about the same height, and kicks Matt into the path of an oncoming truck, killing both him and the driver. Taking Matt's guitar and clothes, he walks away singing in a voice similar to Matt's.   Twenty years later, a successful [[FBI]] [[offender profiling|profiler]], Illeana Scott ([[Angelina Jolie]]), is summoned to help out the authorities in [[Montreal]] in apprehending a serial killer who assumes the identities of his victims,  enabling him to travel undetected across [[North America]]. Martin's mother Rebecca ([[Gena Rowlands]]) claims to have seen her son alive and well on a ferry to [[Quebec City]], leading to the body believed to have belonged to him being exhumed for forensic examination, and he becomes the primary suspect. Illeana, who has difficulty adjusting to her new surroundings and is distrusted by her local colleagues, interviews [[art dealer]] James Costa ([[Ethan Hawke]]), an eyewitness who saw Asher kill his last victim. Costa makes a drawing of the killer and the authorities manage to track down the man's apartment, only to find a decaying corpse chained up in the ceiling. Illeana goes to Rebecca's house to question her about her son, and while snooping around discovers a hidden passageway behind a [[cabinetry|cabinet]] that leads to a secret room used to house young Martin, an unwanted and unstable younger child whom Rebecca neglected and saw as inferior to her elder son, whom Martin ultimately killed out of jealousy. Illeana is attacked by a hidden assailant, who escapes before she can identify him.  Illeana determines that Asher is targeting people whose lives hold something his current one lacks, and that his latest target is Costa after his apartment is broken into and ransacked. Costa is subsequently used in a [[sting operation]] to lure and apprehend Asher, but the operation fails and Costa angrily refuses to be used as bait. During a show at his gallery, Costa is attacked by an assailant ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]), whom Illeana tries to apprehend, but loses in the crowds after a foot chase outside. For his protection, the police decide to move Costa out of town, but the next morning Costa is confronted by the same assailant, who attacks him and demands to have "what he wants." Costa's police escort is killed when he tries to intervene, and the assailant takes Costa hostage with a gun and drives away. Illeana gives chase, and causes the car to crash and explode just as Costa manages to escape.   As Illeana is preparing to return home, Costa visits her in her hotel room. The two, having grown close over the course of the investigation, make passionate love on a chest of drawers and the bed, surrounded by gruesome crime scene photos. The next morning, Illeana awakes to find herself partly covered in Costa's blood. At first, she fears he is dead, but then he awakes, and they discover he had merely popped the stitches in his arm that he received after the auto accident.  As Costa's stitches are repaired in the hospital, Scott is called down to the morgue as Rebecca has come to identify the charred body of the assailant. She's unable to confirm the body as Martin, and Illeana realizes that Asher must still be alive. Shocked, Rebecca leaves the morgue, and goes to the elevator, as Illeana chases after her. Before she can reach her, the elevator door closes, and Costa confronts her, revealing himself as the real Martin Asher. Costa kills his mother, and Illeana sees him covered in blood just as the elevator door between them closes. The police try to capture Asher who escapes the hospital. Scott returns to her hotel room and frantically washes herself, in a state of manic disgust. An investigation shows that the man killed in the car accident, was actually Christopher Hart, a drug dealer and art thief to whom Asher owed $80,000, and whom Asher murdered. The police chase Asher, but he escapes in a train station and boards a train headed east of [[Montreal]], meanwhile setting up his next victim, a sports talent scout. He calls Illeana on the phone and taunts her before hanging up and disappearing into the crowd of other passengers. Illeana admits to having consensual sex with Asher, and is consequently fired from the FBI.  Seven months later, Illeana is living in a desolate farmhouse by herself in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], [[Pennsylvania]] and looking heavily pregnant with Asher's twin boys. One day as she sits alone in her home, she discovers Asher has broken into her house. She frantically tries to escape, but Asher quickly overpowers her and then reveals he has found all the guns she had hidden throughout the house. Asher makes her tea and tells her they could start over and live together as a family, but a disgusted Illeana tells him she does not want to. Enraged, Asher begins beating and choking her and eventually stabs her in her belly with a pair of scissors. Illeana, seemingly unharmed by the stabbing, shocks Asher by quickly stabbing him in the heart with the same scissors. As Asher is on his knees looking at her in disbelief, Illeana removes a prosthetic pregnant belly, and tells him the past seven months have been a carefully planned trap. He falls over, dead, and Illeana calls her former Montreal colleague Inspector Leclair ([[Tchéky Karyo]]) to tell him that it's over.

Take a Deep Breath (film)
 The movie starts at a family dinner where Saša ([[Ana Franić]]), a discontent [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Belgrade Law School]] student who is still living with her parents, informs them about her decision to follow her boyfriend Stefan ([[Branislav Tomašević]]) to [[Canada]] since he had already accepted a job offer to coach [[water polo]] there. The parents who thought the young couple were about to announce their intention to get married can hardly hide their shock and disappointment at the unexpected turn of events. Saša's father Miloš ([[Bogdan Diklić]]), a conservative judge, is particularly not happy with the fact that she's leaving her studies. Saša also tells them that she's moving in with Stefan right away, even before her visa application is processed. The young couple then leaves the dinner in a bit of a huff.  While driving back to Stefan's apartment, they get into a car accident. Luckily both survive: Saša only with scratches and Stefan with minor head and leg injuries that require hospitalization. In the hospital Saša meets Stefan's sister Lana ([[Jelena Đokić]]), a charming [[Paris]]-based photographer who's come to Belgrade in order to take care of her injured brother. While Saša gets released from the hospital the same day she wakes up, Stefan is being held for a few more weeks.  While he recovers, his sister Lana seems to have forgotten the original intention of her arrival to Serbia, and spends all her time with Saša. Saša, who initially finds Lana to be very irritating, is being slowly seduced by her, and goes through the path of anger, denial, acceptance and outing in the time span of only few days.  Her parents, busy with their own separation and divorce, don't notice their daughter's love life confusion right away - more precisely, they have to be told so. Both of them react very differently. Mother ([[Mira Furlan]]), who has just realized that life should not be wasted in compromises but should be lived to the fullest, is very happy that her daughter has finally found her true love. On the other hand, Saša's father, who tries to keep his family together at all costs, becomes very unstable and angry after hearing these news, which for him represent the last drop.  Releasing all his suppressed anger, he has Lana followed and arrested for one night on a traffic violation account, which results in Lana's change of spirit - from a joyful but a little superficial and inconsiderate girl she becomes a crushed pessimist, decided to escape the troublesome situation. She confronts Stefan and breaks up with Saša by telling her that "it was a nice dream" and that "she wishes for her to fall in love again", suggesting that she herself could not love again. She leaves for Paris, and things eventually work out for Stefan, who splits for Canada with a nurse from the hospital, and for Saša's mother too, who moves to [[Vienna]] with her new husband and her little stepdaughter. Saša's father dies on, so to say, the consequences of his bogus heart condition and Saša is left completely alone to stand still in a world where everybody else seems to be going places, even though in different directions.  A viewer is being left with a distinct feeling of "plots behind the plot", i.e. there are several stories from the life of the protagonists, which are implied to but not quite revealed. Those are for example: the story about Stefan's and Lana's childhood and their relationship in general; the story about Saša's father's youth and marriage; the relationship between Saša's father and his assistant; and the most important - what has happened that night in prison and why has Lana decided to drop the fight so quickly. Although it may sound as a disadvantage of the scenario, it actually complements it (except, maybe, the unclearance of Lana's mindchanging).  
Take Out (2004 film)
 [[Image:Ming and Young from the film TakeOut.jpg|thumb|left|Young and Ming outside the take-out]] ''Take Out'' is a day-in-the-life of Ming Ding (Charles Jang), an illegal Chinese immigrant working as a deliveryman for a Chinese take-out shop in New York City. Ming is behind with payments on his huge debt to the smugglers who brought him to the United States. The collectors have given him until the end of the day to deliver the money that is due. After borrowing most of the money from friends and relatives, Ming realizes that the remainder must come from the day's delivery tips. In order to do so, he must make more than double his average daily income.  In a social-realist style, the camera follows Ming on his deliveries throughout the upper Manhattan neighborhood where social and economic extremes exist side by side. Intercutting between Ming's deliveries and the daily routine of the restaurant, ''Take Out'' presents a harshly real look at the daily lives of illegal Chinese immigrants in New York City.   
Taka (film)
   
Taxi (2004 film)
  Belle Williams ([[Queen Latifah]]) is a talented driver and auto mechanic who dreams of driving in [[NASCAR]]. As the film opens, she celebrates her last shift as a bicycle courier after earning her taxi license and beating the shop's record with a new delivery record of 13 minutes and 54 seconds. Although in a happy relationship, she occasionally neglects her boyfriend Jesse ([[Henry Simmons]]) and has bestowed much love on her custom-built [[Ford Crown Victoria#Second generation (1998–2012)|1999 Ford Crown Victoria]] taxicab over the past five years. She skips her dinner date, to install a supercharger that was given to her as a present for her last day.  The next day, her first customer offers her a $100 tip if she can make it to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] in fifteen minutes. She makes it in 9 minutes and 28 seconds, while almost getting caught speeding on the freeway and through Manhattan. Meanwhile, a group of beautiful women exit the airport, with a man waiting for them.  The action cuts back to New York City where bumbling undercover detective Andrew "Andy" Washburn ([[Jimmy Fallon]]) is about to bust a phone card ring from Cuba. He makes up a street name in Havana, which blows his cover, and a gunfight develops. Washburn's partner is wounded in the arm and the Cubans escape. Trying to follow them in his partner's car, he reverses it into a store, killing the detective's parrot. Back at the precinct station, Washburn's boss Lt. Marta Robbins ([[Jennifer Esposito]]) - who is also his former girlfriend that he retains unrequited feelings for, confiscates his driver's license and demotes him indefinitely to foot patrol duty.  Later, hearing of a bank robbery, Washburn  tries to flag down a car in the middle of a street, causing dozens of civilians and their cars to crash into each other, resulting in a major pileup. He flags down a taxicab, which turns out to be Belle's. He commandeers the car which transforms into the street car from earlier. They arrive at the bank just as the four robbers leave in a BMW.   Washburn accidentally shoots out one of Belle's windows and they end up cornering the BMW in an alley. The BMW driver cleverly gives Belle the slip, but as the car passes, she recognizes the occupants as the same models from the airport. Their leader is Vanessa ([[Gisele Bündchen]]). In a misunderstanding, police arrive and hold up Belle and Washburn.  Belle's cab is impounded as evidence and she is taken in for questioning as a witness to the robbery; she is upset as it means the loss of two weeks' earnings. Washburn promises to get her cab back if she will join him on his beat—thus solving the problem of his confiscated license.  Belle and Washburn pursue the robbers, getting close once or twice. Washburn takes Belle to his home. Washburn's mother ([[Ann-Margret]]) is constantly drunk and always has a batch of margaritas going in the blender. She brings up embarrassing moments of Washburn's past and talks about why he's such a bad driver.  Later, Washburn talks to the impound cop ([[Patton Oswalt]]) and eventually convinces him to give him and Belle the cab back. They realize that the gang always robs banks just before the garbage collection is due. The robbers take the money, put it in the trash and the garbage man collects it. However, because of constantly disobeying orders, Washburn is fired. Later that night, Belle teaches him to drive with "[[This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)]]" playing on the radio. They discover the garbage collector on the bank route has been performing collections for the gang because they have kidnapped his wife. They trace the kidnapper and recover the garbage collector's wife and all the loot.  The police learn which bank is next to be hit, and they lie in wait for the robbers, who take a hostage. After a hostage swap, the gang escapes with Lt. Robbins as hostage, followed by Washburn and Belle in her cab. Belle calls on the help of her former bike messengers to pinpoint the location of the car. Using the cash from the garbage truck, they pinpoint the operation HQ and negotiate a trade.   Belle transforms the cab and during the ensuing chase, they continually try to swap the hostage for the money while driving down the highway.

The team comprises Lisa, a young [[Psychology|psychologist]]; Carson, her love interest; Sarah, a [[psychic]]; Joe, a [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] who is in love with Sarah; and Chris, a [[martial arts]] expert who harbors a deep hatred of actors. Carson proposes to Lisa, but a terrorist shoots him dead.  Team America leader Spottswoode brings [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor Gary Johnston to Team America's base in Mount Rushmore and asks him to use his acting skills to infiltrate a terrorist cell. Unbeknownst to the team, [[North Korea]]n dictator [[Kim Jong-il]] is supplying international terrorists with [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Gary infiltrates a terrorist group in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], and the team kills the terrorists. However, the city is left in ruins, drawing criticism from the [[Screen Actors Guild|Film Actors Guild]], (Often shown abbreviated as 'F.A.G.' in the film) a union of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] Hollywood actors led by [[Alec Baldwin]].  At the base, Gary tells Lisa that, as a child, his acting talent caused his brother to be killed by gorillas. While the two grow close and have sex, terrorists blow up the [[Panama Canal]] as retaliation for Cairo, which the Film Actors Guild blames on Team America. Gary, feeling his acting talents have again resulted in tragedy, leaves Team America. The remaining members depart for the Middle East, but are captured by North Korean forces. In North Korea, Kim invites the Film Actors Guild and world leaders to a peace ceremony, planning to detonate a series of bombs while they are distracted.  Succumbing to [[Depression (mood)|depression]], Gary is reminded of his responsibility by a speech from a drunken [[Drifter (person)|drifter]]. Returning to the team's base, he finds Spottswoode has survived a suicide bomb attack by [[Michael Moore]].

They engage in a fight with the Film Actors Guild in which most of the actors are killed.  After Gary uses his acting skills to save Chris's life, Chris confesses to Gary that he hates actors because when he was 19 years old, he was raped by the cast of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''. Gary goes on stage and convinces the world's leaders to unite using the drifter's speech. Kim kills Baldwin and is kicked over a balcony by Lisa. He is impaled on a [[Pickelhaube]], exposing his true form, an enormous cockroach, which flees in a spaceship, promising to return. Gary and Lisa begin a relationship and the team reunites, preparing to combat the world's terrorists.

Teacher's Pet (2004 film)
  Spot is a dog who wants nothing more than to be a boy, a fantasy he has been fulfilling for one year, dressing as a boy named Scott Leadready II, and going to school with his master Leonard Helperman. Leonard is looking forward to spending the summer with his dog, but Spot proudly declares "I Wanna Be a Boy". Mary Lou Helperman, the fourth-grade teacher and Leonard's mother, is nominated for a "Teacher of the Year" award, and given use of Principal Strickler's [[Winnebago Industries|Wentawaygo]] to travel to the finals in Sunny Southern Florida, under the condition that no dogs are allowed in the RV. Leonard sadly bids farewell to Spot ("A Boy Needs a Dog") as he and his mother depart.  Spot, along with the Helpermans' other pets, Pretty Boy and Mr. Jolly, are left with a pet-sitter when Spot accidentally sits on the remote and changes the channel to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|The Barry Anger Show]]''. Anger's special guest is a "wacko" named Dr. Ivan Krank, who claims he can turn animals into human beings, who happens to be located in Sunny Southern Florida. Believing it to be fate, Spot chases down the RV. Spot and Leonard meet up at a gas station. Through many quick costume changes, Spot fools Mrs. Helperman into believing that he is Scott Leadready II and that his family, ''en route'' to Sunny Southern Florida, had to return home, but he could still go with the Helpermans. Spot, Leonard, and Mrs. Helperman continue on their way to Florida, singing through all fifty states ("''A Whole Bunch of World''").  Meanwhile, Pretty Boy and Mr. Jolly, back at home, see another episode of ''Barry Anger'' in which Anger reveals that Krank cannot turn animals into people, but rather into terrifying mutant creatures. They decide that they must track down Spot and stop him from being turned into a monster, but Mr. Jolly is afraid to leave the house. Pretty Boy assures him that they can be tough despite their size ("''Small But Mighty''")  Upon arriving in Florida, Mrs. Helperman goes directly to the Teacher of the Year finals, and Leonard is all ready to play fetch, but Spot has other ideas. He reveals to Leonard the real reason he came to Florida, to become a real boy. Leonard is skeptical, but accompanies Spot to Krank's lab, where Krank has just unsuccessfully tried to turn a frog human. He is ready to destroy his machine when Spot and Leonard show up. Spot tells him that his machine can't work with a frog because it's a lower life form, like his other two creatures, Dennis (an alligator-man) and Adele (a mosquito-girl), and that he needs a mammal, like a dog. Krank agrees to turn Spot human, and gives him a nickel as payment for being his test subject. Krank explains that, throughout his entire life, people have mocked his ideas ("''I, Ivan Krank''") and turns the machine on Spot.  Spot wakes up to find that he is indeed human—but not a boy as he expected, but rather a fully-grown man (he had forgotten to factor in dog time). Still, he is happy to be human, but the happiness quickly fades when Krank tells him that he will have to travel around with him forever to prove that Krank is not a wacko. Krank locks Leonard and "Scott" up, and hope seems lost until Ian, Krank's nephew and Leonard and Spot's classmate, shows up and sets them free. Krank grounds Ian and sends Dennis and Adele off to find his "dog-man". Leonard and Scott, meanwhile, are hungry, and Scott's clothes from when he was a dog disguised as a boy do not fit his adult body. They see a sign advertising a $100 reward for a lost dog. Scott uses the [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|Twilight Bark]] to locate the lost dog, along with her four puppies that had been born while she was lost. This prompts the dog's owner to give them $500, as they brought back five dogs. Now rolling in money, Leonard and Scott enjoy a day on the town.  The two lose track of time, but manage to make it back to the Wentawaygo just in time for dinner, forgetting that in place of Scott Leadready II is a stranger who Mrs. Helperman will not recognize. Scott and Leonard quickly make up a story that this new person is Scott Manly-Manning, Scott Leadready II had to go home, and he helped him out. Mrs. Helperman invites Scott in for coffee and soon begins to fall for him. Scott presents an idea to Leonard as to how they can stay together: he will marry Leonard's mother and they'll all be able to live together. Leonard is not okay with this; Scott is his dog, not his dad. Scott tells him he's not his dog anymore. Finally fed up with Scott's stubbornness, Leonard disowns Scott as his Dog and he confiscates Scott's collar and tells Scott to leave him and his mother alone. Scott storms off, leaving everyone else lamenting the loss: Mary Lou of her "Manly-Manning Man", Leonard of his dog, Krank of his creation, and Dennis and Adele, along with Pretty Boy and Jolly, search for Spot ("''I'm Moving On''"). Pretty Boy and Jolly finally make it to Florida, and Leonard tells them the whole story. He comes to the conclusion that the only way he and Scott can be together is for him to go to Krank and have him turn him into a dog. ("''A Boy Needs a Dog (Reprise)''"). Scott arrives moments after Leonard leaves, and after getting over the shock of seeing Spot as a human, Pretty Boy and Jolly tell him that Leonard has gone to Krank's lab.  Krank plans to turn Leonard into a dog and use him as bait to get Scott back, and then he will have both the boy-dog and the dog-man. Scott arrives at the lab just as Leonard is being strapped to the table. Dennis detains Scott, Pretty Boy and Jolly, but they escape by tickling him. Scott unties Leonard and destroys Krank's machine by inserting the nickel that Krank had given him earlier into a slot on the machine marked "Quarters Only". The machine starts firing at random, turning Krank into a mouse and seemingly killing Scott, turning him into a pile of blue dust. Leonard angrily beats the machine and it fires at the blue dust and turns Scott back into his original dog form. Leonard and Spot reunite, and Spot decides that he is "''Proud to Be a Dog''".

The Terminal
 Viktor Navorski, a traveler from the nation of Krakozhia, arrives at New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], only to find that his passport is suddenly no longer valid. The United States no longer recognizes Krakozhia as a sovereign nation after the outbreak of a civil war, and Viktor is not permitted to either enter the country or return home as he is now [[Statelessness|stateless]]. Because of this, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] seizes his passport and airline ticket.  With no other choice, Navorski settles in at the terminal with only his luggage and a peanut can, much to the frustration of Frank Dixon, the temporary customs director for the airport. Dixon is being considered for a promotion and becomes obsessed with getting rid of Navorski. Meanwhile, Navorski befriends and helps airport employees and travelers. Among them, a flight attendant named Amelia Warren, whom he sees periodically and tries to woo, presenting himself as a building contractor who is frequently traveling. Navorski had been hired by an airport contractor and paid [[Unreported employment|under the table]] after he impulsively remodeled a wall at a gate that was scheduled for future renovation.  One day, Dixon pulls Amelia aside and questions whether she knows Navorski's true situation. Amelia confronts Navorski at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the peanut can contains a copy of the photograph ''[[A Great Day in Harlem (photograph)|A Great Day in Harlem]]''. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the famous portrait in a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] newspaper in 1958, and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 of the musicians featured on it. He died before he could get the last one, from tenor saxophonist [[Benny Golson]]. Navorski has come to New York to do so. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Navorski.  After nine months, Navorski friends wake him with the news that the war in Krakozhia has ended. Amelia also asked her "friend"—actually a married government official with whom she had been having an affair—to get Navorski a one-day emergency visa to fulfill his dream, but Viktor is disappointed to learn she has renewed her relationship with the man during this process. Moreover, Navorski finds out that Dixon must sign the visa. Seizing the opportunity, Dixon threatens to cause trouble for Navorski's friends, most seriously by deporting janitor Gupta back to India, where he is wanted for attempted murder of a police officer. Unwilling to let this happen, Navorski finally agrees to go home to Krakozhia. When Gupta learns of this, however, he runs in front of the plane as it taxies to the terminal, resulting in his deportation, effectively taking the burden off Navorski.  The delay gives Navorski enough time to go into the city. Dixon, watching Navorski leave the airport, decides not to pursue him. Navorski arrives in New York at the hotel where Benny Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph. Then he gets in a taxi, telling the driver, "I am going home."

Terkel in Trouble
 Terkel is in 6th grade at a [[secondary school]] together with his best friend Jason, who carries an [[iron]] pipe with him at all times even though he keeps on dropping it and [[Profanity|curses]] about it. Terkel and Jason are playing a [[Game Boy]] in the schoolyard of Chestnutlane one day when a strange man in a green [[panda]] [[sweater]] approaches them. The man, Justin (Danish: Gunnar Bjerre), tells Terkel that he has sat on a [[spider]]. "No, it's no biggie. They're just [[jeans]], and they can easily be washed," Terkel says.  Terkel's teacher Yvonne gets fatally run over (much to the rejoice of the class), and the class's new teacher is the strange Justin. Terkel's parents Sheila and Leon get married on Saturday and the two "bully-boys" in his class, Nigel and Saki, manipulate Terkel to steal [[beer]] for them at the party. When Terkel's short-tempered, alcoholic and violent uncle Stewart Stardust notices, he beats up Nigel (Danish: Sten) (which also means "stone" in [[Old Norse|Norse]]) and Saki, for which they blame Terkel, so they begin bullying him, but no-one seems to want to help him.  One day the [[overweight]] girl in the class, Dumpy Doris (Danish: Fede Dorit ("Fede" means "Fat")) approaches Terkel with a [[love letter]]. When Nigel and Saki notice, they start teasing the two of them, calling them a couple. Terkel is torn: he wants to defend Doris, but instead, because he'd rather save face in front of the cool kids, he says "No, there's no way I love that fat cow!" Doris gets so upset that she jumps out the window on the fourth floor and dies (as the school principal says: "lucky that fat cow didn't land on anyone's head down there").  After that Terkel starts receiving death threats: on his desk, painted on the ceiling of his room, on a stone which breaks his window, in his notebook... His parents aren't of any help – his chainsmoking mother tells him about all the diseases he might develop in strange ways (like getting bird flu from wet wood) and his father only seems capable of one word: "No".  One day, Justin takes his class for a school trip where they are going to study the salamanders. Terkel doesn't want to go and begs his parents to let him stay at home. On the bus, Nigel and Saki invite Terkel to sit down with them. He does so and Jason becomes angry. During the bus trip, Justin sings a song about hard life. When they get to the forest, where they are going to study the salamanders, Nigel and Saki want him to sleep in their tent – he does. He gets a shock later when Saki stumbles into the tent with a black eye, telling him that Jason slapped him in the face. Terkel thinks that Jason is acting strangely aloof, and Nigel tells him that Doris was Jason's sister.  Terkel is terrified, and thinks that all the death threats were from Jason, because he made his sister commit suicide. As they're going to bed, Terkel finds a dead cat in his sleeping bag and he receives a [[Text messaging|text message]] from Jason's phone which says "I'm coming to kill you". Nigel and Saki advise Terkel to tell Justin, which he does. He wants to be safe from Jason, so Terkel insists that Justin come with him into the woods where he explains everything. Then he says "I'm call him now. I'll say I've told you everything." Justin protests, but Terkel does so and to his horror, he hears ringing sounds coming from Justin's pocket. The plot unravels, and it turns out all the death threats and messages had been from Justin as a revenge for Terkel sitting on the spider when they first met. Terkel flees, and a thrilling race through the woods commences. Just as Justin has Terkel cornered, he is saved in the nick of time by Jason, who finally puts his iron bar to use. During the struggle, the pipe is smashed into Justin's head, presumably killing him. Terkel and Jason go away in the sunset once again friends, only to be scared by the narrator and music teacher Barry who wears a hockey mask and a chainsaw. The camera moves back and shows the audience that Justin is still alive.  The final credits include some outtakes/bloopers, such as Leon being unable to remember his lines: "No".

They Came Back
  The recently deceased of an anonymous French town suddenly return to life, calmly streaming forth from a cemetery in a silent procession. The town council, led by the mayor (Victor Garrivier), makes plans to house the returned and help reintroduce them to society. The mayor informs the council that the event has lasted for roughly two hours throughout France, returning an estimated 70 million people to life nationwide, with more than 13,000 in their town alone, all of whom had died within the previous 10 years.  However, the reintegration poses challenges. The returned suffer from effects similar to those that may be seen after severe [[concussion]], such as disorientation, sleep disturbance, and wandering.  Former professionals among the returned are moved to menial jobs when it becomes clear that, although they can perform rote tasks, they can no longer engage in spontaneous problem solving or planning, and that even their apparent consciousness may be an illusion. This behaviour adds to the growing sentiment that the returned are different from their former selves. However, while the returned generally function sluggishly during the day, a doctor named Gardet ([[Frédéric Pierrot]]) has become suspicious of the returned after observing some of them clandestinely attending animated meetings, conducted in the middle of the night, during which their symptoms seem to disappear.  Nonetheless, the returned reunite with their former loved ones: the mayor's wife, Martha ([[Catherine Samie]]), with the mayor; a  6-year-old boy, Sylvain (Saady Delas), with his parents, Isham (Djemel Barek) and Véronique (Marie Matheron); a young man, Mathieu ([[Jonathan Zaccaï]]), with his wife, Rachel ([[Géraldine Pailhas]]). Rachel is initially reluctant to see Mathieu, until one day he follows her home, acting as though he never left. Rachel eventually accepts him, and the two make love. In addition to the nocturnal meetings of the returned, Gardet also observes the gradual reunion of Rachel and Mathieu with growing concern, but when he tries to warn her of possible danger, Rachel rebuffs him.  One evening a series of explosions tears through the town, apparently detonated by the returned in an act of mass sabotage but without inflicting any casualties.  In the chaos, the returned head for a network of underground tunnels. The mayor attempts to stop his wife from leaving with the rest but begins to feel ill and, after Martha urges him to "give in", apparently dies, only to appear later in the tunnels among the returned. The military responds by gassing the returned with a chemical that induces a permanent coma.  After guiding some of the returned to the tunnels, Mathieu makes his way back to Rachel, and recounts to her the events leading to his fatal car accident. He reveals that he crashed the car while looking for her after the two had fought. Rachel follows him into the tunnels, tearfully kissing him before he disappears into the darkness. She returns to the surface and observes the military carting away the comatose bodies. The bodies are laid atop their graves in the cemetery and slowly vanish.

Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger The Movie: Full Blast Action
 The Dekarangers encounter the Algolian Gas Drinkers following a high-speed pursuit, and while the Alienizer gang manages to retreat, Deka Break recovers a briefcase that they were carrying. Inside the briefcase is a top-secret virus called "Golden Snow", which was being experimented on the planet Leslie. As communications to Leslie have failed, Tetsu is assigned to travel to the planet to investigate while the other Dekarangers scout around for leads on the Gas Drinkers' whereabouts. Ban and Jasmine enter a nightclub, where Ban meets Marie Gold, a beautiful singer with the ability to temporarily stop time. She also reveals herself as an undercover SPD officer from Leslie. It is revealed that the Gas Drinkers released the Golden Snow virus on Leslie, turning the planet's population into machine slaves. Marie is the only survivor, as she was on patrol duty outside the planet. The gang's intention was to infect planets with the virus before selling the vaccine to them for a high price with the help of Agent Abrella; however, their plans were complicated by the Dekarangers' intervention upon their arrival on Earth.  Later, Marie uses her time-stopping power to steal the virus from Swan's laboratory, as she had made a deal with the Gas Drinkers to exchange it for the vaccine to save her planet. After Jasmine uses her ESPer abilities to track Marie's whereabouts, the Dekarangers head to an abandoned warehouse outside town to stop the exchange from happening. While Ban confronts Marie over her sense of justice, the Gas Drinkers' leader Volger injects her with the full dose of the virus, telling the Dekarangers that she will fall violently ill and spread it all over Earth in an hour unless they pay 10 billion for the vaccine. Marie pleads to Ban to kill her in order to prevent the virus from spreading, but he promises to recover the vaccine and save her. After Murphy takes Marie back to Deka Base, the Dekarangers have the Gas Drinkers approved for deletion. Deka Blue destroys Whinsky, while Deka Yellow and Deka Pink eliminate Zeen and Deka Green takes down Brandell.

However, Volger recovers and teleports to Leslie to prepare his machine slaves for an invasion of Earth. Dekaranger Robo arrives on Leslie to stop Volger, but is pummeled by his Kaijuki Killer Tank.

One day she decides to drive to her favourite boutique to return a coat and dress. After she has returned the clothes initially Eiko feels a sense of release but, whilst waiting at traffic lights, she begins to think about their colour, style, and texture.

Toolbox Murders
 Daisy Rain goes to her apartment in the Lusman Arms, a former luxury hotel undergoing renovations, and is beaten to death with a hammer by a man wearing a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]]. In another room, new tenants Nell and Steven Barrows, a teacher, and a [[Internship (medicine)|medical intern]] are introduced to the [[Amenity|amenities]] and a few of the residents by Byron, the building manager. As Steven works long hours, Nell is left alone most of the time, and befriends Julia Cunningham, a neighbor down the hall, and Chas Rooker, an elderly man who reveals some of the history of the structure, mentioning it was made by Jack Lusman, who disappeared mysteriously, and that builders died while working on it.  As days pass, the Lusman Arms are plagued by mysterious circumstance; strange noises are heard throughout it and coming from the [[intercom]]s, Nell finds a trinket containing human teeth in a wall, and Julia and another tenant vanish, having been killed (with a drill and a [[nail gun]], respectively) by the ski-masked murderer, who hides their bodies. While looking into Julia's disappearance, Nell speaks with Chas, who offers cryptic warnings about the nature of the building, and sneaks Nell a note reading "Look for her in Room 504". Nell takes the advice and discovers that there is no Room 504 and that all the other floors lack apartments whose numbering should end with 4.  Nell goes to the Los Angeles Preservation Society, where an employee tells her that Jack Lusman was an occultist who associated with a society that tried to mix science and magic and that the symbols (which Nell copies down on her arms) decorating the building are part of a spell. The [[blueprint]]s for the Lusman Arms also reveal that there is a [[townhouse]] hidden within the structure, hence all the missing rooms. Nell returns home and finds a hatch on the roof of the building that allows entrance into the townhouse, where she uncovers a room dedicated to the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of Hollywood]], torture chambers, and dozens of corpses. The killer, who had just butchered another tenant and the [[handyman]], appears, and removes his mask to reveal that he is a monster, which the credits refer to as "Coffin Baby."  A teenage resident discovers that the [[webcam]] he had been using to spy on Julia had recorded her death, prompting him to go to Steven, who finds Nell's notes about the building, and goes looking for her along with the boy, Byron, and the [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]]. The men send the teen to get the police after they find a passageway into Coffin Baby's lair, which they enter. Coffin Baby kills Byron and the doorman, and gives chase to Nell and Steven, the former of whom theorizes that Coffin Baby needs death and the Lusman Arms to continue existing. The Barrows are found by Chas, who tries to lead them to safety, and murmurs that Coffin Baby came into the world when he clawed his way out of his dead and buried mother's womb.  Coffin Baby leaps out from under a pile of human remains, fatally throws Chas at a wall, and captures Nell, but she is saved by Steven, who bludgeons Coffin Baby, and knocks a shelf onto him. The authorities arrive and take Steven to a hospital, and as Nell returns to her apartment, the police lift up the debris that fell on Coffin Baby, who has disappeared. Coffin Baby crashes through Nell's window and tries to kill her, but is disoriented by the [[runes]] she had earlier drawn on her arms, distracting him long enough for a pair of police officers to barge in, and shoot him out a window, causing him to be hanged by a cord Nell had wrapped around his neck. The officers check on Nell, then go to the window, only to find that Coffin Baby has once again vanished.

One of his companions, Juan, kills one with a pickax, and the pair escapes.  Inexperienced and not fond of firearms, Hiram calls for a gunfighter, Black Hand Kelly (Billy Drago). Hiram and Kelly do not get along well, though Kelly succeeds in conveying to Hiram some of his attitude towards firearms and life in general. Eventually, Kelly is eaten alive, but not before discovering that a total of four graboids have hatched. Hiram decides to abandon Rejection and leave the townsfolk to their fates. However, they force him to give them the silver mine, threatening to alert potential buyers to the danger if he sells it out from under them. In [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], Hiram receives a [[telegram]] revealing that the fully grown graboids have made it through the pass and are headed for the town. Changing his mind, he buys weapons, heads back to Rejection to lead a last stand against the graboids, and helps the town ready itself.  After two graboids are killed, the third one adapts and avoids all of the traps. Hiram tricks it into coming to the surface and then attaches it by the tail to the wheel of a steam [[traction engine]]. The graboid is reeled in and slammed against the wheel with such force that it is explosively decapitated on impact.

Hiram settles in Rejection, building his home in the same place where his great-grandson Burt's would one day be. He is also given a Colt 1865 [[Gatling gun]] and begins target practice, enjoying it.

Its technology had enabled mankind to colonize Mars in the first place,<ref name="adventure">[http://www.adventure-treff.de/artikel/tests.php?id=63 "(T)Raumschiff Surprise: Periode 1"] Adventure Treff. (August 30, 2004) Retrieved November 23, 2010 </ref> hence its destruction would prevent the attack 300 years later. (A similar theme appears in the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'']] movie series.)  At first, Captain Kork is very reluctant to follow the order to return to Earth immediately (because he, Spuck and Schrotty intend to try out for a 'Miss Waikiki' contest),<ref name="adventure" /> but ultimately, he changes his mind. Technical problems ("damage done by martens") prevent direct transport, however, so Kork orders Schrotty to call a space taxi. The taxi is driven by Rock (played by [[Til Schweiger]]), who is found attractive by both Kork and Spuck. Rock manages to break through the Martian blockade, but during the action, the taxi is chased and damaged heavily, finally crashing beside the Queen's palace. Kork, Spuck and Schrotty are advised on their mission and are then seated into the [[time travel|time machine]], which looks like an old sofa. When the Regulator's forces attack the capital city, Rock and Metapha join Kork and Spucky "in" the device, while Schrotty remains behind. Jens Maul acquires the time machine's manual, builds his own and follows the foursome back in time.  Under constant harassment by Jens Maul, the travellers have a couple of unplanned sojourns. In 1304 Britain, they are forced to participate in a tournament held by Lord William the Last ([[Sky du Mont]]), then in Nevada during the [[Wild West]] era, they run afoul of Santa Maria (du Mont in a reprisal of his role in ''[[Der Schuh des Manitu]]''). Upon arrival in the West, the time sofa is smashed by a speeding train, but the group captures Maul's time machine and uses it to reach the year 2004. Once more, they encounter Maul, who has painstakingly reassembled the ruined time sofa, and witness the UFO (which turns out to be no bigger than a football) crashing. A beer-guzzling alien the size of a human hand emerges and, in its haste to consume more alcohol, it begins to choke. Spucky tries to help by offering Maul's asthma spray, but the pressure created by the device blows up the creature. The group obliterates the UFO and scrambles onto the sofa, just as the local military arrives. The control panel shows an overload of 76.375 kilograms – Spucky's exact weight. With a heavy heart, Spucky remains behind.  The story switches back to Area 51, where Spuck has just finished telling his tale. The government officials are not convinced until Spuck provides proof in the form of a futuristic piece of technology, a thermometer with a vibrating alarm, which he had inserted just before departure. As Kork, Rock and Metapha get back to the future, Spuck is already awaiting them. Spuck has survived because he's a Vulcanette, who have extraordinarily long lifespans, and has been busy re-decorating Earth within the last 300 years (it is now all in pink). Kork and his men get to participate in the Miss Waikiki contest after all - but the ever-relentless Jens Maul has the last word.

Troy (film)
 In the late 12th Century BC, a battle between the armies of King [[Agamemnon]] of [[Mycenae]] and [[Triopas]] of [[Thessaly]] is averted when the great warrior, [[Achilles]], defeats Thessaly's champion in single combat. Meanwhile, Prince [[Hector]] of [[Troy]] and his younger brother [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] negotiate a peace treaty with [[Menelaus]], King of [[Sparta]]. However, Paris is having an affair with Menelaus' wife, Queen [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], and smuggles her aboard their home-bound vessel. Upon learning of this, Menelaus meets with Agamemnon, his elder brother, and asks him to help take Troy. Agamemnon agrees, as conquering Troy will give him control of the [[Aegean Sea]]. Agamemnon has [[Odysseus]], King of [[Ithaca]], persuade Achilles to join them. Achilles, who strongly dislikes Agamemnon, eventually decides to go after his mother [[Thetis]] tells him that though he will die, he will be forever glorified.  In Troy, King [[Priam]] is dismayed when Hector and Paris introduce Helen, but welcomes her and decides to prepare for war. The Greeks eventually invade and take the Trojan beach, thanks largely to Achilles and his [[Myrmidons]]. Achilles has the temple of [[Apollo]] sacked, and claims [[Briseis]] — a priestess and the cousin of Paris and Hector — as a prisoner. He is angered when Agamemnon spitefully takes her from him, and decides that he will not aid Agamemnon in the siege.  The Trojan and Greek armies meet outside the walls of Troy; during a parley, Paris offers to duel Menelaus personally for Helen's hand in exchange for the city being spared. Agamemnon, intending to take the city regardless of the outcome, accepts. Menelaus wounds Paris and almost kills him, but is himself killed by Hector. In the ensuing battle, Hector kills [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] and many Greek soldiers fall to the Trojan defenses. On Odysseus' insistence, Agamemnon gives the order to fall back. He gives Briseis to the Greek soldiers for their amusement, but Achilles saves her. Later that night, Briseis sneaks into Achilles' quarters to kill him; instead, she falls for him and they become lovers. Achilles then resolves to leave Troy, much to the dismay of [[Patroclus]], his cousin and protégé.  Despite Hector's objections, Priam orders him to retake the Trojan beach and force the Greeks home; the attack unifies the Greeks and the Myrmidons enter the battle. Hector duels a man he believes to be Achilles and kills him, only to discover it was actually Patroclus. Distraught, the armies agree to stop fighting for the day. Achilles is informed of his cousin's death and vows revenge. Wary of Achilles, Hector shows his wife [[Andromache]] a secret tunnel beneath Troy; should he die and the city fall, he instructs her to take their child and any survivors out of the city to [[Mount Ida (Turkey)|Mount Ida]].  The next day, Achilles arrives outside Troy and challenges Hector; the two duel until Hector is killed, and Achilles drags his corpse back to the Trojan beach. Priam, in disguise, sneaks into the camp and implores Achilles to return Hector's body for a proper funeral. Ashamed of his actions, Achilles agrees and allows Briseis to return to Troy with Priam, promising a twelve day truce so that Hector's funeral rites may be held in peace. He also orders his men to return home without him.  Agamemnon declares that he will take Troy regardless of the cost. Concerned, Odysseus concocts a plan to infiltrate the city: he has the Greeks build a [[Trojan Horse|gigantic wooden horse]] as a peace offering and abandon the Trojan beach, hiding their ships in a nearby cove. Priam orders the horse be brought into the city. That night, Greeks hiding inside the horse emerge and open the city gates for the Greek army, commencing the [[Sack of Troy]]. While Andromache and Helen guide the Trojans to safety through the tunnel, Paris gives the Sword of Troy to [[Aeneas]], instructing him to protect the Trojans and find them a new home. Agamemnon kills Priam and captures Briseis, who then kills Agamemnon. Achilles fights his way through the city and reunites with Briseis. Paris, seeking to avenge his brother, shoots an arrow through [[Achilles' heel]] and then several into his body. Achilles bids farewell to Briseis, and watches her flee with Paris before dying.   In the aftermath, Troy is finally taken and a funeral is held for Achilles, where Odysseus personally cremates his body.  
Twisted (2004 film)
 Having solved a high-profile case involving [[serial killer]] Edmund Cutler that ended with her being taken hostage by Cutler but managing to overpower and arrest him regardless, Jessica Shepard ([[Ashley Judd]]) is a rising officer in the [[San Francisco Police Department]]. She is transferred to the homicide division and promoted to the rank of [[Inspector#Municipal police|inspector]]. Her deceased father's former partner, SFPD Chief John Mills ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]), her foster father, also serves as her proud mentor. Shepard finds that she might once again have to prove herself in a department that takes no prisoners. In addition, Shepard's parents were both killed in the 1970s when she was young as a result of her father murdering her mother's extra-marital lovers then himself and Shepard's mother, an event which scarred her in the past and caused Mills to foster her.   When Bob Sherman, a minor criminal and one of Shepard's former one-night stands is brutally murdered, Shepard and her new partner, Mike Delmarco ([[Andy García]]), are assigned to the case. Shepard, who has a drinking problem, admits that she had slept with Sherman but remains assigned to the case. A few days later however, Lawrence Gebler, another of Shepard's one-night stands is murdered and soon the police come to the conclusion that the killer is stalking Shepard. At Mills' insistence, Shepard remains on the case so as to bait out the killer.   As investigations progress, Shepard keeps having alcoholic blackouts at night, having already had them on the nights when Sherman and Gebler were killed. She confides in these blackouts and her increasing doubts about her mental health to her police psychiatrist, Dr Melvin Frank who was assigned to review her mental state following the Cutler arrest. She also confides this to Mills, who encourages her to carry on.   Shepard discovers a third murder, that of Cutler's defense attorney Ray Porter ([[D.W. Moffett]]) who was also a former lover of Shepard and had summoned her via note to meet him that morning. As a result, Shepard comes under more suspicion for the crimes, particularly from rival Inspector Dale Becker ([[Titus Welliver]]), due to Shepard's relationship with the victims and her occasional flashes of violent behaviour in the line of police duty. Shepard begins to fear that she is becoming like her father and committing similar murders, especially after a fourth murder takes place, SFPD Officer Jimmy Schmidt ([[Mark Pellegrino]]) who was another former lover who also had been stalking Shepard, and Shepard wakes up with Schmidt's corpse in her bed. In each case, the murder seems to have been committed using a [[yawara]]. Early in the film, there is a scene where Shepard is training in delivering blows with a yawara that appear similar to the blows used to kill the victims. Shepard is arrested and questioned for the murders but is bailed by Mills after blood work evidence undertaken by pathologist Lisa ([[Camryn Manheim]]) reveals that Shepard's blood had strong amounts of [[rohypnol]], a date rape drug, in it which means she was incapacitated during the murders and thus cannot have committed them.  Mills tells Shepard that he suspects Delmarco of being the killer, Delmarco having grown increasingly close to Shepard during the course of the investigation. The two turn up at Delmarco's quayside home to question him where Mills serves Delmarco wine laced with rohypnol to incapacitate him, upon which Shepard realises that Mills is the true killer based on how he says they're now "in this together" and how he sets up the scene to look as if Delmarco will commit suicide, akin to how her father had looked when he supposedly committed suicide. Mills admits he killed all of Shepard's lovers, as well as her parents and her mother's lovers, because he considered it his mission to prevent her growing up to be a dissolute woman like her mother. As her father's partner, Mills had felt the responsibility to inform him that his wife was a [[nymphomania]]c, which drove him insane. Furthermore, as he himself had an illicit affair with Shepard's mother, Mills felt the need to kill her lovers, ashamed that he helped destroy his partner's marriage and drove him insane. Mills then decided to put him out of his misery by killing him.  Shepard secretly transmits Mills's confession to other police officers on a mobile phone, allowing her old partner Wilson ([[Richard T. Jones]]) to track them down. When Mills tries to shoot her and Delmarco, Shepard shoots him in the chest, killing him and causing him to fall off a dock into the water. The film closes on Mills's corpse drifting on the water's surface surrounded by sea lions as the cops look on.

He is the dynamic, but [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] leader of the children, organizing the dangerous but necessary sweeping and clearing of the [[land mine|minefields]]. Many of these children are injured one way or the other, yet still maintain a boisterous prattle whenever possible, devoted to their work in spite of the vagaries of their life.  The industrious Satellite arranges trade-ins for undetonated mines. He falls for an orphan named Agrin, assisting her whenever possible in order to win her over. She is a perpetual dour-faced girl who is part bitter, part lost in thought, unable to escape the demons of the past. Traveling with her is her disabled, but very caring brother Hengov, who appears to have the gift of [[clairvoyance]], though he seems to have a bad reputation for it. The siblings stay with a blind toddler named Riga. It is revealed that Agrin gave birth to Riga after she was [[gang rape]]d by soldiers, while Hengov's arms had been shot as the soldiers attempted to drown both children. Agrin is unable to accept Riga as anything besides a taint, a continuous reminder of her brutal past.  Agrin tries to abandon the child on multiple occasions, until finally she ties him to a rock and throws him to the bottom of the lake, afterwards committing suicide herself by jumping from a cliff. When her brother sees a vision of his loved ones drowning, he hurries out of the tent to save them, but he is too late. Hengov eventually finds his nephew's body at the bottom of the lake but can't cut it loose from the rock due to his disability. Hengov grieves on the cliff from where Agrin jumped to her death. Meanwhile, a disabled Satellite loses any charm he had about the American intervention and looks away when the American soldiers finally pass by him.

Two Brothers (2004 film)
  Set in [[Cambodia]] during the 1920s during [[Union of French Indochina|French colonial rule]], two [[tiger]]s, male and female, meet and mate. Months later, the tiger couple have given birth to two tiger cubs, who would one day get separated after the ancient temple where they live is disturbed by Aidan McRory ([[Guy Pearce]]), who intends to steal and sell the ancient statues at an auction in [[London]].  While the two tiger cubs are playing one of them (later named Sangha) comes upon a young [[civet]]. Sangha chases the civet into its burrow and the mother civet appears and chases Sangha up a tree. The other tiger cub (later named Kumal) appears and chases the mother civet back into her burrow. Eventually, humans come across them in their temple home and the tigress arrives to protect the cubs. She picks Sangha up and runs for safety. Kumal follows, but can't keep up and falls behind. The cubs' father appears, but the men have caught up with them and he is shot dead by McRory when attacking a hunter, who might have harmed his cub, as protection.  McRory is an unscrupulous but kind explorer, big-game hunter, and temple looter. He discovers Kumal and befriends him after having shot his father, but McRory is arrested later on for stealing sacred statues from the ancient temple and Kumal is kept by the chief in the Cambodian village where McRory had been staying. The chief then sells Kumal to a circus owned by circus ringmaster Zerbino, his wife, and his faithful sabre swallowing and fire breathing friend Saladin where he is to be the star attraction.  McRory is soon released from prison by the French administrator, Eugene Normandin, due to being a big fan of McRory and all his exploits, but is not permitted to leave the country until all the formalities are completed within the three years sentencing. Nevertheless, McRory is permitted to stay at Eugene's home and is introduced to Eugene's wife, Mathilda who admires McRory and reads all his books as bedtime stories to their son, Raoul ([[Freddie Highmore]]).  Meanwhile, Sangha remains in the jungle with his mother, but both are soon trapped by McRory as game for a vain [[Khmer people|Khmer]] prince to hunt. The mother is shot in the left ear and thought to be dead before she jumps up and runs off with a hole in her left ear after being startled by the flash of a camera. Sangha is then discovered by young Raoul and becomes the child's pet. However, Raoul's mother's dog, Bittsi, a [[schipperke]], is a constant antagonist to the young tiger.  Kumal remains in a cage of the circus next to the cage of an old former tiger star named Caesar. In order to bring back the skin of the tigress for the prince, McRory makes a deal with Zerbino and Saladin to kill Caesar and skin him, thus, to pass off as the dead skinned tigress itself. Kumal is then replaced as the soon-to-be new star attraction of the circus in Caesar's cage with McRory's condition that the circus people take good care of him. However, the tiger skin trick is foiled when the prince's wife discovers the hole through the wrong ear; much to the prince's disappointment.  Sangha meanwhile dwells peacefully with Raoul until he is at last cornered by Bittsi following a prolonged chase. In self-defense, Sangha attacks Bittsi, badly wounding although not killing him. This provokes a hysterical reaction from the household, particularly Raoul's mother, who insists that the cub has now "got a taste of blood" and Sangha is given away. As a result, he is made a part of the prince's palace menagerie, where he quickly gains a reputation as a ferocious animal.  A year later, Kumal (now an adult tiger) is trained by Zerbino to do tricks, such as jumping through a flaming hoop after refusing to obey him and having been "taught a lesson in manners" by Saladin using harsh and cruel methods. Then, the prince decides to hold a festival in which a battle between two great beasts will be the centerpiece. Raoul underestands that the prince's tiger is actually Sangha (now an adult tiger as well) even before seeing him in the cage where the fight is to take place, despite his parents having made him believe that Sangha had been taken to a zoo in [[Bangkok]] or [[Saigon]]. McRory, however, is not pleased with the idea of Kumal being the opponent for the prince's ferocious animal (not knowing that it's Kumal's brother either) since the circus people didn't keep their promise to take care of him, so he leaves the festival with the village chief's beautiful daughter, Naï-Rea, whom he's in love with. Later, when placed in the cage before the audience during the festival, the two brothers do not immediately recognize each other, and Kumal is afraid to fight. However, when the brothers finally recognize each other after a horrible fierce fight, they begin to play together like they used to instead of fighting which amuses the audience. The trainers see this and attempts to antagonize the tigers into fighting resulting in Saladin being attacked suddenly by Sangha, biting viciously into his arm. Zerbino opens the gate and retrieves a gun to shoot Sangha, accidentally leaving the gate open. Kumal stops Zerbino from shooting his brother by jumping from behind and attacking him as well. The tigers escape through the open gate, causing panic among everyone in the arena.  After their escape, the two tigers cause havoc to people in the area, such as: eating people's food on a bus, bathing in a woman's home, scaring a person next to a News Stand, scaring people crossing a bridge, and eating meat in a butcher's truck. McRory is determined to hunt the tigers down. After Kumal shows Sangha how to jump through fire (which McRory and the villagers started in order to frighten them and finally have them cornered together to have a perfect shot of them) to escape, McRory and Raoul eventually find them. Raoul asks Sangha to promise him to never return to the villages of men and to stay in the jungle forever, to avoid being hunted. He kisses Sangha, and removes the diamond necklace (formerly offered to the prince's wife as a gift) placed on the tiger's neck by the prince when he was in captivity. McRory watches from the distance and takes aim at Sangha, but Kumal appears behind him: McRory puts down his gun, and Kumal demonstrates that he remembers the honey sweets McRory used to give him as a cub: unfortunately there is no more sweets left: McRory asking Kumal to forgive him, and the tigers make their way back to their temple home in the jungle. McRory states that they are taking a big risk, but Raoul justifies that sometimes it's good to take a few risks, which McRory agrees to as well. Raoul and McRory watch them go hoping the two brothers will find another tiger who might teach them how to hunt in the wild:  In fact in the jungle Sangha and Kumal reunite with their mother, who is identified by the hole in her left ear. All three tigers rest in the jungle, by the stream. Just before the credits, some comments to save tigers (as a species) are shown.

Ushpizin
 Moshe and Mali Bellanga are an impoverished, childless, [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] ''[[baal teshuva|baalei teshuva]]'' ("returnees to Judaism") couple in the [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]] community in [[Jerusalem]]. After Moshe is passed over for a stipend he expected, they cannot pay their bills, much less prepare for the upcoming Jewish holiday of [[Sukkot]].  Moshe admires a particularly beautiful ''[[etrog]]'', or [[citron]], one of the [[four species]] required for the holiday observance. They console themselves by recalling a saying of [[Rabbi Nachman of Breslov]] that difficult times are a test of faith. After some anguished prayer, they receive an unexpected monetary gift on the eve of the holiday<ref>[http://www.fandango.com/ushpizin_v323962/summary Ushpizin Synopsis – Plot Summary]. Fandango.com (19 October 2005).</ref> and Moshe buys the etrog for 1000 [[Israeli new sheqel|shekels]] (approx. $300), a large sum of money that is much more than he can afford.  The couple is visited by a pair of escaped convicts, one of whom knew Moshe in his earlier, non-religious life. The convicts become their guests (''[[Sukkot#Ushpizzin|ushpizin]]'') in the [[sukkah]], creating many conflicts and straining Moshe and Mali's relationship.

Tsubaki comes to have his script checked by the censors before rehearsals begin. But the censor, who is looking for an excuse to shut down the comedy troupe at which Tsubaki works, tells him that his whole play is rubbish and Tsubaki would have to rewrite it completely before Sakisaka would let it be performed.  But what starts as cruel teasing makes the once poor-quality play better and better as Tsubaki returns day after day to have it torn to shreds and criticized over and over again. Finally the play is perfected and Sakisaka's dislike of Tsubaki turns into respect for his talent.

Up for Grabs (film)
 The ball happened to be the one hit by [[San Francisco Giants]] slugger Barry Bonds for his record-setting 73rd home run at the end of the 2001 MLB season.  When the ball landed in the right-field bleachers at what was then [[Pac Bell Park]] (San Francisco), there was a mad scramble for the precious ball, bodies piled up on the walkway above [[McCovey Cove]]. Patrick Hayashi, who stood quietly with a sheepish grin on his face as the scrum continued, eventually held the historic ball up for a TV camera to reveal that he had possession of it. MLB and Giants security grabbed Mr. Hayashi and escorted him down to the bowels of the ballpark and authenticated his baseball as the true #73.  As Hayashi prepared to be the next Bay Area millionaire, a man named Alex Popov, owner of Smart Alec's restaurant in [[Berkeley, California]], was complaining loudly that he had caught the ball on the fly and that Patrick had stolen the ball from him at the bottom of the pile. Video footage shot by [[KNTV]] news cameraman Josh Keppel did actually show the ball land in Popov's glove, providing the key evidence that led to a trial in [[San Francisco County Superior Court|San Francisco Superior Court]].  While the 88-minute film does tell the story from the moment the ball leaves Barry Bonds' bat all the way through the trial and to the dramatic auction where the ball was finally sold to the highest bidder, the film is more of a satire than a serious examination of what actually happened and who ultimately deserved the ball. Inspired by the mockumentary films of [[Christopher Guest]] (''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]]'', etc.), ''Up for Grabs'' focuses on the characters involved rather than the event itself.

While there she begins a campaign to charm Amelia's awkward and overweight brother "Jos" Sedley, a wealthy trader living in [[India]]. Jos grows very smitten with Becky and comes close to proposing marriage to her, but is dissuaded by Amelia's snobbish fiancé George Osborne, who reminds him of Becky's low birth and poverty.  Having failed in her efforts to find a rich husband, Becky travels to take up her post. She is horrified by the dilapidated house and her lecherous new employer Sir Pitt, but applies herself diligently to teaching his two young daughters and improving the house in preparation for the visit of Sir Pitt's half-sister Miss Crawley. Accompanying her is Sir Pitt's youngest son, Rawdon Crawley, a roguish army captain, who immediately takes a fancy to Becky. Becky manages to ingratiate herself to the crotchety Miss Crawley, so much so that she invites Becky to come and live with her as a companion in London.  Meanwhile, Amelia's prospective father-in-law, Mr. Osborne, is trying to arrange a more advantageous marriage for his son George. When George refuses to countenance marrying his father's candidate, Mr. Osborne calls in the debts which Mr. Sedley owes to him, bankrupting the family and obliging George to break the engagement to Amelia. Amelia, now living in squalor with her family, remains hopeful that George will come for her, deluding herself when she receives the gift of a piano from George's loyal friend Dobbin into thinking that it is from George himself.  Becky seduces Rawdon Crawley and the two marry secretly, though they are soon exposed to Miss Crawley, who expels Becky from her house in anger and disinherits Rawdon. George Osborne marries Amelia in rebellion against his father, and is soon after deployed with Dobbin and Rawdon to [[Belgium]] as part of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]'s army, because [[Napoleon]] has escaped Elba and invaded France. Becky and Amelia decide to accompany their husbands. The newly-wedded Osborne has already grown tired of Amelia, and he begins to make romantic assignations to Becky. The lavish ball the group are attending is interrupted by an announcement that Napoleon has attacked, and the army will march in three hours. Before he leaves, Rawdon gives Becky all the money he's won at cards and the next day Becky tries to flee the city. However, when she sees Amelia in the fleeing mob, she leaves her carriage to take Amelia back to Brussels, where they wait out the battle.  In the ensuing [[Battle of Waterloo]], George is killed and Rawdon survives. Amelia bears him a posthumous son, who is also named George. Mr. Osborne refuses to acknowledge his grandson. So Amelia returns to live in genteel poverty with her parents. Now-Major William Dobbin, who is young George's godfather, begins to express his love for the widowed Amelia by small kindnesses. Amelia is too much in love with George's memory to return Dobbin's affections. Saddened, he transfers to an army post in India. Meanwhile, Becky also has a son, also named after his father.  Several years pass. Rawdon has been passed over for inheritance by both his aunt and father, and the couple are sinking deep into debt. Amelia herself struggles to raise her son and reluctantly gives him up to be raised by his grandfather Mr. Osborne, because of the fine education and lifestyle he can provide. When bailiffs arrive to repossess the Crawley's household furniture, Becky is saved by her neighbor Lord Steyne, a man she remembers from the past as a keen buyer of her father's paintings. Lord Steyne becomes her patron, giving her money and introducing her into the exclusive world of London high society.  On the night of her triumphant presentation to the King of England, [[George IV]], Becky receives word that Rawdon has been arrested and thrown into debtors' prison. Lord Steyne insists that she spend the night with him in return for all the services he has rendered her, and Rawdon, after being bailed out by his sister-in-law, walks in on Steyne forcing himself upon Becky. He throws Steyne out and realizes that Becky has been taking money  for months in secret without sharing with him. He leaves Becky and entrusts the care of his son to his older brother, the new Sir Pitt and his wife.  Twelve years later, Becky is working as a card dealer at a casino in [[Baden-Baden]], Germany. It is revealed that Rawdon died from [[malaria]] soon after leaving Becky, when he was posted to a tropical island under the malign influence of Lord Steyne. By chance Becky encounters the now grown son of Amelia, George Jr., who invites her to meet his mother for tea. Mr. Osborne finally accepted Amelia at the end of his life, and left her and George Jr. a large inheritance. Becky confronts Amelia over her obsession with the late George, showing her a love note given to her many years earlier by him. She urges Amelia to love Dobbin, who has remained her loyal friend for many years. Although at first angered, Amelia realizes her mistake and declares her love to Dobbin.  Alone again in the casino, Becky meets Jos Sedley, who has come to Germany after being informed by Amelia that Becky was there. He invites her to come and live in India with him, and she delightedly accepts. The two depart to make a new life for themselves.  
Vasool Raja MBBS
 Rajaraman, nicknamed "Vasool Raja" ([[Kamal Haasan]]), is a local don in [[Chennai]], making a living by collecting money from people who refuse or dilly-dally in paying their debts to others, with the help of his right hand man Vaddi ([[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]]). Given that his father had wished him to be a doctor, he creates the [[wikt:faux|faux]] Venkataraman Charitable Hospital. which is named after his father and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father Sriman Venkataraman ([[Nagesh (actor)|Nagesh]]) and mother Kasturi ([[Rohini Hattangadi]]) visit him in Chennai.  One year later, Raja's plan goes awry when Sriman meets an old acquaintance Dr. Vishwanathan ([[Prakash Raj]]), and the two men decide to get Raja married to Vishwanathan's daughter Dr. Janaki aka "Paapu" ([[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]]), who was a childhood friend of Raja under that name. At this point, the truth about Raja is revealed. Vishwanathan insults Raja's parents and calls them "fools" for being ignorant of Raja's real life. Sriman and Kasturi, who are both aghast and heartbroken, leave Raja for their village.  Raja, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Vishwanathan is to become a doctor. He goes to a medical college to obtain an [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery#India|M.B.B.S.]] degree, the graduate medical degree in [[South Asia]].  With the help of Vaddi and others, Raja gains admission to the SLR Institute of Medical Sciences by threatening Dr. Margabandhu ([[Crazy Mohan]]), who is a faculty member of the college, where he again encounters Vishwanathan, who is the college dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the coerced help of Margabandhu. While Raja's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the "Kattipudi Vaithiyam" ("hugging therapy"), a method of comfort taught to Raja by his mother, , and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Raja constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; intimidating Dr. Kalidas ([[Chitra Lakshmanan]]) into admitting and treating a suicide patient Neelakandan ([[Nithin Sathya]]); interacting on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliating school bullies; effusively thanking a hitherto-underappreciated cleaner; helping a terminally ill cancer patient Zakir ([[Jayasurya]]); and encouraging the patients themselves to make changes in their lives so that they do not need pharmaceuticals or surgery.  Vishwanathan, who perceives all this as symptoms of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]], is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irritable, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-[[dementia]] is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behavior is explained early on as an attempt to practice [[laughter therapy]], an attempt that seems to have backfired. Vishwanathan's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, Janaki becomes increasingly fond of Raja, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Raja is unaware that Janaki and his childhood friend "Paapu" are one and the same; an ignorance that Janaki hilariously exploits. Vishwanathan tries several times to expel Raja, but is often thwarted by Raja's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Raja, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods.  Eventually, Raja is shamed into leaving the college: His [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for not being able to help Zakir gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Raja's departure, the bedridden man miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point, Janaki gives a heartfelt speech where in she criticizes her father for having banished Raja, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness, etc. from the college. Vishwanathan eventually realizes his folly.  Raja later marries Janaki, learning for the first time that she is "Paapu", while reconciling with his parents.

Bhadranna approaches him with the marriage proposal, and Ranga Rao jumps on that and immediately agrees. Later, a film producer approaches him with an offer for Shailaja to act in a movie.

To save their names, Devanathan places Guna's photo inside Abirami's work folder and fabricated her as like his lover. Shakthi is innocently arrested and sentenced for about six months in imprisonment for beating up policemen, who came to question him and Abirami's parents for Guna's whereabouts, while Abirami's parents commit suicide over humiliation of the false fact of Abirami being Guna's lover. Devanathan retires with honors. Prabhakaran was guest visiting the prison that Shakthi was imprisoned in and revealed to him the truth when confronted by Shakthi and apologizes to him over being unable to do anything to reveal the truth, due to the fact that Devanathan was his superior officer and higher official.  Anitha couldn't believe it at first, but Shakthi forcibly took her to the guesthouse that Devanathan brought and showed her him chatting on a escape plan for Guna and his friend, who were hiding in Ooty by Devanthan to escape from the authorities.

Guna and his friend are about to escape to Ooty in a vehicle driven by Devanathan himself to avoid unnecessary checking. Shakthi chases them, and when they are about to cross a check post, he shoots at the car. Guna and his friend mistakenly thought it was police firing, so they came out and start firing, which triggers the actual and real police to come to the spot and kill Devanathan and the criminals in the shootout. Shakthi revealed his identity to Devanathan before he died, while stating that having him killed in the same way Abirami was killed is Shakthi's punishment to him.  At the film's end, Shakthi is seen sitting in a bus leaving Ooty reading an article on a newspaper of Devanathan's death, with Anitha revealing the truth about her father being a criminal to the entire world written in it.

However, his request is denied. Later, his mother Alice ([[Sigourney Weaver]]) scolds him for wanting to visit the neighboring towns, which the villagers describe as wicked. The Elders also appear to have secrets of their own and keep physical mementos hidden in black boxes, the contents of which are reminders of the evil and tragedy they left behind when they left the towns. After Lucius makes a short venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings in the form of splashes of red ("the bad color") paint on all the villagers' doors.  Ivy Elizabeth Walker ([[Bryce Dallas Howard]]), the [[Visual Impairment|blind]] daughter of the chief Elder Edward Walker ([[William Hurt]]), informs Lucius that she has strong feelings for him and he returns her affections.

Noah is locked in a room until a decision is made about his fate.  Edward goes against the wishes of the other Elders, agreeing to let Ivy pass through the forest and seek medicine for Lucius. Before she leaves, Edward explains that the creatures inhabiting the woods are actually members of their own community wearing costumes and have continued the legend of monsters in an effort to frighten and deter others from attempting to leave Covington.

While traveling through the forest, one of the creatures suddenly attacks Ivy. She tricks it into falling into a deep hole to its death. However, the creature is actually Noah wearing one of the costumes found in the room where he had been locked away after stabbing Lucius.   Ivy eventually finds her way to the far edge of the woods, where she encounters a high, ivy-covered fence. After she climbs over the fence, a [[park ranger]] named Kevin ([[Charlie Hofheimer]]) spots Ivy and is shocked to hear that she has come out of the woods.

During her absence, the Elders secretly open their black boxes, each containing mementos from their lives in the outside world, including items related to their past traumas.

Edward points out to Noah's grieving mother that his death will allow them to continue deceiving the rest of the villagers that there are creatures in the woods, and all the Elders take a vote to continue living in the village. Ivy comes in and tells Lucius that she has returned.

She meets Kothala Thevar ([[Pasupathy]]) who is serving a [[life sentence]], for assisting in the murder of 24 people in District of Theni. He tells his version of the story that led to his conviction.  According to him the root cause of the problem is Virumaandi Thevar ([[Kamal Haasan]]), a happy-go-lucky rogue. Virumaandi has a large part of the land in CK Patti, their village, and has very good underground water levels, which is eyed by every other farmer. Virumaandi lost his mother at 4, and was taken to Chennai, and later to Singapore by his dad. But at age of 25 Virumaandi was whipped and exiled back to India. He comes back to live with his only grandmother in CK Patti, and to do agriculture. His support to his Uncle Kothala Thevar in his clash against Nallama Naicker ([[Napoleon (actor)|Napoleon]]) brings about a bonding between the two. Annalakshmi ([[Abhirami]]), the young niece of Thevar falls for Virumaandi. Thevar with an eye on the fertile land owned by Virumaandi does not object to the romance. An assassination attempt on Virumaandi is blamed on Naicker, and in the ensuing peace judgement of villages, Virumaandi gang is humiliated. Virumaandi goes back single to take revenge in the night, and Kothala's gang is forced to save him, where 24 lives are taken. Virumaandi saves all of them by his false testification so that he can marry Annalakshmi. But Kothala refuses to the marriage.

A clash between Virumaandi and Thevar takes places in which 6 henchmen are killed. Then Virumaandi escapes and kills Naicker also. But he is later caught by the police. In the old 26 people-murder case, Virumaandi testifies against Kothala's gang getting them all 15-year sentences, while Virumaandi gets 5-years for that, raping Annalakshmi and then death penalty for 6 people murder case. Here Kothalastops and says "God has given justice, but Virumaandi is still angry".  Angela tries to make Virumaandi talk, but Virumaandi verbally assaults her badly. Finally, Angela says that she is doing PhD against the death penalty, as her father, who got her married to James by great hard work, was forced to kill James to save her from marital abuse. Her father was hanged in the same prison, and then she chooses Law as a career.  After much [[resentment]] and objection, Virumaandi's agrees to turn to tell his version to Angela Kathamuthu. Virumaandi,25, a manual labourer was [[repatriated|sent back to home]] from [[Singapore]] for taking responsibility for his cousin's fault. His only relation was his grandmother ([[S. N. Lakshmi]]), who practises natural farming without artificial fertilisers and deep bore wells. Kothala Thevar had a silent eye on the fertile land owned by Virumaandi, as it had the only underground water availability. He treats Virumaandi as his nephew. Virumaandi falls in love with Annalakshmi after he tames her very stubborn bull at [[Jallikattu]]. That night his grandmother passes away and 2 days later an attempt is made on Virumaandi's life. Annalakshmi finds him and admits him in the hospital to save his life. Gradually she falls in love with him. She teaches him the importance of apology and forgiveness, which are virtues. A clash at the [[Panchayat]] insults Kothala's gang and their need for revenge infuriates Annalakshmi and she asks Virumaandi to apologize to the elders whom he insulted. He goes to apologize single-handedly at night to Naicker's village, but Thevar and his men, thinking he has gone to take revenge, come in groups and hack down innocents to death, despite his pleas. Thevar uses his clout to get out of the murder charge but Virumaandi who was involved in the bloodbath is disturbed because he had to lie in the court to save Thevar and his kin. As part of the penance, he wills all his land for the villagers. Annalakshmi asks him to marry her and leave the village. He marries her at the village temple and goes away in the night with the girl and stays with his aunt whose son he helped. They consummate their marriage that night.  Thevar's men come the next day, when Virumaandi was away and abduct Annalakshmi, taking her home. Kothala and his gang forcibly get her married again, to Thevar's nephew, Kottaichaami. This is to ensure that Annalakshmi's share in property does not go to Virumaandi. Kottaichaami is then asked by Kothala to consummate his marriage immediately by raping Annalakshmi. Unable to tolerate, Annalakshmi commits suicide by hanging. Upon hearing the news, a distraught Virumaandi enters Kothala's house to kill the gang. He takes revenge by hacking Thevar's 4 men, including Kottaichaami, to death, but finds that Kothala Thevar holding his own son upside down on a staircase. Virumaandi places his weapon down and Kothala escapes. Nallama Naicker shelters Virumaandi and sends him off to Chennai. Thevar and his men corner Nallama Naicker to hand over Virumaandi. A melee ensues in which Nallama Naicker is killed. Virumaandi turns up in court, where he finds all evidence is framed against him. He is convicted of having raped Annalakshmi and killing her and later on being the main reason for killing the 4 relatives of Kothala, and also the main accused for the murder of 26 lives in Nallama Naicker's village. He is sentenced to first 6 years in jail, followed by death by hanging.  While leaving the jail, Angela Kathamuthu's cameraman discreetly shoots a conversation between Deputy-Jailer Paykkaman ([[Shanmugarajan]]),  and other jail wardens and convicts to bump off the Jayanth ([[Nassar]]), Chief Jailer. This is because all of them traffic drugs into the prison and this is now under investigation by the Jailor. Paykamman also reveals that Virumaandi never killed anyone, but his chargesheet got him a death sentence. A revolt among the jail staff leads to a jailbreak, as Jayanth being stabbed, and Virumaandi saving the vital evidence and Angela from the deputy jailor and his henchmen. When Virumaandi and Angela are about to leave the jail to outside police, Kothala stabs Virumaandi, proving that Virumaandi was true all the time. Virumaandi then barehandedly kills Kothala and they escape. The riot is stopped and Angela presents the evidence in court. Angela applies for Virumaandi's clemency to the President of India stating that the 6-year prison sentence is enough as he did not commit any other offence, and to release him immediately. Virumaandi, on TV, pleas for a quick judgement, either to reach Annalakshmi by hanging to death (or) to live life as a silent man, seeking retribution.

Looking for work, he finds the local cedar mill was closed down three years prior by its heir, Jay Hamilton ([[Neal McDonough]]), who opened a new casino that now accounts for the majority of revenue for the local area. Hamilton, who was also Vaughn's school friend, invites him to a night of fun at the casino. While checking out the VIP lounge, Vaughn stumbles upon his childhood friend Deni ([[Ashley Scott]]), who is now working as a stripper. Later, he notices the [[craps]] dealer using [[loaded dice]] and demonstrates this to the patrons by placing a bet and calling out the roll before throwing the dice. When the [[Glossary of poker terms#floorman|floorman]] declares no payout, Vaughn instigates a fight. Although he beats down most of the security guards, he is subsequently subdued with a cattle prod and knocked unconscious. The security staff take Vaughn into the basement and Hamilton's right-hand man and head of security Booth ([[Kevin Durand]]) tortures him by cutting his torso with a [[utility knife]] before dumping him on a roadside. He is found by a trucker and hospitalized, but recovers quickly.  Vaughn goes to the sheriff, Stan Watkins ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]), to press charges against the guards, but Sheriff Watkins refuses to allow him to do so because the casino is viewed as too important to the town's economy, stating that because of its position, the casino is considered a "no fly zone". After this, Vaughn also learns that his nephew, Pete ([[Khleo Thomas]]), experimented with [[methamphetamine|crystal meth]], which was sold to his friends by the casino security guards. Infuriated, Vaughn goes to the casino, and using a piece of [[lumber]] as a club, begins destroying casino property, and brutally beats the security guards when they attempt to stop him. Vaughn is apprehended by Sheriff Watkins and his deputies as he is driving away from the scene.  In the ensuing trial, all of Hamilton's security and staff testify against Vaughn. When the judge allows Vaughn to present his defense, he fires his appointed attorney, who is implicitly under Hamilton's employ. After making a civic speech about the town's great former self, Vaughn tells the jury and the rest of the town that if he's cleared of the charges, he will run for sheriff and clean up the town. To further emphasize his plea, Vaughn reveals the grotesque scars on his torso from his being tortured by the casino staff. He is then acquitted and wins the election for sheriff. Upon taking office, he summarily dismisses the entire police force and deputizes his friend, Ray Templeton ([[Johnny Knoxville]]), whom Vaughn feels he can trust, as well as help Vaughn learn about [[narcotics]] (Templeton revealed earlier that he served time in prison after becoming a drug addict).  Vaughn and Templeton find drugs on Booth and they take him into custody. In an attempt to make him reveal information on the town drug operation, they hold him captive in a garage and proceed to strip his truck into pieces in front of him, but he does not talk. Vaughn assigns Templeton to stand watch over his house, as he knows Hamilton will likely target his family. Vaughn himself remains at the sheriff's office to supervise Booth. He is visited by Deni, stopping by under the pretense of bringing him food and reveals that she quit her job as the casino stripper. The two end up spending the night together in the office. The next morning, Watkins and his deputies arrive at the Sheriff's office where they blow up Vaughn's truck and fire upon the building with machine guns. Recognizing his dangerous predicament, Booth pleads for Vaughn to let him out of his cell, prompting Vaughn to use Booth's perilous situation as leverage for information. Booth reveals that the old mill is where the drugs are being produced, but is immediately killed by the indiscriminate fire of the attackers. Vaughn manages to kill all of the attackers with Deni's help.  Vaughn's parents' house is attacked, but Templeton and Vaughn's father are able to dispatch the gunmen. After ensuring their safety, Vaughn heads for the mill where he discovers a meth lab as well as Hamilton, calmly waiting in a control room. Hamilton attempts to kill Vaughn with the mill equipment by dropping him through a trap door, but Vaughn drags Hamilton down with him and the two fall through a chute. Vaughn, whose leg is injured, manages to tend to his injury in a nearby forest before Hamilton attacks him with an axe. The two fight for their lives, with Vaughn ultimately coming out on top by beating Hamilton with a nearby uprooted tree, breaking his leg. Vaughn repeats what Hamilton said to him earlier "You're right, Jay. This does change our relationship. This is my town. You're under arrest." And Hamilton is arrested and taken into custody, with Templeton's assistance, Vaughn shuts down the casino. In the closing scene it is revealed that the local mill is back in use.

Welcome to Mooseport
 Former [[President of the United States]] Monroe "Eagle" Cole [[Retirement|retires]] to his vacation home in the town of Mooseport, [[Maine]] to escape from his ex-wife Charlotte. Harold "Handy" Harrison is a [[commoner]] working as the local plumber of Mooseport, who also owns a hardware store.  Following the death of the town mayor, the [[town council]] decides to approach former president Cole about running for the office. Cole agrees because, as it turns out, if he holds the office, his Mooseport house can serve as his office and, therefore, can no longer be divided up or sold off in his [[divorce]] settlement. As a surprise to Harrison, his name has also been entered into the race. When Harrison finds out Cole is running, he decides to withdraw, until he witnesses Cole make a pass at Handy's girlfriend of six years, veterinarian Dr. Sally Mannis, who recently broke up with him because he was taking the relationship too slow and had not yet proposed marriage to her. Handy believes that, by becoming mayor, he can show Sally he is a mature decision maker and win her heart.  Tempers rise following the arrival of ex-wife and Cole campaign spoiler Charlotte. Cole's team, led by long-time executive secretary and love interest Grace Sutherland and presidential aide Will Bullard, bring in strong support in the form of campaign strategist Bert Langdon, who becomes Cole's campaign manager as he complains of a dull existence since Cole retired from the presidency. As the campaigns progress, Cole and Harrison both become obsessed with winning the race at all costs, although Harrison refuses to resort to any cheating schemes, making Cole realize that in all his years of running for elections this may be the hardest as he is taking on an honest [[everyman]].  Eventually, on the night before the election, both candidates (for different reasons - Cole trying to get sympathy votes, Harrison wanting the campaign to end and believes Cole would be a better mayor than him) urge the voters to vote for the other candidate by saying that neither of them will vote for themselves. Harrison keeps his promise, but Cole votes for himself anyway. Upon the revelation that Cole won by one vote, his conscience gets the better of him and he concedes the match to Harrison.  However, Harrison lies that he voted for himself as well, and declines office, making Cole end up as mayor once again. Harrison later reveals to Sally that he conceded the election because Cole needs the mayorship more than he does and that all he really wanted was to propose marriage to her, which he does. As Handy is proposing to Sally, Monroe also proposes to Grace. The film ends with Bert Langdon telling Handy that he ran an excellent campaign and offers to be his campaign manager for [[Governor of Maine]], which Handy shows some interest in when he realizes a governor has certain authority over mayors.

White Chicks
 The plot begins in a [[convenience store]] where two FBI agent brothers who are posing as [[Cubans|Cuban]] clerks, Kevin and Marcus Copeland ([[Shawn Wayans]] and [[Marlon Wayans]]), try to capture members of an organization that sells drugs inside ice cream boxes. Unfortunately, the first arrival turns out to be a genuine ice cream delivery, and the actual drug dealers manage to get away. The situation is worsened by the fact that Kevin and Marcus have decided to resolve this bust by themselves.  The FBI supervisor, Elliott Gordon ([[Frankie Faison]]), gives the two agents a last chance to remain in the FBI by giving them the duty of protecting the mega-rich [[billionaire]] cruise line heiresses Brittany and Tiffany Wilson ([[Maitland Ward]] and [[Anne Dudek]]), who are arriving in town for Labor Day Weekend in the Hamptons, from a kidnapping plot (known as the socialite kidnappings). When the Wilson sisters get minor facial cuts in a car accident, Kevin convinces them to stay in the hotel all weekend. Kevin and Marcus then disguise themselves as the Wilson sisters with heavy prosthetic makeup and clothing in order to save their jobs.  At the Biddy Bad Boy hotel, Kevin and Marcus (now known as Brittany and Tiffany) meet Brittany and Tiffany's three best friends, Karen ([[Busy Philipps]]), Tori ([[Jessica Cauffiel]]), and Lisa ([[Jennifer Carpenter]]), and their rivals the Vandergeld sisters, Megan ([[Brittany Daniel]]) and Heather ([[Jaime King]]). They also encounter Karen's love interest, Heath, a broke and jobless actor who happens to be Heather's boyfriend. Kevin shows an interest in the news reporter Denise Porter ([[Rochelle Aytes]]) from New York 1 and makes an attempt to woo her, forgetting that he is still in disguise as a woman. Marcus' wife Gina ([[Faune Chambers]]), whose relationship is already troubled, becomes an additional complicating factor as she gets suspicious when she hears a woman's voice in the background during a phone conversation with Marcus. The woman (a sales assistant) is actually just trying to help Marcus get dressed in some very tight clothes (which he rips tears and breaks the heels), but Gina misinterprets them talking and assumes that Marcus is having an affair. Meanwhile, pro basketball player Latrell Spencer ([[Terry Crews]]) takes an interest in Marcus, thinking that he is Tiffany and white. A date with Marcus/Tiffany is then auctioned off to Latrell during a charity dinner, much to Marcus's fear and Heather's jealousy. At the same time, Kevin learns of Denise's desire to be wooed by a wealthy man as opposed to the men she usually sees and uses Latrell/Marcus's date to steal Latrell's [[Aston Martin DB7]] and house keys to take Denise on a date while pretending to be Latrell. When Kevin and Denise arrive at Latrell's house, Kevin gets mauled by Latrell's Rottweiler until he manages to trap the dog in a coat closet. As Kevin and Denise get close, he manages to gain some information relevant to the case of Ted Burton (the suspect they're after). Meanwhile, Marcus makes many attempts to repulse Latrell on their date while brushing off his many advances such as eating uncontrollably and messy, chewing off a hangnail on his big toe and farting. His attempts fail to do anything but amuse and further endear “Tiffany” to Latrell.  Elsewhere, FBI agents Gomez and Harper investigate Marcus and Kevin's hotel room due to suspicion. In their search, they find the Wilson Sisters masks and panties and conclude that they are Marcus and Kevin in disguise.  At a nightclub, Latrell attempts to [[roofie]] Marcus in hopes of having sex only to be tricked into taking it himself and ends up in bed with Heath's friend, Russ (Steven Grayhm). Marcus and Kevin beat Heather and Megan in a dance-off hoping to help Karen win Heath only to have Heather drag him off. Karen is seen vomiting in the bathroom, drunk and unintentionally slips to Marcus and Kevin that Warren Vangergeld ([[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]]) is penniless, and has only recently paid Karen's own father back for loans he has lent him. The next day, the real Brittany and Tiffany see their faces in a magazine due to them (Kevin and Marcus) dancing in the nightclub, and they realize that two people are impersonating them. Gina and her friend, Shaunice ([[Drew Sidora]]), see Kevin as Brittany while visiting Marcus and believes that Marcus is "cheating" on her and leaves him in disbelief and hurt. The Wilson sisters go to the hotel their clones were seen at where agents Gomez and Harper undress them and pull at their faces and their hair, thinking they are Marcus and Kevin, only to find out that they're the real Wilson sisters and lose their jobs. This leads to the chief finding out that Marcus and Kevin have been impersonating Brittany and Tiffany. Because of this, the chief fires the both of them. Later on, Kevin and Marcus then realize that Mr. Vandergeld has been behind the kidnappings, using the ransom money to keep his family in their luxurious lifestyle. Their attempts to notify their chief fall on deaf ears and so they pursue the case themselves.  At the fashion show, Kevin and Marcus replace the Vandergeld sisters on the catwalk which angers them and attempt to humiliate the Wilson sisters. Marcus stands up for Karen after she tells Heath she's tired of waiting for him and he callously brushes her off. After the Vandergeld sisters are foiled by the trio and humiliated off the catwalk, Marcus and Kevin are exposed by the real Wilson sisters, at which point Warren Vandergeld attempts to kidnap the Wilson sisters. He temporarily manages to capture one of the real twins and Kevin, only to have his criminal activities and bankruptcy exposed. In the ensuing fight, Kevin is shot trying to protect Denise, and Latrell is shot trying to protect Marcus. The duo successfully captures Vandergeld along with Heath and Russ (with the help of Gomez and Harper) before his plan succeeded which gets them their jobs back. While thanking Latrell, Marcus peels his mask off, revealing that he is actually a black man. While Latrell is upset that Marcus is a man, his primary anger stems from the fact that Marcus is black, not that he is a man. Marcus apologizes to Gina for constantly putting work before love, and the two make up, much to Shaunice's chagrin. Denise falls for Kevin after he saves her from a bullet shot by Vandergeld when she caught his secret on film. The movie ends with Tori, Lisa, and Karen admitting they liked Brittany and Tiffany a lot more when it was Marcus and Kevin, and the five agree to remain friends, promising to go shopping.

Unable to confront the woman he believes may be Lisa, he blows off the trip and instead embarks on an obsessive search for her, as the story of Matt and Lisa's romance unfolds in flashbacks.  A key card which the woman leaves at the restaurant leads Matt to a hotel, where he finds Lisa's silver compact and an article marked in a newspaper. He leaves a note for Lisa at the restaurant bar, borrows Luke's car, and trails the man from the newspaper article to an apartment. There Matt discovers a note to Lisa under the door, with her key enclosed. The apartment is deserted, but he leaves Lisa a note himself, to meet him in Wicker Park, and keeps the key. An ecstatic Matt returns the car to Luke, who is furious because he has missed a date with his new girlfriend Alex. When Alex calls, Matt takes the blame and Luke is mollified.  The next day, after waiting in vain at Wicker Park, Matt goes back to the apartment and is caught by a woman who is also named Lisa. She says the apartment is hers, but she has a coat and red-soled shoes with a broken heel identical to Lisa's—shoes that came from Luke's shop, where Lisa first met Matt. She says that she was at the hotel because the man in the newspaper was stalking her, and asks Matt to stay the night. They end up sleeping together. Flashbacks reveal that this "Lisa" is actually Alex, Lisa's old neighbor and friend. Alex had fallen in love with Matt from afar, but he met and fell for Lisa before Alex found the courage to speak to him. The man from the newspaper was stalking Lisa, and Alex agreed to swap apartments with her for a few days before Lisa left for a new job in London.

She overhears Luke say Matt is at the apartment, and runs out to call him and meet him there. After receiving Matt's note at the restaurant, Lisa calls and asks Luke to tell Matt to meet her at three o'clock, saying he will know where. When Alex arrives at the apartment, Matt gives her another pair of red-soled shoes, Lisa's size, but they are too big. She realizes he suspects something, but Matt says he can exchange them and leaves. Alex then calls Luke and asks him to meet her at the restaurant.  Now suspicious, Matt follows "Lisa" (Alex), bumps into Luke, and follows him into the restaurant to finally meet Alex, the girl Luke is in love with. Matt confronts Alex, her deception revealed. A flashback reveals that two years ago, the same day that Matt asked Lisa to move in with him, Lisa was offered a last minute job touring with a show in Europe and had to jump on a plane. Lisa had given Alex a note to deliver to Matt, telling him she loved him and wanted to live with him. Instead, Alex had kept the note, deleted all the messages Lisa had left for Matt on his answering machine, and told Lisa that she had caught Matt in bed with another woman. Matt never learned why Lisa left, seemingly without a word. In the present, a confused Luke tells Matt that Lisa called and wants him to meet her at three o'clock before she returns to London. Matt is unsure where to meet, but Alex gives him Lisa's old note and he realizes that Lisa is at Wicker Park. Arriving too late, Matt then races to the airport, and is met by Rebecca, who has come to pick him up from the business trip to China he never went on. He confesses that he still loves someone else and cannot marry her. Lisa is nearby on the phone, listening to Alex admit what she has done and apologize.

Oz, meanwhile, is now married to Jimmy's ex-wife Cynthia ([[Natasha Henstridge]]) and has a dental practice in California, now expecting their first child, but the relationship is complicated due to Oz's over-excessive paranoia about security, as well as Cynthia's secret continued contact with Jimmy (Although Oz also talks with Jill on occasion).  Their lives are further complicated by the return of [[László|Laszlo]] Gogolak ([[Kevin Pollak]]), a father figure of Jimmy's who ran the mob that Jimmy was once a member of, Jimmy and Jill having killed his son, Janni, while Laszlo was in prison. Having deduced that Jimmy is still alive, Laszlo abducts Cynthia and threatens Oz to try to learn Jimmy's location, Oz only just managing to escape, by turning the lights out. With no other options, Oz contacts Jimmy and Jill for assistance, but Jimmy initially refuses to help until Laszlo's men attack the house after following Oz's car.  Having captured Laszlo's remaining son, Strabonitz (Strabo, for short), Jimmy tells Laszlo that he will trade Cynthia for Strabo, but the group's attempt to check into a hotel results in Oz unintentionally triggering further conflict between Jimmy and Jill when he reveals that Jimmy still wears a crucifix Cynthia gave him. Retreating to a bar to get drunk, Jimmy becomes increasingly depressed about his apparent failure to father a child with Jill, although Oz becomes frustrated when Jimmy starts discussing his and Cynthia's old sex life, culminating in them becoming so drunk that Oz and Jimmy wake up in the same bed (Although nothing happens).  Increasingly frustrated at her poor sex life with Jimmy, Jill attempts to seduce Oz, resulting in Jimmy walking in on them and knocking Oz out, subsequently regaining his passion for Jill and his work as the two proceed to have sex in the bathroom. While re-arming themselves at Oz's house, the three are attacked by an unknown marksman, whose attempts to shoot them result in Strabo being killed in the crossfire, the subsequent argument causing Jill to leave in frustration at Jimmy's insults of her capabilities and his cold dismissal of Oz. Increasingly driven to breaking point by recent events, Oz retreats to his practice, where Jimmy greets him to apologize for recent events, only for Oz's new receptionist Julie to chloroform Oz and Jimmy, revealing that she is the sister of 'Frankie Figgs', out for revenge for Oz and Jimmy's role in her brother's death.  Waking up with Cynthia and Jimmy in Laszlo's apartment, Oz is shocked to learn that the current situation has been part of a plan by Jimmy and Cynthia from the beginning so that Cynthia could find Laszlo's half of the first dollar he ever stole, which he had torn in half to be divided between Jimmy and Yanni when they were kids. Just as Laszlo is preparing to kill the three of them, Jill shows up, having set up Strabo's body so that he appears to be alive and tied up in her car, threatening to detonate explosives in her car unless Laszlo releases Oz and Cynthia. Claiming to want to join Laszlo's organization, Jill is ordered to shoot Jimmy, finally apparently shooting Jimmy in the heart when he informs her that she'll never be a successful hitter.  When Jill's car detonates as Laszlo's men go to release Strabo, it is revealed that Jill was in on the plan as well, having merely shot Jimmy with blanks. With Jules having been exposed as the shooter who killed Strabo, Laszlo shoots her, Jimmy subsequently having Jill shoot Laszlo in the foot, unable to kill the man who raised him. As the group depart, Jimmy and Cynthia reveal that the plan was set up to acquire Laszlo's half of the dollar, the combined dollar revealing the account number for a Gogalak account containing $280 million. With Jill having revealed that she is pregnant, the four drive away while the police arrest Laszlo.

Bridge can do nothing but drive away when the traffic light turns green and the police car honks at him to get moving. Brittney phones in an anonymous tip that Bridge's car trunk has Maya's body in it. He is soon arrested and jailed. A videotape from the Dunlap home security system shows Bridge demanding half of the inheritance money from Brittney and Maya.  Later, Brittney flies off in a private plane with the very much alive Dunlap, who had faked his own death to escape prosecution for misappropriating millions of dollars of corporate funds to pay his gambling debts, and also to avoid the Cuban gambler, Cicatriz to whom he still owed millions. Brittney and Dunlap don parachutes, planning to bail out over swampland and disappear together. As Dunlap is poised to bail out, Brittney reveals that she packed his chute with newspaper and pushes him from the plane to his death. She then bails out, landing safely in the swamp, where her mother, also very much alive, is waiting for her in a swamp boat.  It is revealed that Brittney and her mother orchestrated everything, including the deaths of Brittney's co-conspirators, in order to steal Dunlap's fortune, and they relax in the sun on a tropical island. Brittney comes down the stairs of their villa overlooking the ocean with two drinks and hands one to her mother. As Brittney watches intently, her mother takes a sip and remarks that the drink is strong. Brittney replies "They do make them strong here, don't they?" with a wry smile, the implication being that she has poisoned the drink.

She feels lost, unable to live with her husband and young son and suspecting she is ill. To find out more about Emilio, on an impulse she flies alone to [[Buenos Aires]], where she is hospitalised and undergoes a mastectomy. Dying in the bed next to her is a very old woman called Matilde, who is visited by her divorced grandson Ernesto.   He takes the recovering Vera to clear out his grandmother's house, where it emerges that the young Matilde had been a whore in the same establishment as Lola, a Spanish chorus girl who had sunk into prostitution in a remote town in Patagonia. Ernesto takes Vera to the town, where his father reveals that it was the photographer Emilio who in 1934 bought Lola's freedom from Suárez, a blind composer of tangos. When the two boarded an aircraft to leave, Lola could not face the future and threw herself out over the sea, falling to her death beside a whale with a harpoon wound. When Vera and Ernesto visit the spot, they see the  same whale, now very old, recognisable by the same wound.   
Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!
 The film opens with a soldier and nurse getting out of two 1940-style cars in the middle of night. The nurse runs up to the soldier and the camera switches to reveal this to be a scene from a film. Three [[Piggly Wiggly]] store workers in [[Fraziers Bottom, West Virginia]]—Rosalee, Cathy, and Pete—are watching and as the nurse on screen asks for forgiveness and the soldier agrees, the women in the audience are moved to tears as Pete is clearly unimpressed. As the ladies wonder what Tad Hamilton—the star of the film—is doing at that moment, their prediction of praying is proven false as the scene cuts to Tad—described in the next scene by his agent—"drinking, driving, smoking, leering, and groping all at the same time".  Tad's agent tells him that his hedonistic lifestyle is damaging his reputation and career opportunities. In order to improve his image and convince a director to cast him in an upcoming film, his agents establish a competition to win a date with Tad with proceeds going towards the charity [[Save the Children]]. An online advertisement for the competition is found by Rosalee. With the help of the Piggly Wiggly customers and the reluctant agreement of Pete, Cathy and Rosalee raise the $100 entrance money as Pete reveals to his superior that he will leave for Richmond to go to college after he has a discussion "with someone about going to Richmond with me".  A news crew arrives outside Rosalee's house, signalling her success at winning a date with Tad Hamilton. Subsequently, a despondent Pete sees her off at the airport. Rosalee is awed by Los Angeles and becomes tongue-tied in Tad's presence; the date does not go well as Rosalee vomits in the limousine and Tad mentioning his love of animals—which Pete had warned was a signal of sexual intentions—rouses her suspicions. After seeing Tad's house, Rosalee requests to go back to the hotel and soon returns home, leaving Tad thoughtful.  As Pete is about to tell Rosalee about moving to Richmond she is surprised—as much as Pete is disappointed—by Tad's sudden arrival to rekindle their relationship. Though Rosalee is still cynical of him as he uses a line from one of his films, his admission of not having "his priorities straight" seems to convince her of his good intentions. During a phone call with his agent, Tad insists that he wants to turn over a new leaf, and will not return to Los Angeles for a while. When he picks Rosalee up for a date he leaves a good impression on Rosalee's father, who had studied hard for the encounter. Pete tries to stop their date by reporting the pair for illegally parking. He tries to convince Rosalee that Tad is just using her. Despite all his efforts, Rosalee and Tad grow close over the next few days.  In the bar, Pete corners Tad in a men's room stall. After conceding that Rosalee is in love with Tad, Pete tells Tad that Rosalee is more than a "wholesome small town girl", Rosalee is a wonderful person with "the kind of beauty a guy only sees once". He explains about her six smiles: one smile when something makes her laugh, one for polite laughter, one for when she makes plans, one when she makes fun of herself, one when she's uncomfortable, and one when she's talking about her friends. Pete makes Tad swear not to break her heart or he will tear Tad to pieces with his bare hands or "vicious rhetoric". When the pair is in Tad's hotel room, his agents appear and inform him that the director has decided to cast him in the film after all. Tad is overjoyed and convinces Rosalee to come to Los Angeles with him by using Pete's "six smiles" speech.  After a rousing speech about great love from Angelica, a barmaid with a crush on him, Pete rushes to Rosalee's house and confesses his love for her but she is confused and resolves to still go to LA with Tad. On the plane when Tad fails to identify one of Rosalee's smiles, he confesses his lie and she asks to go home. She runs to Piggly Wiggly and Pete's house, then drives furiously towards Richmond to overtake her heartbroken friend. Similar to the opening scene, Rosalee and Pete get out of their cars and Pete, surrendering to a romantic song on the car radio, asks her to dance.

Without a Paddle
 Twelve years after graduating from high school, three friends, Jerry, Dan, and Tom, find out that their childhood friend Billy has died in a parasailing accident. After the funeral, they revisit the group's old tree-house and find a map leading to [[D. B. Cooper]]'s lost treasure, which Billy had apparently been working on for his entire life. Dan takes a break from his job as a doctor and joins Jerry and Tom on a camping trip to find the treasure.  They take a canoe down the river and eventually stop on the riverside for the night. They discover that they forgot to bring food, so Tom goes out to catch some fish. However, the activity attracts a grizzly bear to their position, and the bear chases the group into a tree. In the morning, the group find all of their gear has been ripped up and completely destroyed by the bear.  The trio takes off into the river but are unable to read the map, causing them to go the wrong way. They fall off of a waterfall, and while they survive, their canoe is destroyed. They venture into the woods with a compass and find themselves at a pot farm where two farmers, Dennis and Elwood, mistake them for thieves and start shooting at them. They escape, burning the pot garden down in the process. This enrages the farmers, who decide to hunt them down and kill them.  Later, far into the forest the trio meets two [[hippie]] girls, Flower and Butterfly, who treat them in their tree. Using a radio the farmers find them, but the hippie girls drop paper bags full of feces at the farmers to distract them while the trio escapes.

Windstruck
 The film stars [[Jun Ji-hyun]] as Officer Yeo Kyung-jin, an ambitious young female police officer serving on the [[Seoul]] police department. One day while chasing a purse snatcher, she accidentally captures Go Myung-woo (played by [[Jang Hyuk]]), a physics teacher at an all-girls school, who was actually trying to catch the thief. Later, Myung-woo discovers the stolen purse, but just as he picks it up, Kyung-jin spots him and tries to arrest him again. Kyung-jin is then given the job of escorting Myung-woo through a dangerous district, only to be distracted when she tries to break up a meeting between [[Russian Mafia]] and Korean gangsters. With Myung-woo handcuffed to her, Kyung-jin almost single-handedly brings down the two rival gangs (although she is helped when she accidentally causes the groups to start shooting at each other).  The first half of the film, told from Myung-woo's point of view, details the couple's growing attraction and love for each other, which climaxes with a trip to the countryside where Myung-woo tells Kyung-jin that if he were ever to die, he wanted to come back to earth as the wind. Soon after, he is almost killed in a freak automobile accident, but Kyung-jin saves his life.  The film takes a turn into the fantasy genre in its second half after Myung-woo is accidentally shot and killed by another officer (although the situation is such that Kyung-jin thinks that it was her shot that killed him) as Kyung-jin chases after a criminal. Kyung-jin falls into a [[Suicide|suicidal]] [[clinical depression|depression]] over his death and attempts to kill herself several times, almost succeeding when she throws herself off a building, only to be saved when a giant balloon floats under her. Soon after, she experiences visitations from Myung-woo, who appears as the wind, sending her messages and, at one point, he even appears in her dreams in order to give her the will to live after she is nearly shot to death by a criminal.  Ultimately the film follows a similar path set out by the American film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' with Myung-woo and Kyung-jin communicating and sharing one final gesture of love before he moves on to the afterlife. Myung-woo said that he will whisper, when she hears him whisper in the wind, she will meet someone with a soul like him. Myung-woo told Kyung-jin that he will always be beside her inside a book with a photo left by Myung-woo in the restaurant before he rushed to meet Kyung-jin who was chasing the insane criminal.   In the first half of the film, Myung-woo told that his only memory of high school was his high school trip. The book and the photo is found and returned to Kyung-jin in the police station. The photo showed that on  Myung-woo's trip, Kyung-jin was nearby. This proved Myung-woo's "I'm always beside you" was true to Kyung-jin. Kyung-jin rushed out to locate the finder of the book, ultimately ending up in the train station, where she is saved by [[Cha Tae-hyun]]'s character (credited as The Guy). Myung-woo whispered that The Guy is the one with the soul like him. Kyung-jin whispers that "he is always beside her."

The Woodsman (2004 film)
 Walter ([[Kevin Bacon]]), a convicted [[Child molestation|child molester]], returns home to [[Philadelphia]] after serving 12 years in prison. His friends and family have abandoned him, with the exception of his brother-in-law, Carlos ([[Benjamin Bratt]]). Walter's apartment is just across the street from an elementary school—an obvious source of temptation. He gets a job at a local lumber mill and meets Vicki ([[Kyra Sedgwick]]), one of the few women working there. After sleeping with Vicki, Walter tells her that he molested little girls, but rationalizes his crimes by saying "I didn't hurt them." Vicki is clearly shocked and disturbed by this new information, but before she can consider how to respond to it, Walter tells her to leave his apartment.  Walter receives frequent visits from a verbally abusive police officer named Lucas ([[Mos Def]]), who makes it clear that he is waiting to catch Walter reoffending. Watching the school, Walter sees a man offering candy to little boys in an apparent effort to gain their confidence. He realizes that this man, whom he nicknames "Candy" (Kevin Rice), is another child molester. Walter also meets an apparently lonely young girl named Robin (Hannah Pilkes) who is a bird watcher. Walter sees Candy abduct a boy; however, he does not report this to the police. Walter's life takes a further downturn when a suspicious co-worker, Mary-Kay ([[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]]), learns of his conviction. She prints out his police record and posts it on the bulletin board at the mill for everybody to see. Some of the employees attack Walter, but Vicki and the boss of the mill come to his defense.  Ostracized and frustrated, Walter leaves his workplace and goes to the park. Vicki, fearing the worst, begins to search for him. Walter ends up meeting with Robin at the park. As they talk, he begins to succumb to his desires and invites Robin to sit on his lap. She politely refuses, but then begins to confide in him. As she begins to cry, Walter realizes that she is being molested by her father. In her anguish, and sensing a similarity between her father and Walter, she offers to sit on Walter's lap, wanting his approval. Walter finally understands the pain he caused his victims, and tells Robin to go home; as she leaves, she gives him a hug. On his way home, he sees Candy dropping off a young boy near the school at night. In a fit of rage and self-hatred, Walter gives Candy a thorough beating. Afterwards, he goes to Vicki's home, and she accepts him.  Soon after, Lucas visits Walter's apartment as Walter is packing to move in with Vicki and tells him that a man was beaten across the street the night before, and asks if he knows anything about it. Walter denies any knowledge, but Lucas knows better. He reveals that the boy gave a very good description of the assailant, which fits Walter. He also reveals that "Candy" is wanted in [[Virginia]] for raping a young boy. Lucas decides not to charge Walter with the assault. With Carlos' help, Walter is reunited with his sister, whom he has not seen in years. However, she refuses to forgive him and leaves. In a voice-over discussion in which his therapist ([[Michael Shannon]]) tells him that eventual forgiveness may take several years, Walter replies that he understands and accepts her anger, and expresses optimism for his own future.  
The Work and the Glory (film)
 The Steed family moves from their [[Vermont]] settlement to [[Upstate New York]] to set up a farm. Benjamin, the father, hires two local boys, Joseph and Hyrum Smith, recommended by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], a prominent figure of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].  Joseph and Hyrum are hard workers but eschewed by some town members, who are put off by Joseph's claims of seeing a [[vision (religion)|vision]], Hyrum's belief in his brother's vision and that Joseph will receive a "Gold Bible."  The Steeds' oldest son, Joshua, is quickly swayed by the town members and encourages his father to fire them. Joshua has a falling out with his father and leaves home. He finds work at the town's port but adopts the habits of his friends and becomes a drunkard. He courts Lydia McBride, but her father disapproves if him. The Steeds' younger son, Nathan, believes Joseph's story. He meets Lydia while he is trying to contact his brother. Benjamin ends his employment of the Smith boys, as he believes that his association with them is detrimental to his family's reputation.  Joshua and his friends learn that Joseph is about to receive the "Gold Bible" (the [[Golden Plates]]) and set up a plan to ambush him and steal the gold. Lydia learns of their plan and warns the Steed family, who then warn the Smith family. They arrive at the Smith home just before Joseph does. Though he is attacked, he retains the plates and is relatively unharmed. Learning of the attack, Benjamin and Nathan head into town to find Joshua.  Finding him at his usual haunt, the local bar, Benjamin confronts him. Joshua is standoffish but does not deny that he and his friends attacked Joseph. A fight breaks out between Benjamin and Joshua, but no serious injuries are inflicted. The confrontation results in Joshua fleeing the town and becoming an [[outlaw]], who eventually settles in [[Missouri]].  With Joshua gone, Nathan and Lydia's relationship grows and strengthens. To receive permission to marry Nathan, Lydia must attend a private school in [[Boston]] for a year, and Nathan uses the time to purchase his own land and build his own home. However, he becomes a member of the Latter-Day Saint movement that had been established by Joseph, which infuriates McBride's father, and he demands for her to break her engagement to him. She flees from the school before completing the requisite year.  At the edge of the Frontier, Joshua learns of his brother's engagement to Lydia for whom he still holds a torch.  He returns to Palmyra and confronts Nathan. After a squabble, Lydia herself declares that she loves Nathan and would never return to Joshua. He flees again as the town's law enforcement has a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] for his [[arrest]]. Lydia confronts Nathan, asking him whether he loves her or the new gospel more. Because he is unable to deny either, she breaks with him. Nathan writes a letter to Lydia, trying to win her back and delivering her a copy of the ''[[Book of Mormon]]''. Her father, however, finds it before she receives it and discards it in the trash.  Benjamin has been suspicious of Joseph and his religion. His family is intrigued by Joseph and try to learn more, but Benjamin has forbidden mention of Joseph's name or the religion. After a confrontation with Nathan, he reconsiders his decision and agrees to allow the family to investigate Joseph's church if they need to.  Nathan takes his sisters and his mother to one of Joseph's meetings and are [[baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptized]].  While they are gone, Lydia discovers Nathan's discarded letter and book.  Defying her parents, she visits Nathan's home under construction and studies his ''Book of Mormon.'' Nathan returns to his farm to find a note from Lydia that quotes Ruth 1:16–17. There, he also finds Lydia, who accepts his proposal.  
The Wolf (film)
  The film is based on the life of [[Mikel Lejarza]], an agent of the Spanish [[Centro Superior de Información de la Defensa|intelligence service]] in the 1970s. During the last stages of the [[Francoist State]] between 1973 and 1975, Lejarza infiltrated [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], a paramilitary group seeking independence for the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and was responsible for the downfall of one quarter of the terrorist activists of the organisation - including Special Forces members and some top-level figures of the group.  Lobo's operation destabilized the terrorist organization at a time when its actions were becoming a perfect validation for the most conservative arm of the Francoist State to take full powers and stop all democratic process in Spain.  The Lobo operation hindered the terrorists’ plans to escape from the prison where they were held and pursue a campaign of surprise attacks across the country.  Lobo was a man betrayed and ruined by the Francois Spain's secret services, who although at first hiring him to help them stop the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], tried to get rid of him later on when he became less useful. This did not stop Lobo, and he kept on with his mission, which became the most successful ever held against [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] by the Spanish Government.  Because of his betrayal, ETA sentenced Lobo to death and covered the whole Basque country with search posters of Mikel Lejarza, hoping that their supporters would aid in the capture and destruction of 'the wolf.' As a result Mikel had to change his name and face and disappear without a trace. The memory of Lobo is so vivid to ETA that its members always carry around a bullet bearing his name to kill him if they ever meet or see him.  
Woman Is the Future of Man

While having dinner in a restaurant, Kim convinces Lee to arrange a meeting between them and Kim's old girlfriend Park Seon-hwa ([[Sung Hyun-ah]]). Unbeknownst to Kim, however, Lee had become involved in a relationship with her after Kim's departure to the United States. The three meet for a night of drinking, as past tensions and attractions reemerge.  In the end, both self-centered men abandon Park as they had years ago.  
The Wool Cap
 In New York City, Charles Gigot ([[William H. Macy]]) is an alcoholic, disgruntled hearing-mute and superintendent of an apartment building with eccentric tenants.  One day, he meets Lou ([[Keke Palmer]]), a young girl who lives with her mother Arlene (Cherise Booth) and her boyfriend, Bernard (Edward Yankie).  When Gigot suspects that their apartment may have been broken into, he investigates, only to encounter two thugs looking for the couple.  His presence creates a diversion that allows Lou, who had been in hiding, to escape to the basement with her mother.  Despite Gigot's protestations, Arlene leaves Lou in Gigot's care for an indefinite time while she sorts things out with Bernard.  Annoyed at having his solitude compromised, Gigot attempts to ignore Lou completely, but her brash and back-talking attitude makes her unbearable.  Lou is equally uncomfortable with Gigot's spartan style of living – he has no food in the apartment, drinks frequently, and is emotionally distant.  In fact, his only friends seem to be his pet monkey, Grace, and Gloria ([[Catherine O'Hara]]), a middle-aged prostitute.  Wanting to find a relative with whom Lou can live, he learns from the apartment's lease that Lou has an aunt named Cheryl who lives in Philadelphia.  They travel via bus to Cheryl's house, but Gigot is unsuccessful in convincing her to take Lou, learning that Arlene and Cheryl hate one another and that Cheryl does not consider Lou a relative.  Realizing that finding Arlene is the only solution to the dilemma, Gigot and Lou research one of her contacts, who sends them to an apartment building in the city.  Gigot goes in alone and discovers that the place is a crack house and that Arlene has become a drug addict.  Seeing a dead-end, Gigot's only option is to return home with Lou.  Things become even more complicated, however, when he is robbed at a diner and is forced to perform a sideshow featuring Grace and Lou to raise enough money for the bus tickets.  During this course of events, Gigot and Lou bond and she comes to live with him permanently.  Lou's influence causes Gigot to stop drinking and to help her with her education (he realizes that she is almost illiterate and two years older than the rest of her class).  They develop a father-daughter relationship with Lou helping Gigot grieve when local thugs poison Grace in an act of revenge for Gigot disposing of drugs belonging to one of their members.  Eventually, policemen visit the apartment building and inform Gigot that Arlene died from an overdose.  He attempts to shield Lou from the truth, but is forced to tell her while on a trip to a theme park.  Her grief prompts Gigot to seek out a friend named Clarence (Tyrone Benskin) who served with him in Vietnam and has since become a foster parent for multiple children without homes.  Clarence and his wife, Bess, however, announce that they are retired, leaving Gigot with no other choice but to become a foster parent himself after Child Protective Services arrives to claim Lou.  The process comes to a halt, however, when Gigot's jail-time prevents him from being a candidate and a proposal of marriage to Gloria is refused.  At this point, Gigot's only chance is his parents, whom he hasn't seen in twenty-eight years.  Hoping that they will officially adopt Lou so that he may take care of her, Gigot pays them a visit and is shocked to learn that his mother died years ago and his father ([[Ned Beatty]]) has since remarried.  During an argument, it is revealed that Gigot's downward spiral into alcoholism and virtual isolation were a result of post-traumatic stress from his time in Vietnam.  The titular wool cap, which he wears throughout the film, belonged to his younger sister who died in a car accident while Gigot was at the wheel, drunk and high.  Hurt by Gigot's indifference throughout the years, his father rejects him and his request to adopt Lou.  Meanwhile, being a foster chlid is hard on Lou, who falls into a life of waywardness.  She is eventually arrested for shop-lifting and put into juvenile hall where she refuses to see Gigot, having given up hope on ever finding a home.  Depressed and utterly forlorn, Gigot attempts to start afresh on Christmas Day by letting go of the past (symbolized by throwing his sister's wool cap into a river) and visiting a church, where he breaks down crying.  On coming home, he finds his stepmother and father waiting for him at the apartment building.  After a brief hesitation, Gigot and his father embrace, a sign that they will begin to repair their relationship.  Later that evening, Gigot visits Lou at juvenile hall and introduces her to his father.  Using sign language, he tells her that he would like to adopt her.  In a subtle imitation of Gigot, she becomes speechless and wordlessly accepts.  The film jumps forward a year.  It is winter again and Gigot has since become the manager of his father's business.  He goes to pick up Lou from school where she has become an excellent student.  The two are seen driving off together and laughing, happy to have found one another.  
Der Wixxer
 The film begins at BlackWhite castle, one of the last castles in [[Black-and-white|black & white]] located in the [[United Kingdom]]. Residing there is the Earl of Cockwood ([[Thomas Fritsch]]), a notorious gangster. At some point, a tourist couple from [[Bitterfeld-Wolfen|Bitterfeld]] gets lost in the woods and witness a murder: the Monk with the Whip gets overrun by a truck. At the wheel: The Wixxer, an evil gangster who wears a skull mask and wants to take over Londons crime scene. To do that he arranges for the death of many of the current gangsters.  [[Scotland Yard]] sends its - allegedly - best man, Chief Inspector Even Longer. Since the Wixxer killed Even Longer's partner Rather Short ([[Thomas Heinze]]), a new partner is assigned: Very Long. They start to investigate and suspect the Earl of Cockwood. However, the Earl (who officially raises [[pug]]s and unofficially smuggles [[girl group]]s, amongst other things) is affected by the Wixxer's ambitions as well.  Their investigations bring the two inspectors back to London where they meet the dubious Harry Smeerlap ([[Lars Rudolph]]) and his men, who work for Cockwood. Smeerlap tries to conceal his racketeerings, but Very Long and Even Longer can finally arrest him. At the end they are able to finally identify the Wixxer: it is none other than Rather Short who killed the original Wixxer and assumed his identity.  
A World Without Thieves
 The story is set primarily on a train bound inland from [[Tibet]]. Sha Gen (played by [[Wang Baoqiang]]), a naïve village boy working as construction worker in Tibet, was returning home to get married. Refusing to believe that thieves exist in the world, Sha Gen insists on carrying his five years of savings worth [[Renminbi|¥]]60,000 ($7,200 [[USD]]<ref>Elley, Derek. "[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117926685?refcatid=31 A World Without Thieves]." ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Wednesday 30 March 2005.

As such, he has attracted the attention of Wang Bo (Andy Lau) and Wang Li (Rene Liu), who are lovers as well as highly skilled professional thieves. Wang Bo wants to steal the money as a last hit to end their career, but Wang Li, pregnant with their child and moved by Sha Gen's innocence, decides to protect the boy.  The situation is further complicated when a small gang of thieves led by Hu Li ([[homophone]] of ''fox'' (狐狸 ''Húli'') in Chinese), also known as Uncle Li ([[Ge You]]), boards the train. Uncle Li instructs his followers, among them Xiao Ye ([[Li Bingbing]]) and Four-Eyes ([[Gordon Lam]]), to refrain from doing a job on the train. Tempted by the huge amount of cash, however, some members disobey and strike, only to be robbed by Wang Bo moments later. This exposes Wang's skills to Uncle Li, who becomes highly interested in recruiting him. When Wang declines, the contest between the Wangs and Uncle Li's gang quickly escalates, with Sha Gen still completely unaware of the danger surrounding him.  While the two sides tussle, however, a plainclothes police detective ([[Zhang Hanyu]]) has been silently watching and awaiting his chance. As the police force eventually closes in, Uncle Li attempts to make off with Sha Gen's money but is confronted by Wang Bo, who has finally promised to lend his help to Wang Li to protect Sha Gen's innocence. The two engage in a violent hand-to-hand combat. Although Wang succeeds in retrieving the money and giving it back, he is seriously injured in the fray, and subsequently dies. Uncle Li and his gang are all apprehended as the train pulls into station, but the police officer lets Wang Li go on compassionate grounds. Wang Li returns to Tibet sometime later, and prays to the heavens in a show of penance.

 Five thousand years ago, a heroic Pharaoh imprisoned [[List of Yu-Gi-Oh! characters#Anubis|Anubis]], the Egyptian lord of the dead, after he tried to destroy the world by persuading the kings to play the mysterious Shadow Games. In the present day, Anubis' tomb is uncovered by archaeologists, amazed with his most valuable treasure, the Pyramid of Light. A devastating spiritual force unleashes from the relic and liberates the Egyptian sorcerer. Anubis, now free, intends to conclude his plan.  Meanwhile, the Battle City Finals have recently concluded, and Yugi Muto has achieved international fame by defeating his arch-rival Seto Kaiba and obtaining the three legendary God Cards: ''Slifer the Sky Dragon'', ''Obelisk the Tormentor'', and the ''Winged Dragon of Ra''. Kaiba, determined to defeat Yugi, turns to Pegasus, the creator of Duel Monsters, in order to obtain any new cards designed to defeat the God Cards. Pegasus tells Kaiba that he has a card he is looking for, but will only give it to Kaiba if he can beat him in a duel. Kaiba defeats Pegasus and claims two cards, one of which was secretly planted by Anubis.  Meanwhile, Yugi and Téa go to the local museum where Anubis' corpse and the Pyramid of Light are on display. They meet up with Yugi's grandpa Solomon, who reads a prophecy describing a clairvoyant eye which will prevent the world's destruction if blinded. Anubis' spirit attacks the group with Yugi having a vision of Anubis himself manipulating Kaiba and him in a Shadow Game. He awakens to find Anubis and the Pyramid of Light missing. Kaiba's brother Mokuba arrives, and Yugi is taken to Kaiba's duel dome with his friends Joey and Tristan in pursuit. Kaiba arrogantly and ignorantly forces Yami Yugi into a duel, unaware that Anubis is manipulating him into using one of the two new cards, ''Pyramid of Light'', which covers the field in a huge replica of the actual pyramid and destroys the God Cards. Yugi, Joey and Tristan are sucked into the pyramid while Mokuba flees the crumbling building.  Yugi, Joey, and Tristan awaken within the Millennium Puzzle, finding Anubis' tomb within. Anubis reveals that his monsters will destroy the modern world. Yami Yugi and Kaiba continue their duel, each blow to their in-game Life Points draining away their physical energy. To make matters worse, Kaiba's ''Deck Destruction Virus'' sends more than half of Yami's deck to the Graveyard, leaving him with barely any cards, and attacks from his ''Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon'' and ''Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon'' (his second new card), both with 4500 Attack Points, drop Yami's Life Points to 200. Pegasus figures out what is going on and arrives in a helicopter to rescue Téa, Solomon, and Mokuba. Téa sends her soul into the Millennium Puzzle to aid Yugi, Joey and Tristan. Yugi finds the Dagger of Fate within Anubis' tomb, and uses it to destroy the all-seeing eye in the tomb as predicted by the prophecy.  When Kaiba deviates from Anubis' plan and attempts to destroy the ''Pyramid of Light'', Anubis materializes, casts him aside, and takes command of the duel. Yami, reunited with Yugi, destroys the ''Pyramid of Light'' card with ''Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon'' and then uses Kaiba's planned strategy to summon the God Cards and end the duel by destroying Anubis. However, Anubis transforms into a monster and allows any monster to become real when summoned. This proves to be his undoing when Yugi and Yami summon ''Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon'' to destroy Anubis, defeating him for good. In the end, Kaiba departs promising to defeat Yugi, and Yugi thanks Yami and his friends for their companionship.  
Yesterday (2004 film)
 Yesterday is a Zulu mother living with her seven-year-old daughter, Beauty, in their rural village of Rooihoek (English translation means literally "red corner"), in [[Zululand District Municipality|Zululand]], South Africa. Every day of her life is spent in the hard work of tilling the field to plant enough food for them, fetching water, cutting firewood and hauling it home, all while also trying to keep her daughter stimulated and occupied. She strikes up a friendship with the new teacher who arrives in the village.  Yesterday is plagued by a persistent cough and feelings of weakness. She goes to the local clinic, which is an extremely long walk for her and Beauty. She waits all day in the long queue to see the doctor, only to be turned away at the end of the day without having seen the doctor. She brushes it off, saying that she is not that ill. When Beauty finds her mother collapsed on the doorstep of their home, she runs to call her mother's friend, the teacher. Yesterday consults a traditional healer, but her teacher friend insists she return to the clinic. The teacher pays for a taxi to the clinic so that she can get there early enough to see the doctor; the teacher also takes care of Beauty for the day. The doctor who sees Yesterday asks her where she got her name from, and Yesterday explains that her father named her Yesterday because, "He said things were better yesterday than today." The doctor tells Yesterday that her illness is AIDS-related and that she probably got it from her husband, who is away working in a mine. After hearing the news, Yesterday is very upset. Yesterday understands that she will die from this disease, leaving her daughter alone.  She makes a plan to travel to the mine where her husband, John, works to tell him the news and to tell him that he also is sick. He reacts to this news very badly and beats her, while his supervisor looks in and then looks away. Yesterday goes home and tries to continue living her life as best she can. She asks her teacher friend to take care of Beauty when she dies. A few months later John comes home to her. He is very ill from AIDS-related illnesses and begs Yesterday's forgiveness for blaming her and for beating her for telling him the truth. He explains that he has been fired from the mine, as he is now incontinent and there are no toilets down in the mine, so all day he would stink "like an animal". The other villagers, who do not understand HIV/AIDS, protest at having John living amongst them and say that he must leave or go to hospital. Yesterday tried to get her husband into a nearby clinic but was unsuccessful, as there were no available beds for him and he would need to be put on a waiting list. Due to this, she sets out to make her own hospital on a nearby hill. Using sheet metal and pieces of old cars and taxis, she puts together a building, which she then helps her husband to with her daughter's assistance.  As they are making the laborious journey to the "hospital", John comments that when he was young he could run from one end of this field to the other and not think of it, now it seems like the longest journey of his life. Yesterday and Beauty take care of him as well as they can until he dies. Yesterday's focus then falls on preparing Beauty for school. Yesterday never went to school, so her single goal becomes living long enough to be able to see Beauty attend. When the doctor tells her she has a strong body that keeps the illness somewhat under control she replies it's not the body but her mind. Yesterday watches as her daughter starts her first day at school and then walks off as the camera pans back from her.

Zapata: El sueño de un héroe
 The film happens in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first nineteen years of the twentieth, during the dictatorship of [[Porfirio Díaz]], the presidency of [[Francisco I. Madero]], the military revolt of [[Victoriano Huerta]], the Convention of Generals and, finally, the death of Zapata, already in the constitutionalist stage of [[Venustiano Carranza]]. The film does not try to be a chair of history but a fable that obtains the identification of the spectators with the hero, through the successive confrontation of the protagonist with the power, represented in the antagonistic figure of Victoriano Huerta. In it, [[Emiliano Zapata]] appears like predestining, "the signal" in his chest, the mark or spot with the form of a little hand is the sign that identifies him as "the one" by the Huehuetlatolli (the heirs of the tradition) to be their guide. Thus, we see the birth of Emiliano, where he is recognized like the possible leader of his town. Zapata will have to break with his vision of the "real reality" and to enter in that other magical knowledge of the Mexican tradition and its inscrutable religious "sincretismo".
