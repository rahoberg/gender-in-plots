 Bree ([[Nora-Jane Noone]]), decides to go for a swim at the Ketea Aquatic Center. The pool manager, McGradey (played by [[Tobin_Bell|Tobin Bell]]), later hangs signs around the pool mentioning that the pool is closing up for the holiday. Bree is later joined by her sister, Johanna (Alexandra Park) in the pool and connect over a competition in college.  Meanwhile, the janitor of the aquatic center, Clara (Diane Farr) is caught by McGradey attempting to steal from the lost and found. She is later laid off and is told to clean up before leaving.  McGradey then eagerly tells all swimmers to leave as they prepare to close. Bree and Johanna reluctantly do so. While packing up, Bree realizes that her engagement ring is missing, after attempting to show Johanna. Johanna sees the ring stuck in the metal grate at the bottom of the pool and both dive in to retrieve it.  The manager thinks everyone has left the pool and decides to close up, failing to notice the girls in the deep end of the pool. He engages the pool cover and leaves for the day with the two girls trapped inside the pool.  The girls are terrified and unsuccessfully attempt to escape. Shortly afterward, Johanna reveals that she is secretly jealous of Bree's successful lifestyle and recent engagement and that she pulled the ring from Bree's bag and threw it in the pool. Bree is initially angry with her sister but her anger is short-lived. Bree also talks about her past with her abusive alcoholic and drug addicted father. She also opens up about the fire which led to his death. Bree reveals that she is diabetic and requires a shot, or there is a possibility that she might slip into a diabetic coma.  The janitor, preparing to leave, is surprised to see the two girls trapped underneath the pool cover. Leading the girls to believe she is going to help them, she picks up Bree's bag, taking her cash, smartphone and credit card. The janitor then proceeds to blackmail her for the password to her phone and her credit card pin number. She later turns the water heater off. The girls have no choice but to wait out the night. Johanna talks about the deep mental damage from her abusive father with Bree saying, "Just keep reminding yourself that he's dead."  The janitor comes back in the morning teasing the girls again. Johanna, angry at her, leads the janitor to place her ear onto the small hole in the pool cover, subsequently stabbing her in the ear with a sharp shard of tile. The janitor then turns on the automatic pool cleaning system, causing the girls to begin suffocating in chlorine. After a few minutes, she turns this off, realising the danger in her action.     When the janitor leaves again, Johanna apologises to Bree for her jealousy and keeps blaming herself for the situation they're in. Bree comforts her and forgives her for her wrongdoings. Bree reveals that during the accident which killed their father, she actually prevented her dad from escaping and in fact, helped kill her father.  The janitor comes back, realising the error of her ways. She decides to open up the pool cover to let the girls out but the pass code she was given by the manager no longer works, leaving the girls to remain trapped. She tells the girls they're on their own and leaves.  Bree soon grows very weak and cold, passing in and out of consciousness. After initially refusing Bree's offer to try, Johanna spends her last bits of energy trying to rip off the metal grill on the bottom of the pool, something her sister failed to do. After succeeding, Johanna smashes the fiberglass of the pool cover, allowing them to escape. She then pulled Bree, unconscious, out of the pool and gives her the insulin shot, unsure whether she will survive. The janitor appears in front of them with a gun. She threatens to kill the girls after thinking about what might happen if they didn't die in the pool, not wanting to go to prison again. The janitor instead feels sympathetic for the girls and puts the gun down and gives them their belongings back. Johanna, after calling the police, tells her to leave.  Paramedics arrive at the aquatic center and tend to Bree. Johanna gives her her engagement ring back, which the janitor blackmailed Bree for with the intention of pawning it. Bree asked how she got it back to which Johnna replies, "I killed the monster", referring back to what Bree said about killing their father.

47 Meters Down
 Lisa ([[Mandy Moore]]) and Kate ([[Claire Holt]]) are sisters on vacation in [[Mexico]]. Lisa's boyfriend broke up with her because "she made the relationship boring". Kate tries to cheer Lisa up and takes her out drinking and dancing at 4:00 am.  The sisters meet a pair of local men at a bar and they  convince them to go out with them on their boat to watch sharks from a diving cage.  Lisa hesitates but Kate persuades her saying it would show Lisa's boyfriend that she isn't boring and make him regret breaking up with her.  The sisters arrive at the boat dock. At first sight, the boat is lackluster and Lisa is immediately wary of it and its owner, Captain Taylor.  Upon meeting the girls, the captain asks if the sisters are experienced divers. Kate is a certified diver but Lisa is new to diving, so they lie and say they are both experienced.  The dive cage is old and rusty and hangs from a thin chains from an old crane, adding further to Lisa's apprehensions.  As they reach the diving spot, Captain Taylor baits the sharks. Lisa is skeptical about the entire dive, but Captain Taylor dismisses her concerns. The locals dive first in the cage. Unbeknownst to everyone on the boat, the cable supporting the cage starts to fray. The men return to the surface and Captain Taylor prepares to send Lisa and Kate down. When Lisa and Kate are in the cage, the cable breaks and the cage sinks to the bottom, some 47 meters below the surface and out of communication range with the boat. Kate swims up seven meters to resume communications with Captain Taylor, who tells her Javier ([[Chris J. Johnson]]) will be coming down with a spare winch to pull them up. He also advises them to stay in the cage as the sharks are circling. Both women are quickly running out of air, but they wait in the cage until they see a torch in the distance. Thinking that Javier cannot see them, Lisa swims out to get him, as Kate's air is lower due to the previous swim. Lisa swims towards the light, close to the bottom to avoid shark attacks from the below. A shark tries to attack Lisa but she swims into a small grotto to avoid it. Continuing to go towards the light, she comes to a crevasse with no bottom in sight.  Swimming over the cliff towards the light she finds the torch but not Javier. While looking around, she gets confused about her distance from the cage and Kate. Just as Javier appears and attempts to usher her back towards safety, he is attacked and killed by a shark. Lisa takes Javier's spear gun and the spare winch, and swims back towards the cage. With the newly acquired torch as well as the spear gun, Lisa swims up and notifies Taylor to pull them up. Disaster strikes as they are being winched to safety: The replacement winch line also snaps and the cage sinks back to the bottom. The cage lands on Lisa's leg, pinning her down. Lisa and Kate panic as they realize they are now both out of options and air.  Kate swims back up to communication range to tell Taylor they are low on air and that Lisa is pinned down. Taylor sends some air tanks down and tells them the [[Maritime Search and Rescue (Mexico)|Mexican coast guard]] is an hour out. He also warns her that the second tank may cause [[nitrogen narcosis]] which can lead to [[hallucinations]]. Kate finds the air tanks just as her original tank runs empty. She also finds three flares to signal the coast guard.  As she returns to the cage, Kate is attacked and presumably killed by a shark. Lisa, still pinned and running low on air, uses the spear from the spear gun to pull the tank towards her. In the process, the spear cuts her hand. She dons the new tank, and then hears Kate over the radio. Kate is injured and low on air, and her blood is attracting more sharks. Lisa says she will find her, and uses her [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|BCD]] to lift up the cage, freeing her leg. After Lisa finds Kate, Taylor tells them the coast guard is still some time out and they need to get back in the cage. Lisa adamantly refuses due to the nature of Kate's wounds, and they decide to swim to the surface. As they swim to the surface, they use one of the three flares to scare the sharks. At the 20-meter mark, they are reminded by Taylor they must wait five minutes to [[Decompression (diving)|decompress]] and avoid [[Decompression sickness|the bends]]. As the first flare burns out, Kate tries to light the second flare but drops it and it sinks to the bottom. As she lights the third flare she sees three sharks close in front of her. The sisters are now surrounded by sharks and must rush to the surface.  Taylor yells for them to drop their gear and make a break for the surface. They swim as fast as they can towards the surface close to the boat. As they cling to a life ring to get to the boat, one of the sharks bites Lisa's leg and pulls her back down into the water. Lisa manages to escape and starts to swim towards the boat again. Both women make it to the boat and reach up to get pulled in. As they are getting pulled in a shark jumps out of the water and grabs Lisa by the leg, pulling her down again. The shark starts to viciously bite into Lisa’s leg but Lisa hits the shark and gouges its eye out and the shark releases her. Captain Taylor and the other men pull Lisa and Kate onto the boat and begin administering first aid. However, as Lisa stares at her hand on the deck of the boat, she realizes she has been hallucinating due to nitrogen narcosis. She realizes she is still at the bottom with her leg pinned by the cage. She laughs and imagines that she is talking to Kate on the boat deck. The coast guard comes to rescue her and carries Lisa to the surface without Kate. Lisa, as she is slowly and cautiously being brought to the surface, comes out of her hallucination, and realizes her sister is not with her. She starts to cry and call out to Kate, realizing her little sister was killed by the shark when she retrieved the air tanks.  
68 Kill
 Chip is a timid sewer worker who is at the beck and call of his bombshell girlfriend, Liza. Liza is repeatedly abusive towards Chip in their relationship, but he is convinced that he is in love with her. One day, Liza's landlord, Ken Mckenzie, shows her a safe that contains $68,000. Liza is unhappy with her life as a prostitute and convinces Chip to steal the $68,000 with her. The two sneak into the Mckenzies' house, armed and masked. Chip's apprehension of the mission is increased when he sees Liza kill the Mckenzies, who witnessed the two burglars in the house. During their heist, a young girl named Violet sees Chip with the Mckenzies' bodies and flees. Liza knocks Violet out cold and plans to sell her to her brother Dwayne, who will presumably torture and kill Violet.   Disgusted by Liza's plan, Chip knocks out Liza when she goes to get Violet from the trunk of their car. He shoots at a bypasser who sees, then at Dwayne, and drives away with the money. Liza regains consciousness and chases after Chip, getting him to pull over. She tells him that she forgives him as long as he stays with her, but then loses consciousness again on the side of the road. Chip leaves her there and keeps driving away, until he hears Violet's voice from the trunk and remembers his hostage. When he goes to release her, she subdues him and holds him at gunpoint. With no other option, he decides to take Violet with him to flee with the money. Both are attracted to the other, as they bond over music and jokes in the car. On their trip, a police officer pulls them over, but Violet manages to talk their way out of the policeman inspecting the car further. Chip is impressed at her quick thinking, and the two further bond.  They take a stop at a gas station, where the clerk, Monica, sees Chip pull out a $100 bill from the envelope of the stolen money. She convinces him to give her more money for her to keep quiet, but Violet steps in and refuses for Chip. The two spend the night at a nearby hotel, where Violet tearfully explains that she was at the Mckenzies' that night because Mckenzie was forcing her to have sex with him for money. The two make love that night, seemingly safe.  The morning after, Chip wakes up to find his gun, money, and clothes stolen. Frantic, he is mad at himself for letting his guard down around Violet, who he assumes stole his possessions. He discovers her dead body in the bathtub of the room, horrified. Chip asks the man working at the hotel to use his phone to call Liza, since he thinks she is the one behind Violet's murder. The man working tells Chip a description of one of the people at his room the night before, which Chip connects to the gas station worker, Monica. Chip reluctantly incapacitates the man, finds some clothes from the lost-and-found, and steals his car. He goes to the gas station, where the employee working tells Chip where Monica is.  When Chip arrives at the house, it is revealed he has been set up, as the employee was a friend of Monica's. He is taken inside, where one of the men in the house holds him at gunpoint. Chip tries to escape, but is knocked unconscious. Monica explains how and why she robbed Chip and framed him for Violet's death, even though her plan has many faults in it. Monica's group beats Chip while taking drugs that they bought with the stolen money. Chip eventually loses consciousness and has a vision of Violet, who tells him to wake up. When he does, he finds Liza is there, with a gun pointed at his face. Monica and one of her cohorts come out from the bedroom, and threaten Liza. Suddenly, Liza's brother (Dwayne) enters the room, and kills almost all of Monica's gang. With Liza and her brother now in control of the situation, Dwayne orders the two surviving members of Monica's gang (Monica and another woman) into the bedroom, where he rapes and kills one of them, leaving Monica as the only survivor from her original gang. Liza tells Chip that all is forgiven, as long as he still acts as her dog. He refuses, shoots and kills her, then goes into the bedroom to kill Dwayne. Monica thanks Chip for saving her from Dwayne "the pervert", and tells him that she will do anything that she wants her to do. He informs her that he wants her to bring the deceased Violet back to life, and then shoots and kills her (to avenge Monica's murdering of Violet in the first place.) Chip stages the scene to erase his presence at the house, takes the money, and escapes as the cops are driving to the direction of the house. On the side of the road, Chip spots a beautiful woman with her car broken down. He considers picking her up, but ultimately speeds far away from her, content with his independence and the money.

In 1922, Wilf is a farmer living in [[Hemingford Home, Nebraska]] with his wife, Arlette ([[Molly Parker]]) and their 14-year-old son Henry (Dylan Schmid). Wilf and Arlette have been arguing over whether to sell land Arlette recently inherited. Arlette wants to sell out completely and move to Omaha to open up a dress shop. They discuss divorce, and Arlette is adamant that Henry will be coming with her. Wilf decides to convince Henry to help him murder his mother to prevent him from being taken away, holding Henry's love interest Shannon (Kaitlyn Bernard) at stake. Henry reluctantly agrees to assist his father in carrying out the murder.  Wilf pretends to agree to the sale, appeasing Arlette. She decides to celebrate, and becomes inebriated. After carrying her to bed in a drunken stupor, Henry covers her face while Wilf cuts her throat with a butcher's knife. Wilf intends to bury Arlette in one of his corn fields; however Henry collapses from the ordeal, prompting Wilf to dump her body into a dry well where her corpse is soon fed upon by rats. The next day, they drop a cow into the well to hide Arlette's body as well as provide a reason for filling in the well. However, Sheriff Jones ([[Brian d'Arcy James]]) is suspicious following her sudden disappearance. While searching the house, he questions Wilf about Arlette, with Wilf stating she left them on her own accord. Finding no proof of a crime, Sheriff Jones leaves Wilf's farm, tentatively believing Wilf's details of his wife's departure.  Henry becomes brooding and isolated, causing his girlfriend Shannon to grow increasingly concerned. He starts to regret the crime he and his father have committed. Shannon is subsequently discovered to be several months pregnant with their unborn child. Her parents decide she is to be sent away to a Catholic institution in Omaha until the baby is born and can be given up for adoption. However, Henry steals Wilf's car, arrives in Omaha and runs away with Shannon.  As winter passes by, Wilf's house becomes infested with rats and his hand becomes infected after a vicious rat bite. He sees an [[Ghost|apparition]] of his dead wife who regales him with details of Henry's series of robberies he commits with Shannon, calling themselves "The Sweetheart Bandits." During one of their heists, Shannon is shot in the abdomen, causing her to lose the baby and ultimately dying shortly after from massive blood loss. After finding his girlfriend dead, Henry lies down next to her and, full of grief, kills himself with the handgun he used to rob his victims.  Wilf's hand, by this point severely infected from the rat bite, is amputated in the hospital. Later, an unidentified woman's body is found on the side of the road which the sheriff reckons might be that of Arlette. Henry's body is delivered to Wilf, which, like his mother's body, has been chewed through by rats. Wilf attempts to sell his land to Shannon's father ([[Neal McDonough]]), who bluntly tells Wilf to leave his property and never come back. Wilf moves to Omaha to find work, but cannot escape being followed by rats.  Eight years later, in 1930, Wilf writes his confession, stating, "In the end, we all get caught." By this point, dozens of rats have swarmed his room. Arlette, Henry, and Shannon's corpses have appeared in front of the frightened Wilf. Brandishing the same butcher's knife used to kill his mother, Henry tells Wilf that his death will be quick.

His sister requests him to find an accommodation for her friend, Swati, as she is transferred to Bangalore. However, upon meeting her, he is smitten and asks her hand in marriage which she accepts. Meanwhile, a gang of goons loyal to Shetty demands that Arun sell his plot of land to them.  Though his parents are not happy with Swati's proposal, he convinces them to meet her parents to fix the wedding. However, they put forth a condition that Arun's sister's wedding should also happen along with his but she refuses to get married until she gets a bank job. As the fixed date approaches, tensions between the families rise as there is a lack of enthusiasm from Arun's family's side. During a heated argument, Arun's mother calls off the wedding. However, due to Arun's and Swati's persistence, they get married to each other while the families hide their displeasure.  Swati's family gifts the new couple a wooden wardrobe as per the tradition and Arun's mother starts to complain that it is taking up too much space. After moving to Bangalore, Swati nags at Arun to bring the wardrobe to their new house and he reluctantly agrees. Both the families begin to interfere in their lives which lead to petty problems and issues between them. Arun's lawyer requests him to submit the documents related to the disputed plot of land but he realises that it is in the wardrobe which is locked by Swati who is in Mumbai for training. Without any other option, he and friends contact a thief to break the wardrobe's lock and retrieve it. After they are submitted at the police station, the police officer sides with Shetty and argues that the documents are fake. Shetty and his gang encroach the plot but is assaulted and scared off by Arun and friends, with the help of some goons arranged by his uncle.  When Swati returns, she notices that the wardrobe lock is broken and her necklace is stolen. She confronts Arun which leads to a huge fight between them. In addition, Shetty threatens to kill them if he doesn't let go of the plot and leave Bangalore which scares Swati. Swati leaves him and moves back to Kerala. They attend a marriage counselling session which doesn't become successful as their parents don't co-operate. As a result, they get divorced.  Some time later, they both see other potential partners. Afraid of committing to another woman and meeting the same fate as before, he decides to reconcile with Swati. They restart their married life with their parents' approval but by keeping them at a distance.  
The Age of Pioneers
 The film is set in the 1960s, during the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]] between [[USSR]] and the [[United States]]. The Soviets plan to send a man into space. During the construction of the craft, a technician is killed and the engineers question the safety of the craft. A test vehicle, representing the Voskhod 2 spacecraft is destroyed two weeks before the official launch and Soviet engineers cannot identify the causes of the explosion and sudden loss of communication. Ex-WW2 pilot, [[Pavel Belyayev]], and military test pilot [[Alexey Leonov]] are called to man the Voskhod 2 craft but during a skydive, Pavel injuries his leg landing and is not considered fit; instead, he is replaced by a new, young and immature cosmonaut ([[Yevgeny Khrunov]]), much to the dismay of Alex. Fuelled by anger and determination, Pavel trains himself to become stronger and eventually is re-admitted into the space program, much to the delight of Alexey.  The Voskhod 2 launches into space and Alexey is ordered to commence his spacewalk. The spacewalk is successful and the Soviets celebrate but Alexey's suit begins to inflate, rendering him inflexible and unable to enter the airlock. The ship loses communication with ground control when it enters a dead zone. Alexey defies instructions and enters the airlock head first but the outer hatch fails to fully close. He forces himself to turn within the airlock and manages to close the airlock right before his oxygen supply runs out and he passes out. Pavel drags him into the pod and succeeds in reviving him. The two are then instructed to orbit for 22 hours until Cycle 4, an automatic system that will land them. Pavel detaches the airlock, but it causes the Voskhod 2 to spin slightly. Before Cycle 4, Pavel and Alexey begin to feel queasy and find that the oxygen partial pressure is uncommonly high. Ground control states that the system mistakenly detected a leak and began pumping pure oxygen into the cabin. They are told to find and disconnect a yellow wire to disable the system.  Pavel passes out from [[oxygen toxicity]], and Alexey takes control, reaching for the wire. The oxygen causes Alexey to hallucinate about his times as a young boy, running in a field, searching for the nest of a bird. He manages to twist the yellow wire but passes out before it is disconnected. During his hallucination, he remembers of reaching out to the bird who injured him, this moment in his hallucination causes him to flinch and disconnect the yellow wire. The system stops pumping oxygen into the cabin.  Both cosmonauts awake to find that Cycle 4 has failed to run and Soviet engineers and mathematicians on the ground fail to respond with an explanation, concluding that the spin of the craft may have caused the problem. The cosmonauts are permitted to use manual mode to re-direct the ship. After Pavel successfully stabilizes the craft, it re-enters the atmosphere and is detached from the instrument section. The craft lands by parachute into the Ural mountain range, far from the expected landing site. A search party is sent after the cosmonauts, but their radio signals are not picked up. A radio fan on Sakhalin accidentally picks up their radio signals and phones the Space Agency, notifying them of the cosmonauts' position. A nearby rescue helicopter is ordered to search for them but is unable to see them due to severe weather conditions. The helicopter is called back to base, but with the cosmonauts close to death, the crew spot Alexey's flare and come down to rescue them.  The two cosmonauts arrive by plane to the Agency to meet with their wives and children. Later they are paraded through Moscow where countless civilians cheer them.

Alien: Covenant
  In a prologue, [[business magnate]] [[List of Alien characters#Peter Weyland|Peter Weyland]] speaks with his newly activated [[Android (robot)|android]], who chooses the name "[[David 8|David]]" after observing [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo’s statue of David]]. Weyland tells David that one day they will search for mankind's creator together. David comments on his own unlimited lifespan compared to his creator's limited one, which unsettles Weyland.  In 2104, 11 years after the ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' expedition, the [[Space colonization|colonization]] ship ''Covenant'' is bound for remote planet Origae-6, with two thousand colonists in [[Cryopreservation|stasis]] and 1,140 human [[embryo]]s aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A neutrino blast damages the ship, killing 47 colonists. Walter orders the ship's computer to wake the crew of 15, which includes several married couples. The ship's captain, Jake Branson, dies when his stasis pod malfunctions and he is burned alive inside the pod. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission of a human voice from a nearby planet, which appears eminently more habitable than Origae-6 (still 7 years away). Despite the protests of Daniels, Branson’s widow, that this new "perfect" planet is too good to be true, newly-promoted captain Oram decides that they are going to divert and check the new planet.  With pilot Tennessee maintaining ''Covenant'' in orbit, his wife Maggie flies a small lander to the Earth-like planet's surface, where an expedition team tracks the transmission's signal to a crashed alien ship. Crew members Ledward and Hallett are infected by spores from a black fungus-like organism. Oram's wife Karine helps the increasingly ill Ledward back to the lander where Maggie quarantines them inside the med-bay. A small, pale, alien [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Neomorph|neomorph]] bursts from Ledward's back, killing him, and then kills Karine. Maggie attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. Nearby, another neomorph bursts from Hallett's mouth, killing him as well.  The neomorphs attack the remaining crew and kill Ankor. The crew manages to kill a neomorph before David, who survived the ''Prometheus'' mission, scares away the other, and leads the crew to a temple in a city full of dead humanoids. David tells them that upon his and fellow ''Prometheus'' survivor [[List of Alien characters#Elizabeth Shaw|Elizabeth Shaw's]] arrival at the planet, their ship released a black liquid bio-weapon which annihilated the native population and that Shaw died when the ship crashed in the ensuing chaos. The crew members attempt to contact the ''Covenant'' but are prevented by fierce storms. When a neomorph infiltrates the structure and kills Rosenthal, David tries to communicate with the creature, and is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram questions David, who reveals that the aliens are a result of his experimenting with the black liquid in an attempt to create a new species. He manipulates Oram into being attacked by a [[facehugger]] alien. An alien [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] later erupts from Oram's chest, killing him.  As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter finds Shaw's [[dissection|dissected]] corpse, used by David as material for his evolving creature designs. David explains that he believes humans are a dying species and should not be allowed to [[Space colonization|colonize]] the galaxy. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, and threatens Daniels. Walter recovers (being a superior model capable of self-repair) and fights with David while Daniels escapes. A facehugger attacks security chief Lope, but he is later rescued by crew member Cole. The now fully grown Xenomorph kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who claims David has "expired". They successfully kill the attacking Xenomorph and return to the ''Covenant''.  The next morning, Daniels and Tennessee find out that another Xenomorph burst from Lope's chest, killing him, and is loose on the ''Covenant''. It matures, and kills crew members Ricks and his wife Upworth. Remaining crew members Tennessee and Daniels lure the creature into the ''Covenant''s [[terraforming]] bay and flush it into space.  The ''Covenant'' resumes its trip to Origae-6. As Walter helps Daniels into stasis, she realizes that he is in fact David, but is unable to escape her pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos and places them in [[Refrigeration|cold storage]] alongside the human embryos. He then poses as Walter to record a log stating that all crewmembers except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the neutrino blast at the beginning of the film and that the ship is still on course for Origae-6.

All the Money in the World
 In 1973, 16-year-old [[John Paul Getty III]] (AKA Paul), grandson of oil tycoon [[J. Paul Getty]] who was at that time the world's richest private citizen, is kidnapped in [[Rome]] by an organized crime ring. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $17 million. Flashbacks show that Paul's parents, Gail Harris and [[John Paul Getty Jr.]], were divorced in 1971 due to Getty Jr.'s drug addiction and that Gail rejected any alimony in exchange for full custody of her children in the divorce settlement; therefore she does not have the means to pay the ransom. She travels to Getty's estate to beseech him to pay the ransom but he refuses, stating that it would encourage further kidnappings on his family members. The media picks up on the story, with many believing Gail to be rich herself and blaming her for the refusal to pay the ransom. Meanwhile, Getty asks Fletcher Chace, a Getty Oil negotiator and former CIA operative, to investigate the case and secure Paul's release.  Paul is kept hostage in a remote location in [[Italy]]. Initially his captors, particularly Cinquanta, are tolerant with him because his quiet and submissive demeanor causes them few problems. However, things grow increasingly tense as weeks go by without the ransom being paid, far longer than the captors anticipated. Arguments arise over whether to move Paul to a new location as winter is approaching and their hideout is not suitable for cold conditions. Things get worse when one of the kidnappers accidentally shows his face to Paul, prompting one of the others to kill the man for his foolish mistake. His burned and disfigured body is recovered in the river; investigators erroneously identify the body as Paul's, but Gail examines the body and refutes this.  Using the new lead of the body, Chace is able to pinpoint the hideout where Paul is being held. A raid is conducted with several kidnappers being killed, but Paul is no longer there; he had been sold on to a new crime organization. The new captors are much less patient with Paul and negotiate more aggressively with the Getty family to receive their payment. After repeated negotiations with Gail and Chace, and frustration from the captors at how long the process was taking, they lower the asking price to $4 million. Getty finally decides to contribute to the ransom, but only $1 million – this being the maximum amount that he can claim as tax deductible. Moreover, he also will only do so if Gail signs a legal document waiving her parental access rights to Paul and her other children, giving them to Getty's son, her ex-husband. She reluctantly signs them.  The kidnappers cut off one of Paul's ears and mail it to a major newspaper, claiming that they will continue mutilating him until the ransom is paid. Berated by an exasperated Chace, Getty finally relents and agrees to pay the full ransom, also voiding the parental agreement with Gail. Gail and Chace take the money to Italy and follow specific instructions from the captors, leaving the money in a remote location and receiving orders to pick up Paul from a construction site. However, a frightened Paul runs away from the site towards the nearest town, miles away. Meanwhile the captors realize that Chace has broken his word and led the police to them; angry, they decide to find and kill Paul. Chace, Gail, and the captors arrive at the town to look for Paul. One of the kidnappers finds Paul first, but Cinquanta attacks the man in order to allow Paul to escape. Chace and Gail find Paul and smuggle him out of the country to safety.  Getty dies of unrelated causes, and Gail is tasked with managing her children's inherited wealth until they are of age. The company was set up as a charitable trust, which meant that Getty's income was tax-free but also not spendable. He had invested much of it in paintings, sculptures and other artifacts, most of them now reside in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles.

Moments after Katrina accepts Mitch's proposal of marriage, a jihadist cell lands on the beach and begins to attack the civilians with assault rifles. Amid the carnage, Rapp frantically attempts to find Katrina, but his fiancée is killed by the terrorists.  Eighteen months later, Rapp, now consumed by his desire for vengeance, frequents an internet message board where the terrorist responsible for his girlfriend's murder quizzes Rapp on aspects of Islam and jihad. Having secured an invitation to meet him face to face in Libya, Rapp prepares to take his vengeance on the man responsible for his girlfriend's death, but before he can kill the terrorist, the cell is suddenly ambushed by [[U.S. Special Forces]]. Upset over the perception that he has been denied his vengeance, Rapp repeatedly stabs the terrorist he was after, who is already dead from the ambush, before being dragged out by the U.S. forces. In a CIA safe house Rapp undergoes 30 days of debriefing before being offered a chance by CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy to join a black operations unit code-named Orion. Its head, Stan Hurley, is a former [[U.S. Navy SEAL]] and a [[Cold War]] veteran who trains Rapp and the other potential recruits in [[asymmetric warfare]].  Elsewhere, word comes down through intelligence channels that weapons grade nuclear material has gone missing from a decommissioned Russian nuclear facility. The material in question appears to be heading to Iranian hardliners, who are upset with the Iranian government's [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with the U.S.]] While verifying the sale of the nuclear material in Poland the plutonium is intercepted by a third party, who eliminates the sellers before vanishing into the crowd. In Virginia, Hurley sees news reports about the incident in Poland and tentatively identifies the perpetrator as a former Navy SEAL and Orion operative believed to have been killed in action and now going by the code-name "Ghost". Hurley's team is sent into [[Turkey]] to intercept the buyer Ghost is working for.  In [[Istanbul]], Hurley's team is identified, and the attempted intercept of the trigger device fails. Rapp pursues the buyer to his apartment, and after killing the man, retrieves his laptop. The information leads the team to Rome, where Orion operatives identify a nuclear physicist needed to craft the nuclear material into a functional nuclear weapon. While in Rome, Rapp uncovers a co-worker, Annika, as a foreign agent for Iran. She explains that she is working for the mainstream Iranian faction which is attempting to stop the hardliners from acquiring nuclear material. During a meeting between Hurley and an Iranian contact, Ghost ambushes them and kills the contact and captures Hurley.  At the CIA safe house in [[Rome]], Annika is being moved under guard by two [[Mossad]] agents when Rapp intercepts the car and frees her. Working together, both locate the subterranean headquarters Ghost is using to build the nuclear device. After infiltrating the tunnels, Rapp locates and frees a badly injured Hurley, however Annika is captured by Ghost and she kills herself with Ghost's gun before Ghost escapes onto a boat with the nuke. Based on an earlier conversation, Hurley deduces that Ghost intends to make a kamikaze attack against the [[United States Sixth Fleet|U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet]]. Rapp chases after Ghost's boat, while the Sixth Fleet, alerted to the impending nuclear attack through CIA channels, prepares for the attack.  Aboard Ghost's boat, Rapp kills Ghost and attempts to divert the boat away from the Sixth Fleet to shield the ships from the blast, before throwing the nuclear weapon into the sea and escaping aboard a U.S. Navy helicopter. Seconds later the device detonates, creating a massive sink hole and subsequent [[tsunami]] that inundates the Sixth Fleet vessels, but the fleet survives the blast.  In the aftermath of the blast, Hurley is recovering from his injuries and notes that Rapp is on vacation in Dubai, while watching news reports indicating that the Iranian faction which tried to obtain the nuclear weapon will win the presidential election. In Dubai, the faction candidate and his escorts enter an elevator in which Rapp is already present, smiling.

One night, Belle invites acquaintances Terrence—an enthusiast on the Amityville haunting—and Marissa, over to watch ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979) at the house. At 3:15am in the middle of the film, the power goes out, and the three go into the basement to locate the fuse box, where they are confronted by Joan, who thinks they are intruders.  Dr. Milton, who suspects James may have [[locked-in syndrome]], performs tests on James that show increased function; during the test, he witnesses an apparition of flies filling the room and attacking him, and leaves the house, shaken. James quickly gains the ability to communicate with the family via an [[Augmentative and alternative communication|AAC computer system]] that allows him to type by looking at the letters on a screen. Terrence suggests to Belle that James's sudden revival may be a result of [[Demonic possession|possession]] stemming from the house; he and Belle suspect that a ring on the ground surrounding the house may represent a [[magic circle]].  Belle asks James if someone else is inhabiting his body, and he replies "yes" and "help" via the computer. He asks her to kill him, and she begins to unplug the machine, but he suddenly attacks her. Joan enters the room, and finds that James is now breathing on his own. After finding the [[The Amityville Horror#Red Room|red room]] in the basement, which she believes to be the source of the power, Belle confronts her mother with the theory that the house is possessing James. Joan reveals to her that, having lost her faith in [[God]] after the death of her husband and James's subsequent accident, she moved the family to the home hoping to harness the demonic energy there in order to bring James back to life.  That night, as Belle prepares to leave, Joan knocks her unconscious. Belle awakens at 3:15am, just as her aunt Candice arrives at the house. James rises from his bed, and harnesses energy from the red room, which revitalizes his body. Belle makes her way downstairs as Candice enters the house, but James shoots Candice with a shotgun. Belle retrieves Juliet from her room, but is unable to open the front door. Joan is confronted by James in her bedroom; knowing she is facing death, she retrieves her [[crucifix]], and holds it toward James, but he is unaffected; he reminds her that with the loss of her faith in God, He is not able to save her. He shoots Joan in the chest before throwing her on her bed and shooting her in the head. James is able to lure Juliet to the third floor, where he attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Belle, who tackles him, resulting in them both falling from the window. She drags James outside the circle, after which his body withers, and he dies just after telling her "thank you."  A newsreel epilogue reveals that Belle is being questioned in the murders of her mother, aunt, and brother, but that her sister, Juliet, corroborates her story, and that James's fingerprints were discovered on the murder weapon. Another news report comments on yet another tragedy occurring in the Amityville house.  
American Made (film)
 In 1978, [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] pilot [[Barry Seal]], who flies commercial jets for [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]], is recruited by a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] case officer calling himself Monty Schafer. He asks Seal, who has been smuggling [[Cuban cigar]]s into the country via Canada, to fly clandestine reconnaissance missions for the CIA over Central America using a small plane with cameras installed.  Later in the 1980s, Schafer asks Seal to start acting as a courier between the CIA and [[Manuel Noriega|General Noriega]] in [[Panama]]. During a mission, the [[Medellín Cartel]] picks Seal up and asks him to fly cocaine on his return flights to the United States. Seal accepts and starts flying the cartel's cocaine to [[Louisiana]]. The CIA turns a blind eye to the drug smuggling, but the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] tracks Seal down. To avoid the authorities, Schafer moves Seal and his family to the remote town of [[Mena, Arkansas]].  Later, Schafer asks Seal to run guns to the [[Contras|Nicaraguan Contras based in Honduras, Central America]]. Seal soon realizes that the Contras are not serious about the war and just want to get rich and he starts trading the guns to the cartel. The CIA sets up a Contra training base in Mena and Seal flies the Contras in, but many of them escape as soon as they arrive.  Seal makes so much money he buries it in suitcases in the backyard. Seal's freeloading brother-in-law JB moves in, needing a job. Eventually, he starts stealing money from the Seals and is arrested after Sheriff Downing catches him with a briefcase full of laundered cash. Seal gives him money and a plane ticket to [[Bora Bora]] and tells him to get lost. JB demands weekly cash and insults Lucy, Seal's wife. Barry tries to chase him but JB's car explodes; it is implied [[Jorge Ochoa Vasquez|Jorge Ochoa]] had JB's car rigged with explosives, killing him so that he would not snitch.  Eventually, the CIA shuts the program down and abandons Seal, who is arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], DEA, [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] and [[Arkansas State Police]] simultaneously. Seal escapes prosecution by making a deal with the White House, which wants evidence the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] are drug traffickers. They ask Seal to get photos that tie the Medellín Cartel to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. Seal manages to get the pictures, but the White House releases them as propaganda against the Sandinistas. Seal is prominently shown in the pictures, which leads to his arrest, and to the cartel plotting revenge.  Seal is convicted but given a light sentence, a total of 1,000 hours community service for the [[Salvation Army]]. Moving from motel to motel fails as a way of remaining in hiding because the community service is performed at the same building every night. Assassins sent by [[Pablo Escobar]] and the cartel easily locate Seal and kill him; the CIA then destroys all documentation and other evidence to avoid being implicated in drug smuggling. Even after Seal is dead and the evidence is destroyed, the CIA still becomes embroiled in the infamous [[Iran–Contra affair]].

Alarmed, Sister Charlotte speaks with the disfigured Esther, who is confined to her bedroom. Esther explains that after Bee's death, they prayed to whatever entity would grant their wish to see their daughter again. An unknown entity answered their prayer and though they briefly see Bee's spirit again, the entity convinces them to transfer its essence into one of Samuel's crafted porcelain dolls. They happily agree but soon realise that they have attracted a [[demon]] looking for a human host. One night, Esther sees Bee's spirit, along with the porcelain doll, transforming into the demon, who gouges out her left eye. Enlisting the help of priests to bless both the room and the house, they take the doll to Bee's room and lock it in a closet wallpapered with pages from the Bible. Esther then reveals that she and Samuel opened their house as a shelter for the orphans to repent of their dealings but now regrets it, since she realises that this has provided an opportunity for the demon to look for a human host.  The demon crucifies Esther and bisects her body and slams Sister Charlotte against the wall, prompting the other orphans to leave the house. Linda is trapped in the house and hides in Bee's room as the possessed Janice tries to stab her. Sister Charlotte recovers and locks the possessed Janice and the doll inside the closet. The next day, police arrive to search the house and its surroundings and find only the doll inside the bedroom closet, which they remove as evidence.

Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton, a top-level MI6 spy, is brought in to be debriefed by MI6 executive Eric Gray and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld about her just-finished mission to Berlin. The plot jumps between the debrief room and  [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] to Lorraine's time in Berlin.  The day after Gascoigne's death, Lorraine is dispatched to recover the List and is told to keep an eye out for Satchel, a double agent for the KGB who has been a problem for MI6 for years. Arriving in Berlin, she is immediately ambushed by KGB agents who deliver a message from their boss, Aleksander Bremovych, but she is able to escape and meet up with her contact, rogue MI6 Station Head David Percival. Lorraine searches Gascoigne's apartment and discovers a picture of him and Percival. In the debriefing, she tells Gray and Kurzfeld that Percival had previously denied knowing Gascoigne and that she suspects Percival was behind the West Berlin police ambushing her while she searched Gascoigne's apartment. When Lorraine visits a restaurant mentioned by the KGB agents she encounters Bremovych, but is "saved" by Delphine Lasalle, a rookie French agent. Although Lorraine is initially suspicious of Lasalle, they eventually enter into a romantic relationship.  Percival, having tailed Lorraine, surveils a watchmaker she visited. He spots Bakhtin entering the same shop. Bakhtin tells the watchmaker he has a watch full of secrets he will sell to the highest bidder. Kurzfeld meets with Lorraine in Berlin, handing her a newspaper containing a number which, when called, informs her that Satchel has been compromised. Percival lures Bahktin to an alley, kills him and takes the wristwatch, from which he discovers who Satchel is. Lorraine, who does not know Percival has the List, finds out that the [[Stasi]] officer codenamed Spyglass, who gave the List to Gascoigne, also memorized the names on it. Lorraine and Percival make plans to escort him across the border to West Berlin. Percival meets with Bremovych, who suspects Percival has the List, but Percival only offers the second best thing: the identity and operations of Satchel "to keep the balance", also tipping him off about the plan to extricate Spyglass from East Berlin. Lasalle covertly photographs the meeting.  During the extrication of Spyglass, Percival clandestinely shoots him when the KGB are unable to. Lorraine battles multiple KGB while rescuing the wounded Spyglass, but he drowns when their car is rammed into a river. Lorraine makes it to West Berlin and realizes Percival has planted a bug in her coat. She tells Lasalle, who calls Percival and threatens him with her knowledge of his Bremovych meeting.  Percival goes to Lasalle's apartment and kills her, fleeing as Lorraine arrives moments later. Lorraine discovers the photographs taken by Lasalle and realizes Percival has read the List.  Percival burns his safehouse and attempts to flee, but Lorraine arrives, kills him, and takes the List.  In the MI6 debriefing, Lorraine finds out Percival had told Gray he had the List and that he was "very close to Satchel". She presents Lasalle's photographs and audio recordings, which paint Percival as Satchel. She denies knowing the List's whereabouts, leaving MI6 no choice but to close the case.  Three days later in Paris, Lorraine, now speaking in Russian, meets with Bremovych, who addresses her as “Comrade Satchel”. Bremovych, having learned from Percival that there is more to Satchel than he had previously known, orders his men to kill her. Lorraine kills his henchmen; then, speaking with an American accent, she tells Bremovych that she always fed him bad information to manipulate the KGB. She kills Bremovych and then joins Kurzfeld with the List.

They then notice that a new family is moving into the next house. Krish is a neurosurgeon who specializes in [[deep brain stimulation]] to cure [[Parkinson's disease]]. He is close to another doctor, Dr. Prasad, who is a psychiatrist.  The two families get along well, with Jennifer aka Jenny, who is the eldest daughter having a crush on Krish. Everything goes well when suddenly during a dinner party, Krish sees Jenny jumping into the nearby well. Informing the family, he jumps into the well and saves her. Lakshmi who is angry at Krish for impulsively jumping into the deep well, quarrels with him that night before Krish forcefully kisses her and both end up having sex. That night, Jenny has seizures and once again, Krish helps her in time. During another dinner at Krish's house, Jenny panics after seeing a strange figure and her parents forcefully take her home. The people in the house start noticing strange things. The next morning, Jenny, once again not being self-aware, goes towards a cliff to jump. Sarah, who follows her, slips towards another cliff, but is saved by Krish.  When Paul goes towards Jenny to stop her, she herself returns home without saying anything, while still in a trance & passes out in the house. Her father then takes her to the psychiatrist on Krish's recommendation and she reveals two specific things that she thought was abnormal: a voice speaking to her in Chinese and another terrifying incident in the toilet. The psychiatrist feels that something is wrong and visits Jenny's room one day with the permission of her father who takes her out. He tries to decipher her mental state by reading the condition of her room, while also finding recent internet searches about ghosts in her tablet, and a book about exorcism lying in her drawer. Upon seeing this, he concludes that Jenny must've made up an image in her mind that she's possessed by a spirit. So, he, Krish, and Jenny's dad plan to administer fake exorcism with the help of a church pastor, Father Joshua in order to bind the spirit. All hell breaks loose in doing so, revealing that she is really possessed by a powerful spirit of the Chinese mother, resulting in Father Joshua getting injured and admitted to the hospital in a comatose state.  Jenny returns to a normal state, but to confirm what is going on, her grandfather calls on a psychic. But Jenny's father dismisses him. One night, the servant in the house prepares a voodoo doll to chase the bad spirit, but is scolded by Paul not to do occult in house. The same night, she is hit by the ghost in the same way as the voodoo doll, while being wrapped by her own shawl, impaled on the head by a nail. The next morning, when Paul looks around her room, he finds the Voodoo doll under the bed and what appears to be fingernail marks below the bed frame. Evidently spooked, he tells his father to call the psychic. Using his power, the psychic talks to the spirit, who signals to him that there are not two, but three spirits in the house, with the third one being revealed to actually be a malevolent force which would not let them leave the house.  Lakshmi announces that she is pregnant, but within a few days, she falls off a ladder, while seeing a scary figure on the water tank, who was actually attempting to cause her a miscarriage, but the child survives. Krish gets suspended as he was constantly distracted by these figures, while in the operation theater causing a hemorrhage to the patient being operated. Dr. Prasad, with the help of a local police inspector, starts researching about a family that used to live in that house finding out that there was an eye witness who knew what happened to the family. Simultaneously, the psychic too, using the comb which belonged to the Chinese daughter, begins to place the pieces of the mystery. When Dr. Prasad and Krish go to see the witness in a village, she tells a flashback when she was eight years old. It is revealed that the house belonged to a rich Chinese silk merchant who lived with his wife and daughter. He wished that his pregnant wife should bear a male child. As he was a Satan worshiper, he had to sacrifice a girl child during the time of the solar eclipse to get a male child.  To achieve this purpose, he kidnapped the then eight year old witness when she was collecting flowers in the garden nearby as usual. The eight year old was saved in time by his wife, which left him with no option, but to sacrifice his own daughter. He hit his wife, until she fell unconscious. Luring his daughter, he beheaded her using a sacrificial sword. His wife, regaining her consciousness, couldn't bear the sight of her dead daughter on the floor. Cursing her husband, she took a knife and pierced herself in the abdomen, killing herself and the unborn child, telling him that she does not need a male child by sacrificing a female child. The husband, realizing his loss, takes his own life by drowning in the nearby well.  Returning to the present, the father orders his family to pack up and leave the house. Lakshmi is being chased in the hospital by the two spirits only to guide her to Father Joshua’s room. Being the day of the solar eclipse, the old woman speculates that the Chinese merchant would return to complete his ritual. Lakshmi calls Krish and tells him that she is discharged and is headed to see Jenny. Krish too comes back from the village at the request of Lakshmi to stay with Jenny. Lakshmi then tricks Krish and locks him in Jenny's room for impeding him till the eclipse ends. She then reveals what Father Joshua had seen on the day of exorcism. Though Jenny was set free, some other force tried to stop the prayers of Father Joshua in the room. The force was from none other than Krish. When Krish had jumped into the well the other night to save Jenny, the Chinese merchant’s spirit possessed him. Meanwhile, the psychiatrist being in the same room as Krish also figures that the Chinese merchant and Krish have common dates of birth. Krish being possessed, kills the psychiatrist in a gruesome way and escapes through the window.  It was from Krish that the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter were trying to protect the family by frightening them to leave the house. As the eclipse begins, the spirit of the Chinese merchant takes full control of Krish and he begins searching for his target, which is revealed to be Sarah, to sacrifice and complete the ritual. Though he lures her and tries to kill her, the family members and the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter fight with Krish by trying to distract him, until the eclipse ends and they finally succeed in removing the spirit from his body.  In the end, Krish and Lakshmi are shown to be settled in Goa. Jenny, along with her dad comes to meet them. When Jenny requests to meet their son, it is revealed to the viewers that Krish, being possessed by the Chinese merchant’s spirit had sex with Lakshmi resulting in a baby actually born of the Chinese merchant instead, which the couple is unaware of. The film ends with the camera panning towards the boy seated in a room, slowly revealing his face & focusing on the iris of his eye, which splits into double iris and the screen cuts to black.

Attraction (film)
 The storyline revolves around colonel Valentin Lebedev, who is in charge of the military operation, his daughter Yulia, who develops a romantic relationship with the alien Hekon, and her former boyfriend Artyom who is the main antagonist.  Hekon is a representative of a technologically-advanced humanoid race who arrives to Earth incognito for research purposes. His spaceship is damaged by a [[meteor shower]]. The [[Russian Air Force]] mistakes his spaceship for a NATO spy satellite/spacecraft and damages it by firing missiles into it, causing it to crash into several buildings in [[Moscow]] and kill hundreds of people. It is on that same day when Yulia and Artyom have finished attending a meteor-watching event, that Yulia's friend Svetlana is killed while watching some meteors.  The Russian government decides not to enter into a contact with the ship and let it fix itself on its own. The landing area is evacuated, fenced, and guarded, and Moscow is placed under a [[curfew]]. Meanwhile, Yulia, Artyom, and his friends Khariton, Ruslan, and Piton sneak into the crash site to investigate the alien: after they beat him up and cause him to crash down a building, they retrieve his armor before an army patrol may find them. On another day, Yulia sneaks again to retrieve the alien, placing him to a nerdy classmate known as "Google" to help the alien recover. While examining his body, she notices a wristband forming on her right wrist, which manipulates water.  The alien, who introduces himself as "Hekon", was initially unsure about Earth and its people, but tells them that he is looking for a device known as "Shilk", that allows him to travel through space without destroying his body. Shilk, like the spaceship, appears to be attracting water. As he goes out to the streets to look for the device, the police mistake him for a drug addict and send him off to a police station to be interrogated.  Meanwhile, Artyom and his friends drive in their car to inform Colonel Lebedev about the alien's armor that they had hidden in their garage. and stumble upon a crowd who is angry over rationed water, as the spaceship appears to absorb water in order to repair itself. Ruslan decides to provoke the crowd into becoming a disorderly riot. Artyom is hit by a policeman's baton as he tries to convince people to stop rioting, and is taken to the police station but he forgets to tell Colonel Lebedev about his discovery.  In order to get Shilk, Yulia goes to see her father, who interrupts his meeting with his officers when she informed him that she is pregnant with Hekon's child. She actually says this to distract him, so Hekon can disguise himself as a scientist and take Shilk from its container, and also because she was upset that he did not spend much time with her after her mother passed away.  Yulia confesses her true feelings for Hekon in a phone call to Artyom, while Artyom arrives with his friends to beat up the alien. Hekon fights back, and when one of Artyom's friends tries to shoot Hekon, Ruslan is shot by accident instead. Artyom and one of his friends flee before the police would arrest them. He reports this incident to gather many supporters and form a group to attack Hekon's spaceship, and avenge Ruslan's death, whom he blames the alien for causing it. In spite of his initial support, Piton sometimes expresses doubt on Artyom's goals.  Artyom's group breaks through a police barricade, triggering several other robotic suits to come out and fight against the mob. Yulia and Hekon drive through the police barricade and the mob using a military car to return him and Shilk back to their ship, while fending off against Artyom, who angrily rampages using Hekon's suit. Hekon defeats Artyom, but Artyom shoots him and Yulia with a dropped military rifle. Saddened by this, Colonel Lebedev follows several walking suits as they carry Yulia and Hekon to the spaceship, where its machinery uses water to nurse Yulia's injuries. The spaceship's computer also responds to Lebedev's questions about Hekon's mission to observe the Earth, as its warlike civilizations and history had made it very unsafe for interstellar contact. However, Yulia's love for Hekon, and her willingness to protect him, have caused the computer's authorities to rewrite the results of their study on Earth.  Yulia, her father, and everyone else return to their daily lives, as the spaceship departs and releases excess water. Meanwhile, Artyom is arrested and presumably sent to a prison camp.  The [[moral|fabula]] of the movie is vocalized by Yulia at the end: The truth is that one alien from far away trusted us more than we trust ourselves.

After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra Baahubali is declared as the future king of [[Mahishmati]] and [[Bhallaladeva]] its commander-in-chief. The Rajamatha Sivagami orders Amarendra to tour the kingdom and its neighbourhood, along with Kattappa. During the tour, Amarendra witnesses an attack by Devasena, the princess of Kuntala, a kingdom neighbouring Mahishmati. Falling in love with her, he approaches her after the fight, posing as a simpleton, and is accepted into the royal palace for a job.  Bhallaladeva receives a message of Amarendra's act and upon viewing Devasena's portrait, lusts for her. He asks Sivagami for Devasena's hand in marriage. The Rajamata, who was unaware of Amarendra's feelings for Devasena, assures Bhallaladeva and sends an emissary to Kuntala, who delivers the marriage proposal in a patronising way. An insulted Devasena rejects the proposal with a scathing reply. Enraged hearing her response, Sivagami sends an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive.  Meanwhile, Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a [[Dacoity|dacoit]]-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Kattappa Devasena's maternal cousin, Kumara Varma, is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Upon being questioned, Amarendra reveals his true identity. He receives a bird post from Mahishmati, ordering him to take Devasena as captive. He promises Devasena that he will protect her honour and convinces her to come with him to Mahishmati as his future bride.  Upon reaching Mahishmati, the misunderstanding is brought to light and when an ultimatum is delivered to Amarendra that he must either choose the throne or Devasena, he chooses the latter. Bhallaladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the new commander-in-chief. During Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva rids Amarendra of his duties as a "gift".

Bijjaladeva convinces Kumara Varma that Bhallaladeva is after Amarendra's life and he must kill the king to safeguard his brother-in-law. Kumara Varma enters the palace in the stealth of the night, only to be discovered by Bhallaladeva and be killed, but not before revealing their plot to convince Sivagami to kill Amarendra. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's life is under threat but that open hostility would result in civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, and then stabs him in the back and kills him.  After Amarendra's death, Kattappa soon learns of  Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami, who reveals to the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and that the baby Mahendra Baahubali would ascend the throne. As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with the new King but falls into a river after being hit by an arrow shot by Bhallaladeva. As Bhallaladeva holds Devasena prisoner for the next 25 years and destroys Kuntala, Mahendra grows up and leads the rebel group that has indulged in guerrilla warfare against King Bhallaladeva.  After listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali (alias Sivudu) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati along with Avantika and the people of the city. After an ensuing battle, Bhallaladeva is defeated by Mahendra and burnt alive on a pyre prepared by Devasena.

Bad Genius
 Lynn, a top secondary school student living with her father, is accepted into a prestigious school, earning a scholarship for her academic achievements. There, she is befriended by the good-natured but academically challenged Grace. Lynn begins helping Grace cheat in exams after finding out that their teacher has been leaking questions in private tutoring sessions. She is then approached by Grace's rich boyfriend Pat, who offers payment in exchange for also helping him and his friends. Although at first reluctant, Lynn agrees when she finds out that the school took payments of "tea money" from her father, who earns a modest income as a teacher. She devises a system of hand signals, based on certain piano pieces, and uses them to send answers during exams. Her base of clients eventually grows. However, her cheating is inadvertently revealed by Bank, another top student. She is reprimanded by her father and the school, which suspends her scholarship, as well as her chance to apply for an international scholarship at the university level.  Lynn returns to the cheating business when Pat and Grace ask her to help them cheat in the STIC—an international standardised test for university admissions—a scheme which will earn them millions of baht. However, Lynn tells them that she can only do it with Bank's help, and honest, upright Bank would never join them. However, Bank, who is from a poor family and is staking his future on the same university scholarship, is incidentally attacked by thugs in the street and misses the exam. Lynn then approaches him with the offer and Bank reluctantly agrees.  Together, they make preparations for the final operation. Lynn and Bank will fly to Australia in order to get a head start on the exams, which are held globally on the same day, and send back answers for Pat and Grace to distribute to the clients. However, on the eve of their flight, Pat lets slip that it was he who ordered the thugs to beat up Bank, in order to force him to join their scheme. Enraged, Bank attacks Pat and leaves. Lynn, shocked at the revelation, begins rethinking her actions. However, Bank returns to confront Lynn, telling her to finish what she started.  In Sydney, Lynn and Bank complete the first sections of the test according to plan, but Bank is overcome by anxiety and is caught. Lynn struggles to memorise the final section herself, but finally pulls through. She is pursued by the test administrator after feigning illness and leaving the test centre early, but is released when Bank tells the staff he doesn't know her.  Returning home, Lynn finds that their scheme was a great success, but, broken by the experience, turns her back on her co-conspirators. Some time later, she visits Bank, who has invested his share in revamping his mother's laundry business. Bank invites Lynn to start a different scheme, this time with a much wider client base—those taking the national GAT & PAT exams. She turns him down, telling him that she's made her choice. Lynn finally decides to come clean, tearfully confessing to her father, who comforts her and helps her redeem herself by submitting a formal confession to the STIC organisation.  
Back to Burgundy
 Three siblings from Burgundy have to find a way to reconnect with one another when their father falls ill.  Jean, Juliette and Jérémie were all trained in the art of wine growing and production by a father made out to be dominant and controlling. Juliette, and Jérémie (who married locally) stayed close to the vineyards in adult life, but Jean left, backpacking around the world and working in the wine industry in Chile (where he met his girlfriend, Alicia) and finally buying an vineyard with her in Australia. He missed the death of his mother in France, in part - we learn later- because his son was being born at exactly the same moment in Australia. He returned to France 10 years after his departure, as his father is ailing (he dies mid-movie) with mixed feelings, and the plot revolves around his coming to terms with the past, his father, and his relationship with Alicia.   Several plot lines intertwine, and the past and present are interconnected in several scenes of childhood and adulthood in and around the vineyards and the family house. These are 1) on the death of their father, the siblings inherit the property jointly, meaning they have to agree on its future. Jean initially wants to sell to clear outstanding debts in Australia, then Jérémie's unpleasant father in law tries to buy some of the best land, and finally a complex leasing arrangement is reached that satisfies all three. 2) Jean believes his father hated him, but finds out after his death via an unopened letter that this was not the case.  3) Jean's relationship with Alicia in Australia is fragile. Juliette believes he still loves her despite her decision to separate and so phones Alicia, despite not knowing her.  Alicia travels to France with their son, late in the film, and they are reconciled. They decide to live together in Australia. 4) Jérémie is looked down on by his in-laws and lives in one of their cottages with his wife Océane and their son. They eventually move to their own house and refuse offers of jobs and support.   There are sub-plots referring to Juliette's romantic life, the annual cycle of grape and wine production including the crucial date of harvest, and who has the best winegrowing skills (revealed to be Juliette and Jean, not the older generation!).  
Bairavaa
 Bairavaa (Kala Bhairava in Telugu Version) ([[Vijay(actor)|Vijay]]), a collection agent for ICCI Bank in [[Chennai]] ([[Vijayawada]] in Telugu Version), is a righteous person who is willing to employ even violent means to get back the money from the debtors. During his manager's daughter's wedding, he comes across Malarvizhi ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), a medical student from [[Kallidaikurichi]] in [[Tirunelveli district]] ([[Vishakhapatnam]] in Telugu Version), and immediately falls in love with her. Malarvizhi goes to the [[CMBT|Koyambedu bus station]] to leave Chennai, where Bairavaa comes to propose his love, when he notices that she is cornered by a group of thugs with intent to kill her, as she was allegedly involved in an attack on a Union Minister's son Charan ([[Roshan Basheer]]). However, they retreat after receiving a call from Periyakannu alias PK ([[Jagapathi Babu]]) from [[Tirunelveli]], who tells them not to harm her.  When confronted by Bairavaa, Malarvizhi narrates her flashback. She studies at PK Medical College in Tirunelveli, whose chairman is PK, a criminal and politician who rules Tirunelveli along with his right-hand man Kottai Veeran ([[Daniel Balaji]]). The college has no basic facilities, including a proper building and good doctors. Malarvizhi and her best friend Vaishali ([[Aparna Vinod]]) lodged a complaint against the college to the [[Medical Council of India|MCI]], upon which they decided to blacklist the college. To save his reputation, PK made a deal with the MCI officials to revoke the suspension in exchange for sex with a girl from the college. Vaishali was the girl chosen by the officials. The next morning, she was found raped and killed. Malarvizhi's father ([[Aadukalam Naren]]), a sincere police officer, began an investigation in Vaishali's death, but he was killed as well by PK in retribution. Later, Malarvizhi filed a case against PK in the court, where the judge ruled that Malarvizhi should not be expelled nor harmed till the case is resolved. Though PK upholds the judge's ruling, he harasses Malarvizhi indirectly. He plans to kill her once the verdict is declared in his favour. During the marriage, Malarvizhi had given the video evidence of Vaishali being raped to Charan. As he is the son of a Union Minister, she believed he could pull strings in  [[National Informatics Centre|NIC]], to investigate the video. Charan was also attacked by PK's henchmen when they chopped his hand and they took the evidence.  On hearing Malarvizhi's story, Bairavaa decides to help her fight back with PK and get justice for Vaishali. Impersonating as an Income Tax officer, Bairavaa raids PK's mansion and collects evidence which holds PK responsible for Vaishali's death. Soon, the Lion and Tiger game begins between Bairavaa and PK. In the process, PK gets back the evidence and destroys them via Malarvizhi's lawyer when his daughter's life is threatened. Bairavaa manages to get five more days from the court to gather the required evidence. Meanwhile, Kottai Veeran's wife, who was terminally ill, passes away. Bairavaa decides to take advantage of Kottai Veeran's love for his wife to make him approver against PK. Hence the former switches PK's [[asthma]] inhaler with [[nitrous oxide]]. PK, who inadvertently inhales the gas before Kottai Veeran's wife's funeral, begins to uncontrollably laugh at the funeral, causing Kottai Veeran to turn against him and accept Bairavaa's offer of becoming an approver, turning against PK. In revenge for betraying him, PK confronts Kottai Veeran in the forest and hacks him to death.  Hearing about Kottai Veeran's murder by PK, Bairavaa frames the latter for plotting to assassinate the [[Prime Minister of India]] on his plan to visit the [[Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant]], as a result of which a shoot at sight is ordered against PK. He then disguises himself as a [[National Security Guard|NSG]] commando, blends in with the real NSG commandos and kills PK.  In the end, the verdict is declared in favour of Bairavaa and Malarvizhi. PK's henchmen are arrested while the students of PK Medical College are shifted to another college. In a press conference, Bairavaa, while supporting private colleges, says that it is important that the person heading such colleges are honest and sincere enough to ensure that the students are safe and receive a good education. Hence the movie ends on a happy note with Bairavaa and Malarvizhi getting married, thus reunited with each other.  
Badrinath Ki Dulhania
 Badrinath "Badri" Bansal ([[Varun Dhawan]]) is the younger son of a wealthy family in Jhansi. In a flashback, it is shown that Badri's elder brother, Aloknath "Alok" Bansal ([[Yash Sinha]]) was in love with a girl and was going to leave the family for her because their father disapproved, but decided against it after their father Ambarnath "Ambar" Bansal's ([[Rituraj Singh (actor)|Rituraj Singh]]) first heart attack. Now Alok is married to Urmila Shukla ([[Swetha Basu Prasad]]) through an arranged marriage and she is not allowed to work despite being very intelligent and professionally trained, more than Alok himself. Alok is also depressed at having to leave his love and be forced into a marriage, so he spends a lot of time drinking. Badri fears the same fate for himself so when he sees Vaidehi Trivedi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) at a wedding supposedly being looked after by her father Mayank ([[Swanand Kirkire]]), he becomes obsessed with her and makes it his mission to marry her with Ambar's approval.  Vaidehi is also clearly more intelligent than Badri. She has a full education and is secretly training to become a flight attendant while Badri only passed the tenth grade. She's initially uninterested in getting married and is even offended by his marriage proposal. But when Badri helps Vaidehi's elder sister, Kritika (Sukhmani Lamba) find a husband in Bhushan Mishra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and even resolves a dowry crisis with Bhushan's father Jitendra Mishra ([[Rajendra Sethi]]), Vaidehi agrees to marry him. On their wedding day, however, Vaidehi does not show up. Badri is heartbroken and Ambar is furious. He commands Badri to find Vaidehi and bring her back so that they can "hang her from the ceiling." Despite being afraid of Ambar's words, Badri goes to [[Mumbai]] to find Vaidehi, where he discovers that she's already moved to [[Singapore]] for a flight attendant training program.  Badri shows up on Vaidehi's doorstep in Singapore and kidnaps her. On the way, he pulls over and lets her out of the car trunk and they have an argument. Badri is furious at her for leaving him at the altar and she apologizes, trying to assure him that the reason she left was not because of him. Badri grabs her by the throat when a police car pulls up and takes them to the police station. At the police station, Vaidehi covers for Badri despite him having kidnapped her and attempted to choke her. Over the next few days, Badri stalks Vaidehi. Alok calls and tells him that Ambar has started looking for other brides. This terrifies Badri and he attempts entry into Vaidehi's workplace. She stops him and tells him she'll marry him only if he can convince Ambar to let her work and live in Singapore. Badri gets drunk that night and causes a scene outside Vaidehi's residential building and they have to go to the police again, where this time Vaidehi has to pay $1500 to bail him out.  Badri moves into Vaidehi's apartment where she cares for him by cooking for him before leaving for work every day, which humbles him. They spend time together with friends and tour Singapore together. Over time Badri begins to respect Vaidehi's independence and is impressed by her job and intelligence.

Before the pooja, he gets heavily drunk and berates Ambar for being disrespectful to women. He blames Ambar for being the reason that he can't have Vaidehi when suddenly he sees Vaidehi from the corner of his eye. She tells him that she loves him and wants to marry him. Together they stand up to Ambar and tell him that they will get married and Vaidehi will work as she pleases regardless of whether he agrees or not.  In the epilogue, it is shown that Badri and Vaidehi maintain a long distance relationship while she finishes her training program in Singapore before moving back to India and starting her own flight attendant training center. Urmila gives birth to twins, one boy and girl, and it is shown that so far Ambar has been treating both of them equally. She also starts working in the family's car showroom with Alok and even gets her own cabin. Badri and Vaidehi promise not to collect any dowry for any of their children.

But while commiserating about the pressures of the holidays they make a pact to “take Christmas back”.

At work, Carla meets an erotic dancer named Ty ([[Justin Hartley]]), who says he is competing in a Sexy Santa competition and he asks Carla to be his date, which she enthusiastically accepts.

When Carla brings Isis home, Isis tells her she needs money for a new investment, but Carla knows she's just going to gamble it all away and then disappear from Carla's life like it's been for years.  Nonetheless, Carla relents and loans Isis the money.  On Christmas Eve, Sandy tells Kiki that she put up a cash offer for the house next door so that she can live right next to Kiki.  Finally, Kiki lashes out and tells Sandy she cannot live next door and that she wants some space.  Sandy leaves the room crying.  Amy gets angry with Ruth when she discovers Ruth has invited a bunch of strangers over to her home to throw an elaborate Christmas party, exactly what Amy did not want. Amy loses her temper and demands everyone leave her home and tells Ruth to leave and get out of her life forever.  Her kids, Jane and Dylan, witness this outburst and become upset with Amy. Meanwhile, Carla finds a note from Isis indicating she has just taken off with the money she lent her. Kiki is all alone as well.  Ruth goes to church for Midnight Mass and is, surprisingly, joined by Sandy and Isis. All the ladies criticize each other for their efforts as mothers, with each of them realizing their flaws. Amy’s father goes to her to talk about Ruth and the horrible fight they had, but acknowledging that while Ruth can be difficult to deal with, Ruth has always been incredibly insecure, always worried whether or not she was doing a good job as a mother, but she always had the right intentions and loved Amy unconditionally. Amy goes to the church, where Ruth is to try and repair her relationship with her mother.  The two apologise to each other, with both confessing how much they genuinely love each other. Ruth tells Amy that she is a wonderful mother. The two embrace tightly.  As the clock strikes midnight, Amy realises that she needs her mother to help her fix Christmas. The two rush home to start decorating the house properly.  On Christmas morning, Jane and Dylan go downstairs to see that Ruth has returned, the relationship has been repaired and the house looking wonderful with decorations and gifts.

Carla is then visited by Isis, who is serious about turning her life around and has a new job at Sky Zone.  All the families get together and Ruth, Sandy and Isis announce that they have become friends and are now planning to take a trip to Las Vegas.

Like most Indian mothers, Bitti's mother wants to see her daughter get married to a nice man from a good family. Bitti, however, wants a husband who understands her and, more importantly, who accepts her exactly the way she is. A suitor comes but after knowing his disgusting mindset, she lies about not being a virgin and gets rejected. Her mother gets irritated with the constant rejections, but her father understands her. She gets heartbroken after hearing her parents conversation and later pours her heart out before her father who consoles and cheers her.  That night, despite having nowhere to go, she leaves her house and boards a train. While on a train platform, she chances upon a book at a bookstall and buys it. As she reads the novel entitles ''Bareilly Ki Barfi,'' Bitti starts to identify with the protagonist. Having found acceptance in the pages of the book, she decides to return home the same night. She longs to meet the writer and thus one day decides to search for the supposed writer of the book, Pritam Vidrohi ([[Rajkummar Rao]]). She goes back to the same bookstall where she had brought that book and asks about its writer. The bookshop owner directs her to Chirag Dubey ([[Ayushmann Khurana]]), who owns a printing press and who helped publish the book.  What Bitti doesn't know is that Chirag is in fact the true author of the book. He had written that book five years previously, after undergoing pain when his girlfriend ditched him and married someone else. He wrote that book describing his girlfriend Bubbly and their love story. Since giving his own name as the writer might destroy his ex-girlfriend's reputation, he coaxes one of his meek, so-called friend "Pritam Vidrohi" to have his name as the writer of the book. Vidrohi agrees but gets so scared of the possible future scenarios, that he leaves the city without telling anyone. He need not have been so worried, because in the five years since the book had been self-published by Chirag, not a single copy had ever been sold, except the copy that Bitti had purchased on the railway platform that day.  Bitti tries to get Vidrohi's whereabouts from Chirag but Chirag successfully manages to convince her to write letters to the author instead of meeting him personally. She writes a letter to Vidrohi for Chirag to pass on to him. Chirag, being the true author, writes back and passes it off as Vidrohi's response. Thus begins a correspondence between Bitti and 'Vidrohi'. In the meantime, Chirag and Bitti get to know each other better and become good friends. Bitti, however, starts to lose patience when Vidrohi, despite her repeated requests, refuses to meet her. She broaches this with Chirag and implores him to arrange for her to meet Vidrohi just once. Chirag agrees and as he has fallen for Bitti and decides to tell her the truth, that he is the actual writer. But later he learns that Bitti's mother hates that writer for spoiling their daughter's mind and thus decides not to tell the truth, instead search for Vidrohi and make him the scapegoat.  Chirag visits Lucknow, where Vidrohi works as a salesman in a saree showroom, and convinces him to act like a boor, with a bad & short-tempered attitude, so that Bitti will be cured of her long-distance infatuation. Thus, at first meeting with Bitti, Vidrohi, as instructed, pretends to be a rude and boorish person, causing Bitti to get annoyed leave. However, despite his rude behaviour, Vidrohi shows a sensitive side, that ultimately makes Bitti and her family have second opinion. Bitti invites Vidrohi for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of her family sweet shop. Instead of going along with Chirag’s plan (which was refusing and leaving for Lucknow), Vidrohi accets the invitation, saying that he doesn’t want to break her heart. A furious Chirag stars beating up Vidrohi in the evening, until Vidrohi reveals the real reason why he decided to stay back: He had fallen for Bitti’s friend, Rama. Seeing how this would kee Vidrohi and Bitti apart, Chirag tells him he fully supports Vidrohi, when in reality, he doesn’t care, as long as Vidrohi stays away from Bitti. Bitti’s mother, however, sees the perfect son-in-law in Vidrohi. Chirag lies about Vidrohi saying that he is a divorcee (since marrying a divorcee is considered a taboo).  One day, when Chirag, Vidrohi, Bitti and Rama go on an outing together, Vidrohi reveals his feelings for Rama to her. While Rama does like him, she rejects him because she (indirectly) learned from Chirag that he is a divorcee. After years of bullying, this turns out to be the final straw for Vidrohi and tells Chirag that he will take away Chirag's girl with a snap of his fingers. Chirag, believing that Bitti will never fall for someone like Vidrohi, accepts the challenge. To his shock, Vidrohi’s jerk with a heart of gold persona starts winning over Bitti and everybody’s hearts. Ultimately Vidrohi comes to Chirag and Munna and invites them to his wedding engagement with Bitti. Chirag threatens to reveal everything to Bitti, saying that if he can’t be happy, then no one should be. Vidrohi calls Chirag out for his selfishness and tells him he can do whatever he wants. Chirag goes to Bitti to tell her the truth, but is unable to say anything to her after seeing how happy she is. He realizes how his selfishness had blinded him and how he never cared about anybody else’s happiness. He realizes that he is happy as long as Bitti is happy, and how he himself is responsible for everything. He writes some lines for Bitti on behalf of Vidrohi, and meets him. Chirag apologizes Vidrohi for dragging him into the mess and for his behaviour. Vidrohi forgives him and he requests Chirag to come to his engagement, this time in a very sincere manner.  On the day of engagement, Vidrohi says he has a sore throat asks Chirag to recite those lines for Bitti. Chirag begins to recite the lines, but his emotions overcome him. The entire speech leaves everyone in tears. Seeing how Chirag is willing to let Bitti marry Vidrohi for the sake of her happiness, she decides to reveal the truth: Vidrohi had revealed everything to Bitti including the fact that Chirag was the real author of ''Bareilly ki Barfi'', and everything, from Vidrohi refusing to go back to Lucknow, to Rama rejecting him, to Bitti and Vidrohi’s engagement, to Vidrohi conveniently having a sore throat at the very last moment, was an act, just to test whether Chirag really loved Bitti, or if he just was in love with the shadow of his ex-girlfriend, Bubbly, that he saw in her. She reveals that she too is in love with Chirag. Chirag apologizes to Vidrohi again for everything and the two hug each other.  The movie ends with Chirag and Bitti getting together, while Vidrohi gets together with Rama. The narrator asks the viewers to taste the famous 'barfi' if they ever visit [[Bareilly]].

Batman vs. Two-Face
 [[Batman]] and [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] are invited to a top-secret demonstration hosted by Professor [[Hugo Strange]] and his assistant Dr. [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel]] that may eventually change the future of Gotham forever. Along the way, Batman takes a stop at [[Gotham State Penitentiary]] to visit [[Catwoman]] (whose suicide attempt from [[Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders|the first movie]] somehow failed) to give her a book on poetry by [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]. This is something to keep her occupied for the next 36 months of her life until she is let out of prison for good. At the laboratory, they meet district attorney and Bruce Wayne's ally in the war against crime [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] who is famous for having stopped a coin counterfeiting gang while keeping a two-faced quarter as a souvenir from the case.  Hugo Strange believes that good and evil are all but one-sided and has created an "Evil Extractor" to which the volunteering criminals [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]], [[Riddler]], [[Egghead (DC Comics)|Egghead]], and [[Mr. Freeze]], will be purified of their corruption. Batman bluffs it off, saying that there are no easy fixes to the straight and narrow path, but Strange conducts his experiment anyway, despite the fact that it will make the jobs of Batman, Robin and Harvey obsolete. All goes well until the Joker entices his fellow villains to overload the machine. Noticing this, Professor Strange orders Dr. Quinzel to shut it down...but is too late and Harvey (as opposed to acid from the comic book mythos) is horribly scarred by the explosion of the containment vat, with Batman being successful in saving the right side of his face.  Harvey, now re-christened Two-Face, goes on a crime spree as seen in the opening credits, all of which his attempts are foiled by the Dynamic Duo. He is eventually whisked to a hospital where his face has been given reconstructive surgery. His sanity has apparently been restored as well.  Now returning to his old job as the assistant to the assistant district attorney, Harvey spends the next six months in charge of his own fate. At the same time, [[King Tut (comics)|King Tut]] and his henchmen have been robbing an biplane. At [[Wayne Manor]], [[List of Batman television series characters#Aunt Harriet|Aunt Harriet]] is getting ready for a soiree in Bruce and Dick's place while they investigate the crime as Batman and Robin.  After implying comparisons between King Tut and Two-Face, Batman and Robin return to the Batcave where they realize that a double decker bus company are planning to hold the millionaires, [[Alfred Pennyworth]], and Aunt Harriet hostage. They arrive on the bus via Batmobile and fight King Tut and the Tutlings while Alfred escorts the patrons to safety. Unfortunately, the Dynamic Duo are subdued by a pair of twin snakes with knockout venom.  In an urn trap as seen in King Tut's debut episode, Batman and Robin are to be entombed in the foundations of the Pyramid Towers that are soon to be erected above the digging spot where they are trapped. Cement pours over them and when it appears as though they are doomed, they press the back of their soles against the sides of the jars, triggering the Batjets. They fly to confront King Tut in one final battle and a brick to the head restores his memory of Professor William McElroy. As they take him away, a pair of twins seize the jewels that were stolen by the Tutlings.  Batman, Robin, [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] and [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Chief O'Hara|Chief O'Hara]] interrogate King Tut as Harvey waits in the shadows, with O'Hara constantly hitting Tut on the head with his baton. King Tut's lawyer Lucille Diamond intervenes and ushers them out of the room so that she can speak to him. At King Tut's trial, she implicates that the concussion is nothing more than a threat to a mild-mannered man. Chief O'Hara tearfully confesses to hitting King Tut and Harvey calls Batman as his next witness, but Professor McElroy himself admits his guilt, ready to suffer the minimum penalty of being rehabilitated in prison. After the sentencing, Harvey shares a highball with Bruce Wayne much to Dick's annoyance at bearing the hardships of a third wheel.  Harvey is then due to a attend a charity for underprivileged twins at the Winning Pair casino just as Bruce and Dick resume their identities as Batman and Robin once more. A package has arrived at Commissioner Gordon's office, a World Atlas book marked for Batman...with its pages eaten away in three holes. Robin surmises the culprit to be [[List of Batman (TV series) characters#Bookworm|Bookworm]] and the duo race off in the Batmobile to find him at the Gotham City Library where a fight ensues and the three priceless books that Bookworm had his eyes on have disappeared.  Batman and Robin deduce that the stolen books were all about duality, but Two-Face has already been reformed and so they try to find another way behind it. Regardless, they head to an abandoned sign factory with Two-Face and the twins waiting for them. After defeating the twins, Two-Face pins them with a large number two and the flip of his coin landing on the right side spares their lives. Once they have left, Batman believes that Harvey has made a lot of enemies in his career and they are all out to destroy it. Meanwhile, Harvey is having some problems of his own after he makes a phone call to....Two-Face, who kidnaps Professor Strange as part of their scheme.  Robin is punished to his room by Batman after nearly getting into a row about Harvey’s involvement in Two-Face’s plans and Catwoman, who by now has been stood up, escapes her cell by switching places with Lucilee Diamond. Following Harvey to the laboratory, Robin is ambushed by Two-Face and Professor Strange corrupts him with the same gas of the extractor that mutates the left side of his body. Batman is forced to fight his beloved sidekick who cures him back at the Batcave, following Two-Face to the casino where he is in fact revealed to be Dent, having suppressed his bad side (á la [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]). Once the Dynamic Duo are strapped to a large silver dollar, he unmasks Batman and deduces Robin’s true identity. Then Two-Face invites Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Egghead, [[List of Batman television series characters#Shame|Shame]], [[Clock King]] and Catwoman to an auction for the highest bidder of Batman’s true identity.  With Catwoman’s help, Batman and Robin defeat the villains, but Two-Face gets away on the biplane stolen by King Tut, intending to use the evil gas to remake Gotham City in his image. The Dynamic Duo manage to shoot him down towards a flaming factory where Batman goes one on one with Two-Face having completely taking over Harvey’s body. In a battle of wits, Batman urges Harvey to regain self-control and he does, defeating Two-Face for good as they escape the factory.  The next morning, Batman and Robin use the Batwing to cure the infected Gothamites. Months later, Harvey still appears to have repressed Two-Face and forgotten Batman's secret identity. He holds a bachelor auction at Wayne Manor with the caped crusader himself as the first bachelor. Batman appears before everyone, and to his delight, ends up having the first person to bid for him being none other than Catwoman.  In the post-credits, there is a memorial for [[Adam West]], who portrayed Batman. It also stated "Rest Well, Bright Knight".

Baywatch (film)
 In Emerald Bay, [[Florida]], Lt. [[Mitch Buchannon]] and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-command Stephanie Holden and veteran [[C. J. Parker]], protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch. Having made over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, to the annoyance of local beat cop Garner Ellerbee and Mitch's superior, Captain Thorpe. During one of his morning patrols, Mitch discovers a small pouch of [[flakka]] drug washed up near the Huntley Club, which is now under the ownership of Colombian businesswoman Victoria Leeds, who has been secretly bribing city councilman Rodriguez and others in efforts to increase her stake in the bay.  At the tryouts for prospective lifeguards, three people stand out: surfer Summer Quinn, an old friend of Holden; Ronnie Greenbaum, a chubby computer nerd with a crush on C. J.; and Matt Brody, a former Olympic gold medal swimmer who fell from grace to grass after vomiting during a relay race. Summer and Ronnie both pass the trials, but Brody refuses to participate, insisting his Olympic status and recommendation letter entitles him to have a place on the team. Mitch challenges Brody on a course of the former's choosing, but a drowning woman and her kids interrupt the challenge and they rush to save her. Mitch learns Brody has to perform community service as part of an unspecified plea deal, and that Thorpe insists rehabilitating Brody's image is necessary to convince the city not to further cut Baywatch's funding.  When a private yacht catches fire, Brody disobeys orders and dives directly under the flames, causing Holden and C. J. to have to save him. The occupants are evacuated, except for the deceased councilman Rodriguez. Ellerbee disapproves of Mitch's further investigative actions. Mitch and the gang attend a party held by Leeds to look for more evidence but without much luck as Brody makes a fool of himself getting drunk. Mitch, Brody, and Summer later infiltrate the city morgue, where they record two of Leeds' men planting a falsified autopsy report to cover up the fact that Rodriguez was murdered on her orders. Unfortunately, they are discovered, and though Mitch manages to subdue and capture one of them, the recording is destroyed and Ellerbee is forced to release their suspect on a lack of evidence. Angered, Thorpe threatens to fire Mitch if he oversteps his authority again.  Convinced that Leeds is running drugs out of the Huntley, Mitch and Brody go undercover and sneak into the club kitchen, where they witness her workers retrieving the drugs from barrels of fish and processing them. They contact Ellerbee, only to learn that another body has been found on the beach. Thorpe, enraged that Mitch essentially deserted his post, fires him and names Brody as the new lieutenant. Brody accepts the job reluctantly, and Mitch takes a job as a cellphone salesman.  After finding another pouch of flakka on the beach, Brody steals the second victim's report from Ellerbee and brings it to Summer, who confirms his suspicion that the man was murdered. Ronnie, upon recognizing the victim as his friend Dave, helps Brody hack into Leeds' servers, revealing her plan to privatize the entire beach by systematically buying out or eliminating every competing business owner.  The team infiltrates a private party on Leeds' personal yacht, discovering how she's been using the hull to smuggle the drugs. Brody is captured and placed in a bait cage to be drowned, and a gloating Leeds reveals that she bribed the corrupt Thorpe to set Mitch up so he could justify firing him before pushing the cage into the water. Just before Brody drowns, Mitch appears and saves him. The two catch up to Leeds, while Ronnie and C. J. launch fireworks to prevent her escape helicopter from landing. Just as they run out, a wounded Mitch, having intentionally stung himself with a [[sea urchin]] to boost his adrenaline, uses a [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]] to blow Leeds up, saving Brody once again. Ellerbee arrives and takes Leeds' henchmen into custody, apologizing to Mitch for doubting  him. Thorpe arrives and begins to berate Mitch for returning to the beach. In response, Brody punches Thorpe in the face. Thorpe is subsequently arrested for his role in Leeds' plan.  In the aftermath, Ronnie and Brody begin relationships with C.J. and Summer respectively. Mitch, having been reinstated, formally inducts Summer, Ronnie, and Brody into Baywatch and introduces them to their new captain, Casey Jean ([[Pamela Anderson]]).

Doug laughs it off, alongside the rest of the group, saying not everyone can handle the graphic image. She charges out of the room, and Kathy follows, telling everyone she's had an emotional week.  Beatriz apologizes and promises to make it up to Kathy. Kathy tells her just to go to bed and stop drinking, since she's had an emotional week. Beatriz heads to Tara's room, where she looks up Doug on the computer, coming across his various controversies and legal problems surrounding his businesses. She then goes back outside to see the guests, performing the song she promised Kathy. She sings a song, and gets into a verbal fight with Doug, upsetting Grant who tells her she needs to leave immediately and he is calling a tow truck to come get her car. Kathy attempts to give Beatriz money, but she declines.  Doug follows Beatriz outside, where he tells her no matter what they do, everything is dying. She leaves and gets into the tow truck, then says she has forgotten something inside. Beatriz picks up a letter opener from Grant's office and walks to the foyer, where she sees Doug on the phone. She charges him and stabs him in the throat; however, it proves to be a fantasy. She drops the knife and walks outside, back to the tow truck. As they are driving next to the ocean, she demands the tow truck driver pull over. She descends over rocks to the beach, walks into the ocean and submerges under water, reawakening in her boat on the mangrove swamp of the film's opening, revealing that the opening sequence is actually a reference to the final one where her murdered goat has gone and where she has now "swum" to.

Prashanth is shell-shocked by the news and breaks up with Nandini without giving her a chance to explain herself.   It emerges later that the raid on the parlor was a fake, and was done so by the Inspector in order to take revenge against the parlor owner who had refused to give bribes to him. When clips of the Inspector planting condom packets surface on TV, Prashanth realizes his mistake and attempts to reconcile with Nandini, who  refuses to have anything more to do with him and tearfully berates him for trusting the media rather than the words of his fianceé. In order to win back Nandini's respect, Prashanth goes on a crusade against Inspector Kodanda, kidnapping his daughter Rachana. He demands that Kodanda publicly confess to his crime of demandng bribes, which led him to plot the parlor owner's downfall. Kodanda appears before the media and admits his wrongdoings, and apologizes to Nandini and Ratna for having destroyed their lives and careers for furthering his own greedy interests. In the midst of the conference, Rachana is freed by Prashanth, and  calls up her father, who rushes to the spot. Rachana is disgusted by the behaviour of her father, and refuses to talk to him anymore, and leaves after informing him that he as a father provided her with everything in the world, but failed to provide the one thing that mattered: a good example of honesty and truthfulness.

He then forces Clare to help wrap the body in plastic, telling her it's her fault. He takes the body outside and burns it. More time passes as Clare is held prisoner. Andi sees a column in the newspaper about Clare being searched as a [[missing person]]. He tells her to pack her things into a backpack under the pretense that he is having the flat [[fumigation|fumigated]].

Radcliffe drew two lines - one in [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and another one in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]]. This line was known as the [[Radcliffe Line]].  Begum Jaan ([[Vidya Balan]]) is a prostitute who runs a brothel between the cities of Sakkergarh and Dorangla. The prostitutes in Begum Jaan's brothel are a number of girls she raised herself, who were either abandoned or disowned by their families and now work for her. The members of the brothel include an elderly woman known as Amma ([[Ila Arun]]), Sujeet ([[Pitobash Tripathy]]), a local worker who brings her customers and Salim ([[Sumit Nijhawan]]), a gunman who guards them and also two dogs. They are pestered by government officers Hari Prasad ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), Iliyas Khan ([[Rajit Kapoor]]) and Inspector Shyam Singh ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]) who visit her and ask all of the residents to evict the brothel, as it lies on the land that the [[Radcliffe Line]] is to pass through. Love is shown to blossom between Sujeet and Rubina ([[Gauhar Khan]]). Begum Jaan's brothel is looked after by Raja Saab ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), under whose protection, they are safe and sound. He pays their taxes and duties. Begum Jaan sends message to him for his help in this matter. He arrives at the brothel with gifts and presents for them and after hearing about their plight, he assures them of help by stating that he would be going to Delhi soon and discuss the matter there. However, he demands to spend the night with young Shabnam ([[Mishti|Mishti Chakraborty]]), who had recently joined the brothel as a mental wreck after abuse. Begum Jaan reluctantly forces Shabnam to sleep with Raja Saab while she sings in the sidelines as he enjoys his night.  After several failed attempts to convince Begum Jaan and her team to leave despite giving them a month's notice, as a last resort, Hari and Iliyas,  enlist the help of Kabir ([[Chunky Pandey]]), an infamous killer in Sonapur, to threaten Begum with her members to vacate the brothel. Raja Saab returns to the brothel one day to inform Begum Jaan that his efforts to save her brothel have failed and now she must vacate the brothel. Begum, who was having hopes from Raja Saab is shocked in dismay. Still, she stubbornly tells Raja Saab come what may, she'll rather die in her house like a queen than die on the streets like a beggar. Kabir proceeds to kill Begum's beloved dogs, even feeding their meat to Begum and her girls. He then kills Sujeet while he is returning from the market with a few other girls of the brothel. He persuades the girls to escape while sacrificing his life. This killing enrages Begum Jaan and her members further. As a result of Kabir's intimidation tactics, Begum asks Salim to train every one of her girls to use weapons and fight back. Intensive training practice sessions are held.  Meanwhile, Masterji ([[Vivek Mushran]]), Laadli's teacher, is in love with Begum Jaan and proposes to her, unaware that another prostitute named Gulabo ([[Pallavi Sharda]]), harbors feelings for him as well. Begum Jaan rejects his proposal and asks him to leave, leading an irate Master to concoct a plan to kill her. He convinces Gulabo to run away from the brothel, betraying Begum Jaan. Gulabo does so but Masterji spurns her and gets her raped by his accomplices inside a horse carriage. She vows vengeance.  That same night, Kabir and his men attack the brothel. Begum and the girls fight back but to no avail. Gulabo returns and later slits Masterji's throat, while he is witnessing the attack on the brothel by Kabir and his goons. However, she has been badly assaulted by Masterji's accomplices and dies. The goons throw lighted torches inside the brothel, causing the building to be engulfed in flames. Begum Jaan and her girls put up a determined fight. Many are killed. She and her four surviving members smile while looking at their home being set ablaze; they walk inside the building and shut the doors. They burn to death as Amma narrates the story of [[Rani Padmini|Rani Padmavati of Chittorgarh]], who refused to fall into the hands of the enemy and instead martyred herself and died a valiant death, just like the plight of Begum Jaan.  As the movie ends, Illiyas, Hari Prasad and Shyam Singh are seen to be remorseful of their actions; Illiyas shoots himself and we are shown the remains of the brothel and the end to Begum Jaan's legacy.

Best F(r)iends
 '''Volume One''': In Los Angeles, a young and lonesome drifter, Jon Kortina, encounters an eccentric [[mortician]] named Harvey Lewis. Harvey takes in the homeless Jon, who is wearing a bloody tee shirt, and agrees to hire him as an assistant in his mortuary. The two become friends and hatch an underground enterprise selling the [[Dental_material#Indirect_restorative_materials|gold fillings]] which Harvey has collected from the teeth of corpses over the years.  Jon meets [[bartender]] Traci Walton; they begin dating and Jon eventually moves in with her. Jon learns some mysterious details of Harvey's past (some involving "the [[Black Dahlia]]"). Upset that Harvey is withholding his share from the dental scrap sales, Jon suspects he is being cheated—suspicions fueled by an overheard conversation of Harvey's with a man named Malmo.   Assisted by Traci, Jon plots to trick Harvey into attending a non-existent [[Rolling Stones]] concert, planning to leave him on the side of the road and drive away with both their shares of their profits. Harvey spots a hole in the stratagem and confronts Jon; in an ensuing struggle Harvey falls from a cliff into the ocean.  '''Volume Two''': ''Volume Two'' is framed by numerous cuts throughout to scenes of Jon in Harvey's captivity. These scenes reveal more about their backstories: that Harvey's lover was murdered, becoming the Black Dahlia, and that Jon's bloody shirt in the opening of ''Volume One'' was the result of an unsuccessful attempt at [[Jumper (person)|suicide by jumping]]. The two bicker and eventually come to terms with their perceived betrayals of each other.  In the "present" scenes, Jon and Traci attempt to open Harvey's safe (which has the outward appearance of an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]); without the correct key, they take the entire safe with them and begin driving toward Colorado. After a close call with a police officer in Arizona over expired tags, Jon and Traci ditch their vehicle and call Traci's Uncle Rick for help.  They travel to Rick's ranch house with the safe, which Jon claims contains his college transfer papers for [[Colorado State University]]. Rick displays odd and intimidating behavior, such as exercising in front of them and forcing Jon to drink a [[Nightcap (beverage)|nightcap]], and Jon has a nightmare about Rick and Harvey.  In the morning, Rick reveals that he's unable to get around the safe's extra security mechanisms, and recommends hiring local locksmith Doc Seagar. Doc walks out to the ranch, but when he surmises that there's something potentially illegal going on he demands $25,000, which Rick refuses to provide. Doc calls his employee Vicente to bring [[nitric acid]] to open the safe and holds Jon, Traci, and Rick at gunpoint while they wait. Vicente recognizes Traci as a figure from his past and becomes enraged, taking her inside to kill her with a knife. Before he can kill her, he and Doc are both shot and seemingly killed by an unseen figure.  As Jon and Rick plot to dispose of Vicente and Doc's bodies and open the safe themselves, Jon discovers Harvey's car in Rick's garage. He confronts Rick and it is revealed that Rick and Traci are actually a romantic couple who have been scamming Jon; Rick had tailed Harvey and Jon the night Harvey fell from the cliff and stole Harvey's car after Jon fled. Rick leads Jon on a trail to murder him, but Harvey kills Rick and saves Jon, revealing that Harvey survived the fall in ''Volume One''. Jon and Harvey make up and return to Rick's house to confront Traci, with whom Jon breaks up, despite her pleas, and leaves alone.  Harvey drives Jon back to Los Angeles to a home he has purchased for Jon, revealing his secrecy in ''Volume One'' to be part of a surprise gift; Malmo was a real estate agent who sold him the house. He also informs Jon that he has enrolled him at a nearby college, and they happily enter the house. The film ends as a still-alive Vicente arrives outside Jon's new home with a thirst for vengeance.

Beyond Skyline
  Mark Corley, a Los Angeles police detective, helps his estranged son, Trent, out of jail just as an alien invasion begins. The entire population of the city is sucked into various spaceships by a blue light. Mark leads a group of surviving humans through underground subway tunnels to escape, though most of the humans are killed or abducted one by one. The survivors – Mark, Trent, transit operator Audrey, and a homeless man known only as "Sarge", who is immune to the blue light due to his blindness – escape to the marina following its nuclear destruction, only to be abducted into the alien flagship by a towering alien tanker.  On board the spaceship, Mark tries to find his son and storms his way into various chambers, where he meets up with survivor Elaine and her transformed boyfriend Jarrod (from the first film). Elaine explains that Jarrod retained control of his mind despite being transformed into a bio-mechanical alien soldier. Though Elaine is three months pregnant, her pregnancy has accelerated and she gives birth to a newborn daughter. Elaine dies during the delivery, and Mark and Jarrod team up to destroy the alien ship by setting alien explosives inside the ship's control systems. As Jarrod fights various alien warriors, Mark rescues Audrey but is too late to save his son. Trent has his brain taken and placed in another alien bio-mechanical machine creature. Sarge sacrifices himself so that Mark, Audrey and the baby can escape from the chamber. Jarrod is killed when he fights the alien leader but destroys the ship, which crashes in rural Laos.  As the alien spaceship repairs itself, Mark, Audrey and the baby are found by a pair of human siblings, outlaw Sua and his sister Kanya, who are evading both aliens and local militia. As they trek through the jungle, the group discovers that the human baby grows at an accelerated rate from a newborn into a three-year-old in just one day. Sua and Kanya lead Mark, Audrey and the baby to a hidden human resistance hideout located in local ruins. There, Harper, a medical officer and former drug smuggler, examines the baby girl and learns about her unique DNA. Harper believes her blood may be the key to defeating the aliens due to her evolving DNA. Using the child's blood and recovered alien technology, Harper develops a serum he believes will free the bio-mechanical soldiers from alien control and restore their human personality. Though Sua insists on killing all the bio-mechanical soldiers, Mark convinces Sua to allow him to save Trent.  While on a patrol, Kanya encounters a four-legged tanker alien and sacrifices herself by luring it into an old minefield left over from the Vietnam war. Though she destroys it, she unwittingly gives away their location to the alien ships searching for the human newborn child. They converge on the human base. During the resulting battle, several members of the human resistance, including Harper, are killed. Mark enters a grounded alien ship, where he uses Harper's serum to turn the mind-controlling blue light into a red light that frees the mind-controlled bio-mechanical soldiers. Before he can deploy it, the alien leader and his horde of alien warriors attacks the human resistance and disables the light. Trent, his mind restored after encountering his father, fights back inside a giant alien tanker. While the alien leader is busy fighting Trent, the child fixes and deploys the red light, freeing the bio-mechanical soldiers, and Trent defeats the alien leader. With Earth saved, Audrey names the girl Rose after Mark's deceased wife.  Ten years later, Rose, now a fully-grown adult, has taken control of an alien ship, and Trent is her second-in-command.

Beyond the Clouds (2017 film)
 An arresting opening shot neatly conveys a city divided. The camera scans a busy road, packed with commuter traffic. It latches onto a young man darting in between the vehicles and follows him over the edge of the embankment and down, under the road bridge to where numerous impoverished families make their homes. The young man, Aamir ([[Ishaan Khatter]]) saunters through the chaos and hops onto the back of a motorbike. What subsequently plays out on the screen is a series of drug deliveries which Aamir makes all over the city.  A police bust interrupts an impromptu dance sequence and results in a kinetic chase through the city which culminates at a laundry, the workplace of Aamir’s sister Taara ([[Malavika Mohanan]]). With the help of an older male colleague Akshi ([[Goutam Ghose]]), Taara conceals her brother, and his stash of drugs. But in Akshi’s mind, his help means that Taara is now somehow beholden to him. He assaults her, against a striking backdrop of sheets which soon turn from lemon yellow to blood red when Taara fights him off using a rock to his head.  Taara finds herself facing life in prison, unless Akshi recovers and can be persuaded to admit his role in the incident. But although he regains consciousness, Akshi is unable to talk. Both Taara and Aamir find hope in their desperate situation through connections with children. Taara befriends Chotu, the child of an ailing prisoner, while Aamir grudgingly warms to Akshi’s mother and two daughters; even if he first toys with the idea of selling the older of the two girls to a local pimp. The climactic ending set against the backdrop of the festival of Holi encapsulate the film’s vivid energy.<ref></ref>

Bleeding Steel
 [[Hong Kong]] Special Agent Lin Dong was told that his daughter Xixi (who suffers from leukemia) is in critical condition. He speeds over to the hospital, but on the way, co-worker Xiao Su calls him that a critical witness is in danger. Agent Lin stops right outside the hospital, pauses, and turns back to protect the critical witness Dr. James.  Dr. James injects himself with a chemical substance stored with a mechanical heart right before the police bursts in to escort him away. They are ambushed by men with exotic black armor and hightech weaponry led by a monstrous-looking man named Andrew, and almost all in the team are killed. Xixi meanwhile dies at hospital. Before Andrew can claim Dr. James, Lin Dong manages to ram him against an oil tank using his car. When Andrew proves uncannily resistant to both the car's impact and the bullets Ling Dong fires against him, Lin Dong shoots the oil tank instead, causing a huge explosion. Both Lin Dong and Andrew are later shown to have survived, although Andrew's injuries have him turned into a [[cyborg]].  13 years later in [[Sydney]], Australia, author Rick Rogers has recently released a book titled ''Bleeding Steel'' about a girl with a [[Artificial heart|mechanical heart]]. A man named Li Sen, disguised as a prostitute, pays a visit to Rogers at his hotel, drugs him and downloads information from his computer. Simultaneously, a black-clad woman and two men with black armor suits attack the building and torture Rogers to reveal the source of his inspiration for the book, while Li Sen hides in the suite's bathtub. The intruders are attacked by Lin Dong, who also tries to find out the same answer. Rogers is killed by the Woman, and the arriving police forces everyone to retreat.  When briefed about the failed operation, Andrew identifies Lin Dong and Li Sen, and sends the Woman after the latter, but Li Sen has already fled. Acting upon the data they purloined from Rogers, Li Sen and Lin Dong separately begin to tail Nancy, a young girl who is plagued by strange nightmares about a laboratory where strange experiments were conducted. In order to deal with them, she has been visiting a spiritualist, who is the source of Roger's manuscript. She is tracked down by the Woman in Black, but rescued and taken to safety by Lin Dong and Li Sen's combined efforts.  Subsequently, Nancy is revealed to be Xixi, resurrected by the efforts of Dr. James, who was working on genetic enhancements of human beings, specifically regeneration, to create immortal bioroid soldiers. James fitted Xixi with a mechanical heart and a biogenetic blood substitute which enhanced her regenerative abilities; but her temporary death left her amnesic, whereupon she was put into an orphanage for her safety, while Lin Dong and his old unit secretly watched over her. Her nightmares stem from James' memories which imprinted themselves on the compound the doctor had injected himself with, and his blood was afterwards used in her resurrection. Andrew, a former Special Forces soldier, was another test subject who infiltrated the project in the interest of a prominent Korean arms dealer to market the bioroids. However, the artificial genome failed on Andrew, slowly consuming him from within. James himself died soon after his operation on Xixi, making her the sole successful ward of his achievements.  Lin Dong takes Nancy and Li Sen to his house, where he locks the young man in his high-security vault, and pays a visit to the spiritualist, whom he finds murdered. Nancy recovers and runs away to take a flight back to James' abandoned home, where she recovers both her old memories of her father and a bank vault key hidden by James. Following her, Lin Dong reunites with Xiao Su, but before he can reach Nancy, she is kidnapped by the Woman in Black and brought separately to Andrew's airborne laboratory. Rejoined by Li Sen, who has managed to free himself, they proceed to the bank vault, where the Woman, while retrieving a videocam from the vault, was trapped and incapacitated by Lin's old unit. Checking the camera's contents, which detail Andrew's bioroid conversion, Lin and Xiao Su surmise that he needs both this information and Nancy's altered genome to bestow the regenerative effect upon himself.  Onboard the laboratory plane, Andrew proceeds to extricate Nancy's blood and inject it into himself to restore his body. Lin Dong, Xiao Su and Li Sen infiltrate the craft but are thwarted by an impenetrable security screen. A scuffle with Andrew's henchmen forces the villain to join the fight before the transfusion is completed, which gives Nancy sufficient time to fully regenerate and come to her father's aid. Lin and his allies cast Andrew into the craft's reactor core, which overloads and destroys the lab. Li Sen is caught in the explosion; Xiao Su and Nancy manage to escape by parachute, but before he can join them, Lin Dong is attacked by Andrew. However, because Andrew has accidentally injected Lin Dong with the enhanced blood during their fight, Lin Dong gains enough power to deprive Andrew of his heart, killing him.  In the aftermath, as Lin Dong, Nancy and Xia Su spend time together as a family, Lin learns from his colleague that Li Sen was the son of the arms dealer who sought to recover James' achievements and take revenge on Andrew for the murder of his family thirteen years ago. He also was a fellow mate of Nancy/Xixi at the orphanage, and had acted out of genuine affection for her. At the same time, Li Sen is shown to have survived and now offering the camcorder tape to the most interested buyer.

Blame! (film)
   In the distant technological future, civilization has reached its ultimate Net-based form. An "infection" in the past caused the automated systems to spiral out of control, resulting in a multi-leveled city structure that replicates itself infinitely in all directions. Now humanity has lost access to the city's controls and is hunted down to be purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. In a tiny corner of the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and dwindling food supplies. A girl named Zuru goes on a journey to find food for her village with a group of friends, only to inadvertently cause doom when an observation tower senses her and summons a Safeguard pack to eliminate the threat. With her companions dead and all escape routes blocked, the sudden arrival of Killy the Wanderer, on his quest to find a human who possesses the Net Terminal Gene, saves her along with Tae, her close friend.  Killy is brought back to the village, where he meets the two elders of the village, who express interest in him after they hear that he has been from '6000 levels below'. Killy even helps to assist with the village's food problem by passing them a large amount of rations. Abruptly, he leaves for the nearby area named by the villages as the Rotting Shrine, and followed by Zuru and Tae, he finds the spoilt machine-corpse of Cibo, a former scientist from before the disaster. Cibo reveals that it is her that built a shield generator that protects the village from the safeguard, and tells the villagers that it is possible to produce more of the rations by going to a nearby 'automated factory'.  Heeding her words, a group of villagers including Tae and Zuru travel to the automated factory in search of more rations. Arriving there, Cibo assists in logging into the system and produces a large amount of rations, much to the delight of the villagers. However, right after she produces a machine for Killy, the system rejects her log-in and builds multiple Exterminators to eliminate the villagers. Cibo, who remakes herself using the system in a cyborg form, leads the villagers, with Tae now having broken her arm, to a railway car and escapes back to the village. During the ride, Killy is knocked unconscious trying to save the villagers.  Arriving at the village, the villagers celebrate at the sudden amount of food. While holding the celebration, Cibo secretly wakes Killy up with only Zuru as a witness and leads him down towards the shield generator with the machine. While heading down, Tae takes her gun to the observatory platform and shoots the shield generator, whereupon it is revealed that she had been converted into a cyborg representative for the Safeguard back at the factory. Sanakan, as she now calls herself, proceeds to kill multiple villagers, deeming them illegal residents.  Killy, realising what has occurred, runs back up to the village on his own. Cibo travels further down at a faster pace, where she sets the machine right next to the destroyed Shield Generator and connects herself to it. Back at the top, Sanakan is killing residents, but the village elders frantically lead the rest of the villagers to the top of the village where they resist her using their remaining weapons. Killy himself enters combat with Sanakan, who after knocking him down, notes that he is a body 'stolen from the Safeguard'. Killy is saved at the last minute by Zuru, who throws his gun to him; which he shoots and destroys Sanakan, but not before Sanakan destroys Cibo.  Cibo, in an alternate dimension, pleads with the Authority, which controls the Safeguard, to let the villagers go. Unable to do so, they allow her to edit their base of levels of the City, which disconnects the level below the village from Safeguard control.  Cibo, now functioning through her only remaining arm, leads the remaining villagers to a trans-level railway car, but right after the villagers get in, an observatory tower spots them. Killy throws the device which has been keeping him safe from the Safeguard to Zuru, upon which he says that he still wants to find the NetControl Gene, which enables human control of the Safeguard. The villagers are then able to escape.  At the end, Zuru's granddaughter narrates that the village still lives in the level below to this day, still waiting for Killy to find the Gene. She then says that Zuru still talks about Killy, to the point that he sounds like the last hope for humanity.

Blood Honey (film)
 Tortured by memories of childhood trauma, Jenibel returns, after a decade away, to her family's fly-in hunting lodge to assist her siblings with their dying father, only to find herself stuck in a life-threatening nightmare.  Summoned by her dying father, Jenibel Heath (Shenae Grimes-Beech), after a decade away, reluctantly returns to her beautiful island home, a remote fly-in hunting and fishing lodge. Waiting for her is bitter family dysfunction and the nightmare of her last childhood memory: the suicide of her mother. Soon, Jenibal finds herself burdened with selling off the family lodge, against the wishes of her family and friends. In a harrowing passage through guilt, loyalty, and devastating memories, Jenibel navigates an obstacle course of personal torment that pushes her psyche to the breaking point. What begins as a journey of forgiveness, devolves into a fatal nightmare and a struggle to maintain not just her sanity, but her life.  Jenibel Heath finally faces what she’s been avoiding her entire adult life: She’s going home.  As a child, following the suicide of her emotionally fragile mother, Jenibel was sent away from her Northern Ontario island home, to be raised and schooled by her aunt in England. Through puberty and adulthood, Jenibel’s bitter hatred of her father, Marvin, results in a vow to never return to her unhappy family roots. However, summoned by Marvin’s dying wish, she journeys homeward with the hope of achieving forgiveness and acceptance. Immediately upon arriving, undercurrents of menace are evident. Jenibel is haunted by the memory of her mother leaping to her death from the top of the water tower. Her brother, Neil, whose narrow experience has never ventured beyond their island, is notably hostile to her arrival. His behavior betrays a deeply-rooted anger, barely contained. Her younger sister, Linda, born with down-syndrome, reminds Jenibel that she has been gone a very long time, effectively abandoning the entire family.  Marvin, Jenibel’s terminally ill father, is hardly frail in his drunken, bitter rants. Indeed, it isn’t long before Jenibel regrets making the journey. She is even thwarted in her hope of expressing a measure of forgiveness towards spiteful Marvin.  In a surprising turn of events, Marvin forces a troubling moral dilemma upon Jenibel. While committing a dramatic act of gruesome suicide, he exacts a verbal promise from Jenibel that she will sell the family hunting/fishing business, and the land itself, to finally set the family "free."  Saddled with the burden of this dying wish, Jenibel learns that Marvin has left the family property, assets, and debts, to be shared between herself and her angry brother, Neil. The one catch: Jenibel is bequeathed a 51% share, giving her controlling interest. This empowers her to fulfill her promise to sell the operation against the wishes of her brother, their employees, and even their kindly neighbor and friend, Dr. Bert Morrison. It’s like her father has played a cruel joke on her. In his last dying breath, he has made her responsible for uprooting their entire family history, their livelihood, community, and the protective isolation that has fostered family dysfunction for generations.  Jenibel begins to have strange visions, or waking dreams – nightmarish and terrifying – involving her dead parents, deep-felt guilt, and even lucid fantasies that the island itself wants to swallow her whole. As hostilities build and her hallucinations become more frequent, Jenibel suspects that the others are slowly poisoning her. With everyone around her angrily attempting to prevent her from selling the family business, she becomes desperate to escape.  Her fears prove to be more than just paranoia. In a climactic denouement, Jenibel is thwarted in her attempts to flee and is literally held captive until she submits to the will of the group. In a final, startling twist, Jenibel’s growing madness proves to be more effective in setting her family “free” than her father might have imagined. If “freedom” requires personal transformation, Jenibel delivers on her father’s wishes in a macabre, unexpected act of vengeance.

His family set up an arranged marriage for him with a girl named Mahalakshmi ([[Hansika]]). He tracks down a criminal named Aditya Maravarman ([[Arvind Swami]]), who mysteriously robs jewels and money, and is holding a supernatural power which enables him to switch souls.  While interrogating Aadhithya, Vikram's best friend Prasad is killed by Aadhithya, who switched his soul into Sathya. When Vikram gets high temper and goes to shoot Aadhithya, Aadhithya again switches his soul and now takes the role of Vikram and masks the killing of Vikram's best friend by saying that both Sathya and Prasad had personal vengeance.  After coming to Vikram's home, Aadhithya (in Vikram's body) comes across Vikram's fiancée. When Vikram (in Aditya's body) is surprised to find himself imprisoned, he explains to Sathya that he is not Adithya and escapes from the prison.  After escaping from the prison, Vikram calls the Chennai City Police Commissioner Rajkumar ([[Ponvannan]]) and tells the mishaps of events which occurred. Aadhithya overhears their conversation and kills the superintendent. Aadhithya says that he has a confession video which says that he blamed Aadhithya (Vikram in his body) for saving his father.  At the same time, Aadhithya (in Vikram's body) unlocks Vikram's police data and takes the video evidence of his father robbing the bank (Aadhithya in his father's body) and threatens to reveal it to the public, but Vikram does not get scared and contacts Chezhiyan ([[Nassar]]) (Aditya's head in archaeology where he gets the manuscript which gives him his power), and Chezhiyan thinks that he is being cheated and goes to Aadhithya (Vikram's body), but Aadhithya reveals himself to be in Vikram's body, and makes Chezhiyan his bait to catch Vikram while in the complex where Vikram was supposed to meet Chezhiyan.  When Aadhithya tracks Chezhiyan, Vikram hides and talks to Chezhiyan who says that Aadhithya's power is only in his body (in which Vikram is) and in other bodies, his power doesn't work, so Vikram uses Chezhiyan to take the manuscript from the commissioner's office. Aadhithya tracks Chezhiyan's phone, finds him and kills him.  Vikram (in Aadhithya's body) goes there and puts a bomb on himself so that Aadhithya may get scared that if his body goes away, he won't be able to use his powers. Hence  Vikram and Aadhithya switch over to their original bodies and now Aadhithya pleads Vikram to diffuse his bomb. But Vikram, who had double-crossed Aadhithya, knocks him out and while taking him to arrest, Aadhithya switches his soul to Vikram's father Arumugam ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) and beats Vikram; after that Aadhithya switches to Maha's body and stabs him and threatens to kill Mahalakshmi if he does not remove his bomb, and so Vikram defuses the bomb. As Vikram had double-crossed and betrayed him, in revenge, Aadhithya drives off with Mahalakshmi.  Vikram chases them and ends up in a coast. Vikram gains the upperhand and knocks Aadhithya, and returns with Maha to home.  In the end, to everyone's horror, Aadhithya survives and wakes up again and glares into the screen which goes off with the title "Bogan 2 will continue".

Bokeh (film)
 American tourists Jenai and Riley arrive in Iceland and visit several landmarks.  Riley has taken his father's [[Rolleiflex]] camera and plenty of film.  When Jenai questions why he prefers it over a modern digital camera, Riley says he prefers to capture the imperfections of the moment rather than have a computer chip auto-correct all the errors.  They visit an old church, and a priest tells them some of its history, calling the pre-Christian times simpler.  Jenai reveals that her father is a preacher, though she says his church was not as pretty.  After retiring for the night, Jenai seems to wakes up in the middle of the night and has trouble falling back asleep.  Looking out the window to admire the view, she sees strange flashes of the Northern Lights in the distance.  Hours later, Riley wakes Jenai to get breakfast.  They are frustrated to find that their lodging is not serving breakfast, then confused when they find no staff.  They continue having trouble locating other people once they leave: the streets are empty, the stores have no staff, and nobody answers their calls.  They spot a running car, and, not being able to locate the owner, appropriate it.  As they discuss the possible reasons why the city has become empty, Jenai repeatedly attempts to contact her family in America to no avail.  The power and water remain running, but the live television stations broadcast only test signals.  Confused, Riley and Jenai return to the hotel after eating, finding no websites have been updated since yesterday.  Riley remains optimistic, and suggests they make the most of the situation.  He leads them on a shopping spree, eventually filling up two SUVs with goods from the seemingly abandoned stores.  He amuses himself by photographing Jenai at scenic locations and performing stunts.  Jenai, however, begins sinking into depression, missing her old life.  She is further frustrated when Riley injures himself during a reckless stunt, and she pressures him to promise not to put himself at any further risk.  As their supplies grow scarcer, Jenai and Riley are forced to ration.  Riley angers Jenai when he eats perishable food out the agreed-upon order based on expiration date.  He says he can simply farm for more food if necessary, but she insists they follow the agreement.  Seeing Jenai's poor mood, Riley attempts to cheer her by bringing her to the abandoned husk of an airplane he found.  Riley calls it beautiful, but Jenai sees only a reminder of the dead world they now inhabit.  After Jenai becomes overwhelmed by the decaying city, Riley suggests they go camping.  Exploring a cabin, they come upon an old man named Nils.  After they give him food and water, he explains that he left the city early on and returned to his cabin.  Initially excited to find another survivor, Riley becomes frustrated with Nils' defeatist attitude. Nils tells Jenai about his home life: as a young man, he left his family for lengthy periods to make money as a fisherman.  When he returned, he found they had changed.  Jenai is disturbed when he says he did not protest this, as he believes it is useless to fight against God's will, which he says does not take humanity into consideration.  The next morning, Riley tells Jenai that Nils has died.  Thinking back to his philosophy, she asks why they should even bother burying him.  Riley insists on doing it because "it's what we do".  After they return to the city, Jenai becomes obsessed with searching for more survivors.  Riley suggests she is looking for answers where there are none and that they should instead be trying to make the best of their new life.  Jenai excitedly opens an email waiting for her on their laptop but is crushed when it is revealed to be a picture from Riley, who is enthused about taking pictures of Iceland in a new season.  Riley, when he returns home, becomes concerned when he finds a package of developed pictures left for him by Jenai.  Looking all over for her, he finally finds her body floating in a geothermal pool.  Riley initially attempts suicide but instead drives off, anguished.

 In a small suburban town in the [[Hudson Valley]], 11-year-old boy genius Henry Carpenter and his younger brother Peter are being raised by their single mother Susan, a waitress who is working on writing children's picture books. Henry has used his intellect to invest successfully in the stock market, building up a very substantial nest egg for his family. Henry also protects Peter from a school bully and builds [[Rube Goldberg machines]] in their tree house. Henry and Susan are both fond of their next-door neighbor (and Henry's classmate), Christina Sickleman, who has recently become glum.  Henry sees Christina being abused by her stepfather, Glenn, the local police commissioner. Henry reports the abuse to [[Child Protective Services|social services]] and the school principal, Janice Wilder, but Glenn has connections throughout the local government, and Wilder is reluctant to challenge the commissioner without "conclusive evidence". Henry is unable to get the authorities to launch a serious investigation that would protect Christina. Henry tells his mother that when someone is in trouble, those who can help must take action. He develops a detailed plan to rescue Christina that he memorializes in a notebook. After a violent seizure, Henry is taken to the hospital, where he is diagnosed with a brain tumor and undergoes surgery. Anticipating his death, he tells Peter to give Susan the notebook. Days later, Henry dies in Susan's arms in the hospital.  Susan is distraught at Henry's death and has difficulty functioning, but when Peter gives her the notebook, she focuses on Henry's plan. Susan tries, but fails, to interest a nearby social services agency in opening an investigation. One night, from the window in Peter's bedroom, she sees Glenn in Christina's room and decides to carry out the plan. The notebook and an accompanying cassette tape describe Henry's step-by-step plan to kill Glenn with a sniper rifle while covering Susan's tracks so that it will be impossible to trace the murder back to her. Susan's alibi is to be provided by executing the murder while both Christina and Peter are performing at a school talent show.  Susan slips away from the talent show and puts the plan into motion. As she is about to pull the trigger, however, she realizes that Henry's plan, though ingenious, is the construct of a child, and that she must act as an adult. She immediately confronts Glenn and tells him that she is going to expose him for what he has done to Christina. Glenn replies that everyone will believe him, not her, and he tells her that he is going to call his police chief to come and bring her in. At the same time, affected by Christina's dance performance at the talent show, Principal Wilder decides to follow through on the abuse accusation and contacts the authorities. Glenn returns home, calls his relative at Social Services, and learns that an investigation is being opened into his abuse of Christina. As the police arrive at his house, Glenn kills himself. Susan legally adopts Christina as her daughter. She also finishes writing one of her children's books, as Henry had urged her to do.

Brad's Status
 Brad Sloan ([[Ben Stiller]]) runs his own [[non-profit organization]], and lives a comfortable life with his loving wife and son, but cannot help contemplating how his old friends Craig Fisher ([[Michael Sheen]]), Billy Wearslter ([[Jemaine Clement]]), Jason Hatfield ([[Luke Wilson]]), and Nick Pascale ([[Mike White (filmmaker)|Mike White]]) are rich and accomplished. Craig works in the White House and published a best-selling book; Jason owns a hedge fund firm; Billy sold a company he founded, moved to Maui, and retired; and Nick is a Hollywood director. Brad's wife, Melanie ([[Jenna Fischer]]), tries to comfort Brad, telling him that they do not need to compare themselves with [[The 1%|the wealthiest 1%]].  In the morning, Brad and his son, Troy ([[Austin Abrams]]), leave for [[Boston]] to visit colleges. After Troy confesses to him that he aims to get into [[Harvard]], Brad sees this as a way to make up for his lost ambitions. After arriving at Harvard to meet with admissions, they find out they have missed the appointment by one day. Brad argues to see the admission committee, but Troy gets him to back down. Melanie suggests that Brad should call Craig, which he reluctantly agrees. At a restaurant, Brad calls Billy to get Craig's number and finds out that Nick got married a few years back, but Brad was not invited. He then laments how his friends' exclusion of him confirms his fears: that he is not only a failure in his own eyes but to others as well. Brad also reflects about his waning sex life with Melanie and how his wife easily gets satisfied, which he thinks might have undermined his ambitions. After talking to Crag, Craig gets Troy a meeting with the famous Harvard music professor and the dean of admissions.  Brad and his son meet Ananya (Shazi Raja), a high school musician friend of his son, and her friend Maya (Luisa Lee). Brad relishes Annaya's idealism and her respect for his work, reminding him of his better days. She also reveals to Brad that she did not like Craig's lectures since she finds him sexist and arrogant. After having dinner with them, Brad and Troy turn down the offer of drinks with them and return to their hotel.  That night, Brad can not sleep so he decides to have a drink with Ananya. He tells her that the non-profit life was a mistake and he should have tried to make money. Ananya lets him know that he is living the [[White privilege|white man's privilege]] and that there are kids she knows in India who are lucky to have dinner, so he should be grateful for what he has in his life.  Troy meets his role model music composer thanks to Craig pulling some strings. However, when Troy tells Brad that his idol is not as cool as he thought, they get in an argument where Brad tells Troy that he cannot judge people for selling out because he is just living in a bubble. The argument soon ends and Troy attends his interviews and gets a great response. During the interview, Jason calls Brad and informs him that his daughter has tethered spine. Brad then accompanies Troy to [[Tufts]], his alma mater, where he calls Melanie and expresses his pride about his son.  The next night, Brad has dinner with Craig, to properly thank him for his help. He finds out that his old friends, the ones he believes are leading privileged lives, are actually living with major problems. Jason Hatfield's company is under legal investigation and his daughter has a serious medical issue while Billy Weather is an addict and alcoholic. Craig also expresses some homophobic remarks about Nick. While Brad tolerates Craig's constant bragging and backhanded compliments, eventually Brad feels conflicted about how Craig treats him, questioning if they really are friends. He leaves their dinner to join Troy at the orchestral performance where Ananya and Maya are playing. Brad is feeling emotional, imagining how he lost in life. That night, Troy explains that everyone in the world is thinking of themselves, and he is the only one thinking about Brad, and he loves him.  In his thoughts, Brad is trying to imagine the future. The movie ends with him repeating "I am still alive," as he turns over and goes to sleep.  At the end of the credits, Troy's imagination that his son is playing music on the street collecting coins is shown again.  
Brawl in Cell Block 99
 Former boxer and drug mule Bradley Thomas ([[Vince Vaughn]]) is laid off from his job at an auto-repair shop. As he arrives home, he sees his wife, Lauren ([[Jennifer Carpenter]]), sitting in her car talking to someone on her cellphone. Bradley approaches her and sees a [[Hickey|lovebite]] on her neck. Lauren confesses that she has been seeing somebody else. Bradley orders her inside the house before he violently dismantles her car with his bare hands. When calm, he enters the house to discuss with Lauren their failing relationship. Bradley decides to forgive Lauren and returns to work as a drug mule.  Eighteen months later, Bradley and a now pregnant Lauren have relocated to a larger, more expensive home. Bradley's boss, Gil ([[Marc Blucas]]), introduces him to Eleazar (Dion Mucciacito), a new business associate, and gives him a new task. Bradley is to sail off the coast with two of Eleazar's men to pick up a package of [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]]. Bradley does not trust the larger of the two men, Roman ([[Geno Segers]]), but accepts the job when Gil offers him three months paternity leave. As they arrive at the pier, Bradley senses they are walking into a police trap and dumps his bag into the water. Bradley instructs the other two men to do the same, but they ignore his order and confront the police in a firefight, wounding three officers. Bradley intervenes by knocking out Roman in order to assist the police. The third drug trafficker dies in the shootout. Bradley is taken into custody and sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison.  During the night, Lauren is kidnapped by men under orders of Eleazar. On the second day of his incarceration, Bradley is visited by the Placid Man ([[Udo Kier]]), who informs Bradley that he works for Eleazar. He tells Bradley that, unless Bradley assassinates an inmate named Christopher Bridge, located in Redleaf Correctional Facility, a separate maximum-security prison, the limbs of his unborn child will be surgically removed by a Korean [[Abortion|abortionist]] and sent to him. Bradley reluctantly accepts.  Bradley picks a fight with multiple guards, until he is overpowered and transferred to Redleaf. There, he meets unforgiving Warden Tuggs ([[Don Johnson]]). Bradley is put into a horrible cell, where the toilet is clogged with feces. Eventually, he is able to go outside for yard time. When a fellow inmate informs him that Christopher Bridge is not located in this section of the prison but in another section known as cell block 99, Bradley fights some other inmates and consequently is thrown into cell block 99.  Warden Tuggs explains that cell block 99 is where he devises special punishments for society's most despised criminals. Bradley is forced to wear a belt that gives him electric shocks at a push of a button, as a punishment for the fight. His cell in block 99 is lined with broken glass and only contains a crude [[squat toilet]] hole. Bradley speaks to a man in an adjacent cell, who informs him that Christopher Bridge does not exist at all. During the night, a young guard named Wilson ([[Tom Guiry]]) escorts Bradley to another, larger cell in block 99, where Eleazar, Roman, and two other gangsters are located. The gang torture Bradley with the electric belt, and taunt him by threatening to call the abortionist. He is shocked so badly that he needs to be dragged back to the cell unconscious.  Bradley devises a plan and tears the lining out of his shoes: he places the rubber between his body and the belt to prevent the shocks. This enables him to ambush Wilson and another guard; resulting in him killing Wilson. Bradley locks the second guard inside his cell. Bradley confronts Eleazar, and brutally kills all three henchmen in hand-to-hand combat. During the brawl, Eleazar calls the Placid Man and instructs him to activate the abortionist. Bradley first tortures Eleazar by breaking his leg, then calls the Placid Man to negotiate for Lauren's freedom. It is agreed that the Placid Man will deliver Lauren to Gil's house. Bradley drags Eleazar into his own cell, across the broken glass, to await confirmation of Lauren's freedom. Warden Tuggs and his men arrive at block 99, but Bradley threatens to kill his two hostages. Bradley states he is waiting for a phone call, and promises that he will surrender peacefully, exactly one minute after the call ends.   The Placid Man and the abortionist follow Eleazar's instructions and drive Lauren unharmed to Gil's house. As they drive away, Gil retrieves a hidden assault rifle and kills the Placid Man. Lauren then takes the rifle and shoots the abortionist. Gil phones Bradley to inform him that his family is finally safe. Bradley speaks to Lauren for the last time, and shares a few words with their unborn child.  Bradley destroys the cell phone, then reminds Warden Tuggs that he still has 60 seconds of freedom remaining. Bradley shoves Eleazar's face into the squat hole and stomps several times on his neck, [[Decapitation|decapitating]] Eleazar and leaving the head at the bottom of the toilet. Warden Tuggs and his men finally enter the cell. Bradley gives one last look at Tuggs, before he shoots Bradley twice, once in the chest and once in the head. The screen cuts to black on the third gunshot and Bradley's body hitting the floor is heard.

Her father Nurullah, who is a teacher was left impaired during The [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet–Afghan War]] and became a hawker, is unjustly arrested after a volatile young member of the Taliban, Idrees, thinks he insulted him while the two were selling goods in the market in Kabul. Parvana's family is left without an adult male relative, as her elder brother Sulayman died years ago, leaving her, her mother Fattema, her elder sister Soraya and her baby brother Zaki without means to support the family, as they are not allowed to go out without a male relative. After Parvana unsuccessfully tries to procure food while going out as a girl, she decides to [[bacha posh|dress as a boy]] and pretend to be Nurullah's nephew, "Aatish," in order to support the family. Parvana frequently entertains Zaki by telling the story of a young man on a journey to retrieve the seeds stolen by the evil Elephant King.  The ploy works, and Parvana is able to get food and money. On the advice of Shauzia, another young girl dressing as a boy to support her family, Parvana goes to [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison|the prison]] where her father is held to try to bribe the guards into letting her see him. The plan fails, and Parvana is driven away. She works to save money to get a larger bribe, taking on hard labor jobs with Shauzia, who is trying to save enough money to escape her abusive father. Meanwhile, Fattema is forced to write to a relative in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], offering Soraya up for marriage in exchange for shelter and protection. Parvana also meets Razaq, who was with Idrees when her father was arrested; the illiterate Razaq pays her to read him a letter that reveals that his wife, Hawla, was killed by a mine on the way to a wedding. He befriends her and continues to meet with her so that she can teach him to read and write.  Parvana and Shauzia take a hard labor job where Idrees is also in attendance.

Parvana and Shauzia manage to hide, and Idrees is abruptly called away to fight in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|a war that has just begun]]. When Parvana returns home, Fattema pleads with her to stop the dangerous ploy, telling her that her relatives accepted Soraya and that they will be collected the day after next. Parvana agrees on the condition that she visits Nurullah in prison to inform him where they will be living, as Razaq has a cousin that lives there that will let her in. She tearfully bids farewell to Shauzia, promising that they will meet 20 years from then. However, as Parvana travels to the prison, Fattema's cousin arrives early and forces them to come with him without Parvana, as the war is starting and the roads will soon be blocked. Fattema eventually stands up to her cousin, refusing to let him take them further, and he leaves the family stranded in the road.  Parvana arrives at the prison, where she finds Razaq. After Parvana reveals that she is Nurullah's daughter, Razaq informs her that his cousin has left to fight, but he will retrieve Nurullah; the prison is being cleared out of weak prisoners unable to fight, and Parvana witnesses their execution. A terrified Parvana gathers her courage to stay by finishing the tale of the boy, who she turns into Sulayman, revealing that he died after picking up a "[[Booby trap|toy]]" in the street, which was actually a [[PFM-1|land mine]] that exploded. Razaq is attacked while rescuing the weak Nurullah, but is wounded nonfatally and reunites father and daughter.

Bright (film)
  In an [[alternate history|alternate present]], humans live in uneasy peace with [[orc]]s, [[elf|elves]], [[centaur]]s, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] and other races after they fought for thousands of years. In [[Los Angeles]], veteran [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] police officer Daryl Ward has been involuntarily partnered with Nick Jakoby, the nation's first orcish police officer. Jakoby faces prejudice from both human cops for his race and from fellow orcs for his position as a police officer. Ward doesn't know how to feel about Jakoby after an incident occurs where an Orc shoots Ward and Jakoby fails to catch the suspect. A previously detained human Shield of Light devotee tells Jakoby that both officers are in a prophecy and that Ward is blessed. While booking the devotee, Ward is approached by Internal Affairs who say they believe that Jakoby put his racial loyalties before his partner. They pressure Ward into trying to get Jakoby to confess on tape so they will have grounds to fire Jakoby.  That night, Ward and Jakoby respond to a disturbance at what turns out to be a Shield of Light [[safe house]]; inside is evidence indicating magic was used. They apprehend the lone unhurt survivor, a young elf named Tikka who possesses a legendary magic wand and can apparently only speak Elfish. As Jakoby puts it, a wand is like "a nuclear weapon that grants wishes", and can only be commanded by a 'Bright' — a person with the rare ability to use magic. If a non-Bright touches a wand, they will explode from the raw magical power.  The moment the four backup officers lay eyes on the wand, they to try to coerce Ward into killing Jakoby and lying about the incident. Ward goes outside and questions Jakoby about the incident earlier with the orc while the four officers discuss their plans to kill Ward, Jakoby and Tikka. When Jakoby explains that the shooter and suspect he let go had different scents, Ward decides that he must trust his partner and kills all officers except Pollard, as he was stopped by Jakoby. The incident, however, attracts the attention of the local human gang Altamira, and the two flee with Tikka and the wand. Leilah, a member of the ominous group Inferni and owner of the wand, arrives at the safehouse minutes later, searching for the wand and Tikka.  The trio flee through Fogteeth Orc clan territory with the human gang's leader Poison in pursuit, wanting to regain the use of his legs through the wand. The gang corners the trio in a strip club where the three prepare to make a final stand against the heavily armed gangsters. The Inferni appear just as the fight begins, giving the trio the opportunity to escape again. At a service station, Ward contacts his friend, Sheriff Deputy Rodriguez, who he hopes will help them in protecting the wand. Rodriguez contacts Kandomere, an elf working for the federal 'Magic Task Force' dedicated to securing, containing and protecting magical objects. Kandomere tells Ward that he will be safe from prosecution for killing his fellow police officers, if they can keep the wand out of the wrong hands. Before Rodriguez can bring them in, Leilah's henchmen attack the trio, killing him.  Ward, Jakoby, and Tikka run into the Fogteeth Orc clan again and are dragged before its leader Dorghu. Enraged at the chaos they are causing, Dorghu orders his son Mikey to kill Jakoby after failing to find out where the wand is. However, Mikey reveals that he was the orc that Jakoby allowed to escape and thus refuses to kill him. Dorghu sends his son away and kills Jakoby himself. As he prepares to kill Ward, Tikka produces the wand she had magically hidden and uses it to resurrect Jakoby, revealing that she is a Bright. The cloaked clan priest pronounces this to be the will of the Prophecy, causing the clan to kneel to Jakoby and allow the trio to go free. Tikka, now trusting them, speaks to them in English for the first time and explains the Inferni's plan. They wish to resurrect The Dark Lord, an ancient mythical figure who will rise from the dead and take over the world. Once a member of the Inferni herself, Tikka had been protected by the Shield of Light and had fled with the wand.  The use of the wand causes Tikka to become ill and the only way to save her is to place her in a magical pool back at the [[safe house]] where they first found her. They return to the [[safe house]] but are ambushed by Leilah and the remaining Inferni. The trio successfully kill the Inferni, but Leilah is resurrected. Just as Ward places Tikka in the magical pool, Leilah strings up Jakoby and knocks both Ward and Tikka out of the pool. Leilah unsuccessfully tries to convince Tikka to join her. Jakoby breaks free and shoots the wand out of Leilah's hand but runs out of ammo before he can kill her again. Out of options, Ward deliberately picks up the fallen wand and is revealed to also be a Bright, using the wand to kill Leilah with an explosion that sets the building on fire. In the ensuing commotion, Tikka disappears and the injured Ward and Jakoby flee from the building. Upon discovering himself alone outside, Jakoby rushes back into the inferno and rescues Ward. Dorghu and his clan appear and perform an ancient orc ceremony signifying to Jakoby that he is now "blooded" – an orcish status only achievable by an act of great bravery.

The Bride (2017 film)
 In 1832, a chemistry doctor called Iosif Gamel presents his thesis to a the Imperial Science Academy of Saint-Petersburg which says that the new lens made out of a new type of sliver can not only capture light, but also a person's soul. This proves to be true despite the academy rebuking Gamel, resulting in the creation of a ritual, in which the souls of dead people are transferred into another body.   A photographer is then shown taking pictures of his dead wife (called The Bride) with carved-out wooden eyes planted on her eyelids. He then travels to a village, where he plans to transfer his wife's soul into a young peasant girl through his wife's ring. He arrives to find the villagers protesting, but he manages to disperse them after killing one of them. The photographer puts the ring on the girl's finger, seals her in the coffin with the dead wife, and prepares to bury the coffin when it suddenly begins to violently shake. When the photographer and his fellow participants in the ritual open up the coffin, they see that the wife's soul has been transferred. The photographer hides the photograph that he took earlier in the basement while waiting for his wife's soul to recover. She awakens one day in her new body, but is appalled at the new situation.  In the present day, college student Nastya marries her fiancé Ivan. She decides to go to his family's house to host their wedding, despite Ivan's objections. They arrive at his family's home, where she is introduced to Ivan's sister Liza. At dinner, Liza gives Nastya a ring with a red-diamond (the ring seen at the beginning of the film), a move which does not resonate well with Ivan. Nastya also begins to experience visions, including seeing clones of herself doing actions in a pattern. One night, she finds Ivan and Liza arguing about keeping Nastya here, and Ivan threatens to leave.  The next day, Liza reports that Ivan has gone into town to see his friends, much to Nastya's dismay since he didn't warn her that he was going. Additionally, she begins experiencing more and more visions, and becomes increasingly suspicious about the family's true nature. She also discovers a secret passage inside the walls of the house, and discovers the photograph of The Bride hidden by the photographer at the beginning of the film.  The increased suspicions lead to Nastya to attempt to leave the house. However, she suddenly sees a family friend walking nearby with a lantern. Nastya follows the elderly woman to the second house on the plot, where she finds her feeding an imprisoned Ivan, revealing that the family had locked him up inside after his argument with Liza, implying that the family wants Nastya to stay. Ivan notices her, and tells her to run as she encounters a white skinned spirit in a black wedding dress. She falls unconscious while attempting to flee, and subsequently experiences a dream. In it, she walks into the same house, but in the same period as in the beginning of the film, where the photographer goes upstairs to see his wife after she has become reportedly ill. A friend tries to convince him not to go, but he goes anyway.  Nastya then sees the photographer being killed by The Bride's malevolent spirit. After killing him, The Bride turns around and says that "she" (referring to another female person) will take her, before attacking Nastya, waking her up. She is taken back to the house, where she is given coffee that makes her purposely fall asleep. Nastya wakes up the next day, with the "wedding" being prepared. While getting dressed, she looks at the photograph of the previous matriarchs of the family, and upon looking at their faces, she realises that they are all the same person. Nastya attempts to escape but is bound up by the ritual members and locked up in a room where she encounters the living skeleton possessed by the spirit of The Bride.  Ivan rescues Nastya and drives away with her in his car. He reveals that his family is the organiser of the ritual and that they needed her so that The Bride's soul could be transferred into another body. He also reveals that the only way to destroy any more chances of soul transfer is to destroy the photograph of The Bride. Nastya reveals that she knows where the photograph is moments before they are T-boned by the ritual members who capture Nastya and leave Ivan for dead.  Nastya is brought back to the manor, where she gets the red-diamond ring put on so that The Bride's soul can be transferred. She is sealed in the coffin and dumped into the ground where she is possessed by The Bride's spirit. When the coffin is opened a possessed Nastya tells the people, "The body is ruined" before convulsing and falling back into the coffin. It is revealed that the ritual failed because Nastya and Ivan had earlier consummated their relationship, leaving Nastya and Ivan non-virgins. The members then disperse, and the leader is killed by the spirit soon afterwards.  Ivan, who had managed to survive the car crash, makes it back to the house and finds the unconscious Nastya. Meanwhile, Liza and her children are confronted by The Bride's spirit, and the children flee to the secret passage. Nastya, remembering about the photograph, goes to the room where she found it, encountering the children there but The Bride's spirit appears. Liza, knowing that the red-diamond ring attracts the spirit, takes it from Nastya, puts it on herself and is possessed by the spirit. Nastya takes the photograph and confronts Liza, who has taken one of the children. Liza attacks her, breaking the photograph in the process. As she is about to kill Nastya, the child calls out to her, snapping Liza out of her possession. She tells Nastya to take care or her children before sacrificing herself by breaking a lantern and dying in the fire, allowing Nastya, Ivan and the children to escape the house.  Soon afterwards, a new family arrives at the house, intending to purchase and renovate it. They notice a hole in the wall, and when they look through it, a figure slides past them, implying that The Bride's spirit is still alive after being burned along with Liza.

Forced to stay underground by his parents, James' only connection with the outside world is an educational children's show called ''Brigsby Bear''. James is obsessed with the show, owning every cassette, and filling most of his room with memorabilia. One night, while sneaking out to hang out on the roof, James sees several police cars approach the home and is taken away from Ted and April, who are arrested.  James is then brought to the police station and meets Detective Vogel, who has been working on James' case. Vogel informs James that Ted and April are not his real parents, and that he has been held captive ever since he was a baby. He also informs James that ''Brigsby Bear'' is not real, and was entirely made up by the Mitchums, with Vogel explaining that they tracked Ted from the studio where the show is made. Vogel then introduces James to his real parents, Greg and Louise Pope, and their teenage daughter Aubrey. As they try to introduce James to his new life, he cannot stop thinking about ''Brigsby Bear'' not being real.  One night, Aubrey takes James to a party. He then starts talking about ''Brigsby Bear'' to his new friends and comes up with the idea to make a movie based on the character to close the series. Spencer, Aubrey's friend who is also a filmmaker, agrees to make the movie with him. After Detective Vogel lends James the props from the show, he begins to make his movie. Spencer also starts uploading episodes of ''Brigsby Bear'' to YouTube, where it becomes a smash hit, generating a new audience to the show and buzz for the movie. Greg and Louise do not approve of James' activities, as they fear it hinders his chances of living a normal life.  While filming in the forest, James uses an explosive he made that detonates and causes a small fire, surprising Spencer. The group is arrested but James takes the blame for it. The police let him go, but they confiscate the ''Brigsby Bear'' costumes and props once again. Determined to continue production, James takes one of his parent's cars out one night, intending to steal back the costumes and props. He takes a detour first to his old underground home, now abandoned and cordoned off with yellow tape. On his way back, James stops by a diner. There he discovers Whitney, the actress who played Arielle and Nina Smiles in the show, just finishing her shift. She tells him how her dual performance was achieved with special effects and that she never knew the true circumstances behind the side acting job, having been told by Ted Mitchum that it was for Canadian public access. As the police arrive outside to take him back, James asks Whitney to reprise her dual role for his film and admits that he developed a longtime crush on her through the show.  Following a recommendation from Emily, the family's psychiatrist, James is placed in a mental institution. Meanwhile, Aubrey shows her parents parts of the movie, where the two realize that making the movie has been making James happy and has been helping him live a normal life. One night James breaks out of the institution to return home and grab some belongings but discovers his family, along with Spencer and Detective Vogel, building a ''Brigsby Bear'' set in their garage and tell him after seeing how happy he is making the movie, they have agreed to help out as well.  James later visits Ted, who is now in jail (along with April) for the kidnapping. James tells Ted about the movie and how it is missing the most crucial part; the Brigsby voice. Ted agrees to record the voice of Brigsby and James finishes the movie (with Detective Vogel fulfilling his early acting dreams by playing a character and Whitney reprising her dual role as the Smiles sisters). On premiere night, the show is sold out and James is worried that no one will like it and stays out of the theatre while the movie plays. When James walks back into the room, he is met with a standing ovation. Happy that the film is a success, James looks over to the stage, he sees Brigsby wave goodbye and disappear.

Call Me by Your Name (film)
 17-year-old Elio lives with his parents in rural Northern Italy. His father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, to live with him and his family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and musical prodigy, initially finds little in common with Oliver, who has a contrastingly carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom for Oliver for the duration of his stay. He spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with his girlfriend, Marzia. Oliver is meanwhile attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.  Elio and Oliver begin a seductive courtship: they swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to Oliver. He sneaks into Oliver's room to smell his bathing suit, and thinks about him while masturbating. During a trip to the post office, Elio confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, Elio and Oliver kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. The two grow distant.  In response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a note on Elio's desk telling Elio to meet him at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and they have sex. They become more physically and emotionally intimate over the next few days, having sex frequently while keeping their relationship secret. Smitten with Oliver by this point, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.  As the end of Oliver's stay approaches, the couple find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are aware of the bond between the two, recommend they visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns to the United States. After spending three romantic days together, Elio, heartbroken, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up and take him home. Marzia, who still wants to be friends with Elio, is sympathetic; his father, seeing Elio's sadness, tells him he was aware of their relationship, confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth, and urges Elio to learn and grow from his grief, instead of quickly moving on.  During [[Hanukkah]], Oliver telephones Elio and his family to tell them he is engaged to be married. Oliver tells Elio he "remembers everything" very clearly. After the call, Elio sits by the fireplace, distraught, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner.  
Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie
  In the city of [[Piqua, Ohio]], two fourth-grade friends and next-door neighbors named [[Captain Underpants#Main|George Beard]] ([[Kevin Hart]]) and [[Captain Underpants#Main|Harold Hutchins]] ([[Thomas Middleditch]]) are the pranksters at their school, [[Curly Howard|Jerome Horwitz Elementary School]]. They excessively pull numerous pranks on the cruel teachers, many of which are directed at their mean-spirited principal, [[Captain Underpants#Main|Mr. Benjamin "Benny" Krupp]] ([[Ed Helms]]), putting the two at odds with him. The duo also create comic books about a superhero named [[Captain Underpants]], who fights crime while wearing underwear and a cape. They distribute these to their schoolmates through a comic company called Treehouse Comix Inc., located in their treehouse. George and Harold's pranks come to an apparent end after they're caught tampering with a toilet invention, the [[Captain Underpants#Villains|Turbo Toilet 2000]], made by the school's local snitch and intellectual, [[Captain Underpants#Main#|Melvin Sneedly]] ([[Jordan Peele]]), on video. Finally having solid proof of the boys' antics, Mr. Krupp excitedly prepares to annihilate their friendship by putting them in separate classes.  To prevent this, George hypnotizes Mr. Krupp with a 3D Hypno Ring he received out of a cereal box. The boys see that Mr. Krupp bears an odd resemblance to Captain Underpants without his toupee and command him to be Captain Underpants. The boys soon learn the severity of their actions when "Captain Underpants" begins causing problems around Piqua. To prevent these issues, the boys take him to their treehouse, where they discover that they can turn Captain Underpants back into Mr. Krupp by splashing water on him and can turn him back into Captain Underpants by snapping their fingers. Knowing that Mr. Krupp will continue trying to separate them, they decide to settle with Captain Underpants but insist that he be dressed up as Mr. Krupp under the pretense of a "secret identity," to which Captain Underpants agrees. His sudden personality change even manages to attract the attention (and affection) of the school's shy lunch lady, Edith ([[Kristen Schaal]]).  Just when George and Harold believe that their troubles have ended, Jerome Horwitz Elementary School is visited by an odd, German-accented scientist named [[Captain Underpants#Villains|Professor Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants, Esq.]] ([[Nick Kroll]]), or as he calls himself, Professor P. Captain Underpants (disguised as Mr. Krupp) hires him to be the new science teacher, but George and Harold are suspicious of him due to his violent and short-tempered attitude, as well as his resume's content. As it turns out, Poopypants is seeking to get rid of laughter altogether due to the fact that people have made fun of his name for years. He recruits Melvin to help him, as he discovers (after reading a comic book George and Harold made featuring characters resembling them) that Melvin's brain makes him incapable of laughing or having fun.  After a school carnival accident caused by Captain Underpants, Mr. Krupp finally separates the boys. Professor Poopypants tries to take over the town with a giant version of the Turbo Toilet 2000, fueled by the school cafeteria's rotten leftovers left out by Edith and uses Melvin's brain to turn the children into glum, humorless zombies. Captain Underpants tries to stop the villain, but due to having no actual superpowers, is effortlessly defeated and thrown into the toilet. George and Harold are captured and nearly turned into zombies, but are able to escape after Professor Poopypants mentions the planet [[Uranus#In culture|Uranus]], causing the boys to laugh and damage the Turbo Toilet 2000's computer, restoring the children back to normal. Upon consuming the mutated leftovers, Captain Underpants acquires superpowers and, with George and Harold's help, defeats and shrinks Poopypants, though he escapes on a bumblebee shortly thereafter.  Knowing that they cannot control Captain Underpants, George and Harold destroy the Hypno Ring to permanently change him back into Mr. Krupp. Feeling that Mr. Krupp would be nicer if he had friends, the boys set him and lovesick Edith up on a date, thus making Mr. Krupp have a change of heart. Krupp returns the comics he took away from George and Harold, and even admits their comics are funny. However, the toxic waste from the Turbo Toilet 2000 transforms all [[Captain Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets|the toilets]] into vicious monsters which attack the restaurant at which Mr. Krupp and Edith are dining. Upon snapping his fingers, Mr. Krupp once again becomes Captain Underpants, carrying George and Harold away to help him fight them, much to Edith's surprise and admiration.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], George and Harold realize that the secretary, who they put on hold before by faking a contest with a cash prize of $1 billion, has been on the phone for the entire film, so they talk over the phone causing the secretary to drop the phone ending the call which makes the secretary angry, and they make a new comic based on her reaction.

Cars 3
  [[Lightning McQueen]], now a seven-time Piston Cup racing legend, and the other veterans of the Piston Cup, find themselves being displaced by the next-generation rookies such as [[Jackson Storm]], outfitted with the latest technology to break speed records. As the season progresses, the amount of new racers begin to increase, resulting in many veterans either retiring, or being fired by their sponsors, to make way for the new generation. Then, in the last race of the season, McQueen tries to catch up to Storm and the other leaders, but loses control and gets into a violent rollover crash, leaving him badly injured.  Four months later, while recovering in [[Radiator Springs]], McQueen isolates himself from his friends and spends his time watching footage of his late mentor, [[Doc Hudson]], whose career ended in a similar accident, and McQueen fears that he might meet the same fate. After receiving some encouragement from his girlfriend, [[Sally (Cars)|Sally]], McQueen decides to continue racing and call his sponsors from Rust-eze, Rusty and Dusty, who surprise him by telling him they opened a new state-of-the-art training center known as the Rust-eze Racing Center, only to reveal that they have sold the team to a new owner, Sterling. There, McQueen meets Sterling, and is assigned to train under [[List of Cars characters#Cruz Ramirez|Cruz Ramirez]]. McQueen becomes impatient with Cruz's methodical approach to training, and he attempts to use a high tech racing simulator - only to end up damaging it. Sterling decides that McQueen is unfit to race, and instead, plans to use him for promotional materials only. McQueen contests this, and instead, makes a deal; if he should win the first race of the season, he will get to determine when he retires, otherwise he will retire on the spot. Sterling accepts the deal, but assigns him to work one-on-one with Cruz.  McQueen tries to train on the nearby Fireball Beach in order to build up his speed, but he finds most of his time spent on teaching Cruz how to drive on various terrain. McQueen then attempts to race at a dirt track called Thunder Hollow, and inadvertently ends up competing in a [[demolition derby]] called ″Crazy Eight″ that Cruz wins, and her elation leads to McQueen's humiliation on TV. Angry for apparently wasting training time, McQueen rages at Cruz and in the process accidentally breaks her trophy. Upset, Cruz reveals that she had wanted to be a professional racer like McQueen her whole life because he inspired her, but never started a race due to feeling intimidated and outclassed by the other race cars. She resigns as McQueen's trainer, and heads back to the training center.  Guilty and with no other options, McQueen calls up his friend [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]], who suggests that he should talk to Doc's mentor, Smokey in Doc's hometown of Thomasville. McQueen catches up to Cruz, and convinces her to rejoin him. In Thomasville, McQueen meets up with Smokey, who recounts how, despite his forced retirement, Doc found a new happiness in training McQueen. After McQueen accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and his friends help McQueen learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage with Cruz as his [[sparring partner]]. However, during the last practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes him, giving him a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] to his crash, shaking his confidence.  At the race in Florida, McQueen is coached by Smokey from the pits, and manages to gradually push up through the ranks. Sterling, who still believes McQueen cannot win, orders Cruz back to the center, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. McQueen overhears this, and remembers Cruz's speech about wanting to be a racer. He devises a plan; the next time he pits, he tells his crew to outfit Cruz in his racing number to try and finally beat Storm, against Sterling's wishes. Cruz is initially shaken by her lack of confidence, but Smokey and McQueen help her to pull ahead. On the last lap, Cruz catches up to Storm. Storm, feeling threatened, tries to intimidate her - even to the point of ramming her against the wall, but she uses one of Doc's tricks to repel off it, take the lead, and win.  As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer made by [[List of Cars characters#Tex Dinoco|Tex Dinoco]]. Sterling reminds McQueen about his bet, but then McQueen's name is shared with Cruz's on the leaderboard as victors, since both he and Cruz raced with the winning number, thus winning the deal. Tex then goes to speak with Sterling, offering a deal of his own. Sometime later, McQueen and Cruz return to Radiator Springs, decked out in Doc's old color and number, respectively. McQueen reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling, and McQueen decides to continue racing, and to be Cruz's crew chief.  In the [[post-credits scene]], Mater at his [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] tries to answer an incoming call from his phone. Somehow he accidentally touches his reception antenna and his [[phone]] goes dead, much to his dismay.

Cargo (2017 film)
  In a world overtaken by a [[virus]] that turns people into [[Zombie|zombies]] within 48 hours, husband and wife, Andy and Kay, and their one-year-old daughter, Rosie, are living safely on a [[houseboat]] in rural Australia.   While relocating for the night, Andy spots two children playing on the shore of the river. He shouts out to them, but continues the cruise after the father, noticing Andy, flashes a revolver in his belt. Later that day, Andy is using a net to fish supplies out of the water. Kay mentions their food rations are starting to run out, but Andy debates her plans to go on land. The scene changes to one of a young [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] girl attaching leaves to her shoes. It goes back to Andy after a minute, who has spotted an abandoned sailboat, proceeding to investigate it. He retrieves food, and presents it to a skeptical Kay.   After reassuring her the [[sailboat]] he ransacked was safe, Kay decides to return by herself to try and collect more supplies. Andy had previously left when he heard thuds coming from a door in the wall, but Kay, unaware of this, is presumably attacked by a zombie that emerges from the door.  Andy awakens to Rosie crying, and goes in search of Kay. She is in the bathroom of the houseboat, trying to restrain the bloodflow from a bite on her knee. She is next seen investigating a pack that was previously acquired by Andy from the river. In it is contained a bracelet that measures the amount of time left for an infected, which Kay puts on, and a spring-loaded dagger that can be used on a zombie's temple to kill them. Andy and Kay discuss their plans, confirming her vulnerability. The family decides to abandon the houseboat and venture to a hospital. They pass by the burning remnants of a body.  Thoomi, the Aboriginal girl, is drawing in a sketchbook. She leaves behind the picture of a man with his head in the ground, then leaves her shelter with a rabbit carcass, which she throws into a pit. Gargling and crunching are heard and she covers her ears.  Andy and Kay have found a vehicle. While Andy fills the petrol tank, Kay notices a yellow slime on the seat back. They narrowly evade a zombie trudging towards them. As they drive away, one is seen struggling to lift its head from the ground. They stop on a deserted stretch of road so Andy can look at a map, and Kay change Rosie's diaper. She collapses offscreen, convulsing and throwing up blood while Andy holds her steady.  Thoomi is seen once more throwing a snake carcass into the pit, but no sounds are heard. She climbs down to check, and then exits hastily.  Kay comes to her senses and checks her wound in the car to see it is oozing yellow slime. In a fit she exits the car and has a shouting match with Andy, angered he has been trying to keep her developments from her. He subdues her and convinces her to continue with him. Andy breaks the door handle to keep Kay from trying to escape again. On the road, Andy is distracted by a lone man and consequentially crashes the car into a tree, impaling Kay. Andy faints from shock, leaving Rosie strapped in her seat. He comes to hours later and tries to wake Kay, but realizes she has already converted, as evidenced by pus around her eyes and mouth. He is bitten by her while trying to exit the car. Following this, Andy approaches the car, Rosie sitting a distance away safely, and uses one of the daggers on Kay. He takes her bracelet and places it on himself instead, then begins travelling on foot with Rosie on his back. She cries for a great part of the journey, until he uses Kay's perfume to calm her. While resting, he spots the man that had caused their crash, but realizing he is a zombie, prepares to defend himself. Thoomi appears to dissuade Andy from hurting the man, her father, and cuts her hand with a rock to draw blood and lead him away.  Andy arrives at the town he intended to reach, entering a school and meeting Etta, a retired teacher. She helps him clean his wounds, and informs him that all the Aboriginal people have returned to their ancestral homelands, including all of her former students. Andy steps outside and sees fires in the distance, started by the Aboriginals. A woman is seen calling for Thoomi. That night, in a hospital room, Andy has his first seizure. He awakens the next morning, going outside to meet Etta, who tells him to seek a man named Willie, Thoomi's father, to take care of Rosie. She explains the purpose of the fires, started by Aboriginal hunting parties that are cleansing the land by killing zombies they encounter. Etta warns Andy to stay out of their range. On his journey Andy stops at some ruins to give Rosie water. He passes several zombies with their heads in the ground, hastily leaving the area, but one rises and proceeds to follow him. He finds a truck and attempts to hijack it, but is stopped by a man named Vic, who saves Andy from the zombie that had been after him, of which Andy was unaware. Vic is trapped under a tank and gives Andy the keys, making him promise to rescue him first, and then they can escape approaching zombies together. Vic takes Andy to his shelter, an outpost formerly part of a gas plant. He meets Vic's wife, Lorraine, who is quietly surprised to see other "people who are still people". Vic encourages Andy to leave Rosie with Lorraine so the two men can go to work. Work is shooting groups of zombies and collecting their valuables, as Vic believes when the country returns to normal people will want riches again. Vic attracts the zombies by imprisoning live, healthy humans inside cages as bait. Andy is perturbed to see Thoomi trapped, along with an old man in a cage. At the shelter, Lorraine is taking care of Rosie. As the power goes out, Rosie becomes uncomfortable. Lorraine attempts to cheer her up, but discovers slime on her stomach.  Vic visits another cage with Andy. He uses entrails, a radio, and blood to lure zombies, all factors which make Andy question himself for a moment. The men return to the shelter, where Lorraine briefly mentions cleaning up Rosie. Andy plays with his daughter before setting her down in a makeshift crib, his hand starting to spasm. He leaves the shelter with a dagger, but cannot bring himself to use it. Lorraine comes upon him, confessing that she is not Vic's wife, and that Vic let her husband die along with other gas plant workers to save himself. Vic approaches them and knocks Andy out with the butt of his rifle out of suspicion, the latter awakening chained in the same cage as Thoomi. They agree to help each other escape by using the combined force of many zombies to open their cage, returning successfully to the shelter, rescuing Lorraine, Rosie, and the keys to both cages and chains. They don't get very far before Vic emerges from the shelter and shoots at them. Lorraine sacrifices herself for them to escape.  Thoomi leads Andy to the cage he visited earlier, but the man inside (who she tells him is her tribe’s “Clever Man” or shaman) is gone. They evade Vic tracking them down, and spend the night in a small gulch. After releasing each other of their chain, they are presumed to fall asleep, until later in the night Thoomi wakes up to heavy breathing and hides with Rosie while Andy rubs his face against blood on the wall. The following morning Andy and Thoomi have a conversation about her father's health, which results in Thoomi running off after Andy asserts her father will not get better. The same woman who has been seen calling for Thoomi (later revealed by Thoomi to Andy to be her mother and Willie’s wife) leaves Willie's jacket on a tree limb. Thoomi arrives to see her father has been straddled atop the tree, dead (as part of Aboriginal burial traditions). Andy arrives to comfort her, but leaves promptly when he cannot console Thoomi, as she irrationally blames him for delaying her (she believed the Clever Man could restore her father’s soul to his body, as she is unaware that the zombie phenomenon is biological rather than supernatural). He has another breakdown and begins to try and burrow his head into the ground. Thoomi remains at the tree grieving, but is able to hear Rosie's cry and goes to retrieve her. Andy is confronted by Thoomi after he rouses, who has decided to help him reach the river.  They travel by motorboat to the campsite where Andy last saw the family, inspecting the RV in which the family was staying. Andy leaves with Rosie to go find the family, while Thoomi stays in the RV. He meets the father, who has been bitten, and once again shows him his revolver. The father says it contains six bullets, and that Andy can have the remaining two once he uses them on himself and his family. Andy retreats as three gunshots are heard in the distance. The fourth is delayed while the father follows Andy, using it on himself and collapsing behind him. Andy collects the gun as intended and debates whether to shoot himself as well. Thoomi rushes to them, having removed her leaves and claiming she is ready to go home. They set off together towards the sight of smoke on a nearby hill.   As they pass through a train tunnel, they encounter Vic. Thoomi hides with Rosie inside a parked vehicle on the tracks, while Andy tries to distract Vic. The two men fight, and Andy shoots once, hitting Vic in the abdomen. During the struggle, Vic manages to obtain the revolver and also shoot Andy. Andy, briefly defeated, is unable to help Thoomi, who Vic pulls from the car, in the process hitting her head on the rails. She lies in pain, Vic grabbing hold of Rosie. Andy rises to check on Thoomi, who is still alive, and then Rosie, who Vic is cradling, lamenting the incidental death of Lorraine. He tearfully hands over Rosie so that Andy can renew his walk with a hurt Thoomi.  On the way Andy has another lapse, almost indulging in decayed meat. With little time left, Andy asks of Thoomi to promise to look after Rosie, with whom Andy shares a farewell before preparing himself for the finalization by placing a guard in his mouth, binding his wrists, and wrapping the meat from earlier on a stick. He then succumbs, his eyes crusted over.  The Aboriginal warriors have finished their raid, but Thoomi calls out to them with a whistle, drawing attention of the woman, her mother. Thoomi and Rosie are riding Andy, who is guided by the meat on the stick, and being perfectly harmless is detained by the warriors while Thoomi and Rosie are welcomed back by her mother. One of the warriors, the Clever Man who managed to escape his cage on his own, attempts to strike Andy with his spear, but Thoomi stops him. She takes out Kay's perfume bottle, and sprays it one last time, the smell pacifying Andy, for a moment returning his consciousness as he realizes Rosie is finally safe. Thoomi then allows the Clever Man to put Andy out of his misery.  The Aboriginal people are seen traveling to a refuge of many of their people where they are welcomed heartily. As Thoomi and her mother inspect Rosie, the words Thank You are read on her stomach, written in white paint which Thoomi and the warriors have used to disguise their scent from the zombies. The final shots of the movie are of Andy's plaid shirt and Rosie's fishing bait mobile hung on a tree.

He then proceeded to show a naked photo of the criminal's wife to prove Castillo's affair with her.  Meanwhile, at the training center for the [[California Highway Patrol]], Jon Baker ([[Dax Shepard]]) is a trainee who is awaiting his final exam to graduate. Failing a series of simple tests, he is placed at the desk of CHP Sergeant Gail Hernandez ([[Maya Rudolph]]) for a final interview and decision. Hernandez acknowledges his ability to "ride" a motorcycle better than the majority of the cadets she trained. She grants him probationary approval to graduate pending a performance review based on Citations, Arrests and Good overall evaluations from Superiors.  During the interview he mentions his past as a motocross competition champion and the fallout resulting from his injuries on the track. After losing all he had gained, from sponsors to contracts, Baker's wife Karen ([[Kristen Bell]]) divorced him and allowed Baker to remain a resident of their estate in the guest house.  Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the [[California Highway Patrol]] begins a pursuit with a crew of robbers that ride motorcycles following their robbery of an armored car. During the chase, a CHP Air Unit is overhead. The helicopter's pilot recognizes the Armed Guard that is being held hostage and is told by the hostage taker to jump from the chopper to prove his love. The pilot subsequently jumps to his death. The guard is told by the Hostage Taker, referred to as "L.T.", to return the money he stole as part of the crew.  In Miami, Castillo's boss Agent Peterson ([[Isiah Whitlock Jr.]]) notifies him that his actions resulted in the Bureau convening a review panel to consider terminating Castillo from the FBI. Following the conversation, he orders Castillo to go undercover in California to help investigate the series of armored car robberies with alleged connections to the police.  Castillo is given the alias of Officer Frank (Ponch) Poncherello in the [[California Highway Patrol]]'s LA District. Unknown to the officers, CHP Lieutenant Raymond Kurtz ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) is the leader of a small group of corrupt CHP Officers. The group is committing these robberies to gather money for Kurtz's heroin addicted son ([[Justin Chatwin]]) to escape the access to drugs he has in LA.  Now undercover as Officer Poncherello he arrives at his assigned station. There he is partnered with Baker who immediately shows the inability to speak to women as fellow Officer Ava Perez ([[Rosa Salazar]]) invites him to take a motorcycle tour of her favorite route. Baker mistakes this as an attempt to hit on him, which angers Perez greatly.  Following a long time in a public restroom, Baker  accuses Ponch of masturbating multiple times a day to refrain from his sexual addiction. As they discuss the issue, Ponch brings up the fact that if Baker hasn't had sex with his wife for than a year, it obviously means that someone is doing her for him. During that argument, the robbery crew makes another attempt at an armored truck job. The crew shoots and kills two CHP Officers during the attempt prompting a police response. While responding the crew evades them using [[Ducati]] motorcycles. Baker then saves Ponch from being run over by a trucker who was unfocused on the road.  During another chase, Baker encounters Kurtz' son. The two begin a pursuit that results in Lieutenant Kurtz running Baker over with a SWAT van after his son is decapitated and subsequently killed by a steel cable. Officer Perez begins CPR and the air unit is called in to airlift Baker to a hospital while Kurtz escapes easily. Following the incident, Castillo is held responsible by the FBI Agent in charge of the case for the 3 CHP officers and 2 FBI agents that were injured.  During that time, Baker is confronted by Officer Perez and asked if he would like to get a  ride home from her. Baker responds that he would like to wait for his wife to come for him. Perez leaves upset about the encounter. While this is happening, Castillo mistakenly dials Captain Jane Lindel and begins sexting her. Upon seeing her naked and having an episode of [[Premature ejaculation]], Castillo destroys his phone.  The next day, Peterson travels to LA to speak to Castillo since his phone wasn't working. Upon seeing the level of destruction Castillo caused, Peterson agrees with the panel's decision and terminates Castillo from the FBI. With no one picking him up from his discharge, Baker is met by Castillo and the two discuss the sexting issue and his termination from  the bureau.  Baker and Castillo return to the Baker residence to find that Karen ([[Kristen Bell]]) and her new boyfriend Rick ([[Josh Duhamel]]) sold the house and all of Baker's assets to another family. They sit down and enjoy dinner together while discussing the case. There, after seeing the photo of the severed head of the suspect, Baker realizes that the suspect competed against him in the Motocross sport. They begin a simple [[Google Search]] that reveals the full legal name of the suspect and the clear connection to the CHP Lieutenant as the suspect was a motocross competitor named "Reed Jr". The search gave a Wikipedia page that made the connection to the Kurtz family as the Lieutenant's son.  Together, they approach CHP Captain Jane Lindel ([[Jane Kaczmarek]]) to demand resources from the CHP and to arrest the five officers they've discovered to be working with Kurtz. However, Castillo realizes that he was fired from the FBI and no longer acts as a officer of the law. Captain Linden subsequently swears him in as a CHP Officer. Meanwhile, Kurtz Jr's cousin and corrupt CHP Officer, Brian Grieves ([[Ryan Hansen]]), was discharged by fellow corrupt CHP Officer and Castillo's love interest Lindsey Taylor ([[Jessica McNamee]]). Officer Ava Perez, upon arrving too late to apprehend them, begins recruiting a group of officers to go on the hunt.  Now formally a CHP Officer, Castillo recruits Baker into the hunt for the Kurtz crew. As they gear up, Kurtz sends a photo of Karen tied up and demands that they come to a location in the middle of the desert. There, Kurtz opens fire and shoots Castillo's fingers off. As Kurtz enters he begins a fistfight with Baker and Castillo. During the fistfight, fellow CHP members led by Officer Ava Perez encounter heavy gunfire from the corrupt Officers guarding the location.  Following an attempt to shoot Kurtz, Baker shoots an explosive resulting in a massive explosion of the bunker. However, Kurtz is still alive and begins another fistfight with Baker. Lindsey Taylor arrives and fakes an arrest. She places the pistol in Kurtz' hands and reveals herself as a crew member. Kurtz fires the pistol into Baker's arm three times with the third bullet splinting off of his titanium arm implant into Kurtz' head, killing him instantly. Baker reveals his arm was titanium following an injury in a motocross competition that he won 1st place in. Meanwhile, a fistfight begins between Officer Perez and Taylor ending in Perez taking Taylor into custody.  While in the ambulance to the hospital, they encounter a Paramedic ([[Erik Estrada]]) who treats Castillo's injuries. With them is Officer Perez, who was asked to ride in the ambulance by Baker. Baker and Perez begin having sex in the Ambulance as Castillo and the Paramedic converse, in Spanish, on Perez' body and Baker's reluctance to perform analingus. The movie ends with Perez acknowledging the comments and revealing that she does speak Spanish, understanding what they're saying.

Mae's friend Annie Allerton works at The Circle, a tech company where Mae gets a job in Customer Experience. At a company meeting, Eamon Bailey (The Circle's CEO) introduces SeeChange, which uses small cameras placed anywhere to provide real-time video. At work, Mae rises in The Circle, embracing social networking. At a further company presentation emphasizing the need for accountability in politics, The Circle's Chief Operating Officer (COO), Tom Stenton, introduces a political candidate who has agreed to open her daily workings to the public through Circle.  Mae again sees a man from the party, Ty Lafitte. He takes her to an area where he says that all information on everyone is to be kept. Mae becomes embarrassed, as Ty is the creator of True You, a popular Circle product, and she had not recognised him. He tells her that True You has become something he did not intend. Mae is shown a picture of a light fitting, made by Mercer, in the shape of (or from) deer antlers. She photographs it and shares it on her Circle profile. The image attracts significant negative attention to Mercer, with people accusing him of killing real animals. Distressed by Mercer’s reaction to this, Mae goes kayaking at night and the rough waters cause her kayak to capsize, requiring rescue by the Coast Guard. The next day, Eamon says that SeeChange cameras recorded her at the kayak premises and in the water, which is how the Coast Guard was able to save her. At the next meeting, Eamon introduces Mae to the crowd and they discuss her experience of the rescue. The kayaking experience moves her to become the first circler to go "completely transparent”, which involves wearing a small camera and exposing her life to the world 24/7. Mae's transparency damages her relationships, as she accidentally sees her parents having sex and they become distant from her soon after.  At a board meeting, Eamon announces support from all 50 states for voting through Circle accounts. Mae takes it a step further and suggests requiring every individual to have a Circle account, which they can then use to vote. Eamon and Tom approve, but the suggestion upsets Annie. At the next company-wide meeting, Mae says that The Circle believes it can find anyone on the planet in under 20 minutes and introduces a program to find wanted felons in the same time frame. The program identifies an escaped prisoner within 10 minutes, which causes the Circlers in the audience to erupt in applause. Mae uses this successful test to suggest transparency can be a force for good.  Mae says that the program can find anyone, not just wanted felons, and someone suggests Mercer. Mae is initially hesitant to use the program to locate Mercer, but Tom persuades Mae to continue, asking if they can break their record of 10 minutes. Mercer is quickly located in an isolated cabin where he works on his antler projects. Startled by this, he flees from the cameras to his truck and proceeds to lead those tracking him on a car chase. Not long into the escape attempt, Mercer loses control of his truck and drives off a bridge to his death, which horrifies Mae. She is seen in bed, three days later, still mourning the loss of Mercer. She calls Annie, who has also left The Circle, to her apparent benefit. Mae, however, finds that connection with others helps her cope with Mercer's death. Mae returns to the Circle, despite her parents' pleas. Mae calls Ty to ask for a favor, and Ty tells her something that he has discovered. At the next company-wide meeting, Mae explains how connection has helped her recover. She speaks with Eamon, and invites Tom onstage, then invites both Eamon and Tom to go fully transparent. She explains that Ty has found all their accounts, even the accounts that their wives were unaware of, and exposes them to the world, as no one should be exempt. Eamon and Tom, clearly upset, try to save face before Tom leaves the stage.  Mae reiterates her point of transparency being good, with the support of the audience. Mae goes kayaking again, untroubled by the drones that surround her.

Mia becomes aphonous after this shock and is left under the protection of her stepmother Angelica, since Mia is the only heir of the ''Megaride'' and, according to Lo Giusto's plan, she is going to sign after her 18th birthday a contract that will give all her inheritance to Lo Giusto. Mia lives with Angelica and her cruel daughters that treat her like a servant and call her ''Gatta Cenerentola'' (''Cinderella the Cat'') because of her habit of crawling inside the ducts of the ship like a cat. The ''Megaride'' remains in the harbor for 15 years and Angelica turns it into a sleazy brothel. The dream of Lo Giusto and Angelica is to turn the city of Naples, into a capital city of crime and drug recycling.  Primo Gemito, formerly Basile's bodyguard, tries to find evidence to frame Lo Giusto, but he is injured and almost killed by Angelica's daughters who work as prostitutes in the brothel. Primo is saved by Mia, who was under his protection when she was a baby and they both recognize each other even though 15 years have passed. Thanks to Mia, Primo finds all the evidence he needs, including images of the hold of the ship where Lo Giusto has been throwing the corpses of his enemies. Primo wants to bring Mia away from the ''Megaride'', but she refuses to leave her father's ship.  Meanwhile, Lo Giusto comes back to Naples on Mia's 18th birthday, after a long absence: when Mia is going to sign the transfer of property, Lo Giusto and Angelica will be free to marry after killing Mia. However, Lo Giusto confesses that he has never loved Angelica and he doesn't want to marry her since she has grown very old and plans instead to marry Mia. Lo Giusto transfers Mia to the suite Basile gave to Angelica when they were engaged and gives her beautiful dresses and shoes. At first Mia is flattered by this kindness, but before the ceremony she sees a hologram that shows the moment when Lo Giusto killed her father. Shattered, Mia escapes through the ducts chased by Lo Giusto's henchmen.  Primo is leading a group of policemen to arrest Lo Giusto, even though Lo Giusto has already cleaned up the hold of the ship after a tip and has threatened to kill him. Primo is not afraid to die, since he wants to restore Naples and save Mia from marrying him. Meanwhile, Angelica understands that Lo Giusto wants to marry Mia instead of her and asks her daughters to kill her before the ceremony.  When the stepsisters finally find Mia to try to kill her, they are ambushed by Lo Giusto's henchmen. At this point, a gunfight begins between Angelica's daughters and the henchmen and it ends with a massacre: all Angelica's daughters are killed and the last of Lo Giusto's henchman is shot dead by Angelica herself. Looking at the corpses of all her children, Angelica understands that all that happened was not Mia's fault, but her own, since she has betrayed Basile, the only man that really loved her, and then let Lo Giusto use her for his own purposes. Angelica decides to spare Mia and goes to the engine room to blow up the ship and everyone inside, but first she asks Mia to go inside her suite and free a blackbird that Basile gave her during their engagement and then leave the ship before the explosion. Angelica starts the countdown and, since she wants to die as well, sits on a balcony while she smokes a cigarette.  Primo manages to give the alarm, allowing everyone to leave the ''Megaride'' in time, while Lo Giusto tries to take Mia with him. The girl, knowing that she is standing in front of the man who killed her father, starts beating  Lo Giusto on his head and face and is stopped only when Primo arrives and tells her to run away. Primo and Mia manage to leave the ship just a second before the explosion, while Lo Giusto is left bleeding to die in one of the hallways.  
Coco (2017 film)
  In Santa Cecilia, [[Mexico]], Imelda is the wife of a musician who leaves her and their 4-year-old daughter Coco to pursue a career in music. When he never returns, Imelda banishes music from her family's life and starts a [[shoemaking]] business with her family.  Many years later, Imelda's great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, now lives with the now-elderly Coco and their family. Miguel secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation. One day, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame holding a photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ''[[ofrenda]]'' and removes the photograph, discovering that his great-great-grandfather (whose face had been torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.  Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel leaves to enter a talent show for the [[Day of the Dead]] despite his family's objections. He breaks into Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his [[Calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him there, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, as Miguel removed her photo from the ''ofrenda''. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing, but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits. Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.  Miguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played music with Ernesto. Héctor offers to help Miguel reach Ernesto; in return, he asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely. Upon learning he has other relatives, however, Héctor attempts to return Miguel to them. Miguel escapes and infiltrates Ernesto's mansion, learning along the way that an old friendship between the two deteriorated before Héctor's death. Ernesto welcomes Miguel as his descendant, but Héctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. An argument between Ernesto and Héctor, stemming from Héctor's decision to leave the duo and return to his family, causes Miguel to realize that Ernesto murdered Héctor by poisoning him and stole his songs, passing them off as his own to become famous.  To maintain his legacy, Ernesto steals the photo and has Miguel and Héctor thrown into a [[cenote]] pit, where Miguel realizes that Héctor is his real great-great-grandfather and that Coco is Héctor's daughter. The dead find and rescue the duo. Miguel reveals that Héctor's decision to return home to Imelda and Coco resulted in his death, and Imelda and Héctor gradually reconcile. They infiltrate Ernesto's sunrise concert to retrieve Héctor's photo from Ernesto, who attempts to kill Miguel to prevent him from returning with the photo. However, they secretly record Ernesto's admission to his misdeeds live to the concertgoers, who jeer Ernesto as he is propelled by the family [[alebrije]], Pepita, into a bell tower, where he is crushed.  As the sun rises, Héctor is in danger of being forgotten by Coco and disappearing. Imelda and Héctor bless Miguel unconditionally so he can return to the Land of the Living. Miguel plays "[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]," a song Héctor used to sing for Coco, revitalizing her memory of Héctor. She gives Miguel the torn-out piece of the photo from the ''ofrenda'', which shows Héctor's face, and tells her family stories about her father, thus keeping his memory alive. Miguel's family reconciles with him and accepts music again.  One year later, Miguel proudly presents the family ''ofrenda'' – including the restored photo of Héctor and Imelda, and a photo of the now-deceased Coco – to his new baby sister. Letters from Héctor saved by Coco contain evidence of Ernesto's crimes; thus, Ernesto's legacy is destroyed and Héctor is honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead, Héctor and Imelda join Coco for a visit to the living as Miguel sings and plays for his relatives, both living and dead.

The only other inhabitant of the island is the caretaker of the lighthouse, Gruner, who greets Friend quite coldly.

One day he discovers a lifeboat on the beach, inquiring to Gruner he discovers that it is the boat of a shipwrecked Portuguese individual who had been killed by the creatures. He also learns that the boat's cargo contained dynamite. Friend convinces Gruner to let him use an old dive suit to go down and get the dynamite from the ship. While down there he manages to recover the dynamite, but also sees what seem to be playful baby versions of creatures.  Friend and Gruner devise a plan to destroy the sea creatures, planning to lure many of them in close to the lighthouse by leaving the door open before setting off dynamite around it. The creatures duly make their attack, but Gruner fails to set off the first explosives causing Friend to have to run up to the top of the lighthouse and reconnect the detonator. The resulting blast kills a multitude of the creatures. Gruner then sets off the secondary explosives which are much closer to the lighthouse, knocking both Friend and himself unconscious. In the morning Gruner finishes off the wounded creatures, delighted at the results of their counter-attack, while Friend, upon seeing one of the dead creatures wearing a necklace, becomes somewhat less pleased. The immediate night, the creatures do not attack; instead making a mournful wailing sound for their dead.

Aji falls in love with Sarah ([[Karthika Muralidharan]]), an [[Americans|American]] citizen who came to Kerala for her studies. Later, he receives news from his comrade Hari ([[Dileesh Pothan]]) that her parents have taken her back to the [[U.S]]. Aji desperately wants to see her, even if they both can't get married. He finds out that there is no way that he can get a visa within the period of the marriage, so decides to [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegally enter to the US]] through [[Mexico]] as suggested by his cousin Cyril ([[Jinu Joseph]]), who is in America. Aji first goes to [[Nicaragua]], where a visa isn't needed. There, he meets Arul ([[John Vijay]]), a [[Sinhalese people|Sri Lankan]] taxi driver. Together, they decide to go to America. Then both travel to [[Reynosa]] in Mexico, where they find a guide to lead them across the borders safely. Aji meets others in their group, who are also trying to cross over illegally. He became friends with Pallavi ([[Chandini Sreedharan]]), a Malayalee in their group. The group is cheated by their guide who robs them and escapes after the first day. Instead of dropping the plan, Akai, a Chinese man among them, says that he has a GPS and can find the route to the US. Through the journey, they encounter an armed gang but they are defeated by the group with Aji's initiation for offence. Arul, after encountering an accident, decides to drop the plan and return to Nicaragua. As the journey continues, they are found by surveillance drones. Aji, along with Pallavi, Akai and Laden (a Pakistani immigrant) escape. The American police capture other illegal immigrants and are shown the dead body of Arul, asking if they know him.

Cook Up a Storm
 The story focuses on two young talented chefs, Sky Ko ([[Nicholas Tse]]), a southern-style Chinese chef, and Paul Ahn ([[Jung Yong-hwa]]), a Michelin-starred Korean chef trained in France. Both with reasons to climb the culinary ladder as top chefs. In the past, when Sky was ten years old, his father, Mountain Ko ([[Anthony_Wong_(Hong_Kong_actor)| Anthony Wong]]), left him behind with his friend, Uncle Seven ([[Ge You]]), master chef of Seven Restaurant. When asked why, Mountain told Sky that he has no talent as a cook and Mountain would only take him back if he can prove to be a great cook. In reality though, Mountain chose to pursue his culinary career over being a father and made the excuse that Sky can't even make a decent bowl of noodles right to make him a worthy son. Because of that, Sky spent the next twenty years to become a great chef under Uncle Seven's training. On the other side, Paul made a promise to his dying father that he would become a great cook. Through that journey, he became a highly successful chef in Europe and decided to run his own restaurant in Hong Kong, Stellar. However, this would bring conflicts to both Paul and Sky.  In an old area of Hong Kong, Sky is now an acclaimed chef at Seven. However, the Li Management Group arrived and started buying various properties of the old sector, including developing Stellar for Paul. The opening of Stellar proved to be a threat to Sky as these two chefs find themselves fighting for the best ingredients in the markets and maintaining their clientele. Stellar's fine haute cuisine represented a form of aggressive gentrification to the neighborhood and a threat to traditional Chinese cuisine. Their rivalry began with a challenge for the best fish and the culinary masters agreed to face each other in a culinary duel. Sky made a traditional salt-baked duck while Paul made a foie gras sorbet. While both tied in points, the judges gave victory to Paul as his dish presentation was superior to Sky's bland plating. Although the victory should've solidified Paul's abilities as a cook, things didn't go as expected.  Mayo is Paul's sous chef and girlfriend. It was while celebrating their victory that the manager of Li Group tells Paul he wants to replace him with Mayo, reasoning that a woman is far more appealing on media than a man. Betrayed and confused, Paul tried to defend his position as head chef, but Mayo exposed his dark secret: he can't taste everything. Paul has problems tasting certain flavors, especially saltiness. To compensate, he would utilize a notebook that contains all his recipes and have others test taste to compensate for his poor sense of taste. To make matters worse, the manager announces that he and Mayo are romantically involved. Mayo explained to Paul that she never loved him and only sided with him to surpass him. Now that she can take the title as executive chef of Stellar, she doesn't need Paul anymore. Angry that he has lost everything, Paul left.  It was while at an event stadium, Sky would bump into Paul drinking. Both shared their past and troubles and found mutual respect for each other. Both have a common goal of reaching to the culinary top and decided to team up. At Seven, the Li Group wants Uncle Seven to sign away his restaurant as the group is buying off the old sector to make it their own. Unrelenting to surrender, Uncle Seven refused. It was then Paul and Sky appeared, announcing their partnership. Paul reminded the manager that he was the winner of the competition, which makes him eligible to compete at the culinary championship, not the Li Group. Surprised by that technicality, the Li Group left, not before the manager called Paul a traitor. Sky would train Paul in the ways of Chinese cooking as well as developing Paul's limited palate to help create something new for the competition.  In Macau, at the Studio City Casino, attending the 7th International Culinary Competition, Sky and Paul use both their culinary strengths to compete against four other great chefs. Whoever wins the competition will gain the chance to face the current God of Cookery, Mountain Ko. In this competition, they have a French team, Indian team, a Japanese chef, and Mayo to face off. Mayo somehow still got into the competition and now uses her training against Paul. The French team made a roasted squab dish, the Indian team made a five-flavor curry, the Japanese chef made koi nigiri, Mayo made an oyster dish with frozen foam, and the duo made a deconstructed mapo tofu. Paul used Sky's sense of taste to help him determine the flavor of the ingredients they used to cook and Sky relied on Paul's knowledge of molecular science and culinary artistry to create a traditional dish with a modern design. The winner goes to Paul and Sky. Although Paul had limited tasting ability, his artistry and cooking imagination exceeds Mayo and she lost, visibly embarrassed.    The next round is to face Chef Ko. Paul pointed out only one chef can compete against Mountain and he realized Sky's desire to beat Mountain was a very personal one. Grateful he managed to make it this far with his condition, Paul gave Sky the chance to face his father. In the final competition, Sky finally faces his father and the judges allow the two to cook anything they wanted as long as it is considered the highest expression of cooking. While Mountain began cooking, Sky was at a stand, thinking about how Seven and the people in the neighborhood means the most to him. Mountain angrily splashed water at his son's face, demanding him to focus and show him something. Mountain created a beautiful artistic sugar display of molten lava with a single flower on top. Sky went for something far more personal, it was a personal interpretation of the original noodle dish that Mountain made all those years ago before abandoning Sky. Before the judges could even score the dish, Sky gave the bowl of noodles to Mountain and he was moved as he remembered what the noodles meant. Acknowledging his skills as a chef, Mountain called his son brilliant before Sky walked off the stage. Mountain would continue to emotionally eat his noodles, unclear of a victor.  Some time has passed and the people at Seven are getting ready for a [[Poon_choi| poon choi]] Chinese New Year party with the neighborhood's people. Much of the ending is left to personal interpretation, as the culinary championship, personal relations, and the fate of the neighborhood are left unresolved. The movie ends with the staff of Seven announcing: ''We wish you all 2017 a happy rooster year!''

Creep 2
  Dave ([[Karan Soni]]) receives a package at his home, opening it to find a stuffed wolf and DVD titled, "Watch Me," which shows unsettling shots of the inside of his house. Josef (now going by the name of Aaron) ([[Mark Duplass]]) knocks on the door. Dave greets him as a friend and they discuss the disturbing video. While Dave is in the kitchen, Aaron gestures and grins toward the stuffed wolf.   Aaron tells Dave that he greatly values their friendship, but then reveals that it was he who has been sending Dave the series of disturbing packages, and has put a camera inside the stuffed wolf. Dave grows increasingly wary as Aaron admits he is a serial killer but that he has been doubting his purpose, before slashing Dave's throat with a knife, and cradles him as he dies.  Sara ([[Desiree Akhavan]]) is a college student working as a videographer, in addition to working on her passion project: a [[YouTube]] series entitled "Encounters." In the show, Sara tapes strangers she meets through odd friendship requests on [[Craigslist]]. Frustrated with the series' low traffic, she plans to end the show with a finale. She finds a request from Aaron, who offers to pay $1,000 to a videographer willing to document him for an entire day.  Sara drives to his home, where Aaron invites her in to explain his proposition. Almost immediately, he reveals to Sara that he's a serial killer, and wishes for her to film a short documentary on his life and his 39 kills. He offers her 24-hour protection from being his next victim and a "window into his soul." Although nervous, Sara accepts. Aaron then shows Sara a video of his "favorite" murder (the ending of the original [[Creep (2014 film)|Creep]]) and his wolf mask. He strips nude in front of her to "tear down any barriers between them," which Sara does as well. Sara briefly locks herself in the bathroom to vlog about her uncertainties, but doubting that Aaron is truly a serial killer, decides to continue after hiding a knife in her boot.  Aaron then takes Sara into the nearby woods, but becomes angry that the river he scouted for the taping of his interview has dropped to the height of a small creek. After being further agitated, Aaron leaves to take a break; Sara finds him lying face down on the ground, growling.  Later, Sara reveals to the camera that Aaron has grown depressed since the failed shoot, shutting himself in his Jacuzzi room. Sara forces her way in. He opens up about his past, discussing his first violent experience at the age of 14, when he was picked up after a concert and taken into the woods by a man to dig his own grave. He recalls turning the tides on the man, strangling him to death and burying him, then lying next to the grave during the night in ecstasy. Sara comments on his tenseness and emotion, and massages his shoulders and face before going to take a shower. Aaron looks through her camera footage.  After trying to scare each other, the two play a game of hide-and-seek in the woods. Feeling content with his life to date, Aaron asks Sara to help him commit suicide to complete the documentary. Aaron dons the wolf mask and encourages Sara to cut off his head with his axe, but she refuses. He then jumps off his staircase wearing a noose, and Sara pulls him down.  Traumatized, Sara prepares to leave, but Aaron tells her it was a prank and thanks her for being his friend, convincing her to stay. Afterward, Sara suggests they play "Two Lies and a Truth," during which Aaron reveals himself to be a virgin after spending his teenage and young adult life in mental institutions and working in a elderly home. Sara gives him his first kiss. Aaron encourages her to stay the night and shoot the "real" finale, leading her into the woods once again. He gifts Sara a locket with pictures of himself and another man inside (from the original [[Creep (2014 film)|Creep]]).   He brings Sara to a grave he had dug earlier in the day. Aaron has stolen Sara's knife, but instead of attacking her, stabs himself in the gut multiple times and insists that she stab herself as well so they can die in the grave together. She tries to run. The wounded Aaron chases her with the camera. We hear Sara screaming off camera. He drags her to the grave and begins a monologue toward the camera, saying that he thought he would never kill again, but "no longer thinks he'll die tonight." While his back is turned, Sara crawls out the grave and grabs a nearby shovel, sneaks up behind Aaron, and clubs him in the head.  An undisclosed amount of time later, Sara is followed by an unknown figure videotaping her around New York City.

Crooked House (film)
 The granddaughter of late business tycoon Aristide Leonides, Sophia Leonides, visits private investigator Charles Hayward in his office. Sophia hires Charles to investigate Aristide's death, for she believes he was murdered by a member of his sprawling and idiosyncratic family. Sophia notes that Leonides' regular insulin injection had been laced with eserine from his eye drops, the resulting chemicals in them causing him to die. Sophia believes this to have been a deliberate switch rather than accidental. Charles begrudgingly agrees to take on the case as a result of his feelings for Sophia as the two had enjoyed a brief love affair when they had met sometime prior in Cairo. Charles seeks the consent of Chief Inspector Taverner of Scotland Yard to look into the case, utilising his personal connection with Taverner, who had served with Charles's father, a decorated former Assistant Commissioner who was murdered.  Charles visits the Leonides estate and proceeds to interview the various members of the family, finding various motives from each. Charles begins with Lady Edith De Haviland, the sister of Leonides's first wife, who despised her brother-in-law and his callous attitude towards her grandchildren. Leonides's eldest son, Philip, hated his father for passing him over to run the family business and for refusing to take interest in a new play he'd written for his wife, Magda, a fading theatre actress. Philip and Magda provided Leonides with three grandchildren, namely Sophia and the precocious younger children Eustace and Josephine. Eustace takes a dislike to Charles and seeks to hamper him where possible whilst Josephine makes clear to Charles that she eavesdrops on everyone around the house, makes notes about their private lives and dislikes most of her family except for Edith and Sophia.  Charles subsequently finds that Leonides' younger son, Roger, the emotionally immature managing director of the family's flagship business, was reliant upon his father bailing out the business numerous times due to his poor management. The fact that Leonides was so willing to bail Roger out did not sit well with either Roger, due to his pride, or his domineering wife Clemency. Charles further finds that Leonides' second wife, Brenda, a much younger former Las Vegas casino dancer, is suspected by the rest of the family as having committed the murder. Evidence seems to back this up due to the facts that Brenda had been having an affair with Laurence Brown, the private tutor for the Leonides children, as well as that she administered the fatal dose of drugs to Leonides and that she stood to inherit the entirety of the Leonides estate due to him not having signed a will, meaning he died intestate and thus his estate passed to her.  Charles's investigations and questions are met with hostility by most of the family whilst Josephine cryptically hints at clues along the way, to Charles's irritation, as he finds her treating the investigation as a game to be tiresome. Events take a new, horrific turn when the ladder to Josephine's treehouse is sabotaged and she falls from the tree, being hospitalised as a result. Charles suspects that this was due to Josephine's habit of spying on the other family members and the killer thus wanting to silence her. In the aftermath, Charles's suspicions are heightened and even extend to Sophia after a new will is discovered in which Leonides had left his estate to her, with some arguing that Sophia hired Charles to investigate the murder due to their personal history, knowing he would never accuse her due to their romantic past.  After those developments, Taverner arrives in person to take charge of the case as he feels Charles' romantic history with Sophia does not make him objective enough to solve it. The discovery of love letters between Brenda and Laurence gives Taverner enough evidence to arrest them for Leonides' murder and the attempt on Josephine, to the delight of most of his family members who had always hated both. Charles, however, remains unconvinced that Brenda and Laurence are guilty, noting Brenda's childlike intelligence and Laurence's pacifist, left-wing views as making them unlikely candidates for being a murderer. Sophia and Edith seem to agree, with Sophia noting how the letters could have been forged and Edith paying for a top rate lawyer to represent Brenda and Laurence in court. In the meantime, however, Charles returns to London and only returns to the estate when Josephine's nanny dies after being poisoned by drinking a mug of hot chocolate that she had made for Josephine.  Charles implores Josephine to tell her who the killer is as he has worked out she knows their identity. Again, Josephine refuses to tell. After it is established that the nanny died of cyanide poisoning, Charles begins to suspect Edith as he knew she had been using cyanide to remove moles in the estate garden. His search of Edith's garden shed finds a bottle of cyanide as well as Josephine's missing notebook, complete with her notes on each member of the family. Edith drives out of the family estate with Josephine, having also left a note for Charles to find. Charles and Sophia take off in pursuit of Edith in a car chase to try and stop them. In the car, Sophia reads the note that Edith had left in which she confesses to the murder but Charles argues that he believes Edith is not the killer.  Sophia reads extracts from Josephine's notebook in which the child admits to murdering Leonides purely because he had refused to pay for her ballet lessons. The notebook further reveals that Josephine had also faked the attack on herself and had poisoned her nanny when the latter began to suspect Josephine. Lady Edith had worked out that Josephine was the killer and planted evidence and wrote the confession note to spare Josephine a life in psychiatric institutions and exonerate Brenda and Laurence. Edith had earlier been informed that she was dying of cancer and so decided to sacrifice herself to protect Josephine and the rest of the family. Edith realises that Charles and Sophia are pursuing her and so she drives her car over the clifftop of a quarry, killing herself and Josephine. The film ends as Charles comforts a shocked Sophia at the edge of the cliff.  
Cult of Chucky
 Four years after the events of ''[[Curse of Chucky]]'', an adult [[Andy Barclay]] still has the original Chucky's head, which is conscious and deformed after being repeatedly tortured by Andy in retribution for his crimes. Meanwhile, [[Nica Pierce]] has spent the past four years in a mental institution after being framed by Chucky for the murders of her family. After therapy, she now believes she was responsible for the murders and that Chucky was a manifestation of her psychosis. Her doctor, Dr. Foley, has her transferred to the medium-security Harrogate Psychiatric Hospital.  In [[group therapy]], Nica meets Malcolm, a man with [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple-identity disorder]]; Angela, an old woman who believes she is dead; Claire, a woman who burned her house down; and Madeleine, a patient who smothered her infant son to death. Dr. Foley introduces a technique involving a Good Guy doll. Most of the patients are unsettled by the doll except for Madeleine, who treats it as her baby.  Nica, visited by [[Tiffany Ray|Tiffany Valentine]], legal guardian of her niece Alice, is devastated when Tiffany informs her Alice has died. Tiffany leaves Nica a Good Guy doll, which she claims was a gift from Alice. That night, Chucky awakens and discovers Nica has attempted suicide. The next morning, Nica finds that her wrists have been stitched up, with a message stating "not so fast". She discovers Angela has died, leaving the message "Chucky did it." After realizing that Valentine was the last name of Charles Lee Ray's girlfriend, Nica begins to believe Chucky is real. Fearing Madeleine is in danger, Nica has Malcolm try to warn her. However, Madeline throws both the doll and Malcolm into an empty grave. The orderlies rescue Malcolm. Chucky kills Claire next. Andy learns about the murders online and realizes Chucky has somehow managed to transfer his soul into multiple bodies at once.  In a private session with Foley, Nica agrees to be hypnotized in order to access any repressed memories about her involvement in the murders. Foley, who has been sexually abusing Nica, is hit from behind by Chucky. Foley believes Nica is the one who assaulted him but is willing to keep quiet in order to blackmail her for sexual favors. Madeleine smothers her Good Guy doll with a pillow, forcing her to confront the repercussions of her real child's death. Orderlies bury the doll in order to placate Madeleine.  Andy, planning to end the carnage and save Nica, gets committed to the institution by assaulting one of the security guards. Foley receives a package from Carlos: another Good Guy doll. Madeleine is visited by her own doll, which has risen from the grave, and she allows the doll to kill her so she can finally be with her baby. Foley attempts to assault Nica but is knocked out by one of the Chucky dolls. The Chucky doll awakens the doll Andy had sent. The three Chuckys reveal that the original Chucky found a voodoo spell on the Internet, which allowed him to separate his soul into multiple host bodies. Alice was one host, but she was killed. All the dolls then kill Carlos in front of Nica.  Tiffany returns, killing a security guard. One of the Chuckys transfers his soul into Nica, giving her body the ability to walk again. He then stomps on Foley, killing him and stumbles upon Malcolm, who is killed by Madeleine's Chucky. A short-haired Chucky attacks Andy, but Andy reaches into the doll’s chest and pulls out a gun he had planted there. He shoots the doll before stomping its head, killing him. He then shoots at Nica Chucky only to discover that he has no ammo left. The institution is sent into lockdown, resulting in Andy being locked inside his cell, Madeleine's Chucky going into hiding, and Nica Chucky escaping. Nica Chucky reunites with Tiffany before driving off together with the Tiffany doll, which is revealed to be alive as well.  In a post-credits scene, Andy's former foster sister [[Kyle (Child's Play)|Kyle]] from [[Child's Play 2|the second film]] enters Andy's house, having been sent by Andy to continue torturing the original Chucky's severed head.  
The Crucifixion (film)
 In Bucharest, 2004 Father Dumitru and several nuns perform a violent exorcism on Sister Adelina Marinescu, who is believed to be possessed by the demon Agares. Dumitru and four nuns are arrested for murder when the three-day ordeal culminates in the death of Adelina.  New York journalist Nicole Rawlins convinces her editor to let her investigate the case. He cautions Nicole to not allow her personal views on faith or the death of her mother to affect her objectivity.  Nicole begins by interviewing Father Dumitru in jail. Dumitru claims he could have saved Adelina, and she only died because Bishop Gornick interfered with the unauthorized rite’s completion.   At Adelina’s funeral, Nicole meets Adelina’s close friend Sister Vaduva, who insists the young nun wasn’t murdered. Nicole follows a secret passage into the underground chamber where the exorcism was performed, and takes pictures of the cross where Adelina died before Bishop Gornick throws her out.  She then meets local priest Father Anton, who identifies Sister Vaduva as well as Adelina’s brother Stefan Marinescu, whom Vaduva lives with on a nearby farm. Anton directs Nicole to speak directly to Bishop Gornick at St. Joseph’s Cathedral.  Bishop Gornick tells Nicole that Adelina was mentally ill, not possessed, then goes on to infer that Father Dumitru was a rogue priest who overzealously performed an inordinate amount of exorcisms. She then has a strange encounter with mute gypsy boy Tavian Amanar outside.  Nicole returns to Father Anton. Anton theorizes that the demon allowed Adelina to die because it no longer needed her and could transfer its evil into someone else for another possession.  Nicole begins having terrible nightmares as well as waking visions involving strange activity. Vaduva again tells Nicole that the demon killed Adelina. Vaduva recounts how the seeming suicide of Father Gabrielle, a close mentor who unexpectedly threw himself from the monastery’s bell tower, triggered Adelina’s transformation.  Over dinner with Father Anton, Nicole confides in him how she lost her faith when her terminally ill mother died following a decision to abandon medical treatment for trust in God. Anton warns that Nicole is an easy target for the demon.  Nicole has another odd encounter with Tavian on her way back to the hotel. Following a sexual fantasy involving Father Anton, Nicole wakes to a frightening vision of Adelina.  Another visit with Vaduva reveals that Adelina fell in love with a man who led her away from the church, but the relationship ended unexpectedly. Adelina’s plea for God’s forgiveness seemingly invited The Devil instead. Vaduva describes what Adelina’s exorcism was like.  Father Anton brings a bottle of wine to Nicole at her hotel as an apology for how he left things the night before. They drink together and Nicole dreams of sex with Anton once again, but the priest leaves without incident when Nicole falls asleep after drinking one glass.  Nicole interviews Dr. Funar, who diagnosed Adelina as a schizophrenic. Dr. Funar recalls a demonic vision Adelina had during her diagnosis. While driving, Nicole notices rays of sunlight, which her mother once said were signs from God, seemingly directing her to a cemetery. Nicole finds Father Gabrielle’s grave, and learns he died on the same day as her mother.  Connecting that the demon possessed Adelina after it killed Father Gabrielle, Nicole rushes to the monastery. Gabrielle’s records show that his last appointment was with Tavian Amanar.  Presuming that Father Gabrielle performed an exorcism on Tavian, Nicole goes to see the boy’s father. Mr. Amanar reveals that Tavian actually retrieved Gabrielle to exorcise his father, as Mr. Amanar was hearing voices telling him to kill Tavian. Nicole is suddenly possessed by Agares and Father Anton races to the farmhouse to find Nicole violently possessed and levitating. While Tavian and Mr. Amanar hold her down, Anton performs an exorcism, pleading for Nicole to renew her faith. Nicole has a vision of her mother as the demon is ultimately expelled from her body.  Nicole returns to New York. Father Dumitru and the nuns serve seven years in prison for Sister Adelina’s murder.

Daddy's Home 2
 After finally becoming friends at the end of the first film, Brad Whittaker and Dusty Mayron have a co-dad system where their two children, Megan and Dylan, take turns at each father's house. Dusty has also remarried, this time to Karen, a writer, and is stepdad to Adrianna, Karen's daughter.  Brad and his wife, Sara, along with Dusty and Karen, attend a school play for Megan, where she announces to the whole audience that she doesn't like the fact that she has to go back and forth to different houses all the time. Back at the house, after the play, Brad and Dusty decide to do away with having two separate Christmases and instead do one "together Christmas". Dusty, however, finds out his tough fighter pilot/astronaut father Kurt ([[Mel Gibson]]) is coming for Christmas.  At the airport the next day, Dusty tells Brad that his father is going to make fun of them since he won't understand their co-dad arrangement. When Kurt arrives, he mistakes Brad for a chauffeur. When Dusty explains that Brad is the stepdad to his children, Kurt doesn't like it. Brad's overbearing and over-cheerful dad, Don ([[John Lithgow]]), arrives next, unnerving Kurt. Don tells Brad that his mother didn't come along, because she is taking care of Brad's Uncle who isn't feeling well.  Back at the house, Megan and Dylan warmly embrace Don, since he is very present in their lives, while Kurt hasn't seen the children since they were toddlers. Through jealousy of the affection the children show to Don, Kurt rents a large cabin through Airbnb, to house all of them through the holiday week. As Brad and Dusty pack the bags into the car, Dusty tells Brad that Kurt thinks the two men are harboring bad feelings for each other, but are just hiding it from everyone by pretending to be friends. When Kurt walks to the car, they change the subject.  Throughout the week, Brad and Dusty's co-dad relationship is put to the test by Kurt's meddling. It is revealed that Kurt has never really had a good father-son relationship with Dusty either. Dusty gets angry, and Brad tells him to set a good example for his children, and the only person who could ruin the vacation for him was himself. Meanwhile, Dusty tries to get close to his stepdaughter, Adrianna, but she doesn't like him and repeatedly tells him that he isn't her father. Sara also tries to bond with Karen but is taken aback by some of Karen's actions, like shoplifting clothes from a store. Dylan develops a crush on a little girl staying in the cabin next door. Brad gives him some “advice”, but it only makes Dylan more afraid. He gets made fun of by Megan and Adrianna. Finding the trees too small in a farm, they illegally go on to private property to cut one down. Brad mistakes a cell tower for a tree, and is electrocuted. The men come home with a $20,000 tree.  The next day, the entire family goes bowling, and Dylan throws a fit after his ball keeps getting stuck in the gutter. Grandpa Kurt motivates him, and the entire bowling alley cheers as Dylan knocks down a single pin. After bowling, the family goes out to take the kids to see Santa. While there, Kurt convinces Dylan to ask Santa for a shotgun, which he agrees to. Don tells Dylan that a shotgun for hunting means that a poor innocent animal will lose its life. This convinces Dylan to change his mind, but when it is Megan's turn to ask for something, she decides she wants to go hunting after hearing Grandpa Kurt saying that women can’t shoot. While out hunting the next day, Megan accidentally shoots Kurt in the shoulder, sending him to the hospital. While Kurt is disabled, she manages to shoot two turkeys, to Kurt’s surprise. When the day ends, Brad is outside clearing snow. Sara comes outside and asks about Don’s relationship with Brad's mom. Brad is confused and tells her they love each other more than his dad loves him. While he is talking to Sara, his snow plow reels in Christmas lights, which drop onto Dusty’s car.  At the hospital, Dusty and Kurt begin to bond after they almost get into a fight when Kurt tries to leave the hospital. That night, Brad, Dusty, Don and Kurt go to an improv comedy club, where the four men are relaxing and having a good time watching the show. Kurt gets up to go get another drink at the bar. Dusty sees Kurt picking up a woman at the bar and leaving with her. Brad enters Don into the improv show, and Dusty chooses a topic of a husband confronting his cheating wife as the subject of an improv skit. As the skit progresses, it is revealed that Don has separated from his wife in real life. The audience believes that this is all part of the show, even when Brad tries to tell the audience that it is not.  The next day, Brad confronts Dusty. Dusty reveals that he chose the infidelity subject for the improv game because he wanted to get back at Brad, because of how Brad has a good relationship with Don. Inside Sara comforts Don about his divorce in front of an eggnog bowl. When they leave, Megan and Adrianna take cups of alcoholic eggnog to drink. Brad says he knows that is why Dusty chose that particular topic, and to get back at Dusty Brad has invited Adrianna's real dad, Roger, to the cabin for Christmas.  That evening, the entire family takes part in a Christmas manger representation. Brad gets into a fight with Dusty because he wants to play Joseph, which Dusty is currently playing. When Megan begins to swear, and Adrianna falls from being drunk the crowd breaks up. Instead of Dusty fighting Brad, he almost comes to blows with Roger.  The next morning, Christmas Day, the families all pack up to leave. On their way out of town, the families are forced back to town on account of a blizzard. They are forced to take shelter at a movie theater. With every other movie being sold out, due to the huge influx of business from other families seeking shelter at the theater, both families go to see the last movie available: ''Missile Tow'', a fictional holiday action comedy film starring [[Liam Neeson]].  When the power cuts off during the movie, the families go to the lobby where each man confronts their father about the secrets, lies, and attitudes. Brad confronts Don about not telling him the truth about his divorce, while Dusty tries to talk to Kurt. When Dylan sees the girl he has a crush on is also there at the theater, he is teased again by Megan and Adrianna. After remembering some advice given to him by Kurt, Dylan walks toward her to kiss her. All of a sudden, he doesn't kiss her, but instead kisses Adrianna. Roger gets freaked out and attempts to leave with Adrianna, but is confronted by Dusty. He deduces that the reason why Adrianna hasn't warmed up to him is that he has never told her that he loves her, which he does. He also tells Roger that loving Adrianna means loving her real father as well since he is also part of the family. Roger almost leaves without Adrianna, but has a change of heart after everyone breaks out into a song of "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" and decides to stay. Don and Brad also reconcile.  Sometime later, at the airport, Don and Kurt are preparing to leave to head back to their respective homes. Kurt heads with Don up the terminal escalators, where he reveals to Don that he switched out the tickets and they're going to spend New Years in Las Vegas.  As Brad's mom's flight arrives, Dusty and Brad discover that Brad's new stepdad is [[Chesley Sullenberger|Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger]], the pilot of the "[[US Airways Flight 1549|Miracle on the Hudson" flight]]. Brad and Dusty remember that they watched the film "Sully" together not too long ago, and Brad appears to be welcoming towards him. Brad runs down the terminal and says that Sully will never replace his father, because Sully has only one great personal story, whereas his father has thousands of stories.

Daddy You, Daughter Me
 The story of a father and daughter whose souls are magically switched for eight days.  
The Cured
 It is revealed in caption that a plague, called the Maze Virus, has previously swept through Europe, transforming its victims into a homicidal, zombie like state. Ireland was particularly ravaged by this virus, with much of the country evacuated or left in economic shambles. A cure was later discovered, and 75% of those infected who could be captured have been treated and cured of the virus. The remaining 25% have proven resistant to the cure. The two groups are defined categorically as the Cured and the Resistant. The disease began five years earlier, and some of the Cured were in a feral state for nearly that long while Ireland was in a long-term national emergency. Many people in the general populace fear that keeping the Resistant alive could easily lead to another outbreak, and there is a considerable amount of civil unrest by the Irish citizenry.  Senan, a young Irish man of about 25, is introduced as a Cured patient who is soon to be released to his sister-in-law's care. Senan is rather passive, whereas his Cured friend, Conor, appears quite remorseless and blames society for their situation. Conor appears to have considerable, unspoken influence over Senan. Senan meets his 'Rehabilitation Officer', Sergeant Cantor, who clearly has little faith that the Cured can integrate back into society without further violence. Cantor acts like a parole officer and shows little compassion for Senan.  Senan reunites with his sister-in-law, Abbie, who has a toddler son, Cillian. Cillian quickly begins to bond with his uncle. Abbie soon inquires to Senan as to what became of her husband, Luke, Senan's brother who is still amongst the missing. Senan claims ignorance of his fate, though it is revealed in one of Senan's many flashbacks that Conor infected Senan, who then killed his brother Luke, in the very apartment that Abbie lives in. The Cured have a detailed memory of what they have done while infected; many of them suffer from [[post-traumatic stress]].   Conor, formerly a young lawyer with political aspirations, approaches his father seeking a job with a law firm. His father, also a lawyer, accuses Conor of killing Conor's mother and other atrocities while infected. Sergeant Cantor later confronts Conor and Senan and forcefully tells Conor to have no further contact with his family. Conor begins to form an underground political faction called the Cured Alliance, whose goal is ostensibly to regain many of the civil liberties that the Cured have lost. It is announced in various news broadcasts that the government is planning to euthanize the 25% (5000 patients) who are Resistant, despite the assertions of a prominent virologist that a better vaccine for the Resistant is nearly developed. Senan takes a job at the hospital where the Resistant are housed, and observes that the Resistant show no interest in attacking the Cured. This is a source of political tension in the community, as the never-infected suspect aloud that the Cured would love to see another outbreak of the Maze Virus, as they would be largely immune to its effects.  Conor attempts to recruit Senan into the Cured Alliance, but Senan initially appears uninterested, wanting only to settle into family life and forget the past. However, the public at large have become hostile towards the Cured living in their midst, and eventually Senan agrees to go on an arson mission with Conor to gain some political leverage. The mission was intended to be free of casualties, but a military man is killed and Cantor suspects Senan and Conor. Cantor approaches Abbie at her apartment and educates her on the nature of the people infected with the Maze Virus. He tells her that the infected are linked in some telepathic manner, and that they form into packs like predatory animals. He voices his suspicions that the predatory traits are not eliminated by the vaccine, and that the Cured are still very dangerous. When Abbie shows skepticism, Cantor shows her a photograph of Conor and Senan roaming together when they were infected. Conor appeared to be leading Senan in murderous acts in the photo. Conor later approaches Abbie, and tacitly admits that he and Senan killed her husband while they were infected during the early days of the outbreak. Conor shows her a ghastly scar on his shoulder and tells her that her husband, Luke, did indeed try to fight back but was overcome by himself and Senan.  Abbie confronts Senan, and he tearfully admits that he killed Luke after Conor infected him. She tells him to get out, and Senan finally realizes that Conor has no remorse for what he has done in the past, and what he is still doing. Senan assists Cantor in a sting operation to arrest Conor after he confesses aloud to the arson; however, Conor violently murders Cantor and flees after showing a rare emotional outburst, blaming Senan for betraying him. Conor asserts that Senan is a fool for believing that anyone other than other Cured people care anything about him now. Conor and the Cured Alliance set in motion a drastic plan to free the Resistant from their cellblock. The Resistant are freed from their captivity and they take to the streets, killing and infecting new victims and causing mass chaos. Soldiers take to the streets in an attempt to quell the emergency. Senan finds Abbie, who is frantically trying to retrieve Cillian from his school. Senan rescues Cillian but is confronted by Conor, who beats him savagely. A soldier shoots Conor but he escapes and his fate is unknown. Senan, Abbie and Cillian return to their apartment, but Cillian is bit by an infected and begins showing immediate signs of infection. Senan, knowing he is immune, takes Cillian, and tells Abbie he will keep him safe until another vaccine is available.  An unspecified time later, a news broadcast announces that order has again returned, although 8000 new infected people are now in captivity. It is publicized that some infected are now in hiding, as the government is again discussing euthanasia for the inevitable 25% who are Resistant.  Watching the broadcast, Abbie bursts into tears, knowing that Senan is hiding somewhere with the infected Cillian, and that the government cannot be trusted but that the only hope for her son is another government vaccine.

The Dark Tower (2017 film)
  Eleven-year-old Jake Chambers experiences visions involving a Man in Black who seeks to destroy a Tower and bring ruin to the Universe, and a Gunslinger who opposes him. Jake's mother, stepfather, and psychiatrists dismiss these as dreams resulting from the trauma of his father’s death the previous year.  At his apartment home in [[New York City]], a group of workers from an alleged [[psychiatric facility]] offer to rehabilitate Jake; recognizing them from his visions as monsters wearing human skin, he flees. Jake tracks down an abandoned house from one of his visions, discovers a [[Portals in fiction|high-tech portal]], and travels to a post-apocalyptic world called [[Mid-World]].  In Mid-World, Jake encounters the last Gunslinger, [[Roland Deschain]] who emerged in his visions. Roland is pursuing [[Randall Flagg|Walter Padick, the Man in Black]] who had also appeared in Jake’s dreams, across a desert, seeking to kill him in revenge for the murder of his father, Steven, and all remaining gunslingers. He explains that Walter, over the decades, has been abducting psychic children, and is attempting to use their "shine" to bring down the Dark Tower, a fabled structure located at the center of the Universe; this will allow [[Crimson King|being]]s from the darkness outside to invade and destroy reality.   Roland takes Jake to a village to have his visions interpreted by a seer. Learning of Jake's escape and journey to Mid-World, Walter investigates and discovers from his minion Sayre that Jake has "[[The Shining (novel)|pure Shine]]", i.e. enough psychic potential to destroy the Tower single-handedly. He kills Jake's stepfather, then interrogates his mother about his visions and kills her too. In Mid-World, the seer determines that the machine is six months away on foot and portal access is restricted to Walter's bases. Jake realizes that Walter has a base in New York that they can use to reach the machine. Walter's minions, the Taheen, attack the village, but Roland individually kills each of them. Roland and Jake return to Earth where Jake gets Roland's injuries treated at a hospital and learns the location of Walter's base from a homeless man that had earlier helped him. When Jake returns home to check in on his mother, he finds her charred remains and breaks down. Roland vows to kill Walter "for both of us" and comforts Jake by teaching him the Gunslinger's Creed, which he hasn't uttered since his own father’s death, as well as the basics of gun fighting.  As Roland re-arms himself at a gun store, he is attacked by Walter, who captures Jake and takes him through a portal at his base to a machine that will use Jake to destroy the Tower. Jake uses his psychic powers to alert Roland to the portal code he needs, and Roland battles his way through Walter's henchmen and reopens the portal which Jake forces to stay open. Walter is forced to return to New York to fight Roland and wounds him. After Jake reminds him of the Gunslinger’s Creed, Roland recovers and kills Walter with a trick shot after a brief fight. Roland destroys the machine, saving the Tower, Jake, and the other children.  Afterwards, Roland says that he must return to his own world and offers Jake a place by his side as his companion. Jake accepts the offer as he has nowhere else to go, and the two depart for Mid-World.

[[King George VI]], who strongly distrusts Churchill, reluctantly invites him to [[Churchill war ministry|form a government]]. Churchill includes Chamberlain and Halifax.

That evening, Light is compelled to write down the name of Antony Skomal, the man who killed his mother in a [[hit and run]]. Skomal dies in a similar freak accident at a restaurant. Ryuk explains other rules of the Death Note, including the ability to control the actions of the victim for up to 48 hours after their name is written before they die. Classmate Mia Sutton asks Light about the Death Note, and he demonstrates how it works. She encourages Light to use the Death Note with her to rid the world of criminals, improving the world. They decide to work together under the guise of a god they call "Kira", using the book's coercion powers to have their victims reveal this name to the world.  Kira becomes beloved by the public, as its killings are seen as righteous by the majority of law enforcement, and Light and Mia become lovers. Kira's actions draw the attention of "[[L (Death Note)|L]]", an enigmatic FBI investigator, who is able to track down Kira's location to Seattle and his source to the city's police database.

L gives a televised speech with his face concealed, taunting Kira to kill him, and when this fails to happen, L suspects that Kira must know a person's name and face to kill.  L has FBI agents follow Light and other suspects. Mia suggests killing the agents, but Light refuses. The FBI agents thereafter commit mass [[suicide]] and Light accuses Ryuk of killing them. James appears on television and vows to apprehend Kira. Mia urges Light to kill him for the greater good, but Light can't bring himself to do it. When James is not killed, L comes to the conclusion that Light must be Kira. L confronts Light, revealing his face to him. Realizing that L is closing in on him and with Mia motivating him, Light uses the Death Note to force Watari to uncover L's real name. As Ryuk explains, Light can burn the page with Watari's name on it within the 48 hours to cancel his impending death; however, this method can only be used to save a victim of the Death Note once. Watari leaves suddenly for the abandoned New York orphanage where he found L years before; L learns Watari has disappeared and orders Light's house to be searched; he finds nothing, as Mia was able to sneak the Death Note out.  Knowing that Light is still being followed, Mia helps him to sneak away at the school dance, allowing him to collect the Death Note and contact Watari via phone. Watari finds L's records moments before the 48-hour deadline, but Light finds Watari's page missing. Watari is then shot and killed by unknown soldiers before he can reveal L's name. Mia reveals that she used the Death Note to kill the FBI agents in order to protect herself and Light, took Watari's page, and has also written Light's name in the book, giving him until midnight before his heart stops. She offers to burn Light's page if he gives the Death Note to her, as she believes he is not capable of making the right decisions for the good of society. Meanwhile, L is devastated by Watari's death and goes on his own manhunt for Light.  Light tells Mia to meet him at the [[Seattle Great Wheel]] where he will turn over the book, and then flees from police, who are closing in on him. L catches up to him and prepares to kill him, but a passerby knocks L out after overhearing that Light is Kira. Pursued by police, Light meets Mia and takes her to the top of the ferris wheel. Light tries to convince Mia that they will be happier without the Death Note, at first seemingly dissuaded, Mia takes the Death Note when Light turns to look out, much to Light's intense dismay. Confused at first, she realised that Light must have written her name in the book, with her death contingent on her taking the Death Note from him. With both of them doomed, Ryuk causes the Ferris wheel to collapse. Mia falls to her death, while Light and the Death Note fall into the water. The page with Light's name on it drifts into a [[burn barrel]], an event witnessed by L. Though Light is rescued from the water, he has fallen into a coma.  Two days later, a man leaves the Death Note at Light's bedside. When Light wakes up, he finds his father there, who tells him he knows that Light is Kira. James explains that he found a news clipping about Skomal's death in Light's room and realized that he was Kira's first victim. Light explains that he used the Death Note at the school to plan out Mia's death in a way that would ensure his own page got burned if she took the Death Note. He also manipulated several criminals to induce him into a medical coma, having them use the Death Note during his comatose absence to give himself an alibi. With Kira continuing to kill while Light was in a coma, L is taken off the case and forced to return to Japan. As his plane is about to take off, he ponders a comment Light made during their standoff, realizing Mia's involvement, he stops the plane and races to her home to search her possessions. He finds the Death Note page with the names of the FBI agents she killed on it, and in a [[insanity|hysterical fit]], contemplates writing a name on the page. Back in Light's hospital room, Ryuk appears, laughing. When Light asks him why he's laughing, he simply comments "You humans are so interesting".  
The Death of Stalin
 Pianist [[Maria Yudina]] hides a note in a recording for [[Joseph Stalin]], saying he has ruined the country. As Stalin reads it in his [[dacha]], he is paralysed by a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]]. The members of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] are alerted. The first to arrive are Interior Ministry ([[NKVD]]) head [[Lavrentiy Beria]], who discovers Maria's note, and [[Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union|Deputy General Secretary]] [[Georgy Malenkov]]. As Malenkov panics, Beria guides him to take leadership, hoping to use him as a puppet.  Moscow Party Head [[Nikita Khrushchev]] arrives with the rest of the Committee, except for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minister]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], whom Stalin added to one of his [[Stalin's shooting lists|lists of enemies]] the night previously. Beria closes off Moscow, has the NKVD take over city security duties from the [[Red Army]], and replaces Stalin's enemy lists with his own, reprieving Molotov. Khrushchev and Beria struggle for symbolic victories such as control over Stalin's unstable son [[Vasily Stalin|Vasily]] and daughter [[Svetlana Alliluyeva|Svetlana]].  When Stalin dies, the Committee members rush back to Moscow as the NKVD loot Stalin's dacha and execute witnesses. Khrushchev goes to Molotov's home and attempts to enlist his support, but Molotov, a true believer in [[Stalinism]], opposes any factionalism within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]]. Beria buys his loyalty by releasing his wife [[Polina Zhemchuzhina|Polina Molotova]] from confinement.  Malenkov is named as nominal [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] while being largely controlled by Beria. At the first Committee meeting following Stalin's death, Beria sidelines Khrushchev by putting him in charge of Stalin's funeral and suggesting many of the liberal reforms which Khrushchev had planned. Stalin's body is [[Lying in state|laid in state]] in the [[House of the Unions|Hall of Columns]], while many political prisoners are released and restrictions on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] are loosened, earning Beria more popular support. [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Field Marshal]] [[Georgy Zhukov]] arrives and demands to know why the Red Army troops have been confined to barracks within Moscow.  Beria learns that Khrushchev has a passing acquaintance with Maria, who was hired to play at the funeral, and threatens them both with the note. Khrushchev approaches Zhukov, who agrees to provide the Army's support in a coup to overthrow Beria, but only if the Committee agrees.  To undermine Beria's popularity, Khrushchev orders the trains into Moscow to resume, allowing thousands of mourners into the city. As he planned, the NKVD guards around the Hall fire on the crowd, killing 1,500 people. The Committee suggests scapegoating low-level NKVD officers; as Beria believes blame attached to security services will tarnish him, he angrily threatens the Committee with incriminating documents he has collected on them. Molotov secretly tells Khrushchev and Kaganovich he will support the coup if they can enlist the support of the others, including Malenkov.  On the day of [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|Stalin's funeral]], Khrushchev lies to the Committee and Zhukov that he has Malenkov's support. The Red Army overwhelms the NKVD and takes up positions outside the conference room. Zhukov and his men arrest Beria, and Khrushchev coerces Malenkov into signing the papers for Beria's trial. Khrushchev and his allies find Beria guilty of treason and of sexual assault in a [[kangaroo court]] and execute him. As Beria's body is burnt, Khrushchev gives Svetlana a ticket to Vienna and assures her that her brother will be cared for. Several years later, Khrushchev, now Supreme Leader of the Soviet Union after removing his co-conspirators, attends a concert given by Maria, while future leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], only a row above, watches him.

Death Race 2050
 The year is 2050. In the United Corporations of America, which is plagued by overpopulation and an unemployment rate of 99.993%, the Death Race provides both entertainment and population control. Spanning from Old New York to New Los Angeles, the current Death Race features reigning champion [[Frankenstein (Death Race)|Frankenstein]], genetically engineered athlete Jed Perfectus, hip hop sensation Minerva Jefferson, female cultist Tammy the Terrorist and the [[Autonomous car|self-driving car]] ABE. Each driver is assigned a proxy, a broadcaster who allows the audience to experience the race through [[virtual reality]]. Frankenstein is immediately put off by his proxy Annie Sullivan and ignores her attempts to interview him and her suggestions to let his opponents pass him.   As the drivers race through the East Coast, rebels led by former network producer Alexis Hamilton set traps throughout the sector. Tammy and Minerva form a fierce rivalry when they steal each other's cult followers for kills. After running into a rebel trap, ABE malfunctions, kills its proxy, and abandons the race to discover its purpose. At the first checkpoint, Hamilton orders Annie, who is revealed to be her spy, to kill Frankenstein. Her attempt to seduce him fails, as he cares for nothing but winning the race. Elsewhere, the Chairman explains that Frankenstein has become a liability due to his longevity, whereas Perfectus will encourage his devoted fans to die at his hand. On day two of the race, the drivers pass through the heartland of the country, known for its gun-wielding citizens. Minerva's proxy Chi Wapp is killed by a suicide bomber sent by Tammy. Frankenstein takes a shortcut on another tip, but his car gets stuck in a cornfield. As Annie wanders off, Frankenstein fends off against a group of resistance ninjas to score more points. Upon reaching the next checkpoint, Annie admits to being a rebel and attempts to recruit Frankenstein. Politically apathetic, Frankenstein curses both the rebels and the government, reiterating his desire only to win the race. At a bar, Minerva reveals to Annie that she is an educated intellectual who plays a stereotypical hip hop character to survive. Coming back to Frankenstein's room, Annie saves his life from Perfectus, who is jealous of Frankenstein's popularity and sex appeal. Meanwhile, it is discovered that Hamilton and the Chairman are working together behind the scenes.  On day three of the race, the government sets "approved" routes for the drivers to avoid resistance attacks. Annie helps Frankenstein shift gears due to his right arm being damaged in his fight with Perfectus. Minerva chases Tammy, but she falls off a cliff to avoid Tammy's suicidal proxy. Tammy gloats at Minerva's death before a returning ABE rams her against the wall and self-destructs. Frankenstein and Annie wipe out Hamilton and her rebels while Perfectus takes a secret route toward the finish line.

Dear Maya
 The film opens into the lives of teenage girls Ana and Ira, students at a convent (Catholic) school in Shimla. They are particularly close and divide their daytime between school and romance novels and boys and, occasionally, sleepovers. They are very intrigued by their reclusive middle-aged neighbor Maya Devi who lives alone in a large house (with her two dogs) and rarely goes out. Ana’s mother explains that Maya Devi lost her father early and lived in that house with her chacha (father’s brother) and mother. Maya Devi was, and still is, a beautiful girl but her chacha constantly thwarted her marriage (by berating her and chasing away suitors). This was because he stood to inherit her estate. In time he passed away and Maya resigned herself to a dreary and solitary life.  Ira devises a plan to write love letters to Maya. The girls hope that this prank may bring some light into Maya’s life. They write letters, vivid and touching and steamy, pretending to be a former suitor, now in Delhi, still pining for Maya. Ira takes the prank further by breaking into Maya’s house one evening to steal a photograph. This goes badly; Ira breaks her ankle, as does Maya’s maid; the girls are reprimanded and Ana is tasked with filling in for the maid until the maid recovers. During this time Ana gets a little closer to Maya. The letters still arrive and Ana observes that Maya becomes happier with each new letter.  One day Maya stuns everyone by announcing that she is selling the house and moving to Delhi to find the letter writer, her long lost suitor. Ana discovers, to her horror, that the letter which prompted the decision was written by Ira and had an explicit invitation. She runs to dissuade Maya but is unable to do so. She confides in her mother. Ana is reprimanded and sent away to boarding school, away from Ira. Ana leaves without saying goodbye to Ira and they never speak again. Ira is shattered.  Torn by the guilt of her prank, Ana makes it her mission to find Maya in Delhi. Over the next six years she sticks posters and makes phone calls and follows every lead to find Maya. She finds a boyfriend, Rahul, who ultimately proposes to her but she is unable to accept. She returns to Shimla to discuss this with her parents. Ira visits her but Ana is still angry and turns her away. Ira is profusely sorry and persists and ultimately accompanies Ana back to Delhi. Ana is still mad at Ira for her selfish and childish behaviour which likely destroyed Maya’s life, but Ira reveals that she, too, had fallen in love in Shimla, and had lost her love to a motor accident, and now, having lost love, is fully aware of the true consequences of her pranks. Ana forgives Ira and persuades Ira to transfer to a college in Delhi. But Ira decides to return to Shimla. As Ana bids goodbye to Ira on the train station she receives a phone call from Maya.  The girls hurry to meet Maya. To their astonishment they find her, bright and sparkling and happy, at the zoo garden. Maya reveals her story. She had arrived in Delhi and tried to trace the letter writer but found nothing. Instead, over time, she found that Delhi, and the world outside Shimla, was not so frightening after all. People were helpful and kind. And she eventually met a kind and charming man who owned a jewelry shop. In time she became close to this man, Ved, and they married. And today Maya is blissfully happy with her Ved. The letters changed her life and she tells them to say 'yes' to life. Ana and Ira are stunned. They joyfully hug Maya and she embraces them and invites them to call any time. The film ends as Ana accepts Rahul's proposal and Ira transfers to a college in Delhi.

Kraken's grandson, Deep, considers life to be boring, but shows an interest in objects made by people ever. He also involves his friends: [[angler fish]] Evo and [[shrimp]] Alice. Soon one of Deep's "pranks" leads to the fact that he accidentally endangers the inhabitants of his home, because of which they were enclosed by stones. Deep learns from Kraken that only the white whale Nathan can help them, and tell his grandson the necessary landmarks where Nathan can be found. Deep with Evo and Alice set out to find Nathan.  After passing several landmarks, friends get to the sunken ship (which is the Titanic), where they find the [[vampire squid]]  Norma, and she makes them listen to her performance, and then she tells them that in order to find Nathan, they need to get to Broadway. The heroes leave the ship with difficulty, since Norma would not let them go.  Along the way, Deep is attacked by [[Moray eel|moray]] Maura, but immediately after hearing from him that he has friends, he admits that she is lonely.

Having reached the Brooklyn Bridge, the friends found themselves surrounded by crabs, where their leader, the [[yeti crab]] Rico, requires a dance battle so that he can skip them. Alice taking part in the action, strikes Rico with his performance, and he falls in love with her.

Soon, when it was not clear where they are, the characters have disagreements, where everyone accuses Deep on a dangerous journey.

While Darcy and Luigi distracted the main characters by watching the film about the project "Ark-1" and "Ark-2" (which saved humans and ground animals respectively, leaving the Earth and went to settle another planet), they discuss the plan to deceive them by freezing and leave the Earth on the "Ark-3" (which is for aquatic animals), also they involve Maura and deceive her too.  When the heroes are placed in a trap, they finally met Nathan, who is chained, and then immediately learned of Darcy's plan to freeze everyone, including the deceived Maura, who had not fallen into the trap. Deep, Alice and Evo managed to disable the cell without letting it freeze, and then get out of the locked cell and join Maura in battle against Darcy, Luigi and Ralph. As a result, they triumph over the trio and are ejected from the already-going "Ark-3" along with Nathan and the other sea creatures.  Returning home, the characters, along with Nathan, begin to free the rubble of Kraken and the people, where Deep nearly sacrificed his life to completely free himself of the debris. After liberation, Maura begins to offer an idea where it will be possible to start fertilizing and increase the population, while Deep (believing that he was the last one of his kind) finds love.

Detroit (film)
 On July 23, 1967, the [[Detroit Police Department]] staged a raid on an [[Blind pig|unlicensed club]] during a celebration for returning black veterans from the [[Vietnam War]]. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the [[12th Street Riot]]. With state authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor [[George W. Romney]] authorizes the [[Michigan Army National Guard]] and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] authorizes [[paratroopers#United States|Army paratroopers]] to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, kills the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges.  [[The Dramatics]], a professional black [[R&B]] group, arrive in Detroit hoping to score a recording contract. Seconds before their scheduled performance at a music hall, the police shut down the venue and order them to leave the city. En route, their bus is attacked by rioters and the group subsequently splits up, with lead singer Larry Reed and his friend Fred Temple renting a room at the local Algiers Motel for the night. They meet two white girls, Julie Ann and Karen, who introduce them to their friends Carl Cooper and Aubrey Pollard. Carl and another friend stage a prank using a [[Starting pistol|starter pistol]], upsetting Julie and Karen, who move to the room of Greene, a Vietnam War veteran, while Larry and Fred return to their own room.  Melvin Dismukes, a private [[security guard]], is assigned to protect a grocery store from looters and ingratiates himself with the Guardsmen. Carl decides to fire several blanks from his pistol in the direction of the troops to frighten them, but they mistake it for a [[sniper]] attack and pinpoint it coming from the Algiers due to the pistol's [[muzzle flash]]. The [[Michigan State Police]], National Guard, and Detroit Police arrive at the motel to investigate, led by Detroit police officer Krauss. Entering the building, they gun down Carl when he tries to escape, and Krauss plants a knife next to his body as he bleeds out and dies.  They round up everyone in the hotel and line them against the wall, demanding to know who the sniper was. Despite not finding any weapon during a search of the room, Krauss terrorizes and interrogates the occupants of the hotel. Dismukes arrives to try to help. Unwilling to get involved, most of the state police and National Guard leave without informing anyone of Krauss's abuse.  Krauss orders several suspects to be moved to different rooms and subjected to [[mock execution]]s in order to terrify the others into confessing. One police officer actually kills Aubrey, as he didn't understand the executions were supposed to be faked. Julie and Karen are taken to an upstairs room when they begin screaming, and Julie's clothes are torn off. Disgusted, a Guardsman returns, and manages to get them released from custody. Fearing arrest, Krauss permits the remaining suspects to leave, but only if they swear to keep silent. Greene and Larry agree, but Fred is killed when he refuses.  As the riots die down, Dismukes, while working his other job in a factory, is arrested and charged with murder after Julie identifies him as being present at the Algiers that night. Krauss and his fellow officers are questioned as well, and when everyone except Krauss confesses, they are also charged. Larry, whose singing career has stalled due to the trauma he experienced, is summoned as a witness to testify. The judge ultimately refuses to accept any of the confessions as evidence, and without a solid case, the all-white jury acquits Dismukes, Krauss, and their co-defendants of all charges. Dismukes confronts Krauss with the truth, but finds himself powerless to get any justice for the victims.  The film ends by explaining what became of the participants: Dismukes moved to the suburbs to escape death threats and resumed work as a security guard, Krauss and his men remained on the force but never returned to active duty, Julie rebuilt her life and started a family, and Larry became a choir singer and still lives in Detroit to the present day.

Shelton criticizes Tommy's protracted and bizarre performance of a scene from ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', but Greg is impressed by Tommy's fearlessness and the two become friends. On Tommy's suggestion, they move to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue acting careers. Sestero discovers that Wiseau can afford apartments in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, but Wiseau will not discuss his personal life nor the source of his wealth.  Greg signs with [[Iris Burton]], a talent agent, while Tommy faces rejection from agencies, casting directors, and Hollywood insiders. Greg develops a relationship with Amber, whom he meets at her job at a nightclub, and Tommy grows jealous; as he fails to find work, he becomes disheartened. As Greg's auditions also dry up, he shares his frustrations with Tommy, who decides to make a movie for them both to star in.  Tommy writes a screenplay titled ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', a [[melodrama]] about a love triangle between banker Johnny (played by Tommy), his fiancée Lisa and his best friend Mark. Greg reluctantly accepts the role of Mark and an associate producer credit. They rent out a production house; Tommy insists on buying all the production equipment and shooting the film on [[35 mm film]] and [[Digital cinematography|HD Digital]] simultaneously, costly and unnecessary measures. The employees introduce Tommy to Raphael Smadja and Sandy Schklair, who work as his cinematographer and script supervisor respectively.  Production starts smoothly, but Tommy is difficult to work with. He forgets his lines, arrives late, and refuses to supply his crew with basic needs such as drinking water, even as an actor faints. During preparation for a sex scene, Tommy humiliates actress [[Juliette Danielle]] by pointing out her acne to the crew. Having filmed extensive behind-the-scenes footage, Tommy reveals that he knows everybody hates him, and believes that nobody, including Greg, supports his vision.  Greg and Amber run into ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' star [[Bryan Cranston]], who invites Greg to fill in for a small lumberjack part in a ''Malcolm'' episode. The part requires a beard; as Greg is due to shave his beard for ''The Room'', he begs Tommy to postpone shooting, but Tommy refuses. On the last day of shooting, Greg accuses Tommy of being selfish and duplicitous throughout their friendship, and questions his real age and origins, before storming off set.  Eight months later, Amber and Greg have split up and Greg is working in theatre. Tommy invites Greg to the premiere of ''The Room''; to his surprise, the entire cast and crew attend. The audience react first with horror then laughter at the film. Tommy bursts into tears and walks out, but Greg comforts him, telling him they have delighted the audience, not angered them. With a renewed mindset, Tommy returns to the theater as the credits roll, takes credit for his "comedic" movie, and receives a standing ovation.  Real-life clips of Wiseau attending screenings of ''The Room'' play, and title cards explain that the film made $1,800 against its reported $6 million budget during its initial release (Wiseau kept it running for two weeks, allegedly to qualify for the [[Academy Awards]]), but it has since become a profitable [[cult film]]. Wiseau and Sestero remain friends and, to this day, Wiseau's age, past life and source of income remain a mystery. Scenes from ''The Room'' are then compared side-by-side with reenactments of the scenes performed by ''The Disaster Artist'''s cast.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Wiseau has an odd verbal exchange with a party goer (played by the real Wiseau), who offers to hang out, but Wiseau refuses.

The interviewer asks Harbor if he feels responsible, to which he says no. Directly after, a member of the crew kills himself on air.  On the two year anniversary of the discovery, Harbor's son Will ([[Jason Segel]]) travels on a ferry where he meets Isla ([[Rooney Mara]]). They have a conversation and Will notes Isla looks very familiar. He says he is upset that people keep killing themselves, while Isla thinks it's an easy way out. Will also shares a memory he had while being dead for a minute, where he saw a young boy at a beach.  Will is picked up by his brother Toby ([[Jesse Plemons]]), who drives him to an isolated mansion where their father has built up his new station. Will notes people working for him, and Toby says they all attempted suicide. They enter a room where Will meets Lacey ([[Riley Keough]]) and Cooper ([[Ron Canada]]), and sees his father tied up to a machine as they kill and revive him. Will blames him for the high suicide rate.  Later, Will sees Isla on the beach as she walks into the water with a backpack loaded down by a gym weight. He runs after, barely saving her. He brings her to the mansion, where she is taken in. At a later meeting with the occupants, Thomas reveals he invented a machine that can record what dead people see in the afterlife, which requires a dead person, and they steal the corpse of Pat Phillips (Paul Bellefeuille) from the morgue.  Will reveals to Isla that his mother killed herself when he was younger. The next day, they try to record the afterlife but nothing happens. After the failed attempt, Will enters the room alone and puts back a piece of wiring he took out of the machine, which then shows a sequence of Pat Phillips driving to a hospital, visiting someone and fighting with a woman  there. Will finds the hospital from the recording online and visits it, but finds that the hallway from the video is gone after remodeling a decade prior.  Later, during a meeting, Thomas brings Lacey on stage and confronts her about telling other people in the mansion about the failed device and tells her to leave immediately. Will drives Isla to the hospital and shows her the recording and tells her that he thinks the device records memory rather than the afterlife. After breaking into the hospital, they find a file from Pat Phillips' father, who died in the hospital.  Isla finds out that the man in the recording has a different tattoo from the one she saw on Pat earlier. Will drives her to the beach, where she reveals to him that she had a son and that he died while she was asleep. Later they seek out the woman from the video, revealed to be Pat's sister Janice (M.J. Karmi). She tells them that Pat left her alone with their dying father and that he never visited him in the hospital.  Isla and Will grow closer together and share a kiss, which is interrupted by Toby. Together they rush to Thomas, who is hooked up on the machine and dead. They observe that he is seeing the night their mother killed herself, except that Thomas stops her. They are able to revive Thomas, who concludes that the afterlife is an alternate version of their existing life, only with different choices made. They agree to destroy the machine, as this revelation would provoke millions of suicides by people wanting to improve the lives they have. Thomas prepares to hold a speech, which is interrupted by Lacey shooting Isla, claiming she has just "relocated" her. Isla dies in Will's arms.  Later, a devastated Will hooks himself up with the machine. He arrives back on the ferry, where he meets Isla again, who states that this is a memory. It is revealed that Will is living in a memory loop trying to prevent Isla's death and that he restarts on the ferry every time. Isla says that he saved her and that they both will move on now. Although Toby and Thomas try to revive Will, he dies, promising Isla to remember her.  Will stands on the beach, where he sees a little boy and gets him out of the water. The little boy's mother, Isla, arrives and thanks Will. They don't recognize each other. After she leaves, he walks away, but starting to recall who Isla is, he slowly stops and looks back.

Ronit receives a call from London, in the middle of a photo shoot, informing her that her father has passed away. After a night of drinking and a random sexual encounter, Ronit flies to New York and arrives at the North London home of her childhood friend, Dovid Kuperman, a young Orthodox Rabbi and disciple of Rabbi Krushka. Dovid is Rabbi Krushka's main disciple, having been taken in and raised by the Rabbi at the age of thirteen.   Dovid's house is filled with other members of the [[congregation]] who are there to pay their respects to Rabbi Krushka. It's obvious that Ronit doesn't fit in here as she smokes cigarettes, and talks and dresses in a manner not conforming to the standards of Orthodox Jewish culture. Dovid is nervously surprised by Ronit's visit and ushers her into the kitchen to talk. Dovid inquires at to where Ronit is staying while in London, insisting that she stay with him. They are joined by Esti, a childhood friend of both Dovid and Ronit, and teacher at a local Jewish day school. Ronit questions Dovid on his marital status and he eventually tells her that he is married to Esti. Ronit is visibly shaken and inquires why she wasn't told about the marriage. There is a general feeling of tension in the air.    A few days later, Ronit visits her uncle Moshe Hartog at his wig store to discuss the disposition of her father's house. To her surprise, Ronit's father has left all of his possessions (including his house) to the [[synagogue]]. Moshe provides Ronit with a set of keys to her father's house so that she can clear her personal items. Later that day Esti catches up with Ronit after spotting her on the street and together, they go to Rabbi Krushka's house. After reminiscing  a while and looking through the house, Esti approaches Ronit and the two begin to caress and kiss each other. At first Ronit asks Esti to stop but then they start again. At this point, Esti confesses that she was the one who contacted the congregation to notify Ronit about her father's death.   Walking home together, Esti explains to Ronit that she's not happy with her life with Dovid, but has chosen this life based on the advice of Rabbi Krushka and her strong belief in "[[Names_of_God_in_Judaism#HaShem|HaShem]]". Both Esti and Ronit admit to each either that neither has been with any other women. However, while Ronit seems to be either [[bi-sexual]] or mainly just interested in men, Esti admits she still only prefers women. On the way home, Esti and Ronit stop off at a nearby park, the site of their first kiss. They begin to kiss and fondle each other but are immediately spotted by another couple from the congregation. Esti seems to get away without being seen. However, the couple calls after Ronit. Ronit approaches the couple who ask her if that was Esti was with her in the park. Ronit says "no", but the couple doesn't seem to believe her.  The next day, in front of her class, Esti is called into the headmistresses' office. The couple from park are also in the office, having just delivered a complaint about Esti and Ronit's activities.  At the synagogue, Dovid is approached by a small group of man informing him that they would like him to take over Rabbi Krushka's duties. Dovid is also questioned regarding his decision to allow Ronit to stay in his house. Dovid is even warned about Ronit, but insists that he "keeps his house in order".  Ronit catches up with Esti after school Esti says that "this can't go on any longer" and Ronit says that she is leaving tomorrow. However, Ronit suggests that they go someplace to be alone. They sneak away again to a hotel room in downtown London where they have extremely passionate sex.  Later that evening, Dovid arrives home but neither Esti and Ronit are there. As Dovid gets ready for bed, Esti  arrives home and apologizes for being late. Dovid caresses Esti  and tries to engage her in sexual activity but she tells him "don't".  The next morning Esti admits to Dovid that she kissed Ronit. She tells him that she wants her freedom.   Ronit and Esti attend the [[Hesped]] (eulogy) for Rabbi Krushka. The entire congregation is attendance, along with Dovid, who is delivering the eulogy. Dovid, visibly shaken and emotional, is unable to continue reading from his prepared text. He improvises instead, speaking to the sermon on "Free Will" that Rabbi Krushka was in the middle of delivering when he passed away. Dovid looks up to Esti, who is sitting in the up in the women's section, and tells her that she is free. Ronit and Esti leave the synagogue together and are shortly joined by Dovid who approaches and embraces Esti. He motions for Ronit to come over and the three embrace.  The next morning Dovid awakes alone in his bedroom. Esti has slept on the downstairs couch. Ronit is packed and ready to fly back home to New York. Ronit's cab arrives. She says her goodbyes, wishing Dovid and Esti each a "long and happy life". As Ronit's cab is driving away, Esti runs out of the house chasing after her. The cab stops and Esti enters the cab, giving Ronit a final kiss and embrace before sending her on her way.

Dolores (film)
   The documentary begins discussing Dolores' life prior to her becoming the activist she is known for being today. Dolores during the 1940s and 50's was living out the typical life of a Chicano for that period. Even at an early age she was disturbed by the world around her, and felt unsatisfied with the life that she was living. She witnessed police brutality and other horrors that made her feel that there was not true justice or equality in the world she was living in. In addition, she was unsatisfied with her life as a young mother. Having been married and divorced twice she was looking for something to fulfill her and this is when she met [[Fred Ross]].<ref name=":2"> Portrait of Labor and Feminist Icon Dolores Huerta  Independent Lens  PBS|work=Independent Lens|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}</ref>  Fred Ross was community organizer in California who was searching for individuals who were willing to make the community better. His goals were immediately attractive to young Huerta because of Ross' focus on police brutality, and his efforts to combat it. There relationship blossomed and by 1959 Dolores was head of the Stockton Chapter of the Community Service Organization, a group that was dedicated to helping Latino individuals in the community.  During this time period Dolores proved to be a great leader, organizer and lobbyist. She would pack 100's of people into the office of legislators until they came around to supporting legislation she wanted. In addition, it was during these early years that she was introduced, by Ross, to [[Cesar Chavez]]. Chavez had the goal of organizing a union for farm workers and knew Dolores was going to be the person he needed to help him achieve this goal. Between the efforts of both Huerta and Chavez the [[United Farm Workers|United Farm Workers of America]] was born. The documentary discusses the extensive commitment Dolores made when starting up this organization. She was forced to pick up and move her family to [[Delano, California]] in order to be connected to the agricultural communities she was trying to help. She was forced to even leave some of her younger children behind for fear they would not be able to endure the circumstances of their new living conditions and mothers dedication to the UFW. She sacrificed a lot during the early years even some of the things she enjoyed the most, like listening to jazz music.  === 1965 === While UFW had made great strides in the relations of farm workers and farm owners the Filipino workers going on strike. It was then that Huerta and Chavez realized that they needed more inclusion in their organization. Not just Latino's were facing these horrible working conditions. As the UFW started to include more groups of workers they also started to recruit more and more individuals to work for them. In fact, there were more women involved in the UFW than in any other union in the United States combined. The following year, 1966, the UFW saw its first major success following the [[Delano grape strike|March to Sacramento]]. The march from Delano to Sacramento California was the largest gathering of farmworkers in California history. As a result of the march, the Schenley Contract was negotiated. This contract was the first between farm workers and growers.<ref name=":2" />  === 1968 === During [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy's]] run for president he became a huge supporter of the UFM and disenfranchised groups as a whole. As a senator he stood with the movement in regards to their treatment during the strikes. He actively went after the corporations who were mistreating the farmworkers. Due to his support of the UFM, the UFM fully supported his presidential run. Everyone went and worked on his campaign. UFM members would knock on doors persuading people to vote and even registering them to vote.<ref name=":2" />  The relationship between Senator Kennedy and Dolores was so strong that she was actually with him the night of his assassination. This event was very jarring for Dolores and the rest of the UFW because they felt that the one person who would actually stand up for them was gone. In addition, his assassination made Dolores even more passionate about non-violence in her movement.  === 1973 === By 1973 the UFW had successfully organized three year contracts in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. As the contracts were about to expire the UFW started to experience problems with [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|the teamsters.]]    They wanted to represent all of the people formerly represented by the UFW. They were ultimately successful in a lot of their efforts. As a result, the UFW went on strikes and boycotts that often turned extremely violent so even resulting in death. This was all particularly upsetting for Dolores because it became clear to her that the current system did not what "brown people" to have an organization or have power.<ref name=":2" />  === 1988 === In 1998, [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] was holding a fundraiser in California. Many members of the UFW, including Dolores went and were peacefully protesting outside the building. As the crowd grew larger, crowd control officers began pushing and yelling at the protestors to move back. Dolores was following their orders when suddenly one of the officers started to hit and bash her with a police button. She was hospitalized with three broken ribs as well as had to undergo emergency spleen removal. The beating resulted in a very long hospitalization and Dolores was weak for many many months. She had to take a long absence from the movement she had worked so passionately for many years.<ref name=":2" />  === 1993 === In 1993, Chavez was found dead of natural causes in Arizona.

Downsizing (film)
 In the future, searching for a way to solve [[overpopulation]] and [[global warming]], a scientist invents "downsizing", a process to shrink people to a height of five inches. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money.  Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, [[New Mexico]] one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him.  One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, the divorce left him without Audrey's share of their assets. In addition, Paul's share of the asset shrunk further still due to [[divorce settlement]] negotiations. Paul, whose [[occupational therapist]] license had lapsed and faced a re-certification process due to Leisureland being in another state, now works as a customer service representative for [[Lands' End]]. While attending a birthday party, Paul has a discussion with Dave and says that he regrets his decision to downsize. Soon after, Paul breaks up with his girlfriend and attends a party hosted by his neighbor Dušan.  The next morning, Paul notices that one of Dušan's housecleaners is [[Ngoc Lan Tran]], a Vietnamese political activist who was jailed and downsized against her will. Ngoc Lan was the sole survivor of a human smuggling attempt to the United States in a television box and had her leg amputated upon arrival. Attempting to assist Ngoc Lan with her prosthetic leg, Paul returns to her house in the [[slums]] outside of the walls of Leisureland. After assisting Ngoc Lan's dying friend, Paul attempts to repair Ngoc Lan's prosthetic leg only to break it and render her unable to work. In return, Paul works for Ngoc Lan's cleaning service where he also assists in gathering food from around the city that Ngoc Lan distributes throughout the slums. Dušan attempts to release Paul from his obligation by taking him to Norway, the site of the first small community, with his friend Joris Konrad, but Ngoc Lan also wishes to come along. Ngoc Lan had received international attention after her arrival in the United States, including personal correspondence from the inventor of downsizing, Dr. Jørgen Asbjørnsen, who had previously invited her to Norway to express his regret at the abuse of his procedure.  While traveling in a [[fjord]], Paul's boat encounters Dr. Asbjørnsen and his wife, Anne-Helene. Dr. Asbjørnsen announces that humanity is doomed, as the [[positive feedback]] of [[Arctic methane emissions]] cannot be stopped, and will result in the eventual extinction of the human race. Arriving in the first colony, Paul is shown that Dr. Asbjørnsen planned for such a contingency with the creation of a large vault inside a mountain to insulate the colony and preserve humanity in the event of an extinction. Paul is excited to enter the vault and asks Ngoc Lan to join him. She rejects his offer, saying that he does not need to enter the vault and can do good in their community by returning. Paul enters the vault, but changes his mind and leaves as the door is closing and subsequently blasted to seal the occupants inside, choosing to return with Ngoc Lan, Dušan, and Konrad.  Having returned to Leisureland, Paul assists Ngoc Lan in her duties of providing needed aid and supplies to the people of the slums.

Meanwhile, Takararu and Yamato's fight is interrupted by [[List_of_Shuriken_Sentai_Ninninger_characters#Yoshiharu_Igasaki|Yoshiharu]], Takararu's son who came from the future to prevent the Zyuohgers and the Ninningers from killing each other and ending the history of Super Sentai.  Not meeting his friends at the camp site, [[List_of_Doubutsu_Sentai_Zyuohger_characters#Misao_Mondo|Misao]] returns to Uncle Mario's house where he is abducted by the other Ninningers and Runrun uses some vines and a mask to restrain him, while the other Zyuohgers encounter [[List_of_Shuriken_Sentai_Ninninger_characters#Kinji_Takigawa|Kinji]], and after learning that he is also a Ninninger and that Misao was taken by the others, capture him as well.

Dr. Nawariyan
 Nirwan Senanayake ([[Ranjan Ramanayake]]), nicknamed "Nawariyan" (literally "Nine feet tall man") is a ''thug'': a crime don in the [[Colombo]]. Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor, he creates the [[wikt:faux|faux]] Senanayake Hospital (named after his father) and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father ([[Rex Kodippili]]) and mother ([[Sriyani Amarasena]]) visit him in [[Colombo]].  One year, however, Nirwan's plan goes awry when his father meets an old friend, Dr. Dean Wickramasinghe (Srimal Wedisinghe) and the two older men decide to complete their friendship by a relationship, where Nirwan to Wickramasinghe's daughter, Dr. Bhagya  "Pinki" (Ruwangi Rathnayake). At this point the truth about Nirwan is revealed by the servant of Wickramasinghe's house (Nilmini Kottegoda). Wickramasinghe insults Nirwan's parents and calls them "fools" for being ignorant of Nirwan's real life as gang leader Nawariyan. Nirwan's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village. Nirwan, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Wickramasinghe is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery#Sri Lanka|MBBS]] degree.  With the help of his right-hand man Circuit (Sarath Chandrasiri) and others, Nirwan "gains admission" to a medical college, where he again encounters Dr. Wickramasinghe, who is the dean of private hospital. His success there becomes dependent upon the (coerced) help of faculty member Dr. Roshan ([[Sarath Kothalawala]]).  While Nawariyan's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the "Magic Kiss" ("magical hug")&nbsp;– a method of comfort taught to Nirwan by his mother&nbsp;– and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Nirwan constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man called "Ananda Ayya" (Rajasinghe Loluwagoda) as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated janitor; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery.  Dr. Wickramasinghe, who perceives all this as symptoms of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]], is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational and anger, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and he begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. Wickramasinghe's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, his daughter becomes increasingly fond of Nirwan, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Nirwan is unaware that Dr. Bhagya and his childhood friend "Pinki" are one and the same; an ignorance that Bhagya hilariously exploits. Wickramasinghe tries several times to expel Nirwan but is often thwarted by Nirwan's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Nirwan, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. Wickramasinghe keeps a challenge that Nirwan can stay in college only if he passes the exam under his supervision. Nirwan and other mates accept it. Meanwhile, cancer patient Anushka (Akila Sandakelum) is in a dying state seeking help from Nirwan. But unfortunately he dies in Nirwan's arms.  Eventually, Nirwan is shamed into leaving the college: His [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for not being able to help Anushka gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Nirwan's departure, Ananda miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point Bhagya gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticizes her father for having banished Nirwan, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness from the college. Wickramasinghe eventually realizes his folly. Nirwan later get to know that Dr. Bhagya, is actually "Pinki".

Gibson opens a hatch, freeing Tommy and Alex from the hold, and they get back to the beach.

German troops shoot at the boat, and water enters through the bullet holes. Alex, hoping to lighten the boat, accuses Gibson (who has been silent throughout) of being a German spy, and demands that he leave. Gibson reveals he is French; he stole the identity of the dead soldier he buried, hoping to be evacuated with the British. The soldiers abandon the fishing boat when it begins to sink. Gibson is unable to get out and drowns. Alex and Tommy swim towards a nearby destroyer, but it is sunk by a bomber. ''Moonstone'' manoeuvres to take on those in the water, including Alex and Tommy. Peter discovers that George is dead; when asked by the shell-shocked soldier, he lies that George is fine. Farrier shoots down the bomber before his fuel runs out. Gliding over the beach, he shoots down a dive-bomber, and then lands beyond the perimeter. He sets fire to his plane and is then taken prisoner. At the beach, Royal Navy Commander Bolton watches the last British soldiers leave. He notes that nearly 300,000 have been evacuated, ten times more than Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] had hoped for. He remains to oversee the evacuation of the French.  Arriving back in Weymouth, Dawson is congratulated for having saved so many men. The shell-shocked soldier sees George's body being carried away. Peter goes to the local newspaper; a front-page article later commends George as a hero.

When Gene is selected, he panics, makes a panicked expression, and wrecks the text center. Gene is called in by Smiler, a [[smiley]] emoji and leader of the text center, who concludes that Gene is a "malfunction" and therefore must be deleted. Gene is chased by [[Software agent|bots]], but is rescued by Hi-5, a once popular emoji who has since lost his fame due to lack of use. He tells Gene that he can be fixed if they find a [[hacker]], and Hi-5 accompanies him so that he can reclaim his fame.  Smiler sends more bots to look for Gene when she finds out that he has left Textopolis, as his actions have caused Alex to think that his phone needs to be fixed. Gene and Hi-5 come to a [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] [[Mobile app|app]] where they meet a hacker emoji named Jailbreak, who wants to reach [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] so that she can live in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. The trio is attacked by Smiler's bots, but manage to escape into the game ''[[Candy Crush Saga|Candy Crush]]''. Jailbreak reveals that Gene can be fixed in the cloud, and the group goes off into the [[Just Dance Now|''Just Dance'' app]]. While there, Jailbreak is revealed to be a princess emoji who fled home after tiring of being [[stereotype]]d. They are once again attacked by bots, and their actions cause Alex to delete the ''Just Dance'' app. Gene and Jailbreak escape, but Hi-5 is taken along with the app and ends up in the [[Trash (computing)|trash]].  Mel and Mary go searching for Gene and have a very lethargic argument. They make up in the [[Instagram]] app when Mel reveals that he, too, is a malfunction, explaining Gene's behavior. While traveling through [[Spotify]], Jailbreak admits that she likes Gene just the way he is, and that he should not be ashamed of his malfunction. They make it to the trash and rescue Hi-5, but are soon attacked by a bot upgraded with illegal malware. They evade it by entangling it's arms and enter Dropbox, where they encounter a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. After many tries, the gang get past it with a password being Addie's name and make it to the cloud, where Jailbreak prepares to reprogram Gene. Gene admits his feelings for Jailbreak, but she wishes to stick to her plan of venturing into the cloud, unintentionally causing Gene to revert to his apathetic programming out of heartbreak. The upgraded bot takes Gene, and Hi-5 and Jailbreak race after them on a [[Twitter]] bird summoned by Jailbreak in her princess form.  As Smiler prepares to delete Gene, Mel and Mary arrive. Mel reveals to everyone that he is also a malfunction, prompting Smiler to threaten deleting him as well. Jailbreak and Hi-5 arrive and disable the bot, which falls on top of Smiler. Alex has since taken his phone to the store and asks to have his phone erased to fix the problem. Out of desperation, Gene prepares to have himself texted to Addie, making numerous faces to express himself. Realizing that Addie received a text from him, Alex stops his phone from getting erased, saving the emoji and finally getting to speak with Addie, who likes the emoji Alex sent. Gene accepts himself for who he is and is celebrated by all of the emojis.  In a [[mid-credits scene]], Smiler has been relegated to the "loser lounge" with the other unused and forgotten emojis for her crimes, wearing numerous braces due to her teeth being cracked by the bot, and playing and losing a game of [[Go Fish]].

Shortly afterwards, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, are recruited by [[Diplomatic Security Service]] (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs to help him retrieve an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP device]] from a military outpost in [[Berlin]]. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison he helped imprison Deckard Shaw in. After escaping, Deckard and Hobbs are recruited by intelligence operative Mr. Nobody and his protégé to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Deckard reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen Shaw to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as the latter two attack the base and steal God's Eye. When Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has been holding hostage Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves—as well as their son, of whose existence Dom was previously unaware. Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos.  In [[New York City]], Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a [[nuclear football]] held by the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Russian Minister of Defence]]. Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher - with the help of Raldo - and persuades Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to drive automatically and taking out the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom.  Dom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a [[nuclear submarine]], enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Deckard, whose death was apparently faked, teams up with Owen, and under Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher fires an [[Infrared homing|infrared homing missile]] at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion. When Deckard reaches the front of the plane and confronts a defeated Cipher, she makes her escape by parachuting out of the plane.  Mr. Nobody and his protégé visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large in [[Athens]]. Hobbs is offered his DSS job back, but he declines in order to spend more time with his daughter. Deckard delivers Dom his son, putting his differences aside with Dom and Hobbs. Dom names his son Brian, after his friend and brother-in-law [[Brian O'Conner]], and they celebrate.

Ferdinand (film)
 In [[Spain]], a ranch owned by Moreno ([[Raúl Esparza]]) that trains bulls for bullfighting called Casa del Toro harbours a bull calf named Ferdinand (Colin H. Murphy). He is ridiculed by his fellow calves Bones (Nile Diaz), Guapo ([[Jet Jurgensmeyer]]), and Valiente (Jack Gore) for being non-confrontational and his tendency to smell and protect flowers. A saddened Ferdinand runs away from Casa del Toro after his father Raf ([[Jeremy Sisto]]) does not return from the bull fight he was picked for and a flower he was fond of was flattened by Valiente after his own father was defeated by Raf. He eventually winds up at a florist's farm in [[Seville]] and is adopted by the owner Juan ([[Juanes]]), his dog Paco ([[Jerrod Carmichael]]), and his daughter Nina (Julia Saldanha) with whom he shares a bond, much to Paco's jealousy.    When Ferdinand ([[John Cena]]) eventually grows up into an enormous bull, he still retains his non-violent, flower-loving nature. Due to his size, he is left alone when Juan, Nina (Lily Day), and Paco go to [[Ronda]] for an annual flower festival. Ferdinand decides to go anyway, resulting in him getting stung by a bee and unintentionally causing chaos around town and is taken away back to Casa del Toro, much to his and the family’s sadness.  Once back there, he finds that Bones ([[Anthony Anderson]]), Guapo ([[Peyton Manning]]), and Valiente ([[Bobby Cannavale]]) have also grown up and have been joined by a Scottish bull named Angus ([[David Tennant]]) and a silent but intimidating bull named Maquina (Tim Nordquist). Ferdinand is still disrespected by the bulls, but manages to befriend a crazy goat named Lupe ([[Kate McKinnon]]) who wants to be his coach in bullfighting despite his lack of interest and three hedgehogs named Una ([[Gina Rodriguez]]), Dos ([[Daveed Diggs]]), and Cuatro ([[Gabriel Iglesias]]) who frequently invade Casa del Toro to steal food. They used to have another brother named Tres, but they claim he is dead.  One day, a legendary but egotistical bullfighter named El Primero ([[Miguel Ángel Silvestre]]) arrives at Casa del Toro to choose the biggest, strongest, and most aggressive bull to fight against before he retires. When the bulls fail to impress him on their first try, Guapo is taken to a nearby slaughterhouse and the other bulls tell Ferdinand that it will eventually be their fate if they are not chosen for a bullfight. Although Ferdinand manages to earn the respect of the other bulls, except Valiente, after a dance-off with three Austrian [[Lipizzan|Lipzzans]] ([[Sally Phillips]], [[Flula Borg]] and [[Boris Kodjoe]]), they still hold on to the belief that fighting is the only way for them to live. Ferdinand manages to convince Lupe to come back with him to Nina's farm and the hedgehogs help them escape, but when Ferdinand is close to freedom, he sees his father's picture on a wall with his horns mounted, along with dozens of other horns, making him realize that every bull who is chosen to fight gets slain by the matador.  Ferdinand explains to the other bulls that they will all eventually be killed even if they are chosen to fight. Valiente is the only one unconvinced and charges Ferdinand outside where Ferdinand inadvertently beats him in a fight and knocks off his right horn, much to the other animals' shock. Primero witnesses the scuffle, and chooses Ferdinand to fight him after seeing him defeat Valiente. When Valiente is taken to the slaughterhouse, Ferdinand rallies up the remaining bulls to escape but first goes to the slaughterhouse to break out Valiente. He at first refuses as he believes that the slaughterhouse is his fate now, but they discover that Guapo is still alive, and Ferdinand questions Valiente's courage after Valiente refuses to help him rescue Guapo. When Ferdinand tries to save Guapo, he accidentally activates a series of deadly contraptions, but with the help of a now-friendlier Valiente, they escape the slaughterhouse. The bulls, Lupe, the hedgehogs and a red bunny rabbit steal the training area's company truck to escape, with Moreno and his employees giving chase.  The animals try desperately to lose the humans and wind up at [[Madrid Atocha railway station|Atocha]] train station in [[Madrid]] that Ferdinand sees as his ticket back to Nina. When the bulls push a small railroad cart to catch the train back to Nina's home, Ferdinand sacrifices himself so the other bulls can escape (except for Lupe, who stays behind in shock after Ferdinand's act) and is captured by Moreno and his employees. When Nina learns of Ferdinand's upcoming fight with El Primero, she and Juan set out to Madrid to find and rescue Ferdinand.  At [[Las Ventas]] bullfight arena, Lupe tries to convince Ferdinand that he must fight in order to survive, but Ferdinand is silently unsure. When Ferdinand is released into the bullfight ring, he refuses to fight at first but is urged into fighting by El Primero. While being forced to run into Primero’s cape, Ferdinand is able to grab the cape from Primero with his horn and is temporarily blinded by it. Primero attempts to grab his cape back from Ferdinand, but is accidentally tossed out of the ring by Ferdinand. Primero re-enters the ring angrily and attacks Ferdinand using banderillas, striking him in the shoulder. Ferdinand almost retaliates against him, but sees a [[carnation]] underneath his hoof and realizes he is becoming the fighter he was determined not to be. As Primero draws his sword in order to finish Ferdinand, the crowd begins to cheer for Ferdinand, convincing Primero to spare him. Ferdinand is then reunited with Nina, who embraces him as the crowd throws carnations to the ring to praise the bull. The other bulls arrive, thinking they are too late to save Ferdinand, but instead witness Ferdinand making history as the first bull to ever make it out of a bullfight alive by being himself. Impressed, they sit to praise him for his efforts.  In the end, Ferdinand returns home with Nina, Juan, and Paco. They are joined by the other bulls, the hedgehogs, the bunny, and Lupe, who all move into the farm. The film ends with Ferdinand, his bull friends, and Lupe watching the sunset over Ronda from a field of flowers.  In a brief mid-credits scene, the hedgehogs are confronted by Tres who is revealed to have been alive the whole time.

Peter is a divorced [[proctologist]] with a teenage son who resents him.  Shortly after his mother's wedding, Peter recognizes an actor on ''[[Law and Order: SVU]]'' as his father from his photo, and confronts his mother at her wedding.  Helen explained that she had been promiscuous at the time of her children's conception, and did not want their father to help raise them. As they press the issue, Helen reveals that their father is [[Terry Bradshaw]]. The brothers fly down to Florida to meet Bradshaw, who they encounter at a signing event. Bradshaw is excited to have them as sons, and welcomes them in to his home. As Bradshaw recounts stories with his friend and former teammate, Rod Hamilton ([[Ving Rhames|Rhames]]), Kyle and Peter realize that Bradshaw had been traveling in Australia at the time of their conception, and thus couldn't be their father.  The brothers are directed to find Roland Hunt ([[J.K. Simmons|Simmons]]), a New York investor who dated Helen after Bradshaw. As they travel north, Kyle finds that his royalties deal with the hot sauce company is ending, and he will be unable to support his growing family. Upon arriving at what they assumed was his office, the brothers find a boarded-up house. Hunt, thinking they are robbers, confronts them at gunpoint until they reveal they were looking for him because he dated their mother. He invites them inside, but expresses his dissatisfaction at having children.  As the brothers prepare to depart, they offer to help their father in his job, which he claims is repossession. As Hunt breaks into a Ferrari, it becomes clear that he is a criminal. As the brothers argue with the owners of the Ferrari, Hunt attempts to escape, only to feel remorse for abandoning his sons. The brothers steal the Ferrari and end up hitting Hunt, who was returning to find them. At the hospital, the brothers find that they are incompatible to give Hunt blood, indicating that he cannot be their father. Hunt realizes that he was in prison at the time of their conception, but directs them to find another of Helen's ex-boyfriends named Sparkly P.  Unable to find Sparkly P, the brothers prepare to return home. Along the way, they pick up a hitch hiker ([[Katt Williams|Williams]]), who provides advice as they travel north. After accidentally parking on railroad tracks, Peter and the hitch hiker narrowly escape getting hit by a train, while Kyle is stuck in the car and presumably killed. Initially devastated, Peter is surprised to see Kyle walk away from the car, only to be punched by Kyle for abandoning him. As they are being treated, the police officers recognize the name Sparkly P as Patrick O'Callaghan, a former police officer. As the brothers travel north, they stop at a hotel, where Peter meets and seduces Sarah ([[Katie Aselton|Aselton]]). The next morning, the brothers arrive at Patrick O'Callaghan's house to find a party occurring, only to quickly find out that it is his wake. Patrick's daughter is invited to speak, and Peter realizes that it is Sarah, his presumed half-sister. Disgusted, Peter makes a scene as he runs out of the wake, but is told by Patrick's twin brother, Kevin, that Patrick could not be his father, as he had been celibate while dating Helen. Kevin directs them to contact Dr. Walter Tinkler ([[Christopher Walken|Walken]]), who is a family friend and veterinarian from their home town.  Kyle and Peter return home to confront Dr. Tinkler. Helen arrives to explain that Tinkler is not their father, as she is not their biological mother.  Helen explains that she had been working at a shelter when a woman came in and gave birth to twins. The mother died during childbirth, and Helen chose to adopt Kyle and Peter instead of having them become foster children. The brothers are happy to have learned their history, and reconcile their differences.  A year later, Kyle, Peter, and Helen are on vacation in [[Maui]]. Peter is now dating Sarah, and his son respects him. Kyle and Kaylani have twin daughters.

  A young Shirou Emiya and his adoptive father Kiritsugu travel to Fuyuki in order to investigate the Sakatsuki family, who are rumored to be harboring a child with powerful magic abilities. However, they arrive to find the city engulfed in a massive black vortex which is banished by a mysterious light. They enter the ruins of the city where they find and rescue Miyu, the child they are looking for.  Kiritsugu explains that Miyu has the power to grant wishes unconditionally, and that the storm was most likely caused when she was inadvertently exposed to humans thoughts and desires. Kiritsugu declares that he will use her power to save humanity. Shirou and Kiritsugu take Miyu back to their home, where Kiritsugu makes it clear to Shirou that they should only consider her a tool and not a human. Regardless, Shirou begins to bond with Miyu and Kiritsugu passes away before he can learn how to use Miyu's powers.  Five years later, Shirou is living as a regular high school student with Miyu as his adopted younger sister and attends school with his classmates Julian and Sakura. During this, it appears that Miyu's powers have disappeared with age as Kiritsugu had originally feared. Shirou decides it's finally time to let Miyu experience the world outside their home, with Miyu saying she wants to see the ocean. Feeling guilt for his past actions, he takes her to the ruins of her original family's home where he admits that he and Kiritsugu originally took her in to exploit her powers, not save her. Julian then arrives, telling Shirou that he had been looking for Miyu for the past five years in order to finish the ritual he had started. Shirou realizes that Julian was the cause of the vortex that consumed Fuyuki and attempts to protect Miyu, but is easily defeated by Julian and his followers and left for dead while Miyu is kidnapped.  Shirou then wakes up in the care of a local priest, Kirei Kotomine. Kirei explains that Julian is part of the Ainsworth family, an ancient family of mages who foresaw the end of humanity and sought to obtain the wish granting Holy Grail to avert it. However, their four past attempts to obtain it in a ritual called the Holy Grail War ended in failure, with the Fourth Grail War resulting in the vortex that destroyed much of Fuyuki. However, this time, Julian plans to use Miyu as a sacrifice to start the Fifth Grail War. Kirei tells Shirou where Julian's hideout is, but Shirou is unable to penetrate its magical defenses. Sakura then visits him and informs him that the Fifth Grail War has started, and the participants have been given special Servant Cards that can imbue them with the power of a Heroic Spirit. She offers one to Shirou to give him a way to rescue Miyu, but admits that she would rather see him leave the city and not get involved in the War due to her feelings for him. They are then attacked by her older brother Shinji, who holds the Assassin Card. Sakura is killed and Shirou uses her Archer Card to empower himself and kill Shinji, who is revealed to merely be a puppet sent by Julian.   With his Archer Card, Shirou begins hunting down the other Servant Card holders and killing them, who are all revealed to be Julian's puppets as well. Julian observes Shirou's progress along with Miyu, who now only sees herself as a tool to be used and does nothing to stop Julian's plans. Kirei congratulates Shirou for winning the Fifth Grail War and directs him to an ancient cave where Miyu is being held. Julian confonts Shirou and tries to talk him out of taking Miyu back, explaining how she is a necessary sacrifice to save humanity. Shirou counters by pointing out that for all four hundred years of their existence, the Sakatsuki family never used their wish granting powers for personal gain, but only to wish for their children to grow up healthy.   Shirou continues on and finally reunites with Miyu. He decides to use his wish to send Miyu to a different world where she can find happiness. As the wish takes effect, Shirou confronts the holder of the real Archer Card. Having used his Card to make his wish, Shirou is forced to fight the real Archer with his own abilities. While Shirou is eventually overpowered and defeated, he manages to buy enough time for the ritual to complete and Miyu is transported away.  Miyu then wakes up in an alternate Fuyuki that has not been ravaged by disaster, where she meets Star Sapphire, Magical Ruby, Rin Tohsaka, Luviagelita Edelfelt, and Illyasviel von Einzbern for the first time.

First They Killed My Father (film)
 During the [[Vietnam War]], the United States military begins bombing the neutral country of Cambodia, commencing the [[Cambodian Campaign]]. The U.S. pulls out of Cambodia and evacuates its embassy. A [[Khmer National Armed Forces|Lon Nol]] officer, Ung, known as "Pa" to his 7 children, including 7-year-old [[Loung Ung]], expresses regret in trusting the Americans as the Khmer Rouge draw closer. The family is forced to leave the city by the Khmer Rouge under the pretext that it will be bombed by Americans and join thousands of refugees. Pa Ung denies working for the government when questioned by soldiers, knowing that he will be killed if discovered. The family is found by "Uncle", the brother of Pa's wife, "Ma", and they stay with his family for some time. At the insistence of the Uncle's wife, who is afraid of the consequences if Ung's identity is discovered, they have to leave.  After days of travel they are rounded up by Khmer Rouge soldiers and taken with other refugees to a labour camp, where they have to build their own shelter and are forced to work in harsh conditions. Their possessions are taken from them, food is scarce as all crops are sent to fighting units and any attempt of getting more food is punished with beatings. Loung is a witness to her siblings' beatings as they try to get more food for themselves and their family. Aside from hard work, the camp preaches the regime [[propaganda]] and any foreign items (including life-saving medicine) are forbidden under a death penalty. Loung's two oldest brothers and oldest sister are re-assigned to other camps, and soon after her sister dies from sickness and starvation. One day Loung sees Pa taken away by the officials to repair a bridge. Knowing what will await him, he says goodbye to his wife and children.

She learns hand to hand combat, shooting, preparing traps and works on laying [[land mine|mine]] fields against Vietnamese. Children are constantly taught propaganda and hatred towards Vietnamese, but they get more food and are treated better than workers in the labour camps. One day Loung gets a pass to visit her sister in the labour camp, but instead she travels to the camp where her mother and youngest sister were left behind. She finds their hut empty and an old woman tells her that her family was taken away by the soldiers. That night Loung dreams about her mother laying dead in a mass grave with her youngest sister left next to her corpse to die. Loung's camp is attacked by Vietnamese, and she flees with other children and labour camp workers. On the road she reunites with her brother and sister. They join a group of other children in a temporary refugee camp, but when it is attacked by Khmer Rouge soldiers they need to flee for their lives.

The three siblings are reunited in another refugee camp which is run by the Red Cross. There Loung sees people beating a captured Khmer Rouge soldier. She sees him as her father, and [[flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to the violence in her life. As she cries out to the man as Pa, the aggressors disperse.

Fist Fight
  It is the last day before summer vacation at Roosevelt High School in [[Atlanta]], and the students are out of control, devising elaborate [[Senior Prank]]s and creating chaos. Andy Campbell, the school's mild-mannered and nerdy English teacher, and his fellow faculty members are trying to survive the chaotic day as best they can, but only the history teacher, Ron Strickland, is fierce enough to intimidate the students into behaving. Meanwhile, Campbell is awaiting news of the birth of his second child with his wife Maggie. While teaching, Campbell is pulled aside by his friend, the counselor Holly, to inform him of rumors of downsizing of all departments. Given his pregnant wife and child, this renders Campbell extremely anxious.  After preventing Campbell from walking into a paint trap, Strickland asks for his assistance in using an outdated [[Audiovisual|AV system]] which keeps turning off after a couple of seconds. Campbell catches a student, Neil, secretly using a remote control app on his [[smartphone]] to turn off the [[VCR]]. An infuriated Strickland grabs the phone and destroys it. Neil, using a classmate's phone, turns the TV off again and it enrages Strickland, who grabs a fire axe and destroys the student's desk, sending the class screaming from the room. Both Campbell and Strickland are brought to Principal Tyler's office to discuss the matter. Strickland warns Campbell to keep his behavior a secret, but after Tyler threatens to fire them both if no one steps forward, Campbell tells the truth, resulting in the loss of Strickland's job. In retaliation, Strickland challenges Campbell to a fist fight after school. Campbell is convinced that he physically does not stand a chance against Strickland, and tries to set matters straight by asking Neil to share a false testimony to Principal Tyler in order to clear Strickland's name and have him reinstated. Neil agrees on the condition that Campbell buy him a [[MacBook Pro]]. After doing so, Campbell runs into Maggie and his daughter, Ally, who remind him to arrive promptly that afternoon for Ally's father-daughter talent show. Neil's false account is enough to convince Principal Tyler to reinstate Strickland.  Campbell and Strickland receive an emergency call from Molly. The two meet up with her in a mock [[United Nations]] debate room and discover she tricked them into coming there so they could talk through their issues, with Holly acting as mediator. When Campbell tells Strickland that he was able to get him his job back, Strickland is further enraged, stating that Campbell should have told him about this plan before acting, and citing the mishandling of the school system. The fight is still on.  Campbell tries to call [[9-1-1]] for help, but after telling the operator that he's a teacher and that another teacher wants to fight him, she hung up after laughing at the situation. After seeking the advice of Holly and Coach Crawford, Campbell resolves to have Strickland removed from the campus before the day's end. As a last resort, Campbell threatens Neil into giving him the drug [[MDMA]]. As Principal Tyler finds his [[Toyota Prius]] vandalized and parked in the school's lobby, Campbell plants the MDMA in Strickland's satchel. Campbell calls the police in the hopes of having Strickland arrested, but the attempt is botched and both teachers are incarcerated. The two teachers share a cell with other inmates, and Campbell goes across the cell and tricks an enormous inmate into giving Strickland a beating, but only when signaled. Campbell then returns to Strickland in order to trick him into giving the signal, but Strickland instead tells Campbell that the fight is called off after everything that they have been through the day. When the inmate nonetheless attacks Strickland, Strickland easily knocks him out, and upon realizing Campbell's actions, declares the fight back on. The two are then released, after the police discover the drug used to frame Strickland was only [[aspirin]].  Campbell heads back to the school to meet up with the school board, Tyler and Superintendent Johnson, but learns that his colleagues have all been fired. Impatient after being told to wait for nearly an hour, Campbell barges into the meeting and learns that he is one of the few to remain at his position. However, Campbell stands his ground and voices his complaints about the public school system not receiving the respect and materials it truly needs. Campbell heads over to Ally's talent show, where Ally's rendition of [[Big Sean]]'s "[[I Don't Fuck with You]]" inspires him to take a stand against Strickland.  In the school parking lot, Campbell and Strickland confront each other, and engage in a heated fight that is dragged throughout the school and sees both men seemingly gaining the upper hand at different moments, and the fight goes throughout the entire school. Campbell briefly knocks Strickland out with a fire extinguisher and celebrates only to be sucker-punched by Strickland after he gets up. Strickland then answers Campbell's phone and learns that Maggie is about to give birth, at which point he decides to drive Campbell to the hospital.  That summer, Tyler arrives at the Campbell household to tell Campbell that the publicity and public outcry the fight generated has put the Department of Education in a position where they need to put more effort and money toward their schools, and must rehire Campbell and Strickland. Campbell accepts on the condition that the rest of his colleagues be reinstated as well. As the new school year begins, the faculty return to their respective positions. Campbell and Strickland, now best friends, are ready to enforce learning with Campbell being much more assertive towards the students.  In a post-credits scene, Crawford is seen flirting with the 911 operator, whom Campbell had called earlier in a failed attempt to stop Strickland, in person. After rapping for her, Crawford realizes that he doesn't know her name.  
First Kill (2017 film)
  Wall Street broker Will Beamon ([[Hayden Christensen]]) has been struggling with being present for his wife Laura (Megan Leonard) and son Danny (Ty Shelton). Shortly after hearing of Danny being bullied at school, Will decides to take his family to his hometown, [[Granville, Ohio]] in order to bond with Danny. Upon entering Granville, Will is reacquainted with Police Chief Marvin Howell ([[Bruce Willis]]), a family friend who at one point dated his aunt, Dottie (Deb G. Girdler). Howell advises Will on taking precaution after informing him of a recent bank robbery. While teaching Danny how to hunt with a rifle, Will and Danny witness a heated exchange between two men, one of them holding the other at gunpoint. The unarmed man ([[Gethin Anthony]]) is shot in the shoulder after throwing a key near Will's position at a shooting station, attracting the gunman's attention. The gunman opens fire on Will, prompting Will to shoot him with his hunting rifle in self-defense. Upon inspecting the gunman, discovers that the gunman was a police officer who failed to identify himself. Distraught, Will brings the wounded man to the family cabin in order for Laura, a hospital nurse, to provide first aid.  Shortly after being treated, the man takes Danny hostage at knife-point, demanding that Will help him retrieve the discarded key in exchange for Danny's freedom. While attempting to retrieve the key at a shooting shack, a uniformed officer, Richie Stechel ([[William DeMeo]]), opens fire on Will and the gunman. The gunman tells Will to meet him at a bulletin board after retrieving the key. After a failed attempt at pursuing his son, Will learns of the gunman's name from Howell as Levi Barrett, and that the deceased officer was Richie's brother, Charlie ([[Shea Buckner]]). Will waits until nightfall to retrieve the key, only to be confronted by Richie. Will successfully subdues Richie, and heads to the bulletin board for further instructions. Meanwhile, Danny bonds with Levi and learns the reasons behind robbing the bank. Howell and the Stechel brothers engineered the heist and intended to use Levi as the fall guy. Levi agreed to the heist in order to financially support Mabel Fantion (Christine Dye), Adele's (Magi Avila) cancer-ridden mother. Levi was supposed to drop off the stolen money at a drop-site, but did not arrive due to fear of the site being compromised with a potential assassin. Howell also deduces Levi's predicament after a uniformed officer investigates Barrett's apartment.  Howell and Will converge on Mabel's hospital bed, with Howell questioning Will. While Howell is distracted with a radio call by an officer, Will receives a map from Mabel revealing the location of the post office where the stolen money was stashed and the location of an underground bunker to make the exchange at. The key is used to unlock the mailbox containing the stolen cash. Will briefly eludes Howell, and is caught again after retrieving the money. Seemingly sympathetic to Will's situation, Howell provides Will transport to the bunker in order to apprehend Levi. Will gives the money to Levi and is reunited with Danny. During this reunion, Richie kidnaps Laura from the family cabin and drives her to Howell's location for leverage.   While attempting to flee, Adele is murdered by Howell. Left with nothing to lose, Levi attacks Howell and Richie only to be wounded. Will takes Danny to a hunter's watchtower, where the latter pushes a pursuing Richie off a ladder to knock him out. Howell holds Laura at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her. Danny retrieves Richie's pistol and attempts to shoot Howell, only for Will to stop him. In an attempt to taunt Will, Howell reveals himself as the person that murdered Will's father years earlier. Levi walks after Howell, only to be shot dead, providing Will the opportunity to shoot Howell in the head.  During the aftermath, Richie is questioned by the rest of the police department, and Mabel was found dead on the hospital bed, presumably murdered by Howell by removing her life support system. The Beamon family returns home to deal with their daily lives.

He meets Mary, who is seeking counseling for her [[Radical environmentalism|radical environmentalist]] husband Michael, which further challenges his beliefs.<ref></ref> Michael explains that he wants Mary to get an abortion, because he does not want to bring a child into a world that [[climate change]] will transform into an irreparable hardship.

Just before their next appointment, Michael sends a text message for Toller to meet him in the park, where Toller finds him dead of a self-inflicted shotgun blast.

Flatliners (2017 film)
  A medical student, Courtney ([[Ellen Page]]), is obsessed with the idea of the afterlife, wanting to find out what happens after death. She invites fellow students Jamie ([[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]]) and Sophia ([[Kiersey Clemons]]) to join her in an experiment, in an unused hospital room: using defibrillation to stop her heart for sixty seconds whilst recording her brain, and then reviving her. She assures them they would not be held responsible for any accidents. Sophia is against this, but Jamie does it anyway. After sixty seconds, they panic as they are unable to revive her, but eventually manage to with the help of fellow student Ray ([[Diego Luna]]). Later, Marlo ([[Nina Dobrev]]), a rival of Ray, arrives and learns of the experiment.  Initially Courtney begins to recall memories of past events such as her grandmother's recipe for bread. Courtney experiences increased intelligence and euphoria, being suddenly able to play the piano after 12 years and answer questions in class perfectly. Envious, Jamie flatlines, but has a disturbing near death experience as he meets his ex-girlfriend. Marlo and Sophia follow suit and flatline, for an increasing number of minutes. During Sophia’s turn they are nearly caught and flee the hospital and arrive at a party. Courtney and Jamie start seeing visions of past mistakes, but do not tell the others.  It soon turns into a living horror as those who flatlined find themselves haunted by their visions: Courtney is haunted by her dead sister Tessa from a car crash she caused because she was using her phone. Jamie is haunted by the baby of his ex-girlfriend whom he got pregnant and begged to get an abortion. Marlo is haunted by a man named Cyrus (who was stung by jellyfish) whom she killed when she accidentally mixed up his medication, and Sophia is haunted by a girl named Irina whose life she ruined out of jealousy by hacking her phone and sending out her nudes. This allowed Sophia to become [[valedictorian]]. They realize there is a downside to flatlining.  The hauntings get more and more intense. Courtney, traumatised by her visions, records a message apologising for the consequences and admitting that her interest in flatlining was due to the death of her sister, not for scientific discovery. Shortly after, she is chased by visions of her dead sister and falls to her death from the fire escape of her apartment building after her sister's ghost appears in front of her and pushes her off. The others are devastated when they learn of Courtney’s death and then panic when they realize they may be implicated if anyone discovers their experiments. After attempting to remove all notes and evidence from Courtney’s apartment, Marlo is sent to the morgue to find Courtney’s phone. She is once again haunted by visions. Meanwhile, on his boat, Jaime again hears the cries of a baby and a woman weeping. He falls out of his boat and swims to the dock where a figure stabs him in his hand.   The group watches Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes that they made and soon come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are their hallucinations because of guilt from their past sins, not paranormal beings. Ray, the only one who didn't flatline, initially disbelieves what's happening.   The group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Later, Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died and she refuses to come clean. Marlo is suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of the patient that died due to her mistake. Ray, Sophia, and Jamie rush to stop her and are successful in resuscitating Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. In the end, Marlo, Ray, Sophia, and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. The movie ends with Jamie proposing a toast, honoring Courtney.

The Foreigner (2017 film)
 Ngoc Minh Quan runs a Chinese restaurant in London with his business partner Lam. When his teenage daughter Fan is killed in a clothing store bombing, he seeks revenge. The bombing is claimed by a group calling itself the "Authentic UDI/IRA". Failing to get the names of the bombers from Scotland Yard, Quan next focuses on the Northern Ireland [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|deputy First Minister]] Liam Hennessy, who speaks publicly about his status as a former UDI (read: [[Provisional IRA|IRA]]) leader while condemning the bombing. Quan eventually leaves for [[Belfast]] and seeks out Hennessy, who claims to have no knowledge of the bombing or its perpetrators. Quan does not believe him and sets off a homemade bomb in Hennessy's office as a threat unless he gets the bombers' names.  Hennessy tries to identify the bombers with help from his contacts, but the rogue members catch on and outwit him. Quan observes Hennessy seeing his mistress, Maggie, and photographs them. Quan then brings the fight to Hennessy, hiding in the woods outside his Belfast farmhouse and attacking it with more explosives. As Hennessy's men attempt to track him in the woods, Quan uses traps to disable them, but is shot in the shoulder and flees. Hennessy decides to send for his nephew Sean, a [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] soldier, after Quan in hopes that his tracking skills can be used to stop Quan for good.  As Quan cauterises the gunshot wound, he has flashbacks of his escape from Vietnam to Singapore by sea, where he and his wife lost their other two daughters to attacking Thai pirates. Hennessy receives files from the British government on Quan's true background: a former [[Vietnam War]] [[Long-range reconnaissance patrol|special operations forces soldier]] who was trained by the [[US Army]].  After a second bombing on a double-decker bus, Hennessy negotiates with British politician Katherine Davies and promises the capture of the bombers in exchange for the pardoning of several of his former UDI comrades. Meanwhile, Hennessy receives intel on the bombers and relays the information to Sean and police. After a knife fight in the woods, Quan captures Sean, who names one of the bombers. Quan then lets Sean go. Hennessy interrogates his head enforcer McGrath, discovering that the true mastermind is Mary, Hennessy's wife, who also hired Maggie, who remains angry at the British for the death of her brother and resents Hennessy's working for them. Hennessy executes McGrath for his betrayal and for involving his wife and mistress, then orders Sean to execute Mary.  As police prepare to raid the bombers' hideout, Quan manages to enter the flat disguised as a handyman and single-handedly kills everyone but Maggie. Quan leaves just before the police raid the apartment and find a severely wounded Maggie. They torture her into disclosing the location of their next bomb, which has been planted in a laptop computer to be detonated on a plane. British police find and throw the laptop into an empty jet bridge, where it detonates without casualties. With the threat resolved, Maggie is executed to prevent any "loose ends". Hennessy gets a call from Davies, who tells him that she has learned of his involvement but that he will retain his position as a politician, though under her thumb.  Quan later confronts Hennessy and shows him the picture of Hennessy kissing Maggie, which is enough to throw public suspicion on Hennessy and his role in the bombings. Quan forces him to post the picture to the internet, telling him that he should be ashamed of himself and that the whole world will know that he is a terrorist. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard realizes Quan's role in the events and has him put under surveillance, but decides not to take any further action as thanks for his assistance.  Quan returns to his restaurant and Lam hugs and kisses him. Quan finally puts the past behind him and begins to heal.

When the brothers commit the taboo act of Human Transmutation to resurrect Trisha after she dies of illness, it backfires and they suffer the consequences via the Law of Equivalent Exchange: Edward loses his left leg, while Alphonse is dragged into the Gate of Truth. Edward then sacrifices his right arm to save his brother's soul and bind it to a suit of armor via a blood seal, later replacing his missing limbs with "automail" prosthetics. Edward later receives an invitation by Colonel Roy Mustang to join the military so he can research a means of restoring Alphonse's body. After becoming a State Alchemist with the title "Fullmetal Alchemist", accompanied by their childhood friend and Automail mechanic Winry Rockwell, Edward begins his quest with Alphonse to find the legendary [[philosopher's stone]] which could repair their bodies.  Years later, Edward and Alphonse confront a cultist named Father Cornello, whom they believe is using a philosopher's stone to recruit the people of Liore. As Mustang arrives to personally handle the situation, Edward exposes Cornello while the stone is revealed to be a fake. After reaching East City and spending the night at the home of Major Maes Hughes and his pregnant wife, the brothers are provided with lodging when Major General Hakuro introduces them to Shou Tucker, a bio-alchemy authority who obtained his State Alchemist credentials by creating a talking chimera. As the brothers become fast friends with the man's young daughter Nina and their dog Alexander, Tucker suggests Edward to find Dr. Tim Marcoh as he created a philosopher's stone prior to going into hiding. Alphonse remains behind to be examined by Tucker, who causes Alphonse to question his existence, while Edward and Winry head to Marcoh's last known whereabouts.  Though Marcoh was murdered by Cornello's benefactor Lust as he and Winry find him, Edward acquires the man's notes and asks Hughes to decipher them while unknowingly alienating Alphonse to keep him safe. Hughes later makes a horrific discovery from his investigation and ends up being killed by Lust's associate Envy, who assumes Mustang's form to frame the colonel for the murder. Edward manages to escape being interrogated with help from Mustang's aide Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, using what he could deduce from the notes to investigate the clandestine Fifth Laboratory. At the same time, after revealing the new talking chimera that he created from Nina and Alexander, Tucker forces Alphonse and Winry to accompany him to the Fifth Laboratory, where they find Edward as he verbally realizes that the Philosopher's Stone is created from humans.  Tucker confirms Edward's realization, justifying their respective actions of selfishly manipulating life before Lust kills him while revealing herself as a homunculus. After Lust cryptically hints of her group's reach in the government and an upcoming event that Edward has a vital role in, Hakuro reveals the Mannequin Soldier homunculi and gets killed when he prematurely activates them. Mustang has Riza and their men keep the Mannequin Soldiers from flooding out of the laboratory while he confronts Lust and Envy, killing the former while ripping her philosopher's stone core from her body. While Mustang gives Edward the stone so he can restore Alphonse, Edward instead uses it to appear before his brother's body and promises to find another way to restore him. Edward then returns to his reality to reaffirm Alphonse's existence to him. Sometime after, as Gluttony mourns Lust's death, Envy is revealed to have survived Mustang's attack but has been diminished to its true parasitic form as a result.

Furious (2017 film)
 Film will tell about [[Golden Horde]] times and the warrior, Ryazan knight [[Evpaty Kolovrat]], leading the squad decides to fight back [[Batu Khan|khan Batu]], who shattered Russia.<ref></ref>  This military tale ([[The Tale of the Destruction of Riazan]]) survived in several sixteenth and the seventeenth century redactions and is thought to be a part of a miscellany that was composed and revised by the clergy of the [[Zaraysk Kremlin|Church of St. Nikholas]] of [[Zaraisk]]. According to the legend, the church is located on the spot where the princess Eupraxy killed herself. Given a form of a military tale, the later version of [[The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan|The Tale of Batu's Capture of Ryazan]] is a fictionalized account with some historical inaccuracies suggesting that the Tale was composed sometimes after the described events and was subsequently further edited. Tracing its provenance, textual analysis, and dating of various redactions have been conclusively resolved by Soviet scholars.  The Tale of the Destruction of [[Ryazan|Riazan]] is one of the most interesting and best written accounts of the invasion of [[Russia]] by the [[Mongols]]: ...Within twelve years after bringing the miraculous icon of St.Nicholas from Kherson, the godless Emperor Batu invaded the Russian land with a great multitude of his Tatar warriors and set up camp on the river Voronezh in the vicinity of the principality of Riazan. And he sent his infidel envoys to the city of Riazan, to Great Prince Yury Ingvarevich, demanding tithes from everyone - from the princes and from all ranks of people.And the Great Prince decided to send his son, Fedor Yurevich, to Batu with many gifts and supplications that he not invade the land of Riazan...  Prince Fedor came to the Emperor Batu... And Batu began to entertain the Riazan Princes, and after this entertainment asked that they send their sisters and daughters to be his concubines. And one envious Riazan courtier told Batu that the wife of Prince Fedor belonged to the Byzantine imperial family and that she had a most beautiful body. Emperor Batu, who was false and merciless, became excited, and told Prince Fedor: "Prince, give me your wife so that I may enjoy her beauty." And Prince Fedor said - "It is not our Christian custom to bring to you, the godless emperor our wives so that your lust may be satisfied. If you conquer us then you will be the ruler of our wives."  The godless Batu felt offended, and became angry. He ordered the immediate death of Prince Fedor, and commanded that his body be thrown in a field where it would be devoured by beasts and birds. And the retinue and the warriors of Prince Fedor were also put to death.  One of the servants of Prince Fedor, by name Aponitsa, managed to escape, and wept bitterly, seeing the body of his master. Having noticed that no one guarded the corpse, he took his beloved master's body and buried it secretly. Then he hurried to Princess Eupraxy and told her that Emperor Batu had killed her husband. At that moment the princess happened to be on the upper floor of the palace with her infant son, Prince Ivan. When she heard from Aponitsa that her husband had been slain, she was seized with grief, and threw herself from the window with the child in her arms. And so both were killed...<ref></ref>  Evpaty and his soldiers return to Riazan, only to find that the Mongols had burned the city and massacred many of its inhabitants, including the defending soldiers, his wife Nastya and their children. He and his men raise the town bell and ring it, summoning the survivors. They hide as a band of Mongols return, and Evpaty kills them all with his two swords. Evpaty leads his men against a blizzard into a forest, and stumble upon a bear and a hermit. The hermit, Nestor, invites them into a cave where they rest for the night and receive herbs.  Evpaty and his soldiers use trickery to frighten and distract the Mongols and allow one of his soldiers to help Lada take several children to safety. He sends three soldiers on horseback to three princes in their cities, but only one accepted their request for help in fighting Batu Khan. He also ensures that the surviving people of his city hide in Nestor's cave. At the same time, his soldiers and Lada struggle to help him remember his current situation to stop him from attacking them.  Evpaty and his soldiers fight Batu Khan's soldiers on a hill, but the Mongols prevail, leaving Evpaty as the last member of his army. The Mongol officer asks Evpaty on his demands. Evpaty goes down from the hill, he shows them a seal that Batu Khan had given to him earlier, causing the Mongols to avoid killing him. Evpaty taunts Batu Khan that now the latter is the one who kneels, and dies from his wounds from being hit by stones thrown by [[trebuchet]]s.  Because he led his warriors to keep fighting the Mongols to the end, Batu Khan orders his soldiers to build a mound to bury Evpaty's body, one that became taller than the hill where he fought the Mongols. Many years later, that hill was used by another Russian prince, who leads a larger army to face an invasion of [[Teutonic Knights]].

Geostorm
 In 2019, following many catastrophic natural disasters, an international coalition commissions a system of [[Weather modification|climate-controlling]] satellites called "Dutch Boy". After Dutch Boy neutralizes a typhoon in Shanghai, a [[United States Senate|Senate]] sub-committee reprimands chief architect Jake Lawson for acting without authorization and replaces him with his brother Max, who works under [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] Leonard Dekkom.  Three years later in 2022, a [[United Nations|UN]] team stationed in the [[Registan Desert]] comes across a frozen village. As suspicions rise about the event being caused by Dutch Boy malfunction, the US government decides to send one person to find and fix the system. Later, Makmoud Habib, an Indian engineer working on the International Climate Space Station (ICSS) is shown as copying data from the [[Afghanistan]] satellite onto an external storage device. Habib stores the same in his station locker, but is unexpectedly ejected into space and killed, right after. After convincing President Andrew Palma to conduct an investigation, Max persuades Jake to go to the ICSS to investigate. Another satellite increases temperatures in [[Hong Kong]], causing a [[Fire whirl|firenado]] that nearly kills Max's college friend Cheng Long, the head of Dutch Boy's Hong Kong department.  Jake arrives at ICSS to examine the malfunctioning satellites (which are damaged afterwards and their data erased) with station commander Ute Fassbinder and her crew. Outside the ICSS, they retrieve the hard drive, but hide it from the crew, suspecting a traitor, and recover the data, discovering that a [[Computer virus|virus]] has wiped out everyone's login access to the satellite and is causing the malfunctions. Suspecting Palma is using Dutch Boy as a weapon, Jake tells Max he needs to reboot the system, which requires the kill code, held by Palma. The ICSS staff neutralize malfunctioning satellites by deliberately knocking them offline via collisions with replacement satellites.  Back on Earth, Cheng discovers he and Max have lost login access and warns Max of a global cataclysm known as a "Geostorm" if the malfunction continues. Cheng is pursued to [[Washington, D.C.]] by a team of rogue government agents, who ultimately cause his death in a traffic incident, but not before he says "Zeus". Discovering Project Zeus simulates extreme weather patterns to create a Geostorm, Max enlists his girlfriend, [[US Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Sarah Wilson, to acquire the code.  During the [[Democratic National Convention]] at the Moxley Arena in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Max discovers Orlando is next to be targeted after a massive hailstorm hits [[Tokyo]] and part of [[Rio de Janeiro]] freezes over.   The ICSS team loses control of all operations as the virus initiates the self-destruct program. As more disasters strike around the world (including tornadoes in [[Mumbai]], a heatwave in [[Moscow]] and a tsunami in [[Dubai]]), Jake realizes software engineer Duncan is the traitor. In the ensuing confrontation, Duncan accidentally ejects himself into space while Jake escapes. As the crew evacuates, Jake stays behind to ensure the reboot completes.   Max requests Dekkom's help, but Dekkom instead tries unsuccessfully to kill Max, unveiling himself as the saboteur; Max immediately informs Sarah. The two kidnap Palma to protect him from Dekkom's agents and secure the kill code, which is Palma's biometrics. As they escape from the DNC stadium before a lightning storm destroys it, Max reveals their activities and Dekkom's treachery to Palma. After outsmarting Dekkom's mercenaries, the three arrest and confront Dekkom about his intentions: to decimate the other elected officials in America's [[United States presidential line of succession|line of succession]], giving him the chance to dominate the world. Max and Sarah escort Palma to the [[Kennedy Space Center]], where they transmit the code but learn that the self-destruct sequence can't be stopped.  Jake and Ute, who also stayed behind, work together to reboot the system, transferring satellite control to the world's space agencies and preventing the Geostorm at the last second. The two take shelter in a replacement satellite as the self-destruction sequence completes and use its thrusters as a beacon. A nearby shuttle piloted by crew member Hernandez picks them up. Six months later, Jake works as the head engineer for a new system of satellites, which is now administered by an international committee.

Chris witnesses strange behavior from the estate's black workers, housekeeper Georgina and groundskeeper Walter.  Unable to sleep, Chris goes outside to smoke and sees Walter sprinting through the grounds while Georgina prowls the house. Missy talks Chris into a hypnotherapy session, ostensibly to cure his smoking addiction. In a trance, he recounts the death of his mother in a [[Hit and run|hit-and-run]] when he was a child, about which he feels guilty, and sinks into a void Missy calls the "sunken place". He awakens believing he had a nightmare but realizes cigarettes now revolt him. Walter confirms that Chris was in Missy's office. Georgina unplugs his phone, draining his battery, though she claims it was an accident.  Dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together. They take an interest in Chris, admiring his physique or expressing admiration for black figures such as [[Tiger Woods]]. Jim Hudson, a blind art dealer, takes particular interest in Chris's photography skills. Chris meets another black man, Logan King, who acts strangely and is married to a much older white woman.  Chris calls his friend, a black [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] agent named Rod Williams, about the hypnosis and the strange behavior at the house. Chris tries to inconspicuously photograph Logan with his phone to send to Rod, but his flash goes off; Logan becomes hysterical, yelling at Chris to "get out". The others restrain him and Dean claims Logan had an [[epileptic seizure]]. Away from the house, Chris persuades Rose that they should leave, while Dean holds an auction with a photo of Chris, which Jim Hudson wins. Chris sends the photo of Logan to Rod; Rod recognizes Logan as Andre Hayworth, who has been missing for months. Suspecting a conspiracy, Rod goes to the police, but they deride him.  While he packs to leave, Chris finds photos of Rose in prior relationships with black men, contradicting her claim that Chris is her first black boyfriend; the collection also includes pictures of Rose with Walter and Georgina. Chris is blocked from leaving the estate by the Armitage family, including Rose. He tries to attack Jeremy, but Missy hypnotizes him into unconsciousness. He awakens strapped to a chair in the basement. A video presentation featuring Rose's grandfather Roman explains that the family transplants the brains of white people into black bodies; the consciousness of the host remains in the "sunken place", watching what is happening but powerless to change anything. Hudson tells Chris he wants his body so he can gain Chris's sight and artistic talents.  Chris plugs his ears with cotton stuffing pulled from the chair, blocking the hypnosis. When Jeremy comes to collect him for the surgery, Chris bludgeons him with a [[croquet]] ball and impales Dean on the antlers of a deer mount. After fatally stabbing Missy and beating Jeremy to death, he drives away in Jeremy's car, but hits Georgina. Remembering his own mother's death, he carries Georgina into the car, but she is possessed by Rose's grandmother Marianne; she attacks him and he crashes, killing her. An armed Rose apprehends him with Walter, who is possessed by Roman. Chris awakens Walter with his phone flash. Walter takes Rose's rifle and shoots her and then himself. Wounded, Rose attempts to shoot Chris; Chris begins to strangle her but stops. Rod arrives in a TSA car and rescues Chris, leaving Rose to bleed to death in the road as Chris and Rod leave.

Georgettan's Pooram
 P. V. Mathayyi was a participant in the [[1990 Asian Games]] in [[Beijing]]. After [[Indian Kabaddi Team (men's division)|India]] beat [[Bangladesh national kabaddi team|Bangladesh]], P.V Mathayyi rose to prominence as one of the first [[Malayalis]], from the district of [[Thrissur district|Thrissur]] to win a gold medal at the Asian Games. When the Games ended, Mathayyi was welcomed back wholeheartedly by the rest of the people in his area. He gifted the youth of the place a ground and a sports club, which the people named Mathayyiparambu. However, the happiness was short-lived, after Mathayyi was killed in a road accident. The people built a statue in his honour in Mathayyiparambu, but soon afterwards, the people forgot the ground's initial use as a sports ground, and the place became a place for the youth to loiter around and play football.  Vava, Thankan and Pallan are three boys who loiter around on Mathayyiparambu. Their parents are annoyed and Vava's father ([[Sunil Sukhada]]) tells Fr. Mathews Vadakkan ([[Renji Panicker]]), a local [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church|Mar Thoma]] priest to set them on the right path and he grants his son George this responsibility. After class one day, the three boys find George peeping through the bathroom, and catch him doing this. After this incident, they say that George is their leader and is one of them.  Years later, George ([[Dileep]]), Vava ([[Vinay Forrt]]), Pallan ([[Sharaf U Dheen]]) and Thankan (Thiru Aftab) are still loitering around the ground doing nothing. They have a small gathering on top of a small tower in Mathayyiparambu, where Joseph ([[T.G Ravi]]), a local beggar who takes only Rs. 10 from the [[poor box]] near Jesus' statue and from George, welcomes them like his own children. Fr. Vadakkan is disappointed in his son George and wants him to become a bishop. George tries to impress his father by doing various things in the community, but each activity ends in disaster.  Later, two people come and ask for the gang's permission of starting a [[driving school]] in Mathayyiparambu. Although at first reluctant, they agree immediately when the two explain that it is a ladies' driving school. However, they are disappointed when they see old women in the school. Then they hear the sad news of the death of a local [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] and a funeral is held by his son Simon ([[Sudheer Karamana]]). There, George meets Merlin ([[Rajisha Vijayan]]), a singer, and instantly falls in love. He is disappointed at the fact that he doesn't know anything about her, not even her name (he didn't find this out). Him and his friends decide to go to their house the next day to find out anything about her, but this ends in disaster.  The next day, Vava explains that he has a proposal. George and his friends decide to go with him, but he drops off his brother Jose (Jeevan Gopal) at the local [[convent school]], as their father now wants Jose to become a bishop, much to George's delight. There George plays a game of [[carroms]] against Kichu ([[Ganapathi (actor)|Ganapathi]]), places a bet of Rs. 2000 but loses the bet. After, he goes with Vava to the marriage proposal and George takes Rs. 2000 from the girl's dad and gives it to Kichu, angering the dad. He cancels the proposal between the two.  George goes and decides to stop the driving school at Mathayyiparambu, as he is disappointed at the fact that there are only old women coming. Right afterwards Merlin comes, and George decides to let the driving school carry on. The driving school teacher tells George that she is going to become a [[nun]] which her mother insisted, as she said that she doesn't have the three qualities a girl needs to have: desire, wish and love. George finds her desiring for and eating a [[Phyllanthus emblica|nellikka]], and tells her that he has proven she has one of the three qualities. George, after joining a class at the convent school, is saved by Merlin after a priest asks him questions. George understands this and tells her that he has proven the second of the three qualities, as she saved him in front of the priest.  As they leave the convent school, the gang meet a bunch of youths smoking [[cannabis|weed]] outside. George gets angry over this and starts a fight. As George beats up the last person, his father Fr. Vadakkan slaps him, as Fr. Vadakkan is disappointed even more in him. He goes to Mathayyiparambu, but unexpectedly, his mother Mercykutty ([[Kalaranjini]]) comes to visit him. She suggests to George that he should never enter the house.  The next day, the locals gather to find some construction on Mathayyiparambu. George and his gang go and find Peter Mathayyi ([[Chemban Vinod Jose]]), who explains that he is the son of P.V Mathayyi and that Mathayiparambu is his. They go to Fr. Vadakkan's church and fight the case out there with the priest, where Peter seems to be favored. In retaliation, George and his gang decide to set up a stray dog conservation scheme on Mathayyiparambu, which ends in disaster, ruining George's name in the land. Peter then meets George and [[confidence trick|attempts to gain George's trust]] by saying that he is ready to give Mathayyiparambu away and leave it to waste. George is saddened and says that he is ready to accept any of Peter's demands. Peter suggests that they start a [[kabaddi]] team, which George accepts.  
Gerald's Game (film)
  Jessie and Gerald arrive at an isolated lake house in Fairhope, Alabama, for some time away. While Gerald takes [[Viagra]], Jessie feeds a stray dog outside, but when re-entering the house notices the door is left ajar. Jessie changes into a new night dress, placing the tag on a shelf above the bed, and practices sexy poses. Gerald takes a second Viagra and leaves his glass of water on the same shelf. He restrains Jessie with one handcuff on each wrist locked to the bedposts; she seems a bit surprised by this, but goes along. He begins to enact a stranger rape fantasy, telling her to scream for help, knowing no one will hear. She half heartedly plays along but soon becomes uncomfortable, telling him to stop and uncuff her; he replies, "What if I won't?" After a heated argument where he accuses her of not even trying to rekindle their relationship, Gerald dies of a heart attack, falling onto the floor, leaving Jessie in handcuffs.  The dog enters and Jessie tries to scare it away, but it bites a chunk out of Gerald's arm and eats it. Gerald stands up and begins talking, but Jessie notices his body remains on the floor. He taunts Jessie about the truths of their strained marriage and his erectile dysfunctions. He then informs her that she has wasted hours already doing nothing, and she is beginning to suffer from de-hydration and fatigue. Jessie miraculously pulls a hand out of a cuff and breaks free. She gloats to Gerald, but then turns around and tells herself, the one still trapped, that it is easy to escape. Gerald and the self-assured Jessie tell things about herself and Gerald that she never had the courage to acknowledge. They trigger her to remember the glass of water above the bed, which she is able to reach but cannot bring all the way to her mouth. The hallucinations remind her of the tag she put on the shelf, which she rolls into a straw in order to reach the water.  Jessie falls asleep, wakes up in the dark, and sees a tall, deformed, obscured figure who reveals a bag of various bones and trinkets. She closes her eyes saying "You're not real." But Gerald appears to say that the figure is Death waiting to take her. Gerald begins to call Jessie "Mouse", which unsettles her. This triggers a memory of her father, Tom, who affectionately referred to her as "Mouse." She is 12 years old, vacationing at a lake house with her family. As Jessie and her father sit alone outside to watch a solar eclipse, he suggests she sit on his lap, as she did when she was younger. Once on his lap, he masturbates. The handcuffed Jessie awakes to intense pain due to her circulation being cut off and cramping. Gerald and the confident Jessie are skeptical about her claims that she dealt with the pressure of keeping such a secret, and her claims that it had nothing to do with her marriage, even though she married a man just like her father. Gerald teases Jessie about the disfigured man she saw, whom he calls "the man made of moonlight", and points out what he suspects is a bloody footprint on the floor. After the eclipse, her father tells her he was ashamed of what he did, and manipulates her into agreeing never to tell anyone.  Jessie remembers cutting her hand that night, when she squeezed a glass too hard when her mother asked her about the eclipse. The adult Jessie smashes the water glass and cuts her wrist in a way that enables her to peel back the skin, allowing her bloody hand to slip through the cuff. She drags the bed to the key, unlocking her other hand. She drinks water and bandages herself, but then passes out on the floor from blood loss and fatigue. When she wakes, the "man made of moonlight" is at the end of the hall, and she gives him her wedding ring for his trinket bag. She makes to her car and drives away, but sees the man again in the back seat.  The car crashes into a tree, but people from a nearby house come out.  Six months later, Jessie is writing a letter to her 12-year-old self, struggling to write with her hand that needed skin grafts. Voice-overs and scenes describe how she had pretended to have amnesia over the whole ordeal of being trapped, avoiding painful questions. She used some of Gerald's life insurance to start a foundation for victims of sexual abuse. But each night the "man made of moonlight" still appears before her as she falls asleep. Her wedding ring was never found in the house, and she learned from the news that a man who has [[acromegaly]], causing disfiguration of his head, is a serial killer who dug up crypts, stealing bones and jewels, and occasionally eating the faces of male corpses. This explains why he did not harm Jessie in the house and also why Gerald's face was disfigured. Jessie arrives at court as the moonlight man is being sentenced, and calls for his attention. Seeing also Gerald's and Tom's face where his face is, she says "You're so much smaller than I remember", and walks triumphantly out into the street with the sunlight gleaming down on her.  
A Gentleman
 Gaurav Kapoor ([[Sidharth Malhotra]]), based in suburban [[Miami]], plans to get hitched to his colleague Kavya ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]), who happens to be the woman of his dreams, but she prefers a man who is more adventurous and risk-loving. Parallel to the same runs the story of clandestine spy Rishi Purohit ([[Sidharth Malhotra]]), who is seen to have been trying to extract some crucial substance from the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok. However, when a co-spy, Yakub ([[Darshan Kumaar]]), shoots down an innocent civilian, the dishonest move enrages Rishi. Nonetheless, he returns to Mumbai, where it is revealed that he works for Unit X, a spy organisation headed by Colonel Vijay Saxena ([[Suniel Shetty]]). Rishi explains to Col. Vijay that he can't continue with such routines, and that he wants to start life afresh. Col. Vijay asks him to perform one last job for him, and this involves spying on a minister who Col. Vijay claims to be corrupted and wants to blackmail, and copying data from his cellphone into a hard drive which is wanted by Col. Vijay. Rishi does save contents into the hard drive, but Col. Vijay, thinking that Rishi is useless, instructs Yakub through a text message to kill him. However, Rishi senses the suspicion, and fights off Yakub and other co-spies. Yakub manages to shoot him, but Rishi disappears.  Gaurav, in the meantime, tries to hang out with Kavya on a date, and also meets her parents, who consider getting him married to Kavya. Meanwhile, he is ordered by his boss to visit Mumbai to crack a business consignment. Rewinding to Rishi's life, it is shown that he is intercepted by some security officers, one of whom happens to be a man named Gaurav Kapoor, who works in a cyber firm in Mumbai, and has important data about the minister's connections. Rishi decides to move away, and impersonates Gaurav, who has been killed in an accident. A chain of events soon ends up revealing that Gaurav is in fact Rishi himself, and that he switched to Gaurav's identity to live a peaceful life and have a decent yet beautiful family.  Gaurav is soon attacked by some goons who happen to be potential sleeper agents for Unit X, and hides the body of one of them in his car, which is noticed by his friend Dixit, who tries to bail him out of the trouble that ensues. Finally, Yakub and other Unit X agents track Gaurav down, and confront him, where he finally confesses, as Rishi, that he needed a life, but he is knocked down unconscious, and soon finds himself tied to the floor with Kavya. However, Gaurav uses his skills to evict Kavya from the trouble, and succeeds eventually, but ultimately ends up confessing to her that he is a retired spy officer. Kavya berates him, but takes pity on him when she notices blood wounds over his stomach. The two share a kiss and soon find themselves under fire after Unit X agents, headed by Yakub, raid the hotel they are staying in. Rishi hatches a quick scheme to retrieve the data, since the hard drive is damaged, and convinces Yakub that it would be their very last mission.  Rishi executes the heist with success, but security officers take notice of it all and begin chasing Rishi, and Yakub backfires on him by aborting the operation. They meet at Rishi's House, where Rishi kills most of Yakub's henchmen with the help of Kavya. However, Rishi spares Yakub and two of his thugs and orders him to leave in his car. Yakub soon realizes that the hard drive Rishi sent is void, and the car dickey contains the corpse of Koko, the henchman sent earlier by Jignesh to kidnap Rishi. They end up being confronted by local Police after an overspeeding Dixit wrecks their car in a [[side collision]], whereupon they discover the corpse and Yakub and his thugs are killed by the cops as they open fire. Col. Vijay raids his hideout, but is killed in a premeditated explosion planned by Rishi. This renders Unit X futile, and Rishi and Kavya soon head on as Hemant and Pooja Khanna, a rank couple whose passports are stolen by Rishi.  A mid-credit scene shows Gaurav's friend, Dixit, buying some machine guns from a local gun store in Miami, before putting on a [[hoodie]] and walking away.

Get the Girl (film)
   Clarence is an awkward young man who is in love with a bartender named Alex. Despite visiting the bar multiple times, and an awkward encounter, Alex doesn’t really seem to notice him, partly due to preoccupation with her ongoing divorce proceedings. In order to get her attention, Clarence enlists the help of Patrick, a patron of another bar who seems to be able to get any woman he wants. After Patrick beats Clarence at an expensive game of pool, Patrick becomes interested in helping when Clarence offers him bigger money. Clarence appears to be very wealthy – he drives a fancy car and mentions that his last name is Duffield, indicating that Clarence is from a wealthy, well-known family. Patrick agrees to help him win over the girl. His plan is extreme – for $25,000, Patrick and others will kidnap Alex, and Clarence will rescue her. The experience will supposedly make Alex fall in love with Clarence.   After leaving the bar one night and walking through the parking garage, Alex gets a text from her husband saying he will agree to sign the divorce papers. After realizing the papers are not in her bag, Clarence nearly runs over her while backing out of his parking space. Just then, a black van pulls up. A group of people in masks, one of them Patrick, abducts Clarence and Alex.   The kidnappers go to Clarence’s residence, a large mansion. An alarm is set off when the kidnappers enter, but Clarence disarms it. Jade, Patrick’s girlfriend, and another kidnapper take Alex upstairs. While alone briefly, Clarence asks Patrick why he’s using a device to disguise his voice. Patrick says it’s for anonymity.   While Jade and another kidnapper are distracted, Alex runs and tries to escape. While trying to recapture her, one of the kidnappers is killed by Alex with a pair of scissors. After Alex is recaptured, Clarence and Patrick renegotiate, and Patrick raises his price to $75,000. Alex escapes from her room a second time and tries to climb down one of balconies of the mansion. She is startled by one of the kidnappers, falls to the ground, and is knocked out.   While the kidnapper takes Alex back inside the house, a police officer shows up at the mansion; the security company called about the alarm, but no one answered. Clarence, Patrick, Jade, and KJ try to play it cool with the police officer. At the same time, the kidnapper watching Alex (who has woken up) accidentally reveals his real name, Carl, to her. An argument ensues and Carl yells and becomes violent. Alex screams. The officer hears the commotion, but Patrick quickly pulls his gun on the officer. Clarence runs back inside and finds Carl smothering Alex. Outside, Patrick shoots and kills the officer. Inside the house, Clarence shoots and kills Carl. Alex is relieved that Clarence has saved her life, but Patrick comes in, beats up Clarence, and drags him downstairs. They argue, and Patrick shoots Clarence in the arm and raises his price to $100,000.   Patrick orders KJ, one of the kidnappers, to start cleaning up the around the house and move the bodies to the van. In order to calm Jade, who is disturbed by all the violence, Patrick gives her an engagement ring. Jade’s fear turns to happiness. KJ finds an AR-15 rifle in the trunk of the police car.   Tired and frustrated, Patrick demands the money. Clarence takes Patrick back behind the mansion where he shows him a locked briefcase at the bottom of the pool. When Clarence admits the briefcase has been there all night, Patrick realizes that there is only $25,000 in it. He pushes Clarence into the pool to retrieve the briefcase. At the same time, KJ goes to the kitchen to look for cleaning products, but finds all the drawers and cabinets empty. He goes to the garage and finds a Toyota car, and inside, a rental ad for the mansion and an insurance document listing Clarence’s last name as “Clark,” not “Duffield.”    Upstairs, Alex recognizes Jade’s engagement ring. Outside, Clarence gets the briefcase but pulls Patrick into the pool as he is getting out and runs around towards the front of the house. KJ comes out to the back yard and informs Patrick that Clarence isn’t who he says he is. Patrick instructs KJ to go to the front of the house to find Clarence.   Patrick goes back inside the house with the briefcase, without his mask on, and is confronted by Jade and Alex. Patrick is Alex’s husband; Alex realized that he was one of the kidnappers when she saw Jade’s ring, which is actually Alex’s wedding ring. KJ radios Patrick that the tires on their van have been slashed (Clarence slashed them). Patrick shoots and kills Jade, and Alex runs into the backyard. KJ tries to shoot her but misses. He goes back inside as Clarence, off screen, calls the police and cuts the power to the house. Patrick and Alex fight at the front of the house and Alex is shot in the leg. She runs back inside the house. KJ and Clarence find each other in the kitchen and struggle, but Clarence gets away, taking a knife with him. Clarence and Alex then find each other and kiss passionately. After he and Alex hide briefly, Clarence pushes KJ down a flight of stairs. KJ accidentally shoots and kills himself with the AR-15.   Now downstairs, Clarence takes the AR-15 from KJ, and Alex takes KJ’s handgun. Patrick finds them and a brief gunfight ensues. The AR-15 finally runs out of bullets, and the three of them are in a standoff: Patrick, holding a gun and the briefcase, Alex, holding a gun, and Clarence, holding only a knife. Patrick has realized not only that Clarence lied about who he is, but that he actually knew who Patrick was the entire time. Clarence reveals that he saw Patrick and Alex when they were happily married and saw their marriage crumble. He also figured out why Patrick would not divorce Alex – he wanted the money Alex inherited from her grandmother. Clarence knew that Patrick would jump at an opportunity to kill Alex and get her inheritance. Just as Patrick is about to shoot Alex, Alex shoots him. Patrick drops his gun. Clarence tells him to open the briefcase. Inside is not money, but Alex’s divorce papers. Clarence gives Patrick two choices: sign the divorce papers, or Alex will decide what happens to him. Patrick signs them.   Patrick walks out the front door as police start to arrive. Alex is both stunned and puzzled, as Clarence doesn’t really even know her, but Clarence tells her that he loves her. He explains that after her marriage went bad, he saw her guarding herself from ever being loved again. “So you almost killed me to show me that I’m alive?” she asks. Clarence responds, somewhat embarrassed “Yeah, something like that.” With the police outside Clarence gives Alex two options: shoot him, since he deserves it for everything that he put her through, or, let the police arrest him. But he tells her to promise him that she is going to live her life knowing that she deserves to be happy. Alex replies neither of those options are positive for him, but Clarence doesn’t feel he deserves a positive option. Alex then asks what option three would be; to her there must be an option three. Clarence replies “Well, if there’s an option three, I guess it’d have to be…” as the screen goes to black.  
Ghost in the Shell (2017 film)
 In the near future, humans are [[Human enhancement|augmented]] with cybernetic improvements to traits such as vision, strength, and intelligence. Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or "shell", that can [[Brain–computer interface|integrate]] a human brain rather than an [[artificial intelligence|AI]]. Mira Killian, the sole survivor of a [[cyberterrorist]] attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer, Dr. Ouelet, Hanka CEO Cutter decides to use Killian as a [[counter-terrorism]] operative.  A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau [[Section 9]], working alongside operatives [[Batou]] and [[Togusa]] under [[Daisuke Aramaki|Chief Daisuke Aramaki]]. Killian, who experiences hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as [[glitch]]es, is troubled by how little she remembers of her past.  The team thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a robotic [[geisha]] after it murders a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity known as [[Hideo Kuze|Kuze]], Killian breaks protocol and "dives" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. They trace the hacker to a [[yakuza]] nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The explosion destroys Batou's eyes and damages Killian's body. Cutter is enraged by Killian's actions, and threatens to have Section 9 shut down unless Aramaki keeps her in line.  Kuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers and realize that Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet. Batou, now with [[Visual prosthesis|cybernetic eyes]], kills one while the repaired Killian subdues the other. While they interrogate the worker, Kuze speaks through him before compelling him to commit suicide. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers a large number of humans mentally linked as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured and Kuze reveals that he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian. He urges her to question her own memories, then frees her and escapes.  Killian confronts Ouelet, who admits that 98 test subjects died before Killian, and that her memories are [[Memory implantation|implanted]]. Cutter has decided that Killian is a liability and orders Ouelet to kill her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated.  Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter, [[Motoko Kusanagi]], ran away from home a year ago and was arrested. Motoko took her own life while in custody. Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who allows Cutter to remotely eavesdrop on their conversation. Batou, Togusa, and Aramaki eliminate Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. There, she and Kuze meet and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka as test subjects.  Cutter deploys a "spider-tank" to kill them. Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear off the tank's motor, losing an arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze offers to merge his "ghost" with Killian's, but Killian refuses. Kuze fades out, then a Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, Killian, now repaired and embracing her true [[Identity (social science)|identity]] as the Japanese Motoko, reconnects with her mother and returns to work with Section 9.  
Gifted (film)
 In a small town near [[Tampa, Florida]], seven-year-old Mary Adler lives with uncle and ''[[de facto]]'' guardian, Frank. Her best friend is her 40-ish neighbor, Roberta. On her first day of first grade, she shows remarkable mathematical talent, which impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson. There, despite her initial disdain for average children her own age and her boredom with their classwork, she begins to bond with them when she brings her one-eyed cat, Fred, for [[Show and tell (education)|show-and-tell]] and later defends a classmate from a bully on the bus. Mary is offered a scholarship to a private school for [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] children. However, Frank turns it down. Based on his family's experiences with similar schools, he fears Mary will not have a chance at a "normal" childhood.  It emerges that Mary's mother, Diane, had been a promising mathematician, dedicated to the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness|Navier–Stokes problem]] (one of the unsolved [[Millennium Prize Problems]]) before taking her own life when Mary was six months old. Mary has lived with Frank, a former college [[professor]] turned boat repairman, ever since.  Frank's estranged mother and Mary's maternal grandmother, Evelyn, seeks to gain custody of Mary and move her to [[Massachusetts]], believing that Mary is a "one-in-a-billion" mathematical prodigy who should be specially tutored in preparation for a life devoted to mathematics, much as Diane was. However, Frank is adamant that his sister would want Mary to be in a normal public school and have the childhood she didn't have. Worried that the judge will rule against him and he will lose Mary completely, Frank accepts a compromise brokered by his lawyer Greg Cullen that sees Mary placed in foster care and attend the private school where Evelyn wants to have her enrolled. The foster parents live just 25 minutes from Frank's home, Frank will be entitled to scheduled visits, and Mary will be able to decide where she wants to live after her 12th birthday.  Mary is devastated at being placed in foster care, and her foster father says she refuses to see Frank. When Bonnie sees a picture of Fred up for adoption, she alerts Frank. Frank retrieves the cat from the pound and, learning that Fred was brought in due to allergy issues, realizes that Evelyn—who is [[allergy|allergic]] to cats—is overseeing Mary's education in the guest house of Mary's foster home. He then reveals to Evelyn—who had been a mathematician herself—that Diane ''had'' solved the Navier–Stokes problem, but stipulated that the solution was to be withheld until Evelyn's death. Knowing that it meant everything to Evelyn to see Diane solve the problem, Frank offers to publish Diane's work if Evelyn drops her objection to him having custody of Mary. Evelyn reluctantly agrees.  The film ends with Mary back in the custody of Frank, returning to public school while taking college-level courses in the mornings.  
The Ghazi Attack
 The [[Indian Navy]] decodes a secret code sent from [[Pakistan]] to then-[[East Pakistan]] (modern-day [[Bangladesh]]) and intelligence report of a Pakistan Navy's submarine called [[PNS Ghazi|PNS ''Ghazi'']], a much more advanced submarine than ''[[INS Karanj (S21)|S21]]'' or any other Indian submarine, being sent through the [[Bay of Bengal]] under the command of [[Commander (rank)|Cdr.]] Razak Khan ([[Rahul Singh (actor)|Rahul Singh]]). The top command dispatches ''S21'', a submarine, under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Capt.]] Ranvijay Singh ([[Kay Kay Menon]]) for surveillance. To temper Singh's belligerent tendencies, the Indian Navy Admiral assigns [[Lieutenant commander (Royal Navy)|Lt. Commander]] Arjun Varma ([[Rana Daggubati]]), with orders to ensure that Singh does not confront any Pakistani warships and trigger a war.   ''Ghazi'' blasts a merchant ship to divert attention of the Indian Navy, that has been sent to sink the sole Indian air-craft carrier, [[INS Vikrant (R11)|INS ''Vikrant'']]. Arjun saves a girl child and a woman ([[Taapsee Pannu]]), who are [[Bangladeshis|Bangladeshi]] refugees. During surveillance, ''S21'' acquires a sonar signal of ''Ghazi''.   Singh believes that they should track down ''Ghazi'' and attack, while Arjun obstructs. Singh then orders the ship's [[Executive officer|XO]], Santosh Devraj ([[Atul Kulkarni]]) to conduct a drill and target ''Ghazi'' while doing so. They miss their target narrowly and in the process alert ''Ghazi'' of their presence. Razak, orders his crew to head towards [[Visakhapatnam Port]] at full speed and to set up [[Naval mine|mines]] en-route so that ''S21'' is destroyed in their pursuit.  ''S21'' pursues ''Ghazi's'' path and realizes at the last moment that it is headed into mines. It tries to change its course but a mine explodes and damages most of the batteries, propellers and circuits and the compartment with the front torpedoes gets flooded. Singh dies while trying to save Arjun as ''S21'' sinks to the sea-bed.   Meanwhile, Arjun, who by now is in charge of the mission, regroup and work towards reviving ''S21''. The crew notices that the ship is incapable of moving in any direction, except up or down. Since they cannot chase ''Ghazi'', the crew artificially triggers a one of the naval mines in its vicinity to make ''Ghazi'' return. Razak, sensing that ''Ghazi'' could be walking into a trap, diverts the ship's path and starts attacking ''S21''.   Six torpedoes fired by ''Ghazi'' are avoided by S21 through depth changing maneuvers. S21 dives to 350m so that it is no longer within Ghazi's sonar range despite being designed for a maximum of 250m depth. With very limited battery support, Arjun instigates Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing '[[Saare Jahaan Se Achcha|Saare Jahaan se Achchha]]' and the [[Indian National Anthem]]. Riled up by ''S21's'' defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on ''S21'', for which Ghazi will have to turn by 180 degrees. Arjun, dives into the flooded compartment to manually trigger the torpedoes and successfully triggers a torpedo. ''Ghazi'' also launches its torpedo at the same time. The Ghazi torpedo misses ''S21'' narrowly, but it is hit by an ''S21'' torpedo and disintegrates in water. Arjun is later saved alive from the flooded compartment.

Ghost Stories (film)
 In 1979, Phillip Goodman's strict Jewish father threw his sister out of the family for dating a [[South Asia]]n man. As an adult, Goodman is lonely and single; he is also a well-known professor and television presenter whose show is devoted to debunking fraudulent [[psychics]], which he regards as his life's work in order to stop people's lives being ruined by superstition the way his family's were. He receives an invitation to visit a famed 1970s [[Ghost hunting|paranormal investigator]], Charles Cameron, who inspired him as a boy, but who has been missing for decades and is now living  in a caravan, sick and impoverished. The old man asks him to investigate three incidents of supposedly real supernatural ghost sightings.  The first case is a night watchman, Tony Matthews, whose wife has died of cancer and who feels guilty that he stopped visiting his daughter, who suffers from [[locked-in syndrome]]. He was haunted by the spirit of a young girl while working in a disused [[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]] for women. The second is a teenager, Simon Rifkind, who is obsessed with the [[occult]] and has a poor relationship with his parents. His car breaks down after running over the [[Devil]] in the woods. Goodman, although unsettled by the second case, believes that each of them has an obvious rational explanation: the supposed victims imagined them, based on their own neuroses. The third case is a [[Investor#Role of the financier|financier]] in the [[City of London|City]], Mike Priddle, who was plagued by a [[poltergeist]] while awaiting the birth of his child. His wife's ghost appeared to him as she died giving birth to an (it is implied) inhuman child. The financier commits suicide with a shotgun while talking to Goodman.  Goodman returns to the 1970s investigator, who tears a [[latex]] mask off of his face, revealing himself to be Priddle. Goodman at first believes that he is the victim of an elaborate hoax, but reality soon breaks down altogether. Priddle leads Goodman back in time to the scene of a childhood incident in which he watched two bullies entice a mentally handicapped boy into a drain, where he died of an [[Asthma#Signs and symptoms|asthma attack]]. Goodman has felt guilty all his life about his failure to rescue the victim. The decaying corpse of the bullied boy appears, tormenting Goodman and leading him to a hospital bed, where he is made to lie down. The ghoul lies on top of him and forces his finger into Goodman's mouth as Goodman cries "no, not again", implying this is a recurring event.  In the real world, Goodman is [[Coma|comatose]] in hospital with tubes in his mouth. He suffers from locked-in syndrome after a failed suicide attempt in his car. All the characters and events Goodman has experienced were inspired by the staff and objects in his hospital room. The doctors incorrectly believe that his [[persistent vegetative state]] allows him no awareness of his surroundings. The senior doctor predicts that Goodman is "here for the duration", without chance of recovery, and as he leaves the room says to his junior colleague, "I hope his dreams are sweet".

Nevertheless, when Dina sees Stewart at their hotel, she threatens him with a broken bottle, resulting in her getting ejected and banned from the hotel.

The girls decide to go to a club to dance off the absinthe where they run into Simone and her friends and have a dance off before getting in a bar fight. They are rescued by Julian, who picks them up before they can get arrested and takes them back to their hotel.  Ryan and Stewart are offered a massive deal from the chain store Best Mart, whose representative wants to hire them as spokespeople. Ryan goes out to celebrate with the girls, going to one of Julian's shows. While there Simone shows up and tells Sasha that she is pregnant and that Stewart has stopped returning her calls. She offers to give Sasha's blog exclusive content to her affair with pictures as well. Stewart once again goes to Ryan to convince her to stay with him to finalize their deal. Nevertheless, Simone goes public, and when she does, Ryan lashes out at Sasha accusing her of being the one who leaked the pictures. The fight spills out into the relationship of all the women and they all part on bad terms.  Dina and Lisa make up quickly. After Sasha decides to take down her blog, disgusted with the celebrity gossip racket, Dina and Lisa reunite with her and the three of them get together to go rescue Ryan who has decided to stay with Stewart through the scandal.  Ryan begins to give her keynote speech and denies that the picture of Stewart and Simone is real. When her friends walk into the room and Ryan sees them, she turns her speech around, revealing that Stewart has cheated on her and that she can no longer lie to herself and her public. The speech is a massive success and when the women reunite after the show, Ryan apologizes to Sasha. Ryan's agent arrives and tells Ryan that the deal with Best Mart is still on but with her alone. Ryan decides to take Sasha with her as her business partner the way they planned to be years ago. A series of events shows the girls happily reunited and Ryan beginning a relationship with Julian.

During an unpleasant appointment at the bank, Joe is one of the victims to witness a robbery in progress carried out by three individuals wearing black masks. During the robbery, he notices the leader bearing a Mongol warrior tattoo on his neck as the only lead that could help the police identify the culprit. However, the leader sympathizes with Joe when he finds out about his current financial situation brought up by the bank. Then, the robbers manage to escape with over $1.6&nbsp;million.  When the company they worked for is bought out, their pensions become a casualty of the restructuring. Joe is hit particularly hard and finds out that he, his daughter, Rachel, and granddaughter, Brooklyn, will be homeless in less than 30 days. Willie finds out he's gravely ill from kidney failure and needs a transplant and is even more frustrated because his financial situation forces him into a long-distance relationship with his daughter and granddaughter. Desperate, the three friends decide to rob the bank that is going to restructure their pension funds and take back what is rightfully theirs.  Inspired by his experience of the robbery, Joe originates the idea; at first Albert and Willie are appalled, but eventually agree when they later learn that their bank intends to steal their pensions. Trying to shoplift some items from a grocery store, where Al's love interest, Annie, works, results in a comic disaster, so the trio turn to Joe's former son-in-law, Murphy, and a criminal working as a pet store owner named Jesus to teach them the ropes. They plan an alibi using their lodge's carnival as a cover.  Joe, Willie, and Albert disguise themselves as "The [[Rat Pack]]" ([[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]) and use guns with blanks so that no one gets hurt. The robbery almost goes awry when Willie collapses briefly and a child witness partially pulls off his mask to allow him to breathe better; she sees the wrist watch he wears with a picture of his granddaughter on it as he engages in a friendly conversation and sympathizes with her, so as not to let her feel intimidated about the robbery in progress and when the bank manager clumsily tries to fire shots at them; however, the three manage to get away with over $2.3 million. They are soon arrested on suspicion by FBI Agent Hamer after the manager from the grocery store recognizes Al's walk from the video surveillance cameras, but they all stick to their alibis.  Hamer puts them along with other senior suspects into a [[police lineup]], using the child witness who partially took off Willie's mask. She refuses to identify Willie, leaving Hamer with no case. Willie suffers total renal failure and is near death until Al agrees to donate a kidney. While part of the money is used to help the three friends with their financial situations, the rest is given to their families, friends, co-workers, and fellow members at the lodge. Joe finally gets his granddaughter a puppy he promised her if she got A's in every subject at school; courtesy of Jesus, who is later revealed to be the leader of the robbers from the robbery Joe witnessed and has laundered the money that they stole. The tattoo on his neck is also revealed to be a fake made of [[henna]], intended to throw the FBI and the police off the scent. The movie ends at Al and Annie's wedding as the three friends celebrate their good fortune.  
Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters
 In the last summer of the 20th century, giant monsters began appearing all over the world and wreaking havoc. A powerful creature called [[Godzilla]] appeared which destroyed humans and monsters alike. Two species of aliens, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, arrived with the former attempting to convert humanity to their religion and the latter seeking to emigrate to Earth with promises to defeat Godzilla with [[Mechagodzilla]], should humanity accept them. However, the Bilusaludo were unable to activate Mechagodzilla, which forced the aliens and humanity to abandon Earth and emigrate to [[Tau Ceti e]] via the Aratrum.  20 years later and 11.9 light years away, Captain Haruo Sakaki locks himself in a shuttle, threatening to bomb the area unless the Aratrum leaves Planet Tau-e and abandons the emigration project. Haruo believes the planet is uninhabitable and the emigration crew only consists of the elderly, including his grandfather, because he believes the Aratrum's committee are trying to reduce the population due to limited resources. Haruo fails, is arrested and thrown in a cell where he witnesses the emigration shuttle exploding upon leaving the planet.  Metphies, an Exif priest, visits Haruo, where he hands him classified data regarding Godzilla. Haruo anonymously publishes an essay detailing Godzilla's weak points, which convinces the central committee to return to Earth after concluding that finding another habitable planet seems unlikely. Upon returning to Earth, the Aratrum sends recon drones to scout the Earth which reveal that Godzilla is still alive.  Metphies explains to the committee that they cannot co-exist with Godzilla and suggests killing it. He also explains that the anonymous essay was the result of a thorough investigation, promising to reveal the author under the condition that Haruo is released. Haruo is released on bail and explains to the committee that a certain unknown organ in Godzilla's body can emit a high frequency electromagnetic pulse that generates an asymmetrical permeable shield. Haruo proposes shoving an EMP probe within the cracked organ before it regenerates so Godzilla can implode. However, Haruo stresses that close quarters combat would be needed for accurately coordinated attacks in order to find its weak organ, as well as 600 people.  The committee reluctantly accepts Haruo's plan. However, upon landing two battalions on Earth, it is discovered that 20,000 years have passed and that Godzilla's presence has radically altered Earth's biosphere. The battalions are attacked by a group of flying creatures called Servums that exhibit biological similarities to Godzilla, causing critical damage to several of the landing ships. Leland, the company's commander, orders a retreat but Metphies stresses that they would need to rendezvous with Companies D and E through a pass in an area Godzilla frequents.  The group mobilizes and soon encounter Godzilla. Haruo proceeds with the original plan on his own and attacks Godzilla. Leland manages to provoke Godzilla to use its atomic breath, but at the cost of his life. Leland's actions reveal that Godzilla's weak point is its dorsal fins. Command falls to Metphies, who promotes Haruo to commander. In a speech, Haruo convinces the remaining survivors to continue with the plan and defeat Godzilla.  The group attacks Godzilla and manage to trap it within a collapsed mountain pass. EMP probes are drilled into Godzilla's dorsal fins which causes it to implode. Commenting after the apparent victory, the group's environmental biologist Martin Lazzari theorizes that this Godzilla may be different from the one that drove humanity away, believing it to be an offspring. Subsequently, the original Godzilla, which has grown exponentially to 300m in height, emerges from beneath a nearby mountain and destroys most of the remaining crew. Trapped beneath rubble, Haruo watches Godzilla leave, vowing to kill it.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Haruo wakes up in a secluded area, finding an indigenous girl next to him.

Gogol. The Beginning
 ===Chapter One. Murders in Dikanka===  Year 1829. Young Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol serves as a judicial clerk in the [[Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery]] in [[St. Petersburg]]. During service, most often when murders occur, Gogol suffers seizures, throughout which he is pursued by strange visions, and in the unconscious state he writes seemingly meaningless words.  Suddenly, Gogol meets with the famous investigator Yakov Petrovich Guro, who immediately notes the unusual quality of the young clerk: his rambling records are valuable clues to the investigation and the murderer is revealed in the shortest possible time. In the evening of the same day, Gogol, overwhelmed by criticism and insecurity in his own talent, in tears and impotent rage burns all the purchased copies of his first work "Hanz Kühelgarten". The next morning Gogol is visited by Guro, who warmly supports him and advises him not to lose heart after his first failed attempt at writing, and also expresses his gratitude for the short cooperation. Guro is going to investigate the mysterious murders of girls in the Poltava province near the small village of Dikanka. Gogol, who had a vision of this at night, asks Guro to take him along as assistant and a clerk, since he comes from those places. Guro, sympathetic and intrigued by seizures-visions of the young man, easily gives his consent and they set out on their journey.  Arriving in Dikanka, Gogol and Guro begin an investigation. The murderer is described as the Dark Horseman, and the superstitious population is extremely reluctant to help the investigation from St. Petersburg, especially in the person of the local investigator Alexander Khristoforovich Binh. In the same place Gogol acquaints himself with the wife of landowner Danishevsky, Elisabeth, a fan of his creativity, towards whom he begins to feel (as he tries to convince himself) platonic emotions. He also gets acquainted with the landowner Danishevsky himself, a strange and mysterious man, living with his wife apart from Dikanka, despite a close neighborhood. During one of the visions of Gogol Oksana (as it turns out later, a [[rusalka]]) appears. In exchange for the help of Nikolai (to identify which of the rusalkas is actually a witch draining strength from drowned women) she promises to help him in the investigation. Meanwhile, to Guro's surprise and fury, it turns out that similar murders took place 30 years ago and nothing was done to uncover them.  During the next vision, Gogol manages to identify among the drowners the witch who turns out to be Hannah from an inn. In the morning Gogol and Guro find a hand at an abandoned mill (rusalkas, when tearing the witch apart, ripped off her hand). Gogol and Guro assume that they found the Horseman and rush to the inn where they discover Hanna; she does not have the hand that was found at the mill. The enraged witch easily copes with Guro, then attacks Gogol, but Binh kills her. The case is solved, and the two can return to St. Petersburg. But the night before the departure of Gogol in a dream is Oksana and tells him that the real killer is at large, and Hannah was only an accomplice. At this time, in a barn in the nearby shed, the Horseman fights with Yakov Petrovich Guro, the shed is collapsing, and everyone believes that Guro and the Dark Horseman died under his wreckage. However, the remains of the Rider are not found. Gogol decides to stay and finish the investigation himself.  At night, the Horseman comes to the grave of Hanna and resurrects her. The Witch begs the Horseman for forgiveness, speaking of Gogol's strange abilities, but the Horseman is deaf to her pleas. From the barn, where they hold Hanna's body, the witch's cry is heard.  ===Chapter Two. Red Scroll=== A few days later in Dikanka there is a new murder: Baba Khavronya dies right on the date with the priest, her lover. He raves about a pig's head and a red scroll, the symbol of conjugal infidelity, which, according to the folk lore, the devil throws to the threshold. The murder was arranged as if the Dark Horseman had done it, but during the seizure Gogol paints a leaf of a linden ("linden" means a fake), and waking up quickly notices that the sign of the Horseman is drawn with an error. When a murder weapon is found in the house, the husband takes the blame on himself.  In Dikanka, Dr. Leopold Leopoldovich Bomgart comes to the aid of Gogol. A man of exclusively scientific mindset, he denies the existence of evil spirits. An autopsy shows that Baba Khavronya died not from a wound, but from a rupture of the heart because of the strongest fright. Her ghost begins to appear and threaten the stepdaughter Paraska, who will soon have a wedding. Gogol once again is tormented by visions about Oksana and Elizabeth: according to the former, in order to learn how to manage his gift, Nikolai must give up worldly attachments and, first of all, feelings to Liza.  Gogol finds the solution with the help of blacksmith Vakula and Dr. Bomgart: the candle bought by Paraska from the gypsies (which burned during the interview with Khavronya and the priest) is stuffed with ingredients that cause hallucinations - Gogol breathes a bit of smoke from this candle and sees one of his greatest fears: [[Pushkin]] mocking him, whose criticism of his work he is very afraid of. Realizing that the murderer is Paraska, who staged the devil's attack so that her stepmother would not stop her from getting married, Gogol exposes her, but she escapes into the forest. With the help of sorcery the ghost of Khavronya catches Paraska and gives her to the Horseman as a new sacrifice. Gogol, Yakim, Vakula and Dr. Bomgart try to catch up, and upon hearing her cry they want to help, but the way is blocked by the witchcraft of the ghost Khavronya. Only thanks to the candle, lit by Dr. Bomgart, the heroes manage to stop the witchcraft. But an unexpected event occurs: the ghost of Khavronya, once faced with Gogol, suddenly becomes terrified and howls "No, do not come near me! Dark one... " disappears, leaving Gogol and his friends in perplexity. But they do not have time to contemplate: Paraska is found dead in a boat by the river bank, and on the ground gleams the terrible symbol of the Dark Horseman.  The next morning at the inn, Gogol gathers Dr. Bomgart, the blacksmith Vakula and his servant Yakim, the only people whom he can trust in the whole of Dikanka; all three agree to help him in the fight against the terrible enemy. Unbeknownst to everyone in the old mirror appears smiling Oksana. It turns out that among the things of Yakov Petrovich Guro there was a trunk, which he ordered to give to Gogol in case of unforeseen circumstances. Vakula easily opens the lock of the chest, to which no one could find the key. When touching the lock Gogol gets a new vision: the next victim of the Dark Horseman can become Lisa. A smile disappears from Oksana's face, and she leaves.  The chapter and the first film ends with a scene, where Yakov Petrovich Guro, who seemingly died in a fire, observes the village of Dikanka while standing on a cliff.  
Golmaal Again
  The story starts with Anna Matthew ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) explaining that she can see ghosts and spiritual spirits due to a special power given to her by the Gods and believes she has been chosen to help ghosts and fulfill their last wishes so that their spirits can achieve [[salvation]]. The story continues with Anna narrating one such incident of her life.  The story revolves around Gopal ([[Ajay Devgn]]), Madhav ([[Arshad Warsi]]), Lucky ([[Tusshar Kapoor]]), Laxman 1 ([[Shreyas Talpade]]) and Laxman 2 ([[Kunal Khemu]]), who are orphans living in an orphanage located in the picturesque [[Ooty]], managed by the kind businessman Jamnadas ([[Uday Tikekar]]).  One night, Gopal, Madhav, Lucky and the two Laxmans find a baby girl at the gate of the orphanage. They name her Khushi and take care of her. The five boys also know Anna, who works in a library nearby. The boys are aware of Anna's power to see spirits from the other world. One day, Madhav pranks and scares the easily frightened Gopal in an empty bungalow, which leads to a fight between the two then young boys. Gopal gets punished and the five boys decide to leave the orphanage. Khushi is extremely upset with this as she is left behind. Khushi later gets adopted by a loving colonel and his wife.  Years later, Gopal and Laxman 1 are estranged from Madhav, Laxman 2 and Lucky. The five, however, are once again reunited when the news of Jamnadas's death comes and they are invited to an event to be held to honour him. They return to the orphanage after 25 years, finding that nothing much has changed. The five enter the old bungalow where Madhav had scared Gopal. There, they meet the colonel; they are also reunited with Anna Matthew, and Pappi ([[Johnny Lever]]), another orphan from the orphanage. They also meet with Damini ([[Parineeti Chopra]]) whom Anna introduces as the bunglow's caretaker. Anna reacts strangely when she sees the boys acknowledging Damini's presence.  At the special event for Jamnadas, businessman Vasu Reddy ([[Prakash Raj]]) reveals that the orphanage's kids will be shifted somewhere else, while the orphanage in Ooty will be demolished. Soon, one by one, the boys get possessed by a ghost that talks in [[Nana Patekar]]'s voice. This scares Gopal, so Anna suggests they stay in Colonel's house.  Madhav, Laxman 2 and Lucky are also staying in the Colonel's house, as they are handed over the job of getting Gopal and Laxman 1 out of the house by Vasooli ([[Mukesh Tiwari]]) and Vasu Reddy. The five of them fight daily, exasperating Anna. The boys finally make amends after Lucky gets possessed. They push Gopal, who has fallen for Damini, to express his love to her. Just then, Pappi tells that the girl who they thought was Damini is actually dead and the real Damini is alive and is Pappi's girlfriend. Terrified, they try to flee but Anna stops them and reveals that the ghost is of none other than their own Khushi, their childhood friend.  Khushi then tells her tale that how she had met a young businessman, Nikhil ([[Neil Nitin Mukesh]]), and fell in love with him. Their marriage was fixed. One night, however, she witnessed Nikhil killing Jamnadas as Jamnadas confronted Nikhil about the latter's conspiracy of obtaining the orphanage in his name on the pretext of benefitting the orphans, and instead, demolishing the orphanage and building a construction site for his personal gain. Khushi then confronted Nikhil and threatens to go to the police and calls him a murderer. Nikhil then strangled Khushi to death. With Vasu Reddy's help, Nikhil proved Jamnadas' and Khushi's death as accidents. Khushi came to Anna as a spirit, asking for help. Anna was surprised that the boys could see Khushi and took it as God's sign, which is why she brought the boys to the house to help her.  The boys plan to scare Vasu into confessing the truth but their plan is ruined when Nikhil returns and mocks that they don't have any evidence to prosecute him for the alleged crime. This infuriates Khushi, who brutally attacks Nikhil and almost kills him. Anna calms her down and Vasu Reddy convinces Nikhil to confess. In the end, the orphanage is saved and Khushi's spirit, now content, departs happily to heaven after bidding goodbye to the boys.  During the credits, the five dance with Khushi on a song.<ref></ref>

Goodbye Christopher Robin
 The film begins during WWII in 1941, with [[A. A. Milne|Alan Alexander Milne]] – nicknamed "Blue" by his friends and family – and his wife Daphne receiving a distressing telegram at their home. It then changes time frame to 1916 during WWI with Blue fighting in the [[Battle of the Somme]]. He resumes his life with Daphne in England while suffering [[shell shock]] of occasional flashbacks to his battle experiences, and having a child with Daphne. She was hoping for a girl and is disappointed to instead have a son, whom they name [[Christopher Robin Milne]] but generally call "Billy Moon". They hire a nanny, Olive, whom Billy calls "Nou".  Blue is having difficulty resuming his writing – he wants to draft a compelling treatise against war – and relocates the family to a house in the country with wooded acreage. Daphne resents the move and returns to London for an extended period. During that time, Olive goes to care for her dying mother and the cook takes some time off, leaving Blue and Billy to fend for themselves. Reluctantly at first, Blue takes Billy along on walks in the woods and begins making up stories about the boy's adventures with the stuffed animals the parents have bought for him.  Blue invites his illustrator friend [[E. H. Shepard|Ernest]] to join them at the house, and together they begin to develop the ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' books. Daphne returns to the house after Blue sends her a poem "Vespers", that she has published in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazines)|Vanity Fair]]''. Olive returns following her mother's death. After the ''Winnie-the-Pooh'' books become a success, Daphne manages their newfound celebrity. As Christopher Robin, Billy makes frequent public appearances which he finds confusing and frustrating. After Billy tells his parents Olive has a beau, Alfred, she becomes angry with them, resigns and admonishes Blue and Daphne for what they are putting Billy through. Blue resolves to stop writing about the boy and his imaginary friends.  Blue ends Billy's publicity activities and enrolls him at a boarding school. However, "Christopher Robin" is bullied at the school and emerges bitter toward his father. When WWII breaks out, Billy is initially declared unfit for the draft, but he demands that his well-connected father – despite being horrified by war and the prospect of his son experiencing what he did – convince the army to accept him regardless. Billy leaves for service, turning his back on his father and disowning the books and the money from them.  The opening scene is replayed, this time explaining that Billy has been reported missing and is presumed dead – news his parents pass along to Olive. However, Billy has survived and arrives at the country house without warning, leading to awkward but tearful reunions with his parents and Olive. Blue and Billy have a reconciliation of sorts, and they are seen walking in the woods as a young child and younger man.

Gook (film)
 Eli (Justin Chon) and Daniel (David So) are two Korean American brothers who own their late father's struggling shoe store in a predominantly African American community of Paramount, California. They have a unique and unlikely friendship with an 11-year-old African American girl, Kamilla (Baker). These three deal with hardships on a daily basis; Eli and Daniel face racism from African Americans and Hispanics, and Kamilla has a troubled family after the death of her mother some years earlier, who warn her not to stay away from the shoe store. Kamilla is also constantly badgered by Mr. Kim (Sang Chon), who owns a liquor store near Eli and Daniel's shoe store; this leads to Eli often intervening on Kamilla's behalf, straining the relationship between Mr. Kim and Eli. Mr. Kim speaks to Eli in [[Korean language | Korean]] and Eli replies primarily in [[English language | English]], and occasionally in Korean. On April 29th, 1992, the news of the day is focused on the pending [[Rodney King]] assault verdict, Kamilla ditches school and heads to the shoe store; Eli stresses about the store staying afloat, while Daniel tries to have a good time often disregarding the customers while dreaming of becoming a recording artist.   As the day passes, the verdict from the trial is read on the news, acquitting the officers for the beating of King. Because of this, racial tensions build to a breaking point in L.A. as the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] break out in nearby South Central Los Angeles. Daniel and Eli get into an argument over Daniel granting excessive discounts to customers, and Daniel leaves the store to record a demo tape. On the way to the recording studio, Daniel is jumped by Kamilla's brother Keith (Cook, Jr.) and his friends, who take his money and necklace. They only stop assaulting Daniel when Keith receives a message on his [[pager]] saying "free shit South Central", alluding to the nearby riots. Daniel proceeds to record his demo tape but cannot pay the owner of the studio due to being robbed. The studio owner convinces him to pay his debt by assisting him in looting at the riots. While driving through the riot areas, Daniel is pulled out of a car by rioters and assaulted again. He is later saved by Mr. Kim, who picks Daniel up in his van. Mr. Kim then discloses to Daniel that he served in the South Korean military with Eli and Daniel's father as part of the country's [[Conscription in South Korea|conscription]] law.  As day turns to night, Kamilla goes home and is found by Keith to have hung around at the shoe store because of a pair of [[Air Jordan]] sneakers that Eli gave to her earlier that day. After hearing her say they're better family than (Keith), Keith flies into a rage as Kamilla, Keith and Regina's mother's death was somehow caused by the Korean family that owned the store. Keith plots to round up his crew to rob Eli and Daniel's store of their remaining sneakers. Eli finds his car unable to start and is attempting to fix it, failing to do so when he finds out that he is out of gas. Shortly thereafter Mr. Kim returns with Daniel and Daniel and Eli argue briefly before Eli notices Mr Kim and attempts to argue with him before Mr. Kim defuses the situation with a cigarette as a peace offering. Kim then talks to Eli about when he and Eli's father started the shoe store and of how his father and Kamilla's mother died during a robbery at the shoe store, and how their lives weren't what they wanted to give their kids. After he leaves, Kamilla takes his other gun and runs to warn Eli and Daniel about Keith's intentions. Eli and Daniel argue over whether to remove the shoes from the premises or to surrender the shoes to Keith and lose the store, which is already two months behind on rent. Eli decides to stay behind to try to move the shoes, while Daniel and Kamilla leave. With his car unable to start, Eli packs up as many shoes as he can carry, but upon leaving the store, is robbed of the shoes at gunpoint by three Hispanic gang members, who had jumped Eli earlier that day.   Eli reunites with Daniel and Kamilla at a nearby restaurant. They encounter Jesus, a Hispanic man from their neighborhood who helped around the store, who gifts Eli with a gas can to fill up and start his car. Jesus also discloses to them that he put the Air Jordans on the roof. So the shoes Eli thought he was robbed of were in fact women's shoes in the Air Jordans boxes, and the Air Jordan sneakers were still at the shoe store, on the roof. Eli, Daniel, and Kamilla attempt to move the sneakers when Keith arrives, forcing them to hide on the roof. Eli decides to just throw down to them the shoes they came to steal, as he had decided to close the store and seek a new beginning. Keith is convinced by his friends to leave the shoe store but eventually returns and threatens to burn the store down with a gas can and [[Molotov cocktail]]s. Kamilla, with Keith's other gun, runs out to fire a shot to keep them from burning down the store but trips as she exits and shoots herself. Keith's friends leave when they hear the shot, leaving Keith and Eli to take Kamilla to a nearby hospital. Keith has an emotional breakdown directed at Eli, then himself, and Eli stops him. Eli returns to the store in the morning and he shakes his head, letting Daniel know that Kamilla passed away. Eli tells Daniel to grab the Molotov cocktails that Keith left behind. Eli burns the store down. The final shot is the same as the first; the spirit of Kamilla dancing to the burning shoe store.

Goon: Last of the Enforcers
 During a pro hockey [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]], Doug "The Thug" Glatt's ([[Seann William Scott]]) team, the Halifax Highlanders, has to contend with an influx of new players. With pro hockey suspended, media focus has descended on the lower league, and the owner of the Highlanders, Hyrum Cain ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), seeks to capitalize on the attention. Before the opening game, Doug is made captain and leads his team out onto the ice. In a close fought game, Doug is goaded into a fight with the rival team's enforcer, Anders Cain ([[Wyatt Russell]]), an up-and-coming player with a violent streak, and the son of the Highlanders' owner. Anders wins the fight, and with Doug badly injured, the Highlanders lose the game. Dealing with rehab, Doug decides to retire and accept a more stable job as an insurance salesman. At home, Doug's wife Eva realizes that she is pregnant, and she and Doug make preparations for their new child. Without Doug, the Highlanders go on a long losing streak, prompting the owner to push for changes. He signs several overseas players and pushes to add his own son to the team. Hyrum foresees Anders as the new captain of the Highlanders, and although the coach disagrees with the move, anticipating locker room dysfunction, Hyrum strongarms him into making Anders the new captain.   Meanwhile, Doug finds no joy in his new job, stuck in a dingy office, and he begins secretly training to get back into hockey. Doug visits his old rival, Ross "The Boss" Rhea, who has left hockey and now competes in a hockey fighting league, where he is the current champion. Doug convinces Ross to train him in southpaw fighting, as the injury he suffered fighting Anders has weakened his right arm. Ross agrees to train him, and Doug slowly begins to learn how to fight left-handed. Ross convinces Doug that if he joins the hockey fighting league and impresses, it could be a way to get back into minor league hockey. Doug takes Ross' advice, but the first fight ends up being a battle royale style brawl, instead of the one-on-one fights that Doug had witnessed before. Doug and Ross end up as the last two standing during the melee, but Ross is too hurt to continue and collapses before they can fight each other. In the locker room after the fight, Ross reveals that he has [[post-concussion syndrome]], and doctors have recommended that he stop playing, as one more bad hit could cause a permanent injury.  At the same time, the Highlanders have improved with Anders as the captain, but not enough to get into playoff position. Anders' self-sabotaging play, in which he constantly is being penalized for fighting, has kept the Highlanders outside of a playoff spot. In addition, Anders' aggressive and violent attitudes towards his fellow players keeps the whole team on edge, and their play suffers as a result. During another losing effort, Anders grows frustrated and ends up knocking out the entire opposing team. He is promptly suspended, and the coach demands a change. Hyrum, having seen Doug at the hockey fighting league, suggests that they add Doug back to the roster, secretly hoping that his addition will push his son to play better. Before Doug's first game back, Eva makes Doug promise that he won't fight, concerned for him now that they're about to be parents. Doug reluctantly agrees, and the Highlanders narrowly win in Doug's celebrated return. The Highlanders go on a winning streak, but when Anders returns from suspension, he goads Doug into being more aggressive. Doug and Anders interrupt a game during a dispute, and they are both suspended for the next game. During the game's afterparty, Anders provokes Doug into a fight, and when Eva sees that Doug has been fighting again, she kicks him out of the house.  Meanwhile, the Highlanders must win the last two games of the season to sneak into the playoffs. With Anders and Doug suspended, Hyrum decides to sign Ross, who has still been competing in the local hockey fighting league. To free up a spot, Hyrum terminates Anders' contract, fed up with his son's antics. While Ross helps the Highlanders to win the first of their last two games, Eva goes into labor, and Doug reconciles with her as they head to the hospital. After having her baby, Eva realizes that the same drive that led Doug to be with her during the birth, is the same drive that pushes him to want to defend his teammates on the ice, and she gives Doug her blessing to continue fighting. Having been kicked off the team, Anders rejoins his old team, as they will play the Highlanders in the last game of the season with a playoff spot on the line. The game is immediately chippy, with both Ross and Anders starting fights. As the game enters the third period with the game tied, Ross and Anders are involved in a scuffle, and Anders cheap shots Ross, checking him from behind into the boards. Ross is knocked unconscious, and while paramedics take him away on a stretcher, Doug enters the rink to fight Anders in retaliation.  Doug uses his southpaw training to beat Anders, but when Doug shows mercy, Anders threatens Doug, claiming that he will never stop coming for him until they are both like Ross, being carried out on stretchers. Realizing that his new family is more important to him than hockey, Doug uses his weakened right arm to level Anders, but throws his arm out and has to be helped off the ice. Hyrum rushes to his son's aid, where Anders tells him that he hates hockey, and the two appear to mend things between them. Having been told earlier that further injury to his right arm would be career-ending, Doug realizes that his hockey days are behind him. He watches as the Highlanders win the game in the final seconds, and during the celebration, he sets his stick down and goes home.

[[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Ayesha]], leader of the Sovereign race, has the Guardians protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals some for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. These are destroyed by a mysterious figure, and the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. There, this figure reveals himself as Quill's father, [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]], and invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard Nebula.  Ayesha hires [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]] and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for [[Human trafficking|child trafficking]], to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant [[Taserface]] leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard the latter's ship and executes his loyalists by releasing them into space. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by their father, [[Thanos]]. While imprisoned, Rocket and Yondu bond. Groot and [[Kraglin]], a remaining Yondu loyalist, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew as they escape, though not before Taserface warns the Sovereign.  Ego, a god-like [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] that manipulated the matter around its consciousness to form this "home" planet, explains that it projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother [[Meredith Quill|Meredith]]. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds which can [[Terraforming|terraform]] them into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he gave Meredith the tumour that killed her due to the distraction she posed.  [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], Ego's naïve [[Empathy|empath]] servant, grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan as Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive. As they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones, the reunited Guardians find Ego's brain at the planet's core. Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial powers to distract him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill, who realizes that the reason Yondu kept him was to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny, and that Yondu was Quill's true "daddy". Having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos by herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which is attended by Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships, acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again.  In a series of mid- and [[post-credit scene]]s, Kraglin takes up Yondu's telekinetic arrow and control-fin; Ravager leader [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]] reunites with his ex-teammates; Groot has grown into a teenager; Ayesha creates a new artificial being with whom she plans to destroy the Guardians, naming him Adam; and a group of uninterested [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]] abandon their informant, who is discussing his experiences on Earth.  
The Greatest Showman
  In the late 19th century, [[P. T. Barnum]] and his troupe perform a show at the circus ("The Greatest Show"). In a flashback to Barnum's childhood where he and his father Philo, a tailor, work for the Hallett family, he becomes infatuated with their daughter, Charity. Though Charity is being sent to [[finishing school]], Barnum reassures her they will not be separated. The two keep in touch through letters until they meet again in adulthood ("A Million Dreams"), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City ("A Million Dreams" reprise). They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum dreams of more.  Barnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes bankrupt. Taking a risky bet, he takes out a large loan from a bank, deceiving the bank into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He uses this loan to buy [[Barnum's American Museum]] in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially, sales are slow; on the suggestion of his children to showcase something "alive", Barnum searches for "freaks" to serve as performers for his museum ("Come Alive"). This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor reviews, prompting Barnum to rename his venture "Barnum's Circus."  Searching for ways to further his reputation amongst the upper class, Barnum meets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture ("The Other Side"). Carlyle is enchanted with Anne Wheeler, an African-American trapeze artist, but he hides his feelings. During a trip, Carlyle arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet [[Queen Victoria]]. Afterwards, Barnum meets [[Jenny Lind]], a famed Swedish singer, whom he convinces to perform in America, with him serving as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing success ("Never Enough"). While Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic patrons, he begins to distance himself from his original troupe, refusing to socialize with them. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers ("This Is Me").  Carlyle and Wheeler attend the theater together one night, only to run into Carlyle's parents, who are blatantly racist toward Wheeler, causing her to leave. Carlyle chases her and tries to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him despite her feelings towards him ("Rewrite the Stars"). As Barnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home with their daughters ("Tightrope"). While on tour, Lind begins falling in love with Barnum, but when he refuses her advances, she calls off the tour and kisses him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press ("Never Enough" reprise). Barnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Carlyle, who had tried to save Anne not knowing she had already escaped, is rescued by Barnum amid the chaos but suffers severe burns. Most of the sets and props are destroyed. Word of Lind's cancellation and Barnum's public intimacy also reaches New York, resulting in his mansion being foreclosed upon and Charity taking Caroline and Helen to her parents' home.  Depressed, Barnum retreats to a local bar, where his troupe find him there and explain that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family that needs him. An inspired Barnum resolves to start anew and not let ambition overtake his loved ones anymore. Meanwhile, the injured Carlyle wakes in a hospital with Anne by his side and they share a kiss ("From Now On").  Barnum leaves and finds his estranged wife, and they decide to mend their relationship. Faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus, the recovering Carlyle steps in, offering to use his earnings from his share of the circus's profits to rebuild it under the condition of becoming partners, which Barnum happily accepts. As rebuilding the circus in its original location would be too expensive, Barnum rebuilds it as an open-air tent circus by the docks. The revamped circus is a huge success, and Barnum gives full control of the show to Carlyle so he can focus on his family ("The Greatest Show" reprise).  
Guardians (film)
 During the [[Cold War]], a secret organization known as "Patriot" gathers a team of Soviet [[superhero]]es, altering and augmenting the DNA of many selected individuals throughout the former state's territory, in order to defend the homeland from superhuman threats. The team includes representatives of the different nationalities of the [[Soviet Union]] and allegedly implies restoration of former USSR. Arseniy, codenamed Ursus ([[Anton Pampushny]]), can change into a huge, incredible strong bear-man. Temirkhan, codenamed Khan ([[Sanjar Madi]]), has super-speed and wields a pair of curved swords. Lernik, codenamed Ler [[(Sebastien Sisak)]], has the ability to control earth and stone. Finally, Xenia ([[Alina Lanina]]) has the power of invisibility and can transform her body into water.   The program succeeds where a second program called Module-1 fails. This prompts Professor August Kuratov (Stanislav Shirin), creator of Module-1, to flee to the remote wilderness, away from Soviet authorities, to continue working on his experiments. When the military is summoned to arrest him, he bombs the Patriot laboratory, surviving because he was covered with some chemicals. He rebuilds his damaged body making himself into a [[cyborg]]. This gives him the power to generate electricity and control machines. He also created an army of clones of himself, and sets out to prove to the world that he is a genius. After the explosion, Arsus, Ler, Khan, and Xenia go into hiding for years.  In the present day, several walking robots used in a training exercise turn against their supervising officials and kill them. This leads to the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defence]] holding a meeting and deciding to revive the Patriot organization under the leadership of Major Elena Larina (Valeriya Shkirando) and to locate their missing super agents. She finds Ler spending his time meditating in the [[Khor Virap]] Monastery in [[Armenia]]; Khan living on the steppes of [[Kazakhstan]]; Ursus in a remote cabin on the [[Putorana Plateau]] in northern [[Siberia]]; and Xenia performing stunts in a circus in Moscow. Their first task is to raid Kuratov's laboratory within an old factory, but they are captured.  Kuratov offers the Guardians a chance to join him but they refuse. This angers him and he keeps three of them trapped within a magnetic force field and injures Ler. He later goes to a military facility at [[Noginsk]] to take control of the tanks and other vehicles stationed there. Using them, he launches an invasion of Moscow and makes preparations to use the [[Ostankino Tower]] and the [[Federation Tower]] for his Module-2 Projec. He intends to transmit a signal through an old Soviet satellite, which will then be sent to every other satellite orbiting Earth, and use it to seize control of all technology in the world. He uses a force field to protect his beacon-tower and destroy several jet fighters that are sent to stop him. When a collaborator within the Russian military, Major-General Nikolai Dolgov, asks Kuratov for a reward for his help, Kuratov strangles him to death.  While Ler recovers, he reflects on the fact that his superhuman abilities prevent him from aging normally. He has stayed the same age while his wife and grandchildren have grown older and passed away. At the meantime, Major Elena frees the other team members from Kuratov's laboratory. She sends Kuratov's former rival to study one of Kuratov's clones. Unfortunately the real Kuratov releases poison gas to kill him. Arsus and the other Guardians are trained in the Patriots' facility and are given suits and weapons.  The Guardians go to Moscow: Xenia and Ursus advance through the streets, Ler defeats several soldiers patrolling an underground car park, and Khan uses an airplane to try to fly above Kuratov's force field. The three Guardians enter a shopping mall, and cross an iron bar linking it to the tower-beacon, but are attacked by more of Kuratov's troops. Khan jumps from the airplane and slices the pipe, causing Kuratov's troops to fall.  While the other Guardians figure out a way to destroy the power source for Kuratov's beacon, Xenia touches the power source and injures herself, temporarily disabling the beacon's transmissions and causing the force field to collapse. The Guardians battle Kuratov on the platform, but fail to defeat and kill him. As the guardians leave on a grappling rope hanging from an airplane, Kuratov's beacon interferes with the plane's controls. Khan cuts the grappling rope linking them to the falling airplane and they land to a river.  As they swim to a road, they consider going back to Kuratov's beacon to destroy it and kill Kuratov, but Major Elena arrives and commands them not to. She tells them that as superhumans, they can also pool their energy and release it as a blast, but doing so can be fatal. The Guardians touch each other and generate a blast of energy that damages Kuratov's tower, causing Kuratov to fall to his death. Major Elena says that, while Kuratov boasted that he created the Guardians, they really created themselves.  The Guardians recover, rendezvousing with Major Elena on a bridge in the rebuilt Moscow. Although they choose to go back to their normal lives, they also consider continuing their service to the Patriot organization. In a post-credits scene, Elena is seen attacking a soldier after his truck stops. When she questions the soldier, he tells her that "Ferrum" has sent him as part of an unspecified mission.

All apparently goes well, until Kurosawa is shot in the head through an airplane window. Two years later, Bryce, fallen into disgrace, ekes out a living protecting drug-addicted corporate executives in [[London]]. Meanwhile, Vladislav Dukhovich, the ruthless and bloodthirsty dictator of [[Belarus]] is put on trial for crimes against humanity at the [[International Criminal Court]]. The prosecution is unable to make headway against him, as they are unable to substantiate their allegations with physical evidence and Dukhovich assassinates any witnesses who could do so. The prosecution's last hope is notorious incarcerated hitman Darius Kincaid, who agrees to testify against Dukhovich in exchange for releasing his wife Sonia from prison.  Interpol Assistant Director Jean Foucher assigns Amelia Roussel, an inexperienced agent and Bryce's ex-girlfriend, to lead the transportation of Kincaid. A squad of Interpol agents composed of French [[National Police Intervention Groups|GIPN]] and British [[Authorised Firearms Officer|AFOs]] from the [[National Crime Agency]] begin to escort Kincaid from [[Manchester]] to [[The Hague]]. However, the convoy is ambushed in [[Coventry]] and everyone except Kincaid and Roussel are killed. The two retreat to a safehouse. They realise someone in Interpol must have betrayed them and they need someone from outside they can trust, so Roussel contacts Bryce. Bryce is reluctant to help, as he believes that Roussel was responsible for the death of Kurosawa two years previously, but ultimately agrees to aid them in exchange for the restoration of his reputation. After a brief showdown with Kincaid which reveals that Bryce had multiple conflicts with him in the past, Roussel returns to Interpol to update them on the situation, while Bryce and Kincaid escape an attack by Dukhovich's men.  Foucher approaches Dukhovich, revealing himself to be the traitor, and demands his payment for selling out Kincaid; Dukhovich stabs him in the hand and informs him he will only be paid when Kincaid is dead.

As Bryce bemoans his failures, a group of hitmen attacks Kincaid. Bryce changes his mind and helps Kincaid escape, but is captured. Dukhovich's men torture him in an attempt to find Kincaid, who tracks Bryce down and rescues him. After settling their differences, the two battle their way to The Hague, arriving just in time for Kincaid to testify. He testifies that Dukhovich tried to hire Kincaid to assassinate a political rival, but in the process Kincaid witnessed the execution of a village, uploading photos of the massacre to a secret [[FTP site]] that he provides the court with access to.  Dukhovich resorts to his backup plan; to bomb the court, allowing him to steal a gun and attempt to kill Kincaid. Bryce jumps in the way of the bullet and tells Kincaid to stop Dukhovich from escaping. Roussel notices Foucher acting suspiciously during the attack, and deduces he was the traitor. She subdues him with Bryce's aid. Kincaid pursues Dukhovich to the roof of the building, where he attempts to escape by helicopter.

The Hippopotamus (film)
 Edward "Ted" Wallace ([[Roger Allam]]) is an aging, jaded writer and former poet. Having not written a poem since 1987, he is stuck writing reviews of small-time plays, wallowing in his bath, and compulsively drinking. After a dispute at a poorly-performed play leads to him being fired from his position as a critic, Ted runs into his goddaughter Jane, who lavishly pays him to investigate a series of miracles occurring at her family's manor in light of her unexplained apparent recovery from [[leukemia]].  At the manor, owned by his former friend Lord Michael Logan, Ted becomes acquainted with his sixteen-year-old godson, David, who displays an unusual amount of fascination with both sex and nature. Also at the manor is David's brother Simon, Michael's [[angina]]-afflicted friend Oliver, who hopes to obtain funding for his upcoming play, and Valerie Richmond, a wealthy Frenchwoman who seeks to purchase one of the manor's horses, Lilac, for her socially awkward daughter Clara, who is accompanying her. For the next few days, Ted becomes acquainted with the manor's residents, encountering conflict between his abrasive attitude and the others' perky optimism, while David converses with Ted about both his interests and his ambitions of becoming a fellow poet.  One day, Lilac mysteriously falls ill of what appears to be [[ragwort]] poisoning, something which strikes Michael and Simon as odd since ragwort doesn't grow in the area. While Michael and company despair over the possibility of having to euthanize Lilac, Ted learns from various members of his godfamily that the miracles he was sent to investigate were performed by David himself. According to this account, David had healed his mother from a severe asthma attack simply by touching her when Simon's CPR seemed ineffective, and cured Jane's leukemia over the course of a few days through the same method. The following day, David appears to perform more miracles by curing Lilac's ragwood poisoning and Oliver's angina, leading Valerie to pursue him in hopes of improving Clara's appearance. David, however, has gone missing, leading to a widespread search across the manor's grounds. Ted eventually sights David and Clara running into the woods afterwards and gives chase, only to find Clara performing fellatio on David. A bewildered Ted simply chooses to observe them as an ejaculating David tries to coerce Clara into swallowing his semen; Simon then discovers the pair and interrupts them, leading a panicked Clara to bite David's penis. After Simon takes Clara back to the manor, Ted comes out of hiding and drives a bleeding David to the hospital. On the way back, David explains to Ted that he believes his healing powers come from his moral purity and a spiritual connection with nature, channeled though his hands and especially his bodily fluids; Ted rebukes all of this as blind delusion, leading a heartbroken David to abandon him. Once Ted returns to the manor, he is confronted by Michael's ex-fiance Geraldine, who bears a grudge against Ted for him publicly humiliating Ted on live television many years prior; Geraldine insults Ted and rebukes him for his interventions in Michael's family's life, leaving Ted to sulk alone in his room for the rest of the night. However, he comes to an unexpected realization when he accidentally knocks over and smashes his whisky bottle.  The following evening, the manor's residents agree to publicly announce David's miraculous healing abilities, only for Ted to refute all of them as mere coincidence. Ted explains that the breaking of his whisky bottle led him to realize that Lilac's poisoning was actually a hangover from drinking the contents of a bottle he dropped in an outdoor bucket from earlier in the film, that Simon's CPR had proved effective in rescuing his mother during her asthma attack, and that Jane's recovery from leukemia was actually a natural quieting of its symptoms. Ted further reveals David's confidence in his semen's abilities, and that this led him to have morally-dubious sex with Jane, Lilac, and Oliver. Ted's acidic lecture both disgusts and angers the residents of the manor and leads an eavesdropping David to attempt suicide by burying himself alive. However, the others discover David's absence and rescue him in the nick of time, before Ted is forced to deliver the unfortunate news that Jane's leukemia has killed her.  Some time passes, and the group has moved on from the events of that night. At Jane's funeral, David explains to Ted that his new "normal" life is one of hard work, and Ted's experiences from the summer at Michael's manor have reignited his sense of wonder; having written five new poems for the first time in nearly 30 years and preparing to write a sixth, a solitary Ted ushers a toast "to miracles."

Blocker chooses the detail that will accompany him: his trusty old friend Sergeant Thomas Metz, long-time aide Corporal Woodson, and promising newcomer Lieutenant Kidder, fresh from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. Biggs also assigns to the detail a young French-speaking recruit, Private DeJardin.  They begin their journey but Blocker orders a stop and has the two native men put in chains. The group comes across the charred Quaid house and dead settler. Inside the house they find Rosalee and her three "sleeping" children. Rosalee is initially hostile towards the Cheyenne family because of the attack on her family but agrees to sleep in their camp after some coaxing from Blocker. She is convinced to bury her family and join Blocker's detail until their next stop-over. They are soon ambushed by the Comanche party, resulting in DeJardin's death and Woodson being seriously wounded. After this attack, Yellow Hawk convinces Blocker that it is in everyone's best interest to unchain him and his family. The next day, the bodies of the surviving Comanche party, who had managed to flee during their previous encounter, are discovered dead. Blocker deduces that Yellow Hawk and his son, Black Hawk, killed them thanks to Metz allowing them to leave the camp during the night.  After a brief stop at Fort Winslow in [[Colorado]] to drop off the wounded Woodson and Rosalee, Blocker is instructed to take disgraced Sergeant Charles Wills, who killed a family with an ax, to be court-martialed and hanged at a stop at his original post along the way to Montana. Joining Blocker’s company to oversee Wills are Corporal Tommy Thomas and Sergeant Malloy. Meanwhile, Rosalee decides to continue on with Blocker, despite being offered sanctuary at Fort Winslow until the next supply train at Christmas. One night, the women are abducted by three fur traders as they wash dishes in the stream by their camp. The company, assisted by Yellow Hawk and Black Hawk, manages to track down the fur traders and slaughter them to rescue the women; however, Sergeant Malloy is killed. During a downpour, Wills manages to fool Kidder into sympathetically undoing his chains, only to kill him and escape but not before Blocker shoots him.  He is later tracked down by Metz, who then takes his own life, succumbing to decades of [[PTSD]].  Blocker arrives with the dying chief at his tribal lands in [[Montana]] where he dies and is buried. The white landowner and his three sons arrive to the place as the chief is buried and threatens Blocker and the rest of the group for burying an Indian on his land. Blocker tells the landowner that the chief is not leaving the land. The confrontation results in a brutal gun battle killing Black Hawk, his wife Elk Woman, his sister Living Woman, and Corporal Tommy Thomas, while leaving alive only Blocker, Rosalee, and Black Hawk's young son, Little Bear. In the final scene, Rosalee and Little Bear reluctantly depart on a train from Montana to Chicago, without Blocker, but, at the last second, Blocker jumps on the back of the train.

I Kill Giants (film)
 Barbara Thorson is a young, independent teenager who lives with her brother and supportive older sister, Karen. Barbara has created a fantasy world inspired by her love of [[Dungeons & Dragons]] and the career of former [[Phillies]] pitcher, [[Harry Coveleski]]. Believing that [[giant]]s from other worlds are coming to attack her hometown, she spends her days creating weapons and traps to fend off the creatures.   One day, Barbara meets Sophia, who just moved to the area from [[Leeds, England]]. Sophia expresses an interest in getting to know Barbara, but Barbara initially remains aloof.    A confrontation between Barbara and a group of bullies led by Taylor is interrupted by Barbara being called by the school psychologist, Mrs. Mollé. Barbara leaves the ensuing meeting abruptly, declaring that their talk would just distract her from her preparations to battle a giant. Later, Barbara explains the mythology behind the giants to Sophia. She shows Sophia the baits and traps she created to lure and trap giants, and tells her about the magical [[war hammer|warhammer]], Coveleski, which she keeps in her handbag. She also tells Sophia about Harbingers, ghostly creatures that warn her when there is a nearby giant.   After Barbara is given detention by the principal for insulting a teacher, she takes Sophia with her on her hunt for a giant. Sophia begins to doubt Barbara's claims about the giants.  When Mrs. Mollé learns about Barbara's interest in baseball, she asks about it, causing Barbara to become lost in bad memories and to run home. In a daze, she is startled by Sophia and strikes her, causing Taylor and her friends -who witnessed it- to laugh. Though Barbara tries to apologize, Sophia runs off, upset. Later, Sophia is approached by Taylor who promises to tell her a secret about Barbara if Sophia will show them some of the "freaky things" Barbara does. Sophia agrees, leading Taylor and friends to the sanctuary, where they proceed to dismantle many of Barbara's traps. Barbara interrupts and draws Coveleski, which turns out to be a small animal's jawbone tied to a stick. Barbara is shocked at the state of her weapon, and is beaten by Taylor and her friends.   Sophia takes Barbara to her home to recover. When Barbara wakes, she becomes very upset at being brought upstairs, and tells Sophia to slowly move away, before "it" sees her. Sophia looks into one of the bedrooms and drops a glass of water in shock before fleeing the house. Barbara visits Mrs. Mollé at her house looking for help, but grows uncomfortable upon being introduced to her family.   After Barbara fails to go to school for several days, Sophia and Mrs. Mollé visit Barbara's house. In the basement, Sophia discovers a recording of Barbara and her mother telling the story of Coveleski's "Giant Killer" nickname. Sophia leaves and finds Barbara, telling her that all of the giants are in her head, and asks Barbara why she never told Sophia about her mother. Barbara angrily storms off. She is visited by Harbingers who taunt her, telling her that she is too weak to defeat a giant.   Barbara heads to face the giant at an abandoned train yard. She hides in the trains, but is hunted by the giant. She eventually activates a train control station rigged to nearby electrical poles, which electrocutes it and sets fire to some of the train cars. Sophia arrives just as Barbara is leaving. The next day, Barbara humiliates Taylor by placing a skeleton in her locker. This worries Mrs. Mollé and Karen who proceed to look for Barbara. Barbara heads to her sanctuary upon discovering that she still can't use Coveleski, where she prays for the return of her weapon.   As an unexpected storm bears down on the town, Mrs. Mollé confronts Barbara on her way to the sanctuary, telling her that Barbara's mother is desperate to see her. Barbara ignores her. Upon arriving, she witnesses a scene of destruction. Sophia explains that Taylor wrecked the area as revenge for what Barbara did and that she tried to stop her. Suddenly, a giant appears out of the water. Barbara stands against it, and draws forth the restored Coveleski from her handbag, revealing a massive, glowing war hammer. She proceeds to defeat the giant with it, fueled by her wrath that it came for her mother. Laying injured upon the beach, the giant reveals that he came for Barbara, not her mother. Barbara is stunned, and demands that the titan "finish it". The giant snatches her up, and draws her close to its head, so she can strike it down with Coveleski. As the giant falls back into the ocean, it brings Barbara with it. Sinking below the waves, she hears the voice of the giant telling her that every living thing must die. It says to run from death is to reject life, and that she must find joy in every moment while she can. Barbara swims back to the beach, where she reunites with Sophia.  The next day, Barbara climbs upstairs to see her mother, who lies dying in her bed. They share heartfelt messages and Barbara apologizes for avoiding her. After the summer break, Barbara's mother dies, but Barbara rekindles her relationships with Mrs. Mollé, Karen and Sophia. On the first night of school, she is awoken by the giant, who stands in the ocean, watching her. She says thank you and goes back to sleep.  
I, Tonya
 In 1970s poverty-stricken [[East Portland, Oregon]], three-year-old [[Tonya Harding]] is compelled to ice skate by her physically and verbally abusive mother, LaVona. As Tonya grows up, LaVona takes her out of school to focus on her skating career, and she trains extensively under coach Diane Rawlinson. Tonya quickly becomes one of the best [[Figure skating|figure skaters]] in the United States, but is unable to move beyond her "[[white trash]]" reputation, homemade costumes and unconventional choice of performance music. After repeatedly failing to receive the scores she deserves, a U.S. competition judge eventually admits that she does not fit the image that the establishment has always aimed at projecting. At 15, Tonya begins dating 18-year-old Jeff Gillooly, the first man who is nice to her, despite her mother's disapproval. Tonya marries Jeff in order to move out of her mother's home, but soon Jeff begins physically abusing her as well. LaVona scorns Tonya for putting up with the violence, but Tonya blames LaVona for raising her in an abusive environment.  Fed up with her coach Diane Rawlinson's attempts to make her appear more feminine and pristine at competitions, Tonya takes on a new coach and at the [[1991 Skate America]] she becomes the first female figure skater to complete two triple [[axel jump]]s in one competition. After her success, Tonya and Jeff's marriage hits rock bottom, and Tonya divorces him. At the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] Tonya fails to stick her landings and comes in fourth place. Defeated, she returns to Portland and takes a job as a waitress, but her first coach Diane convinces her to train for the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. Tonya visits her estranged mother who chastises her for seeking her help, claiming that she made her a champion, knowing she'd hate her for it. Needing someone to support her, Tonya moves back in with Jeff.  After Tonya's confidence is shaken by an anonymous death threat prior to a performance, Jeff realizes he can do the same to Tonya's main rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]], and enlists his friend Shawn Eckhardt, who later masquerades as Tonya's self-appointed "bodyguard," to help. Shawn, seeking notoriety and prestige, instead hires two inept crooks to attack Kerrigan after a practice session in [[Detroit]]. Kerrigan's knee is badly injured by Shane Stant, and both men involved are soon arrested. Eckhardt's bragging around town quickly leads the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to him. He points the finger at Jeff, who is horrified to learn that Eckhardt gave orders beyond sending death threats via letters. Tonya qualifies for the Olympic team amid the allegations that she was involved in Kerrigan's attack. Realizing that she will be found guilty by the association, she goes to the FBI and tells them what Jeff and Shawn did, who then show her written testimony to Jeff during the interview, and he races to her house to confront her. Tonya leaves him for good and he implicates her to the authorities, claiming she knew about the attack.  Back in Portland, Tonya finds herself in a [[media circus]]. LaVona visits Tonya and offers her kind words; she finally tells her she is proud of her and that she is on her side. However, when LaVona asks if Tonya knew anything about the attack, Tonya realizes her mother is wearing a recording device and ejects her from her home. Jeff, Eckhardt and Stant are all sentenced, with Tonya's trial postponed until after the Olympics. After a failed attempt at the triple axel, despite being given extensive wait time to fix her broken skate lace, Tonya comes in eighth place and Kerrigan wins the silver medal. Tonya avoids jail but is given three years probation, 500 hours of community service, and a $100,000 fine. She is also forced to withdraw from the 1994 World Figure Skating Championships and is banned from competitive figure skating for life. Heartbroken, she begs the judge to give her jail time rather than take away the one thing she knows how to do; the judge declines. Jeff acknowledges that he has ruined Tonya's career, changes his name and remarries. Tonya embraces her notoriety and becomes a boxer, while becoming a nurturing mother to a son.

Freyr, who is still reeling from the unsolved disappearance of his own son, Benni, while Benni was playing hide-and-seek with a friend, begins to see visions of Bernódus.  In the second plotline, married couple Katrin and Garðar (recovering from a recent estrangement), along with Katrin's best friend Líf, move to a small, abandoned city to renovate an old, decades-abandoned house to turn into a [[bed and breakfast]]. While exploring the area, Katrin stumbles upon an old cemetery, with one of the graves missing a headstone. She begins to experience paranormal incidents around the area, including seeing Bernódus's ghost near the creek along with the missing headstone and hearing strange sounds in the house, which cause her to fall down the stairs and sprain her foot. As the house gets no cell phone reception, the group is unable to call for help. Katrin also ventures into the house's cellar, where she finds the body of Bernódus, who is carrying a picture of his mother, who resembles Katrin. The group is shaken by the discovery, but are again unable to get into contact with others. Katrin refuses to stay in the house any longer, and they move to another unoccupied home nearby.  Freyr continues to experience his own strange incidents. Benni's autistic friend only reveals that Benni was last seen in a "green submarine." The seventh bully of Bernódus is found dead after an apparent suicide attempt, and Freyr finds dozens of newspaper clippings about Benni's disappearance in one of his rooms. Freyr also learns that the eighth bully was Úrsúla, a woman he knows who is suffering from [[schizophrenia]]. An addled Úrsúla tells him that Benni is "at the bottom" of "somewhere green," but Freyr is unable to get more out of her; a clairvoyant who claims to be in contact with Benni's ghost gives similar information. Meanwhile, Katrin learns that Garðar and Líf were having an affair during their estrangement, which leaves her feeling betrayed. However, Garðar and Líf are still in love, and while Katrin is away, they plan to run away together and abandon Katrin. As they discuss their feelings, they are attacked by what appears to be a young boy who throws a stone through their window before running away to a nearby whale house. Garðar and Líf give chase and encounter Bernódus's ghost inside. The chimney then collapses on top of both of them. Katrin discovers Garðar dead and Líf mortally wounded. Katrin runs to try to find cell phone reception to call for help using Líf's phone, but in doing so discovers that Líf was pregnant with Garðar's baby, and the two were planning to run away together. A devastated Katrin leaves without calling, and goes to sleep in the cellar with Bernódus's body.  Freyr awakens in the middle of the night and goes for a jog, where he once again sees Bernódus's ghost and gives chase. Bernódus leads him to a trapped Úrsúla, who claims that Bernódus is always with her; she reveals that she was the last one to see him before his disappearance, and saw him hiding in a boat, which she kept a secret for decades. Bernódus disembarked at the abandoned city, which held the grave of his late mother, whose headstone Katrin discovered; alone, he wandered around the empty house before perishing in the cellar. Meanwhile, Benni's friend draws a green submarine, which his mother sends to Dagny. In a moment of inspiration, Dagny realizes that what he is describing is not a submarine, but a [[septic tank]]. She examines the gas station footage where Benni was last seen, and the footage reveals Katrin, Garðar and Líf; they were carrying a septic tank with them to renovate the house with.   It is revealed that Katrin, Garðar and Líf's plotline took place years earlier. Garðar and Líf's bodies were discovered, but Katrin was never found. Dagny posits that Benni crawled inside the septic tank in the gas station while the three were inside having a meal and drowned. They make their way to the abandoned house, where Benni's body is found inside the septic tank. Devastated but finally having closure, Freyr sits inside the house. Something draws him to the cellar, where the bodies of Katrin and Bernódus lay, but he shuts its door without looking inside. He leaves with Benni's body, as the ghosts of Katrin and Bernódus hold hands and sadly watch him go.

The three are a happy, close family. Both are doctors, though Angela is on leave to be a full-time mom. A friend of Angela's, Linda, introduces Angela to Katie. Katie's four-year-old daughter Maddie hits it off with Cora. Katie says she left an abusive husband but does not elaborate. She also refuses to have her photo taken. Brian's mother, Donna, (Faye Dunaway) dislikes Katie from the start and questions her background, sensing something is off about her.  Angela confides to Katie she had trouble conceiving so she used an egg donor for Cora and is now pregnant again. Devastated after a miscarriage, she invites Katie to move into the guest house and be a part-time nanny while she recovers. One night, knowing Brian is watching, Katie steps naked into the pool. Brian becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Angela returns to work at the hospital part-time to give her more of a purpose, and Katie watches Cora.  Katie uses her free time in the house to go snoop through Angela and Brian's belongings, envious of their family. Angela comes home after work one day and catches Katie having sex in the guest house with whom she thinks is Brian, but is actually a woman (later revealed to be Linda). After the initial embarrassment, Angela relaxes somewhat and trusts Katie more, not believing she would ever have any interest in Brian. Linda excitedly tells Katie that Angela is going to ask Linda to be their surrogate, but Katie can barely hide how it upsets her.  Apparently Angela has one embryo left from the same donor that Cora was conceived from, and she wants to use that so the two can be full siblings. Katie confides to Linda that she is the donor, and that her daughter Maddie was also hers but born from a mother in Maine. Katie abducted Maddie as a baby because "the mother didn't take care of her" and now she worries that Cora is not getting enough attention either and wants to take her. She drowns Linda in a lake, and a couple later finds her body.  Four months later, Katie is carrying Angela and Brian's baby (and unknown to them, her own baby). Donna asks Angela what Katie get out of it. Angela says Katie will be paid forty thousand dollars and that she does not expect anything else.

As Katie's behavior gets stranger and more delusional – Angela catches Katie lying to a mother in a park about both girls being her twin daughters – Angela becomes more suspicious. Brian says everything will be fine when the baby comes, after which Katie will move on with her life.  A couple months later, Angela and Brian tell Katie they are getting a full-time nanny, and Katie angrily accuses them of wanting a complete stranger to raise their child. Brian defends her and says she just has different beliefs than them. It becomes clear that Angela and Brian are not as happy any more. Angela suspects Katie is planning to keep the baby and disappear, and accuses her of killing Linda because she wanted it for herself. Katie fakes early labor pains. Brian is furious with Angela and thinks she is taking meds and losing her mind.  The next morning, while Brian is at work, and Katie is sleeping in the girl's bed in the main house, Angela sneaks into the guest house to snoop and discovers Katie's secrets, confirming that she is mentally ill and she was a previous donor. Angela gets a DNA test for the girls but realizes that Katie has drugged her and rushes home, where she confronts Katie. Katie admits everything and stabs herself in the stomach, possibly harming the baby. Katie says she will tell everyone that Angela tried to kill her.  Katie is taken to the ER and an emergency C-section takes place. A healthy baby boy named Gabriel is born. But what is later revealed is that the DNA test came back and showed that Maddie and Cora were related to each other and to Katie, meaning Angela had told the truth.

 Tony Hanna is a [[Christianity in Lebanon|Lebanese Christian]] and devoted member of the Christian Party, with a pregnant wife, Shirine. Not wanting workers near his property when Shirine is there, Tony discovers contractors modifying the gutter on his balcony. Tony smashes the gutter, to which the worker Yasser Abdallah Salameh calls Tony a "fucking prick". Tony recognizes Yasser as a [[Palestinian refugee]] by his accent; he watches anti-Palestinian [[propaganda]] and wishes for all Palestinians to leave the country. Although the balcony was in violation of [[building codes]] and the workers were fixing it, Tony demands an apology for the "fucking prick" remark from the company. The employers bring Yasser to Tony's garage to apologize in person; but when Tony states he wishes Israeli statesman [[Ariel Sharon]] had exterminated all Palestinians, Yasser punches him instead, breaking two ribs.  Tony launches a lawsuit against Yasser, representing himself. However, when neither Yasser nor Tony can bring themselves to repeat what Tony said to Yasser about Sharon, the judge dismisses the case for inconclusive evidence. Enraged, Tony shouts the judge is corrupt and [[bias]]ed, and is removed from the courtroom but vows to appeal. He later collapses, and Shirine helps pull him up, later giving birth. The child is placed on life support, allegedly due to contractions Shirine experienced when she pulled up her husband and emotional shock at Yasser's assault. The case goes to [[retrial]], with Yasser risking guilt of manslaughter if the child dies.  Wajdi Wehbe, a pro-Christian with memories of the [[Lebanese Civil War]], becomes Tony's new representative, while Wajdi's own daughter, Nadine Wehbe, who has less memory of the war, takes Yasser's case. This time, Tony's comments about Sharon are placed before the court, with the argument that emotional distress provoked the assault; Shirine's history of [[miscarriage]]s is also revealed. The arguments in the courtroom inflame memories of the civil war, leading to clashes in the streets between Christians and Muslims. With Wajdi underlining the importance of Sharon, Tony finds himself accused of [[Zionism]] and begins receiving death threats. Wajdi also characterizes Tony's comments as private and merely expressing a "wish", arguing this is not libel but [[freedom of thought]].  In background research, Wajdi is surprised to learn Tony was born in [[Damour]] in 1970 and left in January 1976, a refugee of the [[Damour massacre]] when the city fell to Muslim and left-wing militants with help from [[Palestine Liberation Organisation]] units. Tony had not disclosed this to his own representation, and breaks down when Wajdi plays documentary footage of the event in the courtroom. Yasser and Tony later meet, and when Yasser says Christian suffering in the civil war was minimal compared to the Palestinians', Tony punches him and Yasser apologizes. Shirine and Tony's child recovers. Back at court, the judges find Yasser not guilty of assault.

It (2017 film)
  In October 1988, Bill Denbrough gives his seven-year-old brother, Georgie, a paper sailboat. Georgie sails the boat along the rainy streets of small town Derry, and is disappointed when it falls down a storm drain. As he attempts to retrieve it, Georgie sees a clown in the sewer, who introduces himself as [[It (character)|Pennywise the Dancing Clown]]. The clown entices Georgie to come closer, then severs his arm and drags him into the sewer.  The following summer, Bill and his friends—Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stan Uris—run afoul of older bully Henry Bowers and his gang. Bill, still haunted by Georgie's disappearance and the resulting neglect from his grief-stricken parents, discovers that his brother's body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He recruits his friends to investigate, believing his brother may still be alive. Ben Hanscom learns that the town has been plagued by unexplained tragedies and child disappearances for centuries. He is targeted by Bowers' gang, after which he flees into the Barrens and meets Bill's group. They find the sneaker of a missing girl, while a member of the pursuing Bowers Gang, Patrick Hockstetter, is killed by Pennywise while searching the sewers for Ben.  Beverly Marsh, a girl ostracized over rumors of promiscuity, also joins the group; both Bill and Ben develop feelings for her. Later, the group befriends Mike Hanlon after defending him from Bowers. All the while each member of the group has encountered terrifying phenomena in various forms; these include the same menacing clown who attacked Georgie, a headless boy, a fountain of blood, a diseased and rotting man, a creepy painting come to life, Mike's parents burning alive, and a phantom Georgie.  Now calling themselves "The Losers Club", they realize they are all being terrorized by the same entity. They determine that "It" assumes the appearance of what they fear, awakens every 27 years to feed on the children of Derry before returning to hibernation, and moves about by using sewer lines, which all lead to a well currently under the abandoned house at 29 Neibolt Street. After an attack by Pennywise, the group ventures to the house to confront him, only to be separated and terrorized. Eddie breaks his arm, while Pennywise gloats to Bill about Georgie. As they regroup, Beverly impales Pennywise through the head, forcing the clown to retreat. After the encounter, the group begins to splinter, with only Bill and Beverly resolute in fighting It.  Weeks later, after Beverly confronts and incapacitates her sexually abusive father, she is abducted by Pennywise. The Losers Club reassembles and travels back to the Neibolt house to rescue her. Henry Bowers, who has killed his father after being compelled into madness by It, attacks the group. Mike fights back and pushes Bowers down the well to his apparent death. The Losers descend into the sewers and find It's underground lair, which contains a mountain of decayed circus props and children's belongings, around which the bodies of missing children float in mid-air. Beverly, now catatonic after being exposed to It's true form, is restored to consciousness as Ben kisses her. Bill encounters Georgie, but recognizes that he is Pennywise in disguise. Pennywise attacks the group and takes Bill hostage, offering to spare the others if they let It keep Bill. The Losers reject this and reaffirm their friendship, overcoming their various fears. After a brief battle, they defeat Pennywise and it retreats, with Bill declaring that It will starve during its hibernation. Bill finally accepts his brother's death and is comforted by his friends.  As summer ends, Beverly informs the group of a vision she had while catatonic, where she saw them fighting the creature as adults. The Losers create a blood oath by cutting each other's hands and forming a circle, swearing to return to Derry in adulthood if It returns and destroy the creature once and for all. Stanley, Eddie, Richie, Mike, and Ben make their goodbyes as the group part ways. Beverly tells Bill she is leaving the next day to live with her aunt in Portland. As she leaves, Bill runs up to her and they kiss.

The stranger, Will, explains that he did not know the house was occupied and was only searching for fresh water for himself, his wife, and his young son. Will offers to trade some of their supply of food for water. Sarah suggests bringing Will's family back to their home, reasoning that the more people they have with them, the easier it would be to defend themselves should anyone else discover their location. Paul agrees, and he takes Will to collect his family. Along the way, they are ambushed by two men. Paul kills them and accuses Will of having set him up. Will points out that he fought them as well and assuages Paul's mistrust.  A few days later, Paul returns along with Will, his wife Kim, and son Andrew. After establishing the rules that Paul and Sarah have used to stay safe, including keeping the only entrance locked with a key Paul or Sarah wear around their neck, and keeping nighttime excursions to a minimum, the two families begin to establish a sense of normality and grow closer to each other. One day, Travis's dog Stanley begins barking aggressively at and chases an unseen presence in the woods. Travis follows the dog deeper into the woods before Stanley's barking suddenly ceases. Travis insists to Paul and Will that he heard something in the woods. They decide to return home, as Paul insists Stanley knows the woods and will find his own way home. That night, Will seemingly contradicts a story he had told Paul earlier about what he and Kim were doing prior to finding the abandoned house. Paul's response suggests an increasing level of distrust of Will.  That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather. He discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room, also suffering from a nightmare. Travis leads him back to his parents' room before hearing a sound from downstairs. Investigating, Travis finds that the front door of the house is slightly opened. He wakes Paul and Will, who investigate further and find a bleeding and gravely sick Stanley lying on the floor. They kill and burn the dog. When Travis reveals that the door was already open when he came downstairs, Sarah suggests that a sleepwalking Andrew might have opened the door.  Kim argues the possibility, and as tensions between the two families begin to rise, Paul decides that they should isolate themselves in their own rooms for a couple of days so that they can calm down and ensure no one is infected.  The next morning, Travis overhears a distraught Kim telling Will that they need to leave. Travis informs his parents that Andrew might be infected and, as such, he may be infected himself. Paul and Sarah don protective masks and gloves and take weapons to confront Kim and Will, fearing that they may steal their food and water, or return later by force. When Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive. Will insists that his family is healthy and demands Paul give him a fair share of food and water so that they can leave. Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will and force him and his family outside. Will and Paul get into a brutal fight before Sarah shoots Will, who dies from his wound. Kim flees into the woods with Andrew. Paul fires after them, killing Andrew. Kim hysterically begs Paul to kill her to end her misery, and he does.  Later, Travis awakens in bed, visibly sick. His mother comforts him as he dies. Some time later, Paul and Sarah, now both severely infected, sit at the dinner table in silence. They share a shattered, devastated look as the film cuts to black and ends.

He communicates with his associates using a [[Gmail]] account, by composing his messages, saving them as drafts and providing the login details to his associates, who login later and delete the drafts meant for them after reading. Thus, their IP addresses remains untraced. The police issue a red-alert across the country and issue an order to arrest Chotta, all over India. His photo is faxed to all the police stations, who begin their search.  Madhusoodhanan aka Madhu ([[Udhayanidhi Stalin]]) is a jobless software engineer, who recently lost his job due to recession. He is in love with Bhargavi ([[Manjima Mohan]]), a rich girl, who is under the care of her elder brother Dheena ([[R.K. Suresh]]), who is the Assistant Commissioner of Police. Dheena opposes their love primarily due to religion, while also not liking Madhu from first instance. Bhargavi urges Madhu that they should get register married before Dheena could stop them. Madhu being jobless, often borrows money from a notorious money lender, Kanthuvatti Murugan ([[Ravi Mariya]]) and fails to repay it on time. Hence, Murugan is in search of Madhu. Just before the day of his marriage, he borrows his friend's car and promises to return it soon.  Kulandai Velu (Soori) is a dubbing artist, who dubs for [[Chhota Bheem]] in Chennai. His wife lives in his native place and is expecting a child very soon. Kulandai promises to return to her soon, after completing the day's work. He starts heading to his native place late that night on his motorbike. Chotta meets Kulandai on the highway and asks for a lift. He obliges and also borrows Rs.200 to fill petrol at a petrol bunk for the bike. As they travel, they arrive near a police check post, who look for traffic violators. Chotta sees this and escapes thinking that they are looking for him. Kulandai is perplexed. After sometime, while Chotta asks for a lift from Madhu but he mistakenly hits Chotta and injures him. Madhu admits Chotta in a hospital and escapes from there, as he did not have enough money to pay the bill. Chotta also manages to escape the hospital and reaches his hideout place, a flat in an apartment building, owned by one of his associates, a lady who works as a manager, thus causing no doubts to anyone.  Meanwhile, the doctor, who treated Chotta in the hospital comes to know from the news that Chotta is a wanted terrorist and informs the police. The police collect the [[CCTV]] footage from the hospital and the highway, which contained Madhu and Kulandai providing lifts to Chotta. Hence, they corner and arrest both of them. While being taken to custody, they are hit by a jeep and are injured, causing Kulandai to forget his past. Madhu thinks that Kulandai must be a real associate of Chotta and if he can make Kulandai tell the police that Madhu is not involved in this case, then he can escape. However, he is shocked to see Kulandai having forgotten his past. The case is handled by Dheena, who now gets a good chance to reject Madhu, as he doubts that he is a terrorist. Dheena plans to kill both of them in an encounter, but Madhu and Kulandai manage to escape. With help from Bhargavi, they all hide in her friend's flat, which happens to be just below the flat in which Chotta is hiding, in the same apartment. Chotta plans his attack in two days and sends the bombs to his associates. He tells them that he will mention the locations one hour prior, using the draft communication.  Madhu and Bhargavi take Kulandai to a doctor, Thillai ([[M.S. Baskar]]) and try to regain his memory using hypnotherapy. Thillai successfully makes him regain his memory and he reveals that he too is innocent like Madhu. Madhu urges him to recall anything, while Kulandai gave lift to Chotta. Kulandai tells them that Chotta made a phone call from the petrol bunk's public phone and using lip reading, he manages to get the gmail username of Chotta and his associates. However, he could not get the password, as Chotta was turned the other side while saying that on the phone. With help from his friend in a telecom industry, Madhu gets the number to which Chotta made the call and tracks down the number to the same apartment in which they are currently staying at. He identifies Chotta and manages to grab him, but Chotta overpowers him and escapes. Madhu chases Chotta, but Chotta gets away with his female associate escapes in a car. Madhu throws his phone and manages to record a conversation between Chotta and his female associate. Chotta also delivers instructions to the bombers about the locations to be targeted via a draft from his Gmail account.  Madhu manages to get Chotta's laptop from the flat and they decide to go to the [[Police Commissioner]]'s office. Meanwhile, Bhargavi informs Dheena that Chotta and the female associate are escaping. Dheena starts to chase them in his car and manages to shoot down the female associate, killing her, while injuring Chotta. Dheena arrests Chotta and bring him to the Police Commissioner's Office. The police use [[narcotics]] to get the password from Chotta and Madhu successfully logs into his Gmail account. He finds out about the plan. Since Chotta instructed the bombers to check the mail just one hour prior to the attack, the draft message remains unchecked by the bombers. Madhu deletes the drafts sent by Chotta and sends a new location detail to all of the four bombers, which happened to be the same location. As all the four bombers receive the draft by the next day, they go to the location which is a bus and plant the bombs, only to find out they have been set up. The bus is filled with police officers in disguise, who are in undercover work. They immediately arrest the four bombers and deactivate the bombs. Madhu is hailed as a hero for saving the city. Dheena also approves Madhu and gets Bhargavi married to him. Madhu manages to build his dream home. Dheena and his co-officers were transporting Chotta and the four bombers at a jail, but Dheena and his co-officers decide to kill all of them, as they are terrorists and do not deserve to live.

According to Vikram's account, he fled from the police because he feared he would be [[Frameup|framed]] for his wife's murder. He found Maya at her door and asked for help. He added that his wife did not attend the book launch, as she was unwell and took medicines for a heart ailment. Vikram entered Maya's flat and said that she attempted to seduce him. Maya introduced Chirag, who entered her house saying he was her husband. When Vikram saw a wallpaper photo on her PC and realized Chirag was not Maya's husband, Chirag struck him with a candle-holder and Vikram lost consciousness.

Examination of Katherine's body reveals that she had died of a heart attack.  The forensic team informs Dev that Shekhar was attacked on the head by someone who was at least 6 feet tall. The police initially suspect Vikram as his height is 6’1”. However, it is found that the burnt photographs were those of Maya and Chirag, who is also about 6 feet tall. The photographs had been taken by a detective hired by Shekhar. The police eventually conclude that Vikram’s account is true and Maya and Chirag had killed Shekhar when he confronted them with the photos. Moreover, there was no mud on Shekhar's shoes at the time of his death. It had rained at 11 pm and there was mud on the streets. Vikram had stated that Shekhar had come home at 7:30, hence his account was believed to be true whereas Maya's account of his husband returning home at 12 am was labelled false as a result.

Dev calls Vikram while the latter is about to catch a flight back to [[London]]. On the phone, Vikram confesses to having killed Katherine and Shekhar. He killed Katherine because she was threatening to charge him for the suicide of Sandhya. Shekhar was the lawyer working with her to file a case against him. He fled to Shekhar's house to destroy the legal documents of the case. When Maya went out to seek help, he killed her husband and stumbled across the photographs with her lover. He burnt them and threw them in the trash, creating a convincing story to dupe the police. He tells Dev that he has already cremated his wife's body; thus there is no evidence left. He had changed Shekar's shoes. Dev decides to catch Vikram and punish him even if he has to take an illegal action to do so. However, Vikram leaves for London on his flight before he can be stopped.

Jason's Letter
   
Jeepers Creepers 3
 A [[shuriken]] flies through the air and hits a wooden post as a man runs for his life. When the man reaches the road, the Creeper drops from the sky and flies off with him, while another man watches from his truck. When he gets out to investigate, he looks up in the air and sees a machete fall from the sky, followed by a severed hand.  Twenty-three years later, shortly after the events of the [[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|first film]], the police discover the Creeper's truck filled with dead bodies. The truck has been rigged with several booby-traps, including spikes that emerge from the bed of the truck, and a spear that shoots out from the tail-pipe. When Sheriff Dan Tashtego arrives, Sergeant Davis Tubbs tells him what happened and Tashtego informs him that the Creeper has been around for thousands of years and must be stopped. They then rush to get the Creeper's truck back after learning it is headed for the impound.  As Frank and Deputy Lang transport the vehicle, the Creeper lands on the tow truck and severs the cables. They then watch as the truck drives off seemingly on its own, while the Creeper stands on top of it. When the truck returns, the Creeper abducts Frank while Lang stands frozen in fear. The next day, Gaylen Brandon sees a vision of her son Kenny, who was killed by the Creeper twenty-three years earlier. He warns her that the Creeper will return soon to uncover something buried on the property and will kill anyone who is still there, including her and her granddaughter, Addison, when it does.  Meanwhile, Tashtego informs Tubbs that he has put together a small team to hunt down the Creeper and kill it once and for all. Later, a group of teenagers discover the Creeper's truck in a field. After finding the bodies, they take off on dirt bikes, but Kirk is shot in the leg with the spear. As two of the other boys try to free him, the Creeper returns and kills them both with another spear. The last boy is abducted by the Creeper as he tries to escape after peeing on the Creeper's truck.  Later, Addison goes into town to buy hay for her horse. When she can't pay for it, her friend Buddy helps her out and the two drive to a plantation house to deliver more hay. There they find the owner and a couple of men hiding under cars, but before they can get help the Creeper arrives and abducts Addison, leaving Buddy traumatized. Gaylen discovers a sack containing the Creeper's severed hand buried in her front yard, and when she touches it she goes into a hypnotic state.  When Tashtego and Tubbs arrive with the team, she reveals that the hand contains secrets about the Creeper's origins, and Tashtego decides to touch it to uncover a way to kill it. Addison wakes up in the Creeper's truck with Kirk, and together they try to find a way out, but when Kirk reaches for the door handle a metal pipe shoots out and impales him in the head.  Meanwhile, Tashtego and Tubbs discover the Creeper's location, and they head off to find him, along with Michael (who has a machine gun attached to his truck). They find the Creeper driving down the highway in his truck, but when they shoot at it, the bullets deflect, and Michael is killed. A small explosive is ejected from the bottom of the Creeper's truck, and when it goes off, Tashtego and Tubbs' car lands in a field. Tubbs gets out and tries to shoot the Creeper, but all of his attempts fail. However, before the Creeper can kill Tubbs, Tashtego calls him and he goes for him instead. When the Creeper jumps into the air, Tashtego shoots him several times with the machine gun, but the bullets have no effect and he is tackled to the ground and struck in the head with an axe.   That night, the Creeper discovers that Addison is still alive, but before he can kill her, she causes the metal pipe to shoot out and impale him in the head. She quickly escapes and runs through a field, and the Creeper throws a shuriken which barely misses her head. He then throws a spear at her, which also barely misses her. He tries one last time to hit her with an axe, but he is hit by a truck. The axe lands directly at her feet and Addison runs away, leaving the weapon on the ground. When the truck driver gets out to see what happened, he is killed by the Creeper. Addison runs and hides in a field where she is found by Gaylen and Buddy and the three leave together. The Creeper later returns to Gaylen's house where he finds a sign that says 'We know what you are', along with the hand, and yells out in anger.  The next day, Addison says goodbye to Buddy before he leaves for a high school basketball game in the same bus that is attacked by the Creeper in the [[Jeepers Creepers 2|second movie]]. Twenty-three years later, Trish Jenner is seen reading a letter she presumably wrote on a computer calling for people to fight against the Creeper when it returns, and vows to get revenge on the Creeper for the death of her brother, Darry.

Jigsaw (2017 film)
  Criminal Edgar Munsen is pursued by the police onto a rooftop, where he activates a triggering mechanism before being shot non-fatally by Detective Halloran and his fellow officers.   Meanwhile, five people, Mitch, Anna, Ryan, Carly, and an unconscious man are held captive in a barn, each with a metal noose around their neck. A tape recording from [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]] explains they must give a sacrifice of blood and will need to confess their sins. The chains begin pulling them towards a wall of buzzsaws. Most of the group survives by cutting themselves on the blades as an offering of blood, but the unconscious man awakens and is seemingly killed.  The next test divulges that Carly caused the death of an asthmatic woman by stealing her purse, which had her emergency inhaler inside. To save the others from being hanged, she must inject herself with one of three needles–one containing an antidote to a poison in her system, one a saline solution, and one a potent acid. Ryan eventually stabs Carly with all three to save himself, melting her face and killing her.  Halloran and Detective Keith Hunt begin investigating the discovery of bodies that appear to belong to the unnamed man and Carly. Halloran becomes suspicious of [[pathology|forensic pathologists]] Logan Nelson, a war veteran and former doctor whose wife was killed two years prior, and Eleanor Bonneville. Munsen is kidnapped from the hospital by an unseen assailant. When the police commissioner orders Kramer's grave be exhumed, Munsen is found inside with his throat slit.  Ryan tries escaping through a door marked "No Exit", and is trapped by wires that ensnare his leg. Anna and Mitch discover an unlocked door, and are trapped inside a [[silo|grain silo]]. A taped message explains they will be [[grain entrapment|buried in grain]] and killed by falling debris unless Ryan pulls a lever that will free him from the wires around his leg. Anna and Mitch survive, but Ryan's leg is severed when he pulls the lever. Logan and Eleanor speak about their mutual distrust of Halloran. Eleanor takes Logan to her "studio" where she reveals that she is an obsessive [[Fandom|fangirl]] of the Jigsaw case, and has built replicas of Kramer's traps. She's worried her obsession might incriminate her. Hunt has followed them, and informs Halloran of the studio.  The next test reveals Mitch knowingly sold a motorcycle with a faulty brake to Kramer's nephew, resulting in his death. Mitch will be lowered into a spiral-shaped blade unless he can reach for a brake lever. Though fellow group-member Anna attempts to help him, he is shredded by the blade and killed. Halloran calls for Eleanor and Logan's arrest after a corpse appearing to belong to Mitch is discovered in the studio. Logan convinces Hunt to let them go, as both suspect Halloran to be responsible. Eleanor has deduced the game's location, and she and Logan depart for the barn. Halloran pursues them.  Meanwhile, Hunt finds [[Jigsaw puzzle|puzzle-piece]] shaped pieces of human flesh in Halloran's freezer, fitting Jigsaw's [[Modus operandi|M.O.]] and implicating Halloran as a [[copycat crime|copycat killer]].  Anna attempts to slip through a doorway to freedom, only to be captured. She finds herself and Ryan chained in a room with a hooded figure, who is revealed to be a still-living John Kramer. Kramer reveals that Anna suffocated her infant in a fit of rage and blamed it on her sleeping husband by planting the body next to him. Her husband later committed suicide, thinking he accidentally smothered his own baby. It is also revealed that Ryan accidentally caused the death of several of his friends years prior in a car accident but managed to escape blame. Kramer tells them they have gotten his message "backwards". He places a loaded shotgun between them and tells them it is the "key" to their survival. Anna attempts to shoot Ryan, but the gun, which is revealed to be rigged, backfires and instead kills her. Ryan realizes that the keys to his and Anna's chains were in the gun, and were destroyed when Anna pulled the trigger, leaving no hope of escape.  Logan and Eleanor investigate the barn, but are ambushed by Halloran. Eleanor escapes, and Halloran is drugged by an unseen assailant. Logan and Halloran awaken in collars rigged with [[Laser cutting|laser cutters]]. They are told they must confess their sins to survive and may choose who goes first. Halloran forces Logan to go first. Logan confesses that he mislabeled Kramer's X-Rays years prior, which caused his cancer to go undiagnosed until it was too late. Despite confessing, Logan appears to die. Halloran is tested next. He admits to having allowed criminals to walk free for personal gain, and his collar deactivates.  Logan reveals he had faked his death and that the barn game in fact took place [[Nonlinear narrative|ten years ago]]. He was the man who appeared to die in the first game, but Kramer, feeling he should not die because of an honest mistake, saved him and recruited him. The bodies that were found were actually the bodies of criminals Halloran allowed to walk free that Logan placed in similar tests to the test that he had faced. Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals Halloran let go, was responsible for murdering his wife. However, because Halloran broke the rules to force Logan to go first, he will die and be framed as the Jigsaw copycat. Logan reactivates the laser collar around Halloran's neck which slices his head apart, killing him. Logan then declares he speaks for the dead.

John dispatches Tarasov's men in a violent rampage that heavily damages the Mustang. He then spares Tarasov under the auspices of peace, and returns home.  After Aurelio takes John's Mustang for repairs, John is visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio. It is revealed that to complete his "impossible task"—which allowed him to retire and marry Helen—John asked Santino for help. As a form of contract, Santino swore John to a "Marker," an unbreakable promise symbolized by a "blood oath" medallion.<ref></ref> Santino presents the medallion to demand services from John, but John declines, claiming that he is retired. In retaliation, Santino destroys John's house with a grenade launcher.  Winston, the owner of The Continental Hotel in [[New York City]], reminds John that if he rejects the Marker, he will be violating one of the two unbreakable rules of the underworld: no killing on Continental grounds, and Markers must be honored. John accepts his commitment and meets with Santino, who tasks him with assassinating his sister Gianna, so he can claim her seat on the "High Table," a council of high-level crime lords. Santino sends Ares, his mute personal bodyguard, to surveil John.  In [[Rome]], John infiltrates Gianna's coronation party and confronts her. Faced with certain death, Gianna chooses to take her own life by [[Suicide methods#Wrist cutting|slitting her wrists]]. After Gianna dies, John shoots her in the head to ensure her death and, consequently, fulfillment of the Marker. Cassian, Gianna's bodyguard, recognizes John and, after realizing that John was sent to kill Gianna, attacks him. John escapes to the catacombs, where he is ambushed by Santino's henchmen, who intend to "tie up loose ends" by killing him. After killing most of the henchmen, John is pursued by Cassian. Their battle is halted when they crash into the reception area of the Rome Continental, which—like the New York Continental—prohibits any "business" on its grounds. As the two share a tense drink, Cassian vows revenge for Gianna's death.  After John returns to New York City, Santino opens a $7 million [[Contract killing|contract]] for John's death under the guise of avenging his sister, leading numerous assassins to attack John. Cassian confronts John once again in the subway. John wins the fight, but leaves Cassian alive out of professional respect. Injured and desperate, John seeks help from an underground crime lord, the Bowery King, whose subordinates treat his injuries and guide him to Santino's location. John kills Santino's bodyguards and defeats Ares in a knife fight, but Santino is able to escape to the Continental. Santino smugly makes it clear that he intends to remain indefinitely in its sanctuary. Despite Winston's warnings, John shoots and kills Santino in the Continental lounge.  The next day, Winston sends for John and explains that, per the High Table, the contract on John has been doubled and offered globally. As a consequence of killing Santino on Continental grounds, Winston declares John "[[excommunication|excommunicado]]" from the Continental, losing all access and privileges to the Continental's underworld resources. However, Winston delays announcing John's excommunication and global bounty by one hour to give him a head start, and provides him with a Marker for future use. Before leaving, John advises Winston to make it known that whoever tries to come after him will be killed. As John and his dog run through the park, dozens of cellphones around him ring, signaling that the global contract has been activated.

Josuke's act of healing Okuyasu is awarded when the latter helps him rescue Koichi while not intending to stand in their way of searching for the bow and arrow. Keicho goes on the offense in forcing Koichi to manifest his Stand, disappointed that it is a large egg, before being defeated with Josuke and Koichi finding an immortal abomination soon after. Keicho reveals the creature to be his father whose condition is the result of being a follower of Dio Brando, explaining that he has been creating Stand Users in the hopes that one of them might be able to end his father's suffering. Josuke, deducing that Mr. Nijimura has not completely lost his sense of self by repairing a family photograph that he was looking for, offers to help the Nijimura brothers restore their father's humanity despite Keicho being hesitant to hand the bow and arrow to him. But the group are suddenly attacked by another Stand, with Keicho sacrificing himself to protect Okuyasu. Josuke later meets again with Jotaro, swearing to continue his grandfather's work of protecting Morioh as Koichi and Okuyasu proceed to support him.  In a mid credits scene, a house is shown with a paper bag on a table, containing a severed hand inside. In the clutch of the severed hand is an arrow.

Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back
 The monk [[Tang Sanzang]] ([[Kris Wu]]) finds himself as a giant in a city in [[Tianzhu (India)|India]]. His master congratulates him on reaching India and retrieving the [[Sutra#Buddhism|Sutra]]s, and gives him a halo as a reward. The halo, however, malfunctions and Tang awakes from his dream to find himself in an alley in a village of circus performers with his three disciples: [[Sun Wukong]] ([[Lin Gengxin]]); [[Zhu Bajie]] ([[Yang Yiwei]]); and [[Sha Wujing]] ([[Mengke Bateer]]). Tang encourages Sun Wukong to perform for the villagers, but the disciple refuses. Angered by this stubbornness, Tang provokes Sun Wukong by calling him a "bad monkey", which causes Sun Wukong to smash the village and damage the villagers' homes in his temper. The terrified villagers present the group with money and food for their travels, but Sun Wukong continues wreaking havoc, sending Zhu Bajie and Tang flying through the air. That night, Tang whips Sun Wukong for his disobedience.  The next morning, Tang goes to find water for their breakfast [[congee]] and comes across a house. Its host, a beautiful woman in a splendid outfit ([[Wang Likun]]), welcomes them all in for breakfast with her companions. Sun Wukong, however, sees through their disguises as spider demons; he purposely provokes them, until she and the others show their true form. During the subsequent battle, the demons come together to form one huge spider. After being poisoned by the spider, Sha Wujing falls ill and slowly bloats into a fish-like creature. Sun Wukong defeats the spider and Tang attempts to exorcise her, but Sun Wukong smashes in the demon's head with one blow. Once more, Tang is annoyed at Sun Wukong's disobedience and whips him again that evening. Later that night, the enraged Sun Wukong discusses with the other disciples his plans to kill Tang, but the others fear Tang's mighty Buddha Palm powers. Tang overhears this conversation and prays to Buddha to help him and also confesses that he actually does not know, or have, Buddha Palm powers. Zhu Bajie overhears this admission and tells Sun Wukong, who challenges Tang to a fight. Just as Sun Wukong is about to strike, a blinding ray of light shines from the heavens and he retreats.  The next day, the group pass into the capital city of the [[Bhikku|Biqiu]] Kingdom and a minister ([[Yao Chen]]) comes out to greet them and bring them to see the king: an immature and childlike man who likes to play games. The king orders Tang to perform for him but the monk doesn't have anything to showcase. Sun Wukong therefore pastes an "obedience sticker" on Tang allowing Tang to copy his actions and perform stunts for the king. Sun Wukong, however, goes too far and makes Tang slap the king continuously, who throws them all out. Tang orders Sun Wukong to return and apologize, but it is revealed that Sun Wukong purposely provoked the king to make him reveal his form as the demon [[Red Boy]]. They fight and Sun Wukong defeats Red Boy, also freeing the true king of Biqiu ([[Bao Bei'er]]) from his cage under the throne. As a reward for helping him, the king presents them with a beautiful girl, Felicity ([[Lin Yun]]), to accompany them on their travels. As Felicity dances for them, Tang is reminded of his deceased lover, Ms Duan ([[Shu Qi]]).  The group set off and on the way, Sun Wukong realizes that Felicity is actually a demon. Tang, however, does not believe him, so they set off to visit Felicity's home village. Sun Wukong becomes enraged with Tang's lack of trust in him and that night he destroys the whole village, killing everyone. Tang stops him from killing Felicity, further angering Sun Wukong, who attacks Tang, but Felicity finally confesses that she is actually the demon [[Baigujing|White Bone Spirit]] and that the whole village was an illusion conjured by her. Sun Wukong flares up and turns into a giant gorilla and swallows Tang. At that moment, the minister and Red Boy arrive and see that Monkey has fallen for their trick.  They had deliberately sent Felicity with the group to cause strife between Tang and Sun Wukong, so Sun Wukong would kill his master. Sun Wukong spits Tang out, however, as they had, in fact, known this all along, but played along with story, so that the minister would reveal her true form. They battle and the minister creates an illusion of Buddhas surrounding Monkey, using them to fight him. The real Buddha, however, uses his giant palm to destroy the false Buddhas and reveals the minister's real identity as the Immortal Golden Vulture.  After the battle, Tang heads back to find Felicity. He has no choice but to free her soul as there is too much demon in her. When Felicity asks Tang if he loves her, Tang replies that he has only one person in his heart. The animosity between Tang and Sun Wukong has finally dissolved; Sha Wujing sneezes out the poison and turns back to his human form. All three along with Zhu Bajie continue their journey to the West through a desert.  
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle
  In 1996 in Brantford, [[New Hampshire]], teenager Alex Vreeke receives the Jumanji [[board game]] which was found by his father on a beach after it was thrown over a bridge by Alan Parrish and Sarah Whittle 27 years earlier. Alex sets the game aside. That night, it transforms into a [[video game]] [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] which catches Alex's attention when he is awakened by the Jumanji drums and he is transported into the game.  Twenty years later, in 2016, four Brantford High School students serve detention: Spencer Gilpin, caught writing an essay for former friend Anthony "Fridge" Johnson (also in detention); Bethany Walker, who answered a video call during an English-class quiz and Martha Kaply, who refused to participate in [[Physical education|gym class]]. They are sent to the school basement to prepare magazines for recycling and to think about their future. Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video-game system when he explores the basement, and he and Spencer set up the game. Although it has five [[Avatar (computing)|playable characters]], the first one cannot be selected. Spencer and Fridge choose two characters, and the girls choose their own. When Spencer presses "Start", they are transported into the game.  They are in a jungle, in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is tough, muscular [[exploration|explorer]] and [[archaeology|archaeologist]] Smolder Bravestone; Fridge is diminutive [[zoology|zoologist]] Franklin "Mouse" Finbar, whom he chose after misreading "Mouse" as "Moose"; Bethany is a [[obesity|chubby]] male [[Cartography|cartographer]] and intellectual Sheldon "Shelly" Oberon (whose nickname she mistook for a woman's), and Martha is beautiful [[commando]] and [[martial arts]] expert Ruby Roundhouse. They each have [[Life (gaming)|three lives]]; Spencer deduces that if they lose all three, they die in real life.   They learn the game's story from [[Non-player character|NPC]] Nigel: corrupt archeologist Russel Van Pelt stole the Jaguar's Eye (a magic jewel) from its shrine, cursing Jumanji. Nigel escaped Van Pelt with the jewel, and the players must return it to a [[jaguar]] statue and call "Jumanji" to lift the curse. Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanji's animals. They begin tackling the game's increasingly-difficult "[[Level (video gaming)|levels]]", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex (the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough). Taking shelter in a jungle house built by Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home. They break into a transportation shed, commandeering a [[helicopter]] to fly to the jaguar statue and return the jewel, but Fridge drops the jewel into a herd of [[white rhinoceros]]. Spencer uses one of Fridge's lives, pushing him out of the helicopter as a distraction, and retrieves the jewel. Alex loses his last life when a [[mosquito]] bites him, but Bethany performs [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and transfers one of her lives to him.  At the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelt's forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha (trapped in a pit of [[mamba]]s) and demands the jewel, but she sacrifices one of her lives to re-spawn and get it to Spencer. With the players on their last lives, they end the game with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of [[rat]]s and return to the real world, but Alex does not appear with them. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, having had returned to where he left off in 1996. Now married with children, he named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life and introduces them to his infant son, Andy.  Spencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany begins caring for others more than herself and plans a summer [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] adventure, Martha and Spencer become romantically involved and the four are now friends after their experiences in the game. When they hear Jumanji's drumbeats, they bring the game behind the school and Fridge destroys it with a [[bowling ball]] (also found in detention) to prevent anyone from playing it again.

One night, on their way back home after dining out, they are interrupted by Amit Shellar ([[Rohit Roy]]), a local goon and younger brother of Madhavrao Shellar ([[Ronit Roy]]), a well-known politician. He and his friend Wasim, drunkenly misbehave with the couple, enraging Rohan, and they have a heated exchange.  The next morning while Rohan is at work, Amit and Wasim sneak into the house and [[gang rape]] Supriya. A horrified Rohan immediately calls the police; Officer Chaubey advises him to get his wife medically examined in 24 hours to prove the assault. While Rohan and Supriya are on their way to the clinic, they are kidnapped by Shellar's men and held captive for 36 hours. After being set free, Rohan and Supriya are criticised by police for the delay in getting Supriya clinically examined, and both are accused of being liars. Heartbroken, they return home. Supriya attempts to live normally but Rohan becomes silent and introspective, which hurts her.  One morning, Rohan returns early from work to apologise to Supriya for not being as supportive as he should have, only to find her corpse, hanging from the ceiling fan. Madhavrao visits Rohan and reveals that his brother Amit raped Supriya not once but twice. Rohan finds Supriya's [[braille]] note, which ascertains that Amit had raped her a second time; this second assault led to her suicide. Shattered, Rohan changes. He implies to Officer Chaubey that he will avenge his wife's death, challenging that Chaubey will know who did it but will be able to do nothing about it, just like he did nothing about Supriya's rape.  Rohan uses his voice modulating skills to lure the culprits to places that Rohan knows well. First, he tricks Wasim and hangs him, leaving Amit's handkerchief behind to frame Amit. He then lures Amit to the warehouse where he and Supriya were held captive for 36 hours. He finds Amit by scent, tying him down to be burned alive in an explosion.  Officer Chaubey suspects Rohan for Amit and Wasim's murders after remembering his challenge, and puts him under [[house arrest]]. It is revealed that Chaubey knew Amit raped Supriya but did nothing after Madhavrao bribed him. Rohan gets past police with the help of his friend, and calls Madhavrao to a building under construction that was to be Rohan and Supriya's new home. There, Rohan kills him and makes it look like a suicide. Rohan later relates the story to Chaubey: he made it look as if Amit killed Wasim, then Madhavrao committed suicide due to the pain of Amit's death. With no evidence against Rohan, a blind man, Chaubey stands helpless. Rohan, his revenge complete, scatters Supriya's ashes at sea.

When both parties are caught cheating, Constantine summons Etrigan — a demon forced to share a body with Jason Blood — to dispatch the demons. Afterwards, Blood reprimands Constantine for making him summon Etrigan, and the two part ways.  In [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], [[Gotham City|Gotham]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], violent murders are committed by people who think their victims are demonic creatures before they are stopped by members of the [[Justice League]]. The League conclude that magic is the source of the crimes, but [[Batman]] is skeptical. However, at [[Wayne Manor]], Batman is briefly possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] and left with a single word ("Constantine") as a message. Batman finds [[Zatanna]], who had a failed romantic history with Constantine, and Deadman possesses Batman once more to tell Zatanna that she and Batman need to see Constantine. The trio is attacked by a magically controlled tornado as they travel to meet Constantine at the House of Mystery. The group is joined by [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]], the spiritual embodiment of the House, and decide to investigate the cause behind these supernatural occurrences.  The heroes visit [[Ritchie Simpson]], friend of Constantine and Zatanna, where they find [[Death (personification)|shroud spirits of Death]] waiting to collect Ritchie's soul upon his upcoming demise. Simpson has cancer and is resentful towards Constantine for abandoning him to his fate, but loans them the Keshanti Key. Constantine and Zatanna use the key to view one of the victim's memories and discover he was possessed by an unknown entity. A magical creature is conjured to consume the man, but Batman, Deadman, Constantine and Zatanna narrowly escape and destroy it.   Back at Ritchie's house, the team finds him close to death; Blood is also there to find the Dreamstone. Constantine chases after Blood while Batman gives an adrenaline shot to revitalize Ritchie. Upon being caught by Constantine, Blood explains that centuries ago the sorcerer [[Doctor Destiny|Destiny]] possessed the Dreamstone in an attempt to overthrow Great Britain, using it to make people see their worst nightmares and feed off their torment. Blood was mortally injured cleaving the Dreamstone in half. [[Merlin (DC Comics)|Merlin]] summoned Etrigan to defeat Destiny and then bound him to Blood because Merlin knew they would be needed in the future. Ritchie briefly wakes to claim [[Felix Faust]] as his assailant.  With the help of the plant [[elemental]] [[Swamp Thing]] (Alec Holland), the group locates Faust's Observatory of the Cosmos. After a battle with the wizard, which Faust loses, the team conclude Faust had no involvement in hurting Ritchie. Ritchie awakens and is revealed to have the other piece of the Dreamstone, which has been keeping his cancer in remission; he apparently destroys Black Orchid. Constantine tries to reason with Ritchie, that the Dreamstone (with Destiny's soul trapped inside) is using him. However, the Dreamstone takes over Ritchie's body and transforms him into Destiny.  Destiny destroys the House and departs to start a frenzy; Zatanna saves the group, but passes out from the exertion. The Justice League tries to fight Destiny, but he causes them to perceive each other as demonic threats, so they attack each other. Etrigan attacks Destiny, but is separated back into Jason Blood and Etrigan. Constantine summons Swamp Thing, who attacks Destiny, while Batman and Zatanna disable the Justice League. Destiny rips Alec Holland's corpse from Swamp Thing, causing him to dissolve into plant matter.  Constantine tricks Destiny into bringing him and Deadman within his protective shield, allowing Deadman to wound Destiny. Blood, Constantine and Batman destroy the Dreamstone (and Destiny's body), and Ritchie's soul is dragged to [[Hell (DC Comics)|Hell]]. Blood succumbs to his mortal wounds, and his body is buried near the place of his old village by Zatanna, Constantine and Etrigan. Zatanna agrees to join the League and offers Constantine a position as well. He declines, claiming Batman would not approve, but Zatanna states it was Batman's idea. The two return to the now-rebuilt House of Mystery, and Deadman joins the restored Black Orchid as her soulmate.

During conversation Karl claims the existence of an Indian tribe in the jungle that they should go see. Karl says everything will be okay because he knows the jungle and he's friends with the tribe. Yossi, excited about the prospect of exploring the jungle, chooses to believe him. He heads back to the apartment to convince Marcus and Kevin to come along. Being skeptical of the stranger and his story, they refuse. Yossi continues to press them and they ultimately acquiesce.  The next day they meet Karl in a shop while he is gathering supplies for the hike. All three men are surprised when Karl leaves with the supplies and tells them they will pay for everything.

Arriving there, Kevin called for the help of the local authorities to find Yossi. They failed to find Yossi through a plane flyover, but Kevin believes that Yossi is alive. Kevin ropes in the help of the local boat driver to search for him. Kevin finally discovers a now-weak Yossi and takes him to Rurrenabaque.  The epilogue says that Karl and Marcus were never seen again and Karl was wanted by the authorities.

Shocked and fascinated, Gábor helps Aryan flee the camp and makes him an offer: Gábor will bring Aryan to Budapest, where he will play a [[faith healing|spiritual healer]] and use Aryan as an assistant who will show off his new talents to impress their patients/victims. They will share the money earned and once they made enough money, Gábor will help Aryan find his father.  The first healing sessions are successful and they make a lot of money. But László, who also knows about Aryan's abilities, is closely following both using the help of the police forces. They manage to escape the police several times with the help of Vera.   When Aryan goes to the illicit refugee camp at [[Budapest Keleti railway station]], where his father had told him to meet up in case they were separated, he notices the other refugee who stole their papers. That other refugee is part of a terrorist plot to bomb the [[Budapest Metro]]. When Aryan follows the terrorist, Gábor loses contact with him. Both Aryan and the terrorist enter a subway and seconds later the bomb that the terrorist carried explodes, killing dozens of people, but Aryan is not wounded badly. He leaves the subway and floats to the roof of a nearby apartment building, being watched by a shocked woman.   After losing Aryan, thinking he has died, and finding out that Aryan's father has died, Gábor feels deep remorse for exploiting Aryan. He goes to the family of the man his medical malpractice killed and gives them his money as a bribe. When they refuse the money, he sincerely asks for forgiveness for his mistake and leaves.  When he returns to the place of the terrorist attack he notices a woman who prays for an "angel" who "flew to the sky". Gábor correctly deduces that Aryan floated onto the roof of a building and finds him there. Gábor tells him that his father has died, they embrace, and Gábor brings Aryan back to the hospital to tend to his wounds, asking Vera for help again. But since the terrorist used the Dashnis' papers, everyone believes Aryan to be one of the terrorists. So Vera calls the police. Gábor and Aryan manage to flee after a car chase and after Aryan uses his abilities again.   They take refuge in a hotel. When Gábor goes outside to get help from another medic, he is betrayed and apprehended by László. He tells the police where they can find Aryan and is brought to the hotel. But inside the hotel, Gábor manages to set off the fire alarm and during the chaos, manages to capture one of the police officers. He forces the rest of the police to hand Aryan over to him and tries to flee with him in an elevator, but is shot several times when he lets the other police officer go. When Aryan is cornered in a hotel hallway by László, Gábor arrives in time to threaten László with a gun and give Aryan time to jump through a window and float away. Gábor dies and László runs to the window to shoot Aryan, but lowers his weapon after hesitating. The final scene shows hundreds of people looking to the sky in amazement.

He also makes Abdul and Kalpana reveal their side of the story and also gets that telecasted along with a video showing Dheeran assaulting him at the Zen One TV studio. With Zen One TV as well as Dheeran now exposed, Kalyan decides to take revenge on Thilak by orchestrating a bomb blast with the help of Dheeran at the District Collector's Office and putting the blame on Abdul, who was present at the Collector's Office minutes before the bomb exploded, thereby sensationalising it as a "terrorist attack". He also frames Thilak, Malar and Muthamizh TV as co-conspirators, leading to Muthamizh TV being blacked out by the [[Government of India|Central Government]]. Undaunted, Thilak, who is on the run, manages to capture a video of Abdul revealing that he was not involved in any terrorist attack and was framed by Dheeran and Zen One TV. Thilak also records a video showing Ashok and the police orchestrating a fake encounter to kill Abdul. He manages to get both the videos telecasted on Zen One TV itself with the help of Jagan and the other 2 colleagues (who have rejoined Zen One TV as part of Thilak's plan to expose Kalyan and Dheeran) as well as his former boss Pillai ([[Pandiarajan]]), the Chief Editor at Zen One TV who had long suffered in silence against the atrocities committed by the Zen One management.  Having being exposed completely, Kalyan and Dheeran, who are at the Muthamizh TV studio, boldly admit their crimes to Thilak and defend themselves, but unfortunately for them, their confession is recorded by the Police Commissioner ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]), who was working incognito in Muthamizh TV. Kalyan and Dheeran are arrested. Thilak, Mayilvaganan, Malar, Jagan, Pillai and the other 2 colleagues celebrate their victory.

Kidnap (2017 film)
 Karla Dyson ([[Halle Berry]]), a diner waitress, lives a mostly perfect life as a single mother with her six-year-old son Frankie (Sage Correa) despite fighting a custody battle/court order with her estranged husband.  One day, Karla takes Frankie to the local carnival. Upon entering, she temporarily leaves her son, in order to take an important phone call from the divorce lawyer she is working with. But when Karla comes back, she finds that her son is missing, leaving his toy voice recorder behind. Frantically searching for her son, Karla sees a woman dragging Frankie aggressively into a green [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang]] and, while the car is driving away, she clings at the side of the car trying to stop them, losing her phone in the process. Karla drives her car and chases the other one, with an ensuing lengthy chase.  However, with her phone lost, she tries to get help from nearby motorists, but the attempt is thwarted by the kidnappers. Karla is then forced to take another route after the woman threatens to kill her son. Not giving up on rescuing her son, Karla chases the green car again.  Karla hears the abductor's voice from her son's toy voice recorder, revealing the abductor's name Margo, who claims that Karla is looking for her son (despite all attempts to discourage her). She then sees a police motorcycle several meters behind her, and sways her car from side to side, successfully gaining the police officer's attention. The abductors' car slams the police motorcycle into Karla's car, apparently knocking the police officer unconscious.  Upon stopping at a grassy field, Karla confronts the male driver of the green car and demands he release her son, as long as she gives her money to the abductors. However, Margo gets out of the car and forces Karla to ride with her, who claims that they will get $10,000 ransom in exchange for her son upon reaching their destination. Margo orders Karla to follow her accomplice's car.  Upon reaching a tunnel, Margo attacks her, but Karla manages to subdue her and throws her out of the car. Karla puts on Margo's shirt, fooling the second abductor temporarily as she exits the tunnel.  Having realized that the driver is not Margo, Karla is forced not to follow the car after the second abductor threatens to drop Frankie out onto the dangerous highway. After Karla loses them for several minutes, she spots a traffic jam, drives ahead of it, and finds the kidnappers' car abandoned after it caused a collision. One of the motorists tells her he saw the man and the boy emerge from the car and Karla drives after them in the direction which he gives.  Karla stops at the police station to report the incident; however, on seeing posters of young children who have been missing for a decade, and fearing that her son will likewise disappear for good, she continues the chase on her own. Karla eventually finds the abductor - who has now stolen a black [[Volvo]] - and chases him until she finally runs out of fuel. Karla quickly stops a truck to hitch a ride to follow the abductor, but the truck is suddenly hit by the returning abductors' car, killing the driver and knocking her unconscious.  Upon recovering, she finds that her son isn't there in the Volvo. The male abductor emerges from his car and begins to shoot at her with a sawed-off shotgun. He tries to attack her in her car and she releases the brake, causing the car to reverse into the woods with the abductor clinging to it being fatally struck by tree branches. Karla yells at the man demanding to know where her son is, but he dies before she can get the answer. Karla finds his identification card and learns his name, Terrence Vickey, and a nearby address where her son might be.  Karla arrives at the Vickey house at nightfall and eventually locates Frankie in the barn with two other kidnapped girls. Before that, she calls 911 as she hides from Margo, who leaves the house in search of her husband Terrence. Karla successfully rescues Frankie, but when Margo — who has just realized that Terrence is dead — returns, she and her son run out of the barn before she can retrieve the two girls. Karla creates a diversion by sailing the skiff away while hiding underwater.  Margo discovers them hiding, and Karla drags Margo down into the water and drowns her. Returning to the barn, she is approached by a man who is the Vickey's neighbor, who holds her at gunpoint. After listening to her and hearing the children in the barn attic, he then offers to help her by getting the two girls down.  Realizing that he is the ringleader of the kidnappings since he knew that two girls were there without looking, she kills him with the shovel just before he draws his gun at her.  Karla rescues the two girls as the police arrive. Media reports praise her for saving the children from the abductors, and announcing that Karla's actions have led to police breaking up an international child abduction ring, with arrests being made in other parts of Louisiana, as well as New York, London, Paris, and Dubai. The media hails Karla as a hero.

However, he drops this plan after meeting and falling in love with Lakshmi ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]), his childhood friend at the airport, who dupes him into believing that she gave him her phone number realizing that he is having a crush on her. Later, Seenu and Malli ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]), his friend notice a [[doppelgänger]] of Seenu named Shankar (Chiranjeevi), being shot by a group of thugs. They admit him to a hospital, following which Seenu decides to impersonate the injured Shankar to escape from the police. Under the name of his doppelgänger, Seenu and Malli enter an [[Retirement home|old-age home]] run by Shankar with the aim of collecting 25 [[lakh]]s (which is meant for the inmates of the old-age home) for their Bangkok trip, until he learns about his doppelgänger's mission. Shankar is a post-graduate in [[hydrology]] from the arid village of Neeruru in [[Rayalaseema]] who had discovered [[groundwater]] under some lands of the village which could be used as an irrigation source not only for the village, but for the entire Rayalaseema and the neighbouring areas as well. But, an [[Multinational corporation|MNC]] owned by Aggarwal ([[Tarun Arora]]) cheated the villagers into giving their lands for the construction of a factory. Shankar was arrested by the police and the six villagers as for convince the issue with media and release of Shankar commit mass suicide. On learning of the plight of Shankar and the villagers, Seenu decides to fight for their cause while still under the name of Shankar. The people of the old home and Seenu go to the jury and try to convince him to go in favour of them, but Seenu starts stating rules and scares the main jury person (whom Aggarwal had bribed). Seenu then sends a person (disguised as a hairdresser) to Aggarwal and makes him lay a fingerprint on Aggarwal's neck. After that Aggarwal sends 50 men to kill Seenu but he soon defeats them using the coins the Lion Club member gave when he was attending a ceremony for him.  Meanwhile, the real Shankar gains consciousness and finds himself in the Kolkata prison where Seenu was locked up. With the help of the man who Seenu helped capture, who has heard his story and has plans to kill Seenu in revenge for getting him caught and thrown back into prison, he soon escapes along with the prisoner's henchmen.  Not knowing that Shankar and the henchmen are headed for Hyderabad, Seenu makes efforts to convince the media to bring the plight of the villagers to national consciousness, but the media is not interested as they feel that it is not a sensational news. A few days later, at the high court, the judge declares the verdict in favour of Seenu and the villagers, but adds that Aggarwal has claimed that certain villagers who are working abroad have shown their support for the factory. If they cannot prove that their support was faked by Aggarwal within the next five days, the verdict will then go in favour of Aggarwal and the villagers will lose their lands. Since the villagers, who have denied supporting the factory, are abroad and cannot come to Hyderabad within five days to rebut Aggarwal's claims as their passports are held by their contractors, and the verdict is to be decided within five days, Seenu decides to take drastic measures to sensationalize the issue. He, Lakshmi, Malli and the inmates of the old-age home block water supply to Hyderabad by sitting on the pipelines which carry water to Hyderabad. With the plight of the Hyderabad people due to no water supply having gained national attention, Seenu comes out of the pipeline after a few days and highlights the villagers' plight in an emotionally charged speech to the media, which is telecast nationwide and moves many people.   Meanwhile, Shankar and the henchmen reach Hyderabad, but Shankar is soon kidnapped by Aggarwal's henchmen. While in Aggarwal's custody, he sees Seenu's speech on television and is moved by the efforts made by his doppelgänger to help the villagers. On the night before the verdict, Seenu's bluff is exposed, but Seenu assures the old men that he is genuinely interested in their cause, that Shankar is alive and that he will rescue Shankar from Aggarwal and hand him back over to the villagers with the assurance of a positive verdict. Seenu goes to Aggarwal's office, where Shankar is being held. He rescues Shankar and fights Aggarwal. Shankar kills Aggarwal when he was about to kill Seenu.  The next day, the verdict is declared in favour of Shankar and the villagers. The Kolkata police find Seenu and arrest him. Seenu assures Lakshmi that he will be back shortly.

As Blake mourns Max's loss, it is revealed that his real motivation to kill Gunther is that his ex, Lisa, slept with Gunther prior to breaking up with him due to them growing distant. The group learns that Ashley has been cleared to leave the hospital and Blake, Sanaa and Gabe go pick him up, but he has another heart attack seconds after leaving the hospital, forcing him to return. The team stocks on weaponry from an eccentric arms dealer and moves on to plan B. They set up a fake hit and keep surveillance on the target. 12 days later, Gunther shows up and invades the building in which the target is, but they fail to reach Gunther before he kills the target and end up fighting him inside the building. During a hand to hand fight with Izzat, Gunther chokes him with his own robotic hand (which frequently clenches due to its running out of battery), however, Sanaa manages to shoot Gunther in the leg and is saved from being shot in return by Donnie who pushes her out of the way.  The group return to their safe house and review the footage from the documentary crew and are shocked to learn that Gunther was wearing a mask identical to Blake's face. Yong tells them that he's got a tip that someone with a leg wound has been looking for treatment by a local underground doctor, the group deduces that it must be Gunther and goes to the doctor's place and surrounds it. Donnie plants a bomb in Gunther's car and attempts to detonate it, however, the bomb apparently fails and every car around them explodes, except the one which Donnie rigged to explode. As they go to check it, Yong discovers that the trunk is full of poisonous snakes; mesmerized, he doesn't react until one bites him in the neck, causing him to remark "is this what poison feels like? It sucks..." before dying. Another car quickly comes to pick Gunther up, however, shortly after Gunther enters the car, Sanaa shoots the driver, causing it to crash. The team then unloads their weapons into the car before Donnie tosses a grenade inside it. Upon confirming that there were two bodies, they go out to celebrate and Sanaa and Donnie spend the night together.  Blake is awakened in the middle of the night by Rahmat chasing Donnie while threatening to kill him with a pistol for sleeping with his daughter, claiming that Blake texted him. Blake, realizing it must have been Gunther, goes to check on the Bellakalakova twins only to find them dead. Donnie leaves the group to hide from Rahmat and Sanaa follows them, attempting to stop her father. Blake, along with only the documentary crew and Gabe, decides to go back to his apartment, only to find it under surveillance by the FBI. They decide to lay low at Gabe's cramped apartment, where Blake is contacted by Donnie, who is in disguise due to running away from Rahmat. Donnie calls out Blake for not doing everything he could in order to find Gunther (such as interrogating his ex) and says that he wants to quit the killer business to be with Sanaa.  Blake then goes to Lisa's house and delivers all the letters he had written her while he was away, and he also reveals that he kept his distance because he was afraid that someone would hurt her to get to him. Blake then receives a call from the hospital saying that Ashley is healthy enough to leave. He picks up Ashley, only for him to suddenly die of a heart attack.  At Ashley's funeral, Blake delivers his eulogy and is ineffectively consoled by Gabe. Donnie appears to show his sympathies but Rahmat finds him and is about to kill him when Sanaa reveals that she is pregnant. Before Donnie can say anything a bomb explodes in Ashley's grave sending his tombstone flying towards Gabe's head, crushing it. Blake sobs and declares that while Gabe was "completely useless" he stuck with him until the end.  Lisa finds Blake and gives him Gunther's home address. He gathers weaponry and prepares to storm the house by himself, initially managing to get in without resistance. Blake soon finds himself in a shootout with Gunther, only to be assisted by Sanaa and Donnie who show up suddenly. They chase Gunther into a room where he reveals himself to them and tells them that he too has been making a documentary about his trying to kill them.  Gunther chides them for not working hard to achieve their reputation saying that while he had to do it "the old fashioned way," they just want a shortcut by killing him. He then claims not to be mad at them and gives the group a chance to leave. Donnie and Sanaa decide to leave the house while Gunther attempts to keep talking down Blake, even apologizing for sleeping with Lisa. However, upon realizing that Blake still wants to kill him, he reveals that he kidnapped Lisa and says that if Blake kills him, his camera crew will kill Lisa.  Lisa hits Gunther, momentarily distracting him and giving Blake enough time to kill his henchmen. Lisa escapes while Blake and Gunther fight. Blake is hopelessly outmatched as Gunther simply beats him down with ease, however, before he can finish Blake off, the police arrive and Gunther disappears while Blake grabs a weapon to shoot him.  The film cuts to a year later when it's revealed that Donnie and Sanaa are happily married and have a daughter, Donnie having earned Rahmat's respect by converting to Islam after a number of death threats by Rahmat (although he claims it was his own choice). Lisa has married someone else and Blake has disappeared. Gunther is revealed to have retired and is back living in his native Austria where he set up a gardening community for his town's elderly and rediscovered his love for country music. In the middle of the interview with the documentary crew, he is suddenly shot by a deranged and unkempt Blake who celebrates finally having murdered Gunther. However, he realizes that Gunther is wearing a bomb vest with a dead man's switch, and the bomb goes off, killing him.  Later in an interview with the Austrian authorities, it is revealed that Gunther is somehow still alive and disguised as a reporter.

The Killing of a Sacred Deer
 Steven Murphy, a skilled [[Cardiothoracic surgery|cardiothoracic surgeon]], finishes an [[open heart surgery]], and goes to a diner where he meets a teenage boy named Martin. Afterward, Steven returns home to his wife, Anna, and their children, Kim and Bob. He later tells Anna that Martin's father died in a car accident ten years earlier, and that he has taken an interest in the boy to help him grieve. Martin comes to the Murphy household for dinner; Kim seems rather taken with him.  Martin returns the favor by inviting Steven to his mother's home for dinner. After the meal, Steven tries to leave but Martin insists he watch a movie with them. Martin leaves halfway through, and his mother makes a romantic advance on Steven, who rebuffs her and goes home. Over the next few days, Martin's demands on Steven's time grow increasingly frequent and desperate, but Steven does not reply. One morning, Bob awakens and finds he cannot feel his legs; he has become [[Paralysis|paralyzed]]. Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, where an examination reveals that nothing is physically wrong. Meanwhile, Kim meets with Martin for a date.  The next morning, Martin meets Steven and reveals the truth: his father did not die in the crash but had died during surgery that Steven himself performed after the accident. Steven failed to save his father, and the boy blames the surgeon for the death. Martin explains that, to "balance" the act of destroying a family, Steven must kill one of the members of his own. If not, the Murphys will slowly die after four stages; paralysis is the first stage. Steven attempts to dismiss these claims, but later finds that Bob is refusing food: this is the second stage. Kim also loses the use of her legs and the will to eat.  Kim receives a call from Martin at the hospital. During the conversation, she regains the use of her legs, only to lose mobility again when the connection is broken. This convinces Anna that Martin has power. She visits Martin to ask why she and her children must suffer for Steven's mistakes. Martin responds that "it's the only thing...that's close to justice". Anna, suspecting that her formerly [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] husband may have drunk on the day of the operation, speaks to Steven's anesthesiologist, Matthew, who reveals that Steven did in fact have a few drinks that morning. Anna performs [[masturbation]] on Matthew as payment for the information. At Anna's insistence, the children are transported to their home, where they are fed through a tube. Steven then kidnaps Martin, brutally beating him and demanding that he reverse the condition of the children. Martin is unaffected, warning Steven that time is running out.  Martin's presence only exacerbates the tension in the household: Kim and Bob argue over who their father will choose; and Anna claims that killing one of the children is clearly the only option, as they can have another. Kim attempts to save herself by escaping and crawling through the neighborhood. Steven and Anna retrieve her. The next morning, Anna releases Martin as holding him captive was no use. Bob begins bleeding from the eyes - the final stage before death. Rather than choose, Steven binds Kim, Bob, and Anna to chairs, covers their heads, and pulls a woolen hat over his own face. He loads a rifle, spins in circles, and fires. The first two shots miss, but the third kills Bob.  Some time later, the family visits the same diner where Steven met with Martin. Martin enters and stares at them; he and the family briefly lock eyes and the Murphys leave as Martin gazes after them.

Kong: Skull Island
  In 1944, in the midst of [[World War II]], two fighter pilots – American pilot Hank Marlow and Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari – parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a [[dogfight]] and engage in [[close quarters combat|close combat]], but the fight is interrupted by a giant ape.  In 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former [[Special Air Service|British Special Air Service]] [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] James Conrad, a skilled [[Tracking (hunting)|tracker]], to guide an expedition to map out a recently discovered island known as [[Skull Island]]. Their military escort is the Sky Devils, an [[United States Army|army]] helicopter squadron newly returned from the [[Vietnam War]] and led by [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Preston Packard and his subordinates, [[Major (United States)|Major]] Jack Chapman and [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Earl Cole. The group is joined by [[pacifist]] photojournalist Mason Weaver, who believes that the expedition is a secret [[military operation]], and intends to expose it. Upon arrival at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping [[Seismic bomb|explosives]], developed by seismologist Houston Brooks, to [[Reflection seismology|map out]] the island and prove his [[Hollow Earth]] theory. However, the air unit is attacked by the same ape from 1944, who kills a number of military personnel, and scatters the survivors across the island.  Packard regroups with some of the stranded survivors, including Randa, Cole, his door gunner Reles, pilot Glenn Mills, and [[Landsat]] employee Steve Woodward. After being confronted by Packard, Randa reveals his affiliation to the secret government organization Monarch, and its plan to use the expedition to prove the existence of monsters, and determine their threat to humanity. Packard's group begins making their way to Chapman, whose helicopter crash-landed elsewhere. Meanwhile, the other group of survivors, consisting of Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin, soldier Reg Slivko, and Landsat employee Victor Nieves, try to reach a rendezvous point to meet a resupply team arriving in three days' time. Along the way, the survivors have various encounters with the island's creatures.  Conrad's group eventually encounters the local [[Iwi]] natives and an older Marlow. Marlow reveals the ape is [[King Kong|Kong]], the island's guardian, worshiped as a god by the natives for protecting them from many predators, including two-legged, lizard-like monsters dubbed "Skullcrawlers". He informs them that Kong attacked and destroyed the air unit because their bombs brought the subterranean Skullcrawlers to the surface; the Skullcrawlers are responsible for killing Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind. Marlow also tells them that he and Ikari became friends, but Ikari was killed by a Skullcrawler some time ago. He also says that they are fortunate that they didn't awaken "the Big One", the largest of the Skullcrawlers.  Chapman is ambushed and devoured by a Skullcrawler, while Conrad's group helps Marlow complete a boat built from parts scavenged from Marlow and Ikari's downed planes. They ride down the river, and manage to secure communication with Packard's group, but the boat is attacked by [[pterosaur]]-like creatures that kill Nieves. They regroup with Packard, who insists on searching for Chapman, though his true objective is to secure weapons and kill Kong, who he perceives as an enemy due to killing his men. Marlow leads the two groups to a mass grave littered with the bones of Kong's kin. There, the same Skullcrawler that killed Chapman attacks the group, killing Randa and many soldiers before dying in a flammable gas explosion triggered by Weaver. Learning about Chapman's death, a vengeful Packard becomes even more determined to kill Kong and avenge his fallen men. The group parts ways, with Packard's group retrieving weapons from Chapman's chopper and laying a trap for Kong at a nearby lake, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat. While scouting the path ahead, Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong up close and, seeing his true peaceful nature, they resolve to save him.  As Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong, Packard's group uses the remaining seismic charges to lure him in. Kong charges to the lake, where Packard incapacitates him with ignited [[napalm]], though Woodward is killed. Conrad, Weaver, and Marlow arrive and persuade the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses to stand down. A massive Skullcrawler, the Big One, emerges from the lake, and Packard is crushed to death by a recovering Kong. The Skullcrawler overpowers Kong and chases the humans to a [[marsh]] near the island's edge. Cole is killed in a failed suicide bomb attempt to kill it. Kong returns to rescue the others while battling the beast, and is aided by the survivors. Weaver is knocked into the marsh during the fight, but Kong saves her from drowning. Kong finally kills the Skullcrawler by tearing out its tongue and [[Disembowelment|eviscerating]] it, and allows the survivors to leave the island.  During the credits, Marlow is shown returning home, reuniting with his wife, meeting his son for the first time, and watching a [[Chicago Cubs]] game on television.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Conrad and Weaver are detained and recruited by Monarch. They are informed by Brooks and San that Skull Island is just the beginning and that Kong is not the only monster king to roam the world. As proof, they are shown archive footage of cave paintings depicting the monsters [[Godzilla]], [[Rodan]], [[Mothra]], and [[King Ghidorah]].

Kodachrome (film)
  Matt Ryder (Jason Sudeikis) is a record executive who is in danger of losing his job due to his constant failings to sign big artists to the record label. He is met in his office by Zooey Kern (Elizabeth Olsen) who is the assistant to Benjamin Ryder (Ed Harris), a lifetime photographer and Matt's father. She informs him that Ben is dying and has a final request: to go to [[Parsons, Kansas|Parsons]] in Kansas to develop some [[Kodachrome]] film from "[[Dwayne's Photo]]", a small photo shop that is the last place that develops Kodachrome film -- and will stop developing Kodachrome in a few weeks. Matt and Ben haven't spoken in over a decade, and Matt refuses to take his father to Kansas. Their estranged relationship is very apparent after a contentious dinner where Matt blames Ben for his bad childhood, including sleeping around on his mother.  Larry (Dennis Haysbert), Ben's manager, offers to arrange a sitdown between Matt and the Spare 7's, a popular rock band that he has been trying to sign and might just save his job.  The condition being that Matt takes Ben to Kansas.  In an old convertible, Matt, Ben and Zooey start their journey to Kansas.  Zooey confronts Matt about being "less scared" to let Ben in and to try and loosen up. Coming back from his working, Matt peers through the open blinds of Zooey's hotel room and sees her playing cards with Ben, laughing and having a fun time. At a diner, Ben makes a point about Zooey's marriage ending in an affair, while Matt continues his verbal hostility towards him. She in turn continues to warn Matt about his father's time being limited.  The journey continues, with Matt sharing a story with Zooey about the death of his mother. Ben suggests they detour an hour out of the way to see Ben's brother Dean (Bruce Greenwood) and his wife Sara (Wendy Crewson). Sara confuses Matt and Zooey's relationship, and despite their explanation of not being together, they end up sharing a room. They bond a little over Matt's old music collection, with Ben teasing her about having never heard of the band Live, or the song "Lightning Crashes".  Later, in speaking to Aunt Sara, Matt expresses concern that everyone in the family is too easily accepting of Ben, even after all of Ben's mistakes and failings. Uncle Dean tells Matt that he's happy that Matt is taking this trip. Later, a drunk Matt tells Zooey how beautiful she is. When he leans in to kiss her, he falls off of the bed. He sleeps on the floor, while Zooey takes the bed, and they end up sharing stories of their failed marriages.   The next morning, Zooey is startled out of bed by the sounds of Ben, who has fallen in the bathroom and cannot stand up. Breakfast is uncomfortable as Ben looks at both Zooey and Matt, saying "You two are screwing now?", then brings up an incident from long ago where Ben slept with Sara before she met Dean. Back on the road, Ben continues to discuss Zooey and Matt sleeping together, and is disappointed when he finds out they aren't.    Larry has arranged for special passes to a Spare 7's concert where Matt will have a chance to pitch his record label to the band. He runs his sales pitch by Ben, who thinks its terrible, and tells Matt he should speak with authority, telling the band what he can fix instead of just gladhanding. Ben then questions Matt's real motives for even coming on this road trip. When Matt meets the band, he tries to offer them creative control and special treatment to try to sign them. When they balk, he tries Ben's tactic of telling the band what they are doing wrong and how they need to get it fixed. The band's lead singer, Jasper (Gethin Anthony) and the band admires Matt's nerve and as they begin to agree to work with Matt, they look over and see Ben, who has accidentally urinated himself, and begin to laugh and mock him. Matt realizes the low character of the band members, and declines to sign them, walking out.   Arriving back to the hotel, Matt walks over to a nearby bar, while Ben expresses disappointment at Matt for not closing the deal. Zooey, appalled by Ben's attitude towards Matt after Matt threw away a career decision to defend him, confronts Ben, which leads to Ben firing her as his nurse and assistant. Hurt, she joins Matt at the bar.  After word of Matt's walking out in the Spare 7's gets out, his record company sends him a text that he's fired.  Zooey then begins to sing along to "Lightning Crashes", playing overhead, revealing that she is familiar with the band Live. They return to the hotel room and sleep together.  Matt awakens with Zooey dressed and packing, as she's heading to the airport, saying she's called a nurse to replace her, and says the previous night with Matt a mistake. She tells him that her marriage didn't end because her husband cheated -- it ended because she cheated on him. She gets on an elevator and leaves. When Ben doesn't answer his door after Matt knocks repeatedly, he gets the hotel staff to open it, finding Ben passed out on the floor. At the hospital, the nurse tells Matt that Ben's cancer has spread to the point where they can keep him comfortable, but he cannot travel anymore, especially the hundreds of miles remaining to Kansas.  Ben wakes up, asking Matt not to tell Zooey that he's in the hospital, to avoid her blaming herself. That night, he struggles to load film into a camera, eliciting Matt's help. Through tears, Ben tells Matt that he doesn't expect forgiveness, but that he loves him and apologizes for not being a good father.   The next day, Matt rolls in a wheelchair, planning on taking Ben out of the hospital to make it to the photo shop, which by this time, will stop developing Kodachrome by the close of business the next day. They finally make it to Parsons, Kansas early the next morning. When they check into the hotel, the manager puts them in the same room, saying that people have been coming in from all over the world to get their film developed and the rooms are scarce. Inside Dwayne's Photo, the clerk tells them that they stopped taking Kodachrome the day before, because they ran out of dye. Ben calls for Dwayne to come out, and he does, giving Ben a hearty welcome and sharing that they go way back. He says he left a little room in the film processing just in case Ben made it, and says the pictures will be ready the next day. As Matt and Ben start to leave, Ben is recognized by several patrons, including one from National Geographic, admitting that he became a photographer because of Ben. Matt stands by, understanding the impact his father has had on the photography world.   In the hotel room, Ben is cleaning his camera while sitting at a desk. He falls asleep and passes away.  As his body is loaded into an ambulance, dozens of photographers salute him by lining the walkway and flashing their cameras.  Larry arrives, saying he's working on getting the body released. Then Dwayne appears, delivers the developed photos, saying that outside of the ones he took personally, Ben's pictures are the last ones to ever be developed by Kodachrome. As Matt starts to hand them to Larry, Larry refuses, saying that Ben was very direct that Matt take care of them.  Matt tries calling Zooey, leaving a few voicemails, expressing regret over the choices he's made, and how he doesn't want to give up on her. Arriving back at Ben's home, Matt pulls out the pictures, loads them into the projector and sees them for the first time. He is surprised to see dozens of pictures of himself as a little boy, many with his deceased mother, and some as a baby with his father.  Zooey appears, saying that Larry told her Matt would be there. She asks if he'd like some company, and he says yes, and they stand together closely, watching the pictures on the wall. Many pictures taken by Ben appear during the credits, and the credits reveal the film was shot on Kodak 35mm film.

Thendral reveals that one of her doctor friends treated Aravind and Abhinaya and that Aravind is infertile, leading Thendral to theorize that Abhinaya might have been unfaithful.  While looking through his sister-in-law's postmortem report, Vetri realizes that her body contained traces of Clomiphene similar to Jessica's body. After talking to the coroner, Vetri learns there is a third young woman who matches this pattern. Realizing that Aravind might be hiding something, Vetri confronts his brother, when he and his wife had opted for an [[artificial insemination]] using his own sperm. Vetri then visits Dr. Tulsi at her hospital and sees on enquiry, he realizes that she  is hiding something. He requests for all the files on patients who have underwent artificial insemination at the hospital. He also notices that Kousalya([[Neelima Rani]]), a famous TV artist gets treated successfully in that hospital. While studying the files, Vetri realizes the documents on artificial insemination patients had an unusual watermark with the number 23 on them.  The following day, Vetri visits Kousalya and her husband to question them on whether they have been blackmailed recently. Although the couple deny everything, Vetri asks his team to tap their phones, especially income calls. True enough, Kousalya receives a call instructing her to pay a huge sum of money in exchange for not revealing information that might destroy her career. Vetri and his team shadow the young couple the next day. Kousalya and her husband are seen withdrawing money from a bank and driving through a busy street. Just then, a young man covering his face forcefully enters their car and takes the money. By the time Vetri catches up with them, the man has escaped. However, Vetri's men had placed a tracker on the bag containing the money.  Vetri easily tracks the man to his apartment and manages to overpower the criminal to interrogate him. He reveals that he is Gaurav ([[Aravind Akash]]) and is part of a gang that has been blackmailing several women in the city who have legally undergone artificial insemination at Dr. Tulsi's hospital. One of their first victims was Jessica, who is an ardent cricket fan. She had hired Gaurav's gang to get hold of her favourite cricket player's sperm in order to conceive his child. However, she soon felt guilty. Feeling that they might get caught, Gaurav killed her and the priest who heard her confession. Next was the politician's daughter-in-law who slit her own wrists at her baby shower. Her husband was infertile and her father-in-law arranged for her to be inseminated with his own sperm.  Finally, there was Abhinaya, who learned from Gaurav's partner, John ([[Vamsi Krishna]]) that Dr. Tulsi lied about using Aravind's sperm and instead inseminated her with someone else's sperm. John then blackmails Abhinaya for the fifty lakh rupees, or else he will expose the truth and bring shame upon her family. Abhinaya finally goes back to Dr. Tulsi to get an abortion. When Gaurav's gang learns about this, they came to Vetri's house that day when Thendral saw them and killed Abhinaya. They then arranged for it to look like a suicide. Once Gaurav was done confessing, Vetri kills him in a fit of anger.  As Vetri and his men head over to the hospital to arrest Dr. Tulsi, he suddenly remembers how a few years ago, a man named John reported his wife had gone missing. John was upset that his wife did not want to bear his children and instead wanted an artificial insemination with a much more superior male. A few days later, she was found dead. Since then, John had gone missing. Vetri had one of his men look into John's disappearance. Meanwhile, the same John is shown to be working as a lab assistant at Dr. Tulsi's sperm bank. He was the one who has been manipulating the donor's records and passing on the information to Gaurav. When Dr. Tulsi and her husband threaten to have him exposed, he swiftly kills them and leaves. On his way out, he bumps into Vetri.  Later that night, Vetri gets a call from John who has abducted Thendral. Vetri manages to track John down and saves Thendral. However, John is a trained fighter and beats up Vetri. John reveals that he arranged for Abhinaya to be inseminated with his own sperm. When he learned that she was planning an abortion, he could not accept it and had Gaurav kill her. While John is ranting, Vetri manages to overpowers him, and killing him.

 In 2003, Larry "Doc" Shepherd visits the bar of Sal Nealon, a former Marine that he served with in Vietnam. Sal willingly joins Doc on an impromptu drive where Doc reveals that he's also tracked down another friend from Vietnam, now-Reverend Richard Mueller. Sal and Doc are invited to dinner with the Muellers, where Doc reveals he is recently widowed and just lost his only son in Iraq. He admits he tracked down Sal and Mueller in the hope that they would accompany him to collect his son Larry Jr's body and take him to his scheduled burial. Sal agrees, though Mueller is hesitant, claiming that Sal and Doc represent a dark period in his life. His wife urges him to do it, so he reluctantly agrees to accompany him.  Along the way, Sal and Mueller clash over their differing philosophies and their mutual guilt over their past; both Sal and Mueller (nicknamed the Mauler) indulged in alcohol, drugs and prostitutes while on deployment, and on one occasion used up the entire supply of then-19 year old Doc's painkillers, which led to a needlessly painful death for one of their fellow Marines and a dishonorable discharge for Doc. Sal, who has no social filter from a head injury from the war, continually gets under Mueller's skin for having found religion, whilst Mueller expresses frustration at Sal's lack of maturity. At [[Dover Air Force Base]], Doc requests to view the maimed body of his son, against the advice of Mueller and LtCol Willits. During the viewing, LCpl Charlie Washington, Larry's close friend, reveals to Sal and Mueller that Larry Jr had been killed while shopping at an Iraqi market, contrary to the official story of dying while fighting heroically; Sal reveals the truth to a disillusioned Doc, who refuses the [[Arlington National Cemetery]] burial and insists on giving Larry Jr a civilian burial. Willits orders Washington to accompany the body and coerces Doc into changing his mind about having his deceased son buried in civilian clothing.  Sal, Mueller and Doc begin a long road trip back home, waylaid by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (alerted by their cash rental, vague destination and Mueller's praying) and a missed train in New York.  Over the course of the journey, the clashing becomes more good natured and Doc begins to boost in the company of his friends. Sal asks Doc to move to his town to run the bar with him, and the three purchase their first cell phones to stay in contact. Their trip takes them to Boston where Sal insists that they meet the mother of Jimmy Hightower, the fellow Marine who died painfully without morphine. When they arrive, they realise that Mrs. Hightower was given the same story about her son's heroism that Doc was given about Larry Jr; Sal decides not to deny her the story and the trio pretend to have been the men that Hightower saved when he was killed in action.  The group return to Portsmouth for Larry Jr's funeral, and where Washington persuades Doc that Larry's civilian suit will be too small and he should be buried in his [[Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps#Dress uniform|dress blues]]. At the burial, Sal and Mueller wear their uniforms, and participate in the flag-folding ceremony. Back at Doc's house, Charlie gives Doc a letter from Larry, claiming not to have read it.

Since the forces of good have won, first most of the magical creatures were imprisoned or killed, and then Bogatyrs themselves. Provided Ivan is truly the son of Ilya, he can uncover the Sword and use it to bring the magical creatures back their power, and to return home.  [[Baba Yaga]] is soon captured and thrown into the same dungeon, but it proves to be a trick: she brought along [[Vasilisa the Wise]] in frog form, who easily releases the prisoners. Despite Ivan being more of nuisance than any help, the three decide to take him with themselves and find the Sword together. Escaping the dungeon, they also enlist [[Vodyanoy]] the Merman, attracted to Baba Yaga (in her younger form, obviously). Koschei tells Ivan that Vasilisa helps them because her entire village was turned into frogs by jealous Varvara after she caught the eye of Dobrynya. Despite bonding with Vasilisa over the loss of their parents, Ivan still decides that he wishes to get home and not to stay with her.  Varvara eventually captures the heroes, turns Vodyanoy into stone and forces Ivan to get the Sword for her, lest his friends are killed. Ivan does recover the Sword and overpowers his foes with it, but Koshei turns out to be in league with Varvara. Moreover, Dobrynya himself is revealed to be the mastermind of the whole scheme, planning to use the Sword to get the same kind of immortality as Koschei. Reasoning that he no longer needs his help, Dobrynia betrays Koschei, and Ivan uses the Sword to escape to Earth.  Back in Moscow, he quickly realizes that he cannot abandon his beloved Vasilisa in trouble, and decides to get back. Upon finding Leshy, he returns to Belogorye, sets free [[Zmey Gorynych]] and uses a modern handgun to fight his way to Dobrynya. However, the latter has already completed the ritual and is now immortal, about to execute Vasilisa and Baba Yaga. Using Gorynych as distraction and cover, Ivan challenges Dobrynya to a fair duel, hoping to give his companions time to destroy the magical stone and therefore undo the Immortals' invulnerability. During the fight, Dobrynya reveals that it was his envy of Ilya that led to betrayal of bogatyrs.  Koschei eventually gets his hands on the magical stone, and, touched by the selfless heroism of his companions, decides to shatter it, killing himself and Dobrynya. Varvara escapes Belogorye in horror, and her petrified victims come back to life, Ilya among them, reunited with his son now. Ivan decides to stay in Belogorye rather than return to the life of a fake "mage", marrying Vasilisa. The only thing he comes back into his world for is to use the real magic to help the comatose boy from the beginning of the film.  The film ends with Varvara on Earth, meeting her mother. It is revealed that the two planned to enthrall Dobrynya and gain dominion over Belogorye, but with that plan failed, will now have to make a different move.  
The Lego Batman Movie
  In the Lego Universe, [[Batman]] continues to protect [[Gotham City]] and fight crime. During his latest mission to stop [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from destroying the city, he hurts his arch-rival's feelings by telling him he is not as important in his life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him. The following day, Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, attends the city's winter gala, which is celebrating both the retirement of [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] and the ascension of his daughter [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara]] as the city's new [[police commissioner]], only to be infuriated by Barbara's plans to restructure the police to function without the need of Batman. Without warning, Joker crashes the party with the city's [[List of Batman Family adversaries|other villains]], all of whom surrender, with the exception of [[Harley Quinn]] who disappears during the confusion.  Suspecting his arch-rival is up to something, Batman plots to steal [[Superman]]'s [[Phantom Zone]] Projector, a device that can banish anyone to the Phantom Zone which houses some of the most dangerous villains in the Lego multiverse. Just as he plans his heist of the device, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] intervenes and advises him to take charge of [[Dick Grayson]], whom Bruce unwittingly adopted as his ward during the gala. Reluctantly agreeing to do so, Batman fosters Dick as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], whereupon the pair successfully recover the Projector from the [[Fortress of Solitude]], and break into [[Arkham Asylum]] to send Joker to the Phantom Zone. Suspecting that the Joker wanted to be sent there, Barbara locks up Batman and Robin for their reckless actions.  While the Projector is being seized as evidence, Harley steals it back as part of Joker's plan and frees him, allowing him to return to Gotham with all the villains he had recruited in the Phantom Zone, including [[King Kong]], the [[Gremlins]], the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], a [[Tyrannosaurus]] and a [[Velociraptor]], [[Lord Voldemort]], [[Sauron]], the [[Jaws (film)|Jaws]] shark, the [[Dalek]]s, Lord Vampyre, [[Agent Smith]] and his clones, and the [[Kraken]]. Realizing that the city does need him, Barbara releases Batman and Robin and teams up with them and Alfred to stop the Joker. Although Batman finds himself able to trust and rely on his new team upon reaching [[Wayne Manor|Wayne Island]], he chooses to send them away rather than losing them like his parents. Upon facing him alone, Joker believes that Batman is incapable of change and zaps him to the Phantom Zone before stealing the [[Batcave]]'s stash of confiscated bombs. Arriving in the Phantom Zone, Batman witnesses the harm his selfishness has caused to everyone and slowly accepts his greatest fear. Making a deal with the Zone's gatekeeper Phyllis, a talking Lego brick, to be allowed back to Gotham in order to retrieve the Zone's escaped prisoners, Batman arrives in time to save his teammates, apologizing to them for his actions, and requesting their help to stop Joker.  Realizing that Joker plans to use the explosives he took to destroy the city's Energy Facility, thus causing the city to come apart and be destroyed, Batman turns Barbara into [[Batgirl]], before he, his team, and Gotham City's other villains, who felt neglected by Joker, manage to successfully send the escaped villains back to the Phantom Zone. However, the group fail to stop Joker's bombs going off as the explosion begins to tear the city apart at the plates beneath it. Knowing this was his fault, Batman reluctantly convinces Joker that he is the true reason for being the hero he is before they, their friends and allies, and the city's inhabitants, chain-link themselves together and pull the plates back together, saving the city.  With the city saved, Batman prepares to be taken back into the Phantom Zone to fulfill his bargain only to be rejected by Phyllis who chooses to let him remain after seeing how much he had changed in order to save everyone. Batman allows Joker and the rest of his rogues gallery to temporarily escape with the confidence that whenever they return, they will be no match for the Batman family.  
The Layover (film)
 Kate ([[Alexandra Daddario]]) and Meg ([[Kate Upton]]) are childhood friends and roommates in [[Seattle]] going through stressful times. Kate is a high school English teacher, bored of her regular curriculum and under pressure to quit by Principal Moss ([[Rob Corddry]]) who believes she should be in a different profession, causing her to think that he is firing her. Meg is a cosmetics saleswoman trying and failing to sell North Korean beauty products. After a night of drinking away their stress, the adventurous Meg suggests they go on vacation to get their groove back. The reserved Kate is reluctant, but ultimately acquiesces as Meg had already booked non-refundable tickets to [[Fort Lauderdale]] using Kate's frequent flyer miles.  Barely making it to their flight on time, Kate is put in a window seat and Meg gets an aisle seat. The middle seat is eventually occupied by Ryan ([[Matt Barr]]), a handsome firefighter on his way to a wedding. Both Kate and Meg are immediately attracted to him and begin to shamelessly flirt with him, but Kate eventually passes out having taken too many [[anti-anxiety]] pills. A few hours into the flight, the plane is diverted to [[St. Louis]] due to a hurricane warning. The girls are taken to the local [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] and bump into Ryan, who invites them to drinks at the hotel club. When Ryan learns the hurricane will delay his trip even further, the girls attempt to cheer him up with a dance competition. Before going to bed, Kate tells Meg that she will fight her for Ryan's affections.  Their following day is unfortunate when during their ride in a hot air balloon, Kate is having a [[panic attack]] due to [[Acrophobia|fear of heights]] and Meg accidentally pops a champagne cork into the only eye of the one-eyed pilot; and Meg ends up injuring her eye after a risky flip into the swimming pool.  When it is learned the hurricane will move away from Florida, Ryan is able to get a ride from Craig ([[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]]), a jewelry salesman who had taken a liking to Meg but had been continually rebuffed by her, and the girls ask to tag along. Kate shows embarrassing childhood photos of Meg to the guys for their amusement and in response, Meg locks Kate in a messy gas station bathroom, forcing Kate to escape through a high window covered in feces. Back in the car, Kate fakes an injury to get a massage from Ryan, prompting Meg to put sleeping pills into a bottle of wine to give to Kate. When Kate declines to drink, Craig, who is driving, takes it instead, much to Meg's horror. After a few hours, Craig eventually passes out and crashes the car, forcing the four to spend the night at a motel.  When Kate sees the pills in the bottle, she asks for a hotel room for herself. Meg says that she can have Ryan, but Kate proclaims she never wanted Ryan, just that she did not want Meg to have him. Meg decides to go to a local bar where Craig joins her. When Craig fails to impress Meg, he suggests to her that she should be open to the qualities of other guys. Back at the hotel, Ryan makes a pass at Kate, who gives in and has rigorous sex with him. In the morning at breakfast, Meg tells Kate they should stop ruining their friendship over a guy, but when Meg lets slip that Ryan has a misshaped penis, something Kate had seen from having sex with him, Kate realizes Meg had sex with Ryan as well and reaches breaking point with her, with the two getting into a physical fight over their issues with each other, Meg's selfishness and Kate's unwillingness to take chances, making a mess of the motel lobby in the process. Their fight ends when the motel manager calls the police on them.  Craig reveals to the police that Ryan had taken his car to reach the wedding on time. When he looks up Ryan's [[Google Plus]] profile, he sees that Ryan is the one getting married and reveals this to the girls. Appalled, the girls beg to be let go to stop the wedding and offer to pay for the damages to the lobby. When they reach the hotel in Fort Lauderdale where the wedding is taking place, they find they were too late to stop it. The girls confront Ryan, who calls them out on throwing themselves at him. The girls still claim it was wrong for him to sleep with both of them the night before his wedding and not telling them he was the one getting married. Ryan admits he had been with his now-wife Genevieve since freshman year of college and has not been able to get with anyone else. When the girls meet Genevieve, they see that she is controlling and demanding of Ryan, and decide not to tell her about his actions, feeling Ryan will suffer enough in his marriage. With a few hours before their flight back to Seattle, Meg tracks down Craig at his jewelry shop to apologize for brushing him off, kissing him before she leaves. At the airport, Meg tells Kate that they should not live together anymore, to which Kate tearfully agrees, as they have been too dependent on each other.  Kate returns to her job with renewed vigor, and she requests Principal Moss that her students be allowed to indulge their creativity more instead of just following the standard curriculum. Moss reveals to Kate that he had no intention of firing her; he actually wants to offer her the assistant volleyball coach position. Meg starts taking classes and is in a long distance relationship with Craig. It is shown that Meg moved into an apartment only a few doors down from Kate so the two can still be close.  
Leatherface (2017 film)
 At the [[Texas Chainsaw House|Sawyer homestead]], a [[birthday party]] is being held by the family matriarch Verna Sawyer ([[Lili Taylor]]) for the youngest member of the Sawyer family, Jedidiah. As his birthday present and to induct him into the murderous family rituals, he is presented with a [[chainsaw]] and is urged to slaughter a man they have accused of attempting to steal from them. Jed refuses, visibly disturbed, and the victim is instead killed by [[Grandpa Sawyer]].  In 1955, couple Betty Hartman and Ted Hardesty come across the seemingly wounded Jedidiah Sawyer. Betty is promptly killed by the Sawyer family. Her father, Sheriff Hartman ([[Stephen Dorff]]), is shocked to find his daughter deceased. He takes Jedidiah into custody as revenge, sending him to a [[mental institution]] known as the Gorman House Youth Reformery.  Ten years later, recently-hired nurse Elizabeth White forms a bond with patients Bud and Jackson ([[Sam Strike]]) at the Gorman House. Verna arrives with an injunction to allow family visitation for a now-teenage Jedidiah, only to be rejected by Doctor Lang ([[Christopher Adamson (actor)|Chris Adamson]]). On the way out, she violates security, causing a [[riot]] during which many of the nurses and patients are killed. Elizabeth is saved by Jackson but the two are taken hostage by crazed escapees Ike ([[James Bloor (actor)|James Bloor]]) and Clarice. They come across a bloodied Bud, having just killed Director Lang in a fit of rage, and decide to take him with them.  The group arrives at a rest stop diner. Ike and Clarice begin a murder spree within the diner in which Bud is injured and the group is forced to flee. Hartman arrives on the scene with Deputy Sorells ([[Finn Jones]]) and discovers that one of the escaped inmates is in fact Jedidiah. That night, the escapees take refuge in an abandoned mobile home where Clarice and Ike engage in [[sexual intercourse]], revealing her scarred body and [[Necrophilia|involving the corpse]] of the former homeowner in the debauchery. Elizabeth tries to escape but is stopped by Ike. Ike continually insults Bud, provoking him when the others aren't around. The next morning, Clarice finds Ike missing and goes searching for him. Jackson and Elizabeth find Bud sleeping on Ike's corpse and quickly take him away.  Clarice wanders into the woods looking for Ike and is apprehended by Hartman. She is shot in the head as the others watch from a distance. Jackson and Bud continue on with Elizabeth. As a Deputy passes, Elizabeth screams out, leading to Bud getting shot. Bud's death sends Jackson into a rage. He kills the Deputy and has Elizabeth drive them in the deputy's vehicle. The two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on them. A bullet severs Jackson's face. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and gathers the family. At the barn where his daughter was killed, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is incapacitated by the other Sawyers.  Back at the Sawyer home, Verna stitches the remnants of the mentally-scarred Jedidiah's face and applies a [[Muzzle (device)|muzzle]] to hold them together. She gifts Jedidiah with his original chainsaw and Elizabeth watches in horror as he bisects Hartman to death. As the family celebrates, Elizabeth flees. She nearly escapes, only to be caught in a [[Bear-trap|bear trap]]. She attempts to appeal to Jedidiah's sympathy, while Verna encourages him to kill her to protect their family. Jedidiah begins to listen to Elizabeth's pleas that he is not a killer until she insults Verna. This causes him to [[Decapitation|decapitate]] her in retaliation.  The next morning, Verna burns the evidence of the prior night's events and the Sawyers feed the remains of their victims to the pigs. In the basement, Jedidiah crafts Hartman's and Elizabeth's flesh into a mask and applies [[lipstick]]. The film ends with him smashing the mirror at the sight of his reflection.

Lazer Team 2
 Four years after the events of the [[Lazer Team|previous film]], the D.E.T.I.A. has mostly lost its funding and nearly everyone has been let go. Lazer Team has also been disbanded, as the four heroes do not work well together, Woody ([[Gavin Free]]) being the only member to be reassigned. He, along with Dr. Maggie Whittington ([[Nichole Bloom]]), has been attempting to create a rift in space, after receiving an unknown transmission. Once the rift is perfected, Woody is taken by an alien being, his helmet remaining behind. Four months later, Major Evelyn Kilbourne ([[Victoria Pratt]]) is now head of the D.E.T.I.A., and she declares that any project associated with Lazer Team is to be shut down. This announcement angers Maggie, who is determined to not leave Woody lost forever. When her lab is getting cleaned out, Maggie steals a device called the translocator and sets out to find the remaining members of Lazer Team.  With the team split, Herman ([[Colton Dunn]]) has capitalized on his fame in the form of marketing and commercialism; Zach ([[Michael Jones (actor)|Michael Jones]]) owns and operates a 'lazer' hair removal business in an attempt to win back his ex-girlfriend, Mindy ([[Allie DeBerry]]); Hagan ([[Burnie Burns]]) suffers from depression, as he feels his life has peaked, and he actually wants the team to form again. Maggie is able to gather the three at Hagan's house and explains the situation. While Hagan readily agrees, Herman and Zach are less than excited. The team sneaks into the base, where they're able to temporarily re-open the rift. However, Kilbourne intervenes and fights them. They all make it into the portal before it closes and Kilbourne is knocked unconscious. The four find that they're on an alien spacecraft, somewhere deep in space. Maggie also realizes that because too many people went through the rift, the translocator is out of power.  Not wasting any time, they crawl through vents to avoid detection. Maggie is immediately taken by the creature that abducted Woody, and the rest of the team escape the other way. Upon exiting the vents, the three are captured and imprisoned by cloaked figures. They reveal themselves to be the Antareans. Their leader, Arklosh, still holds a grudge over Lazer Team's previous victory, so the aliens remove the Champion Armor pieces from them and, along with Woody's helmet, they disintegrate it.  The Antareans transfer them to a white prison, that is one of infinite cells containing previous champions from over the years. Before they can panic, Woody arrives and rescues them. Without his helmet, it appears that his intelligence has decreased. He takes them to a compartment in the ship, where Maggie is held. She wakes, but is upset that Woody is not the one she's known. The creature that had abducted the two reveals himself. Woody introduces him as Doulos, the keeper of the 'Galactic Games' and the only remaining of the Ludon species, who has been enslaved on the ship for many years. He explains that when the team defeated the Antareans, it caused said aliens to wipe out planet after planet, afraid that more champions would rise and rebel against them. Revealing that he brought the team back together to finish what they've started, he leads the five to a control center where an experimental upgraded suit of power resides. The team is unwilling and Doulos urges the team to put on the pieces, however he is killed by Kilbourne before he can convince them. She reveals that she is the sister of the previous champion, Adam, and is now working with the Antareans, as she's always been jealous. Once the team is in a holding cell, she prepares to receive the pieces to destroy Earth.  When the ship finally arrives to Earth, the team realize their wrongdoings with not helping Doulos. They kill two guards before sneaking back to the control center. A battle ensues and Lazer Team acquires the upgraded armor. Back on Earth, Officer Vandenbloom (Kirk Johnson) notices many Antarean ships heading for the planet. With the help of Mindy and 'Mr. Scientist' ([[Gus Sorola]]), he is able to fend off the majority of the ships using a turret designed by the D.E.T.I.A. Back on the ship, the five are able to kill Kilbourne, with the help of another champion Woody had let out, and grab the translocator. They board a small ship, and using the device, are able to destroy the Antarean mother-ship and return home.  With the Earth saved once again, the team keeps contact with one another. Having a picnic, Woody and Maggie reveal their feelings for each other. They discover a small button on his helmet that shrinks it, and the two kiss.

Koko). Ninjago despises Lloyd for being Lord Garmadon's son, which puts Lloyd under emotional stress. They do not know that Lloyd is part of the secret ninja force, consisting of Nya, Zane, Jay, Cole, Kai and their master named Wu, who always stop Garmadon from taking over Ninjago City by fighting with mechs. On Lloyd's 16th birthday, Garmadon attacks Ninjago City once again only to be defeated. He escapes and fires nine generals of his Shark Army for failing to help him. He then begins to plan a big attack to conquer Ninjago, and his GIT's show him plans to build a gigantic mech that is immune to weapons.  Meanwhile, Lloyd and his friends see the return of Master Wu, back from a long trip he took. Master Wu tells them they aren't real ninjas if they use only mechs to fight, and discusses with Lloyd that his element is green, confusing Lloyd. Master Wu tells Lloyd he must not be angry at Garmadon; he must use his mind to fight. Wu mentions an Ultimate Weapon, giving Lloyd the hope of defeating Garmadon once and for all, despite being forbidden to use the weapon.  The next day, Garmadon attacks Ninjago City with his giant mech and defeats Lloyd. As Garmadon declares his rule over Ninjago, Lloyd returns with the Ultimate Weapon. He fires it, revealing it to be a laser that attracts a real-life cat named Meowthra. Meowthra starts destroying the city while trying to get the laser. Garmadon points the laser to make the cat destroy the other mechs, before Lloyd breaks it. As Garmadon celebrates his victory, Lloyd reveals that he is the Green Ninja, and tells Garmadon that he wishes he weren't his father, leaving Garmadon confused.  Lloyd meets up with his friends and Master Wu, who are all upset with him for using the weapon. Wu tells them they must use an Ultimate, Ultimate Weapon to stop Meowthra from destroying Ninago City, which they would reach by crossing the Forest of Dangers, the Canyon of Death, and the Temple of Fragile Foundations at the other side of Ninago Island. Garmadon overhears Wu talking about the weapon and follows close behind. He meets up with Wu and fights him, only to end up in a cage, defeated. However, Wu loses his balance and falls off a bridge into a river, telling Lloyd he must use inner peace before getting swept away.  The ninjas decide to continue on, with Garmadon leading them much to Lloyd's disappointment. They are caught by the Shark Army, who want revenge for being fired by Garmadon and shot out of his volcano lair. The ninjas try to fight, but are easily defeated. They retreat leaving Lloyd and Garmadon behind to be caught by the Shark Army. The Shark Army begin to drop Lloyd and Garmadon into a replica volcano, but the rest of the ninjas save the day using stealth fighting. They all work together with Garmadon to escape the angry Shark Army by building a makeshift helicopter, and Lloyd and Garmadon bond together in the process.  They eventually crash down onto the Temple of Fragile Foundations. Garmadon reveals that it is his home, as well as Koko formerly being a ninja warrior herself. He tells Lloyd that he wishes he had stayed with him and his mom after deciding to conquer Ninjago, but he couldn't change so he had to stay behind. The ninjas find the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon, consisting of a set of trinkets, only to have it stolen by Garmadon who still wants to take over the city. He offers for Lloyd to be his general, but Lloyd rejects his offer. Out of fury, Garmadon locks all of them in the temple as it begins to collapse. Lloyd realizes that inner peace means for them to unleash their power within, and they successfully do this, using their elemental powers and escaping from the collapsing temple. As they fall of a cliff, Wu saves them with his ship, the Destiny's Bounty and they head towards Ninjago.  Garmadon arrives and tries to control Meowthra with the weapons but Meowthra eats Garmadon instead. Lloyd and the crew arrive and begin fighting Garmadon's army. As Lloyd approaches Meowthra, he reveals to everyone that he is the green ninja, and realizes that green means life, which brings everything together. He comforts Meowthra and tells Garmadon he forgives him and that he's sorry. Garmadon cries tears of fire, which causes Meowthra to spit him out. After reconciling, Garmadon moves in with Lloyd and Koko, Meowthra becomes the mascot of Ninjago, and Lloyd is hailed as a hero.  As the story concludes, Mr. Liu tells the boy that he will start to train him as a ninja.  A mid-credits scene also shows a gag reel of a cup stunt performed by Chan as Liu at the film's opening.

Life (2017 film)
 In the near future, the unmanned Pilgrim 7 [[space probe]] returns from [[Mars]] to [[Earth]] orbit with [[Soil test|soil samples]] potentially containing evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. The probe is captured and its samples retrieved by the [[International Space Station]] and its six-member crew. [[Astrobiology|Exobiologist]] Hugh Derry, who is paralyzed from the waist down, revives a dormant cell from the sample, which quickly grows into a [[Multicellular organism|multi-celled organism]] that American school children name "Calvin". Hugh realizes that Calvin's cells can change their specialisation, acting as muscle, sensor, and neuron cells all at once.  An accident in the lab causes Calvin to become dormant; Hugh attempts to revive Calvin with electric shocks, but Calvin immediately becomes hostile and attacks Hugh, crushing his hand. While Hugh lies unconscious from  Calvin's attack, Calvin uses Hugh's electric shock tool to escape its enclosure; now free in the laboratory, Calvin devours a lab rat by absorbing it, growing in size. Engineer Rory Adams enters the lab to rescue Hugh; he is locked in by fellow crew member and physician David Jordan, however, to keep Calvin contained. Calvin latches onto Rory's leg; after Rory unsuccessfully attacks Calvin with a portable rocket thruster, Calvin enters his mouth, devouring his organs from the inside and killing him. Emerging from Rory's mouth even larger, Calvin escapes through a fire-control vent.  Finding their communication with Earth cut off due to overheating of the communication systems, ISS commander Ekaterina Golovkina performs a space walk to find and fix the problem. She discovers that Calvin has breached the ISS's cooling system; soon after, Calvin attacks her, rupturing her spacesuit's water coolant system in the process and causing the water in the system to fill her suit. She blindly makes her way back to the airlock; however, she and the crew realize that if she re-enters, Calvin will also be able to re-enter the ISS. Hence, she refuses to open the hatch and stops David from helping her do so; this keeps Calvin out of the station for the time being but also causes her to drown and die in her spacesuit.  Calvin then attempts to re-enter the station through its maneuvering thrusters. The crew try to fire the thrusters to blast Calvin away from the spacecraft, but their attempts fail, using up too much fuel and causing the ISS to enter a [[Orbital decay|decaying orbit]] where it will burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Pilot Sho Murakami informs the crew that they need to use the station's remaining fuel to get back into a safe orbit, although this allows Calvin to re-enter the station. The crew plan to make Calvin dormant by sealing themselves into one module and venting the atmosphere from the rest of the station.  After the remaining crew finalize preparations to do so, Hugh enters [[cardiac arrest]]. The crew then discover that Calvin has been feeding off of Hugh's paralyzed leg. Calvin attacks the remainder of the crew; Sho seals himself in a sleeping pod. As Calvin attempts to break its glass, David and the quarantine officer Miranda North use Hugh's corpse as bait to lure Calvin away from Sho and trap it in another module to deprive it of oxygen. Having received a distress call prior to the damage to the ISS's communication system, Earth sends a [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to the station as a [[fail-safe]] plan to push the station into deep space. Believing the Soyuz to be on a rescue mission for the ISS crew, Sho leaves his pod and moves to board it, forcing open its hatch; Calvin then attacks him and the Soyuz crew, causing the craft's docking mechanism to fail and resulting in the capsule crashing into the ISS, killing Sho and the Soyuz crew and causing the ISS to once again enter a decaying orbit.  The only two remaining survivors, David and Miranda, aware that Calvin could survive re-entry, plan for David to lure Calvin into one of the two remaining escape pods attached to the ISS for David to manually pilot the pod into deep space, isolating Calvin and allowing Miranda to return to Earth in the second pod. David manages to lure Calvin into his pod while Miranda enters her pod; as they simultaneously undock their pods from the ISS, one of the pods hits debris and is damaged, veering off course. In David's pod, Calvin attacks him as he struggles to manually pilot the pod; in Miranda's pod, she records a [[Flight recorder|black box]] message in case of her death during re-entry informing the world of her colleagues' deaths and not to trust Calvin nor any extraterrestrial life from Mars as well as to destroy Calvin at any cost should he make his way to Earth.  The two pods separate, one earthbound, the other spiraling away from Earth. The earthbound pod lands in the ocean; two nearby Vietnamese fishermen approach it. As they look into the pod, it is revealed to be David's, with the astronaut now encased in a web-like substance. Meanwhile, Miranda's pod's navigation system fails due to damage sustained from the debris, sending her flying away from Earth out of control, much to her horror. On Earth, despite David's attempts to warn them, the fishermen open the pod's hatch as more boats arrive on the scene.

Padmanabham is a famous Indian ropewalker and magician. But, he is also a master of disguise. Thus, the NIA has no idea how this criminal even looks like. He is now suspected to be residing in the USA. Bharadwaj has drafted a sharp officer Aadi ([[Srikanth (actor)|Srikanth]]) to go discover Padmanabham's hideout and identity by following a suit which he has purchases and is assumed to have an obsession with. The operation of this mission is called Sholay, which is implying that Aadi is the showman. All along, Padmanabham tries to go after the team which is trying to trace him, only to end up with Sathyam. Sathyam was a part of this operation the whole time. The rest of the film is about how Sathyam is related to the entire operation floated to crack Padmanabham, and how the hero-villain duo and other characters race against time.  In the end, Sathyam kills Padmanabham for good.

He double fists cocktails while trying to get his girlfriend to come home with him that night; she refuses. Disappointed, Harkens heads home in a drunken haze to sleep it off.

Logan (2017 film)
   In a split timeline, following the events of ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', by the year 2029, no [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] have been born in 25 years. [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]]'s healing ability has weakened and he has aged; he spends his days working as a limo driver in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In an abandoned [[Smelting|smelting plant]] in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker [[Caliban (Marvel Comics)|Caliban]] care for 90-year-old [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], Logan's mentor and founder of the [[X-Men]]. Charles, a psychic, suffers from a brain disease that causes him to have destructive seizures unless controlled with medication; a seizure a year earlier killed seven mutants, leaving Logan, Caliban, and Xavier as the last of the X-Men.  Gabriela Lopez, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, tries to hire Logan to escort her and an 11-year-old girl, [[X-23|Laura]], to Eden, a refuge in [[North Dakota]]. Logan reluctantly accepts but finds Gabriela killed. He is confronted at his hideout by Gabriela's killer [[Donald Pierce]], Transigen's [[cyborg]] chief of security, who is looking for Laura. Laura has stowed away in Logan's limo and has powers similar to Logan's. She, Logan, and Charles escape Pierce and his [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], but Caliban is captured and tortured by Pierce into tracking Laura.  A video on Gabriela's cellphone shows that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA samples to turn into weapons. Laura was created from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen had found an alternative, the children were to be killed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some of them escape.  In Oklahoma City, Logan discovers that Eden appears in an X-Men comic in Laura's possession and assumes it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Charles has a seizure and incapacitates everyone in the vicinity except for Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Charles with his medication. As they flee, [[List of Marvel Comics characters: R#Zander Rice|Dr. Zander Rice]], head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce.  Logan, Laura, and Charles help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident and accept an offer of dinner at their home. Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm harassing Will. Rice unleashes X-24, a clone of Logan in his prime, who murders Charles and Will's family, stabs Will and captures Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers while injuring Pierce. Logan fights X-24 but is outmatched. Will pins X-24 with his truck, but dies from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Charles's body.  After burying Charles, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to take her to Eden where they find [[Rictor]] and other Transigen children preparing to cross to Canada. Laura finds an [[adamantium]] bullet Logan has kept since his escape from [[Weapon X]], which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides his job is done and chooses not to accompany them, much to Laura's dismay.  The children are captured by the Reavers. Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily strengthens his physical and healing abilities. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers, but the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago while escaping from Weapon X, that no new mutants were born due to a virus created by Transigen that has been distributed through the world's food supply. Rice is shot to death by Logan, who attacks Pierce. X-24, enraged by Rice's death, fights Logan. With their guards distracted, the children kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his seismic powers to flip a truck onto X-24, who then frees himself, drags Logan and impales him on a tree branch, mortally wounding him, but Laura shoots X-24 in the head with the adamantium bullet, killing him.  Near death, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon she was made to be, and after Laura finally tearfully acknowledges him as her father, Logan dies peacefully in Laura's arms. Laura and the children then mourn over Logan's death and bury him near a lake, just like Charles. After the burial, Laura turns his grave-cross on its side to create an X, honoring him as the last of the X-Men. She then departs with the other children to continue their journey across the frontier.  
The Little Hours
 In the year 1347 in [[Garfagnana]], a convent of nuns is led by Father Tommasso. The nuns include Alessandra, who wants a better life for herself and is held at the convent due to her father's support of the church rather than her own bidding; Ginevra, a gossip who is later revealed to be a lesbian and Jewish; and Fernanda, an emotionally unstable and violent woman. The three of them routinely assault the gardener, who quits in disgust. Meanwhile in [[Lunigiana]], a young servant named Massetto gets caught having sexual relations with his master's wife. While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him get back home. The two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a [[deaf-mute]], in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble. Alessandra and Fernanda both end up having sex with Massetto. Massetto and Alessandra begin to form a closer bond while Ginevra begins to have feelings for Fernanda.  Later, Fernanda kidnaps Massetto at knife-point and takes him into the forest, where she meets up with a [[coven]] of [[witches]]. She attempts to perform a fertility ritual with Massetto but is stopped by the arrival of Alessandra and Ginevra. Ginevra, under the hallucinogenic effects of [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], takes off her clothes and begins dancing and steals the convent's donkey. Massetto reveals that he is not a deaf-mute while trying to free himself. They return to the convent, and all of their secrets are revealed in the presence of the visiting Bishop Bartolomeo. Father Tommasso is sent away to become a monk after it is discovered that he and the Mother Superior are in love and have a secret relationship. Massetto is returned to his master and is held in a jail cell with the impending threat of torture and death until the three nuns (who have reconciled and formed an even stronger friendship) help him escape. While Alessandra, Massetto, Ginevra, and Fernanda each run hand-in-hand back to the convent, the Mother Superior and Father Tommasso have met up in secret under the pretense that the Mother Superior has gone to retrieve the donkey. They hide as the nuns and Massetto run by. Fernanda stops and stares in puzzlement at the once again freed donkey that she herself used as an excuse so many times to escape the convent, until Ginevra pulls her away. With the group gone, Father Tommasso and Mother Superior embrace and smile at each other.  
Little Evil
  Gary Bloom marries Samantha who has a son, Lucas, a quiet 5-year-old boy who does not like Gary. Gary struggles to create a connection with Lucas, but Lucas ignores him. Gary receives a telephone call from his wedding videographer, Karl, warning him that something very unusual is in the footage and Gary must come see at once. Gary is uninterested, stating to Karl that he and Samantha have decided to just put the whole disaster out of mind and asks him to ‘please destroy the tapes’. The videographer pleads with him but Gary disconnects.  Later on that day, Gary stops by one of his properties for sale, an old nunnery, where Father J.D. Gospel buys it on the spot. Gary has to leave the sale when he is summoned to Lucas’ school where the [[school principal|principal]] informs Gary that Lucas spoke out of turn in class and told his science teacher to “go to hell”. Gary is further shocked when he finds out she then poured [[lye]] on her face, hurled herself out a third story window, and is found speared on the fence outside. Lucas seems to have a habit, Gary learns, of pushing people over the edge.  A [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] stresses that Lucas see a counselor and Gary, the apparent main source of Lucas’ erratic behavior, should do the same.  Samantha is visibly upset by the news and feels that everyone, including Gary, is unfairly blaming Lucas. Gary assures her that he loves them both and decides to have a heartfelt, frank discussion with the boy, but the conversation is not well-received or successful. At therapy, Gary tries to relate to other [[stepparent|stepfathers]], including his friend Al. When Gary confides in them that he thinks his stepson might be a little evil, they all sympathize and can relate to his feelings. The next day, at Lucas’ birthday party, a clown accidentally lights himself on fire, which finally inspires Gary to go see Karl the wedding videographer and find out what really happened at the wedding. Karl shows Gary the video, which shows that the priest wasn’t speaking Latin, but English backwards forcing him to “vow to protect the child come hellfire or brimstone.” Karl believes a [[satanic cult]] has summoned the child from the bowels of hell.  All of Samantha's previous boyfriends are dead except for one — Gabriel. Karl gives Gary Gabriel's address and suggests that he go talk to him.  That night, Gary tries to find out about Lucas' biological father. Samantha reluctantly admits that years earlier, she was part of a sort of [[cult]] and took part in a virgin ritual. Gary convinces Al to help him. Gabriel who is an [[ascetic]] and part of a religious cult is confined to a basement where he [[self-flagellation|self-flagellates]] and prays for God to save him.  He then reveals that he believes Lucas is the [[Antichrist]] and tells them to travel to [[Bethlehem]], [[Israel]] to find Gozamel the demon hunter. Gary and Al retreat to [[alcoholic beverages|drinks]] at a bar, where Gary bemoans how badly things have turned out. Al suggests he get a divorce, but Gary explains he loves Samantha and does not want to leave her. They view a television news report on end-of-world riots in Bethlehem — [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], ''[[Pennsylvania]]'' — and they realize that may be where they need to go. They travel to find Gozamel, who informs them they have to kill the child with the Knife of Destiny, which he inherited from his father, or the end of the world will ensue. Shortly afterwards, he crashes and is killed in the car accident, but not before he gives Gary the Knife of Destiny and tells Gary it is up to him now. He can use the knife or not but he must be killed on [[hallowed]] ground.  Gary arrives home to find Samantha with Miss Shaylock, a woman from [[Child Protective Services]]. They encourage Gary put Lucas to bed, but this goes horribly wrong, ending in Lucas burying Gary in a sandbox. Samantha digs him up, taking Lucas’ side for being a confused kid, and Gary screams that Lucas is the Antichrist. Samantha is devastated, and Gary later apologizes. He takes Lucas on a trip to Waterland (which the pope blessed at one point as hallowed ground) as a treat. Lucas and Gary actually start to bond as father and son as Gary teaches Lucas how to swim. However, Gary still plans to kill the Antichrist. He fills Lucas’ floaties with sand and sends him to his death, but sees a sign from God and realizes in his heart the only way to save the world (and anyone including the Antichrist) is through love. Gary dives into the pool and saves Lucas and then takes him for ice cream. Both of them apologize for trying to kill the other. It’s clear that Gary and Lucas have bonded with each other.  Suddenly, an [[amber alert]] for Lucas pops up on Gary’s phone. Police arrive to take Gary, and Miss Shaylock takes Lucas. Father Gospel kidnaps Samantha, and Gary escapes from the police to save her and Lucas, but not without help from the other stepdads.  Gary, Al, and the other stepfathers travel to the old nunnery where Father Gospel and his disciples prepare to kill Lucas in order for Satan to take his form. Gary stops Father Gospel but the altar begins to rise and the floor cracks open to the pits of hell. Lucas falls through the pit and Gary dives in after him. A demonic fire-demon rises from the pit and Gary is forced to make the decision of letting go of Lucas or going with him into the abyss.  He chooses not to let go and sacrifices himself with Lucas, and they disappear into the pit. However, they eventually emerge from it.  Father Gospel rises again with the Knife of Destiny, but Samantha knocks him out, and he tumbles into the pit to hell.  Weeks later, Gary and Lucas are finally doing what Gary’s dreamed of: racing in the Okatok [[soap box derby|Soap Box Derby]]. Lucas and Gary speed down the street aimlessly, now happy as father and son.

 In rural 1930s Quebec, Alice lives in house with older brother, known only as Frère, and their father Mr. Soissons, a [[recluse]] who is feared and hated in the village. Armed with rifles, Soissons and Frère forbid anyone from entering their property. Soissons has raised Alice as a boy, cutting her hair short and [[breast binding]] her, and tells her she is a boy whose penis fell off when she was small. Soissons also tells his children he created them out of clay. As Alice has doubts as to these stories, Frère finds her outside of the house reading a book, the memoirs of the [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]], that Soissons has banned. Frère [[rape]]s her. Later, Alice finds Soissons in the shed, where he is feeding pieces of food to a mysterious person in chains; Soissons describes this as a "just punishment," the figure being known as Juste. At night, Mr. Soissons enters his children's bedroom and inspects Alice, discovering she is pregnant. He begins beating Frère, whom he realizes has impregnated her, though neither of his children understand this.  Soissons commits [[suicide by hanging]]; Frère and Alice discover the nude body. They decide the body must be buried, but Alice declares they need a coffin and takes Mr. Soissons' horse to the village, where she has never been before. As she rides the horse, she feels sexually stimulated, until she comes across a church in congregation. Drawn in by the music, she leads her horse into the building, where the attendees and priest react with shock and anger. They drag her out, and force her to reveal that Mr. Soissons is dead, and that he had two "sons", one of whom is her. When she bites the priest's hand, he angrily orders her taken away. Several men take her to a barn and tie her to a pole. One of the churchgoers, a young man named Paul-Marie, then enters and unties her, tells her she is female, and notices she is pregnant. Paul-Marie tells her the villagers will come to the house since they know Mr. Soissons is dead, and that Alice will likely be confined to an orphanage or convent.  Alice returns to the house to warn Frère that the villagers will come, believing they are evil, and finds Frère trying to dismember their father's body to bury it. Frère picks up a rifle and declares himself the new master of the domain; Alice tells him to feel her belly, as she has experienced [[quickening]]. She then goes to the shed, where she frees Juste, a scarred and [[muteness|mute]] woman. Alice tells Juste she has learned where life comes from. Paul-Marie arrives to warn Alice and Frère that the priest, coroner, pathologist and armed police are marching to the property. Frère chases Paul-Marie off the land with his rifle, but Alice climbs onto Paul-Marie's motorcycle as they attempt to escape. Frère fires his weapon, killing Paul-Marie and causing the motorcycle to crash.  The villagers capture and restrain Frère while Alice stands over Juste with an ax. Alice gathers her belongings and goes back into the house, where she finds a charred corpse she refers to as Mama. As Alice's [[Rupture of membranes|water breaks]], she [[flashback (narrative)|flashes back]] to a little girl playing with a [[sparkler]] as a girl, in the presence of her mother.

Logan Lucky
 Jimmy Logan is laid off from his construction job at the [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]]. While visiting his ex-wife Bobbie Jo to pick up their daughter Sadie for a beauty pageant rehearsal, he learns that Bobbie Jo and her new husband are moving to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], making it even harder for Jimmy to visit.  Jimmy goes to a bar, run by his brother Clyde, an [[Iraq War]] veteran who wears a prosthetic hand. Max Chilblain, a pretentious British businessman and NASCAR-team owner, arrives with his friends and insults Clyde, leading to a fight with Jimmy. Meanwhile, Clyde sets fire to Max's car with a [[Molotov cocktail]]. On his way out, Jimmy yells "cauliflower," which Clyde recognizes as a codeword they used when they committed crimes as young boys. Next day, Jimmy reveals his plan to rob the Speedway, exploiting his knowledge of their [[pneumatic tube]] system for moving money.  Clyde agrees to the plan, and he and Jimmy recruit their sister Mellie, a convicted safe-cracker named Joe Bang, and Joe's dimwitted brothers Sam and Fish. They plan to break Joe out of prison and return him after the heist is complete, before anyone notices. Clyde intentionally gets himself sent to prison on a minor charge. Mellie, Sam, and Fish infest the Speedway's pneumatic tubes with cockroaches that Mellie had painted different colors, helping them determine which set of tubes to use. While gathering supplies, Jimmy meets former schoolmate Sylvia, who runs a mobile clinic in need of donations; Sylvia provides Jimmy with a [[tetanus]] shot, and the two strike up a conversation. Later, Jimmy learns that construction at the speedway is being completed ahead of schedule, forcing them to reschedule the heist for a week earlier, during the much busier [[Coca-Cola 600|Coca-Cola 600 race]] on [[Memorial Day]] weekend.  Joe and Clyde arrange for the prison's inmates to stage a riot, resulting in a lockdown to hide their absence. They escape by hiding under a delivery truck. Mellie meets them with a [[Ford Mustang (sixth generation)|Ford Mustang GT]], stolen from Bobbie Jo's husband. At the speedway, Sam and Fish destroy a generator with an explosive, forcing all vendors to accept cash only. Joe improvises an explosive from bleach, [[gummy bear]]s, and a dietary salt substitute, which detonates within the pneumatic tube system, allowing the crew to begin collecting all of the vendors' cash. The staff notice smoke coming out of the tubes, and security guards investigate, but a diversion set up by Jimmy and Earl, one of Clyde's bar patrons, prevents them from discovering the heist. The airflow in the tube delivering the money is reversed, causing Clyde's prosthetic arm to be lost. Making their way back to the prison, Clyde and Joe are recognized by Chilblain and his sponsored NASCAR driver Dayton White. The job is a success, and Jimmy makes it to his daughter's pageant in time to hear her perform his favorite song, "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]." Jimmy then abandons the money and anonymously alerts the police so they can retrieve it.  FBI agent Sarah Grayson investigates the heist. Due to the unwillingness of the prison authorities to disclose the extent of the riot, the refuting of Chilblain's eyewitness account by White (disgruntled because he crashed during the race because he drank some of Chilblain's energy drink as part of the sponsorship deal), and the speedway administration's satisfaction with their insurance settlement, the case is closed after six months. Joe is released from prison and returns to his old home to find a bag of money buried by a tree in his yard. Sylvia receives an envelope of money anonymously in the mail, as does one of the now released jail inmates who helped with the riot. It is  then revealed that during the heist, Jimmy purposely separated several bags of money from the rest, and sent them to the local dump with the regular trash. The rest he returned, to discourage any potential investigations. Jimmy also retrieved Clyde's prosthetic hand from the vacuum tube. Now working in a [[Lowe's|hardware]] store and having bought a house near his daughter and ex-wife's home, Jimmy happily reunites with his family at Clyde's bar, where they and the rest of the gang share drinks. Sylvia also arrives and shares a kiss with Jimmy. Clyde does not recognize one of the patrons, who turns out to be Grayson.

Loveless (film)
 In a [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad region]] city in 2012,</ref> critic Robert Koehler named the city as [[Saint Petersburg]], near Leningrad Oblast. }} students depart from school. One twelve-year-old boy, Alyosha, decides to take a path which leads him to a local river in a wooded area just on the outskirts of town. He throws a strip of tape on a tree. His parents, Zhenya and Boris, are in the midst of a divorce, with much animosity toward each other, and Alyosha is caught up in their bitter fights. His parents have divergent and incompatible personalities, and both have new relationships: Boris with Masha, a young woman who's pregnant with his child; and Zhenya with Anton, an older and wealthier man with an adult daughter who lives abroad. Alyosha overhears a fight between his parents, neither of whom claim to want him and are considering placing him in an [[Orphans in Russia|orphanage]].  One day, Zhenya realizes Alyosha has not been seen since the day before, when she came home late at night from a visit with Anton and assumed the boy was in bed. The [[Police of Russia|police]] see this as the simple case of a runaway child and expect the boy to return home within a day or two. When Alyosha does not return, a volunteer group specializing in the search for missing persons takes over the case and promptly initiates a thorough procedure to locate the boy. The only relative Alyosha could have sought refuge with is Zhenya's estranged mother, who lives several hours away near Moscow. Boris and Zhenya's trip to see her not only fails to provide clues to Alyosha's whereabouts, but is punctuated by tension, with both spouses berated by the bitter old woman. On the return trip home, Zhenya and Boris argue again: Zhenya says it was a mistake to marry Boris when she became pregnant, and she should have had an [[Abortion in Russia|abortion]]. Boris stops the car and abandons her on a rural roadway.  The search for Alyosha once again involves the police and covers an increasingly wider territory across the town and its surrounding areas. A search of an abandoned building from an old dilapidated city development project (which Alyosha's friend Kuznetsov identified as their usual hideout) turns up nothing.

 One year after [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s suicide, [[The Roulin Family#Joseph|Postman Joseph Roulin]] asks his son [[The Roulin Family#Armand|Armand]] to deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]. Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely weeks earlier Van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.  [[Père Tanguy]], a [[Montmartre]] art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] and look for [[Paul Gachet|Dr. Paul Gachet]], who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at the same inn that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Adeline Ravoux|Adeline Ravoux]], who was fond of Van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.  Throughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named René Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, was in possession of a gun, and had often drunkenly waved it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates René, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that René was capable of murder.  Dr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow. He admits there was an argument between them – Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of deteriorating Theo's health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, Postman Roulin later receives word from Theo's widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna]], thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of van Gogh's letters to her – signed, "Your loving Vincent."

Kumaran chases the murderer who corners him and halts him with a blow to the head. In the ensuring tussle, Kumaran manages to kill the murderer. A meeting with psychiatrist Aadhirai ([[Lavanya Tripathi]]) ends on a rough note when she deems him medically unfit to rejoin the police force. Later when he himself faces symptoms which attribute to PTSD, he mends his ways with Aadhirai who helps him overcome his disorder. A second murder happens in which a famous actress is killed. Kumaran visits the spot and finding the similar blood stains from the earlier murder and many other similarities, including the same brand of cigarette smoked by the murderer, he is stressed up and gets into a shock. Aadhirai finds him and treats him for his PTSD and makes him normal. He meets with Rudhran and introduces her to him as a motivational speaker. Kumaran, now fitter, sets out his investigation and finds out that a makeup man ([[Mime Gopi]]) must have done the murder as he is the prime suspect. Upon investigation, He also gets to know that both the makeup man and the gym trainer showed a totally different behavior, few days before they committed the murders. Kumaran tracks down the makeup man but he jumps to death before confessing anything.    Next Murder happens and the victim now is a renowned scientist Mr. Narayanan (Kathi Ravi). Kumaran tries to find some evidences in the scientist's home and he finds a book written by Rudhran. Thinking that Rudhran might know the scientist, Kumaran visits Rudhran's office and finds that his behavior has changed. His own dog starts to bark at him and he has also started to smoke recently, that too the same brand that was found in the earlier murders. Kumaran deduces that some strange thing is happening and Rudhran could either be murdered or become the next murderer. He nabs Rudhran when he shows his more ruthless and cold blooded side when he kills his own dog. So Kumaran takes Rudhran into custody and while signing on the FIR, Rudhran signs a different name, and then corrects it to his own sign. Kumaran notices this and finds out that, the first sign was signed "Pramodh".   A brief investigation reveals that Pramodh is a colleague of late Mr. Narayan when they worked together at Indian institute of neurosciences. A senior official Velayudham ([[Jayaprakash]]) after hearing the incidents of the case, reveals that Pramod was involved in a project called Project Maayavan, which could enable a person to store his memories into a hard drive which can be transferred to another individual by injecting a newly invented gel, which would house millions of nano-transmitters and when injected into the brain these transmitters will attach onto the neurons. When the person dies, his memories could be transmitted to another individual whose brain would already have been injected with the gel. The memories of the new person will first be erased and the old person's memories will be transferred via the nano-transmitters. This way the person (his memories) will not die and will live for ever. To prove his theory Dr. Pramod works day and night, and during this experiment he even sends a patient to coma, but he is not bothered about human life and wants to succeed in his mission. After Dr. Narayan becomes the Director of the Indian Institute of Neuroscience he stops Dr. Pramod's project.   Raged by this, Dr.Pramod uses himself as the subject and successfully transfers his memories in a hard-drive and then commits suicide. Once he dies his memories gets transferred to the Gym trainer (who was already inserted with the gel by Pramod). And once he dies, he transfers his memories to the make-up man and now to Rudhran. By the time Kumaran solves this and finds that Pramod's next target is an army general Major Sathyan ([[Jackie Shroff]]), Pramod who is now living in  Rudhran's body commits suicide and finally he successfully arrives into the major's brain. The major invites Kumaran and says that his technology will let him live for more than 1000 years and no one can stop him.   With a clue from Pramod's wife, Kumaran finds his secret lab where Pramod has his memories stored. Pramod successfully retrieves the hard-drive containing his memories black-mailing Karna and in the process killing him, his wife and his children and also killing Velayudham and DIG. He then kidnaps Velayudham and goes to the institute lab to let him switch to another body. Kumaran tracks him down and a gun-fight ensues. Finally Kumaran realizes that his girl friend (psychiatrist Aadhirai) is the next subject. If the major dies Dr. Pramod memories will transfer to Aadhirai's body, leaving Kumaran with a difficult choice.   Twenty years later, Kumaran is happily married to Aadhirai and they have a son. It is then revealed that Kumaran has trapped the major in his secret basement and has kept him alive all these years.

Eventually someone retrieved it from his grave and the medallion changed several hands.  But as the legend goes, anyone that has ever touched the stone died of unnatural causes.  In 1992 it was owned by a man [[Gajaraj]] who safely hid it in his house. One day as he was leaving his home after checking on the medallion, he is hit by a truck and killed.  Present day: Sengutuvan ([[Aadhi Pinisetty]]) and Ilango ([[Daniel Annie Pope]]) are two small time crooks that work for a local jewel smuggler Ramadoss ([[Ramdoss]])  They are pursued by a police sub inspector, but they manage to elude him. Sengutuvan has a crush on a girl ([[Nikki Galrani]]) he sees at the bus station every day.  But he never approaches her.  One day as Sengutuvan is watching the girl, another man pulls up beside her and tells her to get on his bike. He then rides up to Sengutuvan and introduces himself, informs him he is now engaged to the girl and that he should stay away from her.  Sengutuvan wishes to hear her voice once, but she doesn't say anything as the two leave.  A few months later Sengutuvan and Ilango see the couple, now married.  The girl, Chanakya([[Nikki Galrani]]), seems unhappy and is verbally and physically abused in public.  A Chinese businessman comes to the city looking to acquire the Emerald stone (Maragatha Naanayam).

He offers Rs 10 Crores for the contract, but no one would touch the job as they are afraid of the curse.  During one of their routine smuggling encounters, Sengutuvan and Ilango are caught by the police officer that was pursuing them.  They are taken into interrogation, where a senior police officer, sympathetic to their boss, reveals what they are doing is small time business and lets them go.  Sengutuvan who has bigger ambitions is disappointed and tells his boss they should do something big.  He, however, is not motivated.  Sengutuvan decides to pursue the contract to find the Emerald stone on his own and is later joined by Ilango.  Ilango convinces Sengutuvan to approach a local priest ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]])who could protect them from the curse.  Sengutuvan is unconvinced with the stories.  The priest then hands him a lemon, at which point the ghosts of the 132 people killed by the curse are revealed to Sengutuvan.  The priest tells them if they are going to pursue the stone, they will need to seek the help of one of the ghosts.  Back home Sengutuvan and Ilango complete the ritual to summon one of the ghosts,  Ilango's uncle who was killed by the curse. But before the ghost could appear they are interrupted by the news that Ramadoss has died from heart attack. They attend to his funeral and return home.  Ilango wakes up to find Ramadoss whom they buried the day before, standing in front of him. It turned out during the burial, the lemon fell out Sengutuvan's pocket on to dead hands of his boss.

The second is a man ([[Arunraja Kamaraj]]) decapitated by a freak accident.  The third happens to be Chanakya who Sengutuvan had a crush on, as she hangs herself.

They manage to escape the torturers and eventually manage to find the original.  Despite the warning from Ilango's uncle, the two men Sengutuvan and Ilango could not fight the temptation and touch the stone, and thereby cursed.  They arrange for a meeting with the Chinese businessman for the exchange.  But on the way, they are pursued by a mysterious driverless truck.  The sight of which reminds the ghosts how they were killed - by the same truck. John and the Chinese businessman are run over by the truck and killed.

He tells them they must return the stone to the grave of the king to lift the curse.  On the way to the grave site, they are pursued by both the mystery truck and Twinkle's gang hellbent on taking the stone from them.  The group manages to elude both and get to the grave site.

 ===Part 1 - March Comes in Like a Lion=== Rei Kiriyama is a 17 year old professional shōgi player and is the fifth person to become a professional in middle school. Rei was orphaned at a young age when his parents and sister were killed in a car accident, but is taken in by his father's best friend – Masachika Kōda, a professional shōgi player – when he realizes Rei's talent for shōgi. Rei and Masachika's children – Kyoko and Ayamu – fail to get along at all when Kōda begin's to show more favor for Rei, with Kyoko becoming particularly antagonistic towards the young Rei. After his adoptive father forces his children to stop playing shōgi when they are unable to defeat Rei, he decides to live independently, hoping that his absence might lessen the stress on the family brought on by his presence. He begins living alone in a single-room apartment in Rokugatsu-chō and stops going to school, only to start going to high school after a year delay.  When Rei defeats his adoptive father in shōgi in a professional match, he goes into a panic out of guilt, and ends up collapsing in the street when he accidentally gets drunk. He is discovered by the kindly Akari Kawamoto, who welcomes him into her home to re-cooperate. Waking up in the Kawamoto home in Sangatsu-chō and meets Akari's two sisters: Hinata and Momo Kawamoto, who are under the care of Akari, their grandfather and their aunt following the sister's mother's death. Rei begins spending time with the Kawamotos, practically becoming a member of the family and they even spend New Years together.   When spending the holidays with the Kawamotos, Rei runs into Kyoko and her boyfriend, middle aged professional shōgi player, Masamune Gotō. When Rei expresses his disgust with his adoptive sister's relationship with the older, married man, Gotō beats down a furious Rei. Rei then forces Gotō to agree to break off his relationship with Kyoko if he can defeat the elder shōgi player in the finals of Lion King shōgi tournament. Rei begins solely focusing on shōgi. When he faces off against Kai Shimada in the semi-finals, Rei completely underestimates his opponent, and loses the match in shame. Still reeling from the loss, Rei runs into Kyoko again, who believes that he told their father about her relationship with Gotō due to her being cut off financially. They are interrupted by the Kawamoto sisters, who had been coming to deliver a large box lunch to Rei. Kyoko spends the night at Rei's place but leaves the following morning, with Rei realizing that his relationship with his sister has left them in a state where they can never truly be siblings or strangers. Shimada faces off against Gotō in the Lion King final match, fighting for the chance to face off against Tōji Sōya, the reigning [[Meijin (shogi)|Meijin]] who has retained the position for over a decade. When Shimada emerges as victor against Gotō, Rei approaches the exhausted pro and asks to join Shimada's shōgi study group in hopes of bettering himself. Shimada accepts.   Rei begins making his way through the Newcomer shōgi tournament, with his rival and close friend, Harunobu Nikaidō excitedly pushing Rei along so the two might be able to face off against each other in the finals. However, Rei is shocked when he discovered that not only had Nikaidō had been eliminated, he had been hospitalized, due to a life long condition that leaves him constantly unwell. Rei realizes that Nikaidō's opponent, Junkei Yamazaki knew of Nikaidō's condition and stalled out the game as much as possible to exhaust Nikaidō and instigate a win by default. Rei faces off against Yamazaki in the Newcomer finals, ready to avenge his friend. However, as Rei is about to make a rash aggressive move instead of defending and improving his position on the board, he suddenly remembers Nikaidō's passionate words of advice to cherish his shogi more, and elects to take the safer option. Rei realizes that the reason Yamazaki played dirty was out of desperation to win, similar to Rei's own desperation to defeat Gotō in the Lion King tournament. With that, Rei emerges as victor and becomes the Newcomer King. Kyoko congratulates Rei on his victory.  After the conclusion of the Newcomer Tournament, Rei accompanies Shimada as he plays against Sōya. As the match plays out heavily in Soya's favor, Rei, who is acting as board commentator on the match, desperately insists that game could still be won by Shimada, only to be dismissed by Gotō. Seeing an unnoticed move that Shimada could have taken to turn the game completely around, Rei runs to Shimada, only realize that Shimada had already resigned. Sōya remarks that Shimada has unfortunately missed a potential move that would have turned the tide on the game, the very same move that Rei had noticed. As Sōya makes his exit, he turns towards an awestruck Rei and goes off in the rain.  ===Part 2 - March goes out like a Lamb=== After his victory in the Newcomer tournament, Rei is asked to have a commemorative shōgi match against  Tōji Sōya as a marketing ploy, as both of them are professional shōgi players who made their start in middle school, and that since Rei have become the Newcomer champion like Soya did, people had begun to expect Rei to become Meijin himself one day. Despite the gap of their skill level, Rei plays the game with the intention of winning, and finds himself entranced in the joy of playing with a powerful opponent. Rei also learns of Sōya's secret, that he is completely deaf for unknown reasons – a fact only known to the people who have faced him in sh  Meanwhile, Akari begins to worry as Hinata becomes increasingly depressed. One day, Hina returns from school in tears with a shoe missing and covered in dirt. Hina reveals that a friend of hers was being bullied at school, and in defending her friend, she became a target as well. Hina admits privately to Rei that while she was scared that she might become a target if she intervened, and even though no one – not even her teacher – helped her, she insists that she does not regret defending her friend and what she did was absolutely not wrong. Rei, who had spent his childhood isolated and bullied, is deeply touched by Hina's words. Feeling as though Hina saved him, Rei thanks Hina and promises to stay by her side. Rei initially tries to save up prize money from his shogi games help Hina, but when his teacher points out that the Kawamotos would never accept the money, he simply tries to be emotionally supportive of Hina instead. The bullying eventually comes to a head when Hina's homeroom teacher has a breakdown over the bullying, drawing the rest of the school's attention to the bullying and finally putting a stop to it. Rei apologizes for being ultimately unable to help Hina, but Hina insists that simply being on her side and listening to her was enough and thanks him.   The Kawamoto sisters are then visited by their long-absent father, Seijirō; who had left the sister's mother when he had a child with another woman. When he says he wants part of the family again, Rei is asked by Akari to help, who uncovers that Seijirō had been fired from his job and is being forced to leave his work-provided apartment, suggesting that he is only asking the Kawamoto sisters to join his new family out of desperation. Seijirō insists that Rei is not relevant to the discussion as he is not a member of the family, to which Rei responds with claiming that he has every intention of marrying Hinata at some point in the future, which shocks Hina. When Seijirō goes to pick up Momo from nursery school without telling the family, Rei snaps at Seijirō, but over steps his bounds and alienates the Kawamotos in the process. In despair, Rei once again fully dedicates himself to shōgi, with plans to once again drop out of school.   The Kawamoto sisters appear to give their father the benefit of the doubt, agreeing to his offer to spend the day at an amusement part. However, they ultimately decide that they do not want him to be part of the family and elect to cut him out of their lives permanently after having one last fond memory with him.   During a match, it is revealed to Masamune Gotō that his wife, who has been in a coma for several years, had passed away. Although heartbroken, Gotō ultimately realizes that with his wife gone, he's become better at shōgi now that he's not worried about her anymore. To that end, he breaks up with Kyoko so he can further put his focus on shōgi. Kyoko returns to the Kōda home in a drunken stupor, angrily asking her father how he can dedicate himself to the sport that had ruined their family. The following morning, Mr. Kōda speaks to Kyoko about the time she hit Rei after losing to him at shōgi. He shows her that if she had looked closer, she could have turned the game around to her favor, but since she didn't believe in herself, she failed to see the opportunity. He promises to Kyoko that no matter what she chooses in life, he will always support her.  Rei and Gotō face off against each other in the Lion King final, and play a very close match. Rei, still heartbroken over the schism he caused with Kawamotos, appears to have a breakdown while playing against Gotō. As the game continues, he breaks into tears. Gotō chides the younger pro for acting indecently while playing shōgi, before admitting defeat to Rei. As the journalists come to interview Rei, Rei runs past them to the Kawamoto home. At the door, he apologizes to Hina and the other two sisters for hurting them while trying to defend them, admitting that in the end, he was completely terrified of losing them. The sisters ultimately forgive him and invite him in for dinner. Meanwhile, Kyoko meets up with Gotō, teasing him over his loss before joining him at his side once again.

Marshall (film)
 In 1940, Thurgood Marshall is an [[NAACP]] lawyer traveling the country defending people of color who are wrongly accused of crimes because of racial prejudice.  Upon his return to his New York office, he is sent to [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] to defend Joseph Spell, a chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer, Eleanor Strubing, in a case that has gripped the newspapers.  In Bridgeport, insurance lawyer Sam Friedman is assigned by his brother to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, against his will.  At the hearing, Judge Foster, a friend of the father of prosecutor Lorin Willis, agrees to admit Marshall, but forbids Marshall from speaking during the trial, forcing Friedman to be Spell's lead counsel.  Marshall must guide Friedman through notes, such as when he advises Friedman to allow a woman of Southern white descent into the jury because of her assertive and questioning personality.  Spell swears to Marshall that he never had any sexual contact with Strubing and leads the lawyers to a patrolman who stopped Spell that night while he was driving Strubing's car.  Marshall and Friedman investigate Strubing's story that Spell tied her up in the back seat of her car after raping her and drove to a bridge to throw her over.  They wonder why Spell appeared to throw her over the calm side instead of the side with rapids.  Spell is initially interested in a plea bargain offered by Willis, but Marshall talks him out of it.  Later on at trial, though, a doctor testifies to finding pieces of skin underneath Strubing's fingernails, as well as bruises.  Strubing herself testifies that she was tied in the back seat when the patrolman pulled Spell over.  With this information, Marshall and Friedman confront Spell, who admits that he was lying about not having sexual contact with Strubing.  At trial, Spell testifies that Strubing's husband inflicted the bruises through repeated acts of spousal abuse.  That night, he went to see Strubing for an advance on his salary, finding a distraught Strubing wanting to have sex with him.  Spell consents, and the two have several sexual encounters that night.  Then Strubing panics about being found out and being pregnant.  Spell tries to drive her to a doctor, but Strubing has to hide in the back seat when the patrolman questions him.  A hysterical Strubing forces Spell to stop by a bridge where she runs out and tries to kill herself.  When Spell tries to stop her, she scratches him and jumps off the bridge.  But she survives and flags down a motorist making up a desperate story about rape.  When Willis asks why Spell didn't tell the truth to begin with, Spell talks about how black men get lynched in his native [[Louisiana]] for having sex with white women.  Over Willis's objections, Judge Foster allows Spell's statement to stand.  Before the verdict, Marshall has to leave for a case in [[Mississippi]].  A desperate Willis offers Spell a much lighter plea bargain, but Spell feels emboldened enough to turn it down.  The night before Marshall leaves, he and Friedman prepare the closing statement that Friedman then delivers on his own.  The Southern white woman has now become the jury forewoman, and she ultimately delivers a "not guilty" verdict.  Friedman happily breaks the news over the phone to Marshall, who moves on to his next case.  Closing credits note that Friedman went on to work in many civil rights cases, while Marshall himself has an illustrious career as the [[American Civil Rights Movement]]'s principal legal strategist and the first African-American Justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].  
Marjorie Prime
 In a future around 2050, 85-year old Marjorie (Smith) is experiencing the first symptoms of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer]]. To bring her comfort, her daughter Tess (Davis) and son-in-law Jon (Robbins) hire a service called Prime, designed to aid Alzheimer patients by creating holographic projections of deceased family members in order to "feed" them with memories as well as storing others, so they can "retell" them back in case the patient forgets them. Marjorie has chosen a younger version of her late husband Walter (Hamm), who passed away fifteen years ago. This choice disturbs Tess, as she does not trust the system's functionalities and therefore does not talk to Walter's hologram.  Soon, Julie (Andujar), Marjorie's caretaker, moves in with the family to watch over her and confides in Walter. Marjorie tells stories of her life to Walter Prime, and enjoys listening to him tell them back. Sometimes she asks him to embellish a story to make it better the next time he tells it, so the new story will become her new memory.  Walter Prime becomes curious about the real Walter's personal and professional lives and starts asking Jon about it. He appears to desire to know the reason why he couldn't tell his children how much he loved them. Jon tells Walter Prime a family secret who must never be repeated to Marjorie: she and Walter had a son named Damian who committed suicide forty years earlier, and before doing so, he killed the beloved family dog Toni II (a black French poodle who looked just like the family's old dog, Toni) to take her with him. Because of this, Marjorie hasn't said Damian's name since then. Despite Walter Prime's understanding about not telling her, Marjorie suddenly asks for Damian in a bout of dementia. Tess finds a Bible in the living room table and accuses Julie (who had given it to Marjorie) of taking advantage of Marjorie's condition to religiously manipulate her (since Marjorie has always been an [[atheist]]), which prompts Marjorie to urinate herself.  Later on, Tess and Marjorie are sitting on the couch talking. It is soon revealed that Marjorie has died, and Tess is talking to a Prime version of her; Jon recommended the Prime Program for his wife in order to help her cope with the death of her mother. Tess remains highly skeptical of the Prime program, especially because Marjorie Prime is constantly smiling and appears to be too understanding to really impersonate Marjorie's real personality. This leads Tess to realize she has chosen the aged version of her mother because this is the version she still has things she needs to say to. Meanwhile, in a flashback to when Walter was alive, he and his daughter are sitting on the couch watching the nightly news which shows “The Gates”, an art exhibit by Christo and Jean-Claude that ran in Central Park during February 2005. As was explained in an earlier scene, this is shortly after Walter and Marjorie’s son, Damian, commits suicide and kills Toni II. Walter and his daughter become emotional and embrace one another.  Sometime later, Jon is talking to Tess in the living room. It is then revealed it is a Prime version of her; a year has passed and Tess, apparently still unable to deal with Marjorie's death, has [[suicide|hanged herself]] during a vacation in Madagascar.

Years later, Tess' granddaughter is grown up and Jon is very old. In the house's living room, Walter Prime, Marjorie Prime, and Tess Prime talk about the old days, reliving old memories. They discuss a memory of the dog Toni, believing Tess was the one who picked him out. Walter tells them that Tess didn't pick Toni: Damian did. He picked her because she looked like their old dog, also named Toni, who died before Tess was born and whom she never knew existed. After hearing the story, Marjorie and Tess can remember Damian too. As Walter apologizes for saddening them, Marjorie responds by saying the only thing she can think of is "how nice that we could love somebody".

The gang, hearing the shooting, rush out of the bar and shoots the truck, mortally wounding Taylor and injuring Cole as they drive away to the parking lot near the amusement park and makes an emergency call. Infuriated, the bikers begin to chase down the truck.  Meanwhile, former marine Jake Carter ([[The Miz]]), now working as paramedic, with his partner Zoe ([[Anna Van Hooft]]), rescues a woman named Ana ([[Maryse Ouellet|Maryse Ouellet Mizanin]]) after a crane carrying bricks falls onto her car; she dies shortly due to loss of blood. As they depart, they receive a distress call coming from the parking lot.  The both arrive at the parking lot and find Cole and a dead Taylor, but three of the gang members arrive and intercept them. They attempt to escape in Cole's truck but the engine is destroyed by the gunshots and they escape. Another gang member, Alonzo ([[Bo Dallas]]), orders to surrender who shot Rodrigo or they will come to kill them. Deducing Cole to have lost a lot of blood, Zoe persuades Carter to stabilize his condition. As he heads back to the truck to retrieve the medical kit that was left behind, a gang member, Murphy ([[Naomi (wrestler)|Naomi]]) intercepts him but Carter kills her, while Zoe creates a diversion to allow Cole to hide safely but she is knocked out and taken hostage by Deacon ([[Curtis Axel]]).  Two floors away, Alonzo holds Zoe at gunpoint, threatening to kill her if Carter doesn't surrender the man responsible. Carter uses Taylor's corpse as a decoy and presents him to Alonzo and Deacon, who release Zoe. After the both gang members depart, thinking that the man solely responsible for Rodrigo's death is dead, Zoe calls out to Carter asking him to untie her hands. Alonzo and Deacon, anticipating that they could now get rid of both paramedics, shoot Zoe in the head, but Carter finds cover.  A leader figure Vincent ([[Sandy Robson]]) arrives and Alonzo confirms the job as done but Vincent argues that there were two men. Alonzo then starts searching for the second man and calls for back-up. As Carter heads back to Cole, he is intercepted by another gang member. During the ensuing fight, Cole manages to inject him with morphine and Carter finishes him off with an axe and they hide in the elevator.  Carter interrogates Cole why the biker gang members are after him. Cole confesses that he did it in order to protect his five-year-old daughter and reveals that the motive was debt. The man who ordered the kill was one of the bikers.  After Carter kills another biker, they manage to escape from the parking lot. A shootout ensues at the park, apparently killing Carter. Cole gets traced down by Alonzo and he verbally tortures him. Cole points out that Vincent had forced him to kill Rodrigo and if not his family would be in danger. Vincent explains that Rodrigo was "weak" and made alliances with other gangs. A betrayed Alonzo brutally stabs Vincent, but Vincent's brother Cash ([[Heath Slater]]) stops him and himself stabs him multiple times to death, saying that he is doing it for the Lost Legion. Even then, he wanted to kill Cole. Recovering from his gunshot wounds, Carter rescues Cole in an ambulance, not before Carter and Cole kills the remaining bikers including Cash. They head to a construction site to call for medical assistance.  Alonzo locates them and brutally wounds Carter in a fist-fight while Cole makes it towards the rooftop. Alonzo confronts Cole but Carter appears and throws him off the building to death. As they climb down the building, the medic teams arrive and treat Cole. Carter tells Cole that he will have to tell the police about the entire incident and that he will be going back to prison. Cole thanks Carter for saving his life and makes a statement that he can at least see his daughter grow up.

Mary and the Witch's Flower
  In a strange facility on top of a cliff, a fire burns as workers struggle to control it. A red-haired girl slips away with a satchel slung on her wrist, but is quickly seen and followed. A group of workers transforms into watery, bird-like creatures, who pursue the girl in the air as she escapes via a flying broomstick.  However, a large, bright-blue explosion envelops the creatures, and the girl falls off the broomstick, her satchel opening upon impact. The small seeds inside drop to the forest floor, causing trees to rapidly grow, and young birds to mature to adulthood and fly away. The broomstick is also quickly swallowed up by the growing foliage.  Young Mary Smith moves into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|British]] estate of her Great Aunt Charlotte ahead of her parents. The bored, friendless girl tries to make herself useful through chores, but she repeatedly creates messes in the process. A local boy named Peter teases her for both her clumsiness and her wild [[red hair]], which she hates.  Tib and Gib, Peter's cats, lead Mary to some mysterious glowing flowers. Zebedee, the estate gardener, identifies the flowers as "fly-by-night"; legend has it that witches covet the flower for its [[witchcraft|magical power]].  The next day, Gib disappears and Mary follows Tib to go look for her.  Tib leads her to a [[broomstick]] ensnared in a tree's roots.  Mary frees the broomstick, but accidentally bursts a fly-by-night bud on it.  The bud releases magical power in the form of a blue gelatinous substance, making the broomstick come to life and enabling Mary to ride it like a witch.  The Little Broomstick whisks Mary and Tib away to a complex of buildings hidden in the clouds. Flanagan, a fox creature who looks after student's broomsticks, scolds her for crash-landing her broomstick and tells her she's at the Endor College for witches.  The [[headmistress]] Madam Mumblechook assumes Mary is a new pupil with Tib as her familiar, and takes her on a tour of the college.  The tour reveals a campus with modern technology and conveniences, wherein witches take courses in the magic arts alongside fields of science such as [[chemistry]].  During the tour Madam introduces Mary to Doctor Dee, the College's renowned chemistry teacher.  Mary finds herself able to perform advanced spells such as invisibility.  Madam and Doctor Dee become convinced that Mary is a prodigy, because of her performance as well as her red hair, which turns out be a distinguishing feature among the best witches.  At Madam's office, Mary finds a spell book hidden behind a picture of fly-by-night. Mary admits that her magical ability comes from fly-by-night, and that Tib actually belongs to Peter. Madam's attitude to Mary suddenly changes, but she still lets Mary return home. The magic granted to Mary by the flower ends as the sun sets and Mary barely makes it home safely. That night, Madam sends a message to Mary informing her that she's kidnapped Peter, and demands that Mary turn the fly-by-night buds over to her. She and Tib fly back to Endor with the buds and Mary leaves the Little Broomstick by the school entrance. Madam and Doctor Dee imprison her and steal the buds, locking her in Doctor Dee's transformation spell lab. Mary finds Peter locked in the lab with her, and discovers Doctor Dee has been experimenting on animals transforming them into fantastic creatures, including Gib. In the spell book, Mary finds a spell that can undo all magic, and uses it to undo all the transformations and unlock the lab. As they try to escape, they find themselves cornered on a balcony, only for Flanagan to return the Little Broomstick, scolding Mary for leaving it lying around anywhere. They then try to escape, but Madam and Doctor Dee recapture Peter.  The Little Broomstick takes Mary to an isolated cottage. Within the cottage, Mary finds notes on transformation spells and a mirror that Great Aunt Charlotte uses to contact her. Charlotte reveals that the cottage was her previous home, and she used to be a red haired pupil that excelled at Endor (the one from the introduction). But one day Charlotte found fly-by-night on the campus, leading Madam and Doctor Dee to obsessively pursue a project to use the flower to transform all humans into witches.  When one of their experiments disastrously failed, Charlotte decided to escape Endor, taking the flower with her. Charlotte begs Mary to use her last buds to return home, but Mary vows to rescue Peter instead.  As Mary attempts to return to Endor, Madam gives chase, demanding the spell book back. An aerial chase ensues, in which the book is stolen and Mary falls onto the island where the lab is. The Little Broomstick breaks and the magic of the flower runs out. Mary makes her way across the island where the lab is and finds Madam and Doctor Dee are trying to use the flower to transform Peter into a witch. The experiment fails again, leaving Peter trapped within a gelatinous monster that rampages across the lab, draining the magic of all in its path. Mary gets the spell book from Madam after she is drained and tries to break the enchantments on a canister to reach the last fly-by-night bud. If she can regain her magic she can undo the spell binding Peter. She fails to reach it but realizes Peter can use magic now, and takes Peter's hand from within the monster and gives him the book with the spell to undo magic, allowing him to activate it. It undoes the failed experiment as well as all of Madam and Doctor Dee's research relating to it. The lab is destroyed.  Mary awakens in the ruins of the lab, which has been completely grown over. Flanagan returns her broomstick to her, having repaired it, and scolds her for leaving her broomstick lying wherever she wants. The two take the Broomstick back home, but while flying, Peter sees a Witch's Flower bud in her hair. She throws it away, stating she doesn't need magic anymore. The last bud of the flower explodes in midair, no longer needed, presumably ending the Witch's Flower.  In the credits, Mary is shown to be back home, on her way to school with Peter. The Little Broomstick is shown leaning against the wall at the manor, home.

Mayhem (film)
 Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or "Red Eye" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a coworker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office.  One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called "The Siren", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug. They go up to their boss John Towers' office to plead their cases, but Cara wins the boss over and has Derek laid off. Derek's friend Ewan is unable to help him, and he is given official notice of his firing by his coworker "The Reaper". Derek takes his things and is escorted downstairs by company security, dejected and afraid of being disbarred.  When Derek reaches the ground floor, he and the security guards find that the building is under quarantine; the ID-7 virus has been detected in the ventilation system. CDC agents have released a neutralizing agent into the building, estimating that it will take eight hours for the virus to be obliterated. Derek, realizing he's infected by the virus and will not be liable for anything he does, attacks the security guards and storms into the elevator, intending to get upstairs and kill his boss; however, he's sent down to the basement and beaten up by Towers' enforcer, "The Bull". The Bull kills Ewan by mistake, infuriating Derek further.  Derek is thrown into an empty office with Melanie, who is also infected. After Derek manages to get a phone call out to Vandacorp and ensure his innocence in the mis-handled case, the two decide to work together, break out of the basement, and kill the people on the top floor responsible for their respective bad situations. They first go up to The Reaper and kill two security guards to get to him, witnessing general mayhem along the way. The Reaper gives them his key card, but attacks Melanie, who kills him with a power saw. Derek and Melanie use the key card to get up to The Siren's office and take down an army of coworkers defending her. The Siren asks her long-suffering assistant Meg to get the key card for her, but Meg has destroyed it in a microwave, having been offered a promotion from upstairs to betray The Siren. Her work done, Meg kills The Siren with a pair of scissors, and Derek and Melanie go down to IT to come up with another plan to get up to the top floor.   Derek and Melanie convince the company's one IT worker to hack their other boss Irene Smythe's computer to get her to come down; Smythe is the one who denied Melanie the extension on her loan. Smythe agrees to give Derek her key card in exchange for Melanie. Derek agrees and restrains Melanie, but undoes the bolts on the chair Melanie is fastened to, allowing her to kill Irene and escape. On the top floor, Towers offers Derek a full partnership if he gives up his revenge mission. Derek refuses and fights his boss; the company's board of directors give him permission to kill Towers, and Derek shoves him over a railing, sending him falling from the penthouse to the ground and his death just as the quarantine is lifted and the virus is eradicated.  Derek takes a higher position in the firm for just long enough to sign off on the extension on Melanie's loan, then quits the company and takes up painting with Melanie. He advises the audience to take control of their own lives before it's too late, accompanied by a shot of Towers' body hitting the ground with a splat.

Memoir of a Murderer
 Byeong-soo ([[Sol Kyung-gu]]) was a serial killer. He has secret memoir recounting his killings, stating he killed them because "they deserved to die for their own atrocities." His first victim was his father, who was abusing the rest of his family. He explains that he buried his victims in some bamboo woods. His last victim was an unknown woman, and as he was driving away, he got in a car accident and injured his head, resulting in [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He stopped killing after the accident.  Byeong-soo, now a veterinarian, lives with his teenage daughter Eun-hee ([[Kim Seol-hyun]]), who cares for him and records his activities in a tape recorder for him to remember them. The former serial killer goes to poetry class, where everyone praises his poems on the murders. However, when he threatens to kill them, they don't take him seriously. A woman, Jo Yeon-joo ([[Hwang Seok-jeong]]), from the class develops a crush on him, irritating him. He does his best to drive her away, but like the rest of the poetry group, she always thinks his threats are jokes from his poems. Byeong-soo is also unlikely friends with a policeman Byeong-man ([[Oh Dal-su]]).  There is a new series of killings and the doctor wonders if he has started killing again.  The doctor has a rear ender accident with someone and there is unexplained blood at the scene. He sneaks some of it away as the other driver gets out. The driver says he hit a deer but Byeong-soo thinks he has found the psychopath killer. He follows the man and discovers a woman's body, and reports it to the police. Byeong-soo also gives the police a sample of blood. Despite his own findings that the blood was human blood, the police state that it was deer blood.  The man is revealed to be a local police man Tae-joo ([[Kim Nam-gil]]), who starts dating Eun-hee, meeting her while searching for Byeong-soo. He forbids her from seeing the young cop. To protect Eun-hee, he fights to keep his memory and he plans to kill Tae-joo. However it becomes apparent that his memories may not be as reliable as he expects them to be after attacking Eun-hee, mistaking her for the woman who was his last victim.  Byeong-soo's fears are apparently confirmed when he finds himself restrained to a wall, with Tae-joo hacking into his memoir. Byeong-soo attempts to reach his tape recorder to record Tae-joo's conversation, but apparently fails, barely managing to grab it and drops it. Tae-joo reveals he swapped the blood sample with deer blood, and threatens to kill Eun-hee unless Byeong-soo takes the blame for Tae-joo's crimes. Byeong-soo then wakes up, with no memory of what happened, and the entire incident is assumed to be a dream.  Byeong-soo orders Eun-hee to go with his sister Maria ([[Gil Hae-yeon]]) in a taxi and sends them off. Byeong-soo follows Tae-joo at night, and finds footage of Yeon-joo being held hostage. When he presents this evidence to the police, they suspect Byeong-soo himself is responsible. He later learns his memories have also made him delusional, as Maria had long before committed suicide, right after Byeong-soo killed their father. This proves he didn't send Eun-hee away with her aunt, and comes to think his daughter was killed by him instead. Byeong-soo gives up with his suspicions, and thinks he was actually responsible for Tae-joo's murders, especially when he remembers his annoyance and threats toward Yeon-jo. The police discover the bodies buried by Byeong-soo in the woods.   Byeong-soo remembers who his last victim was: his wife, whom he killed after discovering she was having an affair with another man. At this moment Byeong-soo learns that Eun-hee is not his biological daughter. After injuring his head in the car accident, he arrives home in a rage. Byeong-soo prepares to strangle a toddler Eun-hee, but his head injury causes his memory loss to kick in for the first time. When the pain goes away, he doesn't remember his wife's affair, instead comforting a frightened Eun-hee.   Back in the present and filled with guilt, Byeong-soo prepares to kill himself as he listens to the remaining recordings of Eun-hee on his tape recorder. However, he stops when another recording of Tae-joo confessing his crimes plays. Byeong-soo actually recorded Tae-joo's confession and threats to his daughter when he reached for the device. Byeong-soo realizes that he sent Eun-hee into a taxi with Tae-joo as the driver.  As Byeong-man prepares a search for Byeong-soo, he receives a call from the latter. Byeong-soo says that Tae-joo has his daughter, and plays the recording of Tae-joo's threats to the policeman, convincing him of the truth. The two work together to find Tae-joo, and Byeong-man follows him to a cabin in the woods. Byeong-man hides in the cabin and sees that Tae-joo has kidnapped Eun-hee, but Tae-joo kills the policeman as he prepares to apprehend him. As Byeong-soo arrives to the location, he records that he must save Eun-hee, and replaces her picture with Tae-joo's in a locket she gave to him to remember that he is a killer.  As Tae-joo is outside, Byeong-soo hides Eun-hee and Tae-joo attacks him. With his head injured again, Byeong-soo goes into a near-[[vegetative state]], and he unwittingly leads Tae-joo to Eun-hee's hiding spot. As Tae-joo approaches Eun-hee, he reveals the truth of her father being a serial killer, and that he has to pay the price for his sins. Byeong-soo's memory restores and he manages to fight back before Tae-joo can kill her. Tae-joo appears to gain the upper hand, but Byeong-soo chokes him at the last minute and rolls on top of him, using the same technique he did to kill his previous victims. Tae-joo stabs him with a broken vase, but Byeong-soo persists. Finally giving up, the choking Tae-joo says that he himself will have to be punished. Byeong-soo takes the broken vase and stabs him to death. Eun-hee is now horrified by Byeong-soo, now knowing the truth about her father. However, he tells her that she is not the daughter of a murderer because of his wife's affair. Byeong-soo is later arrested. Eun-hee listens to Byeong-soo's latest recording about the need to find her and that she is the only reason why he is still alive. When she visits Byeong-soo, his Alzheimer's disease is at its worst, and he thinks he is a kid and Eun-hee is his dead sister.  In the final scene, Byeong-soo is released from prison, walking on a desolate railroad. When he looks at Tae-joo's picture which is still on his daughter's locket, his perceptions take a turn for the worst: his Alzheimer's disease kicks in again, and he records, "Never trust your memory. Tae-joo is still alive," because many of his memories were unreliable before, he is suspicious of the memory of killing Tae-joo.

Danny has a younger sister, Jean ([[Elizabeth Marvel]]), and they have a younger half-brother, Matthew ([[Ben Stiller]]). Danny is close to his daughter, Eliza ([[Grace Van Patten]]), who is starting college at [[Bard College|Bard]] as a film student.  Eliza shows one of her sexually-obsessed films to her family, who try hard not to show they are taken aback and instead compliment its energy and production values.  Some of Harold's work has been selected as part of a faculty group show at Bard, but Harold refuses to be part of a group show.  Danny and Harold attend the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] retrospective of a friend and contemporary of Harold's, the more successful L.J. Shapiro ([[Judd Hirsch]]). There neither father nor son feels comfortable; Harold is stung by signs that the art world has forgotten him and chooses to literally run away down the street.  Danny meets Shapiro's daughter, his childhood friend Loretta ([[Rebecca Miller]]), but he must leave to chase after Harold.  Harold's younger son Matthew, a successful financial advisor to rock stars on the other side of the continent in Los Angeles, is in New York on business and meets Harold for lunch with an accountant friend. They try to counsel Harold to sell his Manhattan home and the sculpture stored there, since Harold and Maureen can barely pay the townhouse's utilities. Harold tells them that whether to sell the house will be a private family decision and stalks out. At a third restaurant he criticizes the prices, but orders lavishly once Matthew says he'll pay. Soon he decides he has been insulted and robbed as well, and the rapidly regressing Matthew is inveigled into another scene involving running, chasing and embarrassment. The two bond slightly in self-righteous indignation. That evening they pay a visit to Matthew's mother, Harold's second wife Julia ([[Candice Bergen]]), who has since married a man named Cody, a wealthy philistine. Julia tells Harold and Matthew that she is sorry she was not a better mother to Harold's three children; her directness makes them very uncomfortable and they can't leave fast enough. Matthew resents Harold for his preference for a life of art over money. "I beat you!", he screams at his father's departing Volvo.  Harold is diagnosed with a [[subdural hematoma|chronic subdural hematoma]]. He enters hospital, where as the days pass his children learn to manage his care themselves, after first leaning on Harold's doctor and nurse to take that responsibility. Outside the hospital Jean tells her brothers that the family friend who happens to be visiting Harold at the moment sexually harassed her when she was a child. Matthew and Danny let her walk away from them, then attack the friend's car with mounting exhilaration. At Bard to represent their father at the faculty group show, Matthew and Danny get into a fight, of sorts, on the quad; later, bloody and crying, each makes remarks in Harold's place, mostly about themselves. As Harold convalesces at Maureen's place in the country (the townhouse having been sold, despite Matthew's change of heart), it dawns on Matthew and Harold that Harold's favorite sculpture "Matthew", a lifelong object of resentment for Danny and Jean, was probably based on his feelings for the child Danny. Danny, who up to now has been solicitous toward his father, refuses to care for him while Maureen is away and accepts his brother's offer of a trip to California. On the way to the plane he meets Loretta, now single, and she suggests they go together to the screening of a film Eliza has made. In the basement of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney]] Eliza uncovers the sculpture lent by her grandfather, long believed to have been lost.

Jae-ha's girlfriend Hee-won begins to sense the connection between the two actors as they grow closer. Jae-ha himself is increasingly tense and agitated, confused about his feelings for Young-woo, until one day he accidentally hurts Young-woo during a rehearsal. Later, he encounters Young-woo in the empty theater and the two share a kiss which is witnessed by Hee-won. The next day, Jae-ha finds Young-woo at his house and drags him into one of Hee-won's storage sheds, where Young-woo acknowledges his feelings for Jae-ha and they kiss again. The two drive to the beach together, where Young-woo posts pictures of them on Instagram which prompt rumors about the nature of their relationship. They are soon found embracing in the car by Young-woo's manager and Hee-won. Young-woo is driven away by his manager as Hee-won confronts Jae-ha about his sexuality.  The day of the press conference for ''Unchain'', Young-woo tells Jae-ha that he posted those pictures on purpose, because he wanted to share their love with the world. He asks Jae-ha if he loves Young-woo, and begs him to tell everyone about their relationship. Jae-ha does not reply, but in the press conference dismisses rumors about them by saying that they were only acting, and requesting that people stop prying into their personal lives and instead focus on the play itself. Young-woo is devastated by this and visits Jae-ha's house while he and Hee-won are sleeping. The next day, after Jae-ha leaves, Hee-won becomes aware of another person in the house, and one of her sculptures is knocked to the ground and broken.  Young-woo arrives late to the first performance of the play, and as he and Jae-ha act, Young-woo's lines suggest that he hurt Hee-won, enraging Jae-ha. He asks Jae-ha to kiss him, and when he does, Young-woo whispers to him that the kiss was not in the script. In the final scene of the play, Young-woo acts out his character's suicide, but chooses not to use the safety mechanism, which causes him to hang himself temporarily. Jae-ha holds him up until the scene ends. Jae-ha finds Young-woo unconscious, but Young-woo wakes up and tells him backstage that now he is the perfect Singer, while Jae-ha is only a mediocre Walter. Young-woo leaves after the play, and Jae-ha and Hee-won reunite.

In a qualifying event for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], Molly is severely injured, ending her career.  Instead of following her original plan of attending law school, Molly decides to take a year off and move to [[Los Angeles]]. Once she arrives, she becomes a bottle-service waitress at a club, where she meets Dean, an ostentatious but unsuccessful real estate developer. She becomes his office manager, and he soon involves her in running his underground poker games. Many famous and wealthy individuals, such as movie stars, investment bankers, and sports players, are involved in Dean's game. Molly earns large sums of money on tips alone.  Molly is initially uninformed on poker topics but quickly learns how to appeal to the players to gain tips. In particular, she hopes to please the most successful player, Player X, by attracting new players to the game. Dean, upon seeing that Molly is becoming increasingly independent in running the games, attempts to control her, and then he fires her. Molly, having gained contacts through years of running the game, decides to create her own poker games. She rents a penthouse at a hotel and hires a staff to help her run games. Additionally, she contacts employees at clubs and casinos to try and spread word about her poker games. Player X, along with many other players, decides to leave Dean's games to play at Molly's game. Molly becomes increasingly successful, gaining more money while being pressured by Player X to raise the stakes for her games. Harlan Eustice, a skilled, conservative, and successful player, joins Molly's game. One night, after accidentally losing a hand to the notorious worst player in Molly's circle, Harlan becomes increasingly compulsive, suffering heavy losses (later, Molly finds out that Player X, who enjoys ruining people's lives more than the game itself, has been funding Harlan to keep him in the game). After Molly berates him for his unethical actions, Player X decides to change venue for his games, and the other players join him, leaving Molly.  Molly moves to New York, with the hope of beginning a new underground poker game. After reaching out to many wealthy New Yorkers, Molly finds enough players for several weekly games. Despite continuous success, she fears being unable to cover her losses when players cannot pay. Her dealer convinces her to begin [[Rake (poker)|taking a percentage]] of large pots, allowing her to recoup her potential losses but making her game an illegal gambling operation. One of her Los Angeles players is indicted for running a [[Ponzi scheme]]; Molly is investigated and questioned as to who attended her games. At this time, Molly becomes increasingly addicted to drugs, as the games have increasingly taken their toll. Her players also begin to include wealthy individuals from the [[Russian mafia]], among others. She is approached by several [[Italian mafia]] members who offer their services to extort money from non-paying players. After she declines, she is attacked in her home, where she is held at gunpoint and her mother's life is threatened. As she is about to return to her poker games, the FBI conducts a raid, a result of Douglas Downey, one of her players, acting as an informant. Molly's assets are seized, and she returns home to live with her mother.  Two years later, Molly has moved out and published a book where she names a few individuals that played in her games. She is arrested by the FBI and indicted for involvement in illegal gambling with the mafia. She enlists the help of Charlie Jaffey, a high-profile and expensive lawyer in New York, who agrees to help after he learns that she has been protecting innocent people who were affected by her poker games. While she is in New York awaiting trial, her father, Larry, seeks her out and attempts to reconcile with her. He admits that he was overbearing and that he treated Molly differently than her brothers because she had known about his affairs. Charlie reads Molly's book and becomes interested in helping her case, as he feels she has not committed serious enough wrongdoing to merit a prison term. Charlie negotiates a deal for Molly to receive no sentence and for her money to be returned in exchange for her hard drives and digital records from gambling. Molly declines this deal, fearing that the information about her players would be released, and she pleads guilty. The judge, deciding that she had committed no serious crimes, sentences her to community service, probation, and a $200,000 fine.

Her lawyer suggests appealing to a higher court but Devki has lost faith. Arya, still in shock and broken by the court verdict, tears away from Devki.

Mom and Dad (2017 film)
  The film begins with a mother putting on soothing music for her child as she sets her car on railroad tracks and leaves the child in the car to die.  The Ryans are a family of four with a strained relationship. Brent, the father, does not approve of his daughter Carly's new boyfriend; Carly is angry with her father, as well as her mother, Kendall, whom she considers out of touch. Carly also fights with her much younger brother, Josh, who annoys her. Carly is forced to cancel plans with her boyfriend, Damon, for dinner with her visiting grandparents.  As Carly is at school, an unexplained static starts transmitting through TV screens and radios. The effect is seen as the Ryans' housekeeper murders her own daughter with a meat tenderizer in front of a terrified Josh and a mob of parents rushes Carly's school in an effort to kill their children by any means they can. Carly sees one preteen, Evan, being coaxed by his mother to join her behind an iron gate only for her to stab him with a set of keys once he scales a fence. Carly escapes the school with her friend Riley and hides out at her house, where Riley's mom attacks and strangles Riley to death. Carly runs home in terror, running into Damon — who has killed his own father in self-defense — as she does. Damon tells Carly that the parents only want to kill their own kids, and accompanies her home to get Josh somewhere safe.  After an exercise class, Kendall goes to the hospital to be present for her sister Jeannie's baby, but the static transmits just after Jeannie gives birth, causing her to attempt to kill her baby daughter as Kendall protects her niece. Kendall escapes the hospital, seeing reports of the mass hysteria on television—the static gives parents a compulsion to slaughter their children. In an effort to protect her own children, Kendall heads home. Brent heads home as well, as he is bored at work.  Having discovered her brother cowering under his bed Carly leads him downstairs after dismissing the house keeper because she had just killed her daughter, Lisa. Upon seeing Carly with Damon at home, the hysteria fully overtakes Brent, and he knocks Damon out and attacks Carly. Kendall joins him upon getting home; Carly and Josh escape them and lock themselves in the basement. As Brent and Kendall start using a power saw to get through the lock, Josh pulls out Brent's gun from a backpack and fires continuously through the door, wounding his mother. Kendall complains to her husband about secretly getting a firearm with such an obvious lock combination (Josh's birthday) as he bandages her injury. Kendall and Brent bond over their shared desire to kill their children, and run a hose from their oven's gas pump to the basement in an effort to poison the kids. When Carly sees the gas, she rigs up a trap with matches at the basement door and hides with Josh in the house ventilation system. Brent cuts the door's lock off and opens the door, igniting the gas and triggering an explosion that knocks Kendall and Brent out and wakes Damon up.  Damon helps Carly and Josh evade their parents, but Kendall wakes up, stabs him in the cheek with a wire hanger and pushes him over a stair railing, knocking him out again. The parents close in on the kids, but are interrupted by the doorbell; Brent's parents have arrived for dinner. When he opens the door, his mother pepper sprays him and his father stabs him, revealing that the hysteria affects grandparents as well, with Josh begging his grandfather not to hurt his dad, and he briefly stops, allowing Brent to temporarily disarm his father. Everyone chases each other through the house. Josh evades Brent, who attempts to hide from his father in his car in the garage. Kendall chases Carly outside and hits her on the head, but Brent's mother attacks her.  Brent starts the car, drives it out of the garage, and crashes it, killing both his parents and knocking himself out again. Kendall prepares to finish Carly off, but Damon knocks her out with a shovel to the head.  Kendall and Brent wake up to find themselves restrained in the basement with Carly, Josh, and Damon watching them. They continue to exhibit symptoms of the hysteria, and the kids refuse to let them go. Kendall tearfully tells the children she loves them, and Brent continues, "But sometimes, we just want to—". The film ends before he can finish his sentence.  
Mon Mon Mon Monsters
 Lin Shu-wei is a meek, [[Nerd|straight-A student]] with no friends who gets harassed by his classmates. He has recently been framed of stealing the class funds, and is further humiliated in front of the class by a gang of [[Bullying|bullies]], consisting of leader Tuan Ren-Hao, his girlfriend Wu Si-Hua, Liao Kuo-feng and Yeh Wei Chu. Suspecting them to be the actual thieves, Shu-Wei confronts them at their hideout at the school's abandoned swimming pool's maintenance room. Ren-Hao mockingly confesses to his crime, stating that he needed the money to tune Kuo-feng's [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motorcycle scooter]]. Si-hua then puts Shu-wei's hand on her breast, making it appear as if Shu Wei did so on his own free will and framing him as a [[pervert]], with the bullies taking a picture of the scene and spreading it around the school, further degrading Shu-wei's reputation. Shu-Wei is then restrained by the neck with an animal control pole, threatened by Ren-Hao with [[corneal perforation]] from a [[Darts|wall dart]], and released.  Expecting to be overpowered, Shu-wei used his phone to audio record the entire encounter conversation with the bullies. However, his teacher, Ms. Lee, points out that if the bullies were accused of the crime, the bullying would only get much worse. She then encourages Lin to accept the blame for the crime, and assigns the three male bullies to work with him, under the guise of them being the classes most popular individuals and with the intention of making the four boys closer. The four are told to perform [[community service]] for the elderly, by feeding them. However, the bullies abuse the elders instead, painting their faces and making them "[[chicken fight]]" each other. Initially disturbed by the bullies actions, Shu-wei participates and becomes visibly happy as he has been accepted and is now part of the gang.  At the end of their day, they come across an elderly [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war]] [[veteran]] of the [[National Revolutionary Army|National Revolutionary Army's]] [[Army groups of the National Revolutionary Army#21st to 30th army groups|29th Broadswords]] unit suffering from [[dementia]]. They discover a locked box, and believe it to be filled with riches plundered from China, during the [[Chinese Civil War#Fighting subsides|Nationalist withdrawal]].They agree to return at night, to break open and steal the contents of the box. Upon their return, they are unable to open the box, and instead decide to take it back to the hideout. Unbeknownst to them however, a pair of female flesh-eating ghouls have made their home in the elderly home's elevator shaft, preying on both the mostly forgotten residents and the homeless. As the bullies start to leave, they come across the ghouls feasting on one of the elders. The older of the two flees into the shaft, while the younger attempts to pursue them. Terrified, the boys run out of the building, only to witness the younger ghoul get struck by a vehicle on the street. The driver flees the scene and the boys investigate the seemingly dead ghoul. When the ghoul tries to attack Kuo-feng, Ren-hao knocks her out with a shovel. Unable to leave the ghoul there, as there is a traffic camera pointed at the scene, the bullies take the ghoul back to the hideout, believing her to be dead. Meanwhile, the elder ghoul mourns the disappearance of her sibling.    That morning, the bullies search the box but find nothing but medals and photos. The younger ghoul reawakens and exhibits supernatural capabilities, such as regeneration, and the ability to climb on walls. As the ghoul confronts the boys, it accidentally steps in a ray of sunlight and its foot is burned by the sun's touch. The bullies immediately capitalize on this weakness, using a portrait of [[Sun Yat-sen|Sun Yat-Sen]] to subdue the ghoul, trapping her under a box. They eventually tie the ghoul to a pillar in the center of the room using chains. Si-hua is informed of the monster's presence, and the gang discover the monster's [[Human cannibalism|flesh-eating disposition]]. Ren-hao exults in having the monster as a captive, stating that since it's not a human, they can do anything they want to it. Shu-wei meanwhile, sympathizes with the ghoul, stating to her that the bullies will probably let her go after they've had their fun. Ren-hao extracts several of the monster's teeth and blood, with Si-hua sanitizing and using them as part of her bracelet. The boys further torture the ghoul, drilling a plate to cover her mouth and applying more chains and locks to her mouth.  Back at the elderly home, the war veteran, traumatized by the abduction of his compatriots, dons his old uniform and with broadsword in hand, begins singing an army song (中國的駱駝), inviting the ghoul to find him. The ghoul is attracted by the noise, and confronts the veteran, who identifies himself as [[National Revolutionary Army#Soldiers|Superior Private]] Li Reng-feng. Though briefly interrupted by a neighbor, who chastises the veteran for his singing in the middle of the night, the ghoul and the old soldier clash, which results in the ghoul being ejected from the fourth-floor window, still alive but with her right arm nearly completely severed. The veteran, unscathed in the clash, smiles and dies whilst still standing.  Back at the maintenance room, the bullies continue to torment their captive monster. After using clumsy attempts at religious exorcism and wrapping the monster in scripture, Ren-hao instructs Shu-wei to thank the monster, implying that the latter would have been the one tied to the pillar and tormented had the ghoul not been there. Attempting to find out more about their monster, the bullies take blood samples from the creature, and study it in the school's lab, noting the lack of any [[Red blood cell|red blood cells]] and the presence of eggs or spores on the monster's blackened cells, and that contact with normal blood cells causes the blackened cells to "infect" the blood cells, turning them black as well. They also notice that continuous contact with the sun causes the blackened cells to [[Spontaneous human combustion|spontaneously combust]]. Shu-wei does some research on the ghouls, identifying the younger monster as Lee Shiu-Jen who went missing in 1985, alongside her sister, known as the Voodoo Master. From the news article Shu-wei finds, it appears that the two went missing when they killed their parents, with the Voodoo Master using the dark arts to conjure a poison involving female menstruation, with the effects having backfired spectacularly as seen by the two girls' current state.  Shu-wei prints out the information he finds, and presents it to Ren-hao, stating that the ghouls are indeed human. Ren-hao tosses aside the information, stating that no matter what the ghoul was before, its current state is that of a monster. Shu-wei then asks what the purpose of keeping the monster is, and states that the monster would probably starve soon. The other bullies then decide on using Shu-wei as a living blood bag, to keep the monster alive. They further torment the monster by spraying blood at her, and terrorizing the ghoul by putting its head in a bird cage and dancing around it wearing face paint.  The next day, one of Shu-wei's classmates tampers with his chair, causing it to collapse when Shu-wei sits down. Contrary to his past behavior where he would congratulate the prankster and laugh along, Ren-hao beats the perpetrator to the point of hospitalization, in front of the entire class and Ms. Lee. Ren-hao justifies this, stating that only he would be the one that could beat Shu-wei. During the disciplinary meeting after the event, Ms. Lee, a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], attempts to correct Ren-hao's behavior with spiritual guidance. Infuriated at the mockery Ren-hao makes of her attempts, she strikes him repeatedly, and humiliates him by mentioning his family circumstances, with his alleged father being a criminal, and his mother being a prostitute.  Ren-hao is thrown into a rage, and takes out his anger on the ghoul, beating her severely with a bat. After noticing the monster's blood combusting, he alongside the rest of the bullies poisons Ms. Lee's drink with the monster's blood. During a basketball game, several hours after drinking the monster's blood, Ms. Lee spontaneously combusts upon contact with the sun. Video of this event is shown on the news, which the older ghoul notices, along with the [[School uniform|school's uniform]]. At a drinking party to celebrate the death of their teacher later, Shu-wei is offered several drinks by the bullies, but declines them out of fear of what happened to Ms. Lee. Out of spite, Si-hua drinks Shu-wei's drink, and Ren-hao states to Shu-wei that he could kill him "in a million ways", thus poisoning him would be pointless. Si-hua then expresses her exasperation at Shu-wei's continued involvement with the group, stating that he was the only one who didn't want to see the monster die, and that he could have released the monster at any time, mocking him for being meaningless as he wanted to be "the good guy" but never possessing any courage to actually do anything. Shu-wei later takes out his anger on an autistic convenience store clerk, wrecking the store and stealing its money.  The older ghoul begins systematically hunting down individuals wearing the school's uniform, regardless of their involvement with her sister's predicament. Her attacks include ambushing a student getting a drink at a vending machine, and slaughtering a bus full of students. Si-hua is on the bus at the time and manages to take a picture of the monster before the ghoul notices Si-hua's bracelet with her sister's teeth on it, and gruesomely kills her. In grief, Ren-hao pulls out hundreds of the younger monster's teeth. The monster also attacks an after-school program, slaughtering dozens of students, but sparing a pair of sisters.  The remaining bullies decide to eliminate the older monster, using her sister as bait. Ren-hao plans to lock both monsters in the maintenance room, then pour gasoline in through the sprinklers and throwing a match down the ventilation pipe. Ren-hao and Kuo-feng would be the ones pouring and igniting the gasoline, while Wei-zhu would be the lookout and Shu-wei would be the one locking both monsters in. Unbeknownst to the bullies, Shu-wei unscrews one of the window coverings, wanting the monsters to escape the trap, stating to the younger ghoul that he wants to at least do one thing right in his life.  Lured to the war veteran's room by the sound of her sister's cries, the monster follows arrows leading to the pool during the night. Before the monster reaches the pool, Shu-wei asks Wei-zhu the reason they had framed him in the first place. Wei-zhu replies that "it was fun." Realizing that it was likely he would receive similar treatment to the monster after their escape, Shu-wei sabotages the plan by calling Wei-zhu's phone when the monster shows up, causing the monster to corner and kill the latter. Shu-wei then locks himself inside the maintenance room, leaving Kuo-feng and Ren-hao outside to face the elder monster. Shu-wei disregards Ren-hao's pleas to let him in by stating that one day, the bullies would likely torture him to death, and that this was the only way that Shu-wei would be able to kill them off. The older monster kills Kuo-feng after he charges her with a hatchet, and kills Ren-hao outside the maintenance room door. Shu-wei retreats inside the room as the monster breaks down the door. Despite his pleas for the monster to spare him, the monster throws him around the room.   In an act of desperation, Shu-wei opens the window that he had previously unscrewed, with the sun rising at exactly the same time. The beam of light strikes the younger ghoul, who immediately begins burning from its effects and is unable to escape it due to the restraints. The older sister frantically shields the younger sister and tries to tear the chains off, instead destroying her fingers in the process. With both of them beginning to combust, the older sister embraces the younger sister, dying in each other's arms. Shu-wei leaves the maintenance hall and the bodies of the bullies behind in a daze.  Later that day, Shu-wei is assigned to lunch duty, being assigned to take care of the classes soup container. It is shown that despite the bullies deaths, the rest of the class still torments him. During lunch, he throws out the soup of another bullied student who had pitied him, telling her that she wasn't "like us". It is then revealed that Shu-wei had kept the rest of the vial used to poison Ms. Lee, and had dumped the rest of it into the soup container, infecting everyone else in the class, including himself. He then stands up, walks out the door of the classroom and screams as he combusts, with his classmates burning in the background.  
Monster Island (2017 film)
 A teenage boy journeys to a monstrous-like island to find his true form after discovering he's not a human being.  
Monster Family
 The film begins in Transylvania, where Count Dracula laments his loneliness among his three bat servants. Suddenly, he receives a call via cellphone from Emma Wishbone, who has mistakenly called him instead of a monster costume store (and unintentionally gains Dracula's interest). Rotten luck bedevils Emma until she reaches her bookstore, where she complains to her worker, Cheyenne, of all the troubles plaguing her family: * Her own bookstore is in dire financial straits * Her son, Max, is bullied in school and is a social outcast due to his nerdy mannerisms * Her daughter, Fay, is constantly sarcastic and rude, caring only about boys * Her husband, Frank, is constantly overworked and sleep-deprived Seeking to foster a sense of family, Emma makes a handful of monster costumes for her family- her as a vampire, Frank as Frankenstein's monster, Fay as a mummy, and Max as a werewolf -to wear to a "Monster Costume Party" presented by Cheyenne. Though the family is clearly not in the mood for such an outing, they nevertheless reach their destination. Unexpectedly, they receive a star treatment, only to discover that they have been mistaken for a monster-themed rock-and-roll band that was meant to perform at the party. Security deposits the family unceremoniously into the alleyway behind the building, where Emma finally snaps. The bad evening only grows worse when Baba Yaga- the infamous Russian witch -arrives to turn Emma into a vampire with a transformative curse (as Dracula wanted Emma to become a vampire, but retain her soul). The spell works, but unexpectedly turns the rest of the family into the monsters they were portraying, as the person(s) to be cursed would have to be unhappy for the curse to work. Enraged, Emma chases down Baba Yaga while her family splits up to visit various spots around the city. Fay goes to hook up with the guy she likes only to be discarded due to her appearance and Max makes the school bully run away. Emma eventually captures Baba Yaga, demanding to have her family returned to normal, only to discover the old witch's amulet (the source of her power) has worn out and must be recharged at the Eye of London, a massive focus point for ley energy and she disappears.  As the Wishbone family regroups at home, they realize they must catch the witch to return to normal.  With help from Cheyenne (who is unafraid of the Wishbones' new appearance), the Wishbones reach the airport.  Fay manages to get them on the plane as she can hypnotize people, which she does in abandom. Onboard the flight, Emma begins to spiral into the more violent side of vampirism, as her bloodlust kicks in and she attempts to bite one of her fellow passengers. A timely intervention from Dracula halts this, and he absconds with the confused and blood-hungry Emma onboard his own personal jet, leaving her family onboard the plane.  Meanwhile Baba Yaga keeps trying to get to London and ending up other places like Italy.   As her family wonders where she is, Dracula tries to talk Emma into running away with him. She initially considers due to not being happy with the issues in general with her family but when she refuses, Dracula unceremoniously tosses her from his jet.   As Emma regroups with the family by the London eye, she tells the family how she got separated from them. Dracula gets upset and tells his hunchback servant to prepare his snowflake machine, using the first few snowflakes to destroy the world in retaliation.   Meanwhile Baba Yaga gets her amulet charged and when Emma tries to take back the amulet, Baba sends them to Egypt. When Cheyenne tries to help, through events she ends up helping Baba and they become friends and Baba Yaga tells her about Dracula's plan to turn Emma into a monster and how Dracula imprisoned her and said he would free her if she did what he asked and that the only way for them to return to normal was to be happy as theirselves despite their forms.  Emma and the family while in the desert have hallucinations of a Oasis but when that fades they unknowingly walk in a circle.  Dracula shows off the snowflakes power to his servant and swears revenge on the humans.   Meanwhile in Egypt, Emma makes her children angry at her and as a result, Max and Fay go off on their own in separate directions. Emma then gets angry at her husband and pushes him away.   Dracula had been watching her, and seeing this, goes to get her as she wanders around until the bloodlust finally takes over and she almost attacked some tourists. Dracula narrowly saves them and takes her away to his castle.  As Frank and the kids find themselves in better luck, Frank comes across a Jeep of models, Fay meets a pharoah mummy guy who tells her she's pretty and shows her how to use her powers to became a sandstorm. Max gets mistaken for a piece of food by a camel and he chases it to a desert hotel with glass pyramids where Frank happens to be.   Dracula in his castle seeks to romance Emma and dances the tango and though she refuses at first, she agrees. After being shown to her beautiful new room, Emma (through flashbacks) realizes she misses her family. Cheyenne and Yaga then suddenly appear and explain the truth about what Dracula had done to Yaga.   Frank, Fay, and Max separately come to realize that their newfound luck doesn't compare to when they are together as a family. Yaga and Cheyenne then transport them to Dracula's castle.  Dracula’s hunchbacked Butler, Renfield, then tells them that if Emma doesn’t marry Dracula, he will shoot a magical snowflake into the sun, causing all life on earth to die (except for vampires as they don’t require sunlight).  The family confronts Dracula, with the intention of pouring homemade holy water in his bath and though they lose initially, they eventually turn themselves human (by realizing their love and need for each other, and becoming happy). They then gain the upper hand by exposing Dracula to sunlight, and permanently freezing him with his snowflake.   The Wishbones return home and their circumstances change; Frank stands up for himself at work after putting a photo of their family adventure with the frozen Dracula on his desk; Max stops getting bullied; and Fay meets a nerdy guy in a knight’s costume at a costume party that Emma throws at home. Baba Yaga, Renfield the hunchbacked Butler, and the three bats come and crash the party. The family takes another photo together, showing their happiness.

Mother!
  In the burnt-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an edenic landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls.  One day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study.  Before Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The Oldest Son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds his Younger Brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.  Upon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking.  The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious rituals. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the Herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions.  Mother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there. The havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her boy tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until his neck is inadvertently snapped. Devastated, Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and attempting to strangle her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment.  Mother and Him survive; she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is.

Mudbound (film)
 Henry McAllan and his brother Jamie struggle to bury their recently deceased Pappy during a rainstorm. When the coffin proves too heavy for the two of them, Henry flags the passing Jackson family for help. There is tension on both sides as the request is made.  The film then flashes back to 1939, when Henry buys a farm outside the fictional town of Marietta, Mississippi, in the [[Mississippi Delta]], and moves there with his wife Laura, with whom he shares a passionless marriage; their daughters; and his racist father Pappy. The Jackson family, led by tenant farmer Hap and his wife Florence, work the farm's cotton fields and dream of owning their own block of land one day. As World War II begins, Jamie commissions to become an [[United States Army Air Force|Army pilot]] flying [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bomber]] aircraft while the Jackson's eldest son, Ronsel, enlists in the Army infantry and commands a [[Sherman tank]]. While serving in Europe, Ronsel strikes up a romance with a white woman and enjoys relative freedom from racism.  Both families suffer the threat of poverty when the Jacksons' mule has to be put down and Hap breaks his leg. Florence, who worked for the McAllans as a housekeeper, has to give up the job to help cover Hap's work, and an unsympathetic Henry forces Hap to rent the McAllan's mule, cutting his wages in half. Laura takes pity on the family and pays for Hap's doctor. Later, when Laura suffers a miscarriage, she turns to Florence for comfort.  When the war is won, both Ronsel and Jamie return home. The handsome and charming Jamie rekindles his attraction to Laura, but suffers from alcoholism, PTSD and the scorn of his father, who disparages air force bombing as easy and anonymous killing. Ronsel, on the other hand, is defiant when Pappy demands that he use the back door of a general store instead of the front door, because he is black. Henry warns Hap and Florence that Ronsel's fiery streak could provoke problems for all involved if he does not keep it to himself, and Ronsel is forced to apologize.  After Ronsel witnesses one of Jamie's PTSD episodes, the two become friends. Jamie treats Ronsel with respect, allowing him to ride in the front seat of the McAllan's truck and sharing a bottle with him. He reveals to Ronsel that during his time in the Army, his life was once saved by a [[Tuskegee Airmen|black fighter pilot]], an incident which has stayed with him. Ronsel eventually shares with Jamie that his girlfriend gave birth to their son and shows him a photo. Outside of his friendship with Ronsel, Jamie's life continues to crumble, climaxing in a fight with Henry about the futility of the farm and Laura being miserable, after which Henry asks him to leave. As he prepares to do so, he and Laura confront their feelings and make love.  Pappy, who had previously seen Ronsel riding in the front seat with Jamie, finds the photograph of the white [[German people|German]] woman and their [[mixed-race]] child on the front seat of the truck. Ronsel, out searching for the missing photo, is picked up by Pappy and other members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and brutally beaten. Pappy then fetches Jamie and forces him to witness the "trial" prior to the lynching of Ronsel. Jamie tries to fight off the men, but is beaten and restrained, and Pappy forces him to choose Ronsel's punishment for the "crime" of [[miscegenation]], documented by his photo: to lose his eyes, tongue or testicles. If Jamie refuses to choose, Ronsel will be murdered. Jamie is forced to watch the tongue mutilation, and Ronsel is strung up and left for his family to discover. During the night, Jamie smothers Pappy to death and Laura lies to Henry that Pappy passed away peacefully. Hap and Florence take their children and leave the farm.  The film returns to the opening scene. Eventually Hap agrees to help, but refuses to allow his sons to assist in lowering Pappy's coffin, over which he also gives a brief eulogy. Jamie gives the photo of Ronsel's son to Florence, to pass on to Ronsel.  Jamie leaves his family in disgust. The Jacksons eventually settle on a farm of their own. A mute Ronsel makes his way back to Europe where he reunites with his girlfriend and son.  
Mubarakan
  The story starts with a couple travelling with their twins in a car who are exhausted and drowsing. Unfortunately, their car crashes and they die but the twins get saved. As the twins' paternal uncle Kartar Singh Bajwa ([[Anil Kapoor]]) is single yet and doesn't want to get married at all, he decides to give one son to his elder sister Arshveer "Jeeto" Kaur ([[Ratna Pathak]]) based in London and the other to his brother Baldev Singh Bajwa ([[Pavan Malhotra]]) who is settled in Punjab whilst he himself enjoys his single, lonely life in London.  Years pass and both twins grow up as Karan Singh Bajwa ([[Arjun Kapoor]]), living with his aunt Jeeto in London and Charan Singh Bajwa ([[Arjun Kapoor]]) who lives with his uncle in Punjab. Karan is a free man with no responsibilities whilst Charan is a simple, sweet man who is having a car showroom in Punjab. Karan has a girlfriend, Supreet "Sweety" Gill ([[Ileana D'Cruz]]) from the past 2 years. Unfortunately one day, they both are in the same mall talking on call as Sweety laughs and at the same time Sweety passes from the escalator where Jeeto falls down, and a misunderstanding arises that she was laughing on her. They have a big quarrel with each other, where Jeeto accuses her as a 'bad character girl' and takes a heavy dislike to her.  Meanwhile, in Punjab, Charan has also a girlfriend, Nafisa Qureshi ([[Neha Sharma]]) who is a Muslim and studying law. So, trouble starts as Baldev decides to marry Charan with a respectful girl. Jeeto suggests her husband Gurcharan Shergill's friend Akalpreet Sandhu ([[Rahul Dev]]) who is also willing to marry his daughter Binkle ([[Athiya Shetty]]) with a good man. Jeeto decides to send Karan to Punjab so that he can manage Baldev's restaurant in his absence. So, Baldev takes Charan to London where Kartar welcomes them. Kartar first takes them to his 'Mini Punjab' residence and then to Jeeto's. While in Punjab, Sweety comes with Karan too as her father also lives there. In London, Charan consults with his uncle Kartar that he doesn't want to marry Binkle as he is in love with Nafisa. Stupid Kartar decides to help him with his creative ideas. He suggests him to act as a drug addict in front of Sandhus so that they will refuse themselves. Next day, Charan does the same but as he sees Binkle, he falls in love with her. Binkle takes Charan on a house visit while Kartar hints out the silly habits of Charan's drug addiction to Manpreet ([[Karan Kundra]]), Binkle's brother.  Charan tries to tell Kartar about his sudden feelings but just falls off the window due to signal problems. Due to this incident, Manpreet turns evidently suspicious and assumes Charan to be a drug addict, to which Baldev opposes and misbehaves. Jeeto and Gurcharan ([[Lalit Parimoo]]), instead of defending Baldev, persuade him to apologize Mr. Sandhu for his misbehavior but Baldev refuses to do so as he thinks it is against his ego. They return home and blame Baldev for their disrespect in front of the rich Mr. Sandhu and also offend him for his poor past. Baldev tolerates to his limit and decides to return to Punjab. He challenges Jeeto that he will marry Charan exactly on 25 December with a girl much better than Binkle. They end their relationship. Meanwhile, Charan asks Karan to bring Nafisa at the airport so that he could talk about his feelings for her with his adoptive father. When they land in Punjab, Karan does what Charan asked and confronts them with Nafisa, but coward Charan doesn't dare to speak and Baldev misunderstands that Nafisa is Karan's girlfriend. This creates problems for Karan. Baldev overhears Sweety's father pleading for her daughter's marriage soon in a Gurudwara. So, Baldev takes Charan's purposal for Sweety who misunderstands her bond getting tied with Karan but later realizes it's tied with Charan. She gets upset and persuades Karan to do something about this. While back at London, Jeeto takes a proposal for Karan to Sandhu on which he agrees. They fix their marriage on 25 December too.  Kartar is split into Jeeto and Baldev's marriage events at the same date. To solve his problem, he suggests Baldev to have a destination marriage in London, where he was insulted. Baldev agrees and everyone flies to London. Kartar accommodates Sweety and her father in a five-star hotel, and Charan and Baldev in front of Jeeto's residence, yet he wants to be alone. Wedding preparations continue with Sweety, Karan and Charan's plans to get rid of their problems. Charan decides to tell Binkle that Karan is marrying her without his consent. So, both families along with their in-laws gather in a mall for shopping. Charan takes advantage of this and reveals Karan and Sweety's relationship on which Binkle is heartbroken, saying that maybe she has lack of anything as she is refused by every man. She also includes that she can't refuse herself and thought Charan would be revealing his feelings for her. Charan feels sorry for her and falls for her more because of her innocence towards him. Charan refuses to fight for his rights on which Karan invites Nafisa to London, increasing Charan's problems. Karan, Charan, Sweety and Nafisa decides to run with their love. But their plan fails when in the next morning Manpreet falls for Nafisa and Sandhu insists her to live at his residence. For this, Nafisa and Manpreet fall for each other. Nafisa starts ignoring Charan. Charan wants to reveal his feelings for Binkle but at the moment, Nafisa appears and confess her love for Manpreet and leaves. So now, Charan is fully for Binkle. Charan and Karan's marriages are planned at the same Gurudwara as the date. Beforehand, Charan and Sweety's engagement is held which Jeeto attends alone from her side. Later, Karan and Binkle's engagement is held which Baldev's family attends alone.  Before Binkle's engagement, Charan confess all the mishaps and misunderstandings happened and he is not drug addict too. He also reveals his feelings to her at last. Kartar dreams of his brother, the twins' father realizing him that he left his children to him and he is ruining their life.

The Mountain Between Us (film)
  In January, after the cancellation of their flight out of [[Boise Airport]] to [[Denver]] due to stormy weather, [[neurosurgeon]] Dr. Ben Bass ([[Idris Elba]]) and photojournalist Alex Martin ([[Kate Winslet]]) hire Walter ([[Beau Bridges]]), a local private pilot, to get them to [[Salt Lake City]] for connecting flights to Alex's wedding in New York (scheduled for the following day) and Ben's emergency surgery appointment in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. As they board a small plane along with Walter's dog, Alex asks Walter if he has filed a [[flight plan]], to which he says no, he doesn't need to, as "... it's still light out ...", they're flying [[Visual flight rules|VFR]], and they'll beat the approaching storm. He tells them he flew combat missions in [[Vietnam]], so unless somebody is shooting at them, they'll get there. Minutes after takeoff, Walter points out they're over the [[High Uintas Wilderness]], 'a million acres of pure ass nature'. Alex notices the storm is ahead as Walter suffers a [[stroke]], causing the plane to crash on a mountaintop. Ben, Alex, and the dog survive, with various injuries, but Walter is killed.  Ben buries Walter and tends to Alex's wounds, realizing they must find civilization for any hope of survival. Alex asks Ben to leave her behind as he has a better chance of surviving without her, but Ben refuses. Instead, he climbs a peak to see if there are any structures nearby. On his descent, he nearly falls off a cliff face. Meanwhile, a [[cougar]] approaches the plane wreckage and attacks and injures the dog. The cougar then approaches Alex within the plane wreckage but she wounds it with a flare. Ben returns to find a blood trail and rushes to the plane. He treats the dog and later retrieves the cougar's body and barbecues it for food.  Stranded for days with dwindling sustenance, Ben and Alex find strength in each other. Alex becomes skeptical that help will come, although Ben continues to insist they wait for help. After a heated argument, they both sleep, and Alex resolves that she will leave. At first light, she proceeds to leave the wreckage and starts a descent down the mountain. Ben awakens, gives chase, and eventually catches up with Alex, and they make up over past grievances.  While making shelter in a cave, Alex uses her camera to locate a man-made structure and spots a reflective material flashing at her. They agree to make it down to this structure but on the way, they become separated from the dog. Ben goes after him and finds an abandoned cabin. As he looks through it, Alex feels the ground beneath her cracking. She realizes she is standing over thin ice and she falls through into the ice cold water.  Ben hears the cracking and, seeing Alex fall, runs over, and pulls her out but she is unconscious and almost blue. Ben takes her to the cabin and starts a fire to warm her up. He takes the risk of giving her an injection he resourcefully crafted out of materials in the cabin. A couple of days later, Alex eventually wakes up to the sound Ben makes with the piano in the cabin.  The first time Ben leaves Alex alone in the cabin, she goes through his personal things and again listens to a voicemail recording from his wife. Ben catches Alex in the act. She says she didn't mean to be nosy, but she just wants to know something about him, especially since he has disclosed so little about himself and he never talks about his wife. He finally tells her his wife died two years ago from a brain tumor.  When Ben tells Alex he is going outside to get more wood for the fire, the culmination of all of their experiences together finally overcomes them.  No longer able to resist each other, they have sex. As Ben sleeps afterward, Alex takes his picture.  Deciding they still won't make it, Alex again asks Ben to leave her behind to find help and return. Ben initially agrees but has regrets about leaving her behind. He returns once more, and they begin to press forward again. As they make their way down, Alex begins to tire quickly. However, Ben still refuses to leave her behind. They fall asleep in the woods. The dog wakes Ben, as it has found 'civilization', a [[lumber yard|timber yard]] just down the mountain.  Ben wakes Alex and they make their way towards it, but Ben gets his leg caught in a bear trap. Alex tries to help him, but can't, so she keeps going, reaches the yard, and collapses in front of an approaching truck. The truck driver comes to her aid.  Ben wakes up in a hospital and goes to Alex's room, where he finds her with Mark ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), her fiancé. Mark praises Ben for saving Alex, to which Ben replies she saved him, and he leaves the room, heartbroken. Some time afterward, Mark tells Alex, "I told myself that if you ever lost a part of you (an arm or leg in her dangerous job as a photojournalist), I would still love you." But now, it's obvious to him that he has lost her heart.  Alex tries calling Ben, but he declines her phone calls until he receives pictures of him and Alex on the mountain. This encourages Ben to call Alex.  They meet at a restaurant in Manhattan, where it is revealed that Alex is now a part-time teacher who is uncomfortable flying, and Ben is now working as a consultant at trauma clinics, as his frostbitten hands have not recovered sufficiently for him to operate. Ben admits that he did not call Alex back because he thought she would be married, and Alex responds that she couldn't go through with it; she fell in love with Ben while they were together on the mountain. After leaving the restaurant, Ben admits to Alex that they survived because they fell in love.  Alex dismisses her feelings and reminds Ben of what he said on the mountain: "the heart is just a muscle." They hug goodbye, and as they depart in opposite directions, they feel deep regrets and burst into tears and run back to each other's arms.

The Mummy (2017 film)
 In 1157 A.D., several English [[Second Crusade|crusader knights]] bury an [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] ruby within the tomb of one of their members. In present-day [[London]], a construction crew discovers the tomb and a mysterious man is authorized to investigate the site.  In a flashback to the [[New Kingdom|New Kingdom era]], Princess [[Ahmanet]] is first in line to succeed her father Menehptre until his second wife gives birth to a son. Determined to claim the throne for herself, Ahmanet summons [[Set (deity)|Set]], who agrees to help her if she uses a mystical dagger known as the Dagger of Set to transfer his spirit into a physical form. After murdering her father, his wife, and their child, Ahmanet attempts to sacrifice her lover to Set but is captured by her father's priests and condemned to be [[mummified]] alive for eternity. Her [[sarcophagus]] is buried in [[Mesopotamia]] and submerged in a pool of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] so that her monstrous form will not escape.  In present-day Iraq, Sergeant Nick Morton and Corporal Chris Vail, while on Long Range Reconnaissance for the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], discover the tomb of Ahmanet after calling in an airstrike on an insurgent stronghold. Jenny Halsey, an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] who had a [[one-night stand]] with Nick and had her map stolen by him, arrives and investigates the tomb, correctly concluding that it is a prison. After Nick extracts Ahmanet's [[sarcophagus]] from the pool of mercury, Nick's superior, Colonel Greenway, places it on a transport plane headed to England. During the flight, Vail becomes possessed by Ahmanet's power after being bitten by a [[camel spider]] while inside the tomb. After attempting to open the sarcophagus, he stabs Greenway and tries to attack the group, forcing Nick to kill him. A huge number of crows then assault the plane, causing it to crash and kill everyone on board except for Jenny, who is parachuted off the plane by Nick.  Nick awakens a day later in a morgue in [[Oxford]], discovering that he has been brought back to life by unknown means, and he learns from Vail's sardonic ghost that he has been cursed by Ahmanet, who seeks to use him as a replacement vessel for Set. Ahmanet's [[Mummy (undead)|mummy]] escapes from the sarcophagus and begins feeding on rescue workers to regenerate her decomposed body. Turning the workers into zombie minions, she lures Nick and Jenny into a trap, forcing the two to fight off the minions as they unsuccessfully try to escape.  Ahmanet also recovers the Dagger of Set from a [[reliquary]] in a nearby church. At the last moment, however, unknown soldiers appear and subdue Ahmanet. Their leader, [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Henry Jekyll]], explains that Jenny is an agent of Prodigium, a [[secret society]] dedicated to hunting supernatural threats. He reveals much of his own history and confirms that Nick was cursed when Ahmanet's tomb was opened. Although first welcoming Dr. Jekyll's help, Nick (as well as Jenny) becomes horrified to discover the doctor's intention to complete the ritual, allowing Set to possess Nick completely, in the belief that this will render Set vulnerable and allow his evil to be ended forever.  Meanwhile, Ahmanet summons a spider to possess a Prodigium technician and frees herself from captivity, wreaking havoc, death, and destruction in the process. After verbally sparring with Nick, Jekyll succumbs to his own dark impulses and transforms into [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Edward Hyde]], his sadistic and murderous alternate personality, even as Ahmanet wreaks havoc outside unbeknownst to them. Nick rebuffs the repulsive Hyde's offer of an alliance between them, and Hyde attacks him. However, Nick manages to stop him with the serum Jekyll uses to suppress his evil side. He and Jenny then escape from Prodigium, but they run into Ahmanet once again. She steals back the dagger, summons an army of deceased crusaders to serve her, and creates a massive sandstorm that ravages London, with Nick and Jenny narrowly escaping her grasp. The undead knights slaughter the Prodigium soldiers in the tomb discovered during the film's opening, and Ahmanet finally recovers the ruby and places it in the dagger's pommel, granting her all that she needs to free Set aside from Nick himself.  Guided by the spectral Vail, Nick and Jenny flee into the [[London Underground]] tunnels, but it is revealed that Vail is still under Ahmanet's control and they are soon attacked by Ahmanet's minions. Ahmanet captures Jenny and drowns her, hoping to break her hold over Nick. Nick is beaten up by Ahmanet until he gives up and lets himself embrace Ahmanet, using it as a ruse to steal the dagger and shatter the ruby. However, he sees the lifeless Jenny and bets on stabbing himself. Nick's body is partially possessed by Set, who proceeds to join Ahmanet to uphold his end of the bargain. However, looking back at Jenny's dead body, Nick regains control, using Set's powers to overpower and suck the life out of Ahmanet. Once Ahmanet is transformed back into a shriveled mummy, Nick harnesses Set's powers to resurrect Jenny, saying goodbye before succumbing to Set's nature and disappearing. Soon, Jenny regroups with Dr. Jekyll, and they tensely discuss if Nick, now fused with Set in an uncertain way, will use his powers for good, evil, or something else entirely. Ahmanet's corpse is lowered into a locked pool of mercury within the Prodigium base for safekeeping. Meanwhile, in the desert, Nick resurrects Vail, and the two set out on a new adventure.  
Murder on the Orient Express (2017 film)
 In 1934, famous Belgian detective [[Hercule Poirot]] solves a theft at the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem. The [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive]]—who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth to be a curse — wants to rest in [[Istanbul]], but must return to London for another case. His friend Bouc, director of the Simplon [[Orient Express]], offers him a room aboard the train.  Unscrupulous businessman Edward Ratchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threatening letters from an unknown party, but Poirot refuses. That night, Poirot hears strange noises coming from Ratchett's compartment, and later sees someone in a red [[kimono]] running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers.  The next morning, Poirot discovers Ratchett was murdered during the night after having been stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the other passengers as repairs begin. Evidence indicates that Ratchett was murdered by one person, and Caroline Hubbard, a fellow passenger, claims that a man had been in her compartment in the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. Though the family paid the ransom, Daisy was murdered nonetheless. Ratchett's true identity is revealed: he was John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and murderer. The shock of her death caused her mother Sonia to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, Colonel John Armstrong, then committed suicide. The family's nursemaid Susanne was wrongly suspected of complicity, leading to her being arrested and subsequent suicide in police custody, only to be found innocent afterward.  More evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief, and, in Mrs. Hubbard's compartment, the button of a conductor's uniform. The uniform is later found, as is the red kimono — in Poirot's own suitcase. Hubbard is suddenly stabbed in the back; she survives but cannot identify the culprit. Poirot discovers many of the passengers have direct connections to the Armstrong family and uncovers their hidden pasts. While interviewing governess Mary Debenham, Doctor John Arbuthnot shoots Poirot in the shoulder, claiming responsibility for the murder, but Bouc stops him from killing Poirot. Poirot realizes that Arbuthnot — a medical doctor and former army sniper — never meant to kill him.  Poirot confronts the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how Cassetti died. The first is simple but does not meet all of the facts: A murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train at a previous stop, murdered Cassetti, and fled at the stop as the train left. The second is more complex: with every single suspect connected to the Armstrongs, Susanne, or her trial in some way, they all had a motive against Cassetti. Poirot predicts that they acted together. Hubbard is revealed to be Linda Arden, a former stage actress and aspiring director, and Sonia Armstrong's mother.  Hubbard confirms the latter, admitting that she planned the murder and had recruited everyone else to help her. All the other passengers and the Conductor, Pierre Michel (Susanne's brother), took turns stabbing Cassetti. Mary wore the kimono, and Arbuthnot stabbed Hubbard without endangering her life, to convince Poirot of a lone killer. Poirot challenges the passengers and Michel to shoot him with a confiscated gun since he is the only one who can expose their plot; Bouc can lie, but Poirot, obsessed with truth and balance, cannot. Hubbard grabs the gun and tries to kill herself, but it is not loaded; Poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.  With the train back on track, Poirot concludes that justice is impossible in this case, as Cassetti deserved death; for the first time, Poirot will have to live with a lie and imbalance. He presents the lone killer theory to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] police, allowing the others to leave on the train. As he disembarks, a [[British Army]] messenger asks him to investigate a [[death on the Nile]]. Poirot accepts the case.

When Munna goes to see him, he once again asks him to drop his idea of dancing. Meanwhile, the dance clubs in Mumbai have blacklisted Munna and his friends, so Munna decides to try his luck in Delhi.  At a club in Delhi, Munna clashes with a guy called Balli and beats his mates.

One day, some gangsters attack Mahender and Munna saves his life. After that Mahender brings Munna to [[Delhi]] and declares him to be like his brother. Mahender tells Munna that he wants to become a good dancer, because the girl he loves, Deepika "Dolly" Sharma ([[Nidhhi Agerwal]]) is a dancer in a club. Munna advises Mahender to give Dolly a gift.  Mahender, instead of personally offering the gift, asks Munna to hand it to Dolly. Munna gives Dolly the gift and lies to her that he is a courier boy. Dolly and Munna become good friends after they meet each other a few more times. During their meetings, Dolly tells Munna that it is her dream to become a renowned dancer and that she would like to win the Dancing Start contest, to be held soon in [[Mumbai]].

When Dolly enters the flat, she finds Balli hiding in there, who tells her that Mahender would keep her as a sex slave and nothing else. Hearing this, Dolly runs away from the house. When Mahender comes to know about the incident, he attempts to kill Balli. Munna and Mahender's other friend step in and stop Mahender from killing Balli in his rage. During this incident Munna comes to know that Mahender is married and that he was married against his will. After losing Dolly, Mahender gets depressed and Munna promises Mahender that he will get Dolly back.  Munna returns to Mumbai and coincidentally finds Dolly who is there to participate in Dancing Star, the contest she had mentioned to Munna earlier. Dolly tells Munna that she wants to win the show so that she will be able to face her father, as she ran away from home to pursue her dancing career. Munna changes his mind to take Dolly back to Mahender and decides to help her in winning the show. Munna asks his friends to help Dolly by becoming part of his dance group. Munna had previously told Dolly that he cannot dance. One day, Dolly finds Munna dancing and training her dance group and finds that Munna had been lying to her.  Munna tells Dolly the truth. Dolly asks Munna to be her partner at the dance competition. Meanwhile, Mahender comes to Mumbai in search of Dolly. Mahender acknowledges that Munna is betraying him. Mahender brings Munna's father Michael to Delhi and gives Munna 24 hours to bring Dolly to him or otherwise his father would be killed. Dolly and Munna go to Delhi and Dolly tells Mahender that she loves Munna and leaves his house. Munna, Micheal and Dolly leave for Mumbai. Balli finds them and tries to beat them up, but instead, Munna beats Balli and his goons. During the fight Balli shoots Munna in the leg. Munna still goes onstage and performs with Dolly, and they win. Mahender, later, accepts Munna and Dolly's love and they stay friends.

In 1978, Lionel trashes Jeffrey's collection of bones and orders him to make friends at school.  During school, Jeffrey imitates spasms, clears his backpack, and makes loud noises, catching the attention of aspiring artist John "Derf" Backderf and his friends.  Jeffrey inspires Derf to draw him in various situations; drawings that would later form Derf's graphic novel ''My Friend Dahmer''.  Derf and his friends form the "Dahmer Fan Club," using Jeffrey for a variety of pranks such as sneaking him in every club yearbook photo, and conning their way to a meeting with then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Walter Mondale]] during a school field trip to [[Washington, D.C.]]  Jeffrey is eager to introduce his new friends to his family.  But Joyce starts relapsing into chronic [[mental illness]], leading to increasingly bitter fights between her and Lionel.  To cope, Jeffrey turns to [[Alcoholism|drinking heavily]].  He also starts killing animals himself.  The jogger Jeffrey has a crush on turns out to be Dr. Matthews, the [[Pediatrician|physician]] of one of Derf's friends.  Jeffrey fakes a cold so that he can get an appointment with him, and he can examine Jeffrey naked. Dr. Matthews becomes uncomfortable during the hernia exam when he notices that Jeffrey has an erection. When Jeffrey returns home, he retires to his room and masturbates to the incident.  The following night, Jeffrey [[Necrophilia|fantasizes about being with Dr. Matthews's corpse]].  He starts stalking Dr. Matthews with a [[baseball bat]], but never goes through with attacking him.  Jeffrey's father moves out while Jeffrey's away on the field trip.  After the trip, Jeffrey makes some attempts to stay connected to his friends such as bringing a date to the prom, but ultimately drifts away from them.  Right before graduation, Joyce leaves the house to live with relatives, taking Dave with her.  At graduation, Lionel hands the keys to both the house and the family [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen]] to Jeffrey, leaving him completely alone in the family home.  That evening, Derf spots Jeffrey walking home alone, with blood on his fingernails.  Derf offers a ride to Jeffrey, finding him living alone with no plans for the future.  Derf tells him that he's leaving for college the following day and offers him his drawings of Jeffrey, which he declines. He menacingly invites Derf inside for a beer, but Derf turns him down. As Derf walks back to his car, Jeffrey picks up a baseball bat and is about to strike him with it, although he later puts it down. As Derf gets in the car and drives home, he notices the bat. Jeffrey never has contact with his high school friends again.  The next morning, Jeffrey drives around and picks up [[hitchhiker]] Steven Hicks from a concert.  The closing credits note that Steven Hicks was never seen again, and that Jeffrey Dahmer admitted to killing 17 men when he was finally arrested.

My Little Pony: The Movie (2017 film)
  The ponies of [[Equestria]] prepare for their first Friendship Festival, overseen by Princess [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Twilight Sparkle|Twilight Sparkle]] in Canterlot. The festivities are interrupted by an invasion of monsters commanded by the broken-horned [[unicorn]] Tempest Shadow, who uses magical [[obsidian]] orbs to [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrify]] Twilight's fellow princesses; [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Princess Celestia|Princess Celestia]] gives [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Princess Luna|Princess Luna]] incomplete instructions to seek help from "the queen of the hippo" before they are both petrified. Twilight flees the city alongside her five pony friends – [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Pinkie Pie|Pinkie Pie]], [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]], [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Rarity|Rarity]], [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Applejack|Applejack]], and [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Fluttershy|Fluttershy]] – and her [[European dragon|dragon]] assistant, [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Spike|Spike]]. Tempest is contacted by her superior, the Storm King, who reminds her to gather all of Equestria's princesses for him to harness their magic through his mystical staff, and promises to restore her horn in exchange.  Twilight's group travel to the desert city of Klugetown in search of the aforementioned "[[Hippopotamus|hippos]]". A feline [[Confidence trick|con artist]] named Capper offers to escort the group, secretly intending to sell them to settle a [[debt]]; however, he develops a genuine friendship with them. Twilight discovers an atlas that reveals the "hippos" to be [[hippogriff]]s, exposing Capper's treachery. After the group evade a pursuing Tempest aboard a delivery [[airship]], Tempest brings Capper to guide her to them, but he deliberately misdirects her to atone for deceiving the group.  During a lunch break, the airship's birdlike Captain Celaeno and her crew reluctantly allow the group passage, revealing themselves to be former [[Air pirate|pirates]] that have been forced into the Storm King's service. Rainbow Dash persuades the pirates to defy orders and take the group to the hippogriffs' kingdom on Mount Aris. In celebration, she performs a Sonic Rainboom that inadvertently gives their location away to Tempest, forcing the group to escape in a makeshift hot air balloon before Tempest destroys the ship with the pirates and Capper on board.  The group reach Mount Aris to find it deserted; while exploring the ruins, they become trapped in an underwater cavern, where they are saved from drowning by the [[Hippocampus (mythology)|seapony]] Princess Skystar and led to her undersea home of Seaquestria. Skystar identifies her kind as the hippogriffs, transformed by a magic [[pearl]] used by her mother, Queen Novo, to hide from the Storm King; Novo demonstrates by turning the ponies into seaponies and Spike into a [[pufferfish]]. When Novo denies them the pearl to use against the Storm King, Twilight desperately attempts to steal it while letting her friends unknowingly distract the seaponies. She unwittingly triggers an alarm, prompting the outraged queen to banish the entire group to the surface.  Abandoned by her friends over her actions, Twilight is abducted by Tempest and brought to the Storm King in Canterlot to have her magic absorbed; en route, Tempest gains Twilight's sympathy when she divulges how she lost her horn in a monster attack as a filly, which caused her own friends to shun her for her dangerously unstable magic. Meanwhile, after Spike alerts Twilight's friends to her capture, Capper, the pirates, and the hippogriff Skystar return to help them infiltrate Canterlot and mount a rescue. The Storm King retaliates by conjuring a [[tornado]] in the city with his newly empowered staff, betraying Tempest as well. Twilight saves Tempest from the tornado and reunites with her friends, who work together with her to take the staff. The Storm King hurls an obsidian orb at the group to reclaim the staff, but Tempest jumps in his way, petrifying them both. The Storm King's body falls and shatters, while the group use the staff's magic to revive Tempest, who returns the stolen magic to restore the princesses and the damaged city.  The Friendship Festival resumes, and the ponies celebrate with all of the allies Twilight's group have made on their adventure. Tempest is disheartened by her still broken horn until she is convinced by Twilight to join the party by producing a [[fireworks]] display with her magic, happily accepting the group's friendship.  
My Happy Family
 Manana (Ia Shughliashvili), a 50-year-old woman, decides to leave her family, husband, children, and parents. Her act to abandon her family is considered shameful in her society.  The reasons and rationale for her decision are initially and largely unknown to her family, and seem to remain a mystery to them throughout the entire story. Her perspective, however, is slowly disclosed to the audience.  Manana’s decision to challenge the religious expectations of women in her community gives “My Happy Family” an enlightened feminist streak, owing much to its central performance.  Manana, a school teacher with a career and income of her own, rents a small flat on the outskirts of town. At a local market, and quite by coincidence, she runs into a former high school classmate who invites Manana to attend their 35th high school reunion.  Attending the reunion and visiting with her former friends, a devastating secret is revealed. Her husband, Soso, had an affair while married to Manana and fathered a boy, who is now 13 years old.    Weeks later, posing as a meter-reader for the gas company, Manana visits this woman and her son as a way to see them both in person. While living in her flat, Manana also discovers her brother Rezo has spoken to her new neighbors about her life, her decisions, and her situation, and while her brother seems to believe his actions are an attempt to "defend" his sister from strange men, Manana views his actions as an intrusive violation of her privacy, dignity, and personal agency.    Meanwhile, Manana's own son who still lives with Manana's parents and his father brings his pregnant girlfriend to the family home to announce his surprise marriage.  Manana's daughter is heartbroken to learn her new husband is having an affair (which Manana had accidentally discovered, but had not disclosed).  The film ends as Manana poses several important questions to her husband Soso, and the audience is left to wonder what his responses might have been.

My Teacher (film)
 Second year high school student and [[archery]] enthusiast Hibiki Shimada has never felt romantic love all her life. This comes despite befriending Megumi Chigusa and Kosuke Kawai, two lovestruck teenagers who shamelessly flaunt their feelings for the school's [[mathematics]] and [[visual arts]] teachers, Masato Sekiya and Sachiko Nakajima, respectively.   One day, Hibiki wrongly sends Chigusa's love letter for Sekiya to Kosaku Ito, the school's [[history]] teacher. Volunteering to take it back, she ends up becoming attracted to him. Days after their meeting, Hibiki is further fascinated by Ito's kindness, as he is well-known among the school as a stern and cold person. Ito takes Hibiki to a hospital when he spots her limping with a wounded leg, helps her finish an assignment after hours, and frequently gives her a ride home. Meanwhile, Chigusa quietly drops her romantic pursuit when she finds out that Sekiya is in love with Nakajima. However, Hibiki and Kosuke learn shortly after that Nakajima is in love with Ito when they overhear her confession to Ito, who rejects her.  Eventually, Hibiki professes her love to Ito before the finals. She makes a deal with him: if she manages to score over 90 in the history test, he will allow her to love him. Along the way, Hibiki is discouraged from reaching her goal by Nakajima and Ito himself. She regains her spirit after a pep talk with Yusuke Fujioka, an archery student from a neighboring school. Her efforts bear fruit when the test results are out. During the [[Cultural festival (Japan)|cultural festival]], she approaches Ito in a wedding dress and pledges that she will love him forever. Unexpectedly, Ito kisses her. The next day, words of the kiss spread among the school. Hibiki is suspended, while Ito is called for disciplinary action. When the two meet later, Ito decides to end their relationship. Dejectedly walking home, Hibiki is comforted by Fujioka, who confesses his feelings for her.  The result of the disciplinary meeting is announced the next day: Ito will leave his post. As she is still suspended, Hibiki does not learn about it until Chigusa hurriedly goes to her home and pleads her to meet with him one last time. Kosuke, angry at Ito's halfheartedness, gives him a tongue lashing about abandoning Hibiki, asking him whether the words he said at the disciplinary meeting — that he sincerely loves Hibiki — were lies. Each encouraged, Hibiki and Ito race for a final meeting, where Ito promises to wait until Hibiki's graduation for them to begin a relationship.  Around one and a half year later, Hibiki graduates. Chigusa has found love in an underclassman, while Kosuke is still attempting to woo Nakajima, this time as an adult. As she is walking home, Hibiki is greeted by Ito. They hold hands and Hibiki comments on the size and warmth of his hands.

Myr vashomy domy!

Naalu Peruku Nalladhuna Edhuvum Thappilla
 Naalu Peruku Nalladhuna Edhuvum Thappilla takes its title after the famous line in Nayakan -- but there's a bit of a twist. In the Mani Ratnam film, the philosophy was framed around have-nots. The justification was that it was okay to stick it to the establishment that did nothing for you, because how else would you take care of the other have-nots around you? In Naalu Peruku, directed by Dinesh Selvaraj, this philosophy is turned on its head. Early on, a friend tells Prabhu (Shariya) that there's no use trying to do the right thing. He offers this variation on the Nayakan line: Nothing is wrong as long as no one finds out about it, as long as you don't get caught. The twist deepens when we discover Prabhu's father, a former cop named Ponvinayagam (Aruljothi), is the most honest man on the planet, someone who turned down crores for saving a business tycoon because he was just doing his job and you can't put a price on a good deed.  But Prabhu, who needs five lakhs, has other ideas. This is a fascinating character. His mind is okay with bending the rules but his guts don't cooperate. His hands shiver when he faces a cop. He cowers in fright when threatened by his cohorts. Will he be able to pull off the big one?  Look away from the sometimes aggressively showy filmmaking and an ill-advised stab at screwball comedy in the second half (involving a Sivaji Ganesan fan), and you have some solid writing. I'm not usually a fan of narratives that stop periodically to reveal that what you thought you just saw wasn't really what happened  but the reveals here are cleverly done and they come together convincingly. The return of an actor-aspirant from the early parts of the film is an especially nice touch. What Naalu Peruku lacks is that certain something that sets a Soodhu Kavvum apart. But I liked the fact that the moralising is kept to a minimum, and there's no lecturing. When a desperate Prabhu tries to rob a restaurant owner, he discovers that his father works as a security guard there. In a lesser movie, he'd slap his head and transform into a good man. Here, he just becomes... less bad than he would have been without this discovery. Sometimes, a true-to-life touch like that is enough. <ref name="filmcompanion"></ref>

Nails (2017 film)
 Dana Milgrom, a track coach and fitness enthusiast, is struck by a hit-and-run driver while crossing the street. She briefly dies before being revived by paramedics. When she wakes in the hospital, her body is battered, her legs are paralyzed, and she is connected to a [[medical ventilator]] through a [[tracheal tube]]. Unable to speak, she is forced to use a [[speech synthesis]] program. Her husband Steve helps her adjust to the program and assures her that he will attempt to get her back home soon. That night, Dana believes someone has entered her room. The nurse assistant, Trevor, checks the room for her in the morning but says no patients from this wing could have wandered in. When Dana insists a man is harassing her, she is assigned psychiatrist Dr. Stengel. As Steve insists the hospital staff take better care of her, Dana's daughter, Gemma, explores the hospital, unaware that a ghostly figure has observed her.  After an incident in which her ventilator fails, the hospital is forced to take Dana's claims more seriously. Though doubting foul play, hospital director Elizabeth Leaming authorises CCTV cameras to be installed in Dana's room. The cameras do not capture the next attack, where the same ghostly figure attempts to kill Dana. Dana's frantic emergency calls summon Trevor. The ghost leaves when Trevor enters; though he says he saw nothing, he tells Leaming that he felt a presence. Dana researches the hospital's past, learning that an orderly, Eric Nilsson, murdered several children before committing suicide. Trevor claims ignorance of Nilsson and tells her to ask Dr. Stengel about the hospital's history. Stengel reveals that Nilsson, a troubled former patient, was hired as an orderly once he was discharged. Because he collected fingernails from the children's ward patients, he was given the nicknamed "Nails".  Dana becomes convinced that Nails's ghost is haunting her and that Steve is having an affair with a new athlete, Ashley. Steve believes Trevor to be responsible for Dana's attacks. Trevor himself is overworked. Though he helps her as he can, he exasperatedly tells her to seek help from her husband when Dana insists on being discharged from the hospital. Nails makes contact with Dana through her speech synthesis program, threatening to kill her. When she asks why he has targeted her, Nails carves an answer onto her body: "because I miss you". Separately, Trevor finds an old record for Dana under her maiden name. Dana is revealed to have been one of the child patients Nails tended. Trevor sees live video footage where Nails attacks him; Nails kills Trevor off-screen, then mocks and kills Leaming, who has attempted to call the police.  Ashley, who came to hospital to visit Dana with Steve and Gemma, is possessed by Nails and kills Steve. Knowing that Nails will attempt to kill everyone, Dana tells Gemma to leave with her. Gemma refuses and forces Dana to come with her. Dana, who has grown stronger and has been practicing breathing on her own, has Gemma pull out the tracheal tube and put her in a wheelchair. The two race to escape the hospital as Nails kills the few remaining staff members, including Dr. Stengel. To save Gemma, Dana sacrifices herself; Gemma suffers shock after seeing Nails murder Dana. Emergency workers attend to Gemma after she escapes the hospital. When they ask who is responsible, all she can tell them is that Nails killed everyone.  
Napping Princess
 ''Napping Princess'' takes place in two concurrent settings: a near-future Japan, and Heartland, a fantastical realm.  The main character, Kokone Morikawa, has strange dreams of Heartland while taking naps.  In these dreams, Heartland is a society entirely revolving around cars; the King's castle is a car factory, and his subjects all come to it to make a constant stream of new cars.  His daughter, Ancien (who appears as a younger Kokone), has a "magic [[tablet computer|tablet]]" computer she uses to give life to various machines: notably, a blue toy bear named Joy, and a motorcycle named Heart.  The king disapproves of this, however, and orders Ancien confined to her tower.  Additionally, the society of Heartland is under threat from a [[kaiju|gigantic monster]] of molten metal called the Colossus.  The king builds [[Mecha|giant robots]] to face the Colossus.  Ancien, spying a motorcycle-driving subject of the king's named Peach, decides to ally with him and seek to defeat the Colossus together with him, while the king's chief adviser Bewan plots against the king and Ancien alike.  In normal Japan, Kokone is finishing up her school term, considering where to go to college, and reconnecting with old friend Morio who has returned from Tokyo from his first year in college.  Kokone lives with her single father Momotarō; her mother perished in an accident while Kokone was still young, and Kokone complains that her father never told her much about her mother.  Momotarō is an eccentric car mechanic and has a jacket similar to Peach's, a blue bear doll, a motorcycle, and a cracked tablet, all similar to the ones seen in Kokone's dreams.  The situation takes a turn for the worse when Momotarō is unceremoniously arrested three days prior to the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Tokyo Olympics]] and accused of stealing the car company Shijima Motors' secrets.  A suited figure who looks identical to the Heartland king's evil adviser visits the Morikawa home, and is overheard to be searching for both the tablet and Kokone.  Via text message from jail, Momotarō warns his daughter not to trust the adviser, who is named Watanabe.  The message includes a picture of a younger Momotarō, his wife, and Watanabe.  With Morio's help, Kokone evades Watanabe and his men and recovers the stolen tablet and bear doll, driving away in the family's motorcycle.  They also discover a business card for Isshin Shijima, the chairman of Shijima Motors, and consider visiting him for help after Kokone is told that her mother, Ikumi, was the daughter of the Chairman.  The two take a nap in the motorcycle, visit Heartland where they dream of the motorcycle soaring through the sky, and are surprised to find on waking up that the motorcycle has driven itself to [[Osaka]] overnight before running out of gas.  Kokone's attempts to contact her father via the tablet seemingly fail, but surprisingly enough, the "magic" seems to work in the real world when a request to the tablet's e-Heart chat for train tickets results in an attendant giving them paid-for [[Shinkansen]] tickets to Tokyo.  There, Kokone seeks an audience with the Chairman, while Morio learns that mechanics from Shijima Motors were the ones who saw Kokone's message and had bought the tickets for the pair.  The mechanics explain that after the chairman's daughter had a falling out with her father and eloped with Momotarō, they used this chat to keep in contact with Momotarō, who had been continuing his wife's [[self-driving car]] [[computer programming|programming]] and research.  Ikumi had run a project researching self-driving car technology years ago, but Ikumi's father, as chairman, refused her proposal at the time.  Kokone has a final dream of Ancien and Peach's adventures, but unlike earlier dreams, Kokone appears as a separate bystander rather than as Ancien.  Ancien seeks to empower one of the giant robots with her magic tablet over the objections of the captain.  While the empowered robot engages with the Colossus, the captain turns off the engines.  Ancien frantically attempts to reignite the engines, but falls off the robot.  Peach keeps her in his grip, but she loses her grasp.  Appearing now as Ikumi (rather than a young Kokone), she swears to help out Peach one last time, then falls to her death and cracks the tablet's glass.  Kokone understands that the bedtime stories she was told as a young girl of "Ancien and the Magic Tablet" by her father that she has been dreaming of were actually stories of her mother.  Now, Shijima Motors has changed course and wants to use the once ignored technology to impress the world during the Olympics with self-driving cars, hence Watanabe's frantic hunt for the tablet.  Kokone, prominently carrying Ikumi's old bear doll Joy, finds Chairman Shijima, who talks of his regrets.  The action shifts to Heartland, where Bewan/Watanabe detains Kokone.  He describes his plan to overthrow the King via letting the King's giant robots fail, and then to prominently save the kingdom with his own giant robot.  The King orders Watanabe arrested, while Peach enters the remaining robot to do battle with the Colossus, which Kokone empowers with the tablet.  Watanabe manages to emit a "curse" from his cell phone to sabotage the robot, and the kingdom is briefly engulfed in flames.  Regardless, Peach and Kokone are able to prevail over the Colossus, albeit via flying into space and crashing back to Heartland.  In the real world, Kokone and her father Momotarō are now stuck in the rafters of the building while Watanabe is carried off, and Momotarō is holding onto Kokone just as Peach once had for Ancien.  The people beneath, and the self-driving motorcycle Heart, in seeming fulfillment of Ikumi's claim to be there for the family one more time when it is most needed, are able to drag a giant balloon into place; as the family falls, they hit every banner to slow their descent, and survive the fall thanks to the balloon.  A safe Kokone, seeing the company's motto on the banners explains that her name must have been based on the company's motto, a combination of "heart" ([[Kokoro (disambiguation)|kokoro]]) and "wing" ([[:ja:はね|hane]]).  During the credits, scenes of Momotarō and Ikumi's courtship, and the original tests of her software, are shown.

On the opening scene we see the rock where the river flows, the shot is long and beautiful as the whole film. Namme is Ali’s daughter with three mature brothers whose ideology of life is completely different, also Namme and her father live entirely exceptional from the other members of the family. One brother of Namme is Muslim guy, the other one is kind of atheist phenomenon and a teacher in single-pupil class, another guy is Christian Orthodox priest who participates in building of church, on the other hand Ali and Namme perform some pagan rituals and heal people with the water which is sacralized by the mystic fish that was inherited to the family by their ancestors, somehow family should hold the role of fishminder and Namme is obliged to follow her father’s path because her brothers totally refused “father’s icon.”  During this silent-rhythmic and visual acoustic environment director tactically leaves this magical space and shows us urban surroundings and life, also building of weir is infiltrated in this quiet narrative. Because of some technical development for instance the building of weir evokes water pollution and fish becomes sick. Also there is an issue with the puritanity that the Namme isn’t allowed to be in love affairs or this kind of relationships because her and water’s power becomes useless. However she falls in love, power fades away step by step and Namme slowly becomes unable to cure people. She faces the dilemma: private life or sacralized traditions of family that can help people, finally she emancipates from the background and lets the fish go. In one of the latest shot she walks on water and  fades away with the fog and maybe becomes the part of the universe, maybe she continues her private and non-mystic life, that’s on the decision of the audience.

He is later found in warehouse hanging from the ceiling, tortured, shot, and his face covered in an animal mask, very much like the doll they received.    The killer continues to taunt the team, sending them clues as he kills more people, which includes a lawyer and a doctor. Ranjith follows one of the clues and finds the killer. But before he could take him down, the tremors he has been experiencing lately slows him down. The killer knocks out Ranjith and gets away. When his team arrives, they inform him about a dead body in one of the buildings. But, Ranjith already knows and describes what he would find without seeing it.

Emmanuel has a nephew, Christopher ([[Krishna]] in Tamil and [[Karthik Jayaram]] in Kannada), but he lives in the US.    Ranjith gets admitted to the hospital, where as he continues to look at clues, he concludes it must be Christopher, as he has the motive, means and the know how. After checking with immigration services, they find Christopher did arrive in India not too long ago. A police officer went to Christopher's house to investigate and finds all the clues, but before he could alert his team, he is killed.

There, he finds Joseph and Vandana standing on the floor with nooses around their necks.  After a long struggle, Ranjith manages to overpower Christopher and hangs him. The press arrives at the site, and Ranjith tells them Christopher is another victim of the serial killer.   A few days later, Joseph and Vandana meet Ranjith at his house and ask him why he didn't inform the press that Christopher was the serial killer.

Newton (film)
 Newton Kumar, a rookie government clerk on reserve is sent on election duty to a Nicolette-Maoist insurgency [[Naxal]]-controlled town in the conflict-ridden jungles of  [[India]], when one of the main duty officers is found to be facing heart problems. Faced with the apathy of war-torn security forces and the looming fear of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla attacks]] by communist rebels, he tries his best to conduct free and fair voting despite the odds stacked against him. He is disappointed when the voters do not turn up for the election. Later when a foreign reporter turns up at the polling station the security forces force the villagers from the constituency to turn up to cast their votes. When one of them enters the polling booth, he becomes bewildered with the voting machine and its operation.   After talking to the lot, soon Newton realizes that they have no idea what the election is about. Some thought they would earn money from this, while others asked hopelessly about getting paid sufficiently for their work. He desperately tries to educate them but to no avail. Taking the lead, the frustrated security head pushes him aside and shames the villagers by telling them that these officers have risked their lives for their vote, and they should not turn them away, and that the voting machine is a toy; there are symbols of elephants, cycles, etc. and they could press any symbol they like (leaving them uneducated about the fact that those symbols represent respective political parties). So while they vote their favourite symbol, instead of politicians they have never heard about, the foreign reporter gets a good news report about [[India's democracy]].   Newton wants to sit at the polling booth for the stipulated time but is forced to flee due to a Naxal ambush which he realises later was staged by the forces. On gaining such knowledge, he tried to outrun his escort team back to the polling booth, but gets caught on both sides, and is forcefully taken back to safety. On the way back Newton decides to collect votes of four villagers who suddenly turn up from deep inside the forest. The Chief of Security is reluctant to let them do so. It is here where the film gives the viewer the conundrum of the situation in war torn areas, through two men without any rivalry, bent on their duty, yet a stark difference, exposing the conundrum of truth. Taking his duty very seriously, Newton steals the Chief's gun and holds the officer at gunpoint till the villagers cast their votes. The chief comments out of frustration that it was not his wish to conduct such polling here in an area secured 6 months ago, having more landmines than men. He tells that he doesn't want to lose more brave boys like they already have anymore, even when the government cannot even supply them [[night vision goggles]] they have been asking for 2 years. Newton keeps him at gunpoint even after the voting for the remaining two minutes of his official duty (till 3pm). The security forces then beat him up out of frustration.

Nightworld (film)
 After he is forced to kill a teenager in self-defense, former [[LAPD]] police officer Brett Irlam retires to Bulgaria.  There, he meets Ana and marries her.  Her suicide sends him into a depression that worries his friend Alex, who suggests he take a security job in Sofia.  Brett agrees when recurring nightmares of Ana's death keep him from moving on.  The job turns out to be at a historic building well-known by the locals.  Its manager, Martin, reveals few details before hiring Brett.  The job has only one major responsibility: watching [[CCTV]] footage of cameras in a locked warehouse.  Martin explains that nobody has ever reported activity, but Brett must contact help immediately if he sees anything.  The job is initially very quiet.  Though he occasionally hears strange noises, Brett is more worried about his nightmares, which he sometimes has trouble distinguishing from reality.  Brett meets local cafe worker Zara, who is surprised the building needs security.  One day, Brett glimpses a shadow in the footage and calls the number given to him.  A blind man, Jacob, arrives at the building, explaining that he was once a watchman there, too.  Jacob has Brett describe the incident thoroughly, then promises to alert Martin himself.  Martin arrive the next day.  He is satisfied that the situation is under control and refuses Brett's suggestion that they investigate the warehouse.  Brett and Zara grow closer.  He invites her to see the building when she expresses interest, and they have sex in his living quarters.  The next day, Brett sees what he believes to be footprints on the CCTV.  He again calls Jacob, who expresses keen interest.  When Martin and his assistant arrive, they reluctantly agree to investigate the warehouse in person.  Brett is frustrated when they reveal nothing, though Jacob warns Brett never to enter the warehouse alone.  After experiencing disturbing nightmares, Brett calls Zara.  As they have sex, Brett hallucinates that Zara is his dead wife, disturbing him greatly.  Zara shows up at the building later, saying that Brett has blown her off for several days.  Brett denies this, but before she can explain, Jacob visits Brett and explains some of the building's story.  The building's original architect, and now its only resident, was chosen to protect one of the seven gateways to the Nightworld, a place where the dead reside.  Although this guardian extended his life through alchemy, he is now dying.  Once the guardian dies, Jacob believes the barriers put in place may be weakened enough for powerful entities to enter our world.  Jacob demands Brett accompany him to the warehouse and attempt to close the gateway before it is too late, but Brett disbelieves him.  Alex arrives at the building, worried that Brett has been unreachable for the past five days.  Jacob says the Nightworld has no concept of time, and this may be explanation.  Brett, who still does not believe in the Nightworld, attempts to call Martin.  When Jacob shows Brett a large number of footprints on the CCTV footage, Brett, Jacob, Alex, and Zara enter the warehouse together.  As the guardian dies, a crowd of revenants kill Alex.  Jacob attempts to lead the group back out, but Brett becomes separated.  He comes upon Ana, and, though confused, leads her to the warehouse's door, where he finds Zara and Jacob.  Jacob is killed before he can open the door, and Zara is injured while retrieving the key.  After escaping the warehouse, Ana demands they reopen the door.  Zara tells Brett that this is not his wife, and Ana attacks her.  To save Zara, Brett kills Ana.  As Brett and Zara flee the building, revenants who have escaped the warehouse attack them.  Once they leave the building, Zara dies from her wounds.  As Brett mourns her death, she rises from the dead and attempts to kill him.  Brett is suddenly rescued by Pritchard, the building's owner.  After learning Brett is the sole survivor, Pritchard assures Brett that everything will be taken care of.  As Brett leaves the building's premises, he sees the ghosts of Jacob, Zara, Ana, and others, stuck in the building.

One and a half years ago in [[Vizag]], Pallavi is a student who wishes to make a recording of a dance performance so that she can show it to her family post marriage. However, a lack of natural talent forbids her from doing so. Uma Maheswara Rao, a young statistics student, is an orphan whose godfather Murthy ([[Tanikella Bharani]]), happens to be the principal of his institution. Uma wishes to pursue a [[PhD]] in his subject and settle in life. Pallavi happens to spot him dancing at a friend's wedding and requests him to teach her. Uma agrees seeing the large fee she offers as he is in need of money. He helps her, not only with her dancing, but also with other issues, including driving away a bully who torments her. Pallavi wins a dancing competition and the two realize they are in love with each other.   Pallavi tactfully clears the penthouse her family owns so that Uma can stay in the same house as her. Uma starts giving tuition classes in the penthouse and earns the money he requires. When Pallavi's family starts looking for marriage alliances, she requests Uma to elope with her, and he reluctantly agrees. However, a chance encounter with Pallavi's father, Chandramouli ([[Murali Sharma]]), makes Uma realize that he is ineligible to marry her, and requests Pallavi to allow him to go to [[New Delhi]] and get a PhD, thereby securing a future for both of them. Pallavi allows him tearfully, and he leaves for Delhi. For the next few months, she continuously ignores Uma, who keeps trying to contact her. She is soon approached for marriage by Arun's family, and her family agrees. When Pallavi contacts Uma, she realizes that she is not ready to take the guilt if he blames her later on for the failure in his career, and unwillingly gets married to Arun. An year later, Pallavi is contacted by Prof. Murthy who informs her that Uma has gone into depression and is now an alcoholic. He is on the verge of being fired by his firm in Los Angeles and is ruining himself. Feeling responsible, Pallavi travels to meet Uma.  Back in the present, Pallavi tells Uma that she is happily married to Arun and does not wish to go back with Uma. Uma objects saying she still loves him and is leading an unhappy life. Back in San Francisco, Pallavi tells Arun about her encounter and tells him they should call Uma to their house for 10 days so he can see how happy they are. She contacts Uma, who tells her that if he fails to see love between her and Arun, she would have to go away with him. Pallavi, initially hesitant, agrees. Uma lands in San Francisco, and immediately strikes an awkward relationship with Arun. He repetitively irks the couple and mocks their relationship, which annoys Pallavi. However, Arun's colleagues take a liking to Uma, whose pessimistic nature offends a few other people. This is soon disrupted when Chandramouli and his son-in-law, Lovababu ([[Balireddy Pruthviraj|Prudhviraj]]), unexpectedly land in San Francisco. Uma is introduced as Arun's old classmate, and is made to promise Pallavi that he would not reveal his actual reason of being there. Chandramouli reveals to Uma that the daughter of his friend committed suicide after having been married off to a man she doesn't love instead of her lover. He had come to know on the wedding day that Pallavi had a lover from Kavita ([[Vidyullekha Raman]]), Pallavi's best friend. Doubting that Pallavi is unhappy with her marriage, he came to San Francisco to find her former lover so that he could get them married if she wanted. Uma, realising his advantage, indirectly begins to coax Chandramouli and Lovababu into finding the truth themselves. When Kavita is interrogated, she covers up with a fake story saying that the lover is married and Pallavi herself tells her father that she is happy. They all go for a trip to [[Santa Monica]] for Arun's business meeting. There Pallavi discovers that Arun is having an affair after seeing him hug another girl secretively in the parking lot. Chandramouli too finds out about Uma from a phone call with Arun's father and Kavita. Pallavi confronts Arun, who lies to her again, confirming to her his infidelity. She confides in Uma, who believes she now hates Arun and wishes to be with him instead. However, when Chandramouli tells Uma that he wishes to get Pallavi married to Uma a few days later, he tells Chandramouli about his encounter with Arun. Having been an introvert since childhood, Arun's first friend was Christie, who he met during his MBA. Her attitude towards him makes him feel he has found a best friend. She unexpectedly proposes to him one day, and he rejects her replying that he has never seen her in that way. He begins to avoid her and soon finds out she is now a drug addict, and has attempted suicide. His guilt persuaded him to allow Pallavi to call Uma, as he believed Uma too was heading in Christie's direction.  Uma realizes that even though Pallavi can still be his, it is only right that she stays with Arun. He forces Chandramouli and stages a play where he himself looks like a negative person to Pallavi, and coaxes her into realizing Arun's honesty. Arun prepares to leave the house, believing Pallavi would be happy, but she does not allow him to do so, and they clear up their misunderstanding with Arun telling Pallavi that he loves only her. As they embrace at their reunion, Uma is heartbroken and walks out of the house, crying and shattered. An year later, he arrives in Vizag and meets Pallavi and Arun, who now have a daughter, and reveals he has come to meet a girl he met online, hoping to settle and get married.

Defeated, he and Buddy decide to return to the park.  Meanwhile, Mayor Percival J.

Novitiate (film)
  This is a story of the effect of [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] (1962-65) on the Catholic Church, as seen in one convent, through the eyes of the tough old-fashioned Mother Superior, the kinder, younger, and more modern nuns, and the [[Postulants]] and [[Catholic novitiate|Novices]], particularly Sister Cathleen.   In 1954, seven-year-old Cathleen Harris lives in rural in Tennessee with her mother, Nora, a factory worker, who is non-religious but wants to show Cathleen a church and let her make her own decision. Cathleen's father, Chuck, comes home late, drunk, and argues with his wife. Chuck eventually leaves. Nora supports herself and picks up a series of men for one-night stands. At age 12, Cathleen seeks love of her own, and finds it in Catholicism when two nuns visit her home and offer her enrollment at a Catholic girls' school. The school offers her free tuition and a full scholarship to any college Cathleen chooses if her grades are excellent. At the school one day, a young nun befriends Cathleen and describes how she is married to Christ. At age 17 in the year 1964, after Cathleen comes home from school and runs into another one of her mother's pickups, Cathleen decides to leave home and give her life to God.   With twenty other girls, Cathleen joins the Sisters of the Beloved Rose. She will be a postulant for six months in their convent, after which she will become a novice for a year and a half, and then make her final vows to become a nun. The Abbess, Reverend Mother Marie Saint-Clair, is tough, cold, traditional and largely responsible for training and disciplining the postulants. She leads the postulants through the weekly "Chapter of Faults," in which they must publicly confess to all their faults and face the accusation of the other postulants, for which Mother Superior assigns extreme, humiliating penances, including "The Discipline," a knotted whip that they use to flagellate themselves.   Sister Mary Grace, a young, warm, kind, and progressive nun, is the Postulant Mistress, who tries to make life easier for them. Most of the day is heavily regimented, but sometimes the postulants fall into girlish activities and giggling. Cathleen tends to avoid interacting with the other girls and spends her free time alone and reading from the Bible.   Mother Superior keeps getting envelopes from Archbishop McCarthy about Vatican II, which she ignores. Sister Mary Grace sees the documents, and says that change would be good. Mother Superior cuts her off with, "The Church is perfect exactly the way it is." Later, they argue, and Sister Mary Grace challenges Mother Superior's authority. Sister Mary Grace goes off to pray, and decides to leave the convent.  After six months, Cathleen takes her Simple Vows and becomes a novice. As Reverend Mother grows increasingly harsh, 18-year-old Sister Cathleen undergoes a sexual awakening. Cathleen stirs one night after masturbating in her sleep. She stops eating and interacting with the other novices and nuns over her "impure thoughts". When her mother visits the convent to deliver news about her father Chuck's passing, she notices Cathleen's pale and emaciated appearance. Nora threatens the Reverend Mother over her daughter's treatment, but Reverend Mother bushes it off, saying that Nora no longer has a daughter but that Cathleen has now given her life to the Church. Cathleen eventually collapses during dinner one evening from starvation and dehydration, she is sent to the infirmary for several days where she confides in another young nun, Sister Emanuel. Later on, Cathleen sneaks out of the infirmary and into Sister Emanuel's room where Cathleen tells her that she longs for "comfort," leading to a kiss and their having sexual intercourse. After this, Cathleen leaves the infirmary and shows signs of recovery, is eating again and showing quiet happiness, but neither she or Sister Emanuel ever discuss their sexual encounter.  Meanwhile, Archbishop McCarthy pays a visit to the convent. He tells Mother Superior that "this order in particular" is having difficulty embracing the changes of Vatican II. She dismisses the "ridiculous reforms." He tells her that if she can't adapt to the changes, she will be replaced. As for "that old medieval stuff," the extreme penances, "That's gotta stop." Mother Superior is devastated. She fears God has abandoned her. At a subsequent Chapter of Faults, a novice confesses that she questions God's existence. Mother Superior tells her she's tired of hearing of her spiritual wretchedness and assigns her no penance at all. When Cathleen goes next and confesses feeling the need to be emotionally comforted and about her one-time sexual encounter with another nun, she refuses to give away the nun's name and only asks for penance. Mother Superior forces Cathleen to crawl on her hands and knees and to beg for penance from each of the other novices, which finally brings Cathleen to tears. Mother Superior grants penance to Cathleen anyway. Afterwards, Sister Emanuel leaves the convent without saying goodbye to Cathleen.  Eventually, Mother Superior calls the congregation and reads aloud the Archbishop's memo about Vatican II. Priests will say the Mass in English, and face the congregation. Catholics must embrace religious tolerance. Nuns are no longer required to wear habits and can wear whatever they wish as their status is now reduced and equal to any lay Catholic. Of the original twenty postulants, only five are left to profess their final vows to become solemnly professed nuns, among them is Cathleen. At their mass of Solemn Profession, the priest asks each of the novices, "What do you seek?" One answers that she wants to take her vows and marry Jesus Christ. The priest then asks Cathleen the same question. She answers, "I seek something more."<ref name="thrreview"/><ref></ref><ref name="varietyreview"/>

In 2017, a young girl named Mija lives in the countryside of [[South Korea]] with her grandfather and their super pig, Okja. They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox, who declares Okja the best super pig and announces they will take her to [[New York City]]. Mija's grandfather presents her with a gold pig and explains to her that he saved up money to buy the solid gold item to replace Okja when she was taken away. Devastated, Mija runs away to [[Seoul]] to find Okja, where she sees her as she is being loaded onto a truck. Mija chases down the truck but it is intercepted by another truck, run by the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF). In the resulting chaos Mija and Okja run away but are eventually saved by the ALF, led by Jay. Recognizing that Mija is Okja's owner, Jay uses another ALF member, K, as a translator to tell Mija that their plan is to put a recording device in Okja's ear and let her be re-captured by the Mirando corporation to show how brutally they treat their animals. Mija tells them to return her to the mountains but K deliberately lies, leading the group to believe Mija is in agreement with their plan. They abandon her, and Okja is recaptured.  Meanwhile, footage of Okja and Mija running through the streets of Seoul has gone viral. To minimise the damage, Lucy pays for Mija to come to New York in an [[Asiana Airlines]] [[Boeing 777]] to be reunited onstage with her pig. Okja is taken to a laboratory in [[Paramus, New Jersey]] where she is forcibly bred with another super pig and bits of meat are extracted from her flesh for a taste test. Members of the ALF overhear the recording through the device they placed in Okja's ear. After the ALF see the forced breeding, K reveals he lied to the rest of the group about Mija's support of the plan in order to continue the mission. In response, Jay attacks K, and expels him from the ALF.  In New York City, Mija is forced to agree to the wishes of the Mirando corporation. Jay slips into her room and tells her that they still plan to rescue Okja while on stage. A parade is put on by the Mirando Corporation, who give out free meat in the street. Mija is reunited with Okja, who, blinded and battered, does not recognize her and attacks. In the resulting chaos, Jay tries to hurt Okja, but Mija prevents him from doing so, calming Okja down so that she recognizes Mija. A video of the mistreatment of Okja is screened by the ALF to the public, who quickly turn on the Mirando Corporation. Mija and the ALF attempt to escape with Okja but fail. Okja is recaptured and the ALF members are arrested. Nancy, having returned to control the company, closes the lab, scraps all of Lucy's promotional marketing, and starts full-time operations at their slaughterhouse. Jay and Mija are rescued by K, who had 'translations are sacred' tattooed on his arm.  Jay and K take Mija to find Okja in a mass slaughterhouse. The group search for Okja but are unable to find her until Mija sees her going up the ramp to the slaughterhouse. In order to save Okja, she runs through the killing plant and sees many dead super pigs. Mija sees Okja as she is about to be slaughtered and shows the Mirando employee a photograph of herself with a baby Okja. Nancy arrives and tells Mija that Okja must be slaughtered. Mija offers the golden pig to Nancy in exchange for Okja's life. Nancy agrees to the deal whilst subsequently having Jay and K arrested. As Mija and Okja are leaving, they see many more pigs being led to slaughter. A pair of superpigs manages to push their newborn through the fence, and Okja hides it within her mouth to take it away.  Back in the countryside, Mija resumes her life with her grandfather, Okja, and the new piglet.

Together they form a security group, designed to protect protesters from law enforcement or counter-protesters at rallies and marches.  The film follows George's increasing involvement in AIM, with a particular focus on the illegal alcohol sales in Whiteclay, NE. While it is illegal to sell or possess alcohol on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Whiteclay borders the reservation and until September 2017<ref></ref> sold the equivalent of over 4,000,000 cans of beer a year, despite its tiny population of just 12 residents.<ref></ref> Much of George's coming of age is shown in the film through his growing role of leadership at AIM protests designed to shut down the alcohol sales at Whiteclay. Towards the end of the film, George becomes disillusioned with AIM and the activist lifestyle, due to repeated failures and the lack of impact their actions seem to have. His father convinces him to remain active, citing his family legacy of resistance to the US Government and describing it as their duty. The film ends at the [[DAPL]] protests, where George has recommitted to AIM and his family legacy.  Legacy and the family history are central to the way that Guy raises George and are recurring themes throughout the film. They are demonstrated through a series of animations which depict key moments in Dull Knife family history and are based on paintings created by Guy. Family history and contemporary context are told through these animations, which alternate with George's ongoing story.

Wanting to provide for his daughter, he interviews for a job with Crew 7 and is hired despite the reservations of some of the crew. Brendan begins buying groceries and leaving them on the doorstep of Natalie's house.  During training, a wildfire breaks out and Crew 7's evaluation is scheduled. Despite the presence of rookies on the team and a clash of opinion between Eric and the crew's evaluator, Crew 7 passes and becomes the Granite Mountain Hot Shots. Natalie begins to open up to Brendan and agrees to let him spend time with their daughter.  The crew successfully fights several fires, including saving a historic juniper tree, but Brendan is bitten by a rattlesnake while walking the fire line. He is taken to the hospital for treatment but declines the recommended painkillers to avoid a potential relapse. Brendan's roommate and fellow hot shot Chris MacKenzie visits him in the hospital. He is immediately attracted to Brendan's nurse and they begin a relationship. Natalie, McKayla, and Brendan's mother also visit, the latter of whom suggests that Brendan reconsider his career for his daughter's sake. While out with the crew celebrating their recent success, Brendan approaches Eric about transferring to a structure fire crew, angering Eric. He reminds Brendan that his criminal past makes a transfer unlikely if not outright impossible, and he will likely relapse without the sense of purpose being a hot shot provides.  On the way home, Eric and Amanda argue about Eric's attitude about Brendan's sense of priorities and his own reluctance to start a family. Eric gets out of the car and walks to Duane's house where Eric tells Duane about an experience he had fighting a fire in Montana. Eric describes his memory of a bear that ran past him on fire, calling it "the most beautiful and terrible thing I've ever seen." Afterwards, he returns home and tells Amanda he's ready to start a family. Eric's fears about Brendan are also shown to come from the fact that he shares a similar past and the job saved him from it as well.  The next morning, Eric receives a call about a fire in Yarnell. He calls in the crew and, on the way to the fire, tells his second-in-command Jesse Steed that he will be stepping down as superintendent at the end of the fire season and that Jesse can have the job if he wants it. The crew deploys to protect Yarnell from the fire, and Eric tells Brendan that he will help him secure a transfer so he can spend more time with his family. The crew begins a controlled burn to contain the fire, but an air tanker mistakes the burn for a secondary fire and extinguishes it. The crew is forced to relocate and make a new fire line, and Brendan is sent to higher ground to serve as a weather lookout. The wind shifts and picks up speed, sending the fire toward Brendan and the crew. Brendan evacuates with the help of another hot shot crew member who gives him a ride to the staging area, and Brendan drives one of their vehicles back to the mobile fire headquarters. The rest of the crew begin to make their way to their designated safe zone.  The fire picks up speed and overtakes the safe zone before the crew can reach it. As Brendan listens on the radio, the hot shots prepare a deployment site and call in an air tanker to cover their position. The tanker overflies the crew, and they deploy their fire shelters. The fire then overtakes the hot shots. Multiple radio calls go out to the Granite Mountain crew. There is no response.  Brendan hears the radio call when the deployment site is discovered and it is confirmed that there are no survivors. The families of the fallen hot shots gather at a local school gymnasium, and word gets out amongst the families that one crew member survived, but they are not told who. Brendan demands to go to the gymnasium and enters to see the families in despair once they realize that Brendan is the lone survivor and their loved ones are dead. Brendan, suffering from survivor's guilt, collapses outside. Amanda follows him and tells him that she is glad he's alive.  Later, Brendan takes his daughter to the juniper tree that was saved by the crew earlier and remembers his fellow hot shots. During the credits, a tribute is made to the actual Granite Mountain Hot Shots.

 High school student and aspiring artist Yuki Hase falls in love at first sight with Kaori Fujimiya after the latter narrowly manages to pass down a borrowed French dictionary Yuki left behind inside a train. To his joy, Yuki learns that he and Kaori share class for their second year. However, Kaori seems to have forgotten their meeting. When he introduces himself again, she rejects his offer of friendship. Yuki later finds out that she has similarly rejected other offers since her transfer 3 months ago and is thus regarded as a pariah within the school.   Nevertheless, Yuki strives for Kaori's friendship, gaining the attention of his teacher, Mr. Inoue. Inoue tells him that due to an accident, Kaori suffers from both [[Retrograde amnesia|retrograde]] and [[Anterograde amnesia|anterograde amnesia]]; any memory other than that of her parents is suppressed after a week. Undaunted, Yuki has made up his mind to become Kaori's friend in anyway. To remind her of him and other things, he gives her a shared journal, where the two can share their memories every week. By this method, the two slowly grow closer and Kaori becomes more and more open.  In summer, Yuki invites Kaori to attend a fireworks festival alongside his friends Shogo Kiryu and Saki Yamagishi. There, Kaori runs into her middle school friends, Hajime Kujo and Mayu Kondo, the former of whom has just transferred from [[Tokyo]] to the same school as Yuki and Kaori. Unable to remember them, Kaori attempts to excuse herself, but experiences flashbacks when Kujo calls her a "traitor" and passes out. When she wakes up, she appears to remember him in personal terms.  That autumn, the school holds a fair. Mayu visits the school again to meet Kaori, in the process informing Saki, Kujo, and Shogo of the latter's condition. She reveals that she had indirectly caused Kaori's accident and amnesia. During middle school, when Kujo had to transfer to Tokyo, he confessed his love for Kaori and asked to meet her one last time before he moved away. Words of the confession reached out to the school, ostracizing Kaori due to Kujo's popularity among the female students. They, including Mayu, sabotaged the meeting by throwing insults at Kaori, who fled in shame and was hit by a car. Following this revelation, Kaori fully remembers Kujo. Realizing that he could never compete with someone she remembers permanently, Yuki decides to stop befriending Kaori and tearfully burns the shared journal. Despite this, he politely rejects Saki's love confession several months later, declaring that he only have eyes for Kaori.   The next two spring seasons, Yuki and Kaori graduate. Kaori is called to the library to return a book, which turns out to be the French dictionary Yuki had borrowed a year ago using her member card. She learns that Yuki has illustrated the content of their shared journal into [[flip book]] drawings inside the dictionary. Finally remembering him, she rushes to meet him and asks to be her friend, an offer he accepts.

One day, he meets his new neighbour, W.F. ([[Jeff Bridges]]), with whom he suddenly feels a connection. Thomas begins to spend time with W.F. and tells him about his life.   When Thomas hangs out in a bar with Mimi one day, they see his father, Ethan ([[Pierce Brosnan]]) together with another woman ([[Kate Beckinsale]]). Fearing that the affair would take a toll on his already mentally unstable mother, Judith ([[Cynthia Nixon]]), Thomas starts to follow and finally confronts the woman. He is surprised when the other woman, Johanna, actually knows who Thomas is. She tells him that she is a freelance editor working with his father and knows Thomas from his picture in Ethan's office. After some time following and pleading with her to leave his father, Johanna mentions that Thomas is still a child who doesn't know anything, including the fact that he actually wants to sleep with her. Telling this to W.F., W.F. asks if he really wants to sleep with her and Thomas reluctantly says that he does.  When attending a friend's party, Thomas bumps into Johanna with another man. Having an argument after Thomas makes a crude remark about her, Thomas surprisingly kisses her which ends up with them making out passionately. An affair starts and Thomas begins to fall for Johanna. He tells her that since he was a child, he has aspired to be a writer but Thomas's dream was crushed when his father told him that his essays were only serviceable.   One day, when Thomas looks for W.F. in his apartment, he finds a manuscript titled ''The Only Living Boy in New York'' and that W.F. is actually a successful (although somewhat reclusive) writer. Thomas shows him his essays, and W.F. tells him that he does have a talent for writing. Thomas invites W.F. to a party at his father's publishing company to which the writer reluctantly agrees. Thomas goes together with Mimi who begins to show feelings towards him. She asks him if he is having an affair with Johanna, which he denies.

Johanna tearfully tells Thomas that she really is in love with Ethan. She tells him that Thomas really doesn't know anything, and shows a picture of Thomas in a tennis match, with W.F. captured in the background.  Thomas confronts W.F. and he tells him that he was a close friend of his parents. As Ethan is infertile, he and Judith asked W.F. for a favor: to conceive a child with Judith. Spending a drunken night together, W.F. realized that he is in love with Judith, and so he left her. He has always watched Thomas from afar, hoping to connect with his son. Upon returning home, Thomas finds that Ethan has already ended his relationship with Judith. He tells his mother that he's been in contact with W.F., and that he knows Judith has been in love with W.F. for 25 years.  One year later, Thomas is working in a bookstore, while trying to get his writing published. Ethan comes to the bookstore and the two catch up. Ethan offers to help Thomas using his connections, which Thomas declines. Thomas asks if Ethan is still in contact with Johanna, and he says no but admits he's lying.

OtherLife
 Ren Amari is the lead researcher at a technology company she co-founded with entrepreneur Sam. Using nanotechnology, Ren invents a biological form of virtual reality called OtherLife that can create realistic memories. A week before the product launch, she is testing its code on herself under the supervision of engineer Byron Finbar. Unknown to the others, she is also privately testing the product on her comatose brother, Jared. Ren hopes that the inserted memories will help him recover, though her father, a professor whose work she based OtherLife on, wants to stop Jared's life support. Amid these issues, her romantic relationship with coworker Danny begins to suffer.  Sam pitches OtherLife to investors, telling them they can market the product as a near-instantaneous experience that can last for days. Ren is horrified when Sam suggests they license it for use by the government as an alternative to prisons; inmates would be trapped for years inside their own head while only a minute would pass in real time, relieving prison overcrowding. While alone with Danny, Ren explains her research to him and shares a skiing simulation. Excited, Danny tries another simulation unsupervised, not knowing it is the experimental one Ren has designed for Jared. Danny has a seizure and dies.  The government is willing to avoid a trial for unlicensed human tests and Danny's death if Ren agrees to one year of solitary confinement in OtherLife. With no alternative, Ren agrees. She is then stuck within a simulation that includes simply a single room and basic necessities of life, including bottled water and canned tuna. After a full year, Ren breaks down when the confinement counter resets to 001 without her release. However, in her rage, she is able to dislodge a wall section and escape. As she emerges, she realizes she had been trapped in a real-world cell. She escapes and makes contact with a sympathetic coworker, who reveals that Danny survived.  Ren reunites with Danny and finds that OtherLife has become a major success and is being used for a wide range of applications, including long-term confinement stretching for centuries. Determined to stop Sam and salvage her work to help Jared, Ren develops a new, more advanced prototype of OtherLife. After she tests it on Jared, he responds positively but makes it obvious he desires death; Ren obliges him by unplugging the life support. Afterward, she suddenly awakens. Her "escape" was part of an OtherLife glitch in her year-long imprisonment. All her post-imprisonment experiences are part of an interactive OtherLife experience. Ren keeps this quiet, knowing Sam would use this technology against her wishes.  While going over the data from her experience with Sam and Byron, Sam excitedly points out part of a brain scan that correlates with her interactive experience. When Ren refuses to cooperate, Sam abruptly forces her into a second year-long imprisonment, hoping that she will once again trigger the glitch and allow them to learn how to develop interactive experiences. Byron reluctantly goes along with it when Sam says it is the only way to force Ren's assistance. Ren again escapes from the OtherLife experience, more quickly this time, by remaining calm, and allowing the simulation to go faster, and loop infinitely. She regains consciousness and traps Sam in his own year-long OtherLife imprisonment program. The program experiences a bug, putting Sam's life at risk, but Ren refuses to allow Sam to escape until he has served a full 365 days, plus waiting for the clock to tick over a few more days, so he understands the agony she herself felt when the countdown reset to zero. Once he recovers, she leaves the company to meet with her father. Recognising Jared's situation, Ren agrees with her father's decision to terminate Jared's life support.

Although Mr. Gruber and the Browns do not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence that the thief even existed, Paddington is wrongfully convicted and jailed. The thief soon returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor who lives opposite the Browns.  Whilst in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, including the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who hires Paddington, impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief. Buchanan begins using the pop-up book to locate a series of clues within London's famous landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure, wearing a different disguise for each visit.

To catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave shortly.

As the group is caught in a rainstorm, the golden reliquary is struck by lightning but shows no damage, further reinforcing the notion of its mystical power.  Ireland, at the time reeling under successive Norman invasions, is a dangerous place; in fear of Celtic warriors, Geraldus leads several monks to a French encampment led by Baron de Merville, who believes that assisting the pilgrims will enable his forgiveness for atrocities committed as a crusader in service of the Church. The monks are disgusted by the violent nature of the soldiers, especially the Baron's son Raymond de Merville, despite Geraldus' claim of their protection being a necessary evil. It is revealed that the reliquary contains not the remains of the apostle [[Saint Matthias]] but rather the stone used to martyr him, and that the Pope believes its tremendous power will benefit an upcoming [[crusade]].  A larger caravan of armed men, led by Raymond, sets out escorting the monks to the boat that awaits them in [[Wexford]]. Raymond, speaking French, tells the mute laborer that some of his men recognize the Mute as a former crusader but not from where; only Brother Ciarán speaks French, and the rest of the monks are left in the dark. En route, the caravan finds that a necessary bridge has been burned and its guards slaughtered, and Raymond takes most of the soldiers with him to give chase, leaving the monks with a token guard. The monks continue but are quickly ambushed by a group of Celtic warriors, who quickly slaughter the soldiers and several monks. The Mute dives to protect the young Brother Diarmuid but is stunned by a rock from a sling. As the Celts make off with the cart bearing the reliquary, the Mute regains his composure, grabs a sword from a fallen soldier, and quickly kills several of the Celts followed by their chieftan; the rest scatter in fear. The two surviving monks, Diarmuid and the timid Cathal, are astonished until Geraldus claims the Mute's fierce actions as holy wrath on the Celts for desecrating the reliquary. They choose to follow after the stolen reliquary, as it is too dangerous to wait for rescue by Raymond's troops.  The Mute tracks the stolen cart, finding the reliquary gone; he then spots a Celtic scout, and quietly kills him. They have found the Celtic camp, and there are too many men to fight. To their dismay their leader Brother Ciarán is tied hostage to a tree. Diarmuid insists they rescue Ciarán, but Geraldus insists that their holy duty is to the relic, and not to their comrade; further, that Ciarán would surely also say the same. Diarmuid volunteers to after nightfall sneak into the camp and steal the relic, abandoning the ornate golden reliquary to the Celts. As the Mute and Diarmuid prepare to sneak into the camp, riders appear; it is Raymond and his lieutenants. They are there for the relic, as they hired the Celts to murder the pilgrims such that the king of France could claim the relic instead of the Pope. During their discussion Diarmuid sneaks to Ciarán's side and attempts to cut his bonds; Brother Ciarán insists the boy let him go. Ciarán, who was driving the cart bearing the reliquary during the ambush, tells Diarmuid that he threw the relic from the cart before he and the cart were taken, and that Diarmuid must find the relic and leave him to his fate.  Devastated, Diarmuid leaves his mentor behind. The monks watch in horror as Raymond discovers the reliquary is empty, and thus Brother Ciarán's ruse. Raymond offers Brother Ciarán a quick death if he tells where the relic has gone. Ciarán smiles and prays, calling out Jesus' name as Raymond brutally kills him with a curved, multi-pronged barb.  The monks escape and find the relic near where Brother Ciarán threw it. Geraldus fanatically insists that they continue their pilgrimage despite their desperate situation. As dawn breaks and horns sound in the distance, the group sees a fog covering a river in the distance. Geraldus interprets this as a divine sign, and they race to the river before Raymond and his men can find them. They ford the river, losing their pursuers in the fog, until Geraldus shouts back insults at Raymond in French. Raymond replies in English, telling the group that Geraldus is such a fanatic that he sent his own father to be burned at the stake for heresay. Lost in the fog, Diarmuid pulls the relic out of his sack and prays to it. The others join him, and they hear chiming off in the distance and head that direction.  The chime is the bell of a river ferry. Geraldus eagerly suggests that the Mute murder the ferrymen to enable their escape, but Brother Cathal barters with pearls fallen off of the reliquary box that he had collected earlier. The boat takes them almost to the coast, but as the tide is out the estuary is too shallow to pass. Behind them, Raymond and his men cross into a clearing on the shore. The ferrymen, realizing their own danger, throw their cargo out of the boat, and all push the boat through the shallows. Geraldus, speaking French, maniacally convinces the Mute to turn around and buy the pilgrims time to escape, as God will forgive the former Crusader's sins for the deed, no matter how great. Diarmuid is crushed and tries to stop the Mute, but Geraldus holds him back as the boat begins to float, meaning freedom is at hand.  The Mute takes on Raymond and his men alone, killing several. Raymond's archer fires at the fleeing boat, narrowly missing with all of his remaining arrows. Raymond engages the unarmored Mute, seemingly defeating him. Raymond stabs the Mute with his barbed torture prong, asking where he comes from. The Mute responds with his only word of the film: "Hell". The Mute grabs Raymond and bites him in the throat, severing his artery, leaving him twitching on the ground. The Mute stands up, grabs his sword, and advances on the remaining 3 soldiers. On the boat, Cathal reveals that he was struck with the last arrow in the chest, and collapses. Hearing the clang of swords ashore, Geraldus tells Diarmuid that the holy relic will inspire a thousand men like the Mute to holy violence. Disgusted and ashamed of the Church, Diarmuid moves to throw the relic overboard. Geraldus struggles with him and goes overboard with the relic, sinking to the bottom. The men ashore are dead, Geraldus presumably also; the only other monk, Cathal, lies dying in the boat. The ferry pilot asks Diarmud, "Where to now?"; the young Monk has no answer.  
Person to Person (film)
 During a day in New York City, a reporter trains a new employee while covering a story about a possible murder where a watch repairman may have important information; a record collector finds a rare piece of vinyl; two brothers track down their sister's ex-boyfriend who posted nude pictures of her online, and a questioning teenage girl explores her feelings when she kisses a boy.  
Phillauri (film)
 A young man Kanan ([[Suraj Sharma]]) returns to India from Canada to marry his long-term girlfriend Anu ([[Mehreen Pirzada]]), but comes to know that as he is a [[manglik]] (born under an unlucky star) he has to get married to a tree before getting married to her. He reluctantly marries the tree, which is duly chopped down after the completion of the ceremony. As a result, from that day onwards he is haunted by the spirit of a woman named Shashi ([[Anushka Sharma]]), who lived in that particular tree and hence claims to now be 'married' to him.  The story of Phillauri and Shashi is slowly revealed via the latter's flashbacks. Back in an unspecified time period, Shashi is a bright young woman who never fails to read the works of a poet named ''Phillauri'' that is regularly published in a local [[daily newspaper|weekly]]. Everyone in the village of Phillaur thinks that the poems are written by the singer Roop Lal 'Phillauri' ([[Diljit Dosanjh]]), who is the heart-throb of the village. However Roop Lal notices that Shashi, unlike all the other village girls, never comes to hear him sing. When he confronts her one-day and tells her that he is the Phillauri who writes the poetry by narrating one of his famous poems to her, he is shocked when Shashi slaps and insults him. She asks him to use his talent – of being able to connect with the common man through his songs – for something important (especially when the [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] is on) and not for frivolous matters. From that day onwards Roop Lal is a changed man, dedicating his life to knowing and understanding the poetry of Phillauri (which it is clear now that he is not the author of), and spreading its message via his beautiful singing to others.  On one particular night while Roop Lal is alone at home singing one of Phillauri's poems, Shashi comes to him and reveals that she is the one who writes poetry under the [[pseudonym]] of 'Phillauri' (which she can't do openly, being a woman). Subsequently, love blossoms between the two (the poet and the singer who translates her poetry to song and spreads its message far and wide), but Shashi's elder brother (a reputed doctor of the village who brought her up) eventually comes to know about the affair and intervenes between the lovers. Roop Lal confronts Shashi's brother and admits to having been an alcohol-addicted good-for-nothing who still is not worthy of her, but tells him that he (Roop Lal) is going to [[Amritsar]] to record all the songs written by Shashi and will eventually return and ask for her hand in marriage.  The very fact that Shashi writes poetry is a revelation to her brother, and as time passes he too reads the poems and starts appreciating her obvious talent. Meanwhile, Roop Lal records the songs in Amritsar (the [[gramophone record]] is credited to Roop Lal 'Phillauri', thus being an amalgam of his name and her pseudonym) and is paid a handsome fee of three hundred rupees. He immediately sends the entire amount as a [[money order]] to Shashi's brother, along with a letter stating his intention to return and marry her on [[Baisakhi]]. Shashi's brother, by now convinced of Roop Lal's changed nature and good intentions as well as the deep love between the couple, starts the preparations for her marriage.  On the day of the wedding Shashi comes to know that she is pregnant, but does not disclose the news to anyone except her close friend Amrit ([[Nidhi Bisht]]). She expectantly waits for Roop Lal along with all her relatives and the entire village, but eventually the day ends with him nowhere to be seen on any of the buses from Amritsar. Her brother has to face the intense embarrassment and shame of sending everyone away, and this in turn hurts Shashi so much that she commits suicide (by hanging herself from a tree) due to an overwhelming sense of sadness, despair and betrayal.  In the midst of all these flashbacks by Shashi's spirit the parallel storyline in the present continues with Kanan (whose confused ramblings about seeing a ghost naturally no-one believes), ending up in trouble with Anu who feels that he is not really interested in marrying her (which is partially true since he is getting cold feet). In order to clear the misunderstanding Shashi  finally manages to reveal her presence to Anu as well (though Anu still cannot see her), and having heard her entire painful story Anu realises that Shashi's spirit is in fact still stuck on the mortal plane due to her unfulfilled love. At that point Anu's grandmother happens to play her favourite record, which as fate would have it is the one Roop Lal recorded. The record label mentions the recording date as 13 April 1919, which results in an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] for Kanan who immediately takes Anu (with Shashi in tow) to the site of the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]], which took place on that very day 98 years ago.  The movie ends with Shashi's spirit reuniting finally with her lover Roop Lal's (who was indeed killed in the massacre on the very Baisakhi day he recorded their songs and was to return to marry her). Before they both ascend to heaven Shashi tells Kanan and Anu (who can now see her) to love and cherish each other always, and that is what they promise each other as they embark on a new phase of their very own love story.<ref></ref>

Phoenix Forgotten
 Sophie Bishop and her boyfriend Dan visit Sophie's parents in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] on the 20th anniversary of her older brother Josh's disappearance. On March 13, 1997, the family witnesses the [[Phoenix Lights]] during Sophie's 6th birthday party, with Josh recording the incident. Several strange lights appear in a "V" formation over the city before disappearing, followed closely by fighter jets. Josh becomes convinced they have witnessed UFO's, though others remain skeptical. Hoping to find answers to her brother's fate, Sophie begins reviewing all of Josh's saved videotapes.   In the tapes, Josh begins investigating the Phoenix Lights with the help of his friends Ashley and Mark. Ashley and Josh interview two astronomers, who theorize that the lights were [[Flare|flares]] dropped by jets from the nearby [[Luke Air Force Base]]. However, Ashley and Josh remain unconvinced. Several days later, more mysterious lights appear over [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]]. Hoping to capture the lights on film and in better quality, Josh, Ashley, and Mark drive to Mesa. Upon arrival, the trio climb a hill on the outskirts of the town before noticing a spotlight in the distance facing sky-ward. Curious, the trio hike toward the spotlight where they find a gathering of Sheriff's Deputies and mysterious men. Josh notices the cars belonging to the men have no license plates. The group is then spotted by the men, forcing them to flee. The next day, Josh plots the apparent course of the lights, determining they will soon appear over an isolated area of the desert. In the present day, Sophie continues to interview multiple parties regarding the trio's disappearance. Only the group's abandoned car and a camera with single tape was discovered. Sophie views the recovered tape, showing the beginning of the group's journey to find the lights and discovering a charred animal corpse.  As the tape ends, Sophie refuses to believe Josh did not record the remainder of the trip. She concludes that Josh must have had a second camera. Sophie and Dan visit the local high school, where Ashley was a film editor and would have had access to such equipment. However the film teacher does not have any logs that may have been filled out, leaving Sophie at a dead end. Before departing Phoenix, she interviews her parents who reveal that the strain of Josh's disappearance caused them to divorce. The next night, Sophie receives a call from the teacher, who claims to have found something. She returns to Phoenix and receives a box that had been mailed to the school several years prior before being placed in storage. Sophie and Dan open the box and discover a heavily damaged camera. Dan manages to retrieve the tape from within the camera before watching it with Sophie.   The film then cuts to Sophie after having watched the tape, clearly distraught by its contents. She then contacts a Captain at Luke Air Force Base for an interview. Upon arrival however, the Captain appears confrontational with Sophie while Dan waits with the camera in the car. Sophie then returns and claims the Captain ordered her to "not let the footage get out". Dan asks Sophie what to do next, with Sophie giving him a look of determination. The film then cuts to the contents of the recovered tape, comprising the remainder of the film.   The last film begins moments after Josh, Ashley, and Mark find the charred corpse. The trio continues to hike through the desert and up a hill. Meanwhile, Ashley and Mark appear to grow closer, much to the disdain of Josh. After waiting at the top of a hill for several hours, the trio witness a single light in the distance. The light hovers for several minutes before accelerating along the horizon. The light grows progressively brighter and faster before discharging several, smaller lights. All the lights subsequently vanish. The trio celebrate their recording before hiking back to the vehicle. As night falls, the teens become lost and disoriented. Mark ventures up a hill alone to try and spot the car. After he leaves, Ashley and Josh hear loud sound in the distance that appears to be getting closer. A bright light then appears behind the hill before passing over them. Mark returns, visibly distressed but apparently unharmed, claiming to have found the car. As they walk back, Mark refuses to disclose what he saw at the top of the hill. The trio then find the car and attempt to return home.   As they drive, the light appears behind the car and pursues them. They attempt to flee before the light disables the car and vanishes. Unable to fix the vehicle, the trio hike along the road attempting to get back to town. As they walk, Mark begins showing severe symptoms of an unknown illness, including a nosebleed, fever, and disorientation. Mark then claims to hear voices, before running out into the desert while claiming to see his brother. As Ashley and Josh run after him, the light returns and Mark vanishes without a trace. Ashley begins to panic, while Josh comforts her. The two then notice a house light in the distance and resolve to follow it. Along the way, the two discover more charred animal corpses. In addition, Ashley also begins to show similar symptoms as Mark, including her [[Acute radiation syndrome|hair falling out]].   Continuing on, Ashley begins to hear an unknown sound. She then claims to see her father in the distance before running off with Josh following her. As they run, the light returns, causing lightning and high winds around them. Josh then captures the source of the light, revealed to be an alien craft appearing as several concentric, rotating rings. Josh then witnesses Ashley being lifted off the ground before being [[Alien abduction|abducted]] in a flash of light. The tape then cuts to Josh arriving at the deserted home, still pursued by the alien craft. He attempts to hide inside the house. Meanwhile, the craft causes various appliances to explode and gravitational distortion. Josh begins to scream as the craft removes the roof of the house, then also quickly lifts him off the ground in a flash before the camera cuts out. The tape resumes as the camera catches a brief glimpse of space, before falling back down to Earth. The camera lands, recording the sunset for several minutes before dying as the credits roll.  
Phullu
  Phullu  the titular character (portrayed by [[Sharib Hashmi]]) that's the typical good guy. Phullu's mother sells quilts because he doesn't have a job. He helps out his mom by procuring all the raw material for the quilts from the nearby town. In addition, he also picks up all the other stuff the women in his village may need from there.  When Phullu gets married, he realises that his wife keeps taking away pieces of red cloth from the material he gathers for the quilts. He wonders about it, but doesn't connect the dots as he knows nothing about menstruation. Nether his wife or mother explain the concept to him.  The women in his life also want Phullu to move to a big city and find work. But he's adamant about staying back in the village.  Finally, a turning point in Phullu's life comes when he finds out about menstruation through a female doctor at a chemist's shop on one of his city visits. He finally begins to understand why his wife needs the cloth, and why she suffers from itching every night.  He then takes rather drastic step of using all the money reserved for the last installment payment for his sister's jewellery to get a whole lot of sanitary pads. His furious mother kicks him out of the house, saying that he's wasted the money she earned with so much difficulty. When he tries to protest that the sanitary napkins are more important, his mother says her grandmother used wood to get rid of the itching and went on to live for 102 years, so pads are irrelevant.  Phullu goes to the city, where he gets in touch with the doctor who'd educated him about menstruation. He manages to create a sanitary napkin of his own. However, his mother and sister refuse to test it, as do the other women in the village for whom he used to run errands in the city. His wife is pregnant at this time, so she can't help him out either but is in how supportive Phullu's wife is, of his endeavour to manufacture low-cost sanitary napkins.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales
  Twelve-year-old [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Henry Turner|Henry Turner]] boards the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' and informs his father, [[Will Turner]], that the curse which binds Will to the ''Dutchman'' and only permits him to step on land once a decade can be broken by the [[Trident of Poseidon]]. Henry intends to recruit [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] to help find it, but Will believes this is impossible and orders Henry to leave. Will and the ''Dutchman'' then disappear into the sea, but Henry vows to find Jack and the Trident.  Nine years later, Henry is a sailor in the [[British Royal Navy]]. The ship sails into the supernatural [[Bermuda Triangle|Devil's Triangle]] and stumbles upon the wreck of the ''Silent Mary'', whose ghostly crew led by Spanish pirate-hunter [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Armando Salazar|Captain Salazar]] attack. Salazar spares Henry's life to deliver a message to Jack: Salazar is coming for him.  In [[Saint Martin]], a young [[astronomer]] and [[horologist]] named [[List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters#Carina Barbossa|Carina Smyth]] is sentenced to death for [[witchcraft]] but escapes and briefly crosses paths with Jack as he and his crew spectacularly blunder a bank robbery. Having suffered years of such bad luck, Jack's crew lose faith and abandon him. Depressed, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass frees Salazar and his crew from the Devil's Triangle. Carina learns Henry is looking for the Trident's location and offers to help him using her unknown father's diary. Carina and Jack are captured and face execution, but are saved by Henry and Jack's crew, setting sail on the ''Dying Gull''. Carina deciphers clues that the stars will lead to an island where the Trident is hidden.  Meanwhile, [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] hears from his pirate crew that the revived Captain Salazar has killed several pirates at sea, and learns that the Trident could lead him to a new "treasure". Barbossa sets off to find the Trident, until Salazar and his crew appear and destroy Barbossa's fleet. Barbossa manages to talk his way out of being killed by offering to help find Jack. Salazar agrees, wanting revenge on the pirate that caused his demise. Salazar pursues the ''Dying Gull'', forcing Jack, Henry, and Carina to flee to an island, discovering that Salazar's crew cannot go on land. After saving Jack from a forced marriage, Barbossa allies himself with Jack, returning his compass and restoring the miniaturized ''[[Black Pearl]]'', [[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|trapped in a bottle by Blackbeard]], to its original size. They all continue their journey to the Trident's island, with Barbossa taking command of the ''Pearl'' once more. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realize Carina is the latter's long-lost daughter. Barbossa tells Jack that he had left her at an orphanage with his diary so she could live a better life, and refuses to tell her the truth so she will continue to believe her father was an astronomer.  Approaching the Trident's island, the ''Pearl'' evades a British Navy warship, which is destroyed by the ''Silent Mary'' before the ''Pearl'' runs aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa, and Carina use the island's magic to part the ocean and open a path to the Trident's location on the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and demonically possesses his body in order to walk on the ocean floor and seize the Trident. Once he does so, Henry is given his body back and decides to destroy the Trident, breaking all curses upon the sea and restoring Salazar's crew to life. However, the divided sea begins to collapse in on itself. The ''Pearl'' lowers its [[anchor]] to lift them to safety, but Salazar pursues them, still hell-bent on killing Jack. Carina realizes that Barbossa is her father when she spots a tattoo on his arm identical to the diary's cover. Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar, allowing the others to escape alive.  Some time later, Henry and Carina reach Port Royal, where Will appears, free from the ''Dutchman''. His wife, [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]], appears moments later and the Turner family reunites. Henry and Carina begin a relationship as well. Jack watches from the ''Pearl'' in faux-disgust before sailing away into the horizon, having been accepted by his crew as their captain once again.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Will and Elizabeth sleep in their bed together, when their room is raided by an apparently resurrected [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]. Will awakens and finds that the room is empty. Assuming Jones' appearance to be a nightmare, Will goes back to sleep, oblivious to the presence of a trace of wet barnacles on the floor amid a puddle of seawater, revealing it was no dream and Davy Jones is really alive.  
Pitch Perfect 3
 Three years after the events of [[Pitch Perfect 2|the second film]], the Bellas have graduated college, but have jobs which they all hate. Desperate to see each other again to sing once more, Beca ([[Anna Kendrick]]), Fat Amy ([[Rebel Wilson]]), Chloe ([[Brittany Snow]]), Aubrey ([[Anna Camp]]), Lilly ([[Hana Mae Lee]]), Stacie ([[Alexis Knapp]]), Cynthia Rose ([[Ester Dean]]), Florencia ([[Chrissie Fit]]), Jessica ([[Kelley Jakle]]), and Ashley ([[Shelley Regner]]) are all thrilled to learn that Emily ([[Hailee Steinfeld]]), now a senior at Barden and leader of the Barden Bellas, has seemingly asked for the Bellas to reunite at an event in [[New York Aquarium]] to sing with each other once more. Upon arriving at the reunion they are told that the reunion was not for the Bellas to sing together, but to watch Emily sing with the new Bellas.    They later gather at a bar in disappointment and Emily apologizes as she thought it would be the only way for them to see each other again. They all express how much they miss each other. Suddenly, Aubrey convinces them to join a USO performance accessed by her Army officer father. If they win the competition, they get to open for [[DJ Khaled]]. The Bellas gladly accept, all except for Stacie who is eight months pregnant at the moment and is unable to go with them. The Bellas later arrive at a hangar where two soldiers, Chicago ([[Matt Lanter]]) and Zeke (Troy Ian Hall) introduce them to their competition, revealed to be three other groups who use instruments, unlike the Bellas. When the band Evermoist, led by their leader Calamity ([[Ruby Rose]]) begin to mock and belittle the Bellas, the competitors are challenged to a riff-off by the Bellas, who leave defeated when the other groups compete using their musical instruments.  The Bellas are taken to a fancy hotel in [[Spain]], where Chloe begins to catch an eye for Chicago. Fat Amy finds an old stuffed bunny sitting in her bed, which she recognizes as an old toy she used to hold when she was very little as her father Fergus ([[John Lithgow]]) sang her to sleep every night. Amy then realizes that her father is staying in the same hotel she is in and is shocked upon the discovery, seeing as how Fergus is a ruthless international crime lord. The Bellas sit in a bedroom and discuss how to improve, whilst the often ignored and undervalued Jessica and Ashley acknowledge how little the other Bellas seem to care about them. Later that night, the Bellas are invited to a party at DJ Khaled's suite at the hotel, where Fat Amy splits with the group when she is called to be at a poker tournament. The tournament was set up by Fergus, who promptly begs for Amy to be back in his life. A hesitant Amy finally agrees to do so after seeing how much he has changed. Beca develops a friendship with DJ Khaled's music producer Theo ([[Guy Burnet]]) and is taken to DJ Khaled's music editing room. Beca produces a mix which impresses Theo who is prompted to send the mix to DJ Khaled. Moments later, the party is thrown into chaos when Aubrey accidentally sets the suite on fire.  The Bellas are left in disgrace after the incident with no hopes of winning the competition. Stacie calls the girls to inform she has given birth to a baby girl and named her Bella. This motivates the Bellas to just perform their hearts out without trying to win. Back at the USO competition, the Bellas perform tremendously to adoring crowds through different performances, repairing their reputation and chances to win in the process. Fergus is accepted by Amy, who believes he came to one of their performances to see her. He accidentally reveals that he has not seen her perform at all, while confessing that he is only trying to acquire an offshore account Amy's mother set up which contains [[United States dollar|US$]]180 million. After Amy shuts out Fergus again, Chicago and Zeke escort her away from her father, who swears revenge on her. Meanwhile, only Beca is asked personally by DJ Khaled to open for him, disregarding the other Bellas. Beca politely declines the offer and leaves to her room. Later, the Bellas are taken away by a Frenchman in a van out onto a yacht in a nearby harbor. The yacht belongs to Fergus, who is using the Bellas as a means to manipulate Amy. Amy and Beca hear of the kidnapping and decide to rescue the Bellas. Beca distracts Fergus by having the Bellas perform "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" for him and two of his men, just as Amy sets the yacht to explode. The Bellas escape the yacht just before it blows. Fergus survives the explosion and is arrested for his crimes.  After the Bellas are rescued by the military, Fat Amy reveals DJ Khaled's proposition to Beca to the others. They encourage her to take the chance, and they all agree that now it's time to move on with their lives, with Amy using her bank account for multiple tributes to singers named Amy, Aubrey trying to be a birthing coach, Flo's juice cart becoming part of an international brand, Chloe getting accepted into vet school, Cynthia-Rose staying at the base to get into flight school, Emily going back to Barden to prepare for her upcoming [[abnormal psychology]] test while continuing her songwriting, and Lilly revealing that the reason she was quiet was because she was possessed by Satan and the yacht incident snapped her out of it, and that her real name is Esther. They know very well they'll be separated, but still be connected to each other as a family. Later at the USO's final performance, Beca opens for DJ Khaled and sings on stage, and afterwards brings up the Bellas onstage for the girls to sing their final performance with the other competitors watching the Bellas sing "[[Freedom! '90]]".  Gail ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) and John ([[John Michael Higgins]]) (who were the Bellas' public announcers in the previous installments) finish filming the Bellas as part of a documentary they have been making about the girls throughout the whole film, only to be appalled when John realizes they didn't record the Bellas' final performance, which was supposed to be the documentary's big ending. A series of mid credit scenes reveal the Bellas' separate story arcs closed out to their mostly happy endings, with Lilly hanging around with DJ Dragon Nutz, whom she flirted with earlier, Aubrey reconnecting with her father and Chloe and Chicago kissing, witnessed by a grimaced looking Beca, who is now the boss of Theo.  
Podhuvaga Emmanasu Thangam
 Two nearby villages in the southern suburbs of [[Theni]], share the same God as their "Kula Dheivam" and the Idol is to be shared between them during the festivals. Oothukattaan is a rich big shot in his village. He has a grudge against the other village, as he was insulted by them, a long time ago. Since then, he promised himself to keep the God's idol in his village forever. In order to destroy the neighboring village, he plans to evacuate the entire village population. So, he uses his power and wealth to stop all the government projects and welfare facilities from reaching the other village and make it a barren land, which forces people to evacuate slowly and move to other places in search of livelihood.

Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!
 Ash Ketchum wakes up late one morning after having broken his alarm clock in his sleep. He eventually makes it to Professor Oak's lab, but is told that the three starter Pokémon ([[Bulbasaur]], [[Squirtle]] and [[Charmander]]) have already been taken by Trainers who were on time. However, Oak reveals that he has one more Pokémon, an Electric-type named [[Pikachu]]. Despite its volatile and feisty personality, as well as its refusal to get inside a Poké Ball, Ash happily takes Pikachu for his journey.  Outside of Pallet Town, Ash encounters a Pidgey. When Pikachu refuses to fight it, Ash tosses a rock at it, but it hits a Spearow that mistakes Pikachu as the culprit. Soon, more Spearow show up forcing Ash and Pikachu to run. Injured and tired, Ash tells Pikachu to get inside its Ball, but it once again refuses. Instead, Pikachu defends Ash from the Spearow by summoning a large Thunderbolt that scares them away. As the storm ceases, a Ho-Oh flies above and drops a feather called a Rainbow Wing. Ash and Pikachu decide to go and find the Legendary Pokémon.  During their travels, Ash catches a Caterpie and the group eventually settle at a Pokémon Center. A Trainer bursts in claiming that they encountered an [[Entei]], a Legendary Fire-type Pokémon, causing Ash, as well as several other Trainers, to rush into the woods to look for it. Ash finds the Entei, but ends up fighting over it with a Trainer with a Piplup named Verity. They are also joined by an aspiring young Pokémon Professor named Sorrel who uses a [[Lucario]] in battle. When Entei escapes, Ash and Verity get into an argument and Sorrel leaves, telling them that they need to find shelter soon. As Ash and Verity fight, they accidentally disturb an Onix that starts chasing them. They manage to get it to leave just as it begins to rain. As they look to find shelter, they find a Charmander that has been left out. They quickly learn that it belongs to a ruthless trainer named Cross who, along with his Midnight form Lycanroc, left it out in the rain. He carelessly refuses to take it back, calling it weak, and Ash and Verity are forced to find it shelter.  They come across a cave where Sorrel and Lucario happen to be and help Charmander back to health. Entei and several other Pokémon arrive to sleep for the night and Ash reveals the Rainbow Wing. Sorrel reveals that Ho-Oh only gives the Wing to the "rainbow hero" who is destined to fight it, as a shadow Pokémon named Marshadow watches. The next morning, Ash convinces Charmander to join them. The group venture on with Caterpie evolving into a Metapod, and Charmander evolving into Charmeleon. Sorrel studies more about Ho-Oh and the Legendary Pokémon while Verity spots a Suicune. Eventually, while battling other Trainers in town, Cross returns and challenges Ash's Charmeleon with his Incineroar. Charmeleon is savagely defeated, causing Ash much grief.  Upset over his loss, Ash openly admits that he could have won with Pikachu and later states that he wished he had gotten Bulbasaur or Squirtle. Alone in the woods, Marshadow puts Ash in a sleep-like state as the Rainbow Wing turns dark. Ash has a dream where no Pokémon exist and he attends regular school with Verity and Sorrel. Realizing something is missing, he remembers Pikachu and wakes up to his friends, and the Wing regains its color. After escaping some angry Primeape, Metapod evolves into Butterfree. They rescue a pink Butterfree from a Fearow and realize that Ash's Butterfree needs to mate. Saddened but happy, Ash lets his Butterfree go. The group soon spot a Raikou and realize they are getting close when the Wing begins to glow in the direction of Mount Tensei.  The group make it there and meet Bonji, an old researcher who has been studying Ho-Oh. They make it to a crystal-like structure, but are interrupted by Cross who wants to fight Ho-Oh himself (he too saw Ho-oh, but it did not give him the Wing). Cross' Incineroar fights Ash's Charmeleon which quickly evolves into [[Charizard]] and defeats Incineroar. Cross, refusing to accept his loss, grabs the Wing and places it on the crystal, but it turns dark, causing Marshadow, an agent of Ho-oh's, to turn the local Pokémon (including Cross's midnight form Lycanroc) evil and attack Ash and his friends. The Trainers fight back, but are overwhelmed by the severity of the situation. Ash finally forces Pikachu to get in his Poké Ball as the Pokémon destroy Ash, turning him into pure energy as Marshadow notices the Wing has disintegrated.  Ash finds himself in a grey world, but is brought back, presumably through Ho-Oh's power when Ash protected Pikachu. Ash takes the newly formed Rainbow Wing and places it on the crystal structure. Ho-oh arrives and Ash challenges it with Pikachu to battle, but the outcome is never shown. The gang return to the Pokémon Center as Bonji states that Ho-oh will find a new trainer to leave its Wing to. Cross leaves on good terms with the group and eventually Verity and Sorrel leave to achieve their own dreams. Ash and Pikachu decide to continue their journey in the world of Pokémon.  During the credits, Ash's recurring friends from the main series (Brock, Misty, Tracey, May, Max, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Clemont, Bonnie and Serena) are shown. Verity is seen returning home, presumably to amend her relationship with her mother, and Sorrel is seen traveling and spotting an [[Articuno]] that he wanted to study. Ash and Pikachu are seen traveling together while being tailed by [[Team Rocket]] who appeared throughout the film, unnoticed by the protagonists for comic relief.

Wendy decides to deliver the script herself in person, and leaves the group home early the next morning, being followed by the group home's miniature dog Pete.

Scottie takes her son with her on the search, correctly deducing that Wendy left to personally deliver her script.   Wendy walks to an abandoned area where she is robbed by a couple who steals most of her money and her iPod. Wendy continues walking to a store where she is almost swindled out of the last of her money by a store worker. She is saved by an elderly woman who pities her, as the woman has an autistic grandson.

Wendy takes used paper and begins rewriting the script. Her family and the police scour for her, while her lost script pages are found by Scottie and her son. Wendy waits outside at a bus stop and attempts to buy a ticket to Los Angeles, but with her money stolen and an unsympathetic bus clerk unwilling to help, she smuggles herself onto the next bus to Los Angeles, concealing herself inside a baggage compartment.   Wendy arrives in Los Angeles and wanders around until two police officers notice who she is and corner her. One of the police officers builds trust with Wendy by speaking Klingon, and Wendy goes with them to the police station, where she is reunited with Audrey and Scottie. Both take her to Paramount Pictures. Despite being stonewalled by a rude mailroom worker, she tricks the workers and submits the script in the turn-in box before running away. Wendy, after being satisfied that she accomplished her mission, tells her sister she did it to prove to Audrey she was more capable than she thought, which Audrey agrees with. Wendy returns back to the group home where Wendy gets a letter from Paramount stating her script was not chosen, but she is satisfied with everything she has accomplished and goes to her sister's house to hold her niece for the first time while cuddling with her older sister.

On the flight home, McNamara expresses to Ellsberg and [[William B. Macomber Jr.|William Macomber]] ([[Cotter Smith]]) his view that the war in Vietnam is hopeless, yet, upon landing, tells the press he has every confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg overhears this and becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor working for the [[RAND Corporation]], Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in the [[Vietnam War|conflict in Vietnam]], dating back to the [[Presidency of Harry S. Truman|Truman administration]]. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to reporters at ''[[The New York Times]]''; the movie follows two weeks in 1971 at ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the publishing of the [[Pentagon Papers]].  Newspaper heiress [[Katharine Graham]] ([[Meryl Streep]]) tries to balance her social life with her responsibility as owner and publisher of ''The Washington Post'', following the deaths of her husband, [[Phil Graham]], and her father, [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]]. She is troubled over preparations for the newspaper's [[Initial public offering|stock-market launch]], a move she recognizes as important for strengthening the paper's economic stability. Graham lacks experience and is frequently overruled by more assertive men who advise or work for her, such as editor-in-chief [[Ben Bradlee]] ([[Tom Hanks]]), and board member Arthur Parsons ([[Bradley Whitford]]). Bradlee tries in vain to match ''The New York Times'''s ability to get [[Scoop (news)|scoops]]. Meanwhile, McNamara, Graham's longtime friend, confides in her that he is to be the subject of unflattering coverage by the ''Times''. The story turns out to be an exposé of the government's long-running deception of the American public. However, the series is halted by a [[court injunction]] against further publication by the ''Times''.  ''Post'' assistant editor [[Ben Bagdikian]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) tracks down Ellsberg as the source for the leak, who provides Bagdikian with copies of the same material given to the ''Times''. A hand-picked team of ''Post'' reporters sorts through the piles of papers, searching for the headline stories. The lawyers for the ''Post'' advise against publishing the material, lest the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] bring criminal charges against them. Graham talks to McNamara, Bradlee, and trusted ''Post'' chairman Fritz Beebe ([[Tracy Letts]]), agonizing over the decision of whether to publish. The situation is made even more complicated when the ''Post''s lawyers discover that Bagdikian's source is the same as the ''Times''s, possibly putting Graham in [[contempt of court]]. If charges are brought against the company, Graham could destroy the newspaper she sees as a family legacy. Alternately, if she were to win any legal challenge, the ''Post'' could instead establish itself as an important journalistic institution. She chooses to run the story.  The White House retaliates, and in short order the ''Post'' and ''Times'' appear together before the Supreme Court to plead their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] argument for the right to publish the material. Meanwhile, newspapers across the country pick up the story in solidarity with the ''Post'' and ''Times.'' [[New York Times Co. v. United States|The court rules 6–3 in the newspapers' favor]], vindicating Graham's decision. Nixon demands that the ''Post'' should be barred from the White House. One year later, security guard [[Frank Wills (security guard)|Frank Wills]] discovers a [[Watergate scandal|break-in in progress]] at the [[Watergate complex]].

 Giovanni Passamonte, a writer, is awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.

His son Oreste, a personal trainer who had arrived that morning to crash at his father's place after an argument with his wife Barbara, is recruited to replace Rinaldo. Lucrezia, Giovanni's daughter by another woman, invites herself to the trip to document it as part of her online blog.   The trip becomes a turning point for the four characters: Giovanni is nostalgic and lamenting a lack of inspiration. He is secretly planning a big surprise at the award ceremony (but ultimately changes his mind) and decides to interfere and improve the lives of his three companions. His eccentricity is the cause of the trip and often results in comedic moments throughout the movie. He is afraid of flying (hence the road trip), doesn't like using credit card (Rinaldo carries more than 50,000 EUR in cash for any emergency), has had many love stories, some of which have produced children (at least 6).    Oreste is a former Olympic athlete turned personal trainer and owner of an ailing gym, too proud to ask his father for financial help, but willing to drive for him in exchange for a 15,000 EUR loan. Lucrezia is a neurotic blogger with the passion for art and literature. Rinaldo is a loyal assistant who has sacrificed much for Giovanni, including his only love interest. The trip offers Giovanni occasions to shake things up in the life of their companions and make them reflect on their story and identity. The movie ends with Giovanni's acceptance speech where he declares the insignificance of prizes in general and the importance of the people "off-stage", who lead regular lives.

One day, William hires one of his students, Olive Byrne (daughter of [[Ethel Byrne]] and niece of [[Margaret Sanger]] – two famous suffragists and feminists of the 20th century) as a research assistant.  Olive aids in the Marstons' work in inventing the [[lie detector]] and conducting research on William's [[DISC assessment|DISC theory]] on human interactions, and the three soon grow close.  One after another tests by the lie detector reveal that they have fallen in love with one another, and all three of them begin to engage in a [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship.  As words about their unconventional relationship gets out, the Marstons are fired from the university.  Olive reveals that she is pregnant and moves in with the Marstons shortly after.  The trio decide to build a family together and create a fabrication to keep secret the nature of their relationship.  The family settle in a New York suburb, happily together.  By 1934, both Elizabeth and Olive bear children by William (Olive has two sons and Elizabeth has one son and a daughter), telling the neighbors that Olive is a widow and taken in by the Marstons.  William starts trying to make a living as an author.  Elizabeth takes a job as a secretary and becomes the [[Breadwinner model|main breadwinner]] of the family.  Olive stays at home and takes care of the kids, occasionally submitting her writing samples to publishers.  They raise their four children together, and Elizabeth names her daughter after Olive.  In 1940, William stumbles upon a lingerie shop in New York City run by [[Charles Guyette]], who introduces him to [[fetish art]] themed comics and photos.  The art captures William's imagination as a demonstration of his DISC theory.  Elizabeth initially disapproves of the art, but she relents during a presentation wherein Olive tries out an outfit that later would be the prototype for Wonder Woman's costume.  After finding limited work as a writer, Marston comes up with the idea of creating a female [[Amazons|Amazonian]] super-heroine for a comic book.  The comic would feature his ideas on DISC theory, drawing inspiration from the Marstons' work on the lie detector as well as Elizabeth and Olive in real life, and intend to support the feminist movement to further equal rights for women through a populist medium.  He pitches his ideas to [[Max Gaines]], then publisher at National Periodical Publications (today [[DC Comics]]), who ultimately accepts the comic and suggests simplifying the female superhero's name to "Wonder Woman."  "Wonder Woman" is an instant hit, leading to prosperity for the Marstons/Byrne family.  However, one day, their neighbor Mary wanders into their home by coincidence and walks into the three of them having sex.  This incident leads to their children getting bullied and asked to leave school by the staff.  Worried about their children being attacked and ostracized, and thinking they have no other choice, Elizabeth reluctantly demands Olive to leave the household with her children.  At the same time, the "Wonder Woman" comic gets growing accusations of featuring overtly sexual, sadomasochistic, and [[lesbian]] imagery that lead to the testimony of the present day.  Leaving the testimony, William collapses and is rushed to the hospital.  Learning that he is dying of [[cancer]], William asks Olive to see him and Elizabeth again, trying to help them reconcile.  William persuades Elizabeth to submit to Olive as she should not always dominate in their relationship.  The Marstons get on their knees and beg for Olive's forgiveness, and Elizabeth tearfully admits that she cannot live without Olive.  She eventually agrees to come back to them.  Epilogue text reveals that William died in 1947. Elizabeth and Olive continued to live together as a couple for another 38 years until Olive's death in 1985, and Elizabeth lived to be 100.  It also notes that sexual imagery disappeared from the "Wonder Woman" comic after William's death, along with Wonder Woman's super powers.  Wonder Woman was finally reclaimed by famous activist [[Gloria Steinem]] in 1972, when she put the character on the cover of the first issue of ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' as the quintessential symbol of female empowerment.  The credits conclude that "Wonder Woman remains the most famous female superhero of all time."

When she herself dies in the water, Kaabir slits his own throat, killing himself. Mohak forebodes that these events will repeat.

Rakka (film)
  === Chapter 1: ''World'' === In the near future, [[Earth]] will be attacked by technologically superior and highly aggressive [[Reptilians|reptilian aliens]] - the Klum. (pronounced "klume") Humanity is nearing extinction with millions dead or enslaved. The Klum transform the earth in favor of its living conditions, burning forests, destroying cities, and building megastructures that slowly terraform the Earth, pumping out methane, making it harder and harder to breathe, while flooding cities near the oceans.  The story begins in 2020, from the point of view of a resistance based out of Texas - US Army and others who have banded together. The survivors live mostly in the underground or scattered among ruins, and have just enough provisions, weapons and ammunition to continue fighting, using whatever they can against Klum technology - primarily some kind of nanite omnipresent in all their weaponry, as well as the aliens' trump card, a "hack" of sorts that forces anyone who looks into their eyes under telepathic control.  The resistance has made rudimentary shields, "brain-barriers", that block this "hack", but there are not materials for everyone to be protected, and the Klum know this, hoping to win a war of attrition against the survivors.  Whoever is taken prisoner are either used as living incubators in for the Klum's young that inevitably painfully kills the victims, dissected, or forcibly converted into "human loudspeakers," urging humans to surrender into so called "conservatories". Very few manage to escape.  After the Klum destroy a militia convoy with an airstrike, one of the surviving soldiers witnesses an angel-like being materialise from thin air. The narration describes ″them″ as mankind's saviours.  === Chapter 2: ''Amir & Nosh'' === Nosh is a tech-savvy pyromaniac and bomb-maker, eking out a living in a scrapyard far from the resistance. The resistance despises Nosh for his murderous glee and demands - giving the sick or suicidal over as bait during his many IED ambushes, but they must give in to his demands in exchange for continued IEDs and the brain-barriers he is able to make.  The resistance stumble across Amir, a mute who has managed to escape from the Klum, bearing extensive cybernetics across his head and shoulders. Amid opposition from her lieutenants, the resistance leader, Jasper, releases Amir from her custody into the care of a resistance fighter named Sarah.  Sarah, having lost her daughter to the Klum's experiments, takes a liking to Amir. She looks after him, giving him food and drink, while trying to persuade Amir to help the resistance fight the extraterrestrials using the precognitive powers he acquired as a result of the aliens' experiments.  === Chapter 3: ''Siege'' === Amir has recovered physically and mentally. He sees - thanks to his implants - a premonition, involving a wounded Klum on the run, pursued by militia forces. Sarah pleads with him to help the militia officers, asking him to help stop the genocide. The more she talks to him, the more his eyes change, seeing the premonition of the impending attack more clearly. Amir, still mute, foresees the militia successfully shooting down an alien aircraft, and the pilot is the alien on the run. Sarah asks Amir if they will be able to learn how to hunt the Klum and teach them how to fear. Unable to answer, he foresees the Klum telekinetically bashing one of the militia soldiers, disconnecting his brain barrier and causing him to be mind-controlled, turning on his comrades, who are forced to kill him. Sarah tells Amir that he now has the powers the aliens have and that he is to use them for humanity. Back in the vision, the militia surround the Klum; Jasper orders the militia to cut off its head. The film ends as Sarah urges Amir to use his abilities, as he is their last hope.

Ramanunni, who has been receiving threats from CDP activists, decides to take a [[Firearms license|gun license]] for self-protection and this becomes a controversy in the news.  Ramanunni's mother Ragini disapproves of his decision to join the NSP as they come from a communist-oriented family, his father Raghavan, a CDP activist, believed to have been martyred by NSP activists. The NSP decides to appoint Ramanunni as their candidate in the upcoming election. The decision is opposed by Udhyabhanu, a veteran politician of the NSP, but this is overlooked by the others. Ramanunni, along with his sidekick Thomas Chacko, the NSP Youth Wing Secretary, attend an interview where Ambady Mohan assaults Ramanunni. As the promotions for the elections begin, the CDP announces their candidate as Ragini, who they think is the only person who can defeat Ramanunni.  While campaigning at a football match, Ambady Mohan is assassinated and Ramanunni and Chacko become the prime suspects. The Investigation Officer, Paulson Devassy finds out that Ramanunni's gun is missing a bullet, the studies match the bullet that killed Mohan with the bullets in Ramanunni's gun, and the [[ballistics]] show that the gun must have been used in the row where Ramanunni and Chacko were sitting. Ramanunni and Chacko escape from police custody and hide in the house of V.G. Madhavan, a journalist and a good friend of Ramanunni's. Madhavan's daughter Helena decides to help them. Now in disguise, they leave for a resort on an island off the coast of [[Goa]].

With Ramanunni gone, the NSP appoint Sumesh Venjara, a disliked and weak politician, as their new candidate. In Goa, Ramanunni reveals that it was Ambady Mohan and Udhayabhanu were behind his father's death, not the NSP activists.

He accused Udhayabhanu because of his role in his father's death. He explains to his mother that it was his duty to remove all obstacles from the CDP's path. His mother [[Lal Salam|salutes]] Ramanunni, and he does the same back.

Rangoon (2017 Hindi film)
 In 1943, as the [[World War II|Second World War]] rages on, India is fighting a combat of her own: independence from British rule. [[Subhas Chandra Bose|Subash Chandra Bose]], founder of the [[Indian National Army]] (INA), has become disenchanted with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s ''Ahimsa'' (non-violent) movement and desires to fight fire with fire. Recognizing the growing dominance of [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in the Indo-China region, the INA allies itself with the Japanese, hoping to ride the wave to Delhi. Indian troops in the [[British Indian Army]] are locked in pitched battles with both the INA and its Japanese contingent. In one such skirmish close to the Indo-Burma border, [[Jemadar]] Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor) and a group of fellow soldiers are cornered by the Japanese infantry. Running to escape on a barge, he is shot and captured as a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, the INA's top brass desperately seeks finances to replenish its heavy ammunition to aid the charge to Delhi.  Concurrently in India, Julia ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) a leading film star of the Indian cinema is the star performer of a dance troupe that entertains civilians and armed forces alike through films espousing her daredevilry. Zulfi (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) is her butler, make-up man, and trusted confidant. The films are produced by Rustom "Rusi" Billimoria ([[Saif Ali Khan]]), a former Indian action film star whose career was cut short when he lost a hand in a film stunt gone wrong. He is now Julia's mentor and the scion of a production house. Billimoria is on friendly terms with the resident British commander Major General David Harding ([[Richard McCabe]]), who encounters a gem-encrusted royal sword belonging to a [[Maharajah]] ([[Surendra Pal]]) at a gathering hosted by Billimoria. Slighted by the commander's arrogant demeanor, the King endeavors to send the sword to Indo-Burma border, where the INA hopes it can fund its artillery and drive the British out of India. An opportunity arises when Harding proposes dispatching Julia and her troupe to the war-torn border where he hopes to raise the sagging morale of his troops through her shows. When Billimoria and Julia (who are now in a relationship) object, Harding promises top-grade security and coerces them by threatening to block supplies of [[film stock]] from England, as [[Nazi Germany|Hitler-led Germany]] have stopped shipments. Billimoria's affair with Julia causes rifts in his family, with his wife demanding a divorce and his grandfather concocting a ruse to prevent Billimoria accompanying Julia on the tour.  On board the train, Jemadar Malik, who has apparently escaped as a prisoner of war, is assigned as security detail to Julia, much to her chagrin. Crossing a river, the full complement of passengers and boatmen come under fierce Japanese aerial attack, resulting in numerous casualties. The British assume Julia has fallen, but she has survived and is accosted by three Japanese soldiers. Malik, who has also escaped unscathed, arrives in time to save her from being killed and in the process, captures one Japanese soldier Hiromichi (Satoru Kawaguchi) as a hostage to lead them back to the Indian border. Through the rain-drenched jungle and a war-zone swarming with enemy platoons, Julia, Malik, and Hiromichi march slowly to their destination. Combing an anti-aircraft bunker, they barely escape a booby trap, with Malik furious at Hiromichi for leading them into an ambush. As Julia's gentleness and compassion counteracts against Malik's battle-hardened cynicism and aggression, the two fall in love, despite the overwhelming realization their journey will be over when Julia is reunited with Billimoria.  Back in India, Harding again proposes that Julia, now engaged to Billimoria, be dispatched to the front-lines, with anti-aircraft gun protection this time. Julia continues to exhibit feelings for Malik: she endorses him for the prestigious [[Victoria Cross]] medal and deliberately forces him to volunteer for a stage show. Billimoria begins to have suspicions about her behavior, which are confirmed after one surreptitious and passionate episode between Malik and Julia during an air-raid. Desiring vengeance, Billimoria volunteers as a stage hand on Julia's next show and after a tense routine, indirectly reveals that he is aware of her infidelity and ready to engage in a fight-to-the-finish with Malik. Meanwhile, Zulfi, who has also survived the earlier raid and is in reality a spy for the INA, has been entrusted to take the sword back to the INA by Mema ([[Lin Laishram]]), an INA agent in the British ranks, and Malik. It is then revealed that Malik did not escape his captivity in Rangoon but was freed by the INA who enlightened him about the evils of British rule in India, thereby enlisting him in the Gandhi regiment of the INA. Convinced of the cause and endowed with a fresh purpose, Malik clandestinely meets Julia before a show and delivers final instructions to Zulfi, who takes up a position outside her tent. Major Williams ([[Alex Avery]]) racially insults Zulfi after trying to forcibly enter Julia's tent to make her begin the show. Infuriated and inebriated, Zulfi hurls derogatory threats to the British on the radio during Julia's show. The outburst is heard by Billimoria, Harding, and other British soldiers, who rush to uncover the offensive culprit. Zulfi pleads guilty in Julia's presence on the stage but is shot dead by Williams, while Harding discovers Zulfi possessed a British Army officer's pistol. Distraught, Julia protests Billimoria's decision to not give Zulfi a proper burial as another member of Julia's troupe covertly abets Malik in a show of weapon check. As night falls, amid torrential downpour, Julia and Malik give Zulfi a proper burial, musing over loyalties and motivations.  During an attempt to arrange a rendezvous for transferring the sword with the INA via a letter, Malik and Mema are caught by Julia, who accuses Malik of betrayal. Torn between his feelings for her and his cause, Malik retorts by saying Julia is blinded by what she sees and the truth is lost on her. The letter reaches the INA, but Mema is trapped by the British while relaying messages. Next day, Harding blackmails Mema into revealing her co-conspirators by threatening to kill her son, at which point Malik discloses his true allegiance. Singing the INA anthem, Malik marches up defiantly to Harding, who signals Williams to shoot Mema dead. Enraged at this callous attitude, Malik lunges at Williams, but is captured and tortured by his former comrades. Horrified at this sequence of events, Julia turns a new leaf: she extracts Malik from a train bound for Delhi and resumes Zulfi's journey in getting the sword to the INA. At the bridge where the sword is to be handed over, Malik and Julia are cornered by the British. Malik convinces Julia to cross the bridge by covering her. In the ensuing gunfight, Malik is seriously injured by mortar fire while Billimoria arrives with British reinforcements. Harding tries to dissuade Julia from crossing the bridge with another false promise, but the mortally-wounded Malik defies him by walking across the bridge and sacrifices his own life so that Julia can continue. Harding orders the bridge be blown up, causing grave injuries to Julia. Seeking to redeem himself, Billimoria asks Julia for her last wish, who appeals that he continue her task of delivering the sword to the INA before falling to her death. Unsheathing the shining sword, Billimoria massacres the rest of the British troops on the bridge, decapitates Harding, and delivers the sword to the INA. The film ends by proclaiming the INA raised the Indian flag in 1944.

Bonin meets Tania, a young woman with a bite mark, who swears she was bitten by a dog and not an infected. While Tania is initially tied down for safety reasons, Bonin unties her and drives her away as the infected close in. They pick up a little girl, Zoé. Bonin also spots infected in a field and spies on them. He observes that they are gathered around a stack of found objects they have assembled, in a mysterious ritual.  Bonin, Tania, and Zoé head back to Therese and Pauline's house, as Bonin knows them. Together, the group realizes the house is on the path of the infected invasion.

Rememory
 Sam Bloom (Peter Dinklage) and his brother are driving in the night when their car collides with another, causing his brother’s death.  After a year, scientific pioneer Gordon Dunn (Martin Donovan), who creates a technology that allows one to extract memories and watch them on an external device, mysteriously dies and Bloom sets about trying to solve the murder using this memory machine. As the investigation continues, a web of intrigue and deceit is uncovered.  Bloom learns that Dunn’s device has a technical fault which causes side-effects leading to recurring hallucinations on its users including him, and that most of the users have been quite upset with Dunn, directly blaming him for their mental deterioration. He also finds out that Dunn and his wife Carolyn (Julia Ormond) were separated after they lost their only daughter in an accident.  When Carolyn finds Dunn’s memory recordings, it is revealed that Dunn committed suicide after realising his invention had caused nothing but pain and misery in the lives of the users. He does so by attempting to erase his ongoing memories while still connected to the device. Meanwhile, Bloom re-watches his “accident memory” and finds out that the Dunns were in the other car and that their daughter was killed in the collision.  Bloom hands over his memory to Carolyn as a sort of confession apology, but she doesn’t watch it and instead throws into the sea with Dunn’s recordings as she watches her daughter playing on the water—a hallucination resulting from her own use of the memory device.

 Xia Tian ([[Yang Mi]]) is a research scientist with Nexus Corporation. Her team, under the leadership of the Director (King Shih-Chieh), are working on wormhole technology to allow people to travel to parallel universes. However, the technology in its current state causes test animals to become aggressive and their cells to break down. IPT Lab, a competing agency that was working on the same technology, hires Tsui Hu ([[Wallace Huo]]) to steal Nexus's research.  Tsui Hu kidnaps Xia Tian's son, Dou Dou (Hummer Zhang) and gives Xia Tian one hour to bring him all the research. Xia Tian gets the research but is late reaching Tsui Hu, so he kills Dou Dou. Unable to live without her son, Xia Tian returns to the Nexus building, where she uses the particle accelerator to travel to a parallel universe, but back in time by one hour and fifty minutes.  In the second universe, Xia Tian takes her doppelgänger's place and, knowing how events play out, is quicker about getting the research to Tsui Hu. She recovers Dou Dou, but tricks Tsui Hu by giving him fake data. Tsui Hu chases the pair down and kills Dou Dou.  Xia Tian travels to a third universe, which now has three versions of her. The original Xia Tian (#1), who has become highly aggressive, arrives just as her second doppelgänger (#2) has cheated Tsui Hu and recovered Dou Dou. The two Xia Tians work together to avoid Tsui Hu and his goons, and Dou Dou is safely sent away to a hospital.  The three Xia Tians then learn that the Director is working with Tsui Hu, out of anger from being fired and the project handed over to Xia Tian. The Director suggested kidnapping Dou Dou to punish Xia Tian and force her to prove that the technology worked. Tsui Hu is also revealed to have been one of the test subjects at IPT Lab, and hopes to travel to a universe where he can save his wife and child. In a confrontation over the research data, Tsui Hu kills the Director, and is shot himself by Xia Tian #1. As he dies, Tsui Hu warns the women that the test subjects at IPT Lab turned on each other, and the women will do the same.  The three women have a standoff in the Nexus lab, with Xia Tian #1 determined to be the only one left to be with Dou Dou. She is killed by Xia Tian #2, who has accepted that she will die from cell deterioration. Xia Tian #3, who has not traveled across universes and is unchanged, is allowed to leave for the hospital, where she is reunited with Dou Dou. Left alone in the Nexus Lab which is about to explode, Xia Tian #2 turns on the particle accelerator, but it is unclear if she traveled to another universe, or if she died in the explosion.  A year later, the surviving Xia Tian is unemployed but living a happy, simple life with Dou Dou.

Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of [[cicada]]s fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara removes Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.  While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes [[Viral video|viral]], despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be "[[resurrection|rebirth]]", as Samara is successfully reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.

The Ritual (2017 film)
  Five old friends from university--Phil, Dom, Hutch, Luke, and Rob--meet over drinks at a pub, and discuss plans for a group trip to catch up with one another. Rob suggests hiking in Sweden, but is quickly shot down by the others. Later in the evening, the group exits the pub and passes a shop. Luke wishes to stop and purchase a bottle of Vodka, which Rob accompanies him in doing. While conversing in the shop, the pair notices the distressed cashier slumped against the wall behind the register. Two armed robbers emerge from the back room, and Luke hides behind a shelf at the end of the aisle, leaving Rob frozen in fear. The robbers antagonize Rob, demanding his wallet, watch, and ring. Rob parts with the first two willingly, but refuses to give them his ring, as it is his wedding band. Luke, still hidden from sight, flips the bottle in his hand and prepares to intervene. However, he is too slow to act, and Rob is bludgeoned to death before his eyes.  To honor Rob's wish, the four embark on a hiking trip along ''[[Kungsleden]]'', or King's Trail, in [[Sarek National Park]] in northern Sweden six months after his death. When Dom loses his footing and injures his knee, impairing his ability to walk, Hutch consults the map and decides that an alternate route through a forest off the trail will take them half the time. Upon entering the forest, the group encounters strange phenomena, including a gutted elk hanging from the tree branches and strange symbols carved on the trees.   As night falls, a torrential rainstorm soaks the men. While looking for shelter, they come upon an abandoned cabin and decide to break in and stay overnight. Inside the cabin, they find necklaces hanging from the walls that depict similar symbols as the runes carved in the tree. While exploring the second floor of the cabin, Phil discovers a strange wooden effigy that is shaped like a decapitated human torso with antlers for hands.  During the night, the four are plagued by nightmares. Upon waking the next morning, Luke finds that he has sustained a set of strange puncture wounds on his chest. The group finds Phil in the attic, naked and kneeling in prayer in front of the effigy.  The group leaves the cabin to continue their travels deeper into the woods, trying to find a way out.  Upon climbing a ridge in order to gain some perspective regarding their location, Luke sees a human-like hand wrapped around the trunk of a distant tree. While trying to discuss his findings with the group, Dom is doubtful of his report. An argument ensues wherein Dom reveals that he blames Luke for Rob's death, and calls Luke cowardly for failing to act during the robbery.  Later that night, Luke is woken from another nightmare by screams. Discovering that Hutch's tent is empty, the three rush deeper into the woods, following Hutch's screams. By dawn, they realize that they have become lost and cannot recall where their campsite was. They decide to continue their search without their tents and supplies. The three come upon Hutch impaled on tree branches, much like the gutted deer they had found earlier. The group retrieves Hutch's body for his compass and knife, and then give him an impromptu burial by covering his body with tree branches.  Luke leaves Phil and Dom on the lower part of a ridge, climbing a hill that provides an overview of the entire forest. He realizes that they are relatively close to the edge of the forest, and also spots smoke rising from distant campfires. He rejoins the two to tell them the news, but finds them with their flashlights pointed towards the trees, saying they heard a noise. Suddenly, Phil is dragged off-screen by an unseen creature. Upon seeking a hiding spot, Luke encounters Dom, and urges him to run with him. They get to their feet and begin to run, the creature giving chase. They pass Phil's body impaled on the branches of a tree near a path of torches that leads to a small village. They seek shelter in the first building they see, and collapse on the cabin floor, only to be knocked unconscious by the entity.    When they awaken, they find themselves restrained by their hands in a basement. An elderly woman enters the basement and inspects the puncture marks on Luke's chest. She pulls down her dress to reveal a similar pattern on her chest. She turns to leave the basement and utters a command in a foreign language, which prompts two men to grab Dom and bring him to the upper floor of the cabin. A younger woman enters the basement and explains that preparations are being made for sacrifice. Some time later, Dom is escorted back to the basement, beaten and bloodied, but still alive. He explains to Luke that he will serve as a human sacrifice to the creature, and instructs him to find a way to escape and destroy the village.  Dom is taken outside of the cabin and brought to a wooden post, where his hands are tied behind his back. As day shifts to night, a roar can be heard from the forest. The captors immediately fall to their knees in worship. Dom has a vision of his wife emerging from the trees and holding his face in her hands. This is in reality the creature that has been pursuing the men, and it bears a resemblance to the wooden effigy they discovered in the abandoned cabin. The creature removes Dom from the post and impales him on the branches of a nearby tree, leaving him to die. Desperate to escape, Luke breaks from one of his restraints by breaking his thumb, but cannot undo the second one before he is interrupted by the young woman's sudden entrance. When Luke asks about the creature, she explains that it is called a ''[[Jötunn]]'', a god-like figure stemming from Scandinavian mythology, and that they provide it sacrifices in return for immortality. She states that Luke will take part in a ritual where he will submit to the creature and join the cult, or be killed.  After she leaves, Luke breaks free from his restraints and leaves the basement. He ventures to the upper floor of the cabin, hearing prayers and screaming coming from behind a closed door. Armed with a burning torch, he opens the door and finds a twisted congregation of mummified, but still living humans, evidently the end result of the immortality granted by their worship of the creature. Following Dom's last wish, he sets the worshipers alight. This act attracts the Jötunn, who emerges from the forest to find the cabin burning. In a rage, the creature kills the remaining worshipers. Luke uses this opportunity to escape from the burning cabin undetected, armed with a rifle and an axe. Before running into the woods, Luke aims and takes a shot at the creature as it is about to kill a worshiper. The creature pursues him, attempting to cripple his mind by causing hallucinations of his recurring nightmare. The creature eventually catches him, and forces him onto his knees multiple times, offering Luke a chance to submit. He uses an axe which he had previously taken from one of the worshipers to strike the creature on its head. He then follows the sunlight, emerging from the forest into an open field. The creature does not emerge from the treeline, as it seems unable to follow. The monster roars at him, and he screams back in triumph. Luke turns from the monster and heads in the direction of a paved road with a passing car, a sign of civilization.

Roman J. Israel, Esq.
 Roman J. Israel is a lawyer working for $500 a week at a small law firm in [[Los Angeles]]. In his two-partner office, Israel is responsible for preparing briefs, often focusing on the civil rights of their defendants, while William Jackson, the firm's owner and a well-respected professor, focuses on the courtroom appearances that Israel struggles with. Israel has spent years developing a brief that he believes will bring social reform to the unfair use of plea-bargaining to induce guilty pleas in the justice system. Though short on interpersonal skills, Israel is gifted with a phenomenal memory as well as strong personal convictions on the meaning of justice, which he has pursued at the expense of family.  Jackson suffers a fatal heart attack. The firm is broke and will close, all to be handled by Jackson’s former student, George Pierce. Pierce, who greatly admired Jackson and is impressed by Israel’s legal mind (“worth $500 an hour”), offers a job at his own large firm. Israel rejects this offer, believing that Pierce is simply a greedy lawyer. Israel meets Maya during a job interview at a local activist network. The interview does not go well, but Maya asks him to speak at an upcoming meeting organizing a protest.  Israel reluctantly takes a job with Pierce. Israel is a poor fit, clashing with senior partner Jesse Salinas after Israel mockingly laughs at a joke Salinas makes about battered women. After attempting to interest Pierce in his brief to change the legal system, Israel is disappointed when he is instead assigned by Pierce to handle clients.   Israel is assigned Derrell Ellerbee, a young man arrested for murder. Ellerbee tells Israel that he is willing to tell police the whereabouts of the actual shooter, longtime criminal Carter Johnson, and will testify against him. Israel goes behind Salinas' back to negotiate a plea deal with the district attorney, but the prosecutor rejects his offer and hangs up on Israel after he insults her unsympathetic counter-offer to his bargain. No deal is struck and Ellerbee is murdered as a snitch.  Israel's mishandling of Ellerbee's case leads to trouble for the firm and Pierce berates him for his insubordination. That evening Israel is mugged and beaten by a homeless man he attempted to help. Israel becomes downcast and cynical, illegally using the information he received from Ellerbee to anonymously collect the $100,000 reward for Johnson's location. Israel indulges in luxuries he had previously eschewed.  Pierce apologizes to Israel, revealing that the death of Jackson and his observations of Israel’s dedication to justice has touched him. He reforms his firm to add a new focus on [[pro-bono]] cases, headed by Israel. Pierce offers to work with Israel on the legal brief for plea reform, but Israel's new materialistic outlook prevents him from enjoying the changes he has inspired.  Maya calls Israel to ask him out on a date, where she shares some of her struggles with idealism and thanks Israel for his inspiration about progressive lawyering and advocacy, but he appears unmoved.  Pierce calls Israel to meet a new client arrested for murder, who turns out to be Carter Johnson. At the jailhouse, Johnson accuses Israel of divulging privileged communications to collect the reward. Having accepted that he will spend the rest of his life in prison, Johnson's only goal is to torment Israel with the threat of jail time or even death. Israel finally suffers a breakdown and renounces his greedy, self-centered worldview.  Israel returns the reward (with a promise to repay the $5,750 he spent), reconciles with Maya and Pierce and tries to motivate them to pursue their inner sense of justice. He tells Pierce that he is turning himself in to the police for his crime, then starts walking to a nearby station, but is shot and killed by one of Johnson's henchmen.  In the aftermath, Maya is seen to be renewed in her activism efforts, while Pierce files Israel’s massive brief in Federal Court, in both their names, intent on continuing Israel’s efforts to reform the justice system.

Before they decide what to do, Jess takes a call from Peter and mentions during her panic that her friends hired a stripper and she is confused, before Alice destroys her phone and Blair confiscates the others to prevent anyone making calls until they can determine their next move. Peter takes this to mean that Jess is leaving him and decides to race down to Miami to convince Jess to take him back.  The friends purchase a burner phone and call Blair's uncle, who is a lawyer. After telling him they moved the body, he tells them that, while they may have gotten away with accidental death if they had made the call immediately, they could face up to fifteen years in prison for tampering with the crime scene unless no body is found.

Sahara (2017 film)
   The film begins in a sandstorm where travelers rest with their camels beneath a cliff. Here, Ajar the cobra and Pitt the scorpion successfully steal a watermelon from one of the camel's baskets.  After the storm, the two protagonists try to enjoy their melon, only to have it brutally taken from them by a larger bully purple cobra named Saladin. Later, the pals are traveling through the sandstone cliffs where snakes gather in the shade, only to be pelted by melon seeds by Saladin's friends. Ajar is teased for being young and small, as he hasn't shed to his adult skin yet. At the edge of the desert, Ajar proposes to flee to the Oasis, but Pitt points out that the Oasis belongs to the Green Snakes. There, they happen to spot Eva, a Green Snake, trying to leave the Oasis, only to be caught by one of the Secretary Birds (Chief-Chief) that guard it. Pitt uses that as a reason to not go to the Oasis, but Ajar is not discouraged.  Eva is returned to her father, who reprimands her for always trying to leave the Oasis, which she clearly hates. Upset, she leaves; passing her brother, Gary wearing a grass wig. Later, Eva sits by a pool of mud and seems to get an idea while using her tail to draw shapes with the mud. Meanwhile, Ajar paints himself green with moss and sneaks into the Oasis despite Pitt's complaints where they find his disguise has worked against one of the guards. After entering, it isn't long before the Secretary Birds warn of intruders ("Dusties") and the friends dart for the grass; thinking it's them. They separate and Ajar finds an unfamiliar brown snake who happens to be Eva in disguise as a Dusty, who asks for his help.  They get stuck at the edge of a cliff against one of the guard birds and Eva leaps off the cliff with Ajar. Ajar, however, can't swim and almost drowns before Eva gives him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which he takes for a kiss. Their disguises begin to wash away in the water and they lose the guards overhead by hiding in a river cave. There, they make a truce and Eva invites Ajar and Pitt to go with her but just as she heads out of the cave, she is taken by Omar, a cruel snake charmer and skinner.  As Ajar pursues Omar's camelcade, he and Pitt are snatched by Chief-Chief and taken back to the other birds at their base, who threaten to kill them. Ajar manages to find Gary, who was caught sniffing pollen, and threatens him in order to make Chief-Chief free them. They flee on the back of one of the birds, but just as they find the camelcade, Pitt interferes and accidentally stings the bird; causing it to sleep. They are forced to continue on the ground.  Meanwhile, Eva meets other snakes that were captured by Omar--including a green male snake named George--who greet her happily. Later that night, Omar uses the flute to make the snakes dance for a small audience. Eva tries to escape, but is mesmerized and brought back by the flute.  Ajar and Pitt, constantly annoyed by Gary, struggle to navigate a maze of sandstone cliffs. They accidentally fall into a cave, finding a colony of glow-worms that welcome them kindly and give them directions to find the camelcade at first before luring them in as their prey. The trio escapes through a hole in the cave made by Ajar and find they've come to the other side. Gary, however, has had enough and reprimands Ajar (including the fact that he has not shed to his adult skin yet) and the ridiculous journey. Nevertheless, Gary's outvoted and they continue traveling after Eva.  After a musical adventure montage, Gary complains about the desert and tension grows. They find tourists and climb into their car to find water, only to be discovered because of Gary due to his pollen addiction. While the snakes are thrown out, Pitt stings himself accidentally and falls asleep; getting stuck inside. Gary and Ajar fight before continuing onward.  Eva is upset about her situation, but one of the dancing snakes named Pietra (who doesn't like her) shows her a way out of the basket. Eva is caught by a camel, who causes a ruckus, during which Pietra tries to escape as well. Omar captures both of them and considers adding them to the basket of snakes who are to be skinned, only to get a more nefarious idea.  Ajar and Gary find a plant in the desert, which turns out to be a fast-talking sandfish. The sandfish has seen the camelcade they're looking for, as well as knows of the nearby town it's headed to, but refuses to give directions except the name Souksoukville and digs away in the sand. Then, Gary makes rude remarks about Pitt, which causes an enraged Ajar to pounce on Gary. During their tustling, Ajar and Gary find a small oasis where they agree to rest for the night and talk. Ajar reveals that he met Pitt after Pitt's family was killed by Touaregs. Pitt, meanwhile, sleeps at the tourists' camp, where he meets a wandering family of scorpions who stay with him. He later tells them about his adventure with Ajar, though makes himself look like the hero. The family later asks that he stays with them, but he says he must go find Ajar.  That night, Omar forces Eva and Pietra to have a dance-off in a ring of fire. Eva wins and Pietra is taken away to be put in the basket of snakes to be skinned.  Ajar and Gary find an underwater river in a well and decide to ride it in a bucket to the nearby town in order to escape a coming sandstorm, despite the fact that Ajar can't swim. In the town, they find Omar's store by following ads for the dancing snakes and sneak inside as Gary overcomes his pollen addiction. There, Ajar sees George consoling an upset Eva and thinks he's her boyfriend. Gary convinces Ajar to continue to save Eva and they manage to release a ceiling fan to crush the cages and release all the snakes. Omar hears the noise and goes to get the snake-controlling flute, but Ajar quickly steals it when Omar is bitten by Gary (though Omar reveals that he is immune to snake venom).  Omar pursues Ajar out of the building, where the sandstorm rages, and chases him across the city (getting carried far leaps by the wind). At the top of a mosque, Omar tries to grab the flute from Ajar, only to accidentally break it. He grabs Ajar to keep himself from falling off the building, but Ajar's old skin comes off and Omar disappears into the sandstorm. As the storm calms, Ajar falls onto a platform below.  Ajar is found by Eva and his friends and thought to be dead at first before awakening and hugging him. They find that Ajar has shed and now has a much more beautiful, elaborate adult skin. Eva realizes that Ajar had crossed an entire desert for her, to which Ajar replies that he would cross a thousand deserts for her and save her from what she could've met a dark fate. The two coil together as they share a big strong passionate kiss until Omar suddenly appears for a moment, but is stung by Pitt and falls asleep. Pitt has brought a female friend from the scorpion family named Emily.  Later, they are all riding atop the tourist car from before. Ajar sits with Eva; asking him if he dances based on her experience with the other snakes, Pitt sits with Emily, with whom they both share a romantic embracement off-screen, and Gary sits with Pietra. Gary admires her and she remarks that she happens to also love handsome, super-rich heirs.  As the van drives off, the fast-talking sandfish appears next to a camel, and tells this random camel (and also the viewers) that Ajar and Eva might go back and live happily ever after at the Oasis and teach the Dusties and Green Snakes to live together as equals, but he has no idea.

Sarkar 3
 A businessman named Deven Gandhi (Bajrangbali Singh) approaches Subhash Nagre "Sarkar" ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) for a real estate project over a large slum in Daravi Mumbai. Sarkar suggests that Gandhi should offer appropriate compensation and relocate the slum dwellers. Gandhi deems that too expensive and would rather offer a smaller commission to Sarkar to force the relocation. Sarkar refuses and, when Gandhi insists that he will go to another power bastion, Sarkar asserts that he will not let Gandhi go ahead. Gandhi reports back to his Dubai based boss Vallya ([[Jackie Shroff]]). They join hands with a rival opposition leader named Govind Deshpande ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and plot to oust Sarkar.  Sarkar’s wife ([[Supriya Pathak]]) pleads with him to permit Shivaji "Chiku" ([[Amit Sadh]]) (the grandson) to join him. Sarkar hesitates: the boy is hot-headed and volatile like his father Vishnu, but ultimately lets him come. Chiku immediately clashes with Gokul (Sarkar’s longtime loyal right hand man) ([[Ronit Roy]]) over various matters including whether or not to eliminate Deshpande. It is implied that Chiku's girlfriend Annu ([[Yami Gautam]]) is using him to get to Sarkar because Sarkar had ordered the elimination of her father. Meanwhile Gandhi approaches Gokul with the proposition to help him or Chiku would become the next Sarkar and Gokul will remain a servant.  Deshpande plots with Gandhi and Vallya to instigate mill workers against Sarkar. Chiku is on the warpath to attack Deshpande. Sarkar tries to calculate who is behind everything. One day, Deshpande is hotly pursued and killed and Sarkar, who has long held a reputation for bumping off opposition, is blamed. Sarkar notes that whoever did this is determined and cunning and will stop at nothing. When assassins open fire on Sarkar at the Ganpati Visarjan festival, it becomes clear that Sarkar’s inner circle has been breached. Chiku shows Sarkar the video of Gandhi meeting Gokul and, separately, Gokul remonstrates and says that Chiku, used by the wily Annu and his own vengeance for his father, is behind everything. Sarkar expels Chiku whereupon Chiku joins Gandhi.  Vallya orders a bomb blast at the mill. Gokul rightly reports that it was executed by Chiku (who is now out to destroy Sarkar) and Gandhi. Around this time Sarkar’s wife passes away. Gokul beseeches Sarkar to give the order to kill Chiku. Chiku is fired upon but he escapes. Gokul begins hunting him down.  Soon, Gokul is shot dead (presumably by Chiku) and Sarkar swears revenge on Chiku. Vallya arrives in India and meets Sarkar. He points out that Chiku is too inexperienced to become Sarkar and is therefore useless, and offers to help Sarkar eliminate Chiku. Sarkar discloses that Chiku was dispatched to infiltrate Gandhi by Sarkar himself. Differences with Annu had been cleared and she too was taken into confidence. Gokul had turned to Gandhi and played a part in the mill agitation and in the slum development so as to sideline Chiku and eventually become Sarkar. The objective of this plan was to draw out Vallya. Chiku walks in at this point. There is a gunshot and Vallya is killed. With their adversaries now dead, Chiku and Sarkar sip tea while Sarkar educates the inexperienced Chiku on palace politics.

One morning, Rini takes a walk with Hendra, who reveals he had seen a figure resembling Mawarni at her window. He informs her that it's something else that has assumed her form but is not actually her mother. Meanwhile, the grandmother is seen penning a letter in her room, but later depicted in another room looking distressed as she stands up from her wheelchair. As Rini and Bondi return home, they are shocked to discover their grandmother's corpse inside the well. The family move on with her funeral in their father's absence. Rini discovers the letter addressed to Budiman Syailendra. Accompanied by Hendra, she visits the address to deliver the letter. Budiman informs her that he is her grandmother's childhood friend and his grandfather's classmate. He reveals that her grandmother did not originally approve of his father's marriage to Mawarni. Artists were not seen as respectable prospects, and she was thought to be infertile before giving birth to Rini and her siblings. Budiman hands Rini a booklet with information he wrote that would help explain her situation.  Tony, reading Budiman's ''Maya'' magazine article on Satan's slaves, pieces together information from his childhood memory of accompanying his mother on industry functions and coming across individuals who were always in attendance but rarely spoke with other guests, inferring they were watching over their mother. He tells Rini that their mother may have been connected to this Satanic sect, who allow barren women to bear children through the worship of Satan but with the condition that the last child be handed over to the cult at the age of seven. Rini finds the story hard to believe. Following more paranormal experiences, she seeks help from the Ustad who checks on their house and advises they perform ''[[Salah]]'' to pray to Allah regularly. That night, while Rini practices Salah in her ''mukena'' she is haunted by the ghostly figure prompting her and her siblings to run to the Ustad's house for refuge.  The next day, Tony reveals to Rini that based on the article their mother wasn't impregnated by her husband but my members of the cult. Hendra visits Budiman following a phonecall to collect an article he wrote as a correction to the one in the booklet. On his way back, Hendra falls from his motorcycle and is crushed by a truck. His body is taken to the Ustad's home by local residents where Rini finds the letter. That night, Rini sees an apparition resembling Hendra outside the window before being nearly dragged out as she went to close the window. Her father returns and takes the children home before breaking down as he's informed of their grandmother's death. When Rini confronts him to ask about what he was talking to her mother about on the night she died, they hear screams from Ian. The father dives into the well to rescue Ian. The family becomes victim to the worst [[poltergeist]] experience so far, while the house is surrounded by figures likely from the Satanic sect. They never enter the home but the poltergeist attempts to drag Ian out but is saved by his brother Bondi.   The next day they wait for a truck to move out of the house, a day before Ian's 7th birthday. The Ustad visits their home but the truck fails to arrive. As darkness falls, they experience an electricity blackout and the family leave to their rooms to get sleep while the Ustad rests by the dining table. Rini wakes Tony up after reading the letter which states the last child isn't actually a sacrifice but an offspring of Satan. The father wakes up in bed to see Mawarni's corpse next to him, while downstairs Bondi sees Ian speaking unintelligibly while staring out the window. The former trio escape downstairs only to witness the Ustad killed by the undead as they break into their home. The family finds Bondi, then notices Ian exiting into the backyard. The father follows but fails to save him as Ian stands next to his mother's undead corpse with dozens more behind them. Tony drags him inside, while the undead approach the house as they hide in the living room. The spirit of their grandmother slows down the undead by holding back the door; Budiman arrives through the front door to rescue the family who then run into his van. A year later, the family have settled in the [[apartment|flats]] and are visited by a neighbor who gives them food. The neighbor returns to her apartment and talks to Batara, and it's revealed that she is Darminah, the antagonist of the original film.

Before Anuya could kill Sathya, Chowdary shoots her after listening to the conversation on his way to the farmhouse with his subordinates. Gowtham is arrested and reveals that Ria was not his daughter, as a medical report confirmed him [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]] in the past.

As Sathya realizes that Ria is his biological child and approaches her, he sees a reflection of Shweta smiling at him.

The Sense of an Ending (film)

One day, his ex-wife, Margaret ([[Harriet Walter]]) asks him to accompany their pregnant daughter, Susie ([[Michelle Dockery]]) to her prenatal birthing class. After dropping her home, he reads a letter he has received earlier that day. It is from the estate of the recently deceased Mrs. Sarah Ford, the mother of a former girlfriend whom he met in the 1960s while at university. He is left 500 pounds and two documents, the first is a letter somewhat explaining an unwarranted gift. The second document is still with Tony's former girlfriend and Sarah's daughter, Veronica Ford. Tony is confused why the mother of an ex-girlfriend whom he only met once decades ago would leave him something in her will.  While having lunch with Margaret, he reveals for the first time his relationship with Veronica and his one-time meeting with her mother, Sarah. Seeing that Tony speaks highly of both of them, Margaret jokingly asks which one of them did he sleep with. To which he comments neither one. He then reminisces about his time at school. In Sixth Form, Tony was a handsome but self-conscious young man. He ([[Billy Howle]]) and his two best friends accept a new member into their group, Adrian Finn ([[Joe Alwyn]]), a highly intelligent boy who enjoys arguing with their teacher and considers himself an intellectual. During their time at school a classmate, Robson, dies from what many believe to be suicide after his girlfriend became pregnant. Drawing on the philosophy of French existentialist Albert Camus, the friends discuss the philosophical meaning of suicide, coming to the conclusion that Robson did not die for the right reasons.   After the boys graduate and go their own ways, Adrian earns a full ride to [[Cambridge]] while Tony is accepted into the [[University of Bristol]]. Tony meets and begins a relationship with Veronica Ford ([[Freya Mavor]]). After some time, she takes him to meet her family. Her father, David Ford ([[James Wilby]]) and brother, Jack Ford ([[Edward Holcroft]]), are a little crude but friendly. However, her mother, Sarah Ford ([[Emily Mortimer]]), is very attractive and even flirts with Tony. At dinner, Tony tells Jack, who studies at Cambridge, that his best friend Adrian also studies there, but Jack does not know who that is. Later that night, Tony masturbates in the bathroom following a goodnight kiss from Veronica.  The next morning, Tony wakes up and finds that Veronica, Jack and David have left for a walk, leaving him and Sarah alone in the house. As she fixes him breakfast, Sarah flirts with Tony and then subtly warns him about Veronica's true nature, but he does not immediately get it.  As Tony is leaving, Sarah responds to Tony’s goodbye wave with a mysterious horizontal gesture at waist level. Tony is unsure if she is waving goodbye to him or offering him a signal or warning.   When Tony returns to university, Veronica visits him to meet Adrian and the rest of their friends. They have a good time, but later on, Veronica breaks up with Tony. He later receives a letter from Adrian requesting his blessing for a romantic relationship he has begun with Veronica, to which Tony reacts strongly. He decides to respond positively at first. However, he then writes a new response, harsh and unrelenting, speaking of Veronica being damaged and how even her mother warned him about her, but without any real reasoning behind this accusations. He also writes how he wishes they will have a child together, and the child will have to pay for its parents' sins. He never hears back from either of them after that.   A few years later, Tony meets up with his two best friends from Sixth Form and they inform him that Adrian has committed suicide. They explain how Adrian seemed happy and in love at first, presumably with Veronica, whom he got together with after Tony introduced them both. Tony argues that Veronica could have met Adrian through her brother, Jack who also studies at Cambridge. However, his friends point out how Adrian and Veronica had an instant connection when he first introduced them and it was then that their affair started. Following Adrian's suicide, the three friends go their separate ways. Tony later meets Margaret, marries her and settles down.   In present day, Tony goes to meet Sarah Ford's lawyer and learns that the second document is Adrian's diary. Tony reconnects with his two Sixth Form friends and they help him in locating Veronica, plus requesting the diary and an explanation. Veronica ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) replies to the email and they set up a meeting. Their meeting does not go well as it is apparent that Veronica is still angry at him. She explains that she has burned the diary and leaves after handing Tony a letter. It turns out to be the angry letter he wrote to her and Adrian.  In other words, Veronica destroyed the diary that was in possession of her mother at the time of her death, yet chose to keep Tony's letter, which clearly was written out of hurt and frustration.  Tony is clearly confused about what drove Adrian to commit suicide, and the frustration is even greater knowing that the diary destroyed by Veronica would have helped to explain what led his best friend to take his own life.  While spying on Veronica, Tony sees her with a mentally unstable young man with red hair like Adrian, and starts to believe it is their son. However Tony later learns that Adrian Jr. is not Veronica's son but her younger half-brother. Tony immediately assumes it is the son of Veronica's mother, Sarah and Adrian Sr.    A few days later, Tony's daughter Susie goes into labor and gives birth to a healthy baby boy she names Joshua. Some time later Tony writes to Veronica, apologizing to her for what he has done. She receives the letter, and we see her in profile as she reads it.

Sekigahara (film)
  After brief flash-forwards both to the morning of the battle as well as to the present day, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] meets a young temple acolyte, "Sakichi", and recruits him into his service after being impressed with him.  Sakichi, who is [[Ishida Mitsunari]], gains wealth and prestige in his new master's service, and eventually is granted a large domain.  Hideyoshi unifies most of Japan and takes the title of [[Sesshō and Kampaku|taikō]], but also grows erratic in his old age.  He orders a series of expensive [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|invasions of Korea]], bankrupting the nobles, and also orders the execution of [[Toyotomi Hidetsugu|his heir]], the regent, as well as the entire family of his heir, including their women and children.  Dismayed at this unjust act, Mitsunari pleads for mercy, but fails to move Hideyoshi's heart.  After the maids of the to-be-executed Princess who had been engaged to marry the heir fight back, Mitsunari spares them; admiring their spirit, he recruits one of them, a ninja known as Hatsume, into his service.  Mitsunari discusses the matter with his friend [[Ōtani Yoshitsugu]], and also meets the respected samurai [[Shima Sakon]] and his wife Hanano.  He recruits Sakon into his service as his chief adviser by promising to rule with justice once Hideyoshi passes away.  Intrigues continue at court.  Mitsunari offends the wily and powerful lord [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] at a temple.  Hideyoshi criticizes the conduct of young warrior [[Kobayakawa Hideaki]] in Korea; Tokugawa convinces him afterward that Mitsunari was turning Hideyoshi against him.  Tokugawa also recruits a group of hot-headed warriors to his side.  Hatsume, by direct spying as well as bribes, keeps Mitsunari informed of Tokugawa's actions; meanwhile, Tokugawa directs his chief spy, "Lady Aacha" / White Snake, to eliminate the spies and ninjas that are keeping Mitsunari informed of his activities.  The taikō eventually perishes; Mitsunari orders that the death be covered up while arrangements are made and troops recalled from Korea.  Hideyoshi's will complicates matters, as the new heir, a young child, must be moved from Kyoto to Osaka Castle - letting Tokugawa rule over Kyoto uncontested, without the rest of the court there to support the heir.  Tokugawa seeks to discredit Mitsunari as a rebel and traitor before moving directly against him; the two prepare dueling complaints to be brought before the Council of Regents over the conduct of close allies.  Violence is avoided for the time being by the influence of respected neutral [[Maeda Toshiie]].  The situation worsens after Maeda dies.  Mitsunari is forced into retreat; he also confesses his love to Hatsume, despite already having a wife and children.  Hatsume promises to meet up with him after a mission, but White Snake, who has already ferreted out several traitors, has her forces ambush Hatsume.  She is captured and sold into slavery, and never makes it to Mitsunari's new headquarters.  Mitsunari, a nearly blind Ōtani Yoshitsugu, and Shima Sakon work to build an alliance against Tokugawa and in favor of their young heir; Tokugawa builds up his own forces.  Tokugawa has the edge, however, of functionally holding the families of various potential Toyotomi-loyalist factions hostage by dint of his control of the capital.  Mitsunari hopes for the support of two particularly powerful allies: the Uesugi clan, who can strike the Tokugawa from the North and force them to split their forces, as well as the Mōri clan, powerful Southern lords.  However, Tokugawa's allied [[Iga-ryū|Iga ninjas]] makes communication and coordination with the Uesugis difficult, and Mōri Terumoto chooses to remain entrenched in his castle, to the frustration of Mitsunari.  He notes that if Tokugawa wins, the Mori lands will likely be reduced anyway as the only reward available for Eastern lords.  Before the battle, Mitsunari declines to take advantage of various tactics he considers as possibly blackening the name of his movement, such as captured of enemy families for hostages, night attacks, or simply remaining entrenched in castles and letting Tokugawa come to him.  Various lords on both sides elect to merely observe and wait as the armies, equipped with [[Firearms of Japan#Sengoku Period|matchlock rifles]] and cannon, attack each other at the Sekigahara crossroads.  Shima Sakon is shot, and retreats to the battlefield clinic which Hanao, his wife, runs.  One of Mitsunari's allied ninjas attempts to assassinate Tokugawa directly, but is stopped by White Snake, and both of them die.  As the battle is in the balance, Kobayakawa Hideaki's aides, many of whom actually work for Tokugawa, manipulate his army to support Tokugawa instead; his anguished cries cannot stop his army from helping swing the tide in Tokugawa's favor.  Ōtani Yoshitsugu, who was commanding the section where Hideaki attacked, is slain.  Mitsunari declines to commit suicide, and instead flees after ensuring that Hanano and other wounded have escaped.  Captured, Mitsunari encourages a distraught and sorrowful Kobayakawa Hideaki.  He also sees that Hatsume has survived and escaped to see him one final time.

The Shack (2017 film)
 Mackenzie "Mack" Phillips suffered physical and emotional abuse as a child at the hands of his drunken father. He witnessed similar abuse of his mother as well. There is the implication that as a 13-year-old boy he planned to [[poison]] his father with [[strychnine]], although it is never made clear whether he proceeded with this or how it was resolved. A lack of any subsequent guilt ascribed to it suggests that it was not carried out. As an adult he has a fulfilling life with his wife, Nan, and their three children: Kate, Josh and Missy.  Mack's life is shattered, however, when their youngest child Missy disappears during a camping trip while he is saving Kate and Josh during a canoeing accident. The police determine Missy is the victim of a serial killer after finding her torn dress and blood in a vacant cabin. Kate blames herself for Missy's death because of her own reckless behavior in causing the canoe accident in the first place. The tragedy derails Mack's faith and life until the onset of winter when he receives an unstamped, typewritten note in his mailbox. The surrounding snow is devoid of any incriminating tracks. The message is signed "Papa" (which was Nan's nickname for [[God]]) and invites him to meet at the cabin.  Thinking this may possibly be an opportunity for meeting and capturing or killing the serial killer, Mack drives himself there and, finding the ruined cabin cold and desolate and empty, is overcome with frustration, rage and an almost irresistible impulse to turn his handgun on himself.  But he suddenly encounters a mysterious [[Trinity|trio of strangers]] who invite him to stay at their well-furnished, cozy little house that is situated just down the path and, oddly, in the midst of a beautiful, sunshiny, summertime wilderness.  The trio of strangers gradually reveal their identities. The purpose of their invitation is to first help him to better understand his life as seen from a much broader context or higher perspective. This realization helps free him from an inclination to pass judgment upon himself as well as upon everyone else who crosses his path. It is from that new starting point that he may then continue his long, slow journey into healing for himself and his family and forgiveness for himself as well as for those who have grievously harmed him and his loved ones.

She plans to release the creature into a nearby canal when it will be opened to the ocean in several days' time. As part of his efforts to recover the Amphibian Man, Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, but the failure of his advances toward Elisa hampers his judgment, and he dismisses them. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring one of his cats. Startled, the Amphibian Man slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. The Amphibian Man gets as far as the cinema downstairs before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. He touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm, and the next morning Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. Elisa and the Amphibian Man soon become romantically involved, having sex in her bathroom, which she at one point fills completely with water.  Hoyt gives Strickland an ultimatum, asking him to recover the Amphibian Man within 36 hours. Meanwhile, Mosenkov is told by his handlers that he will be [[Extraction (military)|extracted]] in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health starts deteriorating. Mosenkov leaves to rendezvous with his handlers, with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Mosenkov is shot by one of his handlers, but Strickland shoots the handlers dead and then tortures Mosenkov for information. Mosenkov implicates Elisa and Zelda before dying from his wounds. Strickland then threatens Zelda in her home, causing her terrified husband to reveal that Elisa had been keeping the Amphibian Man. Strickland searches Elisa's apartment and finds a calendar note revealing when and where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.  At the canal, Elisa and Giles bid farewell to the creature, but Strickland arrives and attacks them all. Strickland knocks Giles down and shoots the Amphibian Man and Elisa, who both appear to die. However, the Amphibian Man heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where, deep underwater, he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, they open to reveal [[gill]]s like his. Elisa's final tie to the surface world is thus severed, and the two embrace. In a closing [[voice-over]] narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "[[Happy ending|happily ever after]]" with the Amphibian Man.

Then, it is revealed that a pigeon race organizer  ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]), came to know about David's assignment to injure Raheem and paid David more money to kill him, since Raheem and Saara are his arch nemesis in the pigeon race and the duo wins every single game.

 On Friday, Andy Sikes cleans up in his basement, while his wife, Martha, speaks to his brother, sheriff Zeke Sikes above. When his young daughter, Sally, comes down to the basement, he silences her and makes her promise not to reveal his presence. Suspicious, Zeke investigates, but Andy escapes by stealing a neighbor's car. Zeke, revealed to have been shot during a bank robbery in which Andy participated, picks up his partner, Reed Ethington, and meets with FBI agents Kyle Walker and Kurt Biltmore. They investigate the house of judge Brad Dawkins, finding him dead. After an argument with the FBI agents over how to handle the investigation, Zeke steps out from his office. Meanwhile, Andy enters a forest to meet with Steph Burton, the wife of his accomplice, Ed Burton. He loads the bank's money in her car, but before he can get in, he is shot and killed, but we only see the shooter's arm, bearing the tattoo "State Champs".  On Thursday Zeke and the other cops investigate meth addict Chris Morrow, who is believed to have been the getaway driver. They find him dead, and Zeke reveals that Andy, a former prosecutor, was widely rumored to have been corrupt after a questionable plea deal that got Ed and Chris off easy in the accidental death of Steph's and Ed's son in a meth lab explosion. Elsewhere, Judge Dawkins angrily demands that an incriminating tape being used to blackmail him be destroyed. At her house, Steph intentionally injures herself. When Zeke, Reed, and the FBI agents arrive at her house, she tells them that Ed assaulted her when she refused to leave with him. Under pressure, she admits he said something about leaving for Mexico. Dawkins meets with his teenage boyfriend, only to be surprised by Andy. Dawkins, desperate to protect his secret, attacks Andy but is killed. Andy flees back to his house and hides in the basement.  Wednesday, the day after the heist, Chris and Andy attempt to figure out what to do after Ed has seemingly double crossed them by taking the money for himself. Leaving Chris with instructions to stay hidden, Andy goes back into town to check on his brother, who he hears on the news has been shot by Ed. As Zeke meets the FBI agents, Chris gets a phone call from Steph, who invites him over to split the money. She begins undressing, seducing Chris, who is confused because he believes she would hate him for his part in the death of her son. Judge Dawkins bursts into the hotel room, anxious to retrieve the tape. Steph provokes Chris into attacking Dawkins, who kills him. With both the murder and the tape used to pressure him, Steph forces him to hold the money for Ed. At his house, Dawkins breaks down, crying, and tells his wife that he always intended to be a better husband to her.  Andy, Chris, and Ed (whose "State Champs" tattoo is revealed) plan the robbery on Tuesday despite Steph's attempts to talk them out of it. After an argument over Ed's involvement in their son's death, Ed says the heist is the only way for them to escape their current life. Dawkins, who owns the bank, reluctantly gives the safe's combination to Ed in return for Ed's promise to give him the tape. After loading the bank's vault with money, Dawkins thanks Zeke for personally watching it overnight. Before leaving, Dawkins suggests that Zeke kill anyone who attempts to rob it instead of arresting them. As Zeke reads a book, Ed and Andy break into the bank and take Zeke hostage. Once Ed has the situation under control, Andy leaves to watch the door. Zeke easily sees through Ed's disguise and taunts him. After freeing himself, Zeke shoots Ed with a gun hidden in the paper bag that holds his dinner and reveals that Steph and he are the parents of the dead child. Steph and Zeke, who we see has the same arm tattoo, planned to kill everyone responsible for their child's death. After hiding Ed's body, Zeke asks Steph to shoot him, and he begins his investigation.

One night after departing a dinner, he unintentionally runs a red light, causing an accident that kills his friend Tom ([[Max Greenfield]]), who was riding in his car. His lawyer advises Harlon to take a plea deal, which will see him serving 16 months, instead of going to trial as he could do up to 7 years if he lost his case. Harlon agrees and is sentenced to incarceration at California Institution for Men (China).  Upon his arrival, Jacob is shocked by the brutal realities of the prison environment. Heeding his lawyer's advice to stand his ground, he reacts aggressively when provoked by an African-American prisoner in the exercise yard. After being detained in the SHU (Secured Housing Unit), Harlon realized he has caught the attention of Bottles ([[Jeffrey Donovan]]), the Chino shotcaller for the PEN1 ([[Public Enemy No. 1 (street gang)|Public Enemy No.1]]), a violent white supremacist gang. Bottles, thinking Harlon attacked the African-American prisoner for racial reasons, offers him protection and entry into PEN1. In return, Harlon is forced to carry out various tasks, from smuggling heroin to killing a "snitch" within his gang.  Harlon, nicknamed Money, begins to rise in rank and acquire gang-related tattoos. During a prison riot, Harlon gets caught on camera murdering another prisoner while protecting Herman Gómez, the leader of the [[Sureños]]. As a result, he is sentenced to  several more years, effectively quintupling his original sentence. He tells Katherine to forget about him, and stops all contact with his wife and son. Eventually, Katherine files for divorce.  Harlon's new convictions validate him as a gang member. He is transferred to Corcoran State Prison<ref>http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/COR.html</ref> to be placed under maximum-security. Like other "heavy-hitters", he is only allowed one hour  of "yard time" per day (which is spent in a steel cage, where he can talk to prisoners in adjacent cages). Eventually, Harlon is introduced to Beast ([[Holt McCallany]]), the head shot caller for the Aryan Brotherhood. For the last seven years, Beast has been managing the gang's activities from inside the prison via corrupt correctional officers. Impressed with Harlon's dedication, Beast promoted Harlon to his second-in-command. Harlon serves out his time in the SHU with no further incidents.  Before Harlon is released, he is ordered by Beast to orchestrate an arms deal with the Sureños. At his hesitation, Beast tells him he has to continue serving the gang's interests in exchange for his family's safety.  Upon his release, Harlon is greeted by Shotgun and other gang members, including Howie, a young former soldier with no criminal record. He learns that the weapon cache was found by Howie while in service. Meanwhile, Harlon's parole officer Kutcher ([[Omari Hardwick]]) is approached by Sheriff Sanchez ([[Benjamin Bratt]]) and other heads of a task force. They believe Harlon is putting together a large arms deal, and Harlon is put under surveillance. Despite the surveillance, Harlon sets the deal in motion, while making arrangements to transfer his "clean money" to his wife. Harlon becomes suspicious of Shotgun, and discovers him working as Kutcher's [[Informant|CI]].   On the day of the deal, Harlon shakes off surveillance and kills Shotgun. Kutcher finds Shotgun's body and retrieves his cellphone. After Harlon's group retrieves the weapon cache, they head to the exchange location. Harlon texts the location's coordinates to Shotgun's cellphone. After warning Howie to stay away from the criminal life, Harlon forces him off the vehicle. After the deal is closed, the police force, along with the ATF and SWAT, informed by Harlon's text, rush in. Almost all gang members are arrest or killed, only Howie escapes the bust.  Harlon is arrested, fully [[Validation (gang membership)|validated]], and given life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. He turns down Kutcher's offers of full pardon in exchange for testimonies against Beast. He is brought to Beast, who realizes he deliberately fumbled the deal. Beast announces that Harlon's family will die, and signals the corrupt guard to take Harlon back to his cell. Harlon produces a handcuff key and a razor blade that he had smuggled in earlier. He overpowers the guard, locks him inside his cage then unlocks Beast's cage. After a brief fight, Harlon kills Beast.  A blood-soaked Harlon looks at the guard, announces he is now in charge, and orders him to falsify the report to state that he acted in self-defense. Having assumed Beast's place at the top of the Aryan Brotherhood's hierarchy, he begins to serve his life sentence knowing that this was the best way he could truly protect his family. He receives a letter from Josh saying he and Katherine are moving on, and that he's forgiven him.

Simran (film)
  Praful Patel ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) is a young divorcee who lives with her parents and works in the housekeeping department in one of the five star hotels of Atlanta, Georgia, USA.  She shares a bitter relationship with her dad who is always blaming her for her mistakes in the past, instead of giving her moral support; so now, Praful  wants to move out and buy her own house.  She has applied for a loan and her loan gets pre-approved. In the meantime, Praful decides to go with her cousin on a trip to Las Vegas (her cousin pays for all tickets and accommodations).  In Las Vegas, she plays baccarat for the first time and wins big in her first few rounds. She quickly gets addicted to the game. The next day, she returns to the casino, but ends up losing not only the money she won the previous day, but a large chunk of her savings also.  Praful then returns to Atlanta after a week, only to find out that her bank application to the bank has been rejected as her credit rating is very low. Praful seeks her father's help but he insists that she should meet a young man named Sameer (Sohum Shah) who has been selected as her suitor.  After meeting with the suitor, she has mixed feelings about marriage and agrees to get engaged. However, her addiction to gambling takes a toll on her and Praful gives her last shot to gambling and goes back to Vegas.  Unfortunately, she ultimately loses all her savings so a  private money lender spots Praful (who is now drunk)  in the casino and offers her money. The drunk Praful - not in her right senses-  takes $32,000 from the money lender and in exchange gives him her driving license.  Praful loses all that borrowed money (along with her hard-earned savings) and has to return penniless to her home.  Praful tries to explain to her father her bad situation and needing his financial help, but in fear of retaliation and hostility she is reluctant. Her parents want her to begin her wedding preparations and plans with Sameer, who by now gets impressed by her personality.  At  a relative's wedding Praful and Sameer meet again and dance, and get to know each other. However, Praful is threatened by the loan sharks to pay within 10 days or face death, so she is disturbed and anxious, unable to concentrate on her wedding plans.  Therefore, Praful develops the habit of stealing whereby first she disguises herself (wearing oversized sunglasses and a hood) and approaches a cashier at a gas station shop. She collects only $10,000 so she has to go and rob a bank (which she learns how to on YouTube), with a disguise, and hands a note written with red lipstick that says money should be given to her otherwise she will blow the whole bank as she is strapped to a bomb.  Praful's second robbery gets foiled by a bank manager who bumps into her when she tries to rob the bank in the similar fashion. When the manager asks her name, Praful tells her name ''''Simran'''', the name of a popular character from an Indian blockbuster film [[Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge]] which her mother ultimately watches often.  Although Praful's plan to rob the bank gets foiled, she manages to escape and robs another bank in the similar manner.  Praful Patel has now become a most wanted criminal with the name '<nowiki/>'''Simran - The Lipstick Bandit''''. Despite robbing 3 to 4 banks successfully, Praful is still short of collecting fifty thousand dollars.  Meanwhile, Praful develops a liking towards Sameer, and confides in him her bad habits of gambling and  stealing which he does not take seriously, thinking it is some kind of a joke. Trouble comes back when loan sharks attack Praful in her hotel for money and Praful's ex-boyfriend Mike - the general manager of the hotel, steals the money from her locker room and refuses to give the money back to her until and unless she submits to his sexual advances/desires.  Praful ultimately hits him and gets suspended from the hotel, after which she tells the loan sharks that her money has been stolen. By now, these loan sharks know that Praful is actually 'Simran - The Lipstick Bandit', so they ask her to rob one more bank and this time with a bigger amount-- for which they offer her a gun to finish the job.  Devastated and dejected, Praful calls off her relationship with Sameer and asks him to leave and by telling him the truth. Enraged by this, Praful's father slaps her and asks her to leave his house.  Praful leaves her home and stays with her best friend Salma for a night. The next day Praful attacks the same bank that rejected her bank loan and flees the place after stealing the money.  Sameer is still in love with Praful and in order to help her, he transfers the huge amount of fifty thousand dollars in her bank account.  Praful, before leaving the city of Atlanta, calls him at a lonely place and tells him that he should find another girl, as he is a nice man and he deserves someone better; not someone like her.  Sameer refuses and asks her to surrender to the police and end this dirty game once and for all; after which Praful's dad calls her and asks for forgiveness. Praful is happy at this and returns home but the police cars have surrounded her and are following her car to arrest her.  Praful drives off because she did not want to get arrested in her neighborhood, which is full of Indians, and her parents would be very ashamed of her there. The ultimate chase begins as Praful's car is found empty by the police. Praful had taken a taxi and was almost near the airport, but then she decides to surrender on a lonely highway. She asks the taxi to stop at the curbside and then she calls 9-1-1 and surrenders herself.  After her arrest, there is a trial whereby the judge adjudicates Praful to be imprisoned for 10 months, but she is released after 3–4 months due to good behavior.  Her ex-boyfriend Mike is also imprisoned for stealing her money and also for his sexual advances (attempted rape/forcing himself on her).  During a meeting session in prison, Praful tells her father that she wants to invest all his money into stock market. Enraged by this, Praful's father becomes angry and grabs her neck angrily, venting his frustration that all his hard-earned money will blow up in smoke due to her crazy intentions.  The film ends with titles suggesting that Praful has been released from jail and she has sold the rights of her own movie to be made to a Bollywood producer for fifty thousand dollars.

Andrew shows superhuman strength and resilience when marauders attack the party, and the morning after the ambush, Calia finds machinery in one of Andrew's wounds. Calia abandons Andrew. The two are then captured and brought to Walsh, who tells them that Andrew, the first in a new generation of machines, was designed to kill any remaining humans. Andrew the machine has his long-dead eponym's memories, which Walsh makes Andrew search for clues about Aurora’s location.

He meets Laura ([[Erich Gonzales]]), a sheltered Youtube vlogger who is picking herself up after a failed relationship, when they are seated beside each other on the plane ride to Siargao. Upon arrival on the island, Laura realizes that she has no means of transportation to her reserved lodgings, and so Diego offers to give her a ride on his friend's Jeep. Along the journey, they get to know each other's backgrounds and scratch the surface of either's purpose for going to Siargao.  In their respective residences, the real reasons for their getaway are revealed: Diego is returning home after experiencing unhappiness and dissatisfaction in Manila as an artist, stemming from his regret over leaving his hometown sweetheart Abi ([[Jasmine Curtis-Smith]]), of whom he has always loved but had never gotten the timing right to be with. Laura, on the other hand, is trying to discover her independence after rejecting the marriage proposal of her ex-boyfriend, Mikey ([[Enchong Dee]]), whom she still loves but is afraid to commit to in marriage. In one of the many heartfelt conversations Laura and Diego participate in, she asks Diego what his favorite flavor of popcorn is, and divulges that she does not know the answer to the question herself, as she had spent all of her time in her relationship trying to mold her interests to mirror Mikey's.  As Diego rekindles his connection with Abi through surfing and Laura continues to film her experiences in Siargao, the two wayward souls find understanding and support in each other's woes. Diego and Abi hash out their still existing feelings for each other, with Abi revealing that even if she loves Diego, she cannot be with him if he wants to return to the city, as she is used to and does not want to leave her simple life in Siargao. Laura watches Mikey's livestream about his and Laura's breakup, tearfully sharing  his willingness to give Laura the world and being turned down, and that Laura has been trying to keep in touch, to no avail, as Mikey does not see the point when it had been her who had left him.   After a conversation between Diego and Laura where they agree that no matter the setbacks, mistakes, and disappointments, they have to keep on living and pushing for those they truly love, Diego holds a public performance for the locals where he dedicates a song to Abi that he wrote about her years prior, while Laura decides that after spending some time in Siargao by herself trying to figure out if she can and deserves to be alone, she ultimately refuses to be and attempts to contact Mikey again, finally reaching him via phone call after weeks of estrangement.  The film ends with Diego, on his way back to Manila, seeing Laura on the plane once again, and deciding to stay permanently in Siargao to pursue a long-desired relationship with Abi.

The Skin of the Wolf
 The film opens with an unspecified year but appears to be in the 1920s. Although based on the rifle Martinón uses, a German [[Karabiner 98k]], its no earlier than 1935. The local towns people do not appear to have all the modern comforts of the era with exception of electricity. The main character Martinon is a huntsman who lives a life of solitude completely without modern day comforts high on a mountain top in an abandoned town. Martinon's life is that of "hard-living". The terrain near Martinon's home is rocky with steep hills, which are surrounded by a dense forest filled with wild life. Martinon's daily routine consists of maintaining the land in front of his house, tending to his goats and hunting for wolves so that he can trade their skins. All this is done through the harsh bitter cold mountain weather. Martinon's physical appearance, tall muscular with shaggy hair and a busy beard, intimidates those he encounters. Occasionally, Martinon will make the two day journey down the mountain to the local town to sell the wolf skins he harvested.  During a visit to the local town, inside a bar Martinon is attempting to sell some newly caught wolf skins to the mayor, who haggles him over the price and authenticity of the skins. Afterwards, Martinon discusses the exchange with the bar owner Severino. Severino suggests to Martinon that he should consider marriage and starting a family to pass on his property as his legacy. Martinon considers the suggestion but points out that the conditions of his life in the mountains are no place for children or a wife. On his way out of town Martinon has sex with a local woman, Pascuala, and considers her to be a suitable wife. Martinon makes a deal with Pascuala's father, Ubaldo. Pascuala leaves town with Martinon as his wife. Pascuala adapts to her new home life with ease, but begins showing signs of an unknown illness through consistent coughing. Pascuala also tells Martinon that she is pregnant. Martinon shows no verbal or facial expressions on how he feels about the pregnancy, but begins to create a baby crib. Pascuala's illness worsens, resulting with a difficult pregnancy. Bedridden Pasculua gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, while Martinon is tending to the goats. Visibly saddened and frustrasted because of the deaths of his wife and son, Martinon breaks the baby crib he created. While attempting to bury their bodies, Martinon burst into a fit of anger and begins knocking  down the headstones on the older surrounding graves of the graveyard. Martinon brings the bodies of his wife and the baby boy to Ubaldo, and accuses him of knowing that Pasculua was sick and  pregnant with someone else's child upon joining him. Ubaldo concedes to the accusations, stating that he was afraid that Pascuala's reputation would  be ruined. He'd hoped that once Pascuala had her baby, people would believe that Martinon was the father, since they were living together. Martinon berates Ubaldo for not being a good father and demands his money back. Ulbaldo begs Martinon for time to collect the money. Martinon gives him until the next spring to pay. When Martinon goes back to Ubaldo to collect his money, rifle in hand, Ubaldo instead of money offers his youngest daughter, Adela, to Martinon. He says Adela will join him, provided that he marry her. Martinon accepts Adela and the next day they are taken to a chapel by the family to be wed. After the wedding, Ubaldo apologizes to Adela for the impromptu marriage. He pleads with Adela not to run away, but instead to attempt to adapt to the situation, because should she run away, Martinon would look for her and come after Ubaldo. He then gives Adela a red cloth, later revealed to contain herbs, telling her to use it should her situation become unbearable. Adela leaves with Martinon on the journey back to the top of the mountain. The walk is strenuous for Adela, causing Martinon to stop repeatedly to give her water. Adela does not adapt to her new home life. Though Adela does not verbally express it, she appears lonely and bored. Adela also finds sex with Martinon painfully unpleasant.  One day Martinon informs Adela that he will be gone for trading for four days. Martinon warns Adela to be careful of the wild life in the forest, should she venture outside the abandoned town. While alone for four days, Adela inspects the ruined buildings of the abandoned town and the near by cemetery, where she notices two open graves. Upon Martinon's return, Adela asks for whom they were meant. Martinon replies that "they're not graves, just holes". This response upsets Adela and she begins to walk away when Martinon tells her that Pascuala's death was her fathers fault because Ubaldo traded Pascuala knowing she was sick and pregnant. Martinon also tells Adela that Ubaldo did the same trade with her. Adela calls Martinon a liar and walks away. Later Martinon observes Adela starring tearfully out into the distance. While looking at herself in the mirror Adela realizes she is pregnant . Though Martinon shows no verbal or facial reaction, he prepares a baby crib and makes breakfast for Adela in the mornings. Martinon also begins to reduce any strenuous activities for Adela. One day while cleaning a wolf skin, Adela becomes frustrated, and resolves to poison Martinon's food with the herbs her father gave her. Martinon unknowingly eats the poisoned foods and soon becomes sick, vomiting daily. Adela appears pleased with herself and decides to run away while Martinon is out hunting. While running down the mountain Adela steps on one of the traps set by Martinon, preventing her from properly running and walking. When Martinon returns home to find Adela gone he immediately searches the ruined buildings of the town. The next morning he follows Adela's tracks and discovers her passed out hiding under some fallen trees. Martinon takes Adela home to nurse her back to good health. While wrapping the unconscious Adela's frost bitten feet Martinon observes Adela having a miscarriage. Adela becomes strong enough to walk around the house. Adela sorrowfully tells Martinon that she lost the baby. Martinon is quiet, as he is already aware. Martinon tells Adela that, once she fully recovers, she can return to her family. Adela asks why and Martinon tells her that "the days are shorter". Adela shows a mix of happiness and remorsefulness  while standing outside alone, and she eventually leaves. Martinon is left alone in his home. He soon discovers Adela's hidden canister of poisonous herbs. Martinon stands outside silently crying to himself while starring out to the distance. The film ends with Martinon in bed looking up at the ceiling alone in his house, as he lays there ill and prepares to die.  
Smurfs: The Lost Village
 In Smurf Village, the Smurfs live peacefully among themselves and their leader is Papa Smurf. Some of the Smurfs include Clumsy Smurf, Brainy Smurf, Hefty Smurf and Smurfette, who was created by [[Gargamel]] from a lump of clay, but redeemed by Papa Smurf and became part of the village. Gargamel makes it his mission to capture the Smurfs, steal all of their essence, and become the most powerful wizard in the world.  After Smurfette accidentally breaks an invention by Brainy, she sees a blue creature hidden by a leaf and follows it straight into the Forbidden Forest, believing the creature to be a Smurf. She loses sight of the creature but discovers a hat was dropped by the possible Smurf. Smurfette ends up being captured by Gargamel and at his castle, she ends up inadvertently revealing the hat, enabling Gargamel to mix up a brew that causes him to locate the village on a map. Soon enough Hefty, Brainy, and Clumsy help Smurfette escape and return to Smurf Village, where Papa Smurf punishes them for disobeying his orders and confines them to their houses while dismissing their claims of a lost village filled with Smurfs.  Smurfette sneaks out into the night to look for the lost village, however, and Brainy, Clumsy, and Hefty volunteer to come with her. Smurfette agrees to let them join her and together the four enter the Forbidden Forest. Gargamel soon discovers them trying to find the lost village and heads out with Azrael and Monty to stop them.  The four follow the map and end up in various adventures, all while encountering bizarre creatures; the four encounter a colony of fire-breathing dragonflies, where Gargamel follows them and tries to have them killed by having the dragonflies attack them. Smurfette, Brainy, Hefty and Clumsy survive, but then end up getting lost in a maze of caverns, where they eventually get out thanks to a stampede of glow-in-the-dark rabbits. The four then head off to a river and sail on a handmade raft along the river to get to the lost village, but then they encounter Gargamel, Azrael, and Monty again. Following a brief chase, Gargamel is thrown out of his own raft, so Hefty and Smurfette convince the others to help save him. They do so, but instead of thanking them, he pushes them out of their raft, leaving them to plunge down a waterfall.  Meanwhile, back at Smurf Village, Papa Smurf tries to reconcile with Smurfette over his actions on the previous night but soon discovers she, Brainy, Hefty, and Clumsy are gone, so he sets out to find them and set things right with them. The four are soon captured by the leaf-covered creature along with a few others who reveal themselves to be female Smurfs. They are taken to Smurfy Grove where they meet Smurf Willow, Smurf Storm, Smurf Blossom, Smurf Lily (the smurf from earlier) and Smurf Melody, who all welcome the Smurfs to their humble home. Smurf Storm and Clumsy head away from the village to locate Gargamel and alert the others. During the trip, Clumsy reveals that Smurfette was created by Gargamel, which causes Smurf Storm to distrust Smurfette. Gargamel, who was led into a piranha-infested swamp, spots Clumsy and Smurf Storm, and has Monty attack them, but they fly away to return to the village.  After a while of showing them what they do, Smurf Storm and Clumsy come back with her telling Smurfette was created by Gargamel. The female Smurfs prepare an attack that night but instead of Gargamel, Papa Smurf appears, and the female Smurfs accept him into their home. Soon, Gargamel comes and destroys Smurfy Grove, capturing all the Smurfs, with the exception of Smurfette, who is now alone, feeling heartbroken for her actions. However, Snappy shows her a picture of her and the others, and realizing she is not a real Smurf, heads back to Gargamel's lair to save the Smurfs.  At Gargamel's lair, Brainy makes a plan to escape. Papa Smurf hears their plan and he and Smurf Willow decide to help them. Hefty, Brainy, Clumsy, and some of the female Smurfs succeed at the plan until Gargamel and Azrael spot them and put some of the female Smurfs and Clumsy into his Smurfilator, a machine capable of extracting their essence. Smurfette appears, tricking Gargamel into believing she wants to be an evil smurf again. When Gargamel tries to turn Smurfette into an evil smurf, he realizes Smurfette is absorbing his magic powers instead. Gargamel, Azrael, and Monty are sent flying back into the piranha-infested lake. The Smurfs are freed but despite their victory, Smurfette has reverted back to a lifeless lump of clay.  Back at Smurf Village, the Smurfs make a memorial for Smurfette. Their energy and love for Smurfette revives her, and everybody happily celebrates. Smurf Village and Smurfy Grove rejoice in their new unity; in the end, Smurfette finally finds her purpose and most of all, a true-blue Smurf.  During the end credits, Gargamel, Azrael, and Monty are walking back to their castle with Gargamel feeling angry in his failure to kill the Smurfs, and complaining the credits in front of them.

They volunteer to investigate the robbery in order to cover up their involvement, clashing with [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] investigators Jennifer Bryant and Doug Dennison, who are suspicious of their involvement. It is also revealed that Vincent is estranged from his wife Dena, who is getting remarried, and has minimal involvement in the life of his 16-year-old son Thomas.  While driving Thomas to his soccer game, Vincent is ambushed by Rubino's men, who stab him in the abdomen and kidnap his son, demanding the stolen cocaine back in exchange for Thomas's life.  Vincent retrieves the cocaine from Cass, places it in a duffel bag and leaves it in the ventilation shaft of one of the bathrooms in Rubino's casino, hoping he can negotiate his son's release before handing over his leverage. He is unknowingly followed by Bryant, who, now convinced he is a dirty cop, retrieves it and hides it in the women's locker room nearby. Upon learning that the drugs were moved, Vincent is forced to present Rubino with bags of sugar to ensure Thomas's safety, but Novak uncovers his ruse and Thomas is recaptured by Rubino's men, while Vincent manages to escape.  Meanwhile, after coming up empty while searching the casino for Downs, Dennison is convinced he's gotten away, and directs Bryant to go home and get some sleep.  Bryant gives him the key to the women's locker with the cocaine, and heads for the exit.  Vincent infiltrates the casino in his police uniform, but crosses paths with Bryant on her way out and chased into one of the hotel rooms.  They fight, and he subdues her before revealing he's been undercover on behalf of Internal Affairs for the last two years to dismantle the crime ring within the police department.  He knows his partner Cass is a drug-runner, knew details about a previous investigation by Bryant, and is now attempting to find the senior member of law enforcement that is covering everything up.  A skeptical Bryant directs him to the locker room to retrieve the cocaine, but the drugs have recently been removed by Dennison. Dennison ambushes Vincent, but is ultimately overpowered and knocked unconscious.  Meanwhile, Thomas escapes and steals Rubino's cellphone to contact Vincent, but is quietly being followed by Rubino and his men who allow it all to happen in an attempt to lure Vincent into a trap. Elsewhere, Dena finds out Vincent and Thomas are in danger and heads to the casino.  Cass arrives and confronts Vincent about his Internal Affairs involvement, but then saves Vincent from one of Novak's men.  He is shot in the process and presumed dead. Going through Cass' phone, Vincent finds out Dennison is the mole in the force, is on Novak's payroll, and informed Cass that Vincent was Internal Affairs and needed to be killed. Bryant and Dennison later find a severely injured Cass in the garage. While Bryant checks the vitals of Novak's man, Dennison privately questions Cass on whether Vincent is aware of his involvement and finishes him off when Cass refuses to answer. Vincent and Thomas reunite just as Novak begins shooting up the casino and escape to the parking garage. Meanwhile, Bryant arrests Rubino.  Vincent and Thomas attempt to escape in a stolen car, but are ambushed by Novak and his men, leading to a violent shootout. Dena arrives and kills one of Novak's men before Novak corners them. He shoots Vincent in the chest, but Vincent survives and fatally shoots Novak. Vincent then contacts Bryant and alerts her of Dennison's corruption. Realizing he's been exposed, Dennison draws his gun, and shoots Bryant and Rubino and forces the police cruiser they're in to crash.  Dennison crawls out of the wreckage claiming Rubino killed Bryant and the driver with a stolen gun before being shot by Dennison, but Bryant has managed to survive and exposes Dennison, who is arrested by the arriving policemen.

After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again.  Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink.  His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace.  Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey.  At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son.  Frustrated with his suspicious behavior, Denton's parents demand explanations. When they disbelieve his lies, Denton angrily accuses them of having no faith in his redemption. Denton encounters Boyd again at a diner, and the two soon begin dating. After Pleasant threatens him and his parents, Denton probes Boyd for a way to access Vassey. When this fails, Pleasant suggests he murder Coakley instead. Denton breaks into Coakley's house but can not bring himself to do it.  Instead, he bribes Toni, a prostitute Coakley has been seeing, into secretly recording him.  Denton sets up a camera in Coakley's hotel room and waits in a nearby room for Coakley to arrive. During Coakley's tryst, Toni's boyfriend, Rooster arrives. Driven by jealousy, Rooster kills Toni and is killed by Coakley in return. Denton witnesses the shooting and waits for Coakley to leave before running into the room to look for the camera. Realizing that Coakley found and took the camera, Denton returns home dejected.  After another argument with his parents, in which his father asks him to leave, an unknown assailant fires several shots into Denton's parents' house, wounding his mother. Denton confesses to Boyd, with whom he has grown closer, that the situation has spiraled out of control. She assures him it will work out, and, unknown to Denton, murders Vassey. Junior catches Boyd in the act. Denton is kidnapped by Junior's thugs and Junior reveals he has tortured and presumably killed Boyd. Denton's protests that he was uninvolved with Vassey's death are interrupted by the arrival of Scotty.  Denton and Scotty kill Junior and his thugs, but Scotty is shot. Denton attempts to save Scotty but stops when he learns that Scotty was the one who shot his mother. Coakley had revealed to Scotty that it was Denton who killed his brother under Junior's orders. Denton leaves Scotty to die and receives a call from Pleasant informing him that Coakley died in a car accident. Coakley had been distracted, watching the recording of his shooting of Rooster while driving.  Denton ransacks his parents' house for dirty money they found and hid from him before kicking him out. After Denton finds the money and indicates his desire to deliver it to his children, Denton's father says he will not allow Denton anywhere near the children, fearing Denton's self-destructive impulses will harm them. When Denton incredulously asks what his father can do to stop him, Denton's father stabs him. In his dying moments, Denton wipes his father's fingerprints off the knife and adds his own, to make the wound appear self-inflicted.

After seeing the carbon tubes in his bones on the results of an X-ray at the hospital, Tulsa tells Gardner she now believes he was born on Mars, but plans to leave him in the hospital, before foster care can come, as he is too sick to continue their journey. Gardner reveals that he knows he won't last on Earth anymore and all he wants is to meet his father before he dies. Tulsa gives in and helps him escape. They steal a car and drive to the beach house. There, they meet the man from the video, who reveals that he is not Sarah Elliot's husband, but her own brother. However, he thinks that the two are lying to him. Gardner runs down to the sea, where he tells Tulsa that this is where he wants to die. He collapses. Tulsa tries frantically to drag him to the shore, but he is too heavy for her.

Eight years later, [[Peter Parker]] is drafted into the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by Stark to help with an internal dispute, but resumes his studies at the [[Midtown High School|Midtown School of Science and Technology]] when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger.  Parker quits his school's [[academic decathlon]] team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, after preventing criminals from robbing an ATM with their advanced weapons from Toomes, Parker returns to his Queens apartment where his best friend Ned discovers his secret identity. On another night, Parker comes across Toomes' associates [[Montana (comics)|Jackson Brice / Shocker]] and [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz]] selling weapons to local criminal [[Prowler (comics)|Aaron Davis]]. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons, and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.  Parker and Ned study a weapon left behind by Brice, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, Parker races to the [[Washington Monument]] where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Parker saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush [[Liz Allan|Liz]]. Returning to New York City, Parker persuades Davis to reveal Toomes' whereabouts. Aboard the [[Staten Island Ferry]], Parker captures Toomes' new buyer [[Mac Gargan]], but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers and takes away the suit as a result of his recklessness.  Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to go to the [[homecoming]] dance with him. On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Toomes is Liz’s father. Deducing Parker's secret identity from Liz's account about him, Toomes threatens retaliation if he interferes with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] to the team's new headquarters, dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair. He is first ambushed by Schultz, but defeats him with the help of Ned. At the lair, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near [[Coney Island]]. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes, and leaving him for the [[New York City Police Department|police]] along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away, and Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time. Stark returns Parker's suit, which he puts on at his apartment just as his [[Aunt May]] walks in.  In a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison. Gargan has heard that Toomes knows Spider-Man's real identity, which Toomes denies.  
Spyder (film)
 Shiva ([[Mahesh Babu]]), an officer in the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau office]], spies on people's calls and messages to help them if needed. He developed a software to listen to the needing ones by tracking their phones. On the night of March 16th, he listens to a lady named Charlie/Shalini ([[Rakul Preet Singh]]) talking about her wish on getting 98% in her exams from 96% to get a USA Scholarship with her friend. In order to do that, she decides to get concentration by knowing a guy. Shiva goes and follows her and Charlie/Shalini starts to fall in love but Shiva does not as his main focus is to help people.  On the night of April 28th, he listens to a young girl asking her friend for help as she is alone in her house and scared because there is no current in her house whilst everyone else on her street does. Shiva sends his friend and new police constable, Renuka, to help the girl. However the next day, a news channel declares that the two are killed. Shiva goes to the site and finds that its been a brutal murder. To know who murdered them, he sets out to 'spy' the girl's chats and whereabouts.  He finds that a guy followed her at a cafe. Through technology, he find someone who knows the guy. He then travels to the village where the guy grew up from, through the person who knew the guy. From a long-living villager, he learns the past about the guy, Bhairavudu/Sudalai ([[S. J. Surya]]). He suffers from [[sadistic personality disorder]] and has an unusual desire to kill people and see the victims' family crying. One day, a village kid sees him killing a person and tells the other villagers. They decide to burn Bhairavudu/Sudalai's house, which his parents died from. Angry, he left the village to continue his killing spree with his younger brother. Shiva manages to catch him but instead he reveals to be Bhairavudu's/Sudalai’s younger brother ([[Bharath (actor)|Bharath]]). Bhairavudu reveals that he killed 23 people and hid their bodies in 23 pillars of a bridge and threatens the whole citizens to leave his brother free. He also reveals that he plans to destroy a hospital. Shiva, though, kills Bharaivadu’s/Sudalai’s brother in front of the 40 people's families, including an angry Bhairavudu/Sudalai.  Bhairavudu/Sudalai plans to kill Shiva's family. Shiva finds out when his mother ([[Dheepa Ramanujam]]) calls him and tells him that she is scared because there is no current in their house whilst everyone else on the street does, exactly the same as what the girl had said earlier. Shiva manages to save his family through his workmates. Then, Bhairavudu/Sudalai tries to kill Shiva on his way home, which Shiva gets stabbed through his body from a rod on a truck. He slowly recovers and gets back on getting Bhairavadu/Sudalai. Because Shiva had shot him before he fell unconscious, he thinks Bhairavudu/Sudalai has hidden himself in a house where he can heal but he has imprisoned the owners. With the help of the local ladies, Shiva finds, catches and arrests Bhairavadu/Sudalai, but Bhairavudu/Sudalai tells him that he had already planned a big rock fall in the city which starts in 20 minutes. Shiva manages to stop the big rock, with the number of cars that were already there and a truck he managed to get in place. Meanwhile, Bhairavudu/Sudalai escapes from the police quarters and continues with his plan on destroying a hospital. Charlie/Shalini finds out which hospital, but refuses to tell Shiva because he was rude to her. Shiva tracks down her taxi and she tells him which hospital it is, and he rushes there and starts evacuating everyone. He saved as many as he could but couldn't save some patients which he feels heartbroken for. Lastly, Shiva finally kills Bhairavudu/Sudalai and tells media that "We have only killed the patient, but not the disease. Helping people you don’t know is the greatest happiness in the world. We shouldn’t use technology all the time, because we don’t have time to spend with others." He also tells them that there are other people who may have the same exact disease. The movie ends with Shiva walking with Charlie/Shalini out of the crowd.  
The Square (2017 film)
 Christian is the [[curator]] of the X-Royal [[art museum]] in [[Stockholm]], formerly the Royal Palace. He is interviewed by the journalist Anne, struggling to explain museum jargon. Later, he is pulled into a confrontation in a pedestrian zone, after which Christian notices that his smartphone and wallet are missing, presumably stolen in a [[confidence trick]]. He is able to track the position of his phone on his computer, which he and his assistant Michael trace to a large apartment block. They write a threatening anonymous letter demanding the return of the phone and wallet by depositing them at a nearby [[7-Eleven]]. Christian throws a copy of the letter in each apartment mailbox at night. Several days later, a package for Christian is actually deposited at the store, containing the phone and the completely untouched wallet.  Euphoric after the success of his plan, Christian goes to a party where he meets Anne again, and ends up in her apartment. After they have sex, Anne offers to throw away his used condom but he steadfastly refuses to hand it over to her. They argue over the situation, as she believes he does not trust her to dispose of the semen rather than take it. Several days later, she meets him in the museum and states she is looking for more than [[casual sex]]. She asks him if he feels the same, but he is evasive. When Anne later tries to call him, he does not pick up the phone.  The day after picking up the package containing his phone and wallet, Christian is informed that a second package has arrived for him at the 7-Eleven. Suspicious, he sends Michael to pick it up. In the store, Michael is confronted by a young boy who states that his parents believe that he is a thief because of the letter and demands that Christian apologize to him and his family. Otherwise, the boy threatens to create "chaos" for Christian.  Later, the boy visits Christian's home and confronts him on the staircase. Christian tries to send him away, but the boy begins to knock on doors and scream for help. After the boy falls down a flight of stairs, Christian hears him calling for help. Disturbed, Christian desperately searches the trash outside the house for a note which contains the boy's phone number. After finding it and unsuccessfully trying to call the boy, Christian records an apologetic video message. [[File:ГОСТ 2.410-68. Квадрат, прямоугольник.svg|200px|thumb|The Square is presented as a simple outline.<ref></ref>]]  In the midst of these troubles, Christian has to manage the promotion of a new exhibition centered on an art piece called "The Square" by Lola Arias, which is described in the [[artist's statement]]: "The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations."  The [[advertising agency]] commissioned by the museum to promote The Square states that they need to harness [[social media]] attention with something other than the uncontroversial and bland artist's statement. Advertising agency representatives consider a depiction of violence contradicting The Square's message, developing a promotional clip showing an impoverished white blond girl entering The Square and being killed in an explosion. The video is published on the museum's website and [[YouTube]] channel after a distracted Christian gives his approval without viewing it. The clip goes [[viral video|viral]], quickly reaching 300,000 YouTube views, but receives an extremely hostile response from the media, religious leaders and the general public. The museum arranges a press conference, where Christian states he violated protocol and is stepping down as curator in mutual agreement with the board. Several journalists then attack him for stirring up cheap controversy with a tasteless clip, while others attack him for [[self-censorship]] because of his resignation.  Feeling guilty about wronging the boy, Christian drives to the apartment block several days later and tries to find him and his family. Christian talks to a neighbor who states that he knew the boy but that his family has moved away.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
  Shortly after the battle of Starkiller Base, General [[Princess Leia|Leia Organa]] leads [[Resistance (Star Wars)|Resistance]] forces to flee D'Qar when a [[First Order (Star Wars)|First Order]] fleet arrives. [[Poe Dameron]] leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought, but after the Resistance escapes to [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]], the First Order tracks them and attacks the Resistance convoy. [[Kylo Ren]], Leia's son, hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence, but his [[TIE fighter]] wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of  their leadership and incapacitating Leia, who survives by using the Force. Disapproving of new leader [[Vice Admiral Holdo]]'s passive strategy, Poe helps [[Finn (Star Wars)|Finn]], [[BB-8]], and mechanic [[Rose Tico]] embark on a secret mission to disable the First Order's tracking device.  Meanwhile, [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] arrives on [[Ahch-To]] with [[Chewbacca]] and [[R2-D2]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' to recruit [[Luke Skywalker]] to the Resistance. Disillusioned by his failure to train Kylo as a [[Jedi]], and under self-imposed exile from [[the Force]],  Luke refuses to help – even after he learns of [[Han Solo]]'s death at Kylo's hands – and believes that the Jedi should become extinct. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo communicate through the Force, puzzling the two enemies. As Rey and Kylo learn about each other, each has future visions of themselves as partners.  R2-D2 persuades Luke to train Rey. After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side of the Force, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that [[Supreme Leader Snoke]] was corrupting him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To without Luke. Luke prepares to burn the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but hesitates. [[Yoda]]'s ghost appears and destroys the temple by summoning a bolt of [[lightning]], claiming Rey has all she needs to learn, and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.  Holdo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions cowardly and risky, Poe leads a mutiny. Finn, Rose, and BB-8 travel to the Canto Bight casino and acquire the help of the hacker [[DJ (Star Wars)|DJ]]. They infiltrate Snoke's ship, where all but BB-8 are captured by [[Captain Phasma]]. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who claims that he facilitated the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats Snoke's guards alongside Rey. Rey believes that Kylo has returned to the light side of the Force, but he instead invites her to rule the galaxy with him, which she refuses. They use the Force to fight for possession of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]]'s lightsaber, which splits in two.  Leia recovers and stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned [[Rebel Alliance]] base on [[Crait]]. DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snoke's fleet at lightspeed; Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Phasma, and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with old speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw the TIE fighters away with the ''Falcon'', while Rose stops Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which subsequently penetrates the Resistance fortress.  Luke appears and confronts the First Order to enable surviving Resistance members to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, to no effect. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes he has been fighting a Force projection of him. Rey uses the Force to help the Resistance escape on the ''Falcon''. Luke, exhausted, dies peacefully on Ahch-To. His death is sensed by Rey and Leia, and Leia tells surviving rebels that the Resistance has all it needs to rise again. At Canto Bight, one of the children who helped Finn and Rose escape grabs a broom with the Force and gazes into space.  
The Star (2017 film)
 In "9 months B.C.", Mary is visited by an angel telling her she will bear the [[Messiah]]. A pygmy jerboa named Abby overhears and tells the other animals as a [[Star of Bethlehem|star]] begins glowing brightly in the night.  Six months later, a young donkey is tired of milling wheat and wishes to join a traveling caravan so that he may feel important. An older donkey helps him escape the miller who owns them and he ends up with an injured ankle at the house of Joseph and Mary who just celebrated their wedding. Mary takes the donkey in and names him Boaz, or Bo, and reveals to Joseph that she is pregnant, with Joseph accepting Mary's situation after praying to God. During this time, Bo and his dove friend Dave, plot to escape despite Mary's kindness, but end up staying three more months.  Meanwhile, the [[Biblical Magi|three wise men]] and their camels, Felix, Cyrus and Deborah, arrive at the home of [[Herod the Great|King Herod]]. The wise men reveal their gifts of [[gold]], [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]], but when they reveal that it is for the "new King", he sends them on their way to meet him, but secretly sends his head soldier and his two dogs, Thaddeus and Rufus, to find and kill the new King.  As Joseph and Mary leave [[Nazareth]] in order to head to [[Bethlehem]], Bo and Dave try another escape, but are confronted by Thaddeus and Rufus, who knew of the home by interrogating Abby. After learning that Joseph and Mary are not home, the soldier and his dogs leave to look for them. Feeling guilty, Bo decides to warn them with Dave joining him. Along the way they meet a friendly sheep named Ruth who left her flock when she saw the star. They catch up to Joseph and Mary in time to warn them, and hide them in a market place where the soldier ties up his dogs. Bo releases the cart Joseph and Mary were using to roll down and cause a chain reaction that knocks the soldier down a well. However, he creates severe damage to the market in the process, and Joseph, unaware of the danger, berates Bo for his actions.  Upset with being rejected, Bo leaves and Dave follows until they arrive at the caravan. While happy to have found it, Bo realizes that he liked being with Mary and tells Dave, who admits that he isn't upset and that he just wants Bo to be happy with his decision. Together, the two return and make up with Ruth, and then convince a frustrated Joseph to talk to Mary. Mary admits that it has been difficult for her and that she is scared of the importance of the baby, and Joseph and she make up when the latter begins having [[Uterine contraction|contractions]]. They arrive at Bethlehem where Joseph can't find an inn for Mary. The miller, who just so happened to be there, kidnaps Bo with Dave and Ruth leaving to rescue him. The wise men arrive as well, but the camels, who are aware of Herod's plot, are left tied to a post.  Bo ends up in a barn where he meets a horse named Leah, a cow named Edith, and a goat named Zach. They reveal that they haven't been able to sleep because the star's bright light has been shining through on their manger. Realizing that this is where the baby is supposed to be, the animals help Bo escape and he catches up with Dave and Ruth while spotting the soldier and his dogs. Bo finds Joseph and Mary and gets them back to the manger while Dave runs into Cyrus, Felix and Deborah and helps them escape. Ruth finds her flock (who had previously refused to follow her), and tries to convince them to help, but gets unexpected help from the angel who informs the shepherds and the sheep that the Savior is coming. Bo manages to fight off Thaddeus and Rufus, but is outdone by the soldier. Suddenly, Ruth and her flock, the camels and Dave arrive and dispatch with them by having them hang from a cliff. The soldier lets his dogs fall, but they are saved by Bo and the soldier himself falls to his death.  All of the animals (who are now joined by Abby, who assumed the danger to be ongoing), shepherds, and three wise men arrive to see [[Jesus|baby Jesus]], and Bo realises that he has been carrying the new King the whole time. Deborah predicts that this event will be remembered around the world for years to come.  During the credits, it is shown that Joseph buys Bo from the miller and Bo helps him and Mary raise Jesus.

Starship Troopers: Traitor of Mars
 After the events of [[Starship Troopers: Invasion|''Invasion'']], Johnny Rico has been demoted to the rank of colonel and relocated to a Martian satellite to train a new batch of troopers. Unfortunately, these are some of the worst low-performing troopers Rico has ever trained. [[Mars]] overall has low support for the war, seeing their planet unaffected by the bug conflict and even suggesting pulling out from the war. Because of their laid back attitude, the denizens of Mars weren't ready when the bugs attacked. Unknown to everyone, Sky Marshall Amy Snapp executes her plans for power.  Snapp hatched her own plans to destroy Mars while gaining popular support for doing it. She was well aware of the bug nest growing under Mars for some time but decided to take advantage of the bug attack to gain social and political support to scuttle the whole planet. She staged a fleet attack run on the Arachnid Quarantine Zone (AQZ) as a massive distraction. While no one notices, she plans to capture General Carl Jenkins, then fabricate a story in which the Federation was too distracted in the AQZ to save Mars and had to detonate a Q-Bomb (planet destroyer) to cleanse the bug threat and Carl will be blamed for the loss of Mars. Unfortunately, for her, nothing went according to plan.  During the bug attack, Rico and his team survived the initial assault and managed to land on Mars surface. While the bulk of the Federation started their attack run on the AQZ, Snapp captured Carl and disrupted all communications between Earth and Mars. However, before he was captured, Carl telepathically reached out to Carmen Ibanez to come back to Mars. Because Carmen and Carl are trusted friends, Carmen redirected her ship back to Mars. Meanwhile, during a bug attack, Rico's troopers were found by a rescue drop ship and everyone made it on board except for Rico. His boosters ran out of fuel and he fell back into the battlefield and was presumed dead from the bug attack. The surviving team flew away not knowing that Rico was still alive but unconscious. When awakened, Rico sees his dead lover, Dizzy Flores, who asked him to help stop the Q-Bomb. Unknown to Rico, Dizzy is a telepathic projection from Carl. While being beaten and drugged by Snapp, Carl managed to telepathically motivate Rico to help stop the Q-Bomb. All was unraveled when Snapp publicly announced the fall of Mars.  When Rico's surviving troopers realized he was not dead, they returned to save him. Once reunited with his squad, he and the team head towards the weather control tower to disarm the Q-Bomb. Once the bomb was disarmed, Rico's troopers started an overload of the tower's systems and make it into one massive explosive device that will destroy the bulk of the bug infestation. It was while Snapp was about to destroy Mars that Rico's squad dismantled the bomb, affecting her approval rating. Now that the FedNet is back online, the public can see Rico and his team attempting to save Mars, shifting public support away from Amy. With the bomb neutralized and the tower overloading, Carmen arrived with a drop ship and rescued Rico's surviving team. As soon as they evacuated, the tower detonated like a nuclear device and wiped out all neighboring bugs.  In the aftermath, Carl broke free from his captors and later returned to power. For his efforts, Rico was reinstated as general and ordered by Carl to cleanse the bug threat in Mars. As for Snapp, Carl had her quietly arrested (her fate is unknown) while Rico arranged for Snapp's secret plot to be released to the public; which destroyed Snapp's popularity and public trust because of her corruption. With his team now seasoned from battle, Rico congratulated them for their hard work and aimed to retake Mars.

Jeff crawls to the apartment door and has a PTSD flashback of the bombing in its entirety.  Jeff meets with Carlos, a man who cared for him in the immediate aftermath of the bombing saving his life. Carlos tells him about his son, a marine who died in Iraq. After attempting suicide Carlos was forced to attend his son's funeral in a stretcher. His younger son, unable to cope with the death of his older brother and the constant state of pain his father was in, killed himself. Carlos confides that saving Jeff helped him make peace with the death of his sons and the blame he placed upon himself because of them. Jeff begins to understand that his will to live in the face of adversity is what both comforts and inspires people. He stops drinking and begins to take his rehab more seriously. He leaves Erin a voicemail apologizing for his behavior finally taking full responsibility for his immaturity and fear of commitment.

Suburbicon
 In 1959, the peaceful, all-white neighborhood of Suburbicon is shaken up by the arrival of an African-American family, the Mayers.  Gardner Lodge, a mild-mannered man, is the father of a family in Suburbicon. One night, the home of the Lodge family is broken into by two robbers. The robbers tie the entire family up and kill the matriarch, Rose, with an overdose of [[chloroform]]. Her twin sister, Margaret, moves in to help take care of Nicky, the son of the family. Soon after her arrival, she begins to transform herself into Rose, dyeing her hair and having sex with Gardner.  As tensions mount between the residents of Suburbicon and their new African-American neighbors, charismatic insurance agent Bud Cooper arrives one day when Gardner is not home and begins asking Margaret questions, looking to clear up red flags in a life insurance claim made on Rose by Gardner shortly after her death. The conversation starts out innocuously enough, but Cooper grows suspicious when Margaret refers to herself and Gardner as a couple, after which Margaret kicks him out of the house.  Meanwhile, the two robbers who killed Rose are angry at Gardner after Nicky sneaks into the viewing room for a police lineup, where Gardner and Margaret denied that the two robbers were the ones who broke into their home. They are also mad that Gardner has not paid them a sum of money they were promised for killing Rose, and grow impatient when they are unable to reach him by phone. They make a plan to return to Gardner's house and kill Nicky and Margaret.  That night, as a prolonged protest at the home of the new African-American residents turns into a small-scale riot, Cooper returns to talk directly to Gardner. He tells Gardner that he knows the nature of his and Margaret's insurance fraud plan and attempts to blackmail them into giving him their entire payout in exchange for his silence. Margaret poisons his coffee with [[lye]], and Gardner stabs him with a fireplace poker to finish him off. Gardner leaves to hide his body, trailed by one of the two robbers.  Margaret attempts to poison Nicky with a sandwich after he eavesdropped on her conversation with Cooper and contacted his Uncle Mitch for help. The increasingly suspicious Nicky does not eat the sandwich and, as Margaret is admitting defeat, one of the robbers strangles her to death before heading upstairs to deal with Nicky, who is saved by the arrival of Mitch. Mitch gives Nicky a gun and hides him in the closet before succumbing to a stab wound given to him by the now-dead robber.  On the way home from disposing of Cooper's body, Gardner is taunted by the other robber, who is suddenly killed by a fire truck. Arriving home, he finds the bodies of Margaret, Mitch, and the robber, and gets Nicky out of the closet. He offers Nicky a choice: go along with his plan to cash out an insurance claim and use the money to run away to [[Aruba]], or be killed by Gardner.  The next morning, Gardner is dead, having eaten Margaret's poisoned sandwich during his conversation with Nicky. Nicky calmly goes outside to play ball with Andy, the son in the African-American family, as they are cleaning up the remnants of the previous night's riot.

 In the middle of the night a strange masked man goes to the kingdom of Trumbeau. There, he makes a huge hole underneath a [[dam]] near the village where everybody is fast asleep and disappears. The next morning Derek, Odette and Chef Ferdinand are going to the village to have a trade agreement meeting. The Trumbeau’s king and his wife were friends of King William, Odette's late father. King William once saved his life and Odette mentioned that her father often had told her about that.  While the meeting is going on, Ferdinand tries to get some new plants; unfortunately they are sold to a man named Count Antonio. Furious, Ferdinand runs to Derek, explaining what happened. They stumble upon the water leaking from the dam and alert the villagers to find higher grounds. Even Count Antonio saves a boy. The water destroys all the houses and the people don't know where to go. Odette and Derek are planning to help by telling the people to give money so they can build new houses and Count Antonio might help. In the evening Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, Alise, Odette, Derek, Lucas and his parents, and all the people reunite together to donate supplies and money.  Lucas's parents, now working as tulip farmers, tell Lucas to go the palace to give Alise some flowers, thanking her for reuniting the family and a new life. When Lucas arrives at the palace, he gives Alise the flowers but runs away, ashamed of their different social status.  The next morning, Count Antonio arrives at the palace with a man named Bruno and his hunting dogs, Kookoo and Cocoa. Uberta sees Count Antonio, and she falls stupidly in love with him which makes Lord Rodgers jealous. Alise overhears a suspicious conversation between Count Antonio and Bruno, and is tasked to keep an eye on him to see what he's up to, along with Rodgers, Lucas, Jean-Bob, Speed and Puffin.  Uberta, still in love, prepares a wedding cake but Count Antonio has other plans, including stealing all the donated money. Lord Rodgers shows Alise and Lucas his secret lair and gives them some spy gears. Jean-Bob, Lord Rodgers, and Speed are to keep an eye on Count Antonio while the children, and secretly with Puffin, will go to Trumbeau - but are actually going to Count Antonio’s kingdom. As they are only children, Bruno and his dogs tagged along. At nightfall, they ran away from the cart but Bruno’s dogs found them. They easily escaped the dogs from using their spy gears.   While the children arrive to the kingdom, they investigate that many ships arrive and depart the port but none to Trumbeau. At the kingdom’s castle, Alise and a disguised Prince Lucas meet an elder King Sebastian. He tells them that Antonio is good and to help him search for a cat named Jasper (the same Cat Number 9 from ''The Swan Princess Christmas'').  Jasper shows Puffin and the children Count Antonio’s real plan – stealing valuables from the people. The children are discovered by his men and are locked in the dungeon. They learn that Niccolo, the king’s aid, is also a part of the scheme. Puffin and Jasper finally find them and give them their spy gears to escape. As they escape, they give back Jasper and receive the sword that once belonged to King William  As they escape to the sewers, Lucas sends Puffin high into the sky to contact Lord Rodgers. Lord Rodgers learns the treasury is empty and informs Odette and Derek about where Lucas and Alise’s whereabouts. Now Uberta realizes that Count Antonio had no feelings for her, and she wants revenge.  Alise and Lucas try to get away but get caught by Bruno but are freed thanks to Jasper. They use Count Antonio’s submarine to escape to his ship to get all the money back to the kingdom. They are discovered by Count Antonio himself and tries to kill them, but Lucas hurts his leg in the process to let Alise escape. Derek and Queen Uberta catch up to Count Antonio.

Super Dark Times
  In 1996 upstate New York, two teenage best friends, Zach (Owen Campbell) and Josh ([[Charlie Tahan]]) rate the girls and female teachers in one of their yearbooks. The pair find a common interest in Allison (Elizabeth Cappuccino).  After school, the duo crosses the path of the universally disliked Daryl (Max Talisman) and his eighth grade friend Charlie (Sawyer Barth). The four of them shop at a convenience store, crack jokes and walk around the outskirts of town. Later that week Zach, Josh and Daryl meet up at Josh’s house. While there, the boys look through Josh's [[Marines|Marine]]-enlisted brother’s possessions, including pictures of girls, a bag of marijuana, a pair of [[nunchaku]] and a [[katana]].  Afterwards the boys excitedly agree to slash milk cartons with the sword in a nearby forest. When it's Charlie’s turn, the boys notice that Daryl has stolen the bag of marijuana from Josh’s brother's room and is smoking it. After a tense argument among the boys, Daryl strikes Josh in the back of the head. The two of them get into a tussle which results in Daryl being accidentally stabbed in the throat with the sword. After a moment of panic the boys decide to hide both Daryl's body and the sword.  During the next two days of school, rumors circulate about Daryl's disappearance and Josh doesn't show up for classes. Zach has a nightmare in which Daryl appears to him and takes revenge. He visits Josh at home and they discuss how the aftermath of Daryl's death has affected both of them. Zach proposes that they return to Daryl's burial site and go to Allison's party. Josh refuses to do either.  Zach has another dream in which he has sex with Allison on Daryl's burial site while Josh silently looks on. The next day Zach learns that Josh has returned to school but was sent to the principal's office for calling his teacher a cunt. That night Zach goes to Allison's party and is surprised to see Josh there. Not only that, Josh has brought his brother's weed and is sharing it with everyone. Zach is disturbed and leaves, but Allison pursues him and they share a kiss.  Another student named John Whitcomb is found dead and rumors speculate that he fell off a bridge. Zach doesn't believe this and starts to think that John jumped or that someone pushed him. He rushes to Daryl's burial site and is shocked to find that the sword and three of the corpse's fingers are missing. He calls Charlie and tells him that he suspects Josh killed John under the pretense of buying some weed off of him. Charlie, unnerved, tells Zach not to call him again and hangs up.  Zach goes to Josh's house but no one opens the door. He breaks in and goes to Josh's room, looking for any evidence that Josh was responsible for John's death or the mutilation of Daryl's body. He discovers Allison's phone number on the caller ID.  Allison is not home and Zach frantically runs to Meghan's house. Josh, Allison and Meghan have been smoking the remainder of the weed. When asked by the girls what Josh has wrapped in the beach towel he's holding, he responds by telling them it's a surprise.  Zach gets to Meghan's house and quietly makes his way up to the stairs. He hears muffled screams coming from Meghan's bedroom and opens the door to find Josh has murdered Meghan with the katana which had been hidden in the beach towel. Allison is tied and gagged in the corner, wounded but still alive.  Josh locks Zach out of the room, but Zach climbs up on the roof and breaks through the window to get back inside. Josh surprise attacks Zach.  Zach tearfully asks what has happened to him. Josh slashes him in the shoulder and then stabs him in the leg. Zach pulls the katana out of his leg and tries to fight Josh off with his fists but Josh begins to strangle him. A neighbor intervenes, separates them, and holds Josh down.  Police and paramedics arrive at the dark and rainy scene. While the paramedics attend to Zach's wounds, Zach is sitting up and conscious and asks if everyone is okay. He glances at Josh sitting in the dark back of a police car and then looks away. The fate of both boys is left ambiguous.  Months later, Allison has recovered from her ordeal and returns to school. A shot from the back reveals the scars she received from the sword: three parallel lines on the back of her neck.

Table 19
 Eloise McGarry attends the wedding of her oldest friend Francie Millner. It's discovered that she was originally maid of honor but "dropped out" two months ago after her ex boyfriend Teddy, the bride's brother and the best man, broke up with her by text after two years together. Teddy is now back with his old girlfriend Nikki, who has replaced Eloise as maid of honor. At the reception, Eloise discovers she has been seated at Table 19. While she considers leaving early, she meets a man named Huck who notices her looking distressed and offers words of advice which are not well received.  Eloise decides to stay and meets her table mates: Jerry and Bina Kepp, Facebook friends with the groom's father who own a chain of diners; high-schooler Renzo Eckberg, whose parents are acquaintances of the groom and who came to the wedding in the hopes of meeting a girl; Jo Flanagan, Francie's childhood nanny; and Walter Thimble, the bride's cousin who is currently on parole. The table debates whether table 19 is a "good table," to which Eloise responds that before getting dumped she planned half the wedding and knows for a fact that table 19 is for "guests that should have known not to show up."  As the newlyweds come in the reception hall and start dancing, Eloise starts feeling insecure and accepts a dance from Huck, whom she kisses.  He declines to sit down with her and she realizes he is crashing the wedding and that "Huck" isn't his real name.  Although the six initially have difficulty finding anything to talk about, they swiftly band together when Jo realizes that Eloise is pregnant. The table confronts Teddy about dumping Eloise after she told him about the baby, and he reveals he dumped her because she said they would be ridiculous parents and he was tired of disappointing her. During this confrontation the wedding cake is destroyed as Eloise backs into it, knocking it onto Teddy. Bitter at this development and feeling unappreciated at the wedding, the Table 19 denizens quickly conceal the cake mishap, and go to Jo's room to smoke pot and converse about their reasons for attending the wedding. Walter reveals he went to prison for stealing $125,000 from the father of the bride, but only did so because he was conned into taking it by his former friend. Renzo tells the group that the wedding is the same night as his junior prom, but his mom encouraged him to come to the wedding instead as he would "probably have a better chance of meeting someone." Jo believes that the children she has cared for have now completely forgotten about her. Going out for a walk, Jerry offers Renzo some advice about how to pick up girls, while Eloise realizes that Jo has cancer. Jo admits that she is probably 'due' the same time Eloise will give birth. Eloise says she thinks she's having a girl and Jo asks that she not name her "Jo" as it's a tough name for a girl. Bina and Jerry fight and she tells him the reason she came to the wedding was to have an affair with an old flame, who has not shown up. They fight about their marriage, and Bina heads back inside with Walter.  On Jo's recommendation, the six attempt to find the wedding crasher that Eloise had encountered earlier, with the aid of the wedding photographer and the hotel reception staff. They learn that "Huck" is actually the groom from another wedding. As payback, Walter steals Huck's wedding cake to replace the one they destroyed earlier.  Returning to the wedding, Table 19 is visited by the bride and groom, who express genuine happiness that everyone there has attended. Francie and Eloise talk briefly, and Francie apologizes that Eloise was seated so far away from her for the reception, and Eloise decides to leave early. Francie then assures Jo that she has not forgotten her, telling a brief but touching childhood story about Teddy, inspiring the table to see him in a new light. The rest of the table tracks down Eloise and encourages her to tell him how she really feels. As the core wedding party leaves the hotel on a ferry, she shouts out an apology to him from the dock, but he's unable to hear.  Eloise, Walter, Jo, and Renzo return to the wedding hall for the last of the cake. In their room, the Kepps discuss their fragile marriage and reconcile before joining the others.  The mood significantly changes when Teddy suddenly appears, dripping wet from apparently jumping off the boat and swimming to shore, and asks Eloise to repeat what she was trying to yell to him. Eloise asks that they both continue to be willing to forgive each other and they reconcile.  Renzo asks the band to play them another song to which everybody dances, including Teddy.  A few months later, Jo has died of cancer and the Kepps are now happy and taking care of her dog. Renzo has a new girlfriend, and Walter refers to the other Table 19 guests as his family. Eloise and Teddy are together and have a son, who they have named Joe. The movie ends with Eloise and Teddy mailing birth announcements to their friends and family, including all the guests from Table 19.  
T2 Trainspotting
 Twenty years after stealing £16,000 in drug money from his three friends and making a new life in [[Amsterdam]], 46-year old Mark Renton returns home to Edinburgh after having a heart attack in a gym. While he has been clean from heroin for 20 years, his life has not otherwise improved; his marriage has failed and he is about to lose his job. Daniel "Spud" Murphy has returned to heroin addiction after having lost everything including his wife, Gail, and visitation with his teenage son, Fergus, whom he fathered shortly after Renton left. Simon "Sick Boy" Williamson now abuses cocaine, runs a failing pub, and engages in blackmail and filming schemes with his Bulgarian girlfriend, Veronika. Meanwhile, Francis "Franco" Begbie is serving a 25-year prison sentence after being arrested for the drug deal in '96 and a robbery, and viciously assaults his lawyer after being denied parole.  Renton, who has rented a hotel room, stops by his childhood home, where his father tells him about his mother's death, and they reconcile. He goes to Spud's apartment just in time to save him from a suicide attempt. Spud initially resents the intervention, but Renton offers to help him out of his addiction. Renton visits Simon at the pub, where Simon attacks him. Afterward, Renton meets Veronika and pays Simon back his original share of the money. Simon informs Veronika that he is going to string Renton along and make him pay for his betrayal.  Meanwhile, Begbie has an inmate stab him in order to land him in the hospital. He assaults a doctor and takes his clothing in order to escape. He visits his former girlfriend and meets his college-bound son, Frank Jr. Staying in the apartment, he resorts to a lucrative burglary scheme into which he drags Frank Jr., selling the merchandise to a local fence, Mikey Forrester. Begbie also visits Simon in his pub, where Simon promises to provide him with a false passport to Amsterdam in order to exact his revenge on Renton.  Renton, Simon, and Veronika become partners in crime, robbing a Protestant social club and using the proceeds to renovate the upper floor of Simon's pub into a [[brothel]]. They fraudulently apply for an EU business-development grant. Veronika and Renton begin an affair, while Spud also joins in the renovation, befriends Veronika, and takes pleasure in renovating the pub. Inspired by Veronika, he decides to write his memoirs. One of Simon's blackmail targets reports him to the police, and Renton seeks legal advice from his former girlfriend, Diane, now a high-priced [[solicitor]]. The proceeds of their crimes are used up in legal fees and Simon's cocaine habit.   One night, Renton and Simon decide to go to a nightclub and snort cocaine while listening to [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Incidentally, Begbie, who was hanging out at his fence's place, takes a large dose of [[Amphetamine|speed]] and [[Viagra]] and decides to go out. By chance, Begbie and Renton end up in adjoining bathroom stalls of the nightclub, and they recognise their voices while inside. Renton flees to a parking garage, where he is able to escape from Begbie, but not before Begbie slashes his arm with a knife.  Doyle, the owner of a rival brothel, intimidates Renton and Simon into abandoning their business (and forces them to walk home to Edinburgh naked), but then they receive the £100,000 grant.  Veronika, tired of Simon and Renton's petty schemes, visits Spud and asks him to leave with her, promising him half of the £100,000. He says he will only buy heroin, so she offers to give his share to Gail and Fergus. He helps her steal the money by forging Renton's and Simon's signatures. Later on, Begbie visits the terrified Spud, reading his memoirs and mocking his continuous addiction. Veronika arrives and Begbie intimidates her, but lets them go in exchange for Veronika's phone, which he uses to text Renton to have him come to the pub at midnight. Begbie visits his girlfriend's place for the last time, apologising to Frank Jr. for his behaviour and telling him to be a better man than he is, before departing.  At the pub, Spud arrives too late to warn Renton and Simon of Begbie's trap. Begbie knocks Simon down and chases Renton across the pub. Begbie throws him through the floor, and Renton's neck gets caught in electrical wiring that begins to slowly strangle him. Begbie tries to pull down Renton to strangle him, but Simon doses him with pepper spray and saves Renton by pulling him over to the floor. Begbie pulls out a sawn-off shotgun and tries to kill them both, but Spud knocks him out with a toilet bowl.  They leave Begbie trapped in the boot of Simon's car, at the door of the prison from which he'd escaped. Veronika returns to Bulgaria, and her young son, leaving Spud half of the money. Spud channels his addiction into his writing, and begins mending his relationship with Gail and Fergus, to whom he left his share of the money. It is implied that Spud writes a book entitled Trainspotting from his writings. Renton and Simon resume their old friendship. Renton moves back into his father’s home and embraces him before going into his bedroom and dancing to a remix of "[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]".  
Sword Art Online The Movie: Ordinal Scale
 In the year 2026, the Augma is released to the public as an alternative system to the AmuSphere, due to its function to [[augmented reality|simulate reality]] while the player is conscious rather than using [[virtual reality|FullDive]]. The most prominent combat-based game is Ordinal Scale, in which a player's abilities are ranked by [[ordinal number]]s.  Asuna, Lisbeth and Silica encourage Kirito to play OS upon hearing that Aincrad bosses have appeared. Kirito joins Asuna and Klein in a boss fight where the game's mascot, AI idol singer Yuna, appears and gives players buff effects as she sings. Kirito fails to achieve anything due to lack of physical strength and quickness. Eiji, the number-two player, aides the group in defeating the boss. Before Asuna makes the killing blow, Eiji whispers the word "Switch," a game mechanic from SAO that she recognizes.  The next night, Asuna joins Klein and his group for another boss fight while waiting for their last group member, unaware that he was injured by Eiji the night before. Asuna proceeds to the fight which is again presided over by Yuna. Klein and his group are ambushed and defeated by the sudden appearance of another boss and Eiji. The following morning, as Kirito practices with OS in a park, a girl in a white hood appears and points off into the distance before disappearing. Kirito meets with Asuna, who theorizes that Eiji was a member of the Knights of the Blood Oath named Nautilus, while Yui deduces that the spawn locations of the Aincrad bosses line up with the SAO dungeon maps.  Asuna, Lisbeth and Silica enter another fight where Yuna and Eiji appear again. Asuna is hit by the boss and passes out upon saving Silica who was pushed into the boss' path by Eiji. Asuna realizes her memories of SAO are fading and at a hospital visit with Kirito, learn that the Augma scanned her brain for SAO memories and that it could also happen to other SAO survivors playing OS. Kirito investigates the issue with Sinon during a boss battle, where an SAO player is defeated and a glowing orb floats upward into an OS drone. Yui fails to retrieve it after being locked out by the game. Later, Kirito meets the hooded girl again who repeats her actions from before. Kirito and Yui discover she is pointing towards Touto Technical University.  Kirito goes to the school and meets Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura who developed Augma, but Shigemura refuses to answer any questions. Before leaving, Kirito notices on Shigemura's desk a picture of a girl who resembles Yuna. Kirito discusses with Kikuoka Seijirou, who informs him that Shigemura's daughter, Yuna, died in SAO. Visiting Asuna's home, Kirito promises Asuna to get her memories back. Kirito encounters the hooded girl again, revealed to be Yuna. When she tells him his rank is too low, Kirito decides to level up, solo-killing as many bosses as he can with aid from Sinon and Leafa.  Days later, the OS players gather at a stadium for Yuna's concert. In the lower levels, Kirito duels with Eiji who claims he has a way to return Asuna's memories. Kirito wins but Eiji reveals that Shigemura has been harvesting memories of SAO players in an attempt to reconstruct his lost daughter's soul and download her as an AI; having all players in the concert would make removing memories easier. Eiji adds that the drones used for harvesting possess enough power to damage the players' brains, killing them like the NerveGear did in SAO.  As a horde of Aincrad bosses raid the arena, Kirito and Yuna join the battle. Yuna tells Kirito that the Augma has a hidden full-dive feature and he can use it to defeat SAO's 100th floor boss to end the battle. Before diving, Kirito gives Asuna an engagement ring. Entering the Ruby Palace of Floor 100, Kirito, Lisbeth, Silica, Agil, and Sinon confront the boss. They are easily defeated until Asuna, Leafa, Klein, and several others from ALO and GGO come to their aid. Yui restores their saved abilities from SAO, allowing everyone to defeat the boss. The voice of Akihiko Kayaba congratulates them on their victory and gives Kirito an extremely powerful sword as a reward.  The group returns to the arena still in full-dive where Kirito, now OS's top-ranked player, dispatches the bosses with his new sword as Kikuoka finds Shigemura in the server room of Argus (the defunct company that ran SAO) and arrests him. The hooded Yuna restores the survivors' memories and fades out of existence since she was coded from the Floor 100 boss. Afterwards, Kirito and Asuna fulfill their promise they made to each other in Aincrad, to watch a meteor shower together. Asuna returns Kirito's engagement ring so to properly put it on her hand, which he does.  In a post-credits scene, Kikuoka, who was impressed with Shigemura's attempt at AI and soul reconstruction, recruits Shigemura to Rath.

At the end of the ride back to the city, Anna happily thanks him for the experience and offers to invest in his business. Stunned, Ray can only mumble a response.

Confused, the trio return to their hotel.  Later that night, Chris and James visit a club, where Chris sees James kiss and dance with other women.  Upon leaving the club, Chris returns to the bookstore, where he comes upon a young boy, Seita, who claims to work there.  After Seita sells him the folklore book, Chris experiences several strange encounters, feeling that something is stalking him.  At a bar, a man tells him that the temple depicted in the book is nearby but is rumored to be haunted, and the bartender gives him directions to a village near the temple.  Though they warn him to stay away, Chris presents the book to Kate, who becomes excited to visit it; James is less enthused.  They at first have trouble finding a villager that will talk to them, but one tells them of a man named Hitoshi, who returned from a trip to the temple blind and claiming to have had visions.  The trio at first laugh off the stories.  Chris gets them a room at an inn, where he comes upon Seita again.  Seita, who says he lives in the village, offers to take them to the temple the next day.  After agreeing, Chris sees an eyeless man; he identifies himself as Hitoshi and reveals that 50 years ago, several children went missing.  The villagers found a monk at the temple, and, not believing his story, killed him.  That night, Chris watches Kate and James as they have sex until he becomes convinced he has seen someone outside his room.

Along the way, they find an abandoned mine, which James wants to explore.  He reluctantly leaves it so they can reach the temple before dark.  Seita leaves for home shortly after they arrive.  The temple is guarded by the statue of a [[kitsune]], a legendary fox-human hybrid.  James is disappointed in the temple but agrees to let Kate explore it.  After being spooked by something in the forest while examining a nearby graveyard, she agrees they should leave.  Before they can, hands pull Chris through a wooden floor, and he breaks his leg.  James makes a splint and promises to return to town for help in the morning.  However, when James overhears a conversation between Chris and Kate in which she alludes to having had an abortion without telling James, he leaves immediately.  Chris and Kate cuddle together until Kate hears James cry out in the distance.  A kitsune chases after James.  Following his cries, Kate returns to the mine, only to find him disfigured and eyeless.  When she flees, she discovers the mine's entrance has collapsed, trapping her.  At the same time, the missing children attack Chris at the temple.  In the present, the bandaged man, whom the professor believes to be Chris, denies having killed Kate and James, despite evidence from Chris' camera, which apparently shows him attacking James.

Thor: Ragnarok
  Two years after the battle of Sokovia, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] is imprisoned by the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] in [[Muspelheim]]. Surtur reveals that Thor's father [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] is no longer on [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]], and that the realm will soon be destroyed in the prophesied [[Ragnarök]], once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. Thor frees himself and defeats Surtur and takes his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök.  Thor returns to Asgard to find [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] gone  and his brother [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] posing as Odin. After exposing Loki, Thor forces him to help find their father, and with directions from [[Stephen Strange]] on Earth, they locate Odin in [[Norway]]. Odin explains that he is dying and  Ragnarök is imminent despite Thor’s efforts to prevent it. He then reveals his passing will allow his firstborn child, [[Hela (comics)|Hela]], to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela was the leader of Asgard's armies, conquering the [[Nine worlds|Nine Realms]] with Odin, but Odin imprisoned her and wrote her out of history after he feared that she had become too ambitious and powerful. Odin then dies and Hela appears, destroying Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. She pursues Thor and Loki as they attempt to flee through the [[Bifröst|Bifröst Bridge]], forcing them out into space. Hela arrives in Asgard, defeating its army and killing the [[Warriors Three]]. She then resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]], and appoints the Asgardian [[Executioner (comics)#Skurge|Skurge]] as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but Heimdall takes the sword that controls the Bridge and begins hiding other Asgardians.  Thor crash-lands on [[Sakaar]], a garbage planet surrounded by [[wormhole]]s. A slave trader designated [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Scrapper 142]] subdues him with an obedience disk and sells him as a [[gladiator]] to Sakaar's ruler, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], with whom Loki has already ingratiated himself. Thor recognizes 142 as one of the [[Valkyrior]], a legendary force of female warriors who were killed fighting Hela long ago. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]], facing his old friend [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither is willing. He soon manages to escape the palace and finds the [[Quinjet]] that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of [[Natasha Romanoff]] makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia.  The Grandmaster orders 142 and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, but the pair come to blows and Loki forces her to relive the deaths of her fellow Valkyrior at the hands of Hela. Deciding to help Thor, she takes Loki captive. Unwilling to be left behind, Loki provides the group with the means to steal one of the Grandmaster's ships. They then liberate the other gladiators who, led by [[Korg (comics)|Korg]] and [[Miek]], stage a revolution. Loki attempts to again betray his brother to the Grandmaster, but Thor anticipates this and leaves him behind, where Korg and the gladiators soon find him. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces are attacking Heimdall and the remaining Asgardians in pursuit of the sword that controls the Bifröst. Banner becomes Hulk again, defeating Fenris, while Thor and 142 battle Hela and her warriors. Loki and the gladiators arrive to rescue the citizens. A repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to enable their escape. Thor, facing Hela, loses his right eye and then has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnarök can stop her. He sends Loki to retrieve Surtur's crown and place it in the Eternal Flame. Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, seemingly killing Hela.  Aboard the Grandmaster's spaceship, Thor, now king, decides to take his people to Earth. In a [[mid-credits scene]], they are intercepted by a large spacecraft.

Some time later, Amanda arrives at the home of the more popular and academically-inclined Lily ([[Anya Taylor-Joy]]). The girls had previously been best friends but grew apart after the death of Lily's father. They meet under the pretense of hanging out and having a casual tutoring session, but Amanda knows that her mother ([[Kaili Vernoff]]) has paid Lily to socialize with Amanda. Lily denies being paid, but Amanda, left emotionless by an unspecified mental disorder, is unfazed. Lily meets with Amanda again, this time voluntarily, and they rekindle their friendship.  Lily lives with her mother ([[Francie Swift]]) and stepfather Mark ([[Paul Sparks]]), a wealthy but abrasive man whom she hates. One night, Amanda asks if Lily ever thought about killing Mark, upsetting Lily. However, tensions flare between Lily and Mark when Mark enrolls Lily in a boarding school for girls with behavioral issues. After seeing him berate her mother, Lily reconsiders and calls Amanda about the notion of killing him. She proposes that Amanda perform the murder as she would be free of guilt while doing it. However, Amanda believes that her pending animal cruelty trial would make her an immediate suspect, and they decide instead to blackmail drug dealer Tim ([[Anton Yelchin]]) into murdering Mark while both of them are out of town. The night of the planned murder, Tim arrives on the property but leaves without killing Mark. The girls agree not to contact Tim again, as his own criminal history will prevent him from alerting the police. Lily impulsively prepares to kill Mark herself but is talked out of it by Amanda.  One night, Lily and Amanda are watching a film at home when Lily reveals that she has spiked Amanda's drink with [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]], planning to stab Mark to death and frame Amanda. Lily attempts to back out of the planned murder, but Amanda willingly finishes the drink.

Following Mark's death, Lily has once again found academic success and is interviewing for college admission. She mentions a letter from Amanda, who has been institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital for Mark's murder.

A sudden lightning strike kills him and his son. His wife ([[Simran]]), Mrs Dhivakar and his daughter watch in horror, as they are burnt to death. At a movie theatre, a man gropes a woman and a small commotion ensues, which was stopped by an ACP Paul Dhanarajan, who later dies in the middle of a police conference. The movie shifts to Detective Kaniyan Poongundran ([[Vishal (actor)|Vishal]]), who lives with his friend and colleague, Manohar ([[Prasanna]]) is furious that he does not have a case worthy of his mettle. Later, Kaniyan and Manohar come across Mallika ([[Anu Emmanuel]]), who is forced into pick-pocketing by her uncle ([[Ravi Mariya]]), who is an alcoholic. Kaniyan intimidates her uncle, causing him to reform all of a sudden and offers her a job.  One day a small schoolboy, Naveen visits Kaniyan and Manohar with a case that his pet dog Nemo, a Pomeranian, was shot dead and asks him to find out the killer. He gives him the bullet collected from the dog's body. With his investigation and the help of a friend, who works in the sciences section of the police department and had asked Kaniyan's help on a previous case, he finds out that it is a 9mm bullet and had been ricocheted from the dog. At the crime scene, he finds a tooth, with which he collects information about it from a dental hospital and tracks its owner as Swarnavel ([[Ashvatt]]), who formerly was a physics professor in an university and had divorced his wife before two years, for he blamed  her for the death of their son and is presently living alone and working as a stockbroker. Meanwhile, a man named Kamalesh ([[John Vijay]]) visits a travel agency to deliver a sofa stashed with money. He delivers it to a group of five members who run the travel agency, Devil ([[Vinay Rai]]), Muthu ([[Bhagyaraj]]), Pritha ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]), a stout man (Dheeraj Rathnam) and a bald-headed man (Siddhanth Venkatesh), who are all believed to be assassins.  Manohar goes in search of Swarnavel to his apartment but finds it locked. He gets chased by some men who were hired by the group. Kaniyan fights them all single handed. At night, Kaniyan and Manohar searched the house for evidence. They observe that someone has already removed a book about lightning from the table. Kaniyan recollects a news article about an incident that involves the deaths of Dhivakar and his son and rushes to Mrs Dhivakar's house, to inquire about it. She reveals that a thunder occurred in the beginning, followed by lightning, which struck Dhivakar and their son. Kaniyan finds out that Swarnavel was present in a nearby construction site on the date of the incident. He concludes that it was an artificial lightning devised by Swarnavel to kill Dhivakar, as lightning travels faster than sound so the thunder could not have been heard first. When the assassins learn that Kaniyan is on their tail, Devil disposes off Swarnavel's body using a [[Chain-Saw]], who was killed earlier when he, ridden with guilt, proposed to surrender.  Later, Kaniyan and Manohar visits Dhivakar's office and learns that a tender, which was to be awarded to Dhivakar, is now with Ram Prasad ([[Jayaprakash]]), the chairman and head of the company Dhivakar competed with. Before they could reach him, Ram Prasad is assassinated by the gang, who were trying to save themselves and are employed by him to kill Dhivakar. Infuriated that their client, Ram Prasad had to be killed, Kamalesh hires some [[China|Chinese]] mercenaries to kill Kaniyan in a Chinese restaurant. He manages to survive by defeating all of them in a fight using his [[martial art]] skills and track them back down to Kamalesh. Before he could reach Kamalesh, Kamalesh is killed by Pritha and made it look like a heavy dosage of [[Sildenafil|Viagra]]. A chase ensues between Kaniyan, Pritha and the bald-headed man. Surrounded by Kaniyan and the police force, the bald-headed man kills himself by performing [[seppuku]] while Pritha escapes amidst the commotion. The next day in a shopping mall, Pritha makes a failed attempt to kill Kaniyan, who is saved by Mallika.  Kaniyan and Manohar meet [[Police Inspector]] Madhivanan and the current ACP, Vijayakumar ([[Shaji Chen]]) in a hotel, where yet another failed assassin attempt is made. Muthu plans to inject Kaniyan with a poison dart, but Manohar was caught in the cross-fire. He is rushed to the hospital and Kaniyan reveals that Paul was also killed by this similar move. They raid the travel agency using the address from the bank card used in the theatre. Devil kills Muthu at his home, knowing the police are on his trail. They find some physics books related to lightning and a machine that emits lighting artificially.  Later that day, Kaniyan receives an [[SMS]] threat that his beloved ones are in danger. He ensures Manohar is safe in the hospital, but could not save Mallika. She was brutally stabbed in her abdomen. Before dying, she gives Devil's cell phone to Kaniyan. It is later revealed that Madhivanan ([[Abhishek Shankar]]) was an informer for Devil.  Kaniyan, Manohar and a team of police personnel go in search of Devil to a mangrove forest. All of them die except Kaniyan, Manohar and ACP. Later Kaniyan and ACP are caught by the Devil, as he blackmails them with Naveen who initiated this case. Tied by a rope, Kaniyan reveals the whereabouts of Devil and lets him know, the police are already informed of this. Dejected by this, Devil tries to stab Kaniyan but Manohar manages to untie him. Eventually, Kaniyan stabs the Devil multiple times. In his dying moments, Devil tells Naveen he is sorry for killing his dog. Later as Naveen returns home from school, he finds a Pomeranian puppy along with a note bearing Kaniyan's name, in a basket at his doorstep.

Keshav ([[Akshay Kumar]]) has to marry a black buffalo because his father (Panditji) is a very religious and superstitious priest, and he believes that his son's marriage to a black buffalo will help improve Keshav's fortune.  Keshav meets Jaya ([[Bhumi Pednekar]]), falls in love with her and eventually convinces her to marry him. However, Keshav's father is of the view that Keshav's horoscope is such that he can and should only marry a girl who has two thumbs on her left hand. Since Jaya does not fulfil this requirement, Keshav has an artificial thumb made and gives it to Jaya who wears it as a ring on her thumb. Keshav's unsuspecting father agrees to their marriage.  On her first morning in Keshav's house, Jaya reluctantly goes to a field to defecate, but comes back agitated without defecating and complains about it to Keshav. Despite Keshav's repeated attempts to convince Jaya to give up her stubbornness about needing a toilet, Jaya remains steadfast. He makes a couple of temporary adjustments to solve the problem, first taking her to a neighbour's house who has a portable toilet for a bedridden elderly woman, and later in a train that has a 10-minute stop at the village railway station, without actually constructing a toilet in his house, but after a while, Jaya gets frustrated and leaves him to live at her parents' house.  After a futile attempt to convince his [[sarpanch]] and villagers to build toilets in the village, Keshav, with the help of Jaya, contacts the concerned regulatory authority, and starts the construction of a toilet in his front yard. When the construction is finished, Keshav's father and the sarpanch arrange to demolish the toilet while Keshav is still asleep. But Keshav wakes up before the toilet is completely destroyed and protects it from complete demolition.

On the day of the hearing of the divorce case of Keshav and Jaya, the judge gets an official notice from the Chief Minister's office urging the judge to not grant their divorce as the construction of toilets in their village shall be started the very next day.

Charlie returns home with the Golden Ticket and chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone. The next day, Tom and Jerry rush to the factory with the Golden Ticket that Grandpa Joe forgot. Once the children enter the factory, the movie plays in the same order of the source material with the occasional interjection of Tom and Jerry interacting with the factory.  Once only Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain, Wonka dismisses them without the promised chocolate. Tuffy warns Charlie that Slugworth and Spike have stolen a Gobstopper and are on their way out of the factory. Following a fight in the Wonkavision Room, Charlie stops Slugworth. After this, Charlie and Grandpa Joe confront Wonka on the end of the tour. Wonka explains that they violated the contract by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks and allowing Tom and Jerry into the factory and therefore will receive nothing. Grandpa Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper, but Charlie returns the candy to Wonka. Because of this, Wonka declares Charlie the winner. He reveals that Slugworth is really "Mr. Wilkinson", an employee of his, and the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test which only Charlie passed. The trio and Tuffy enter the "Wonkavator", a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the factory. Tom and Jerry shrink Wilkinson and Spike for the troubles they put them through the film and use Fizzy Lifting Drinks to catch up with the others. Soaring over the city, Wonka reveals that his actual prize is the factory; Wonka created the contest to find a worthy heir and Charlie and his family can immediately move in, including Tom and Jerry.

Transformers: The Last Knight
  In 484 AD, [[King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table|knights]] fight a losing battle against the [[Saxons]]. Elsewhere, [[Merlin]] approaches the Knights of Iacon, a group of Transformers hiding on [[Earth]], to help win the war. They hand him an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[wand|staff]], before transforming together into Dragonstorm and turn the tide of the battle, but warn Merlin that a great evil will come for the staff.  In the present, a year after the Hong Kong Uprising, [[Optimus Prime]] crash-lands on [[Cybertron]], and meets his alleged creator [[Quintessons|Quintessa]]. She blames Optimus for Cybertron's destruction and brainwashes him into helping to gain Merlin's staff, which can absorb Earth’s energy to restore Cybertron. Optimus is renamed Nemesis Prime. Earth is revealed to be the slumbering [[Unicron]], the ancient enemy of Cybertron, and whose horns are emerging across the planet.  On Earth, Transformers remain unwelcome amongst humanity, apart from in [[Cuba]], and are hunted by the Transformers Reaction Force (TRF), a paramilitary force manufactured from the fallen Cemetery Wind. However, the U.S. military, particularly those who had formerly worked with the Transformers, such as Colonel William Lennox, is secretly against the new policy. Cade Yeager, an ally to the Autobots, helps hide refugee Transformers from the TRF in his remote junkyard. In the war-torn [[Chicago]], Cade, Bumblebee, young scavenger Izabella and her Transformer companions Sqweeks and Canopy help a group of children evade the TRF drones, but Canopy is killed. Cade receives a mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot knight and has a brief standoff with the TRF, before being saved by Lennox. Cade returns to his junkyard with Izabella and Sqweeks with the talisman. Both [[Megatron]], still in his KSI-made drone body [[Galvatron]], and the American government become aware of the talisman’s value and power, reluctantly joining forces to obtain it. A group of Decepticon prisoners  are released to aid in the mission.  The Decepticons and the TRF locate Cade's hideout thanks to a tracker previously planted on Bumblebee. Cade, his assistant Jimmy, Izabella, and Sqweeks flee from the Decepticons and the TRF to an abandoned town where the Autobots ambush their enemies and defeat them while Cade, Jimmy, and Izabella battle a unit of TRF drones. Cogman, a [[steampunk]] Transformer, appears and invites Cade to the [[United Kingdom]] and meet his employer, Sir Edmund Burton, who has connections to the Transformers. Burton also has another Transformer associate named Hot Rod find Viviane Wembley, a [[University of Oxford]] professor, and bring her to him.   Bringing Cade, Viviane, and Bumblebee together, Burton explains that Transformers have been aiding mankind in war for centuries, their existence hidden by a [[secret society]] of famed historical figures, the Order of Witwiccans, of which he is the last living member. The talisman can lead to Merlin’s staff, buried with him in a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden under the sea. However, only a direct descendant of Merlin can wield it due to the knights encoding his [[DNA]] into it. Viviane is revealed as the last of Merlin's bloodline. The TRF and local authorities discover them, forcing them to flee. Following a series of clues while evading their pursuers, the group head to the Royal Navy Museum. There, Cade, Viviane, Bumblebee, and Cogman commandeer museum submarine , also a Transformer, to find the spacecraft. The TRF, after a failed attempt to stop the ''Alliance'', pursuit them in DSV submarines.  Burton contacts Seymour Simmons, both learning that Earth is Unicron, and the staff will be used to drain the planet’s life, via an access point hidden under [[Stonehenge]]. Locating the ship, Cade and Viviane discover Merlin’s tomb and obtain the staff. Viviane activates it, causing the spacecraft to become airborne, awakening the Knights of Iacon. As the TRF, now under Lennox, try to take the staff from them, Optimus arrives, forcing the humans to surrender the staff. Bumblebee, Lennox, and Cade confront Optimus who engages in battle with Bumblebee. Just as Optimus is about to finish him off, the formerly-mute Bumblebee begins speaking in his own voice, stirring Optimus' memories and freeing him from Quintessa's control. The Decepticons ambush Optimus and Megatron steals the staff from him. The Knights try to execute Optimus for his "betrayal," but Cade stops them when his talisman transforms into [[Excalibur]]. The Knights yield and join the humans and Autobots. Burton tries to stop Megatron from activating the staff at Stonehenge only to be mortally wounded, dying peacefully with Cogman at his side. At the same time, Cybertron's remains collide with Earth to begin draining energy from it, devastating the planet and killing millions.The Autobots, Dragonstorm, and human military forces converge on Stonehenge and Cybertron, attacking the Decepticons and Quintessa's minions, who either flee or are killed while Quintessa is defeated by Optimus and Bumblebee. The worlds are then saved upon Viviane removing the staff and the Autobots leave Earth to rebuild what is left of Cybertron.In a mid-credits scene, Quintessa, who has survived and is disguised as a human, approaches a group of scientists inspecting one of Unicron’s horns, offering a way to destroy him.

They are willing to do anything to get more followers. They use their friend Craig ([[Austin Abrams]]) as bait to capture serial killer Lowell Orson Lehmann ([[Kevin Durand]]) and ask him to aid them, but he refuses. The two decide to keep him captive, commit murders themselves, and use him as a fall guy. The next day, Craig is presumed to have run away. McKayla, Sadie, and their friend Jordan ([[Jack Quaid]]) attempt to convince Rosedale that there is a serial killer running loose, but they only earn the ire of Jordan's father, Sheriff Welch ([[Timothy V. Murphy]]). When McKayla's ex-boyfriend Toby ([[Josh Hutcherson]]) amasses more followers on [[Twitter]] than them, McKayla and Sadie kill him. His death is ruled an accident, enraging the two girls. They next kill cheerleading captain Syl and cut her body into pieces in order to ensure that her death is ruled a [[homicide]].   At Syl's memorial service, local firefighter Big Al ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) vows to catch the killer. Meanwhile, Lehmann attempts to turn McKayla against Sadie by convincing her that Sadie will use her to do the dirty work and take all of the credit. The girls plot to poison Big Al while he works out at the gym. Big Al fights back but the two narrowly manage to stab him and decapitate him with a bench press. Afterwards, Jordan arrives and reveals he has stolen the case files from his father.

They hold a march in defiance of the killer. However, Lehmann escapes and murders Campbell. Jordan has a falling out with McKayla and Sadie and leaves them to support his father. An enraged McKayla discovers he has stolen a phone belonging to her that has videos of their murders, and goads Sadie into heading to his house to kill him. Jordan reveals that he broke into the school and stole McKayla's psych profile; he suspects her of being the killer. They are interrupted when Lehmann breaks into the Welch residence and brutally stabs Jordan. McKayla awakens the sleeping Welch by breaking his window, and he drives Lehmann off before saving Jordan. Sadie takes the opportunity to destroy McKayla's stolen phone.   Two weeks later, Sadie is publicly honored by Welch, and she does not acknowledge McKayla in her speech. The two have a falling out.

Lehmann attempts to attack Sadie, but is stopped by McKayla. He turns on her, and McKayla pulls out a gun and shoots Lehmann dead. The girls reconcile, hang Jordan, and burn the prom down, killing 124 students. In the aftermath, Lehmann takes the fall for the murders.

Trouble (2017 film)
   
Tulip Fever
 Set in the Netherlands in the 17th century, during the period of the [[tulip mania]], the film tells the story of an artist Jan ([[Dane DeHaan]]) who falls for a married young woman Sophia ([[Alicia Vikander]]) while he's commissioned to paint her portrait by her husband Cornelis ([[Christoph Waltz]]). The two invest in the risky tulip market in hopes of building a future together.  The story begins with 17 year old Sophia, an orphan, being betrothed to the elderly Cornelis. In return for the marriage, her sisters are able to travel to New Amsterdam (New York) in the new world, where they have an aunt awaiting them. Sophia is unhappy in the marriage, since Cornelis seems to be concerned only with siring an heir. Cornelis has his friends show him their children, and there is talk of giving the new orphan bride Sophia six months to conceive and provide him with an heir. He already suffers from a mistake he made in the past, with his previous wife: she miscarried their first child and when Cornelis asked the doctor to save the second child over the wife, he feels that God punished him by taking his wife and his child away. Meanwhile, Sophia goes to a doctor, Dr Sogh, to find out why she is unable to conceive. Dr Sogh misunderstands Sophia and offers to impregnate Sophia himself. Sophia slaps him and returns home.  Cornelis decides to hire a painter, so that he would at least be remembered as having had a beautiful young wife, should he have no heir to continue his legacy. Sophia agrees, but as soon as the young painter Jan arrives to paint the couple, he and Sophia fall in love. Jan sends a note to Sophia, asking her to send him a vase with tulips. She shows up at his door with the tulips, and they consummate their love.  Meanwhile, Sophia's friend, the housemaid Maria, is having an affair with the neighborhood fishmonger, Willem. Willem is also speculating in the tulip market, and is doing quite well - expecting to be independently prosperous and able to marry Maria, he even sells his business to another fishmonger. One day, Sophia borrows Maria's cloak and heads to a rendezvous with Jan. Willem, seeing Sophia in the cloak, mistakes her for Maria, and follows her to her rendezvous. Crushed by what he thinks is Maria's unfaithfulness, he goes to a pub to drown his sorrows. There a prostitute robs him of the large sum he has built up on the tulip market. When he tries to retrieve the money, he is beaten up and forcibly inducted into the navy for causing a ruckus.  Jan plots to escape to the new world with Sophia, after having success of his own in the tulip speculation market. He hears that the nuns at St. Ursula (the convent Sophia came from) raise tulips in their gardens. Jan attempts to steal some of the bulbs, but is knocked out by the abbess of St. Ursula. When he regains consciousness, he apologises and the abbess gives him the bulbs Willem had bought before he was thrown into the navy.  Maria realises she is pregnant by Willem. With Willem gone, the baby will be born out of wedlock. Maria explains her condition to Sophia and threatens to reveal Sophia’s affair to Cornelis, if Cornelis were to find out about her pregnancy. Maria tells the audience in voice-over she is embarrassed at having made such a threat against her friend. Sophia conspires with Maria and decides to pass off the pregnancy as her own. When the baby is born, Sophia will pretend to die in childbirth, so she can leave to be with Jan, and Maria will get to raise the child as her own.  After Maria gives birth to a daughter and Sophia pretends to die, Cornelis is griefstricken at the loss of his wife. Sophia, under her shroud, weeps as she realizes that she has deeply hurt Cornelis with her deceit. While she is being carried away in a coffin, she regrets what she has done. When she later returns to the home, she catches sight of Cornelis lovingly cradling the baby, and decides that it's too late for things to go back to how they were. She flees back to the convent where she was raised.  Jan has one last transaction that will get him enough money to let him and Sophia leave the city and also pay off all his creditors. He tasks his friend, Gerrit, who is a drunk, with accomplishing this transaction, imploring him not to get drunk along the way. Gerrit completes the transaction and then does get drunk. In the ensuing revelry he eats the cargo he was carrying. When he tells Jan and Jan's creditors how he ate the "onion," they all know they have been ruined. The tulip bubble has burst. Jan goes to find Sophia, but finds her bright blue silk cloak in the river instead, which she cast off while fleeing back to the convent. He thinks she has flung herself into the canal as a result of the crashed tulip market.  Willem, returning after his year in the navy, goes to see Maria at Cornelis's house. Maria is furious with him when he explains that he was in Africa, but they sort out their misunderstandings and reconcile. Cornelis, in the next room, overhears their loud quarreling and the reveal of the conspiracy. He makes his peace with the truth, and departs for the Indies, but only after first leaving the house to Maria, Willem, and the baby girl he loved as his own.  Eight years later, Jan has nothing left except the paintings of his lover Sophia. The abbess of St. Ursula praises him for his talent, and commissions him to paint a mural in the church. When Jan looks down from painting the mural, he sees Sophia has joined the convent and smiles. The movie ends with the maid Maria and her fishmonger husband Willem eating dinner with their children. It is revealed that the film’s voiceover is Maria explaining the events which led to their family fortune to her first-born, Sophia, who is named in tribute after her mistress and friend.

Coincidentally, RJ Albeli walks in and feels that she must give her a shot.  She takes Sulu to meet her boss, Maria. Sulu is extrovert and engaging, which is a bit annoying for others but Maria finds her interesting. She gives her an opportunity to audition. At the audition, Sulu is very casual and not able to control her laughter after Pankaj, one of the poets at the radio station, recites the lines in a sensual manner. Just at the end, she manages to say 'Hello' in a sensual manner, which impresses Maria. Maria gives her card and asks if she would be able to do a call-in night show - where people would call her to talk about their troubles. Maria gives Sulu time to think.  Sulu thinks about the job and the sensual accent in which she would have to answer the calls. Just to try out, she calls a nearby grocery store, talks in a sensual accent and requests the owner to get a broom.

To start with, Ashok is annoyed with her that she took up the job without discussing with him but later relents out of his love for her.  The company provides Sulu pickup and drop facility. On her first day, Sulu faces an annoying caller who tries to change their chat into an obscene one. With her sharp mind, Sulu is able to tactfully handle it. Next, she gets a request from a caller to sing an out of the world kind of a song for him. Sulu, out of excitement, sings a song which she sings only for her husband. Ashok is annoyed by all this, as well as frustrated with his new boss who treats him rudely. Because of these two situations, he becomes angry and, at times, insecure.  Sulu's parents and her sisters are very angry with her program and force her to quit the job. But Ashok stands by her and she is able to continue. Maria is very happy with her and the show becomes very successful. Sulu also enjoys her work. But at times, Ashok expresses his frustration either at his job or hers. It seems that life is like a roller coaster ride for Sulu, high at work and low at home.  One day, she gets a call from her son's school and they visit his principal's office. The principal reveals that he is charging some other kids for showing some videos on the phone he stole from Ashok, as well as faking his signatures over the remarks written in his school dairy. On this basis, he suspends her son from the school. This becomes a very big issue in their family and Sulu's sisters blame her that because of her job she has neglected her son. They decide that she now has to leave the job and her son would not stay with them because her low level of education is causing similar influence on him. Sulu takes a tough stand, rejects both the conditions and leaves for her job. While coming back, she gets a call that her son is missing. They later find a note by him, revealing he is very ashamed of what he has done. He is very sad to see that his mother had to leave her job because of his actions.

Unlocked (2017 film)
 After an operation in [[Paris]] failed on her watch, CIA interrogation officer Alice Racine now works in an undercover capacity at a community centre in [[London]]. The area is a known location for [[Islamic extremism]], and information she discovers in her capacity at the centre is passed on to the security services, including MI5 Intelligence Chief Emily Knowles. Her former station chief and mentor Eric Lasch meets with her, and tells her that she shouldn’t feel guilty for the failed operation (which resulted in [[Algeria]]n suicide bombers killing 24 people) and that she needs to get back into the field. Meanwhile, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and [[MI5]] receive intel that radical preacher Imam Yazid Khaleel is planning a [[biological weapon|biological attack]] on an American target on British soil in collaboration with terrorist and American born [[Religious conversion|Islamic convert]] David Mercer. Racine is approached by Frank Sutter, an officer from the CIA’s London Station, who tells her she has orders from Europe Division Chief Bob Hunter to help them interrogate and break Khaleel’s courier they have captured.   In a hotel, Racine begins to interrogate the courier, a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[Morocco|Moroccan]] man named Lateef, and is able to coax the message he is due to deliver to Mercer’s representative to confirm the attack. However, before divulging the details of the message to Sutter, she receives a call from her handler Ed Romley, who confusingly gives her the same mission brief as Sutter. Realising she has been tricked and the men she is working with are not CIA, she attempts to remove Lateef from their custody, but in an ensuing gunfight he is killed. She retreats to Lasch's apartment, but that is soon also attacked by the operatives, with Racine witnessing Lasch be fatally shot as she escapes to a safe house he informed her of previously. Upon arriving at the safe house, she apprehends [[burglar]] Jack Alcott, who is in the process of robbing the apartment. Restraining him in the bedroom, she contacts Hunter and Romley, who despite claiming to believe her, per protocol, send [[SCO19]] officers to apprehend and bring her in. After fighting two of the officers and being [[Taser|tasered]], she is saved by Alcott and the two manage to escape. Revealing he is a former [[Royal Marine]] who served in the [[Iraq War]], Racine reluctantly decides to allow him to accompany her. Racine also seeks the help of Amjad, a friend and client from the community centre who drives a [[taxi]].   She and Alcott confront Khaleel in a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] restaurant, where he confesses he no longer believes in the radical extremism he promotes (with the courier message being a stand down order), but anticipates that Mercer will still go ahead with the attack. Following an associate of Lateef, Racine discovers Alcott is working with Sutter and the two fight, with Racine managing to escape after Alcott is killed by an aggrieved third party. Racine approaches Knowles, who agrees to help her and sets up an operation where Amjad stands in as the courier to meet with Mercer's representative. She reveals to Racine that intelligence from the French [[General Directorate for Internal Security|DGSI]] suggests senior parties in the CIA allowed the Paris attack to take place, as one of the victims killed in the bombings was a CIA [[whistle blower]]. Meanwhile, Romley's team track the bullets used in the killing of their men who apprehended Lateef to a [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|AT308C]] sniper rifle, which is revealed to have been checked out of a [[Metropolitan Police]] armoury by corrupt MI5 operative John Wilson. Wilson is shown to be part of the team providing cover for Knowles operation, and guns down his fellow operatives as well as injuring Knowles whilst trying to kill Racine.

The Vanishing of Sidney Hall
 The film centers around Sidney Hall ([[Logan Lerman]]), a young novelist whose life is depicted in a non-linear narrative, through elliptical flashbacks and flash-forwards through three periods of his life.  At the age of eighteen, Sidney reads a story about masturbating in the sixth grade to his English class, to the chagrin of his teacher. He is spared from expulsion by a fellow English teacher, Duane Jones ([[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]]), who encourages him with his writing. Sidney is subsequently approached by a bully, Brett Newport ([[Blake Jenner]]), who requests assistance with digging up a package they buried when they were small children. Sidney declines and returns home to his abusive mother Velouria ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), his downtrodden disabled father Gerald (Darren Pettie), as well as a love letter from an unidentified "Melody". Duane encourages Sidney to use unorthodox, loud tactics to draw Melody out, which he attempts, to no avail. He spots a girl ([[Elle Fanning]]) from the Jameson family across the street and correctly deduces that she is Melody, though she is hesitant to directly interact with him. After seeing Brett bully a classmate, Sidney agrees to help him dig up the package, on the condition that he ceases bullying. The pair go and dig the package up, but as they are about to part ways, Brett's father, Judge George Newport (Sean Cullen), violently arrives on the scene and Brett is forced to hand the package off to Sidney. Sidney watches the tape, to discover that it is a recording of Judge Newport having sex with an adolescent girl. Sidney and Brett rendezvous and agree to go to the authorities with the tape.  Melody calls Sidney and arranges an impromptu date to the fair with him, in which she takes her family's car without permission. At the fair, they bond and Melody admires a small wooden statue the carnival worker at the booth, Johan Tidemand ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]) carved. Johan gives Sidney the statue for free. Having watched Brett's tape and read Sidney's unflattering personal notebooks, Velouria confronts Sidney and throws them into the fireplace. Sidney informs Brett that the tape is destroyed, prompting Brett to commit suicide. This prompts Sidney to begin writing a controversial novel called ''"Suburban Tragedy"'', which Duane admires and sends to the publisher Harold ([[Nathan Lane]]), at Porterhouse, who inks a book deal, with Duane as Sidney's agent. Sidney confronts Velouria about him moving away. She attacks Sidney, who hits his head on a mantelpiece. Sidney and Melody subsequently move away together.  At the age of twenty-four, Sidney is a successful, albeit alcoholic, writer with two books that are atop [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] and his name in contention for a [[Pulitzer Prize]]. He suffers from hallucinations, as his head injury left scarring on the left side of his brain. At a book signing, Sidney meets an obsessed fan called Henry Crowe, who quotes the book and speaks of knowing what must be done. Shortly after, Crowe commits suicide, casting ''Suburban Tragedy'' in a bad light, leading to a competitor on the list, Francis Bishop, to win the Pullitzer. With his marriage with Melody failing, Sidney has a discrete, ongoing affair with Harold's daughter, Alexandra ([[Margaret Qualley]]). Melody reveals to Sidney that she is pregnant, though she insists that he is honest if he is having an affair, which he denies. He reveals that he purchased their dream house in New Mexico. While Sidney and Melody are at a restaurant, Alexandra confronts them, revealing the affair. Sidney and Melody make their way to their apartment and while Melody attempts to leave in the elevator, the power goes out, trapping them. Melody suffers an asthma attack and due to not having her inhaler, she dies in Sidney's arms in the elevator. Sidney leaves his apartment with the keys inside.  At the age of thirty, Sidney has not been seen nor heard from in five years. Downtrodden, he spends his time going from library to library, burning copies of his books. An apparent detective, The Searcher ([[Kyle Chandler]]), traces his steps and interviews those who have known him, including librarians, Duane and Johan, who forged identities for him. After making his way to New Mexico and riding on trains with his dog, Sidney is arrested for having an open alcohol container in public. The Searcher bails Sidney out of jail and takes him for breakfast, where The Searcher reveals himself to be Francis Bishop, wishing to write a biography about Sidney. Francis takes Sidney to the house in New Mexico, where Francis reveals that the positive influence from ''Suburban Tragedy'' saved his son from committing suicide. The writers part ways. Sidney's health takes a turn for the worse from the seizures and effects from alcoholism, putting him in a terminal state in the hospital. Sidney summons Francis, who he gives all his writings to and reveals the secrets about the inspiration for ''Suburban Tragedy'', as well as Judge Newport's perversion. Sidney goes silent and Francis departs from the hospital room. Sidney sees a vision of Melody and, taking the form of his eighteen year-old self, holds her hand as he passes away.  
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets
 In the 28th century, the former [[International Space Station]] has been added to until its mass threatens to cause it to fall out of [[Low Earth orbit|orbit]]. Relocated to deep space, it becomes Alpha, a space-traveling city inhabited by millions of species from thousands of planets. A special police division is created to preserve peace through the galaxy, including happy-go-lucky [[Major]] Valerian and his partner, no-nonsense [[Sergeant]] Laureline.  En route to a mission, Valerian dreams of a planet, Mül, where a low-tech [[humanoid]] race lives peacefully. They fish for pearls containing enormous amounts of energy, and use small animals to replicate them. Wreckage begins plummeting from the sky, followed by an apocalyptic explosion. Moments before her death a young princess manages to send out a telepathic signal.  Shaken, Valerian awakes. After an analysis reveals he might have received a signal from across time and space, he learns that his mission is to retrieve a "Mül converter", so-called for being able to replicate anything it eats. It is the last of its kind, and currently in the hands of [[black market]] dealer Igon Siruss. Before setting out, Valerian asks Laureline to marry him, but she brushes him off, due to his many affairs with female colleagues and his aversion to commitment.  Entering on planet Kirian a massive extra-dimensional bazaar called "Big Market", Valerian disrupts a meeting in a zone restricted to humans between Igon and two hooded figures who look like the humanoids from his vision. They also seek the converter, which is revealed to be one of the small animals he saw in his vision. Valerian and Laureline recover the converter, and he surreptitiously steals one of the pearls. Aboard their ship, he learns that Mül was destroyed 30 years earlier, and all information about it is classified.  They return to Alpha, where their superior, frosty Commander Arün Filitt, informs them the center of the station has been infected by an unknown force, rendering it highly toxic. Troops sent into the area have not returned, and the infection is growing. Laureline and Valerian are assigned to protect the commander during an interstation summit to discuss the crisis. Against the Commander's wishes, Laureline maintains possession of the converter.  During the summit, the humanoids suddenly attack, incapacitating everyone before kidnapping Filitt. Valerian chases the kidnappers to the infected area and crashes his vehicle. Evading arrest for insubordination, Laureline enlists the help of some aliens to track Valerian, and finds him unconscious at the edge of the infected zone. She wakes him, but is kidnapped by a primitive [[Empire|imperial]] tribe emigrated from planet Goara<ref></ref> called "Boulan Bathors" that lives nearby. Valerian infiltrates the tribe's territory with the help of a shape-shifting dancer, Bubble. They save Laureline and escape, but Bubble is mortally wounded. As she dies, she convinces Valerian to never give up on his feelings for Laureline.  Valerian and Laureline venture further into the infected area, realizing it is actually not toxic and contains some wrecks of antique spacecraft. They reach a large shielded hall where they find the humanoids, known as Pearls, with an unconscious Filitt. Their leader, Emperor Haban Limaï, explains that his people lived peacefully on Mül until a battle broke out in orbit between the human government's fleet and a government known as "Southern Territories". The human commander, Filitt, ordered the use of two powerful [[Thermonuclear weapon|fusion missile]]s that disabled the enemy ship but caused it to crash into the planet, annihilating Mül. Upon dying, Princess Lihö-Minaa transferred her soul into Valerian's body. A small group of survivors took shelter in a crashed human spaceship. They managed to repair it, and learned of the humans' technology and history. They eventually came to Alpha, where they assimilated more knowledge and built a ship of their own. They needed only the converter and the pearl to launch the ship so they could find a planet to use their technology and recreate their homeworld. Filitt admits his role in the genocide, but argues that it was necessary to end the war, as was the cover-up to prevent the humans from being expelled from Alpha. Valerian and Laureline disagree, stating that the commander has only been trying to save himself from the consequences for his actions, before Valerian knocks him out again.  Valerian hands over the pearl he stole, and Laureline persuades him to return the converter too, ignoring procedures. While the Pearls' spacecraft prepares for takeoff, Filitt's pre-programmed [[Military robot|robot K-Tron soldiers]] attack the Pearls, the government soldiers who were sent to assist Valerian, and their support staff, but are ultimately defeated. The spacecraft departs and Filitt is arrested. Valerian and Laureline are left adrift onboard a still working [[Apollo Command/Service Module]], which is identified by radio technicians as "''[[Destiny (ISS module)#In media|Destiny 2005]]''", and Laureline finally answers Valerian's marriage proposal with a "maybe" as they wait for rescue.

Later, Arivu joins a leading [[FMCG]] company, Saffron and joins its sales department under Stella Bruce ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]). He also manages to bring his friend Bhagya ([[Vijay Vasanth]]) out of Kasi's gang and gets him a job in Saffron. He meets Aadhi ([[Fahadh Faasil]]), the Brand Manager of Saffron, who teaches him how to progress by doing smart work and Arivu considers him as his inspiration. On the night of April 1, Kasi and his gang attack Bhagya and brutally stab him in Saffron's godown (warehouse), whereupon he dies in the hands of Arivu. Arivu filled with rage, tries to attack Kasi. But, Kasi's rival Doss ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]) attacks and brutally stabs him in retaliation for their previous encounter and Arivu admonishes Kasi for being such a paid henchman. Kasi reveals to Arivu that he killed Bhagya on a contract given by Jayaram ([[Anish Kuruvilla]]) the President of Saffron company, due to the fact that Bhagya tries to help Kasthuri ([[Sneha]]), who files a case claiming Saffron's products to be adulterated, due to which she had lost her son. Arivu is addressed by Kasi as being a worse hitman than he himself is. Arivu then saves Kasi. Arivu is also told by Kasi that all the products manufactured by his company are adulterated. He takes up a mission to fight such malpractices not only in Saffron, but also in all the other five major food companies, including the company owned by Madhav Kurup ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]). Arivu shares all of his plans with Aadhi. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Aadhi is actually Adhiban Madhav and he is the son of Madhav Kurup. He joined Saffron to know their trade secrets and merge the company with his father's company.  Arivu manages to convince the staff of his company to manufacture products as per Government regulations for two days, while he convinces the staff of the other companies to wear a kerchief on their dresses for the next two days, thus tricking the owners into believing that their workers have turned against them. But, Aadhi manages to foil this plan of Arivu and coerces the other owners to write over the major shares of their company to Madhav Kurup, thus making him the deciding authority of all their companies. Aadhi then manages to turn all the employees against Arivu by tricking them into believing that Arivu worked as a spy for Madhav Kurup. Stella Bruce then slaps Arivu and humiliates him, while Aadhi pretends to defend Arivu claiming that he is innocent and it is the new president who conspired all these. After this, Arivu reveals to Aadhi that Stella Bruce was his ally and he now knows that Aadhi is the true traitor. Aadhi then burns down the go down containing the unadulterated products and reveals to Arivu that he is the son of Madhav Kurup, and that he will be the next CEO of the company. He also convinces the staff through his clever tactics and makes them propose his name as the new CEO, also revealing to Arivu that he will make them manufacture adulterated products without their knowledge, now that he command their loyalty, support and trust.  Arivu goes to the [[Radio Mirchi]] radio station on the same day, which a night before  May 1 and reveals that after the fire accident, one of the injured department heads of Saffron Karpaga Vinayagam ([[Ramdoss]]) called him into the ambulance and told him that he followed the regulations on the third day too. Arivu also got to know from the other team workers of Saffron Kennedy ([[Mansoor Ali Khan (actor)|Mansoor Ali Khan]]), Vinoth ([[Kaali Venkat]]), Ansari ([[Aruldoss]]) and Sivaranjani ([[Vinodhini Vaidyanathan]]) that after manufacturing quality products for two days, they could not bring themselves to manufacture adulterated products on the next day, and they all followed Government regulations, thus manufacturing quality products on the next day too. Aadhi now the CEO, hears the workers say that they will rebel against him and depose him if tries to revert to manufacturing adulterated products. Arivu further adds that the loyalty of all the employees in each and every field shouldn't be wasted by showing it towards unethical employers. Aadhi vents out his frustration on the permanent failure of his plan.  All the people in the city shows their support to Arivu. Arivu celebrates his success along with Mrinalini ([[Nayanthara]]) his love interest, his friends, his family, the people of his slum and the people of the city as the movie ends.

Velipadinte Pusthakam
 During the [[Malayalam calendar|Karkidakam]] season in 2007, Vishwanathan, also known as Bullet Vishwan ([[Anoop Menon]]), is ambushed while riding his motorbike. As he fights his attackers, two men—Maathan Tharakan ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) and Kaaka Rameshan ([[Chemban Vinod Jose]])—arrive. Maathan hits Vishwan with a steel bar, killing him.  Prof. Premraj, also called Kamaraj ([[Salim Kumar]]), is the vice-principal of a college who tries to stop relationships between male and female students while continuing a relationship with a cleaner, and watches pornographic videos. Two student gangs; the 'kadappuram' (seafront) gang led by Franklin ([[Appani Sarath]]) and the '[[Thiruvananthapuram]]' (city) gang led by Sameer (Arun Kurian). During one of these fights, the gangs break a picture of Vishwan. Premraj installs [[CCTV]] cameras in the campus. Franklin's friend Vignyanaakoshi ([[Jude Anthany Joseph]]) interferes with the system to show pornographic videos; Premraj turns on the monitor, sees the videos and is caught by Fr. George Kaattuparambu ([[Shivaji Guruvayoor]]), who suspends him from his job. Premraj tells Sameer and his gang he is innocent of the offence but is being replaced as vice-principal and is powerless to act. He orders the gang to break the new vice-principle's legs; Sameer agrees to this and the gang hold a small protest by the gate as Vishwan's replacement arrives. Franklin also arrives and congratulates the new vice-principal.  The new vice-principal is Michael Idicula ([[Mohanlal]]), who avoids Sameer's plan to break his legs. He introduces himself to the teachers, including Mary ([[Anna Rajan]]). Michael's first class of students—especially Sameer, who was praised for making a [[short film]]—seem to like him. This disappoints Franklin, who was expecting Michael to befriend Franklin instead. One day, Michael meets Franklin's father Varkey (Prasad Mohammah), who is drunk and invites Michael to his house. He meets Franklin's family. Later, the physics teacher Anumol (Sneha Sreekumar), who is Mary's friend, decides to propose to Michael on her behalf. When they go to meet Michael, he tells them to meet after the morning [[Holy Mass|Mass]] at the local [[Latin Church|Latin]] church. They discover Michael is a priest and wonder why he still did not marry. Anumol and Mary cancel their planned proposal; instead Anumol asks Michael if he knows anyone willing to marry Mary, to which Michael agrees. Meanwhile, Michael reconciles Sameer and Franklin and their gangs, and they also meet Vareethettan ([[Alencier Ley Lopez]]), who has been serving Micheal's family for a long time.  Michael, as vice-principal, is popular with the students and the staff. When Michael suggests making a [[feature film]] to raise money for building two [[Dormitory|hostels]] for the college, Fr. Kaattuparambu gives permission, providing only the Phoenix College staff and students are in the film. Michael calls his friend, Malayalam film producer [[Vijay Babu]], about the project, and he agrees to take part. According to Vijay, the story is only suitable for a short film and Michael suggests the story of Vishwan,who had campaigned for a college to be built on land originally owned by Maathan Tharakan. He describes Vishwan as a violent but honest man who always did the right thing whenever he could. Maathan Tharakan killed Vishwan the day after the college's cornerstone was laid, and paid to have his right-hand man Kaaka Rameshan sent to jail. Vijay says the story is perfect and goes ahead with the project.  Auditions for the film's characters are held and all of the roles except that of Vishwan—whom no-one portrays well—are cast. Because of this, Vijay decides to freeze the project. They eventually find someone who is perfect for the role—Michael—who changes his appearance completely. The film's production begins.  [[Principal photography]] of the film begins; all of the actors—except Premraj (portraying Maathan Tharakan), who has difficulties in acting—perform well. Meanwhile, Michael meets Vishwan's widow Jayanthi ([[Priyanka Nair]]) and her second daughter Sreekutty, who explain that their first daughter died. One night, Premraj is beaten up by the real Maathan Tharakan and his gang, who warn him Michael will suffer the same fate if he carries on with the film. Michael goes to meet Maathan and tells him filming must continue. One night, Maathan tells Michael the story about Vishwan's death is wrong and that Kaaka Rameshan was the true killer; Vishwan was killed because he married Rameshan's lover Jayanthi. Shocked, Michael asks Sameer & Franklin to restructure the climax; after much argument, both agrees to the demands.  The crew film the death of Vishwan's first child. After the filming, Michael signs a form in the name of Vishwan, shocking Vareethettan. He tells the staff and students Michael's father resented his son becoming a priest and forcibly removed him from the [[seminary]]; this incident affected Michael as a psychological illness. Vareethettan says Michael adopts the personality of characters he really likes, and asks them to stop Michael from acting. Michael vanishes but he—still speaking as Vishwan—threatens Varkey into revealing how Vishwan's first daughter died; Varkey says Kaaka Rameshan drowned her in a pond. Varkey told the real Vishwan everything and Vishwan started fighting Rameshan and got himself killed. The next day, Rameshan is released from jail and tells some of the people there he killed Vishwan, shocking everyone. Rameshan creates a fuss at the filming and then arrives at the climax scene. There, Michael—who is supposed to be receiving a whack on the head from another actor—stops and beats up the actor. Rameshan gets involved and tells the crew he killed Vishwan, angering Michael, who nearly kills Rameshan.  Vishwan's death is not depicted in the students' film; instead a caption tells the audience; "Vishwan lives in the minds of everyone". Michael's illness has been cured and the bishop explains that Michael is the best person to inaugurate the new hostel. He does this and announces that he will become the new [[principal (academia)|principal]] of the Phoenix College. The film ends as all of them stands together to take a selfie.

The Vault (film)
 After starting a fire in a nearby warehouse as a diversion, five robbers -- Leah ([[Francesca Eastwood]]); her sister, Vee ([[Taryn Manning]]); their brother, Michael ([[Scott Haze]]); Kramer, the safecracker; and Cyrus, the muscle -- initiate a bank robbery. An officer inside the bank tries to call for help on his police radio. Detective Iger ([[Clifton Collins Jr.]]), who had just been in the bank hears the call, and decides to check it out. While walking back to check on the bank he hears another, anonymous call on his radio about the robbery.  The robbers find only $70,000 in the vault. Leah wants to leave but Vee and Cyrus demand more money. The assistant manager ([[James Franco]]) says he will tell them where $6 million is stored, as long as they don't hurt anyone. He tells them the money is in the basement vault which is a part of the old bank and hands them the key to the access door.   By now police are stationed outside the bank, and Leah is confused as to how they knew about the heist. The head teller, Susan, tries to connect with Michael, telling him he is a decent man. He tells her that he owes people a lot of money and his sisters are helping him rob the bank.   When Kramer successfully breaks open the vault, the lights flicker. A man in a white mask and what appears to be a group of the hostages attack him. He is then pulled inside the old vault. Leah and Vee watch from the security monitors upstairs, but only Kramer appears on the screen. Thinking there are more people in the bank, Leah ask Cyrus to count the hostages that are gathered inside the safety deposit vault. The lights start to flicker again and the vault door closes with Cyrus and the hostages inside. As Kramer is repeatedly stabbed in the basement vault, Cyrus is overcome by the same group of hostages that attacked Kramer. The man in the white mask appears and grabs his gun, forcing it into Cyrus's mouth. When the vault door opens again, Leah goes in but Cyrus is nowhere in sight. Michael sees Kramer commit suicide.  Suspecting that Susan called the police, Leah interrogates her. Susan tells Leah about the robbery in 1982 where a robber in a white mask apparently "snapped" under the pressure and killed some hostages, forced some to kill each other and then burned the rest alive in the old vault. The masked man was never caught or found. Vee turns up with a bag of money -- but the bills are all from 1982.  After the police attempt to take her and Vee out with sniper fire, an outgoing call indicator on an office telephone catches Leah's attention. She picks it up and listens to the same robbery message that Detective Iger had heard earlier. Michael cuts into a water pipe to make an escape route and encounters a burned woman pleading for help. Vee finds Cyrus's body with his head blown off. Leah heads outside and releases one of the hostages. She asks the Detective who made the phone call to the police. He answers that the message came from the radio, they never received any phone calls. Leah goes back inside to the telephone and listens to the same message being repeated, suddenly recognising the voice.  Vee escapes through the water pipe. As Michael begins setting the place on fire to cover their escape, Leah lets the hostages go. As she attempts to escape through the water pipe, the masked man and undead hostages attack her. Michael distracts them long enough to allow Leah to escape, then sets the place on fire, sacrificing himself.  During the ensuing police interview of the hostages, Detective Iger tries to find out why they know nothing about the bank employee who helped the robbers. Susan says she knows all the employees inside the bank for ten years and had never seen the man before. Susan looks at the investigation wall and points to a picture of the assistant manager. Detective Iger tells her the picture is of someone who died in the 1982 incident. He was the assistant manager who had called the police to report the robbery but was shot by the robber. It was the same call that Leah and Detective Iger had heard the previous day.  Leah and Vee meet in a rural area. The police assume all of the robbers died in the fire, so they are free to start their lives anew. When their car won't start, Vee checks on the engine and is attacked by the man in the white mask.

The household plots to undermine their relationship, hoping that Abdul will be sent home. When Victoria embarrasses herself by recounting to the court the one-sided account of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Mutiny]] that Abdul had told her, Victoria's faith and trust in him are shaken and she decides he must go home. But the following day she changes her mind and asks him to stay. She gives Abdul a bejewelled locket with her photograph.

Vikram Vedha
 The film begins with an animated interpretation of the Indian folktale ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' where the [[Vetala]] asks King [[Vikramaditya]] if he can tell a story. The tale of the Vetala correlates with the modern-day lives of Vikram, a brave, honest police inspector who is decisive about right and wrong, and Vedha, a criminal who understands the grey shades between good and evil. Vikram leads an [[Encounter killings by police|encounter unit]] formed to eliminate Vedha. In one encounter, the squad kills some of Vedha's henchmen, framing the death of a criminal killed by Vikram to avoid further inquiry. When Santhanam, one of the members, is nervous about this, Vikram calms him by saying that he sleeps peacefully knowing the men he shot were criminals. As the unit plans another encounter, Vedha enters the police station and surrenders. When Vikram interrogates Vedha, he offers to tell him a story.  The first story relates how Vedha became a gangster and drug smuggler. Vedha warns his younger brother Vignesh, called Puli due to his arithmetic skills, to stay away from crime, but Puli is forced by a rival gangster, Ravi, to carry drugs. When Puli is caught by the police, he confesses and Ravi is arrested. On his boss Sangu's orders, Ravi assaults Puli, leaving a permanent mark on his hand. Vedha asks Vikram if he should kill Ravi or Sangu. Vikram replies that Ravi was an instrument; Sangu was the real culprit. Vedha says the answer is correct implying he killed Sangu. Vedha's lawyer, who turns out to be Vikram's wife Priya, intervenes and bails him out.  Vikram realises the unarmed person he shot was Puli, based on the mark in his hand. Worried Vedha might try to kill his colleague Simon, Vikram rushes to save him. He finds him and Chandra, Puli's girlfriend, shot dead. Surendhar, the [[Superintendent of police (India)|superintendent of police]], dismisses it as a failed encounter. Priya refuses to divulge Vedha's whereabouts to Vikram, testing their marriage. Angered by this, Vikram raids Vedha's tenements and manages to capture him. Vedha requests Vikram to listen to another story.  The second story starts with Puli, now an adult, offering to launder Vedha's income investing it in shares. Vedha's boss Cheta invests five million rupees in this venture. Chandra is supposedly kidnapped and the money is missing. Chandra returns and reveals she stole the money to start a new life but came back because she loves Puli. Vedha returns the money to Cheta who orders him to kill Chandra. Vedha asks Vikram if he should respect Cheta and carry out the order or disobey him and support Puli, resulting in a [[Gang#Gang violence|gang war]]. Vikram replies that he should support Puli, to which Vedha agrees. Realising Puli's innocence causes Vikram to stumble momentairly. Vedha attacks and subdues Vikram, telling him to investigate Simon and Puli's deaths.  Vikram begins his investigation, finally discovering that Ravi was the mastermind behind Puli's death and informs Vedha, who brings Ravi to an abandoned factory. Vikram arrives to find Ravi beaten up by Vedha, who then tells Vikram the third and final story.  Vedha had sent Puli and Chandra to Mumbai. He noticed only his men not Cheta's are being targeted and eliminated by the police. Based on Ravi's confession, Vedha says Simon was paid by Ravi to kill his men. Vedha asks Vikram if Simon was right since he became corrupt to pay for his critically ill son's medical procedure. Vedha kills Ravi and escapes before Vikram can answer.  Surendhar and the unit arrive. He castigates Vikram for letting Vedha escape again. Vikram slowly realises the entire unit had also been paid by Ravi. Surendhar reveals that Ravi paid them to kill Vedha and Chandra's abduction was intended to get Puli out of Mumbai, which would lure Vedha out of hiding. The guilt-ridden Simon had gone to save Chandra but the unit killed both of them. As the unit prepares to kill Vikram, Vedha reappears and saves him. A gunfight ensues and Vikram disables his colleagues, who were mere pawns, but kills Surendhar. Vikram asks Vedha if he should let him go for saving his life or kill him since he is a criminal. The film ends with the [[Duel#Pistol duel|standoff]] between them.

Verónica (2017 Spanish film)
 In 1991, Verónica is a 15-year-old girl living with her mother and three siblings in an apartment in the [[working-class]] district of Vallecas, [[Madrid]]. Their father died recently and their mother works long hours at a bar to support the family, leaving Verónica in charge of her younger siblings: twins Lucia and Irene, and Antoñito. On the day of the [[Solar eclipse of July 11, 1991|solar eclipse]], her teacher explains how some ancient cultures used eclipses to stage [[human sacrifice]]s and summon dark spirits.   While the school gathers on the roof to view the eclipse, Verónica, her friend Rosa, and their classmate Diana go into the basement to conduct a [[séance]] using a [[Ouija board]]. Verónica wants to reach out to her father. The board responds right away but Rosa and Diana pull their hands back when the glass cup becomes too hot to touch. Verónica's hand remains on it, and at the moment of the eclipse, the cup shatters, cutting her finger and dripping blood onto the board. Verónica becomes unresponsive and suddenly lets out a demonic scream. After passing out, she wakes in the school nurse's office, who tells her she probably passed out from [[iron deficiency]].  Verónica begins experiencing paranormal occurrences. She is unable to eat her dinner, as if an invisible hand is preventing her. Claw and bite marks appear on her body and she hears strange noises. Her friends begin avoiding her. Looking for answers, she goes back to the school basement and finds the school's elderly blind [[nun]] whom the students call "Sister Death." The nun scolds her for doing something so dangerous and explains that the séance attached a dark spirit to her; she needs to protect her siblings. The nun tries to compel the spirit to leave her, but nothing happens.  Verónica draws protective [[rune|Viking symbols]] for the kids, only for the demon to destroy them. She tries to help Lucia when the spirit chokes her, but Lucia says it was Verónica who was choking her. That night, Verónica dreams that her siblings are eating her. She wakes up to find that she's on her first [[menstruation|period]]. As she scrubs her mattress, she finds burn marks on the underside. Later, she finds on each of the kids' mattresses a large burn mark in the shape of a human body. Sister Death tells her that she can force the spirits to leave by doing right what she did wrong. Verónica learns that it is important to say goodbye to the spirit at the end of the séance. She asks Rosa and Diana to help her hold another séance, but they refuse.  Desperate, she decides to hold the séance with her young siblings. She has Antoñito draw the protective symbols on the walls, but he flips to the wrong page and instead draws symbols of invocation. When she tells the spirit to say goodbye, it refuses. She calls the police as the spirit snatches Antoñito, and helps Lucia and Irene escape. She returns to find her brother hiding and calling her name. Verónica realizes she has been possessed by the demon the entire time, and had been harming her siblings under its control. She attempts to end the possession by slitting her own throat but is prevented by the demon. The police enter to find her being attacked by an invisible force and passing out.

Victor Crowley (film)
  In 1964, Del House ([[Jonah Ray]]) proposes to his girlfriend Sue (Kelly Vrooman) in Honey Island Swamp. However the couple hears Victor Crowley's ([[Kane Hodder]]) ghostly moans. Fearing that someone has been hurt, they investigate and find a hunter, who is decapitated in front of them by Crowley. The couple flees, but Crowley easily catches up with them and dismembers them.  In 2017, survivor of the Crowley massacre Andrew Yong ([[Parry Shen]]), who is believed by some people to have committed the murders himself, appears on his ex-wife, Sabrina's, show ''The Sabrina Show'', to promote his new book about the events. Sabrina announces an exclusive book signing to take place later that day.  Meanwhile, friends Chloe (Katie Booth), Rose (Laura Ortiz), and Chloe’s boyfriend Alex ([[Chase Williamson]]) are planning to get Andrew to help them film a mock trailer for a B-Movie they're making about the Crowley massacre.  At the signing Andrew is subjected to abuse and lewd acts much to the ignorance of his manager, Kathleen ([[Felissa Rose]]) who quickly ushers him out when she gets him a deal that will gain him almost a million dollars, much to the chagrin of Chloe, Rose and Alex who never got to pitch their idea.  Andrew and Kathleen head out on a private charter plane with Sabrina and her crew; Austin (Brian Quinn) and Casey ([[Tiffany Shepis]]) however the planes engine explodes and they crash land in Honey Island Swamp.  Below in the Swamp, Chloe, Rose and Alex are about to begin filming their trailer alongside eccentric, swamp tour guide/actor local Dillon ([[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]]). Rose has her cell phone using it to watch videos of the correct way to say the gypsy’s chant that cursed Victor Crowley. Suddenly a body from the plane lands in front of them. Rose and Dillon head off to try and help while Alex tries to calm Chloe down, meanwhile Rose's phone plays a YouTube video of Reverand Zombie ([[Tony Todd]]) reciting the voodoo curse that originally brought Crowley back.  At the plane everyone seems to be okay, though Casey is pinned under the seats with the water slowly rising. Rose and Dillon find the plane and begin to get everyone to safety when Crowley's screams are heard, Andrew ushers everyone back into the plane for safety.  Meanwhile, Chloe and Alex stumble across the old Crowley House, now a museum and memorial. Crowley attacks, bashing Alex's head in with a claw hammer before tearing it off as Chloe flees in shock.  At the plane Rose sees Chloe outside and is about to let her in when Crowley attacks, jamming Chloe's head through the plane window before dragging her away, leaving her badly injured but alive as bait.  Following a series of arguments and altercations, Kathleen begins to have a panic attack and flees from the plane. Austin tries to stop her but Crowley slices the top of his head off, causing his brain to fall out. Kathleen manages to call the police but Crowley catches her and kills her, while also finally killing Chloe. He then attacks the plane causing it to sink faster, drowning the pregnant Casey.  As the group begin to argue, after it is divulged that Kathleen lied to Andrew about the amount of money he would receive, Crowley attacks the plane with his belt sander, as the group panics he begins to cut through the circuitry which restores power to the plane. Dillon locks himself in the pilot's cabin, hoping to radio for help and start the engine so they can use it to suck Crowley in, killing him for good.  Andrew, Sabrina and Rose all flee in separate directions with Sabrina stealing Kathleen's phone from Rose before heading to Dillon's boat, while Rose hides. At the boat Crowley catches Sabrina and decapitates her after breaking her jaw. He then chases after Rose and throws her at Andrew and Dillon, who got the engine working, the turbine now running.  A stand-off between the three and Crowley ensues where Andrew misses his shot with a flare gun and Rose attempting to use Crowley's Hatchet as a tomahawk also fails to hit him, instead giving him the weapon back. In a last ditch attempt to be the hero Dillon turns to Rose and says “I would have had your babies” then rugby tackles Crowley into the turbine, splattering Rose and Andrew in his blood as Crowley is finally killed for good.  In a mid-credits scene, Marybeth Dunston ([[Danielle Harris]]) watches a news report on the crash. Realizing Crowley has once again returned she grabs a shotgun saying, "I've been waiting for you."

Manjooran takes the case; he is aided by officers Harshitha Chopra ([[Raashi Khanna]]) and Iqbal ([[Chemban Vinod Jose]]). Harshitha says she saw a woman wearing a [[burqa]] rushing into a restaurant on the night of the murder; she offered help but the woman refused and ran away.  Seven months before the murders, Manjooran arrests drug-lord Felix D. Vincent ([[Srikanth (Telugu actor)|Srikanth]]), who escapes from custody.

The Villainess
  In the opening scene of the movie an unnamed highly skilled and trained assassin enters a hallway and kills numerous people with her gun and knives, not before being surrounded surrounded by cops and smiling a grim smile.  The assassin is shown in a room in an unnamed facility. She is drugged and is given plastic surgery. While recuperating she has a flashback showing an unnamed man with a mustache trying to resuscitate her after a breath holding exercise. He is calling her Sook-hee.  The facility turns out to be part of South Korea's intelligence agency and is run by a woman named Kwon-sook. Kwon-sook tells Sook-hee that to give her a new start the agency has faked her death. Kwon-sook tells her they have given her a new identity and name, Chae Yeon-soo. Yeon-soo says she doesn't care and wants to die. Kwon-sook tells Yeon-soo she is pregnant. Kwon-sook offers her a deal: train with her as an agent, work as an agent, and she will have freedom after 10 years of service. Yeon-soo accepts and while in training, gives birth to a daughter, Eun-hye.   Still at the facility, Yeon-soo is having a procedure to remove a tattoo from her shoulder and while this is happening, she has a flashback to the unnamed man with a mustache giving her the shoulder tattoo when she was 20-year-old Sook-hee. Another flashback occurs and we again see 20-year-old Sook-hee as a highly skilled and trained assassin trying to kill an unnamed man with yellow teeth. Sook-hee is captured and while beating her, the unnamed man with yellow teeth tells her he did not kill her father. Eventually, the unnamed man with a mustache arrives and shoots the unnamed man with yellow teeth and frees Sook-hee. The flashback continues and we see Sook-hee as an 8 year old being trained to load a pistol by the unnamed man with a mustache. The unnamed man with a mustache tells the young Sook-hee to devote her life as an assassin to him.   Kwon-sook gives Yeon-soo a folder with the info for her first "assignment". When she kills the target she looks up to see a young girl on the stairs. This triggers a flashback to 7-year-old Sook-hee seeing her father killed. Sook-hee is hiding under a bed and doesn't get a look at the killer's face, she only hears him whistling an eerie tune. When a man comes back into the room, we are shown that this person is Jang-Chun, the unnamed man with yellow teeth. Jang-Chun was a friend of Sook-hee's father. Her father had stolen a diamond. Jang-Chun sells Sook-hee to a prostitution ring. Sook-hee is about to be forcibly raped by a prostitution client when the unnamed man with a mustache arrives and rescues her. We learn his name is Lee Joong-sang. And we learn how it came about that Joong-sang trained Sook-hee to be this killing machine and why she is so devoted to him.   Having completed her first assignment, Yeon-soo is released from the facility and will continue to work for the agency from her own apartment that she shares with her daughter Eun-hye. Unknown to Yeon-soo, Kwon-sook has placed a male agent in the apartment beside Yeon-soo's apartment. His name is Jung-Hyun-soo and he is to befriend Yeon-soo and keep tabs on her.   After a few meetings with each other, Yeon-soo asks out Hyun-soo. While noticing Jung-Hyun-soo's tie, it reminds Yeon-soo of a tie she gave to Joong-sang. It is revealed in flashbacks that Sook-hee and Joong-sang had gotten married. We learn in a flashback that the marriage was not the same for Joong-sang as it was for Sook-hee. We learn that Sook-hee says that she is willing to let go of her thirst for revenge if she can get married and live a normal life. Joong-sang sees that his trained assassin would no longer be of much use, so he sets up an act. He stages a wedding with her and pays people to attend the wedding and while on their honeymoon, he fakes saving a gang member called Choi-Chun-Mo and stages his own death. When Sook-hee hears he is dead, she loses her mind and goes on a killing rampage and takes out the whole gang (who she thinks is behind Joong-sang's death). Joong-sang has eliminated his rivals and Joong-sang expects Sook-hee to be killed because of her rage and the sheer numbers of the gang. But they are no match. This is the opening scene of the movie.  While on a mission together with Min-ju, a classmate from the facility, Yeon-soo is caught stealing a phone, and in the ensuing fight, Min-ju is killed. The info from the phone has documents about Choi Chun-Mo and the agency is worried that since Yeon-soo knew him, she may be a double-agent. Hyun-soo comforts Yeon-soo and this brings them closer together.   Yeon-soo continues to live at the apartment and the agency has figured their next target for her. The agency wants to do an assassination from a wedding catering company so decides to arrange a wedding between Hyun-soo and Yeon-soo. In a callback to the earlier story the agency pays people to attend the wedding and Yeon-soo in her wedding gown aims a rifle out a window to her target, who she sees through the rifle scope is: Joong-sang. She can't kill him, shocked that he's still alive.  Joong-sang backtracks the location from which the shots come and identifies Yeon-soo as Sook-hee from the wedding photos. He makes contact with Yeon-soo to verify that it is actually her. He tapes a conversation of the agency and sends it to Yeon-soo. The conversation reveals that Hyun-soo is actually an undercover agent. She turns on the agency.  The agency takes Yeon-soo into custody. In the meanwhile, Joong-sang's gang gets to Hyun-soo and Eun-hye. Hyun-soo tries to tell Joong-sang (on the phone) that Eun-hye is, in fact, Joong-sang's daughter hoping for all the killing to stop. Joong-sang doesn't care for the little girl and tells Hyun-soo to kill the kid in exchange for his own life. Hyun-soo tries to fight the gang but is knocked unconscious and left with the little girl and a bomb.  Joong-sang stages a "rescue" of Yeon-soo from the agency's custody. As she reaches her apartment, she watches as the bomb goes off and Hyun-soo and her daughter both die. She thinks it's the work of the agency. She goes to confront Kwon-sook, but Kwon-sook has news for her. Hyun-soo had found Jang-Chun, the unnamed man with yellow teeth, and got to know everything. This interview was recorded on surveillance tape. Kwon-sook plays the tape for Yeon-soo.  Yeon-soo is consumed with revenge. Yeon-soo tracks down Joong-sang and his gang to a parking garage. She kills all the gang members in the garage and confronts Joong-sang, who escapes to the street and meets his remaining gang members and they speed off in a passenger bus. Yeon-soo chases after them. She catches up to the bus, boards the bus, crashes the bus and finally has an axe over Joong-sang's head, he puts his head down and starts whistling an eerie tune. She axes Joong-sang in the head before walking out of the wreckage with the police surrounding her, and smiles a grim smile.

Voice from the Stone
 In post-[[World War II]] Italy, Malvina is on her deathbed at her ancestral home. She tells Jakob, her adolescent son, that another woman will come, a woman who will love him, and that the next words he speaks will call Malvina back to him.  Seven months later a British nurse specializing in children’s care, Verena, arrives. Jakob hasn't spoken since his mother died and Verena is the latest English-speaking (per Malvina's wishes) nurse recruited by Klaus, Jakob's father. Verena meets estate keeper Alessio and retired house maid Lilia. Though polite, Jakob is cold and distant.  Verena learns that Malvina's family owned the estate and surrounding quarries for 1,200 years. Malvina was the first descendant not to run the quarry, instead becoming a world famous pianist. Since most of the men who worked there died during the second world war, she allowed the quarry to flood, though Alessio still lights a flame for long-dead quarrymen, proclaiming "Life. Death. Love. The stone was everything."   When Verena looks in on Jakob one night, she finds him with his ear to the stone wall in his room, listening. Klaus fears that Jakob believes he can hear Malvina in the stone. Verena worries that she is inadequate and that Jakob's condition requires a mental health specialist.  When Verena sees Jakob on the ledge of a tall tower, she endangers herself to rescue him &ndash; making her (and Jakob) realize that she cares for him and must stay to help him.  She caringly explains that the voice he hears is real, but that it is just his mind playing tricks on him. The next day Verena sees him listening to Malvina's tombstone in the family mausoleum. Alessio informs her that 40 generations are buried there "in the stone". Verena, who was orphaned around Jakob's age, tells the boy that she already knows that wishing to hear dead loved ones does not make it happen.    Verena, who cannot play piano, encourages the gifted Jakob to do so, as he has refused to play since Malvina died. Lilia, a confidant to Malvina, develops a close relationship with Verena. Lilia visits her room most evenings to talk about Jakob, and Malvina, and Verena's disconnected life of helping, then having to leave, a series of children.  Verena becomes more attached to the stone, listening to walls, the quarry and even Malvina's tomb. She tears her skirt one day and Lilia gives her a dress of Malvina's. This initially angers Klaus, but upon seeing Verena in a state of undress, he notices the striking physical similarity between Verena and his wife. Klaus has stalled on making a sculpture of Malvina, and Verena agrees to model nude so the statue can be completed. Verena starts dreaming about sleeping with Klaus.   Verena catches Jakob listening to the stone wall in Malvina's near empty bedroom. She joins him and hears Malvina's voice, confirming that her spirit is living in the stone. Verena speaks to a picture of Malvina, promising to care for both Jakob and Klaus. She sleeps with Klaus after he finishes his work on the statue, and Jakob becomes friendlier towards her. though still remaining silent.  Klaus feels guilty and decides to fire her since Jakob still isn't speaking. Distraught, and suffering from the same fever Malvina had, Verena pleads with Jakob to speak so that she will not be sent away. When she does leave, Klaus suddenly begs her to stay in his and Jakob's lives. She wants to ask Lilia's advice, only to learn that Lilia committed suicide on the day of Malvina's death. As she flees the house she collapses and is carried to Malvina's bedroom.  In her fevered state, she has numerous hallucinations. She sees Lilia, then sees Allesio entombing her with Malvina, who runs her hand over Verena's face. When Verena wakes up on the bed, seemingly recovered, Jakob sees her and finally speaks, 'I miss my mama', to which Verena replies, 'I'm right here'. "Verena", who now wears Malvina's signature ring and plays the piano flawlessly, says that 'I hardly know the woman I see.  We are, none of us, quite who we were.' Alessio is pleased to see that "Malvina" back, restoring the happy family.

War for the Planet of the Apes
  Two years have passed<ref></ref> since the human-hating [[bonobo]] Koba attacked [[Dawn of the Planet of the Apes|the human survivors in San Francisco]]. Since then, Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced against a rogue U.S. military faction known as Alpha-Omega. Led by a ruthless colonel, Alpha-Omega employs many apes formerly loyal to Koba, derogatorily called "donkeys".  An Alpha-Omega platoon launches an attack on an ape outpost, but it fails and four soldiers, including one named Preacher and a "donkey" gorilla named Red, are captured. Caesar releases the soldiers, hoping the display of mercy will show the Colonel that the apes are not savages; Red escapes by injuring the albino gorilla Winter. Later, Caesar's eldest son Blue Eyes and lieutenant Rocket return from a long journey. Blue Eyes reports that they found a place across the desert that is ideal for the apes. Despite an uneasy Winter asserting that the apes should leave immediately, Caesar decides they need to prepare first. That night, the Colonel leads a team of soldiers in infiltrating the apes' home, where he kills Blue Eyes and Caesar's wife Cornelia. Upon discovering this, Caesar attempts to prevent the Colonel's escape but fails. Afterward, the apes are unable to find Winter, who they believe betrayed them out of fear.  In the morning, the tribe gathers to journey to safety. Leaving his youngest son, Cornelius, in the care of Blue Eyes' wife Lake, Caesar departs to exact revenge while serving as the decoy for the other apes. Accompanied by Rocket, his orangutan adviser Maurice, and his gorilla lieutenant Luca, the apes enter a seemingly abandoned village, where they come upon a soldier who deserted the Colonel's army. Caesar kills him in self-defense. They then discover a mute girl, who Maurice befriends and adopts, giving her a small rag doll. They then find Winter at a beachside military camp, having become a "donkey". They confront Winter, who tells Caesar that the Colonel departed for the border, to meet more soldiers. Winter then attempts to call out for help, but the other apes restrain him, and Caesar accidentally suffocates him. While following the military, the apes discover soldiers who have been shot and left for dead. Their examination of a surviving soldier reveals that he is mute like the girl. Caesar then kills him in an act of mercy.  Later, the apes give chase after a hooded figure who stole one of their horses and are surprised to discover he is an intelligent ape from another zoo, named Bad Ape. While camping with Bad Ape, they discover that he knows where the border is and he hesitantly agrees to lead them there. The group reaches the border, where they see a quarantine facility. While attempting to get a closer look, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from some soldiers. An angered Caesar decides to proceed alone rather than continue to endanger his allies. While there, however, Caesar learns that Alpha-Omega captured his tribe and are forcing them to build a wall without food or water. Caesar is then captured by Red, who brings him to the Colonel. He is forced to work with the other apes, and when he inspires them to stop working, the Colonel threatens to kill Caesar to get the apes to continue.  Caesar deduces that the Colonel is barricading the facility to fend off other military forces who are against him for killing his own soldiers. The Colonel informs Caesar that the Simian Flu virus had mutated, and the human carriers subsequently became mute and [[Devolution (biology)|devolved]] into a primitive state. He then has Caesar tortured with starvation to force the other apes to work. The mute girl, named Nova by Maurice, sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her rag doll. To prevent her from being discovered, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion. The next day, the Colonel comes to see if Caesar is still alive, and confiscates the doll upon discovering it. Together, Caesar and Rocket are able to work out a means of escape via an underground tunnel leading out of the facility. Though the plan is successful, Caesar remains behind to confront the Colonel as the facility comes under attack by remnants of the military, who attack with jeeps, tanks, helicopters, ground troops and rocket launchers. Caesar finds the Colonel infected by the virus via contact with Nova's doll. Caesar chooses not to kill the Colonel, instead watching him commit [[suicide]].  The escaping apes are caught in the crossfire between the two armies while Red watches uncertainly. Caesar attempts to blow up a large fuel tank to take out the Alpha-Omega forces from behind, but he is shot with a [[crossbow]] by Preacher. Red then uses a [[grenade launcher]] to kill Preacher and save Caesar's life before he is shot dead by a soldier. Caesar succeeds in blowing up the tank and escapes the facility as it is consumed in a cascade of explosions, which then triggers an [[avalanche]] that wipes out the military. The apes, carrying Nova, all survive by climbing nearby trees. They then cross the desert to find an [[oasis]]. While the other apes celebrate their new home, Maurice discovers Caesar's fatal wound. He promises to tell Cornelius who his father was and what he did for the apes. Caesar then dies peacefully while Maurice mourns his death and the other apes look on.

War Machine (film)
 In the summer of 2009, [[Four-star rank|four-star General]] Glen McMahon (Brad Pitt), having won renown for his effective leadership in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], is sent to [[Afghanistan]] to prepare an assessment so that the government can end the ongoing [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war]].<ref></ref><ref></ref> He is given wide latitudes to write it, on the sole condition that he not request more troops. McMahon and his staff, particularly his right hand man Major General Greg Pulver (Anthony Michael Hall), are united in their belief that the war can be won, and decide to recommend that [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] authorize a surge of 40,000 additional troops to secure [[Helmand province]] in order to stabilize the country. However, the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] (Sian Thomas) informs McMahon that his report will not be reviewed until after the upcoming presidential election.  Captain Badi Basim (Aymen Hamdouchi), a member of the [[Afghan National Army]], joins McMahon's staff as a "representative" of the Afghan people. He arrives, however, in civilian clothes as he would rather not wear his uniform, which he has in a bag. Meanwhile, McMahon is informed that, due to alleged irregularities in the counting of votes, a runoff election will have to be held, delaying the review of the assessment further. Fed up, McMahon secretly leaks the assessment to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and organizes an interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', during which he reveals that, in the last seventy days, he has only been granted one meeting with the President. In response, the government announces that they will send 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, and that all U.S. and coalition forces in the country will leave in 18 months. To gather the remaining 10,000 troops needed for his strategy to work, McMahon and his men head to [[Paris]] to negotiate with the other coalition nations.  In Paris, McMahon learns that the President is passing through, and wishes to meet with him. The ambassador to Afghanistan ([[Alan Ruck]]) warns McMahon that he needs to understand his position: if he continues to anger the President, he will be fired for insubordination. The President, however, merely shakes his hand as he climbs aboard [[Air Force One]] due to time constraints, and McMahon and his staff attend a dinner in McMahon's honor, accompanied by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Sean Cullen ([[Scoot McNairy]]), who intends to write a feature story about his performance for an upcoming issue. The next day, during their anniversary dinner, McMahon's wife Jeanie confronts him about how much time he's spending fighting abroad instead of being with his family back home.  While en route to [[Berlin]] with McMahon's staff to continue negotiations, Cullen observes their behavior and concludes that they are arrogant and seem to care little about the growing public perception that the war is costly and wasteful. At a conference to discuss his strategy, McMahon is confronted by a German official ([[Tilda Swinton]]) who is skeptical of his approach and suggests that McMahon's plans would only lead to more losses. Nevertheless, both the Germans and the French agree to furnish the troops needed for his planned offensive, codenamed "[[Operation Moshtarak]]", to begin, with Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]]'s ([[Ben Kingsley]]) approval.  The operation launches, but soon runs into trouble when several civilians are accidentally killed against McMahon's instructions. When he holds a public meeting to explain the incident, the crowd grows hostile and demands that he and his troops leave. Worse, McMahon learns that Cullen's article has been published, and paints a negative picture of him and his staff as openly speaking against the President and mishandling the war effort. Knowing that he will be fired for his actions, McMahon returns to Washington and later takes a job as a civilian consultant.  In the aftermath, Cullen ponders the consequences of his article, noting that he wished McMahon's fall would finally convince the government to stop invading foreign countries and end the war in Afghanistan. Instead, however, the government simply assigns a new general to replace McMahon: General Bob White ([[Russell Crowe]]).  
The Wall (2017 film)
 During the [[Iraq War]], U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews ([[John Cena]]) is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his [[Sniper#Sniper teams|spotter]], Sergeant Allen Isaac ([[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]]).  The pair patiently wait 22 hours on [[Overwatch_(military_tactic)|overwatch]] before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process.  Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to the mythical [[Juba (sniper)|Juba]] mentioned earlier in the film, a [[nom de guerre]] for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.   Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.   Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of a rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.   Isaac hears the rescue helicopters coming, so he pushes down the wall and uses Matthews' rifle to try and kill Juba, or at least flush him out so the rescue chopper can see the trap. Juba fires at Issac twice and misses. Issac now has the snipers location and fires his only round. Issac stands up and waits for Juba's next shot, but it never comes. The helicopters land and the rescue team picks up Isaac and Matthews.  Once the helicopters dust off, the sniper successfully shoots down both in rapid succession. He is then heard over the radio, calling for another rescue to set a new trap.

What Happened to Monday
  Around the year 2043, [[overpopulation]] has caused a worldwide crisis, resulting in a strict, [[one-child policy]] enforced by the Child Allocation Bureau. When multiple children are born to one mother, all but the eldest are put into cryosleep. All citizens are tracked by electronic bracelets. Karen Settman dies while giving birth to identical-septuplet sisters. Their grandfather, Terrence, names them after the days of the week and trains them to pose as a single individual named after their mother, leaving the house only on the day of their name. To safeguard their secret, Terrence ensures they share information daily and replicate any physical accidents that alter appearance. The sisters use wigs and makeup to cover any identifying features, with Terry even going as far to keep them safe by amputating the first finger of each sister after Thursday injures herself.  Years later in 2073, as Sunday returns from the sisters' job at a bank, she sees C.A.B. agents detain a child as onlookers protest. The siblings watch the recorded incident and debate turning themselves in, but not seriously. The following day, Monday prepares her disguise as Karen, nervous about giving a presentation. At a checkpoint, Monday runs into Adrian Knowles, a C.A.B. agent who flirts with her. At the bank, Monday's co-worker, Jerry, a competitor for the promotion, hints at [[blackmail|blackmailing]] her.  When Monday fails to return home, Tuesday retraces her steps. Tuesday learns that Monday got the promotion and met Jerry at a bar. Before she can investigate further, C.A.B. agents detain her and cut off her communications. In the CAB facility, Adrian sees Tuesday being escorted to a cell, where she meets Nicolette Cayman, head of the Bureau and a candidate for parliament. Cayman explains that she knows about Tuesday's siblings, and, when Tuesday offers a bribe, Cayman reveals Monday offered the same deal. Cayman orders C.A.B. agents to assassinate Tuesday's sisters.  C.A.B. agents use a severed eye to bypass a retinal scanner at the Settman home. Thursday ambushes the agents as they arrest the other siblings. The sisters kill the agents, but Sunday dies. Learning the eye is Tuesday's, the sisters suspect Jerry may have sold them out. The next day, Wednesday leaves without disguising herself and confronts Jerry. He reveals that "Karen" got the promotion when she sent millions of euros to Cayman to fund her campaign. After a C.A.B. sniper kills him, Wednesday flees Jerry's apartment.  The others remotely guide Wednesday to safety but are interrupted when Adrian shows up at the sisters' apartment, concerned about "Karen." They deduce that Adrian has been having a long-term sexual relationship with one of the sisters, and Thursday convinces Saturday to leave with him. Saturday, pretending to be Karen, has sex with Adrian at his apartment and covertly links their bracelets, allowing Friday to hack into the C.A.B. On a video feed, the sisters believe they have found Monday in a holding cell. Meanwhile, C.A.B. agents corner and kill Wednesday. After Adrian leaves his apartment, C.A.B. agents kill Saturday as she tells them Monday was dating Adrian. The sisters' apartment are raided simultaneously by a C.A.B. squad led by Joe. Admitting that she cannot survive on her own, Friday [[Altruistic suicide|sacrifices herself]] to allow Thursday to escape and rescue Monday.  Adrian hears about the incident and rushes back to the Settman apartment. Thursday confronts him, blaming him for her sisters' deaths. Adrian now realizes "Karen" is an assumed identity for several siblings, and claims to love Monday. Thursday reveals to Adrian that Monday is still alive, and he agrees to help her. Adrian sneaks Thursday into C.A.B. headquarters in a body bag. While in the bag, she secretly records a child undergoing cryosleep. Instead of being frozen, the child is incinerated. After overpowering the guards, Adrian and Thursday proceed to rescue Monday. However, when they reach her prison cell, they discover Tuesday inside. They deduce that Monday has sold them out to Cayman.  As Cayman hosts a fundraiser, Thursday shoots Monday and leaves her for dead while Tuesday and Adrian broadcast Thursday's video footage. The crowd turns on Cayman, who insists that she only did what was necessary. Monday staggers into the fundraiser but Joe shoots her, thinking that she intended to kill Cayman. Adrian shoots Joe in turn. As the crowd flees, a dying Monday reveals to the others that she is pregnant and makes Thursday promise to not let the C.A.B. take her unborn children. In the aftermath, the Child Allocation Act is repealed and Cayman faces the death penalty. Thursday, Adrian, and Tuesday watch Monday's and Adrian's twins develop in an artificial womb. Tuesday and Thursday rename themselves Terry and Karen, respectively.

FBI special agent Jane Banner arrives to investigate a possible [[homicide]]. The next day, Jane learns from Natalie's father, Martin, that his daughter was dating a new boyfriend, but he does not know the man's name or whereabouts. The autopsy shows blunt trauma and sexual violence and confirms Cory's deduction that the girl died from exposure, specifically [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] caused by rapid inhalation of sub-zero air. However, the medical examiner is unable to confirm the death as a homicide, therefore preventing Jane from calling in an additional FBI investigative unit.  Cory discovers that Natalie's boyfriend is Matt Rayburn who works security at a nearby oil drilling site. The next day, Matt's body is discovered, nude and heavily ravaged by scavenging wildlife. Cory tells Jane about his daughter's death three years earlier, whose body was discovered in the snow, following a party while he and his wife were away.  Jane, accompanied by Tribal Police Chief Ben Shoyo and additional officers, visit the drill site where they meet with several of the security guards. They report that Matt stormed off a few days ago following an argument with Natalie and has not been seen since. One guard mentions that they heard about Natalie's body being found by monitoring law enforcement radio channels. Jane points out that Natalie's name was not given out. One of the police officers notices that the security guards are slowly surrounding Jane and her team. The confrontation quickly escalates into an armed standoff as they argue over who has jurisdiction. Jane defuses the situation by asserting federal authority. She asks to see where Matt was bunking, and they resume their approach to the trailer.  A [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] then depicts Natalie in bed with Matt in his trailer. Unexpectedly, his security colleagues barge into the trailer after a night of hard drinking. Pete, a particularly vulgar crew member, taunts them and tries to sexually assault Natalie, which provokes Matt to violence. The guards retaliate by beating Matt down while Pete rapes Natalie. Matt's attempt to fight back gives Natalie an opportunity to escape, but the group bludgeon him to death.  Back in the present, Cory has retraced the tracks from where Matt's corpse was found back to the drilling camp. Meanwhile, Jane and the police approach the drill crew's sleeping quarters. Cory, standing at a distance on a hill above the camp and looking down at the group, radios a warning to Ben but not before Jane, wearing a bullet-proof vest, is hit in the chest by a shotgun blast fired through the door by Pete, wounding her. A firefight ensues, in which Ben and the other officers are killed. As the surviving security guards prepare to execute Jane, Cory picks them off with his rifle, except for Pete, who, though wounded, flees on foot. Cory catches Pete and takes him up a mountain top. After forcing Pete's confession, Cory offers him the same chance Natalie had: a barefooted escape toward a distant road wearing light-weight clothing. Pete runs through the snow but quickly succumbs as his lungs give out from the same pulmonary hemorrhage that killed Natalie.  Cory visits Jane in the hospital and praises her toughness. He later visits Martin, finding him sitting outside his house wearing his "death face" paint and holding a handgun. Cory tells Martin that the case is closed and that the man responsible for Natalie's death went out, "with a whimper." They share grief over their daughters' deaths.  A title card states that missing-persons statistics are kept for every demographic group except for Native American women, whose numbers remain unknown.

At first, Auggie is ostracized by nearly the entire student body, but he soon becomes best friends with a boy named Jack Will ([[Noah Jupe]]), who was his welcome buddy, along with Julian Albans (Bryce Gheisar), the school bully, and Charlotte Cody (Elle McKinnon).  During [[Halloween]], Auggie wears an old [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] mask and costume because his dog, Daisy ([[Gidget (dog)|Gidget]]), threw up on his "[[Boba Fett]]" costume. Unrecognized, he walks around school knowing he would not get tormented while incognito. As he walks through the door to his homeroom, he overhears Jack telling Julian and his friends, Amos Conti (Ty Consiglio), Miles Noury ([[Kyle Harrison Breitkopf]]), and Henry Joplin ([[James A. Hughes]]), that he was "only pretending to be friends with Auggie". Feeling betrayed, Auggie wants to stay home during [[trick-or-treating]], but his older sister, Olivia "Via" (Izabella Vidovic), talks him out of it.  The next day at lunch, Auggie confides the incident to another friend, a girl named Summer Dawson ([[Millie Davis]]), but swears her to secrecy and starts to avoid Jack. Jack, noticing what's going on, asks Summer why, but she only gives him one clue by saying "Ghost Face" before heading off to class. In science class, Jack is shocked when it dawns on him that it was Auggie wearing the Ghost Face costume, and thus had overheard everything he said to Julian, Amos, Miles, and Henry. When Julian calls Auggie a "freak", Jack angrily punches him in the face and a fight ensues between the two, which is soon broken up by their homeroom teacher, Mr. Browne ([[Daveed Diggs]]) and another teacher.

During the rest of the school year, Julian and his friends bully Auggie; they leave hurtful and threatening notes on his desk, and tape their class picture to his locker with Auggie photoshopped out. Mr. Tushman confronts Julian and his parents ([[Crystal Lowe]]) and ([[Steve Bacic]]) using all the evidence; Julian's mother proclaims that she had Auggie edited out of the photo so her friends could ask about Julian instead of Auggie and his family. She then says that the students should not be exposed to Auggie. Despite her threats to pull both Julian and their funding from the school, Tushman suspends Julian for two days, along with making him miss an upcoming nature retreat. A remorseful Julian apologizes to Tushman for his humiliating actions towards Auggie, which Tushman accepts.  Meanwhile, Via signs up for Drama Club at her high school after her best friend, Miranda Navas (Danielle Rose Russel), ignores her after her parents got a [[divorce]]; in the process, she meets Justin ([[Nadji Jeter]]), with whom she develops a close friendship which later turns into a relationship. Later, Via is selected to be an understudy for the lead role in the school's production of "[[Our Town]]", but when Miranda, who is the lead actress, pretends to fall ill after learning that Via's family is at the play, Via takes her place and gives a performance that earns her a [[standing ovation]].  During the nature retreat, when Auggie and Jack are accosted and threatened by a trio of seventh graders from another school, lead by Eddie ([[William Dickinson (actor)|William Dickinson]]).

While serving as a mercenary providing security on a freighter delivering relief supplies to Africa, he foils an attempted hijacking by Somalian pirates by defeating them in hand-to-hand combat underwater. The freighter arrives safely at its destination. For three years Feng has been carrying a bullet which he found, a clue to the kidnapping of his fiancée, Lieutenant Colonel Long Xiaoyun, that happened while she was on a mission.   Feng and some locals are partying on a beach one day when they are attacked by rebel forces aiming to overthrow the government of the African nation. Shortly after the arrival of the Rebels and mercenaries who overrun the government troops, the Chinese fleet arrives to evacuate Chinese nationals caught up in the civil war.  While on board, a Chinese shop owner that he helped rescue tells him that the bullet he is carrying belongs to European mercenaries who are helping the rebels. After overhearing guards talking about needing someone to rescue workers at a factory and an important doctor who knows the vaccination for Lamanla (Dr Chen), Leng Feng volunteers. However, he is on his own as no other personnel can follow him while they are on foreign soil without permission from the Chinese military's higher authorities. He travels to the hospital, 60 kilometres away from the dock and enters the hospital building just as Dr Chen is accidentally killed by the mercenaries. With his dying breaths Dr Chen tells him to take his daughter, an African girl named Pasha. Leng Feng and Pasha, along with a female doctor Rachel Smith, escape the grip of the mercenaries. While escaping, he cuts his hand in a pile of Lamanla infected bodies but shakes it off and moves on. They continue their mission of saving Chinese as Leng Feng also goes to save his good friend's mother, who's working in the Hanbound factory.  Upon arriving at the Hanbound factory, Feng is confronted by security and the factory's owner's son, Zhou Yifan, a cocky [[fuerdai]] who is also an army fanatic. Big Daddy's mercenaries attack the factory to capture Pasha, thinking she is the one who has the cure for Lamanla. At the factory, Feng tells everyone that the Chinese fleet will be sending a helicopter to rescue them. The women and children will evacuate via helicopter and everyone else will walk to the fleet. Feng with his old pal and Yifan saved the factory crew members from the red scarf members and deadly mercenaries. Feng is about to be killed when Big Daddy, the other mercenaries and rebels are ordered to fall back. The leader tells Big Daddy that no Chinese can die because he needs China when he is in power, since China is part of the United Nations Security Council. Big Daddy kills the leader of the rebellion and takes over as leader. He orders everyone to go back to the factory to retrieve Pasha and kill Feng. In the factory, Feng chooses to leave as the factory workers learn of his infection with Lamanla. He is injected with a cure for the virus and learns from Rachel that Dr Chen manufactured a cure using infected patients that built immunity to the virus, in this case Pasha.  Big Daddy and the others arrive at the factory to capture Pasha and kill Feng.  They round up the workers and wait for the Chinese helicopter to arrive. Feng arrives with Rachel and Pasha to rescue everyone trapped in the factory. The workers are saved and the helicopter arrives.  Pasha and Rachel leave via helicopter, but it is shot down.  The battle continues with everyone taking cover. Seeing the massive casualties taking place, the Chinese fleet fire missiles taking out the tanks.  Meanwhile in the battle while confronting Big Daddy, Feng learns that the bullet which killed his fiancée belonged to Big Daddy and, driven by rage over his fiancée's death, kills Big Daddy and saves all the crew members by taking them to UN camps.  In the [[mid-credits scene]], Feng is allowed by his commander to return to his military squadron, but is shown in a video that his fiancé Long Xiaoyun is still alive.

Meanwhile, Michael is confused as to why he has four hundred dollars more than he started with.  
Wish Upon
  Clare Shannon, a 17-year old, is haunted by the memory of her mother's suicide. Her father Jonathan, a former musician and compulsive hoarder who [[Dumpster diver|dumpster dives]] as a hobby, finds a Chinese [[music box]] and gives it to her as a gift. Clare deciphers one of the numerous inscriptions on the box as "Seven Wishes," and absent-mindedly wishes for Darcie, her tormentor and school bully, to "rot," at which point Darcie develops [[necrotizing fasciitis]] and is admitted into the ICU. That same day, Clare's dog Max dies in her house's crawlspace after seemingly being eaten alive by rats. Clare realizes that the box grants wishes, but does not understand that her wishes come with consequences.  Clare makes a second wish that a popular boy named Paul falls in love with her. As a result, her wealthy uncle dies. Upon hearing the news of his death, Clare then wishes she will be in the will.  The relative leaves everything to Clare. Consequently Mrs. Deluca, a friendly neighbor, suffers a fatal accident. Clare enlists the help of her classmate Ryan Hui to decypher the symbols. A relative of Ryan named Gina helps discover the meaning of the symbols grants seven wishes with consequences. Clare's fourth wish is for her father to stop being a dumpster diver and he immediately has a personality shift. Soon after, Gina deciphers the meaning of the phrase which says "When the music ends, the blood price is paid." After she warns Ryan, she dies. Ryan finds Gina's body and confronts Clare about making wishes on the music box, which she denies.  Clare makes a fifth wish that she is popular, but Clare is soon unhappy with the consequent attention and that she loses her relationship with her friends. As a consequence of the wish, Meredith gets stuck in an elevator and, when the cable snaps, falls to her death.  Ryan reveals that after the seventh wish is granted, the music box will claim the soul of the owner. Attempts to destroy the box are unsuccessful. Furthermore, because June has stolen the box, Clare loses her popularity and everything else she wished for. Clare recovers the box and her sixth wish is that her mother never committed suicide. Clare's mom knocks on her bedroom door along with two younger sisters. Clare later rummages through her mom’s paintings and sees a picture of the music box. She concludes that her mom was one of the previous owners of the music box and that it must have led to her original suicide.  When Clare realizes her dad pays the price for the sixth wish, Clare's seventh wish is to go back to the day her father found the box. Preventing her father from finding the box, and erasing all that has happened, Clare then asks Ryan to bury the box. Clare believes all is well but she is killed when her bully Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, in order to pay the final blood price. The music box can be heard after Clare's death, indicating that the seventh wish to reverse time would be balanced by her own death.  In a mid-credits scene, Ryan prepares to bury the music box but becomes intrigued by the inscription and starts to think.

Woodshock
 Theresa provides her terminally-ill mother with a [[Joint (cannabis)|cannibis joint]] laced with [[poison]], allowing her to commit [[assisted suicide]]. After her mother's death, she inherits her home in rural [[Northern California]]. Theresa's boyfriend, Nick, wants her to move elsewhere with him, but she insists on staying in her mother's house. Theresa returns to her job at a [[Cannabis dispensaries in the United States|cannabis dispensary]] owned by her friend Keith, but is noticeably withdrawn. She attends a house party with Keith, and talks with Johnny, a mutual friend who is younger than both of them.  One day while Theresa is working, a sick elderly man, Ed, comes into the shop to pick up the same poison-laced cannabis Theresa administered to her mother. Theresa gives him the cannabis and he leaves; aware that he is using it to commit suicide, Theresa experiences an emotional breakdown. Ed returns later in the evening, informing Theresa and Keith that the drug failed to work. In the middle of the night, Theresa receives a phone call from Keith. She meets him at a carwash, where he tells her that Johnny has died, and accuses her of accidentally selling Johnny the poison-laced cannabis intended for Ed.  Her grief now compounded by guilt, Theresa's emotional state becomes increasingly fragile, and she begins retreating to the surrounding woods for hours at a time, causing strain on her relationship with Nick. Contemplating suicide, she prepares five individual joints laced with the poison, but at first cannot bring herself to smoke them. Later that night, she goes into the woods and works up the nerve to smoke one of the joints, but it does not kill her; she awakens the next morning with scratches on her legs. She smokes a second joint in the morning, and has visions of herself walking through the wilderness. Later, she smokes the third joint, which induces powerful [[hallucination|hallucinations]], but does not kill her. When she returns to consciousness, she finds that she has dismantled a wooden fence outside the house, but has no recollection of doing so.   Later that night, Theresa meets with Keith at a local bar, and smokes a fourth joint. After, she drives to Ed's house and confesses to him how she inadvertently killed Johnny. After telling him the news, Ed dies in front of her. Upon returning home, she gets into a fight with Nick when she refuses to tell him where she has been. She eventually leaves and walks to Keith's house, visibly ill and vomiting. Keith, who perceives Theresa's guilt over the deaths of her mother and Johnny, suggests she confide in Nick. Theresa refutes the idea, and Keith threatens to call Nick on the phone. Theresa begins burning her fingertips on a hot [[clothes iron]] that Keith has left on. When he attempts to stop her, she attacks him, burning his face with the iron, and then beats him over the head with it numerous times, killing him.  Covered in blood, Theresa wanders into the woods and smokes the last of the poison-laced joints. This induces numerous visions of the landscape, during which Theresa begins [[levitation|levitating]], and ascends into the tree canopy.  
Wonder Woman (2017 film)
  In present-day [[Paris]], [[Wonder Woman|Diana]] receives a [[photographic plate]] from [[Wayne Enterprises]] of herself and four men taken during [[World War I]], prompting her to recall her past. Daughter of [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]], Diana was raised on the hidden island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], home to the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazonian]] warrior women created by [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] to protect mankind. Hippolyta shares the Amazonian history with Diana, including how [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], Zeus's son, became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat (thus dying in the process). Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the "Godkiller", to prepare them for Ares' return.  Although she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister, [[Antiope (comics)|Antiope]], train Diana, only more rigorously than any other warrior. In 1917, Diana, now a young woman, rescues American pilot Captain [[Steve Trevor]] when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by a [[Imperial German Navy|German]] [[light cruiser]] that had been pursuing Trevor. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana (by taking the bullet fired from a German sailor that was meant for Diana). Steve is interrogated with the [[Lasso of Truth|Lasso of Hestia]], and reveals that a [[World War I|great war]] is consuming the outside world and that he is an [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist [[Doctor Poison|Isabel Maru]], who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of [[mustard gas]], under the orders of General [[Erich Ludendorff]] from a weapon facility in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the "Godkiller" sword, the lasso, and her armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.  In [[London]], they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an [[armistice]] with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Sir Patrick, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in [[Belgium in World War I|Belgium]]. Diana goes alone through [[No Man's Land]] and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, while Diana and Steve grow closer romantically.  The team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby [[Oberste Heeresleitung|German High Command]]. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, while Diana intends to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills Ludendorff, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.  Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the "Godkiller" sword, he destroys it, then reveals Diana to be the "Godkiller", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself in the process. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares' lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the war]]. In the present day, Diana sends an email to [[Bruce Wayne]] thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve and reaffirms her new mission to fight and give on the world's behalf.

Woody Woodpecker (2017 film)
 In the [[Pine Grove, Washington|Pine Grove forest]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], [[Woody Woodpecker]] toys with two [[taxidermist]] poachers, brothers Nate and Ottis Grimes, and eventually cause them to tranquilize each other. In [[Seattle]], Lance Walters, a real estate lawyer, gets fired after a video of him claiming wildlife conservation is unprofitable goes viral. He tells his girlfriend Vanessa that he intends to build an investment home on a large piece of property located near the Canadian border, left to him by his grandfather. Meanwhile, Lance's ex-wife Linda leaves their son Tommy with him and Vanessa, since she needs to visit her hospitalized father in [[Philadelphia]].  At the Pine Grove forest, Lance, Tommy, and Vanessa meet the park ranger named Samantha Bartlett. As Lance and Vanessa unpack, Tommy goes into the forest for a walk. There, he discovers and befriends Woody after he gives him peanut butter crackers. Woody visits the family at lunchtime and eats almost all of the food. Lance tries to shoo Woody away, but he accidentally wrecks the table and hits Vanessa in the face with a broom. The next morning, construction on the investment home begins, prompting an agitated Woody to cause chaos at the site. Later, in a nearby town, Tommy befriends a young musician named Jill, who persuades him to join her band in the annual Firefly Festival. Tommy is then saved from two bullies by Woody.  As days pass, Lance grows more agitated because of Woody's constant interference with his project, and he goes to meet Samantha at the ranger station. She reveals that the woodpecker is an [[endangered species]] known as a red-crowned [[pileated woodpecker]], which [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] saw as a god of mischief and chaos. Lance continues with his work, but Vanessa leaves him after Woody blows up their RV with her inside as a prank. Samantha eventually advises Lance to get along with Woody. Lance reluctantly attempts to surrender to Woody by giving him crackers, but Woody agrees to let him and the workers continue with their construction, as long as he is given crackers every day. Eventually, the investment home is completed despite excessive payment and extended scheduling.  At the town's Firefly Festival, Tommy and Jill's drummer Lyle comes down with indigestion, prompting Woody to take over using a homemade drum kit. The performance is a hit, and Lance is surprised to hear that Woody gave Tommy some friendly support. Realizing that having humans around again isn't a bad idea, Woody heads back to the investment home and carves a [[mural]] above the fireplace. However, as he signs his name into the carving, he accidentally burns the house down after hitting exposed wiring. Ashamed of his mistake, he flies back to his tree. Infuriated by this, Lance hires Nate and Ottis to hunt Woody down. The brothers find him and tase him unconscious. As they leave, Tommy reprimands his father and runs away. He then forms a plan to rescue Woody and heads to Grimes' shack with Jill and Lyle, as the brothers try to sell Woody at an online [[black market]] auction.  Lance finds the mural that Woody had created. Having a change of heart, he enlists Samantha's help and they set out to find both Tommy and Woody. However, everyone is captured by the brothers. As Nate grabs a tranquilizer, Lance tilts his cage towards Woody's so he can free him. After beating the brothers, Woody chases them as they attempt to flee to Canada. He carves a hole in the middle of a bridge, and the brothers fall into the river below, where they are later arrested. Later, Lance apologizes to Woody for not knowing that the house fire was an accident and therefore replaces Woody's cut-down tree with a birdhouse. Woody accepts both the gift and the group to be called his new family, much to their generosity. That night, as Lance and Tommy fall asleep in a tent, Woody carves the words "Home Sweet Home" into the new birdhouse, only to accidentally make it topple onto the tent.

 [[National Security Agency|NSA]] Agent Augustus Gibbons attempts to recruit footballer [[Neymar|Neymar Jr.]] for the xXx program when a satellite crashes in [[Brazil]], apparently killing them both. Shortly afterwards, a team of four skilled individuals led by Xiang infiltrate a highly guarded [[CIA]] office in [[New York City]] and retrieve "[[Pandora's Box]]", a device which is capable of controlling satellites to crash at specific locations as warheads. CIA Agent Jane Marke  tracks down former xXx operative Xander Cage, [[The Final Chapter: The Death of Xander Cage|who faked his death]] and has been living in self-imposed exile in the [[Dominican Republic]], and convinces him to return to active service to retrieve the device.  In [[London]], after enlisting an old friend, Ainsley, for help, Cage tracks down the attackers to the [[Philippines]]. At an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] outpost in [[Lakenheath]], a unit of [[Special Forces]] operatives led by Paul Donovan is assigned to help Xander, but he rejects them in favour of his own team, composed of sharpshooter Adele Wolff, DJ Harvard "Nicks" Zhou, and getaway driver Tennyson "The Torch." They are also aided by [[introverted]] weapons specialist Becky Clearidge. The team locates Xiang and his teammates Serena, Talon and Hawk, and Cage meets Xiang in an underground nightclub on a remote island, where Xiang reveals that his team are also xXx agents,  recruited by Gibbons. He claims to have stolen Pandora's Box to prevent its misuse, although Serena believes they should destroy it.  Shortly after, Russian soldiers raid the island. The group manages to fend off the attackers, while Xiang manages to escape with Pandora's Box. Xander intercepts Xiang and chases him to a nearby beach. Serena betrays him, destroys the Box and joins Xander's team, while Xiang escapes and regroups with Talon and Hawk. After another satellite crash in the [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow)|Olympic Stadium in Moscow]], Marke determines that the device that Serena destroyed was only a prototype, and that both teams have been wasting time, while Cage determines that CIA Director Anderson is involved in the conspiracy and that the actual Pandora's Box is in his hands.  Cage's and Xiang's teams race to reach Anderson first in [[Detroit]], tracking the unique signal of Pandora's Box, with Xander and Xiang fighting and later protecting each other from Anderson's men. Xander confronts Anderson, who admits to causing the satellite crash that killed Gibbons. Anderson is then shot dead by Wolff. Cage reluctantly allows the CIA to arrest Xiang in an attempt to frame him for the Moscow attack, and they secure the box. En route back to headquarters, Marke announces that the xXx Program has been shut down and shoots Xander in order to keep it for herself. She then sends a group of assassins to eliminate the others, who are awaiting extraction at a local NSA warehouse. They join forces to fend off their attackers and receive assistance from another former xXx operative, Darius Stone.  Xander survives due to a bulletproof vest Becky had given him earlier and joins forces with Xiang to fight Donovan and his men, while Marke uses the box to send a satellite plummeting towards the warehouse where the teams are fighting. Xander ejects Donovan from the plane, while Xiang sends Marke falling to her death and then parachutes out with the box in hand. Despite Becky's attempts to halt the signal, they cannot stop the satellite from crashing. In a last attempt to protect them, Xander crashes the plane [[kamikaze|into the approaching satellite]] before it reaches the warehouse and jumps out, using the cargo load to safely reach the ground. Xiang gives Cage the device, and Xander decides to destroy it. The team attends Gibbons' funeral, where Xander is approached by Gibbons himself, who faked his death and is now rebuilding the xXx Program on his own, starting with Neymar as the newest recruit. Gibbons compliments Xander on a job well done and Xander decides to continue in service, ready for a new mission to watch the watchers and preserve liberty.

She finally buys a panda costume off of a man who comes to sing Lucy a birthday song, and hides the body in the costume.

The body is discovered when Carla, attempting to lift the Panda, accidentally removes the head, and the full title of the film is revealed as the children scream in terror: ''The Birthday Party, or, The Memory Lucy Suppressed From Her Seventh Birthday That Wasn't Really Her Mom's Fault (Even Though Her Therapist Says It's Probably Why She Fears Intimacy) (And It Actually Was).''.  ===Don't Fall=== Written and directed by Roxanne Benjamin  Four friends - Paul, Gretchen, Jess, and Jay - are all on an expedition out in the desert.

The Zookeeper's Wife (film)
   Dr. [[Jan and Antonina Żabiński|Jan Żabiński]] ([[Johan Heldenbergh]]) is the director of the [[Warsaw Zoo]], one of the largest and most prolific zoos in 1930s Europe. He is aided by his wife, [[Jan and Antonina Żabiński|Antonina]] ([[Jessica Chastain]]).   On September 1, 1939, the [[aerial bombardment of Warsaw]] commences as [[Invasion of Poland|German forces storm Poland]]. Bombs raze the zoo cages, killing many animals while others escape into the streets. Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) barely survive. As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. [[Lutz Heck]] ([[Daniel Brühl]]), the head of the [[Berlin Zoo]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]'s chief [[zoologist]] and Jan's professional rival, arrives at the zoo when Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals and return them to Warsaw after the war. Heck later returns with Nazi soldiers to shoot the remaining animals. It becomes evident that Heck has developed a romantic interest in Antonina.  Warsaw undergoes a monstrous upheaval as Jews are herded into the [[Warsaw Ghetto|Ghetto]]. Two of the Zabinskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel ([[Iddo Goldberg]]) and his partner Magda Gross (Efrat Dor), seek a safe place for another friend's notable insect collection. Antonina makes an unusual offer to shelter Magda in an attic closet. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Anatonia decide to use the zoo to save other lives.  Jan and Antonina seek out Heck at his Warsaw headquarters to propose turning the abandoned zoo into a pig farm to help feed the German occupying forces. Secretly, they hope to bring food to Jews in the Ghetto. Heck needs a new site for his [[Heck cattle|experiments]], recreating [[Aurochs]], an extinct cattle breed, as a symbol of the Reich.  He agrees to the pig farm idea.  As Jan collects garbage scraps from the Ghetto to feed the pigs, he sees starving Jews. He secretly begins working with the [[Polish Underground Army|Underground Army]] to transport Jews from the Ghetto to safehouses throughout the country. Jews are sneaked into the zoo and hidden in animal cages, tunnels, and inside the Zabinski house. After some trepidation, Antonina agrees to help and uses her ability to soothe frightened animals to comfort the terrified people.   The Żabińskis continue smuggling Jews out of the Ghetto, hiding them in the zoo or disguising them as [[Aryans]] and taking them to safehouses. However, in 1942, the Germans begin deporting Jews to the [[Nazi concentration camps|death camps]]. Jan is devastated that young children are being taken to the camps, but he has no choice but to help load them into the cattle cars under the German's watch.  In 1943, two women rescued by Jan and disguised as [[Aryans]] by Antonina are arrested and executed in a Warsaw street. Several months later, after a [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|failed uprising]], the Germans announce their intention to liquidate the Ghetto. It will happen on Hitler's birthday, which also falls on the first night of [[Passover]]. While the Jews mournfully celebrate a secret [[Passover]] Seder hidden inside the zoo, the Germans burn the Ghetto, killing those left inside.  Several months later, Antonina gives birth to a baby girl, whom Ryszard names Teresa. As Heck's attraction to Antonina intensifies, she struggles to fend him off while guarding the secret "guests." Jan participates in the [[Warsaw uprising]] and is shot and captured. Antonina is given no information as to his whereabouts and fears he is dead.  In January 1945, [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|with the Soviet troops forcing the Germans to retreat]], the enemy begins evacuating Warsaw. Antonina seeks Heck's help to find Jan, but he refuses, and accuses her of resistance activity. Heck attacks Antonina in a sexual rage. She confesses that he repulses her, and he realizes she had duped him. Antonina returns to the zoo and warns her guests who escape. Magda takes baby Teresa with her as Antonina hides Ryszard in the basement, knowing Heck will return. Heck arrives in a fury with his men, barging into the villa's basement and discovering the secret drawings on the walls: yellow [[Stars of David]] and dates, and images of hidden Jewish guests drawn with animal faces.  Enraged, Heck threatens to shoot Ryszard. Antonina begs Heck to spare Ryszard but he drags him away. A shot rings out off-screen and Antonina, devastated, collapses. Ryszard suddenly returns, the victim of Heck's cruel hoax. Heck leaves the zoo for good, and Antonina and Ryszard join the march out of Warsaw, taking along the rabbit and one of Heck's test subjects, a young bison. As they leave their home and the city is liberated, they release the bison into the woods.  Four months after the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Nazi surrender]], Warsaw begins rebuilding. Antonina, Ryszard and baby Teresa return. The zoo is extensively damaged but still standing. Jerzyk, their loyal zookeeper, greets them, and they begin rebuilding the zoo.
