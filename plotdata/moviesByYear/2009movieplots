 Jai Puri ([[Akshay Kumar]]) is a [[forest ranger]] in the woods near [[Alberta, Canada]]. Jai lives in a cabin with his girlfriend Sheila ([[Ayesha Takia Azmi]]), but has been estranged from his parents, Jatin ([[Benjamin Gilani]]) and Savitri Fakri ([[Sharmila Tagore]]). Jatin is the CEO of a privately held [[Canada|Canadian]] oil company, Canoil.  Jai has a [[supernatural]] gift: he is able to enter a photograph and vividly experience the events preceding the time of the photograph. Jai is unable to understand or explain this gift, except to recall that it started when he was very young. He tries to use this gift to help people, despite the risks to his own body. He can remain in photographs only for a minute, and experiences life-threatening, stroke-like effects afterward.  Jai's father drowns in a boating accident under mysterious circumstances. Jatin was aboard his own boat, the ''Golmaal'', and was surrounded by his wife; his brother, Sunder ([[Anant Mahadevan]]); longtime friend and lawyer Anil ([[Girish Karnad]]); and Adit ([[Rushad Rana]]), Jatin's surrogate son. Eccentric former detective Habeebullah Pasha "Happi"  ([[Javed Jaffrey]]), who suffers from [[OCD]], believes Jatin may have been murdered, and that everyone on the boat at that time may have had a motive. The only clue is an 8x10 photograph of the four men, which Savitri shot a few moments before Jatin fell off the boat and had a [[hypothermia]]-induced heart attack.  Jai repeatedly uses his gift to enter the photo and experience the incident through the eyes of the four subjects in it. He picks up various clues from the viewpoint of the subject. He first uses it to see through his father's eyes and notes the suspicious behaviour of his Uncle Sunder, when he confronts him, Sunder tries to run away. Happi follows up on these clues and tries to string together a theory. As Jai looks through the eyes of his Uncle, he sees Sunder slipping pills into hi father's champagne. But Jai feels his body gradually weakening from the stress of entering the photo. He goes to hospital and when he tells the theory to Adit, he tells him to forget about it. When he goes to confront Sunder once more at his house, he is found hanged, an apparent suicide, and a mysterious party in a black [[SUV]] tries to kill Jai and Sheila. She convinced him to stop as finding his father's killer is trying into an obsession. Later, someone makes an attempt on Savitri's life. He goes to his mother's house but sees her and Anil embracing - to which they finally confess that they had feelings for each other in the past but his mother stayed loyal to his father.   Uncle Sunder so he could slip them in. Happi enlists the help of a nurse, Sally (Pia Shah), who helps with medical aide to Jai in order to help him find the killer. Jai enters the photo one last time to find the final set of clues, he looks through the eyes of the remaining two people on the boat, the last one being Adit. He sees Adit giving the pills to his Uncle Sunder so he could slip them in.   Jai is incapacitated because his body is tired. Adit realises he knows the truth and is about to kill him but Happi returns before he can do so. However, he manages to escape.  He asks Anil about what happened on the boat and he reveals that his father wanted to give the company to Jai's environment company, as this was what they had argued about in the past. So his uncles and Adit planned to kill him so they wouldn't lose their share.  Jai decides to go into the picture one more time because he knows his father saw another person. However, the real killer enters the house and burns the photograph while Jai is still inside. However, thanks to the injection Sally gave him, he manages to revive himself.

When they are on the boat, they reveal how they had convinced Adit and Sunder to participate in the scheme and how Sheila pretended to love Jai in order to get close to him and learn his habits, so once he was dead, Jeet would take over as Jai. Jeet and Sheila dump Happi's body, as well as that of their betrayed confederate Adit, into the sea, and attempt to do the same with Jai.

9 (2009 animated film)
 In [[Germany]], 1930, a [[scientist]] ([[Alan Oppenheimer]]) is ordered by his [[dictator]] ([[Tom Kane]]) to create a robot in the apparent name of progress. The scientist uses his own intellect to create the B.R.A.I.N., a highly intelligent robot without a soul. Upon completion, however, the dictator quickly seizes it and turns it into the Fabrication Machine, an armature that can construct an army of war machines to destroy the dictator's enemies. Lacking a soul, the Fabrication Machine decides to exterminate all of [[Earth's population]]. The Fabrication Machine reprograms the other war machines to attack humanity, wiping out all plant, animal and microbial life with toxic gas and chemical weapons. On the verge of destruction, the scientist uses [[alchemy]] to create nine [[homunculus]]-like rag dolls known as "stitchpunks", giving them portions of his own soul via a talisman he created. He dies upon completion of the final doll.  Some time later, the final stitchpunk, 9 ([[Elijah Wood]]), awakens in the scientist's workshop. Taking the talisman with him, 9 ventures into the devastated city and meets 2 ([[Martin Landau]]), a frail inventor who gives him a working voice box and is surprised to see the talisman. The last active machine, the Cat-Beast, attacks the pair and abducts both 2 and the talisman. 9 collapses, but awakens in Sanctuary, the tower of a dilapidated [[cathedral]] that is home to other Stitchpunks: the dogmatic leader 1 ([[Christopher Plummer]]), his large bodyguard 8 ([[Fred Tatasciore]]), the cycloptic engineer 5 ([[John C. Reilly]]), and the mentally unstable [[oracle]] 6 ([[Crispin Glover]]). 1 immediately declares 2 as dead, but 9, having seen the condemned [[factory]] where the Cat-Beast took him, decides to rescue him. 9 and 5 venture to the factory where they find 2. The Cat-Beast attacks the trio, but are saved by the warrior 7 ([[Jennifer Connelly]]). 9, drawn by curiosity, connects the talisman to the derelict Fabrication Machine, reviving it, and it subsequently kills 2 by sucking out his soul. 9, 5, and 7 manage to escape the factory.  7 takes 9 and 5 to an abandoned [[library]], where the silent scholar twins, 3 and 4, show 9 the Fabrication Machine's origins. 5 realizes the talisman's symbols match the clairvoyant drawings of 6. 9 and 5 return to Sanctuary to investigate, but 1 intervenes and reprimands them for disobeying his orders. Meanwhile, the Fabrication Machine assembles new robotic creatures; one of them, the bird-like Winged Beast, attacks Sanctuary, leading to a battle between it and the stitchpunks. The stitchpunks win, defeating the Winged Beast, but lose their safehouse due to a fire caused during the battle.  As the group retreats to the library, 6, 3, and 4 cryptically explain the talisman's origins. Meanwhile, the Fabrication Machine retrieves 2's corpse and uses it as a hypnotic lure for another one of its robot creatures, the snake-like Seamstress. The Seamstress attacks the library and captures both 7 and 8, but 2's body is recovered and given a funeral by the others. The stitchpunks then run to the factory to destroy the machines. As part of their plan, 9 goes in alone, kills the Seamstress, and rescues 7, but not before 8's soul is absorbed by the Fabrication Machine. 9 and 7 then escape while the others destroy the factory.  The stitchpunks celebrate the destruction of the factory, but the Fabrication Machine, which survived, suddenly emerges from the ruins of the factory and absorbs 5's soul. The Fabrication Machine attacks the group as they run away, and finally captures 6, who is absorbed, but not before telling 9 to go to the scientist's workshop to find answers. 9 follows 6's instructions, finding a holographic recorded message from the scientist, explaining the origins of the B.R.A.I.N., and that the Stitchpunks have his soul, making them the only hope for humanity. Following this revelation, 9 returns to his friends.  9 reunites with the other stitchpunks and decides to sacrifice himself so the others can retrieve the talisman. Having had a change of heart, 1 redeems himself by saving 9, pushing him out of the way and allowing himself to be absorbed while 9 removes the talisman. 9 activates the talisman and reabsorbs the souls taken by the Machine, resulting in its final destruction. Afterwards, 9, 7, 3, and 4 free the souls of 5, 1, 6, 2, and 8 from the talisman. Bidding farewell to their friends, they fly up into the sky. Rain then falls from the sky, the raindrops containing small flecks of glowing [[bacteria]], bringing life back into the world.

After arriving at Harihar Nagar, they settle into Govindan Kutty's old house at Harihar Nagar. Disappointed at how life has become sombre after growing up, they decide to revert to their younger selves for the rest of the trip. To jump start their "trip back to youthfulness," Mahadevan suggests that they should create problems in the neighborhood: According to him, its only with problems that one becomes youthfully energetic.    While staying at Govindan Kutty's house, they are greeted with flowers left at the doorstep with a tag reading "Maya." Immediately thinking that this is their old Maya, they go to meet her in a café. They barely miss her, but Appukuttan throws a rock and breaks her car's rear window. An anonymous woman steps out of the car. But it is not "their" Maya. They are immediately arrested. Later, "Maya" comes and gets them out of jail saying that they are her friends and didn't recognize it because she hadn't seen them in a long time. Once out, she says not to bother her anymore because of this. Maya lives right across from Govindan Kutty's house.

Thomas Kutty is not staying with the other three on that night, but he arrives the next morning. Mahadevan says a sentimental story to make Maya believe that they're not here for wrong reasons. She later comes and visits them and becomes their friend. A hilarious sequence follows.

Thomas Kutty gets kidnapped days before his wedding and his three friends are suspected. They are followed by the police. Meanwhile, Freddy Honai,son of John Honai reveals that he has Thomas kutty. When the threesome (with great difficulty) enters Freddy Honai's hiding place they find Thomas Kutty. Freddy Honai demands the box filled with money which the old Maya had given them. The 3 friends say to Freddy that they will give the box when the original owner comes in front of them. Freddy calls them to a room where a face covered man with his wheelchair by halfly burned face is sitting. Appukkuttan remembers the face that he seen the face earlier at Christina's their known Maya's house. Freddy reveals it is the person the foursome knows as John Honai, his father. The box is now in a bank with each of the foursome knowing two digits of the password. The four escape, but now Appukuttan is missing. Maya is found and chided. But she tells her story full of dire circumstances. The correct code for the box sounds faulty. It seems that Appukuttan who is in the hands of Honai has forgotten his two digits.  After a lot of twists and turns they confround Honai who has a time bomb attached to his pet Lousie, a clinging lizard. The time bomb comically gets caught over each person. But then things get serious. The time bomb gets caught on Thomas kutty and Honai presses the ignition to burst in 30 seconds. Thomas Kutty runs to Honai in the last few seconds and pushes Honai and himself into the next room. The bomb explodes and Thomas Kutty fakes his death and Honai gets killed.  In the end, the other three friends eventually find out that Thomas Kutty is alive and was cheating them the whole time. Everything that happened thus far was a plan made by Thomas Kutty to get the box of money for himself.

After Fisher recovers, Jackson says he is launching a game of revenge called "12 Rounds." The house, the car, and Phil, the plumber who came to fix a pipe were "Round 1." Molly Porter, Fisher’s girlfriend is kidnapped by Jackson for "Round 2." For "Round 3," Fisher and Carver must follow a series of clues to locate the cell phone that Jackson calls, and for "Round 4" Fisher has to get to New Orleans Savings and Loan where a fire has broken out and extract two security deposit boxes within 20 minutes.  Carver has a lead on the man who helped kidnap Molly Porter and volunteers to look into that while Fisher continues with the game. FBI Special Agents George Aiken and Ray Santiago work with them to get Porter back.  For "Round 5" one of the security boxes is a bomb and the other contains a clue to the next round. Fisher discovers and disposes of the bomb. The other box contains a hotel room key. The room is raided and found empty. For "Round 6," Fisher follows a series of clues to a bus where he finds Porter on board, wearing a bomb underneath her jacket. He is handcuffed to a bar and is given an envelope with a phone number as the clue to the next round. The Feds try to get Jackson but he escapes with Porter. When Fisher is freed, he tells the Feds about the bomb. Carver shows up and tells Fisher he has located Jackson's henchman, Anthony Deluso.

Another detective, Chuck Jansen calls Fisher to tell him that the numbers in the envelope were rigged to the streetcar. Jackson had cameras monitoring the elevator shaft and set off the bomb five seconds early. Fisher realizes that Willie's death in the elevator episode was orchestrated by Jackson. Santiago does a check on Willie and finds he had a second job as a Homewood Security guard. They figure out that Jackson was leading them to take out the power because Homewood Security comes in to move the federally unprotected cash from the United States Mint in New Orleans. Jackson's grudge against Fisher was only a cover for his scheme to steal this money.  Aiken tells Santiago to lock down the Mint, while he and Fisher go after Porter. Fisher realizes that "Round 12" is a wild-goose chase, since Jackson needs Porter, a nurse, to help him escape. Jackson, dressed as a security guard, steals the cash. He uses Porter's ID card to get to a Medevac chopper on a hospital roof, transporting the money inside a body bag. Fisher and Aiken race to the hospital roof, where Aiken is wounded. Jackson activates the touch phone-bomb and throws the switch away. Porter and Fisher jump into a pool, while Jackson is left in the exploding helicopter.

500 Days of Summer
   On January 8, Tom Hansen meets Summer Finn, his boss's new assistant. Tom is trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. After discovering they have a similar taste in music, they have a conversation about love at a [[karaoke]] night; Tom believes in it, but Summer does not. Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie drunkenly reveals that Tom likes Summer, which Tom asserts is only "as friends", something Summer agrees with. A few days later, Summer kisses Tom in the copy room at work. During the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer.  Tom shows Summer his favorite spot in the city, which overlooks a number of buildings he likes, though the view is somewhat spoiled by parking lots. After several months of dating, both Tom's friends and his preteen half-sister Rachel push him to question Summer where they are in their relationship, though Summer brushes this off, saying that it should not matter if they are both happy. One night, Tom gets into a fight with a man who tries to pick up Summer in a bar, which causes their first argument. They make up and Summer concedes Tom deserves some certainty, but that his demand that she promises to always feel the same way about him would be impossible for anyone to make.  On day 290, they are hanging out in a cafe. Tom wants to go back to Summer's place but she insists on seeing ''[[The Graduate]]'' and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he'd always thought it was a romantic fairy tale. They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost interest in Tom, and kisses him good night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Summer wants them to remain friends, but Tom is devastated.  Summer quits her job at the greeting card company. Tom's boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is making him unsuitable for happier events. Tom goes on a blind date with a woman named Alison. The date does not go well as he spends it complaining about Summer until an exasperated Alison ends up taking Summer's side. Months later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. They have a good time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet. She invites Tom to a party at her apartment and falls asleep on Tom's shoulder on the train ride back. He attends the party hoping to rekindle their relationship but barely gets to talk to Summer and spends most of the night drinking alone, until he spots her engagement ring. Tom leaves, close to tears. He enters a deep depression, only leaving his apartment for alcohol and junk food. After a few days, he returns to work with a hangover and, after an emotional outburst, quits his job. Rachel tells Tom that she does not believe Summer was "the one" and that his depression is being worsened by the fact that he is only looking back on the positive aspects of their relationship.  One day he suddenly finds the energy to get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. She explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.  Twelve days later, on Wednesday, May 23, Tom attends a job interview and meets a girl who is also applying for the same job. He finds that she shares his favorite spot and dislike for the parking lots. As he is entering the interview, he invites her for coffee afterwards. She politely declines, then changes her mind. Her name is Autumn.

.303 (film)
 In spring or summer of 1943, a plane full of allied soldiers from the [[United Kingdom]] comes to invade [[Axis powers|Axis]]-controlled [[Sicily]], [[Italy]]. One of them, Private Atkins, is given a custom engraved [[.303 British|.303 calibre cartridge]] by his friend, Private Mattocks, which is supposed to bring him luck. The brass casing seems to be engraved with the name "EMMA", who is, apparently, a sweetheart of Atkins or Mattocks. They parachute into the streets, which are deserted with the exception of a child and [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] soldiers. Atkins' parachute is tangled on a bridge and he is left dangling on the ground, with his No. 4 Mk. 1 [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE]] rifle with extra magazines and clips of ammunition laying on the ground below. Atkins is able to cut himself free, but only has enough time to collect his rifle and hide before a vehicle filled with Nazi soldiers arrives. Seeing the remains of his parachute and sensing that he is still around, they seize his ammunition and split up to go find Atkins. Terrified and confused, Atkins explores the town square and finds the corpse of another British soldier on a staircase, taking a few clips of .303-calibre ammunition for his own rifle. However, before he can grab more, he is surprised by a German soldier with a [[Mauser Kar 98k]]. The two soldiers have a brief but intense shootout that ends with Atkins running out of ammunition. However, he remembers the engraved .303 round given to him by Private Mattocks, his good luck charm. Atkins loads the cartridge into his rifle and aims at the landing, as soon as he sees movement, shoots and kills the other soldier. He goes over to the landing and finds that his friend Private Mattocks had really shot the German, and that he had just shot his friend with the very round that was supposed to bring him luck. Private Mattocks dies in agony from a gunshot wound to his throat as a heartbroken Atkins watches and attempts to stop the bleeding. He takes off his helmet to mourn his dead friend, unsure of what to do next. While he is doing this, another German soldier comes up from behind him and shoots him in the back repeatedly with an [[MP40]] [[submachine gun]]. The same Sicilian boy seen at the beginning of the short film witnesses the act, and the German soldier gives him a chocolate bar.

2081 (film)
 The film takes place in the [[dystopia]]n American society of the year 2081, in which all individual inequality has been erased by the fictional 211th, 212th, and 213th [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|Amendments to the Constitution]] and the "unceasing vigilance of the United States Handicapper General", after that [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet office]] was created to ensure a "golden age of equality" in the United States. Exceptionalness in the world is destroyed in the name of equality, achieved through the use of "handicaps"—physical devices used to nullify every inborn advantage any person might have over another: "The strong wear weights, the beautiful wear masks, and the intelligent wear earpieces that fire off loud noises to keep them from taking unfair advantage of their brains."<ref name="Aboutfilm">[http://www.finallyequal.com/about_the_film.html ''2081'' – About the Film] Finallyequal.com retrieved 2008-08-19</ref>  Following closely with Vonnegut's original story, ''2081'' begins with George and Hazel Bergeron—parents of the exceptionally strong, intelligent, handsome Harrison Bergeron—sitting in their living room, watching [[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|the ballet]] on television. George carries many "handicaps", wearing an earpiece and heavy weights to counteract his intelligence and strength, respectively. Hazel, being perfectly average and capable of only carrying thoughts in "short bursts", wears none.  Six years prior, Harrison was taken in a raid on their home by a [[SWAT]] team from the office of the Handicapper General. Sitting in his sofa, George tries to think about the event, but cannot quite bring himself to recall exactly what happened  between the painful intermittent bursts sent through his earpiece. He continues to watch the ballet, instead. The ballet is interrupted by a government [[Breaking news|news report]] being read by a [[News presenter|news anchor]] with a severe [[Speech disorder|speech impediment]] about the escaped fugitive Harrison Bergeron. George watches the report with a hint of interest. The report concludes and returns to the regularly scheduled ballet, featuring delicate ballerinas heavily weighed down to ensure that they are only as graceful as the average person. Just then, loud stomps can be heard approaching the stage, as the ballerinas cower in terror. Harrison Bergeron marches down the aisle and leaps onto the stage with a heavy thud, almost unhindered by the weight of his massive handicaps. In a deviation from Vonnegut's story, he begins his address to the audience in the theater and those watching at home by claiming to have a bomb under the stage, the detonator to which he holds in his hand. The audience listens to his address in shock as he peels off his handicaps and chooses a volunteer ballerina to do the same. He takes her hand, and for a few brief moments, the two dance, unhindered, as the audience watches, mystified by the pair's unbridled grace and elegance.  The enforcers of the Handicapper General, keen to keep this display under wraps, surround the theater and quickly cut the video feed to the television audience as the Handicapper General herself marches down the aisle with a shotgun. On cue, Harrison pushes the button of his "detonator", which rather than detonating the dummy bomb under the stage, sends a signal to a device that overrides the video block, reminiscent of [[John Galt]]'s broadcast in [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.<ref name=Cline></ref>  He looks into the camera with a proud but slightly somber grin. George smiles back at the television. Unaware that the video feed is again being broadcast, the Handicapper General fires the shotgun, killing Harrison and his ballerina. The SWAT team leader, having been unable to stop her before she fired, informs her of their mistake. In surprise and embarrassment, she looks around in realization that this gruesome, atrocious act of oppression has been broadcast for all to see. George stares heartbrokenly into the television as the signal is again blocked, until his train of thought is again broken by the screeching of his headset; true to Vonnegut's telling of the story,<ref name="rsf" /> the gravity of the moment is lost on them, and they slip back into normalcy.

Accidents Happen
 In 1974, the Conway family are at a drive-in theater in Connecticut watching ''The Three Stooges''. The parents are Gloria (Geena Davis), a foul-mouthed and strict mother who will always take responsibility over the family, Ray (Joel Tobeck), an easy-going father, and siblings Linda, Gene, Larry ([[Harry Cook (actor)]]), and Billy (Harrison Gilbertson), who is an accident-prone child. In the meantime, the Conway's neighbor, Douglas "Doug" Post (Sebastian Gregory), whom Gloria hates and often calls him names because he is the one who causes problems that could be offensive towards the family, drives by on his bike, and Gene leads him up to the top of the drive-in screen. Gene then proceeds to urinate out of the screen. While an infuriated Gloria trips as she approaches the screen, the police are dispatched to handle the situation as infuriated and confused guests honk at Gene and Doug. While driving back home, an argument over the incident causes their car to collide with a pick-up truck during the rainy night. Although Gloria, Ray, Billy, and Larry only suffer minor injuries, Linda is killed and Gene is severely injured with severe brain damage (that could be fatal in a matter of time) and is left paralyzed from the head down.  In 1982, eight years after the accident, Ray is divorced and  more problems arise not only concerning about Doug, but also about Gene's severe condition, as he could die in any day or any month. Fifteen-year-old Billy is still friends with Doug even after the accident. One night, an argument occurs over a TV dinner with Larry, now a belligerent and profane alcoholic. Billy accidentally knocks over the dinner and it lands on him, burning his back. When Doug overhears what is going on, he intervenes and gets into a short scuffle with Larry, as Billy blames his brother for the burn on his back. After streaking and robbing a convenience store, Billy and Doug are playing when he causes an almighty crash with a bowling ball and a moving car, actually killing Doug's father by accident.<ref></ref> Just a few days after the incident, Larry's incessant harassment causes Billy to fight against his older brother, and when Gloria breaks up the scuffle and discovers a gauze on Billy's back (after Billy knocked the TV dinner and injured himself, and on the newspapers regarding the robbery that Billy was wearing the gauze), Larry immediately tells her that Billy and Doug went streaking and stealing things as evidence, but is still taken away by Ray, who came to cause another argument with Gloria over their divorce. Because Billy has no way to hide any of the evidence, an incensed Gloria reprimands and admonishes him, restricting him from seeing Doug permanently. Although she knows what Billy and Doug did, Gloria does not know what really happened at the car crash.  When Doug receives a mistaken note that his father committed suicide and that the insurance company does not pay for suicide, they decide that it is time to confess to the police of what really happened. When Billy tells this to Gloria, she describes him as a selfish son and she slaps him across the face in disbelief and breaks down in tears. As the police interrogate Billy and Doug, the family receive word that Gene had finally died. It is then revealed that when Doug attended Gene's funeral, Gloria had forgiven him for what happened. The movie ends when Billy takes the bowling ball that was found after the fatal accident and roles it down the sidewalk as Billy looks on.  
Accident (2009 film)
  In the opening scene, a man is killed in what appears to be an accident. However, it is revealed that the man was actually murdered, with the supposed accident actually orchestrated by a group of killers led by the Brain (Louis Koo). The group specializes in killing their victims using elaborate schemes that mask the murders as if they were accidents. Uncle (Stanley Fung), one of the team members, accidentally leaves a cigarette butt at the crime scene, and it is found by the Brain. After an argument, Uncle vows to quit smoking afterwards.  The team then gets a job from a son that wants to kill his own father, likely for insurance money. They plan an accident to kill their target via electrocution, but the plan requires for it be to raining at a specific time. The team tries to execute their plan many times but fail due to the rain falling later than necessary. During one run, Uncle smokes a cigarette and begins to show signs of Alzheimer's disease, forgetting that he made a vow to stop smoking. However, the rain falls on time, and the team decides to go forth with their plan. Uncle forgets to play his part in the murder, but the murder is successfully executed nonetheless.  Unexpectedly, after the murder, a bus loses control and almost runs over the Brain. The Brain manages to get out of the bus's path, but the bus then runs over Fatty (Lam Suet), another member of the team, killing him on the scene. The Brain takes Fatty's belongings, with Fatty asking the Brain whether it really was an accident before he dies. The Brain then returns home to find police officers investigating his flat, which was broken into.  The Brain becomes paranoid and is convinced that everything was a setup. He trails the son to an insurance company the next day. The Brain sees the son arguing with an insurance agent (Richie Jen) over what appears to be money, leading the Brain to suspect that the insurance agent was behind the bus accident. The Brain rents a flat on the floor directly below the insurance agent's flat, and begins to perform secret surveillance on the agent.  One day, the Brain trails the client to find the Woman (Michelle Ye) picking up the payment for the job at a parking garage. However, only Fatty and the Brain should have known about the pickup. The Woman explains to the Brain that Fatty had told her about the client, but the Brain, suspecting her betrayal, kills her and takes the money. After he leaves, as he is walking on the sidewalk, the client (the son) falls from the roof of the same building and is dead. The Brain develops further suspicion of the insurance agent, who he can see talking on the phone and later hear him talking about the client on the phone in his flat.  In a later date, the Brain receives a call from Uncle for help. However, the Brain is too late and finds Uncle severely injured, apparently dropping two stories from a building near the crime scene in the opening scene. The Brain decides to take revenge against the insurance agent and devises a scheme to kill the agent by reflecting the sun's rays to blind a car to run over the agent in what would appear to be an accident.  However, in the middle of the plan's execution, there is a solar eclipse, blocking the sunlight. At this time, the Brain receives a call from Uncle in the hospital, who tells the Brain that Fatty's death really was an accident. Uncle had accidentally dropped a bag of toy balls that night, which led to the loss of control of the bus.  Realizing he has made a mistake and that the agent is innocent, the Brain runs and tries to cover the windshield from reflecting light. The agent sees and recognizes the Brain as he is running, but the Brain is too late, and a blinded driver runs over the agent's wife, killing her.  On a later date, as the Brain is leaving the rented flat, he is confronted and stabbed by the insurance agent in the staircase, who asks the Brain why he had to harm them. The Brain looks at the sky and thinks about his own wife before he dies.

Because of his condition, Adam has difficulty communicating and likes to escape into his love of space exploration. His fixation on detail, repetitive behaviors, and [[mind-blindness]] cost him his job at a toy manufacturing company and nearly got him arrested after he is mistaken for a pedophile. He does not want to leave the apartment he and his father had been living in, but the loss of his job leaves him with an uncertain future, including the problem of continuing to pay the mortgage. Although he likes to stick to his routine and avoid socializing, Adam is lonely and wishes things could be different.

One night, Beth is shocked to find him trying to clean her apartment windows suspended from the roof of the building in a [[space suit]].  She takes a liking to Adam despite his oddities. Adam hopes for a relationship with Beth.  Although his first attempts are uneasy, he eventually breaks out of his beloved routines enough to be able to date Beth.      When Adam asks Beth if she was aroused as he was during an outing to Central Park, she is taken aback. Adam admits his Asperger's and explains his inability to interpret her emotions. Surprised by his innocence, the next day she asks a co-worker about Asperger's syndrome and is advised that Adam is not "dating material".  Nonetheless, she is drawn to him, and his eccentricities make him more attractive to her. Adam's innocence, honesty and unique ways endear him to her and she falls in love.  Things begin to go downhill when Beth's father, Marty ([[Peter Gallagher]]), gets into legal trouble. In a naive effort to make small talk, Adam asks Marty about the details of his alleged crimes, which does not go over well with Beth.  After Adam discovers that Beth and her father engineered an "accidental" meeting (in an effort to protect Adam's feelings), Adam angrily accuses Beth of being a liar and she storms out.   Adam gets a call with a job offer in California working in satellite navigation.  He goes to Beth, apologizes for his behavior, and asks her to go to California with him. Marty objects to this and he and Beth argue. Beth asks Adam why he wants her to come with him. Not seeing the opportunity to express his feelings for Beth, Adam lists practical ways in which she helps him.  Beth concludes that Adam is not in love with her. She tells Adam she cannot go with him.  A year later, Adam is working at the observatory, where his keen interest in space telescopes and his eidetic memory have made him successful and fulfilled in his job. He has also seemingly learned to pick up on social cues and pushes himself to join social situations. He receives a package from Beth containing her first published children's book, inspired by Adam and Asperger's.  He reads the first page in which Beth has [[anthropomorphized]] raccoons, used to represent Adam and his family.  Adam looks deep in thought and, in a moment of realization, he understands why Beth wanted to anthropomorphize the raccoons. Even after a year apart, this moment of clarity seems to bring him closer to Beth and he smiles in happiness.

She rejects Orestes's love (she offers him her bloody menstrual towel, to show him that love has its drawbacks, while studying has none): she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science, and is also secretly in love with her.  Meanwhile, social unrest begins challenging the Roman rule of the city as Pagans and Christians come into conflict. When the Christians start defiling the statues of the pagan gods, the pagans, including Orestes and Theon, ambush the Christians to squash their rising influence. However, in the ensuing battle, the pagans unexpectedly find themselves outnumbered by a large Christian mob.

Some Christians ridicule the thinking that [[spherical Earth|the Earth is a sphere]], by arguing that people far from the top would fall off the Earth. When they ask Davus his opinion he avoids conflict by saying that only God knows these things.  Hypatia also investigates the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the solar system proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]; by having an object dropped from the mast of a moving ship she demonstrates to Orestes that a possible motion of the Earth would not affect the motion, relative to Earth, of a falling object on Earth. However, due to [[Heliocentrism#Religious attitudes to heliocentrism|religious objections against heliocentrism]], the Christians have now forbidden Hypatia to teach at the school. The Christians and the [[Judaism|Jews]] come into conflict, committing violent acts against each other.  The leader of the Christians, [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]], views Hypatia as having too much influence over Orestes and stages a public ceremony intended to force Orestes to subjugate her. Hypatia's former pupil, Synesius, now the Bishop of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], comes to her rescue as a religious authority counterweight, but says he cannot help her unless she accepts Christianity; she refuses. Hypatia makes a personal discovery, theorizing that the Earth orbits around the Sun in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptic]], not circular, orbit with the Sun at one of the [[focus (geometry)|foci]]. Cyril convinces a mob of Christians that Hypatia is a [[witch]] and they vow to kill her. Davus tries to run ahead to warn Hypatia, but she is captured by the mob. They strip Hypatia naked and are about to skin her alive until Davus persuades the mob otherwise, and they decide to [[stoning|stone]] her instead.

They then see a tree hung with skulls and bones. Going ballistic, Melody runs back through the woods, only to get attacked by the deformed pig people and have her neck snapped.  Stacey and Sanjay find a dilapidated shack and enter cautiously. They see Brian in a chair with his back to them and approach him quietly, only to realize that he's dead. The pig people arrive at the shack and barricade the door. One of them breaks through the wall, but Sanjay hits him in the arm with an axe. The shack catches fire; Stacey and Sanjay flee into the woods. They discover Melody hanging upside down in the bone tree. They run, and the crazed, deformed clan chases them. They hide behind a tree, letting the killers pass without seeing them, but the killers wind up finding them and force them to continue running. They soon bump into the Pig Bitch, who knocks them out and captures them.  They wake up in a cave and find their arms sewn together. They hobble away and stumble upon the pig people's cave campsite. One sees them, and the pair race away. They light a torch and try to rip their arms apart. They gorily succeed. They try to escape, but are attacked by the Pig Bitch. Stacey jabs the torch into her face, forcing her to let go, and they get away. Sanjay ends up falling into a chasm. Stacey climbs down into the chasm and consoles, him and then turns on some propane tanks when Pig Bitch attacks Stacey with a meat hook. Stacey and Pig Bitch fight.  The rest of the monsters arrive, and Sanjay comes to and reaches for the torch. Pig Bitch and Stacey choke each other, and Stacey rips out some of Pig Bitch's hair. Stacey then picks up the meat hook and slashes Pig Bitch's throat before repeatedly stabbing her with the hook. Sanjay then heroically lights the torch, killing himself and a good number of the deformed people, and Stacey runs out of the cave as an explosion ensues, knocking her out.  Stacey wakes up as dawn breaks and runs into the woods before reaching a field. She drops the meat hook as she comes upon the same white tent where a church congregation is meeting. She hysterically runs in and tries to explain what has happened. The preacher, who takes off his sunglasses and reveals abnormally light (albino) eyes, laughs with the rest of the congregation. The congregation is composed of people who are deformed as well—not as horribly as the Albino Farm residents, but in the unsettling way of a freak show—Siamese twin sisters, another suckling deformed baby, a man with a stretched-out smile, another with a fat, pasty face, and the dwarf encountered earlier. As Stacey cries, "My God, it's the whole town!" the preacher quotes the passage about the sins of the fathers visiting the children. The audience, visibly amused, sings on, with Stacey, who by now is completely over the edge, grins widely and manically.  
Ajami (film)
  The film contains five story lines, each of which is presented in a non-chronological fashion. Some events are shown multiple times from varying perspectives. A young Israeli Arab boy, Nasri, who lives in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa, narrates the film.  In the first story, Nasri's neighbor—a teenage boy—is shot to death by a well-known Bedouin clan in a drive-by shooting while working on his car. Nasri explains that the intended target was his older brother Omar, who had previously sold the car to the neighbor. The botched hit was revenge for a loss of one of Bedouin clan members, who was shot and paralyzed by Nasri's uncle in a dispute. Nasri and his younger sister are sent to Jerusalem, while Omar, his mother, and grandfather stay behind. Fearing for his family's safety, Omar seeks protection and guidance from Abu Elias, an affluent restaurant owner, and well known and respected member of the Jaffa community. Abu Elias arranges for a three-day ceasefire, and hires a lawyer to represent Omar in tribal court. During this time, Nasri and his sister return home. At the conclusion of the court session, the judge declares that Omar must pay tens of thousands of dinars—the equivalent of tens of thousands of US dollars—so peace can be restored. Omar is given three weeks to make good on his payment. Omar and his friend Shaata attempt petty crime in order to come up with the finances, but are unsuccessful at bringing in enough money. Omar's mother attempts to persuade him to escape with the family, but Omar refuses to leave, believing that there is no place to run to.  The second story introduces a young teenaged boy named Malek who lives in the Palestinian territory of Nablus. Malek is illegally employed in Abu Elias's restaurant, and works out of desperation to make enough money for his ailing mother's bone marrow transplant surgery. Malek is friends with Omar, who has also become a recent employee at the restaurant. It is also revealed that Omar, a Muslim, is in love with Abu Elias's daughter Hadir, a Christian. Abu Elias, once discovering the secret couple later in the film by catching them in the surreptitious act of flirtation, does not approve of their relationship, and angrily fires Omar, warning him to stay away from his daughter.  The third story shows a brief, but violent encounter between an older Jewish man and his three young drug dealing Arab neighbors. The dispute begins when the Jewish man complains to the young men that he has not been able to sleep, due to the fact that their bleating sheep keep him up all night. The disagreement soon escalates, and one of the young men mortally stabs the Jewish man. The three young men go into hiding before the police arrive. Amongst the policemen who arrive at the scene is an Israeli officer named Dan, nicknamed Dando by his friends. Viewers learn that Dando's younger brother Yoni has gone missing during his service in the Israeli Defense Forces. While rumors circulate that Yoni may have run away and became very religious, Dando's family—mother and father specifically—suspect that he may have been kidnapped or murdered by a Palestinian terrorist organization. Dando—a family man with a wife and kids—has remained strong for his emotionally broken family, as they make attempts at locating his brother. Later in the story, Dando is informed that the army has discovered the remains of what is believed to be a murdered Israeli soldier in the Palestinian territories. It is soon thereafter confirmed that the remains are Yoni's, and Dando—emotionally traumatized—vows to find the murderer and bring him to justice.  In the fourth story, viewers learn of the character Binj (who is played by co-director Scandar Copti) an eccentric cook who works in Abu Elias's restaurant. He is also close friends with Omar, Shaata and Malek. Binj is in love with a Jewish girl from Tel Aviv, and is thinking of moving in with her, much to the dismay of his group of friends. It is revealed that Binj's brother was one of the three involved in the stabbing of the Jewish man in Jaffa. Both Binj and his father are taken in and interrogated by the police. After his release, Binj reluctantly agrees to accept a great deal of drugs that belongs to his brother who is still on the run. Early one morning, after a social gathering in his house, Binj awakes Malek so he won't be late to the restaurant's opening and hides in his presence the brick of drugs. Just when Malek is leaving he sees three Hebrew speaking men enter Binj's house. When Binj is found dead in his apartment not long afterward, Malek and Omar initially suspect that he was murdered by a group of Israeli drug dealers. It is later revealed that those three men were actually policemen who came to search Binj's house and intimidate him into revealing his brother's location. Having to leave after he told them nothing the police promises Binj to return. Binj, tired from the situation and annoyed by the ongoing harresment of the police, discarded the majority of the drugs, put sugar powder inside packages mimicking drug bricks and hid them around the house in an attempt to mock the police, should they ever return. Binj then proceeds to snort the remainder of drugs he did not discard and accidentally dies of a drug overdose. All of this is unbeknownst to Malek and Omar who, after Binj's death, takes one of the hidden mock-drug packages and, thinking it is the drugs, decides to sell it to a drug dealer in an attempt to pay off their respective debts. Abu Elias learns of their plans and tips off the police, thinking Omar will be caught, thus ending the relationship between Omar and his daughter. Initially, Abu Elias fires Malek after learning of his involvement with drugs, but after Malek's pleading and after learning that Omar will not go alone to the exchange he changes his mind, and instructs Malek to meet the dealers with Omar, but warns him not to carry the drugs on his person. He assures Malek that once Omar is taken into custody by the police, Malek can return to the restaurant and that his sick mother will be taken care of. Like Omar and Malek however, Abu Elias does not realize that the drugs are fake.  The fifth story shows the encounter between Omar, Malek, and the drug dealers. Toward the beginning of the film, viewers are shown the scene, and initially led to believe that Malek was shot to death by the drug dealers, once they discovered the drugs were fake. It is revealed later however, that the dealers were actually policemen executing a sting operation. It is also revealed that Omar's younger brother Nasri insisted on accompanying Omar and Malek to the meeting, afraid that something bad would happen to his brother. Upon arrival, Omar tells Nasri to stay in the car, and at Malek's urging, leaves his gun behind as well. At the meeting, the police tackle and beat Omar and Malek after they discover the drugs are fake. Dando, who is a part of the sting, sees Malek with the pocket watch he planned to give Abu Elias as a present. Dando believes that the watch belonged to Yoni and in a fit of rage beats Malek and aims his gun at him with the intent to murder him. However Nasri, who hadn't stayed in the car as ordered, sees the gun pointed at Malek, and shoots Dando with Omar's gun. He is then shot and killed by another officer. The film ends with Omar escaping down an alleyway and getting back to the car, only to discover that Nasri is missing.

Aliens in the Attic
 A [[meteor shower]] rockets through open space. Four glowing pods are seen hiding behind the meteor shower. Suddenly the meteor shower makes a hard right and heads towards the distant planet Earth.  In a Chicago suburb, Stuart Pearson ([[Kevin Nealon]]) and his wife Nina ([[Gillian Vigman]]) head a family that includes 7-year-old Hannah ([[Ashley Boettcher]]), 17-year-old hormonal sister Bethany ([[Ashley Tisdale]]), who has just come back from a secret outing with her weirdo boyfriend Ricky Dillman ([[Robert Hoffman (actor)|Robert Hoffman]]), and 15-year-old techno-geek Tom ([[Carter Jenkins]]) whose high school grades are low. After having an argument with Tom about him hacking into the school's website to change his grades and deciding the family needs some good old-fashioned togetherness, Stuart takes them to a holiday home in the middle of nowhere. Joining them is Nathan "Nate" Pearson ([[Andy Richter]]), his 14-year-old son Jake ([[Austin Butler]]), Nana Rose ([[Doris Roberts]]), and identical 12-year-old twins Art (Henri Young) and Lee (Regan Young). Ricky also arrives unexpectedly and talks his way into staying overnight, by giving them the impression that his car has broken down and needs to be repaired (though he secretly took out one of the plugs) so he can spend time with Bethany, plus saying he is 18 years old.  As the family settle in, dark storm clouds swirl around the house. Suddenly, the four glowing pods land on the roof. An [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] crew emerges, made up of Skip ([[J. K. Simmons]]), the nasty, tough commander, Tazer ([[Thomas Haden Church]]), a muscle-bound dude armed to the teeth, Razor ([[Kari Wahlgren]]), a lethal, violent female alien soldier, and Sparks ([[Josh Peck]]), a four-armed techie, who is the only non-threatening intruder. Since the aliens crashed into the satellite dish, Ricky and Tom are sent to fix it. In the attic Ricky then reveals to Tom that he lied about his car breaking down, and his age; Ricky is actually in college and is 21 years old, four years older than Bethany. Ricky sends Tom to fix the satellite dish by himself, but it is beyond repair. Investigating further, Tom and Jake (who unexpectedly shows up on the roof) discover the aliens. Ricky is shot by Tazor with a dart-like "mind control plug", allowing the aliens to control him via a remote. The aliens, called "Zirkonians", lay claim to the planet. Like a puppet, Ricky attacks the boys, but Tom and Jake manage to get back into the house.  It is not long before all five kids have seen the aliens, except for Bethany. They soon discover that the alien mind control plugs don't work on children, giving them a fighting chance, and realize they have a responsibility to protect the adults by keeping the aliens' existence a secret. The kids create makeshift weapons, like a homemade potato spud gun, and repel the first alien attack from the attic. In the process, they obtain Ricky's remote control and turn him against the aliens.  The kids orchestrate a scheme to get the adults out of the house and then ambush the aliens as they try to reach the basement via the air vents, causing the gentle tech Sparks to become separated. He meets Hannah and they become friends. Unlike his alien cohorts, Sparks hates battle; he just wants to return home to his family, and he helps by making weapons for them. He also reveals his teammates are after a machine buried under the basement for many years. The kids forgot about their grandmother, and the aliens mind control her, which gives her superhuman strength and agility but they obtain her controller, and she defeats Ricky (now back under alien control) in a scene reminiscent of a fighting ninja video game. However, the aliens manage to capture Jake and Sparks, whom they need to complete their mission.  The kids finally reveal to Bethany the events that are taking place. The five of them rescue Jake in the basement. Ricky then insults Tom and the others and breaks up with Bethany because she always talks about feelings and family, and leaves. The children attack the aliens and rescue Sparks but Skip succeeds in using the enlarging machine, growing to 30 feet tall, and calls the Zirkonian invasion ships. They defeat him and shrink him again. Tazer and Razor (who have fallen in love) flee, while Skip is sucked into the machine, which was damaged in the process and malfunctions and explodes. Sparks calls off the invasion and returns home after saying goodbye. Tom and Stuart reconcile and the rest of the vacation goes back to normal, except the kids grew closer to each other during their adventure. In the distance Skip, who has been shrunk to an even smaller size than before, appears bent on revenge, but meets his demise when a crow flies over and grabs him.  In a mid-credits scene, Bethany and Tom take revenge on Ricky for breaking up with her and insulting her family by making him look like a fool in front of his new girlfriend Annie Filkins, using the alien mind control device. Bethany comments "I am so keeping this" after using the device to make Ricky land on his testicles.

Aloo Chaat (film)
 Nikhil ([[Aftab Shivdasani]]), returns to his house in Lajpat Nagar after completing his education in the United States. His orthodox Punjabi family consisting of his father Purushottam ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]), his grandmother Beeji ([[Dolly Ahluwalia]]), his confused mother Seeto ([[Meenakshi Sethi]]) and an always suspicious uncle Chhadami Mama ([[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]) are keen to get him married and scout potential matches. Nikhil however, does not show an interest in marriage which has the family worried about their son's orientation. Purushottam requests his family friend Hakim ([[Manoj Pahwa]]), a [[sexologist]] by profession, to try to get Nikhil to get open up about marriage.  Nikhil reveals to Hakim that he's already in love with a Muslim girl Aamna ([[Aamna Sharif]]) living in the U.S. Being rooted in old traditions, he fears his family will never accept a Muslim daughter-in-law and has hence kept the matter hidden. Having no qualms with the match himself, Hakim devices a strategy to get Nikhil's family to accept Aamna. The plan involves Nikhil professing to marry an American girl and introducing Aamna to his family as the girl's close friend. They would then portray the American girl in a bad light and Aamna in a good light to help sway his family's opinion. With help from Hakim's regular patient Sukha Paaji, they settle on Nikki ([[Linda Arsenio]]), an American girl with strong Indian values, who both Nikhil and Hakim train to come across as a bit spoiled. Nikhil also photoshops images for Nikki's childhood album and together with Hakim, comes up with a fake history for Nikki.  Although initially against it, Nikhil's family agrees to his choice after some convincing from Hakim. Nikhil brings Nikki and Aamna to his house, the former pretending to arrive from the airport, a ruse which is almost caught by Chhadami. As days progress, Nikki tries to comes across as a poor choice for Nikhil by such acts as cooking American food, wearing skimpy western outfits and acting irresponsibly while Aamna remedies these by cooking Punjabi food (which the family relishes after initial hesitation), wearing Indian outfits and being responsible and caring. Nikki even gets herself a sunbath in a bikini at the house's rooftop, inviting several unwanted stares and is admonished for this by Aamna in the presence of Nikhil's father. Gradually she starts winning over the family members although Chhadami stays suspicious of their motives.  Nikhil's plan hits a snag when the astrologer called to select an auspicious marriage date chooses one just four days ahead. In a last-ditch effort to throw the wedding off, the trio decide to hire a woman to play Nikki's mother, having her object to her "daughter's" marriage but are apparently unsuccessful in their attempts.  While watching a cricket match with the family, Purushottam looks at cricketer Michael Clarke and recalls seeing his picture somewhere. Chhadami screams that the picture was on Nikki's childhood album. Immediately, Purushottam gets a cardiac arrest. He is examined by a doctor who advises against giving him any stress. Purushottam proposes getting Nikhil married the next day in court itself. Nikhil locks Chhadami in a room to stall him from making any reservations but Purushottam has already taken care of the marriage dates. Resigned to their fates, Nikhil, Nikki and Aamna head to court unable to find a way out.  Confusion abounds at the court as two women show up claiming to be Nikki's mother, objecting to the marriage. Chhadami, who has been able to free himself, rushes to the court to warn Purushottam of Nikhil's scheme. A smiling Purushottam is seen coming out of the court having wedded Nikhil and Aamna. He explains he had gotten wind of Nikhil's plan after seeing the cricketer's picture and was able to connect the dots. He then cooked up his own scheme to get Nikhil and Aamna married. The family welcomes Aamna with open arms and they all head to a food-stall near their house to have their regular snack: [[aloo chaat]].

Chuck is attracted to Priscilla, but she rejects his advances saying she has a boyfriend. Chuck and Kevin ask Priscilla and Naz to a frat party being held to welcome Ed Curtzman (Rob Schneider), producer of "Chicks Go Crazy" (a parody of [[Girls Gone Wild (franchise)|Girls Gone Wild]]).

A [[Subtitle (captioning)|title]] says Priscilla is now 69% pure.  Told about her behavior at the party, and that Chicks Go Crazy filmed the incident, she decides to travel to [[Detroit]] on [[Oktoberfest celebrations|Oktoberfest]], with Naz, Kevin and Chuck, to recover the footage from Curtzman. In a strip club, where they had hoped to find him, Naz persuades a male stripper to dance for Priscilla, which she discreetly enjoys. Another title says Priscilla is 47% pure. Back at the hotel, Priscilla, still depressed, is offered some brownies by Naz: they are [[Cannabis foods|laced with marijuana]].

After trying to lose her virginity to some random people in a bar, she is found by Naz, and they return to Curtzman's event at the hotel. They are met by Becca, whom Chuck has located on the internet. Priscilla tries to talk to Curtzman again but is insulted, and Becca, overhearing the conversation, becomes angry with her father.

She lives with her aging mother and has occasional visits from her brother Samer. One day after arriving home, Muna discovers that she has been awarded an [[Diversity Immigrant Visa|American green card through the lottery]].<ref name="NZ_Herald_10652494"></ref><ref>[http://www.seattleweekly.com/2009-09-23/film/amreeka/ Amreeka: Palestinians Find No Welcome in the U.S.]</ref> Although she initially considered declining the offer, Muna reconsiders after she and Fadi are harassed at the checkpoint by Israeli soldiers.  They arrive in the United States shortly after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] to stay with her sister’s family in [[Illinois]]. After a difficult time with [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|customs]], Muna is reunited with her sister, Raghda Halaby ([[Hiam Abbass]]), physician brother-in-law Nabeel (Yussuf Abu-Warda) and their three children Salma ([[Alia Shawkat]]), Rana (Jenna Kawar), and Lamis (Selena Haddad). Later, however, Muna discovers that a box of cookies was confiscated during the customs search and is horrified: the box contained all of her life savings. Muna thus searches for work, but is disappointed to discover that her multiple degrees and work experience do not guarantee the kind of employment she is seeking. She finally takes a job at [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]]. Too ashamed to tell her family the truth, she pretends to have been hired by the bank next door to White Castle. She maintains the facade through the help of an employee of the bank next door to White Castle (Miriam Smith) and her blue-haired high school drop-out co-worker, Matt (Brodie Sanderson).  Meanwhile, Muna begins to discover that her sister's family has been experiencing difficulties in the [[Post-9/11]] and Iraq war atmosphere of the United States. The family receives anonymous threats in the mail and Nabeel is continually losing patients from his medical practice. They are also behind on their mortgage and risk losing their home. The strain of living in this atmosphere becomes so severe that Raghda and Nabeel temporarily "separate" and Nabeel moves into the basement of the family home.  Later, when some of the students make derogatory remarks to Fadi, he gets into a fight and his mother is called to meet with the school's principal Mr. Novatski (Joseph Ziegler). Shortly after the meeting, Mr. Novatski sees Muna waiting for her sister and insists on driving her to work. He apologizes to her for the behavior of the students towards Fadi saying that they are influenced by the media's depiction of [[Muslim]]s. Muna is dismayed by the stereotypes he describes to her. She also informs him that she and Fadi are not Muslims, but are rather from a minority community. Embarrassed by his assumption, Mr. Novatski apologizes and says that he is a minority as well as an [[American Jews|American Jew]] whose grandparents were [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]]. She is surprised to learn that he is Jewish. Muna asks him to drop her off at the bank but forgets her purse, an act which leads him to discover that she works secretly at White Castle. Deciding to have a meal there, they discover that they are both divorced.  On another day, local high school students make discriminatory remarks about Fadi to Muna while she is working in White Castle. She chases them out, only to slip on a drink one of the boys poured on the floor and falls flat on her back. Matt immediately calls her family who then discovers her secret. Furious over the incident, Fadi gets into a fight with one of the boys and is subsequently arrested. In addition to assault, ambiguous charges are also leveled towards him that are serious enough to prevent Muna from getting him released. Muna contacts Mr. Novatski who rushes to the police station and tells the officers that the accusations are without merit and that he will assume responsibility for Fadi. Fadi is thus released from jail. These events also lead Raghda and Nabeel to reconcile.  A little while later, Muna is working at White Castle and her family comes to take her to a [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern restaurant]] for dinner. While leaving she bumps into Mr. Novatski and invites him to join them for dinner. Raghda teases Muna when he enters the car and the evening ends with music and dancing.

The snake finds them and devours Leila and Hakeem. Amanda and Jackson are forced to find the serum, and are accompanied by two henchmen of Eugene to find it. They put up at Peter's house. There the two find the serum but keep it hidden. The anaconda strikes the house and devours one gunman, and while the other is trying to fight it off, Amanda and Alex escape.

Murdoch arrives, demanding that Amanda give him the serum. As they do that, he keeps his word and allows them to leave. As the remaining survivors leave in the jeep, Murdoch injects himself with the serum and discovers that it works, but the snake eats him. As Amanda finally destroy the orchids for good, she, Jackson, Alex and Heather try to escape in a jeep as the anaconda pursues them, but they are attacked by Eugene, who had clung on the back of the vehicle.

Angels & Demons (film)
 Under the watchful eyes of Father Silvano and Dr. Vittoria Vetra, the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([[CERN]]) initiates the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and creates three [[Penning trap|vials]] of [[antimatter]] particles larger than any ever produced  before. Almost immediately, Father Silvano is killed and one of the vials of antimatter goes missing. At the same time, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is mourning the sudden death of [[Pope]] Pius XVI in [[Rome]] and prepares for the [[papal conclave]] to elect the next [[Bishop of Rome|Pope]]. The [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], Father Patrick McKenna, assumes temporary control of the Vatican. Before the conclave enters seclusion, four of the "preferiti" (the favorite cardinals to be elected pope) are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the [[Illuminati]]. In a video message, he threatens to kill one candidate every hour starting at 8pm and to destroy all of Vatican City at midnight, using the missing vial of antimatter as a bomb. The Vatican summons [[Symbology|symbologist]] [[Robert Langdon]] from [[Harvard University]] and Vetra to help them save the four preferiti and locate the vial.  Langdon listens to the Illuminati's message and deduces the four [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] will die at the four altars of the "Path of Illumination", marked by statues of angels in locations relevant to the four [[classical element]]s. Over the objections of Commander Maximilian Richter, head of the [[Swiss Guard]], but with McKenna's consent, Langdon is granted access to the [[Vatican Secret Archives]]. He examines [[Galileo Galilei]]'s [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|banned book]] with Vetra. Following the clues and accompanied by Inspector General Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Vatican Gendarmerie Corps]], they arrive at the [[Chigi Chapel]] in the Church of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]]. There they find Cardinal Ebner dead, suffocated with soil and branded with an [[ambigram]]matic word "[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]". They verify the second location is the crowded [[Saint Peter's Square]] and arrive just as a bloody Cardinal Lamassé emerges with his chest branded with "[[Air (classical element)|Air]]". Vetra unsuccessfully attempts to perform CPR on him, only to discover his lungs had been punctured, while the assassin slips through the crowd.  While Vetra studies Silvano's diaries, Langdon, Olivetti and Vincenzi locate the third church, [[Santa Maria della Vittoria]], and arrive to see Cardinal Guidera, branded "[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]]" and suspended above a burning pile of wood. A gunfight erupts between the assassin and the officers, with Olivetti and Vincenzi being killed in the process. Langdon manages to escape, but not before being spotted by the assassin. Langdon convinces two [[Carabinieri]] officers to take him to the next location and the trio race to the [[Water (classical element)|Water]] altar, the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi|Fountain of the Four Rivers]], just as the assassin arrives in a van. The assassin murders the officers and drops a bound and weighted Cardinal Baggia into the fountain before bidding farewell to Langdon and driving off. With the help of bystanders, Langdon rescues the cardinal, who tells him the Illuminati's lair is [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]. There, Langdon and Vetra discover a [[Passetto di Borgo|hidden passageway]] leading to the Vatican, being used as a hideout for the assassin. Discovering a case with marks for five branding irons, they realize the fifth brand is for the Camerlengo but are confronted by the assassin before they can alert McKenna. The assassin spares their lives once more, stating killing them is not a part of his mission unless they pursue him. He then cryptically warns them to be careful as his contractors are "men of God" before departing. He escapes to a car left for him by his contractor, but is killed immediately when it explodes upon ignition.  Langdon and Vetra rush back to the Vatican where they find Commander Richter hovering over McKenna with a gun, the Vatican symbol branded into McKenna's chest. Richter and Archbishop Simeon are shot by the Guards. As Richter dies in front of Langdon, he opens his hand to reveal a key which Langdon takes. The stolen antimatter vial is found in St. Peter's Tomb below the church, but the battery life is too low to risk re-connecting it to a battery. McKenna, a former military pilot, seizes the vial and uses an awaiting helicopter to fly above the Vatican. At a high altitude, he parachutes out as the antimatter bomb explodes overhead. McKenna is hailed a hero and savior, and the cardinals move to elect him pope. Langdon and Vetra use Richter's key to watch a security video showing McKenna speaking to Richter before the attack. The video reveals it is McKenna, not the Illuminati, who masterminded the scheme. McKenna reveals he murdered the previous pope because he felt the pope had betrayed the church by trying to bridge the gap between science and religion. After McKenna had killed the pope, he intended to have himself elected to the papacy whilst rallying the most conservative Cardinals to his side. The recording is shown to the Papal conclave, and it dawns on McKenna that he has been exposed. He flees to [[Saint Peter's tomb|a remote recess]] in the building where he is able to commit suicide by [[Self-immolation|setting himself on fire]].  The Vatican officially announces McKenna died due to internal injuries suffered during his parachute landing, and Cardinal Baggia is [[Papal name|named]] Pope Luke I, with Cardinal Strauss as the new Camerlengo. Strauss thanks Langdon for his assistance and gives Langdon Galileo's "Diagramma Veritatis" for his research as a gift from himself and Pope Luke, requesting only it be returned to the Vatican by Langdon's testament, and any future references he may make about the Catholic Church in his future publications be done gently, to which Langdon replies, "I'll try." As the film ends, the new Pope Luke shares a grateful nod with Langdon and Vetra, and walks out onto the balcony to greet the crowd waiting for him in the Square.

Annihilation Earth
 The film opens as a team of scientists in the year 2020 wander through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, with the team leader calling for help on a radio, until they come upon the ruins of a city.  Forty-eight hours earlier, David Wyndham ([[Luke Goss]]), the same team leader, is informed by his UN superior, Paxton ([[Marina Sirtis]]) of a security breach involving another scientist on their project, David's friend and colleague Raja ([[Colin Salmon]]). Unauthorized access of the project's mainframe the night before was made using Raja's access codes. As a precaution he has been removed from the project.  Paxton holds a press conference about their project, codenamed "EVE" (for Electromagnetic Vacuum Energy), which has provided most of Europe's energy for the past ten years beginning in 2010. The project utilizes three high-power particle colliders, located in [[Geneva]], [[Barcelona, Spain]], and [[Orleans, France]]. With the project's continuing success, Paxton is enthusiastic that the technology can be utilized worldwide - although David confronts her afterward that she has no intention of sharing the technology with the [[Middle East]], which she verifies.  Outside the meeting hall, David receives a mysterious phone call, then is approached by a reporter, whom he dismisses with a handshake. The reporter furtively copies David's fingerprint from his hand using a piece of tape and stores it in a case.  At home, David receives a visit from Raja, who has already surmised that Paxton's plans for the technology. Raja believes he is a scapegoat for the security breach because he is the only Arab with level 5 project clearance. When David rejects his claims, Raja angrily leaves.  That night, the "reporter" that accosted David sneaks into the Orleans facility, using a recording of David saying his name and the copied fingerprint to gain access to the lab, and enters a series of codes into the computer. A short time later, after the mysterious man has escaped, the plant explodes, destroying Orleans and a quarter of France including Paris, killing millions of people.  As he tries to sort out what happened the next day, David meets with Raja again. Raja has been named the top suspect and is running from the police and Paxton's men. Paxton shows David photos of Raja apparently meeting with the mystery man, a known [[terrorist]] named Aziz Khaled. A stunned David insists he be allowed to go to ground zero to investigate the explosion before judgments are made. Later, a massive [[earthquake]] strikes the Middle East, causing catastrophic destruction in [[Bahrain]].  The next day, Raja calls David near the French-Spanish border, revealing that because the earthquake happened one day after the blast and hit where the EVE grid was absent, he has deduced that someone has discovered the Doomsday Equation, a set of codes for each collider that could destroy the planet if used.  David and his team travel to Orleans via [[helicopter]] but they crash, killing the pilot. They find evidence that a [[Higgs field]] has formed, confirming Raja's suspicions. Meanwhile, Raja's electric car runs out of power at the border, and he is soon abducted by Khaled. David's team, meanwhile, attempts to escape France in a [[Humvee]] sent to rescue them only to be caught in a [[meteor shower]], which turns out to be falling [[satellites]]. The team barely escapes, and David is brought back to the Geneva facility by Paxton's men, where he is reunited with his family. He concludes that the only way to save the world is to shut down the entire EVE system.  Khaled takes Raja to the Barcelona facility. After murdering all the workers, he tries to force Raja into giving him the site's Doomsday Equation, believing the meltdown will not cause the end of the world, but Raja steadfastly refuses, and later kills Khaled by stabbing him with a pen and shoving him into the collider's core. Raja returns to the computer and opens an [[instant message]] to Geneva, telling David his suspicions about the Doomsday Equation were right and that the only way to save the world is to ''increase'' the system's output and choke the field out of existence, or else it will expand into a [[black hole]]. Paxton refuses to listen, still believing that Raja is a terrorist. Under immense pressure, David finally decides to go with his own plan and initiates the system shutdown.  As soon as the system shutdown is complete, the Geneva facility melts down in an explosion exponentially larger than the one that destroyed France. Everything and everyone within hundreds of miles of Geneva, including David, his family, the facility's staff, and Paxton, are incinerated in an instant. A view from outer space shows shock waves from the blast tearing the planet apart, with a gigantic crack forming in the immediate area of the blast. Moments later the planet's core is breached, causing it to explode.  The film concludes with a shot of pieces of what was once Earth floating through space, followed by a blank screen reading simply, [[Extinction]].

Antichrist (film)
  ===Prologue=== A couple makes passionate love, as their toddler, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death.  ===Chapter One: Grief=== The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with [[Complicated grief disorder|a typical grief]]. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with [[psychotherapy]]. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her.  ===Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)=== During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-[[Disembowelment|disemboweling]] fox that tells him "chaos reigns."  ===Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)=== In the dark attic the man finds the woman's thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest hidden fear.  Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nic's shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity. She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his testicles, causing him to lose consciousness. The woman then masturbates the unconscious man, culminating in an ejaculation of blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then tossing the wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole at the base of the dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him with a shovel.  ===Chapter Four: The Three Beggars=== Night falls; now remorseful, she unburies him but cannot remember where the wrench is. She helps him back to the cabin, where she tells him she does "not yet" want to kill him, adding that "when the three beggars arrive someone must die." In a flashback  she watches Nic climbing up to the window, but she does not act, thus displaying her essential evil much like her hypothesis. In the cabin she cuts off her clitoris with scissors. They are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox. A hailstorm begins; earlier it had been revealed that women accused of witchcraft had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. Finding the wrench under the floorboards, he is stabbed by her with the scissors, but is able to unbolt the grindstone. Finally free, he shows a vicious face, and strangles her to death. He then burns her on a funeral pyre.  ===Epilogue=== He limps from the cabin, eating wild berries, as the three diaphanous beggars look on. Reaching the top of a hill, under a brilliant light he sees hundreds of women in antiquated clothes coming towards him, their faces blurred.

She decides to message her virtual friend, finally suggesting that they meet in real life. Abhik experiences a wide range of emotions but is ultimately nervous and eager. The night before her interview, a particular phone conversation with Abhik strikes her, and she realises that he is in fact her online friend. That night, Brinda meets in a car accident on her way to work and dies before the meeting can happen.

The sweet Arundhati is the first female to be born since her  great grandmother and is especially revered in the family. She then goes to [[Gadwal]], where her grandfather resides to visit him. Her grandfather, the head of the family, talks to her with respect as if she were older than him. She receives a misleading phone call in her fiance Rahul's ([[Arjan Bajwa]]) voice asking her to come to the fort of Gadwall, where she faces a horrible revelation. Learning the story from an aged servant maid, Chandramma ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]), Arundhati comes to know that she is a look alike of her great-grandmother Arundhati/Jejjamma.  Jejjama is an expert in painting, dancing and martial arts. Her elder sister is married to her cousin Pasupathi ([[Sonu Sood]]). Pasupathi, a womanizer, rapes the women he likes and kills those who object. While Jejjama was still a young girl, he raped and killed her blind dance teacher while a horrified Jejjama watched through the peephole. Jejjama, furious, demands that he be killed but the King tells her that this would ruin her sister's life. Hearing this, Jejjamma's sister commits suicide. The people of Gadwal furiously thrash Pasupathi and tie him to his horse. Though Gadwal celebrates his death, he is saved by Aghoras (saints who practice the dark arts). Pasupathi masters the [[Tantra|Tantric]] arts and returns to Gadwal many years later to exact his revenge.  He unleashes carnage as he uses his powers to torture innocent people—something the Aghoras don't do. He arrives on Jejjama's marriage day and magically starts removing her clothes but Jejjama seduces him and performs a special dance imbued with martial arts to lull Pasupathi. She then cuts off his tongue (thus ending the incantations) and pins his hands, allowing a chandelier to fall on his body. She spares him from being killed to prevent him from becoming a 'pretatma' (a demonic [[poltergeist]]). Pasupathi is buried alive in a tomb and powerful 'yantras' (defensive spells) are put on it to prevent him from coming out. Though pasupathi's corpse is buried , his soul moves out all around Gadwal destroying peoples' lives by causing famine and diseases. Jejjamma then visits many temples and sages for solution, but no one is able to solve the problem. She finally meets some Agories who tell her that she can only destroy Pasupathi's vengeful spirit on her next birth. Hence to initiate her re-incarnation, she agrees to give up her life. They instruct her to bid goodbye to everyone before the sacrifice and before leaving she tells everyone that the first girl who will be born in their race will be a replica of her and they all ought to respect the child as they would respect her. She then returns to the aghoras asking for a painful death that will magnify her revenge on Pasupathi. She then undergoes a painful death by having coconuts broken open on her skull. The queen then dies and her skeletal remains are fashioned into a dagger – the one weapon that could destroy Pasupathi forever.  A mad person unknowingly breaks the tomb and releases Pasusathi's spirit - 'pretatma'. Anwar ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) who treats patients through sorcery asks her to fight Pasupathi. Arundhati comes to know that her great-grandmother had prepared a 'weapon' with her own bones and had kept it with the sages. Pasupathi stabs Arundhati and she goes to Anwar's palace after recovering. During their attempts to procure the weapon their family are threatened and she loses Chandramma. Later the spirit apparently kills Anwar by throwing him off a cliff.  Arundhati, believing that Anwar is dead, returns to the fort to surrender herself to Pasupathi to prevent the death of her family members. But Anwar, who had survived the fall, hands the weapon to Arundhati. The weapon has to be soaked in Arundhathi's blood before it can be used. Before Anwar can tell her this, Pasupathi kills him. As a last resort to save herself, Arundhati tries to kill herself with the same weapon. The dagger glows from her blood showing that Jejjamma had come. She kills Pasupathi and the building sets fire and blasts. Then Arundhati is shown walking out of the place as Jejjamma.

 [[Tobio Tenma|Toby Tenma]] is a 13-year-old teenage boy who lives in the futuristic [[city-state]] Metro City, which floats above the polluted "Surface". Toby's father, [[Dr. Tenma]], is a famous roboticist and head of the Ministry of Science, but has a distant relationship with his son. Dr. Tenma meets the city's obstructive leader President Stone to demonstrate a new defensive robot called the Peacekeeper. To power it, Tenma's friend [[Dr. Elefun]] unveils the Blue and Red Core, two energy spheres which emit opposing positive and negative energy. Stone places the destructive Red Core into the Peacekeeper (against the doctors' warnings not to), causing it to go berserk, leading to Toby being disintegrated after sneaking into the room.  A distraught Tenma secretly constructs a [[Astro Boy (character)|robotic replica]] of Toby, complete with his memories, but has built-in defenses to protect him and is powered by the Blue Core. Toby's replica is awakened, believing nothing has happened. While he has Toby's mind, his personality is different in Tenma's eyes, when in actuality it is quite similar. Toby discovers his robotic capabilities including rocket-powered flight and the ability to understand other robots. Toby flies home but learns from Tenma of his origins and is rejected by him, flying away much to the sadness of Dr. Elefun. Stone, desperate to win a re-election, has Toby pursued by his guards but the battle leads to Toby tumbling off the city edge onto the Surface when one of Stone's ships blast him with missiles. Tenma and Elefun are not arrested when Tenma agrees to have Toby shut down.  Toby awakens in an enormous junkyard, created from the redundant robots dumped by Metro City. He is found by a group of human children, illiterate but smart Zane, twins Sludge and Widget, and the oldest Cora who has a grudge against Metro City. They are accompanied by a dog-like waste disposal robot named Trashcan. Toby also meets the members of the Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF), Sparx, Robotsky, and Mike the Fridge, who wish to free robots from mankind's control but are very inept and bound by the [[Laws of Robotics]]. However, they give Toby a new name, calling him "Astro". Astro departs with the kids, finding people still live on the Surface. He is taken in by robot repairman Hamegg, who also runs a robot fighting ring. The next day, Astro comes across an offline construction robot Zog, whom he revives with the Blue Core's energy. Hamegg accidentally scans Astro, realizing he is a robot, and paralyzes him the next day to participate in the fighting ring.  Astro defeats Hamegg's fighters until Zog is deployed, but the two robots refuse to fight one another. Hamegg assaults them with an electrical blaster, only for Zog to attempt to harm him, immune from the Laws of Robotics, but Astro saves Hamegg. President Stone's flagship arrives and Astro is taken back to Metro City, leaving Hamegg to be booed by the Crowd. Reuniting with Tenma and Elefun, Astro agrees to be shut down, apologizing to his father for not being a better Toby. Realizing Astro is still his son, Dr. Tenma reactivates him and lets him escape. Stone loads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper, only for it to absorb him and take on his personality. The Peacekeeper absorbs weapons and buildings, growing in size until it's the height of skyscrapers. It then goes on a rampage across Metro City, prompting Astro to battle it. During the fight, Metro City's power station is destroyed, causing it to fall to the ground. Astro uses his superhuman strength to help it land safely.  The Peacekeeper grabs Astro, but the connection of their cores causes them both pain. Dr. Tenma finds Astro and informs him that if the two cores reunite, they will be destroyed. When Astro's friends are captured, he flies into the Red Core, destroying the Peacekeeper and breaking his arm, but remaining mostly intact. Stone survives but is arrested for his crimes. Dr. Elefun and the children find Astro's body, discovering the Blue Core is dead. Zog appears and revives Astro using the Blue Core energy given to him. Astro reunites with his loved ones, making peace with his father. A cycloptic extraterrestrial attacks the city, and Astro leaps into action as the film ends.

One day, Ajay is adopted by a rich family and happily leaves the orphanage, as well as Arya, behind him. As time passes, he becomes a well-established business tycoon and has his own software company. Meanwhile, Arya grows into a "bad boy" and tracks Ajay down.

Geetha tries to expose Arya but no one is convinced. But one night, Geetha manages to emotionally blackmail Arya into confessing his real character (such as drinking and smoking) in front of the whole staff and proves that he isn't "perfect" and has a lot of flaws. Arya proposes to Geetha in front of everyone, including Shanti, and in this frustration, she proposes to Ajay, just to irk Arya and get rid of him.  Ajay isn't satisfied with this and wants to get rid of Arya for good, so crashes his own (Ajay's) car and weaves a story that Arya has crashed him, in hopes that everyone would accuse Arya and he would be fired.

Arya decides to bring her back at any cost for Ajay. He is introduced to her family and he stays at her house amid the preparations for the wedding between her and the rival gang lord's son. Due to a misunderstanding conspired by Arya, the wedding is stopped and Arya is asked to marry Geetha by her father. Arya agrees and justifies this by saying that, had he not accepted, Geetha would be married off to another person, and Ajay can never get her back. After their marriage, Ajay arrives to their town and the trio decide to go away from the place before Geetha's family manage to catch up to them. All this while, Geetha's family has grown really fond of Arya.

Arya plans for the duo to go to America, but Ajay, unbeknownst to Arya, changes the plan for them to go to Australia, for he fears that Arya will somehow stop them from escaping.  As Ajay and Geetha are about to escape, Geetha's father arrives with his entourage and finds them. Ajay is enraged and believes that it is Arya who's called them, but Geetha reveals that she has called them because she believed what they were doing wasn't fair to both Arya and her family, and hoped to talk things out with them instead of betraying their trust. Geetha's father wants her to be with Arya in stead of Ajay, because he realizes how much Arya really treasures and cherishes her. He attempts to stab Ajay, but Arya rescues him and gets stabbed instead. Arya is rushed to the hospital where it is seen that Geetha is truly in love with Arya.  At the end, Arya asks Ajay to press a button. Unknowingly, Ajay does so. Suddenly, Arya starts suffocating for the supply of oxygen is stopped. Geetha is beyond angry at Ajay and slaps him for doing so. Having planned all this to make Geetha hate Ajay, Arya then says sorry to Ajay. Ajay just smiles and walks out.

Assault of Darkness
 The film opens with a man setting up a deadly trap, and luring a creature from the darkness by puncturing a drum of water. He successfully kills the creature and is briefly attacked by another who comes out of the bog. These appear to be normal people, capable of survival under the bog's depths. The man shrugs off the attacks and continues on into the night.  Meanwhile, an [[archaeology]] [[Professor]] (David Wallace) is teaching a class of students about ancient sacrifices that had taken place in Ireland centuries ago. One student with a great deal of questions confronts the mummified remains of a sacrifice, and abruptly leaves the room. Upon investigation he finds that she is a hired assistant (Saiorse Reilly) and she leaves with him on an archaeological evaluation of some of the local hillsides. During this time a pair of travelers (Hannah Ross and her cousin Mallory) break down in an automobile they had stolen and head off on foot. Along the way, Mallory sprains her ankle, and she and Hannah take refuge in a remote cabin at the central area of the bog. A woman named Val Leary and her cab driver (Deano Doyle) get stuck in the bog and inadvertently find their way to the cabin, shortly afterward David and Saiorse arrive, having run into a cow on a nearby road. As the six strangers learn to live together, they are greeted by the outraged owner of the house known simply as "Hunter" or "The Hunter" who invites them in for the night, promising to show them the road out the following morning. As they dine over supper, they regale stories of personal heroisms between one another; Deano states he had once rushed a woman giving birth to children to a hospital, Mallory and Hannah had saved the life of a child's father who had fallen into the bog off chance. While Val admits she had dug up one of the "Bog Men" sacrifices, though she lies and says she did it some time prior and had called the police (which she had not done when she uncovered it earlier the same day). David sparks suspicion and Val and Deano leave. Hunter shortly after decides to go hunting, and provides bedding for the rest to lay on.  During the night, Saiorse has a bad dream and David comforts her.  The following morning, they find Deano but a large man who had earlier been resurrected from the Bog itself appears, causing Mallory to fall into a [[bog pool]], nearly drowning, Hunter is able to free her, revealing Val's body who had apparently attempted to grab Mallory from under the bog. Now extremely ill, Mallory is taken back to the cabin, and Hunter is put under Saiorce's scrutiny saying he could have killed them. Deano is led back to the road his Taxi had gotten stuck on, but admits to Hunter he had lied about his story, accidentally killing a fare by catching her coat into the back door of his cab and dragging her to death afterward stashing her body into the swamp. After Hunter parts, Deano attempts to free his taxi and is accidentally dragged to his death as well. Back at the cabin, Hannah departs to find another way out of the bog and ends up getting captured by the giant man. David attempts to intervene and calm the bog man down, but Hunter shoots him, and in his rage the man [[decapitates]] Hannah. Upon his return, Mallory tells David that they had lied about their stories as well, that they had accidentally hit an old trench digger walking along the road and buried him near the bog. Dying shortly after, David realizes that their stories seem to have prompted this, Saiorse tells David that she too killed a man, her uncle who constantly beat and [[raped]] her, even giving her a [[still born]] child. And Hunter claims that a man he had saved in the forest "could have" been saved, instead he killed the man to stop his agony after he accidentally shot him in the first place. The bog man returns, kills Hunter who manages to give David a clue to killing him, when the man is distracted by the water pouring from the cabin's shower, David throws fire into it as it had been laced with gasoline and causes the man as well as the cabin to go up in a ball of fire, allowing David and Saiorse to escape. As they watch, the bog man runs in flames from the house and returns to the bog.  
Assassin's Creed: Lineage
 The story is a prequel to the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''. It centers on Giovanni Auditore, the father of the game's main character, [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]].  Giovanni is an Assassin living in 15th-century [[Italy]] during the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]. At this dawn of a new era, a conspiracy is being plotted by one corrupt family to overthrow the powerful [[House of Medici|Medici family]] and destroy a unified Italy. As an Assassin, Giovanni must face this threat and bring the guilty parties to justice. The story introduces the situation before ''Assassin's Creed II'', and the enemies of both Giovanni and his son Ezio.  ===Episodes=== ;Episode  1  In the city of [[Florence]] in 1476, the Assassin Giovanni Auditore monologues on how, hidden behind the enlightenment of the Renaissance, corruption, betrayal and murder are rife, but that in order to preserve justice, honor and the safety of his family, he will fight. From the shadows, he quietly watches his family enjoying themselves at dinner, before departing into the moonlit streets of Florence. Outside, he ambushes a party of mercenaries led by [[Pope Alexander VI|Rodrigo Borgia]] as they attempt to sneak out of the city under cover of darkness. Giovanni is able to kill two of the mercenaries and incapacitate the third, but Borgia escapes in the confusion.  Giovanni brings the injured man to his master, [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], and warns Lorenzo that he has heard rumors of an approaching event that will trigger a shift in power. Lorenzo has the captive interrogated; under torture on the [[Rack (torture)|rack]], the prisoner confesses that in the city of [[Milan]], on the day after Christmas, [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza|the Duke of Milan]] will be assassinated during the [[St Stephen's Day|Feast of St Stephen]], when the church bell strikes for the twelfth and final time. Giovanni races to Milan and finds the Duke at Mass in church, but is unable to intervene before the Duke is killed. The murderers are swiftly dispatched by the Duke's guards and Giovanni himself; however, Giovanni's efforts to try to subdue one of the killers for interrogation fail, as the guard kills the last assassin. Giovanni searches the body of one of the killers, finding a purse of gold coins stamped with the coat of arms of [[Venice]].  Returning home, Giovanni watches his elder sons play chess, advising his younger son [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze|Ezio]] on how to become a better player. In private, he monologues that the Duke of Milan's death has robbed Medici of a powerful ally, and that even now, his enemies will be plotting their next move. However, he now knows where to find them...  ;Episode  2  Giovanni arrives in Venice to investigate the possibility that whoever ordered the Duke of Milan's assassination is hiding in the city. His investigations lead him to [[St Mark's Basilica]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], where, after killing a guard to cover his tracks, he eavesdrops on a group of men (Silvio and Marco Barbarigo) conversing in a nearby room. He sees them dispatch a courier carrying a letter for 'their master' in Rome, insisting its delivery is of great importance. Giovanni tracks and intercepts the courier in Venice's back alleys; after a lengthy fight, Giovanni overpowers the courier and tries to interrogate him, but the courier refuses to talk, and kills himself on Giovanni's blade. Furious, Giovanni takes the letter, which bears the seal of the Barbarigo family, and returns to [[Florence]].  Back in Florence, Giovanni presents the letter to Lorenzo de' Medici: however, it is encrypted, written in a strange code. Lorenzo's aide, the [[Gonfaloniere of Justice]] Uberto Alberti states it will take some time to decode, and sends Giovanni home to get some rest, promising to call him when it is done. A priest in Medici's service (Father Antonio Maffei) translates the letter and presents it to Uberto, who tells Fr. Maffei to summon Giovanni and Lorenzo, but warns him to tell no one of the letter's contents. Back at his villa, Giovanni enjoys some time with his wife and family, before being summoned by Maffei to the palace. His son Ezio is confused as to why his father must leave so late in the night, and asks to go with him, but Giovanni refuses.  At the palace, Uberto claims they were unable to translate the letter, and therefore the only way to see who it is intended for is to take it to Rome and deliver it personally. In spite of the danger, Giovanni volunteers to take it; Lorenzo instructs him to find his enemies... and show no mercy.  Back in Venice, the Barbarigos, with Rodrigo Borgia at their head, pray ''"May [[Baphomet|The Father of Understanding]] be with us!"'' (confirming they are [[Knights Templar|Templars]]) and prepare themselves for battle, arranging their swords in a [[Cross pattée|familiar symbol]].  ;Episode  3  Giovanni arrives in Rome and delivers the letter as ordered, which is passed through the crowd until it reaches Borgia; Borgia goes straight to the [[Holy See|Vatican]], where he delivers the letter to [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The pair discuss the fact that Lorenzo de' Medici is unwilling to bend to the Pope's authority; when Borgia suggests he could use force, the Pope agrees to lend his spiritual support and military aid to [[Pazzi conspiracy|an endeavour to restore order in Florence]].  When Borgia leaves, he is followed by Giovanni, but he manages to give Giovanni the slip, and disappears into [[St Peter's Basilica]]. As Giovanni investigates inside, he is confronted by Borgia, who addresses him by name and remarks that what follows next is of his making. He appreciates that Giovanni's skills would be of much use to the Templar cause, and that if Giovanni joins them, he will live to see 'a new world'. When Giovanni refuses, and remarks the only way this will end is with an Assassin's blade in Borgia's throat, Borgia sneers "We shall see!", and orders his men to attack. Giovanni fights bravely and defeats his attackers, but is struck in the chest with a [[throwing knife]] by Borgia, and his hidden blade is broken. Though he survives, Borgia uses the distraction to escape.  Badly wounded, Giovanni returns home to Florence, where his wife tends to his wounds. He confesses to her his fear that the Duke of Milan's assassination was merely the start of a conspiracy, and that the next blow will strike Florence; he fears for the safety of de'Medici, his allies and himself.  Suddenly, Father Antonio Maffei, along with some armed men of the city guard, arrive at the house, asking for Giovanni. Giovanni has his elder son Federico tell the guards he has already left, then escapes through a hidden passage.  Back in Rome, Borgia and his fellow Templars agree that the main threat to their plans is Giovanni; however, Borgia says he has a plan to deal with the Assassin, and that with him gone, nothing will stand in their way.  Back in Florence, Giovanni prowls the streets (pausing to muse when he sees Ezio flirting with his girlfriend in the street), monologuing that dark days are approaching Florence and time is running out; the final battle is about to begin. He remarks that no matter what happens, he and his sons are ''"the Auditore da Firenze, and we are Assassins!"''  The film concludes with the message ''"The conclusion... is in your hands"'', setting the stage for ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''.

Avatar (2009 film)
  In 2154, humans have depleted [[Earth]]'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — [[unobtainium|unobtanium]] — on Pandora, a densely forested [[habitable moon]] orbiting the [[gas giant]] Polyphemus in the [[Alpha Centauri]] star system.<ref name="Horwitz2009"></ref> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the [[Pandoran biosphere#Naʼvi|Na'vi]], a species of , blue-skinned, [[Wisdom|sapient]] humanoids<ref>Rottenberg, Josh. "James Cameron Talks ''Avatar'': Brave Blue World," ''Entertainment Weekly'' No. 1081 (, 2009): 48.</ref> that live in harmony with nature and worship a [[mother goddess]] named Eywa.  To explore [[Pandoran biosphere|Pandora's biosphere]], scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former [[United States Marine|Marine]], replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a [[Pandoran biosphere#Fauna|thanator]] and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.  [[Colonel]] Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's [[private military company|private security force]], promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<ref name="Script25"></ref> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an [[wikt:outpost|outpost]]. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<ref name="Script8and15"></ref> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.  Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the [[biological neural network]] native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.  To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred [[Fictional universe in Avatar#The Tree of Souls|Tree of Souls]] and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a [[Preemptive war|pre-emptive strike]] against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.  During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when [[Characters and wildlife in Avatar#Fauna|Pandoran wildlife]] unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an [[mecha|AMP suit]], escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.  With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.  
Aversion (film)
 This original story marries three different elements into one plot.  Alex Stokes (Andrew Roth) is a self-destructive, down-on-his-luck investigator who takes cases wherever he can. When a mysterious man offers him a healthy sum to follow his beautiful wife Claire (Melantha Blackthorne), Alex can't resist. Her seemingly mundane day-to-day activities take a strange turn when she tries to kill herself.   After saving her, their chemistry proves too much to resist and they become romantically entangled. But the fun has just begun as her [[demonic possession]]s escalate and Alex's entire town gets sucked into a [[vortex]] of [[evil]]. Can one lost soul get it together in time to save mankind?  The movie is considered a [[film noir]] because it involves a self-destructive, down-and-out investigator who takes on a case that may be more than he can handle. Incorporating standard elements like a beautiful woman, excessive drinking and subtle [[voiceover]], the piece is set up like a standard detective film.  
Ayan (film)
  Deva ([[Suriya]]) arrives at the [[Chennai International Airport]] after running an errand for Arumuga Dass ([[Prabhu Ganesan]]) of smuggling pre-release [[copyright infringement|unlicensed movies]] on DVD. The two leave for their hideout and instruct Dilli ([[Karunas]]), a hearing-impaired assistant of Dass, to make copies of the DVD. Just when police crews arrive into their vicinity, Dass informs Deva and the rest to leave. Deva tells the others to leave while he quickly sets up the burning process. Deva also leaves the hideout just in time. However, the police officers arrive at the hideout, only to see the burning process of the DVDs complete. The police then seize the DVDs and computers. The inspector, who was a friend of Dass, tells him that he can close the case if one of Dass's men agrees to the crime. Deva attempts to go, but another man, Chitti ([[Jagan]]), who had no affiliation to them volunteers, takes the blame. Later, Chitti joins Dass's group and befriends Deva.  Dass is a [[diamond]]  [[Smuggling|trafficker]] who smuggles diamonds from [[Africa]]. Deva's mother Kaveri ([[Renuka (actress)|Renuka]]) does not appreciate his [[affairs]] with Dass, as she wants Deva, who holds a [[Master of Science]] degree, to have a government job. He occasionally visits home and her roadside grocery shop, only to get scoldings from his loving mother. When Deva is invited to Chitti's house, he gets impatient and knocks on the door. As the door opens, Deva slips and falls on the bed, expecting to see Chitti but scaring his younger sister Yamuna ([[Tamannaah]]) instead. Just before he drives off, he curses himself for making such a stupid mistake. Yamuna catches this and accepts his apologies, then they slowly fall in love, their relationship is accepted by Chitti . Meanwhile, Kamalesh ([[Akashdeep Saighal]]), the arch-enemy and competitor in smuggling of Dass slowly starts to try to foil Dass and his employees. A prank phone call from Chitti leads to a near-death experience for Deva and Kaveri. Escaping alive and outraged, Deva goes and confronts Chitti, releasing his anger to the full extent. Chitti then reveals that he was Kamalesh's personal spy and that even though that their bosses were foes, he was happy to be a friend of Deva. Disgusted, he leaves and Chitti too, and at that moment, Yamuna arrives, hearing everything. Thus, this stir of events causes the interval of the movie.  After these events, Deva and Yamuna break up. In [[Malaysia]], under circumstances, Chitti and Deva meet. Chitti, who was fed with [[drugs]] fall prey to them and starts reacting. In a last attempt to rekindle their friendship, Deva attempts to save him. Chitti then explains that it was wrong of him to be a spy, but still admits that he was lucky to have him as a friend. He dies when Kamalesh's henchmen try to salvage the drugs by cutting him open. Heartbroken, Deva returns to [[India]].  When he arrives, Yamuna approaches him and asks the police officers to arrest him. But she notices Chitti's phone which he recorded a video before dying, brings it out, which contains a recording how Chitti died, also she sent the video to Dass. It is here clear that Deva didn't kill him, but hid from Kamalesh's henchmen. Yamuna apologises to Deva and the two come together again. Then later circumstances force Deva to become a part of the security squad in the airport as he is accused by Parthiban ([[Ponvannan]]), Assistant Commissioner of [[Income Tax Air Intelligence Unit]] of carrying drugs. He denies it, saying that the packet of drugs was given by a passenger's relative as she had forgotten it. The drugs are opened and it is found that Heroin is sealed in them. Deva then realises and explains that huge amount of drugs are being transported by distracting him with a small amount. The flight is delayed and all passengers are asked to take food from the canteen. There are a few who don't do so, and hence their stomach is X-Rayed and a huge packet of heroin is found. Then Deva is asked to help Parthiban and the Customs for arresting Kamalesh.  Deva and Parthiban put a cab like room outside Kamalesh's house and with Yamuna's help, a transmitter is put in Kamalesh's study. Then, all his conversations with his clients are recorded but Kamalesh later finds out and attempts to kill them, which fails. He later finds out that idols made of heroin are compressed under high pressure to disguise their smell and properties. With this evidence, the Income Tax comes to raid Kamalesh's house but he acts quickly and removes all the stuff. During a final attempt to arrest Kamalesh, the truth is forced out of his accountant but Kamalesh kills him to avoid any witnesses. Later, Deva's house is almost burnt and Dass is killed by Kamalesh, which infuriates Deva. He is then forced to go to Africa and confront Kamalesh.  When he returns to India, he is again inspected by the Custom Officer. Deva learns that it was his mother this time who exposed his smuggling mission. He has no choice but to surrender the diamonds, and so he does. Parthiban hands Deva to sign a form, which Deva hesitates. He then learns that is a government security job application form. Parthiban says that Deva's criminal mind is required for such a job in the Customs. He then asks what had happened to Kamalesh to which Deva replies that he had gone to Congo to strike a business deal. Then a flashback shows that when Kamalesh was returning from stealing the diamonds, his gang is killed by Deva and he is pushed off the cliff. The film ends on a happy note as Deva leaves the airport with his mother and Yamuna.

Awaydays
 The film begins in 1979 with Paul Carty ([[Nicky Bell]]), with his sister Molly, ([[Holliday Grainger]]) and father, at his mother's graveside. After his sister escorts her dad away from the grave, Carty, looking at his watch, starts to run off. Along his way he gets changed into casual clothing and carries on running until he catches a football special train.  Aboard the train, he meets the leader of the football firm, John Godden ([[Stephen Graham (actor)|Stephen Graham]]), an ex-soldier who warns him he has no room for runners in his firm and he best stand his ground. When walking through the train, he meets Elvis ([[Liam Boyle (actor)|Liam Boyle]]), and Carty reminisces about how they met in a series of flashbacks. We learnt that Carty has always been fascinated by The Pack, observing them at Tranmere games when they fight and trying to dress like them, at which point Baby Millan ([[Oliver Lee (actor)|Oliver Lee]]), taunts Carty and threatens him but Elvis leads the other lads away and Carty stands his ground. Carty eventually meets Elvis at a club night and the pair realise they have many things in common from music taste to wanting out of Birkenhead. The pair fantasise about leaving for Berlin. Carty, over their next few meetings, begs Elvis to introduce him to The Pack but Elvis calls them a "gang of pricks" and says Carty does not want to be involved. Eventually, after Carty headbutts a rude sales assistant in a record shop to prove his fighting skills, Elvis gives in and tells him to meet him on the train at 12:00 on Saturday.  It fast-forwards onto the train again, and The Pack are led by Godden to meet a rival firm. Once there, the two groups scrap and Carty is taken over by a thrill as he is embroiled in the fight. Carty returns home and we discover that his sister knows about his fascination with The Pack. The next day, Carty promises to take her shopping for her birthday in Chester. However, after an argument with Elvis when Elvis tells him he is making a "twat out of himself", Carty leaves work to find Elvis there. The pair go for a drink and forget about their argument, and Carty forgets completely about his sister. He promises he will take her out another time the day after, as his mind is firmly on the meet The Pack has when they travel to Wrexham that day. Once there, police attempt to form a barrier between the firms but Carty breaks through and cuts a Wrexham fan with his Stanley - much to the delight of Godden, who finally accepts him as one of The Pack. Everyone toasts Carty on the train home, except Baby Millan and Elvis who are far from happy about his new status. That night at The Pelican, the HQ and chosen pub of The Pack, Carty is "initiated" with a girl who he takes outside to have sex with. Once out there, Godden warns Baby Millan to not deal heroin to the members of the firm, warning The Pack cannot have any "smackheads". Baby replies "But it's okay for Elvis to do it?", much to the puzzlement of Godden and the rest of the firm. Outside, Carty does not perform well with the girl, and the lads all rib him for this.  Carty and Elvis one night meet two women, Sonia ([[Rebecca Atkinson]]) and Jackie on a bus and take them back to Elvis' bohemian-style flat, which has stars on the wall and a noose to remind him of the "certainty of death". Elvis' behaviour becomes erratic as he consumes heroin, and when Carty refuses, Elvis rejects Sonia's advances and plays the guitar instead. Carty, waking up, sees Sonia in the bathroom and the pair have sex. The next day, Elvis and Carty are on their way to another away day when the pair argue in front of Godden. Elvis, taunting Carty's choice of women, is obviously hurt when Carty taunts his performance in bed with the women in front of The Pack. Godden taunts Elvis for taking heroin. Carty tries to apologise to Elvis as the pair walk in front of The Pack, and Carty spots the opposition firm coming towards them. He yells at the firm and urges The Pack to join them - and Godden does, only briefly, before headbutting Carty and telling him he is the leader of The Pack. Carty's reign as a top boy in the firm is over and Elvis is back to his jovial self on the train home as Carty sulks in the corner.  Carty forgets about the Pack for a while and we see him telling his boss, Uncle Bob, that he will go back to college to do his Foundation Course. He spends more time with his sister and he urges her to go out one night. In a taxi, Carty meets a pretty girl, Natasha ([[Sacha Parkinson]]), whom he had previously met in a club. The pair are spending a romantic night in when Carty's sister enters, visibly shaken up. She has been roughed up by a gang of boys and Carty, attempting to sort them out, is beaten up by them too. He recruits the help of Elvis and The Pack (without Godden, who Elvis informs him, has been killed by Baby Millan after a disagreement in The Pelican). The Pack beat up the gang of lads who roughed up Carty's sister, and Carty finds Elvis crying on the waterfront. Carty thanks him and says he owes Elvis one, but Elvis replies Carty does not owe him anything, and tells Carty "He always loved you, Carty".  At Godden's funeral, Carty is sitting in the church after everyone leaves when Elvis enters and asks Carty if he will hear his confession. Carty, confused, agrees. Elvis is seen through the confession booth inhaling what appears to be heroin, and he tells Carty to come away with him to Berlin. Carty, currently enjoying a healthy relationship with his family, tells him he cannot yet. Elvis is upset by this, and tells him "He always loved you Carty", meaning himself. Elvis asks Carty for one more away day, before leaving.  At the final away day, Carty is stood on the station platform waiting for Elvis to meet him yet there is no sign of him. He catches the train just in time and as the train pulls away, Elvis is visible sat on top of a bridge overlooking the track, as the train crosses underneath it, the bridge is covered in smoke and once it clears, Elvis has gone, hinting at suicide. Carty is out of place in The Pack without Elvis and after a final meet with a local firm in which Carty does not get involved, he is cut with a knife by Baby Millan, who calls him a "ponce". Carty then turns away from The Pack and walks out of the street, saying "How long had I waited for this day? Out of here. Out of this."

Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans
 In August 2005, Terence McDonagh ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is a [[New Orleans]] [[police sergeant]]. While cleaning out a locker after [[Hurricane Katrina]], he notices that a prisoner may not have been transferred. When he finds the prisoner about to drown, he mocks him before eventually jumping in the water to save him. He is promoted to [[police lieutenant]] and given a medal for his work, but has suffered a serious back injury because of the rescue. As a result, he is prescribed [[Vicodin]] which he will most likely need to take for the rest of his life to manage the pain.  Six months later, McDonagh is now not only [[Drug addiction|addicted]] to [[painkiller]]s, but is habitually using several other drugs including [[cocaine]] and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. He has convinced a person that works in the police department to bring him drugs sent to the [[Property room|evidence room]]. His girlfriend Frankie Donnenfeld ([[Eva Mendes]]), a [[prostitute]], also does cocaine and they often share drugs. He has also become estranged from his father Pat ([[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]]), a recovering alcoholic who can only bring himself to attend to his [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings and nothing else, and his alcoholic stepmother, Genevieve ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]). Over the course of the film, he uses his position as an officer to bully people and steal more drugs.  McDonagh is assigned to investigate the murders of five [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] from [[Senegal]], who were killed for selling drugs in a gang leader's neighborhood. The gang leader, Big Fate ([[Xzibit|Alvin 'Xzibit' Joiner]]), has two associates: Midget ([[Lucius Baston]]) and G (Tim Bellow). After both are arrested, Big Fate willingly comes to the police station with his lawyer. As they try to gather evidence against Big Fate, McDonagh goes back to a hotel room where he finds Frankie beaten by one of her clients, a seemingly well-connected man named Justin ([[Shea Whigham]]). McDonagh threatens Justin and takes $10,000 from him. Later on, a delivery boy who was an auditory witness of the murder scene goes missing. McDonagh finds the witness's grandmother, who works at a nursing home, and threatens to kill one of her patients to make her divulge where the witness has gone. The old woman has sent him to stay with her family in [[England]], to prevent him from getting involved in gang affairs.  In addition to dealing with the murder investigation, McDonagh gets in trouble with his [[bookie]] Ned ([[Brad Dourif]]) for not paying his debts. What little money McDonagh has is given to a gangster who works for Justin. The gangster now requests $50,000 - five times the amount stolen from Justin - as compensation, and gives McDonagh two days to get it. As a result of his treatment of the old woman, McDonagh is on modified duty and his gun placed in the evidence room. Now angry, McDonagh goes to Big Fate and they become partners, with McDonagh supplying Big Fate with police information. McDonagh now has enough money to pay off his debts to his bookie and uses his surplus earnings to place a new bet. During a celebration of the successful partnership between McDonagh and Big Fate, the gangster shows up, demanding his money. McDonagh offers him a cut worth more than $50,000 from a bag filled with pure heroin, but the gangster wants to take it all. Big Fate and his crew end up killing the gangsters.  To further celebrate their partnership, McDonagh implores Big Fate to smoke crack cocaine with his "lucky crack pipe". He does, and McDonagh later plants the pipe at the murder scene of the Senegal family. The department uses this new evidence to arrest Big Fate and his cronies, but when he and McDonagh are alone with Big Fate, McDonagh's partner, Stevie Pruit ([[Val Kilmer]]), threatens to kill Big Fate, as he doesn't want him to have the chance to escape conviction. McDonagh is outraged at this idea and arrests Big Fate, showing that despite his addictions he can still perform his duties as an officer. McDonagh is later promoted to [[police captain]].  One year later, McDonagh appears to be sober, as do Frankie (who is pregnant with McDonagh's child) and McDonagh's parents, but it turns out that McDonagh is still taking heroin. He encounters the prisoner whom he saved at the beginning of the film, and the man, recognizing McDonagh, exclaims that McDonagh saved his life. The man has been sober for almost a year and offers to help McDonagh finally escape his own addiction. McDonagh simply asks, "Do fish have dreams?" The film ends with the two men in an aquarium, sitting on the floor with their backs against a wall-sized fish tank.  
Balibo (film)
 The story is seen through the eyes of veteran journalist [[Roger East (journalist)|Roger East]]. Introduced as a once-fearless foreign correspondent now working in [[public relations|PR]] in Darwin, East is drawn to East Timor by [[José Ramos-Horta]] of [[Fretilin]]; then the fledgling republic's charismatic young secretary of foreign affairs. Initially refusing to become involved, East changes his tune after Ramos-Horta shows him photos of five Australian TV reporters missing in the border town of Balibo.  Vignettes then show [[Greg Shackleton]], Gary Cunningham, Malcolm Rennie, Brian Peters and Tony Stewart, all under 30, saying goodbye to loved ones and setting out on their assignments a month earlier.  Parallel action follows with the [[Balibo Five]] tracked from East Timor's capital to their terrifying end after filming the Indonesian advance, and East and Ramos-Horta retracing their steps through by now extremely dangerous territory. Shackleton's last surviving report is recreated: sitting in a village, he says its inhabitants don't know if they will be alive tomorrow and have asked him why no one in Australia or anywhere else will help.  Drawing attention to the techniques of news gathering and delivery in 1975, the film raises the idea of what might have happened had the [[Balibo Five]] not been cut off from communicating with the world and slowed by heavy 16mm film equipment.  Bookended by contemporary scenes of a fictional East Timorese woman remembering East and life under Indonesian occupation, the film closes with a tribute to the nation's rebirth in 1999 and the many tens of thousands of lives lost in the struggle for independence.<ref name="screendaily.com"/><ref name="variety.com"></ref>

Bandslam
 Will Burton ([[Gaelan Connell]]) is a music enthusiast and a [[David Bowie]] fan with a hint of rock and roll and boy next door. Throughout the movie, Will writes journal-like e-mails to Bowie every day, although Bowie never answers. When Will's mother Karen ([[Lisa Kudrow]]) finds a new job, he switches to a new school, which he is eager to do since he was bullied at his previous one. During lunch one day at his new school, he meets a girl who says her name is written Sa5m but pronounced Sam, the 5 is silent ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]). She tells him about Bandslam, an annual music competition in which the winning band gets a recording contract. Will and Sa5m quickly become friends but, shortly after, he is sought after by another girl named Charlotte Barnes ([[Aly Michalka]]). One afternoon, Charlotte asks Will to join her in an after-school day-care center. When she starts inviting him to hang out with her, the teenager is stunned—as is his single mother Karen. Impressed by his eclectic knowledge of music, Charlotte, who is a gifted singer-songwriter, asks Will to manage her rock/[[ska]] band. Her goal is apparently to take revenge on her [[egocentric]] musician ex-boyfriend Ben Wheatley ([[Scott Porter]]) during Bandslam.  Unsure of what he is getting himself into, Will agrees to help Charlotte's band (later called I Can't Go On, I'll Go On) which includes Bug ([[Charlie Saxton]]) and Omar ([[Tim Jo]]), eventually expanding it with more like-minded outcasts. Against all odds, the group's sound starts to come together and their prospects for success look bright. Will starts losing his "loser-status", but the band gets in the way of completing a project he was going to do with Sa5m. After spending a day with Sa5m, Charlotte teaches Will how to properly kiss a girl, by demonstrating on him that night, which his mother sees. Will takes Sa5m to the Overlook and, after an awkward start, successfully kisses her, after which Sa5m shyly asks Will to accompany her to a movie screening, which he agrees to. However, Will stands Sa5m up, breaking the date for a concert with Charlotte.  After that, Sa5m starts ignoring Will at school; he visits her house, hoping to apologize. Her mom shows him a video of a younger Sa5m performing "[[Everything I Own]]", leading Sa5m to be outraged and order Will to leave. As an apology, he makes a touching documentary short about her for his Human Studies project (with the song "[[Young Folks]]" included in it) and she eventually forgives him.  After Will accidentally ruins Ben's attempt to reconcile with Charlotte, Ben decides to do a little research on him, in order to ruin his image. He finds out about Will's father, who was sent to prison years ago when he accidentally killed a child while [[driving drunk]]. Ben then starts to call Will "Dewey" (just as other students did at his old school), which stands for "DWI" ("Driving While Intoxicated"). Will detests this nickname because it reminds him of his father, whom he is ashamed of. What is more, Charlotte's father dies and she decides to quit the band. As she explains to Will, her father hated how she acted when she was with her ex-boyfriend, so after he got sick, she decided to change her image and be nicer to "people like [Will]", meaning outcasts, hoping that this good behavior would cause her dad to get well. The band members are hurt by this discovery, as it means she did not genuinely like them, but they decide to go on nonetheless, with Sa5m taking over as lead singer.  On the night of Bandslam, Charlotte comes backstage in order to apologize to the band, and after a moment of hesitation, Will accepts her apology. Right before going on stage, however, they discover that Ben's band (the "Glory Dogs") have decided to play the song that I Can't Go On, I'll Go On were originally to perform, forcing them to change their act at the last minute. Will suddenly remembers the video Sa5m's mother showed him earlier and suggests that they perform "Everything I Own", since it is the only other song Sa5m knows. To buy some time, Will comes out first onstage, but at first he is embarrassingly silent. The students begin to chant "Dewey! Dewey! Dewey!". He starts to walk off the stage, but then comes back and decides to chant with them instead. After carrying the chant for a while, he finally changes it to, "Do we wanna ROCK?!". The band then shows up and fires up the crowd with an upbeat ska version of "[[Everything I Own]]".  Although they fail to win the competition, a [[YouTube]] video of their performance gains the band popularity at school. [[David Bowie]] (portraying himself) sees the video and sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band as one of their first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls down in the middle of the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's [[Lodger (album)|Lodger album]]). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony where Will and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.

 Hari ([[Shashank (actor)|Shashank]]) is a junkie with enough rage to cause heat waves on Pluto. He turned out this way because he's never seen his dad, who unceremoniously ditched his unmarried mother, who then died some years later. Now Hari's going around getting doped up with ganja etc., and beating up lecturers. His college wants to expel him, but Ravindra ([[Jagapati Babu]]), chairman of the board, declines to do so. He wants to reform Hari and make him top the college. A de-addiction session makes Hari behave like a bull that just saw Govinda's pants, but Ravi plods on.  Meanwhile, in a soggy romantic track, Ravi gets hitched with Meera ([[Meera Jasmine]]) when he sees her at a traffic light. Now, Meera's complaint is that Ravi keeps dashing away to attend to Hari. The last straw is when Ravi bunks his engagement to be with him. Even Ravi's family is dead against such behaviour. They don't want him, the chairman of a few dozen companies, getting so close to a wastrel. Maybe because Hari, a supporting character, is eclipsing him with his acting skills.  Now Ravi is forced to tell everyone his secret - Hari's father is none other than Ravi's deceased father. Apparently, the dying gentleman (Murali Mohan) had revealed many secrets in a VCD which he gave Ravi. At this, his mother ([[Jayasudha]]) faints. How could her husband do this? He gets away with being in a garlanded photograph and a couple of flashback scenes, whereas she is stuck with this smelly script.  However, she decides she can do nothing but join Ravi in paying for her husband's mistake. She, Ravi and her daughter ([[Hema (actress)|Hema]]) go all out to help the 'other' family in every way they can. But Ravi's elder brother Rajendra ([[Sonu Sood]]) is still cheesed off at the whole thing. He just delivered an all-time blockbuster, and now, this? He makes sure Hari gets to know the murky truth, albeit in a very tasteless way.<ref name="Story"></ref>

Corinne tells her friends about her dream to become a musketeer and they are surprised at first but also excited because the three girls also have the same dreams of being musketeers too.  An old maid named Helen overhears their conversation and takes them through a secret passageway, where she leads them to the old musketeer's training room and agrees to train the four girls to be true musketeers. Soon the four girls are practicing their skills with Helen's help.  One day, while Corinne is cleaning the windows, she spots the prince hanging from his flying hot-air balloon and runs to help him. The prince thanks Corinne and they immediately fall in love. While on the balloon, she finds that the rope attached has been cut, just like the chandelier in the castle. When the prince says girls can't be musketeers, she storms off angrily and tells her friends what happened Helen warns her and the girls to keep eyes and ears open for enemies, otherwise, Prince Louis will be in grave danger. Miette sneaks to the castle, with Corinne's horse, Alexander's, help to join training with Corinne and her friends. Finally, their training with musketeering skills is complete and Helen is very impressed.  One night, Corinne, Viveca, Aramina, and Renee decide to celebrate their musketeering skills and take a walk into the dark, quiet streets. They encounter men led by man named Regent who pulls out a knife and Corrine realizes it matches the gem she found next to the chandelier rope. They discover that the Regent's men were sneaking weapons into the masquerade ball to kill Louis so that his evil cousin Phillippe will be the new king.  Corinne and her friends decided to save Prince Louis from Phillippe and his men.  They try to tell Treville but no one believes them and they are banned from the castle. They wear disguises and sneak into the ball without being caught. The prince chooses to dance with Corinne, though he does not recognize her with her mask on. The evil men capture Treville and the other musketeers, attack the girls and throw Louis into the passageways where Phillippe chases him to the roof tops. In the end after fighting the men and untying Treville and the musketeers, Corinne saves Louis just in time and they arrest Phillippe, Regent, Brutus and the their men.

Barbarossa (film)
  "Italy. 12th century AD.  Northern Italy is ruled over by a German Emperor: Frederick I Hohenstaufen, known as 'Barbarossa'.  His dream is to conquer also Central and Southern Italy, thus reviving the ancient empire founded by Charlemagne.  But in the North a young man from Milan has formed an army of 900 young men from different cities: the 'Company of Death'.  This young man's name is Alberto Giussano.  His dream is to defeat the Emperor and to regain freedom for the Northern lands."  The Emperor Barbarossa is out hunting when he is attacked by a wild boar, but is saved by a young boy.  Rather, he is the boy's Emperor, Frederick Hohenstaufen, better known as Barbarossa. With this the boy introduces himself as Alberto da Giussano, son of Giovanni; the grateful emperor gives Alberto his imperial dagger inscribed with his name.  A few years later, in the German city of Würzburg, Barbarossa is going to see Hildegard von Bingen, the great seër. He plans to marry for the second time. The seër says that the wedding is blessed. Then she says Frederick of Swabia's name will be remembered for centuries, but to beware of water for it will bring his death.  At the wedding, Henry, Duke of Saxony, is marrying a young French girl.  The story cuts to [[Milan]] where Evandro calls over to the now grown Alberto and tells him to get onto his cart because they must reach the river before dawn. They reach the river and start to load their goods onto a boat there. Lodigiani soldiers arrive and say the merchants crossed through their territory in the night and now they must pay their dues.  Evandro pulls a knife and slits the throat of the soldier next to him then Alberto and his companions slay the other soldiers but Alberto is in the fighting.  His horse brings him back home where two beautiful women, the blonde Tessa and her brunette sister, sister Eleonora. The brunette kisses Alberto's face while he is still unconscious.    Two emissaries from Lodi come to Barbarossa to tell him that the city of Milan is trying to dominate them. Lodi has always been loyal to the Emperor and now they ask him for his help. Barbarossa says he doesn't want to use any force right now on Milan.  He says he will write a letter to Milan and the two emissaries will take it to them.    A German emissary delivers the letter to Milan. He says that he comes in the name of the Emperor. Milan is warned not to attack Lodi on pain of being banished from the Empire. A cleric named Gerado throws the letter on the ground and steps on it. Gerado's colleague, Siniscalco Barozzi is shocked at the behaviour of his friend and he asks the German emissary not to leave. Alberto is also shocked and asks Gerado what is he going to do now. Gerado says he will gather the army and attack Lodi.     Alberto has a nightmare and awakens in fright from his deep sleep. His two brothers tell him that Lodi has been defeated.    Barbarossa is furious that Milan attacked Lodi, but he really has no desire to fight. He says it's as if Milan were trying to force him into fighting them. But Barbarossa's charismatic and supportive new queen wants him to go to Milan and destroy that city. Barbarossa sets out for Milan.    Tessa, Eleanora and father have dinner when Siniscalco Barozzi arrives, asking the father for the hand of his daughter Tessa. Tessa's Father says that Tessa would make a good wife and he will put in a good word for him with her. Eleonora comes to tell Alberto that Siniscalco Barozzi wants to marry Tessa but she says that will never happen. Alberto says that they say she is a witch and jokes that maybe that is how she knows Tessa's future. Eleanora is hurt and angry by the accusation so to pacify her, Alberto he shows her the large knife given to him by Barbarossa himself.  Eleonora touches it and sees a vision of fighting. She recoils from the knife then she runs from the house.     Tessa tells Eleonora that Ranero, one of Alberto's brothers, says he wants to marry her and she returns his feelings.     Siniscalco Barozzi reaches the camp of Barbarossa but The Emperor is not there so the scheming and cowardly Barozzi tells the substitute Rinaldo di Dassel that he has brought Milan's oath of allegiance to Barbarossa. Rinaldo takes the money, but says that Barbarossa is still coming to attack Milan.     Barozzi returns to Milan to warn of the great size of the German army.  In addition, they have a great many war machines.   Barozzi implores the people to surrender Milan but they decide to fight, to Barozzi's irritation.  In Verona at the Adige River, a new bridge has been built to the satisfaction of the Germans. They start crossing the bridge, but soon heavy log rams are send down the river to knock the bridge into sections. German horses and soldiers are tossed into the Adige River.  For Verona siding with Milan and killing many German soldiers, Barbarossa cuts off the ear of one of the Verona emissaries.  Eleonora runs to tell Alberto that the Germans have destroyed the city of Brescia with more than one thousand dead.  Alberto says they are still going to fight to save Milan. Eleonora thinks the battle has already been lost. As Soldiers from the cities of Parma, Cremona, Padua and Ferrara are sent to join forces with Barbarossa, the Germans are approach Milan. The bells are rung and the people come into the fort.   There is a moat around the fortified walls of the city.  The Germans come forward to the moat behind moveable wooden walls.  They start pushing giant kegs into the moat water.  The Milanese archers try to kill the men working on the kegs, but the German have hundreds of crossbowmen firing arrows into the Milanese archers.  Then fire balls are thrown against the Milanese walls and the Milanese buildings inside.  The Milanese fight back with their own fire balls launched at the keg bearers.     Barozzi asks for volunteers to go out and collect food for the people inside the walls. Alberto raises his hand to volunteer, but Barozzi chooses his brother Ranero instead, who did not raise his hand to volunteer. Alberto tells Barozzi to leave his brother alone so Barozzi says then Alberto will go instead of Ranero. Shamed into volunteering, Ranero says he is going for he wants no man to say that he lacks courage. Barozzi wants Ranero to go to battle and die so he can have Tessa all to himself but Tessa, disgusted by Barozzi's cynical manipulations, tells him that if Ranero does not return, she would rather die than be with him.   The Germans then push their towers toward the walls of Milan. On the front of the towers they have tied the Millanese volunteers that went out in the fields to get fresh food for the residents of Milan.  Orders are given not to shoot but Barozzi grabs a crossbow and shoots Ranero dead. Now others start shooting and most of the volunteers are killed.    At night Alberto goes out and up to retrieve the bodies of his two brothers and swears vengeance for their deaths to his father. Eleonora tries to talk him out of going but he will not hear of it.    Alberto slits the tent of Barbarossa and slips in, only to be confronted by Barbarossa who asks where he got his knife and Alberto says some time ago Barbarossa himself gave the knife to him. Out of gratitude for saving his life, Barbarossa lets Alberto go. As Alberto prepares to slip out of the German camp he sees Barozzi come into the camp.    Alberto returns to his father, but now the Germans are pouring through the gates, led by Barozzi whom Alberto wants to kill but he is captured before he can.   Alberto and all the other prisoners are brought before the Emperor, who burns the Milanese flag. He then says that all of Milan will be razed to the ground and all the Milanese must leave the area before sunset.  In Rome Barbarossa chooses the new Pope and now the Pope crowns he and his wife the Emperor and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, respectively. As the Emperor and Empress leave the coronations, a man falls dead in front of them. The Empress demands to know what happened to the man.  A man looks the body over and says the man died of the plague. Barbarossa and his new Queen make plans to flee.  At the Pontida Monastery, men from Milan hold a meeting together in secret. The men are very pessimistic about their chances of ever defeating Barbarossa and rebuilding Milan. Alberto and his friend burst into the meeting and Alberto shouts that they can defeat Barbarossa if they can just stay united and that this time all the cities of Lombardy will unite against the Germans.    Alberto comes to see Eleonora at her father's house. Her asks her where Tessa is and Eleonora tells him she is dead when in fact Tessa has retired to a nunnery following the death of Ranero. Alberto plans to take Eleonora with him this time but Eleonora resists the idea saying that Alberto always treated her just like everyone else. Alberto apologizes to her.    Alberto and Eleonora come to visit with Eleonora's sister-in-law when Barozzi and the imperial German soldiers arrive to collect the Emperor's share of the local harvest.    Alberto tells Eleonora that the Germans treat them like animals and says that it is time to stop running and form an army.    In Rome Barbarossa's men want to leave the plague infested city.  His wife wants him to stay put, but Barbarossa sides with his men and says they are going home.    Alberto tells his men that they will become the "Company of Death" and their motto shall be "Death or freedom". Alberto and his men start rallying volunteers, soon gathering a large force of Lombard men. Eleonora goes to see Tessa in the nunnery. She tells Tessa of the rise of the power of the Lombard League and Tessa tells Eleonora to marry Alberto. Alberto again asks Eleonora again to marry him and this time she agrees however soon after, Barozzi comes to the nunnery to take the Emperor's share of their bounty and to abduct attractive nuns. As Barozzi pulls off the veils of the nuns, he finds Tessa among them. He is ecstatic to find her but Tessa, aware that Barozzi killed her fiancé slashes his face with a dagger and runs to the roof of the nunnery. There she stands on the ledge threatening to plunge to her death. Barozzi begs her not to do it, promising to change his dishonest ways but Tessa fulfils her vow and throws herself to her death rather than be forced to marry him. Far away, her sister senses the death of Tessa and weeps for her.  Barozzi and Eleonora are at the funeral. Eleanora approaches Barozzi and he tearfully tells her that he loved Tessa. Blaming Barozzi for Tessa's suicide, Eleonora is unforgiving and slashes Barozzi's throat, non-fatally wounding him.    News comes to Alberto that Eleonora almost killed Barozzi who has taken Eleonora to the camp of Barbarossa at Alessandria. There they plan to burn her at the stake.  Alberto is enraged upon hearing the news.  At The Empress is frightened by rumours that Eleanora is a witch while Barbarossa is upset because they have been trying for weeks to take the city without success.  He tells his staff to double the digging of the tunnel. His staff tell him that the frequent rains have slowed the digging and the rivers around the city are filled up with water; if the rains continue the rivers will overflow and the whole camp will be submerged. In addition, the rain and mud are destroying the morale of the troops.    The Empress goes to see Eleanora. She sees her right arm has been burned and asks what happened. Eleanora tells her that it is scarring from a lightning strike. The Empress is amazed. Eleonora's cellmate screams that the woman is a witch and she runs to the cell door banging hard on it to be let out. The Empress leaves the cell still wondering how the woman survived.    The tunnel is discovered when there is a cave in opening up a large hole to the sky. When Barbarossa learns of this, he orders that the war machines all be set on fire. They are retreating. Barbarossa says they will retreat to Pavia in Lombardy. His wife advises him to send a message to his cousin Henry the Lion to bring fresh troops for the German army to which Barbarossa agrees but the Empress has an additional request; to free Eleanora because she believes that is protected by God but Barbarossa refuses.  At the Mera River, Emperor Barbarossa and his troops arrive and Barbarossa asks his cousin Henry the Lion when he is going to give the army he promised him. Henry says that war is no longer a luxury that he can afford and he has no soldiers to give to Frederick, but he does have a small chest filled with coins with which Frederick can buy fresh troops. Possessed of great wealth already, Frederick growls that Henry is "useless" and leaves him behind.  Barozzi arrives late to Eleanora's burning but a masked woman is on the pyre which is set alight. He does not see her face but is told that she is Eleanora.  Alberto and the men of the Company of Death prepare to attack the forces of Barbarossa and beforehand Alberto gives his men a speech about fighting for their freedom.    In Legnano, to the North of Milan, The German army faces what they think is only the Milanese army.  They are roughly two miles away on the plain and Barbarossa is sure of victory. He gives the order to take the Empress to Pavia for her protection. He then leads the charge. The cavalry retreats and the Germans face the secret weapons of the scythes. The wagons filled with scythe-wielding men cut the cavalry down.  Now with the German cavalry weakened the Lombard cavalry attacks them. In the battle Barozzi kills Lorenzo, Alberto's only remaining brother and attacks Alberto from behind, saying that he will send him to join his "whore in Hell." Alberto rams into Barozzi who drops his sword and falls to the ground, his helmet rolling off as Alberto lands atop him. As Barozzi cries and pathetically begs for his life, Alberto avenges his brothers by slowly driving a stiletto knife into Barozzi's throat, killing him. The Lombards win the battle. Found on the battlefield is a wounded Eleonora in full uniform. She tells Alberto that the Empress saved her life by substituting another woman to be burned in her place and moving the time of her execution so that Barozzi and the Emperor would not find out. Alberto gets his wife back.    The film ends with an onscreen text saying that three days after the Battle of Legnano, Barbarossa reappeared at the court of Pavia.  No one knows where he was or what he did during those three days. Fourteen years later, he left for the Crusades. On a spring evening, in Anatolia, he waded in the waters of the Salef River and, just as foretold, he met his death in the water after being bitten by a snake.    The audience is told "Alberto da Giussano lived a long life with Eleanora, and they had several children.  The Company of Death was dispersed: the towns of the Lombard League had won their freedom."

Ned leaves separately and on his way home he finds his sister's dead body in Cliff's crashed car, and then finds that Cliff has hanged himself.

She also reveals that the car's clock stopped on impact of the crash and no one could figure out what took Kate and Cliff so long to get home from the dance.  Sally speculates that Kate also had sexual relations with Cliff, who then crashed the car in which Kate died.  She tells Ned she believes that Cliff's guilt from his part in Kate's death was multiplied knowing he had committed incest.  But Bruce still believes that Kate was an innocent victim, the best of his children, and she doesn't want him shattered with the truth.

He doesn't tell Bruce the truth about Kate and lets him die still believing that Kate was everything he thought she was.  Before he leaves, he tells Sally that Bruce died never knowing that she was his greatest achievement.

Princess and Rafael wait in his car across the street from her mom's house. As soon as Clarence steps out of the car, Rafael starts shooting Clarence with a USP (Standard), leading to a slow, painful death. When Princess arrives and steals all of Clarence's paper out of the drawer, Shocka realises what's going on and tells Princess he will find her if it's the last thing he does if she hurt his brother, kind of hinting that Shocka may also follow the wrong path to seek revenge for Clarence.

Their tranquil holiday is complicated when he cannot resist becoming involved in the case of a man, [[insurance broker]] Emile Leullet (Jacques Gamblin), who recently attempted to fake his own death in a car crash near [[Sète]] for his mistress (Vahina Giocante) and the insurance money. Leullet, hiding under an assumed name and altered appearance and unsure what to do now, seeks out Bellamy for help. (Bellamy is a celebrity and well known throughout France through his published memoirs, which reveal he has a "soft spot for murderers"). Leullet may or may not have killed the homeless man whose corpse was found burned in his car. The dead man, Denis Leprince (also played by Gamblin), was a son of a local judge, now also dead. Bellamy's alcoholic half-brother Jacques Lebas (Clovis Cornillac) shows up unexpectedly and soon he and Paul are bickering bitterly and Paul is back on the bottle himself, which he had previously given up. Françoise is not thrilled with all the disruptions. In between socializing with their gay dentist friend and his partner and quarreling with Jacques, Paul finds time to informally interview and repeatedly question Leullet, Leullet's wife, Leullet's mistress, Leprince's former lover, and many other local denizens. As things become more complicated, family tensions threaten to overwhelm professional obligations. Paul, a professional tough guy, finds himself pondering the meaning of his own life and relationships. Leullet turns himself in to the clueless local police chief who, apparently, has been sleeping with the mistress. He is acquitted at the trial where he is represented (at Bellamy's suggestion) by Leprince's girlfriend's lawyer who renders the defense (also at Bellamy's suggestion) in the form of a [[Georges Brassens]] song. (Brassens was a local Sète hero and had been something of an obsession for Leprince.) Jacques absconds with Paul's car and is soon reported dead in a car crash, but only after Paul has revealed to Françoise the dark secret underlying his fraught relationship with his half-brother and the source of his lifelong ''tristesse''. The film ends with a [[W.H. Auden]] epigram: "There is always another story/There is more than meets the eye".

However, Waldmann is dismissed by Nazi party officials and replaced as coach by Sigfrid Kulmbach, loyal to the party.

Gretel, therefore, discovers her true identity. Meanwhile, Marie discovers that Gretel was excluded from the race under false pretenses. So Marie decides to deliberately lose the final and decisive leap. The dislodged bar spells the shattering of hope of victory in the German officials, who are dumbstruck.

Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (2009 film)
 [[Shreveport, Louisiana]] TV reporter C. J. Nicholas ([[Jesse Metcalfe]]) is convinced that District Attorney Mark Hunter ([[Michael Douglas]]) is corrupt, following an unbroken string of convictions based only on circumstantial evidence. After flirting with Assistant D.A. Ella Crystal ([[Amber Tamblyn]]) to obtain an evidential videotape that he hopes will be revealing, they begin dating and fall in love.  The videotape suggests to Nicholas that Hunter is using one of his investigators, Lt. Merchant, to obtain DNA evidence from suspects in custody and plant the evidence to support a conviction. Still unable to prove his claim against Hunter, he is demoted from watchdog reporter to general assignment due to budget cuts. Nicholas becomes even more determined to expose Hunter, convinced that he will win a [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]] if successful.   He concocts an elaborate scheme to frame himself for the murder of a prostitute using circumstantial evidence. His passion for the project enlists support from Crystal—who still does not know he is gunning for her boss—and co-worker Corey Finley ([[Joel Moore]]). Finley accompanies him as he obtains objects online and from pawn shops that will circumstantially link Nicholas to the murder. Finley records these instances on video with Nicholas holding a newspaper showing the date to be after the date of the murder. The original video kept in Finley's desk and a back-up copy is placed in a safe deposit box.  Nicholas gets himself arrested for DUI by Lt Nickerson ([[Orlando Jones]]), an acquaintance and police contact of Nicholas, while wearing his falsified circumstantial evidence. He is arrested and charged with the murder. Merchant, however, requests that the case be transferred to him to steal credit for the DA, much to Nickerson's dismay. Upon closer investigations of Nicholas' recent activities, he becomes suspicious and informs Hunter that Nicholas is trying to set them up.  Crystal, who still doesn't know what Nicholas has been plotting, visits him in jail and offers to quit her job and join his defense team, but he convinces her not to do so.  The next step in the plan is to wait until the prosecution rests its case, then introduce the documentary evidence exposing the truth. Hunter instructs Merchant to destroy the video evidence. Finley finds his desk ransacked. Panicked, he tries to retrieve the back-up, but is pursued by Merchant in a high-speed chase in which he is killed.  Nicholas reveals his plot in court using only the dated receipts for his falsified evidence, but Hunter casts doubt on his story. Nicholas has no proof that the victim's blood, which was found on the false evidence, was planted by Hunter's people. The jury convicts Nicholas for the crime.  Crystal still believes in Nicholas and begins her own investigation, unaware that Hunter knew she was dating Nicholas. She is followed by Merchant.  Nicholas is sentenced to death. Hunter visits him in prison to reveal that his phone calls to Crystal, guiding her investigation, have been recorded.  Crystal obtains crime scene photos from Hunter's convictions and takes them to digital photography experts, who determine that the objects containing the suspect's DNA evidence in each case have been digitally added to the original photos after the fact.  When she attempts to take this evidence to the police, Merchant tries to kill her with his car while she flees on foot. She is rescued by Lt. Nickerson, who shoots Merchant dead. Nickerson reveals that he suspected Merchant was up to no good, and he had been "following him following" Crystal.  The doctored photo evidence leads to Hunter's arrest in a public scandal. Nicholas' conviction is declared a mistrial and he becomes a media celebrity. Hunter's convictions are re-examined by the state.  Crystal, however, begins to suspect that the evidence reveals something else, too. After re-watching Nicholas' award-winning documentary about the murder of a prostitute in [[Buffalo, New York]], she recognizes the hands of a woman who supposedly died of a drug overdose during production as the hands of the victim in the murder for which Nicholas was convicted. She correctly deduces that the woman came to Shreveport to blackmail Nicholas, that Nicholas killed her, then used the murder in his scheme against Hunter.  Crystal alerts the police, and tells Nicholas that he is not subject to the [[double jeopardy]] law because he wasn't declared innocent. As the police arrive to arrest him, she tells him, "I just thought of one other thing. Fuck you."

 The movie begins with an underworld don [[Billa (character)|Billa]] ([[Prabhas]]) hiding and operating out of Malaysia hiding from [[Interpol]]'s international criminal list. Krishnamoorthy ([[Krishnam Raju]]), an ACP working for the interpol, has spent the last few years looking for Billa, leaving behind a life in [[India]].  During a chase with the police, Billa is severely wounded after an accident, and dies in front of the [[Assistant Commissioner of Police|ACP]]. The ACP then secretly holds a funeral for Billa. Interpol Officer Dharmendra ([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]) is assigned to work with the ACP to capture the elusive Billa as no-one knows of Billa's death. The ACP keeps the death of Billa as a secret even from his fellow officers, and tracks down a look-alike called Swami Ranga ([[Prabhas]]), a petty thief based in [[Visakhapatnam]]. He asks Ranga to infiltrate Billa's gang by pretending to be Billa. In return he will make sure that the children Ranga adopted, Lakshmi and Sreenu, get a proper education in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].  The ACP trains Ranga and sends him back to Billa's gang as a person who has lost his memory. Slowly Ranga starts to learn about Billa's gang and even speaks to Devil, Billa's boss, on the phone. Ranga provides a pen drive with the secret information of the crime network to the ACP, but he is about to be killed by a woman named Maya ([[Anushka Shetty]]) because her brother Vikram ([[Subbaraju]]) as well as his fiancée Priya ([[Hansika Motwani]]) were killed by Billa. At this juncture, the ACP arrives and tells her that he is Ranga and not Billa. Since then, she begins to assist Ranga and the ACP in their mission and soon falls in love with Ranga. Later before a party, Ranga secretly provides information to the ACP about a meeting of Billa's network and Lisa ([[Namitha]]), Billa's girlfriend, overhears his conversation. She challenges Ranga but in the fight, he accidentally kills her. A shootout occurs at the party and the ACP is secretly killed by Devil, leaving his gun behind. Ranga finds the ACP's body and the gun, but is taken into the custody of the police team, now headed by Interpol Officer Dharmendra. He argues during interrogation that he is Ranga and not Billa to Dharmendra. Ranga mentions a piece of evidence – the pen drive which may prove his innocence but the pen drive is nowhere to be found.  Unable to prove his innocence, he escapes from a police van. He phones Dharmendra and ask him to meet at the Aero bridge. Here it is revealed that Dharmendra is none other than the Underworld Crime Don Devil (Rahman) and he is the one who killed ACP Krishnamoorthy. While escaping from Devil's gang, he meets Officer Adithya ([[Adithya (actor)|Adithya Menon]]), who apparently had the pen drive all along and strikes a deal with Ranga to get hold of Devil. Meanwhile, Maya has been kidnapped by Devil after she tried to defend Ranga from Devil. Maya is tied up and kept in a car with her mouth taped shut. Ranga decides to pose as Billa to Devil, and provides Russian explosives to an arms dealer Rashid ([[Kelly Dorjee]]), who insisted on dealing with Billa. Enraged at being slighted by Rashid, following the completion of the deal, Devil and his henchman Ranjith fight with Ranga. Soon the police arrive and Devil, posing as Dharmendra, asks the police to arrest Ranga as Billa but gets shot by the squad of police and dies as the police have wired the entire conversation between Devil and Ranga, thus proving Ranga's innocence.  The movie ends with Ranga returning to Visakhapatnam with Maya, and deciding to start a school and college there with the government reward given to him and four suitcases of cash he stole from [[Malaysia]].

Bionicle: The Legend Reborn
 Mata Nui ([[Michael Dorn]]), the Great Spirit of the Matoran universe on Aqua Magna, has been exiled from his home by his "brother," the evil Makuta Teridax. Teridax took over his gigantic robot body just after Mata Nui's reawakening and trapped the latter's spirit inside the legendary Kanohi Mask of Life. Teridax then banished the mask into orbit, in order to prevent Mata Nui from interfering with his takeover of the Matoran Universe.  The mask crash lands on a planet called Bara Magna, a remote, decaying wasteland of scrap parts and burnished metals. A Scarabax beetle watches as the Mask of Life creates a body for Mata Nui, who almost steps on the Scarabax. He picks up the Scarabax, who touches his mask. Upon doing so, the beetle changes into a living weapon. Just then, a being called a Vorox attacks Mata Nui and after a struggle, flees without its stinger, which has broken off. Mata Nui picks up the stinger as a vehicle carrying a villager named Metus ([[David Leisure]]) speeds towards him.  The fast-talking Agori recruiter takes Mata Nui to Vulcanus as he tells the once ruler about life on Bara Magna. Local villages scavenge for what remains, building shelters, survival gear and ultimately arenas where they can settle their disputes. Putting the best Glatorian from each village against one another, tribes can quickly end quarrels based on the outcome of the fight. Metus introduces Mata Nui to Raanu ([[Armin Shimerman]]), the Agori leader of Vulcanus, who is too interested in the fight between veteran fighter Strakk ([[Jeff Glen Bennett]]) and Vulcanus' prime Glatorian, Ackar ([[Jim Cummings]]), to talk. Strakk eventually falls in battle, but gets up and illegally fells Ackar after conceding. Mata Nui intervenes and gets beaten down by the angry Strakk. As Mata Nui tries to use the stinger to defend himself, the mask transforms it into a sword. Mata Nui quickly defeats Strakk (and forces him to audibly concede), gaining Ackar as a friend in the process.  Metus later attempts to recruit Mata Nui, who refuses. Ackar introduces the hero to Kiina ([[Marla Sokoloff]]), a feisty Glatorian from the village of Tajun. In exchange for showing the two Glatorians a secret cavern underneath Tajun, Kiina would like to leave Bara Magna with Mata Nui, believing that anywhere is better than her native planet. On their way to Tajun, the three Glatorians are ambushed by a Skopio beast in Sandray Canyon, along with a group of Bone Hunters, who were told the Glatorians' location by an Agori traitor. After trapping both beneath a rockslide, they discover that Tajun had been raided by the combined efforts of the Bone Hunters and the formidable Skrall army (even though both are rival tribes). A Glatorian rookie, Gresh ([[Mark Famiglietti]]), had been trying to defend the village and was badly injured. The heroes follow Kiina to the caverns, where they encounter Berix ([[James Arnold Taylor]]), a thief. While Berix tends to Gresh, the other three discover a hidden chamber containing a picture of the robot that was once Mata Nui's body.  As the Glatorians leave, Gresh complains about his weapon being damaged, then Ackar wonders if what Mata Nui did with Click (the beetle Mata Nui befriended) and the Vorox tail would work with the Glatorian weapons. As his mask seems to work on things that are/were alive and learning from Berix that bone or claw is mostly used to make such weapons, Mata Nui successfully repairs and transforms the weapons. In addition, these weapons grant the Glatorians elemental abilities of fire, water, and air for Ackar, Kiina, and Gresh, respectively. The three practice their newfound powers as they travel to Gresh's village, Tesara, while Ackar teaches Mata Nui to stay alert in battle and to study and find his opponent's weakness. To the protests of Raanu and Metus, the four Glatorians stop a fight between Vastus ([[James Arnold Taylor]]) and Tarix ([[Jeff Glen Bennett]]), telling the crowd of Agori that they must unite their villages against the threat of the Skrall—Bone Hunter alliance. Mata Nui proves his worth to the crowd by transforming Tarix's and Vastus' weapons.  In the hot springs not far from Tesara, Kiina follows a mysterious figure. It turns out to be Berix, and Kiina is now convinced that he is the traitor. However, the actual traitor appears from the shadows to correct Kiina, and he and his Bone Hunters proceed to capture the two Water Villagers. Back in Tesara, Raanu and Metus alert the Glatorian about Kiina and Berix's kidnapping. Mata Nui ignores Ackar's and Gresh's offers for assistance and sets off for the Skrall camp in Roxtus on his own.  Kiina and Berix are held in a suspended cage near the mouth of a cave at Roxtus, both arguing about the former's caverns. Mata Nui confronts Tuma, the Skrall leader and challenges him to a one-on-one fight, and eventually defeats him. As he claims Tuma's shield in victory and demands the freedom of Kiina and Berix, the traitor, now revealed to be Metus, appears. He explains how he got the nomads and the Skrall to unite, and that now they will work for him, since he felt the Agori never gave him any respect, and he states that he will have taken over Bara Magna before the Glatorians realize it. Now in control of the army, he orders the Skrall and Bone Hunters to kill off the three of them. Just then, the Skrall and Bone Hunters end up running for their lives when they are attacked by an immense being composed of Scarabax beetles. Mata Nui uses Tuma's shield to free Kiina and Berix, defeating two Skrall guards in the process. Mata Nui then gives a Skrall shield to Berix who, after landing on a Bone Hunter Rock Steed, unintentionally defeats several Bone Hunters.  As the Glatorians fight off the enemy forces, Mata Nui sees Metus fleeing in his vehicle and follows him. A couple of unchained and vengeful Vorox overturn Metus' chariot, sending him tumbling to the feet of Mata Nui. Mata Nui picks him up and, despite Metus' attempt to bargain with him, presses the traitor to his mask, transforming Metus into a snake, as a representation of [[Cowardice|what he truly is]]. As he slithered away, he claims that his united army cannot be defeated. Realizing this to be the key to winning, Mata Nui has the Glatorians combine their powers against the waves of Skrall and Bone Hunters, knocking them back. As the defeated army flees, the Glatorians rejoice, except for Kiina, who believes Berix to be killed in battle. She quickly finds him alive under a pile of rocks, holding a Skrall shield.  As the Glatorians and Berix watch the combined efforts of the Agori and the Scarabax beetles pulling the villages together, they notice that the combined villages formed a large robotic body, similar to the one Mata Nui's spirit once inhabited. To further this, Berix pulls out a coin with the Unity-Duty-Destiny symbol, the Bara Magna symbol, and the Mask of Life symbol on one side, and the Skrall symbol on the other. Berix shows them the Skrall shield and acknowledges that they are both similar to each other, and Mata Nui realized that the maze-like symbol forms a map. With this information in hand Mata Nui, Ackar, Kiina, Gresh, and Berix prepare to set off for their next adventure.

One day Paul and Sal spot Giants star and Paul's favorite player Quantrell Bishop ([[Jonathan Hamm]]) and his entourage in Staten Island.

Paul's personal-injury lawyer brother Jeff (Gino Cafarelli) and [[NYPD]] Detective Velardi ([[Matt Servitto]]) pressure Paul to bring charges against Bishop, but Paul refuses, worried about the effect on the Giants' performance if they lose their star linebacker. The charges against Bishop are eventually dropped and he returns to the team.  Jeff then files a $77 million civil lawsuit against Bishop as Paul's [[legal guardian]], claiming Paul is mentally incompetent and can't bring the lawsuit himself. When a reporter phones Paul to ask him "about the lawsuit," Paul becomes livid and confronts Jeff as he sits on the toilet.  Both Jeff and Paul's mother start to pressure Paul to get mental help.  Philadelphia Phil researches Paul on the Internet and reveals on Sports Dogg's show that the victim of the Quantrell Bishop beating is in fact "Paul from Staten Island", humiliating him.

When time runs out and the Eagles fanatics celebrate their victory, Paul follows Phil into the men's room and pulls a gun on him, shooting Phil multiple times.  Phil, lying shocked on the men's room floor, stares at his hands, which are now covered in red and blue, the Giants' colors. The gun is then revealed to be a paintball gun. Paul utters "Eagles suck!" and flees from the bar.  Paul is arrested and imprisoned for the assault. Sal visits Paul in jail and reveals to him the Giants' schedule for the following season. A key game coincides with the week Paul is scheduled to be released—Paul is overjoyed and says "It's going to be a great year".

However, instead of thanking him, Trixie kills Fuchs using a hidden [[Shuriken|throwing star]]. Hel awakens, having survived Camero's attack.

In the glove compartment, Dima finds an old photo of three scientists and an old audio record, but he gives them no mind.   Dima is in love with his classmate Nastya Svetlova (Yekaterina Vilkova). Dima believes that the only way to her heart lies through money and status, which in turn are only attainable through ambitiousness and egoism. This belief is strengthened when Dima sees the success of Nastya's friend, Max (Ivan Zhidkov), who also happens to have a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]].  Dima begins working as a flower delivery boy. During one of the runs, he gets into trouble with Kuptsov's men, and while being chased by them, accidentally engages the car's flight system. Losing control of the flying car, Dima crash lands into an abandoned building. With Max's help, Dima is able to play the record from the glove box which helps him track down two of the scientists in the photo, Pavel Perepelkin and Olga Romantseva, who turn out to be husband and wife. Dima, pretending to be a newspaper reporter, asks them about the car. The Volga is revealed to be a product of a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[black project]], equipped with multiple rocket engines allowing supermaneuverable flight, as well as a device called "nano-catalyzer" which transmutes ordinary gasoline into high-yield nanofuel to power them. Romantsova gives Dima the car's manual, which the third scientist, Mikhail Yelizarov, wrote. At first, Dima enjoys the flights and makes decent money delivering flowers while avoiding the infamous [[Moscow]] [[traffic jam]]s. But his egotism leads Dima to leave a stabbed man on the street instead of helping him, and that man later turns out to be his own father.  The death of his father changes Dima's outlook on life. He decides to use his car to help people in need. He rapidly gains many fans among the city dwellers, and newspapers grant him the nickname "Black Lightning."  Meanwhile, Kuptsov starts a hunt for the nano-catalyzer, which can produce fuel needed to power his tectonic drill concealed within one of the Moscow City skyscrapers. The drill will allow Kuptsov to reach a layer of diamonds located beneath the tectonic plate, but will likely destroy the city in the process. Kuptsov finds the scientists who worked on the flying [[GAZ-21|Volga]] and forces them to build the same kind of flight system for his [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], as well as outfit it with weaponry and armor shielding. Kuptsov lures Dima out by letting Perepelkin, one of the scientists, escape to the roof of the skyscraper. Kuptsov then ambushes "Black Lightning" with rocket fire from his Mercedes, stealing the nano-catalyzer and sending the [[GAZ-21|Volga]] falling down, crashing into the ice and sinking to the bottom of the [[Moscow River]].  A call from his girlfriend, Nastya, that says that she really loves him, brings the hero back to his senses. Dima remembers the emergency backup tank with 30 minutes worth of nanofuel, bursts out from under the ice, and rushes into Kuptsov's lair, freeing the scientists and recapturing the nano-catalyzer. He then flies to pick up Nastya, but Kuptsov beats him to her, taking her as a hostage and offering to trade her for the nano-catalyzer. Dima and Kuptsov confront each other over the [[Red Square]]. Dima flashes his headlights and honks the horn in a special signal that Nastya knows about. Nastya jumps out of Kuptsov's car and Dima grabs her in midair, safely landing her to the earth below. The final battle between the flying cars in the sky above Moscow ends with Dima luring Kuptsov's car to the outer reaches of the atmosphere, where the [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] runs out of nanofuel. Kuptsov floats in the Earth's orbit, left for dead.  Dima and Nastya meet on the ground and celebrate the New Year together.

When Wirth reveals he wants to use it for evil, he is interrupted by the family, who trap him in their basement and bind him through a ritual that requires frequent human sacrifices.  Linked to Wirth, the family survive through the decades, operating as both captors and servants to Wirth, who they keep weakened.  In 2007, 25-year-old Evan Marshall is surprised when his older brother Victor suddenly appears after having disappeared during a camping trip in rural West Virginia.  Victor explains that he has escaped his captors, and they quickly prepare to return for vengeance.  The brothers head to the farm and confront the Wollners. They, in turn, warn the siblings about Wirth. They do not listen until Wirth gets out of the cellar and begins his terror. Wirth reveals that the reason Victor was able to escape was because Wirth knew that Victor would come back to the farm for revenge and would eventually free him from the Wollners, so he let Victor go on purpose. The brothers manage to poison and decapitate Wirth, but as a result the Wollners rapidly turn old and die. Before the youngest dies, she tells Evan that SS leader [[Heinrich Himmler]] has sent eight more Nazi agents to different farms. Evan finds a map that was under the farm and discovers that others like Wirth are at other farms. While Victor returns home to his family, Evan heads out to the other farms to stop the Nazis.  
The Blind Side (film)
  The film opens with seventeen-year-old Michael ("Big Mike") Oher talking to an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] investigator. Then a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] ensues.  Michael has been in foster care with different families in Memphis, Tennessee, due to his mother's drug addiction. Every time he is placed in a new home, he runs away. His friend's father, on whose couch Mike had been sleeping, asks Burt Cotton, the coach of Wingate Christian School, to help enroll his son and Mike. Impressed by Mike's size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his poor academic record. Later, Michael is befriended by a younger student named Sean Jr. ("SJ"). SJ's mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy, is a strong-minded interior designer and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy.   The school staff tell Michael that his father has died, apparently due to an accident. Later, Leigh Anne and Sean watch their daughter Collins playing volleyball. After the game, Sean notices Michael picking up leftover food on the bleachers.  One night, Leigh Anne notices Michael walking alone on the moist road, shivering in the cold without adequate clothing. When she learns that he plans to spend the night huddled outside the closed school gym, Leigh Anne offers to let him sleep on the couch in the Tuohy home.   The next morning, Leigh Anne notices that Michael has left. Seeing him walking away, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the family. Later, Leigh Anne drives Michael to his mother's house. He sees an eviction notice posted on the door, and his mother is gone.   Leigh Anne's friends wonder what she is doing; they suggest that Collins might not be safe around Michael, but Leigh Anne rebukes them. She later asks Collins how she feels about it. Collins replies that they cannot just throw Michael out. When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael's legal guardian, she learns he was taken from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that, although he scored poorly in a career aptitude test, he was ranked in the 98th percentile in "protective instincts". When Michael appears to be hesitant to use his strength and size while learning to play football, Leigh Anne tells him, as an offensive lineman, he must protect his quarterback. From that moment, Michael improves drastically, well enough to play at the college level. However, to do that, he must meet the minimum [[Grading (education)|grade point average]] to get in so the Tuohys hire a private tutor for him, the outspoken and kind Miss Sue.  Leigh Anne has a face-to-face conversation with Michael's mother about adopting him. Although she seems unresponsive in the beginning, the mother finally wishes Michael the best.  Michael is heavily recruited by many prestigious schools. SJ talks to coaches and negotiates on Michael's behalf – and his own. When Michael gets his grades high enough, he decides to attend Ole Miss, where Sean had played and Leigh Anne had been a cheerleader. That causes NCAA investigator Granger to look into the matter to determine if the Tuohys took him in and unduly influenced him just so he would play for their [[alma mater]].  Michael runs away before the interview is over and confronts Leigh Anne about her motives for taking him in. He then proceeds to find his biological mother in Hurt Village. A gang leader welcomes him back, offers him a beer, and makes sexually offensive insinuations about Leigh Anne and Collins. When the gang leader threatens to go after them, Michael battles with him and other thugs. After thinking things over and questioning Leigh Anne, Michael tells Granger he chose Ole Miss because "it's where my family goes to school". Michael is accepted into college and says his farewells to the Tuohy family.   The film ends with information about and photos of the real Tuohy family and Michael Oher, who went on to play in the [[National Football League]]. He was drafted by the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in the first round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]].  
A Blood Pledge
 The story begins with the pledge; Eon-Joo, So-Hee, Yoo-jin and Eun-young pledge that they will die together that night. Eon-Joo jumps from the roof of her school, committing suicide. Her sister Jeong-Eon sees her jump. The next day in the school office, So-Hee admits that she was on the roof with Eon-Joo when she jumped.  The three girls become paranoid about the death of Eon-Joo, and secrets about why each girl had a reason to jump start to surface. So-Hee becomes very depressed about the death, unlike the other two. Jeong-Eon confronts So-Hee about her sister's death but So-Hee repeats that she doesn't know what happened. Rumors start to spread around the school. Many girls accuse So-Hee of killing Eon-Joo as their relationship had become strained in the past year. Another girl claims that Eon-Joo killed herself because she was pregnant. That evening, Eun-young is beat by her father for having low grades. The next day, she begs Yoo-jin to let her sleep at her home.  So-Hee has flashbacks of the time when she was friends with Eon-Joo and feels guilty. Joo-yeon tells So-Hee that because she pushed Eon-joo away, she is to blame for her death. Joo-Yeong is later killed by Eon-Joo.   Eun-young sees Eon-Joo's ghost several times, which terrifies her. So-Hee finds a dismembered body, possibly Joo-Yeon's, in a classroom locker. Eun-young tells Yoo-jin that Eon-Joo promised she wouldn't kill any of them if they came clean. Later, Yoo-Jin and So-Hee see Eun-young on the roof. They beg her not to jump but she does, claiming that she is no longer afraid, and that she feels good because she won't have to go back to her abusive home.  So-Hee enters church to apologize for her actions, followed by Yoo-jin. A flashback shows Soo-Hee with her boyfriend, Ki-Ho. Yoo-jin used to date Ki-Ho and made So-Hee and Eun-young stop being friends with Eon-Joo. In the present, Yoo-Jin says that she would kill herself if she didn't make top grades. Eun-young says she tried to kill herself last year because of her father, and So-Hee confesses her pregnancy. Yoo-jin says she doesn't want to lose to So-Hee again, who is better at schoolwork, and she and Eun-young decide to pretend to jump.  Yoo-jin grabs So-Hee and ties a microphone around her neck, stringing her up. Eon-Joo storms in and strangles Yoo-jin. In a flashback, Eon-Joo had told So-Hee that she wanted to die together with So-Hee one day. However, on the day of Eon-Joo’s suicide, So-Hee confessed her pregnancy and swore that she was going to kill herself and take the baby with her. The four girls met on the roof, holding hands. Before the jump, Eun-young and Yoo-jin stepped back. So-Hee realized this and frantically tried to stop Eon-Joo but it's too late: Eon-Joo jumped to her death.  The next scene is of So-Hee crying with Eon-Joo on the roof. Eon-Joo smiles and tells So-Hee that she missed her and wanted to return, but knew she would scare So-Hee. So-Hee hugs her and says she is sorry, begging Eon-Joo to take her with her. However, Jeong-Eon grabs So-Hee's hand, and Eon-Joo tells So-Hee that she must stay to take care of Jeong-Eon: So-Hee is now Jeong-Eon's older sister.  So-Hee decides to keep the baby, while Ki-Ho has moved on with another girl. The two step into an elevator, and as the door is closing, the girl's face turn into Eon-Joo's.  
Blood and Bone
  Fresh out of prison, Isaiah Bone (Michael Jai White) moves to [[Los Angeles]], where underground fights are being held. One night, after watching a match involving local champion Hammerman, Bone makes a deal with promoter Pinball to get him into the fight scene for 20% of his earnings; 40% if Pinball puts his own money on the line. On that same night, Bone encounters mob boss James and his girlfriend Angela Soto. Bone enters his first underground fight and quickly defeats his opponent with only two kicks. Pinball explains to Bone that Angela was previously married, but James set up her husband Danny on a triple-homicide, sending him to jail. When James learned that she was pregnant, he had her undergo an abortion. Since then, Angela has fallen into drug addiction.  Over the next few nights, Bone makes a name for himself in the underground fighting scene, defeating every fighter in his path and earning himself and Pinball thousands in cash. At the same time, he bonds with the people who live at his apartment building: Tamara - the landlady who manages his apartment, Roberto - an elderly Latin-American man whom he plays chess with, and Jared - a young boy Tamara adopted after his father was sent to prison. Then, after making the once-undefeated Hammerman fall to the ground, Bone is offered a deal by James. The international underground fighting scene is run by a league of rich, powerful men known as the "Consortium", but mainly by a black market arms dealer named Franklin McVeigh, and James wants Bone to square off against Pretty Boy Price, the reigning champion.  After telling James he will consider the offer, Bone reveals to Angela that he was cell mates and close friends with Danny. Then one day, Danny was murdered by an inmate named JC. Angela reveals that shortly after Danny went to prison, she gave birth to a son, but lost custody of him and does not know if he is still alive. Bone promises to bring her to her son, but sends her to a drug rehab clinic until she is ready.  The next morning, James offers McVeigh US$5 million to have him get the Consortium approve and schedule a fight between Bone and Price. That night, Bone discovers that Roberto has been murdered in front of the apartment, mauled to death by James' dogs because he witnessed one of James' street killings. Bone declines the offer to fight for James mainly because he never agreed to it; as a result, James orders his thugs to hunt down Bone and Pinball. James' bodyguard Teddy D and his thugs head to the rehab clinic to pick up Angela, only to have Bone and Pinball dispatch them. Transmitting his location through Teddy D's GPS phone, James has the duo follow him to McVeigh's mansion. There, Bone is ordered by James to fight Price and win back his money, or else he will have Angela, Tamara, Jared and Pinball killed. During the conversation, Bone secretly records James' revelation that he had Danny set up and murdered through the GPS phone, which he transmits to Pinball's cell phone; Pinball then sends the video to the police. Bone faces Price, but at the point where he is close to defeating him, he taps the ground and forfeits the fight. An infuriated James grabs his [[katana]] and attacks Bone, but Bone is thrown a [[jian]] by McVeigh's bodyguard to even the odds. Bone drops the sword and uses the sheath instead, beating James with it. In the middle of the melee, Bone redirects a sword slash, causing James to cut off his own hand. He runs off before the police arrive at the mansion to arrest James.  The next day, Angela is reunited with Jared. Tamara, who had threatened to kick Bone out due to his association with James, offers him to stay; he declines, saying he will only cause further trouble. Before exiting the apartment, he leaves her an envelope full of cash and asks her to take Angela in once she is rehabilitated. He also parts ways with Pinball, saying he has business to take care of.  During the end credits, James is attacked and [[Sodomy|sodomized]] in prison by JC and his gang with a [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]].

Upon arriving at a small collection of buildings, they realise that the town is abandoned. It isn't long before a drifter in a cowboy hat comes along. The stranger introduces himself as Joseph, and immediately overshadows Clark with his personality and style. That evening, around a campfire, the three talk: Summer shows Joseph a photo of her older son, Ben, who is Clark's stepson, while Joseph talks about how unlike Clark - who is a slave to society — he is himself, being beholden to no one but God. God is great god is good  The next morning, Joseph suggests that he and Clark walk back to the couple's car and siphon off the gas, then continue on to Joseph's truck and leave the area. Summer wants to accompany them, but Joseph and Clark both say that in her delicate condition, she should remain. Joseph pulls out a revolver and teaches Summer how to use it, touching her in an intimate way. Clark is obviously furious, but he and Joseph still set off together. On the way, Joseph continually mocks Clark for his weaknesses, claiming to know everything about him. Clark is convinced that Joseph is a fanatical, religious hippie. When they arrive, Joseph tells Clark that everything he is about to go through is his own fault, because of his sins, then disappears. Clark opens the trunk of his car to find Ben's rotting body, buzzing with flies. He is horrified, then realises that he has left Summer alone and rushes back.  Meanwhile, Summer has found a room in one of the abandoned buildings with photographs on the wall, including her photo of Ben, with a cross scratched over his face. She turns to find that Joseph is in the room with her. She attempts to shoot him, but the gun he gave her is unloaded. Joseph subdues her and uses a razor to carve a cross into her forehead, saying that she will have the mark forever and will remember what happened there. She begs to know why he is doing this and he claims that it is God's will. At that moment, Clark arrives and attacks Joseph, beating him to the ground.  When Joseph regains consciousness, he is tied to a chair. Clark demands to know how they can escape the town, but Joseph won't say. Clark takes a pair of pliers and cuts off one of Joseph's fingers in order to make him talk. Finally Joseph admits that he is an avenging angel, sent to punish the wicked for their sins. He suggests that Clark tell Summer what was in the trunk of their car but Clark says it was nothing. Joseph then agrees to help them as long as he can first show them something down by the river. Just past the water tower, there is a field of rough, wooden crosses, marking graves. Summer asks if Joseph killed all those people but he claims that he never killed anyone; all did it to themselves and every one of them deserved it.  Further into the makeshift graveyard, there are three empty graves. Joseph again exhorts Clark to tell Summer what his sin is. When Clark refuses, Joseph loads the gun and hands it to Summer, reiterating that she need only cock it and squeeze the trigger. Receiving no response to Joseph's repeated question, Summer assumes it has something to do with Ben and finally shoots Clark. When she asks what she has done to deserve this pain, Joseph tells her that her sin is apathy: she knew something was wrong but did nothing about it.  Joseph raises his hand to the sky and murmurs a prayer, and his finger reappears. His face is no longer wounded and bloody. Leaving Summer at the graveyard with the gun, he walks off. Summer attempts to shoot herself, but there had been only one bullet in the chamber.

Sam is a bike rider, and meets '''Nikita "Nikki" Malhotra''' ([[Katrina Kaif]]), a female biker who works for an underworld gangster named '''Gulshan Samnani''' ([[Rahul Dev]]). Sam is challenged by Gulshan to a bike race, and after Sam wins, he asks Nikki out for dinner. Before leaving, Gulshan asks Sam to work for him, but Sam refuses unless there's a large sum of money involved.  During Sam's date with Nikki, Nikki explains to Sam that the job Gulshan proposed would pay with $50,000. Gulshan hires Sam to work for him, but Sam is set up by Gulshan in failing to deliver a package costing Gulshan $50 million. Sam must either pay his money back or die. Sam does not have the money so he explains to Nikki, whom he now loves, that he is going on holiday to the Bahamas to visit his brother Sagar and doesn't think Gulshan will find him there. Sam arrives at Aarav's company and Sagar welcomes him happily. In the Bahamas, one ill-fated day, when sitting in a restaurant, Sam receives a call from Gulshan on Nikki's phone, explaining that he has killed Nikki, and knows where Sam is.

Aarav enters and brings everyone to a halt by shooting the bike wheels, saving Sam's life.  For now, Sam tells Aarav what he did wrong, and Aarav decides he needs to tell Sagar about the situation. When Sagar learns how much trouble Sam is in, Sam tries to convince Sagar to retrieve a famous treasure from Lady in Blue. Sagar refuses. The next day, Gulshan bombs Sagar's home, and kidnaps Mona, with a ransom of $50 million or Sam for her return. When Sagar tells Sam and Aarav, Sam decides that they need to go and rescue Mona as they already killed Nikki and will kill Mona too. But Aarav speaks up and says they don't know how far Gulshan is connected and they may all die, meaning the only option is to find the treasure, pay off Gulshan and use the rest of the money to live comfortably. Sagar is still hesitant and it is revealed that Sagar has a haunted and shocking past with Lady in Blue. Years ago, Sagar had to abandon his archaeologist father, '''Aadesh Singh''', at the ship, to save his own life. However, after Aarav convinces Sagar that the treasure will save the lives of both Mona and Sam, Sagar finally agrees.  The three of them bring the treasure up and find Gulshan sitting on the top of his ship that he and his gang have steered up next to the ship belonging to Sam, Sagar, and Aarav. He tells Sam and Sagar that Aarav hired Gulshan to do all of this. Soon there is a fight between Sagar and Aarav, and Aarav jumps into the ocean after killing Gulshan. Mona, Sam, and Sagar are forced to leave him there, and Sagar agrees never to come back to the Lady in Blue, after losing two people who were close to him there - his father Aadesh and his friend Aarav.  Three months later Sagar gets a call from Aarav. Talking to them, Aarav reveals that he survived his leap into the ocean, and reveals to them that his grandfather was Captain Jagat Malhotra, the traitorous captain of the ship, Lady in Blue, who committed suicide after he was court-martialed. Aarav never admitted to Sagar who his grandfather was, because he didn't want to dishonor his family. Aarav explains that finding the treasure of the Lady in Blue would help bring honor back to his family name, and he befriended Sagar, knowing he was the only one who could take him to the treasure. Throughout the phone call, a woman's arm is seen around Aarav, and later, the woman asks to speak to Sam. It is revealed that the woman is Nikki, and she is Aarav's wife. She asks Sam to forgive her for deceiving him, but it isn't revealed if Sam said yes or no. However, while Sam answers there is a smile on Nikki's face. The film ends with Aarav and Nikki cuddling on one of Aarav's boats, and the end credits begin.

Gavin's popularity creates a rivalry between himself and The Count, who was initially brought to Radio Rock as Gavin's replacement.  On his eighteenth birthday Carl is introduced to Quentin's niece Marianne and falls instantly in love with her, but is heartbroken when she is seduced by Doctor Dave. Carl's roommate "Thick" Kevin observes that the sex, drug, and alcohol-filled atmosphere of Radio Rock is clearly no place for Carl to get on the straight-and-narrow. He theorises that the real reason Carl's mother sent him there is that his father—whom Carl has never met—is someone on the ship, with Quentin being the likeliest suspect.  DJ "Simple" Simon Swafford marries Elenore in an onboard ceremony, but soon learns that she only married him as a means to live on the ship and be with Gavin, with whom she is infatuated but refuses to marry her (or anyone). The Count challenges Gavin to a [[chicken (game)|game of chicken]] in defence of Simon's honour: The two climb one of the ship's [[radio masts and towers|radio masts]] in a clash of egos, reconciling after they are both injured by jumping into the ocean below.  Soon afterwards, Carl's mother Charlotte visits for Christmas, she denies his suspicion that Quentin is his father. As she departs, Carl passes on a cryptic message from reclusive late-night DJ "Smooth" Bob Silver, leading to the unexpected revelation that Bob is actually his father.  When Marianne returns to the ship and apologises to Carl for sleeping with Doctor Dave. She and Carl have sex that night. The following morning, The Count and the rest of the DJ's announce the news of the event to millions of cheering fans all over Britain.   Meanwhile, Dormandy's mission to ban pirate radio advances when Twatt comes across news of a fishing boat whose distress call was blocked by Radio Rock's powerful signal. Twatt proposes the creation of the [[Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967|Marine Offences Act]], which will make pirate radio stations illegal on the grounds that they endanger other vessels. Despite public opinion being heavily in support of the pirate stations, the Act passes unanimously through [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and takes effect at midnight on 1 January 1967. The Radio Rock crew choose to defy the law and continue to broadcast, firing up the ship's engine so that they may avoid arrest by relocating. The aging vessel cannot take the strain, causing the engine to explode and the ship to start sinking. The DJs broadcast their position in hope of aid, and Twatt appeals to Dormandy to send rescue boats, but Dormandy refuses. Carl rescues the oblivious Bob from his cabin, while The Count vows to continue broadcasting as long as possible.  With the lifeboats inoperable, all gather on the [[prow]] as the ship begins to go down. They are rescued by dozens of fans, who heard about their broadcast predicament, and have motored out in a fleet of small boats to save them; Carl himself is rescued by Marianne, Simon is rescued by a female fan who genuinely loves him, Dave being rescued by a throng of female fans, and Elenore rescuing Gavin. The Radio Rock ship disappears beneath the sea, with The Count emerging from the sinking vessel at the last moment. Though pirate radio in Britain comes to an end, the music lives on, with rock and pop becoming increasingly popular in subsequent decades, broadcast over hundreds of 'legal' stations around the world.

That night, she is overcome with curiosity and opens the room to find all of Bluebeard's past wives murdered and hanging. While in the room she drops the key, staining it with blood from the floor. Bluebeard returns unexpectedly the next day and discovers the blood upon the key and accuses her of entering the room. He tells her she must die, however she begs for time in the tower to make her peace with God.

Throughout the film, the scenes switch back and forth between the two girls reading the story, and the two sisters living it. The film closes with the older girl, Marie-Anne falling to her death as her little sister Catherine finishes the story despite Marie-Anne begging her not to, as it scares her. As Catherine cries, their mother enters (the same actress who plays the mother to the two sisters in the story) and the scene switches back to Marie-Catherine with her hands on Bluebeard's head on a platter.

Inside is a wooden box, with a large red button locked under a transparent dome top. An accompanying note reads: "Mr. Steward will call upon you at 5:00 pm." Mr. Steward, a mysterious man with the left side of his face burned off, arrives to deliver the key for the box. He tells Norma that, if the button is pushed, he will give her a tax-free payment of $1 million in cash. However, someone she does not know will die. $100 is given to Norma by Mr Steward as penance for allowing him to enter the house and voice his deal.  Norma and Arthur have ethical and moral arguments about pushing the button, wondering whether the death will be a young and innocent person, or a person on death row. Their son, Walter, is attending private school where Norma teaches, and she had just been informed that the school would no longer offer her a discount for his education, making the million dollars all the more enticing. While discussing it, Arthur and Norma open the box, and discover that the box is 'just a bunch of wood'. The couple discuss it further, with Arthur chastising Norma for being scared about the deal. No resolution is made and the two go to sleep. The next day, they discuss it further before they attend work. After work, Arthur reveals that the $100 dollar bill given to them is real. After further discussion, Norma impulsively pushes the button, whispering 'It's just a box'. It is revealed that someone is shot, and that the gunman ran from the scene carrying a briefcase. Mr. Steward arrives at the house and presents them with the $1 million dollars. Mr. Steward tells them that someone did indeed die as a result of their actions, and assures them that the offer will be presented to someone whom they do not know. Before Mr. Steward can leave, Arthur attempts to return the money to him, he declines and states that while he is sorry, he can do nothing because "the button has been pressed". The police treat the murder as a domestic homicide, and it is discovered that the husband whose wife was shot, was a colleague of Arthur's working at NASA. The police are confused because the astronaut was known as a loving husband, whom they would not initially suspect. NSA chief Martin Teague and Norm Cahill, Arthur's boss from NASA, discuss Cahill's missing NASA colleague, Arlington Steward. The chief tells Cahill that Steward became "something else" after being killed by lightning shortly after NASA received the first photograph transmitted by the [[Viking 1]] Mars lander in July 1976.  Life for Arthur and Norma becomes far worse. The two are constantly plagued by odd and seemingly supernatural happenings, a result of pressing the button. It is revealed throughout the film that Arlington has been conducting business with a group of benefactors using the box to decide if the human race is worth preserving. The couple are alarmingly visited by people who have also fallen victim to the box, pressing the button themselves and falling into the same fate as the Lewis family.   After a number of paranormal incursions, Arlington ultimately returns to the Lewis home and informs them that their son Walter, who had been kidnapped by unknown assailants earlier, is locked in the family's bathroom upstairs. However, he has been stricken completely and irreversibly blind and deaf. Arlington laments that he had hoped for the family to be better than succumbing to the temptation of the money and left the box alone, but that it had to come to this for the choice that they made. Arlington makes the couple a final ultimatum: Keep the money and live out their lives with their disabled son, or have Arthur kill Norma, restoring Walter's sight and hearing, with the million dollars being placed in a high-interest banking account available to him when he is 18. Arthur contemplates killing Arlington himself, with the latter stating that Arthur will be charged with his murder, his son's condition will remain, and the family will be left with nothing. Arlington departs the home, with Arthur coming to the realization that their choice to push the button has placed the family into purgatory. Norma decides to take Arlington up on his offer, wanting her son to live his life without disability, and asks Arthur to kill her. After a long goodbye, Arthur kills Norma.   The scene cuts back and forth between Arthur, Norma, and another couple offered the same box. They also decide to press the button, resulting in Norma's death. It is implied that this will go on and on among other couples in the future.  
Book of Blood

Wyburd convinces Simon to join him in his truck, where Simon passes out and awakens strapped to a table. Wyburd offers him a choice: a slow death, or a quick and clean death by telling the story of the Book of Blood, a series of scars and inscriptions carved on Simon from head to toe. Opting for a clean death, Simon reveals his story.  A young girl is violently raped and beaten in her bed while her parents stand outside screaming her name. An unseen force rips her face off, killing her. Several months later, paranormal professor Mary Florescu ([[Sophie Ward]]) and her partner Reg Fuller ([[Paul Blair (actor)|Paul Blair]]) investigate the house to unlock its mysteriously murderous past. Mary encounters Simon McNeal, a seemingly [[clairvoyant]] young man to whom she develops an attraction. Simon reluctantly signs on to assist, and the three of them move in. Reg spots a terrifying ghost and dies from a fall. Mary sees Simon is attacked twice by [[ghost]]s; the second time, the ghosts carve into Simon's flesh with nails and glass shards, and Mary understands: she is the key to opening the way for the ghosts; her powers were what awakened them. She swears to the ghosts that she will tell all of their stories. The ghosts heed her words and depart, allowing Simon to survive the ordeal.  Simon reveals to Wyburd that he was from then on cursed to be the book on which the dead write while Mary wrote books and made millions off of the stories portrayed on him. As she aged, he remained the same youthful appearance, only more scarred with new stories for her to write. He admitted he couldn't take it anymore, so he fled, hence the reason Wyburd was hired to remove his skin. Wyburd, unmoved, lives up to his end of the bargain and kills Simon quickly. After placing his skin neatly into a suitcase, he waits for his payment. Blood suddenly starts pouring from the case, slowly filling the building that Wyburd is trapped in, and he drowns. Mary arrives, and is unfazed by Wyburd's body. She opens the suitcase, pulling out Simon's intact skin and smiling, as she begins to read the stories still being written upon the flesh.  
The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day

Eight years later, their uncle Father Sibeal arrives to inform them that a renowned Boston priest was murdered by a mysterious assassin who attempted to frame the Saints by using their ritual assassination style. In response, the brothers dig up their old gear and weapons and depart for the United States.  En route to Boston aboard a container ship, the brothers meet a Mexican underground fighter named Romeo, who recognizes them as the Saints. Romeo convinces them to let him join them as their new partner. Hearing a radio broadcast regarding Joe's son, Concezio Yakavetta, they deduce that he must have hired the hit-man who killed the priest in order to draw them out of hiding.  Meanwhile, Detectives Greenly, Dolly and Duffy are at the scene of the priest's murder. They are greeted by Special Agent Eunice Bloom, the protégée of Paul Smecker (who has died) who has been assigned to investigate the murder and determine whether or not the Saints are responsible. She comes to the conclusion that it was not the Saints who murdered the cleric and begins an investigation to find the real assassin. She and the other officers find out the assassin is Ottilio Panza, a man who appears to be working for a mysterious man known only as "The Old Man".  Connor, Murphy and Romeo hit a warehouse that is being used by an Asian gang to process heroin for Yakavetta. After killing everyone at the warehouse, Connor and Murphy reunite with their old bartender friend, Doc. They learn that the assassin was an independent contractor and that Yakavetta himself is hiding in the [[Prudential Tower]]. Later at the warehouse, now a crime scene, Bloom confirms that the Saints have returned. Bloom interrupts a massage in progress and hits a mob boss with a paddle, displaying her identity.  The brothers and Romeo have one of Yakavetta's underbosses named Gorgeous George set up a meeting with a group of mobsters at a bar, where they kill them. Panza arrives shortly after and attempts to ambush the brothers, but Bloom arrives in time to save them by wounding Panza who flees. Bloom introduces herself, revealing her intentions to help the Saints in Smecker's place. The group then cleans up the crime scene to make it look as if the mobsters had turned on each other. Later, Bloom reunites the other detectives with the Saints, thus bringing them in on their plans.  Yakavetta calls a meeting with his crew, during which the Saints arrive and kill everyone including Yakavetta. Bloom interrogates Yakavetta's Consigliere Jimmy and learns of the Old Man's involvement with Panza. The crime scene is visited by FBI Special Agent Kuntsler, who takes over the gang murder case upon suspending Bloom. Later at the bar, Greenly arrives to celebrate the boys' victory, but is shot and killed by Panza. Noah, earlier having decided to help his sons, unexpectedly arrives to demand Panza tell him the Old Man's location. They engage in a type of "Russian Roulette" stand-off and after Panza still refuses to answer, Noah kills him.  Noah reveals to the group that in 1958 New York, he watched a trio of mobsters brutally murder his father in front of his eyes. Consumed with anger and wanting revenge, Noah killed the mobsters with the help of his best friend Louie, who is revealed to be the Old Man. Noah still felt unsatisfied, so Louie helped him pick out mobsters to kill. They continued this until 1975, when Louie gave Noah up to the police.  Bloom illegally obtains a file regarding Louie's location and gives it to Noah. Louie, anticipating the Saints arrival at his mansion, has several hit-men stationed on the grounds. When the McManus family arrives, Louie reveals that he had only used Noah to eliminate the competition in the Mafia, afterwards giving him up to the police when he was no longer useful. After this however, the Mafia cast Louie himself out for the very same reason. He then helped rebuild the Yakavetta family after Joe's demise and let the Saints take out the rest of the organization so Louie could take control. Louie signals the hit-men waiting to take out the Saints to make their move, but the Saints kill them all. Noah suffers a fatal gunshot wound, but kills Louie before he dies. The Police arrive and arrest the wounded Connor, Murphy and Romeo.  Bloom meets with Father Sibeal who has arranged to take her to a safe place out of the country to flee FBI prosecution. She is shocked to discover that Sibeal has been working with Smecker who faked his own death and developed a network of support for the Saints and their work. Smecker tells Bloom his plans to break the Saints out of prison.  As protesters outside of the prison shout for the freedom of the Saints, Connor and Murphy stare out of their window at the sea of prisoners in the yard, finding that they'll have plenty of work while they wait to be freed.

She is to be the evil Countess of Stones and live in a stone tower. If the greatest gem-cutter in the world brings the stone of Alatyr to life, though, she'll become the ruler of the world.   The Stone Countess, now cruel and selfish, is fascinated with the idea. She starts searching for the best gem-cutters and forces them to work with Alatyr, so the magical stone would become a living thing. Neither of the gem-cutters succeeds, so she kills them.

Ivan tells Katia of his dream to become a professional gem-cutter and avenge his father's death. So Katia gives him the Book of Masters to study but warns him about her mother's evil power.  Ivan studies the Book for a year. He has fallen for Katia and misses her terribly. But the fat landlady Clava wants to marry him, being sure that he's her rescuer. Moreover, the Stone Countess orders Katia to marry Iangul (who genuinely loves the girl). As for Ivan's ugly fiancee, she also has an admirer - Ivan's friend Cusma, a [[blacksmith]].  Finally, Ivan finishes studying the Book and goes to the stone tower. The Countess promises him Katia's hand in exchange for bringing Alatyr to life. Ivan believes her and soon carves the stone into a perfect shape of a [[rose|red rose]], and it becomes alive.  But the Countess has tricked him. He sees Katia in a dream, and she tells him they'll never be together. Furious, Ivan runs to the forest where Baba Yaga lives to ask her for help. The Ardars are sent to kill him, but Cusma distracts them and they kill him instead.  Searching for Baba Yaga's house, Ivan meets a helpful talking [[horse]], frees a captured [[mermaid]] and helps a bored [[bogatyr]]. Finally he finds Baba Yaga, who tells him about magical [[diamond]]s able to cancel Alatyr's black powers. Also she gives him a bottle with the water of life, and Ivan revives Cusma.  Then Baba Yaga's magic transport him to [[Koschei the Deathless]], who is the owner of the magical diamonds. First Koschei refuses to give them to Ivan, but he is convinced to do this by his fiancee, the mermaid rescued by Ivan. So Ivan takes the diamonds and hurries to the tower, where Katia's soul is being given to Alatyr in order to make the stone fully alive.  Ivan saves Katia and steals Alatyr just in time, and they rush to the passageway to the non-magical world. They are stopped by Iangul, who still hopes that Katia will be his wife. Katia's sure Iangul is going to kill Ivan, so she offers herself in exchange for Ivan's life. Realizing that Katia doesn't love him, Iangul lets both of them run away. The Stone Countess turns him into a stone when she finds out.  But when the Countess catches Ivan and orders him to give her Alatyr back, Ivan is no longer afraid of her. He adorns Alatyr with the magical diamonds, and they break the spell that kept the Countess evil. So she's kind and sweet again and happily allows Katia to marry Ivan. The landlady Clava turns sad, because she wants to marry someone too. Her father says that he'll give her to anyone, and Cusma at last declares his love for Clava.  The two couples are wedded and live happily ever after.

As their fortunes grow and the affluent lifestyle affects Brian, he eventually gets addicted to the drug, even though Nate had warned them all not to "partake in the product".  One night Chris takes Sienna to meet with an old client who likes Sienna. Both smoke [[crack cocaine|crack]], and the 'john' kills her. The police arrive and arrest him and Chris, who is outside the room, unaware of the murder. He is charged with several crimes that include prostitution, drug-dealing, possession etc., and could face many years in state prison. Brian visits Chris in jail, who tells Brian the cops will likely reduce his sentence to two years minimum, if he tells them where he got the drugs from. Brian tries to convince  Chris that if he does this, Nate will hunt him down, but Chris doesn't care.  Brian returns to the other two to talk with them, but the others tell him that they are not going to be involved in the business anymore with Chris in jail and Sienna dead, so they quit, after Kevin also discloses to Brian that he loves Jasper. Brian then tells Nate about what happened, and Nate contracts to kill Chris in jail, but the old convict he hires, who sticks a [[shiv (weapon)|shiv]] into Chris several times, does not kill him.  Chris tells the police of Brian's drug & pimping business.  Darick is killed by Nate and Brian tries to kill Kevin unsuccessfully.

Brian walks back outside, with guns in both hands. Cops order him to drop the weapons or they will shoot. Brian  contemplates the situation and surrenders, and as he lays down the pistols, Nate, from a distance and armed with a sniper rifle, shoots and kills him so he can't tell the cops who supplied him the drugs. The police, amazed, don't see who kills him, thinking the shot was from one of their own snipers, and presumably Nate gets away (but likely just temporarily, as Nate thinks Chris is dead).  At Darick and Brian's funeral, Brian's mother is shown in the cemetery with Eddie and Chris, who is still incarcerated and using a wheelchair. Finally, in Eddie's thoughts, he discloses Kevin and Jasper are somewhere away from the US., and that the 'organization' made over $ 7 million in about a year of operation, but that it was 'all gone'. In closing, he emotes he didn't want to be involved from the beginning because, though his friends 'flew high for a while, in the end they flew off the bridge to nowhere'.

She begins to pursue him after her siblings Samuel and Toots obtain his book of poetry "[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]". Her efforts to interact with the poet are fruitless until he witnesses her grief for the loss of his brother Tom. Keats begins to open up to her advances while spending Christmas with the Brawne family. He begins giving her poetry lessons, and it becomes apparent that their attraction is mutual. Fanny is nevertheless troubled by his reluctance to pursue her, for which her mother ([[Kerry Fox]]) surmises, "Mr. Keats knows he cannot like you, he has no living and no income."  It is only after Fanny receives a valentine from Brown that Keats passionately confronts them and asks if they are lovers. Brown sent the valentine in jest, but he warns Keats that Fanny is a mere flirt playing a game.

Eddie takes a liking to his second rookie assignment, who then accidentally fires his gun near a teenager during a petty theft investigation, causing him to go deaf, leaving the NYPD facing a public relations nightmare. During the investigation, Eddie is remorseful for what happened, but refuses to play along with his superiors' attempts to imply that the teenager was a drug dealer.  When Tango goes to warn Caz to abort their upcoming drug deal, they are ambushed and Caz is shot, under orders from Red, a gangster Tango had humiliated previously. After Agent Smith makes a racist remark and refuses to pursue Red, Tango lunges at her, but is restrained by fellow officers.  Sal's latest raid on the complex is cancelled, but he decides to go to the location and rob the money he needs for his house. One of his team members, Detective Ronny Rosario, tries to stop him, but fails. As he approaches the building, Sal passes Tango, who has come there to kill Red. Sal raids the apartment. After killing three drug dealers and discovering their stockpile of cash, Sal is shot and killed by a young man who became suspicious when he noticed Sal enter the building. Tango gets his vengeance on Red, but is mistaken for a gangster and is shot by Rosario. Only after shooting Tango does Rosario realize he has shot another police officer. Rosario, still determined to stop Sal, leaves the wounded undercover detective to continue his search for him. He witnesses the young man who shot Sal running away from the crime scene and is devastated when he finds Sal's body in the drug dealers' apartment.

He follows the van to the Van Dyke housing projects, where he locates a sex slave dungeon in the basement. Eddie apprehends one of the men and is confronted by a second one. Eddie tells the second man to get down, but is forced to shoot him in the chest, resulting in a violent fight that ends with Eddie strangling his opponent with a [[cable tie|zip tie]]. Eddie finds redemption by rescuing the missing girls.  
Broken Embraces
 "Harry Caine" is a blind writer who shares his life with his agent Judit and her adult son, Diego. Slowly, events in the present begin to bring back memories of the past. Harry hears that millionaire Ernesto Martel has died; a young filmmaker, Ray X, appears and turns out to be Martel's son, Ernesto, Jr. After Diego is hospitalized for an accidental drug overdose in a Madrid nightclub, Harry collects Diego from the hospital and looks after him to avoid worrying his traveling mother. The main storyline is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] as Harry reluctantly tells Diego a tragic tale of fate, jealousy, abuse of power, betrayal, and guilt.  The first flashback is to 1992, which introduces Magdalena "Lena" Rivero, Martel's beautiful young secretary, an aspiring actress. She becomes close to Martel, a millionaire financier, in order to find the money to help meet her dying father's medical bills. By 1994, she has become Martel's mistress. At this time, Harry is still living under his real name, Mateo Blanco, a well-respected film director. Martel is excessively possessive of Lena, but she is determined to become an actress and manages to win the main role in Blanco's film ''Chicas y maletas'' (''Girls and Suitcases'') by bringing Martel in as financier/producer. (The fictional film is similar to Almodóvar's 1988 release, ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'', except that the Shiite terrorists have been replaced by a cocaine dealer; several of the cast of the previous film appear in the fictional one.) Martel spies on Lena and Mateo by sending his inhibited, effeminate gay son, Ernesto, Jr., to videotape the production of the film, ostensibly for a "[[making of]]" feature, then hiring a [[Lip reading|lip-reader]] to interpret the conversations. Martel, seething with jealousy, screens the videos as the lip-reader narrates the furtive whispers of Lena and Mateo's passionate affair.  Furious, Martel confronts Lena, and when she threatens to leave him he pushes her down the stairs. But when she survives the fall, he relents and nurses her back to health. The filming completed, Lena and Blanco escape Martel's hold and go on holiday to [[Lanzarote]]. Lena takes a job as a hotel receptionist to pass the time. When she and Blanco read in ''[[El País]]'' that ''Chicas y maletas'' has received a terrible critical reception, likely the end of Blanco's directing career, they determine to start over together far from Madrid. Fate intervenes when Blanco is seriously injured and Lena is killed in a car accident, which is immortalized by Ernesto Jr., who has been trailing them with his camcorder. Mateo loses his sight permanently. Judit, his long-time production assistant, and an 8-year-old Diego arrive to help Blanco pick up the pieces and return to Madrid, where he eventually writes screenplays in braille under the pseudonym Harry Caine, represented by his agent, Judit.  The story picks up where it began in 2008: Harry shares his birthday in a bar with Judit and Diego. Judit becomes drunk on gin and, stricken with guilt, confesses to Harry that she sold out to Martel in 1994 because of her fury at Harry for abandoning the film to run away with Lena; she also tells him of her involvement in providing Martel the phone number of the hotel in Lanzarote where Lena and Mateo were hiding. She confirms that Martel sabotaged the release of ''Chicas y maletas'' by using the worst take from each scene in order to destroy Mateo's reputation. The next morning she reveals to Diego that Harry is actually his father, a fact both men were unaware of. Having exorcised some of his demons, Harry decides to return to his life as Mateo Blanco. Though believed lost, the original reels of ''Chicas y maletas'' and Ernesto Jr.'s camcorder footage are recovered: Judit had ignored Martel's order to destroy them and instead hid them away. Mateo and Diego re-edit the film for its long-delayed release as the director envisioned it.

There, Lina is confronted by Gloria and Trey, so she stays at Malibu and becomes Captain of The Sea Lions again. The next day at school, half of the Sea Lions squad quits because of Lina's routines and practices. Avery and Kayla approach Lina, Christina, and Sky to tell them that they are dreaming if they think they have a chance at winning the Spirit Championship. Sky loses her temper and tells them to back off, otherwise a fight would start.  Lina then goes on a field trip to East L.A with the remaining Sea Lions, where Gloria has persuaded a gym to sponsor the Sea Lions and some of the members of The East L.A. Rough Riders as an All Star squad. By combining the Sea Lions and the Rough Riders, they become The Dream Team. The next day after practice, while Lina is at her locker talking with Sky and Christina, Evan kisses her and tells her exactly how he feels in front of a crowd in the hallway that is recording the entire scene. They get back together, and Lina and her team make it to the final round of the All Star Championship and end up defeating The Jaguars, after which Avery breaks down. Evan comforts her but motions a "call me" signal to Lina over Avery's shoulder. The film ends with Lina taking a picture with Trey, Gloria and Sky, claiming all of them as her cheer sisters.

Each of his days are structured around carefully planned routines, but one day his routine is disrupted when he discovers an infestation of mice in the kitchen cupboards. He contemplates leaving the flat to buy mouse traps, but can not bring himself to open the door, so he reminisces about the events leading up to his current situation, with objects around the flat triggering flash backs.  One year earlier, after being "[[friend zone]]d" by the woman he loved, Stephen went on a sightseeing holiday across Europe with his friend Bunny, who is addicted to gambling. They visit several bizarre museums, but Bunny finds them all boring and is more concerned with seducing women. At a seafood restaurant in Poland, Stephen and Bunny meet Eloisa, a Spanish waitress who has recently left her boyfriend and plans to return to Spain for an upcoming fiesta. Bunny wins the restaurant's delivery car in a bet, and Eloisa accompanies them on their journey towards Spain. They stop at a hostel in Switzerland, where Stephen plans to ask Eloisa on a date, only to discover that she has already started a sexual relationship with Bunny.  When they arrive in Spain, Eloisa is reunited with her brother Javier, an aspiring [[matador]].

Javier shows him a prized matador suit he keeps in a display cabinet, which Bunny later steals and subsequently loses in a bet. Elsewhere, Eloisa falls in love with Stephen and they sleep together, but the next morning Bunny explains about the lost matador suit and urges Stephen to come with him as he flees Spain. Eloisa finds out about the suit and breaks up with Stephen. On the train ride home, Stephen angrily confronts Bunny about his recklessness, but he misinterprets Stephen's frustrations as a challenge, so that night Bunny sneaks into a field and attempts to fight a bull. The bull kills him, and Stephen is left traumatised. When he returns home, Stephen's guilt develops into agoraphobia, and he has remained in his flat ever since.  In the present day, Stephen imagines a conversation with the ghost of Bunny, who asserts that his death was not Stephen's fault and urges him to talk to Eloisa.

John ([[Noah Segan]]), a senior at the high school, is deciding whether to go to [[prom]] with his long-time crush Cassie (Alexi Wasser) or stay home. His friend Alex (Rusty Kelley) is against going until he hooks up with a girl named Liz (Regan Deal). She says if she can get off work that night, she will meet him there.  John asks Cassie to go to prom but she refuses. Meanwhile, Winston is at a [[restaurant]] where a worker from the bottled-water company dies from the infection. He then realizes the creek got heavily contaminated and goes to the water plant to tell the officials that the water is contaminated. The worker he informs is quickly killed by a group of CCD (Contamination Control Division) soldiers in [[NBC suit]]s. Winston leaves before they can get to him.  At the high school the infection begins to spread slowly. Frederica ([[Amanda Jelks]]) dies in the [[swimming pool]] from the infection and Rick (Thomas Blake, Jr.) is killed when he drowns after hitting his head on the side of the pool and falling in.

Cassie's boyfriend Marc then comes out of nowhere, hits Cassie with a [[hammer]], and tries to kill John but Cassie recovers and kills him with a nail gun. The two leave the school only to be ambushed by the CCD. John stalls them, allowing Cassie to escape. She finds herself on the highway and stops Herman's van. Winston and Herman take Cassie with them. The camera shows her back where she is starting to show signs of infection.  Meanwhile, Alex's date Liz is at her workplace. She is a [[stripper]] at Teazers and she spreads the infection to the customers, who in turn spread it further around the country and even to Mexico.  
The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations
 Sam Reide ([[Chris Carmack]]) witnesses a woman being killed, then wakes up in an ice-filled bathtub, his vitals being monitored by his sister Jenna ([[Rachel Miner]]). Sam can travel back to any time and location during his lifetime (occupying the body of that time in his life), needing only to concentrate on where and when he wishes to arrive. He has helped the local police capture criminals under the guise of being a psychic. Sam pays his sister Jenna's rent and buys her groceries, as she rarely leaves the apartment and lives in squalor.  Later that night, Elizabeth (Sarah Habel), the sister of Sam's murdered girlfriend Rebecca (Mia Serafino), arrives at Sam's apartment. She believes that the man about to be executed for her sister's murder, Lonnie Flennons (Richard Wilkinson), is innocent, and she offers to pay Sam to find the real murderer. Sam turns her down, but goes to speak with the man who tutored him on time travel, Goldburg (Kevin Yon), who reminds him of the cardinal rules: he's not to alter his own personal past, nor travel in time with his body left unsupervised. When Sam was 15, a house fire claimed Jenna's life, but Sam altered time so that Jenna survives. However, Sam's interference with events resulted in the fire killing his parents instead. After Goldburg's departure, their bartender Vicki (Melissa Jones) seductively offers Sam a seductively-named cocktail; he and Vicki have sex, but upon seeing Rebecca's photo, he cannot continue.  Sam changes his mind and agrees to help Elizabeth out. He tries to help Lonnie without time-traveling, but Lonnie refuses the help, believing Sam to be the culprit. Frustrated, Sam travels back to June 1998. He first runs into a drunk Elizabeth, and tells her to stay in her locked car. He goes into Rebecca's bedroom to find her already dead; meanwhile, Elizabeth is attacked in her car from behind and killed. Sam returns to the present, to learn he no longer owns a car, is renting his couch to a roommate named Paco (Ulysses Hernandez), and no longer works for the police. Instead, he is an obsessed former suspect for Rebecca's murder who has repeatedly asked for the case file. He goes to see Lonnie, who in this present is a lawyer who uses a wheelchair. He tells Sam he had driven by, saw Elizabeth and Sam talking, and did not stop. Sam visits Goldburg, who suggests he go back to the scene of the third murder and this time only observe. Sam also visits Jenna, who is significantly better off and living more cleanly; she refuses to help him.  Sam travels back to September 2000 and witnesses the third victim, Anita Barnes (Chantel Giacalone), being attacked, only to learn it is her boyfriend attempting to cater to her [[Rape fantasy|rape fetish]]. He is discovered and her boyfriend's punch sends him back to the present, where now Sam is renting a couch from Paco, who is about to evict him for non-payment. Goldburg is missing, and Lonnie is now the third victim, while Anita remains alive, pepper-spraying Sam in the face after he approaches her in the street.  At her apartment, Jenna tells Sam that Goldburg was about to implicate him in the murders, and furthermore tells him she fears a future Sam is the murderer. Sam complains he is now "too stupid" to fix things; Jenna [[Pinky swear|pinky-swears]] him to not time-travel anymore. Drunk at the bar, Sam propositions Vicki, who is engaged in this timeline. After Sam leaves, the killer shows up and murders Vicki; her body is found by the police near a car body plant. As Sam left his bar receipt behind, he is hauled in by the police. Jenna extricates him; the police put a tail on him as he leaves. As he leaves, he takes Det. Glenn's (Lynch Travis) evidence notebook, which he uses to look at the scene of the crime and travel back to September 2004, before the bodies were found by the police.  He returns to the present to find himself on Jenna's couch as she leaves for work, reminding him to clean up after himself and have dinner ready for her return; their positions now effectively reversed from the beginning of the film. Sam returns to the auto plant, where the police lie in wait to arrest him. Sam convinces Det. Glenn to release him by telling him how his wife (Andrea Foster) mistook Glenn for [[MC Hammer|M.C. Hammer]] on their first meeting. Returning home, Sam accidentally inhales some [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|burundanga]] flowers, sent from Goldburg's greenhouse, and can barely haul himself into the bathtub, before time-traveling back to the abandoned auto plant, where he finds a severely injured Goldburg. Running for help, Sam is felled by a foothold trap.  The killer approaches the trapped Sam, removing her mask as she does so, to reveal that the killer is actually Sam's sister Jenna, who can also time travel. She has an [[incest]]uous love for her brother, having killed the women, either because she perceived them as rivals for Sam's affections, or because they were new witnesses, introduced by Sam's rescue attempts. Sam travels back in time to the day of the fire that killed his parents; instead of saving Jenna (Catherine Towne), he traps her in her burning room. He awakes in a new timeline where he has married Elizabeth (not Rebecca), and he, Elizabeth and their daughter Jenna (named after his now-dead sister) (Alexis Sturr) are pulling up to a family barbecue, where he is greeted by his parents, Rebecca, and a perfectly healthy Goldburg.  The film closes as Sam's daughter puts her fashion doll on the grill and smiles as it begins to melt.

Nick's leg is completely trapped and after a day of waiting and hoping for a rescue party to arrive, he suggests they cut his leg off so they can keep going. Lori at first disagrees with the plan, but eventually relents and retrieves Henry's knife from his body, then returns to Nick. By this point, infection has set in and Nick is in very bad shape, barely being able to move at all. Lori succeeds in severing Nick's leg and cauterizes the wound by heating the blade of the knife on the fire. When night falls, a pack of wolves gets attracted by the smell of blood and tries to attack them, but Lori successfully chases them off with fire and the knife.  At sunrise, Lori fashions a stretcher to move Nick, but the wolves track the smell and keep following them. The stretcher breaks but Lori still attempts to drag Nick on, rejecting his pleas to leave him behind. The wolves are relentless in their attack, and being exhausted from days without food or water, Lori loses the ability to defend him. The wolves surround them, so to prevent Nick from suffering through being eaten alive, she performs [[euthanasia]] on him by suffocating him. She breaks down and goes into shock as a rescue helicopter rounds the edge of the canyon; paramedics start to administer first aid while she's kneeling next to Nick's body.

 The [[Jersey Devil]] appears in quick flash glimpses in the very beginning of the film as it growls. After Cap ([[Alan C. Peterson]]) kills the man who sold him the Jersey Devil, Cap and his assistant attempted to bring the Jersey Devil into the carnival of the truck. Cap shoots it with a tranquilizer dart to calm the Jersey Devil down. However, as Cap's assistant heaves on the Jersey Devil in chains, it slashes at his eye, causing it to bleed. Cap eventually shoots the Jersey Devil with more tranquilizer darts which causes the beast to finally pass out.  When the sheriff Atlas ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]) comes to investigate Cap's carnival under the local pastor's requests, Cap takes him into the tent where the Jersey Devil is being kept for the opening show. The Jersey Devil growls at Atlas from inside its cage and Atlas, shocked at the Jersey Devil's hellish appearance, suggests that the Jersey Devil is not safe. During the opening show, the audience is shocked at the sight of the Jersey Devil. All except for the pastor's son Taylor ([[Matt Murray (actor)|Matt Murray]]) and his friend who throws peanuts at the Jersey Devil from the audience. This angers the creature and the Jersey Devil eventually escapes from its cage and begins terrorizing the carnival. It throws a man inside the cage that it had been locked in and escapes the carnival right before flying into the Ferris wheel and injuring itself.  Later the following night, the Jersey Devil finds Taylor and his friend hiding in an old barn in the forest when it hears a dog barking at it. The Jersey Devil goes after the dog as Taylor and his friend escape the barn. However, the Jersey Devil eventually finds Taylor hiding under a bridge as his friend hides in an old car. The Jersey Devil lands on the bridge and then looks under it to find Taylor, who it kills and dismembers. Later when Taylor's friend, who survived the incident, and his mother are driving down a road in the forest, the Jersey Devil attacks him through the car window and flies off with him. As the mother is gazing at the skies trying to find him, the Jersey Devil drops his dead body on the car right before killing the mother.  Cap and his assistant later try to recapture the Jersey Devil by using tranquilizer darts. They stab Atlas' deputy to attract the Jersey Devil with the smell of his blood. However, as the Jersey Devil approaches, the deputy shoots at the beast right before dying, which causes the Jersey Devil to retreat. The Jersey Devil then sets its sights on Cap's carnival once more and kills several of his carnies. Cap later tries once again to recapture the beast by stabbing his own assistant to death to attract the Jersey Devil with his blood. The Jersey Devil soon arrives and sneaks up from behind Cap. Cap then shoots the Jersey Devil with his new tranquilizer darts that "have enough drugs in them to put an elephant to sleep for a week", which knocks out the Jersey Devil once more.  When Cap is arrested for murder after Atlas discovers part of a tranquilizer dart in his deputy's back, the Jersey Devil awakens from the tranquilizer darts and arrives at the police station where it kills Cap. The pastor, who wants revenge on the Jersey Devil and the carnival for the death of his son, stabs the Jersey Devil in its shoulders with two tranquilizer darts. This eventually knocks out the Jersey Devil. However, when the pastor and his followers arrive at the carnival, the Jersey Devil awakens right before the pastor's eyes. The Jersey Devil growls at the pastor and then kills him.  When Atlas arrives at the now burning carnival, he attempts to rescue one of Cap's carnies, Samara ([[Simone-Élise Girard]]), and the Jersey Devil arrives to kill them as it lands on one of the RVs. The Jersey Devil chases Samara to the Ferris wheel where the "Gentle Giant" attempts to stop it. However, the Jersey Devil attacks and kills him. Atlas eventually rams the Jersey Devil into the Ferris wheel with a car in attempts to kill him. As the Jersey Devil is rammed into the Ferris wheel by Atlas, it growls at him from the front car window until the Ferris wheel eventually collapses on both of them. This finally kills both the Jersey Devil and Atlas. Before the Jersey Devil dies, its hand is seen collapsing.  
Carriers (film)
  An infectious virus has spread worldwide, killing almost the entire population. This disease is spread by breath.   Two brothers, Brian and Daniel "Danny" Green, along with Brian's girlfriend, Bobby, and Danny's school friend, Kate, are heading to Turtle Beach in the [[Southwestern United States]], a secluded beach and motel where they believe they can wait for the viral pandemic to die out, so they can start a new life. They strictly follow a set of rules Brian created that they believe will keep them all alive and prevent them from becoming infected.  En route, they meet a man, Frank Holloway, and his infected young daughter, Jodie, whose Suburban has run out of gas, stranding them in the middle of a deserted back road. After driving off-road to get away from the pair, the group's car breaks down. The four end up returning to acquire Frank's car and are forced to take Frank and Jodie to a nearby high school where a serum for the pandemic is rumored to have been developed. Upon arrival they discover that the serum does not work, and the only doctor still alive is about to commit suicide with a remaining group of infected children (whom he plans to kill through non-voluntary euthanasia).  Meanwhile, Bobby is accidentally infected by Jodie, who coughs blood on her while Bobby is trying to help her stop choking. Bobby hides her infection from the others by wiping her face and hiding her blood covered shirt.   Jodie tells her father that she needs to use the toilet, but she is too weak to walk there alone. Frank carries Jodie to the toilet, telling Danny that he knows he's a good person (in hopes Danny will prevent the group from abandoning him and Jodie). However, despite Danny's protests, Brian leaves Frank and Jodie behind and takes their car.  After this, the four stop at a golf course hotel. Brian almost becomes infected after nearly slipping into a swimming pool containing the body of an infected man, but Danny manages to grab him in time. Bobby talks herself into believing she is not infected, as she is unsure that Jodie's blood contaminated her. However, despite Bobby's efforts to prevent it, Brian kisses her and inadvertently infects himself.  While Bobby berates Kate for believing her parents may still be alive, a small group of armed survivalists, who are using the golf course as a base, ambush and capture the group at gunpoint. After a tense [[Mexican standoff]], they declare their intent to keep the girls. As they force the girls to disrobe to check them for infection, the men discover Bobby's rashes and bruises, and force the entire group away at gunpoint. Kate stresses that they will end up dead if Bobby continues to travel with them, and Brian ends up leaving a weeping Bobby behind at a deserted gas station.  The trio almost runs out of fuel but encounters two women driving toward them from the opposite direction. After Brian blocks the road with their Suburban, Danny asks the women for help, stating that he has a pregnant wife in the car and that he is a fellow Christian, but they refuse. A desperate Brian shoots them for their fuel when they try to drive away, and ends up being shot in the leg himself.   Danny breaks into a seemingly abandoned house in search of medical supplies to treat his brother's wound and is forced to shoot a stray dog that attempts to attack him.  Danny soon discovers that his brother is also infected while tending to Brian's wound. Kate urges Danny to leave Brian whilst he is sleeping, but as the two try to leave Brian wakes up, and Danny and Kate discover that Brian has the car keys. Brian refuses to give them to Danny unless he can continue to travel with them, despite Danny's pleas. Brian admits that he doesn't want to end up alone like the rest of the infected and tells Danny to shoot him if he wants the keys.   At Brian's urging, Danny shoots Brian, and burns his mask and infected body. Afterwards, Danny and Kate reach Turtle Beach.  
Cargo (2009 film)
 It is the year 2267. After the earth has become uninhabitable due to an [[ecological collapse]], the remaining people live on overcrowded space stations in Earth's orbit. The young doctor Laura Portmann ([[Anna Katharina Schwabroh]]) is one of them. She hopes for a better future alongside her sister on the distant planet Rhea, but to get there, she needs money. She signs up with Kuiper Enterprises for a job on the decrepit cargo ship Kassandra, heading for an eight-year flight to unmanned Station #42 and back.  The crew consists of five members: Captain Lacroix (Pierre Semmler), Lindbergh (Regula Grauwiller), Yoshida ([[Yangzom Brauen]]), Prokoff (Claude-Oliver Rudolph), and Vespucci (Michael Finger). Crew members spend most of the fully automated flight in deep cryosleep while one person stays awake in 8½ month shifts to monitor the ship. Due to the current terrorist threat from the radical [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddite]] group '''' ("Machine Strikers"), there is also an additional security guard aboard: Samuel Decker (Martin Rapold). Toward the end of her shift, Portmann hears unusual noises from the cargo bay, and feels as though she is being observed. Her colleagues are awakened, and together the crew sets out to investigate the cold cargo space.  The crew discover a young girl in suspended animation inside a cargo container that was supposed to contain construction materials. Inspecting the girl's body, Portmann finds a "perfected" [[virtual reality]] connector embedded in the girl's spine. Later, Portmann sends an account of her finding to her sister on Rhea, and receives a reply in 20 minutes, rather than the usual matter of years. Portmann begins to wonder where the spaceship is really going and what cargo is actually being transported.  It eventually emerges that Rhea is actually a virtual reality simulation designed to keep the remaining humans hopeful about their future; the people in the cargo hold are going to be wired into a large mainframe, which is the ship's true destination. Upon discovering this, the crew decide to put an end to the deception. Upon arriving at their destination and while the ship automatically unloads its cargo, Portman enters the simulation to broadcast a "final transmission from Rhea", which reveals the simulated nature of the planet to the remaining humans, while Decker sabotages the mainframe's antenna.

Case 39
 Emily Jenkins ([[Renée Zellweger]]) is a [[social work]]er living in [[Oregon]], who is assigned to investigate the family of ten-year-old Lillith Sullivan ([[Jodelle Ferland]]), as her grades have declined and an emotional rift with her parents has emerged. Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lillith. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lillith's parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron ([[Ian McShane]]). Lillith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lillith until a suitable [[Foster care|foster family]] comes along. In the meantime, Lillith's parents, Edward and Margaret ([[Callum Keith Rennie]] and Kerry O'Malley) are placed in a [[mental institution]] for attempting murder.  Not too long after Lillith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emily's cases, a boy named Diego ([[Alexander Conti]]), suddenly murders his parents with a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lillith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily's best friend, Douglas J. Ames ([[Bradley Cooper]]). During the session, however, Lillith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night after receiving a strange phone call, Douglas is panicked by a mass of [[hornet]]s coming out of his body in hysteria and kills himself in the bathroom.  Emily gradually becomes fearful of Lillith, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lillith's parents. They tell her that, far from being truly human, Lillith is actually a [[Succubus]]-like demon who feeds on emotion, and that they had tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves. Lillith's father tells Emily that the only way to kill Lillith is to get her to sleep. Shortly after Emily leaves the asylum, Lillith's mother hallucinates being on fire, and her father is stabbed in the eye after attacking a fellow inmate through whom the voice of Lillith spoke. Barron initially thinks Emily should seek psychiatric help, but is later convinced when he receives a strange phone call in his home from Lillith. He arms himself to help Emily. However, he fatally shoots himself in the head with his shotgun, as Lilith makes him imagine he is being attacked by dogs.  After realizing that her closest colleagues have been eliminated, and that the rest of her cases will be next, Emily  serves Lillith tea spiked with [[sedative]]. While Lillith is asleep, Emily sets fire to her house, hoping to get rid of her. However, the girl apparently escapes unharmed (from this point on, the audience may wonder whether Lilith is really present or Emily is hallucinating her presence). A police officer offers to escort Emily and Lillith to a temporary place to sleep. As Emily is following the police cars, she suddenly takes a different route and drives her car at a high speed, hoping to bring fear to Lillith. Instead, Lillith forces Emily to relive her childhood memory of her mother driving fast in a rainstorm. Emily fights through the memory, telling herself that it is not real. The image fades, and Lillith appears scared by the fact that Emily was able to fight through her illusion.  Emily drives the car off a pier. As the car sinks, Emily struggles to lock Lillith (now in her [[demon]]ic true form) in the trunk. Emily then attempts to swim to the surface. The demon grabs Emily's foot to stop her from swimming away but Emily struggles and eventually breaks free, as a trapped Lillith sinks to the bottom. Emily climbs out of the water and sits on the pier. Subsequent to the film, with Lillith defeated, the case was solved, and Edward and Margaret are safely released from the mental asylum.  ===Alternate ending=== On the DVD as a deleted scene in the Special Features section, Emily careens through the harbor gate and drives the car off the pier into the bay just as in the theatrical ending. The car sinks to the bottom and fills with water. Suddenly, a man swims down to the car, opens Lillith's door, and carries her to the surface, leaving Emily behind. Emily tries unsuccessfully to open her door but begins to pass out. Suddenly, the man reappears and frees her, too. As an ambulance carries Emily away, a news broadcast details the event, and Margaret Sullivan can be seen watching it. In the final scenes, Emily can be seen in handcuffs, frantically pleading with her lawyer to tell her where Lillith is, while Lillith arrives at the home of her new foster family.

After Tetsu arrives to retrieve the bicycle, Yuki inadvertently causes Cenco to transform back into its normally large form by poking it in the eye. Yuki is much more interested in Cenco than Tetsu and accompanies them into town. There, a boy named  ([[Ryōhei Kimura]]), who controls two of the creatures, confronts Tetsu in order to obtain Cenco. Tetsu manages to fend off Shū's attacks while also protecting Yuki, and they leave while Shū's creature is incapacitated. Shū confronts Yuki later that day and gets her to tell Tetsu to meet and fight Shū again.  The following day, Shū takes Yuki hostage to force Tetsu to come, and places her on a ledge of a tall building. After Tetsu arrives, Shū attacks from afar and manages to cut off one of Cenco's arms. To repair the arm, Cenco removes one of Tetsu's arms, which incapacitates him momentarily. Shū arrives with a much larger creature and Cenco takes Yuki within its body where Tetsu already is. Yuki gets Cenco to change control of it from Tetsu to herself, and after Shū's larger creature eats Cenco along with Yuki, she manages to take control of the larger creature as well. They are subsequently attacked by the military with tanks and missiles, but are protected for the time being when Tetsu changes the creature's shape to that of a massive walnut. Tetsu and Yuki are separated and Shū attempts to take control back from Yuki, but he cannot control the creature anymore and severs the link, effectively killing it. Tetsu makes it back with Cenco to where Yuki and Shū are, and Yuki knocks Shū out with Cenco transformed into a baseball bat. Afterwards, Yuki transforms Cenco into Tetsu's lost arm, which gives him back control of his limb. Shū is later shown having been rescued by his other creature.

During his tour of the prison, an accident occurs that knocks him unconscious. He is rushed to the empty but visibly haunted walls of cell 211. As this diversion unfolds, convicts  break free and hijack control of the penitentiary. Aware of the violence that is to come, the prison officers flee, leaving Juan stranded and unconscious in the heart of the [[prison riot|riot]]. When Juan awakens, he immediately takes stock of the situation; in order to survive, he must pretend to be a prisoner.  Juan manages to convince the other prisoners that he is one of them, and that he just entered the prison that very day for [[homicide]]. He not only makes himself believed as inmate, but befriends the violent, deep voiced leader of the riot, Malamadre, who takes him under his wing.  Malamadre discovers that [[Basque people|Basque]] [[terrorists]] associated with [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] are being held in the same prison, and plans to use them as a bargaining tool. When this hits the news, it triggers a stream of prison riots throughout the country as well as demonstrations in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. Juan quickly realizes that he is on his own as the situation becomes more politicized and the government gets involved, afraid of potential ramifications in the Basque community.  Juan's pregnant wife, Elena, slowly learns about his impossible situation and heads for the jail. Once there she is brutally beaten outside the prisons, while trying to get information about her husband. A TV inside the prison cell block reveals the information to the prisoners. Camera footage indicates that Elena was at the riot. Fearful for her safety, Juan insists on learning information regarding her status.  Malamadre demands information of all those injured by the riot. The authorities respond with a short list of only four names. This infuriates the prisoners, who believe that the police are withholding information, and decide to kill one of the ETA prisoners. However, Juan intervenes and suggest they merely cut off an ear, an act he is forced to perform himself.  The authorities then provide additional information on all the injured. Juan learns Elena is in the hospital, though he is told she is recovering. Juan insists on talking to her but is rebuffed. Utrilla, the police guard who hit Elena, is suspended and asked to leave. Meanwhile, Apache, an inmate close to Malamadre, learns the truth behind Juan's status as a guard, having contacted a friend at the police via a secret cell phone. He tells Juan he will give him a chance to defend himself before letting Malamadre know.  Later, Malamadre has Apache tell Juan that he needs to speak to him. Juan is brought to a secluded room, the door closed behind him, and several of Malamadre's men surround him. He asks, nervously, "What faces?" in an effort to defuse the situation given his worry that Apache betrayed his true status. Instead, Malamadre shows Juan a cell phone video from a different camera at the outside riot. The footage shows that Elena was beaten by Utrilla, another prison guard, who then proceeded to leave her on the ground. Juan insists that Utrilla be brought inside.  Inside, Utrilla is faced with the cell phone footage by an infuriated Juan. Juan again insists on talking to Elena, but he instead learns that both she and her unborn child have died. In response, the prisoners viciously beat Utrilla until he loudly insists that Juan is a prison guard. He asks Juan to tell the truth; instead, Juan slits Utrilla's throat and fully joins the prisoners in their fight, having lost all will and reason for life outside. In private Malamadre and his other cohorts are furious but Malamadre leaves him alone, given that he ruthlessly killed Utrilla. Juan proceeds to his cell and attempts to commit suicide by hanging himself with a belt. He fails as the belt breaks under his weight.  Malamadre receives a call from the negotiator asking him to collect a file. They tell him that Juan Oliver is a prison guard and leave the file for Malamadre to see. Malamadre says it is only a piece of paper and heads back inside telling the negotiator that they are just trying to make him kill Juan.  The government sends a messenger to deal directly. The government acquiesces to Malamadre's demands. However, Juan drags Utrilla's corpse in front of the liaison and insists that the government agree in public or they will kill the ETA prisoners. Malamadre is furious at being upstaged though he understands that Juan is correct. Malamadre tells Juan that if the [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO]] team invades instead of agreeing, then he will either die or kill Juan. In either event, Malamadre insists only one of them will live, as punishment for Juan's betrayal.  The government does not agree to the demands and sends in the GEO team. Apache kills Juan and severely injures Malamadre, and it is unclear if he will become the new prison king or if Malamadre, as soon as he will heal from his injuries, will exact vengeance upon him. At a secret inquiry held by the government, the prison officials regret Juan's death but did the best they could in the situation. Finally, the prison official simply asks, "Any more questions?"

His loyal employee [[Bob Cratchit]] asks Scrooge to allow him to have a day off on Christmas Day to spend time with his family, to which Scrooge reluctantly agrees before leaving. In his house, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his deceased business partner [[Jacob Marley]], who warns him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife like he was, carrying heavy chains forged from his own greediness. Jacob informs Scrooge that three [[spirit]]s will visit to guide him out of his misery.

The spirit transports Scrooge to Bob's residence, discovering that Tiny Tim has died. Scrooge is then taken to a cemetery, where the Ghost points out his own grave, confirming Scrooge was the man who died. Scrooge promises to change his ways just as the Ghost shows his face and forces him to fall into his empty coffin lying in a deep grave that sits above the fires of [[Hell]].

Cho Kamen Rider Den-O & Decade Neo Generations: The Onigashima Warship
 [[File:Cho Climax Form.jpg|thumb|left|Kamen Rider Den-O's Super Climax Form debuts in this film, seen here at a pre-release press conference.]] Taking place after the events of ''Kamen Rider Decade'' episode 15, under the impression that they saved the World of Den-O, [[Kamen Rider Decade (character)|Tsukasa Kadoya]] and company begin their journey to the [[List of Kamen Rider Decade characters in the Nine Worlds#World of Kabuto|World of Kabuto]] when they are halted by Sieg who presents them a manuscript that detailed the legendary Oni Conquest with Momotaros' image on it. As this occurred, the Tarōs mysteriously vanish from the DenLiner as they are about to help [[Kamen Rider New Den-O|Kotaro Nogami]] out with the true threat to their world.   Meanwhile, in the year 1980, a boy named Yu encounters Mimihiko and then Yu is possessed by Deneb who gets him away from the Gelnewts before New Den-O arrives to cover his escape. Deneb then brings Yu to Ryotaro, revealing Mimihiko to be one of the Oni of legend and is searching for the  which Yu possesses. Seeing Yu reluctant to give them the item, Ryotaro leaves him with a DenLiner admission ticket should he change his mind. The next day, Yu runs off after learns that his father wants him to leave with him. Learning he is hunted by the Gelnewts, Yu tries to outrun the monsters on his bike before managing to reach the sands of time where the DenLiner is waiting for him. Giving them the Trump Stone, Yu wishes to be remain on the train. Though Owner warns him their intent to go back in time to fight the Oni, Yu refuses to turn back. After Yu is informed on the effects the distortions had on Ryotaro and Yuto, the former regressed to a child while the latter has mysteriously disappeared, the DenLiner arrives at the Junction Point where they meet the Station Master who reveals a 1936 newspaper revealing that Urataros, Kintaros, and Ryutaros are making a living as rice thieves in the bodies of another trio named Jiro, Ramon, and Riki (the Arms Monsters of ''[[Kamen Rider Kiva]]''). During that time, the kids find Tsukasa who offers his aid. Kotaro is reluctant to accept his help until Tsukasa reveals the scroll Sieg brought with him that has Momotaros on it.   Arriving in the [[Muromachi period]], DenLiner gang arrive and defeat the Gelnewts, meeting Toki and joining her at the village's pleas. Once at [[Onigashima]], New Den-O and the villagers catch the Gelnewts off guard as the kids find Momotaros. Deneb asks Yu to form a contract with him, at least until Yuto returns, to be able to assist the others in. Den-O and Deneb join the fray as Kuchihiko arrives and assumes his Rider form Goludora. During the fight, Toki takes a hit meant for Yu before New Den-O is defeated. Using Kotaro as a bargaining chip, Goludora gives them a day to accept his demands for both the Trump Stone and the DenLiner. The next day, after planning it out, the DenLiner gang gives up both the Trump Stone and the DenLiner. Once the Owner and Naomi are evicted, Kuchihiko ditches Kotaro as he enters the DenLiner to reach his brother in the present time period. However, his journey is staged as the evicted "Owner" is the Station Master in disguise as the real Owner pulled the emergency break as everyone else has erected a massive set designed to look like modern Tokyo. Once the DenLiner staff and the Station Master enter the train, with Kohana guarding the door, Den-O, the Tarōs, and New Den-O battle Goludora and the Gelnewts with Toki providing backup, until she is wounded in battle.  However, Diend appears long enough to summon Kamen Riders Ouja, G3 and Caucasus as wild cards in the fight and Kuchihiko reassembles the Oni's Trump Stone with Mimihiko activating the Demon's Warship in the present and using it to return to the past. The Oni Brothers are able to defeat them until Tsukasa and Sieg arrive, allowing Den-O to assume Wing form as Momotaros possess Tsukasa to fight as Decade. The other Tarōs do the same with Diend's summoned Riders (Urataros with G3, Kintaros with Caucasus and Ryutaros with Ouja) while Deneb enters Kotaro, enabling Kamen Rider New Den-O to assume Vega Form. Helping Toki fire her arrow, Yu manages to break the Demon's Warship’s anchor to give the Kamen Riders time to set up a way to end the fight. At Decade's suggestion, Ryotaro forms Kamen Rider Den-O Super Climax Form with the Tarōs and Sieg. Cho-Den-O and Decade manage to overwhelm the Oni Brothers with New Den-O Vega Form and Teddy's aid. After Shilubara sacrifices himself to protect his brother, an enraged Goludora enters the Warship and engages the DenLiner in a battle with Decade taking his leave as the DenLiner gang manages to sink the Warship from the inside out as Kamen Rider Den-O Sword Form finishes Goludora off with a new Rider Kick attack. Soon after, Yu bids farewell to Toki as she is revealed to be his ancestor. Though offered a slight detour before they return to present, Yu turns it down as he wants to be back in his time. After they part ways, Deneb is dropped back in 2009 where he finds Yuto waiting for him, where he reveals that he went by the name Yu as a child and they return to the ZeroLiner.  
Children of the Corn (2009 film)
  In 1963, the town of Gatlin, [[Nebraska]], is suffering a severe drought. In a tent,  a boy preacher (Robert Gerdisch), claims that an [[Old Testament]]-era [[Canaan]]ite God whom he calls "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" has spoken to him in his dreams. He tells the other children that the sinful adults are the reason for the drought, prompting them to kill everybody over the age of nineteen in town. They then establish a death [[cult]] with the prime rule that, upon reaching the age of nineteen, one must be sacrificed to the cult's God.  Twelve years later, a bickering couple, [[Vietnam War|Vietnam veteran]] Burt ([[David Anders]]) and his wife Vicky ([[Kandyse McClure]]), are driving near Gatlin, planning their second honeymoon, when a boy named Joseph (Remington Jennings) stumbles out of the roadside corn in front of their car. After running Joseph over, Burt realizes the boy's throat was slashed. Wrapping and placing the body in the trunk, Burt tells Vicky to wait for him while he looks around. In the cornfield, Burt finds Joseph's bloodied suitcase. He and Vicky drive off in search of aid, not realizing they are being watched by Isaac ([[Preston Bailey]]), the 9-year old current cult leader, and 18-year-old warrior Malachai ([[Daniel Newman (American actor)|Daniel Newman]]).  After hearing a group of children giving an evangelical sermon over the radio, Burt and Vicky reach an abandoned gas station. Finding the phones non-functional Burt decides to go to Gatlin. While Burt drives, Vicky finds an amulet which she recognizes as a [[pagan]] creation. Meanwhile, in the cornfields, Isaac tells the others about Burt and Vicky and that they, like the "blue man" (a police officer who was crucified for trying to stop them) must be killed to appease "He Who Walks Behind the Rows", who demanded Joseph be killed for trying to escape.  Reaching the town, Burt and Vicky find it seemingly abandoned, with a calendar in a bar still reading 1963. Coming across a church with a sermon board dated last week, Burt goes in to investigate, ignoring Vicky's pleas that they should just leave. Inside the church, Burt finds various [[occult]] drawings, a larger version of the trinket in Joseph's suitcase and a book listing the birthdays of the town's inhabitants.  As Burt reads the book, Vicky is surrounded and attacked by Malachai and several other boys. She manages to kill one of them with Burt's shotgun before Malachai stabs her. Burt rushes outside just as Malachai blows the car up. Chased by the children into an alleyway Burt is taunted by Isaac who throws a knife at him which hits him in the arm. Killing two of the older boys, Burt runs off into the cornfields.  In the alleyway, Isaac confronts Malachai, telling him that by spilling Joseph's blood in the corn he angered He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Questioning Malachai's faith, Isaac has him pray before they regroup with their followers, who they tell must sacrifice Burt in the clearing where the blue man's corpse is held. Malachai and the children begin hunting Burt through the corn.  Malachai is told by Nahum (Paul Butler, Jr.), one of the younger boys, that he had a vision of He Who Walks Behind the Rows, leading Malachai to believe Nahum will be the new prophet after Isaac. Malachai mentions that they must finish the search before dark, as that is He Who Walks Behind the Row's time.  Burt begins having flashbacks to Vietnam and kills several of the children, including Nahum. At nightfall the worshipers abandon the search and return to the town. They have a feast prepared by the females, who seem concerned that Burt was not apprehended. Later that night, Isaac holds a sermon in the church based on the tenet of "be fruitful and multiply" and proclaims that the time of [[fertilization]] has come. He beckons a teenage girl (Zita Vass) and boy (Jake White) up to the front of the church and they immediately disrobe and have sex in front of the entire congregation.  Burt, lost and delusional, has visions of all those he has killed, and begins wandering around aimlessly, searching for the road as the plant life begins attacking him. He finds the clearing and discovers Vicky, who has been made into a scarecrow. Hallucinating that Vicky's body is talking to him, Burt is faced by He Who Walks Behind The Rows, who proceeds to [[disembowel]] him and rip his eyes out in a form of [[ritual sacrifice]].  The next day, Isaac tells the children that He Who Walks Behind The Rows is displeased with their inability to kill Burt, who He had to dispose of Himself—like the blue man (who, when killed, reduced the 'age of favor' from twenty to nineteen). Isaac informs everyone that the age of sacrifice has been lowered from nineteen to eighteen as punishment for their failure. After the children leave Isaac stands in front of a pile of the children's bodies and as he sets them on fire shouts "Scarecrow!". The scarecrow is revealed to be Burt.  Later, Malachai and the other eighteen-year-olds enter the cornfields at dusk, offering themselves to He Who Walks Behind the Rows. While saying goodbye, Malachai's pregnant lover Ruth ([[Alexa Nikolas]]), whose faith had earlier been shaken, has a vision of herself setting fire to the corn.

City of Life and Death
 ''City of Life and Death'' is set in 1937, shortly after the beginning of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] has just captured [[Nanjing]] (or Nanking), capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. What followed is historically known as the [[Nanking Massacre]], a period of several weeks wherein massive numbers of Chinese prisoners-of-war and civilians were killed by the Japanese military.  After some commanders of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] flee Nanking, a Chinese soldier Lieutenant Lu Jianxiong and his comrade-in-arms Shunzi attempt to stop a group of deserting troops from leaving the city, but as they exit the gates, they are captured by Japanese forces that have surrounded the city.  As the Japanese comb the city for enemy forces, Superior Private (later Sergeant) Kadokawa Masao and his men are attacked by Lu Jianxiong and a small unit of both regular and non-regular soldiers, who fire at them from buildings. Lu and his companions are eventually forced to surrender as more Japanese troops arrive. The Chinese prisoners-of-war are systematically escorted to various locations to be mass executed. Shunzi and a boy called Xiaodouzi survive the shootings and they flee to the [[Nanking Safety Zone]], run by the German businessman and [[Nazi Party]] member [[John Rabe]] and other Westerners. Thousands of Chinese women, children, elderly men and wounded soldiers take refuge in this safety zone. However, the zone is forcefully entered several times by bands of Japanese soldiers intent on making sexual advances on female refugees. Due to the repeated intrusions, the women are urged to cut their hair and dress like men to protect themselves from being raped. A prostitute called Xiaojiang refuses to do so, saying that she needs to keep her hair in order to earn a living.  Meanwhile, Kadokawa develops feelings for a Japanese prostitute named Yuriko, and struggles to come to terms with the omnipresent violence around him with his own conflicting impulses. Despite his feelings of alienation, Kadokawa brings Yuriko candy and gifts from Japan, and promises to marry her after the war.  Rabe's secretary Tang Tianxiang and a teacher named Jiang Shuyun manage the daily operations of the safety zone. Even though he is in a privileged position, Tang is still unable to protect his young daughter from being thrown out of a window by a Japanese soldier, and his sister-in-law from being raped. When the Japanese officer Second Lieutenant Ida Osamu demands that the refugees provide 100 women to serve as "[[comfort women]]", Rabe and Jiang tearfully make the announcement to the community. Xiaojiang and others volunteer themselves, hoping that their sacrifice would save the refugees.  Kadokawa meets Xiaojiang and brings her rice but witnesses another soldier raping her as she lies almost lifeless. Later, many "comfort women", including Xiaojiang, die from the abuse, and Kadokawa sees their naked bodies being taken away. Kadokawa feels further estranged when he witnesses Ida shooting Tang's sister-in-law May, who has become insane.  Rabe receives an order to return to Germany because his activities in the safety zone are detrimental to diplomatic ties between his country and Japan. Tang and his wife are allowed to leave Nanking with Rabe. However Tang changes his mind at the last moment and trades places with a Chinese soldier pretending to be Rabe's assistant, saying that he wants to stay behind to find May. Mrs Tang reveals that she is pregnant before bidding her husband farewell. Not long after Rabe left, Ida has Tang executed by firing squad.  The Japanese disband the safety zone and start hunting for Chinese men who were previously soldiers, promising that these men would find work and receive pay if they turn themselves in. However, men deemed to be soldiers are huddled into trucks and sent for execution. Shunzi, who survived the earlier mass killings, is physically checked and initially deemed to be a non-combatant, but is later recognised by a Japanese soldier and brought onto a truck as well.  After [[Minnie Vautrin]] and other Westerners plead with the Japanese, Ida permits each refugee to choose only one man from the trucks to be saved. Jiang Shuyun rescues a man, pretending to be his wife, and then returns for Shunzi, claiming that he is her husband, while Xiaodouzi acts as their son. Kadokawa sees through Jiang's ruse but does not expose her. Despite this, another Japanese soldier points her out to Ida and the three of them are captured. Shunzi is taken away again, this time together with Xiaodouzi. Jiang, knowing that she will be raped, asks Kadokawa to kill her. He grants her her wish and shoots her, much to his comrades' surprise.  Afterwards, Kadokawa looks for Yuriko and learns that she has died after leaving Nanking. He says that she was his wife and requests that she be given a proper funeral. As the Japanese perform a dance-ritual to celebrate their conquest of Nanking and honour their war dead, Kadokawa reveals his emotional turmoil over what he has done and witnessed.  Kadokawa and another Japanese soldier march Shunzi and Xiaodouzi out of town to be executed, but to their surprise, Kadokawa releases them instead. Kadokawa tells the other soldier, "Life is more difficult than death." The soldier bows to show his respect for Kadokawa's decision and walks away. Kadokawa then weeps before shooting himself to escape from his guilt.  In the end credits, it is revealed that Mrs Tang lived into old age, as did Ida Osamu, and that Xiaodouzi is still alive today.  
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)
 Flint Lockwood is a wannabe-scientist who lives in Swallow Falls, a tiny island in the middle of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] that has sardines as the base of its economy. Flint lives with Tim, his widowed technophobic father, and his pet monkey, Steve. Despite Flint's zealous enthusiasm, his inventions, including spray-on shoes, a remote controlled television, rat birds, hair-un-balder, and a flying car, all ended in failure.  Flint then invents a machine that transforms water into food, called the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator" (FLDSMDFR). Flint turns on the FLDSMDFR in his laboratory, but ends up overloading the house's electrical supply. He then decides to power the machine by hooking it up to a nearby power plant. When he turns the machine back on, it ends up rocketing through town, destroying Sardine Land (a park conceived by the mayor to increase tourism) before ultimately shooting up into the sky. While recovering from his failure, Flint meets Samantha "Sam" Sparks, a weather intern whose big break was ruined thanks to his actions. Their conversation is cut short when rainbow colored clouds float over the town and begin to rain cheeseburgers.  The town rejoices in their renewed food choices, and Flint creates a communication device to send orders to the machine and order it to create different types of food. Swallow Falls (now renamed Chewandswallow) suddenly becomes a successful "food tourism" destination. Everything is going well until the townsfolk start greedily requesting food from Flint's machine. Flint notices that the food is beginning to grow larger in size. Although he is concerned that the food is starting to "over mutate", the now [[Obesity|morbidly obese]] mayor sees it as profitable for him and the city, and guilts Flint into continuing to make food rain.  Citizens and worldly tourists in Chewandswallow are blissful until suddenly a large tornado formed of spaghetti and meatballs threatens the town. Flint rushes to his lab to turn the FLDSMDFR off and attempts to send a "kill code" to stop the machine, but the mayor, while trying to stop him by throwing a giant radish at him, accidentally destroys the communication device. With Flint unable to control the machine, a massive food storm is created which threatens the world. When Flint's father encourages him to fix the mess, Flint gains self-confidence, places the kill code in a [[USB flash drive]], and builds a new flying car to reach and deactivate the FLDSMDFR, with the aid of Sam, her cameraman Manny, Steve and Brent (namesake of the Baby Brent Sardine cannery).  As they approach the machine in the sky, they find that it is now at the core of a giant meatball, where clouds go in the top and a food hurricane comes out the bottom. The machine sends living food to attack them. In the chaos, the flash drive with the kill code is sucked by the wind out the window.  Back at Chewandswallow, the citizens and tourists escape while the last leftovers fall. Mt. Leftovers collapses, causing an avalanche of food that destroys the town. Despite the avalanche ravaging Flint's Lab, Tim manages to re-send the kill code to Flint's cell phone from there. Flint then goes inside the meatball, finds the machine, and connects the phone to a port. To his dismay, Flint discovers that Tim sent him the wrong file, so he is unable to stop the FLDSMDFR. Flint then gets an idea and uses his Spray-On Shoes formula on the machine, causing it to explode. With the machine destroyed, the food storm subsides and everyone is able to return safely to Chewandswallow. Tim finally shows his appreciation for his son and his inventions and Flint and Sam celebrate with a kiss. Meanwhile, the obese mayor is seen stranded in the middle of the sea, having eaten nearly all of his peanut butter and jelly sandwich boat, while muttering that his plans were not well thought out.

Coco Before Chanel
 Several years after leaving the [[orphanage]] where her father abandoned her, a young Gabrielle Chanel finds herself working in a provincial bar. She is both a seamstress for the performers and a singer, earning the nickname 'Coco' from the song she sings nightly with her sister. A liaison with the charismatic Baron Balsan (Belgian actor [[Benoît Poelvoorde]]) gives her an entry into French high society, and a chance to develop her gift for designing increasingly popular hats.  Coco falls in love with English businessman [[Arthur Capel]] (American [[Alessandro Nivola]], who learnt French especially for the film), unaware that he is betrothed to a woman in England. Capel believes in Coco's talent making hats and her refusal to follow the whims of fashion; as he says to Coco, "There's no one else like you". As Coco's business flourishes and life is going well, Capel dies in a car accident; she is devastated. However, Coco still has the business that Capel helped her start as a reminder of their love.  
Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky
 An introductory scene takes place in Paris in 1913, where [[Coco Chanel]] attends the first, scandalous performance of [[Igor Stravinsky]]’s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. The rhythmic dissonance of the score and the surprising choreography of the piece result in heckling and outrage among much of the audience. But Chanel is impressed by Stravinsky and his music.  Seven years later, Chanel and Stravinsky meet again. Although her business has flourished, Chanel is mourning the death of her lover, [[Boy Capel|Arthur "Boy" Capel]]. Stravinsky has chosen to flee to France following the Russian Revolution. An immediate sympathy and attraction occurs between the ''couturière'' and the composer.  Chanel invites Stravinsky to live in her villa outside Paris, along with his ailing wife and their children. The summer months that follow see Chanel and Stravinsky begin an affair, one which Stravinsky's wife cannot avoid becoming aware of. Tensions between Stravinsky and his wife, and between Stravinsky's wife and Chanel, are unavoidable.  The film implies that the affair, and the later termination of the affair by Chanel, has a major influence on the lives of both Chanel and Stravinsky. It is during this time that Chanel creates [[Chanel No. 5]] with her perfumer, [[Ernest Beaux]], and that Stravinsky begins to compose in a new, more liberated style. During his time at the villa, he works hard on a revision of The Rite of Spring. One of the last scenes of the movie shows the revival of the ballet, with new choreography, and this time, shows that it was an artistic triumph and recognized as a masterpiece.  
Cold Souls
 [[Paul Giamatti]] is an actor who becomes so impassioned with the characters and roles that he plays that he has trouble disassociating himself from the character after the scene is done. As a result, his mind and spirit are a tangled mass of emotions that he seems to have trouble separating from his own feelings. As he struggles to play [[Uncle Vanya]], he reads an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' regarding "Soul Storage," which in fact is a procedural clinic that physically removes one's soul from his body.  While hesitant at first to go through with such a procedure, being unsure how it would affect him, Paul decides to go ahead. On visiting the clinic he discovers that most souls come out as gray matter or clouds. He decides to go ahead, declining the offer to look at his soul as it happens. He is distressed to discover that his soul comes out looking just like a [[chickpea]]. He has it stored in the clinic and returns to his life with 5 percent of his soul remaining. However, his life begins to fall apart; he has trouble associating with or making love to his wife Claire. Lacking in emotional intelligence, he says insensitive things, such as telling a friend to just "pull the plug" on her comatose mother, and his acting for the Chekhov play lacks believability. Not wanting his soul back just yet, he instead obtains the soul of what he is told is a Russian poet, whose memories entice him to be curious about her and her life as well as obtain a curiosity of his own. This Russian soul allows him to play Uncle Vanya excellently, but the experience overwhelms him and he decides to get his own soul back.  Paul's world is turned upside down when Nina, a Russian soul [[mule (smuggling)|mule]] who transports people's souls to and from Russia, steals Paul's soul for the wife of her boss at the Russian soul-storage operation, who aspires to be an actress. She receives Paul's soul, believing it to be the soul of [[Al Pacino]]. Her acting and happiness improve. Nina, the mule who carried Paul's soul and has become curious about him, eventually reveals the whereabouts of his soul, helping him to get it back. As the pair investigate the soul of Olga the poet, which he had 'rented' during this period, they learn that she committed suicide after not being able to get it back after selling it. Paul and Nina get his soul back, and after looking into it through the use of special goggles to reassociate himself to it, he returns to New York a happier man. Nina's soul is found, but Paul is told that it is unrecoverable due to the residues of souls that she has carried.  
The Collector (2009 film)
 A man named Larry and his wife return home to find the power is out. They discover a large box upstairs, and are horrified by its contents. They are then attacked by an unseen assailant.  Arkin O'Brien is an ex-convict working as a handyman. His latest customers are the Chase family. He is generally well-liked by the Chases, particularly their younger daughter Hannah. While working at the Chase home, Arkin notices several strange insects around the house. After work, Arkin meets his wife, whose debt to several loan sharks is due by midnight. In order to protect her and their daughter, Arkin plans a heist at the Chase home, which houses a valuable ruby. He breaks in, but as he attempts to crack the safe, a masked figure enters in the house and locks the door. Michael, the Chase father, appears injured, and attempts to attack Arkin with a golf club, thinking Arkin is the perpetrator. However, Michael is incapacitated by a trap rigged with the club, and the masked man drags Michael into the basement. Arkin attempts to call 911, but the phone is rigged with another trap, and the windows have been boarded up and lined with razors, making escape impossible.  Arkin retreats to the basement; Michael informs him that his wife Victoria is trapped as well, his older daughter Jill is out, and Hannah is hiding somewhere, and that a gun is in the safe, giving him the combination. Arkin then finds a captive Victoria and has her distract the intruder while he goes upstairs to get to the safe. Upon opening the safe, Arkin gets the gun (which has no bullets) and pockets the ruby. While searching for Hannah, he finds the same box from the beginning of the film. Hearing noises coming from the box, he opens it to find a bloodied Larry, who explains that the masked man is a "collector" of people; he only collects one person in a household and kills everyone else like he did to his wife. For the people he does not collect, he brutally tortures them until death. Horrified, Arkin unsuccessfully tries to escape, while the Collector locks Larry back in the trunk.  Arkin goes back downstairs and discovers Michael dead. He goes to Victoria, who had been tortured, and frees her. They try to escape the basement, but after Victoria notices Michael's corpse, she panics and runs into the Collector, who stabs her multiple times, injuring her, and throws her back downstairs. Shortly after, Jill arrives home with her boyfriend Chad. As the two prepare to have sex on the kitchen table, they notice the Collector watching them. Chad attacks him but is killed when he is pushed into a room filled with several bear traps. Jill is captured, but she manages to make a 911 call before being taken. Using an alarm clock as a distraction, Arkin frees Jill, but she doesn't trust him and is killed by a trap when she reaches for a pair of scissors. Arkin eventually decides to escape the house, but in the process, he sees Hannah in the window with the Collector coming her way. Refusing to leave her behind, he reenters the house and prepares a trap to kill the Collector with Hannah.   However, the Collector uses Larry as a decoy, so the trap kills Larry instead. Arkin then sends Hannah down a laundry chute to the basement where she hides. Before Arkin can go down the chute, the Collector attacks and knocks out Arkin. The Collector then takes Arkin captive and brutally tortures him. A police officer responding to Jill's 911 call tries to arrest the Collector and is killed by the Collector's dog, but manages to call for backup before dying. The distraction gives Arkin time to free himself, but he discovers Victoria dead and armed explosives in the basement. After killing the Collector's dog with a flaming bucket and trapping the Collector in one of his own traps, Arkin finally escapes with Hannah. Arkin, seeing several approaching police cars, runs into the road to get their attention but is accidentally hit by one of the cars. While lying injured in the road he sees Hannah being scooped to safety by one of the policeman. An injured Arkin tells a police officer that the Collector was an exterminator also working at the Chase house. The explosives promptly detonate and destroy the house, but the Collector is seen running away from the house unharmed.  While Arkin is being taken to the hospital in an ambulance, he discovers that the ruby is still in his pocket. He begs the paramedic to call his wife, but before he can, something unknown suddenly slams into the ambulance, flipping it over. The ambulance doors swing open revealing the Collector, who had escaped from the burning house undetected. After murdering the injured paramedic, he then kidnaps Arkin by dragging him out of the overturned ambulance and locking him in the box before driving away in his van.  In a post-credits scene, the Collector is sitting on the box while watching film slides. Inside, Arkin is heard screaming that he will kill him once he gets out; the Collector then kicks the box to shut him up.

Confessions of a Shopaholic (film)
 Rebecca Bloomwood is a [[Shopping addiction|shopping addict]] who lives with her best friend Suze. She works as a journalist for a gardening magazine but dreams of joining the fashion magazine ''Alette''. On the way to an interview with ''Alette'', she buys a green scarf. Her credit card is declined, so Rebecca goes to a hot dog stand and offers to buy all the hot dogs with a check, if the seller gives her back change in cash, saying the scarf is to be a gift for her sick aunt. This prompts a man who later turns out to be Luke Brandon to give her the $20 she needs for the scarf.  When Rebecca arrives at the interview, she's told that the position has been filled internally. However, the receptionist tells her there is an open position with the magazine ''Successful Savings'', explaining that getting a job at ''Successful Savings'' could eventually lead to a position at ''Alette'' magazine. Rebecca interviews with Luke Brandon, the editor of ''Successful Savings'' and the man who just gave her the $20. She hides her scarf outside his office, but Luke's assistant comes into the office and gives it back to her. Rebecca knows the game is up and leaves.  That evening, drunk, she and Suze write letters to ''Alette'' and ''Successful Savings'', but she mails each to the wrong magazine. Luke likes the letter she meant to send to ''Alette'' and hires her. Rather than completing a work assignment for a new column, Rebecca goes to a clothing sale. While inspecting a cashmere coat that she had just purchased, she realizes it is not 100% cashmere and she has been duped. This gives her an idea for the column, which she writes and submits to Luke. When asked if the article is to be published using her name, Rebecca is hesitant to use her real name and Luke creates the name "The Girl in the Green Scarf" and it as well as the article becomes an instant success.  "The Girl in The Green Scarf" becomes a huge hit. Her articles become very popular within business groups, and even Rebecca's own parents give her the advice to read her articles. The articles are referenced in business groups in Asia, causing the Successful Savings magazine to go international. This brings lots of praise to Rebecca, from her peers in the workplace, and her friend Suze. "The Girl In The Green Scarf" becomes so popular that she is asked to attend a TV interview, and meets with the owner of Alette magazine to purchase a dress for the interview.  Rebecca later returns home to renewed confrontations with her debt collector, Derek Smeath, so Suze makes her attend Shopaholics Anonymous. After one shopping spree she meets a friendly woman, Miss Korch, only to learn that she is the group leader and forces Rebecca to donate all the clothes she just bought, including a bridesmaid's dress for Suze's wedding and a dress for a TV interview. After the meeting Rebecca can't afford to buy back both dresses and buys back the interview dress, leaving the bridesmaid's dress behind. During the interview, Derek Smeath is in the audience and confronts Rebecca. ''Successful Savings'' terminates Rebecca's column after the public confrontation for bringing discredit on the magazine and believing she is a risk for not paying debts.  Suze is angry when she finds out that Rebecca lost the bridesmaid dress, and Rebecca feels she let everyone down. Rebecca's father, Graham, is more sympathetic, making a remark that the United States has not fallen despite its [[United States public debt|gigantic national debt]], and offers to sell his [[recreational vehicle]] to help her. Rebecca declines his offer, saying that he earned the camper through years of hard work and saving, and that she will need to tackle her debts on her own. ''Alette'' offers Rebecca a position at the magazine, but she declines. Meanwhile, Luke starts a new company, Brandon Communications.  In order to earn the money to repay her debts, the members of Shopaholic Anonymous help Rebecca stage a clothes sale, which generates a lot of revenue, but not enough to retire her debts. She finally sells her green scarf when a woman bids on it for $300, making it possible for her to give all the cash to the debt collector, which she pays in pennies—to give it to him in the "most inconvenient way possible".  Rebecca attends Suze's wedding after reclaiming her bridesmaid dress, and Suze forgives her. Walking past a Yves Saint Laurent window, she is tempted to buy a dress, but walks away. Rebecca then runs into Luke who returns the green scarf to her after revealing that the person who bought it at an auction was acting as his agent. Rebecca becomes romantically involved with Luke and starts working at his new company.  
Come What May (2009 film)
 Caleb Hogan (Austin Kearney) wants to transfer to [[Patrick Henry College]] (PHC) to compete on the [[Moot Court]] team. His mother, Judith (Karen Jezek), who is a [[Constitutional law]]yer, opposes his decision because Patrick Henry College teaches from a [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] perspective. Since Caleb insists that the PHC Moot Court team will provide him with the best training for working in her law firm, Judith agrees to pay for education on the condition that he wins the Moot Court National Championship.  The Moot Court topic is soon announced as a parental notification case, weighing the daughters right to have an abortion against her parents right to know about it. Caleb believes that the team will be most successful by arguing for a small exception to the apparent "right to abortion" by showing substantial parental interests, not because he himself supports abortion but because he insists that attempting to overturn [[Roe v. Wade]] will provoke a negative emotional response from the liberal judges. His partner, Rachel (Victoria Emmons), however, argues that they should make the case to overturn it and completely deny the right to an abortion.  Meanwhile, Judith is offered a case to argue in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] on behalf of an abortion clinic who violated a state's parental notification laws. Against the wishes of her husband, Don ([[Kenneth Jezek|Kenny Jezek]]), and her son, Caleb, Judith takes the case and asks Rachel to work as an intern at her law firm to help her prepare. As the Moot Court championship tournament draws near, Caleb is faced with a growing rift forming between his parents, an escalating argument with his debate partner and the future of his education and his family at stake.

Command Performance (2009 film)
 In August 1991, there was an attempted coup against Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] by ex-communist military hard-liners. The coup failed, and all members of it were arrested; from the ashes of the old Soviet Union, the modern Russian Federation was born.  Russian President Alexei Petrov ([[Hristo Shopov]]) has asked for pop sensation Venus ([[Melissa Smith]]) to perform a concert in Moscow, because his daughters Anna ([[Ida Lundgren]]) and Yana ([[Robin Dobson]]) are fans of Venus.  The concert turns bloody when armed men led by Oleg Kazov ([[Dave Legeno]]) take the concert hostage. It seems that Oleg has a personal vendetta against Petrov.  Former biker gang member Joe ([[Dolph Lundgren]]), the drummer of CMF, the opening rock band, starts fighting back. As it turns out, back in the USA, when Joe was still in the biker gang, some Colombians who wanted to collect a debt went to the apartment that Joe and his brother lived in.  The Colombians fatally shot Joe's brother. Joe hunted the group of Colombians down and killed them, and ever since then, Joe has tried to stay away from guns, because guns remind him of what the group of Colombians did.  Now, basically most of the civilians and staff, including Venus's brother Enzo ([[Atanas Srebrev]]), who was her manager, are killed by Oleg's men, all except Joe, Venus, reporter Ali Connor ([[Shelly Varod]]), American Ambassador Jim Bradley ([[Clement von Franckenstein]]), FSB agent Mikhail Kapista ([[Zachary Baharov]]), President Petrov, and his two daughters.  As it turns out, Oleg's father was Marshal Dmitri Kazov, a WWII hero in Stalingrad, and former [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Soviet Minister of Defence]]. Dmitri was a leader of the failed coup against Gorbachev in 1991. Oleg was part of the coup as well.  After Dmitri  killed Oleg's mother and then himself, that was when Oleg, a captain in the Russian army, immigrated to the USA, where he got arrested for some petty crimes. Oleg returned to Russia three weeks ago.  The prosecutor of Marshal Dmitri Kazov, Oleg, and other coup members in 1991 was a young Alexei Petrov, before he became the president of Russia. Now Oleg wants revenge on Petrov, because he believes that the special forces raid on the Kazov house that led Dmitri to kill Oleg's mother and then himself was Petrov's fault. Petrov, who ordered the raid, had followed the troops into the Kazov house.  Now, Joe and Mikhail make their way through the arena, trying to bring down Oleg and his men.  
Le Concert
  A former world-famous conductor of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] orchestra, known as "The Maestro," Andrey Simonovich Filipov, had had his career publicly broken by [[Leonid Brezhnev]] for defending Jewish musicians and is reduced to working as a mere [[janitor]] in the theatre where he once conducted, becoming an [[alcoholic]] in the process.   While cleaning his boss's office, he intercepts an official invitation from the prestigious [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in [[Paris]] to replace a concert of the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] that was canceled at the last minute. Filipov comes up with a plan to reunite his old orchestra, composed of old [[Jewish music|Jewish]] and [[Romani music|Gypsy musicians]] - who also have been reduced to making a living as movers or taxi drivers - to perform in Paris and complete a performance of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Violin Concerto (Tchaikovsky)|Violin Concerto]], which was interrupted 30 years earlier by former KGB Agent Ivan Gavrilov, who is enrolled by Filipov in his scheme as the orchestra's manager and is actively and efficiently supporting Filipov's plan, much to the dismay of Aleksandr 'Sasha' Abramovich Grossman (the orchestra's main cellist), because he suspects that Gavrilov has his own agenda for the Paris trip.   Gavrilov and Filipov demand several conditions from the Châtelet, that they are forced to accept, since the concert with the Bolshoi is significantly less expensive. One condition is that the solo violinist will be Anne-Marie Jacquet, who famously has never played Tchaikovsky's concerto because she is afraid of it. She has long dreamed of playing it with the Bolshoi and particularly with Filipov, whose fame outside of Russia has not diminished. Her agent, Guylène de La Rivière, who is also Anne-Marie's adoptive mother, is reluctant to allow that because she is acquainted with Filipov and his past, but Anne-Marie insists, and de la Riviere has no option but to accept. The orchestra is also forced to accept the sponsorship of an open [[Russian mafia|mafia]] boss who likes to play the cello, despite the fact that he does so terribly and who wants to be part of the orchestra.   Once in Paris, the entire orchestra disappears, partying and raising money in other jobs such as taxi drivers, movers or translators. The unprofessionalism of the Russian musicians and Anne-Marie's own impression that the performance serves as a means of [[catharsis]] for Filipov forces Anne-Marie to call off her participation in the concert. But Sasha convinces her to come to the theater because the Concert holds the key to Anne-Marie's past and her parents, whom she has never met, and whom she believes to be scientists who died during her infancy in the [[Alps]]. As it turns out, Filipov and his wife Irina were best friends of Lea and Yitzhak Strum, also Jewish musicians. Lea was an accomplished violinist and the soloist at the time of the interrupted concert thirty years before in [[Moscow]]. After the public humiliation they suffered under Gavrilov and the entire Brezhnev regime, the couple spoke openly against the government on [[Radio Free Europe]], an American radio station that was banned in the former [[USSR]]. As a result, they were deported to Siberia, where they spent the rest of their lives. Lea, Anne-Marie's mother, lost her mind and played the Tchaikovsky concert in her imagination every day for her husband until her death in 1981. Her husband died six months later. Guylene, at the time the representative of a visiting French orchestra, had managed to escape with Baby Anne-Marie hidden in a [[violoncello|cello]] case, at the behest of Irina, Filipov, and Sasha.  At the last moment, the entire orchestra, after receiving an SMS message calling them to play in honor of Lea, appears at the Theatre despite the fact that not a single rehearsal has taken place. In the meantime, the real manager of the Bolshoi, who happened to be vacationing in Paris and learned by chance about the concert, appears at the theatre to prevent the performance, but he is intercepted by Gavrilov, who locks him in a broom closet. The concert has a wobbly beginning due to the lack of rehearsals -even Gavrilov, who actually intended to speak at a Communist Party meeting asks God to demonstrate his existence by salvaging the situation-; the orchestra manages to reach Filipov's ideal of spontaneous [[harmony]] once Anne-Marie mesmerizes everyone with her magnificent interpretation of the solo part, which she had studied on her mother's annotated score. The concert is a huge success and Filipov is able to restart his career as a conductor of the new "Andreï Filipov Orchestra" along with Anne-Marie, who joins him in a world tour.

Congratulations (film)
 The film revolves around Ahmed Galal, an irresponsible, egotistical accountant working in a stock-trading company. At the beginning of the film, he is portrayed as a man who has no limits; a man who can fire employees just to maximize profits and who deals with his family with such carelessness that he is entirely out of touch with what is happening in their lives. The events of the film take place on Ahmed’s wedding day, which goes horribly wrong. He wakes up to experience the usual domestic routine: His father shouting at him to get out of the bathroom, his mother complaining of the workload, and his customary bickering with his sister. In the street, he witnesses a burglary but doesn’t bother to stop the thief. On his way back from work, he finds himself wrongly accused of a hit-and-run he didn’t commit. The onlookers persuade him into taking the victim to the hospital. After going to the police station, he finds that his car has been seized by the authorities. The climax is when, crossing the street, a huge truck hits him and he dies.  Well, technically, he doesn’t. He wakes up the next day, initially assuming that what has happened in the past 24 hours was a dream, before he experiences the same day all over again, meeting the same exact characters, having the same conversations and witnessing these unchanged incidents.

There, Coraline meets the ghosts of previous victims, including the missing twin sister of Wybie's grandmother. They reveal that the Other Mother, whom they refer to as the Beldam, created and sent button-eyed rag dolls that resembled them in order to spy on their lives.

Coraline promises to help.  Coraline is suddenly rescued from the mirror by the Other Wybie, whose mouth has been stitched by the Beldam.

The cat advises Coraline to propose a "game": if Coraline cannot find her parents and the ghosts' eyes, she will let buttons be sewn over her eyes, but if she can, they will all be set free. The Beldam reluctantly agrees.   One by one, Coraline finds the ghosts' eyes in the Other World, now turned nightmarish, from its deranged inhabitants. As she does, the Other Pink Palace Apartments' surroundings gradually disintegrate until only the living room is left. Inside, Coraline sees the Beldam in her [[arachnid|arachnoid]] form.

Her parents reappear in the real world, with no memory of what happened. That night, the ghosts warn her to get rid of the button key to prevent the Beldam from accessing the real world. As Coraline prepares to drop it down the well, the severed hand attacks her and tries to drag her back to the Other World. Wybie smashes it with a rock, then throws the remains and the key into the well and seals it shut.  The next day, Coraline and her parents, who have finally finished their work, host a garden party for the neighbors. Coraline also prepares to tell Mrs. Lovat the truth about her twin sister.

In the middle of the night, their home security alarm is activated when Jason shows up unexpectedly to further sell the idea of the retreat.

The women run into Salvadore who takes them to Eden East. The men come across the staff lounge where they find Sctanley playing Guitar Hero. He threatens to report them to Marcel, but Dave challenges him to the game (without telling Sctanley that he is involved in the game's production). Sctanley, after having lost the wager, directs them to Eden East, even though he knows he was tricked by Dave.  When they arrive, Dave realizes what a good thing he has with Ronnie. He goes with her to be alone at a waterfall. Joey finds Lucy with Salvadore and knocks him out, reuniting with his wife. Cynthia and Jason share drinks and end up becoming intimate. Shane runs into his ex-wife, who admits she still loves him. Shane tells Trudy to remain in Eden East and enjoy being single, then leaves with his ex-wife. All four couples return to Eden West.

Cosmonaut (film)
   
Crank: High Voltage
 Immediately after the events of [[Crank (film)|the previous film]], Chev Chelios ([[Jason Statham]]) lands in the middle of an intersection after falling out of a helicopter. He is scooped off the street via snow shovel by a group of Chinese medics and removed from the scene. Chev wakes up in a makeshift hospital and sees doctors removing his heart while Johnny Vang ([[Art Hsu]]) watches. The doctors place Chev's heart in a white cooler with a padlock, and place a clear plastic [[artificial heart]] in his chest. He wakes up sometime later and escapes. He notices a yellow battery pack is attached to him. After a gunfight and interrogation of a thug, he learns the location of Johnny Vang: the Cypress Social Club.  Chev calls Doc Miles ([[Dwight Yoakam]]), who says that Chev has been fitted with an [[AbioCor|AbioCor artificial heart]]. Miles informs Chev that once the external battery pack runs out, the internal battery will kick in and he will have 60 minutes before it stops working. While driving Chev crashes his car which destroys his external battery pack. After getting directions from a driver, Chelios has the driver use his jumper cables on him. At the club, Chev loses Vang but picks up a hooker named Ria ([[Bai Ling]]) who sends him to a strip club where Vang is hiding out. In the club, Chev finds Eve ([[Amy Smart]]), now a stripper (It is humorously revealed that the phone call Chev made to Eve while falling to his supposed death at the end of ''Crank'' was completely incomprehensible due to the wind rushing by, and the farewell he had left on her answering machine was merely how he imagined it would sound). A group of Mexican mobsters, led by Chico, show up looking for Chelios. After a gunfight, Chev learns that a mobster named "El Hurón" ("The Ferret") wants to kill him, but he doesn't find out why.  Outside of the strip club, Chev commandeers a police cruiser with Eve and another stripper. The stripper tells Chev that he should look at the Hollywood Racetrack for Johnny Vang. Along the way, Chev meets Venus ([[Efren Ramirez]]), who reveals himself to be Kaylo's brother (and unable to completely control his body due to "full-body [[Tourettes]].") Wanting his help, he tells Venus that El Huron was involved in his brother's death, but escaped. At the horse track Chev begins losing energy again. Another call to Doc Miles informs him that friction will cause static electricity to power the internal battery. Chev's attempts to generate electricity by rubbing himself against members of the audience prove ineffective, but Eve later arrives and they have sex on the racetrack, which generates enough friction to charge the heart. Chev spots Vang and leaves Eve behind. Vang escapes, and Chev is about to be subdued by security when Don Kim picks Chev up in his limo. He informs Chev that there is an ancient and prominent leader in the Triads named Poon Dong ([[David Carradine]]), who was in need of a heart transplant and chose Chev's to replace his. Chev kills Don Kim and his henchmen upon learning that Don Kim wishes to return him to Poon Dong for a reward. Meanwhile, Venus calls in Orlando ([[Reno Wilson]]) to assist in tracking down El Huron.  While searching for Vang, Chev boards an ambulance and steals a battery pack for his artificial heart. Chev exits the ambulance upon seeing Johnny Vang on the street outside and a shootout ensues before Chev subdues Vang. Chev discovers that Vang's red cooler doesn't contain his heart (it actually contains something that Chelios finds utterly disgusting but is never specified in the film). He then learns via cellphone from Doc Miles that his heart has already been transplanted into Poon Dong (who is shown using it to engage in various acts of revelry and depravity). Johnny Vang is shot and killed by Chico as Chev questions him, after which Chev is knocked unconscious. Doc Miles uses his secretary, Dark Chocolate, to lure Poon Dong into his apartment and retrieve Chev's heart.  Chev has a flashback seeing himself as a young boy, being [[Interrogation|interrogated]] by his mother ([[Geri Halliwell]]) and Luke Cunard (Jamie Harris) on the Luke Cunard show about his violent attitude and his already extensive criminal activities.  Chev is taken to an island where El Huron awaits. It is revealed that El Huron is, in fact, the brother of Ricky and Alex Verona, both of whom Chelios killed in the first film. He reveals Ricky Verona's head is being kept alive long enough to watch El Huron kill Chelios. El Huron is about to kill Chelios when Orlando, Venus and Ria show up, each with their own group of gunfighters, and a fierce shootout ensues. Chev kicks Rick Verona's disembodied head in the nearby swimming pool. Venus engages El Huron in a fight before he can kill Chev. As he starts to slow down, Chev climbs a nearby electric pole and grabs a pair of live wires to recharge. He is flung off the pole and set on fire by the massive current. He returns fully powered and on fire, just in nick of time to save Venus, and kills El Huron.  Due to a hallucination caused by the electric currents, he sees Ria as Eve and kisses her, inadvertently setting her on fire as well.  Chelios walks towards the camera, giving the [[Finger (gesture)|middle finger]] [[Breaking the fourth wall|to the audience]].  During the first portion of the end credits, Doc Miles replaces Chev's heart. At first it looks like a failure, but Chelios's eyes open wide and his heart monitor indicates normal activity  
Creation (2009 film)
 British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] is a young father who lives a quiet life in an idyllic village. He is a brilliant and deeply emotional man, devoted to his wife and children. Darwin is especially fond of his eldest daughter [[Anne Darwin|Annie]], a precocious and inquisitive ten-year-old. He teaches her much about nature and science, including [[Darwin's theory of evolution|his theory of]] [[evolution]], and tells her stories of his travels. Her favourite story, despite the sad ending, is about the young orangutan Jenny, who is brought from [[Borneo]] to the [[London Zoo]], where she finally died of pneumonia in the arms of her keeper. Darwin is furious when he learns that the family clergyman has made Annie kneel on [[Halite|rock salt]] as punishment for contradicting him about [[dinosaur]]s, which she takes as having become extinct long ago. This contradicts the church's position that life is unchanging and that the Earth is very young.  Having returned from his [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|expedition in the Galapagos Islands]] 15 years earlier, Darwin is still trying to finish a manuscript about his findings, which will substantiate his theory of evolution. The delay is caused by anxiety about his relationship with his devoutly religious wife, Emma, who fundamentally opposes his ideas, which pose a threat to established Anglican religion. Emma worries that she may go to heaven and he may not, separating them for eternity.  The film shows Annie, through flashbacks and Darwin's hallucinations, as a vibrant apparition who goads her father to address his fears and finish his big work. It is apparent that Annie has died, and that her death is a taboo subject between Darwin and Emma, as both feel intense blame for her death. As a result of the strained relations between Charles and Emma, they entirely stop having sex. Anguished, Darwin begins to suffer from a mysterious, fatiguing illness.  It is revealed that after Annie becomes ill in 1851, Darwin takes her to the [[Worcestershire]] town of [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] for [[James Manby Gully]]'s [[Water cure (therapy)|water cure therapy]], against Emma's will. Annie's condition worsens, and she ultimately dies after her father, at her request, tells her Jenny's story once more. Darwin is devastated, and her death sharpens his conviction that natural laws have nothing to do with [[divine]] intervention. To his contemporaries, this is an idea so dangerous it seems to threaten the existence of God. In a box in Darwin's study, we discover the notes and observations that will become ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.  Having read his 230-page synopsis, Darwin's friends in the scientific community, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], also encourage him. Huxley admiringly tells Darwin that with his theory he has "killed God", which fills Darwin with dread. In his hallucinations, he also feels that Annie disapproves of his procrastination.  Darwin receives a letter from [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1858, which details the same findings as Darwin in 20 pages. He has mixed feelings about this; all his work may have been in vain, but on the other hand, as he will not have to write his book, the discord with Emma will heal. However, Darwin's friends urge him to continue, as his book is much more comprehensive.  After receiving treatment at Malvern himself, Darwin makes a pilgrimage to the hotel where Annie died. The journey marks a change in him; upon his return home, he is able to reconnect with his wife, and they speak to each other for the first time of their fears and grief over Annie's death. They specifically speak about the possibility that Annie died because she was genetically weak, as Darwin and Emma are first cousins. Their renewed devotion restores Darwin's health, and he is able to resume his work. Emma's faith in their marriage is also restored, and she regains  strength to support his controversial work. Darwin decides that Emma must make the decision about publishing his work. After reading the manuscript, she quietly returns it to him, having addressed the package to [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray publishers]] in London. Emma accepts that she is an "accomplice" now, but hopes that God will forgive them both.  Darwin walks down the lane, holding the package. When the postman arrives, Darwin falters, almost letting him go empty-handed. The postman rides away, unaware of the powerful idea about to be released onto the world. As Darwin walks home, the little figure of Annie walks alongside him.  
Crazy Racer
 The plot follows four seemingly separate stories that intersect and converge at points throughout the movie. It begins with the protagonist, Geng Hao losing first place in a cycling race and subsequently being tricked into sponsoring an energy drink containing illegal performance-enhancing substances by corrupt businessman Li Fala which causes him to forfeit the winnings from his silver medal. Disgraced and outlawed from ever participating again in the sport, Geng Hao's coach suffers from a heart attack, prompting Geng Hao to seek retribution from Li Fala, who he believes is the cause. In the process of obtaining the money for his coach's funeral, Geng Hao crosses the paths of local criminals, perpetually confused policemen and Taiwanese gangsters. <ref>[http://twitchfilm.com/2010/06/nyaff-2010-crazy-racer-review.html  Joshua Chaplinsky NYAFF 2010: ''CRAZY RACER'' Review]</ref>  
Cracks (film)
 Set in the 1930s in a strict [[elite]] [[United Kingdom|British]] [[boarding school]] called St Mathilda's, the story centers on a [[clique]] of girls who idolize their enigmatic [[diving]] instructor, Miss G ([[Eva Green]]) (in the film, we learn that Miss G had been a student at the same school where she now works and, in fact, may have even continued on at the school after she graduated). Di Radfield ([[Juno Temple]]) has a crush on Miss G, and is the firm favourite and ringleader of her group. When a beautiful [[Spanish people|Spanish]] girl named Fiamma Corona ([[María Valverde]]) arrives at the school, Miss G's focus is shifted away from the other girls. It becomes a triangle: Miss G gets increasingly obsessed with Fiamma, Fiamma is disturbed by Miss G and also openly disgusted by the teacher's hypocrisies and deceptions, and Di is terribly jealous and makes Fiamma's life hell. In a very telling scene in the film that clearly highlighted Miss G's deceptions, Miss G (who claimed to be a world traveller to her "girls") goes to a nearby parochial town to buy some provisions. She is visibly upset by this trip and after buying her provisions and drawing the unwanted attention of some local louts, she returns to the school in, it would seem, a near panic. The bullying culminates in Di physically throwing Fiamma out of the school but, as she is unable to return to Spain as she hoped, Fiamma ends up back at the school later that night.  When Fiamma is eventually found, the two girls make the first steps towards friendship, and at the following dorm party they all get a bit drunk, and Fiamma faints. Miss G takes her to her own room. Then Miss G kisses her and rapes her while she is passed out; Di witnesses this through the room door, which was left ajar, and then flees.  The next morning, Fiamma is visibly upset, and is Miss G equally distressed as she runs around after her. Di is broody, and eventually tells the rest of her gang that ''Fiamma'' seduced Miss G. Fiamma presumably tells Miss G that she will report the molestation to the teachers, and horrified, Miss G realises her career will be over. She in turn manipulates Di's affection for her into anger. She says that Fiamma will make up lies about her molesting her (even though it was true) and plan to get her kicked out of school. Di absolutely refuses to allow this to happen. The confrontation between Di's gang and Fiamma turns ugly as Fiamma declines to answer Di's vicious questions and tries to explain what really happened, hinting at Miss G's lies and character defects. Fiamma runs into the forest as things become more violent, but the girls catch up with her and, under Di's leadership, beat her up with their fists and sticks. Fiamma starts to have an asthma attack, and the girls stop, terrified. They run to get help, and Di runs into Miss G (who had been watching the beating and the chase that ensued quietly and with no attempt to stop the beating), who says she'll stay with Fiamma, and directs Di to go get a teacher.  In the forest, Miss G, alone with Fiamma, refuses to give Fiamma her inhaler and calmly watches her die. Di returns just in time to see Miss G placing the inhaler in Fiamma's lifeless hand, and that's when she realizes the truth.  Later, Di tells the other girls what happened and, united, they confront Miss G. They are powerless officially, but they quit the diving team and symbolically turn in their sashes. The [[head teacher|headmistress]] refuses to acknowledge the school's culpability, and seems only concerned with the school's reputation, but releases Miss G from her duties.  The final scene has Di leaving the school to explore the world, as both Fiamma and Miss G had spoken of doing, whilst Miss G, fired from the school, goes to the local village and finds a small room she can live in, presumably closing herself away for the rest of her life. In a scene that perhaps allows the viewer a better understanding of Miss G's very complex personality, we see her put her few personal possessions on her bedside table. She puts one item there and then quickly removes it to make room for another item. After that, she counts the items to make sure that there are only five. The viewer is then reminded that when Fiamma arrived at the school, in the dorm room, Di had told her that only five personal items could be displayed on her night table at one time. The audience then realizes Miss G is as much a victim of the institutionalized setting she grew up in (she was perhaps like many of the girls at the school "dumped" there and basically forgotten about by her family) as Fiamma was her victim.<ref> </ref>  
Crazy Heart
 Otis "Bad" Blake ([[Jeff Bridges]]) is a 57-year-old [[alcoholic]] singer-songwriter who was once a [[country music]] star. He now earns a modest living by singing and playing his guitar in small town bars across the southwestern United States. Having a history of failed marriages (four that he admits to, although a reference is made to a fifth he does not discuss) Blake is without a family. He has a son, aged 28, with whom he has not had contact in 24 years. He is mostly on the road performing, staying in cheap motels and travelling in his old '78 Suburban alone. The film opens with his arrival at a [[bowling]] alley for a show.  Enter Jean Craddock ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]), a young journalist after a story, divorced and with a four-year-old son, Buddy (Jack Nation). She interviews Blake one evening after his gig, and then as they become close, Jean visits again ostensibly to gather more material, and the two enter into a relationship. Jean and her son become a catalyst for Blake beginning to get his life back on track. In doing so, he lets himself be pushed into renewing a professional relationship with Tommy Sweet ([[Colin Farrell]]), a popular and successful country music star he once mentored, and plays as the opening act at one of Tommy's concerts, despite his initial balking and wounded pride at being the opening act to his former student. He asks Tommy to record an album with him, but Tommy says his record company insists on a couple more solo albums before a duet project can be recorded. He instead suggests that Blake concentrate on writing new songs that Tommy can record solo, telling him he writes better songs than anyone else.  Blake's drinking soon gets out of control, and he ends up running off the road while driving drunk. In the hospital, the doctor informs him that although he only sustained a broken ankle from the crash, he is slowly killing himself, and must stop drinking and smoking and lose 25 pounds if he wants to live more than a few more years.  Blake's relationship with Jean makes him start to rethink his life. He calls up his son to make amends, only to have his son tell him that his mother, Bad's ex-wife, has died, and hang up on him.  The relationship starts to look up, with Jean visiting him with her son Buddy.  After a situation where Blake loses Buddy briefly at a shopping mall while drinking at a bar, Jean breaks up with him.  After losing Jean and her son, who were becoming his only family, Blake resolves to quit drinking. After going through a treatment program at a rehab center, and with support from his [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] group and his old friend Wayne ([[Robert Duvall]]), Blake finally manages to get sober. Having cleaned up his act, he tries to reunite with Jean, but she tells him that the best thing he can do for her and Buddy is to leave them alone. After losing Jean, Blake finishes writing a song that he thinks is his best ever, "[[The Weary Kind]]", and sells it to Tommy.  Sixteen months later, Tommy plays "The Weary Kind" to an appreciative audience while Blake watches backstage, as his manager presents him with another of the large royalty checks for the song. As Blake is leaving, Jean approaches him, saying she has come to the show as writer for a large music publication. As they catch up, Blake sees an engagement ring on Jean's finger and tells her that she deserves a good man. He offers her the money from that royalty check for Buddy to have for his 18th birthday, which Jean initially refuses but eventually accepts after Blake says the song would not exist without them. Jean asks if Blake would like to see Buddy again, but Blake declines saying it might be too unsettling for the boy. The film ends with Jean asking Blake for another interview, they walk away, happily, chatting with each other.

Crossing Over (film)
   After immigrant Mireya Sanchez is deported, [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] / [[Homeland Security Investigations]] Special Agent Max Brogan takes care of her little son and brings him to the boy's grandparents in [[Mexico]]. Later the woman is found dead near the border. Brogan returns to the grandparents to tell them the bad news.  Taslima Jahangir, a 15-year-old girl from [[Bangladesh]], presents a paper at school promoting that people should try to understand the [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|9/11 hijackers]]. The school principal reports this to authorities. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents raid the home and ransack the girl's room, reading her diaries and a school assignment on the ethics of suicide; they criticize her room as "too austere" and note that she has an account on an Islamic website. The profiler says this makes her look like a would-be [[Suicide attack|suicide bomber]]. Taslima is not charged for this, but it turns out that she stays in the United States illegally. She was born in Bangladesh and brought to the United States at age three. Taslima's continued presence jeopardizes her chances and puts at risk her two younger siblings, who are [[United States nationality law|US citizens]] because they were born in the country. Denise Frankel, the immigration defense attorney, suggests that instead of the whole family's being deported, Taslima can leave for Bangladesh with her mother while the rest of the family stays in the U.S.  Cole Frankel, an immigration examiner/officer, gets into a car accident with Claire Shepard, an aspiring actress from [[Australia]]. Realizing that she is in the country illegally, Cole makes an arrangement with Claire whereby she will have unlimited sex with him for two months in exchange for a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]]. When Cole eventually says he wants to leave his wife for Claire, she makes it clear that she holds him in contempt and is only sleeping with him for the green card. In a moment of clarity, Cole exempts Claire from completing the three months and arranges for her to get her green card in the mail. Special Agents from the ICE / Office of Inspector General eventually confront Claire about the suspiciousness in her immigration paperwork, and she admits to the sexual arrangement she had with Cole and leaves the country "voluntarily". Cole is arrested by ICE/OIG for corruption. His wife Denise Frankel adopts a little girl from [[Nigeria]], who has already been in the detention center for 23 months.  Brogan has a colleague, Hamid Baraheri. His family disapproves of his sister's having sex with Javier Pedroza, a married man. Encouraged by his father, Farid Baraheri (Hamid's brother) plans to scare the couple, but things get out of hand: he shoots both of them, and goes to Hamid, who helps him hide the evidence. Brogan slowly suspects Hamid's involvement as the film progresses.  Javier Pedroza worked in a copy shop and made extra money by providing counterfeit immigration papers. Claire had previously paid him for false papers before she had made her arrangement with Cole. But when Javier was killed, the authorities discovered her documents among his belongings, leading the immigration team to examine Claire's case more closely.  South Korean teenager Yong Kim is about to be naturalized with the rest of his family, but he has started to hang out with a bad crowd and ultimately participates in a convenience store robbery to "pop his cherry" with his gang. Hamid happens to be at the same convenience store and kills the other robbers but (due to his own guilt over his involvement in his sister's death) lets Yong Kim go free.  Gavin Kossef, Claire's boyfriend and an atheist Jewish musician from the United Kingdom, pretends to be a religious Jew in order to get a job at a Jewish school, which allows him to stay in the U.S. When reporting to an immigration office, the immigration examiner/officer makes him demonstrate his familiarity with the Jewish religion in front of a [[rabbi]] visiting for other purposes &ndash; Kossef chants poorly but the rabbi gives his approval. After the test, in private, the rabbi requires Kossef to bring his "wonderful" voice to temple and to take lessons from him to eliminate the deficiencies in his knowledge.  Brogan investigates Hamid's sister and sister's boyfriend's murders.  He finds proof of Farid's guilt in the murders and Hamid's guilt in the cover-up.  Disgusted by Hamid's and Farid's actions he turns the evidence over to the Los Angeles Police Department.  The LAPD arrests Farid for two counts of murder and Hamid as an accessory to two murders after the fact.

He begins challenging Rindaman regularly, but consistently fails to beat him. His situation escalates when he unwittingly breaks a non-aggression pact between Suzuran and a rival school, Housen Academy, by coming to the aid of Kawanishi Noboru ([[Shinnosuke Abe]]) during a heated confrontation. Genji learns that the agreement between the two schools was established two years prior when, during a skirmish, Noboru violated a [[Rules of engagement|gang law]] and used a weapon to fatally wound Housen's former leader, Bitō Makio. Suzuran had subsequently sworn not to interfere with Housen's retribution upon Noboru's release from prison. Genji's protection of Kawanishi provokes Housen's current leader, Narumi Taiga (Nobuaki Kaneko), to declare war against Suzuran.

The Cry of the Owl (2009 film)
 Robert Forrester is going through a painful divorce from his wife Nickie.  He begins spying on Jenny Thierolf, a girl living in the countryside, because to him she represents a state of harmony, a stark contrast to his own personal life.  Jenny catches him one night, but instead of being upset, she invites him in and they talk.  Jenny ends her relationship with her fiancé Greg, believing her chance meeting with Robert was an act of fate.  Jenny's friends, who are still sympathetic towards Greg, disapprove of her choice.  Jenny starts stalking Robert: She waits for him outside of his office, calls him late at night, and tries to sleep over at his house.  He resists her advances, and tells Jenny that he has received a promotion at work and will be moving away to [[Philadelphia]], making any relationship between them impossible.  Jenny offers to come with him to Philadelphia, but he declines.  Later, when Robert is driving home on a lonely country road, Greg stops his car and attacks him.  Though hurt by the younger and stronger Greg, Robert manages to knock Greg unconscious and into a river.  He drags Greg out of the river and leaves him on the bank.  Shortly thereafter, the police question Robert because Greg is missing.  He admits that they fought and that he left the unconscious Greg near the river.  The police speculate that Greg might be dead (though they have no body), either by accident or because Robert killed him.  When Robert's employer learns he is a police suspect, he loses the promotion in Philadelphia and is suspended.  Also, a colleague and former friend dissociates himself from Robert. He is attacked by Greg's father, who thinks Robert murdered his son.  Drifting and aimless, Robert continues his uneasy relationship with Jenny, who has become convinced that he may have a bad omen over him (represented by the owl of the title, which is a common symbol of coming death).  Jenny goes to visit Robert's ex-wife Nickie, who says she left him because he seemed like bad luck.  A corpse is found in the river, and although it is in such a bad state that it is almost unidentifiable, the police believe it to be Greg's.  Jenny then commits suicide, leaving a note that she and Robert had met after he stalked Jenny.  Robert is befriended by the widower who lives next door to him.  One night, Greg appears outside of the widower's house and fires a gun, seriously wounding the widower but only clipping Robert.  The police place Robert in protective custody, and Greg threatens him again. Soon after, Robert is informed that Greg has been picked up by the police, and that it was Nickie who paid Greg to pretend to be dead to get him in trouble.  When Robert drives to Jenny's house, he is met by Nickie and Greg. Nickie tries to persuade Robert to tell the police that she had nothing to do with setting him up, and warns him of an enraged and drunken Greg. Making matters worse, Greg's father calls to tell him that the widower he shot has died, making Greg a murderer. Greg attacks Robert with a knife; in the subsequent fight, Greg is knocked unconscious, but Nickie is fatally injured. Robert is again left as a suspect in an apparent crime scene. The final shot shows Robert looking out Jenny's window, reminiscent of his view on the house in the opening shots.

The Crypt (film)
 The movie begins with a sole grave robber in 1979, who steals his way into the crypt in order to find jewelry. He is killed by the undead after he finds some jewelry and is trying to get more. Decades later, a man is shown getting out of prison. His girlfriend picks him up at the prison gate with a car and takes him to a meeting place with some of her friends. There, one experienced thief, a lady, says that she knows how to make a whole lot of money quickly by getting jewelry from a crypt under the city and that she has connections able to sell the jewelry for them. She shows the others a gold ring from down below. She says that rich families during the Great Depression in the U.S. were afraid that the government would take the jewelry away from them, so they buried their riches in the crypts with the remains of their family members. At first the others are very unhappy about the idea of the scheme and are about to leave, but the ringleader manages to persuade them to go with her.  The group makes it into the crypt and the members fill their backpacks with diamond necklaces and other expensive jewelry from the concrete coffins, but one by one several of the members of the group are killed by the undead, who apparently are taking revenge for the people taking the jewelry. In the end, only the ringleader and the girlfriend of the one guy who was released from prison make it out of the crypt alive. Before they leave the crypt, they get rid of the jewelry, one of them saying that they would not get out of there alive with it.  Once back at her apartment, the ringleader finds a very expensive diamond studded piece of jewelry in her belongings that she remembers having put in her brassiere while first treasure hunting in the crypt. She shows her friend, but her friend is really angry about it and wants her to get rid of it apparently because she fears that the undead would come out of the crypt to kill them. The ringleader puts the piece of jewelry in her car and is later killed by the same undead individual who killed most of the other people. The remaining lady has a dream that her boyfriend, the one newly released from prison, is an undead and is angry at her for having left him down in the crypt. She goes back down into the crypt and sees that he is still alive. She dumps the jewelry that he has into the water, but he indicates that he is not sure that it is all of the jewelry that he has. Right after that, the undead kills the boyfriend by crushing his head. His girlfriend is shown in shock leaning up against the wall of the crypt. The movie ends.  
Curious George 2: Follow That Monkey!
  The movie starts with George swinging around town, and he picks up the newspaper. He reads it when he gets home and finds out that the great magician Piccadilly is holding an act with an elephant named Kayla. It sounds interesting to George so he wakes up Ted, and he tries to show Ted the news, but Ted is late for a meeting with Mr. Bloomsberry.  When Ted gets to the museum he prepares reasons as to why he would be a good candidate to take over the museum for Mr. Bloomsberry who is retiring. Mr. Bloomsberry however, says that Ted is the only candidate because he couldn't imagine leaving not even Junior (the main antagonist from the first film) to own the museum (he is now a cashier at a parking lot). The only stipulation is Ted has to write a presentation on what his vision of what the museum would look like; to be delivered in one week, to the Board of Directors. However, Ted is scared of the Board of Directors.  As Ted is in his office writing his charts, Maggie tells him that his loved needs more attention: her, George, etc. George comes in and tries to show Ted the poster with Kayla (indicating Piccadilly's act). Ted says he understands what Maggie is saying and decided to take George to the magic show. During one of Piccadilly's magic tricks, Kayla disappears, and George goes looking for her. He finds Kayla in the basement of the theatre, starts playing with her and they stumble upon the exit for the building.   Piccadilly comes in and can't find Kayla so he calls for security, the head of which is Danno Wolfe, who is assisted by Mrs. Fisher. Danno questions Ted and gets suspicious about him and George. Meanwhile, George and Kayla make their way to Ted's apartment where they see news coverage of Kayla's original home in California with her brother Tonga and her sister Layla.  Ted returns home to find George and Kayla in their apartment. He decides to return to the theatre with George and Kayla but along the way loses them when George sees a train advertisement for the "California Express". Ted reaches them at the train, but can't get them out of the boxcar before it leaves the station. They are headed west and Ted gets nervous when the train doesn't even stop in St. Louis and his cell phone's battery has died. Meanwhile, a cryptic message from a monkey Danno thinks speaks Chinese leads him to believe that George and Ted have kidnapped the elephant. He begins attempting to find them.  Back on the train, George opens the door of the boxcar but Ted falls out while trying to catch the wind-blown pages of his presentation. Ted makes his way to a small train station with a stationmaster who offers to charge the cell phone (which broke when he fell). Ted uses what little change he has to call Piccadilly, but doesn't manage to complete the call which makes Danno even more certain that Ted and George have kidnapped Kayla. Ted uses the stationmaster's motorcycle to catch up with George and Kayla and reboards the train. He leaves his cell phone in Humbleton with the stationmaster who tries to use the phone to tell Piccadilly that Kayla is okay but the phone breaks. Mrs. Fisher traced the call which allowed Danno to find his way the Humbleton station.  Ted, George, and Kayla continue on the train for the next stop in Grand Junction with Danno on their heels. The movement of Kayla, however, causes the boxcar to separate from the rest of the train, and they head away from the rest of the train. It finally stops, and they get off in search of a road to find help. A man in a flatbed truck stops and picks them up. Ted thinks they are going east, but they continue to travel west once again. Meanwhile, Piccadilly is interviewed by Hark Hanson, and he reveals pictures of George and Ted as the kidnappers of Kayla. Ted wakes up after a night's sleep in the back of the truck and realizes they have been heading the wrong way. He gets them off the truck and attempts to head back east again.  They come across a farmer named Dan and his child named Anna, with whom they spend the night. The next morning, Ted picks up the newspaper and finds out New York thinks they're kidnappers. He also reads about Kayla's family. Ted wants to return Kayla to Piccadilly, but George and Anna disagree. Ted changes his mind the next morning but before they leave for Kayla's home, Danno shows up in a helicopter. After the pig throws Danno into a rain barrel, Kayla scares the pilot into flying away.   While they are thus distracted, George and company escape using a hollowed out school bus and finally make their way to the park where Tango and Layla are happy to see her. Danno shows up again and arrests George and Ted and captures Kayla. They fly back to the city, but after George gets the handcuff keys from Danno, they all escape by jumping out of the plane. They make it back to Piccadilly and everything is fine, except that Danno has followed them once again. Kayla subdues him and throws him onto the stage's trapdoor which Piccadilly opens, dropping Danno onto the mattress below.  George and Maggie watch Ted give his report to the Board of Directors. He is initially flustered because the past week's adventures prevented him from preparing his presentation. Once George comes in the room, Ted improvises a speech saying that friends are more important than work and proposes several ideas for the museum based on that idea (Father/Son Day for example). The Board is impressed and approves his appointment.

The Cycle (2009 film)
 A young woman named Amy ([[Leah Gibson]]) is fleeing a masked, black-clad man wielding a machete (Twan Holliday). A female driver named Carrie ([[Daryl Hannah]]) is pressured to stay the night at a local motel by Jimmy (also Holliday), but refuses. She drives on and nearly hits Amy, who persuades Carrie to take her to the next town. Amy tells Carrie her story.  She and four [[Boston University]] students came to the area to look for a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] burial ground in [[Bradford, Pennsylvania]]. The area was due to become a mine and their professor had promised them a pass grade if they found evidence of the burial ground. En route to the town, they stop to get gas and all but Amy end up mocking the gas station's owner Billy (Daniel Probert) for his [[hillbilly]] appearance, speech and lack of hands. This prompts him to warn Amy not to go up to the burial ground, which he calls the "Devil's Playground".  The group ignores Billy's warnings and continue to the site of the burial ground. Their dig is met with almost immediate setbacks when their [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] is shaken during the night and their tools are stolen. They find evidence of the ancient burial ground and other evidence that suggests that a [[serial killer]] has been using the area to bury his victims. The group is unable to call the police because they are each killed off by the masked man. Only Amy manages to survive, runs to the gas station run by Billy and pleads with him for help. He calls the killer--his developmentally-disabled brother, Tobey. Amy then learns that the birth defects of Billy and Tobey were the result of chemicals released during a mining accident in 1967 and that the two brothers kill because of their bitterness towards the world. She is nearly raped and killed, which is when she flees and encounters Carrie.  Carrie explains that she is driving the same route that her partner took before disappearing. They stop at a gas station for fuel and for Carrie to call the police, but they do not believe her story, telling her that Amy Singer died five years ago. At this point, Jimmy re-appears and explains that Amy is a ghost and that each year she appears on the same stretch of road on which she died. Jimmy also explains that the gas station they are now at is the same one (albeit rebuilt) that was previously owned by Billy, who has since died. Tobey now arrives and Jimmy intervenes to save Carrie, but is shot and killed by the young gas station attendant, who turns out to be Billy's son. The film ends with Tobey swinging his machete down on Carrie.  
The Damned United
 After failing to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], England manager [[Alf Ramsey]] is replaced by [[Don Revie]] ([[Colm Meaney]]), the highly successful manager of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Revie's replacement at Leeds is [[Brian Clough]] ([[Michael Sheen]]), the former manager of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and a fierce critic of Leeds because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] ([[Timothy Spall]]), has not joined him.  The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a [[1967–68 FA Cup|1968 FA Cup]] match between Leeds, the leaders of the [[1967–68 Football League|First Division]]<ref>Though Leeds were leading the table, they did not win the league that season, eventually finishing fourth. The eventual winners were [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]</ref> and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of [[Middlesbrough]] and both played for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match, however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the [[Baseball Ground]]. Derby eventually lost 2&ndash;0.<ref>Although Leeds did beat Derby 2&ndash;0 in the [[FA Cup]] that season, in reality the game was played at United's [[Elland Road]] ground. It was the second of three games between the two sides that season, the FA Cup tie being sandwiched between the two legs of a [[Football League Cup]] semifinal.</ref> Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran [[Dave Mackay (footballer born 1934)|Dave Mackay]] ([[Brian McCardie]]), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson ([[Jim Broadbent]]) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted, but in their first league game against Leeds they lose 5&ndash;0. The club win their first ever [[1971–72 Football League|League championship]] in 1972, meaning a [[European Cup]] campaign the following year. They go through to the [[1972–73 European Cup#Semi-finals|semi-finals]] against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semifinal, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and [[Billy Bremner]] ([[Stephen Graham]]) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semifinal. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.<ref>In fact, the match between Derby and Leeds took place before Derby's ''quarter-final'' match, which they won despite their injury list. Their eventual defeat by Juventus was with a nearly full-strength squad, and Clough blamed Juventus's gamesmanship, rather than Sam Longson for Derby's exit.</ref>  Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to secure his position by offering his and Taylor's resignations in a protest against the chairman's unwillingness to fund further signings. He is outraged when the directors accept their resignations and ban them from entering the Baseball Ground again (although Clough later sneaks in as a supporter). Derby fans' protests raise Clough's hopes of being reinstated, and he is backed by the majority of his players as well, but former player Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead. Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back. He and Taylor are then offered jobs at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in [[Majorca]]. During the holiday that summer, Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representative.<ref>The film shows him effectively reneging on his deal to take over at Brighton, although in reality he had nine relatively unsuccessful months as manager there.</ref> Taylor, however, argues the case for staying at Brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways.  Back in the storyline's "present”: Clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they "never won any of them fairly", and then making them start with a 7-a-side game, which Bremner points out Revie never made them do. Clough reminds them that he is not Revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager's name or methods again.  The season starts with a [[1974 FA Charity Shield|Charity Shield]] match against FA Cup winners [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at Wembley, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager [[Bill Shankly]] and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds's captain Billy Bremner gets into a fight with [[Kevin Keegan]]. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the [[1974–75 Football League|season]] and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with [[Yorkshire Television]], but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being 'cold-hearted' and 'fundamentally dishonest', both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as 'inflexible and egocentric'. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). After the interview, Clough drives down to [[Brighton]] to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, and they are reconciled.  In the film's epilogue, the audience is told that Don Revie "failed as England manager", and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the [[Middle East]], where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, meanwhile, reunited at the "small, provincial club" [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], where they repeated their prior achievements with Derby by getting them promoted to the First Division and then winning the title. They went on to better both Revie and their own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession, in 1979 and 1980. The film ends with the caption: "Brian Clough remains the greatest manager the England team never had."

During a fight, he defeats his opponent, but forfeits the match when he realizes that it is to the death. This results in Reno losing his wager and being roughed up by the syndicate. The next day, John is picked up by a tycoon named Veltz (William B. Davis), who turns out to be the owner of his former job. As a token of gratitude for saving his son-in-law's life from a heart attack, Veltz offers to cover John's US$150,000 wager for the main event or to clear Reno's debt. John chooses to clear Reno's debt.  The next night, John faces and defeats the defending champion Wendell Timmons (Tony Bailey). It is revealed that the Deacon (Donnelly Rhodes), a friend of Reno, covered his stake in the fight. In the end, John covers the payment for Sarah's heart transplant while Reno offers him another deal.

The Damned Rain
 The plot of the movie is based on simple aspirations, the undying urge in the human race to live and to live against all odds.The film is about the life of a farmer Kisna ([[Girish Kulkarni]]), who is trying to get a good crop in the drought-stricken [[Vidarbha]] region, which has been notorious for farmer suicides. It also allegorically tells about how lack of information and education amongst the farmers, can ruin them, despite their indefatigable spirit.  After, the debt-ridden neighbour Bhaskar Deshmukh commits suicide, amongst many other farmers of the region, Kisna's wife Alka (Sonali Kulkarni) observes Kisna's aloofness and interprets that Kisna is contemplating suicide too. She asks their 6-year-old son Dinu (Aman Attar) to keep a watch on Kisna, and report any irregular behavior. Kisna is however imbued by the thoughts of the arrival of the [[Monsoon]].  During these days, Alka tries her best by preparing [[Puran Poli]] amongst other myriad efforts to keep Kisna in good spirit. However, Kisna being inherently stronger than his peer farmers, albeit aloof, is often annoyed by the overt and misplaced concern of his wife.  Pawning jewelry, Kisna purchases cotton seeds from [[Nagpur]] City, intending to sow them when the rains arrive. The seeds fail to germinate, due to the late arrival of the monsoons and this is the only time in the entire movie Kisna contemplates suicide, by consuming pesticide. However, Alka sells other jewelry and purchases a fresh set of seeds, which are sowed. Due to the vagaries of the rain, Kisna is able to reap only two quintals of cotton, which is taken away by the money-lender/cotton trader, leaving Kisna's family with nothing.  Meanwhile, Kisna, with his indefatigable spirit, goes to a bank in the city, takes a loan and installs a bore-well in his farm, despite the perpetual pessimism of Patil. The bore-well itself doesn't work to its potential due to the erratic power supply, typical of the hinterlands of [[Vidarbha]]. At this stage, Patil gives Kisna the idea of drawing electric power from the [[Electric power transmission]] lines.  Kisna never gives up even till the end, where ill-advised, he naively tries to tap electric power from the high voltage [[Electric power transmission]] lines to power his water pump of the recently installed bore-well and loses his life by electrocution.

Daddy Longlegs (2009 film)
  Lenny, a divorced father and a [[projectionist]] at a [[Manhattan]] movie theater, gets custody of his sons Sage and Frey for two weeks of the year. During these two weeks he encourages a playful attitude in the boys while largely acting irresponsibly. Lenny behaves obnoxiously and argues openly with other adults—including their school principal and a homeless panhandling veteran—in front of his sons, often involving them in the conversations as he enjoys setting up various improvised "games" with them. Lenny is aided in caring for the boys by his similarly irresponsible on-and-off girlfriend Leni. Early in the two weeks, Leni brings the boys a gift of a salamander, which is promptly forgotten about and starves to death.  On his first weekend with the boys, Lenny goes out drinking and hooks up with a girl named Roberta. Learning that Roberta is about to travel upstate the next morning with her boyfriend, Lenny impulsively decides to accompany them, bringing his sons along as well. Back home, they are visited by Lenny's European friend Salvi, who is hard to understand and plays a dangerous game where he stands on the boys' stomachs. Lenny has a scheduling mixup at his job, working a shift when he was supposed to pick the kids up from school. He solves this problem by changing a reel then running on foot to the school and keeping the kids at the theater with him. There, they draw a comic about Lenny peeing in his boss's water cup and print 999 copies.  In order to make time for a date with Leni, Lenny hires his neighbor Jake to watch the kids for a night. The date ends badly when Leni decides to walk along the subway rails and Lenny refuses to join her. Meanwhile, Sage and Frey insert pee into a toy firetruck and shoot it at Jake, who tells Lenny he will no longer watch his kids when he gets back. Leni returns to Lenny's apartment to make up with him just as he gets a call from his boss, who needs him to work overnight and threatens to fire him for the incident with the printer. Lenny does not want the kids to wake up alone in the morning, and since Leni is unable to stay overnight he instead decides to drug them with smaller doses of a sleeping pill he uses. This causes Sage and Frey to sleep through the day and remain unresponsive into the next night. Lenny has a doctor friend diagnose them, learning that they will be unconscious for the next two days minimum.  While Sage and Frey remain unconscious, Lenny steers clear of the apartment as it is now a stressful environment for him. He stays overnight at Leni's apartment but leaves a spare key where it is easily found by a nosy neighbor the next morning. After this Leni cuts contact with Lenny. The next night, he meets up with some other friends, but gets all of them arrested by indiscreetly spray painting on a wall. After Lenny returns home from jail, Sage and Frey finally wake up. Lenny takes them to a park, then a museum where they see a large-scale model of a mosquito and he jokes about having killed a giant mosquito in his apartment. Later that night, the boys are frightened by the prospect of a giant mosquito and can't sleep, even though Lenny insists it's not real.  The next day, the boys return to their mother's custody. Lenny, now alone, grows increasingly discontent, throwing public temper tantrums around his friends and repeatedly calling Leni, who does not pick up. After having a surreal nightmare about the giant mosquito, Lenny abducts his sons from school, convincing their nanny that there was a scheduling mix-up.

Upon returning they find all the furniture in the apartment packed up, and Lenny reveals they are moving, though the circumstances are left unclear.

Dark Country
 Newly weds Dick ([[Thomas Jane]]) and Gina ([[Lauren German]]) decide to head across the Nevada desert for their honeymoon, driving at night to beat the heat. Before they head off, a stranger warns Dick to be careful, as couples have been known to get lost, and to stick to the Interstate. Shortly afterward, the couple realize they are heading the wrong way and turn off the highway onto another road. Dick turns off the car headlights to drive by starlight and Gina masturbates herself to orgasm as they head across the desert. Eventually Dick turns the lights back on, immediately swerving to avoid a figure in the middle of the road. Investigating, they find a man severely injured from a car accident. Unable to get a phone signal, they decide to drive him to a hospital themselves, only for the road to come to a sudden end a few miles ahead.  During the drive, the couple argue and the injured man awakens with a scream. He asks Gina for a cigarette, advises her to leave her husband and becomes increasingly erratic, finally attempting to strangle Dick and almost causing the car to crash. Gina stops the car and the two men tumble out, continuing to fight until Dick beats the stranger to death with a rock. Dick convinces his wife they need to dispose of the body, and together they bury it in a shallow grave. While she fills the hole, Dick finds a revolver in her handbag. Soon after, they arrive at a rest area where several cars are parked. They tidy themselves up and argue until Dick discovers he lost his watch while they were burying the stranger. Refusing to go back, Gina waits at the rest stop with the gun while Dick returns to find his watch. Arriving at the site where they hid the body, Dick finds the grave empty. Gunshots ring out across the desert and Dick races back to the rest stop to find Gina is missing. Nearby, he stumbles onto a woman's grave and realizes that the other cars are rusted and covered with dust.  In a panic, he flees, almost colliding head-on with a deputy sheriff ([[Ron Perlman]]). In the back of the police car, he rides with the deputy to a crime scene, where police are excavating murder victims from a mass grave surrounded by abandoned vehicles. The deputy explains that this was where the rest area had been 30 years before. Dick recognizes the spot as the location where he buried the stranger. As he watches on from the back of the police car, a deputy exhumes Gina's body and finds Dick's watch. Dick kicks his way out of the patrol car and escapes in one of the nearby vehicles, leading the squad of police in a chase across the desert.  Driving with the lights off, he loses them, but a short while later he finds a swarm of insects, losing control and rolling the car. Thrown clear of the wreck, he is then almost run down by another car before he passes out. Some time later, Dick wakes to find himself in the back of his own car, listening to himself and Gina argue, and realizes that he was the mysterious stranger that he fought with and murdered earlier in the evening, screaming at this.  
Darfur (film)
 The plot of ''Darfur'' revolves around six Western journalists who visit a small village in Darfur in western Sudan under the escort of a squad of troops of the [[African Union]] peacekeeping mission. When they learn the brutal state sponsored militia called the [[Janjaweed]] are heading towards the village, they are faced with an impossible decision: leave Sudan and report the atrocities to the world, or risk their own lives and stay in the hopes of averting a certain slaughter.  While most of them flee back to their base, two of the journalists, Freddie Smith, and Theo Schwartz, decide to stay behind along with the Nigerian commander of the AU unit, Captain Jack Tobamke, to try to save the villagers when the [[Arab]] Janjaweed enter the village and begin to indiscriminally kill all the [[Black Africans|Black African]] men, women, and children. Despite their efforts to save some villagers, Captain Tobamke, Theo, and Freddie are all killed one by one in the subsequent shootout with the Janjaweed, but not after killing or wounding a few dozen of the savage militia. The surviving Janjaweed then burn the village to the ground and move on, presumably to continue their genocide rampage across the Darfur landscape.  The final scene shows the female member of the journalist team, Malin Lausberg, who had fled with most of the other reporters and AU soldiers during the Janjaweed attack, now return to the destroyed village the next day with a group of AU soldiers only to find everyone dead, including two of her colleagues. But she finds an infant that Freddie protected by hiding under Theo's dead body as the sole survivor of the massacre. Malin takes the baby with her as she and the rest of the AU troops leave the destroyed village behind.  
A Dangerous Man
  In Arizona, ex-Special Forces soldier Shane Daniels ([[Steven Seagal]]) saves his wife, Holly ([[Aidan Dee]]), from a car jacking and chases the mugger ([[Clay Virtue]]) away. The mugger later ends up dead, and Shane is the sole suspect. After being locked up for six years, Shane is released from jail due to new DNA evidence, which clears his name. Shane is released with an apology from the State of Arizona and a $300,000 settlement, but feels that it does not make up for his wasted life and the loss of his wife, who has left him, which leaves him bitter.  Off the coast of Seattle, Washington, a ship full of smuggled Chinese people is arriving. After it arrives, an old Chinese man is taken to a safehouse. Back in Arizona, within hours of being released to the streets, Shane stops at a liquor store and buys a bottle of bourbon. Back outside, two men attempt to rob Shane, but he beats up his two attackers and steals their car. Leaving the city, Shane takes to the road and stops at a rest stop along a lonely stretch of highway. There, he witnesses a state trooper pulling over a car containing two Chinese nationals. The Chinese nationals kill the state trooper and try to kill a couple of witnesses, a young man named Sergey ([[Jesse Hutch]]) and his friend Markov ([[Robin Nielsen]]). Shane is forced to intervene, kills one of the attackers and sends the other one, Mao ([[Byron Lawson]]), running off into the desert, but Markov is killed by one of the Chinese men. When Shane checks on the dead cop, he hears noise coming from the trunk of the Chinese national’s car. Inside, he finds an unconscious woman and a duffel bag full of cash. Fearing that the cops will implicate him in the death of the trooper and knowing that the Chinese national will return with back-up, Shane takes the girl, the cash, and Sergey into the nearest small town, which is called Bellingham. Sergey admits that his father, Vlad ([[Vitaly Kravchenko]]), sells stolen cars.  When the woman, Tia ([[Marlaina Mah]]), regains consciousness, she begs Shane and Sergey not to turn her over to the cops or the Chinese. Tia tells Shane and Sergey that the cops in Bellingham killed her friends when she was kidnapped. The next morning, Shane has Sergey drop him and Tia off at a motel. Shane moves to a different hotel, for safety. In the second motel room, Tia explains to Shane that she was trying to get her uncle Kuan ([[Vincent Cheng]]) into the USA. She was contacted by someone who said they could help. She was told to show up alone at an abandoned mill in a remote place about 50 miles away from Bellingham, but she insisted on bringing some of her friends since it was the first time she and her contact were meeting. The man she met is a Chinese drug smuggler named Chen ([[Terry Chen]]) who told her he would help smuggle Kuan into the USA. However, Chen had her friends shot by Bellingham cops, and she was then forced into a room where another man was waiting. The man, known as the Colonel ([[Byron Mann]]), said he was waiting for Kuan's arrival, and that Tia was going to be held for ransom until the man got the information he needed from Kuan.  Sgt. Ritchie ([[Jerry Wasserman]]) and his henchman Clark ([[Mike Dopud]]), the two Bellingham cops who are working for Chen, go to Little Russia, Vlad's restaurant, and ask Vlad if he knows where Shane is, but Vlad turns them away, even threatening to cut Ritchie's testicles off. Meanwhile, two Chinese men break into the motel room where Shane and Tia are staying, but Shane kills them, and he and Tia escape. Outside Little Russia, Tia tells Shane that Kuan will be arriving before the day is out, and she's worried about what will happen to him. Inside, the bartender is not willing to tell Shane where Vlad and Sergey are, so Shane is forced to beat him up, and demand that he take him to Vlad. They arrive at Vlad's house, he is grateful that Shane saved Sergey's life and agrees to help Shane and Tia. Ritchie, Clark, and some Chinese men arrive at Vlad's house and a firefight takes place. After finishing off the last of Chen's men, Shane, Tia, Sergey, and Vlad leave to try to rescue Kuan from the Colonel.  At the abandoned mill, the Colonel has taken over the place, having his men plant bombs all over the site and kill all of Chen's men except for Chen. He's keeping Chen alive until Chen's men arrive with Kuan. When he finally arrives, the Colonel's men kill Kuan's two escorts. Gunfire erupts between the Colonel's men and Shane's group. In the midst of the gunfire, Tia gets shot. Shane covers the wound, and tells Sergey to watch over her. Shane returns to fighting the Colonel's men, and Sergey lifts Tia up and starts carrying her to safety. Shane battles his way to the Colonel, who has Kuan as a hostage.  Shane and the Colonel open fire on each other, and they both run out of bullets. Shane brutally beats the Colonel up, and then gets Kuan out of there. The Colonel grabs a submachine gun, and leaves the room. Just as the Colonel is about to shoot Shane, Shane flips the switch and the bombs start detonating, and the Colonel is blown off of the catwalk he was on.  Vlad later makes sure Kuan can stay in the USA. Shane and Tia, having fallen for each other, set up home together in an isolated glacier-side mansion somewhere outside the USA.  
Dark and Stormy Night
 On a dark and stormy night in the 1930s, a number of people gather at an isolated country estate to hear the reading of the will of the wealthy Sinas Cavinder, including: wealthy nephew Burling Famish Jr. (Brian Howe) and his wife Pristy (Christine Romeo); Pristy's dim-witted lover Teak Armbruster (Kevin Quinn); big-game hunter Jack Tugdon (Jim Beaver); the foppish Lord Partfine (Andrew Parks); elderly Mrs. Hausenstout (Betty Garrett); kindly Seyton Ethelquake (James Karen); and the fragile Sabasha Fanmoore (Fay Masterson), Cavinder's ward.  They are joined by rival reporters Eight O'Clock Faraday (Daniel Roebuck) and Billy Tuesday (Jennifer Blaire) along with cab driver Happy Codburn (Dan Conroy), to whom Faraday owes "toity-five cents" (not including tip). The party grows by two when psychic Mrs. Cupcupboard (Allison Martin) and "stranded motorist" Ray Vestinhaus (Larry Blamire) arrive unexpectedly.  The large group gathers in the home's parlor so that lawyer Farper Twyly (Mark Redfield) can read the will. Before Twyly begins, the guests note the unusual threats surrounding the estate: Sabasha has been the subject of mysterious death threats; a [[serial killer]] known as the "Cavinder Strangler" is still at large and in the area; and it happens to be the same night on which the 300-year-old ghost of Sarah Cavinder is supposed to return.  Twyly reads the will, revealing that some characters receive trivial gifts and other substantial ones. The bulk of the estate is given to Sabasha, but with the clause that upon her death the estate would then be given to Burling. Twyly then reveals the existence of an additional letter that amends the will; he discovers that it has been stolen, but assures the group that he and only he knows the contents. Before he can recite the letter, the lights are turned off. When they are turned back on, the group discovers that Twyly has been stabbed to death.  When Ray tells the group that the only bridge back to town collapsed behind him, Faraday and Tuesday suggest that they all wait until morning for the police to arrive. However, at the stroke of midnight, Pristy is strangled by a masked killer. Dr. Van Von Vandervon (H.M. Wynant) arrives and announces that he's tracked an escaped lunatic to the house, but because of the nature of his work (in which the therapist and patient never see each other), he is not sure what the patient looks like, or even if it's a man or woman.  Over the course of the evening, the group attempts to find both the letter and clues leading to the killer. A seance is held by Mrs. Cupcupboard, but the spirit ([[Marvin Kaplan]]) is of no help. Mrs. Hausenstout occasionally pops up with a gorilla (Bob Burns) in tow, and a police inspector (Tom Reese) arrives—and is promptly killed. As the night progresses, Jack, Teak, Seyton and Dr. Von Vandervon are murdered, as is Archie the cook (Robert Deveau). Happy discovers a woman (Susan McConnell) locked in an attic room. Although the group assumes she is the ghost of Sarah Cavinder, the housemaid Jane (Trish Geiger) tells them that she is Thessaly, the confrontational and slightly insane daughter of Sinas Cavinder. Jane also knows the contents of the letter and tells Faraday and Tuesday that the letter makes Thessaly, not Sabasha, the inheritor of the estate.  Faraday and Tuesday track down and confront the guilty parties—Burling and Sabasha, who began the night working independently but who later "joined forces" to knock off their rivals to the inheritance. Faraday and Tuesday also deduce that the real Sabasha is dead and that the woman pretending to be her is actually Dr. Von Vandervon's escaped lunatic.  Burling threatens to blow up the house unless Faraday and Tuesday turn over the letter, but he is accidentally electrocuted after being confronted by Thessaly. Ray appears and admits that he is actually Bax Tremblay, a police investigator working undercover. He, Faraday, and Tuesday attempt to apprehend the false Sabasha, but she strangles herself to death to avoid capture.  The next morning, Thessaly takes possession of the estate. Faraday proposes marriage to Tuesday and she accepts; the two of them agree to share their newspaper "scoop."  They are driven away by Happy, who belatedly realizes that because he left the cab's meter running all night, Faraday owes him $87.42.  
The Dancer and the Thief
 With the arrival of [[Chilean transition to democracy|democracy in Chile]] following the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|1988 national plebiscite]], the president of Chile declares a general amnesty for all prisoners convicted of non-violent crimes.  Among these former prisoners is the young Ángel Santiago ([[Abel Ayala]]) and the veteran Vergara Grey ([[Ricardo Darín]]), a famous thief. The two have different plans: while Vergara Grey only wishes to regain his family and turn over a new leaf, Ángel dreams of avenging the prison warden and undertaking a grand heist with Grey. But then Ángel meets the young Victoria ([[Miranda Bodenhöfer]]), a ballet dancer who has not spoken a word since she lost her parents as a small child during the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973-90)|Chilean dictatorship]].  The lives of all three are changed irrevocably as they are faced with a new future.   Director Fernando Trueba has said of the film: “I am proud of how I have portrayed [Santiago], I believe it is very interesting visually. This is above all a romantic film, but with elements of comedy and film noir. It’s film-noir and it is western, it’s realist and very romantic. Definitively Latin American.”<ref>[http://www.latercera.com/noticia/entretencion/cine/2009/07/726-150636-9-trueba-estoy-orgulloso-de-como-he-retratado-santiago.shtml Fernando Trueba: "Estoy orgulloso de cómo he retratado Santiago"] latercera.com por Marisol García - March 07, 2009 - retrieved on April 18, 2015</ref>

Dark Planet (film)
  === Part I ===  Year 2157. [[Maxim Kammerer]] (Stepanov), a space explorer from Earth, [[crash landing|crash lands]] on an unknown planet. His ship is destroyed, and now he's stuck there "like [[Robinson Crusoe|Robinson]] on an uninhabited island" (hence the title). Maxim encounters local military police, who don't believe Maxim is alien and send him to mental hospital in the capital. Guy Gaal (Fyodorov), a corporal of the Guards, is assigned to escort Maxim.  Maxim learns that the name of the planet is [[Saraksh]], and the country where he landed is called Fatherland, because it's ruled by a [[militaristic]] [[dictatorship]] of the ''Unknown Fathers''. Strider (Serebryakov), a powerful figure in the government, wants to see the newcomer; he sends one of his men, Funk, after Maxim, but as they drive the street, Funk suffers from what seems to be a surge of epilepsy, and Maxim is left alone. He encounters Rada Gaal (Snigir), a sister of Guy, falls in love with her and stays with the Gaals. Guy talks Maxim into becoming a privateer ("candidate") in the Guards. They are forced to participate in brutal raids against the people called "degenerates" by state propaganda. After Maxim refuses to execute a group of captured "degenerates", Guards commander Rittmeister Chachu shoots him and leaves him to his apparent death.  However, Maxim survives and joins a group of rebel "degenerates". During his time with the rebels, Maxim learns the true nature of the regime and the purpose of towers erected across the country. Contrary to state propaganda, the towers function as [[mind control]] devices, sending a special kind of radiation that ensures the citizens' loyalty to the regime. Twice in a day, the majority of people experience a patriotic frenzy, while minority, the "degenerates", are able to resist brainwashing, but they suffer from intense pain and convulsions. Unknown Fathers themselves are known to be "degenerates" (this is highlighted by Funk's "epilepsy" earlier). Maxim realises that rebels are hiding the truth just as the government does, in hope that they might use the towers themselves, had they come to power.  After fighting alongside the "degenerates" in the attack on a tower, Maxim is again captured by the military and sentenced to a prison labor camp. There, inmates are tasked with cleaning the wilderness of automated defense systems that were left abandoned by decades of war. On a mission, Maxim manages to capture a mechanized tank. He drives the tank away from detention zone across the minefield, picks up Guy, and heads south to the neighbouring nations.  === Part II ===  The second part is named ''Rebellion'' (). it starts with a brief description of the first part plot.  Maxim reveals the true purpose of the towers to Guy, who does not believe at first but is convinced when his enthusiasm fades as they get farther from the towers. They arrive in a city ruined by atomic bombing and inhabited by mutants. Maxim tries to convince mutants to start a rebellion against Unknown Fathers, but, being too weak, they refuse. Maxim then decides to seek help from another powerful country on Saraksh, the Islands Empire. Mutants give Maxim a bomber airship to fly for the Empire.  As Guy and Maxim travel the airship, Guy is again hit by the towers' radiation. He starts hysterically screaming of his loyalty to Maxim and hugging him. To stop it, Maxim collides the airship into the Tower and destroys it. After crash-landing at the shore, Maxim and Guy discover an abandoned Imperial White Submarine. There, they find evidence that Islands Empire is even worse mass-murdering fascist regime which wouldn't help their goals.  Meanwhile, the Unknown Fathers are planning an invasion of the neighbouring country of Khonti. As soon as Maxim and Guy return to Fatherland, they are captured and sent to war along with fellow prisoners, where Guy is killed in a battle. Funk, following Strider's orders, finds Maxim and takes him out of the war back to the capital. Fatherland is defeated, and the State prosecutor, who was an active supporter of the war, realizes that the Unknown Fathers will execute him for failure. He contacts Maxim and reveals the location of the Tower Control Center, urging him to use it for a coup d'état. Maxim sneaks in, but instead of following the prosecutor's plan, he blasts the Center with explosives.  As he exits the Center, he's confronted by angry Strider. He berates and beats Maxim and reveals himself as undercover spy from Earth. Maxim, a well-intentioned amateur, ruined the plan to save Fatherland and the rest of the planet that Strider has been preparing for decades. Strider tells Maxim to fly home to Earth. Maxim refuses and offers his help on one condition: another brainwashing center can never be built. After a fight and a heated argument, Strider reluctantly agrees. The final sequence shows rebels overthrowing the Unknown Fathers.

Daybreakers
 In 2019, a plague has transformed most of the world's population into vampires. The human population has plummeted and the need for blood becomes desperate. Vampires deprived of blood for long durations degenerate into "subsiders," psychotic bat-like creatures with no memories of who they were and whose only thought is the craving for blood. The few remaining humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists research a synthetic [[Blood substitutes|blood substitute]].  Edward Dalton ([[Ethan Hawke]]) is the head [[Hematology|hematologist]] for the largest supplier of human blood in the US, owned by Charles Bromley ([[Sam Neill]]). Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso ([[Vince Colosimo]]) are developing a blood substitute.   Driving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another vehicle off the road. Checking on the occupants of the other vehicle, he learns they are humans. With the police approaching, Dalton has them hide in his vehicle. They part ways, but not before their leader, Audrey ([[Claudia Karvan]]), learns Edward's name and occupation from the ID badge on his jacket.  At home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie ([[Michael Dorman]]). Frankie's gift of a bottle of pure human blood re-ignites a long-standing argument over Edward's sympathies towards humans. The argument is cut short when a subsider invades Edward's house, forcing the brothers to kill it.  The next morning, Audrey visits Edward's home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, Edward is introduced to Lionel "Elvis" Cormac ([[Willem Dafoe]]), a human who was once a vampire.  Before he can say how he reverted to human, a military team arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey.  Audrey manages to knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac explains that he was cured of vampirism when he was ejected from his sun-proof vehicle by a crash.  Exposed to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, but his life was saved when he landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure.  That night Edward meets more human survivors, as well as Senator Turner ([[Jay Laga'aia]]), a vampire who is secretly helping the colony develop a cure. A convoy of humans heading to Audrey's group is ambushed and captured. The soldiers  track the position of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee. Audrey, Cormac and Edward stay behind so Edward can be cured. Edward is able to recreate the cure Elvis had explained, curing himself of vampirism. They attempt to regroup with Turner and the other humans, only to find they are all dead.  One of the captured convoy, Alison ([[Isabel Lucas]]), is revealed to be Charles' human daughter. Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire. She refuses to drink human blood, and turns into a subsider. She is rounded up with others and dragged into sunlight to burn to death. Witnessing Alison's death upsets Frankie, causing him to seek out his brother. Meanwhile the military imposes [[martial law]] to control the subsider population and preserve order.  Edward, Cormac and Audrey break into Christopher's home and ask him to help spread the cure. However, Christopher has finally discovered a viable blood substitute and is not interested in a cure. He summons soldiers who capture Audrey while Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human again; revealing that the risky sunlight cure is unnecessary.  Edward, trying to save Audrey, turns himself in to Charles, who gloats about his new monopoly of the blood substitute.  Edward taunts Charles into biting him, making him human again like Frankie.  Edward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers who are on the brink of becoming subsiders.  Frankie arrives and, surrounded by soldiers, draws their attention to himself to allow Edward and Audrey to escape; a feeding frenzy results, as the hungry soldiers consume first Frankie's blood and then that of the soldiers cured by it, until at last only (what at first appears to be three) six soldiers are left standing, cured and bewildered.  Christopher, to cover up the cure, shoots the six and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac kills him with a crossbow.  The three survivors drive off into the sunrise.  In a voice-over, Edward addresses the general population, announcing the cure, but may be too late as multiple subsiders appear before the screen turns black.

He outfits them with color-coordinated [[Palm Treo|smartphone]]s and treats them to luxurious accommodations – teaching them, as [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Roxy Harvey|Roxy]] ([[Jasmine Guy]]) puts it later, that "nothing we do here matters". This tutelage leads the reapers to perform such misdeeds as saving those they were to Reap (Roxy), abusing immortality for financial gain ([[List of Dead Like Me characters#Mason|Mason]], played by [[Callum Blue]]), letting a soul wander, instead of showing him "his lights" ([[List of Dead Like Me characters#Daisy Adair|Daisy]], now played by [[Sarah Wynter]]), and otherwise selfishly focusing on their wants.<ref name="film"></ref>  [[List of Dead Like Me characters#George Lass|Georgia "George" Lass]] ([[Ellen Muth]]), the movie's narrator, is fired from Happy Time (a [[temporary work|temp agency]]) after she loudly chews out an employee for delivering a report late.

Unhappy with his style of management, they find themselves trying to figure out how exactly a fellow reaper can be killed as they shoot, drown, and finally dismember and cremate Kane. His ashes are then [[Space burial|shot into orbit]] along with those of [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Murray|Murray]], the cat belonging to George's boss [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Delores Herbig|Delores]].<ref name="film"/> At the launch, Delores tells George that the employee who had sued her for harassment had done so at several of the employee's previous jobs, and George is reinstated, now with a corner office.  The reapers walk away from the launch, wondering who their new boss is; the movie closes with George who finds herself suddenly showered with [[Post-it note|Post-Its]] falling from the sky, like the Post-Its their former leader Rube had used to deliver their reaping assignments. Realizing she's been selected as the group's new leader, she says "I am so fucked" as the camera pulls away from the Earth into orbit.<ref name="film"/>

Dear Lemon Lima
 Vanessa Lemor, a lonely 13-year old Yup’ik (Western Eskimo) girl with a vivid imagination, is dumped by her true love, über intellectual Philip Georgey, 14.  Vanessa spends the summer in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], working at an ice cream shack and obsessing over the heartbreaking tragedy.  After numerous unsuccessful attempts at erasing fond memories, she resolves to win Philip back at Nichols Academy (named after Yoonessi's alma mater, [[Nichols School]]), a close-minded preparatory school where the Georgey family is legendary.    Awarded the only minority scholarship, Vanessa’s new life is a nightmare.  Back from the summer abroad and fluent in French, Philip is elevated to popular status, while Vanessa is relegated to the bottom of the prep school caste system with the rest of the [[FUBAR]]s.  Rounding out the rest of the FUBARs are Hercules, a loveable, but socially inept boy with wildly overprotective parents, Samantha, a 14-year-old who claims her father is a rapper, and Nothing (formally known as Madeline), whose family owns a funeral parlor.  Vanessa’s consolation prize is Philip’s decision to honor Vanessa by being her student advisor.  Philip, wishing the best for his pupil, reinstates the values that once brought them together – the pursuit of individuality and embracement of a social consciousness: an alternative lifestyle for a better world.  Unfortunately, Vanessa misinterprets his preaching, and alienates herself by presenting an anarchist essay at the opening school ceremony.  To make matters worse, she is the only freshman captain selected for the school’s infamous Snowstorm Survivor competition, an event inspired by the Native events in the [[World Eskimo Indian Olympics]].   Vanessa believes that a victory in the Snowstorm Survivor championship is the only way into Philip’s heart.  She quickly forms a quirky team with her fan base in the weight room.  Team FUBAR prepares for the event, driven by Vanessa’s plight for her true love.  Unlike the Native Olympics that brings together people of all sizes and shapes to celebrate Native Alaskan culture, Nichols’ Snowstorm Survivor simply perverts the traditional Eskimo games in order to foster an antiquated class system.  After the tragic loss of a beloved teammate, Vanessa discovers the true meaning of love and must embrace her Native heritage to reclaim the spirit of the World Eskimo Indian Olympics.  
Deadline (2009 film)
 Alice Evans ([[Brittany Murphy]]) needs to complete a screenplay, which she has not finished due to a psychological breakdown after her boyfriend, Ben, tried to kill her. With the deadline for the screenplay approaching, she accepts an offer by a producer friend to let her stay in a Victorian-style home he has recently purchased, so she can focus on her work. She insists on staying there alone, and her friend Rebecca ([[Tammy Blanchard]]) reluctantly agrees and leaves her there.  Alice begins to hear strange noises in the house and becomes convinced the house is haunted by the ghost of a murdered woman.<ref></ref> She begins searching the house and finds a collection of videotapes in the attic featuring a mysterious young couple, Lucy and David Woods ([[Thora Birch]] and [[Marc Blucas]]). At first the tapes just show the couple lovingly talking about their new baby and life together in the house. However, as the tapes progress, the more disturbed David grows. He becomes convinced Lucy is seeing someone else and that the baby may not be his, even though she assures him she's never been with any one else. One tape shows him filming Lucy as she sleeps muttering "she looks like an angel."  Alice also watches one of her own tapes of herself and Rebecca (before Ben tried to kill her) and it is strongly implied she and Rebecca are more than just friends. Alice keeps watching the video tapes of the Woods and asks Rebecca to do research on the couple for her. Feeling worried about Alice, Rebecca offers to come visit, but Alice insists she is fine. As she keeps watching the tapes, we learn the reason Ben tried to kill Alice: like Lucy Woods, Alice was pregnant and, like David Woods, Ben became convinced the baby wasn't his. Also like David Woods, Ben tried to drown Alice in the bathtub. She survived, but lost the baby. This is why Alice feels so connected to Lucy.  She starts to see the ghost of Lucy Woods around the house. When Alice gets to the last tape, she sees that David did kill Lucy by drowning her in the tub and then hanged himself. Alice then gets a call from Ben, who apologizes for what he did to her. During the call, Alice sees a shadow in the house and becomes convinced Ben is inside with her, and that he has been responsible for everything that has been happening while she was there, but he insists he is in Boston with his mother. Still, Alice is afraid and starts to run away, but at that point, she sees the end of the tape which shows David Woods actually survived his hanging when his mother cut him down just in time. His mother then reports David and Lucy missing. Alice comes face to face with David Woods inside the house. He calls her "Lucy" and thinks Alice is his wife. He catches her and tries to drown her in the bathtub, but then he sees the ghost of his dead wife, Lucy, standing beside him. This scares him so much, he falls backward over the stair railing and dies. Lucy's ghost then lets the water out of the bathtub and saves Alice's life.  Later, Rebecca comes over and finds Alice still lying in the tub muttering about the ghost. Rebecca pulls her out of the tub, and as she dries her off, she finds the screen play that Alice has been working on all this time. She discovers it is word for word the entire story Alice has been telling her; it is now clear that everything Alice saw was all in her head. Rebecca then promises she will never again leave Alice alone and puts her to bed. Rebecca goes downstairs where she finds a video camera on the floor where the body of David Woods would have been. She picks it up and watches a tape Alice shot of Rebecca sleeping that looks exactly like the earlier scene shown of David shooting Lucy as she slept, right down to Alice saying she looks like an angel.<ref></ref>

A policeman arrives on the scene but is killed by Kaplow, who is wounded in the process. Kaplow then escapes the house and detonates the bomb, believing that this is the end of Tom and Ordonez. However Kaplow then receives a call from Tom stating that they are not dead and that Kaplow's bullet proof vest is rigged to bombs. Finally, Tom detonates the bomb and Kaplow explodes inside the police car.

Kat is devastated when Arthur reveals he still plans to go after Kristic, and she tells him that she lied about the identity of Captain Industry and that he exists only in Arthur's delusion. It's then revealed in a flashback that Arthur's grandfather, in order to spare him pain as a child, metaphorically blamed his mother's death on the "captains of industry," but Arthur's mental incapacity led him to believe it was a singular person.  Defendor manages to subdue the henchmen, but is shot repeatedly by Kristic. Arthur accuses him of killing his mother, and Kristic recognizes her name, implying he truly was responsible for her death. As Arthur lies dying, Kat runs to help him. She promises to stop smoking crack and get a job. In an earlier conversation, Kat had revealed she had always had a talent in writing, which Arthur had described as being "like [[Lois Lane]]". She promises to be like her as Arthur dies in her arms.  Dooney and Kristic are arrested. Dooney is sentenced to 26 years in prison and Kristic is extradited to his home country. A memorial service is held for Defendor under a spray paint mural that was drawn in his honor, which is attended by Park and her daughter. The film ends with Kat sitting at her typewriter, writing stories about Arthur for a newspaper.   
Delhi-6
 Roshan ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]) accompanies his dying grandmother Annapurna ([[Waheeda Rahman]]) to their ancestral property in Old Delhi. Roshan is initially stunned by the mad rush of neighbours: Ali Baig ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) the renaissance man, feuding brothers Madangopal ([[Om Puri]]) and Jaigopal ([[Pavan Malhotra]]), their wives and families, Mamdu ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]) the ''halwai'', Gobar ([[Atul Kulkarni]]) the simpleton, Sethji and many others. Roshan eventually warms to the place and wholeheartedly embraces the sense of community. He accompanies his grandmother to the ''Ramleela''s, hangs out at Mamdu's sweet stall, plays with the children, and gradually becomes steeped in the culture.  Roshan is also slowly exposed to some sobering realities. When Annapurna faints (due to fluctuating blood sugar levels) and they scramble to get her to a hospital, he finds the roads choked by traffic because of an impromptu ceremony around a cow in labour; he is further surprised when his grandmother, despite her stupor, stumbles forth to seek the blessings of a sacred cow; and he is astounded when the local police seem to encourage the practice. Roshan begins to understand the feuds and social issues in the community. Madangopal's sister Rama ([[Aditi Rao Hydari]]) is unwed (at an age when spinsterhood is a significant social no-no) and Jaigopal's electrical business is going nowhere. The lecherous old local money lender Lala Bhairam ([[Prem Chopra]]) is married to a young woman Shashi ([[Geeta Bisht]]) who, in turn, is having an affair with a young photo-studio hand Suresh ([[Cyrus Sahukar]]). Suresh is a double timer who is also pursuing Madangopal's daughter Bittu ([[Sonam Kapoor]]). Bittu secretly wants out of the stuck-in-time Old Delhi; she secretly prepares to audition for a popular reality show [[Indian Idol]] in the hope that she will win her way to Mumbai. Roshan comes to appreciate Ali Baig's cosmopolitan tastes and is surprised to learn that he fancied his mother many years ago and has since never married. And Roshan comes to empathise with the lower-caste trash collector girl Jalebi ([[Divya Dutta]]) who must endure untouchability at social functions except for when some of the brutish locals seek company. Roshan crosses paths with the loutish inspector Ranvijay ([[Vijay Raaz]]) who blithely stretches his authorities to manhandle the locals and becomes acquainted with the assembly-woman who displays political power at every opportunity.  In the meantime, the news media is all abuzz with tales of a fearsome terror known only as the "[[Kala Bandar]]" (The Black Monkey). This miscreant (never shown clearly in the film) attacks people, steals and has caused the death of a few innocent people. (These deaths are mostly accidental, as in the example of a pregnant housewife who was supposedly startled by a silhouette and fell down a flight of stairs or the unfortunate man who was briefly zapped by a live electric wire.) Nonetheless, the local news picks up on every move by the ''kala bandar'' and loudly blares about all his exploits. Jaigopal, the self-proclaimed electronics genius, theorises that the ''kala bandar'' likely has an electrical circuit (to zap his victims) and may be electrocuted by water; this rumour is quickly propagated.  The film takes several turns. After some initial friction, Roshan and Bittu warm to each other. Roshan intervenes when Bittu is about to receive a prospective suitor arranged by Madangopal. He echoes Bittu's desire to pursue other dreams; this drives the suitor away and brings Madangopal's wrath upon him. He gradually begins to fall in love with her but is confused when Bittu expresses her affections for Suresh (she believes he will support her dreams). Around this time, the ''kala bandar'' attacks Old Delhi. The locals bring in a ''tantrik Shani baba'' ([[Akhilendra Mishra]]) to exorcise the demonic influence of the ''kala bandar''. After an extended ''havan'' ceremony, the ''tantrik baba,'' clearly a self-aggrandizing actor who dislikes the inter-religious equality practised in the community, speculates that the local mosque must have been built over the ruins of a temple that was demolished for the purpose. He thus initiates a vicious cycle of animosity in the previously harmonious Hindu-Muslim community. After the initial peaceful demonstrations (by rallies and angry meetings), a mob goes on rampage and attacks some of the Muslims and their shops. This prompts one Muslim shop-owner, Mamdu, to set fire to the tree temple. Roshan attempts to make peace but is rebuffed because of his mixed religious parentage. The locals ultimately settle on the fact that the ''kala bandar'' is hiding out in the ''sooni galli'' (a dark lane known to harbour evil presences) and must be destroyed. They command the simpleton Gobar to fetch a lock of hair from the evil enemy so that the ''tantrik'' can burn it and complete the exorcism.  Roshan becomes aware of Bittu's plan to elope with Suresh and that Suresh is a low-life two timer. He dons a monkey mask and outfit and stealthily follows Bittu by leaping across the rooftops. In the meantime Gobar ventures into the ''sooni galli'' where Jalebi gives him a lock of her hair so he may return in triumph and bring peace to the community. At that moment, Roshan (in his monkey outfit) intercedes in Bittu and Suresh's rendezvous and causes the cowardly Suresh to flee. Bittu raises a loud alarm before Roshan unmasks himself, Roshan tells Bittu he loves her where she also responds to his feelings, the two share a hug, whereupon the angry locals storm the place. Believing Roshan to be the ''kala bandar'', they beat him to within an inch of his life and Mamdu shoots him. Then, Gobar comes up with a startling deduction about the reality of the ''kala bandar''; that the ''kala bandar'' is in fact the vices residing inside the people of Delhi 6 and something that the people must defeat within themselves. In the end the neighborhood realizes this and helps Roshan to reach a hospital with the help of an ambulance. But while on the way, Roshan does not respond to the treatment leaving people to believe that he died. In the meanwhile Roshan meets his grandfather (after his death) in the terrace of a building in Delhi. Roshan's grandfather ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) reveals that there is a Kala Bandar in his own heart and that is why he wanted to ask forgiveness to his daughter, Roshan's mother, for not accepting her inter-religious marriage. After that he said he will meet him once again. At that point, Roshan responds to his treatment and everyone is happy that he is not dead. The film ends with Roshan understanding the diversity of Delhi 6.  During the end credits, the important characters appears before the mirror and reveal their emotions during their days in Delhi 6.

The Descent Part 2
 Two days after the events of the first film, a traumatized and blood-covered Sarah ([[Shauna Macdonald]]) escapes the cave with no memory of the events. She is taken to a hospital, where it is found that some of the blood on her belongs to Juno Kaplan ([[Natalie Mendoza]]). Sheriff Vaines ([[Gavan O'Herlihy]]) takes his deputy Elen Rios (Krysten Cummings), Sarah, and three spelunking specialists – Dan ([[Douglas Hodge]]), Greg ([[Josh Dallas]]), and Cath ([[Anna Skellern]]) – to the cave to find the missing women. The team members are sent down via an old mine shaft operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald ([[Michael J. Reynolds (actor)|Michael J. Reynolds]]).  The group discovers Rebecca's mutilated body, causing Sarah to have flashbacks of the crawlers and causing Vaines to believe Sarah may be responsible for the girls' disappearance.  While crawling through a tunnel, she attacks Vaines and the others, causing the others to split up. Vaines runs to search for Sarah, and in the process is surprised by a crawler, and fires his gun in a panic, causing a minor collapse in the cavern which traps Cath, separating her from Rios, Dan, and Greg.  The three decide to find an alternate way around in order to try to free Cath and arrive in a room full of bones, where they find Holly's video camera. They watch it and realize the women were attacked by the crawlers. The three are then themselves attacked by crawlers and separated.  Rios starts calling for help, alerting the crawlers to her location, but is rescued by Sarah.  The two then watch as a crawler kills Dan and drags his body away, prompting Sarah to inform Rios that the crawlers are blind and hunt via sound. After escaping from and killing a crawler, Cath finds Greg before the two escape from another crawler and find Sam's body. They decide to try to use her to swing across a chasm, but are attacked again. Greg sacrifices himself to buy time for Cath, but she ultimately does not survive.  Rios reveals to Sarah that she has a daughter. Elsewhere, Vaines is attacked by a crawler but saved by Juno, who is alive and adept at hunting the crawlers. They reunite with Rios and Sarah, who is shocked to see Juno alive. Juno is furious that Sarah left her to die but the four decide to work together to survive. Juno leads them to a feeding pit, which she claims has a passage to the surface that the crawlers use to gather food from above the ground. Vaines handcuffs Sarah to himself so that she will not abandon them like she did Juno. When he falls over a ledge, he almost drags Sarah with him. Juno orders Rios to cut off Vaines' hand to save Sarah. Despite his protests, she does so, causing Vaines to fall to his death.  Sarah, Juno, and Rios reach the exit, but are blocked by a group of crawlers led by their large leader. They try to quietly sneak past the crawlers, but Greg, who is dying from his injuries, appears and grabs Juno's leg in a last effort to save himself. This causes her to scream in surprise and attract the attention of the crawlers. Greg dies and the women are left to fight them off. After all the crawlers are killed, Sarah tries to rescue Juno from the leader, but it slashes Juno's stomach, mortally wounding her. Sarah then kills it before Juno dies in her arms. More crawlers arrive, but Sarah draws their attention to herself, giving Rios a chance to escape.  As Sarah is presumably killed, Rios escapes from the cave. When she tries to call for help, she is attacked by Ed, who drags her back to the opening as food for the crawlers. As Rios regains consciousness, a blood-covered crawler pops out and drags her back into the cave.

Her childhood sweetheart is Dev ([[Abhay Deol]]), the son of a rich businessman. Paro cares for him immensely, and fully expects a future with him. Dev constantly takes Paro's love and affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant and lazy, which causes his father to send him to [[London]] to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev becoming increasingly more egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes. Paro is shocked to see Dev's chauvinist attitude towards her, even after she claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement on Paro and does not approve of the things that he has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.  ===Chanda=== Leni ([[Kalki Koechlin]]) is a Delhi student of half-European descent.

Refusing to live a life of shame and ridicule, she returns to Delhi where she works as a [[prostitute]] at night, while continuing with her studies during the day. She adopts the name 'Chanda' for her profession. Her 'foreign' looks mean her services are reserved for the highest-paying customers and she finds some dignity and independence in the new way of living. One night, an inebriated, half-conscious customer is brought to her room - it turns out to be Dev.  ===Dev=== Dev, tormented by Paro’s wedding, has been seeking refuge in alcohol and drugs. He finds some solace with Chanda but is unable to forget Paro. While in a drug fueled haze, he calls Paro's husband in the middle of the night, Paro visits him at the cheap lodge where he is staying. She shows her love by taking care of him but spurns his attempts at physical intimacy. The meeting ends on a bitter note, and Paro returns to her married life. Dev resolves to go back to Chanda, but confronted by the reality of her profession, he abandons her, too. He resumes his destructive lifestyle of alcohol, drugs, and reckless behaviour. Months later, after his life has completely fallen apart and hit an all-time low, Dev attempts to pick up the pieces. He seeks Chanda once again and, with her help, sets out to start life afresh.  
Detective Conan: The Raven Chaser
 A man driving down a hillside road realizes that his car's brakes have failed. The car crashes into a toll booth, killing the man. He leaves a dying message: "[[Tanabata]] kyo." A [[Mahjong]] tile next to his body links this case to six others in [[Tokyo]], [[Kanagawa]], [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]], [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], and other Japanese prefectures. Because of the Mahjong tiles left beside each victim, the police conclude that the same person or organization committed these murders. The police across Japan unite to solve the serial murder case.  After a police conference about this case, [[List of Case Closed characters#Jimmy Kudo|Conan]] discovers a police officer entering a black [[Porsche 356]]A owned by [[List of Case Closed characters#Gin|Gin]]. He concludes that a [[List of Case Closed characters#Black Organization|Black Organization]] member disguised as an officer has infiltrated the meeting. On [[Tanabata]], Conan corners [[List of Case Closed characters#Vermouth|Vermouth]] in the underground parking lot of a shopping mall. She reveals that the Black Organization needs a memory chip, which the murderer took, and a new member, "Irish".  Conan employs the help of [[Heiji Hattori]] to solve the case by following the dying message lead. He and Heiji find out that two years ago, an accidental fire in a [[Kyoto]] hotel killed a young woman named Nanako Honjou. The elevator could only hold seven, but eight needed to evacuate. Nanako was not on the last elevator and did not escape.  Conan tracks down her neighbor, Shun Sawamura, and asks him some questions. He finds out that Nanako and her boyfriend, Kousuke Mizutani, often went stargazing together. Conan realizes that the crime scenes are ordered like the star constellation [[Ursa Major]], making the last crime scene [[Shiba Park]]. The police also figure out the pattern and leave for [[Tokyo Tower]].  Conan confronts Mizutani, who is about to commit suicide in Nanako's memory and to avoid arrest. Mizutani thought one of the seven had pushed Nanako out, but Nanako's brother, Kazuki Honjou, shows up and testifies that he had overheard two survivors say that Nanako voluntarily stepped out. Conan reveals that the murderer is Kazuki because Mizutani would not murder to stain the memory of Nanako. He tells Mizutani that the survivors appreciated Nanako's sacrifice and sent flowers to her memorial. Kazuki lied to manipulate Mizutani into avenging Nanako but did it himself after realizing that Mizutani would not. Mizutani realizes that Nanako would not have wanted him to commit suicide and returns the victims' belongings to Kazuki, who would have used the evidence to convict Mizutani. Kazuki threatens Conan and Mizutani with a knife. Matsumoto appears and shoots the knife out of Kazuki's hands.  Conan realizes that Matsumoto is Irish in disguise. Irish claims that he does not want to kill Conan. He says he discovered Conan's true identity, having matched his and Shinichi's fingerprints, and wants to turn him in to the "boss" alive. The "boss" would know of Gin's mistake and punish Gin, satisfying Irish's revenge against him for killing his friend [[List of Case Closed characters#Pisco|Pisco]]. Conan wants the memory chip, but Irish refuses to hand it over. [[List of Case Closed characters#Rachel Moore|Ran]] arrives at Tokyo Tower and finds Irish still disguised as Matsumoto. She uses karate, but a kick to his face tears off part of his mask. Taking advantage of her surprise, Irish overpowers Ran.  Irish and Conan move outside near the top, and a helicopter with [[List of Case Closed characters#Gin|Gin]], [[List of Case Closed characters#Vodka|Vodka]], [[List of Case Closed characters#Korn|Korn]], and [[List of Case Closed characters#Chianti|Chianti]] arrives. Irish shows them the chip, and Gin orders Chianti to shoot Irish and the chip. The bullet seriously injured Irish. Conan tries to drag him to safety, but Gin notices Conan and tries to shoot him. Irish shields Conan and dies.  The Black Organization attacks with a machine gun, damaging the Tokyo Tower. Cornered, Conan escapes by slinging a skylight with his expanding suspenders at the helicopter, damaging the engine. The Black Organization manages to fly away, but the helicopter crashes. Conan later discovers that the members escaped the helicopter before it crashed and vows to take down the organization once and for all.  [[List of Case Closed characters#Hiroshi Agasa|Professor Agasa]] and the [[Detective Boys]] free the real [[List of Case Closed characters#Kiyonaga McLaughlin|Matsumoto]] from a small house in Beika Woods with the help of Officer [[List of Case Closed characters#Miwako Sato|Satou]] and [[List of Case Closed characters#Wataru Takagi|Takagi]].

The Devil's Tomb
 An elite group of [[United States Special Operations Command|Special Operations]] soldiers led by Mack ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]), are sent by a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent named Elissa Cardell ([[Valerie Cruz]]) to rescue her father, a scientist named Wesley ([[Ron Perlman]]), who is working on an archaeological dig in the [[Middle East]]ern desert. When they enter the dig site, which is a large underground laboratory, they encounter a priest who has strange [[Boil|boils]] all over his body. The team's medic, Doc ([[Taryn Manning]]), sedates the priest. Click ([[Brandon Fobbs]]) uses the dig site's terminal to activate the elevator and notices something codenamed the Gehenna Project. He asks Cardell if she knows what it is but she denies knowing about it. Mack orders Nickels ([[Zack Ward]]) to stay and watch the priest while the rest of the team takes the elevator deeper into the dig site.   When they exit the elevator they encounter a scientist named Duncan ([[Bill Moseley]]), who has strange boils like the priest. Duncan attacks Hammer ([[Franky G]]) but is shot in the chest by Mack. While treating Duncan's wound, Doc has a hallucination of her sister angry at her for letting her die. Duncan and Doc disappear but the team uses Doc's tracking device to follow after them. The team splits up and Yoshi ([[Stephanie Jacobsen]]) follows a hallucination of her and Hicks's ([[Jason London]]) unborn daughter. The team runs into Duncan, who is trying to open the door to the safe room. Duncan  yells at the team about their ignorance of salvation and Mack shoots him in the head, which strangely doesn't kill him, but when the entire team shoots him he finally dies.  The door to the safety room is opened from the inside, revealing a priest named Fulton ([[Henry Rollins]]), who Cardell knows, and who tells them that Doc was probably taken to the temple; he agrees to take them there. The team notices that Yoshi is missing and, when they find her, she tells them of her hallucination. Fulton explains that the possessed use visions to tempt humans. Mack then duct tapes Fulton's mouth shut. Nickels hallucinates a nude woman and he is attacked by the priest; he fights back with a knife but has his arm broken and the priest spits a dark fluid into his mouth, then drags him away.  Click is separated from the team and encounters Doc locked in some room; when he tries to help her he is attacked by a possessed obese scientist. Hammer shows up and rescues Click, but more possessed start to appear, Hammer decides to throws explosives at the group, causing the passage to collapse. Fulton and the team arrive at the temple, where they learn from Fulton and Cardell that the scientists are possessed because they absorbed the spirit of one of the [[Nephilim]], which is frozen in the temple, to prevent it from escaping. Fulton explains that the dig site is one of many tombs created by [[God]] to imprison Nephilim. Yoshi follows the hallucination to Doc, who is revealed to be possessed. She seduces Yoshi and allows her to lick strange, infectious boils on her shoulder, infecting her. Doc then cuts her back open. When the team notices that Yoshi is missing, Hicks and Hammer try to find her. During their search, a possessed Doc attacks Hammer, who aims his gun at her after he notices that she has developed boils. Hicks points his gun at Hammer, who tries to tell Hicks that Doc is possessed. Hicks doesn't believe him and shoots at Hammer, who manages to run away.  Hicks then chases Doc and finds Yoshi, whose spine is exposed. He tries to help her but she attacks him, and then Doc rips his throat out. Hammer arrives back at the temple to tell Mack about Doc and Hicks.  Fulton realizes that, with Click's unintentional help, Cardell activated the [[Gehenna]] Project, which is a self-destruct device for the dig site. He runs for the elevator alone. The soldiers only have fifteen minutes to get to the elevator before the explosion. The door to the temple slowly starts closing. Mack, Cardell, and Click make it out of the temple but Hammer gets locked in and, surrounded by possessed scientists, he puts up a fight, but he is overwhelmed and sets off his grenades, killing himself and the possessed scientists attacking him. Fulton is pushed into barbed wire by Doc, who then slits his throat.  Mack, Cardell, and Click arrive at the area where they encountered Duncan for the first time, and they meet up with Wesley, who is possessed but doesn't have the boils. Doc and Nickels, who is now possessed, arrive and Mack and Click shoot him and a few other possessed until the possessed priest grabs Click, drags him away and kills him. Mack has a hallucination of his old best friend Blakeley ([[Ray Winstone]]), who Mack was ordered to murder years ago. Mack resists and shoots an explosive barrel next to Wesley which burns him and kills Doc, along with the hallucination of Blakeley. Cardell stands over Wesley and sets his soul free. When Mack tells her that they have to leave she refuses, saying that her goal was to set her father's soul free. Mack makes it to the elevator alone and escapes from the dig site seconds before the explosion. Mack is then picked up by the helicopter and realizes that he has a new purpose in the world, that he is a new soldier in an ancient war.

As a result, they become targets of contract killer Vincent ([[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]]) and must enter the Witness Protection Program.  Paul and Meryl are relocated to the small town of Ray, [[Wyoming]] and placed temporarily under the protection of husband and wife/sheriff and deputy, Clay and Emma Wheeler ([[Sam Elliott]] and [[Mary Steenburgen]]). For their own safety, they are permitted no outside contact via telephone or e-mail.  They have trouble adjusting to small-town life, but after a perilous encounter with a [[Brown bear|bear]] and awkward attempts at shooting rifles, chopping wood, and horseback riding, they eventually adjust and begin assisting the local citizens professionally.  Meanwhile, neither of their assistants back in [[New York City]] know their whereabouts. Vincent plants a bug at Meryl's office and in her assistant Jackie's purse, hoping to gain information, which is eventually successful.     Jackie attempts to call Meryl but Paul's assistant Adam stops her by kissing her, which she responds to by tasering him. Paul and Meryl go on a "date" in town and begin to reconcile, but then Paul is heartbroken when he learns that Meryl had a one-night stand with one of their acquaintances during their separation. The next day, with Vincent in town unbeknownst to them, the Morgans anticipate leaving Ray for a permanent hiding place. The Wheelers invite them to a rodeo, but the Morgans are at loggerheads, so they decline. Leaving the Morgans without any form of security, the Wheelers leave for the rodeo. Vincent tries to attack the house but is accosted by a bear, which gives the Morgans time to escape. They flee on horseback to the rodeo to seek help. Vincent follows them to the rodeo, they spot him and hide in a bull suit. However, they end up in the ring with a bull, which then charges them, injuring Meryl. Meryl, unable to walk, stays hidden from Vincent while Paul impulsively confronts him with a canister of bear repellent spray. Paul accidentally sprays himself in the face, alerting Vincent who then holds Paul at gun-point. The Morgans are rescued by the Wheelers and their new friends from the town.  Six months later, Jackie and Adam are in a committed relationship while Paul and Meryl have repaired their marriage. They have an adopted baby girl from [[China]], named Rae in honor of the Wyoming town, and Meryl is pregnant with their biological child living happily together in New York City.

To win, Vicky pretends to have a heart attack and asks Rohan to come to India. When Rohan reaches India, he agrees to captain the team for his father, determined to make the team win.  Rohan holds auditions to select the best players, but when Veera goes to audition, she is not allowed to enter because players have to be male. Upset, Veera then [[Deception#Disguise appearance|disguises]] herself as a man named Veer and is accepted into the team. One day when a glass of juice is thrown in Veera's face, her hair falls, but she hides it and runs to the men's changing room. Rohan looks for "Veer", but finds Veera in the changing room instead. Veera quickly pretends to be Veer's sister to cover the disguise. Rohan argues with her but later asks "Veer" to bring him to Veera to apologise.

Veera puts her disguise back on and plays well, but in the closing stages, she is tripped by a Pakistan fielder. Rohan rushes to her aid and the medical unit says that Veera's arm is fractured, but she determinedly continues playing. She shows her talent by switching sides and batting with her left hand. They win the match and Rohan asks "Veer" to show his true identity. Everyone is shocked that Veer is actually a woman and accuses her of being a cheat. Veera then gives a heart-touching speech about women and their talents that become useless because of men's dominance. Everybody realises that talented women should be allowed to play with men in cricket teams and gives her a round of significant applause. Veera sees Rohan's love for her and the two are reunited.  
District 9
 In 1982, an alien ship hovers over [[Johannesburg]]. When investigation teams enter, they discover a population of malnourished extraterrestrials, thereafter nicknamed "prawns". The South African government confines the aliens to District 9, a government camp. In 2010, following unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires private military company Multinational United (MNU) to relocate the aliens to a new camp. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints Wikus van de Merwe, a nebbish Afrikaner bureaucrat, to lead the relocation. The relocation uses bribes of cat food, which is addictive for the aliens.  Three aliens — Christopher Johnson, his son, and a friend — are seen scavenging pieces of alien technology, from which they finish distilling a fluid which they collect in a small canister. During an inspection, Wikus discovers and confiscates the canister from the shack of Christopher's friend, but accidentally sprays some of the fluid onto his own face, which causes him to have a momentary seizure. Christopher's friend is subsequently killed by Koobus Venter, a mercenary soldier employed by MNU.  Wikus' body tissue begins to mutate into alien tissue. He is detained and transported to MNU headquarters for brutal experimentation, where researchers and officials discover that his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to use his transformed arm to wield alien weapons. Wikus overpowers them and escapes the facility. Venter and his men hunt Wikus down, while a smear story is broadcast, one that reaches his wife, Tania, claiming that Wikus is a wanted fugitive who has contracted a sexually transmitted disease from anal intercourse with prawns.  Wikus finds refuge in District 9 and learns that Christopher is hiding the command module of their spacecraft and the canister's fluid would be able to reactivate the command module and the dormant mothership. He claims he can reverse Wikus' mutation in the mothership. To recover the canister from MNU headquarters, Wikus obtains alien weapons from District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo and his gang. They use these to assault the headquarters, retrieve the canister, and flee to District 9.  Christopher decides to return to his home planet for help and explains that he cannot undo Wikus' mutation until he returns in three years. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher out and attempts to fly the command module to the mothership, but is almost immediately shot down by Venter and his men. They capture Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang attacks the convoy and seize Wikus.  Christopher's son activates the mothership and an alien mechanized battle suit in Obesandjo's base, using it to kill Obesandjo and his men. Wikus uses the suit to rescue Christopher, who promises to return in three years with a cure for Wikus. Wikus kills all the attacking soldiers before Venter cripples the suit; ejecting Wikus. As he corners a heavily injured Wikus, a group of aliens protect Wikus by killing Venter. The command module is lifted into the mothership and Christopher and his son leave Earth.  A series of news broadcasts are shown about the potential return of the spacecraft and Wikus' whereabouts. MNU's illegal experiments are exposed and District 9 is demolished. Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive. The final scene shows a fully transformed Wikus in a junkyard, crafting a similar flower.

The Disappearance of Alice Creed
   Victor and Danny met in prison and hatched a plan to kidnap and demand ransom for the only child of a rich family. The film opens with scenes in which they make meticulous preparations to carry out the kidnap. They take their victim, the nice Alice Creed, her head hooded, to a soundproofed room. They cut off her clothing and tie her to a bed with a [[Gag_(BDSM)#Ball|ball-gag]] buckled into her mouth. They force her to look at a camera as she is photographed naked. They then dress her in a tracksuit, put a hood on her head and leave her. They bag up both her clothes and theirs for disposal and Vic sends the pictures to her father as first step towards making the ransom demand. In continuing graphic scenes, they explain to Alice that she needs to sign when she needs the toilet and strip her lower half in order that she use a bed pan whilst still tied up. Neither shows any emotion during her humiliation but Vic, who is dominant, questions Danny's resolve now that the formerly 'hypothetical girl' has become real.  Vic is the one who leaves the place where they are holding Alice in order to make preparations to obtain the ransom, whilst Danny is left guarding Alice.  In his absence, Alice, signing that she needs to do a 'number two', persuades Danny to untie her and turn his back. She attacks him with her bed pan and grabs his pistol, which she fires during the struggle between them, hitting the wall. Believing he is about to die, Danny reveals his identity to Alice. They were lovers before his time in jail and he says he met Vic while in jail and chose her as the kidnap victim with a view to getting money from the father she had told him she hated. He says his plan was to double cross Vic and to start a new life, sharing the money with Alice. They hear Vic returning and Danny points out that even if she were to shoot him she would not get past Vic. Alice agrees to play along with Danny's plan and lets him tie her back up. Later, while Vic is away again, Alice gets Danny to untie her and seduces him, managing to handcuff Danny to the bed. She tries to leave but finds the front door bolted from the inside and can't get out. She sees a mobile phone on the table and dials 999 but cannot tell the operator where she is. She then notices Danny's gun and decides to use it to get him to tell her where the keys to the front door are. Danny tells her they are in his trouser pocket, which is close enough to the bed for him to overpower her whilst she is attempting to retrieve them. He reties the unconscious Alice to the bed. Vic returns and says the exchange is on. Vic is left alone with Alice while Danny prepares the van. As Vic starts to get Alice ready for the trip, the mobile phone she managed to obtain falls out of her pocket onto the bed. Vic checks it and finds it shows a 999 call. Then he spots the bullet in the wall, ungags Alice and threatens her. She screams for Danny, proving she knows him. She then tells Vic that Danny intended to double cross him and that she had done a deal with Danny to play along as kidnap victim in exchange for a share of the money.  Vic is shocked at Danny's betrayal. When Danny returns, Vic gives Danny a chance to admit something was amiss by saying he feels something is 'not right'. But Danny does not reveal anything to Vic. They inject Alice with something to put her temporarily to sleep and move her to a deserted, rural warehouse, where they chain her up in a back room. Vic asks Danny for his set of keys to the locks and then drives him to a forest where he says they are to pick up the ransom. There, Vic confronts Danny about his betrayal, saying he has consigned both himself and Alice to death through it. He says he now intends the hole they had dug for the ransom to be for Danny's body. Danny flees and Vic shoots at him, wounding him. Danny manages to get away and hide.  Vic then retrieves the ransom elsewhere and returns to get Alice. He tries to give her an injection, as he has done previously in order to render her unconscious whilst moving her, but the wounded Danny returns as he is doing so, overcomes him and gets his gun. In a stand off between Vic and Danny, Vic reveals to Alice that the two men were lovers. He attempts to use the bond between them to persuade the fatally wounded Danny to put the gun down and be taken to hospital. Danny shoots Vic point blank and then, to Alice's horror, leaves the room, switching off the light on his way out. She is still handcuffed to railings and Vic appears to be dead. However, he revives sufficiently to throw keys to Alice. She manages to unlock her fetters and stagger out through the deserted warehouse. Outside, she finds Danny has not got far. The car he was leaving in is a short distance up the road, the ransom money on the passenger seat and Danny's dead body in the driver's seat. Alice opens the car door and drags his body out. The radio is still playing. She looks at the bag of ransom money and drives away.

Doghouse (film)
 Vince ([[Stephen Graham (actor)|Stephen Graham]]) is [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] over his recent [[divorce]]. Six of his friends—Neil ([[Danny Dyer]]), Mikey ([[Noel Clarke]]), Graham ([[Emil Marwa]]), Matt ([[Lee Ingleby]]), Patrick ([[Keith-Lee Castle]]) and Banksy ([[Neil Maskell]]), all of whom have their own women problems—decide to take him on a "boys' weekend". They hire a minibus driven by Candy ([[Christina Cole]]) to Moodley, a village where the women allegedly outnumber the men 4 to 1. Banksy misses the bus and travels to the town on his own.  Arriving at the town, the boys find it quiet and surprisingly devoid of women. On  the way back to the minibus, the men notice a hooded teenage girl ([[Alison Carroll]]) being attacked by a man in military uniform. They rush to her aid and in the confusion of the moment, the hooded teen takes the soldier's knife and stabs Neil. They run for the bus dragging the unconscious soldier with them but discover that Candy, their once-hot bus driver has already become infected. More infected women appear and begin to attack them as they retreat to a house owned by Mikey's grandmother. The soldier ([[Terry Stone]]) admits that the town has been infected by a biological agent that turns women into [[cannibalism|cannibals]].  The men make another attempt to get on the bus, using the wounded Neil to lure Candy away. However two other infected women had joined her and chase the men back into the streets. They scatter about the village, hiding in a toy store, a clothes shop, and the butcher shop. Patrick gets trapped on a billboard. Neil runs into a house but is taken hostage by a morbidly [[Obesity|obese]] woman who cuts off his little finger and eats it. Neil eventually escapes and is joined by the others, after their own misadventures, in the local church. There they discover a military command center. Matt powers up the computers and they talk briefly to a local politician, Meg Nut ([[Mary Tamm]]). She had been involved in the distribution of the toxin disguised as biological washing powder. The soldier finds a control box and explains it is a sonar device designed to emit a high pitched sound that will stun the zombified women once they have evolved further into "Phase 2" monsters that are faster, more intelligent and weirder. The women so change but when the soldier uses the sonar device it is revealed to have stopped working. He is then killed by Mikey's grandmother, before Matt bludgeons the monster-nan to death with a golf club. Traumatized by what he has done, Matt walks off to 'cool it off' and is killed by a "Phase 2" monster which had appeared from the basement of the Church. After finding a nest with women feasting on the bodies of men in the basement, the men barricade themselves on the roof of the church as more blood crazed women break in.  Banksy eventually arrives at Moodley. Although at first he believes his friends to be high on [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], he soon recognizes the seriousness of the situation and fetches a ladder to get them off the roof. Graham is then attacked by the morbidly obese woman. Banksy leads the surviving group to his vehicle—a small [[Smart (automobile)|Smart]] car, however it is not big enough for all of them. As they all argue Patrick is attacked and dies a bloody death. Everyone else heads to the minibus, where Banksy is killed as Vince fights off Candy. Vince blasts Neil and Mikey, who treat their women badly but get away with it, while nice men like him and their dead friends treat women with respect, only to be rejected or killed. He resolves to be more like them. Before they can drive away, the voice of the still-alive Graham crackles over the walkie-talkie. As he makes his way out from the church Graham powers up the stun-device using a high-voltage power supply. With it now working, the men are able to stop the women in their tracks; however, Vince inadvertently drops and breaks it. The infected are once again unleashed and, with the injured Graham in a shopping trolley, the four make a run for it, laughing.  
Don McKay (film)
 Don McKay ([[Thomas Haden Church]]) is a lonely high school janitor who one day receives a letter from his high school sweetheart, Sonny ([[Elisabeth Shue]]). In it, she asks him to come visit her back in their home town, because she is dying of an unnamed disease. At first he is reluctant because he had been a suspect in a murder case there years before, but Don decides to go. He arrives and gets a ride to Sonny's house by an eccentric cab driver named Samuel ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]).  Don meets Sonny, as well as her strange caregiver Marie ([[Melissa Leo]]). Marie's coldness towards Don makes it clear that she doesn't approve of his presence. Don spends the night, and he and Sonny make love. The next morning, Sonny's Doctor, Lance Pryce ([[James Rebhorn]]) visits. While Marie and Sonny are out, Pryce attacks Don, and after a struggle, Don kills the man, and hides the body in a bed of leaves behind the garden. However, Don had just suffered an allergic reaction to a bee sting, and blacks out shortly after hiding the body. He awakens in the hospital, where Sonny proposes marriage and claims that she had recently spoken to Pryce.   Don goes to see his old friend Otis ([[Keith David]]), and tells him what happened. Otis agrees to help Don get rid of the body that night, but when he arrives it has vanished. Sonny rushes out, thinking the men are burglars, and Otis runs off. After an argument, Don returns home for a few days, eventually getting another letter from Sonny asking him to come back to her.  Samuel picks Don up again, but they are intercepted and kidnapped by a man named Mel ([[Pruitt Taylor Vince]]). Mel takes Don to a hotel room, where it's revealed that both Mel and Marie were planning all along to kill Don and take an inheritance Don would receive upon Don's marriage. Don tries to reason with the two stating that there is no inheritance, and that he has no idea what they are talking about.  Marie refuses to believe him and tells him to go along with the plan, or they will go to the police about the death of Pryce.  With Samuel in Mel's trunk, the four drive back to Sonny's house, and demand that Don go in wearing a wire, threatening to go to the police if he doesn't cooperate with their plan.  Upon arriving at the house, Don hastily proposes to Sonny, stating that he was confused before, but realizes now that he loves her.   The doorbell rings; It's Marie and Mel, who enter the house. After a long confrontation, Sonny hits Marie over the head with a frozen ham, and kills her. Sonny then grabs the phone and calls 911 for help, stating that a man pretending to be a private detective just killed someone in her house.    She tells Don to kill Mel, and Don refuses. She grabs an ax and again asks him to kill Mel, but he refuses.  Sonny then asks Mel to kill Don, and a struggle over the ax ensues between the men.  Sonny kills Mel with the same frozen ham she killed Marie with, and tries to concoct a story to cover all of it. She tells Don that she'd been planning all along to take a large inheritance from Pryce, not Don, that he had received from a relative. It's also revealed that Pryce was her husband, and that the two were going to kill him together.  The police arrive and Sonny lets them into the house.  They find the bodies of Marie and Mel, and immediately arrest Don.  Sonny is taken away in a police car, and the police start to take Don away. The police find Samuel and question Don about Samuel's involvement.  Don asks Samuel to explain his knowledge of the situation to the police.    Samuel tells Don to contact him if he ever needs anything.  Don takes Samuel's phone number and boards the bus back home.  At home, Don is seen sitting in a chair, a wasp lands on his cheek and the movie ends, leaving Don's fate unknown.  
District 13: Ultimatum
 Three years after the events of the [[District 13|original film]], the authorities are attempting to return [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to ravaged District 13. However, their efforts so far have failed to do so. The death of gang overlord Taha Ben Mahmoud has left a [[power vacuum]], and total control of the area is now being fought over by five rival territorial gang lords who want to step into Taha's position. Leïto tries demolishing the walls surrounding the district on a daily basis, but is told to stop by African gang lord Molko, who sees the walls as protection from outside the district.  After single-handedly eliminating a major drug dealer, Damien is framed for drug dealing and arrested, but manages to make a brief call to Leïto to come rescue him.  Meanwhile, corrupt government agents from the Department of Internal State Security (DISS), led by Walter Gassman are bent on destroying the five tower blocks at the heart of District 13 with tactical precision bombing, and building luxury flats after the area is cleared. In order to spark conflict with the district's gangs, the DISS shoot two policemen, dump their car in District 13, and prompt several gang members into gunning down the vehicle, making it look like the gang members killed the policemen. The footage of the incident convinces the [[President of France|French President]] to carry out the strike. However, the DISS were witnessed killing the policemen and filmed by a teenager named Samir and his friends. The DISS agents soon come after the teen to arrest him, but Samir manages to give his memory card to Leïto before being arrested.  Leïto gets himself arrested in order to get into the prison. He then escapes the police and rescues Damien. After freeing Damien from his cell, they discuss the events (deducing that Damien was framed by DISS to keep him from finding out their plans during the crisis) and further plans, resolving to gather enough proof to expose the DISS agents. While Damien distracts the guards, Leïto breaks into Gassman's office to steal his hard-drive for the evidence that they need. Once they escape and return to District 13, Damien and Leïto convince the five gang lords Tao, Molko, Little Montana, Karl the skinhead, and Ali-K to band together and prevent the destruction of the district. While the President struggles with the decision to destroy District 13, even with the area evacuated, a large number of gang members storm the [[French Parliament]]. They eventually reach the President and show him the information that they acquired, proving Gassman is a corrupt DISS agent. Gassman then takes the President hostage and tries to force him to approve the mass demolition. Leïto, Damien, and the gang lords succeed in freeing the President and incapacitating Gassman, earning the President's thanks and a promise to fund District 13's restoration.  With the conflict over and District 13 completely evacuated, the gang lords then decide that it would be better to rebuild District 13 anew rather than try to patch up its remnants. The movie ends with the President authorizing the strike, the District 13 buildings exploding and the president breathing a sigh of relief, stating that he needs a drink.  [[Post-credits scene|At the credits]], there is a short clip showing the President, the gang lords, Damien and Leïto all joking around and smoking cigars together.  
Dogtooth (film)
 A couple and their adult son and two adult daughters live in a fenced compound. The children have no knowledge of the outside world; their parents say they will be ready to leave once they lose a [[Dogtooth (anatomy)|dogtooth]], and that one can only leave safely by car. The children entertain themselves with [[endurance game]]s, such as holding their hands under hot water. They believe they have a brother on the other side of the fence to whom they throw supplies. The parents reward good behaviour with stickers and bad with violence.  The father pays an employee of his factory, Christina, to come to the house and have sex with the son. Frustrated by the son's refusal to give her [[cunnilingus]], Christina trades her headband with the elder daughter in exchange for cunnilingus from her. The elder daughter convinces the younger daughter to lick her shoulder by bartering the headband. Later, the younger daughter volunteers to lick the elder again. The elder has nothing to offer in exchange, but the younger does not mind and experiments by licking other body parts.  The father visits a dog training facility and demands to have his dog returned. The trainer refuses because the dog has not finished its training, and asks: "Do we want an animal or a friend?"  When the children are terrified by a stray cat in the garden, the son kills it with a pair of pruning shears. Deciding to take advantage of the incident, the father shreds his clothes, covers himself in fake blood, and tells his children that their unseen brother was killed by a cat, the most dangerous creature. After he teaches them to bark on all fours to fend off cats, the family holds a memorial service for the brother.  Christina again barters for oral sex from the elder daughter. The daughter rejects her offer of hair gel and demands the [[Hollywood]] film tapes in her bag. She watches the films in secret and afterwards recreates scenes and quotes their dialogue. When the father discovers the tapes, he beats her with one of them, then goes to Christina's flat and hits her with her VCR, cursing her future children to be corrupted by "bad influences".  The parents decide that, with Christina no longer available, they will have the son choose one of his sisters as a new sexual partner. After fondling both sisters with his eyes closed, he chooses the elder. She is uncomfortable during their sex and afterwards recites threatening dialogue from the Hollywood film to her brother.  During a performance for the parents' wedding anniversary, the younger daughter stops to rest, but the elder continues and dances the choreography from the film ''[[Flashdance]]'', disturbing her parents. That night, she knocks out one of her dogteeth with a dumbbell and hides in the boot of her father's car. The father discovers her tooth fragments and searches for her fruitlessly. He drives to work the next day; the car sits outside the factory, unattended.

Dolan's Cadillac (film)
 Middle school history teacher Tom Robinson lives in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] with beloved wife Elizabeth. On a horse riding trip out in the desert one day, Elizabeth comes across a human trafficking deal gone bad, with gangster Jimmy Dolan executing the two [[Coyotaje|Coyotes]] and one of the [[Illegal immigration|illegal aliens]]. Elizabeth is seen, however, and narrowly escapes Dolan's thugs firing at her. She drops her phone, which the thugs find and use to identify her. Soon afterward, a corpse with its lips sewn shut is left in Elizabeth's home, a threat to keep silent.  The Robinsons go to the authorities, and an official admits them into the Witness Protection program. Not long later, Elizabeth wakes up during the night as she needs to vomit, which she takes as a positive sign that she is pregnant. Believing her dream has come true, she gets excited and rushes out of their hotel to buy pregnancy tests, Tom following after her. When she tries to start their car, it explodes in front of Tom, killing Elizabeth.  Devastated, Tom begins drinking, and eventually decides to seek revenge against Dolan. He purchases a handgun, a massive [[Smith & Wesson Model 500]], and follows Dolan around town, eventually going after him one night. But before he can take the shot, a rival business of Dolan's pulls a drive-by, which fails because Dolan's [[Cadillac]] is revealed to be bulletproof.  Robinson continues to follow Dolan, who soon notices and learns his identity. The two meet at a rest stop in the Nevada desert, ending with a confrontation in which Dolan allows Robinson to live (albeit beaten up), believing life to be more painful for Robinson than death.  Undeterred, Robinson gets a job with a construction crew working on the roads Dolan often travels. After strenuous preparation, Robinson sets his trap: a giant hole deep in the road, large enough to trap a car but not so large as to allow Dolan to escape by opening the doors. When Dolan's car falls into the hole, the driver is killed and another passenger is injured. Dolan shoots him out of annoyance, as both his legs were broken and he constantly screamed in agony.  Once Dolan has been trapped, Robinson makes his presence known, telling Dolan that he is a motorist who witnessed what had happened. Dolan, however, eventually realizes that the motorist is, in fact, Robinson, and begins to beg Robinson to let him go. Robinson begins to fill up the hole with dirt, continuing to taunt Dolan with possibilities of his escape, none of which come to fruition.  The official from the Witness Protection program soon calls Robinson to tell him that Dolan had been on his way to a major transaction involving child sex trafficking, a crime that would have destroyed Dolan. Robinson does not care, however, and finishes filling the hole up. Robinson lays concrete blocks over the Cadillac, while Dolan screams from within the hole.   The official calls back and tells Robinson they now have enough for a conviction. Robinson drops the phone and laughs maniacally.

Doc West (film)
  Minnesota "Doc" West ([[Terence Hill]]) is sending money (each bill marked with an "E") to a  boarding school in Boston in a post office at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. After leaving the post  office he is robbed by two bandits who take everything, including his money. He rides after them on his horse, but is stopped when he sees a boy named Silver ([[Benjamin Petry]]) fall  off his horse spooked by a [[rattlesnake]]. West shoots the rattlesnake's rattler off and it  retreats into the bushes.  Silver's arm is dislocated, but West fixes it. Silver asks him if  he's a doctor, but West declines.  Silver tells West that the bandits headed for Holysand, the nearest town. When they arrive  in Holysand, they discover a fire in the middle of town set by Silver's stepfather and rancher, Nathan Mitchell ([[Boots Southerland]]). Nathan argues with a rival rancher, Victor Baker ([[Adam Taylor]]) about burning the bags of seed that Nathan bought. The argument is broken up by Sheriff Roy Basehart ([[Paul Sorvino]]) and the local school teacher Denise Stark ([[Clare Carey]]). Nathan's ranch hand, Garvey (Alessio di Clemente) orders Silver to clean it up.  West walks into the saloon turning everyone's head, because he is new. Instead of ordering  whiskey he orders tea, causing everyone to ridicule him. Garvey offers him a seat and a round  of poker. West wins a hand, but Garvey accuses him of cheating. The sheriff arrests West and  locks him up and Garvey keeps West's money. Later that night Silver tells people about how West  fixed his arm. When the sheriff tells West about his back pain, he suggests getting new boots.  The next morning Nathan's daughter, Millie ([[Mary Petruolo]]) who West met in the post office, arrives in Holysand and is greeted by her childhood friends Burt Baker (Micah Alberti) and Jack Baker (Linus Huffman). The sheriff has no more back pain due to his new boots. West also gives Stark a remedy to heal her sick friend. Millie reunites with her grandmother Melody, Nathan, and Silver. Nathan tells Jack and Burt to stay away from Millie because of his rivalry with their father. After a conversation with the sheriff, Nathan leaves but not before Silver gives West an [[apple pie]] (which they talked about earlier in the film).  West and the sheriff play a game of poker. After the sheriff wins, West tells him that he was  a doctor, but he accidentally killed a patient while drunk. He also says that he takes care of  her daughter, Estrella who he sends money to every month. He still continues to doctor, but  vowed never to drink or touch a scalpel. The Baker brothers set the seed salesman Sam's (Harry  Zimmerman) clothes on fire and are arrested, causing the town to laugh. West is released and  with the help of Nathan, gets his money back from Garvey. Millie learns about Nathan's marriage  to a woman named Dana, upsetting her. He also explains that the Bakers are their enemies, as they  fight over a piece of land. Victor's barn mysteriously burns down. He blames Nathan and bails  his sons out of jail.  In Santa Fe West is going to send money to Estrella and the bank teller declares they are  all marked with "E" (for Estrella) and West realizes something. Meanwhile, Millie wants her  father and Victor to get along and asks help from Stark. West tells the sheriff that Garvey  gave him the stolen money, indicating that Garvey was one of the bandits in Santa Fe. West gets a room at the saloon and plans to stay until Garvey is behind bars. Millie talks with  Burt and Jack and decide to keep their friendship a secret from their fathers.  Stark's dog, Big steals West's pan of beans and leads him to her house. He eventually lets  Big have them and for the first time, the dog shows affection towards anyone. West and Stark  have dinner and West retires. The next morning Millie thinks that Nathan burned down the  Baker's barn and storms off. Nathan discovers that the water pump for his cattle is sabotaged,  causing him to think Victor did it. Silver tells West that Garvey was not in Holysand the  day of the robbery that he takes three days off every month. Victor challenges Nathan to  a gunfight but West shoots the guns out of their hands. Garvey attempts to challenge West,  but the sheriff stops him.  West decides to settle who claims the land by a boxing in the center of Holysand. Victor  and Nathan refuse, but the sheriff reminds that blood will be spilled if they don't agree.  West teaches Burt and Jack along with their friend Larry exercise before boxing. Burt and  Millie's friendship turns into a romance, causing Jack to be jealous. Burt can only kick  but not box and Jack takes his anger out on the beanbag that they punch. Jack is so strong  that a beam comes down and knocks West unconscious. Stark nurses West back to health and  West continues training the Bakers. The sheriff tells West that every time Garvey took days  off there were robberies, confirming Garvey was one of the thieves.  At the tournament there are no guns or eye-gouging allowed. The fight begins and the Bakers win.  Garvey sneaks off to his horse and reveals a stashed gun under his saddle. This reveals that  Garvey burned Victor's barn down and sabotaged Nathan's water pump to cause conflict.  He steals the sheriff's gun and challenges West again to a gunfight. West shoots him  and walks away. Garvey survives and tries to kill him, but Silver jumps in front of him and takes  the bullet. West shoots and kills Garvey.  West refuses to do surgery after Estrella's mother died at his hands, but Stark encourages  him to do so. Silver is saved and Nathan thanks him. West is self-awakened and he and Stark  share a kiss. West leaves the next morning, but a Mexican farmer asks for help. His wife is  in labor and is dying. Silver rides after him and West rolls his eyes.

Dorian Gray (2009 film)
 When a naïve young Dorian Gray arrives in late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] London, by train, to inherit an estate left to him by his abusive grandfather, he is swept into a social whirlwind by the charismatic Lord Henry "Harry" Wotton, who introduces Gray to the hedonistic pleasures of the city. Lord Henry's friend, society artist Basil Hallward, paints a portrait of Gray to capture the full power of his youthful beauty. When the portrait is unveiled, Gray makes a flippant pledge: he would give anything to stay as he is in the picture—even his soul.  Gray meets and falls in love with budding young actress, Sibyl Vane. After a few weeks, he proposes marriage to her. Lord Henry tells Gray that having children is "the beginning of the end", and after the two men visit a brothel, Gray leaves Sibyl. Heartbroken, the young woman commits suicide by drowning. Gray learns of her death the following day from her brother, James ("Jim"), who also reveals that Sybil was pregnant with Gray's child. Enraged, Jim tries to kill Gray before being restrained and carried off by the authorities. Gray's initial grief soon disappears as Lord Henry persuades him that all events are mere experiences and without consequence. His hedonistic lifestyle worsens, distancing him from a concerned Hallward.  Gray returns home one evening to find that Hallward's portrait of him has become warped and twisted, and he soon realises that his off-hand pledge has come true; while the portrait ages, its owner's sins manifest as physical defects on the canvas. Before long, the curse imbued within Gray's portrait begins in earnest, resulting in Hallward's brutal murder after the artist reveals his secret. Gray dismembers and dumps Hallward's body in the [[River Thames]], but the remains are soon recovered and eventually buried.  Gray decides to leave London to travel the world and he invites Lord Henry to join him as his companion, but he declines, citing his wife's pregnancy. After an eighteen year absence, Gray stuns everyone at the welcoming party with his unchanged youthful appearance. He also meets and soon becomes close to Lord Henry's daughter, Emily, a member of the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|UK suffragette movement]], much to her father's disapproval.   Although Gray appears genuinely interested in changing his ways as he spends time with Emily, matters are complicated when he is confronted by Jim, who continues to seek vengeance for his sister's death. Despite Gray's attempts to mislead Jim by pointing out his apparent age, Jim nevertheless deduces his true identity, but is killed by an oncoming train while pursuing Gray in the [[London Underground]]. Meanwhile, as Gray makes arrangements to leave London with Emily, Lord Henry's suspicions are confirmed when a study of old photographs triggers a memory where he jokingly suggested that Gray exchange his soul in return for eternal youth and beauty.  Breaking into Gray's home, Lord Henry discovers the concealed portrait, but is intercepted by Gray before he can uncover it. As Gray attempts to convince him of the authenticity of his feelings for Emily, Lord Henry suddenly discovers the blood-stained scarf of Basil in a box. This prompts Gray to declare that he is the personification of the life Lord Henry fantasised but dared not pursue. Full of anger and grief, Gray attempts to strangle him but is distracted by Emily's call long enough for Lord Henry to knock him aside and expose the portrait.  Disgusted and horrified at the twisted sight on the canvas, Lord Henry throws a lit lamp at the portrait, causing it to catch fire, and then locks the gate of the attic to ensure that Gray and the painting are destroyed. Emily pleads with Gray for the key, but Gray instead confesses his love for her and turns his back as Lord Henry drags his daughter out of the burning mansion. Resolving to end his suffering, Gray impales the painting with a poker, causing his body to age rapidly, before the attic is consumed by an explosion.  A few months later, following a futile attempt to reconcile with Emily, Lord Henry heads to his attic where he keeps the now-youthful portrait of Gray, grimly noting that nobody will look at it now. As Lord Henry leaves, the portrait's eyes glow, implying that Gray's soul is still alive even after his death.

At her mother's home, Jeanne comes across a photograph of what she believes, or has been led to believe, is herself as a young girl, her mother, and another woman.

Later, Sonia attends a [[speed dating]] event where she meets Guido (Filippo Timi), a former policeman who now works as a security guard. They strike up a friendship, and spend some time together after the event. As they part, Guido notices that the time is 23:23 - a double hour, when the hour and minute are the same. He believes that at such times, one may make a wish and it will be granted - although he admits to Sonia that it doesn't always work.  Some days later, Guido takes Sonia to the country villa where he works. The villa has an elaborate security system, but Guido disables part of the system so that the two of them can go for a walk in the grounds.  In the woods, they are ambushed by an armed man and Guido is knocked unconscious. Waking up in the villa, he is forced by armed men in [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]]s to disable the security system. The robbers systematically loot the villa of its art treasures and other valuables. As they leave, the leader of the gang menaces Sonia, suggesting he is about to rape her. Enraged, Guido launches himself at him. They struggle, and a shot is fired, but it is not clear what happened next.  Sonia is shown back at work, then visiting Guido's grave-site. She is distracted at work, frequently seeing glimpses of Guido's face, sometimes at a double hour. She is questioned by Dante, a policeman and former colleague of Guido, who suspects the robbery at the villa may have been an inside job. Dante gives her a photograph which appears to show her with Guido in [[Buenos Aires]], although she has never been there.  Sonia feels her sanity slipping away as her visions of Guido become more frequent and elaborate. Finally she is devastated when she hears that her friend and workmate, Margherita, has committed suicide by jumping out a window.  At Margherita's funeral, Sonia is distraught when the officiating priest names the deceased as Sonia instead of Margherita. Bruno, a regular guest at the hotel, takes Sonia away in his car. He gives her a flask which he says contains coffee and a hint of liqueur. Sonia drinks, and is drugged. Bruno drives to a wooded area and drags Sonia out of the car, wrapping her in a plastic sheet and burying her in a shallow grave. Sonia blacks out, and is at the point of death when Guido digs her up and rescues her.  Actually, Sonia is recovering from unconsciousness in a hospital. She learns that only three days have elapsed since the robbery, and everything she experienced since was only her imagination, as she lay in [[coma]]. She was wounded in the head by that gunshot. And Guido and Margherita are both alive and well.  Guido is made aware when Dante tells him that Sonia has a criminal past, when 12 years earlier she helped her boyfriend rob her father's home, but Guido asks they be left in peace. Guido goes to see the speed-dating organizer to tell her he no longer needs her events, but when she tells him that Sonia specifically asked to meet him, Dante's suppositions are confirmed to Guido. He goes to her apartment and has sex with her, but the next morning she tells him she has to go see Margherita. He, knowing she is leaving him as Dante had suggested she would, follows her surreptitiously, and, in the airport garage, sees her meet the robbery gang leader, whom she embraces and kisses, and who bears a resemblance to Guido. He eavesdrops on their conversation with a shotgun microphone, and learns that he was not supposed to have survived the robbery. As the couple get into an elevator, Sonia sees Guido, sitting in his car, who is in the process of calling Dante. Guido looks at Sonia, and she looks at him, unsure. The elevator door closes, and Guido hangs up, not reporting anything to Dante.  Nervously, Sonia boards a flight to Buenos Aires using a false identity. She notices that the boarding time is 20:20 - a double hour, and dwells to think for a moment.  In the final scenes, Guido is forlorn, and back speed-dating, while Sonia and the gang leader are shown being photographed together in Buenos Aires.

Dragonball Evolution
 Two thousand years ago, the demon [[Piccolo Daimao|Lord Piccolo]] ([[James Marsters]]) came to Earth, wreaking havoc along with his minion Ōzaru ([[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]]). Seven mystics created the Mafuba and thought they sealed him away for eternity. However, Piccolo breaks free and with his ninja henchwoman [[Mai (Dragon Ball)|Mai]] ([[Eriko Tamura|Eriko]]), begins to search for the seven Dragonballs (each one has stars numbering between one and seven), killing anyone in his path.  On his eighteenth birthday, high school student and martial artist [[Goku|Son Goku]] ([[Justin Chatwin]]) is given the four-star Dragonball by his grandfather,<ref></ref> [[Grandpa Gohan]] ([[Randall Duk Kim]]). Returning home from a party hosted by his crush [[Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball)|Chi-Chi]] ([[Jamie Chung]]), Goku finds his home destroyed and his grandfather near death after Piccolo's failed attempt to acquire the Dragonball.  Before he dies, Gohan tells Goku to seek out martial arts master [[Master Roshi|Muten Roshi]] ([[Chow Yun-fat]]), who holds another one of the Dragonballs. Along the way, Goku meets [[Bulma]] ([[Emmy Rossum]]) of the Capsule Corporation, who was studying the five-star Dragonball until it was stolen by Mai. Goku offers Bulma his protection in exchange for her help in finding Roshi. They ultimately track him down in Paozu City. Under Roshi's wing, Goku begins training his [[Qi|ki]], knowing that they must get all the Dragonballs before the next [[solar eclipse]], when Ōzaru will return and join forces with Piccolo.  In the midst of the group's search for the six-star Dragonball, they fall into a trap set by the desert bandit [[Yamcha]] ([[Joon Park]]) but Roshi convinces Yamcha to join by promising 1/3rd of the royalties for Bulma's invention. Together, the group fight off an ambush by Mai and successfully acquires the next Dragonball. As the group continues their quest, they travel to a temple where Roshi consults his former teacher [[Mutaito|Sifu Norris]] ([[Ernie Hudson]]) and begins preparing the Mafuba enchantment so he can reseal Piccolo, while Goku must learn the most powerful of the ki-bending techniques: the Kamehameha.  During the night, Maidisguised as Chi-Chisteals the team's three Dragonballs, adding them to the ones that Piccolo already acquired. With the Dragonballs successfully united, Piccolo begins to summon Shen Long, but is stopped by the timely arrival of Goku's team. During the ensuing battle, Piccolo reveals to Goku that he himself is Ōzaru, having been sent to Earth as an infant to destroy it when he grew older.  As the eclipse begins, Goku transforms into Ōzaru while Roshi attempts to use the Mafuba, but he doesn't have enough energy to live before he can re-seal Piccolo. Roshi's dying words snaps Goku back to his senses as he is choked to death by Ōzaru, and he engages Piccolo in a final battle, seemingly defeating him with the power of the Kamehameha. Goku then uses the Dragonballs to summon Shen Long, and request that he restore Roshi to life.  As they celebrate, they realise the Dragonballs have now scattered, and Bulma declares that they must search for them again. Before they head out, Goku meets with Chi-Chi to get to know her better, and they begin a sparring match to see which of them is stronger. In a [[post-credits scene]], Piccolo has survived Goku's Kamehameha blast and is being cared for by an unknown woman.

Drag Me to Hell
 In 1969, Pasadena, California, a couple seeks the aid of the [[mediumship|medium]] Shaun San Dena, saying their son has been hearing evil spirits' voices after stealing a silver necklace from a “gypsy wagon”. San Dena aids the family by carrying out a [[seance]], but they were attacked by an unseen force (revealed later to be Lamia) that pulls the boy into [[Hell]]. The medium says she will encounter the force again one day.  In present-day Los Angeles, bank loan officer Christine Brown hopes to be promoted to assistant manager over her co-worker Stu Rubin. Her boss, Jim Jacks, advises her to demonstrate that she can make tough decisions to get a promotion. Christine is visited by an elderly woman, Sylvia Ganush, who asks for a third extension on her mortgage payment. Despite knowing Ganush is on a fixed income, and that she suffers from medical ailments, Christine denies Ganush an extension to prove herself to her boss. Ganush begs Christine not to repossess her house and kneels in front of her. Christine becomes frightened of the woman's persistence, desperate pleading as she is helping her to stand up and calls security, who take Ganush away while Ganush blames Christine for "shaming" her and vows to take revenge. Jim compliments Christine on how she handled the situation, and embellishes his positive statements, alluding to a promotion.  When Christine leaves work and gets to the parking garage to drive home, Ganush, hiding in the backseat, attacks Christine in her car. Despite sustaining what should be fatal injuries, Ganush rips a button off Christine's coat and uses it to place a [[curse]] on Christine. Later, Christine and her boyfriend Clay Dalton meet fortune teller Rham Jas, who tells Christine that she is being haunted by a dark spirit, likely the result of a curse. At home, Christine is attacked by the entity and has repulsive nightmares about Ganush. At work the next day, after hallucinating flies buzzing in her stomach and Ganush’s hands in place of Stu’s, Christine snaps at Stu and has a projectile nose bleed that soaks her boss in blood. She runs out of the office, and in the occurring panic, Stu steals a file from Christine's desk.  Christine goes to talk to Ganush for forgiveness in efforts to lift the curse. Ganush’s granddaughter answers the door, skeptical of Christine’s remorse, and Christine finds that Ganush cannot lift the curse, seeing as Ganush has died, and her granddaughter was hosting the funeral/viewing for her in the basement.  Christine returns to Rham Jas, who explains that as long as Christine is the owner of an accursed object, she will be haunted by a powerful demon called the Lamia (loosely based on the Greek Lamia, a child eating demon), that will torment her for three days before taking her to [[Hell]] for eternity. He suggests a sacrifice to appease the demon. Desperate to stop the attacks, Christine reluctantly sacrifices her pet kitten. At a dinner party, she meets Clay’s parents for the first time,. She is again tormented by the Lamia, plagued with grotesque hallucinations like bugs appearing in a cake she bought for the night, and auditory illusions which cause her to scream abruptly and frighten Clay and his parents.  Christine returns to Rham Jas who says that Shaun San Dena will risk her life to stop the demon for a fee of $10,000. San Dena prepares a seance to trap the Lamia's spirit in a goat and kill it, and then allows the Lamia to inhabit her body. Rham Jas tries to persuade it not to steal Christine's soul, but it vows never to stop until Christine dies. Christine then places San Dena's hand on the goat, causing the spirit to enter its body. San Dena's assistant, Milos, attempts to kill the goat, but is bitten by the goat and becomes possessed and attacks the members of the seance. San Dena banishes the Lamia from the seance, but dies in the process. Christine thinks the medium has overcome the Lamia, but Rham Jas explains that she only managed to drive the spirit away until the next day. Then, he seals the cursed button in an envelope and tells Christine that she can get rid of the curse by giving the button to someone as a gift, thereby passing the curse on to that person.  Christine decides to give the envelope to Stu in revenge for his stealing her work, but changes her mind after seeing how pathetic Stu is when he meets up with her. With guidance from Rham Jas, Christine learns that she can give it back to Ganush even though she is dead. Christine digs up Ganush's grave, and after struggling momentarily with the corpse, Christine “formally” gives back the button, and  callously jams the envelope in Ganush’s mouth just in time before dawn, apparently ending the curse.  Christine returns home and prepares to meet Clay at [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles Union Station]] for a weekend trip. She gets a message from her boss telling her that she landed her dream position after Stu confessed to stealing her work and was fired. At the station, Christine buys a coat that she has been wanting as a sign of a new beginning. Clay, planning to propose, reveals to Christine that he found the envelope containing the cursed button in his car; Christine then realizes she mixed up her envelope with another that she gave to Clay when she accidentally dropped it and that the curse was never lifted. Horrified, Christine backs away and falls onto the tracks. As Clay looks on, unable to reach Christine, a train barrels towards her, while fiery hands suddenly emerge from the tracks and drag Christine into the fiery pits of [[Hell]]. Clay, holding the button in his hand at the edge of the train platform, with tears rolling down his face, stares at the tracks in utter disbelief and horror.

He is unaware of her identity and attempts to seduce her. Claire drugs him and steals classified documents from him.  Three years later in [[Rome]]. Ray and Claire meet for the first time since Dubai and spend several days together at a posh hotel. They imagine leaving their government jobs for work in an intensely competitive area in the private sector. They contemplate using their skills in intelligence to enrich themselves. After exploring possibilities over several months, including companies vying for the market in double-crust pizza, they settle on cosmetics and personal hygiene. How they will turn their positions to their advantage is unclear even to them, but they will be ready when the opportunity presents itself.  Claire accepts a job in counter-intelligence at Burkett & Randle. After more than a year, Ray takes a position in intelligence at Equikrom, where he will act as the handler and Claire as one of his agents.  Aware that Ray's new employer will be spying on him to assess his loyalty, he and Claire first practice how they will pretend to be meeting in New York for the first time since Dubai, reprising much of the dialog of their actual encounter in Rome. They are unaware that Claire's employers at Burkett & Randle are spying on her and hear this rehearsal, which blows her cover. Burkett & Randle CEO Howard Tully ([[Tom Wilkinson]]) decides to keep Claire in her job, even though she is a mole, and to manipulate her in his rivalry with Equikrom.  Claire and Ray, working as mole and handler, reprise the dialog yet again and, as they anticipated, Ray's employer is listening in and is persuaded that Ray is loyal.  Throughout the weeks that follow, Claire and Ray remain wary of one another. Both are experienced in double-dealing and despite their romantic connection and plans to escape with new identities once this operation is complete, neither is entirely free of the other's suspicion.  Tully makes a speech to his intelligence team, including Claire, that paints his company as the innovator defending itself from duplicity and theft. He underscores how the unannounced new product makes vigilance even more urgent. He and others in his organization plant information that they know she and the intelligence team at Equikrom will steal as they try to understand what that "major development" might be.  Claire provides a copy of this speech to Equikrom CEO Dick Garsik ([[Paul Giamatti]]), who plots to steal whatever Burkett & Randle has developed. His team, including Ray, devote themselves to stealing information from Burkett & Randle's offices, in the course of which Ray seduces one of their travel office employees and he and several others visit a casino in the Bahamas.  Thanks to information from Ray, Claire is able to appear a hero to her employers, catching Equikrom's spying activities after the fact or preventing them in some measure in the Bahamas. Tully at Burkett & Randle pretends to be impressed, thanks Claire for successfully defending the company's new product, and he reveals to her that it is a cure for baldness. She informs Garsik at Equikrom, who leaves for a shareholders meeting in Las Vegas expecting she will obtain the chemical formula and he will announce the new development to his shareholders before Burkett & Randle goes public with the information.  Excitement builds as the Equikrom team, using Claire as their principal source inside their rival's offices, succeed in acquiring a copy of the formula. Claire and Ray rendezvous at the [[Zürich Airport]], each with a copy of the formula that they plan to sell to a Swiss company for $35 million. At the same time, Garsik tells his shareholders that they are in the final stages of testing for a product that cures baldness. The formula, the Swiss announce to Ray and Claire, is not what they think, just a harmless lotion. They in turn are disappointed, but impressed by how completely they were manipulated. They have only each other now, and a thank you bottle of champagne from Tully.

Dug's Special Mission
 It is Dug's birthday. This ordinary [[Golden Retriever]] wishes that it will be the happiest day of his life, when suddenly, Kevin runs over him and the pack leaders - Alpha (a [[Doberman Pinscher]]), Beta (a [[Rottweiler]]) and Gamma (a [[Bulldog]]) - run into Dug. Irritated with Dug for getting in their way, they come up with "special missions" for Dug to help capture the bird. However, these are just ploys to keep Dug out of their way.  First, Alpha assigns Dug to watch a large rock and make sure it doesn't move, because it is "the bird's favorite rock". Dug accidentally causes a pebble to roll down an incline and topple the large boulder, which nearly crushes Alpha, Beta and Gamma.  Next, Dug is told to sit in a hole, in which Alpha claims it's the "birds favourite hole" and not to leave it. Dug sits in it, but the sand he's sitting on is quicksand and he and the sand land on Alpha, Beta and Gamma at the spot they were trying to catch the bird.  Dug is then assigned to sit on a rock; when he jumps onto the rock, following Alpha's orders, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and the rock they're standing on all start to fall. Numerous scenes follow of Alpha, Beta and Gamma getting caught or captured by traps intended for Kevin, due to actions of Dug as a result of commands given to him by Alpha: Alpha tells Dug to move, in which they get trapped in a net, Alpha tells Dug to move, but Dug accidentally steps on a pebble, which fires tranquilizer darts (one of them hits Beta), last, Dug and the dog's step on tall rock statues, but they all fall over. Dug, Beta and Gamma made it, but Alpha falls down with the statues.  In pain and anger, Alpha vows revenge on Dug, and contacts Charles Muntz in his airship to report that Dug has caused them "to not capture the bird" and that he is a "bad dog". Dug, feeling dismayed, suddenly sees Muntz's ''Spirit of Adventure'' [[dirigible]] in the sky. Fearful of Muntz and emotionally hurt, Dug runs off. Gamma and Beta talk to Dug by radio and comment on how he is "gonna get it now"; Beta sarcastically wishes Dug a "happy birthday". Sad and lonely, Dug runs off into a mist-laden rocky area. He sees a rock that resembles a [[turtle]], followed by one that looks like a man. When he hears a voice saying "I see you back there", he asks if the man is okay. Dug then realizes that he has received his birthday wish: a new master (Carl Fredricksen). The clouds clear, the sun comes out and Dug sits proudly on a flat rock. From here the short comes full circle as it reflects the point when Dug is introduced in the film; Russell notices him and briefly thinks Dug is a rock.  After the credits are shown, Dug is told to speak; he replies "Hi there!," surprising Carl and Russell.

An Education
 In 1961 London, Jenny Mellor is a bright and beautiful 16-year-old schoolgirl who wishes to attend [[Oxford University]]. Her studies are controlled by her strict, overbearing father, Jack. After youth orchestra rehearsals, Jenny waits at a bus stop on the street under the rain when she meets David Goldman, a charming older man driving a [[Bristol 405]]. Telling her that he's a music lover and that he's worried about her cello getting wet, David convinces Jenny to put her cello in his car while she walks alongside. As the rain becomes stronger, Jenny asks David if she can sit inside his car. The two continue talking about music and, before being dropped off, Jenny confesses that she'll be able to do whatever she wants when she reaches university, such as going to art galleries and watching French films, wishing for a life of culture and luxury. The next day, David leaves flowers on Jenny's front porch, wishing her luck at her youth orchestra's concert. Later, she sees him outside the cafe she and her friends were in and approaches him. After a little small talk, David then asks Jenny if she is free to go see a concert and have supper with him and his friends. She happily agrees and thanks him.  On the night of the concert, Jack disapproves of Jenny going while her much more lenient mother, Marjorie, tells him otherwise. David comes by to pick Jenny up and to talk to her parents, where he easily charms his way into convincing Jack that he take Jenny home later than her intended curfew. They arrive at the concert where Jenny meets David's friends, Danny and Helen. Afterward, they go to dinner at a fancy restaurant, where they invite Jenny to an art auction. David picks up Jenny at school and goes to the auction, winning a bid for a painting by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and going to Danny's place afterwards. They talk about Oxford and they all agree to go and visit together the following weekend.  Jenny hears a commotion late one night and sees David drinking with her parents. He then uses the opportunity to ask them if he can take Jenny to Oxford, saying that he used to study there and would like to visit his old teacher, Clive Lewis, the author of [[The Chronicles of Narnia]]. Her parents are reluctant at first, but agree, seeing it as a good opportunity. At Oxford, Jenny discovers that David is a con man who makes money through a variety of shady practices. She is initially shocked but silences her misgivings as she succumbs to David's charm. Back at her home, Jenny and David have their first kiss. Jenny then shows a signed copy of [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] to her parents, which David actually wrote. Impressed by his connections and charisma, Jack and Marjorie approve of their romantic relationship.  On the night of Jenny's seventeenth birthday, David arrives with presents and tells her parents that he intends to take her to Paris as a special birthday gift. Her father angrily disapproves, but later agrees after David talks to him. In Paris, the two dance, take photos, and Jenny eventually loses her virginity to David. Back in London, Jenny gives her favourite teacher, Miss Stubbs, Chanel perfume as a gift from her trip. However, Miss Stubbs refuses the gift, telling Jenny that she knows where it came from and is both concerned and disapproving of her relationship with David. They argue and have a falling-out. Later that night, David proposes marriage. Jenny accepts the proposal and, after an argument with the headmistress, decides to drop out of school and not apply to university.  While getting petrol on their way to dinner with her parents, Jenny rummages through the car's glove compartment for a cigarette and discovers, through letters, that David is already married. Shocked, Jenny tells David to take her and her parents back home. Jenny argues with David, telling him she gave up her education to be with him and that he will go and tell her parents the truth with her. She then goes inside her house, her father asking what happened. Jenny tells her parents that he's mustering up the courage before going inside to confront them. However, David drives off and is never seen again.  Jenny despairs, blaming Danny and Helen for not telling her the truth early on and blaming her parents for letting her throw her life away with an older man. Later that night, Jack apologizes to Jenny, admitting that he messed up and that he believed David could give her the life she wanted. Jenny then goes back to her school, requesting to repeat her last year and take her exams, but is refused re-admission. She then goes to Miss Stubbs, asking for help. She resumes her studies and is accepted at Oxford University the following year.  
Echelon Conspiracy
 Max, a young American computer engineer, acquires a mobile phone that receives strange text messages. First they encourage him to miss his flight which crashes soon after takeoff. Then the messages direct him to buy a certain stock, which increases by 313%. Next, the messages direct him to a hotel/casino in [[Prague]] to gamble. He first wins one-hundred thousand euro on a [[slot machine]] and bets the entire amount on a hand of [[blackjack]], which he wins. Max then has an altercation with a beautiful woman ([[Tamara Feldman]]) and her jealous boyfriend in the hotel corridor, where he is knocked-out, and his mysterious phone is apparently scanned. Max wakes up with the smiling woman, Kamila, and asks her out for a drink.  To further his new-found career in gambling, Max enlists the aid of a Russian cabbie/apparent e-gadget enthusiast, Yuri (Sergey Gubanov), who outfits him with a text-to-voice earpiece to wirelessly receive his anonymous and lucrative text messages. He then hits the 3 million euro jackpot on a slot machine but runs away when [[casino security]] led by John Reed ([[Edward Burns]]) attempts to detain him. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Dave Grant ([[Ving Rhames]]) interrupts the chase and handcuffs Max to interrogate him about the phone. Frightened, Max is unable to provide any information.  At this point, Agent Grant contacts Raymond Burke ([[Martin Sheen]]) of the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], apparently monitoring Max because of messages from an omniscient communication [[Mass surveillance|surveillance]] computer system known as [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|Echelon]]. These messages have been responsible for the deaths of several Americans, most recently a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] IT specialist. Burke recently lost a battle to pass a bill in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to allow Echelon to be upgraded by being uploaded into personal computers worldwide. Burke eventually decides that Max knows too much and must be eliminated; however, Reed and the beautiful woman from the hotel – now revealed as Reed's associate – come to Max's aid and spirit him away to [[Moscow]]. There, Max reconnects with the techie Yuri to get his help to discovering who is sending the messages. Yuri believes that the messages are coming directly from the computer itself, and that the system has somehow become self-aware and autonomous. Max and Reed don't agree but flee when more armed men arrive at Yuri's apartment. A car chase through Moscow ensues.  The chase ends with Reed outmaneuvering and blowing-up the pursuing cars led by Agent Grant, escaping injury; nevertheless, Max inflicts some payback for their previous encounter. Grant, who now receives threatening texts, asks Max to help to stop Echelon. Max receives another text, instructing him to return to [[Omaha, Nebraska]], where he first worked as a computer security engineer. Max, Grant, and Reed all fly home on a military aircraft.  After arrival, the group finds a sealed-up bunker-like structure with a cache of servers and a high-end computer system that Max helped install years earlier and is revealed to belong to another victim of Echelon's messages - the same person whose credit card was used to send Max the phone. Max starts up the bunker's computer and is instructed via text to fire up the servers to connect them to the network for Echelon to download itself into the bunker's computers and to begin a countdown to replicate itself across the world wide network. Agent Grant calls Burke at the NSA to inform him; nonetheless, Burke wants the Echelon in the global network in the interests of US national security. Meanwhile, Max fails to stop Echelon's replication countdown, until he takes the idea of using the computer self-learning ability (also in 1968 Star Trek episode ''[[The Ultimate Computer]]'' and in 1983 [[WarGames]]). Max asks the computer about its primary purpose, and it replies that it aims to defend the US as defined by the Constitution. Max asks the computer to search for threats to the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]]. A lot of articles appear concerned about the recent attempts to secure Congressional approval to upgrade Echelon, underlined as a grave threat to personal freedoms. When the download is complete, Echelon shuts itself down, "learning" that it itself is the threat.  In the end, Agent Grant and Reed send Max and Kamila to [[Paris]] while Burke is subpoenaed to appear before the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]]. In the final scene, back in [[Moscow]], the techie Yuri is unveiled as a Captain in the Russian [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Security Service]]. He is commended for his actions and says they will soon start it again, but they have helped the Americans to make the right decision for the time being; "I want to believe so." he cryptically adds, turning off his mobile phone.

Eddelu Manjunatha
 This film is about the life and times of a lazy and jobless middle aged man named Manjunatha ("Manja") who considers his life as an eventual existence rather than a practical, deserving and a capable one. His laziness is portrayed in the film as not a quality but as an ethic imbibed within his general thoughts and notions of the everyday world that surrounds him. Through his formative years his thinking becomes pragmatic in considering that livelihood can always be sought through alternate sources rather than being a puppet to how the world goes about through linear methods of gaining success and money. The other essentially important character in the film is a visually impaired person named Naani (played by Tabla Naani). Although being born blind, he wishes to be a film director. Naani's most positive aspect of the role is that he does not believe that his physical disability could stop him from achieving what he dreams, that is to be a film maker. The film is structured around the lengthy conversation, which happen in a captive lodge room, between Manja and Naani where each depict their ideologies and experiences and co-relate their thoughts. Being a Jaggesh film, the film is no where short in containing blatant [[satirical]] humour and constant metaphors. The characters of Manja and Naani form contrasting personalities - Manja being an unmotivated, lazy and irresponsible guy and Naani being optimistic and ambitious. Naani happens to meet Manja in a very interesting scenario. Even with their contrasting personalities, Manja and Naani get along together pretty well.  The other important, yet minimally portrayed, role is of Manja's wife Gowri (played by [[Yagna Shetty]]). Manja admittedly marries Gowri in the fact that he was getting a small house as a dowry. Gowri struggles to save her relationship while Manja is doused into the casual habits of alcohol, his influential "circle" of friends, betting, occasional petty thieving at random jobs, inability to sustain decent jobs, wife-bitching and other habits including schemes that eventually thicken the gap between living a moral and a meaningful life and being an incapable disloyal husband. However Gowri's character is portrayed to be of a devout woman who honours the capacity of developing a more healthy family hood through her husband changing his ways some day or the other. But days and years go on and Manja's lifestyle remains unchanged much to the chagrin of Gowri.  The conversation now continues shifting from the lodge to Manja's home itself. After celebrating their freedom from the lodge with alcoholism that night they find themselves again captive within the house due to the help of the local inspector who assists Gowri to tackle Manja's unyielding ways. Naani then talks about the plot of his film, which was seemingly ignored by the producer with whom he had placed his trust upon (and for the reason with which he ended up being captive in the lodge). Manja, hearing of the simple story of Dr. Rajkumar's pledged eyes and how they were now seeing a world through another person, is taken aback and applauds Naani for such a heartwarming plot and how the -Annavru-'s fans would welcome such a movie. He motivates Naani with all success if Naani ever made the film by taking out his mother's prized 50 rupee note from the cupboard and giving it to Naani. He tells Naani that it was considered as a luck charm to any person that received it. He also happens to find a note in the cupboard that Gowri leaves behind (after her inability to tell him personally that night due to his inebriated state) to Manja conveying that she was now carrying and that he would soon become a father. Manja's personality suddenly defines a change after reading the news. He is unable to express his joy, apart from sharing it with Naani, at that moment being locked in his home. He tries calling Gowri but he doesn't get her on-line. In the midst of all this there concocts a life turning situation for Manja at that moment. His wife returns home struck in pain. Gowri had killed the developing child in her womb due to the burdensome worry which she concluded that she wasn't in a state to be able to maintain and grow a child while having such a lackluster and incapable husband. She perceived that it was best for the child to not come to life and face a deteriorated lifestyle. Naani leaves the house expressing his ill-timed presence in the development of such an event. Manja is clipped between a moment of where he faced fresh joy like he had not known for a long long time where he believed that the child, who would be his Lakshmi (the Goddess of wealth), would change his life for the better and to another moment that his 'Lakshmi' would not be happening. In his state of hopelessness he threatens Gowri as to what rights she held to kill his child. Gowri is throbbing in pain to be able to reply to his questions. In this delusion of Manja, Lakshmi -the unborn child, appears to him and speaks to him as to how ill-fated she would have been to have been born as a daughter to such a father. Lakshmi says that Gowri, her mother, did not kill her and that Manja, her father, killed her and suggests to him that he could celebrate this occasion with his friends by drinking along with them. Manja's remorse knows no bounds. He reflects back Lakshmi's words to Gowri and says to his wife that neither his own parents or his own wife or any of his gurus could ever be a guru to him, but the unborn dead child which will never happen in his existence was his ultimate guru to his final immediate realization of the value of life.  
Eden Is West
 Elias ([[Riccardo Scamarcio]]) is an immigrant in his twenties who tries to get to Europe by a boat along with other illegal immigrants. When the boat is near the Greek shores and they hope they will soon  disembark, a marine patrol approaches and  Elias jumps into the sea in order to avoid arrest. So do the other people in the boat. He wakes up next morning in a shore with nudists, which is not so bad after all, since he has lost some of his clothes while he was swimming for quite a few hours. He pretends to be a nudist himself, steals some clothes and he pretends he is an employee of the hotel “Eden Club-Paradise”. Some residents consider him to be an employee and some others a client like themselves. He meets a magician ([[Ulrich Tukur]]) who hires him for a few tricks and since Elias is fairly good, Nick Nickelby, as the magician is called in the movie, tells him “if you find yourself in Paris, come and find me”. Elias considers it an invitation and a great opportunity. Going to Paris becomes an obsession.  In the meantime nasty things happen to him: he is raped by the manager of the hotel and in another occasion he is obliged to clean a toilet with his hands because a tenant considers him to be a plumber. He also happens to witness the arrest of a friend of his, an illegal immigrant, who is discovered hiding near the hotel. He also sees the dead bodies of two immigrants who didn’t make it and drowned trying to swim to shore.  A middle-aged German woman named Christina ([[Juliane Köhler]]) wants him as her lover and offers him refuge in her room. She also gives him money. He leaves the “Eden Club” and tries to travel to Paris by hitch-hiking, without realising how far it is. A man takes advantage of his ignorance and says he will take him to Paris as long as he shares the expenses. Elias wants to prove he can afford it and shows an envelope where he keeps his money. The man steals his money and leaves. A peasant woman passes by with her tractor and takes Elias to her home; there he helps her sell birds and is friendly with her children. Soon after that, he leaves.  The other day he continues his hitchhiking and a couple of Greeks with a Mercedes help him, but some time later they disagree concerning his presence, quarrel and abandon him in snowy mountains. A German truck driver stops and picks him up –he also gives him a jacket. Then he finds a job in a factory, but he realises that his employer is not going to keep his promise and take care of the immigration process. Also, when he tries to eat in the same restaurant with the local employees he is pushed back and this racist episode compels him to run away again.  He ends up in a village hungry and without proper clothes. He steals a jacket but he is found out and is again on the run while somebody cries “damned gypsies”.  Some gypsies think he is a gypsy and they help him picking him up with their truck. They show him the way for Paris laughing at him for his dream. When he leaves he sees two other trucks approaching the encampment and questioning the gypsies where the thief they’ve just helped is hiding. They are friends of the man from whom he had stolen the jacket. They leave after they throw a petrol bomb in one of their trailers.  Elias, on the run again, finds himself in a village where he meets a copatriot. This is the only time that his mother language is heard. The other immigrant is disillusioned from the “West” and says he is heading back to his country, because there are no jobs in Paris, he  does not have any savings, and life back home seems better. He sleeps in a refuge with other homeless people, who steal his jacket. The next day he is heading for Paris and finds club “Lido”.  Finally he finds the magician giving a performance from a beautiful, red Citroen DS cabriolet in the street. He approaches him full of expectations and he thinks the magician recognises him. But when the show ends, the magician leaves. Elias runs after the magicians car and cries  “Mister” and when the magicians driver  stops, the young immigrant tells him “don’t you recognise me? You once told me that if I found myself in Paris, I should come and see you”. The magician stares at him and says “Aha, so you’ve done both. You came in Paris and you also saw me”. He then gives him a small toy magic wand and leaves. Elias, embarrassed, points the wand awkwardly toward the [[Eiffel Tower]] and by chance the lights on the Tower are lit. Thus, he thinks that indeed this is a magic wand. When many police officers appear, he is scared. He points the magic wand at them, but nothing happens. He puts the wand in his pocket and starts walking toward the gleaming Eiffel Tower.

Eeram
 The plot opens with water over flowing from the [[Thiruvottiyur]] [[Chennai|Blue Star Apartment]] in [[Chennai]], and in the block '''E''', which is seen by the apartment watchman. When he goes to the block to stop water, he witnesses a young woman Ramya ([[Sindhu Menon]]), who had drowned in the water and died. Eventually the investigation of the death is taking place which is done by Assistant Commissioner of Police Vasudevan IPS ([[Aadhi Pinisetty|Aadhi]]), who is an honest and upright police officer, and also Ramya's former lover Although circumstantial evidence claims it as a suicide, Vasu doubts that it isn't, and starts to investigate it in another angle.  Ramya was known to be in an illegal affair with an unknown person, and his frequent visit to her flat is confirmed by the neighbors in the apartment during the investigation. But Vasu is not convinced and he is sure that there is someone behind Ramya’s death and names him Mr. X. He also remembers his days of love during their college time. Vasu is denied of marriage with Ramya by her father Shriraman (Rajashekar), as he is not willing to give hands of his daughter to Vasu, who is ambitious about becoming a police officer. But true reason is Vasu-Ramya’s love is not accepted by her father. When Vasu asks her to marry without the consent of her father, she does not accept and both part away. Ramya in turn marries a rich groom named Bala ([[Nandha Durairaj|Nandha]]), a businessman. From then on the relationship is entirely cut between Vasu and Ramya. Vasu then becomes a police officer.  Meanwhile, some [[Creepiness|Eerie]] events and [[Supernatural]] mishaps begin to take place in the Blue Star apartment. Kalyani Subramanyam ([[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]]), who resides in the flat opposite to Ramya’s, dies by [[electric shock]]. A retired colonel and ex-army Thiyagarajan (Boys Rajan) on his travel to [[Pondicherry]] dies by the piercing of an umbrella tip in his neck and also the watchman of the flat. Vasu could relate the deaths with Ramya and he doesn't find how, but finds that the killer must have used [[Water]] ([[H2O]]) to kill them. He appoints a few assistants to live in the flat and inform him if there is any suspected person comes there. The assistants point out a young man ([[Krishna (TV Actor)|Krishna]]) who came there to meet his girlfriend Deepa, and chases him and also informs Vasu. Vasu identifies him as Mr. X and follows him to [[Udayam Theatre]], but before he tries to catch him, he sees the ‘X’ dashing himself in the restroom mirror and X dies in the theatre itself. Vasu also sees human footprints walking on the water and understands that it must be a [[Spirit|Dead Spirit]] ([[Ghost]]) seeking its revenge from them.  Subtle symbols keep appearing to Vasu and he begins to receive premonitions of the killings about to take place. The red color and water when appearing together are premonitions and signals to Vasu that a murder is about to take place. Vasu is not able to convince his superiors about the deaths. He investigates in the angle of life after death, and finds that a life can contact this world in any medium after the death. It may be also through water. Vasu now understands that Ramya's spirit kills everyone. One night, when Divya ([[Saranya Mohan]]), Ramya's sister, visits Vasu in his house to console him for Ramya's death, the latter's spirit possesses her body and reveals the truth of her life after their separation to Vasu.  Ramya married Bala and lived happily with him just for a short time. Bala was a person who disliked anything secondhand in his life. He could not digest his wife’s past relation with her lover Vasu, and hence started to torture her. Ramya’s maidservant complained of Thiyagarajan in another flat, who was sexually harassing her. Ramya warned the master if he would have repeated this she would inform it to his wife. Ramya advised a girl to stop having a boyfriend as it would spoil her life, and this earned her the dislike of that girl. Ramya’s opposite apartment woman Kalyani wanted the flat where Ramya lived, for her daughter. The boyfriend created an impression that he had came to visit Ramya to the woman in the opposite flat. She has spinned a false story against Ramya, and the master also confirmed it to Bala for taking revenge on her. Therefore, Bala killed Ramya and drowned her in water to make it look like a suicide. Hence the beginning of the movie's plot with confusions among Vasu and other police officers for her death.  Hence Ramya's soul killed Kalyani by electric shock, Thiyagarajan by the umbrella tip, and the watchman who supported the false statement against Ramya, Mr. X by dashing him in the mirror and now, she Mr. X's lover and makes her mentally unstable.

Eenadu (2009 film)
 Eashwar Prasad ([[Daggubati Venkatesh]]) standing at the lakeshore, describes in a voice-over about his termination due to a common man walked into his life and turning everything topsy-turvy. This scene leads into the flashback. An unnamed man ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is shown strategically placing a travel bag within a train in a railway station, bus and in a multiplex at Hyderabad. He proceeds to place another bag, under the false pretense of lodging an FIR, in the toilet of a police station located at Lakdi-ka-pool, Hyderabad. He then arrives on the rooftop of a building under construction near Raj Bhavan road and sets up his base of operations, equipped with various modern technology gadgets and instruments. He calls up Eashwar and informs him that 5 bombs have been placed in different locations throughout Hyderabad, which are programmed to explode simultaneously within four hours. The common man demands that he would like to negotiate with a senior Government official. Eashwar seeks the services of the Chief Secretary([[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]]) to act as the negotiator. Eashwar also alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance, tapping all the available resources in gathering preliminary information and tracing the location of the caller. Meanwhile, the caller tips off TV9 news reporter Shilpa Rajkumar ([[Anuja Iyer]]), telling her to reach Lakdi-ka-pool police station immediately as it is going to be "the most important day of her life".  Eashwar cleverly uses Shilpa to fake a report on live television that four terrorists  are being relocated to an undisclosed common site, turning the caller's tool back onto him. Eashwar's men find out that the caller is using advanced software to switch the numbers and locations of his mobile phone SIM card every minute, rendering their manpower and the obsolete equipment useless and prompting them to employ the services of a young hacker, who turns out to be an IIT dropout. In the meantime, Eashwar is also able to obtain a facial composite of the caller with help of the police officer to whom the caller had approached to lodge the fake FIR during the earlier scenes of the film; but much of the time passes without any concrete results on the identity or the location of the caller. Ultimately, Eashwar agrees with the caller's demand and puts two of his best men, Arif Khan ([[Ganesh Venkatraman]]) and Gautham Reddy ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Dr. Bharath Reddy]]), in charge of handing over the four terrorists along with cell phones at the old Begumpet Airport (end of Runway no. 4). The caller also demands reporter Shilpa to reach the nearest police station at Begumpet.  The caller calls up Eashwar, as he is on the way, for a final time to further reveal that he had not planted any other bomb in the city. At this point, Eashwar surprisingly declares he already knew there were no more bombs which make it clear that his decision to kill the last terrorist wasn't taken in fear but in confidence. Eashwar reaches the caller's location just as the latter is leaving the place, having destroyed all his gadgets and equipment, leaving behind no evidence. The two meet briefly when Eashwar, identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of the face sketch, offers the man a ride home and introduces himself. Both shake hands when Eeshwar's voice-over cuts back as he says the man told him his real name, but his name doesn't have any significance. The film ends on an idealistic note, with Eashwar admitting that they all knew the common man was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities, but he never imagined him to go to such lengths and have the guts to do something like that. He also repeats that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it, and acknowledges that although the incidence has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best.

Enter the Void
 Oscar ([[Nathaniel Brown]]) lives in Tokyo with his younger sister Linda ([[Paz de la Huerta]]) and supports himself by dealing drugs, against the advice of his friend Alex (Cyril Roy), who attempts to turn Oscar's interest toward ''[[Bardo Thodol|The Tibetan Book of the Dead]]'', a Buddhist book about the afterlife. The first segment begins with Linda leaving for work (at a local strip club) and then follows Oscar's nightly routine through strict point-of-view shots, including momentary blackouts that represent blinking, private internal thoughts, and extended sequences of a [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]-induced hallucination.  Next, Alex meets Oscar at the apartment and they leave so that Oscar can deliver drugs to his friend Victor ([[Olly Alexander]]). On the way, Alex explains parts of ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'' to Oscar: how the spirit of a dead person sometimes stays among the living until it begins to experience nightmares, after which it attempts to reincarnate. They arrive at a bar called The Void. Oscar enters alone and sits down with a distressed Victor, who mutters "I'm sorry" before they are swarmed by police officers. Oscar seals himself in a bathroom stall and attempts to flush his drugs. When the flush does not work, he yells through the door that he has a gun and will shoot. In response, a police officer opens fire and hits Oscar, who falls to the floor.  Oscar's viewpoint rises and looks at his body from above, and then we begin to witness his life in a roughly chronological order. His loving parents were killed in a violent car crash; Oscar and Linda, devoted to each other, were sent to different foster homes; Oscar moved to Tokyo and earned money through drug dealing until he could afford to bring Linda to live with him; Oscar sleeps with his friend Victor's mother in return for extra money to help bring his sister over; Linda found work as a stripper for the nightclub owner Mario, to Oscar's distress; Oscar increased the scope of his dealing operations and started using potent psychedelics—in particular, [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]—more frequently; Alex discovered that Oscar slept with Victor's mother; and finally, we again see Oscar meet Victor at The Void to sell him drugs, only to be shot in the bathroom.  Afterwards, a disembodied Oscar floats over Tokyo and witnesses the aftermath of his death. Linda becomes withdrawn and despondent, especially after getting an abortion; Oscar's dealer, Bruno, destroys his stash; Alex lives in hiding on the streets; and Linda wishes she would have been with Alex instead of Mario, as Oscar had wanted. On one occasion, Linda wishes that Oscar would come back to life; Oscar then enters Linda's head, and experiences her dream in which he wakes up at the morgue, from which his body is taken to be cremated.  Meanwhile, Victor and his mother scream at each other because she had had sex with Oscar, and because of that Victor had informed the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.  The perspective now hovers high above Tokyo and enters an airplane, where Oscar's mother breast-feeds a baby Oscar. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take a taxi to a Tokyo [[love hotel]] and have sex. The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like pink glow from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot from the perspective of a baby being born to Oscar's mother.

Marcus visits his badly reputed friend and spiritualist, Martineau ([[Richard Dutcher]]), learning the deceased Emma and now Carla is possessed by an ancient spirit. Out of spite, Carla abducts Jenny and on her way home, kills Josie by running her over with her car.  Carruthers arrives at Carla's house, looking to warn Marcus about the evil spirit which had also possessed his case file victim, Elizabeth Markham. According to [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] mythology, it's revealed the demonic spirit is [[Lilith]], Adam's first wife who he rejected, as God granted him Eve in the [[Garden of Eden]].

Eventually, Marcus shoots Carla who dies and he tries to save Jenny, but he faints in the pool due to the drug he was given. Paramedics arrive to rescue Marcus and Jenny, who both survive. After they leave the hospital, it’s revealed Jenny is now possessed by the spirit and she and Marcus part ways.  
Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance
   The resuscitated skeleton of the [[Shamshel|Third Angel]] escapes its confinement and tries to break out of NERV's arctic [[Bethany (biblical village)|Bethany]] Base, but [[Mari Illustrious Makinami]], a new pilot, launches [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Provisional Unit 05|Evangelion Provisional Unit-05]] and destroys the Angel by self-destructing the EVA and safely ejecting at the last moment.  Meanwhile, [[Shinji Ikari]] and his father [[Gendo Ikari|Gendo]] visit [[Yui Ikari|Yui's]] grave. Shortly after, the Seventh Angel attacks, but is quickly dispatched by the newly arrived [[Eva Unit-02|Unit-02]] and its headstrong pilot, [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka Langley Shikinami]]. [[Ryoji Kaji]] delivers to Gendo a suitcase containing the mysterious "Key of Nebuchadnezzar" and notes that the destruction of Unit-05 went as planned. Gendo and [[Kozo Fuyutsuki]] then visit NERV's lunar compound, [[Tabgha]] Base, to view the construction of [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Mark.06|Evangelion Mark.06]], which is noted as being different from the other EVAs. They are denied permission to land, but briefly see [[Kaworu Nagisa]] sitting in space without a space suit. During Gendo's absence, the [[List of Angels in Neon Genesis Evangelion#Sahaquiel|Eighth Angel]] attacks Tokyo-3. Shinji, Asuka, and Rei kill it in an improvised plan devised by [[Misato Katsuragi]]. Both [[Evangelion (mecha)#Evangelion Unit 00 (Zerogōki: 零号機)|Unit-00]] and [[Eva Unit-01|Unit-01]] are damaged. Gendo returns and asks to have them both repaired, but SEELE only allows the repair of Unit-01.  In an attempt to heal the relationship between Gendo and Shinji, Rei prepares a dinner party. At the same time, Mari arrives in Tokyo-3. Later, [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Unit 04|Unit-04]] and NERV's U.S. branch are destroyed during an experiment, prompting the U.S. government to send [[Evangelion (mecha)#EVA Unit 03|Unit-03]] to Tokyo-3. Due to an international agreement that allows no more than three functioning Evangelions per country at a time, NERV seals away Unit-02 and schedules a test of Unit-03 on the same day as Rei's dinner party; Asuka volunteers to take Rei's place as the test pilot. Once Asuka activates Unit-03, the [[Bardiel|Ninth Angel]] possesses the EVA and goes on a rampage. Shinji pilots Unit-01, but refuses to fight the Angel for fear of harming Asuka, who is still trapped inside. Gendo orders the activation of the Dummy System, which makes Unit-01 autonomous, and allows it to savagely destroy Unit-03, crushing the cockpit in its teeth. Emotionally wounded by his father's cold decision, Shinji leaves NERV.  Asuka survives, but is grievously injured and placed in quarantine for fear of mental contamination by the Angel. Shinji heads out of the city, but the [[Zeruel|Tenth Angel]] attacks, so he flees to an emergency shelter. Gendo fails to activate Unit-01 without Shinji, so Mari hijacks Unit-02 and heads out to fight the Angel alone. She removes Unit-02's restraints and launches an all-out attack, but the Angel severely damages Unit-02. Rei joins the fight with the damaged Unit-00 and charges at the Angel with a missile. The missile detonates, but fails to destroy the Angel. The Angel consumes Unit-00 and integrates it with its own body, allowing it to bypass NERV's defenses.  Upon seeing Rei consumed along with Unit-00, Shinji rushes to Gendo and asks to pilot Unit-01 again. Shinji fends off the Angel, but before he can defeat it, Unit-01 runs out of power and shuts down. Unit-01 reactivates in berserk mode in response to Shinji's rage at the loss of Rei. It easily takes down the Angel, and Shinji uses the EVA to reach inside the Angel's core to save Rei. Unit-01 then starts transcending its physical boundaries to grant Shinji's wish. At the moment Shinji retrieves Rei, Unit-01 pulls Unit-00's core out of the Angel. The Angel explodes and its remains, along with Unit-00's core, are absorbed into Unit-01, fusing them all into one being. Unit-01 then sprouts giant wings of light, and Misato, who has been watching the battle, sees that they are identical to the ones she saw during Second Impact. Ritsuko realizes that the EVA has become a divine being, triggering Third Impact and declares this to be the end of the world.  In a [[post-credits scene]], a spear shoots down from the Moon and impales Unit-01 in the middle of its [[apotheosis]], neutralizing it and stopping Third Impact. Kaworu then descends from the Moon in Mark.06, saying that this time, he will show Shinji true happiness.

Frank overhears a message being left on an answering machine, indicating the apartment is actually borrowed from Rosie's friend. During dinner, Frank asks Rosie why his adult children never talked to him and told him things, when they told their mother everything. He is not comfortable, having a feeling that all his kids are lying to him.  Frank flies back home but — without any more pills — he has a heart attack in the plane's lavatory. Frank has another dream of his kids as young children and deduces each of their secrets by way of confronting them: Amy is separated from her husband, Robert lied about going to Europe with his orchestra and Rosie is really the mother of the child Jilly brought over. Frank awakens in hospital, with Amy, Robert, and Rosie around his bedside. They inform him that David had died from an overdose. During the night, Frank has a vision about a young David being in his hospital room. Frank tells him how he was never disappointed in him and he never would be as David grew up.  Frank then visits his wife's grave and talks to her. He tells her all about the kids and how they are all doing fine. Frank goes back to the Art Gallery below David's apartment to buy David's painting, but it has already been sold. The girl at the desk tells him that if any of David's art comes through, she would let him know. After leaving, she runs out to tell Frank about how great his son was, upon realizing the family connection. She shows him another painting by David that is more appropriate to him — a landscape showing [[Electrical_conduit#PVC_conduit|PVC-covered]] power lines made out of glue and macaroni in homage to Frank's career. The last scene shows the family at [[Christmas]]. All three children are around the house helping cook and decorate the tree. It's also revealed that Rosie and Jilly are a couple and are raising the baby together. The film ends with Frank walking into the dining room, to his family.

Evil Bong 2: King Bong
 The film begins with Larnell (John Patrick Jordan) pacing around in his new dorm room, looking afraid. Responding to a sudden knock at the door, Larnell admits Alister McDowell ([[Brett Chukerman]]), whom he had called over. Asked how things are going, Larnell admits to Alister that he is on the run, having burned down the college's administrations office from a belief that the reason their parents are forcing them to go to school is because they are being taken control of from underneath the government, trying to control their minds into becoming like them. He is even considering writing a number one best seller about it. Larnell also tells him that Bachman (Mitch Eakins) now has a job at ''Sloppy Burger'' and remains his roommate. Alister asks Larnell why he called over and Larnell tells him that something has gone wrong with Bachman. Bachman then returns from work and starts describing how his day had gone, which had led to him being fired, until he drops onto the floor, fast asleep. Larnell explains that this was what he was trying to tell Alister. Alister explains it as [[narcolepsy]] and that Bachman needs medical help. Larnell also explains that he and Brett (Brian Lloyd) also have problems. Brett and his girlfriend Luann ([[Robin Sydney]]) both come to the apartment, where Brett is shown to have gained substantial weight. Larnell then suddenly starts humping Luann's leg, and explains to Alister that his sexual urges make him pounce like a cougar. Alister then realizes that Larnell, Bachman and Brett were the first ones to smoke from the bong and are the only ones who were killed within the ''bong world,'' which is probably the reason for neither Luann nor Alister experiencing side effects.  Believing that stop smoking the bong is the reason why they're suffering side-effects, the group then decides to call the delivery man that gave them the bong. The man's name is revealed to be Rabbit (Sonny Davis) and he says he'll tell them what he knows about the bong in exchange for some of the weed they got. He says that [[Evil Bong|Jimbo Leary]] bought the bong from the [[Brazilian Amazon|Amazon]] in South America in the 1960s' when he used to work for the [[peace corps]]. After half of his friends took a hit from the bong and died, Jimbo locked the bong up in his attic, until his wife sold the bong up for ad, which led to the events of the [[Evil Bong|previous film]]. Believing that they could possibly find a cure, Larnell, Rabbit, Alister, Bachman and Brett head out to the amazon. On the way they bump into Velicity ([[Amy Paffrath]]), a woman who claims that she and her partner (who was a friend of her deceased father) are there because they're doing some research. She takes them inside her hut for some food and after witnessing Bachman black out again, the group then explains to her what's going down. However, she believes them but then switches the subject when Rabbit starts asking her if there's marijuana near them. Rabbit and Larnell go outside to take a piss, where they find a whole pile of marijuana and they're greeted by Velicity's partner, who turns out to be Larnell's grandfather Cyril (Jacob Witkin), who's somehow out of his wheelchair. Larnell and Rabbit go back to the hut to have Velicity explain to them what's going on.  She explains that the research her father was uncovering was the marijuana. She explains that the marijuana was believed to belong to an ancient tribe that has gone around for generations, which she calls the Poontang Tribe. Cyril knew Velicity's father from college and after her father's death, she called him to help her with her father's research and they discovered that marijuana can be used to help people's pain problems and severe injuries, explaining the reason how Cyril is able to walk again, and Velicity is planning on using the marijuana to give to doctors so she could help those who have [[cancer]]. Bachman then tells them that if the marijuana helped Cyril, it could probably help them with their side effects. Velicity wonders if the bong is in any connection with the marijuana from the poontang tribe. Larnell pulls out a bag, revealing a few pieces the blown up bong, Eebee. After putting the pieces together, forming her face, Velicity easily recognizes the bong as being the work of the tribe. Suddenly, Eebee (voiced by Michele Mais) comes back to life. Alister theorizes that the proximity of the marijuana has brought her back to life, which Eebee agrees. Larnell puts her back in the bag and Velicity tells them that she'll show her to Cyril. As she finds Cyril, she finds him talking on the phone with a guy who he was planning on selling to. Realizing that he was planning on selling it to the [[black market]] and was planning on helping her at all, she confronts him until she steals Eebee out of his hands and goes off to cry to the others. Hearing about Cyril's plan on selling the marijuana, Eebee tells him that he can bring her back to her original form with the marijuana, and tells him that she and he will rule the world.  Back at the hut, Rabbit goes to confront Cyril while Larnell, Bachman and Brett take a toke of the marijuana, in hopes that it will cure them. Rabbit arrives to find Eebee reconstructed into her original form. Rabbit, however, makes a deal with Cyril that he wants to help him sell the marijuana so he ''too'' can get paid, since he only gets paid $200 a week just to get up at five in the morning to deliver packages. If Cyril doesn't agree, Rabbit will take Eebee back to the poontang tribe. Eebee, suddenly, cries for Rabbit not to take her back because she claims that her ''man'' ordered the tribe to take her away, leading to her falling in the hands of Jimbo. Suddenly, three women appear behind them, who Eebee claims to be members of the poontang tribe. Cyril confronts them but gets hit in the face with a spear. The tribe then take Eebee and Rabbit hostage and brings them back to Eebee's ''man'', who is revealed to be another bong, called the ''King Bong'' (voiced by Michael A. Shepard). King Bong then tempts Rabbit to him and he and the tribe head back into the bong, leaving King Bong to be yelled at Eebee, who's still mad at him for having the tribe kick her out. Back at the hut, Larnell, Bachman and Brett turn back to normal again. Larnell has no sexual urges, Bachman doesn't feel like he's about to pass out again, and Brett is now back to being thinner. Suddenly, Cyril barges in, bleeding from his head and he tells them that the tribe kidnapped Eebee and Rabbit. Realizing that they could be killing Rabbit any moment, Larnell, Velicity, Alister, Bachman and Brett take a couple of spears and head out to save Rabbit.  They find the King Bong and realize that not only do they need to get Rabbit back, they also have to kill the King Bong. They just don't know how, until Eebee tells them that they have to destroy his ''symbol'', which gives him his power. When asked why she's telling them the information, she declares that she wants to see the bong die and be gone for good because she remains angry with him. Bachman and Brett take a hit first and it's revealed that this bong is more powerful than Eebee, so instead of their spirits getting sucked up into the bong, they're ''physically'' sucked up into the bong. Bachman and Brett end up in the King Bong's ''bong world'', where it's in the jungle and the duo end up getting lap-danced by two members of the pibe. Back in the real world, Alister takes a hit and ends up finding Rabbit getting pleasured by another two members of the tribe on a bed. Alister is almost pleasured by a member until he threatens to beat her up, which she simply replies by smacking him in the face, knocking him out. Rabbit is then taken by the tribe to see King Bong. Back in the real world, Larnell tells Velicity to stay while he deals with the bosses her goodbye. Larnell ends up finding a knocked out Alister on the bed, wakes him up and continue to find the bong. There, they find the tribe rolling Rabbit up in paper and suddenly, the bong shrinks him, turning him into a doobie<ref></ref> and find Bachman and Brett tied up. Alister and Larnell then see a medallion wrapped around the bong.  Realizing that the medallion is his ''symbol'' they quickly sneak up behind Bachman and Brett, untie them, and the group attacks the tribe while Larnell breaks the medallion, destroying the King Bong's power. This causes him and the Poontang Tribes-People to explode and sends Larnell and the others back to the [[Earth|real world]]. As the group gets ready to leave, Larnell decides to stay behind and help Velicity with her idea of sending the marijuana to doctors, providing them the caner. As they walk back to the hut to get business started, Eebee calls back for them not to leave her alone. Back at the dorm, Bachman finally gets his job back at ''Sloppy Burger,'' Alister is continuing to get his second major, Brett and Luann are back together, Larnell is still helping Vel with the cure, and Rabbit is now a preacher. He claims that when he got rolled up into a doobie, he prayed to god that he'll do good and ask for his sins. Bachman then offers him some marijuana, which Rabbit gladly agrees to. During the end credits, the King Bong can be heard moaning as he's having one of the tribe members pleasure with him.  
Evil Things
 Five college students leave New York City for a weekend in the country, and 48&nbsp;hours later they vanished without a trace.  To celebrate Miriam's (Elyssa Mersdorf) birthday, Miriam's Aunt Gail (Gail Cadden) gives her use of a large country home in the [[Catskills]] for the weekend. Miriam invites her friends Cassy (Laurel Casillo), Mark (Morgan Hooper), Tanya (Torrey Weiss) and Leo (Ryan Maslyn) to join her to celebrate.  As an aspiring filmmaker, Leo brings his new video camera, hoping to create a short documentary of the weekend getaway. The five begin driving to the house. Whilst looking for a place to pull over because Tanya is carsick, the group notice they are being bothered by a dark red van whose driver incessantly honks his horn at them and overtakes them only to slow down in front of them. They pass the van and continue on. They stop at a small gas station where Cassy notices a dark red van pull in and slow down.  Spooked, the gang leave. As they are driving away, a girl from inside the gas station stops them to hand over a phone Cassy left in the bathroom. The group continue to Aunt Gail's home and are again tailed by the van. They stop at a diner and while eating, the van pulls into the diner parking lot and drives slowly by the window. Furious, Mark storms outside to confront the driver but he drives away when Mark gets too close.  The group eventually make it to the house and Aunt Gail comes to turn the power on and wish them a good night. The five surprise Miriam with a birthday cake and then party and drink with Leo filming the whole occasion.  The next day, the group take a hike to the snowy woods which they soon get lost in the dark. They hear noises that they can't identify, crackling sounds on their two-way-radio and branches snapping which scares them all into a run. They do eventually make it back to the house without further incident. Later when eating dinner, they receive phone calls with no one answering. A knock at the door is heard and Mark finds a video tape wrapped in brown paper on the front step.  The tape reveals that the group have been being secretly video taped since they were on the road, and are being stalked by the same person in the maroon van. There is footage of them at the gas station with the girl running out to give Cassy back her phone, and them at the diner when Mark attempted to confront the driver of the van, proving it is the same van who has been following them the whole time. Then the footage follows them to Aunt Gail's house and shows film taken through the windows of the group laughing and having fun, surprising Miriam with her birthday cake, and to their horror, the stalker inside the house filming them all as they slept.  The phone rings again with no answer, and then the line is cut. No one can get a signal on their cell phones. The group decide to leave but when they run out to the car they see that it is missing. A van pulls up in the driveway, scaring the group back into the house. As everyone tries to get a signal on their phones again, all the power in the house goes out. Miriam finally gets a signal on her phone and dials 9-1-1, but the call drops out.  Down the hall, the group hear a noise. Mark gets a knife and goes to investigate. He finds a two way radio that is on and crackling. The door suddenly shuts from the inside and Mark's cries of pain can be heard. Cassy bangs on the door and tries to open it, and then it opens just a crack which scares the group into running upstairs to hide.  Upstairs, the group see the van driving away from the house so they come back downstairs to leave. Leo gives the camera to Tanya and leads the way out, but once outside he sees something that makes him scream at the others to run back inside. Once inside, Tanya falls breaking the camera and all left is the audio sound of Tanya screaming and her and Leo's fate is left unknown.  On the video footage of the van outside, Miriam is shown to be running from the house. The van turns on its lights and creeps along to follow her. The van stops and the stalker gets out and chases a screaming Miriam into the woods.  Back inside the house, the other stalker is looking around the house for Cassy with his [[nightvision]] on the camera. He finds Cassy hiding behind a couch and, believing she is alone, creeping out wandering blindly around the home. The stalker follows her watching how far she will get. Cassy gets to the door but, it is pulled shut from the outside, and the camera man makes the same sound the group heard in the woods alerting Cassy of his presence. She screams as he then lunges out at her, and the camera freezes on Cassy's screaming face.  The view pulls back and shows to a dark room were the stalker is watching several videos on many monitors. As well as the stalkers footage, there is also the footage Leo shot implying the stalkers stole his camera.  The last piece of film shows the stalker with the camera in a park, surveying groups of friends. While looking around he spots another group of friends filming. He then follows them on their trip.  During the end credits the video of the stalker's movements are shown from the moment he first spotted the group on the highway, following them to the house, filming them through the windows and while they sleep. Many of the close up shots focus solely on Cassy.

Exam (2009 film)
 The film is set in an [[alternate history]], present-time [[United Kingdom]]. Eight candidates dress for what appears to be an employment assessment exam, entering a room and sitting at individual desks. Each desk contains a question paper with the word "candidate", followed by a number, from one to eight. The Invigilator, a representative of the company named DATAPREV, explains that the exam is 80 minutes and consists of only one question, but there are three rules. The candidates must not: talk to the Invigilator or the armed guard at the door, spoil their paper, or leave the room. If they do, they will be disqualified. He asks them if they have any questions, and then leaves the room.  As the exam starts, it turns out that their papers are blank with no question stated. Within minutes, the Chinese candidate is disqualified for spoiling her paper by writing on it. After her ejection, the seven remaining candidates realize it is permissible to talk and collaborate since it was not forbidden by the rules. "White," assigns nicknames based on hair color and skin color: Black, White, Brown, Blonde, Brunette, and Dark, and Deaf for the one candidate who does not speak or respond to the group. The few times Deaf communicates, it's in French and is confusing to the other members of the group. In the next proceeding hour, the candidates use the lights, their bodily fluids, and fire sprinklers in attempts to reveal hidden text on their papers to no avail. The group members speculate about the purpose of the exam and the nature of the company whose identity is shrouded in mystery. Dark pipes up by saying that the CEO is highly secretive and has not been seen since the [[IPO]]. Slowly, it is revealed that this company is responsible for a miracle drug designed to treat a condition that afflicts a large part of the population due to a viral [[pandemic]]. In the chaos, White takes control of the group and engineers the disqualifications of Brunette and Deaf for spoiled papers.  White then taunts the others, saying he has figured out the question but will not tell them. Black punches White in the face, knocking him unconscious and ties him to a chair. As White passes out, he pleads for his medication, implying he has the virus, but some of them do not believe him. Brown then turns his attention to Dark, who demonstrates a lot of knowledge about the internal workings of the company, and eventually tortures her into revealing that she works for the company. It is revealed that Brown is a carrier of the disease. White then goes into convulsions, proving he has the disease. Dark pleads to the Invigilator for help and is disqualified.  Blonde retrieves the medication for White, which was stolen from him earlier by Brown, reviving him. The others release him, demanding to know the question. White suggests that there is no question and the company is going to hire the last remaining candidate. Black steals the guard's gun, but it requires the guard's fingerprint ID, giving White time to retrieve it. White forces Brown to leave the room at gunpoint, disqualifying him. He forces Blonde to leave; as she exits the room she turns off the voice-activated lights, allowing Black to attack White.  The lights come back on after Black is struck by a gunshot. Blonde is hiding in the hallway, still holding one foot inside the room, technically not having left the room. Before White can kill her, the exam timer runs to zero. White then addresses the Invigilator, sure of his success, but he is disqualified. It is revealed that Deaf had earlier set the countdown forward by a few minutes. Blonde then remembers that Deaf had been using glasses and a piece of broken glass with an exam paper earlier. Taking the abandoned glasses, she finds the phrase "Question 1." on the exam paper in minuscule writing.  Blonde then realizes that Question 1 refers to the only question asked of the group by the Invigilator at the beginning of the test ("Any questions?"). She answers "No." The Invigilator then enters and reveals that Deaf is actually the CEO of the company and a scientist rather than a businessman or administrator. Deaf's research had found the virus cure, but also discovered a method of rapid cell regeneration which is capable of curing both the virus and many other "stubborn mutations", literally "the gift of life" for millions of people. The bullet that hit Black contained this cure, and he awakens healed. With the desperate need for the drug and a limited supply at any one time, the company needed an administrator capable of making tough decisions with an attention to detail while showing compassion for her fellow man, all traits that Blonde had displayed during the exam. Blonde eagerly accepts her new job.

Extraordinary Women
 The women all candidly speak about the hardships they have been through, about their present and what they expect for the future. Gladys Gutiérrez fought against the [[Joaquín Balaguer]] regime along with her husband Henry Segarra. After her spouse mysteriously disappeared, she was exiled and was relocated to [[Paris]], [[France]]; and there she kept being vocal about her disapproval of the Dominican government. Because of this, she was subjected to many death threats after her fellow militants were murdered.  Josefina Padilla was the first woman candidate for Dominican Vice presidency. Before that she was one of the most notable opponents in [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s dictatorship, which resulted in her harassment from government officials, and the murder of her husband 'Papito' Sánchez.  Tomasina Cabral was brutally tortured during Trujillo's regime, she was the only known woman to have been subjected to that treatment at that time. She was also the friend who accompanied the [[Mirabal Sisters]] through their time in jail.

The loss of her mother at 17, and her marriage shortly after; how she fell ill from depression, tuberculosis and anorexia after a long period of work excess and fasting so she could be able to feed her children.  
Eyeborgs
  The movie opens by explaining current events such as the passing of the "Freedom of Observation Act" and the subsequent implementation of ODIN (Optical Defense Intelligence Network), including the development of a new type of mobile camera drone, the eponymous "eyeborg". The system is administered by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS).  Sankur (Dale Girard) is making a deal to purchase a shotgun while an eyeborg watches the transaction. The eyeborg is discovered and the deal is aborted. Homeland Security agents rush in to find that Sankur has escaped and the other party in the gun deal is dead.  Brandon (Devin McGee), the lead singer of a band known as "Painful Daze", is in a car with a girl. "G-Man" ([[Danny Trejo]]), approaches them to deliver a rare bag of banned [[North Carolina]] [[tobacco]].  After G-Man leaves, the two begin smoking the tobacco - but are interrupted and killed by a large six-armed eyeborg.  With Brandon missing, Jarett ([[Luke Eberl]]) becomes the lead singer of "Painful Daze" at the next night's gig.  As he sings, eyeborgs search for Sankur, who has entered the building.  They signal an alarm that causes a panic, during which Sankur tries to shoot Jarett.  An  eyeborg blocks the shot. Jarett falls, unharmed, but breaks his guitar. It is revealed that Jarett is the [[President of the United States|President]]'s nephew.  Sankur is captured and taken to the regional DHS office.  During interrogation, Sankur is shown video footage of his earlier gun deal, showing him to be the dealer's killer.  Sankur protests his innocence despite the apparent proof of the video.  Agent Gunner ([[Adrian Paul]]) gets a message to report to the front desk, leaves the room with his partner, and locks the door. Four eyeborg security cameras detach to attack Sankur, but the door opens, allowing him to escape.  A  foot chase occurs, stranding him on level six. When the elevator he is waiting for opens, a large eyeborg emerges and pushes him over the [[banister]], causing him to fall to his death.  Jarett and Ronni (Julie Horner) are making out when the news is announced that the President has declared war on the (fictional) country of Zimbekistan, which catches Ronni's attention. She shows Jarett a bank error where a large sum of money has been deposited in their account from Zimbekistan.  Back at the regional DHS office, Agent Gunner comes under fire over security footage showing that he failed to lock Sankur's door. Meanwhile, Barbara ([[Megan Blake]]) (newswoman) and Eric (Juan-Carlos Guzman) (cameraman), who earlier witnessed Sankur's death, find a video file in Sankur's apartment. Meanwhile, Jarett goes to G-Man, whose face is finally revealed, and asks him to fix his guitar. During their meeting they discuss the eyeborgs, which Jarett approves of and which G-Man doesn't trust.  Eric analyzes the video from Sankur's apartment and calls Barbara to tell her the video file is fake. En route in a news van to give her the evidence, he is attacked by a new type of eyeborg. It force feeds him a bottle of whiskey and causes him to crash, attempting to make it look like the result of drunk driving. While he manages to get out of the news van alive, he is immolated by a flamethrower carried by the eyeborg that attacked him. Barbara is notified of the wreck and, when told that he was drunk at the time of the accident, she doesn't believe it. Shortly thereafter, G-Man is attacked and killed by a large eyeborg. Jarett arrives and is momentarily pinned to the ground by the escaping eyeborg, after which he finds G-Man's body. He tells Gunner what he saw, but video of the alley shows a human leaving G-Man's place rather than an eyeborg.  Growing increasingly suspicious, Gunner asks Jarett to meet him and tells him that he believes that Jarett did see an eyeborg leaving the scene of G-Man's murder, and that he suspects that the system is compromised and that the President may be in danger. He asks Jarett for help in warning the President, since Jarett has been asked to play at the President's campaign debate. While Jarett is out, Ronni is attacked by two eyeborgs and manages to call him, but the call is cut short. When he arrives, he finds her dead, with her wrists slit as though she has committed suicide.  Jim Bradley (John S. Rushton) and Gunner go back to G-Man's to see if they missed anything. They find a secret room containing plans for weapon-carrying eyeborgs, plus a malleable [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] variant which was formed into the [[pickguard]] on Jarett's guitar. They try to leave to warn the President that Jarett's guitar is a bomb but Jim is killed by an eyeborg, which Gunner manages to disable. Gunner gets to the [[Millennium Center]], where the Presidential debate is being held. But when he arrives on stage, there is no President or crowd present. He realizes that the President is dead, and that ODIN is in control and has been using Presidential power to declare war so that it can spread.  A group of warbots shows up and begins firing on the DHS agents. Barbara is run into by her new camera bot, but she tells Gunner where he can find Jarett. Gunner and his team manage to free Jarett, whose likeness is being scanned for use by ODIN, just as two newer and more deadly eyeborgs attack and kill all but Jarett, Gunner, and Barbara. As Gunner is leaving with Jarett, Barbara gives him the only video evidence of what happened at the Millennium Center. Too injured to leave herself, she shoots the eyeborgs to distract them before shooting the guitar, detonating it and the barrels of flammable liquid in the basement, destroying the Millennium Center.  With the explosion of the Millennium Center broadcast on national television, the President is considered dead. The news shows the vice-president being sworn in, and in an address to the public declares Jarett a traitor and shows video of him detonating his guitar in the debates, killing the President and all in attendance. Gunner goes to see Jarett, who is alive and disguised as an [[altar boy]], and tells him that Barbara's video has gone viral and even ODIN cannot stop it.  The movie ends with Gunner shooting an eyeborg in an alley and declaring he does not need their eyes anymore.

Fanboys (film)
 On October 31, 1998, Eric Bottler reunites with his old high school buddies Linus, Hutch, Windows, and Zoe at a Halloween party. There is tension between Bottler and his old friends, due to Bottler being the only one that matured since high school. Bottler, now a car salesman at his father's dealership, finds that his friends have not changed a bit since high school: the number one thing they still have in common is their love of ''[[Star Wars]]''. The gang expresses their anticipation for the latest installment to the franchise, ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''. Linus proposes an idea that Bottler and he had been plotting since they were children, to infiltrate [[Skywalker Ranch]] and steal a [[rough cut]] of the film, but Bottler dismisses it.  The next day, Hutch and Windows meet Bottler at work and inform him that Linus is dying from cancer. The doctors estimate that he only has roughly four months to live; ''Episode I'' comes out in six. To make peace with his former best friend, Bottler decides to go through with their plan and infiltrate Skywalker Ranch. The four begin their trip to Texas, where they have to meet Rogue Leader, a girl Windows is having an online relationship with, for information on getting into the Ranch. While on the road, Hutch decides to take a detour to [[Riverside, Iowa]] (the future birthplace of [[James T. Kirk|Captain James T. Kirk]]) in an attempt to start a fight with some [[Trekkie]]s. Hutch gets his wish after attacking a Trekkie by the name of Admiral Seasholtz ([[Seth Rogen]]) in retaliation to Seasholtz insulting [[Han Solo]], to which Hutch responds by running down their statue of Captain Kirk and [[Khan Noonien Singh|Khan]].  The boys' van breaks down and they stumble upon a biker bar. Once inside they ask for help and a glass of water that costs $100. Hutch, refusing to pay, tries to pass himself off as a tough guy who just got out of prison, only to discover that they are in a gay bar. In order to pay for the drink they are forced to become the "midnight entertainment" and strip to the music of [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], which goes terribly wrong when Hutch displays his one testicle. They are saved by a man named "The Chief," who fixes their van after they pass out from eating guacamole laced with [[peyote]]. He gives a bag of it to Linus as a parting gift.  After arriving in Texas, Windows meets Rogue Leader, who to his horror is a 10-year-old girl. The group is then assaulted by her uncle, [[Harry Knowles]], who beats up Windows and tells him to never talk to his niece again. After explaining their situation, Harry quizzes them to prove they are true fanboys, then gives them information on one of his contacts that knows how to successfully enter Skywalker Ranch. They are told to meet Harry's contact in [[Las Vegas]], but on their way there they are arrested for fleeing a police vehicle and possession of peyote. Zoe arrives to bail them out of jail, and - having traveled halfway across the country to get them - insists on accompanying them on their journey. Eric is reluctant to continue when the judge ([[Billy Dee Williams]]) gives him a message from his father to come home or lose his job, but the others convince him to carry on by calling the journey their "Death Star", the one great thing that will live with them forever. Once in Vegas, Hutch and Windows attempt to have sex with some girls while Bottler and Linus go to meet Harry's contact. They are shocked to find that his contact is none other than [[William Shatner]], who gives them the information they need and leaves. As they leave they are attacked by Seasholtz and his Trekkie friends, who were attending a ''[[Star Trek]]'' convention in the same hotel. Meanwhile, Hutch and Windows discover that the girls they were with are [[Call girl|escort girls]] and flee when their angry pimp, Roach (also played by [[Seth Rogen]]), wants them to pay up. Windows also learns that Zoe is in love with him.  The group escapes their adversaries but Linus is injured in the process. When taken to the hospital, Linus is informed by a doctor ([[Carrie Fisher]]) that he must return home for the sake of his health. When the group feels the situation has become hopeless, Eric refuses to give up on their plan and manages to inspire the gang to continue, reminding them that ''Star Wars'' means very much not just to Linus, but to all of them. The group leaves the hospital and eventually makes it to Skywalker Ranch. Shortly after breaking into the ranch and marveling at the collection of original props and costumes used in the films, they are discovered by security guards and are caught after a brief chase. The Head of Security tells them of their impending doom when he receives a phone call from [[George Lucas]] himself. Lucas tells him that he will drop all charges if they can prove to him that they are "[[Fan (person)|fanboys]]". The five are individually quizzed, including questions designed to show that they do not know much about the opposite sex (of which only Zoe is able to answer), after which the Head of Security confirms that they are fanboys and Lucas drops all charges. Being aware of Linus's illness, Lucas allows him to watch the film alone while his friends wait outside. After the film ends, Bottler joins his friends around a campfire and mends his friendship with Linus. Weeks later, Linus dies of his illness.  On May 19, 1999, Bottler, Windows and Zoe emerge from their tent they used to camp out in while waiting in line for the first showing of ''Episode I''. Bottler has followed his and Linus's dream by becoming a comic book artist, Hutch has finally started his own [[Auto detailing|detailing business]], and Windows and Zoe are now in a relationship. Hutch arrives at the theater with beers he smuggled in, which they use to toast Linus's memory. Just before the film starts, Bottler comments, "What if the movie sucks?"  
Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)
 While raiding Berk's [[squab (food)|Squab]] Farm, Mr. Fox and his wife Felicity trigger a fox trap and become caged. Felicity reveals to Fox that she is pregnant and pleads with him to find a safer job if they escape. Fox reluctantly agrees.  Two years later, the Foxes and their sullen son Ash are living in a hole. Fox, now a newspaper columnist, moves the family into a better home in the base of a tree, ignoring the warnings of his lawyer Badger about how dangerous the area is for foxes. The tree is located very close to facilities run by three farmers: Walter Boggis, Nathan Bunce, and Franklin Bean.  Soon after the Foxes move in, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson Silverfox comes to live with them, as his father has fallen ill with double pneumonia. Ash finds this situation intolerable; his soft-spoken cousin is apparently superior to him at almost everything, and everyone–including Fox and Ash's female fox friend, Agnes–is charmed by Kristofferson at Ash's expense. Longing for his days as a thief, Fox and his friend Kylie Opossum steal produce and poultry from the three farms.  Angered, the farmers decide to kill Fox. They camp out near his home. When Fox emerges, the farmers open fire, but only shoot off his tail. They then attempt to dig Fox out. After demolishing the site of the tree, the farmers discover the Foxes have dug an escape tunnel. Reasoning that the Foxes will have to surface for food and water eventually, the farmers wait at the tunnel mouth. Underground, Felicity is upset that Fox returned to his thieving ways. The group later encounters Badger and many other local animal residents whose homes have also been destroyed by the farmers. As the animals begin fearing starvation, Fox leads them on a digging expedition to tunnel to the three farms, robbing them clean.  While the other animals feast, Ash and Kristofferson begin to reconcile after Kristofferson defends Ash from a bully. The cousins return to Franklin's farm, intending to reclaim Mr. Fox's tail. When they are interrupted by the arrival of Franklin's wife, Ash escapes, but Kristofferson is captured. Discovering that Fox has stolen their produce, the farmers flood the animals' tunnel network with cider.  The flood forces the animals into the sewers, trapping them. Fox learns that the farmers plan to use Kristofferson to lure him into an ambush and heads to the surface to surrender, which would mean his demise. The animals are confronted by Rat, Franklin's security guard, who attacks Ash and Felicity. Hearing his son's cries, Fox returns and fights Rat in an electrical room until Fox pushes him into an electric generator, electrocuting him. Before dying, Rat confesses Kristofferson's location. Fox asks the farmers for a meeting in town near the sewer hub where he would surrender in exchange for Kristofferson's freedom. The farmers set up an ambush, but Fox and the others anticipate it and launch a counterattack.  Fox, Ash, and Kylie slip into Franklin's farm. Ash frees Kristofferson and braves enemy fire to release a rabid [[beagle]] named Spitz to keep the farmers at bay. The animals become accustomed to living in the sewers with others considering moving in. Ash and Kristofferson settle their differences and become good friends. Fox leads his family, Kylie, and Agnes to a drain opening built into the floor of a supermarket owned by the three farmers.  Celebrating their new food source and the news that Felicity is pregnant again, the animals dance.  
Fame (2009 film)
  ===Auditions=== During the opening scenes in auditions and orientation, it is told that in 1936, New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia founded the High School of Music & Art in order to provide a facility where the most gifted and talented public school students of New York City could pursue their talents in art or music, while also completing a full academic program of instruction. In 1948, the School of Performing Arts (P.A.) was created to provide training in performance skills to students who wished to prepare for professional careers in dance, music or drama.  ===Freshman year=== Students learn on the first day of classes that their teachers expect them to know everything. In dance class, the teacher Ms. Kraft is worried about Kevin's dancing, but is easily impressed by Alice.  In acting class, Jenny feels uncomfortable to let loose and be crazy like everyone else. In music class, Mr. Cranston gives Victor pointers, while Denise plays the music perfectly on the piano.  In the lunchroom, everyone practices their major and they all get up and dance ('This Is My Life'), while Denise and Malik escape the madness and they talk to each other, Denise saying that her uptight and conservative parents thinks that the school is "people sitting around, practicing cello all day", and that they would die if they saw this. Malik reveals that his mother doesn't even know that he is coming to the school because she works three jobs and would never notice.  Just before freshman year ends, it shows Malik at his apartment, his mother finding his report card, making it clear that he goes to Performing Arts. She is angry but he continues to go to the school. The year closes after she goes to work and leaves Malik standing alone.  ===Sophomore year=== As the new school year begins, it shows the dancers all practicing in a circle, but once it is Kevin's turn, he is out-shined and is forced to go back in his original spot.  In music class, Victor is having trouble sticking to the right music, and adds his own spin on whatever he is playing, which doesn't sit well with Mr. Cranston.  In theater class, Malik talks about his dead sister, Ayanna, causing Mr. Dowd to ask questions that he refuses to answer. Malik then leaves, stating that he's going to be famous, no matter what anyone else says.  Meanwhile, Denise is playing her classical piano, but then starts to sing, assuming she is alone. ('Out Here on My Own') When she leaves, it is revealed to the audience that Malik was watching the whole time. He brings her to Victor and convinces her to sing for the album that they are producing. She agrees to it, as long as her strict father doesn't find out.  At a Halloween party, Malik plays the song, but says the vocals are "anonymous", upsetting Denise, which confuses Malik. Later, Joy is in Central Park drinking beer. She gets up and does a rap, vomiting at the end of it. Neil captures this in his documentary and presents it to the class. Marco asks Jenny out on a date (though not for the first time). She agrees to go with him to dinner at his father's restaurant, where she convinces him to play a song and sing on the piano. He does ('Try'), and she gives him a money tip. The sophomore year ends with them kissing.  ===Junior year=== Joy has another audition, but is annoyed, because the other girls competing against her always seem to get the part. Neil says that he is meeting with a producer for a short, independent film he wrote and hopes to direct himself.  Meanwhile, Marco and Jenny go to a party, where Jenny sees a guy named Andy Matthews, a former P.A. student who claims to be a professional actor and known player. He tells her that he can have her meet with his agent, and the naive Jenny gives him her cell phone number. Marco leaves, having seen the last part, and Jenny runs out after him. They have a minor fight, but she promises that she will never talk to Andy again, and they go back to her house.  Victor, Malik, and Denise meet with a man from a record company, who says that their demo is interesting, and he will play it at the next meeting and get back to them. Victor and Malik are overjoyed, but Denise is still hesitant. At the next meeting, the producer tells them that Denise is the reason he was interested in their music. He tries to persuade her to stay.  Joy tells Jenny and Neil that she got a part-time acting job on 'Sesame Street' and is very excited about it. Ms. Rowan, the voice teacher, takes some of the students to a karaoke bar where she ends up singing as well. Jenny goes to meet Andy despite what she said to Marco. When she arrives, Andy tells her the director is out sick. He comes onto her, but she stops him and angrily leaves. She tells Marco, and he asks if Andy tried anything, saying that he knew this would happen and that if fame was really that important to her then he hopes she gets the job. He then leaves her sobbing his name on a rooftop.  Neil tries to get his equipment for the movie, but when he tries to find his producer, he is discovered to be gone, along with the $5,000.  ===Senior year=== Kevin ([[Paul McGill]]) has a meeting with Ms. Kraft, the dance teacher, because he asked her to write him a letter of recommendation. She says she can not write him the letter, because she believes he is not talented enough to become a professional dancer. Meanwhile, as they talk, Alice is dancing to ('Black and Gold') practicing her jazz piece. This conversation with Ms. Kraft causes him to attempt suicide by stepping in front of a subway car. Joy, Rosie, and Jenny are there to stop him.  Victor is told by his girlfriend, Alice, that she is going on a world tour next week. He asks if she will visit him, but she says that after P.A. couples usually go their separate ways.  Joy drops out of school before graduation because she is working on 'Sesame Street' full-time now and her grades have suffered.  Malik talks with Mr. Dowd about his father, which leads to Mr. Dowd telling him about breaking down his walls. Victor, Malik and Denise put on a hip-hop concert at a club at which her parents are at, but Denise told them it was classical jazz because of her father's wishes for her to pursue classical piano and not vocals. Despite this, she defies her father and goes on anyway and wins over her mother during the performance. Marco, along with Neil, Joy, and Rosie, is there to watch but when he sees Jenny come in, he says he has to go. Jenny stops him from leaving, saying that she's been thinking a lot about him, and that it kills her that she hurt him.  Later, during the concert, he puts his arms around her and they smile at each other. When Denise leaves with her parents, her father is outraged and tells her that he is pulling her out of P.A., even though she is about to graduate. Her mom stops him and says that if Denise wants to sing, she should sing.  ===Graduation=== Before graduation, Jenny gives a speech about success to the graduating class, saying that she felt it when she was in the school. Kevin tells Joy that he is moving back to Iowa (following the advice Ms. Kraft gave to him), and that he is going to be "the best god damn dance teacher there ever was". During the graduation performance, everybody participates ('Hold Your Dream'), with Denise as the main singer. It ends with all the characters following graduating (except Joy and Alice).  
Farewell (2009 film)
 In the early 1980s, a high-ranking [[KGB]] analyst, Sergei Grigoriev, disillusioned with the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] regime, decides to pass Soviet secrets, including a list of Soviet spies, to the government of France, then under the newly elected President [[François Mitterrand]], a [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] in coalition with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]. Grigoriev (code-named ''Farewell'' by the [[Direction de la surveillance du territoire|French intelligence service]]) hopes to force change in the Soviet Union by revealing their extensive network of spies trying to acquire scientific, technical and industrial information from the West.  He uses Pierre Froment, a naïve French engineer based in [[Moscow]], as his unlikely intermediary. After the first transfer of information, Pierre confides in his wife Jessica, who is adamant about his stopping to preserve their family. Grigoriev persuades Pierre to continue without telling Jessica.  He will accept neither money nor [[defection]] as a reward, but sometimes requests small gifts from Pierre's trips to France, such as a [[Sony Walkman]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] cassette tapes for his son, some [[Cognac (brandy)|cognac]], or books of French poetry.  As Farewell's prodigious output blossoms, the French are bewildered by the sheer scale and yield of top Western technology transferred covertly to the Soviets.  Under suspicion that he is not a trustworthy ally, Mitterrand personally hands U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] a [[Farewell Dossier|dossier of invaluable Farewell data]] during the [[7th G7 summit|Ottawa summit]].  The Americans are astounded with it and other information provided by Farewell, culminating in the full "List X" of Soviet spies within the highest echelons of the Western scientific and industrial apparatus.  They embark on an ambitious plan to feed the Soviets erroneous or defective data; shortly after, the network of Soviet technology spies in the West is rolled up, and Reagan announces the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|"Star Wars" antimissile shield project]].

Dominic suspects that the police are on their trail, forcing the crew to disband and go their separate ways, with Han deciding to go to Tokyo. Realizing that he must leave, Dominic runs, leaving Letty behind to protect her from harm.  Three months later, Dominic is now residing in [[Panama City]]. He gets a call from his sister, Mia Toretto, who tells him that Letty has been murdered. Dominic heads back to Los Angeles to attend her funeral and examine the crash and finds traces of [[nitromethane]] on the ground. He visits the only car mechanic that sells nitromethane in LA and forces him into giving him the name David Park, the man who ordered the fuel, and informs him that the only car that uses nitromethane in the area is a green 1972 [[Ford Gran Torino]] Sport.  Meanwhile, [[FBI]] agent [[Brian O'Conner]] is trying to track down a Mexican drug lord, Arturo Braga. His search leads him to David Park, and he tracks him down using an illegal modification record on his car. Dominic arrives at Park's apartment first and hangs him out of the window by his ankles before Brian arrives. Brian saves Park and Park becomes the FBI's new informant. Park gets Brian into a [[Street racing|street race]]. Brian selects a [[Modified car|modified]] 2002 [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]] R34<ref>[http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_239575-Nissan-Skyline-GT-R-R34-2002.html/ 2002 Nissan Skyline GT-R &#91;R34&#93;]</ref> from the impound lot. Dominic races in his modified 1970 [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] SS 454. [[Gisele Yashar]], the liaison for Braga, reveals that the winner will become the last driver on a team that traffics [[heroin]] between the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Dominic wins by bumping Brian's car while it is in nitro, making him lose control. Brian uses his power as an FBI agent to arrest another driver, Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team.  The team meets up with Braga's personal henchman, Fenix, and Dominic notices that Fenix drives the same Torino the mechanic described. They drive across the border using underground tunnels to avoid detection. Brian has prior knowledge that after the heroin was delivered, Braga ordered the drivers to be killed. Upon discovering this, Dominic confronts Fenix and learns that he himself killed Letty when she tried to escape him. A stand-off ensues, though not before Dominic creates a diversion by loosening his car with nitrous &ndash; sparking a vehicle explosion that destroys his car and several others, including Brian's. In the ensuing chaos, Dominic and Brian hijack a 1999 [[Hummer H1]] with $60 million worth of heroin in it. Dominic and Brian drive back to LA and hide the heroin in a police impound lot, where Brian picks up a modified [[Subaru Impreza]] WRX STI Hatchback; they subsequently drive back to Dominic's house, where they reunite with Mia.  Dominic finds out Brian was the last person to contact Letty, which results in Dominic attacking Brian until Brian explains that Letty was working undercover - she was tracking down Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's record. Brian tells his superiors that in exchange for Dominic's pardon, he will lure Braga into a trap, forcing him to show up to exchange money for the heroin. At the drop site, the man who claims to be "Braga" is revealed as a decoy, and "Campos" &ndash; the real Braga &ndash; escapes with Fenix and the pair flee to [[Mexico]]. In the ensuing chaos, Fenix nearly runs over Gisele, before Dom saves her.  Brian and Dominic travel to Mexico to catch Braga, with the help of Gisele, who gives them directions as a favored return for Dom saving her life. Brian and Dom find him at a church and apprehend him. As Braga's henchmen try to rescue him, Brian and Dominic drive through the underground tunnels back to the United States. Brian crashes his car after taking fire from Braga's men. He is then injured after being [[side collision|T-boned]] by Fenix. Before Fenix can kill Brian, Dominic drives into and kills Fenix. As police and helicopters approach the crash site on the American side of the border, Brian tells Dominic to leave, but Dominic refuses &ndash; saying he is not running anymore. Despite Brian's request for clemency, the judge sentences Dominic to 25 years to life. Brian resigns from the FBI and Dominic boards a prison bus that will transport him to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc|Lompoc penitentiary]]. As the bus drives down the road, Brian, Mia, Leo, and Santos arrive in their cars to intercept it.  
Feast III: The Happy Finish
 Honey Pie is mauled and beheaded by a monster who quickly digests and excretes her head. Lightning survived the explosion near him and stumbles off. The remaining survivors (Biker Queen, Tat Girl, Tit Girl, Secrets, Bartender, Slasher and Greg now with a pipe lodged in his head) are then attacked by monsters on the roof of the building they are hiding on. Thunder is seen still alive and crawling away after being disemboweled, but is run over by a man named Shitkicker.  Shitkicker smashes open the front door of the police station and enters. The rooftop survivors make their way to the jail, where Hobo attempts to kill them, but literally gets beaten by the biker girls, spreading all over his legs. Greg reveals that Slasher has a lot of used cars that the survivors can use to escape. Shitkicker is accidentally shot in the head by Secrets. The gunshot alerts the monsters, who enter the police station. The group then decides to run to the used car lot.  Once they exit, Slasher runs a different way from the group, and then trips Hobo as a distraction for the monsters. While a monster begins to eat one of Hobo's legs, Slasher runs towards a metal storage unit. The monster lets the shit ridden Hobo go and resumes to go after Slasher, who is joined by Tat and Tit Girl of the biker women. Inside the unit, they meet about a dozen survivors who proceed to gang up and beat Slasher for ripping them off with his car deals. Slasher moves to the back of the unit and stands against the back wall. A monsters spots a hole Slasher is standing in front of and uses the hole to rape Slasher, [[Traumatic insemination|impregnating]] him. A monster then immediately bursts through Slasher's stomach, giving birth to a Slasher hybrid, killing the dozen survivors inside the unit. Meanwhile, Secrets, Greg and Bartender find the wounded Lightning and take him with them. Biker Queen frees the biker girls and they run from the Slasher/Monster Hybrid. They follow Hobo down a hole, in an attempt to hide inside his buried school bus/meth lab.  A monster follows them and kills Tat Girl. Biker Queen is finally able to get the bus started and as they leave, Tit girl sets the Hobo and a monster on fire who then fall out the back of the bus. The bus emerges from underground with Biker Queen and Tit Girl intending to abandon the remaining survivors, however the bus dies just as the other survivors catch up. The monsters immediately swarm the bus, but the group is saved by a man named Short Bus Gus, who seemingly has the ability to repel the monsters. He then leads the survivors into the sewers in an attempt to reach the big city. While working their way through the sewers, Tit Girl is killed by infected townies. The survivors are about to be killed by the infected until another survivor known as Jean Claude Segal saves them. Jean Claude tries to lead the survivors to the surface when he is attacked by a monster and has one of his arms bitten off. The survivors are then separated into two groups, Jean Claude and Bartender, and Biker Queen, Secrets, Greg, Lightning and Short Bus Gus. While trying to cauterize one of Jean Claude's wounds, Bartender accidentally blows off his remaining arm.  The other group of survivors finds the Hive, which is a gigantic rave with infected townies and monsters who spew their vomit on the people, causing horrible mutation and insanity. The survivors are reunited but are spotted by an infected townie and Biker Queen is infected. Jean Claude volunteers to stay behind to fight off infected townies to give the survivors a chance to escape. Jean Claude manages to fend off the infected townies for a short while before being ripped in half.  Short Bus Gus finds out that it has been his malfunctioning hearing aid that has been repelling the monsters and is impaled by a monster. The Slasher monster finally catches up with the group and kills the attacking monster and then forcibly removes the pipe lodged in Greg's head, killing him. Secrets is insane with grief and savagely attacks the Slasher Hybrid, killing him with the same pipe that was lodged in Greg's head.  Biker Queen takes off with one of the monsters, setting off its internal alarm system in an attempt to draw the monsters away from the remaining survivors. Bartender tells Secrets and Lightning that they are the only survivors left and that they have to repopulate now. Secrets looks up just as the foot of a giant robot crushes her, as well as Lightning, and walks away. Bartender slowly walks towards the camera and murmurs, "Goddamn it".  
Fear Island

After three years together in college, a group of friends, Kyle, Tyler, Ashley, Jenna and Mark meet for a weekend getaway at brothers Kyle and Tyler's family cabin on a secluded island for one last party before they go their separate ways.  Minutes after arriving on the island, a stowaway, Megan, reveals herself.  Soon after, the group gets down to partying, drinking, and fooling around.  Ashley and Kyle are in the hot tub, while Tyler and Megan are inside doing Tequila shots.  Jenna, upset that Mark tagged along at the last minute goes to the dock alone, where Mark finds her to try and set up a truce. Meanwhile, someone is watching Tyler give Megan shots and then Tyler gives Ashley's little dog Tequila in a bowl.  Tyler later lets the tipsy dog outside alone, and makes his move on Megan who is willing but says she hasn't done it before as she is only 15.  Tyler changes his mind, apologizes and says he was mistaken to try and seduce her.  Tyler goes outside to find Ashley and Kyle have discovered blood in their ice bucket and are freaking out.  The next day Ashley is looking for her dog when she finds a body—Keith's, with the word Evil written on his shirt. Tyler shares that Keith is not really the caretaker, but Tyler and Kyle's half-brother and they discover the boat is missing, the only way to leave the island. The guys go to take down Keith's body but it's missing, and the girls look for her dog. While they are split up, Ashley thinks she hears her dog in the hot tub and goes in to find him. The killer locks her in the tub and she boils to death. When the others meet up again they find her body in the locked hot tub.  They decide to put Ashley's body in the freezer and find walkie talkies that still work, when they return to the house they find a wind-up toy on the deck, and the word Innocent written on the patio door.  They then hear something toward the woods. Kyle goes alone to check it out and steps in a bear trap, the others get him free of the trap and they take him back inside. Megan offers to stay with Kyle.  Meanwhile, as they settle down for the night, Tyler gets a nail gun for protection, Jenna gets a knife, and Mark has a bat.  Jenna thinks she saw the killer outside and when they go out to check but don't see him, Tyler recommends they go inside to get some sleep.  Through the night they wake up when the lights go out and discover Kyle has disappeared. Tyler goes out to the deck armed with his nail gun but a tree is set on fire, causing him to stumble backward and drop the nailgun. Tyler scrambles back in the house and is told his brother Kyle is missing, just then the killer begins to shoot nails from the nail gun, and Tyler is hit. While they are taking the nails out of Tyler, they hear Kyle calling for help. Tyler wants to go but Mark holds him back.  The next day the four hear on a walkie talkie that Kyle is being tortured and realize the background noises are coming from the dock.  They all run to the dock but only find the other walkie talkie. Kyle kept saying 'Atonement' over and over on the walkie when they heard him being tormented. Jenna writes down the words they've found written around the house and murders, thinking they are an anagram, they make a few guesses, until Tyler says "Regina". Tyler tells Mark, Megan, and Jenna how he met a girl Regina and brought her out to a party and when she got drunk, he slept with her and video-taped it. He said she had regrets, but insisted that she left.  They go to the caretaker's cabin and on the table is a mound of dirt and a play shovel.  They ask Tyler what really happened, so he tells them that Regina had tried to leave his bed, but he grabbed her arm, she was still drunk and she fell and hit her head, dying instantly. Tyler says he and Kyle buried her body on the other side of the island but no one else knew.  Now they wonder if she has come back from the dead, and demand Tyler dig up her body, but when he does he finds Kyle.  Meanwhile,  Megan says that she isn't part of this and runs back to the house, where she calls the others with the walkie talkie that the killer is after her, and that it's Keith.  Tyler runs to the house, trying to find the killer, but a snake hidden in a kitchen cabinet bites him in the chest. Jenna and Mark try to help him, but the venom takes effect quickly and he dies in front of them.  Feeling helpless, Jenna confesses that she remembers seeing Tyler with Regina, and Kyle joining the two in bed, she says she could have stopped them while Regina was drunk, but she didn't.  Mark and Jenna search the house for Megan and think they've found her, but the wrapped up body turns out to be Regina's dug up body.   Suddenly they run into Keith in the house, who grabs Jenna hostage, with a knife; he is the killer. Keith reveals that he knew about what Kyle and Tyler did to Regina and that he watched them bury Regina.  Mark and Keith battle. They fall together off the balcony but Mark breaks his neck.  Keith chases Jenna through the woods until she is caught in a snare trap. He is about to kill her when Megan arrives, hits him with a shovel and kills him, saving Jenna. The two girls run to the boat (which is now at the dock). Megan wonders how their friends' parents or siblings will react. Jenna asks Megan if she has any siblings, she quietly answers that she had a sister, and Jenna realizes that Megan is Regina's sister. Megan pulls out the knife she used to cut Jenna down from the snare trap.  The scene cuts back to the hospital where Jenna has been telling her story to the detective and doctor, and declares she killed Megan in self-defense. The detective apologizes for accusing her of murder and Jenna leaves to her room with the doctor.  The doctor begins to ask Jenna about the oddities of her story while drinking a glass of soda Jenna gave her to celebrate her memory returning, but the soda is drugged with the sleeping pills that Jenna was stashing during her day at the hospital.  Meanwhile, Jenna's parents come into the interview room and see the picture of Megan on the board. They ask why their daughter's picture is displayed there. The detective is confused and the parents identify who he thought was a picture of Regina's sister Megan as their daughter Jenna. The Detective realizes that Jenna lied and that she (Duff) is indeed actually Megan, Regina's sister. During the retelling of the story, Megan had switched her name with that of Jenna (Hale) in the flashbacks, which represented the story as she had been telling it. The detective races to Jenna/Megan's hospital room to find the doctor in the bed, alive but unconscious.  Meanwhile, Megan, dressed as the female doctor wearing sunglasses escapes the hospital using the doctor's car. She is last seen leaving the doctor's car on the side of a road and flagging down a stranger's car and introducing herself as Megan.

The next day, Samantha is leaving the [[hair salon|beauty salon]] when a rock propelled by a lawn mower is suddenly shot through her eye, killing her.

Having failed in his premonition, Nick runs back to the mall to stop the explosion before it occurs. He is pinned to a wall by a nail gun but manages to stop the fire before it spreads to several combustible barrels, saving everyone. Two weeks later, Nick notices a loose scaffold prop while heading into a café and warns a construction worker about it before going inside. While talking with Lori and Janet, he starts to see more omens and alludes the theory that his predictions were [[red herrings]] meant to lead them to where they needed to be for Death to strike. Just as he realizes this the scaffold outside collapses, causing a truck to swerve and crash into the coffee shop, killing all three of them. Janet is crushed under the tires, Lori is decapitated by the impact, and Nick is propelled into a wall, dislocating his jaw.

However, Sola fails to listen to rest of the tale (the disaster which follows the seven years) as he politely leaves the dean's office with disinterest.  Femi and Mona ([[Omoni Oboli]]) meet at the car park - She has been posted to Araromire as well; it is revealed here that they were once close friends. They both board a bus headed for Araromire. While in the bus, Mona is asleep and Femi brings out a ring; he stares at the ring and cuddles it while he stares at sleeping Mona. He is also seen cuddling the ring later at the camp.  Sola finally arrives at the NYSC orientation camp when the camp is almost over. While at the camp, out on an [[Backpacking (wilderness)|endurance trek]], Femi becomes drained and he stops in the woods to use his inhaler as he is an asthmatic patient. Sola also waits behind to help him out. While in the jungle, they begin to hear a strange sound which always comes up during camo parade. They both start to trace the sound and later discover a strange object on top of a tree that is emitting the sound. Rain starts to fall and they both find shelter in a mud house. Sola uses his lighter and starts to explore the place. The rain has stopped and Femi moves out of the building to get fresh air. Sola finds a figurine in an enclosed in a dusty wooden cradle. On the last day of Parade, Mona informs Femi that Sola proposed to her and she accepted. She also stated that she's carrying his baby. Femi seems jealous and tries to discourage Sola from getting married, but Sola declines. Sola brings out the figurine he found in the mud house and drops it on Femi's lap. Femi gets back from the NYSC only to see his father hale and hearty. He is also selected to go for a special training at his work place within just six months of his appointment. Sola gets a job as well and marries Mona.  Seven years later, Femi arrives from abroad and attends Sola's 'get-together'. Mona (who is pregnant again) introduces Femi to Linda ([[Funlola Aofiyebi]]), a fashion designer. Throughout the party, Femi pays no attention to her and keeps staring at Mona whom he is apparently still in love with. Lara (Tosin Sido), Femi's younger sister, now lives with Sola's family as Mona is helping her with her thesis. However, The Araromire figurine is still kept at Sola's. Femi's asthma has been cured miraculously as he smoked at the party.  Mona gets to know about the Araromire legend and she is worried; she begins to make conclusions and starts doubting the real source of the sudden wealth of the family. She also deduces that it may be the reason why her marriage with Sola has been so flawless, despite Sola having been a rascal and a Casanova back in school. She asks Lara to throw the figurine away but it returns into the house mysteriously. She then decides to throw it into the lagoon herself, she loses her pregnancy on her way to the lagoon. While dancing at the club with Linda, Femi gets an asthma attack again after so many years. Sola also starts having an affair with Ngozi again after so many years of being faithful to Mona, it is later discovered that he is having an affair with Lara as well and he also had an affair with Linda. Femi arrives at his apartment one day and sees his father dead in his crafts workshop. Both Femi and Sola eventually lose their jobs. Femi raises the topic of the figurine and suggests that they return it to the shrine; though Sola still doesn't believe the figurine is responsible for all the misfortune, he agrees. Junior (Tobe Oboli), Sola's first son, also dies by falling off from the building while trying to reach out to his mother — his father was having a big argument with his mum and the figurine was burnt. However, the figurine returns again. Then, Sola and Femi set out to return the figurine.  Mona, now in depression, sends Lara out of her house believing she let her son die (She was supposed to be with him at the time Junior had the accident). Lara's box opens up while she's struggling with Linda who is throwing her things out and also pushing her out of the compound. Lots of Figurines; similar to the one in Sola's study start to fall out of Lara's box. Apparently, she has been responsible for 'the return of the figurine' each time it was thrown out! She's called in and she starts to make confessions revealing that She is being controlled by her brother, Femi. Femi and Sola arrive at the Araromire Shrine to return the figurine; rain starts to fall and Femi is nowhere to be found. While Sola is busy looking for Femi, Femi kills him by hitting him with a log of wood. Femi returns to Lagos and he is confronted by Linda, whom Lara has already confessed to. Femi confirms the truth by revealing many things which proves that the whole Araromire good luck and bad luck was all a charade orchestrated by him in order to kill Sola and get Mona all to himself. He terms the losing of their jobs, his father's death and his asthma 'coincidence'. He kills Linda afterwards and dumps her body in the lagoon. On his way back, he has his asthma attack and commands Lara to bring him his inhaler, but she refuses; instead, she calls the 'Rapid Response Squad' to report her brother's killings. Femi struggles to get upstairs. He reaches out to the body of Mona, he removes Sola's ring from her finger and replaces it with his ring (which he was always staring at earlier). The Rapid Response Squad arrives and declares Femi dead.  Linda, Femi and Mona are later seen alive and the movie ends with the caption 'What do you believe'?<ref name="Naija Stories"></ref>

The morning after, Tel tells Dom that Bex is after them. The two then go to the local pub, the Lord Nelson, where the firm hangs out. There, Dom apologises for the two of them. Bex compliments Dom's courage, saying that he has a lot of guts to walk in and face him. Dom later finds out where Bex works and goes to visit him. They become acquaintances, visiting a sports shop where Bex purchases a pair of [[Adidas]] Munchen trainers. He then asks Dom if he wants to play in his football team. Dom accepts. Dom asks his Dad for money to buy the same pair of trainers.  Dom arrives late at the football game and is put in goal. After he saves a vital penalty, the rest of the boys begin to take a liking to him, especially Jay, who asks if he is coming to [[Portsmouth]] at the weekend. Dom agrees. Trigger, the firm's second-in-command, visits Bex at work, where he tells him that [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]'s firm and Portsmouth's firm are meeting to discuss the up-and-coming matches between the three teams. Bex walks in on the meeting to pitch his idea of the three firms coming together to form a national firm for the [[UEFA European Football Championship]]. The pitch fails, with Millwall and Portsmouth's top boys refusing to stand behind Bex in the national firm unless he and his firm can beat theirs in the upcoming meets. Saturday comes and the firm are at the station getting a train to Portsmouth. When they get there they meet the Portsmouth firm at the pub. Police arrive and try to break up the two teams. During the brawl, Dom is punched in the face but stays on his feet and punches back.  Bex visits Dom at work and tells him to not make any plans for the weekend. Dom sees Tel who criticises his tracksuit, but Dom tells him that he is part of the West Ham firm now. Dom later meets Jay, and the two go to the sports shop and steal a load of gear. Some of the firm go to Bex's house to talk about the possible national firm. Bex asks Dom if he would like to go to Europe, and Dom agrees. Bex says he has to get blooded first, which means he has to get the firm's symbol engraved on his forearm. Bex pulls out a Stanley knife and starts to engrave on Dom's arm. When the rest of the firm lick their hands and rub off the symbol that is on their arms he realises that it is a joke.  Dom goes to the Lord Nelson to meet up with the boys. Soon after arriving, he is harshly ridiculed in front of everyone by a drunken Trigger for wearing the same tracksuit as Bex. Feeling forlorn, Dom leaves the pub and doesn't go the game. Bex then visits him at work the next day and tells him to stand up for himself, and invites him to a night club. Dom also gets invited to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on the weekend, but the firm end up going to Millwall to launch a surprise attack on the Millwall firm instead. Millwall fights back with weapons and largely outnumbers them. As a result, the surprise attack fails and they suffer a humiliating defeat. Bex, along with Dom and some other members of the West Ham firm, go back later and ambush a Millwall fan as he leaves the pub, beating him half to death with lead pipes. They return home only to find that their cars have been smashed up. A calling card has been placed on Bex's car saying "Congratulations, you have just met the Yeti" (the [[Yeti]] is a nickname for the Millwall firm leader).  Some of the firm express that they are not happy with Bex's reckless leadership in refusing to back down over the feud with the Yeti, and are ultimately forced by Bex to leave the firm. When Bex brings a bag full of blunt weapons to the Lord Nelson in preparation for a revenge attack on the Yeti and his firm, Dom expresses his concerns as well. Bex reacts angrily, bullying and threatening Dom and telling him that he has no choice but to stay with the firm. They go from the Lord Nelson to London Bridge station and ambush the rival firm. Dom looks on as Bex overpowers the Yeti and kicks him savagely in the head and body repeatedly as he lies on the floor. As Bex walks away, the Yeti pulls a flick knife out of his sock and stabs Bex in the stomach. Off-screen, Bex eventually succumbs to the wound.  That night, the police are seen arriving at Bex's house. His wife answers the door angrily with the baby in her arms. From the police's silence, she knows Bex has been killed and tearfully goes into denial.  In the epilogue, Dom puts on the red tracksuit that Bex told him to never wear again, and heads to the Lord Nelson one last time. He looks through the window and sees that the firm are enjoying themselves and do not appear to be mourning Bex, with Trigger now seemingly in charge. Dom sees this as his chance to get out for good. He walks away from the pub and bumps into Tel. They both walk off exchanging jokes and following their old routine before Dom joined the firm.

Mia returns home to pack. Her mother tells her "go on then, fuck off" by way of a goodbye. Mia, for once not lashing back, silently joins Joanne in dancing to  [[Nas]]' "[[Life's a Bitch (song)|Life's a Bitch]]", matching her movements. Tyler joins them.

Agent Kelly is sent overseas to assist the [[Taiwan]] government's search for the killers.

The Fourth Kind
 [[Chapman University]] hosts a televised interview with [[Psychology|psychologist]] Abigail Tyler ([[Milla Jovovich]]/ [[Charlotte Milchard]]). She tells a story of a [[close encounter]] incident at [[Nome, Alaska]], in October 2000.  In August 2000, Tyler's husband, Will ([[Yulian Vergov]]), is mysteriously murdered one night in his sleep, leaving her to raise their two children, Ashley ([[Mia Mckenna-Bruce]]) and Ronnie ([[Raphael Coleman]]).  Tyler tapes [[hypnotherapy]] sessions with three patients who have the same experience: every night a white owl stares at them through their windows. Tyler hypnotizes two of them, and both recount similar terrifying stories of creatures attempting to enter their homes. Tommy Fisher ([[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]]), her first patient to go under hypnosis, refuses to admit what he sees and returns home. Later that night, Abbey is called by the police to Tommy's house, where she finds him holding his wife and their two children at gunpoint. He insists that he remembers everything and keeps asking what "Zimabu Eter" means. Despite Abbey's attempts to get Tommy to put his gun down, he shoots his family and turns the gun on himself.  After hearing the similarities in the accounts of nightly occurrences, Abbey suspects these patients may have been victims of a [[Abduction phenomenon|non-human kidnapping]]. There is evidence that she herself may have been abducted, when an Assistant gives her a [[tape recorder]], which plays her voice and the sound of something with a distorted electronic voice entering her home and attacking her. It speaks in an unknown tongue; Abbey, though, has no memory of it. Abel Campos ([[Elias Koteas]]), a colleague from [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], is suspicious of the claims. Later, Tyler calls upon Dr. Awolowa Odusami ([[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]]), a specialist in [[ancient language]]s who was a contact of her late husband, to identify the mysterious language on the tape. Odusami identifies it as [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].  Another, more willing patient named Scott ([[Enzo Cilenti]]) wishes to communicate. He admits that there was no owl and speaks of "them", but cannot remember anything further, but does say that he knows why Tommy did what he did.  Later, he insists she come to his home to hypnotize him, to get something seemingly horrific out of his head. But while he is under, he suddenly jerks upright and begins hovering above his bed, while a distorted electronic voice coming out of his mouth tells Dr. Tyler in Sumerian to immediately end her study. Later, Sheriff August ([[Will Patton]]) arrives, telling her that Scott had three upper vertebrae completely severed from his experience, and was completely paralyzed. The Sheriff tries to arrest her, but Campos comes to her defense, seemingly confirming her story. The Sheriff instead places her under house arrest.  One of the deputies stays to watch the house and starts recording with his dash-cam. The dash-cam footage shows a large black object flying over the Tyler house. The video then distorts, but the deputy is heard describing people being pulled out of the house and calls for backup. Deputies rush into the house, finding Ronnie and Tyler, who is desperately sobbing, screaming that Ashley was taken into the sky. Sheriff August, not believing in her abduction theory, accuses her of her daughter's disappearance and removes Ronnie from her custody. Ronnie, though, goes with them willingly, not believing the alien abduction theory either.  Tyler undergoes hypnosis in an attempt to make contact with these beings and reunite with her daughter. Campos and Odusami videotape the session, and once hypnotized, it is revealed that Tyler witnessed the abduction of her daughter and also shows scenes of her own abduction, showing part of the abductors ship and it is hinted that they possibly took some human egg cells from Abbey as well. The camera scrambles, and Abbey begs the alien that abducted Ashley to return her. The creature replies, saying that Ashley will never be returned. It then calls itself the savior, then the father and finally ends with "I am ... God". When the encounter ends, Campos and Odusami rush over to the now unconscious Abbey and then notice something out of camera's view.  The camera scrambles again, and a volatile voice yells "Zimabu Eter!" When the camera view clears it shows that all three of them are gone.  The film cuts to an interview with Tyler in which she explains that all three were abducted during that hypnosis session and no one has any memory of what happened.  The film returns to the aftermath of Abbey's hypnosis session. She wakes up in a hospital after breaking her neck in the abduction. There, August reveals that Will had actually committed suicide, showing that Abbey's belief that he was murdered was merely a delusion. Later it is shown that Abbey is paralyzed, presumably due to her neck injury.  The film then returns to the present interview, where the Interviewer asks Abbey how they, he and the viewers, can believe her if most of what she thought was only in her mind. Abbey tearfully tells him that she has to believe that Ashley is still alive. The interviewer ends the interview as Abbey breaks down in tears.  In the film's epilogue, it states that Abbey was cleared of all charges against her, leaves Alaska for the East Coast, and deteriorates to the point of being completely bed-bound and requiring constant care. Campos remains a psychologist and Odusami becomes a professor at a Canadian university. Both men, as well as August, refuse to be involved with the interview, while Abbey's son Ronnie remains estranged from Abbey and still blames her for Ashley's disappearance. However, as is repeatedly stated in the movie: "In the end, what you believe is yours to decide".  
The Founding of a Republic
 In 1945 after the end of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], [[Mao Zedong]] and members of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) travel to [[Chongqing]] for a meeting with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT). With help from the [[China Democratic League]], the [[Double Tenth Agreement]] is signed between the KMT and CPC, with both sides agreeing to stop the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] and to establish a multi-party government in China.  The following year, Chiang Kai-shek calls for a [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] in [[Nanjing]] and is elected as [[President of the Republic of China|President]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (ROC). At the same time, the peace negotiations between the CPC and KMT fail and the civil war continues. Other political figures such as [[Zhang Lan]], [[Soong Ching-ling]] and [[Li Jishen]], support the CPC because they oppose Chiang's government, even though they are in non-battleground areas such as [[Shanghai]] and [[Hong Kong]].  In May 1948, the CPC declares the opening of a "War of Liberation" against Chiang's ROC government, with many other political parties responding to the call and taking the CPC's side. The [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]] scores victories against the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] in subsequent battles and eventually Chiang's forces retreat to [[Taiwan]] in December 1949. On 1 October 1949, Mao Zedong proclaims the [[People's Republic of China]] with its capital at [[Beijing]], marking the start of a new era for China.  
Fox (film)
 Arjun Kapoor ([[Arjun Rampal]]) is a successful criminal defense lawyer. The film opens with him defending his friend Raj Thakur (Vipul Gupta), who has been accused of rape and murder. Arjun's defense strategy involves suggesting the victim had dubious morals. The victim's parents confront Arjun outside the courthouse, cursing him for his lack of a conscience. Later Raj confesses to Arjun that he is guilty; when Arjun is disturbed by his friend's lack of shame, Raj points out that Arjun's success comes from defending wealthy criminals like him.  At home, Arjun calls his girlfriend and fellow lawyer Urvashi ([[Sagarika Ghatge]]). A shadowy figure carrying a gun sneaks up on Arjun, but they retreat when they hear Arjun confess over the phone that he wants to change. When the court convenes the next morning, Arjun publicly accuses his friend of being guilty. The judge orders Arjun to step down from his duties, and his license is revoked. Arjun decides to take a break, leaving Mumbai and his girlfriend.  Arjun travels to Goa, where he meets an old man named Vivian McNamara who claims to be a retired lawyer. They spend time together, during which McNamara says he understands Arjun's situation. McNamara has written a novel titled "Fix the Fox", a crime thriller about the murder of five lawyers, which he hopes to publish and leave behind a positive legacy instead of a negative one. McNamara gives Arjun a copy of the manuscript, which he finishes reading in one night. When Arjun returns to McNamara's house the next morning, he is stopped by a police officer named Gaitonde, who tells him that McNamara just died.  As there's no one to give the manuscript to, Arjun decides to have it published in memoriam. He offers it to Sophie ([[Udita Goswami]]), a publishing house editor who recognizes its potential. The manuscript's pages are watermarked with "McNamara", which Sophie assumes is Arjun's [[pen name]]. Sophie's publishing policy is to use real names; she also doesn't normally accept unknown authors, but Arjun's fame as a lawyer will ensure the novel's publication. Arjun is pressured into signing a contract, officially claiming to be the author.  The novel becomes a national bestseller and lands in the hands of a local crime branch police officer Yashwant Deshmukh ([[Sunny Deol]]), who reads it and finds something suspicious. Yashwant meets Arjun to discuss the novel, and when Arjun confirms that he wrote it, Yashwant has Arjun arrested. The five murders in the novel match five unsolved murders on file, right down to confidential details. Urvashi comes to Arjun's aid, negotiating for bail and a remand under Yashwant's custody so they can investigate the case themselves.  Arjun and Urvashi tell Yashwant the full story and ask for his help, but they can't find any evidence that "Vivian McNamara" or "Gaitonde" ever existed. Arjun then remembers that the original manuscript had the "McNamara" watermark, which may help cast reasonable doubt. He and Urvashi sneak out of Yashwant's house to get it from the publishing house. They arrive just as "Gaitonde" has taken it; Arjun chases him, eventually following him back to Yashwant's house.  Arjun sneaks into Yashwant's rooms, where he discovers pictures of Yashwant with "Gaitonde". He also finds a secret room where there are costuming materials and newspaper articles of the five criminal lawyers and Arjun himself. Yashwant is behind the murders and the frame-up.  Arjun agrees to meet Yashwant at a secluded location. There, he demands to know why Yashwant framed him. Yashwant explains that his wife and son were murdered, but a criminal defense lawyer similar to Arjun got the killer acquitted. Yashwant since then vowed to kill all lawyers like him. He had almost killed Arjun, as seen earlier in the film, but changed his mind when he heard Arjun confess his troubles to Urvashi. Yashwant decided to give Arjun a chance, setting up the con with "Vivian McNamara" (actually Yashwant's brother, who also pretended to be Gaitonde), but when Arjun took credit for the novel, Yashwant took it as evidence that he hadn't changed at all. Arjun reveals that he's actually wired and the entire conversation was recorded. Police officers come out from their hiding place, and when Yashwant attacks Arjun, he is shot and killed.  The final scene is of Arjun with Urvashi by his side, being interviewed by the press. Arjun says that he is returning to criminal law, but will fight for truth and justice.  
Forget Me Not (2009 film)
  The film opens with a little girl crying and running through a graveyard. She makes it to her house and her parents ask her what's wrong. The girl responds, "I don't remember."  Years later, Sandy Channing and her brother, Eli, are college students who attend a party at their friend T.J.'s house. Everyone goes to the graveyard to play a game. A new girl their age joins them. They play a ghost version of 'Tag', and the new girl wins. The girl asks Sandy if she remembers her. Sandy tells her she does not, and the girls states, "You will," before jumping from the cliff behind her. The police arrive but are unable to find a body. There is a flashback to two girls playing The Game in the graveyard during the day, one is Sandy and the other is presumably the girl who jumped off this cliff. Sandy is the ghost during the game and when she finds the other girl, who requires an inhaler, they sit and talk, the other girl explains that the flower in her hair is a Forget Me Not, which is put on the graves so they remember the dead. Sandy says she doesn't know any dead people, and the girl replies, "I do". She gives the flowers to Sandy proclaiming them best friends, to which Sandy replies, "Best Friends Forever."  The next day, Layla and Chad have sex in Chad's car, after which Chad tells Layla he wants to break up. Furious, Layla throws his [[class ring]], which was hanging on her necklace, into the lake. Chad drives off and leaves her alone. Layla goes into the lake to retrieve the necklace when she sees a mysterious girl in the water. She is then drowned by the girl, who is revealed to be a demonic incarnation of the new girl who had disappeared the night before. Meanwhile, Chad arrives at Sandy and Eli's house, and when Sandy mentions Layla, Chad seems to have forgotten who she is.  The rest of the group is waiting for T.J. to come so they can go on their spring break trip. T.J. is negotiating a deal to buy an [[engagement ring]] for his girlfriend, Lex. He is soon killed by the now-demonic Layla. When Sandy mentions T.J. to her boyfriend Jake, he and the rest of the group have no memory of T.J., just like Layla. Sandy then finds T.J.'s contact information erased from her cell.  The group stops at a convenience store, with Lex distracting the cashier by having sex with him while everyone else steals liquor and food. Frustrated with Lex's promiscuous behavior despite dating T.J., Sandy walks off. Chad is killed next when the ghosts make his car explode. Sandy yells at Eli to pull over when she sees Chad's car. However, no one but Sandy remembers who Chad is, and they drive to T.J.'s house, which appears vacant and in ruin. As Sandy goes into the house with Jake and Eli, Lex and Hannah get into an argument in the car. Sandy begins to remember the unnamed girl from the graveyard as her childhood friend. Lex is killed by undead versions of her murdered friends. The other three think Sandy is crazy, as none of them remember Lex anymore.  Sandy and the others go to the police station, where they learn the mysterious girl's name is Angela Smith and she lives in a convent. At a hotel, Hannah and Eli go to the pool and have sex, after which Hannah is killed by the ghosts. Sandy and Jake then discover Angela is in a coma. At the convent, Jake is killed and Eli doesn't remember Jake anymore. He realizes that they are being erased from time, just like the rhyme they sang before playing the game in the graveyard. After heading home, Sandy, whose parents believe she has become depressed, is sedated and taken to the hospital. While there, Eli is killed by his friends' ghosts. At the hospital, Sandy asks for Eli, of whom her parents have no recollection at all.  Sandy dreams of a time where she and her friends played a scary prank on Angela, who had a seizure in front of the convent after knocking her head into the door. Angela's mom then comes out of her home and screams who did this to her. It is revealed that the little girl at the beginning of the film is a young Sandy, and the girl who mysteriously vanished and has been committing the murders is Angela. Sandy awakes and, recalling the rhyme to "kill the ghost or seal your fate", goes to Angela's room and switches off her life support. However, she then finds Angela sitting up in bed. Sandy is chased up to the roof by the ghosts of her friends, and encounters the young version of Angela. After Sandy's failed attempt to reason with her, young Angela hands her a bouquet of flowers (called [[Forget-me-not]]) and looks up, a demonic expression on her face as she says, "Best friends forever, right, Sandy?" This scares Sandy, and she falls from the roof. The film ends with Angela "miraculously" awakening from her coma, while Sandy is revealed to have taken her place in a coma of her own.

Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel
  Ray ([[Chris O'Dowd]]) has been fired from his job as a costumed guide in a theme park attraction called "Star Ride," after he goes too far into character and terrifies a group of young children. Ray's good friends Pete ([[Dean Lennox Kelly]]) and Toby ([[Marc Wootton]]) also work in the theme park, as costumed dinosaurs passing out coupons to a restaurant called "Dinoburger." That evening they all go to the cinema, later complaining about how "crappy" the film was on their way to the pub.  Once at the pub, the compose a "Letter to Hollywood" with tips on how to stop making so many bad movies, on the back of a sheet from Toby's "brilliant ideas" notebook. Ray meets an American girl named Cassie ([[Anna Faris]]), with dark brown hair, who claims to have a time machine built into her body and whose job is to find and repair "time leaks." When he sarcastically says she should use her time machine to kill Hitler, she tells him about time-criminals called "editors." Editors are people that go back in time to kill famous artists immediately after they've created their greatest work, to avoid their later decline in quality. Cassie insists her job is fairly boring, but one of the perks is getting to meet famous people from history, like him. She claims that future books will be written about him, and refers to him as "Ray the Great," indicating she is not only a fan but has a bit of a crush on him. Ray assumes that his friends have set him up with Cassie to make him feel better after losing his job. But after a brief conversation Cassie leaves. When Ray relates this entire story to Pete and Toby, they think he's invented the entire encounter - which is what Cassie told him would happen.  Pete leaves them to use the "Gents" bathroom, but when he returns the pub room is full of dead bodies, among them is a bearded version of himself. At first he hides back in the bathroom, but when he finally decides to try and flee the pub entirely he hears the expected sounds one might coming from the pub room. He enters the room and it's back to normal, with no bodies or sign of the slaughter. He finds his friends at their table and tells them what happened, assuming it must be related to Cassie's time leaks. Pete thinks the entire tale is a wind-up, and Ray assumes that his friends have crafted an entire evening of science-fiction based entertainment for him, even beyond hiring Cassie.   The three of them end up back in the bathroom, trying to recreate what Pete experienced, but only jump back about 30 minutes in time. When they return to the pub room they find the earlier version of themselves, just finishing the composition of their "Letter to Hollywood." They spend some time hiding in a cupboard in the hallway of the pub, unsure what they should do other than wait for the other versions of themselves to enter the bathroom and travel forward in time. Ray then realizes that Cassie is still there, talking to an earlier version of himself. As she's trying to leave the pub he stops her, explaining that that they found her time leak in the men's toilet, which she takes as a joke and leaves. But she returns one second later, with light brown hair in an entirely different style, having actually spent 6 months sorting out what went wrong at the pub that night. She claims everything has been fixed and they are safe to wait and talk in the garden for a while, because no one is due out there for another 23 minutes. But when a couple comes out ahead of schedule she leaves to investigate.   After their earlier versions go into the men's bathroom, the current versions go into the women's bathroom to use the facilities while avoiding their other selves. They assume everything is resolved, but when they leave the women's bathroom they find themselves in a post-apocalyptic version of the pub. Pete decides to flee back into the women's bathroom again, but when Ray and Toby start to follow him, he emerges from the door of the men's bathroom, bearded, filthy and severely traumatized. He says that he doesn't want to talk about his experiences, but as they gather warm clothing, food and weapons, he makes comments about some of the things he's seen and been through. They also find a faded mural of themselves, dressed in the same sweater and sweatshirts they're now wearing, outside over the garden. Strange sounds cause them to run for the bathroom doors again, so that they miss seeing a building-sized ant eat a man, who is pushing a shopping trolley with a loud squeaky wheel.  While in the bathroom again, Ray and Toby have to stop Pete from trying to warn earlier version of themselves, and creating a paradox that will make them cease to exist. When he runs out after one solo version of himself, they follow him out into a themed-night party at the pub. Everyone is dressed as they are now, for a look-a-like contest, and the full version of the mural is visible on the garden wall. In the mural, Toby is writing on the piece of paper from his notebook. They reason that whatever was on the other side of that piece of paper is how they became famous. In the crowd at the party they meet a second time traveler named Millie ([[Meredith MacNeill]]), who claims that she trained Cassie at their department, which she calls "Causal Adjust," and that she was sent by Cassie to take them back to their own time.   Back at their table in the pub, they read what was on the back of the piece of paper and decide it must've been found there by someone. Ray needs to relieve himself and goes to the garden to avoid entering either of the bathrooms again. He finds Cassie outside, for whom another 6 months has passed, and who now has shorter dark blonde hair. She feels too big a deal was made of their brief 30-minute jump in time, but Ray explains that they went much farther into the future and about Millie being sent to get them. Cassie tells him that Millie is an editor, "Causal Adjust" being another name for their group, and that she was sent to kill them at their finest hour. He goes back inside to warn Pete and Toby while Cassie tries to get help, but she finds that her time machine has been taken offline and she follows him in. Ray and Pete want to destroy the paper, so that Millie has no reason to kill them, but Toby is hesitant to give up their future fame. Millie arrives, incapacitates Cassie and promises Toby that she'll make them all legends if he just gives her the piece of paper. He ultimately refuses her, but as they try to destroy the paper Millie fires-off the armament system built into her skeletal-time-travel machine, seemingly killing everyone in the pub in a matter of seconds. She walks out of the room, with the piece of paper sitting on top of their table.   As an earlier version of Pete enters the pub room and sees the bodies, but runs out when he hears the sound of a bloodied and barely-still-alive Ray knocking over a pint of beer onto the piece of paper, destroying it. Time is shown reversing and resetting itself, until they are all three sitting back at their table in the pub, from before any of the time travel happened, with the now illegible piece of paper sitting in front of them. With their night rewound to near its beginning, they decide to go to a different pub.  As they're walking down the street, Ray tells Pete that it's probably all over, because now that the page is destroyed none of it should have ever happened, including him meeting Cassie. Moments later Cassie appears through a big glowing portal, with long golden-blonde hair. She reveals that she and Ray have been dating for 2 years - confirming they've had plenty of sex in that time - and that his dumping the pint in the pub caused a feedback loop through the fabric of space-time resulting in time leaks everywhere. She says they have only fourteen hours to save the earth (a reference to the film [[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]), and urges them to go with her to a parallel universe. Ray eventually talks a reluctant Pete and Toby into going with him through the portal, and they all leave.   The end-credits are interrupted after the cast list, to show Ray coming out from behind a wall with Pete. Ray says that it appears the earlier versions of them have gone. But when Pete tells Toby he can come out, instead a second Pete emerges. The credits continue after their reaction to this newest wrinkle.

From Mexico with Love
 Hector Villa is a young Mexican national and border-crossing migrant and worker with boxing abilities mirroring his late father's. He could perhaps be good if he learned to think along with his pummeling. Despite all of this, Hector is a hard worker on a Texas farm who does what he can to provide for his ailing mother which includes pulling in a few side dollars from small-time, illegal gambling fights.  Tito, a "coyote" (a person who helps smuggle people across the border) spends his days as a snake catcher but at night, helps smuggle immigrants across the border. After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could  get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough.  Corralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating "No work, no pay". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown  and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart.          After a hard days work, Maria is stopped and charmed by the farm owner's cocky and pugilist son Robert while Hector looks on with uncertainty. While taking a walk around the ranch, Hector and Maria happen upon Robert's training session where he is sparring. Hector comments to Maria while although Robert is very good, he has trouble with his balance. Overheard, Robert takes it as an insult. However, Robert's trainer, the alcoholic Billy Jenks agrees with Hector. Still feeling slighted, Robert challenges Hector on the spot. After getting outfitted, Hector and Robert spar but it quickly gets out of hand and has to be broken up by Billy. "Big Al" Stevens, the racist and brutish farm owner and Robert's father shows up and yells at Billy for letting Hector in the ring despite Tito and Billy saying that Hector shows promising talent. Al has none of it, and is firm in his wanting Robert to become a champion by any means necessary. Billy finds steroids in Robert's training bag and when Al reacts indifferently to it, Billy quits finally fed up.    A few days later, Robert shows up with Maria to Hector's suite and offers him money for the sparring session the other day stating he earned it. Hector refuses it stating he doesn't accept charity. When Robert leaves, Maria yells at Hector for being so prideful to which Hector responds that people like Robert play games and that as workers, they are nothing more than playthings. Furious, Maria storms away.  The next day on payday, the supervisors rant on how short the crop pickings are and begin to slash the worker's pay by bucket instead of by day as agreed upon previously. When Hector's mother's work is inspected, the supervisor's out of spite give her less than half day's work. When Hector argues with them, all the supervisors do is insult him. Enraged, Hector fights with the supervisors and beats them down (and unintentionally hits Tito when he tries to stop him). Robert walks in and subdues Hector and Al kicks Hector off the farm warning him that if he tries to come back, he will deport everyone.  Driven to the border and dumped off in a porta potty, Hector fumes all the way to a boxing gym where he sees Billy Jenks. He pleads with Billy to train him. It becomes apparent that Billy was the one who trained Hector's father and angrily refuses stating that although Hector's father was a decent man, he was stubborn, had a bad temper, wouldn't listen or train and believed that Hector would be no better. Hector leaves to go see Tito at the border while he is smuggling other immigrants to apologize. He implores Tito to look after his mother while he is gone.  Hector's persistence to get Billy to train him finally pays off but under the condition that he follow all of Billy's rules and guidelines. In the meantime, Robert continues to pursue and charm Maria. Robert invites Maria to a party later in the night and she attends despite warnings from Tito and her friend. Maria impresses everyone with her dancing and is guided into a corner with Robert who kisses her. But when Robert takes it further, Maria stops him. Irritated Robert leaves her believing that Hector has something to do with her hesitance and allows her to be picked on by the other guests. Maria leaves the party feeling humiliated.  Meanwhile, Hector tells Billy he wants to fight Robert. Billy trains Hector into using his brains as well as his fists stating that Hector uses to much anger in a fight disabling him from thinking clearly and leaving himself vulnerable. Hector trains in all sorts of unorthodox methods of boxing and becomes better with each session. However, Tito comes to get Hector as his mother is dying. Hector arrives in time to comfort his mother as she dies and takes her coffin back to Mexico to bury her. Afterwards, Maria comes to the gym to talk to Hector and tells him that she understands now what he meant earlier about being played for a game. She pleads with Hector not to fight Robert but he remains committed. Tito comes to Billy and offers a proposition where he bets heavy on Hector and getting every worker to put money on him for the fight against Robert and goes and does the same with Al who readily agrees to the fight and the terms as he needs the money to keep the farm from failing (insect damage to the crops).  On fight day, Tito needs to smuggle Hector, Maria, and a friend across the border but are nearly caught. Tito wards away the border patrol by comically telling them an embarrassing story about one of the agents who forgets to check the van and leaves. Before the fight, Hector kisses Maria passionately. Meanwhile, Robert refuses to take steroids believing he doesn't need them against Hector and Al reminds him that the fate of the farm depends on him. Hector shares a touching moment with Billy who tells Hector that his father was a great fighter and a great man just like Hector.   As the fight begins, it becomes apparent that Hector is outclassed by Robert who is 30 pounds heavier and much more experienced getting knocked down several times. However, with Billy's strategy, Hector holds his own against Robert and ferociously fights back. In the last round, both fighters are battered but Hector beats on Robert until he makes him throw up and knocks him out. At the end of the fight, as everyone comes up to congratulate Hector, he tells Maria he loves her to which she responds the same way. Al, defeated, asks what Tito intends to do with all the money he and the workers had won to which Tito replies that they are "going home".  The movie ends with Hector living happily with Maria in Mexico on a ranch which he named after his mother with Tito and all the other workers.

Frozen Kiss
 The young couple consisting of Ryan and Shelley get stuck in a snow storm on their way home from a party. As they begin to walk, someone, or something, is coming after them. 
G-Force (film)
   The film revolves around a special team of trained secret agent animals, equipped with advanced tools that allow the mammalian members to talk to humans. The primary field team consists of [[guinea pig]]s Darwin, Blaster, and Juarez, [[star-nosed mole]] Speckles (cyber intelligence), and [[housefly]] Mooch (Reconnaissance). The unit's leader Ben, orders an unauthorized infiltration of the residence of home electronics and appliances magnate, Leonard Saber, the owner of Saberling Industries, who has been under [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation and is working for an unseen mastermind named Mr. Yanshu. The team is able to retrieve sensitive information about a sinister scheme that is set to occur in 48 hours. However, when Ben's superior Kip Killian arrives for his evaluation, his astonishment at the team's capabilities and technology is overcome by his indignation at Ben's unauthorized mission and the fact that the downloaded intelligence appears to be useless information about Saber's [[coffeemaker]]s. As a result, the government agent orders the unit shut down, the equipment seized and the animals to be used as experimental subjects to be killed. With the help of their human compatriots, Darwin, Juarez, Blaster, Mooch and Speckles escape with hopes of stopping Saber's scheme, but find themselves in a pet carrying case bound for a pet shop.  Trapped in the store's pet rodent display case, G-Force meets Hurley, a laid-back guinea pig, Bucky, an irascible [[hamster]], and three sycophantic mice. Although Blaster and Juarez manage to get themselves sold to a family with plans to return to extract their comrades, Speckles' own attempt to escape by playing dead ends disastrously when he is thrown into and supposedly crushed in a garbage truck. Meanwhile, Mooch manages to return to Ben to tell him where his mammalian agents are, but Darwin escapes with Hurley before he can arrive to collect them.  While Blaster and Juarez escape their new owners to return to Ben, he and his assistant Marcie discover that the discredited intel has a destructive computer function that apparently hid the scheme. At this time, Darwin and Hurley make their own way to their superior. En route, Darwin sees a Saberling coffee maker and decides to investigate it, but his examination of the machine makes it come alive as a dangerous fighting robot that he and Hurley are able to defeat by making it run right into the path of an oncoming SUV. Later Darwin and Hurley transport the wreckage to Ben by a skateboard. However, upon arrival, Ben confesses the shattering information that they are not special genetically enhanced animals as previously told, but ordinary ones Ben took in and trained for the team; Juarez was a delicacy at a roadside [[tapas]] stand in [[Pyrenees]], Blaster was found at a hair and cosmetics lab where a hair gel was being tested for allergic reactions, Speckles was found before his family was killed and his home was destroyed to build a [[golf course]], during which he became blind and had to wear special glasses to help him see, and Darwin was adopted from the pet store after his parents abandoned him because he was the runt of the litter. However, Hurley lifts them from their despair by reminding the team of the astounding feats he has seen them do and the fact that they obviously made themselves extraordinary on their own.  Emboldened but with little time to stop the scheme, Ben provides the field team with the means to infiltrate the Saber residence and plant a virus in the computer mainframe. Unfortunately, FBI agents are ordered by Killian to capture the animals dead or alive, forcing the team to elude them with an extended pursuit thanks to a [[Hamster ball|high speed vehicle]] especially designed for them called the Rapid Deployment Vehicle (dubbed the RDV by Darwin) and Mooch acting as their camera in the air. During the chase, one FBI SUV gets trapped by moving trucks, while another SUV crashes into a RV, and the last one gets caught in the middle of a fireworks display, though none of the agents are harmed. After the team infiltrates Saber's mainframe, they encounter a bomb trap but they manage to avoid it because of their size. Meanwhile, Hurley notices a Saberling microwave oven, which transforms and attacks. In an appliance store, all of the machines also transform into killing machines and begin combining with each other. The microwave then tries to kill the 3 guinea pigs. The team take on the monster until it is destroyed by the bomb trap, and the resulting battle separates the group, leaving only Darwin and Mooch to take the mainframe down. At the same time, Leonard Saber is shocked to discover that his appliances have become killing machines, expecting them to simply be able to effectively communicate with each other.  Meanwhile, Killian leads his men to take advantage of this obvious pretext to finally openly move against the industrialist thinking that he was the mastermind and interrogate him in the command truck. Ben and Marcie arrive at the scene and they watch Darwin trying to infiltrate the mainframe and shut it down. When Darwin reaches the mainframe, he finds out that Speckles, who actually faked his death and somehow obtained another pair of glasses after his original one was taken away earlier, is the mastermind of the plan and is also the mysterious Mr. Yanshu (the name Yanshu 鼴鼠 means mole in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]). Speckles explains his masterstroke: to cause a massive planetwide bombardment of [[space debris]] pulled from orbit to make the planet surface uninhabitable, admitting that he snuck into Saber's base and planted the control chips into the devices and used Sabersense as a cover for his plan, and that he was the one who sabotaged G-Force's presentation to ensure that they didn't find out about his sinister plot. He also explains that the reason behind his plot is because he wants revenge on the human race for the death of his family. Speckles promptly amalgamates the various appliances in the vicinity into a giant walking robot, which, combined with a localised bombardment of orbital debris, soon overpowers the police force and grabs the command truck, with Marcie, Killian, Saber, and Ben inside. During the fight, Speckles summons one of his robots to kill Darwin (who loses his parachute and the PDA in the process), but Darwin manages to persuade Speckles that his new family is with the rest of the team and Ben, who had taken them all in. Speckles concedes, and realizing that he has gone too far, tries to shut it down, but he has lost control and the machines continue their onslaught. Darwin uses the computer virus on his [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] (which was recovered by Mooch earlier) to take it down, destroying the robot and nearly killing Hurley while the FBI take Saber into custody to presumably find out information from him.  The guinea pigs are personally commended by the FBI Director who also appoints them special agents of the FBI. Furthermore, G-Force is reinstated as a unit of the Bureau and expanded with Hurley, Bucky and the mice inducted as new recruits. Meanwhile, Saber makes the largest product recall in history, Speckles is given the punitive duty of personally removing the malicious chips from all Saber products, which number into the tens of thousands, and Agent Killian is relocated to an FBI base in the South Pole as a punishment for capturing G-Force.  
Futurama: Into the Wild Green Yonder
 The Planet Express crew visits [[Amy Wong|Amy]]'s parents, Leo and Inez, who are destroying the "old" [[Mars]] [[Las Vegas Strip|Vegas]] and constructing a more extravagant one.  A group of [[ecofeminism|eco-feminists]] (calling themselves "eco-feministas") led by Frida Waterfall protest the destruction of the environment, leading to an accident that leaves Frida's necklace lodged inside [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]]'s brain. The destruction upsets [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], but Leo has bribed [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] to rubber stamp the project as environmentally friendly. Leela saves a Martian muck [[leech]], the last of its species, from the site.  In New Mars Vegas, Fry starts to go mad when he cannot stop hearing the thoughts of everyone around him. He meets Hutch, a [[Hobo|transient]] who advises Fry to wear a [[tin foil hat]] to keep others' thoughts out of his head. Hutch warns Fry never to reveal his powers and to beware the "Dark Ones".  While golfing with the crew, Leo reveals plans to build the universe's largest [[miniature golf]] course, destroying 12% of the Milky Way in the process. Farnsworth and the crew survey the site and discover an asteroid in a violet dwarf star system teeming with primordial life. Despite this, Farnsworth approves Leo’s project. Disgusted, Leela joins the eco-feminists, who begin sabotaging the project.  [[File:Into-the-wild-green-yonder-asteroid.JPG|thumb|left|The asteroid in the violet dwarf system.]] Hutch introduces Fry to the "Legion of Mad Fellows", a [[secret society]] of tin-foil-hat-wearing telepaths led by the Number 9 man. No. 9 tells Fry a story of two species that worked together to survive, until one broke the cycle and caused an "evolutionary arms race", both species evolving to defeat the other. One became the extinct "Encyclopods" who evolved to preserve the [[DNA]] of endangered species so they could be restored should they become extinct. The other became the "Dark Ones", who want to destroy all life. Fry learns that the violet dwarf is the only surviving egg of the Encyclopods. Due to a resurgence in the life-giving force [[Qi|"Chi"]], the Encyclopod will soon be reborn. As Fry is immune to the Dark Ones' [[Psionics|psionic]] powers he alone can save it from Leo Wong's plans to turn it into a golf course, and from the Dark Ones, who have evolved to the point that no one knows what they look like.  To end the sabotage, Leo enlists [[Zapp Brannigan]] and [[Kif Kroker]], who in turn hire Bender to track down the eco-feministas. Fry infiltrates Leo's empire as a security guard. Amy is angered by her father's sexist jokes and joins Leela, while Bender bugs Fry's phone in case he communicates with Leela. Fry runs into Frida and has her take a message of support to Leela, but an unseen Dark One murders Frida.  Farnsworth prepares to close Planet Express; with their delivery team missing they cannot continue. Leo Wong hires them to put up a fence around the construction site. Farnsworth cancels the closing and goes with Zoidberg and Hermes to do the job. They are captured by the eco-feminists, who commandeer the Planet Express ship. When the eco-feministas suspect Fry of murdering Frida, Fry and Leela arrange a rendezvous. They are ambushed by the ''Nimbus'', which was tipped off by Bender. The eco-feministas are sent to prison.  At a Legion meeting, No. 9 explains that Fry must stop the implosion of the violet dwarf and thwart the Dark One who is sure to be present. Though no one knows the Dark One's form, its mind cannot be read, allowing Fry to identify it.  No. 9 gives Fry the Omega Device, which can temporarily disable the Dark One at close range.  Bender frees the eco-feministas from prison in order to uphold his record for most crimes committed at once. Hermes, Zoidberg, Scruffy, and a repentant Farnsworth rescue them.  At the ceremony, Fry cannot locate an unreadable mind; he concludes that he himself (having an unreadable mind) must be the Dark One. The eco-feministas disrupt the ceremony, but Fry convinces Leela to let him proceed. Fry activates the Omega Device, which creates a small dome around the two that appears to have no effect. Leela's leech falls to the ground and reveals itself as the final Dark One.  The violet dwarf system forms a giant [[sperm]] and flies into the star, creating an Encyclopod embryo which quickly matures, taking the form of a giant [[manta ray]]-like creature. The Dark One kills Hutch, whose dying act is to pull Frida's necklace out of Fry's forehead, causing Fry to lose his telepathy. The Encyclopod kills the Dark One. No. 9 convinces the Encyclopod to preserve the Dark One's DNA, but Zoidberg eats the remains before it can. The Encyclopod preserves Hutch's DNA before leaving.  Zapp attempts to apprehend the escaped prisoners, but the crew of the Planet Express ship and the Eco-feminists escape along with Kif.  Fry and Leela profess their love for each other as the ''Nimbus'' chases the Planet Express ship toward a [[wormhole]], which the Professor warns could take them trillions of [[light years]] away. Everyone agrees to go for it. Fry and Leela kiss as the ship enters the wormhole.  ===Ending=== The ending refers to the uncertain future of the show. The makers were not sure if the show would return to TV, so if it did not, it is implied that the ship was in fact taken trillions of [[light years]] away. The show was picked up by [[Comedy Central]], and it is revealed in the next episode "[[Rebirth (Futurama)|Rebirth]]" that the wormhole sent the ship directly back to Earth.  
G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra
  In the near future, weapons master [[Destro|James McCullen]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) has created a [[nanotech]]-based weapon – nanomites designed to devour metal and other materials, capable of destroying anything from tanks to cities. The [[nanobots]] can only be stopped by activating the kill switch. His company M.A.R.S. sells four warheads to [[NATO]], and NATO troops led by American soldiers [[Duke (G.I. Joe)|Duke]] ([[Channing Tatum]]) and [[Rip Cord (G.I. Joe)|Ripcord]] ([[Marlon Wayans]]) are asked to deliver the warheads. Their convoy is ambushed by the [[Baroness (G.I. Joe)|Baroness]] ([[Sienna Miller]]), whom Duke recognizes to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by [[Scarlett (G.I. Joe)|Scarlett]] ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]), [[Snake Eyes (G.I. Joe)|Snake Eyes]] ([[Ray Park]]), [[Breaker (G.I. Joe)|Breaker]] ([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]), and [[Heavy Duty (G.I. Joe)|Heavy Duty]] ([[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]). They take the warheads to [[The Pit (G.I. Joe)|The Pit]], G.I. Joe's command center in Egypt, and upon arriving, rendezvous with the head of the G.I. Joe Team, [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|General Hawk]] ([[Dennis Quaid]]). Hawk takes command of the warheads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to let them join his group, after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.  McCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]), planning on using the warheads to cause worldwide panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends [[Storm Shadow (G.I. Joe)|Storm Shadow]] ([[Lee Byung-hun|Byung-Hun Lee]]) and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads, with assistance from [[Zartan]] ([[Arnold Vosloo]]).  After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the [[Eiffel Tower]] and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in so doing, he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the [[Arctic]].  The Joes locate the secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three missiles with nanowarheads, which are aimed for [[Beijing]], [[Moscow]], and [[Washington, DC]], the world's three most important cities. He intends to do this to strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet, after which they will turn to the person with the most power in the world, the President of the United States. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered [[Doctor Mindbender]] ([[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]]) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.  The Doctor assumes the identity of [[Cobra Commander|the Commander]], having healed McCullen's burned face with nanomites, encasing it in silver and naming him "Destro", which places McCullen under the Commander's control. They are captured by G.I. Joe soon after. On the [[supercarrier]] [[USS Flagg|USS ''Flagg'']], the Baroness is placed in protective custody until they can remove the nanomites from her body. Meanwhile, Zartan, having had his physical appearance altered by nanomites, infiltrates the White House during the missile crisis and assumes the identity of the President of the United States of America ([[Jonathan Pryce]]), thus completing a part of McCullen's plan to rule the world.  
Gamer (2009 film)
 In 2034, [[computer programmer]] Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) invents self-replicating [[nanite]]s that replace brain tissue and allow humans to control other humans' actions and see through their eyes.  The first application of Castle's "Nanex" technology is a [[virtual community]] [[life simulation game]], ''Society'', which allows [[gamer]]s to manipulate live actors as their [[avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.  ''Society'' becomes a worldwide sensation, making Castle the richest man in the world.  He then creates ''Slayers'', a [[first-person shooter]] where the "characters" are [[death-row]] prisoners using real weapons in specially created arenas.  Unlike ''Society'' actors, ''Slayers'' participants are not paid; instead, they volunteer in exchange for the promise that any Slayer who survives 30 matches will earn his freedom (though no one ever has).    John "Kable" Tillman (Butler) is the crowd's favorite, having survived a record 27 matches. He is exclusively controlled by Simon (Lerman), a seventeen-year-old superstar gamer from a wealthy family.   An activist organization called the "Humanz" hacks a talk-show interview with Castle and claims that his technology will one day be used to [[mind control|control people against their will]]. The Humanz also disrupt ''Society'' play, but Castle sees both these actions as trivial.  However, Castle feels threatened by Kable's winning streak, and introduces a new inmate into ''Slayers'', Hackman (Crews), specifically to kill Kable.  Unknown to anyone else, Hackman will not be controlled by a player, and thus not be handicapped by the [[Lag (online gaming)|"ping"]] that causes a small but dangerous delay between the player's command and the Slayer's action.   Kable/Tillman's wife, Angie (Valletta), works as a ''Society'' character, but in spite of her earnings, she is refused custody of their daughter Delia, who has been placed with a wealthy family.   The Humanz contact Kable and Simon separately, warning them that Castle has no intention of letting Kable survive, and offer to create a [[Mod (gaming)|mod]] that will let him escape, but only if Simon relinquishes control during the game.  The escape is successful, and news outlets report that Kable has been [[fragging|fragged]], which puts Simon in a difficult position: he is labelled a "cheater", locked out of his bank account, and investigated by the [[FBI]] for helping Kable escape.  Tillman is brought to the Humanz' hideout; he refuses to help their fight against Castle, but learns of Angie's current location in ''Society''.  He rescues her, escaping from both Hackman and Castle's security forces. They are met by Gina (Sedgwick), the talk show host, secretly assisting the Humanz.  The Humanz deactivate the nanites in Angie and Tillman's brains, and Tillman remembers that the original nanites were tested on him while he was still in the military.  Under Castle's control, Tillman shot and killed his best friend, and was imprisoned.  Upon learning that Castle is the wealthy father who adopted Delia, Tillman infiltrates his mansion to get her back. He locates Castle, who  reveals that his henchmen have already tracked down the Humanz' lair and killed all of them.  He also reveals that 98% of his own brain has been replaced with nanites, but his allow him to control others, rather than be controlled.  He plans to release air-borne nanites which will infect the entire United States within six months, giving him ultimate control. Hackman attacks Tillman, who easily kills him.  Tillman then attacks Castle, but is frozen in place, as Castle explains that his men have reactivated his and Angie's nanites.  Unknown to Castle, Gina and Trace (Lohman) escaped the murder of the Humanz, and patch into the Nanex, revealing the confrontation to the world and exposing Castle's plans.  It also unblocks Simon's account and restores his control of Tillman.  Castle tries to manipulate Tillman into killing his own daughter, but he resists, and then Simon's control allows him to attack Castle.  He and Simon wrestle for control over Tillman, but Tillman tells Castle to imagine Tillman's knife stabbing him. Castle unconsciously does so, allowing Tillman to kill him and removing his control over everyone.  With Castle dead, Tillman convinces his technicians to deactivate the Nanex, freeing all the "characters" in ''Society'' and ''Slayers''.  The film closes with the Tillman family taking a trip down a country road, ending with the words "Game Over".  
Funny People
 George Simmons ([[Adam Sandler]]) is a middle-aged retired [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] turned [[Actor|movie star]]. Despite his [[wealth]] he is disillusioned and [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] as most of his recent film work is low-brow and poorly received.

Garfield's Pet Force
 On the planet Dorkon, Professor Wally (The professor counterpart to Wally) shows Emperor Jon (the Emperor counterpart to [[Jon Arbuckle]]) his new invention, The Moscram ray gun, a device powered by the Klopman crystal that can scramble inanimate objects and organisms into new creatures under the user's control. But Emperor Jon is concerned about finding a wife to continue the royal bloodline. Soon a warship lands outside the palace. Emperor Jon sees Vetvix (the super-villain counterpart to Liz), and asks her if he can marry her. She agrees, but only because she wanted to steal the Moscram Ray Gun. She zombifies Emperor Jon's guards. Professor Wally calls the Pet Force: Garzooka ([[Garfield (character)|Garfield]]'s superhero counterpart, voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), who can spit green hairballs out of his mouth, Odious ([[Odie]]'s superhero counterpart, voiced by [[Gregg Berger]]), who can whack and move objects with his powerful tongue, Abnermal ([[List of Garfield characters#Nermal|Nermal]]'s superhero counterpart, voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]), who can run at an amazing speed and Starlena ([[List of Garfield characters#Arlene|Arlene]]'s superhero counterpart, voiced by [[Audery Wasilewski]]), who can freeze her enemies by staring at them. But Vetvix zombifies every member of the Pet Force except Garzooka. He manages to get hold of the Klopman Crystal and escapes with Professor Wally in a secret passageway. The professor uses his computer to search the universe for counterparts with DNA matches with the Pet Force. Professor Wally finds the counterparts, and gives Garzooka their pictures and some serums that will transform their counterparts into the Pet Force, and he flies away in his space ship to the Comic Strip World leaving Professor Wally behind with Vetvix vowing for revenge.   The situation was revealed to be a comic book Nermal ([[Jason Marsden]]) was reading during a cookout with the gang. Nermal is really excited about getting the next 100th edition issue. Garfield's friends go to the Comic studio to work their new strip, except Garfield ([[Frank Welker]]) who wants to finish all the hot dogs. Nermal gets the new Pet Force issue from a news stand, with Garzooka jumping out of a comic book afterwards. Nermal finds that the events that are happening to them are in the comic book, and the rest of the book is blank because they have not happened yet. Garzooka heads for Jon's house, and is told where Odie, Arlene, and Nermal are by Garfield. Garzooka gives Garfield the Klopman crystal as well, telling him to protect it.  In the living room at the Comic Studios, Nermal, Arlene, and Odie notice Garzooka behind them. Garzooka hands them the serums, asking them to help him stop Vetvix. But they don't change immediately after they drink the serums. However it's time for Odie, Arlene, and Nermal to go to work and Garzooka follows. Meanwhile, the real Garfield is enjoying a relaxing day all to himself, but is captured by Vetvix (who appeared in Comic Strip World earlier), who threatens him for the Klopman Crystal, but to no avil (because Garfield was a cartoon character). Garfield tried to protect the Klopman Crystal by putting it in his lemonade, and drinks it. But eventually Vetvix's guards get it. Garfield is told by Professor Wally to go over to Emperor Jon and him. He tells Garfield to grab the Professor's lens and puts them on the window. The sunlight burns the Emperor and the professor's ropes. Vetvix order her guards to get rid of Garfield, so they throw Garfield down the garbage chute.    Back at Comic Studios, the gang is interrupted by Vetvix, who crashes her war ship into Comic Studios, and zombifies most of the characters at the studio. Nermal, Odie, Arlene, Jon, and Garzooka escape to the back alley. Garzooka is wondering why the serums haven't taken effect yet. He notices Garfield falling from the sky. Then Odie, Nermal, and Arlene turn into their Pet Force counterparts. They plan to bring down Vetvix's ship using the antenna on top of a tall tower nearby. Vetvix's ship backs up, causing a bill board to break to pieces. The Pet Force hide under one of the broken pieces of the bill board and escape while being chased by zombies and manage to reach the tower by crashing through walls. Garfield, Jon, and a cartoon trash can are the only ones left in the back alley. Eli saves Garfield from Vetvix, by making the air vent suck him. Jon, however, gets scrambled with the trashcan. Vetvix causes chaos, zombifying all of Cartoon World. Eli scolds Garfield for not helping Garzooka and if haven't been so lazy then Vetvix wouldn't have gotten the Klopman Crystal. Eli and Garfield manage to find three survivors: Wally ([[Neil Ross]]), Wally's wife Bonita([[Jennifer Darling]]), and Betty. Garfield decides to name himself and the survivors "The Crazy Crew" and form their own plan. Meanwhile, at the tower, Garzooka realizes the zombies are too much for the Pet Force. Luckily Garfield and Wally disguise themselves as Garzooka (Garfield stands on top of Wally to make the fake Garzooka taller)) and get the zombies attention. The real Garzooka and the Pet Force go to the antenna and use it to bring down Vetvix's ship. Meanwhile, the zombies chase Garfield and Wally to the Comic Studio, and Eil opens the pit in the filming area, in which the zombies fall into. Meanwhile, at the tower, Vetvix shoots the Moscram Ray Gun, using the super scramble mode, combining all the Pet Force members into one creature. However, they move in a different direction, and they fall off the tower.  Emperor Jon and Professor Wally break free, and take over the ship, flying into the air, making Vetvix fall off. However, she makes a giant monster by shooting the ray gun at most of the buildings in the Cartoon World, and decides to use the monster to destroy everything and get her ship back. Meanwhile, Vetvix's ship (with Professor Wally and Emperor Jon controlling it) lands near the back alley of Comic Studio, and the Crazy Crew meet Emperor Jon and Professor Wally, who let Garfield enter the ship. The ship flies above the monster, and Garfield jumps off, just as the monster grabs the wings of the ship, wrecking it. The monster chases Garfield. During the chase, Garfield encounters the creature combined with the Pet Force members. They try to attack Garfield, but they miss and end up attacking the monster. Odie chases Garfield using his tongue. Garfield runs around the monsters, and the monster trips. Vetvix falls off and drops the gun. Garfield unscrambles the monster and the Pet Force creature. Garfield and the "Crazy Crew" surround Vetvix, and she backs up into a corner called the "Smile Section", which Betty invented. The "Smile Section" will make anyone who goes into it think of happy thoughts and smile. Garfield shoots Vetvix with the Moscram Ray Gun, and Vetvix becomes a nice woman and says sorry to Emperor Jon and kisses him. Eli opens the pit and Garfield unscrambles the zombies. Garzooka gives Arlene, Odie, and Nermal the red serums, and they drink it. Nermal misses having his super powers, so Garzooka gives him a matching costume. The Comic Studios crew, Garfield, his friends, and the Pet Force (on Dorkon) watch Vetvix and Emperor Jon's wedding, Garfield finally wins Arlene's feelings, and two gaze at the stars. Suddenly, a trail of stars goes under them and they float into space and dance, before returning to Earth.    2 minutes in the credits while watching Emperor Jon's wedding, the gang watch a video (showing that the real Pet Force is back) at the Comic Studios. They notice that Betty is there too, and realize that she followed Garzooka to Dorkon. It looks like there will have to be a new assistant to Charles, the director of the Comic Studios, which Nermal is eager to take.

Gentlemen Broncos
 Benjamin Purvis lives with his mother Judith, who designs tacky clothes and makes rock-hard popcorn balls. Judith and Benjamin make ends meet by working at a women's retail clothing store. Benjamin spends his spare time writing [[science fiction]] stories, and he has recently completed a story called ''Yeast Lords,'' which centers on a hero named Bronco, modeled after his long-dead father.  At various times, portions of ''Yeast Lords'' are seen as Benjamin imagines them. Bronco is obliquely masculine, and he valiantly struggles with a villain over yeast production.  At a two-day writing camp for aspiring fantasy and science fiction authors, Benjamin attends lectures by his idol, the prolific and pretentious writer Ronald Chevalier. Chevalier announces a contest for the writers, in which the winner's story will be published nationally. After encouragement from fellow camper Tabatha, Benjamin submits ''Yeast Lords''. Tabatha shows the story to her friend Lonnie Donaho who runs an ultra low-budget video production company. Lonnie gives Benjamin a post-dated check for $500 and begins adapting ''Yeast Lords'' into a film.  As Chevalier reviews the stories from the campers, he gets a call from his publisher, rejecting his latest manuscript. Panicked, he picks up Benjamin's story, and it sparks his imagination. Chevalier changes Purvis' Bronco into Brutus, an extremely effeminate and comically flamboyant hero, changes the other character names and title, but otherwise leaves the story intact. His publisher loves it, and the novel is rushed into production under the title ''Brutus and Balzaak.''  Portions of Chevalier's version are now seen playing out alongside Benjamin's original vision of the story.  At the local premiere of Donaho's version of ''Yeast Lords'', Benjamin is nauseated to see how badly Donaho has adapted his work, and he abruptly leaves the film with Tabatha. They go to a bookstore where he discovers Chevalier's plagiarism after reading a paragraph from ''Brutus and Balzaak''. He confronts Chevalier at a local book signing, and assaults him with some merchandise Chevalier had offered him in exchange for keeping his theft quiet. Two policeman hustle him out of the store and he is placed in jail.  Judith comes to visit her son in jail to give him his birthday present. She hands him a box of manuscripts, all officially bound by the Writers Guild of America. She explains that she has been registering all his stories with them since he was seven years old, thinking they would make a nice keepsake for his children. ''Yeast Lords'' is one of the registered stories.  Copies of Chevalier's novel are unceremoniously dumped from store shelves and replaced with Benjamin's original novel.

They made plans to run away together, and when she didn't arrive at the agreed place, he went to her home to search for her. He discovered that her husband had attacked her with a hammer, knocking her out. The husband threw a kerosene lamp against a wall to set the house on fire and kill himself, the unconscious Mary Lee, and Bush. Bush freed himself from the attacking husband, but as his clothes caught fire, he also saw Mary Lee catch fire. As he went to put the fire out, he felt himself flying through the window, possibly pushed by the husband, and he was unable to re-enter the house to save Mary Lee.

George and A.J.
 The short starts out with a scene from ''Up'', where two nurses from the Shady Oaks Retirement Village knock on Carl Fredricksen's door to escort him to the nursing home. As seen in the film, Carl instead takes off in his house, while Russell braces himself underneath it. George and A.J. stare dumbfounded at the sky while their van's alarm goes off (it had been bumped by Carl's house).  They continue to stare dumbfounded when they return to the van, and in bed during the night. The next day, a news reporter does a story about sightings of a floating house. She attempts to get George and A.J.'s opinion, but they are still staring dumbfounded. Meanwhile, other senior citizens around the city, including at Shady Oaks, are watching the news report and celebrating Carl's "escape".   A week later, George and A.J. are back at their task of escorting elderly citizens to Shady Oaks in their van. Unfortunately, the seniors have gotten ideas from what Carl did, and every time George and A.J. come to a house to take a person away, the senior living there escapes with their house somehow. Finally, they arrive back at the Shady Oaks Retirement Village, only to find an old man outside the door who yells "So long, suckers!" and hits his cane against one of many canisters attached to the outside of the building; the other canisters soon follow and spew out a powerful gas. After the man goes inside, the entire building launches into the sky. Still dumbstruck, George and A.J. stare up. A few canisters fall down, and one lands on their van, setting off its alarm again. Suddenly, from behind them, a giant blimp starts to descend. It turns out to be Charles Muntz's ''Spirit of Adventure'' [[Airship|dirigible]], and Carl is flying it with Russell next to him. The airship lands on top of the van, crushing it and causing to effectively stop its alarm. Carl and Russell climb out and George incredulously says "Mr. ''Fredricksen''?" They walk past the nurses, and Russell mentions that next time he would like to steer. A.J. turns to George and says "That was the craziest thing I've ever seen!" They look down to find Dug in front of them. Dug speaks "Hi there!" through his collar, and George and A.J. are even more shocked than before.

Ghosts of Girlfriends Past
 Connor Mead ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) is a famous photographer and confirmed womanizer. He takes a break from his playboy lifestyle to attend his brother Paul's wedding, where he becomes reacquainted with Jenny Perotti ([[Jennifer Garner]]), Connor's childhood friend and the only girl who's ever captured his heart. After Connor delivers a drunken speech at the rehearsal dinner where he says that love isn't real, he's met in the bathroom by the ghost of his uncle Wayne ([[Michael Douglas]]), a roué who taught Connor everything he knows about seducing women. Wayne informs Connor that, over the course of the evening, he will be visited by three ghosts who will lead him through his romantic past, present, and future.  The first ghost is the "Ghost of Girlfriends Past" in the form of Allison Vandermeersh ([[Emma Stone]]), one of his high school girlfriends and his first lover. Together, they revisit scenes from his past, focusing on his relationship with Jenny. In 1982, Connor and Jenny were very close as children; she gave him his first [[instant camera]] which he used to take her picture, promising to keep it forever. When Connor's parents died in a car accident, Jenny consoled Connor throughout the years without them, as she, his brother Paul and his uncle Wayne were all he had left. By middle school, the two were on the verge of romance, but Connor's hesitation at asking her for a dance caused Jenny to dance with and kiss another boy. Heartbroken, Connor was told by Wayne that he must avoid romance at all costs in order not to feel such pain again. For the next two years, Wayne schooled Connor in the art of seduction. When he next saw Jenny, at a high school party, Connor ignored her and kissed another girl named Allison, whom he had his first sexual encounter with. Several years later, as adults, Connor and Jenny rekindled their romance, but Jenny forced him to woo her for several weeks in an attempt to rid him of his womanizing ways. After they finally did have sex, Connor fell in love with her, but while lying in bed to fall asleep beside her, he remembered his previous hurt by her in middle school and his uncle Wayne's warnings about sleeping and spooning with the opposite sex after a night of passion. Realizing this, he panicked, and ran out on her so he wouldn't be hurt again. The next morning, Jenny woke up alone and broken-hearted. His relationships thereafter consisted of a series of very short flings.  Awakening back in the Mead mansion in the present, Connor accidentally destroys Paul and Sandra's (his bride-to-be) wedding cake and unsuccessfully attempts to reconcile with Jenny. After his failed attempt, Connor returns to his uncle Wayne's room and finds another woman awaiting him in his bed, however, fearing that this woman was the next "Ghost”, Connor panics and runs out of his room. As he storms out of the house, he is confronted by the "Ghost of Girlfriends Present" in the form of his assistant Melanie ([[Noureen DeWulf]]), the only constant female figure in his life. With her, he sees that in his absence the other wedding guests make fun of him and his shallow lifestyle. Paul stands up for his brother, recalling that Connor helped raise him after their parents' deaths, and expresses his hope that Connor will someday change for the better. As the bridemaids discuss their love lives, one of them makes a remark about Jenny being emotionally twisted beyond recognition by Connor to the point that she's unable to move on to a new relationship. Jenny hears this and though Sandra tries to comfort her, Jenny leaves the room hurt and in tears. Melanie guides Connor to the kitchen to show him a crying Jenny as she tries to repair Paul and Sandra's wedding cake. Connor also sees that Jenny is being comforted by Brad ([[Daniel Sunjata]]), and is upset that his own actions and attitude are bringing the two closer. He is further upset to discover that Melanie and the three women whom he previously broke up with by [[conference call]] are bonding over his disregard for their feelings.  Upon awakening again, Connor hears a loud commotion coming from the house. Returning inside, he finds Sandra furious at learning that Paul had slept with one of her bridesmaids very early in their relationship, information that Connor had let slip earlier in the evening. Connor attempts to mend the situation but only makes things worse, and Paul tells him to leave. On his way out, he is confronted by the "Ghost of Girlfriends Future" (Olga Maliouk), who takes him forward in time to see that Jenny will eventually relinquish her feelings for him and move on to marry Brad, while Paul ends up not marrying Sandra and remains alone. Moreover, further into the future, an elderly Paul ends up being the only mourner at Connor's funeral. Wayne appears and tells Connor that this is his future if he continues on the same path, pushing him into the grave to be buried by his many ex-girlfriends.  Connor awakens in the Mead home and learns that Sandra has called off the wedding and is on her way to the airport. He intercepts the bridal party and convinces Sandra to forgive Paul by sharing lessons learned from his own mistakes, particularly that the pain of heartbreak is outweighed by the regret of never risking one's heart in the first place, something he admits to always regretting having done. Connor helps Jenny to restart the wedding, which he photographs, and afterwards he reconciles with Jenny by showing her the picture he still carries of her as a child and by promising to always be there when she wakes up. The two kiss and dance in the snow to the same song Connor hesitated to ask her to dance to back in middle school.  Meanwhile, Wayne tries to hit on the ghost of girlfriends future, but she magically vanishes after throwing a drink in his face. Then he tries to hit on the ghost of girlfriends present, but Melanie informs Wayne she is one of the attendees and vanishes. Melanie and Brad start talking and then dancing. Wayne is left with the ghost of girlfriends past, Allison, who is not interested since she is only 16. Wayne says that they are ghosts and therefore ageless.  
Giallo (film)
 [[Turin, Italy]]: [[France|French]] flight attendant Linda and [[Italian-American]] detective Enzo Avolfi team up to find Linda's younger sister Celine. Celine, a model, has been abducted by a serial killer. Known only as "Yellow" ("Giallo" in Italian) he kidnaps beautiful foreign women in his unlicensed taxi cab. After drugging them, the killer proceeds to mutilate and finally murder them. He photographs his deeds so that the photos may grant him personal sexual gratification.  Enzo receives a phone call from a fellow officer, who finds the body of an Asian woman outside a church near a fountain. They find out she's still alive, and starts to speak in Japanese. Enzo and Linda start to look for a translator, who tells them that the girl was praying Buddha and then repeated "yellow". They visit the morgue, where Linda realizes that the killer's face could be yellow, and the coroner tells Enzo that yellow skin is symptom of liver disease, so the killer might be in the waiting list for a new liver.  They go to hospital and find Giallo but he escapes. Enzo finds out his name is Flavio Volpe and gets his address. Giallo starts to torture Celine by cutting one of her fingers when she starts to bad-mouth him. Enzo breaks into Giallo's apartment, but finds it empty and full of torture devices.  Enzo tells Linda why he became a policeman: long ago, Enzo, who was 10, witnessed his mother being murdered by a local butcher, to whom she owed money. Five years later, Enzo kills the butcher in his own shop, while Inspector Mori knew why he did it. Mori took him in as if he were his own son. Enzo had kept the knife he used to kill the butcher as a reminder of how he became a cop. Enzo also tells Linda that Giallo might be a pattern killer who hates beautiful women, due to his deformity.  Over the course of the film, Enzo and Linda find more victims and clues as to who the killer is, and why he tortures them. An origin story shows that Giallo's mother was a prostitute that gave her son up for adoption at a church, where orphaned kids started to bully him. Celine tries to escape from Giallo, but gets captured. Just when he was about to strangle her, Celine tells him she's rich and will reward him with money.  Giallo breaks into Linda's apartment and demands a ransom for the safe return of Celine. The film ends with Enzo and Giallo having a shootout in a hotel. Giallo tries to escape, but falls from a skylight to the floor of the lobby, dying instantly. The police search his apartment for Celine, but cannot find her. They also try finding her at an abandoned gas factory where Giallo brings his victims.  Linda starts to blame Enzo for killing her sister, as well as calling him selfish and inhumane, because Giallo was going to tell her the location of where her sister is. Enzo tries to convince Linda that Giallo as a killer could not be trusted. After telling her this, he walks away, while Linda continues to berate him. By chance, while patrolling a car park, a policeman hears Celine as she tries to gain attention, tied up and gagged in the trunk of Giallo's car.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009 film)
 In December 2002, [[Mikael Blomkvist]], [[publisher]] of ''Millennium'' magazine, loses a [[Defamation|libel]] case involving allegations he published about billionaire [[financier]] Hans-Erik Wennerström. He is sentenced to three months in prison and a hefty fine. [[Lisbeth Salander]], a brilliant but damaged surveillance agent and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], is hired by Henrik Vanger, the [[patriarch]] of the wealthy Vanger family, to investigate Blomkvist. Vanger then hires Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, who vanished on [[Children's Day]] in 1966. Vanger believes that Harriet was murdered by a family member.  Salander, who was ruled [[mentally incompetent]] as a child, is appointed a new [[legal guardian]], Nils Bjurman ([[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]]), after her previous guardian suffers a [[stroke]]. Bjurman, a [[Sexual sadism|sexual sadist]], forces Salander to perform [[fellatio]] on him in return for the money she needs to buy a new computer; he withholds the full amount she has requested. At her next meeting with Bjurman, he beats and [[rape]]s her. Having used a [[hidden camera]] to record Bjurman raping her, Salander returns to take her [[revenge]], [[Torture|torturing]] and threatening to ruin him unless he gives her full control of her life and finances. She then uses a [[tattoo gun]] to brand Bjurman's abdomen with the message "I am a sadist pig and a rapist".  Blomkvist moves to a cottage on the Vanger estate and meets the Vanger family, including Harriet's brother Martin and cousin Cecilia. Inside Harriet's [[diary]], he finds a list of five names alongside what might appear to be phone numbers. He visits [[retired|retiring]] [[police inspector]] Morell, who informs him that his investigation team had been unable to decipher them. After viewing photographs taken during the Children's Day parade, Blomkvist sees Harriet's facial expression change suddenly just before she leaves and, after obtaining photographs taken from the same side of the street as her, comes to believe that Harriet may have seen her murderer that day.  Using her access to Blomkvist's computer, Salander learns that the numbers in Harriet's diary are references to verses in the [[Book of Leviticus]] and emails Blomkvist anonymously. Blomkvist works out that Salander sent the mail and hires her as a [[research assistant]]. Together, Blomkvist and Salander connect all but one of the names on Harriet's list to murdered women. They are all [[Jews|Jewish]] names, which intrigues Blomkvist, as the Vanger family has a long history of [[antisemitism]]. During the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander become lovers.  They suspect Henrik's reclusive brother Harald to be the murderer, as the two other Vanger brothers had already died by the time Harriet disappeared. Salander searches through Vanger's business records to trace Harald to the crime scenes, while Blomkvist breaks into Harald's house, believing it to be unoccupied. When Harald attacks Blomkvist, Martin appears and saves him. He escorts Blomkvist to his home, where Blomkvist reveals what he and Salander have uncovered. Martin drugs him. Salander's search of the company accounts points to Martin and his late father, Gottfried, having been jointly responsible for the murders. She returns to the cottage to find Blomkvist missing.  Blomkvist wakes to find himself bound in Martin's cellar. Martin boasts about raping and murdering women for decades but denies killing Harriet, insisting that she disappeared. As Martin is in the process of [[hanging]] Blomkvist, Salander appears and attacks Martin with a [[golf club]]. While she frees Blomkvist, Martin flees in his car. Salander gives chase on her [[motorcycle]]. When Martin drives off the road, Salander finds him still alive but trapped in the vehicle. As the car goes up in flames, she makes no attempt to save him.  Blomkvist realizes that Cecilia's late sister Anita was the near-double of Harriet and that some of the film taken on the day of Harriet's disappearance show Anita, not Harriet as previously thought. Blomkvist and Salander discover that Harriet has been using Anita's name and is still alive in [[Australia]]. Blomkvist flies there to look for her, and he persuades her to return to Sweden, where she is reunited with her uncle. Harriet explains the truth about her disappearance: that her father and her brother had repeatedly raped her; that she killed her father by drowning him, only to find herself being blackmailed by Martin; and that her cousin Anita had smuggled her away from the island.  Salander's mother, living in a nursing home, apologizes for not choosing a "better papa" for her. Salander then visits Blomkvist in prison and gives him new information on the Wennerström case. From prison, Blomkvist publishes a new story on Wennerström in ''Millennium'', which ruins Wennerström and makes the magazine a national sensation. Wennerström is then found dead, a presumed suicide. His offshore bank account in the [[Cayman Islands]] is raided; the police suspect a young woman caught on [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]], whom Blomkvist recognizes as Salander in disguise. The film ends with Salander, dressed in disguise as she exits her car, walking along a sunny beach promenade.  
The Girl Who Played with Fire (film)
 [[Lisbeth Salander]] ([[Noomi Rapace]]) purchases an apartment in [[Stockholm]]. On returning to [[Sweden]] after nearly a year living abroad, Salander reconnects with her former lover Miriam Wu (Yasmine Garbi) and offers her free use of her previous home in return for forwarding her mail. Later, Salander confronts Nils Bjurman ([[Peter Andersson (actor)|Peter Andersson]]) after hacking into his mail and discovering he has an appointment booked with a tattoo removal specialist. Threatening him with his own gun, she warns him not to remove the tattoo that she etched on his abdomen as revenge for [[sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] her, marking him as "a pervert, a [[rape|rapist]] and a [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] pig."  ''Millennium'' magazine welcomes Dag Svensson (Hans Christian Thulin), a new journalist who is writing an exposé on prostitution and [[human trafficking]] in Sweden. Dag's girlfriend, Mia Bergman, is writing her [[thesis|doctoral thesis]] on [[sex trafficking]]. Dag is nearly finished with the story and is confronting those who will be exposed by the article. Dag and his girlfriend are about to leave on a holiday and ask Mikael Blomkvist ([[Michael Nyqvist]]) to come to his apartment and collect some photographs. At the same time Dag also asks Mikael to inquire about someone called "Zala," who may have a connection to his present research. Mikael arrives at their apartment late at night to collect photographs for the article but finds the two sources lying dead. The murder weapon is tracked to Bjurman who is also deceased. Lisbeth Salander is the prime suspect, as her fingerprints happen to be on the gun as well. Salander tells Blomkvist that she did not kill anyone and that he needs to find the mysterious "Zala."  Mikael is contacted by Salander's boxing trainer and friend, [[Paolo Roberto]].  While he is unaware of Salander's whereabouts, Paolo does know Miriam, who also trained with them, and promises to pay her a visit. Near her apartment, Paolo witnesses Miriam being kidnapped by strongman Ronald Niedermann. Paolo follows his car to a deserted barn, where he hears him beat Miriam for information about Salander. Paolo comes in to rescue her but Niedermann is more than a match for the skilled boxer. Niedermann sets the barn aflame to finish the job, but the two manage to escape.  News breaks of the attack and Paolo gives his account to the police. After Blomkvist leaves information he has discovered about the case on his computer for Salander to hack into and read, she leaves a message to him saying, "Thank you for being my friend." He realizes that she intends to set out alone to find the man who framed her and that she may not survive. A disguised Salander visits Miriam in hospital to apologize for getting her involved. Without giving anything away, Salander confirms the police sketch of Niedermann with Miriam and then disappears. Knowing now that he is Salander's friend, Miriam calls Blomkvist to the hospital to give him keys that Lisbeth accidentally dropped during her visit. Noticing that one of them is for a post office box, Mikael is able to access and read Salander's mail and locate her apartment. Meanwhile, Salander continues her efforts to find Niedermann by patiently staking out his post office box. She eventually sees someone retrieve his mail and follows him to a small house near Gosseberga. Researching through the material in Lisbeth's apartment Blomkvist finds the video of Bjurman raping Salander.  In the offices of ''Millennium'' magazine, Paolo explains he tracked down Niedermann and learned that he has [[Congenital insensitivity to pain|congenital analgesia]] which makes him doubly formidable because he cannot feel pain. They trace Niedermann to a company owned by "Karl Axel Bodin." Blomkvist has Erika Berger make copies of the documents including the 1993 police report, forwards the originals to Bublanski and sets out to find Salander.  Salander crosses the grounds and enters the Gosseberga house, but Niedermann has been alerted by motion detectors and knocks her out. She awakens to see her father, Alexander "Zala" Zalachenko, an old man who walks with a stick and is heavily scarred by the burns she inflicted as a child. He dismisses her mother (who is now dead) as a whore and belittles her rape at the hands of Bjurman. He reveals that Niedermann is her half-brother. Niedermann killed Bjurman to prevent him from revealing any of Zalachenko's secrets. Zalachenko is confident he will not be caught, since being an invalid means the idea of his involvement in the murders lacks plausibility.  They lead Lisbeth to a shallow grave in the woods. She tells him the police will find him soon and all that he has said has been published online through her hidden cellphone. Seeing through her bluff, he shoots Lisbeth several times as she attempts to escape and buries her alive. Left for dead, Salander digs her way out using her silver-plated cigarette case gifted to her by Wu. Hidden in the woodshed, she surprises Zalachenko sticking an axe into his leg. She then keeps Niedermann at bay with Zalachenko's gun, just as Blomkvist comes coasting up the driveway. Ambulances and police arrive to take away Salander and Zalachenko who are both very badly injured.  
The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (film)
 The film begins at the conclusion of [[The Girl Who Played with Fire (film)|''The Girl Who Played with Fire'']]. Computer hacker [[Lisbeth Salander]] is airlifted to a hospital in [[Gothenburg]], to recover from gunshot wounds inflicted by her father, crime boss Alexander Zalachenko. Journalist [[Mikael Blomkvist]], who Salander helped on a previous case, resumes his efforts to clear her of several murder charges, knowing that she was framed by the "Section," a group within the [[Swedish Security Service]] that illegally sheltered Zalachenko after he defected from the [[Soviet Union]].  Section members Evert Gullberg and Fredrik Clinton decide to silence Zalachenko and Salander to preserve their secrets. Gullberg arrives at the hospital and kills Zalachenko, but is unable to reach Salander; he then commits suicide. Clinton plans to have Salander recommitted to the mental hospital where the Section had her institutionalized as a child after she nearly killed Zalachenko. His collaborator in this plan is Dr. Peter Teleborian, the hospital's administrator, who "treated" the young Salander by putting her in restraints for the smallest infractions.   Blomkvist persuades her doctor to sneak an [[Internet phone]] into Salander's room, whereupon Salander contacts her fellow hacker, Plague, to see if he can find something on Teleborian. She then tells Blomkvist that Annika Giannini, her lawyer and Blomkvist's sister, has permission to use a video showing her state-appointed guardian Nils Bjurman raping her; Bjurman, a former Section employee, is one of the people she is accused of murdering.   Ronald Niedermann, Zalachenko's son and enforcer who previously tried to kill Salander's girlfriend Miriam, has remained a fugitive, wanted for killing a police officer. Sonny, of an outlaw motorcycle gang that Salander encountered in the previous film, is informed that Niedermann went to his home to hide out. There, Sonny finds his brother dead and his girlfriend badly injured. She tells him that Niedermann was the culprit, and Sonny vows revenge.   On the day of her murder trial, Salander enters court with [[piercing]]s, a [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], black makeup, and black leather clothing. Called as an expert witness for the prosecution, Teleborian characterizes Salander as delusional and violent, but Giannini gradually demolishes his credibility, using Salander's words and files from the hospital. She shows the video proving Bjurman raped Salander.  As Giannini presents her case, the police arrest the people involved with the Section and seize their place of operation. In court, Blomkvist and Giannini prove that Teleborian made a false diagnosis on orders from the Section, and that the evidence against her was planted. Teleborian is then arrested for possession of [[child pornography]], which Plague had discovered after hacking into his laptop. The court releases Salander.  Salander goes to check on a property she has inherited from her father and discovers the warehouse where Niedermann was hiding. Niedermann tries to kill her, but she nails his feet to the floor with a nail gun. She calls Sonny and tells the bikers where to find him, and then calls the police.  Blomkvist visits Salander to tell her that the motorcycle gang killed Niedermann and were arrested at the warehouse afterwards. They then reconcile and go their separate ways.

However, as all of them attend the shooting of a film Braithwaite is featured in, tragedy befalls them. All three best friends and Braithwaite's new love interest and soon to be fiancée Sophia Tardelli (played by [[Kasia Smutniak]]) suffer a car accident which puts Muñez out of contention through injuries. Meanwhile, Liam Adams discovers to his horror that he has a new daughter, Bella, from former love interest June (played by [[Anya Lahiri]]).

It is revealed that Muñez is set to return to England as a [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] player under a two-year contract, along with Liam, who re-signs for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], the original club of both ex-Real players. The film goes on to depict the World Cup from the English perspective. Liam scores against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (2–2), assisted by a header from Charlie, and England qualify for the knock-out stages. However, in the match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], Charlie is injured, and later collapses in the changing room. He is rushed to hospital, and dies on the way from an aneurysm (from the car accident). England crash out of the quarter-finals against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] as Liam misses a crucial penalty against Portuguese goalkeeper [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] while [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] converts.

Unlike in the first two films, Roz, Glen Foy, and Gavin Harris do not feature in the film. Santiago implies that he and Roz did not get back together following their separation. As shown in the second movie, Foy was fired by Santiago. As for Harris, it was time he retired. All actual professional footballers are shown through stock World Cup footage. The sporting role of the actors in this film is limited to the green screen. In selected scenes, professional lookalike Derek Williams is used as a double for Sven-Göran Eriksson.  This movie reveals the end of the Goal! trilogy as the dream ends.  
Glorious 39
 In present-day London, Michael Walton visits his cousins, Walter and Oliver Page. Interested in family history, he asks them about his great aunt, Anne Keyes, the sister of his grandmother, Celia. Anne, an actress, was the eldest of the three Keyes children. Desperate for children, her father, Alexander, a [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]], and mother, Maud, had adopted her.  However, Maud subsequently gave birth to Ralph and Celia. Michael is curious to learn what happened to Anne, which leads Walter to reminisce about the summer of 1939, at the Keyes' estate in Norfolk.  On Alexander's birthday, Anne has prepared a table in the garden to celebrate. Anne's friend, the outspoken [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] Hector, and lover, the reserved Lawrence, are present for the festivities. When Alexander arrives he brings a guest, the quiet government employee Joseph Balcombe. During dinner Hector rants about Britain's lack of action against [[Nazi Germany]]. It is later revealed that he has been one of those calling out for a new prime minister.  The next day, while looking for a cat in one of the property's sheds, which are off-limits as they are used for storing Alexander's private papers, Anne finds gramophone records labelled "Foxtrot".  These prove to contain recorded meetings and telephone conversations. Alexander reveals that he has allowed Balcombe to store government documents in the shed.  Two weeks later, Anne is notified that Hector has been found dead, from an apparent suicide. Anne wonders if Balcombe had anything to do with Hector's death. Alexander brushes off the idea, but does offer to ask Balcombe to remove the records from the shed, something he promises to do the next day during a picnic. While there, the picnickers go for a walk, leaving Anne to watch over baby Oliver. She awakens to find Oliver and his pushchair missing. She follows his cries to no avail, and when the family returns, they search, until they find him in his pushchair on a lane. Anne denies moving the baby, but the incident plants roots of doubt about Anne's word.  Balcombe removes the records that night, but Anne secretly keeps two of them. The family then returns to London because Parliament has been recalled. While there Anne listens to the records. One contains a recording of a distressed Hector pleading with Balcombe to cease calling him and his parents. However, the maid bursts into the room, which causes the gramophone to fall and the record to break into pieces. On [[World War II#War breaks out in Europe|1 September]] Anne gives a second record to her fellow actor and friend Gilbert. He is later found dead from apparent suicide.  Anne travels back to Norfolk to keep Aunt Elizabeth company, where she listens to the second recording. On it she recognises Balcombe's voice, along with that of her brother, Ralph. Ralph is heard suggesting the name "Thin Man Dancing" for a covert operation; a reference to a childhood toy. At a party in London, Anne attempts to tell Lawrence of Ralph's involvement, but he already knows. Lawrence convinces Anne to bring him the recording at a rendezvous at a suburban veterinary surgery. After Anne finds Lawrence's body in a shed filled with [[British_Pet_Massacre|euthanised pets]], she escapes and gives the recording to a child, who promises to post it to Churchill.  She is subsequently recaptured, drugged by her father and held prisoner in Aunt Elizabeth's house, which is close to [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Balcombe pays her a visit and shows her the second recording, which he had intercepted.  He tells her that it had been made for her father. He also informs her that their house in London is being used for series of pro-appeasement meetings that her father is chairing.  Alexander later admits to her that he believes Britain will be destroyed unless it secures an early peace with Germany. He says that she is the only member of the family that does not share his beliefs, which is why they are keeping her secure. They deprive her of water and leave her to die.  But, after some time, Maud releases her while the rest of the family is at the park. Anne goes past them, and when they act as though nothing has happened, she runs away.  Back in the present, Walter tells Michael that Anne had died in [[Canada]] twenty years ago, and that he had just been doing what his family and Balcombe had wanted. It is then revealed that Balcombe had convinced Walter to move Oliver's pushchair into the lane. Michael asks Oliver and Walter to accompany him to meet his mother. They travel to the same park where Anne had last seen her family. A woman, Michael's mother, wheels an elderly woman towards them. That elderly woman is Anne, and Michael tells them that he knew the truth all along but wanted to hear it from them.  
Goemon (film)
  As a child, [[Ishikawa Goemon]]'s ([[Yōsuke Eguchi]]) entire family was [[assassination|assassinated]] for political reasons. His mother (Ryo) sent Goemon away for safety minutes before he witnessed her death. Running away with his caretaker, they were attacked by bandits but he was saved by the great [[Oda Nobunga|Nobunaga Oda]] (Hashinosuké Nakamura). Goemon followed Nobunaga and [[Hattori Hanzō]] ([[Susumu Terajima]]) was assigned to train him in the ways of the shinobi ([[ninja]]) along with his martial brother, [[Kirigakure Saizō|Saizō]] (Takao Osawa).  After many years of training, Goemon was assigned to protect Oda's niece, [[Princess]] [[Yodo-dono|Chacha]] ([[Ryōko Hirosue]]). They developed feelings for each other, but [[social status|status differences]] kept them apart and eventually she departed. Before leaving, Chacha gave Goemon her favourite fan as a [[Souvenir|memento]]. Oda rewarded Goemon's faithful protection of Chacha by giving him his double-bladed [[sword]]. Meanwhile, Oda's generals, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] ([[Eiji Okuda]]) and [[Akechi Mitsuhide]] ([[Kazuaki Kiriya]]), conspired to kill Nobunaga. The two made a secret written covenant, placing their signatures onto a black scroll. Mitsuhide, not trusting Hideyoshi, had his men hide the contract. After assassinating Nobunaga, Hideyoshi betrayed and killed Mitsuhide, took credit for slaying Nobunaga's killer and became the next ruler of Japan. With Nobunaga dead, the two young ninjas parted ways for different pursuits: Saizo hopes to be elevated to Samurai status and chose to remain in service to Nobunaga house, but Goemon chose to leave and be free. As a parting gift, Goemon broke his double-bladed sword in two and gave one-half to Saizo.  Years later, Goemon became a master thief and something of a [[Robin Hood]]. [[Sarutobi Sasuke]] ([[Gori (comedian)|Gori]]), an inexperienced [[bounty hunter]], tried to arrest Goemon, but failed and became his private servant instead. During a festival, Goemon infiltrated and robbed a treasure repository that contained a mysterious box with foreign writing on it. [[Ishida Mitsunari]] ([[Jun Kaname]]), a high-ranking samurai under Lord Hideyoshi, tried to retrieve this box to destroy it, but Goemon escaped with it, leaving behind only his calling card: a red sticker with the Japanese character "Go" on it. Goemon, unaware of the value of the box, threw it away and distributed the gold to the poor. A young pick-pocket, Koheita, picked up the mysterious box and kept it as a memento. The following day, Goemon learned of the box's value from Sasuke. Intrigued by the box, Goemon returned to the city to find it. Searching around the slums for the box, Goemon heard a scream and finds Koheita and his mother, who had just been callously murdered by cruel and petty local samurai. Goemon saved Koheita and retrieved the box, but also took Koheita under his wing.  Saizo and his ninja squad, working for Mitsunari, appeared and confronted Goemon. Refusing to turn over the box, Goemon fled and was pursued by Saizo's ninjas. Goemon evaded all of his pursuers except Saizo, who remained close behind him. In a showdown between the former brothers, Saizo informed him that the box Goemon carried was referred to as a "Pandora's Box" by foreigners, and the two engaged in a duel. After Goemon was overpowered and about to be killed by Saizo, Hattori Hanzo appeared and intervened, causing Saizo to withdraw. After returning to the city, Goemon examined the "empty box" and discovered a map to a mysterious treasure. Following the map, Goemon and Sasuke were led to the destroyed Buddha statue where Akechi Mitsuhide had hidden his contract with Hideyoshi. Goemon became angry once he learned that Hideyoshi was involved with Nobunaga's death. Hattori Hanzo then reappeared, under the command of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] ([[Masatō Ibu]]). Hanzo offered his old student a bag of gold for the contract, which Goemon readily agrees to. Seeking vengeance for his murdered lord, Goemon infiltrated Lord Hideyoshi's castle, where he killed Lord Hideyoshi and discovered Princess Chacha. Startled by another person entering, Goemon hid himself in the ceiling of Chacha's room, losing Chacha's fan as he did so. To Goemon's [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]], the real Hideyoshi entered the room. Goemon had only killed his fake double. Suddenly, one of Lord Hideyoshi's guards discovered Goemon and shot him in the chest, blowing him out of the castle and into the moat. Later, Goemon was secretly rescued and recovered by Saizo.  Goemon was then contacted by Hanzo, who took him to a [[waterfall]] to meet Chacha. The princess had come to bid him farewell and returned the fan as she had reluctantly agreed to become Hideyoshi's concubine. Afterwards, Lord Tokugawa arrived to ask Goemon to assassinate Hideyoshi in order to save Chacha and the country. Elsewhere, Lord Mitsunari offered Saizo samurai status in return for killing Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon and Lord Tokugawa crafted a plan to assassinate Lord Hideyoshi during a celebration on his royal boat, but upon receiving his secret signal, Goemon changed his mind and did not complete the plan. Moments later, all of Lord Hideyoshi's escort ships were destroyed by explosives set by Saizo and his team; they captured Lord Hideyoshi and tried to assassinate him by hanging him from the ship's [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] with a steel chain. Lord Mitsunari, believing Lord Hideyoshi to be dead, then turned on Saizo and shot him. However, Lord Hideyoshi survived the assassination attempt and Saizo survived the gunshot wound. Lord Hideyoshi, unaware of [[Lord]] Mitsunari's [[betrayal]], [[interrogation|interrogated]] Saizo and threatened to kill Saizo's family unless he revealed who [[renting|hired]] him.  Meanwhile, Goemon tried to rescue Chacha, but because Lord Hideyoshi was still alive, she refused to leave. Later, against Sasuke's warnings, Goemon rescued Saizo from prison. Unfortunately, Lord Mitsunari killed Saizo's wife in reprisal and left a note on her body telling Saizo he had taken Saizo's child. Saizo was later recaptured and Lord Hideyoshi decreed Saizo should be boiled to death during an elaborate public execution. Hideyoshi told Saizo he would spare his child's life if he would reveal his name so he falsely identified himself as Goemon. Yelling in the huge crowd, Goemon tried to stop the execution but he could only watch in horror as Lord Hideyoshi kicked Saizo into the cauldron and then threw in the child. Sasuke, in shock over all of the carnage, blamed on Goemon and abandoned him.  With the help of Saizo's surviving team, Goemon stormed through the palace and eventually reached Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon wanted to know why Lord Hideyoshi had betrayed Lord Nobunaga. Hideyoshi explained it was his insatiable hunger for power that had driven him and Goemon eventually killed him. With Hideyoshi dead, there was a power vacuum that the strongest fought for. Tokugawa and Mitsunari raised their own armies to decide who would be the next ruler of Japan; but Goemon, tired of all the deaths and suffering, decided to intervene.  Goemon charged into the battle, wearing Lord Nobunaga's armor and carrying the repaired double-bladed sword. The armies were fearful and confused as they saw the crimson armor of Nobunaga. Goemon fought through the armies until he confronted and killed Mitsunari during a solar eclipse. Superstitious over the eclipse, Mitsunari's army fled in fear. Goemon then charged through Tokugawa's army, but Hattori Hanzo appeared and intercepted him mid-way. Goemon immobilized his former master by pinning Hanzo's foot to the ground with a broken sword blade. Approaching Tokugawa, Goemon closed the distance seemingly with apparent intent to kill, but was intercepted by Sasuke (who had joined Tokugawa's army). Mortally wounded by Sasuke, Goemon staggered and it was revealed that he was only holding Chacha's fan; instead of trying to kill Tokugawa, Goemon only planned to get him to promise that there would finally be peace and then leave. Goemon tries to make his way back to Chacha, but falls to the ground from his wounds. In his final moments, he admires the [[Firefly|fireflies]] and stars while Chacha cries, never to see Goemon again.

When Willy's teacher goes on maternity leave, she is replaced by Mr. Nerdlinger, a children's book writer who desperately wants to become famous. When he catches sight of Gooby, he becomes determined to photograph him.

Grace (2009 film)
  After two unsuccessful attempts to have a child, Michael and Madeline succeed the third time. Michael's domineering mother Vivian would rather they use her preferred doctor and friend, Dr. Sohn, as their obstetrician, but Madeline wants to consult her midwife friend Patricia, who is also an ex-girlfriend of hers.   One night, Michael rushes Madeline to the hospital because of chest pain. Dr. Sohn comes at Vivian's request. Just before he administers drugs to induce labor, Patricia arrives. She challenges his diagnosis and determines through bloodwork (which he has ignored) that inducement is not necessary. Madeline is treated and released, and on the way home, a car accident kills Michael and the unborn baby. Madeline refuses to go to the hospital to begin induction of labor, so Patricia allows Madeline to carry to term. When the stillborn girl, is delivered, Madeline is left alone with her, presumably to say goodbye. However, when Patricia returns, the baby is miraculously alive. Overjoyed, Madeline names the baby Grace.   Patricia later visits Madeline at home and encourages her to take Grace to the hospital for tests to help understand how she revived. Citing her recent experience with Dr. Sohn, Madeline refuses any involvement with conventional medicine. But as Madeline cares for Grace, strange things keep happening in her home. She resorts to hanging fly paper in the nursery because Grace is attracting them due to her putrid scent, even when her diaper isn't soiled. Madeline tries to bathe her daughter, but Grace's [[Degloving|skin begins to bleed]]. Madeline attempts to contact Patricia for help, but can only reach the clinic's answering machine and Patricia's jealous girlfriend, who does not pass on her messages. After attempts at feeding Grace end with vomiting, Madeline realizes that the baby is unable to digest breast milk.  In the meantime, Vivian wants to visit the baby and attempts to call Madeline, but she will not answer. She visits Dr. Sohn and convinces him to visit Madeline while looking to collect proof that she is an unfit mother in order to raise Grace herself.  Madeline discovers that Grace's nursing is painful to the point of causing her breast to bleed, and realizes that the child is feeding on her blood. At first, she's able to feed Grace beef blood from a bottle, but Grace can't digest it, forcing Madeline to continue feeding Grace her own blood. Madeline becomes weakened to the point that she allows Dr. Sohn into her home when he calls on her. He explains that she is [[Anemia|anemic]], and instructs her to refrain from nursing for a few days. After hearing Grace cry weakly, he starts upstairs, dialing Vivian's number on his cellphone. Fearing that he will take Grace away, Madeline beats Dr. Sohn unconscious, but not before his call connects.  Vivian arrives just as Madeline finishes draining blood from Dr. Sohn's arm into a baby bottle. She agrees to leave, but instead finds Grace in her crib, and the bottle of Dr. Sohn's blood broken on the floor. Madeline tries to pursue her, but Vivian is able to grab Grace and look for a hiding place, discovering Dr. Sohn's body in the process. She arms herself with a hammer; Madeline confronts her, and Vivian beats Madeline unconscious with the hammer, but not before Madeline rips out part of her mother-in-law's throat with her teeth. They are discovered by Patricia, who realized her girlfriend was withholding Madeline's messages and decided to investigate.  Some time later, Patricia is driving a motor home through the desert. She pulls over and goes to the back to check on Madeline and Grace. She asserts that medical tests have confirmed Grace is as healthy as she looks, and as long as Madeline keeps eating the proper diet, they can continue feeding and raising Grace. Madeline is concerned about something else, however: Grace has begun teething. She pulls up her shirt to reveal that a large chunk of her breast has been chewed away.

Green Lantern: First Flight
 Before any other sentient beings existed in the universe, a race of beings calling themselves the [[Guardians of the Universe]] harnessed the power of the ''green element'', the greatest power in the universe, to create the [[Green Lantern]] battery. However, the battery was vulnerable to the color yellow, the one part of the light spectrum that could resist green. The Guardians hid the most concentrated source of yellow energy, the ''yellow element'', to prevent others from using it against them.  After the death of [[Abin Sur]], several Green Lanterns arrive to take Ferris Aircraft's test pilot [[Hal Jordan]] ([[Christopher Meloni]]) to the [[Green Lantern Corps]] on Oa. He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer [[Sinestro]] ([[Victor Garber]]), who is investigating Abin's murder. While undercover on the ship of [[Kanjar Ro]] ([[Kurtwood Smith]]) searching for the whereabouts of the stolen yellow element, Abin had come under attack. Fleeing to Earth, he had his ring find his successor and died of his injury shortly after. Unbeknownst to the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro had provided Kanjar with the location of the element in order to have it fashioned into a weapon of comparable power to the Green Lantern battery.  Jordan quickly comes to understand that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line with those of the Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking up the messes criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan. As punishment, the Guardians strip Jordan of his ring.  While Jordan waits to be taken home, Sinestro uses his ring to temporarily animate Kanjar's corpse, allowing him to learn the location of [[Qward]] where the yellow element weapon is being fashioned. Jordan convinces fellow Lanterns [[Boodikka]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]) and [[Kilowog]] ([[Michael Madsen]]) that Sinestro is not what he seems. When they catch Sinestro enacting his plot, Boodikka reveals her true allegiance and incapacitates Kilowog, allowing Sinestro to escape. Jordan tricks her into destroying Kanjar's unstable energy staff, the explosion launching her into the tools hanging from the ceiling and killing her.  On Qward, the Weaponers bestow Sinestro with the yellow ring and battery, the latter of which resembles [[Ranx the Sentient City]]. Using its power, he lays waste to Oa, the yellow light easily overpowering the Green Lantern rings. The yellow battery destroys the green battery, rendering all the Green Lantern Corps' power rings inert and causing death by asphyxiation of countless Green Lanterns who were in space at the time of their rings' failure. Jordan, having recovered his ring moments too late, finds the battery and pounds on the inert green element. He places his ring on the small crack that appears, absorbing the whole of its power. Imbued with the full might of the green energy, he destroys the yellow battery by crushing it between two moons.  Having exhausted most of the green power to destroy the yellow battery, Jordan is left to fight against Sinestro under his own power. After an intense hand-to-hand battle without constructs, Jordan uses the last of his power to knock Sinestro to the surface of Oa where Kilowog crushes the yellow ring (as well as Sinestro's hand) with his foot. Having regained partial power to his ring earlier, Kilowog takes to the air and saves Jordan from a fatal fall to the planet's surface.  Once Oa is rebuilt and the Green Lantern battery restored, the Guardians give the privilege of leading the Corps in reciting the [[Green Lantern#Green Lantern Oath|Green Lantern oath]] to Jordan. Jordan then leaves for Earth to check in with his other boss, [[Carol Ferris]] ([[Olivia d'Abo]]), remarking on the long "[[Commuting|commute]]".

In prison, the GSE quickly discover the brutality of life on the inside, as they are constant targets of the superior numbered and better-financed [[Chelsea Headhunters|Chelsea]] crew. After a quick brawl the GSE get blamed for the assault and are transported to another prison where a huge number of Bushwackers are waiting for them. Soon after arrival the crew meet up with Marc and his crew, who declare their intentions to make the GSE's time in the prison tough. After throwing an insult about their deceased leader, Pete, they fight, are restrained and are, once again, blamed for the incident.  Soon after, Dave meets up with some Spurs supporters, who offer him advice about surviving in prison. They soon find out that this is not easy, because the Bushwackers are aided by a high ranking prison officer, Veronica, who flagrantly abuses her power to aid them, and also provides them with [[cigarettes]] and [[drugs]]. She also gives them a key to go where they want, which they use to attack a GSE member in Segregation, who is only narrowly rescued by an officer, Officer Mason, who also aids the GSE. They also use this key to gain access to and punish inmates who either cross them or do not follow on with payments.  The GSE realize that in order to survive, they need to stand their ground and, with the assistance of Dave, they corner and assault two of the Millwall fans. Soon after this Marc threatens Dave. Dave uses Marc's tactic against him and by beating up the Millwall fans and pretending to be the victims. Angered, Marc gains access to segregation where Dave is sleeping after being sent there and assaults him. However, after one too many Pete taunts, Dave gains the upper hand and is seen to be winning the brawl until Veronica and several police officers break it up.  Due to lack of space, the prison Governor asks Veronica and Officer Mason to select 60 people to set free, under the circumstances that they will not damage society if let go. Veronica intentionally chooses most of the Millwall fans, even though they are mostly troublesome, but the Governor spots this. Officer Mason provides a more suitable list of which he agrees to, apart from the three members of the GSE who have been trouble since they came. Veronica then asks for three of her Millwall fans to be set free instead, but the Governor has an idea to let them compete for this prize by arranging a football match.  Marc notices Dave's girlfriend at several visiting days and orders two of his friends on the outside to keep her hostage. Marc threatens Dave that he will kill his girlfriend unless he throws the match. Before the match begins, Dave informs his friend, Max of what is going to happen and tells him to call his friend to go over to the house and save his girlfriend.  As the match begins, a gruesome fight breaks out while play is going on and Dave deliberately plays badly so Millwall can win. However, the GSE arrive at Dave's house to save his girlfriend. Max then gives Dave the signal that she is okay, and Dave stops throwing the game. Millwall stand no chance with West Ham outplaying them completely and Dave scoring the winning goal. After the game ends, Marc, now distressed at Dave, goes up to him and threatens him, but Dave laughs in his face. He then orders his men to kill Dave's girlfriend, only to discover that the GSE are at the other end of his phone. At that moment, he and his two friends are detained for kidnapping Dave's girlfriend and Veronica is also arrested on a charge of drugs trafficking (Officer Mason had secretly informed on her). Officer Mason is promoted and Dave and his friends are set free.  The film ends with the 3 boys out of prison and, though Dave wants to spend time with his girlfriend, the GSE have organized a party for them to celebrate, which they accept.

Grotesque (2009 film)
 A young couple Aki and Kazuo are snatched off the street while having their first date as a romantic couple after a few years working in the same office. They wake up shackled in a basement that has plastic-covered walls. With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. He punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, drives nails into his scrotum, then sexually assaults each in turn, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes, he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. This way, he cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples and cuts off her right arm.   As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation, and tells the couple he wants the two to survive. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs, so no longer needs the couple's "services". The couple is moved to a room which resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of the couple's wounds. It gradually becomes apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, taste for classical music and good wines and dresses in expensive clothes when he is not in surgeon dress. He even mentions he is a wealthy man, which suggests he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme way to obtain satisfaction in his lonely life. The couple also notes the doctor has a particular rotting smell always present behind his clean and elegant appearance.   After several days healing, the "doctor" simply tells the couple they will be free to go, he will turn himself to authorities and, as apology for all the suffering he inflicted to the couple, he will give them all his fortune which seems to be very large, as compensation. After all the horror, in a moment alone in the hospital room, Aki and Kazuo promise to support each other once they leave and become a couple. It is unclear if the madman is playing with the couple's hopes to survive; immediately after telling them they will be released, the couple is taken back to the basement. After being drugged, they are shackled again, exactly as they were the first time.   The "doctor" announces they must participate in one final test of love. He pulls out some of Kazuo's intestines and attaches them to a hook. If Kazuo is able to cross the room to the other side (pulling his entire intestine out of his body in the process), take scissors and cut Aki's ropes to release her, both will be freed. However, Kazuo fails due to blood loss (it is also revealed that the ropes restraining Aki have a metal wire running through them, rendering them impossible to cut with scissors; the task was therefore impossible).   Aki begins to insult the doctor and says that despite his classy appearance, he has a skunk odor. Angered, the doctor cuts off Aki's head. The head lands on the doctor's neck; she bites him with her final breath. Kazuo, not dead yet, stabs him in the foot with the scissors as a supreme last action.

Here Dilip meets Rananjay Singh “Ransa” ([[Abhimanyu Singh]]), a prince who despises the ideologies of his father and the aristocracy. Ransa's straightforward and fearless personality has quite an effect on the mild-mannered Dilip.  Dilip visits the university hostel where he is [[Ragging|ragged]] by a gang of university thugs, led by Jadwal ([[Pankaj Jha]]). They strip him and lock him in a room with Anuja ([[Jesse Randhawa]]), a young lecturer in the same university. Dilip and Anuja are released naked. Dilip's brother tells him to ignore the event and that things were the same in his days, effectively stating that the society as a whole hasn’t changed much since his time. But Ransa disagrees and tells Dilip that they should avenge this act. Initially, Dilip is reluctant but gives in and goes with Ransa, after Ransa provokes him to give the thugs a taste of their own medicine. But the tables are turned and Dilip and Ransa are beaten, ragged, and thrown out of the hostel. Ransa meets Dukey Bana ([[Kay Kay Menon]]), a local figure who is trying to gather support for the [[Rajputana]] separatist movement, who allows them to proceed with the plan to injure Jadwal. Ransa and Dilip ambush Jadwal, but the other thugs corner them in a cinema hall. Dukey Bana intervenes and rescues them. Dukey Bana then convinces Ransa to compete in the General Secretary Elections at the university. Running against Ransa is his father's out-of-wedlock daughter, Kiran (Ayesha Mohan).  Ransa is kidnaped by his father's out-of-wedlock son Karan ([[Aditya Srivastava]]), who asks him to withdraw from the elections. Ransa mocks him and Karan kills him. Taking advantage of the situation, Dukey Bana makes Dilip take Ransa's place in the election. The chances of Dilip winning are minimal, so Dukey Bana bribes the electoral panel to rig the count in Dilip's favour. Dilip wins the election to become the general secretary. Kiran then seduces Dilip and convinces him to allow her to become the cultural secretary. Dukey Bana starts using the funds for the Rajputana separatist movement. When Dilip finds out, he goes to confront Dukey Bana about the funds. Bana lets Dilip know about the movement and tells him that the funds are being used for it. Dilip is not convinced and tries to reason with Bana.  A frustrated Bana takes Dilip to his country estate where his thugs have killed Jadwal. He shows him the body to intimidate him. Anuja is thrown out of the hostel and moves in with Dilip. Kiran gets pregnant and is angry with Dilip for being careless. She gets an abortion and leaves Dilip. Anuja tries to make Dilip understand that Kiran has no interest in leading a married life and leaves him. A frustrated Dilip resigns from his post and Kiran steps in.  In a private meeting, an irate Dukey threatens Karan and Kiran by telling them that the only reason they're alive is because of their links to the local king. She then tries to seduce Dukey Bana. She fails when Bhati ([[Deepak Dobriyal]]), Dukey's second-in-command, comes looking for Dukey.  Dilip, blinded by his love for Kiran, becomes violent and aggressive. Anuja also decides to leave him. Meanwhile, Dilip finds out about Kiran from Bana's mistress, Madhuri ([[Mahi Gill]]). He grabs a gun, goes to Bana's house and shoots him. While dying, Bana tells him that Kiran used Dilip to get to him. At the same time, Karan reveals to his group of thugs that once Dukey Bana is out of the way, the Rajputana movement will have no choice but to choose Karan as its new leader and, therefore, legitimise his royal status. They conclude that, to get rid of Dukey, they must first eliminate Bhati. Dilip wants to hear the truth from Kiran, so he tells Bhati to get her on the phone. Kiran refuses to answer. Bhati goes off to find her and is killed by Karan's thugs. Dilip meets Kiran who tells him that all she wanted to was use him to become general secretary. Dilip rejects her explanation and almost shoots her but gets shot by thugs. Despite his injuries, Dilip walks back to his house and dies there. The film ends with Karan as the head of the Rajputana movement, while Kiran sheds a tear as one of the loyal faithful.  Parallel to the plot there is the character of Dukey Bana's brother Prithvi Bana ([[Piyush Mishra]]). He wears bizarre dress and seems a psychotic. He talks very satirically and is often abused and slapped by Dukey banna for this. It is told in flashback that he was a guitarist in his young days. Along with him there is a person characterised as [[Ardhanarishvara]], who is killed by Dukey Bana mistakenly when Dukey Bana was outraged with his brother and aims to shoot him and misses.

He tells Miley that Hannah is out of control and Miley needs to remember who she truly is. Leaving for an award show, the Stewarts instead arrive in Crowley Corners for Miley's grandmother Ruby's birthday. Miley is angry at her father for the switch but Robby Ray points out that this is the life she could have had. Despite Miley's protests, Robby Ray decides to spend two weeks in Crowley Corners and falls in love with a woman named Lorelai. Miley eventually warms to her hometown when she rekindles a connection with childhood friend Travis Brody.  Nevertheless, Miley is eager to resume her Hannah duties and becomes chastened after Ruby snaps that she seems to prefer being Hannah Montana over spending time with her family. Miley tries to write new songs but Travis ignores her and she develops writer's block. Meanwhile, conflict grows between residents and land developer Mr. Bradley, who wants to destroy part of the town to build a shopping mall. At a barn party, several singers contribute to a charity to save Crowley Corners, singing "Back to Tennessee" and "[[Crazier (Taylor Swift song)|Crazier]]". Miley sings as herself with "[[Hoedown Throwdown]]" until Mr. Bradley arrives to tell the townspeople they will not stop him. Travis suggests that Miley ask Hannah Montana to make an appearance, unaware that Hannah is Miley's alter ego.  Miley does not know what to do until Lilly arrives, disguised as Hannah, offering to help. As the two make up, Miley confides her difficulties, adjusting to farm life while trying to be herself and Hannah. Oswald takes pictures of the girls, believing Lilly to be Hannah Montana, and Lilly realizes she inadvertently led Oswald there and apologizes. The town is overjoyed to have Hannah Montana but Travis is unimpressed and admits to Hannah that he has a crush on Miley. As Hannah, Miley urges Travis to ask Miley out and he does, but Miley has already been invited to dinner with the mayor by Lorelai. Miley tries to be in two places at once but accidentally lets her guard down and is caught by Travis mid-switch. Miley finishes writing "[[Butterfly Fly Away]]" which she and Robby sing together to cheer up. Miley completes the chicken coop that she and Travis were building; touched by this, Travis goes to the concert to support Miley.  Seeing Travis arrive, Hannah stops mid-song and explains to the crowd that she cannot live a lie anymore, especially when she is home. Hannah then removes her blond wig, revealing her secret identity. She then sings "[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]" and announces that she's not going to be Hannah Montana anymore and that she'll be returning home to Tennessee for good. The crowd pleads her to continue being Hannah Montana, promising not to reveal her secret, but Oswald is in the crowd and takes a picture. His twin daughters arrive, having missed the Hannah reveal, and their excitement and enthusiasm for Hannah convinces him to not sell the story, quitting his job. Miley kisses Travis and then returns to the stage to finish with the song "[[You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home]]". Miley leaves Tennessee to resume her double life but with greater perspective and a better attitude.   
Happily N'Ever After 2: Snow White—Another Bite @ the Apple
   Snow White’s parents, Queen Grace and King Cole, are very kind to their citizens; as Queen Grace will go around helping any citizen in need. One day, Queen Graces suddenly fell ill and died but before telling Snow White, "The mirror only tells half the story. True beauty comes from helping others."  Since Queen Grace died when Snow White was young, she had never taught Snow White how to help the citizens. Since then, Snow White turns into a misguided teenager who only likes to hang out with her friends: Goldilocks, Little Bo Peep, and Little Red Riding Hood than helping the citizens. A prime example is when Snow White and her friends decide to go to a [[jousting|joust]] party instead of visiting an orphanage. That day, her father strictly told her to return before morning and wear the royal robe. Instead, she takes it off and leaves it in the limo. She meets and falls in love with a handsome man. He doesn't return the feeling because of Snow White’s behavior towards “riffraff”s and his respects to Queen Grace.  When Snow White returns, her father is upset because she did not wear the robe (he found out on the newspaper). Snow White weeps about him being unfair and runs to her room. Her father notices her misguided side and decides to find a wife like Queen Grace to show Snow White how to become a proper lady. His assistant goes to the Fairy Godmother for help, where she begins a marriage service.  Because of Mambo’s mischief, the scales of good and evil are tipped to extreme evil, causing Lady Vain to turn evil and Rumpelstiltskin to appear. Rumpelstiltskin (who seems to have become evil again due to the scales) uses the Magic Mirror to turn Lady Vain’s face into Queen Grace’s. She goes to the marriage service and King Cole accepts her, not knowing that Lady Vain is truly a horrible scheming witch who wants to rule the kingdom.  Snow White is a thorn to Lady Vain's side and she wants Snow White gone from the kingdom. Just then, an apple appears, due to the imbalance of the scales. It, when given to Snow White, will make her say the rudest things she had ever thought. Lady Vain has Rumpelstiltskin give Snow White a fake make-over. They give her the evil apple and, with the Magic Mirror, Snow White says the rudest things she had ever thought to the whole town, including King Cole. Snow White wakes up not remembering what had happened or what she had said and decides to visit the town.  Because of the rude things she said, Snow White is forced to leave and runs to the forest. She enters a familiar house, eats, and falls asleep on seven small beds. When she wakes up, she finds the Seven Dwarves completely enraged with her coming inside without permission. One notices her to be Queen Grace's daughter, although her personality is not like her mother’s. They convince Snow White to stay and plan to change her attitude to be just like her mother’s. Snow White agrees to do whatever the Dwarves tell her to do without questioning them or whining back. They go to help rebuilt the Three Little Pigs' homes after being blown by the Big Bad Wolf. She also helps the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe to turn into the most beautiful woman ever. And she helps babysit her children. Meanwhile, Lady Vain’s wedding day is drawing closer.  During baby-sitting, Snow White sings to her children the same [[Hush, Little Baby]] lullaby her mother used to sing to her when she was young and realizes that helping others makes her and them feel good. With that, she starts her own Snow White's Help Center. Meanwhile, at the kingdom, everyone is excited to meet Lady Vain, whose wedding with King Cole will begin at midnight. She hires two bodyguards because she is "not used to be among the people". Sir Peter, who is one of the bodyguards, finds out about Lady Vain's plan of getting rid of Snow White forever and runs to the woods to find her. He finds her reducing Pinocchio's nose and rebuilding Humpty Dumpty. At first, Snow White does not want to go, but she soon agrees.  They make it just in time, thanks to the help of Mambo and Munk, and enters the wedding. Without being noticed, Snow White goes in front of the altar and tells her father that if he wants to marry Lady Vain it is his choice and not hers. Lady Vain, who is disgusted and doesn't want Snow White back, says that Snow White is still the horrible misguided teenager and has not changed at all. The citizens, who Snow White helped, appear to save Snow White. Snow White even apologizes in front of everybody. Her father responses, "I just want my daughter back," as the crowd awes. Angry that everybody accepts Snow White’s apology and ruining the wedding, Lady Vain uses the Magic Mirror to zap Snow White. But the attack is reflected back to the mirror, breaking the spell of Lady Vain's beauty, making her ugly again. Before the guards could take Lady Vain away, Snow White goes to her and tells her, "You don't need the magic mirror to be beautiful." The Seven Dwarves come to take her away instead. Snow White finally accepts the royal robe.  The film ends with Snow White, Peter, King Cole, and the townspeople dancing.

Hannah Free
 Set mostly in a nursing home, 70-something Hannah is kept separate from her lifelong friend and lover Rachel, who is not expected to emerge from her coma.  The nurses follow the orders of Rachel's daughter Marge, who claims her mother would be upset by a visit from Hannah.  While Hannah's heart is breaking at the thought of not being able to say goodbye, her mind is full of memories of their life together, and she is frequently visited by a younger, spirit Rachel.  Hannah sees, hears, and experiences her, but to anyone else, Hannah appears to be talking to herself.  Frustrated by feeling like a prisoner, Hannah grumbles, pleads to see Rachel, and writes in her journal.  The backstory gradually emerges.  Hannah transitioned easily from tomboy to openly gay while Rachel gave in to societal expectations, married, raised twins, and kept one foot in the closet most of her life, even though everyone knew about her and Hannah.  Having Hannah around was like flying a rainbow flag.  Hannah was born to wander.  Rachel never left Michigan, but Hannah spent time in Alaska, South America, and during WWII, stationed in New Mexico as a WAC.  She had affairs with other women in her travels and they remained good friends, but Rachel always was her true love. There are many flashbacks that show Hannah and Rachel in many aspects of their relationship: being in love, making love, and arguing.  In the nursing home, Hannah deals with the annoying but well-meaning staff members, a bewildered resident, a nasty evangelist, and an equally nasty Marge.  The arrival of 21-year-old Greta serves as a catalyst to get Hannah out of bed and into Rachel's room.  Greta poses as a random student doing an interview for class, but turns out to be Rachel's biological great-granddaughter, whom Hannah had only met as a young child.  Greta has a complicated relationship with her grandmother, Marge, who has never truly accepted Hannah as any sort of important mother figure.  Greta, a young lesbian, is fully committed to the rights of Hannah and Rachel, and schemes to bring the family together.  In an emotional final scene, Rachel lays comatose, while Hannah, Marge and Greta hash out their differences.  Together, they say goodbye to Rachel, and lovingly set her free.

Harry Brown (film)
 Harry Brown is an elderly [[pensioner]] who was once a decorated [[Royal Marine]], and a veteran of [[The Troubles|Northern Ireland]]. He lives on a London [[council estate]] ruled by violent [[gang]]s and spends most of his time playing chess with his friend, Len Attwell, at a local pub owned by Sid Rourke. When the hospital phones to tell him that his wife, Kath, is dying, Harry is too late because he is scared to take a shortcut through a narrow underpass, where a gang holds court. His wife is laid to rest next to the grave of their thirteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died in 1973.  Len confides to Harry that he is being terrorized by youths and shows him an old [[bayonet]] he now carries to defend himself; with the police unable to help, he plans to confront his harassers himself. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock, who tell him that Len has been murdered. The police arrest Noel Winters, the leader of a drug-dealing gang, along with members Carl, Dean and Marky, but they are released due to lack of evidence. Harry gets drunk after Len's funeral, and is then held at knife-point by Dean, who intends to rob him; Harry kills Dean with his own knife during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry in the morning to inform him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges could be reduced to [[manslaughter]] on the basis of [[self-defense]], which infuriates Harry.  Harry follows a drug dealer, Kenny, to a den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch, growing [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and sexually abusing an [[Drug overdose|overdosing]] girl to make [[pornography|pornographic films]]. Harry kills the dealers before burning down their den, fleeing with the girl and a bag of firearms. He leaves the girl outside a hospital, and then follows Marky, killing a drug dealer who is sexually abusing him. He then tortures Marky into revealing some mobile phone camera footage of Len's murder, proving the gang did not kill Len in self-defense. Harry uses Marky to bait Noel and Carl into a gunfight in the underpass; Carl and Marky are killed, and Noel flees with Harry in pursuit, only for Harry to collapse from an [[emphysema]] attack. Harry is found and taken to hospital.  Frampton has deduced that Harry is behind all the recent shootings, but her boss—Superintendent Childs—is instead convinced that they are all part of an escalating gang war. Childs orders a major police operation on the estate, which results in a riot. Harry discharges himself from the hospital to pursue Noel. Driving onto the estate to stop him, Frampton and Hicock are involved in a car crash in which Hicock is severely injured. Harry rescues them and takes them to Sid's pub, where Frampton warns Harry that Sid is actually Noel's uncle. Harry discovers that Sid has been hiding Noel, but his guard drops due to his emphysema, allowing Sid to disarm him and reveal himself to be the gang's real leader. Frampton tries to call for backup but is stopped by Noel, who begins to strangle her after Sid suffocates Hicock to death. Though weakened, Harry draws a concealed revolver and kills Noel; Sid prepares to kill Harry in retaliation only to be shot dead by police snipers, who have responded to Frampton's call.  At a press conference after the riot, Superintendent Childs announces that Frampton and Hicock are to be given awards (the latter posthumously), but stresses there is no evidence a vigilante was involved in the case. The film ends with Harry—seemingly recovered—walking towards the underpass, which is now quiet and gang-free.

He's Just Not That into You (film)
 Nine people in [[Baltimore]] deal with their respective romantic problems, usually thwarted by the differing ideals and desires of their chosen partner. At the center of this is Gigi Phillips ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]), a young woman who repeatedly misinterprets the behavior of her romantic partners.  ===Gigi and Alex=== Gigi ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) is a single woman who repeatedly [[Friend zone|misreads mundane actions and comments from her dates]] as indications that they are romantically interested in her, and frets when the guy does not call her.  In attempting to meet Conor Barry ([[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]]), a real estate agent, at a bar, she befriends the bar owner Alex ([[Justin Long]]), who reveals the strategies men use to avoid a woman. He explains that if a man is interested in a woman, he will overcome any obstacles to ensure they date again, that the "rule" is that unanswered phone calls and similar behaviors mean that he is not interested, with few exceptions, and that Gigi has been misinterpreting and obsessing over imagined "signs" that she receives. Their friendship continues, and Gigi interprets his eagerness to always assist (such as taking Gigi's call while he is on a date) as a sign that he is interested in her. She makes a move, but Alex claims he is not romantically interested in her and chastises her for ignoring his advice. She angrily replies that at least she has not let herself become cynical and bitter like him.  Gigi eventually moves on from Alex. However, in a role reversal, Alex begins falling for Gigi. After leaving several unanswered messages, Alex arrives at Gigi's apartment to declare his love. Gigi thinks that she is the rule, but after Alex suddenly kisses her passionately, he says that she is his exception.  ===Janine, Ben, and Anna=== Gigi's friend and co-worker, Janine Gunders ([[Jennifer Connelly]]), is having difficulties in her marriage to Ben ([[Bradley Cooper]]). As Janine obsesses on their home renovations, Ben becomes attracted to Anna Marks ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), a [[yoga]] instructor and aspiring singer, and she requites his affection for her. Ben and Anna pursue a [[Flirting|flirtatious]] friendship under the pretense of him helping her establish a singing career. Ben reveals to Anna that Janine once gave him an ultimatum by threatening to leave him if he did not propose. Ben agrees to be friends with Anna, and in order to flirt with him she strips and jumps naked into a swimming pool. She invites him to join, but he decides against it.  Fervently [[Tobacco control movement|anti-smoking]] (due to her father's death from [[Lung cancer#smoking|lung cancer]]), Janine pointedly asks Ben if he has been smoking and later is perturbed to find cigarette butts hidden in their back yard. Ben insists that they are not his, and their contractor, Javier ([[Luis Guzman]]), says none of his workers smoke at the house. During a tense shopping trip, Ben reveals to Janine that he has cheated on her. Janine is devastated but rationalizes Ben's behavior, blaming herself for being too cold and domineering in the relationship, and decides she wants to save their marriage.  After a positive discussion about her singing career, Anna begins to have sex with Ben in his office. They are interrupted by Janine who, hoping to spice up their marriage, has arrived unexpectedly. Anna hides in a closet, and Ben attempts to send Janine away who then makes a heartfelt plea to save their marriage, and there are indications she succeeds in seducing him. After Janine leaves, Anna angrily departs, vowing to cut ties with Ben. As Janine tidies up Ben's clothes back at their completed house, she discovers a fresh pack of cigarettes in a pocket, and she explodes in anger. When Ben returns home, he finds his clothes neatly folded with a carton of cigarettes and a note attached from Janine asking for a divorce. Janine moves into a new apartment by herself to start a new life, and Anna is later seen performing at an upscale [[nightclub]]. Ben is alone, purchasing the same beer at the same supermarket where he met Anna.  ===Conor, Anna, and Mary=== Meanwhile, Anna enjoys a close friendship with Alex's friend, Conor. He is romantically interested in her, but Anna is only interested in a casual relationship. Conor misinterprets her hugs and cute nicknames for potential romantic interest.  Anna's friend, Mary Harris ([[Drew Barrymore]]), works in advertising for a local newspaper, and helps Conor promote his real estate business in a series of print ads. Like Gigi, she meets many men (mostly online), but despite constantly monitoring [[email]]s, [[pager]], phone, and [[Myspace]] messages, her dates go nowhere.  While Conor attempts to cultivate a [[gay]] clientele, two gay men tell him how he is going wrong with Anna. Taking their advice, Conor decides to declare his love to Anna. Vulnerable after falling out with Ben, Anna agrees to start a serious relationship with him. But when Conor proposes buying a house and moving in together sometime later, Anna admits she doesn't want to, and they break up, becoming just friends.  Mary later runs into Conor, recognizing him from his ad photo, and introduces herself, since they have only spoken over the phone. They hit it off, and start [[dating]].  ===Beth and Neil=== Gigi's other co-worker, Beth Murphy ([[Jennifer Aniston]]), is living with her boyfriend, Neil ([[Ben Affleck]]), who is also friends with Ben. After seven years of dating, Beth wants to get married, but Neil does not believe in marriage. With Gigi's newfound pragmatic stance on relationships after advice from Alex, she announces she will no longer misinterpret vague gestures from men as more than they really are. This spurs Beth to confront Neil about their relationship. When he still doesn't want to get married, she breaks up with him.  Later, the preparations for her younger sister's wedding brings the issue into sharper focus for Beth after hearing many back-handed comments from various family members. During the reception, her father Rod ([[Kris Kristofferson]]) suffers a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Beth looks after him as he recuperates while her sisters wallow, and their husbands remain glued to the television playing video games and watching football with constant takeout as the household falls into chaos. As Beth reaches the end of her patience looking after her siblings and in-laws as well as her recovering father, Neil arrives with groceries and helps with the chores. The two reconcile, with Beth saying that Neil is more of a husband to her than her sisters' spouses are to them, and she will not insist they be married. Neil later proposes to her, and they marry in an intimate ceremony aboard his sailboat.  
The Haunting in Connecticut
 In 1987, Sara Campbell ([[Virginia Madsen]]) is driving her son Matthew ([[Kyle Gallner]]) home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. Sara and her husband Peter ([[Martin Donovan]]), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a “For Rent” sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately.  The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy ([[Ty Wood]]) and cousins Wendy ([[Amanda Crew]]) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a [[funeral home]]; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary.  Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu ([[Elias Koteas]]), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall.  The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt's illness and bizarre behavior. The children find a box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt's visions, at a [[séance]], emitting [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]. Wendy and Matt find out that the funeral home was run by a man named Ramsey Aickman. Aickman also conducted psychic research and would host séances with Jonah as the [[Mediumship|medium]]. At one séance, all those attending, including Aickman, were found dead and Jonah disappeared.  Nicholas theorizes that Aickman was practicing [[necromancy]] in an attempt to control the dead and bind them to the house. That night, Nicholas finds human remains in the house and removes them. Matt awakens to find Aickman’s symbols carved into his flesh. He is taken to the hospital, where he encounters Jonah. Nicholas and Matt begin to have simultaneous visions. Everyone in the séance is burnt, after a flash of bright light. The barely alive Aickman told Jonah to get out of the house, concerned that the demonic presence will get him next. Jonah uses a dumbwaiter to escape, calling for help. Entering an unknown chamber, Jonah realizes that he has entered the [[crematory]]. The spirit traps Jonah in the crematory, and [[cremation|cremates]] him alive.  Peter and Sara learn that Matt's cancer treatments have had no effect. They then discover that Matt has escaped the hospital. Back at the house, Nicholas leaves a message telling the family to get out of the house immediately – Jonah's spirit was actually protecting them from the spirits. Matt breaks through the walls in the front room with an axe, revealing the dusty corpses Aickman hid in the walls. He forces Wendy and the children to get out, barricading himself inside and tearing down the other walls, as corpses begin to tumble into the room. The view switches from Matt to Jonah, who seems to be occupying Matt's body. Matt lights the bodies and the room on fire. Later on investigators arrive to the house to only find it engulfed in flames.    As the fire department arrives, Sara and Peter frantically try to get in to save Matt. The spirits, finally freed, disappear. Outside, everyone watches tearfully as the emergency crew attempts to resuscitate a dying Matt. As Matt slips away, he has a vision of himself standing in the graveyard where he sees Jonah, no longer appearing burnt. He seems about to follow Jonah when he hears his mother’s voice.  He returns to his body and Jonah's spirit leaves him. Matt's cancer disappears, and the house was rebuilt and resold with no further reported incidents of haunting.  
Harvest Home (2009 film)
 Emotionally uprooted after the recent death of her husband, Esther Kern (Diane Hruska) is trying to return to normal life after completing her [[Shiva (Judaism)|''shiva'']]—a weeklong period of family mourning mandated in the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]].<ref>Wilson, Ken.

Heartless (2009 film)
 Jamie Morgan ([[Jim Sturgess]]) is a lonely, troubled photographer with a large heart-shaped birthmark that covers nearly half of his face. He is still a virgin at 25 because a lifetime of alienation and bullying have left him unable to make friends or attract women. At the photographic studio he shares with his brother and nephew Lee, he meets aspiring model Tia ([[Clémence Poésy]]).  As Jamie develops photos from a shoot, he notices a disturbing face looking at him from the window of a house. When he goes back to investigate, he follows a suspicious man to a group of hooded vandals around a fire, who emit eerie shrieks. One notices Jamie and shrieks at him. Jamie is shocked to see a demonic lizard-like face under the hood, with huge pin-like teeth. Over time Jamie becomes aware of a series of horrific murders by Molotov cocktail that have been occurring in the neighbourhood. A witness to one of the murders, a little Asian girl, tells a TV reporter that they weren’t wearing masks; the demonic faces were real. Jamie's neighbour and new-found friend, A.J. ([[Noel Clarke]]) turns up with a huge wound that looks as if it was caused by claw marks. Parts of his dismembered body then turn up in the local area.  Jamie and his mother are walking in the neighborhood when they are attacked by the demonic gang. His mother is immolated while Jamie watches helplessly, and he is savagely beaten and left for dead. While unconscious in hospital he glimpses a man in his dream who says he's waiting for Jamie. Later, he receives a phone call from a man with the same voice, and is guided to the apartment of Papa B ([[Joseph Mawle]]) and his assistant Belle ([[Nikita Mistry]]), who looks just like the little Asian girl from the TV report. Papa B offers a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]]: Jamie must fulfil Papa B's desire for chaos with occasional acts of [[Graffiti|vandalism]] in return for the removal of his birthmarks. Despite Papa B admitting that he was responsible for his mother's death as a way of bringing Jamie to him, Jamie consents and they shake hands. Jamie is told to immolate himself with a Molotov cocktail in order to be reborn. Jamie miraculously survives and peels away his burned skin to reveal perfect, unblemished skin.  Initially things go well: a chance meeting with Tia leads a newly confident Jamie to spend the day with her in the park, where his beloved, deceased father first taught him to use a camera. The deal sours, however, when the Weapons Man ([[Eddie Marsan]]) arrives: Papa B has reneged on their bargain and Jamie must now commit murder by ripping the heart from a living victim. The Weapons Man tortures Jamie until he agrees to kill a street hustler. His hope for a better life returns after he and Tia become lovers. During this time Belle also comes to live with Jamie, after Papa B beat her in a fit of rage. She starts calling Jamie "Dad" and becomes a bit of a guide to him, kindly and pragmatically explaining that he has no choice but to kill, to save his own life—and Belle's. But Papa B is outraged at Belle's betrayal and as punishment demands that Jamie kill a new victim—Tia.  Tia asks Jamie to put a photo album in his work safe, and it is revealed that Tia and Lee ([[Luke Treadaway]]) intended to steal his late mother's jewellery. Tia had initially meant only to help Lee gain access to the safe, but she ended up sincerely falling  in love with Jamie. During the ensuing struggle Tia is accidentally shot and killed, and Lee is seriously wounded by "She", a gang leader to whom he owed money, and who wears a metallic claw in place of a severed hand.  Jamie is pursued by She but fights back and kills him. He notices that a mark on a wall from She's claw looks just like the wound received by A.J. Jamie tells Belle, who has turned up from nowhere, that she must flee to stay safe, and she disappears. Jamie spies himself in a mirror and sees that his birthmark has returned, and with it the knowledge that it had been there the entire time, even while he was courting Tia. Jamie confronts Papa B's minions and fights them off, but when faced with a larger demon, Papa B in his true form, runs away. Viewers are left to decide for themselves whether Papa B cheated Jamie by never removing the birthmark, or if much of what transpired was the product of Jamie's imagination.  After waking up indoors, Jamie staggers outside. On the ground he sees several masks with sharp teeth, and looks up to see several masked and hooded gang members. But these are ordinary masks made of sacks, not the realistic demon faces Jamie has seen so far. Are these the "demons" he had been fighting a short while ago? Jamie now recalls himself walking and talking with Belle—only now he appears to converse with empty space. As realisation sinks in, a gang member catches him with a [[Molotov cocktail]]. As he stands still and burns to death, Jamie experiences a vision of his father, who tells him that you can only see the stars in the blackness of the night. Whether this is a memory or a near-death experience is left unclear. Jamie ascends into bright light. The light fades into a field of stars in the night sky, mirroring the words spoken by his father.

[[Asmara]] is under Ethiopian occupation, and Awet's father takes to the woods with the Eritrean freedom fighters. Left alone and needy, Awet's mother attempts to kill her, locking it away in a suitcase. Awet survives and is taken to a Catholic orphanage ran by Italian and Eritrean nuns. It is during her time in the orphanage that Awet begins to first perceive the injustice all around her, and gradually learns to stand up for her beliefs. Six years later, her father - whom she believed lost - takes her away to live with his new family. But Awet is not welcome; her father torments her and finally gives her and her elder stepsister to the “Morning Stars” - a children's unit within one of Eritrea's liberation armies, the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]], also known as Jebha.  It's here that Awet finds a new family and a mother substitute in the commander Ma'aza: a beautiful and charismatic young woman who has made her way to one of the leading positions, typically occupied by men. Awet falls for her, and tries anything to catch her attention and win her  favour. She endures paramilitary training and the harshness of guerrilla life in the dry Eritrean desert, waiting for the moment she’ll fight at the commander’s side. But then Awet encounters the first dead bodies: enemies and comrades lying side by side. In her eyes, the dead friends and foes all look shockingly alike - children like her. So when Ma'aza gives her the long-desired Kalashnikov, Awet shirks the drill and pretends to shoot, but with an empty magazine; she even buries her gun. She gets punished, mocked as a coward and isolated. But her refusal to kill and her naïve questioning set a troublesome precedent - a challenge to Ma'aza’s authority.  Meanwhile losses to the enemy - the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] or Shabia - increase and the enemy tightens the circle. A few of Awet’s comrades are caught while fleeing and are killed at Ma'aza’s command. In a final clash with the enemy, the commander calls her fighters to the last sacrifice. But Awet takes control of her destiny this time. She confronts Ma'aza and finally leaves her former idol to her fate. While the troops are breaking apart, Awet is able to save herself and her stepsister - hiding in an abandoned suitcase.

Hero of the Rails
 One summer on the [[Island of Sodor]], [[Railway engines (Thomas & Friends)#Spencer|Spencer]] (voiced by [[UK]]: [[Matt Wilkinson]]/[[US]]: [[Glenn Wrage]]) arrives to help the Duke (voiced by UK: Matt Wilkinson/US: [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]]) and Duchess (voiced by UK: [[Teresa Gallagher]]/US: [[Jules de Jongh]]) with the construction of their new summer house. After being an absolute nuisance to all of the other engines by teasing and bossing them around, [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]] (voiced by UK: [[Ben Small]]/US: [[Martin Sherman (actor)|Martin Sherman]]) accepts Spencer's challenge to a contest of strength, taking heavy cargo around the island. Thomas's brakes fail after climbing a tall hill, and he runs out of control through an overgrown, abandoned line. There, Thomas finds an old abandoned [[Japan]]ese engine named [[Railway engines (Thomas & Friends)#Hiro|Hiro]] (voiced by [[Togo Igawa]]). Hiro doesn't want [[the Fat Controller]] (voiced by UK: [[Keith Wickham]]/US: Kerry Shale) to find out, fearing he will be scrapped, so Thomas promises to keep him his secret and work to make Hiro "Master of the Railway" once again. Later, he's taken to the Sodor Steamworks for repairs, where he finds old parts for Hiro. He takes them with permission from Victor (voiced by UK: Matt Wilkinson/US: [[David Bedella]]), the Steamworks engine, only to discover that Hiro's hiding place is dangerously close to the Duke and Duchess's new summer house.  The following day, Thomas tells Percy (voiced by UK: Keith Wickham/US: Martin Sherman) about Hiro, and asks him to do his own job while he helps Hiro. Percy misplaces his own mail trucks and breaks down while doing Thomas's job, so Thomas brings him to the Steamworks. The Fat Controller finds out about this and scolds Thomas by forcing him to do Percy's work. With nobody else to ask for help, Thomas tells the rest of his friends about Hiro. They all work together in bringing Hiro new parts, distracting Spencer, and keeping the operation a secret from the Fat Controller while Thomas and Percy try to find the missing mail trucks. Hiro makes friends with all of the engines, but gradually grows homesick. On the day that the last necessary part for Hiro is to be delivered, Spencer discovers Percy's mail trucks, only to be cornered by Thomas, James (voiced by UK: Keith Wickham/US: Kerry Shale) and Toby (voiced by UK: Ben Small/US: William Hope). The Fat Controller accuses Spencer of stealing the trucks and demands he return them to Percy.  While Thomas and Hiro wait for Percy with the last part, they hear Spencer's whistle and run. Spencer finds them and gives chase, but without the last part, Hiro falls apart and is forced to a stop. Spencer is suddenly distracted by Gordon (voiced by UK: Keith Wickham/US: Kerry Shale) while Thomas moves Hiro to a new hiding place. The Duke and Duchess are furious with Spencer for abandoning his own work, and Thomas asks to assist him, in order to keep his eye on Spencer and to gain the trust of the Fat Controller. Meanwhile, the other engines visit Hiro to keep his spirits up. When Thomas finally decides to tell the Fat Controller about Hiro, Spencer tries to stop him, but he is foiled by a rickety bridge which collapses beneath him.  When Thomas explains Hiro's situation to the Fat Controller, he reassures Thomas that he would never have scrapped the "Master of the Railway", and the following day, Thomas and Percy bring him to the Steamworks. There, Victor and his assistant, Kevin the Crane (voiced by UK: Matt Wilkinson/US: Kerry Shale), work together to restore Hiro. Once he's as good as new, Hiro with Rocky (voiced by UK: Matt Wilkinson/US: Glenn Wrage) rescues Spencer, and they work with Thomas on the summerhouse. Spencer apologizes to the two engines, saying they are "both fine engines and fine friends." Hiro misses his home island, so the Fat Controller arranges for Hiro to return home. A farewell party is held at the docks, and Thomas promises Hiro that Sodor will always be his home too.

High Lane (film)
 Young adults Fred ([[Nicolas Giraud]]), his girlfriend Karine and their friends Chloé ([[Fanny Valette]]), a nurse grappling with guilt after accidentally killing a young patient; Guillaume ([[Raphaël Lenglet]]), who harbors feelings for Chloé; and Loïc ([[Johan Libéreau]]), Chloé's unpopular boyfriend, travel to [[Croatia]] to climb and hike. They find the starting point closed off with rocks but experienced climber Fred convinces the others, including Chloé's boyfriend Loïc, to cross the track. The inexperienced Loïc is consistently paralyzed with fear, often needing encouragement from Chloé to continue. As their journey progresses, they realize that the trail is more dangerous than they had first thought: an unstable rope bridge collapses after their crossing, nearly killing Karine. With the  bridge gone, the group realizes that they can't turn back, and Fred, feeling guilty after persuading the group to hike a closed-off trail, tells them that they need to go to the end as quickly as possible.  Fred climbs ahead with Karine as the rest of the group hangs off of a cliff, but is wounded in a bear trap. As Karine tries to pry the trap off of his leg, the rest of the group struggles as a vertigo-stricken Loïc fails to belay the rope; Loïc ignores advice from Guillaume, jealous and hostile because of the latter's obvious feelings for Chloé. Loïc's support fails and he falls, bringing the attached Guillaume down with him, and the two are suspended as Chloé looks on in horror. Meanwhile, Fred tells Karine to leave him and retrieve the others. Soon after Karine leaves, Fred hears movement in the trees around him as the chain to the trap tightens, and he is suddenly dragged off.   Karine uses a rope to bring help the rest of the group to the top, but when they return, Fred is missing, but Loïc finds blood on the surrounding foliage, and the empty, bloodstained bear trap is found discarded. Karine, though confused as to how he managed to get out of the trap when they couldn't open it before, panics and believes that Fred must have wandered off and gotten lost. Chloé assures Karine that they will look for Fred despite the fact that it's becoming dark and Fred's bag had the flares inside. As they search, Loïc and Guillaume bicker over Chloé and begin to grapple. Chloé, going over to break them up, falls into a pit trap. Karine rappels down and finds a poacher's trap full of spikes; one went through Chloé's arm and she is injured. As they watch Karine rescue Chloé, Guillaume feels they're being watched and tells Loïc, who ignores him. When Karine finally rescues Chloé, Chloé realizes that the trap is a poacher's trap; they wonder what could be the prey.  Rain pours as the group ropes themselves together and searches for Fred. Karine, at the end of the rope, is hit by an arrow through the chest; when she pulls her rope, she finds that it has been cut. A shocked Chloé notices and tries to rush towards her, but Karine is suddenly pulled and dragged away. Chloé, distraught, tries to find her, and Loïc insists that they should abandon Fred and Karine to escape. As they continue on they find a cabin in the forest and enter; inside, a naked and bloodied Fred is lying on a slab, and though Chloé tries to save him, he dies shortly after from shock and his wounds; Loïc covers his body with a sheet.  Guillaume finds a door to the basement and goes down to find Fred's bag; there he also finds animal pelts, shackles, hunting equipment, and hanging decapitated heads. On the wall is the name "Anton." Guillaume realizes that the poacher, named Anton, must live alone in the cage, but when he tries to tell Loïc, the latter refuses to listen. Loïc pushed Guillaume down the stairs to the basement, accidentally knocking him unconscious. Loïc locks him in the basement and tries to tell Chloé to leave with him (with the lie that Guillaume was trying to abandon the both of them), but Chloé, disturbed at his behavior, refuses. Anton suddenly returns with Karine's corpse, and Chloé is briefly knocked unconscious as Loïc ineffectually grapples with Anton. Chloé regains consciousness and helps Loïc fight Anton, but when she manages to get an advantage over Anton and looks to her boyfriend to help, the cowardly Loïc flees with a flare, leaving her to die. Chloé is quickly overpowered by Anton.  Chloé and Guillaume, shackled to the wall in the basement, hear Anton eviscerate the corpses of Fred and Karine. Though Chloé is close to escaping from the shackles, Anton returns and takes her upstairs to kill her. Meanwhile, Loïc's flare dies and he reluctantly returns to the cabin. Guillaume, fighting to save Chloé, escapes his bonds and yells through the basement trapdoor for Chloé to call the poacher Anton. The poacher pauses, and Loïc appears to attack Anton. An enraged Anton chases a fleeing Loïc, giving Chloé enough time to escape and free Guillaume. Guillaume wants to escape to the nearby cable, but Chloé insists on saving Loïc.  Anton chases Loïc with a crossbow and shoots Loïc in the leg, but Loïc fights Anton, stabbing him and hitting him with a rock several times, though he flees to the cable before killing him. However, he misjudges the distance and ends up on the wrong cliff, and in escaping Anton climbs down an unstable cliffside ladder. Loïc calls for help, and Chloé and Guillaume arrive. Guillaume initially tries to pull him up, but is overcome by hatred and anger from Loïc trapping him in Anton's house, and lets him fall to his death off the cliffside. Guillaume tells Chloé that he had slipped and the two embrace; however, it's cut short when Anton shoots a crossbow arrow through Guillaume's head, killing him.  Chloé charges at Anton with a knife and attacks him. The two fight, but Anton gains the upper hand and begins to beat her. Chloé says his name, making him pause once more, and she cuts his neck with the knife. Though she has an opening to kill him, a flashback to her dead patient makes her realize that she cannot do it. Leaving him to die, Chloé escapes to the cable and in tearful joy begins the descent to safety. However, she leaves her knife behind, and Anton takes it up and goes to the cable in a fit of rage. The last shot is of Chloé traveling down the cable, and a loud snap is heard before the film cuts to black, implying that Anton managed to cut the cable. The film ends with the note that only Loïc's body was found; Fred, Karine, Guillaume and Chloé remain missing, and a boy named Anton, kidnapped at the age of five, also remains missing: countless people go missing in the Balkans every year.

Hit and Run (2009 film)
 The film opens as Mary Murdock ([[Laura Breckenridge]]), a young student, leaves a lively party at a club in New Jersey one night. She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After that, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd.  The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent.  Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser ([[Kevin Corrigan]]), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave.  It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary in many ways. The parrots squawk strange phrases, which alert Mary. At one point, she falls down the stairs, impaling a screw driver in her thigh. Emser surprise attacks, biting and stabbing her, and she passes out. In a reversal, when Mary revives, Emser has strapped her to the bumper with electric cords and Christmas lights and takes her on a sadistic, all-night "revenge drive".  Along the way, after a struggle, Emser kills a gas attendant (who was about to call the cops) by pumping petrol down his throat and the attendant throws up blood after Emser departs. Emser parks back at his own house, leaving Mary trapped in his garage, as she did to him. He reunites with his worried family, but is ever more delusional, violent. Soon, Emser stabs his wife Jane in the back with hedge clippers when she accidentally stumbles on and tries to untie Mary.  It transpires that Emser goes to bury Mary in the woods with Rick's body, after detaching her and the bumper using a blowtorch and welding mask. However, in the grave, Mary is able to maim his eye with a plug from the cords and escapes in the jeep. When Emser blocks her path, Mary revs up and intentionally runs her tormentor over several times. She speeds off in the dark.  Next morning, Mary wakes on the roadside, numb and battered, and drives to a local auto shop. There, the mechanic and passersby ultimately discover, and pull out, Emser's body from under the jeep, where it got snagged. Seeing this, Mary has a mental breakdown, saying "I don't think I need that bumper anymore", laughing as the police sirens close in on her. The film ends moving closer to Emser's bloodied face on the pavement in the early rain, and it appears to be left uncertain whether he is actually dead or not.  Throughout the narrative, a radio DJ called Eddie the Spaz is periodically heard. He is hosting a weekend music marathon called the "Spazathon", which bookends the film.  
The Hills Run Red (2009 film)
 Tyler is obsessed with the horror film ''The Hills Run Red'', considered the scariest movie ever made, with the deranged serial killer Babyface in the [[lead role]]. However, the film's director, Wilson Wyler Concannon, disappeared years ago and there is no known copy of the film. Tyler's obsession with the film leads him to neglect his girlfriend Serena. When Tyler discovers that Concannon's daughter Alexa works in a [[night club]] as a stripper, he decides to meet her and ask about the lost film. He visits Alexa and asks her about the project.  As she gives him a nude lap dance, the audience sees Serena cheating on Tyler with their best friend Lalo. Alexa informs Tyler that the movie might be in her father's home in the woods.  Tyler drives out to Concannon's home, accompanied by Serena, Lalo, and Alexa. On the way, they are bound and attacked by rednecks, who threaten to rape Alexa and Serena. Babyface appears and kills the assaulters before chasing the teens into the woods, and then disappears.  Tyler breaks into the house and finds a red room that contains many film reels hanging from the ceiling. When Tyler hears pain-filled screams, he finds Alexa tied to a bed and releases her. The two leave the house and find Serena, but Babyface breaks through the door, brutally throws Tyler into a wall and injures Serena. Alexa is slammed against the wall by Babyface and says "fetch," telling him to run after Serena. Tyler drops unconscious as Alexa approaches him, smiling. Serena hides under the car parked in front of the house. Babyface enters a barn as Serena quietly moves to an adjacent building. Serena is shocked to find bloodied bodies in the room, which turns out to be a smoke house. When Babyface goes inside the smoke house, he doesn't find her and leaves. Serena emerges from a drum that was used to store blood and changes clothes. However, when she leaves the smoke house, Babyface jumps down at her from the roof.  Tyler wakes and finds himself tied to a wheelchair. On the shelves behind him are many film reels, all titled ''The Hills Run Red''. Tyler is shocked when Concannon, the missing director of the film, appears. Concannon tells him the secret behind the scares in his film, and plays a video of twenty years before, when the film was in shooting. Concannon is dissatisfied with the actor portraying Babyface, and angrily explains to him how to properly make a scene feel scary. He takes Babyface's costume and axe, and violently axes the actor to death. It is then that the reason why screenings were canceled and all actors vanished is revealed: the film was considered too violent, and all the death scenes in it were real. He also tells Tyler that Alexa was only thirteen years old when she "had him", indicating Babyface is a child born of [[incest]] between father and daughter.   Babyface is called away by Wilson and returns to the barn, leaving Serena alone. She breaks free from her binds and successfully escapes the room. Alexa stabs Lalo in the chest, killing him. Concannon tells his daughter he's the only director of the family and shoots her. Babyface, angered by Alexa's apparent death, turns on Concannon and fights him. Concannon screams out that he is Babyface's father. Tyler takes a camera and encourages Babyface to kill Concannon – which he does. Babyface then turns on Tyler but before he can kill him, Serena stabs Babyface through the back with a long iron staff, apparently killing him. However, Serena is hit by a shovel, and Alexa, still alive, hits Tyler as well, knocking him unconscious. Alexa then ties Tyler up and forces him to watch her cut of ''The Hills Run Red'', driving him insane.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Serena, still Alexa's prisoner, is several months pregnant. Alexa sings a lullaby to Serena's unborn baby, and the end credits continue to roll as Serena screams.  
The Hole (2009 film)
  17-year-old Dane Thompson, his 10-year-old brother Lucas, and their mother, Susan, move from Brooklyn to the quiet town of [[Bensenville, Illinois|Bensenville]] where Dane and Lucas befriend their next door neighbor, Julie. While exploring their new home, Dane and Lucas discover a trapdoor with several locks along each side in the basement. Opening the trapdoor reveals a hole which appears to be bottomless.  Over the next few days, each child experiences strange events. Lucas, having a fear of clowns, discovers a [[jester]] puppet on his bed, as well as other locations, as if it is following him. Julie begins to see an injured girl who bleeds from her eyes. Dane starts to see shadowy figures of a large man. Eventually, all three witness the injured girl together at the boys' home where they follow her to the basement and watch as she crawls into the hole.  Julie suggests they seek help from the previous owner of the house, Creepy Carl, who now lives in an abandoned glove factory surrounded by hundreds of lights and lamps. When the kids tell him that they have opened the hole, he berates them for releasing the evil inside stating that it will come for them and kill Dane. Later that night, Carl is seen scribbling in a sketchbook, almost blacking out entire pages. Carl screams, "I'm not done yet!" as the light bulbs around him pop.  The sketchbook turns out to belong to Dane, who returns to the factory to retrieve it. He finds his sketchbook in the darkness; Creepy Carl is gone. Julie decides to get the group relaxed and throws a pool party. While under the water, Dane sees a shadowy figure of a giant man standing above. Once out of the pool, he notices a trail of muddy footprints which he and Julie follow, leaving Lucas alone in the pool. They hear Julie's pet dog, Charlie, barking and return to see Lucas drowning. Lucas tells them that the jester puppet had pulled him under.  Later that night, while Lucas is asleep, Dane sees a hand-shaped bruise on Lucas's leg. He discovers that it is identical to a hand that Creepy Carl had drawn in the sketchbook. As he flips through the sketchbook, he realizes that each page is a puzzle piece. While working on the puzzle, Dane hears someone whistling. When he walks into the kitchen, he sees an envelope addressed to him from the New Jersey State Penitentiary. A note inside reads 'HELLO BOY'. He rushes upstairs to Lucas and tells him that someone is in the house. While Dane investigates, Lucas meets a police officer standing at the bottom of the stairs. The officer shows Lucas a picture of two little girls and asks if he has seen one of them and points to the girl whom Julie first encountered. The police officer leaves the picture with Lucas and turns to leave revealing the back of his head is missing. Lucas fetches Dane and the pair watch the cop return to the basement and climb into the hole.  Next door, the girl then appears in Julie's room. Julie climbs out of her window and meets the boys where she reveals to Dane that she and her best friend Annie were playing on the tracks of an old roller coaster which resulted in an accident where Annie fell to her death. In an attempt to help Julie, a police officer had also fallen and was killed. She decides to return to the amusement park where the accident occurred stating "I know what I need to do now." Dane goes after her telling Lucas to stay at home.  Julie finds her friend sitting on the same spot from which she fell. After Julie helps Annie understand that she had tried to save her, Annie disappears and is pleased that Julie is no longer scared. Meanwhile, Lucas hears Dane calling him to the basement. Confused, he follows the voice to discover the jester puppet mimicking Dane's voice. The puppet attacks Lucas but is outwitted and eventually destroyed. Dane and Julie return and Lucas announces that he is no longer afraid of clowns. Dane then tells them of a theory that once you look into the hole it somehow knows you and creates whatever you are afraid of. When asked what he's afraid of, Dane replies that he is not afraid of anything.  Julie then invites Dane and Lucas to stay at her place for the night. As Lucas is gathering his things, Dane shows Julie the puzzle he had been working on. They solve the puzzle together and see a boy being grabbed by a giant man. Dane rushes upstairs to find that Lucas is gone. Dane finally reveals that he is afraid of his father, who had abused the entire family and is now in prison. Realizing that his father has taken Lucas into the hole, Dane jumps into the hole as well.  Dane finds Lucas hiding in the closet of a twisted version of a home. Their father, who has become a giant, discovers them and starts to break through the door. They turn around and discover the shelving seems to be a ladder. Dane tells Lucas to start climbing. Dane starts to follow, when his father drags him back down. As Dane fights him off, the giant father slowly returns to his actual size as Dane starts to confront his fear, seeing him for what he really is. Their surroundings begin to crumble and the floor falls away leaving Dane and his father trapped on an island under a ceiling fan. Having taken his father's belt, Dane pulls himself onto the fan and gives the crumbling floor one final blow with the belt buckle causing the floor to break apart and the father to fall.  Dane emerges from the hole where Julie and Lucas are waiting. They close the hole, just as their mother comes down to the basement. She sees the trapdoor and opens it, revealing a shallow crawl space below.  As the group heads upstairs, Lucas asks his mom if she is afraid of anything. She replies that she was afraid of a monster under her bed when she was a little girl. Lucas says, "Uh oh," as the trapdoor blows open again revealing the darkness has returned.

Horsemen (film)
 Detective Aidan Breslin is a [[widower]] who has become emotionally distanced from his two sons, Alex and Sean. Due to his dental forensics expertise, Breslin is called to investigate a crime scene that includes human teeth and a painted message: "come and see". After matching the teeth to a missing man, Breslin investigates the murder of a woman, Mrs. Spitz, who was discovered hanging from a hook contraption in her bedroom; the same message appears on four walls. According to her autopsy report, she drowned in her own blood due to a precise stabbing. They also discover Mrs. Spitz had been pregnant, and the [[fetus]] was removed. Aidan speculates there were four attackers, who recorded the murder. After leaving the crime scene, Breslin comforts the Spitz's adopted daughter, Kristen.  The next murder shares the same [[Modus operandi|M.O.]]; the similar hook contraption leads Breslin to a tattoo parlor whose owner constructed four devices. Another murder occurs, this time with no hooks and a message on three walls. While Breslin reviews the evidence at his home, Sean stumbles on one of the photographs. Sean's insights point Breslin to the Bible, where he discovers the killings are patterned after the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Each room corresponds to a horseman; the "come and see" message is a quotation from the [[Book of Revelation]]. Kristen contacts Breslin unexpectedly, and, during their conversation, Kristen produces the missing fetus, confessing to the stunned Breslin. During her interrogation, Breslin discovers the darker side of Kristen's personality, one similar to the horseman War.  At Kristen's house, Breslin and his partner, Stingray, discover snuff videos and pictures of Kristen posing sexually with Mr. Spitz. Stingray and Breslin arrest Mr. Spitz, and his children are placed in protective custody. When Breslin confronts Kristen in jail, she claims to have been sexually abused for years and  murdered Mrs. Spitz as punishment for her complicity and to hurt Mr. Spitz. Evidence discovered in the unrigged victim's stomach leads Breslin to a booby-trapped apartment. A suspect escapes, and magnesium ribbons destroy most evidence.  Meanwhile, a gay young man, Cory, has a confrontation with his brother, Taylor. After Taylor insults him, Cory hands Taylor a drugged drink. As Taylor drunkenly stumbles out to his car, a thief accosts Cory in the parking lot. Cory stabs the man, who later provides the police with Cory's description. The precision of the stab wound, and a reference to Hell leads Aidan to assume it was done by the horseman Death. Elsewhere, Taylor awakens hooked onto a rig with his eyes fixed open. Cory attempts to cut out his own heart with a bonesaw, killing himself in front of Taylor.  Breslin, convinced that there may be another victim, questions Kristen, who confirms she represents War and the unrigged victim was Pestilance, who betrayed their trust. She refuses to identify their leader. Breslin realizes he was meant to be assigned to the case and becomes concerned his family will be targeted next. Breslin asks Stingray to go on ahead and check his house. At the Breslin home, Stingray is attacked and knocked out. Breslin arrives later and enters Alex's room for the first time in three years. To his horror, he realizes Alex is Conquest, their leader. A clue points him to the Metropolitan Theater, where Breslin met his wife. Alex sedates him, and, when he comes to, Breslin is handcuffed to a seat as Alex dangles over the stage on the final hook rig. As Alex bleeds to death, he describes the horsemen's emotional detachment from their families. Breslin rips his handcuffs off the seating and fires his gun to detach the rigging from the ceiling. Alex awakens as his father holds him. At the Breslin home, Sean wakes up from a nightmare as Breslin comforts him. When he asks where Alex is, Breslin reassures him that Alex will be okay.

Shelby befriends Elizabeth and after a few tequila shots, a drunk Elizabeth says she is going to meet Mike's parents after. Shelby then tells her that Mike's parents are over-judgmental, making Elizabeth nervous. Wanting to give a good first impression to Mike's parents, Elizabeth decides to go to a motel and sleep her intoxication off, so gets driven to the nearest one from Mike's policeman cousin Billy. As she arrives at check-in, the man behind the counter tells her that there are not any rooms left because of the homecoming football games and the nearest motel is four miles away. Mike goes home to see his mother, who tells him that one of her friends said his new girlfriend got drunk at the alley. Mike tells her that since Elizabeth wanted to make a good impression, she decided to stay at a motel. Mike's mother questions him why Elizabeth would think that, implying that Shelby lied to Elizabeth.  Elizabeth begins to walk up the road with her suitcase, looking for someone to drive her to the motel. While driving Shelby is now crying and smoking a cigarette as seen in the beginning scene of the film. Elizabeth tries to flag the car down and becomes the person Shelby hits. After the crash, Shelby puts her in her car and takes her home with her. At her house Shelby takes care of Elizabeth by using some medical supplies left over from when her mother was sick.  The next morning Mike tries to call Elizabeth but her phone goes to voicemail. Elizabeth then wakes up in Shelby's house. Confused, she asks Shelby what happened. Fearing that she would go to jail for hitting Elizabeth, Shelby tells her that she found her in the road as a victim of a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]. Elizabeth suffered extensive bruising and a broken ankle. Shelby tells Elizabeth that she left a message on Mike's voicemail telling him where Elizabeth was, which is a lie. Shelby then sedates Elizabeth.  Shelby then walks to her bowling alley to get Elizabeth's car. Elizabeth wakes up at Shelby's house. While Shelby is gone to get the car, she manages to get out of her bed with her injured ankle and hobble to Shelby's bedroom. She finds it covered in pictures of Mike and Shelby when they were still together with "SM + MD" written everywhere. Shelby returns and Elizabeth hobbles back to her room but accidentally detaches a photo strip of Shelby and Mike from the wall in her haste. Shelby finds the strip and realizes Elizabeth has been in her room. As a punishment she dislocates Elizabeth's bad foot. Mike and Billy go to the motel where Billy dropped her off and the receptionist tells him that Elizabeth never checked in the motel. They then go to the bowling alley where Elizabeth left her car and see that is no longer there since Shelby stole it and hid it in her barn at her house. Shelby looks through Elizabeth's suitcase and takes a gift that was intended for Mike, planning to give the gift to him as her own.  Billy later tries to convince Mike to take Shelby back, since she still loved him even after he rejected her numerous times. Mike does agree, however, to go out for drinks that night. At the bar, Mike sees Shelby there and follows her to the bathroom. Shelby and Mike begin to passionately kiss, but Mike says that he cannot cheat on Elizabeth even though she seems to have deserted him. He leaves Shelby in the bathroom where she begins to cry.  The next day, Mike, thinking Elizabeth left him for her ex-boyfriend, gets a text from Shelby on Elizabeth's phone saying too much is happening too fast. He lies on the couch looking at his phone's display of "No New Messages".  Elizabeth finds herself locked in the bathroom. After rummaging around, she discovers taped to the inside of the cistern lid Polaroid pictures of Shelby's mother dying, revealing that Shelby had killed her. There is also a paper titled "Poisonous Plants" and a form showing that no autopsy had been performed at Shelby's request. Fearing her own murder is approaching, Elizabeth scours the bathroom looking for a way out. She finds a screwdriver and uses it on the door to escape.  Shelby gets home from visiting Mike to give him his jacket and opens the bathroom door to find the room empty. She turns around to be met by the cistern lid in Elizabeth's hands. Elizabeth takes Shelby's jacket and hobbles down the stairs, out the front door into the barn, where she finds her locked car. In frustration, Elizabeth hits her car causing the alarm to sound. Shelby runs to the barn and subdues Elizabeth. Shelby calls her a "stupid bitch" and pulls the car keys from the jacket's pocket. She then ties up Elizabeth with duct tape. While she's lying on the floor, Elizabeth tells Shelby that she knows about her mother. Elizabeth tells her that her parents are rich and promises to run away and not tell anyone if Shelby will release Elizabeth and accept money from her parents. Shelby ignores her and uses pruners to cut out Elizabeth's Achilles' tendons. Shelby then gags Elizabeth and locks her in the basement.  Mike prepares for his big ceremony to retire his football jersey, wearing the jacket that Shelby gave him. Billy stops by Shelby's house to see if she wanted a ride. While Shelby is talking to Billy, Elizabeth manages to shut off the power. Billy offers to fix it, but Shelby dismisses his offer, saying she shall do it later. Billy insists and enters the basement with his flashlight, seeing Elizabeth bound and gagged. Shelby creeps down behind him, strikes him in the chest with an axe and takes his gun. She shoots him dead, puts his body in a barrel and burns it.  At the high school where Mike is being honored, he stands in the bathroom and takes off his jacket, only to see Elizabeth's initials on it. Realizing that Shelby had stolen the jacket, he thinks that Shelby must also be holding Elizabeth captive. He runs to her house to confront her where he hears Elizabeth in the basement and goes down to her. After a short standoff, Shelby shoots him in the leg. An altercation follows, resulting in Shelby fainting. He carries Elizabeth upstairs and stops to rest in the kitchen.  Shelby comes up and after more fighting is attacked by Elizabeth with Mike's football helmet. He tells her to stop, and when she does, Shelby reaches for her gun. Elizabeth then continues to beat her with the helmet. After that, Mike picks Elizabeth off her feet and carries her out.  The film fades to a home video of Shelby and Mike kissing and laughing about turning off the camera. The final shot is of Shelby's eyes opening, revealing that she is still alive.

Samantha is struggling financially so takes on a babysitting job for Mr. Ulman ([[Tom Noonan]]) and his wife ([[Mary Woronov]]). Ulman asks to meet her but stands her up, later apologizing and offering to pay double the original salary. Samantha accepts and gets a ride to the remote mansion from her best friend, Megan ([[Greta Gerwig]]). At the house, Mr. Ulman pulls her aside and reveals that he does not have any children to be monitored; the babysitting job is to attend to his wife's ailing mother. Samantha balks but finally agrees when she is offered $400 for the job, a significant increase in her pay. Megan immediately leaves, citing Ulman's lies and peculiar behavior, but she reluctantly promises to pick up Samantha later. Before the Ulmans depart, Samantha speaks with Mrs. Ulman, who tells her they are from "the desert."  On the way home, Megan stops in her car to smoke a cigarette.  When her lighter will not work, a stranger ([[A.J. Bowen]]) suddenly appears out of nowhere, startling her, and lights her cigarette for her. When Megan reveals that she is not the babysitter hired by the Ulmans, she is abruptly shot and murdered by the stranger. After ordering a pizza, Samantha dances around the house while listening to her [[Walkman]], accidentally breaking a vase in the process. While cleaning up the mess, she discovers a cupboard filled with old family photographs. In one photograph a different family than the Ulmans stands next to the Volvo she and Megan saw upon pulling up to the house. An additionally peculiar detail is that the family in the photograph has a young son. This seems unlikely as the Volvo is a new car and Mr. Ulman stated that although they had a child he was now grown.   Samantha, shaken by a number of issues at the house and being startled by the arrival of the pizza she ordered (by the same man that killed Megan), dials 911, but eventually manages to calm herself down. Drugs in the pizza eventually cause Samantha to pass out, just as she discovers activity behind a door leading to the third floor. When she comes to, she finds that she has been bound and gagged in the center of a [[Pentagram]]. As a [[lunar eclipse]] darkens the night sky, Mr. and Mrs. Ulman, along with the stranger, who is actually their son Victor, begin a bizarre ritual. Mother (Danielle Noe) is revealed to be a grotesque, witch-like figure. As part of the ritual she slices her arm and pours the blood into a goat skull. She uses the blood to draw occult symbols on Samantha's stomach and forehead, and forces Samantha to drink her blood from the skull.   Samantha manages to escape halfway through the ritual, killing Mrs. Ulman and Victor, but horrific images begin appearing in her mind. Mr. Ulman chases her out of the house and through a nearby cemetery. There, he tells her she was chosen. Samantha threatens him with the gun used to kill Megan, but Ulman passively accepts his fate, claiming to be a messenger and gloating that she's too late. Instead of shooting him, she shoots herself in the head, to Ulman's horror. The scene cuts to a broadcast about the strange lunar eclipse the night before, which has confounded scientists due to its abrupt ending, as Samantha is revealed to be in a hospital bed, in bandages. A nurse walks in and pats the unconscious Samantha on the stomach, reassuring her that "You will be just fine. Both of you."

The women awake in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver after Heiter informs him he is "not a match". Heiter secures a new male captive, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourist Katsuro ([[Akihiro Kitamura]]). The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating [[Siamese twins]], but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-[[anus]], so that they share a single [[Digestion|digestive system]].  After Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter explains that he had previously experimented with creating what he called a "three-dog", also joined mouth-to-anus. However, the three-dog died shortly after surgery. Heiter tells Lindsay that one dog tried to escape and that dog became the middle, thus this caused the most pain to the dog and as punishment for her escape attempt, she will become the middle part of his [[centipede]]. Heiter performs the surgery, placing Katsuro at the lead, Lindsay in the middle and Jenny at the rear. He removes the front teeth of both women and mutilates the buttocks of both Katsuro and Lindsay in order to provide easier access to the rectums, to which he hideously stitches and grafts their mouths. During his procedure, he severs the ligaments within his victims' knees to prevent leg extension, forcing his victims to crawl. He then connects his victims together in a straight line with their mouths surgically attached to the anus of the victim in front of them.  Once the operation is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with [[racism|racist]] insults and beating him with a [[Crop (implement)|crop]] when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro [[Defecation|defecates]], Lindsay is forced to [[Coprophagia|swallow his excrement]] while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from [[Sepsis|septicemia]]. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of the tourists, Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. When the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.  Upon returning to Heiter's home, the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as an injured Heiter hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with a scalpel pulled from his leg during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head before dying. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives. Her fate is left unknown. The film ends with the sounds of her sobbing while the camera pans to the roof of the house.

(film festival)|HUMP! film festival]]. They do not decide yet who will penetrate whom. Ben tells Andrew that he will discuss the project with his wife Anna (Delmore). However, as Ben begins to describe the project to Anna, she reacts skeptically at the mere mention of amateur pornography. Ben finds himself lying to Anna; he talks about the project with only vague detail, telling her that he will likely act as a behind-the-scenes assistant to the hypothetical film crew.  Later, Anna finds herself alone with Andrew and suggests that they have a drink together in an effort to get to know one another. Now drunk, the two begin discussing Ben and Andrew's art project, Andrew assuming that Ben has completely informed Anna of their intentions. After Andrew bluntly reveals that Ben will potentially have a gay experience, Anna becomes upset and confused, confronting Ben personally. The next morning, Ben insists that he still wants to go through with the project, and Anna consents.  Ben and Andrew meet in a hotel, bringing a video camera. Their attempts to have sex are prolonged by lengthy discussions and frequent analyzing of how to approach the experience. Although they film themselves kissing each other on the mouth, and [[hug]]ging each other in their underpants, neither Ben nor Andrew appear comfortable becoming completely naked, let alone having sex. The two continue to talk, not sure if either one will be able to achieve an erection, and begin to question the validity of their experiment as a work of art. Ben finally suggests that they call off the project, and the two laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. Ben leaves the hotel, intending to apologize to Anna. Andrew prepares to leave shortly afterward, but not before reviewing the footage that the two have recorded.

The Hunt for Gollum
 The film is set during the timespan of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. It takes place 17 years after [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s 111th birthday party and just before [[Frodo Baggins]] leaves the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]] for [[Rivendell]] (an interval which was not outlined in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|motion picture based on that story]]).  The wizard [[Gandalf]] fears that [[Gollum]] may reveal information about the [[One Ring]] to the [[Dark Lord of Mordor|Dark Lord]] [[Sauron]], and sends the Ranger [[Aragorn]], heir of [[Isildur]], on a quest to find him.  The story opens with a brief prologue about the ring's disappearance before cutting to Aragorn (Adrian Webster) and Gandalf (Patrick O'Connor) at an inn (presumably the [[Prancing Pony]]) in [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]]. Gandalf explains his concerns about Gollum's knowledge of the Ring falling into enemy hands, and asks Aragorn to find the creature with his tracking skills. After initially having little luck, Aragorn crosses paths with a fellow ranger and distant kinsman named Arithir (Arin Alldridge), a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger of the North]], who reports hearing rumours about a creature that has been stealing fish from open windows in local villages; the movie cuts to a scene of Gollum doing just that, and eating his ill-gotten gain atop the roof.  Aragorn and Arithir part ways, and Aragorn encounters and kills a pair of [[orc]] scouts in the forest. He soon locates Gollum by a fish pond afterwards and captures the creature in a [[snare trap]]. Having secured the whining and protesting Gollum inside a sack, Aragorn sets out for [[Mirkwood]]. On the way, he briefly spots one of the nine [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] in the woods, but avoids it. Later that same day, he is attacked by an orc [[squad]] and defeats them, but is hit by a poison dart which takes effect after he dispatches his last attacker. He collapses beside a patch of Athelas flowers and has a [[hallucination|vision]] of [[Arwen]] (Rita Ramnani) in [[Rivendell]].  Aragorn regains consciousness at dusk and discovers that Gollum has escaped from the sack. He seeks the creature well into the night, but finally finds him hiding up in a tree. Gollum fearfully explains that a Ringwraith is coming&nbsp;— seconds later, a Ringwraith indeed does appear and attacks Aragorn. After a short but intense duel, the Ringwraith flees from a bright light created by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of Mirkwood, who recapture Gollum and guide Aragorn back to their fortress.  The scene cuts to Gandalf emerging from Mirkwood's dungeons after interrogating Gollum. Gandalf tells Aragorn that Gollum knows of [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Shire (Middle-earth)|The Shire]], and explains that he must now go there to warn Frodo. Aragorn suggests sending Frodo to meet him in Bree, and Gandalf readily agrees. The film ends with Gollum speaking to himself in the dungeon, where he vows to kill "Bagginses" and reclaim his "Precious".

On the night of the dinner at the Recchi villa for the investors, a conversation between Edoardo Jr. and Eva is overheard, revealing she is pregnant with his child. Antonio prepares ''ukha''. When Edoardo sees this dish served, he instantly realizes his mother is having an affair with Antonio. He leaves the dinner table in a fury. Emma follows him outside to the garden and alongside the pool she tries to talk to him. At this point they speak Russian. In pulling away from Emma's outstretched hand Edoardo loses his balance, falls, strikes his head on the edge of the pool's stone trim, and falls into the pool. He sustains a [[cerebral haemorrhage]] and dies in hospital.  At the cemetery following the funeral, Tancredi tries to console Emma. She tells him that she is in love with Antonio. He responds by telling her "You don't exist." Emma rushes home and changes her clothes while her housekeeper helps her pack her things to leave. Before she leaves, she exchanges a knowing glance with her daughter, who it appears understands her mother's desire to follow her heart. Eva, who has hardly been noticed by Edoardo's family since his death, clutches her abdomen as she calls out to Eduardo Jr.'s siblings and grandmother, revealing her pregnancy. When the family members look back into the foyer where Emma was standing, she is gone.  During the final credits, Emma and Antonio are seen lying together inside a cave.

When a note attached to a scalpel informs them that the average person can survive for, at most, 30 days without food, they realize to their horror what their captor wants them to do.

I Love You Phillip Morris
 [[Steven Jay Russell]] is on his deathbed, recalling the events of his life that led him to this point. He spent his early adult years in [[Virginia Beach]] as a police officer. He plays the organ at church, has unenthusiastic sex with his wife, Debbie, and spends his off-hours searching for his biological mother, who had placed him for adoption as a child. Steven locates his biological mother, but she rejects him.  He then quits the police force and moves to Texas and works for [[Sysco]], the family business.  After a car crash on the way to a homosexual tryst, Steven leaves his family and life behind, though he keeps in touch with his wife and young daughter, and explores the world as his true self – a gay man. He moves to [[Miami]], where he finds a boyfriend, Jimmy, and they adopt a luxurious [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. To keep themselves in the style to which they have become accustomed, Steven becomes a con man. Steven is pursued by the police, and, after jumping off a parking garage, is sent to prison, where he falls in love with inmate Phillip Morris.  Steven cannot bear to be separated from Phillip. After being released, he helps get Phillip freed from prison by posing as a lawyer, then attains wealth by fraudulently acquiring a position as Chief Financial Officer of a large medical management company called USAMM.  Steven eventually is caught embezzling. While in the police car he reminisces about Jimmy in Florida dying of [[AIDS]]. He asks the police for Phillip's [[insulin]] and injects himself. He goes back to prison, Phillip is also sent to prison as an accomplice and angrily tells Steven he never wants to see him again. Months later, Phillip learns from another inmate that Steven is dying of AIDS. Heartbroken, Phillip calls Steven while he is in the infirmary and confesses that, while he is still upset with Steven for lying to him, he still loves him. Phillip is later told that Steven has died.  Sometime later, Phillip is taken to meet with his lawyer and finds Steven waiting for him. Steven describes how he faked dying of AIDS, to be allowed to see Phillip again, and promises never to lie to him again. He runs one last con to break Phillip out of prison, only to be caught when he runs into an old co-worker.  The end of the movie explains that the real-life Phillip Morris was released from prison in 2006; but Steven was given a life sentence and is in 23-hour lockup, only having one free hour a day to shower and exercise, which the film implies to be because an official involved in the sentencing had a brother-in-law who was conned by Russell.  The last scene shows Steven laughing joyfully while running across the prison yard, guards in pursuit, in another attempt to be with Phillip.

On the other side of town, [[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Madea]] ([[Tyler Perry]]) and Joe Simmons (Perry) catch Jennifer (Hope Olaidè Wilson), Manny ([[Kwesi Boakye]]), and Byron (Freddy Siglar) breaking into their house. After hearing the children’s troubles, Madea welcomes and feeds them. Jennifer tells Madea that they’re living with their grandmother, whom they haven't seen in four days. They tell Madea that their only other relative is their Aunt April.  April shares her home with her shady boyfriend, Randy ([[Brian J. White|Brian White]]), who’s married with children. The next morning, Madea brings the kids to April's house, but April doesn’t want to be bothered. Meanwhile, Pastor Brian ([[Marvin Winans]]) sends a Colombian immigrant named Sandino ([[Adam Rodríguez]]) to her house for work and a place to stay. April puts Sandino in her basement and wants to lock him down there because she doesn't know him that well. While working around the house, Sandino surprises April by cleaning himself up and becoming very handsome. When Randy arrives, he sees April with the kids and Sandino and heckles him while making subtle [[Child molestation|advances]] at Jennifer.  Shortly afterward, Pastor Brian and Wilma ([[Gladys Knight]]), a church member, come to inform April that her mother died from a fatal [[Cerebral aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] while riding on a city bus. April is devastated by the news and seeks comfort from Randy; however, he is sleeping and shrugs her off. Later, Sandino comforts April as she tells him about her mother's death and the last time she spoke with her.  Depressed, Jennifer goes to Madea wanting to know how to pray. However, Madea, inexperienced with prayer, attempts to instruct her in a scene that plays out comically. The same night, Wilma sings "''The Need to Be''", an uplifting song for women, and Tanya ([[Mary J. Blige]]), the nightclub bartender, sings "''I Can Do Bad''". Before singing the song, Tanya is fed up with April's attitude and tries to help her friend, despite the fact that she can't help April if she can’t help herself.  Over time, Sandino and April become  best friends, and Sandino fixes a ruined bedroom in her house. This makes Manny and Byron happy, but upsets Jennifer, who feels April does not want them there. While on a date, Sandino tells April he doesn't understand why she is with Randy and asks if she loves Randy. He tells her what true love is to him. One Sunday morning, Sandino eagerly knocks on April's bedroom door to get April ready for church, but Randy threatens to have Sandino deported if he continues to spend time with April.  Late the next night, Manny needs his insulin shot, and Jennifer goes to the kitchen to get it. As she prepares the shot, Randy approaches and attempts to [[rape]] her, but Sandino fights him off. April walks in on the fight and Randy claims Jennifer offered him sex for money. April claims to believe him and sends Randy to take a bath. When he is in the tub, April threatens to [[electrocute]] him with a plugged-in radio. Sandino arrives and tries to stop her, but April is enraged, as she explains that she was sexually assaulted by her step-father, who then lied about it to her mother, thus causing April to lose her faith in the people that cared about her. After saying does he want her to put it down twice, she drops the plugged-in radio into the water, giving Randy a severe [[electric shock]]. Randy barely jumps out just in time and Sandino orders him to leave.  April goes to the bar for a drink and blames herself for not seeing the signs. Sandino tries to stop her from drinking, but she pushes him away. She then asks Sandino if he is a child molester, because of all the attention he gives the children. Sandino tells April of his childhood as a child laborer and explains that he loves the children so much because he sees himself in them. Feeling hurt at her unfair accusations, Sandino says farewell to the children and leaves.  Jennifer and April begin to get along and connect after April tells Jennifer about her bad experience as a child. Jennifer tells April that she should recognize Sandino as a good man. Eventually, Sandino returns and April apologizes to him and admits that she loves him like a friend. Sandino tells her that she can't love anyone until she learns to love herself. He tells April that he is in love with her but he wants April to love him back the same way he loves her. He shows her by kissing her.  Eventually, April and Sandino get married. April and Sandino then hold a block party for their reception with Tanya singing "Good Woman Down", dedicated to April, then the new couple is shown embracing and sharing a passionate kiss.  
I Killed My Mother
 The film begins with Hubert Minel giving a black-and-white [[monologue]] explaining how he loves his mother but cannot stand being her son; he also reveals that when he was younger, things were better between them.  Hubert is a 16-year-old [[Quebec|Québécois]] living in suburban [[Montreal]] with his single mother, Chantale, who divorced Hubert's father, Richard, when Hubert was much younger. Hubert barely sees his father, and this adds to the animosity between mother and son. One morning, as his mother drives him to school, Hubert starts an argument with her about her applying makeup while driving. The argument ends when Chantale stops the car and tells him to walk to school. At school Hubert claims to his teacher, Ms Cloutier, that his mother is dead. After the teacher finds out that it is a lie, she expresses this lie as "you killed your mother." This inspires Hubert to write an essay for school titled "I killed my mother."  Later in the film, Hubert's friend Antonin is revealed to be his boyfriend, but Hubert has not told his mother, and she finds out from Antonin's mother, who assumed that Chantale already knew. Chantale, to some extent, accepts her son's homosexuality; however, she appears hurt that he did not tell her. Hubert wants to live in his own apartment and is happy that his mother says it is a good idea, but the next day she has changed her mind and does not allow it, claiming that she thinks he is too young.   Their relationship continues to deteriorate, and Hubert goes to live with his teacher, pretending to be staying with his boyfriend. Hubert's father invites him over for a visit; however, once there, Richard and Chantale tell Hubert they've decided to send him to a boarding school in [[Coaticook]]. Hubert is deeply angered that his father makes the decision, since Hubert only sees his father at Christmas and Easter.  At the Catholic boarding school, Hubert meets Eric, with whom he has an affair. Eric invites Hubert to go to a nightclub with the other students, where they kiss and Hubert takes [[Amphetamine|speed]]. He takes the Metro home, wakes his mother, and has an emotional conversation with her. The next morning, she takes Hubert to Antonin's mother's workplace to help drip the walls in paint. He and Antonin finish, and he lays down. Antonin proceeds to lay on top of him and kiss him, and they end up having sex. Hubert, later at home, trashes his mother's bedroom, but he calms down and cleans it up. The two fight and, in the morning, she sends Hubert back to the boarding school.  Back at school, Hubert is beaten by two fellow students. Hubert runs away with the help of Antonin, who has borrowed his mother's car. On the journey, Antonin tells Hubert that he is selfish and only cares about himself, but adds that he loves him. The school's principal calls Chantale to inform her of the developments, revealing the note Hubert left, saying he will be "In his kingdom". The principal also begins to lecture Chantale, which causes her to have an angry outburst at him, saying how he thinks he's better than her and how he has no right to judge a single mother. Chantale knows exactly where Hubert's "kingdom" is; the house he lived in as a child with both his parents.   Indeed, she finds Hubert and Antonin there. Chantale sits next to Hubert overlooking the beach. The film ends with a home movie clip of Hubert as a child playing with his mother.

I Give My First Love to You
 The film begins when Mayu and Takuma were children. They were friends since they were 8 years old. Takuma has a heart disease and he is treated by a cardiologist who happens to be Mayu's father. One day, Takuma and Mayu overhear that Takuma will not live past the age of 20 due to his condition. However, their friendship grows and Takuma becomes Mayu's first love. When they are out playing in the fields, Takuma promises to marry Mayu when they turn 20.  Time passes, and Mayu and Takuma have grown up and are attending junior high school, but their love for each other remains unchanged. However, Takuma, who knows his days are numbered, wanted to push away his feelings for Mayu and distance himself from Mayu, because he cannot stand to see her cry or hurt her more than he already has. He promised to himself that after his last day in junior high, he will leave Mayu. He decided to attend an elite high school, which Takuma thinks that Mayu cannot go into.  To Takuma's surprise, Mayu managed to go into that school and had actually done well enough in the school's entrance examination that she became the 1st year student body representative. She scolded Takuma in front of everyone in the school hall, when she should be making her welcome speech. She told Takuma that even if he wanted to abandon her, it will not happen in a 100,000 years. Therefore, they became known to the school as lovers.  Mayu then meets Kou, who likes her and asked her to be his girlfriend. However, Mayu refuses. On the other hand, Takuma meets Teru, another patient with the same heart condition as his whom he had met in the past, and Mayu gets jealous when he spent a lot of time visiting her. Kou asked Takuma to give Mayu to him, as Takuma should spare Mayu from the pain when Takuma dies. Mayu and Takuma broke up briefly because Takuma granted Teru her wish of experiencing a kiss before she died. When Takuma visited Teru the next day, he found out that she had died.  Takuma then issued Kou a challenge- they would run a 100-meter race, with the loser backing off from Mayu. Kou accepted the challenge but Takuma wins, and went to find Mayu for a date. That day, Kou went out of the school at the same time as Mayu and Takuma, and was knocked down by an oncoming train. Then, Takuma was informed that he had a suitable heart donor. Later, Mayu found out that the donor was the now [[brain-dead]] Kou, and tried to hide the fact from Takuma. However, Takuma eventually found out and refused the donation. At the same time, Kou's family saw that Kou had shed tears, and decided that there might be a miracle, and refused the donation as well. Mayu begged them many times, but they still refused to budge, although Kou had registered as a heart donor.  Later, Takuma suffered a heart attack. He was rushed to hospital, and the doctor did not give him much chance of living. In his sleep, Takuma prayed that he could have just a short time more to live, and he got a miraculous recovery, and surprised Mayu. He brought Mayu on their "honeymoon", visiting many places. Finally, at the field where they first kissed, Takuma told Mayu that he was very lucky and was happy with his life, handing over his lucky-charm 'will' to her that he had written when he was eight years old..  Upon their arrival back to the hospital, Takuma suffered another heart attack and despite the best efforts of the doctor, he passed away. Mayu went to the roof and opened his letter, which told everyone to be happy when he was gone. The film ends with Mayu borrowing the urn containing Takuma's ashes, and went to a church to have a "wedding", thus fulfilling their promise when they were young.  The ending scene is a flashback of the first time the 2 met at the hospital when they were 8 years old.  
I Love You, Beth Cooper (film)
 On graduation day at Buffalo Glenn High School in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], valedictorian Denis Cooverman confesses his love for head cheerleader and long time crush, Beth Cooper in his speech while also taunting Valli Wooley, a girl with an eating disorder, and an ignorant bully, Beth's [[U.S. Army|Army]] soldier boyfriend Kevin; and urging his best friend Rich Munsch to 'come out of the closet' and finally admit he's gay. Afterwards, Denis invites Beth and her friends, Cammy and Treece, to a party he has planned at his house.  At Denis's house, his parents leave but not before his father revealing that he has [[condom]]s upstairs if he needs them. Beth, Cammy, and Treece arrive at Denis’s house for the party. Kevin and his [[Hummer]] soon come barging in, with his Army buddies vowing revenge on Denis. They attempt to beat Denis up, but it results in Denis, Beth, Rich, Cammy, and Treece escaping in Beth's car.  They drive to a gas station hoping to get beer, but are told by the convenience store clerk that he will not accept the driver’s license Beth gave him which states that she is 37. So Beth bribes the clerk with a kiss. He accepts, which makes Denis realize that she is not who he thinks she is. They then start a bonfire in an isolated section of town where Rich, Cammy, and Treece are chased by a stampede of cows after trying to [[Cow tipping|tip one over]]. Denis then puts on the song "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]" by [[KISS (band)|KISS]] and is told that she was named after that very song. Denis thinks it's cool that Beth has two "headbangers" for parents. In Beth's eyes one can see she's slowly warming to Denis, and is becoming aware that he truly does genuinely love her, much to her amazement.  They all get in crazy reckless driver Beth’s [[Toyota Vitz#First generation .28XP10.3B 1998.E2.80.932005.29|Echo]] and drive without lights. They then stumble upon Denis's father and mother (who are both having car sex) by almost crashing into them. Rather than facing Denis’s father with his pants down, Beth decides to drive them away unseen to a private party at Valli Wooley’s house, encountering Kevin once again who had tracked them there. Kevin challenges Denis to a fight, as a now fed-up Beth crashes his car through the wall of the house. They drive away in Kevin’s [[Hummer H2]] to the vacant Buffalo Glenn High School, parking halfway up the front flight of stairs, and enter the school with Beth’s head cheerleader key. After showcasing their cheerleading routine, Beth, Treece, and Cammy decide to run to the girls' locker room to take a shower. Just as Denis is undressing to join his friend and the girls in the shower, Kevin and his buddies appear in the locker room and jump him once again. Rich challenges Kevin and his friends in a towel whipping 'duel', as he has been training for years after being towel whipped as a bullied young kid. Rich finally manages to defeat the three guys, towel-whipping them unconscious down a flight of stairs. They escape to Treece's father's cabin in Beth's Echo where Rich, Treece, and Cammy have a [[threesome]], as Beth and Denis enjoy the sun rise and finally share their first kiss.  They head to Denis's house afterwards where his parents are delighted to see he has 'hooked up', but make him aware he still needs to be punished for leaving the house in a wreck. Beth says goodbye to Denis, gives him a kiss, and touchingly thanks him for loving her. Denis tells her "what's not to love" and that she mustn't forget that. Then promises that he will see her at their high school reunion and if they are both still single that he will marry her. Beth smiles and tells him it's a deal. After Beth leaves with Treece and Cammy, Rich proclaims to Denis that he might be [[gay]] after all, or perhaps [[bisexual]] (plus jokes that after last night's antics he's still more heterosexual than Denis). Denis informs Rich that he was just playing about waiting until the reunion to talk to Beth again. He tells Rich that he is going to leave Beth a message on [[Facebook]] and ask her out. Rich disagrees with him and tells Denis that he should make a grand gesture by [[Say Anything...|going to her house with a boom box]] and wait for her. They then begin debating on how Denis should go about asking Beth on a date.  
I Love You, Man
 Peter Klaven ([[Paul Rudd]]), a [[Los Angeles]] [[real estate]] agent, proposes to his girlfriend Zooey Rice ([[Rashida Jones]]), and she accepts. Peter seems to not have any close friends to share the good news with, only family and mainly female acquaintances. After overhearing Zooey's friends voicing their concerns over his lack of close male friends, Peter decides that he needs to find male friends in order to have a [[Groomsman#Best man|best man]] for the upcoming wedding.  Peter turns to his [[homosexuality|gay]] younger brother, Robbie ([[Andy Samberg]]), for advice on dealing with men. He makes a series of overtures toward various men, including Barry ([[Jon Favreau]]), the persistently hot-headed husband of Zooey's friend Denise ([[Jaime Pressly]]) who doesn't really like Peter all that much to begin with...a problem that only escalates when Peter inadvertently projectile-vomits on Barry after winning a [[beer]]-drinking contest and is kicked out of Barry's house.  Feeling rejected, Peter is about to give up, when during an open house at [[Lou Ferrigno]]'s mansion which Peter is trying to sell, he meets Sydney Fife ([[Jason Segel]]), an investor who is attending the showing simply to pick up divorced women and take advantage of the free food. The two quickly become friends, especially bonding over their mutual adoration of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. Peter introduces Sydney to Zooey at their engagement party, but the meeting takes an unfortunate turn when a nervous Sydney makes a very awkward toast.  The next night, Peter agrees to attend a Rush concert with Sydney, on the condition that he can bring Zooey. During the concert, Zooey is left feeling ignored by Peter and Sydney. The next day, while shopping for tuxedos, Sydney asks Peter why he is marrying Zooey, and also asks for an $8,000 loan. After some thought, Peter decides to lend Sydney the money, and later grants him the honor of being best man at his wedding. Zooey, meanwhile, has become suspicious of Sydney. Peter tells Zooey that he lent Sydney money and asks her if she knows why they are getting married, since he had no answer to Sydney's question. (He wasn't aware that it was a question that was supposed to stay between him and Sydney.) Hurt and angry, Zooey leaves.  Peter leaves for work the next morning only to discover that Sydney has used the $8,000 loan to purchase several ridiculous [[billboard|billboard advertisements]] promoting Peter's real estate business (using pictures of Peter he took of him on his iPhone). Still upset over his fight with Zooey, Peter confronts Sydney and decides to end their friendship. Peter then patches things up with Zooey, explaining to her that while he is nervous, he is ready to get married. While Zooey and Peter prepare for the wedding, Sydney finds himself alone and desperate to hang with someone.  At work, Peter discovers that Sydney's billboard advertising campaign was successful, as he won back the right to the lucrative Ferrigno listing and many others left messages wanting him to sell their houses. Feeling encouraged, Peter finally stands up to his insufferable colleague, Tevin Downey ([[Rob Huebel]]), who had been badgering Peter for half the selling rights to the Ferrigno property (both to help him and to get in on the commission). When Tevin makes one final attempt to get a piece of it, Peter slaps him across his face and tells him to stay away from it.  Peter feels bad about fighting with Sydney but does not re-invite him to the wedding. Instead, he assembles an array of random groomsmen that includes Robbie, father Oswald ([[J. K. Simmons]]), and Ferrigno. Before the wedding, Zooey sees Peter looking forlorn, clearly missing his friend Sydney. She calls and invites Sydney, who is, unbeknownst to them, already en route to the wedding. Just before the vows are to be taken, Sydney makes a dramatic entrance via [[moped]]. He informs Peter and Zooey that he is, in fact, a successful investor and returns the money he borrowed from Peter, stating that the billboards were the couple's wedding present. Peter and Zooey declare their love to each other, Sydney assumes the role of best man, and the wedding commences.  As the end credits begin to roll, we see the wedding reception, where Peter and Sydney join the hired band (played by [[OK Go]]) in a rendition of the Rush song "[[Limelight (song)|Limelight]]" pulling Zooey on stage to join them. After the song ends, Sydney attempts to toast the newlyweds and Peter runs to frantically stop him as the screen cuts out (still remembering Sydney's ill-advised toast at the engagement dinner.)

Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid instead looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby ''[[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]'' the next morning.  Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the other animals' young and ruins a playground Manny built for his child.

Manny, Ellie, [[List of Ice Age characters#Crash and Eddie|Crash and Eddie]] the [[opossums]] follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast subterranean jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct.

As The Herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a ''[[Guanlong]]'' pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered ''[[Harpactognathus]]'' only to be chased by a flock of ''[[Pterodactylus]]'' on the way and saves his life. Manny reaches Ellie just in time to hear the cry of a newborn baby girl. He wants to name her Ellie, or Little Ellie, but Ellie instead names her [[List of Ice Age characters#Peaches|Peaches]] after the fruit (and the codeword they had chosen to use if she went into labor during the trip). Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to "his" children as he returns to The Herd and learns of Peaches' birth.  Before they can leave the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, who begins to attack them at full force; working together Manny, Sid, Diego, and Buck manage to trap Rudy by ensnaring him in vines. However, he quickly breaks free and resumes his onslaught. The Herd is saved by the timely arrival of Momma, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join The Herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends The Herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Momma's children. Diego decides to remain with The Herd, while Buck stays underground, happily battling it out with Rudy.

During one of his sojourns in some remote area in Karnataka he comes across the strange case of a village girl ‘Chenni’ by name, daughter of the village Patel and gets obsessed by her very unusual life. In trying to explore more information about her he discovers that she is a victim of a blind faith. Being a ‘Basavi’ she has to treat any guest to her house as the arrival of God himself. Thus she offers him all the comforts of life and serves him in every possible way. This comes as a big shock to Ananda who belongs to an urban milieu. In spite of her seductive ways he resists from exploiting her. He is warned by a mad soldier, a victim of the most unpredictable happenings during a war not to have anything to do with this unfortunate girl and not to stay in that cursed house. The soldier was taken for dead in a bitter battle. His young and lonely wife remarries. But after many months on an obscure day the soldier returns to find his wife pregnant and married to another man. He losses his mental equilibrium and roams about the village in his desert camouflage. He keeps warning people who come to stay in the Patel’s house. He is very critical of the foolish Patel who sacrificed his only daughter at the altar of the village Deity. Epidemics and wars are similar in nature. In an epidemic a few die and many survive. The epidemic disappears. In a war two neighbors fight some die serving the country, some enemies also die for the sake of their home land. War comes to an end and people live in peace. Ananda does not take he mad soldier’s warning seriously. He wants him not to have anything to do with this unfortunate girl.  Ananda in his quest wants to stay on and know more about this mysterious girl. When Chenni comes to him in the night and reveals what she is, he is very shocked. He tries to enlighten her saying that her faith is all rubbish. It is just a myth. He says that God cannot be offered what is not pure and touched. He made her to understand that, whatever she has been doing all these years is no different from what a sex worker does. True she may not be doing it for a living but what she has been doing in her blind faith is no different. Then what is the answer. He says that she should lead a normal life. Get married and face life like any other person. But who will come forward in all the villages around to marry her knowing her past. Chenni is prepared to go with Ananda if he can accept her. But Ananda is not bold enough to take the plunge. He succeeded in getting her out of her blind faith but is unable to give her an alternative. Next morning Chenni is missing. A search is on for her. Ultimately she is found dead on the steps of a temple pond. The entire village community looks at Ananda as the guilty one, forgetting their own guilt of keeping Chenni an out cast. The mad soldier seems to be the only person who has been sympathetic to Chenni. Unfortunately it is too late. The police arrive and declare that the whole episode as a case of suicide and there is no foul play. But to Ananda it is he who is the cause for Chenni’s death. He accepts his guilt. He was not daring enough to give her a new life.

The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus
 Doctor Parnassus' theater troupe, which includes [[sleight of hand]] expert Anton, confidant Percy, and Parnassus' daughter Valentina, performs outside a London pub. The troupe's main attraction is a magical "Imaginarium", which offers whoever enters it a choice between difficult self-fulfillment or easy ignorance. After a drunkard is swayed to the latter, Parnassus says he has lost another one to Mr. Nick, a suave personification of the [[Devil]]. Mr. Nick reminds Parnassus that in three days Valentina turns 16, and her soul will be his. Hundreds of years ago Mr. Nick tricked Parnassus into gaining immortality, after making a wager similar to his current predicament.  As the troupe crosses a bridge, Anton spies someone hanging beneath it. They rescue the man, who spits out a golden pipe when revived. Claiming to have [[amnesia]], he joins the troupe as a [[Barker (occupation)|barker]]. Parnassus becomes despondent over the impending loss of his daughter. Mr. Nick visits Parnassus, revealing the hanging man is a disgraced philanthropist named "Tony". He offers Parnassus a wager: Valentina can stay with whoever wins five souls first.  Tony convinces the troupe to remodel the show into a more modern act. While performing, Tony lures a posh woman into the Imaginarium and follows her, where they enter a pastel-coloured dream-world representing the woman's imagination. The woman's imagination also changes Tony's face; upon discovering this, he dances elegantly with her, and they spy a motel run by Mr. Nick. Tony convinces the woman to take a gondola toward a pyramid alone, winning a soul for Parnassus. Tony falls back out of the Imaginarium, returning his face to normal; the woman exits shortly after and gives the troupe a vast sum of money. When three other women enter, each emerges elated; and thus Parnassus wins three more souls. Four Russian gangsters, to whom Tony owes money, are taken by Mr. Nick when they chase Tony into the Imaginarium. The score becomes four souls apiece.  With the bet nearing its end, Parnassus reveals Valentina's conception to her: after ageing from immortality, Parnassus made a new pact with Mr. Nick to be youthful again, in order to win the heart of a woman he loved. In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick's property at age 16. Valentina attempts to run away, but Tony enters the Imaginarium to give his soul to Parnassus; in exchange, Parnassus must teach him the trance that powers the dream world. Valentina returns as he tries to enter the mirror, but Anton blocks them, having discovered that Tony is a fraudulent charity scammer.  Tony fights off Anton, pushes Valentina into the Imaginarium and joins her. Influenced by Valentina's desires, Tony's face changes again, and they float along a beautiful river in a gondola. After an impoverished child disrupts their boat trip, Tony transforms into a philanthropist speaking at a fundraiser. Anton, following the pair into the Imaginarium, appears as an outspoken child and exposes Tony as a fraud. A mob pursues Tony as the landscape disintegrates, causing Anton to fall into a void.  Distraught and angry over her father's bargain and a lifetime of hiding of the truth from her, Valentina gives her soul to Mr. Nick. Disillusioned by the easy victory, Mr. Nick offers Parnassus to trade Valentina for Tony. Chased by the mob, Tony flees to a [[gallows]], but Parnassus confronts him, holding Tony's pipe and a copy. Parnassus challenges Tony to choose which pipe is genuine. He chooses wrongly, inserts the copy in his windpipe, and is hanged. Mr. Nick keeps his word and Valentina is freed, but Parnassus is not told where she is, and is abandoned to wander in the Imaginarium.  Parnassus emerges years later, finding Valentina is married to Anton and they have a daughter. He watches them from outside a restaurant window, but when tempted to join them, he is stopped by Percy. Teaming up once more, Parnassus and Percy sell [[toy theatre]] replicas of the Imaginarium and the troupe on a street corner. Mr. Nick invites Parnassus over to him, but Percy puts an end to the temptation.

Whitefeather seems to have the whole company under some spell as he spiels his nonsensical idioms filled with Native American mumbo jumbo. These top executives seem more content with chanting Indian style noises rather than listen to how they can make money through sound investments.   When Evan finally discovers that his daughter, Olivia ([[Yara Shahidi]]), is somehow able to tell the future within the financial world by using her 'goo-gaa' comfort [[blanket]] and her [[imaginary friends]] (Queen Qwali and Princesses Kupida, Sopida and Mopida), he discovers he has an invaluable upper hand now at the office.  In order for Evan to ask these imaginary friends any question he must travel through the imaginary world, through a dense forest, past a dragon, through caves, and even walk through France. Before, Evan who is a part-time father really had no time for his daughter, now is forced to play with her and by her rules. After only a couple of days with her, he rediscovers the inner child within himself and genuinely has a lot of fun playing these imaginary games with Olivia.  Whitefeather becomes suspicious and begins to search for Evan's secret. When he finds out that Evan was just playing with a wakalyapi blanket, he purchases a six thousand dollar blanket and forces his son to tell him the "future" and making him extremely hyperactive by making him drink many cans of [[Red Bull]].

In order to be prepared for the most important presentation of his life, Evan must once again invoke the use of the Goo-Gaa blanket and meet up with the princesses. The only problem is that Olivia is spending the night at her friends house, and there is no way for Evan to obtain the Goo-Gaa without taking it from her.   Also, the presentations will be held on the day of Olivia's class play. Evan manages to get Olivia to give him the Goo-Gaa, but she is soon seen crying because he seems to care only about the blanket, not her. Evan returns home and tries to get the princesses' attention. Evan then starts working on his presentation. As hours pass, he stretches, and the Goo-Gaa falls on the floor, but he continues working without noticing.   Evan decides to go to the presentation instead of Olivia's class concert. Johnny gives his presentation, but his idea is too crazy for the owner of the company. Then it's Evan's turn.

Back at the class concert, Olivia is about to sing her solo part, then all of a sudden Evan appears dressed as a king, and Olivia starts singing, delighted to see him.   After the class concert, Evan starts talking to Olivia about how sorry he is for misusing her blanket, not caring about her, and for using the princesses for the wrong reason. Meanwhile, the owner of the company, D.D.E. appears, and wants to talk to Evan. He and Evan talk, and he decides to give the position to Evan because of how much Evan cares about his family. Evan accepts. Evan goes back to Olivia, for whom it is time to say good-bye to the princesses.

In the Electric Mist
 [[Iberia Parish]]'s Sheriff Detective Dave Robicheaux ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) is investigating the murder of a young woman and has a chance encounter with a pair of Hollywood stars, Elrod Sykes ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]) and his girlfriend Kelly Drummond ([[Kelly Macdonald]]). They are in the small town to make a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] film.  Due to Elrod's erratic driving, Dave determines that the actor is driving drunk and decides to arrest him. Objecting to being sent to jail, Elrod tells Dave of a decayed corpse that he and Kelly had found in the swamp.  Dave goes to investigate while remembering a murder he had witnessed as a teenager where a chained prisoner was shot in the swamp and disappeared into the bog. The discovery is soon tied to several murders in that area that had occurred recently, mostly to young runaways and prostitutes. The clues seem to point to Julie "Baby Feet" Balboni ([[John Goodman]]), whose ties with the mafia had caused Dave and him to drift apart and become enemies.  Balboni denies knowing the prostitute whose murder is being investigated. With little to go on, Dave visits the film site and meets the producer Michael Goldman ([[John Sayles]]) who states that while Baby Feet is helping to fund the film, he is not a co-producer as he had said.  Meanwhile, Dave's home life is disrupted by Elrod and Kelly, who begin turning up regularly, almost every time with Elrod being drunk. This prompts Dave to take pity on him as he, too, is a struggling alcoholic. His daughter, Alafair ([[Alana Locke]]) looks up to movie star Elrod, but wife Bootsie ([[Mary Steenburgen]]) has concerns.  The discovery of a second body prompts the FBI to become involved in the case. Dave is partnered with agent Rosie Gomez ([[Justina Machado]]). Dave attends a birthday party for Goldman and, though drinking [[Dr Pepper]], becomes terribly uncoordinated during his drive home and crashes his pickup truck, sending him off in a daze to the forest. There he encounters a camp of Confederate soldiers, and their commanding officer General [[John Bell Hood]] ([[Levon Helm]]) who apparently wishes to help Dave with his journey to solve these murders. When he awakens from his daze in a hospital, Dave learns from Gomez that his drink had been laced with [[LSD]].  Elrod drunkenly takes a boat out on the Bayou with Kelly, calling Dave when the boat engines get caught in gill nets. Dave gives Kelly his coat, as it is pouring rain, and a mysterious gunman shoots her in the chest, mistaking her for him.  General Hood offers advice again and Dave shakes off the feelings of guilt over Kelly's death. Elrod moves in for a while so Dave can be his [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] sponsor.  Dave's cop friend, Lou Girard, is found dead, apparently by shooting himself with a shotgun.  On the last occasion that Dave sees General Hood, the general and a few of his Confederate comrades are breaking camp and preparing to leave. They are having a group photograph taken and the general invites Dave to join them in the group.  A story from an alleged pimp corroborates a suspect, Murphy Doucet ([[Bernard Hocke]]) who, with his partner Twinkie Lemoyne ([[Ned Beatty]]), are responsible for the death of DeWitt Prejean, the skeleton found in the swamp. Dave arrests Doucet using a planted knife as evidence, but Doucet gets out on bail and kidnaps Dave's young daughter Alafair.  Gomez and Dave go to Baby Feet's residence and force him into telling them about a campsite Doucet owns. The pair head there. Gomez is startled by Doucet and instinctively shoots him. Dave plants a throw-away pistol on the unarmed villain to ensure that she is cleared of any charges of murdering him. They free Alafair and return home.  Months later, Dave, who had stopped seeing visions of General Hood after the case was solved determines that he was a figment of his imagination, a lingering spirit to help him through the most difficult case of his life. He moves on with his life, while Baby Feet, according to Dave was arrested for an issue that no one would have suspected, not as a mafia criminal, but as a tax dodger. Elrod too moves on with his life, leaving his alcohol addiction behind; he gives Alafair a small role in the Civil War film, and claims that she had been his salvation.  As the story ends, Alafair is looking through a book on the Civil War when she comes across a photograph of General Hood and his soldiers. We see a close-up of the photo; standing in the back, among the Confederate soldiers, is Dave Robicheaux. It is the photo taken during what Dave had supposed was a vision.  
In Her Skin
 The film begins when 15-year-old Rachel Barber ([[Kate Bell (Australian actress)|Kate Bell]]) misses her train home one night to meet with her father, Mike ([[Guy Pearce]]). Mike relays this unusual action to his wife and Rachel's mother; Elizabeth ([[Miranda Otto]]). Initially only moderately concerned; hours drag on and the Barber family begin a frantic search for her.  It is established Rachel is a well lauded dancer in her neighbourhood; a confident and gifted girl who follows her passion of dancing and is loved unconditionally by her moderately liberal parents and her caring boyfriend - Emmanuel Carella "Manni".  The next day, the Barbers report the incident to the police (despite an original attempt the same night of her disappearance - which was advised against by the officer Elizabeth was speaking to as it had only been a short time since her absence, and a missing persons investigation normally requires more time for certainty). The officer in charge quickly shows he is indifferent to the idea of yet another teenage runaway case: Rachel had gone missing with her backpack, with several of her most favorite possessions, making it look like she was leaving. As a result, the support he and his colleagues give is minor and distant. Everybody in Rachel's circle of friends and extended family is astounded by this story as she was believed to be very content in her life. Despite the pleas of the Barber family, the police take the case lightly and refuse an extensive search for their daughter.  The film then focuses on the life of Caroline Reed Robertson (Ruth Bradley); a former neighbor and babysitter of Rachel and the Barber family. Caroline is a disturbed teenager, who has struggled all her life with an elevated state of depression due to inferiority complex and parental rejection. Caroline is overweight, epileptic and has extreme self-loathing. She is very self-conscious about her weight and remains constantly apprehensive about going to school, where she is bullied.  She tries to seek comfort in her rich and successful but estranged father, David Reid (Sam Neill), by writing him endearing letters informing him about her day-to-day troubles and anxieties. After David divorces Caroline's mother, Gail (Rebecca Gibney), she seeks comfort in her sympathetic neighbour, Elizabeth Barber. Distraught Caroline follows her mother to the neighbor's house and sees the happy household of the Barbers. There she notices their daughter, Rachel, a much younger and beautiful girl in a great outfit practicing a beautiful dance. She immediately sees her as an embodiment of the perfect person she wants to be. She develops an obsession to study her and be like her. At her home, she continually practices how to be best friends with Rachel but fails to confront her in reality. Caroline distances herself from her depressed mother and tries to be closer to her father by putting her flaws on the table so he can comfort her. However, David's indifference towards Caroline grows with time; he sees her only as a liability, and minimizes her anger and tantrums.  As Caroline grows up to be independent in her ever-disturbed state of mind, she secludes herself in a dingy apartment and ignores everyone who actually cares about her; her mother and her sympathetic friends at work. She focuses on two people whom she admires and wants affection from; her callous father, and the unaware Rachel. While the Barbers forget about Caroline as her family moves away, Caroline continually observes Rachel and keeps making notes in order to emulate her in every way. She keeps failing, and as a result suffers ever more self-loathing. Caroline gets frustrated one day and devises a plan to murder Rachel and steal her identity - effectively "replacing" the girl she wants to be with herself.  She gathers herself and in her private, insecure state of mind puts on a confident public face. Very convincingly, she lures Rachel into her trap by asking her to take part in a confidential research study that would award Rachel with $500 and lots of beautiful clothing to take away. Young and naive Rachel is attracted to the offer and readily agrees to Caroline's seemingly harmless offer. In the meantime, Rachel enjoys time with Manni; she mentions to him her confidential high-paying job while ogling a pair of expensive shoes. Despite his concern, she refuses to divulge to him the nature of the job. She plans to execute the job, earn enough money to buy the shoes and tell him all about it later.  Caroline takes Rachel to her apartment, gets her to relax, casually socialize over drinks, and then meditate as a part of the study. And then Caroline brutally strangles her to death.  When Rachel goes missing, Manni eventually reveals to Elizabeth about the mysterious job. Upon learning this, the Barbers strongly believe their daughter's disappearance to be a kidnapping by a local brothel and attempt to coax the local police to investigate further. Once again, the effort fails due to the police's indifference. A few days later, an analyst with the police's Missing Persons department; Max DePyle, notices the missing persons posters of Rachel all over Melbourne (placed painstakingly by her family over very full and long hours of effort on the street). DePyle himself is a devoted father, and dedicates himself to aiding the Barbers as much as he can, as he senses something is wrong with Rachel's case.  DePyle calls in a favor with a friend at Australia's Most Wanted - he is able to get special attention from the media, and more people come forward to comfort and help the Barber family in pursuit of their missing daughter.  Caroline dumps Rachel's body at David's farm and feels liberated from the self-imposed pressure to be like Rachel. She believes her plan to be flawless and makes preparations to flee under Rachel's name. While still being moderately insecure, her depression begins to ebb and she feels smug to be in control. She calls the Barber's residence, showing her fake concern to gather knowledge about their search. She is taken aback when one of the witnesses comes forward describing Rachel's last contact with someone who looked like Caroline. Caroline's mother gets suspicious and informs her ex-husband and Caroline's father about her fears and her concern for Caroline. The police also figure out Caroline's possible involvement, and Detective Neil Paterson and DePyle come with a squad to apprehend Caroline for questioning. Caroline succumbs to the immeasurable pressure, collapses and is hospitalized. Her father, already disturbed by what Caroline may have done, kindly asks her to admit the truth to the police, saying that if she does she will be the daughter he always wanted (in truth, however, he wants to give her up to the police as an easy escape from dealing with his disappointment in his daughter forever). Moved to tears by this, Caroline confesses to Paterson she killed Rachel. Paterson arrests Caroline and charges her with Rachel's murder.  In a tense and quiet scene; a solemn Patterson and DePyle come to the Barber household and reveal Rachel is dead, and her body recovered, and Caroline is in custody.  The film ends with Caroline in prison awaiting trial, and Rachel's funeral being attended by her family, boyfriend, friends and many others, mourning Rachel's misfortune and death.  
In the Loop
 When both the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK]] and the [[Federal Government of the United States|US]] are suggesting military intervention in the [[Middle East]], Simon Foster ([[Tom Hollander]]), the Minister for [[Department for International Development|International Development]], unintentionally states that a war in the Middle East is "unforeseeable" during a radio interview on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]] programme. The Prime Minister's [[Spin (public relations)|Director of Communications]], [[Malcolm Tucker]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]), castigates Simon and tells him to [[toe the line]]. Toby Wright ([[Chris Addison]]), Simon's new aide, with the help of his girlfriend Suzy ([[Olivia Poulet]]), manages to get Simon into the [[UK Foreign Office|Foreign Office]] meeting that day.  Karen Clark ([[Mimi Kennedy]]), the US [[secretary of state|Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomacy]], who is against military intervention, is leading the meeting and flags a report by her assistant Liza Weld ([[Anna Chlumsky]]) titled "Post-War Planning, Parameters, Implications and Possibilities" (PWPPIP). The report heavily opposes intervention, noting the lack of intelligence except that which is coming from an unsubstantiated source known as "Iceman". Also during the committee it is hinted at that the US [[secretary of state|Assistant Secretary of State for Policy]], Linton Barwick ([[David Rasche]]), may have set up a secret war committee. After being ambushed by reporters, Simon contradicts his previous statement by saying the government has to be prepared to "climb the mountain of conflict" and is again subjected to [[chastisement]] from Tucker.  Returning to the US, Karen and Liza conclude that Linton has created a war committee under the guise of Future Planning. At a party Karen teams up with General George Miller ([[James Gandolfini]]) who opposes the war believing that the US does not have enough troops to succeed. She tells him that they could use Simon on the committee as he would "internationalise the dissent". While on a fact-finding mission in Washington, Simon and Toby are invited by Karen to the Future Planning committee. Toby accidentally leaks the details of the meeting to a friend at [[CNN]] before meeting up with Liza at a bar; they end up sleeping together. Due to Toby's leak the Future Planning committee is swamped, but Karen and George fail to find out anything about the war. Both Karen and Linton turn to Simon to back their respective causes, but he struggles to say anything meaningful and ultimately does not take a side. Tucker, also in the US, is diverted by Linton to the White House for a fake briefing. He confronts Linton, who tells him that he must supply the US with the British intelligence on the situation in the Middle East, with which Linton will influence the vote on intervention.  Simon, back in his constituency of [[Northampton]], is harassed by a constituent, Paul Michaelson ([[Steve Coogan]]), about the state of one of Simon's constituency office walls which he claims is on the verge of collapsing into his mother's garden. News of this reaches the papers, who criticise Simon for not acting on the issue. Suzy finds out about Toby's one-night-stand with Liza and they break up. When leaving their apartment he gives her a copy of PWPPIP to leak if she chooses, but she calls him a coward for not doing it himself.  The President rushes forward the security council vote on military intervention by vetoing tariffs on Chinese imports. Simon tells his Director of Communications Judy Molloy ([[Gina McKee]]), to leak to the press that he would resign if the committee votes in favour. Once at the UN Headquarters Tucker gets word that PWPPIP has been leaked, making a ''yes'' vote unlikely. It is later revealed that Michael Rodgers ([[James Smith (actor)|James Smith]]) of the Foreign Office accidentally leaked it, not realising its importance. Miller and Tucker convince Jonathan Tutt ([[Alex Macqueen]]), the UK Ambassador, to push the meeting forward so that the leak will not have time to spread in the US. However, Linton asserts his dominance over Tucker by telling him that the British intelligence has to be handed over before a vote can be taken. Able to make Jonathan reverse his changes and delay the meeting, Tucker, with the help of Senior Press Officer Jamie McDonald ([[Paul Higgins (actor)|Paul Higgins]]), fabricates the details of PWPPIP by forcing Michael to remove all the arguments against intervention and presenting it as the intelligence. Subsequently, the committee votes in favour of intervention.  After the vote, Miller informs Karen that he will not resign now that the war is happening. Simon realises that his own resignation is inevitable, but before he gets the chance, Tucker sacks him over his failure to prevent the collapse of the wall which had made headline news on [[BBC News|television news]]. He tells Simon that he cannot take any sort of stand on the war because he has contradicted himself too many times. Simon is reduced to mundane constituency business. A new Minister for International Development arrives at the office.

Then a man, Kevin, comes for the singer, tells the detective that he is going to take her on a yacht for a few days. The duo cops finagle an invitation on the yacht, as the man is a suspect of other crimes, but their boss has nothing on him.  The detectives take their wives with them on the yacht, and say that it is a vacation. While on the yacht, David gets a call from his boss saying that the kidnapper had a picture of him sitting beside Kevin. His wife, Lori, comes out and has an argument with David because he really is not paying attention to her. He asked Kevin about the photo, but he just blew him off as the guy was just someone trying to get close to the glitz and glamor.  In Lori's room, she is there with the wife of the other cop, Sue, and they talk about Jesus and how he can give peace, and Lori states that she wants that. She then asks God into her life and becomes saved. The next day, she is upbeat and when their friends go to visit an island, they stay behind because Lori has other plans, which include them going on a secluded island where she tells him she loves him. He asks what has gotten into her and she says "that is for her to know and him to find out." He says that he wants to rest after their picnic, so she says she wants to go get some seashells. He closes his eyes and when he wakes up she and Larry and Sue have disappeared...  
In My Life (2009 film)
 Shirley Templo ([[Vilma Santos|Vilma Santos-Recto]]) is a ruthless woman.  Many people deal with her strong attitude only for fear of her cold stare, or her outlash.  She works as a librarian in a school, and lives in a compound that is owned by her ex-husband, Benito Salvacion ([[Tirso Cruz III]]).  Many of the Salvacion family members that live near the compound, even including her eldest daughter, Dang ([[Dimples Romana]]), plead with her to sell it so they can make a profit, and she can move to a more suitable living area.  Hard-headed as she is, Shirley refuses and feels betrayed by her two daughters, Dang and Cherry, for even siding with their father who left them nearly fifteen years ago.  Even more upset, she finds out that Dang will want to move out of the Philippines to Australia.  Leaving her alone in the Philippines since all her children moved out, Shirley decides to move to [[New York City]] with her youngest and only son, Mark Salvacion ([[Luis Manzano]]).  Mark is unaware, however, that this supposed vacation of his mother is actually a permanent visit.  Upon her arrival to the States, Shirley is picked up at the airport by Noel Villanueva ([[John Lloyd Cruz]]).  Thinking he was only hired help, she rudely offers him payment for his services, but he declines.  As she walks around the apartment, she notices pictures of Mark and Noel being affectionate toward each other.  She then realizes that Noel is, in fact, Mark's new boyfriend.  Although she was aware of Mark's homosexuality since his high school years, she gives Noel plenty of trouble and hard times.  The story reflects how Shirley changes her attitudes and views from two men that become a big part of her life, and how she accepts the reality that has been presented to her.  Unfortunately, unforeseen tragedies occur, and a rift between Shirley and Noel arise.  But as she understands Mark's reasons for having her be around Noel all this time, she resolves her issues with him and soon embraces him as a member of her family.

Inglourious Basterds
 In 1941, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] [[Standartenführer|colonel]] [[Hans Landa]] interrogates French dairy farmer Perrier La Padite as to the whereabouts of the last unaccounted-for Jewish family in the area. In exchange for the Germans agreeing to leave his family alone for the rest of the war, La Padite reveals that the Dreyfus family is hidden under the floor. Landa orders [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] soldiers to shoot through the floorboards. The family is killed except for Shosanna, a young woman who escapes.  Three years later, Lieutenant Aldo Raine of the [[First Special Service Force]] recruits [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] soldiers to the Basterds, who spread fear among the German soldiers by killing and [[scalping]] them. The Basterds also recruit [[Oberfeldwebel|sergeant]] Hugo Stiglitz, a German soldier who murdered thirteen Gestapo officers. [[Adolf Hitler]] interviews a German soldier, Private Butz, the only survivor of a Basterd attack on his squad. Raine carved the [[Swastika#Nazism|Nazi swastika]] into Butz's forehead with a knife so he could never hide that he served in the [[Wehrmacht|German Heer]].  Shosanna is operating a cinema in Paris under an assumed name. She meets Fredrick Zoller, a German sniper who killed 250 soldiers in a single battle; Zoller is to star in a Nazi [[propaganda film]], ''Stolz der Nation'' (''Nation's Pride''). Infatuated with Shosanna, Zoller convinces [[Joseph Goebbels]] to hold the premiere of the film at her cinema. Shosanna plots with her projectionist and lover, Marcel, to kill the Nazi leaders attending the premiere by setting the cinema ablaze during the film.  Unknown to Shosanna and Marcel, British Intelligence Corps Lieutenant Archie Hicox is also planning an attack at the premiere with the Basterds. Hicox goes to a tavern with Hugo Stiglitz and German-speaking Basterd Wilhelm Wicki to meet an undercover agent, the German film actress and celebrity Bridget von Hammersmark. Hicox draws the attention of Wehrmacht Sergeant Wilhelm and [[Gestapo]] [[Sturmbannführer|Major]] Dieter Hellstrom with his unusual accent, and eventually gives himself away by ordering three drinks and gesturing "three" with his index, middle and ring fingers, as opposed to the German way with the thumb, index and middle fingers. Covers blown, the men engage in a brief shoot-out, which leaves only Sergeant Wilhelm and an injured Hammersmark alive. Raine arrives and negotiates with Sergeant Wilhelm for Hammersmark's release. Wilhelm agrees to release Hammersmark, but is shot by her when he lowers his guard. Suspicious, Raine briefly tortures Hammersmark before she gains his trust, and informs him that Hitler will be attending the film premiere, prompting him to decide to continue the mission despite the death of all German speaking Basterds. Meanwhile, Landa investigates the aftermath at the tavern and finds one of Hammersmark's shoes and a napkin with her signature.  At the premiere, two of the Basterds, Donny Donowitz and Omar Ulmer, join Raine in posing as Italians, hoping to fool the Germans unfamiliar with [[Italian language|the language]]. Landa, who speaks fluent Italian, converses and quickly sees through their cover, mainly due to Raine being unable to hide his Appalachian accent, but sends Donowitz and Ulmer, with dynamite concealed at their ankles, to their seats without exposing them. Landa takes Hammersmark to a private room where he verifies that the shoe from the tavern fits her, then he strangles her to death. He arrests the remaining two Basterds, Raine and Smithson "The Little Man" Utivich. Landa has Raine contact his superior with the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] and cuts a deal: he will allow the mission to proceed in exchange for immunity from his war crimes and other rewards.  During the screening, Zoller slips away to the projection room to see Shosanna. After she rejects his advances, he becomes aggressive. She pretends to acquiesce, then pulls a pistol from her bag and shoots him. As Zoller lies on the floor, mortally wounded, Shosanna turns back to the projection and watches Zoller's film, in which he is being portrayed as a brave war hero. Remorseful, Shosanna moves to embrace Zoller, who raises his pistol in response and shoots her before they both die. As ''Stolz der Nation'' reaches its climax, it cuts to spliced-in footage of Shosanna telling the audience that they are about to be killed by a Jew. Marcel, having locked the doors of the auditorium, ignites a pile of flammable [[Nitrocellulose|nitrate film]] behind the screen as Shosanna's image laughs. Ulmer and Donowitz break into the box containing Hitler and Goebbels, killing them, then fire their [[MP40|submachine guns]] into the crowd until their dynamite explodes, killing everyone in the theater. Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich into Allied territory, where they surrender. After the radio operator, Hermann, releases Raine and Utivich from their handcuffs, Utivich cuffs Landa. Brandishing Landa's [[Walther]] pistol, Raine shoots and kills Hermann, who is then scalped by Utivich. Raine then tells Landa that, while he will not face punishment for his actions during the war, he will never be able to hide the evidence of his atrocities. He then carves a [[swastika]] into Landa's forehead, as Landa screams in pain. Upon finishing, Raine remarks "I think this might just be my masterpiece."  
The Informant!
 [[Mark Whitacre]], a rising star at the [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM) office in [[Decatur, Illinois]] during the early 1990s, blows the whistle on the company’s price-fixing tactics at the urging of his wife Ginger.<ref name="Cain-behind"></ref><ref name="Cain-hobnobbing"></ref>  One night in November 1992, Whitacre confesses to [[FBI]] special agent Brian Shepard that ADM executives&mdash;including Whitacre himself&mdash;had routinely met with competitors to fix the price of [[lysine]], an additive used in the commercial livestock industry. Whitacre secretly gathers hundreds of hours of video and audio over several years to present to the FBI.<ref name="Cain-behind"/><ref name="Muirhead"></ref><ref name="Sidhu"></ref> He assists in gathering evidence by clandestinely taping the company’s activity in business meetings at various locations around the globe such as [[Tokyo]], [[Paris]], [[Mexico City]], and [[Hong Kong]], eventually collecting enough evidence of collaboration and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to warrant a raid of ADM.  Whitacre’s good deed dovetails with his own major infractions, while his internal, secret struggle with [[bipolar disorder]] seems to take over his exploits.<ref name="Cain-behind"/><ref name="Staff"></ref> The bulk of the film focuses on Whitacre's meltdown resulting from the pressures of wearing a wire and organizing surveillance for the FBI for three years, instigated by Whitacre's reaction, in increasingly manic overlays, to various trivial magazine articles he reads. In a stunning turn of events immediately following the covert portion of the case, headlines around the world report Whitacre had embezzled $9 million from his own company during the same period of time he was secretly working with the FBI and taping his co-workers, while simultaneously aiming to be elected as ADM CEO following the arrest and conviction of the remaining upper management members.<ref name="Cain-behind"/> In the ensuing chaos, Whitacre appears to shift his trust and randomly destabilize his relationships with Special Agents Shepard and Herndon and numerous attorneys in the process.  Authorities at ADM begin investigating the forged papertrail Whitacre had built to cover his own deeds. After being confronted with evidence of his fraud, Whitacre's defensive claims begin to spiral out of control, including an accusation of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] against Agent Shepard and the FBI, which had made a substantial move to distance their case from Whitacre entirely. Because of this major infraction and Whitacre’s bizarre behavior, he is sentenced to a prison term three times as long as that meted out to the [[white-collar crime|white-collar criminals]] he helped to catch.<ref name="Cain-behind"/> In the epilogue, Agent Herndon visits Whitacre in prison as he videotapes a futile appeal to seek a presidential [[pardon]]. Overweight, balding and psychologically beaten after his years long ordeal, Whitacre is eventually released from prison, with his wife Ginger waiting to greet him.  
Indira Vizha
  The movie revolves around sexual harassment occurring at work. This movie is loosely based on the Hollywood movie "[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]" starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Demi Moore]]. The film is the story of Kamini (Namitha) getting back at her ex lover Santhosh (Srikanth) by reentering his life as the wife of his boss, played by Nassar. Srikanth plays the creative head of a television channel Teen TV (though it does indulge in political exposes), who is married to debutant Hemamalini.  His life turns topsy-turvy when Nasser reinstates Namitha as the head of the TV channel, a promotion Srikanth anticipated for himself. Following this, it is the simple story with Namitha hurling sexual harassment accusations at him.  
Independencia (film)
 The film starts in a street scene. The people are in jovial spirits and are eager to celebrate the Philippines' newfound independence from Spain. The music and festivities then stop abruptly and they look up to the horizon. In few whispered words, the townspeople remark that "they are coming," referring to the American forces. Wary of the terror the soldiers might bring upon them, a mother ([[Tetchie Agbayani]]) decides to flee to the mountain jungles with her son ([[Sid Lucero]]). Deep in the jungle, they find an abandoned wooden hut and decide to settle there away from civilization and the perceived oppression that could come from the Americans. One day, the son finds a young woman ([[Alessandra de Rossi]]), exhausted and lying on the road after an American soldier rapes her. He tends to her, much to the reluctance of his mother. However, his mother eventually falls ill, then dies; he buries her in the middle of the forest. Afterwards, the woman gives birth to her child from the rape.  At this point, the film's narrative is interrupted. The celluloid reel is removed and replaced. This time, it is a newsreel narrated by an American broadcaster at first describing the Philippines in general, then proceeding to an event that occurred in a marketplace in an unnamed town. A young boy is shot by an American soldier, who thought he was stealing, although the vendor said that the boy was just being playful. However, the other passersby said that the boy was indeed about to commit a crime, justifying the soldier's action. The soldier then poses beside the dead body for the camera. The newsreel ends with a warning to all people who do questionable things: "Our brave troops are everywhere, ensuring that the streets are safe in this time of crisis."  The newsreel ends just as abruptly and the narrative resumes. The woman's little boy is now grown up and living very comfortably in the jungle. His makeshift family has discarded the few things that remained from their civilized life in the city. The child, not knowing about life below the mountains at all, is not afraid to roam in the jungle. He keeps telling the man and the woman of the white ghosts he sees between the trees. The man and the woman realize these are the soldiers and that it is only a matter of time before they are found. One night, while the man and the boy embark on a hunting expedition, a storm begins to rage across the jungle. It blows away their makeshift hut, killing the woman inside. The man also dies protecting the boy and keeping him dry. The boy wanders the jungle alone, until American soldiers find him. Terrified, he runs away from them, and the soldiers promptly shoot at him. The boy climbs up the mountain. His shirt slowly becomes hand-painted as he jumps off a cliff to his death. The sky in the backdrop also becomes hand-painted, first a faint yellow, to a bright orange, then finally a deep red.  
Ink (film)
  The film begins with a businessman, John Sullivan (Chris Kelly), in a hurry to get into his car. He appears to be severely stressed as he begins driving down the city streets. When he goes through a lighted intersection he is broad sided by another driver that is distracted by hot coffee in his lap. As he becomes unconscious, he dreams of playing with his young daughter, Emma (Quinn Hunchar). Emma pretends to be kidnapped and tells John to "save" her from the "monsters", although John seems exasperated and tells her to have her mother do it instead. Eventually, however, John gives in and runs to "save" his daughter, while Emma laughs and embraces him.  It is revealed that dreams are controlled by beings from an alternate plane of reality. The beings are spirits of deceased people from earth and are divided into distinct groups: Storytellers (bearers of good dreams), Incubi (cause of nightmares), and Drifters (those in a state of [[limbo]] who cause neither good or bad dreams). As the Storytellers and Incubi perform their daily work in the night, a Drifter known as Ink goes to Emma's room and removes her soul from her body. Although a number of Storytellers try to prevent the action, Ink escapes with the girl's soul into the dreamworld, leaving Emma's body unconscious. However, in the dreamworld, Ink is unable to open a portal to the Incubi's headquarters, where he intends to take Emma's soul. He is told that he must find and barter with two other Drifters to acquire parts of a code that will enable him to achieve entry into the headquarters.  Meanwhile, John, whose life has attained a sense of repetition and perfection, faces turmoil when an account he has been working to acquire is about to be swept out from under him. Soon after, Ron Evans (Steve Sealy), John's estranged father in law, comes to inform John that Emma is in a coma and has been placed in a hospital. Although Ron begs John to go and see the girl, John refuses and berates Ron, saying that the father-in-law turned the world against him. Shortly after, Ron is ordered out of John's office. It is revealed that Ron and his wife were given custody of Emma after the death of John's wife Shelly (Shannan Steele) in a car accident, due to John's grief-induced addiction to alcohol and drugs.  At the same time in the dreamworld, the Storytellers Allel, Gabe, and Sarah (played by Jennifer Batter, [[Eme Ikwuakor]], and Shelby Malone, respectively) work to find a way to awake Emma. In order to do this, they receive the help of Jacob (Jeremy Make), an eccentric blind spirit known as a "Pathfinder". Meanwhile, a Storyteller named  (Jessica Duffy) confronts Ink and attempts to discourage him from delivering Emma to the Incubi. After Ink threatens to murder Emma if Liev continues to pursue him,  surrenders to Ink as a prisoner. It is revealed that Ink is taking Emma's soul to the Incubi in order to become one of them and cease to be a Drifter. Soon after, Ink successfully barters with two Drifters for parts of the code. As Ink's prisoner,  tries to bolster Emma's bravery in order to thwart Ink.  During this time, the Pathfinder Jacob unveils his abilities to the Storytellers: tapping into the "beat of the world" in order to cause physical changes that affect the course of time. Through a chain of events, Jacob causes several small accidents that culminate in a truck running a red light and crashing into John's car, revisiting an opening scene of the film. Due to his injuries, John is taken to a hospital, which turns out to be the same hospital where Emma is checked in. After recalling his happiness before his wife died, John walks to Emma's room, guarded by Allel as an unseen battle ensues between the Storytellers and Incubi.  In the dreamworld,  discovers that Ink arrived after his human counterpart committed [[suicide]]. Ink, being ashamed of his hideous and scarred appearance, believes the Incubi will help him; the Incubi having been revealed to all wear apparati that project facades of bliss and happiness to hide their misery. After making their way to the stronghold of the Incubi, Ink offers Emma and  as his payment to the leader. As  attempts to stand up to the leader of the Incubi, she is mortally wounded. While dying, Liev pleads with Ink to "remember". Suddenly, Ink has a revelation: he recalls that Emma died in the hospital without her father's presence; and John, driven to further depression and regret, shot himself in despair, at which time his soul entered the dreamworld and became the Drifter known as Ink. Ink understands that he is, in fact, John Sullivan's soul from a future in which Emma dies and he does not visit her at the hospital (time flows differently in the dreamworld). In this realization, Ink rushes at the Incubi and kills them to rescue his daughter, mirroring the dream scene in the beginning of the film. After the fight is over, Emma's soul embraces Ink, realizing that it is her father. In the normal world, Pathfinder Jacob activates a device that calls the other Storytellers as reinforcement, with the onslaught of Storytellers defeating the Incubi. John finally makes his way to Emma's room. The film closes as Emma awakes to find her father at her bedside.  
Infestation (film)
 Cooper ([[Chris Marquette]]) is a slacker and he works as a [[telemarketer]]. On a Friday, he turns up late for work and is promptly fired by his boss, Maureen ([[Deborah Geffner]]). He is fired for coming late, driving customers away and was fooling around in the office. Shortly after, an extremely loud sound is heard and Cooper faints with pained expressions on his face.  Cooper wakes up a few days later, only to find himself nauseous, weak and covered in webbing (cocooned) in his office. As Cooper struggles out of the cocoon, he is attacked by a big, beetle-like, bug. He fights the bug away and helps his boss Maureen out of a cocoon. Maureen regains consciousness and realizes that her daughter, Sara ([[Brooke Nevin]]) was waiting for her outside the office. Cooper and Maureen go outside to check on Sara, who is unconscious and trapped inside a cocoon in her car. As Cooper is helping Sara out of the cocoon, Maureen is attacked and captured by a large, wasp-like creature. Other bugs surround them and they use  Sara's car alarm to distract the bugs and escape to a restaurant.  There they revive Cindy (Kinsey Packard), Hugo (E. Quincy Sloan), Hugo's father Albert (Wesley Thompson), Leechee ([[Linda Park]]), Roger (Bru Muller), PJ (Vlado Mihailov) and a Cop (Todd Jenson). PJ and Roger decide to escape in Roger's truck against the advice of others. They are attacked by the bugs and in the chaos PJ, Roger and the cop are killed. Albert is stung by a bug, while Cooper saves Cindy from being crushed by Roger's runaway truck, with the rest of the group deciding to stay indoors.  Leechee and the group make their way to roof of a building and see a group of the wasps flying toward them. The group then realize that the bugs are blind and they use sound to track their victims, as the wasps did not attack them. They use a radio to lure a bug in a storage closet and milk it to identify the contents of its venom. Leechee analyses the venom and realizes that it contains sedatives and some proteins. They decide to go to the nearest military airbase at Gibson the next day and decide to camp for the night in the same building. They also see the bug hive, which is emitting red colored gas. The next day, the group leave the building to make their way to Cooper's dad, while Leechee decides to stay behind to help revive more people and to study the bugs.  The rest of the group sets off and goes to Hugo's and Albert's house first. Albert's wife seems to have died of natural causes. They next go to Cindy's brother, Chad's (Mike Straub) house. Cindy finds her sister-in-law Susan (Daniela Tonova) cocooned and she revives her. They also find Chad, who has mutated into a large spider-like creature because of a giant wasp sting. Chad is collecting cocooned humans and he attacks the group, killing Susan, knocking out Sara, impaling Cooper when he tries to save Cindy and is finally killed by Hugo and Albert.  They camp for the night at Chad's house and Sara patches up Cooper. Cindy wants Cooper to ditch the group and come with her but Cooper is in love with Sara and he turns down the offer. The next day they decide to go to Cooper's dad, Ethan's ([[Ray Wise]]) house. Ethan is a former military personnel who has weapons and a bunker at his house. Sara informs Cooper that she intends to go to the bug hive to find her mother. Cooper tries to convince her to come with him to a military airbase but she doesn't agree. They come across a few flying bugs and hide under a bridge. Cindy sees Cooper and Sara holding hands, becomes furious, and shouts to attract the bugs towards the group. Albert shoots Cindy to save the group but Sara is captured by the bugs. Finally the group reaches Ethan's house and Albert turns into a mutant, similar to Chad. Hugo shoots his father to save himself, Ethan, and Cooper.  Cooper tries to convince Ethan to help him save Sara but when he fails he leaves Ethan and Hugo behind. Cooper is captured by another group and they lock him up in a prison cell in an abandoned police station. There he meets a Puerto Rican man, who tells him that he was part of Leechee's group and that the others died in an explosion caused by the flammable red colored gas released by the bugs and the nest. Hugo and Ethan are captured by the same group. It is revealed that Ethan has been stung by a wasp and the Puerto Rican man turns into a mutant. Ethan uses the distraction to kill the members of the enemy group and save Cooper and Hugo.  Meanwhile, Sara wakes up in the bug hive and comes across the queen consuming cocooned humans. Ethan, Hugo and Cooper reach the hive. Ethan hand-cuffs Cooper to a tree and hits Hugo in the head. He leaves the keys so that Cooper and Hugo can escape. Ethan enters the hive alone to destroy it and he comes across Sara. Sara offers to take Ethan to the queen. Ethan and Sara are then attacked by the queen. Hugo and Cooper enter the bug hive, arriving in time to help Sara and Ethan. The group begin to attack the queen with their weapons. This only angers the queen, who begins to wail loudly. As the group cower in pain at the volume of the wail, Hugo, who was unable to hear the wail as he had lost his hearing, throws the explosives into queens mouth. Ethan asks Sara, Cooper and Hugo to escape from the bug hive while he triggers the explosive. But soon after, Ethan turns into a mutant. Cooper takes the remote from his father and triggers the explosive, obliterating the nest and the insects inside.  The film ends with Cooper, Sara and Hugo turning toward the sound of a large rumbling. The source of this rumbling is not specified as the film then turns to black in a cliffhanger. The rumbling is suggested to be either the insects returning or the Army finally arriving to deal with the infestation.

The International (2009 film)
 Louis Salinger, an [[Interpol]] detective, and Eleanor Whitman, an [[New York County District Attorney|Assistant District Attorney]] from [[Manhattan]], are investigating the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC), which funds activities such as [[money laundering]], [[terrorism]], [[Arms trafficking|arms trading]], and the destabilization of governments. Salinger's and Whitman's investigation takes them from [[Berlin]] to [[Milan]], where the IBBC assassinates Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer who is an [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian prime ministerial]] candidate. The bank's assassin diverts suspicion to a local assassin with political connections, who is promptly killed by a corrupt policeman. Salinger and Whitman get a lead on the second assassin, but the corrupt policeman shows up again and orders them out of the country. At the airport they are able to check the security camera footage for clues on the whereabouts on the bank's assassin, and follow a suspect to [[New York City]].  In New York, Salinger and Whitman are met by two [[New York Police Department]] (NYPD) detectives, Iggy Ornelas and Bernie Ward, who have a photograph of the assassin's face when he arrived in New York airport. Salinger, Ornelas, and Ward locate Dr. Isaacson to whose practice the assassin's [[leg brace]] has been traced. They find the assassin and follow him to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]].  Jonas Skarssen, the chairman of the IBBC, reveals to his senior men White and Wexler that the bank had Calvini killed so that they could deal with his sons to buy [[missile guidance]] systems in which the bank has invested. Since the bank knows that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin, they send a hit team to kill him at a meeting between him and his handler, Wexler. Wexler leaves and is arrested by Ornelas. As Salinger speaks to the assassin, a shootout at the Guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attempt to kill them with automatic weapons. They escape, but the assassin is mortally wounded.  In interrogation, Wexler, a former [[Stasi]] colonel, explains to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable because of its utility to terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. Even if he succeeds in bringing the IBBC down there are hundreds of other banks which will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to go outside the system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and have White killed.  Salinger then accompanies Wexler to [[Istanbul]], where Skarssen is buying the crucial components from their only other manufacturer. Salinger attempts to record the conversation so that he can obstruct the deal by proving to the buyers that the missiles will be useless, but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by Enzo and Mario Calvini to avenge their father's murder by the bank. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC, have led him to nothing.  During the closing credits, it is indicated that the bank is successfully continuing with its operations despite the death of its Chairman—as Skarssen had predicted to Salinger before he was killed. However, with the new and more aggressive chairman, it is hinted that the IBBC's increased expansion and aggression will ultimately lead to its downfall, as shown by the last panel, revealing the beginnings of a [[United States Senate]] investigation, headed by Whitman.

Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the profession and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and he is unable to stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's [[red-light district]] with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a [[rosary]] instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien ([[Brian Baumgartner]]), who advises him not to become too personally involved.<ref name="film">Patrick Coyle (Director). (2009). ''Into Temptation'' [Motion picture].

As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a [[John (prostitution)|john]] (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches a glimpse of the crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the [[archbishop]] concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.<ref name="film"/>  Father John learns the john's car belongs to an accountant named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call girl who is widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her on the path to prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to deny any wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag ([[Bruce A. Young]]), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair. The pimp, who knows Lloyd from his boxing days, tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in. There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke ([[Tony Papenfuss]]), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment. Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach.<ref name="film"/>  At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda has moved out, but they discover she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping out at the church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he is too late to save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.<ref name="film"/>

Into the Blue 2: The Reef
 In [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], with a man dumps large containers into the ocean and then goes to meet with a few men in suits expecting to get paid. But because he dumped the containers and altered the schedule of those container shipments to the customer, he is killed.  We are then taken underwater in the blue ocean as Sebastian ([[Chris Carmack]]) and his girlfriend Dani ([[Laura Vandervoort]]) are dive surfing with a model. We learn that the group own a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients. Sebastian does not want to do this line of work forever.  For Sebastian, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship ''San Cristobal'', which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a large treasure.  Sebastian believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life.  Sebastian hangs out with his friend and employee Mace ([[Michael Graziadei]]) and his girlfriend Kimi ([[Mircea Monroe]]), Dani's best friend, who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Mace tends to get involved with other women. While Mace and Kimi have a crazy relationship, Sebastian and Dani are very much in love.  While at work, they are visited by Carlton ([[David Anders]]) and Azra ([[Marsha Thomason]]), a couple who wants to hire them for diving in the North Reef for a week because they are looking for the ''San Cristobal''.  Of course, Sebastian has been trying for several years to find it but Carlton happens to have a map which may lead them to the treasure. So, both Sebastian and Dani agree to help the couple. The four go on various diving expeditions to find the treasure.  We then get to see some of the beach life as all six individuals enjoy the beach. Dani, Kimi, Sebastian, and Mace get involved in separate [[beach volleyball]] competitions. Sebastian and Mace go against their main diving competitors, Avery (Rand Holdren), who dates a girl named Kelsey ([[Audrina Patridge]]), who loves to lecture him when he gets into trouble by messing around with women.  While at a club, another customer hits on the women and grabs the arm of Azra, who quickly puts him in a headlock. This raises the first red flag for Dani, who becomes suspicious.  The following day, we learn that Carlton is not really looking for the ''San Cristobal''. He actually helps big clients smuggle treasure to other locations. Both Carlton and Azra tell Sebastian and Dani that if they help them find the two containers, they will earn $500,000. Also, we learn that if Carlton does not find the containers in a week, the men will kill them. The reason why he is willing to pay them a lot of money is part of an apology because the men who hired him know the names of Sebastian and Dani and their lives are in danger too.  So, now both Sebastian and Dani are forced to help Carlton and Azra find the two containers but while they are at sea, Avery takes notice and he starts looking to find whatever they are looking for.  With their lives threatened, Dani convinces Sebastian that they must look to see what is in those containers and why their lives are being threatened. Something terrible could be in those containers and they need to check them without bringing Carlton and Azra along.  Thus, the two take their boat out to sea late at night to dive and see what those containers are. What they find in the containers is not a treasure but a bomb. When they return from their boat after the dive, they are greeted by Carlton and Azra, who have been hiding in their boat and are ready to kill them. Carlton tells them that in container one there is the casing and in container two there is a nuclear warhead. One without the other is useless but together they make a powerful weapon. Their goal is to create a second [[Pearl Harbor]].  Dani jumps off the boat to try to get help. She is found in the morning one mile off shore and is put in the hospital. At the same time, Azra and Carlton kidnap Mace and Kimi from their apartment and bring them back to the boat. They spend the night bound and gagged with Sebastian, and the next morning Carlton threatens to kill Kimi if Mace and Sebastian fail to retrieve the containers from the bottom of the sea. Azra tries to kill Dani in her hospital room, but she runs away and a chase ensues. Meanwhile, Sebastian and Mace try to bring up the containers for Carlton. Mace purposely messes up and Kimi is killed. Sebastian and Mace rebel, ending in Carlton and his bodyguard dead. Dani outruns Azra and Azra kills her boss so she can disappear again. Dani, Sebastian, and Mace reunite. They then have Kimi's funeral.  Six months later, Sebastian and Mace find the ''San Cristobal'' and buy their someday boat.  
Invictus (film)
  On 11 February 1990, [[Nelson Mandela]] is released from [[Victor Verster Prison]] after having spent 27 years in jail.<ref></ref> Four years later, Mandela is elected the [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992#Aftermath|first black President of South Africa]]. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post-Apartheid era]], including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and [[white South Africans]], which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black [[African National Congress|ANC]] additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.  While attending a game between the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]], the country's [[rugby union]] team, and [[England national rugby union team|England]], Mandela recognises that the black people in the stadium are cheering for England, and not their own country, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on [[Robben Island]]. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, [[François Pienaar]] ([[Matt Damon]]), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with François a British poem, "[[Invictus]]", that had inspired him during his time in prison.  François and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of [[Racism in South Africa|racial tensions]], as for many black people, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise [[Baasskap|white supremacy]]. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.  Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population. By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela's efforts. Mandela's security team also grows closer as the racially diverse officers come to respect their comrades' professionalism and dedication.  As Mandela watches, the Springboks defeat one of their [[History of rugby union matches between Australia and South Africa|arch-rivals]] - [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], the defending champions and known as the Wallabies - in their opening match. They then continue to defy all expectations and, as Mandela conducts trade negotiations in [[Taiwan]], defeat [[France national rugby union team|France]] in heavy rain to advance to [[1995 Rugby World Cup Final|the final]] against their other [[History of rugby union matches between New Zealand and South Africa|arch-rival]]: [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], known as the All Blacks. New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks then the only side to have a winning record (20-19-2) against the All Blacks, since their first meeting in 1921.  Before the game, the Springbok team visits [[Robben Island]], where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail. There, Pienaar is inspired by Mandela's will and his idea of self-mastery in "Invictus". François mentions his amazement that Mandela "could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put [him] there".  Supported by a large home crowd of all races at [[Ellis Park Stadium]] in [[Johannesburg]], Pienaar motivates his teammates for the final. Mandela's security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a [[South African Airways]] [[Boeing 747]] jetliner flies in low over the stadium. It is not an assassination attempt though, but a demonstration of [[patriotism]], with the message "Good Luck, Bokke" — the Springboks' Afrikaans nickname — painted on the undersides of the plane's wings. Mandela also famously arrives onto the field before the match wearing a Springbok cap and a replica of Pienaar's #6 jersey.  The Springboks complete their run by beating the All Blacks 15-12 in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], thanks to a [[drop goal]] from [[Rugby union positions#Fly-half|fly-half]] [[Joel Stransky]]. Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory, and Mandela hands Pienaar the [[William Webb Ellis Cup]], signaling that the Springboks are indeed rugby union's world champions. Mandela's car then drives away in the traffic-jammed streets leaving the stadium. As Mandela watches the South Africans celebrating together from the car, his voice is heard reciting "Invictus" again.  
The Invention of Lying
 The film is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative reality]] in which lying does not exist.  Mark Bellison is a [[screenwriter]], in a film industry limited to historical readings because there is no fiction. One night he has a date with the beautiful and [[wealth]]y Anna McDoogles. She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and failing financial situation, but is going out with him as a favour to his best friend Greg Kleinschmidt.  The next day Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films, and his landlord threatens to evict him for not paying his rent. Crestfallen, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down, and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] that enables him to tell the world's first lie, which is that he has $800 — the amount he owed his landlord — in his account. He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, such as preventing a police officer from arresting Greg for [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and stopping his [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]] neighbour Frank Fawcett from committing [[suicide]]. He realises that lying can be used for helping others rather than personal gain, and writes a screenplay about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century, in which it is claimed that everyone's memories were erased. He becomes wealthy from the film's success.  Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again; she congratulates Mark for his financial success and admits that he would be a good husband and father, but she is still not attracted to him. Mark then gets a call that his mother has had a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor tells him that his mother is going to die. She is scared of death, believing that it will bring an [[Eternal oblivion|eternity of nothingness]]. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful [[afterlife]], introducing the concept of a [[Heaven]] to her, and she dies happy.  Mark soon receives worldwide attention for his supposed new information about death. After encouragement from Anna, he tells the world, through "ten rules" (mirroring the [[Ten Commandments]]), that he talks to a "Man In The Sky" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after death, as long as you do no more than three "bad things". Some time later Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, would his now being rich and famous make their children more physically attractive. Mark wants to lie but does not because of his love for Anna, and says no.  Meanwhile, Mark's enemy Brad Kessler pursues Anna romantically, motivated by Mark's success. Though Brad's selfish, cruel manner makes Anna uncomfortable, she continues dating him and they become engaged. Before the wedding Greg appears and convinces Mark that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage, but the officiant informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie. Anna struggles to understand the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it "wouldn't count". Anna confesses that she loves him.  Some time later, Anna and Mark are shown happily married with a son, who appears by his actions to have inherited his father's ability to lie.

Jingles the Clown
  Mr. Jingles, a [[serial killer]] and the co-host of a children's television series, abducts the Nelson family, and forces nine-year-old Angela to watch as he films himself murdering his parents, and sister. The police arrive in time to save Angela, and they arrest Jingles, though the sheriff is so disgusted by the clown's actions that he executes Jingles. The seemingly dead Jingles is thrown into the trunk of a police cruiser, but as Angela is led away, he winks at her. The next day, the deputies who were going to dispose of Jingles are found butchered, and Jingles is assumed to have drowned in a pit while making his escape.  Years later, Miranda, the producer of the television series ''Haunted Maniacs'', acquires access to Jingles's old home, where she plans to film the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of the show, which will have Angela as a special guest. Two nights before ''Haunted Maniacs'' is set to shoot, Jingles kills a pair of teenagers trespassing on his property. The crew of ''Haunted Maniacs'' reaches the Jingles estate, and despite Angela's anxiety and finding evidence of the young couple murdered there earlier, set up as planned.  The crew explores the Jingles mansion, and discusses Jingles's history, revealing he was the result of an incestuous relationship between his grandfather and mother, who murdered her sexually abusive parents with a [[cleaver]]. Guy, the psychic, goes off alone to smoke, and is killed by Jingles, an event which is felt by Marco, the [[Mediumship|medium]]. Marco warns the others about what he sensed, and as they go to leave, they run into David Hess, the caretaker. David tells the crew about the missing couple, the owners of the bloody objects they stumbled upon hours ago. The vehicles all fail to start, so David and Jimmy head to David's house to call 911.  The [[ghost hunting]] equipment goes haywire, and carnival music emanates from the [[stable]]s, so J.B. and Sam go to investigate, finding an old stereo, and David and Jimmy's mutilated remains. The two get the others, and they all try to make a run for it, but retreat back to the manor when they spot Guy's body on the path, tied to a cross and set ablaze by Jingles, who taunts Angela. Jingles sneaks into the house, and performs a dark ritual in the attic, while downstairs the ghost of Angela's sister, Amy, manifests. Amy explains that Jingles is powered by the souls of his victims being channeled through something, and is unstoppable as long as he remains on his property. Amy goes on to state that while she and the spirits of the others killed by Jingles can hold him off temporarily to allow the ''Haunted Maniacs'' crew to escape, Angela must remain behind.  Jingles fatally stabs Marco, electrocutes Sam as she tries to help Marco, and kills Tom with a [[pickaxe]]. The others remember what Amy said about Jingles receiving his power from something, and conclude that if they find and destroy the conduit, Jingles will become killable. Angela, J.B., and Mia go to look through Jingles's belongings in the attic, while Miranda stays behind, and is beat to death with a [[mallet]] by Jingles. The remaining three reach the attic, where Jingles snaps J.B.'s neck, and captures Angela and Mia. Jingles decapitates Mia, reveals to Angela that he was having an affair with Angela's mother and is her biological father, and forces Angela to remember that she sacrificed Amy to him, shoving her older sister into Jingles's arms to save herself the night the rest of the Nelson family was slaughtered.  While Jingles is skimming through an occult book, Angela escapes her bonds, and stabs him in the mouth, causing him to fall on and crush the doll that was keeping him alive. In the morning, Angela is found by the authorities, placed in the back of a car, and screams that they have to destroy Jingles's damaged doll, which laughs at her when a [[Forensic science|CSI]] walks past with it.

The Joneses
 Kate, Steve, Mick, and Jenn Jones move into an upscale suburb under the pretense of being a typical family relocating because of the changing nature of Kate's and Steve's careers. In reality, Kate is the leader of a team of [[undercover marketing|stealth marketers]], professional salespeople who disguise [[product placement]] as a daily routine.<ref name="cast" /> Their clothing, accessories, furniture, and even food are carefully planned and stocked by various companies to create visibility in a desirable consumer market. While Kate's team is highly effective, Steve is new to the team, Jenn is a closet [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] with a penchant for hitting on her fake fathers, and a 30-day review is fast approaching.   The team quickly ingratiates itself into the community, slowly shifting from displaying products to recommending them. Soon, local stores and businesses are stocking products based on the Joneses' trend-setting styles. However, at the end of the 30-day review, Steve discovers that he has the lowest sales numbers of the team, and Kate's job is endangered unless he can get his numbers up before the next review in 60 days. Eventually, Steve begins to find a sales tactic that works by playing on the fears of his neighbors and sympathizing with their dull, repetitive, unfulfilled careers. As someone who is frustrated with his job and disconnected from his fake "family," Steve turned to their products to keep himself entertained. When he recognizes this same pattern in his neighbors, his sales begin to steadily increase as he starts pitching products as the solution for suburban boredom and generating product "buzz" through unwitting ropers.  The team's dynamics become more complicated when Kate applies herself to the technique as well. Realizing that they can boost sales by perfecting their fake family dynamic to sell the image of a lifestyle, the lines between acting and reality start to break down. Things also get more complicated when Mick finds himself growing closer to an unpopular girl at the high school, Naomi ([[Christine Evangelista]]), in whom he can confide, while Jenn's flirtation with Alex Bayner ([[Robert Pralgo]]) (one of the men in the neighborhood) raises the suspicions of the neighbors. The team's cover is almost blown at several times: once when an old acquaintance of Steve's recognizes him at a restaurant, again when Jenn's indiscretions nearly expose her real age, and after a party where Mick markets alcohol to minors.  Eventually, each member of the team finds that the constant pretense slowly erodes their individual desires. Jenn's dreams of running away with a rich, older man come to a close when she realizes that she was being used by Alex. Mick has a crisis of conscience when Naomi gets into a car accident after drinking too much of a [[wine cooler]] that the family was marketing to teens. Worse, when he makes a pass at Naomi's brother, he punches Mick in rage.   After creating nearly record-breaking numbers, Steve is offered the chance to join an "icon" unit alone. He refuses, knowing that this is Kate's dream and because he believes that the "family" can do it together. When Steve's closest friend in the community, Larry ([[Gary Cole]]), reveals that he's going to lose his house because he's overextended his credit, Steve tries again to see if Kate wants something more than a pretend marriage. She rebuffs him, and the next day Steve discovers to his horror that Larry has committed suicide over the debts. Grief-stricken, Steve confesses to the community about the real nature of his job. With their covers blown, the rest of the Joneses leave quickly and are reassigned to a new home. Steve refuses the offer to join an icon cell and tracks the family down to their new location. There, he reunites with Kate and tries one last time to convince her to leave. Though hesitant she follows him out of town and agrees to meet his family in [[Arizona]].

Sayo realizes the error of her ways, and destroys the Stone of the Earth, freeing Yusuke from its control as Shadow Moon decides to finish them off himself. Before Shadow Moon could move in for the kill after defeating Decade and Kuuga, however, the unexpected arrival of [[Kamen Rider Double (character)|Kamen Rider Double]] (Shotaro Hidari & Phillip) tips the scales as he takes out Shadow Moon on their own before taking his leave, pinning Shadow Moon into the castle. All of the other Riders join Decade in an All Rider Kick, destroying Shadow Moon and the Dai-Shocker castle. The resulting shock awakens King Dark as Diend arrives with Kamen Rider J. Using the Decadriver Final FormRide card, he turns Decade into the Jumbo Decadriver which then turns J into Decade Complete Form Jumbo Formation and he destroys King Dark with a variation of the Dimension Kick, using the other Riders as giant Kamen Ride Cards.

The film is described as the  and was originally subtitled .<ref name="Oh141">''Figure Oh'' No. 141, November 2009</ref>  In the final portion of the film entitled , a convergence of the two films that brings the casts and characters of ''Decade'' and ''W'' to finish the fight with Super Shocker together.  All parts are directed by Ryuta Tasaki.  ===''Decade: The Last Story''=== Accepting his fate as the destroyer of Worlds, Tsukasa has been fighting Kamen Riders, carding the search group of [[Skyrider (Kamen Rider)|Skyrider]], [[Kamen Rider Super-1 (character)|Super-1]], and [[Kamen Rider Kabuto (character)|Kabuto]], before running into a group of Riotroopers under Yusuke. Elsewhere, Daiki Kaito visits the Hikari Studio, convincing Natsumi to destroy Tsukasa's camera and photos, as they are only bittersweet memories of what used to be. By then, Decade's fight with [[Kamen Rider J]] enters their dimension as he uses [[Kamen Rider G4]]'s Gigant and the [[Kamen Rider Kaixa#Side Basshar|Side Basshar]] to card J. Confronted by the Riotroopers, a young girl named Yuriko Misaki arrives and becomes [[Electro-Wave Human Tackle]] to take down the Riotroopers. She follows Tsukasa as he runs into Natsumi and Yusuke, who intends to stop Decade regardless of his injuries from the aftermath of Kamen Rider J's destruction. After explaining that he merely accepted his mission, Natsumi wants Tsukasa to remember who he was. However, Tsukasa throws his camera because he has no memories on Natsumi then fled. Natsumi feels powerless until Kivala arrives to remind Natsumi of Narutaki's words that only she can defeat Decade, offering her power to ensure it.  Meanwhile, in another part of this A.R. World, Eijiro Hikari visits a roadside food stand waiting for his friend [[List of Kamen Rider W characters#Ryubee Sonozaki|"Ryu"]] when he is served a squid and a beer by Narutaki. This triggers a [[Kamen Rider Decade: All Riders vs. Dai-Shocker|lost memory]], resulting in his forced transformation into Super Doctor Shinigami. With Narutaki becoming Colonel Zol, he and Super Shinigami form Super Shocker from the remaining members of Dai-Shocker as they intend to take advantage of the dwindling number of Kamen Riders with the Neo Organism. Confronting Tsukasa at a warehouse, Daiki reveals that Yuriko was killed by Dai-Shocker's Bee Woman years ago, but Yuriko refuses to accept it as Kamen Riders Ryuki and Blade arrive. Using his Final Form Ride on Blade, Decade defeats Ryuki and then Blade as Yusuke arrives. Becoming Ultimate Kuuga, he battles Decade with the intent on killing him by becoming the [[Kamen Rider Kuuga (Decade)#Ultimate Kuuga Gouram|Ultimate Kuuga Gouram]] to attempt a suicide attack before being defeated. Arriving, Natsumi uses Kivala to transform into Kamen Rider Kivala to fight Decade, only to be shocked when he allows her to run him through his Decadriver. He then gives Natsumi the Rider Cards, asking her to remember them before he dies.  Daiki arrives as he and Natsumi are teleported to Wataru Kurenai, who reveals that Decade's roles as the destroyer and the connector have been fulfilled, restoring all of the A.R. Worlds, stating that their "stories" have been restored because by Decade fighting and destroying them, he created memories that allowed their stories to continue. Natsumi asks about Tsukasa, Wataru says that Decade has no story and no longer has an existence as he served his purpose. Natsumi and Daiki return to her reality and decide to try to bring Tsukasa back, only that Tsukasa never took a picture of himself. But when Natsumi remembers the photo she took of Tsukasa, they try to find his camera when Super Shocker arrives to bring Natsumi to Super Shinigami; Daiki and Yusuke hold off the Army to allow Natsumi to find the camera before being ambushed by the Bee Woman as Tackle arrives to drive off the Inhumanoid with her risky Ultra Cyclone attack before fading away. Wounded, the Bee Woman limps back to Super Shocker's base where she releases the Neo Organism, only to be consumed by it as it creates Doras to Super Shinigami's horror.  Natsumi tries to develop the photographs, but the camera was in such bad shape that Tsukasa's face does not appear. She holds it up, passing it to Daiki and Yusuke who also refuse to forget him. This act, as well as the other Nine Worlds' Kamen Riders, restores the photo as memories of Tsukasa represented by photographs manifest and merge, bringing Tsukasa back to life. By then, Super Crisis Fortress takes off as the Tsukasa, Yusuke, Daiki, and Natsumi arrive and assume their Rider forms to take out Colonel Zol's army, forcing the villain back to his usual self. However, Doras arrives as Narutaki curses Decade for causing this new turn of events. The Nine Worlds' Kamen Riders arrive to support them, but the fight is still to Doras's advantage until Decade assumes Complete Form while having the Nine Riders assume their ultimate forms (Kuuga Rising Ultimate, Agito Shining Form, Ryuki Survive, Faiz Blaster Form, Blade King Form, Armed Hibiki, Kabuto Hyper Form, Den-O Super Climax Form, and Kiva Emperor Form), and together destroy Doras with an all-out attack. However, wanting to play more, the Neo Organism sends out a [[mammoth]] robot to attack the Riders.  ===''W: Begins Night''=== It is the holiday season and Shotaro Hidari reminisces of the first Christmas he spent with his mentor, the great Sokichi Narumi, until Akiko Narumi breaks him out of his daydream so they can decorate the office, with the Futo Irregulars helping and Philip reading as usual. However, a woman arrives, revealed to be pop star Asami Mutsuki. She has come to the Narumi Detective Agency because she has been constantly haunted by the apparent ghost of her sister and pop star partner Erika who died in a boating accident a year ago. Shotaro takes the case to the Irregulars' dismay, with Philip intrigued as ghosts should not exist. The whole group investigates, with the Futo Irregulars hunting down clues in their own way, as Shotaro and Akiko visit Erika's grave and speak with the cemetery's caretaker Father Roberto Shijima, who Shotaro finds suspicious as he speaks of resurrection. As they leave as they get a call that Asami canceled the case, Shotaro and Akiko find Erika and pursue her before being attacked by the Death Dopant. After calling to Philip, Shotaro transforms into Kamen Rider Double to fight the Death Dopant who escapes with Double confronted by his old boss: Sokichi Narumi. Sokichi produces the Lost Driver belt and the Skull Memory, transforming into [[Kamen Rider Skull]]. Double and Skull fight, with Shotaro reluctant to fight his mentor and Philip reminding him that Sokichi should be dead as Akiko overheard it while Double is still taken down by Skull with the Skull Banisher Maximum Drive. With Shotaro reverting, Sokichi warns him not to investigate any further. After the police arrive to the Agency with information, Shotaro decides to quit the detective business while Akiko insists that he stay on the case. The next day, Shotaro goes to the last known resting place of Sokichi Narumi: the island where he and Philip first met. Philip is already there, having taken the HardSplasher, and tells Shotaro that if they are going to solve this case and find out why Sokichi is still alive, they must remember what happened on the night that he died: the Begins Night.  One year ago, Sokichi and Shotaro have infiltrated a top secret installation, seeking the "Chosen Child," whose powers were being used for evil. When the alarm sounds, Sokichi gives an attaché case to Shotaro and tells him not to move as he becomes Skull to fight off the guards as they all transform into Masquerade Dopants when the Taboo Dopant damages Sokichi's fedora in the fight. Elsewhere, Shotaro sees a young man and follows him, determining him to be the person they are after. The young man reveals that he creates the Gaia Memories via his access to the Gaia Library, and during the discussion, Shotaro drops the case revealing the Double Driver. The young man is intrigued with its design, remarking that it to be made for the  user to be able to access his power. However, after a short argument with Shotaro, he is inadvertently pushed into a transport device and is teleported into the crystalline structure of the Gaia Tower. Sokichi arrives and berates Shotaro for not listening to him, as they head upstairs to the central chamber of the Gaia Tower. Sokichi goes up to the crystal and enters the Gaia Library where he finds the young man, offering him the freedom to do as he wishes and also make amends for his part in the creation of the Gaia Memories. Learning he has no name, Sokichi christens him Philip, after [[Philip Marlowe|his favorite fictional character]]. After rescuing Philip from the tower, the building's guards shoot down Sokichi. In his last breath, he asks Shotaro to finish the case and take care of Philip, giving Shotaro his now ripped fedora. Shotaro feels he is at fault for his death when the Taboo Dopant arrives as he and Philip transform into Kamen Rider Double for the first time, before the floor they're on gives out and fall down several levels and the transformation ends soon after landing as Philip uses a tiny dinosaur-like robot called the Fang Memory to become the feral Kamen Rider Double FangJoker to take all the Masquerade Dopants and drive the Taboo Dopant off before picking up Shotaro's body and escaping as the building explodes.  Back in the present, after Philip tells him that only together could they atone from their respective sins, he and Shotaro resume their investigation on the Death Dopant, concluding it to be none other than Father Shijima. As they return to the main land, Akiko follows Asami to the cemetery and learns she canceled the case as the priest promised to reunite her with Erika. But learning they know his identity, Shijima attempts to lock them up in coffins along with the others he helped as Shotaro and Phillip arrive to save them. Assuming his Dopant form, Shijima disappears and Sokichi appears once more and assumes his Rider form, but Shotaro realizes that this man cannot be his old mentor due to his heartlessness. Once Kamen Rider Double defeats Skull as HeatJoker, Roberto's Dopant form is revealed to be the shape-shifting Dummy Dopant as he reveals his plan was to assume the identities of his high class victims. But before Double can execute a Memory Break, the Sonozaki sisters and Kirihiko arrive to fight Double in their Dopant forms as the Dummy Dopant transforms into a tire and escapes. Kamen Rider Double calls upon the RevolGarry and the HardBoilder to chase after the Dummy Dopant.  ===''Movie War 2010''=== After the Mammoth Mecha is dropped, Decade survives the attack and gets on the Machine Decader as he is chased by the Neo Organism-possessed Super Crisis Fortress as Kamen Rider Double pursues the Dummy Dopant in his Dummy Wheel form on the HardBoilder. Within moments, the two Rider's battles intermingle as Decade and Double [[Kamen Rider Decade: All Riders vs. Dai-Shocker|recognize each other]] and join forces as the other Kamen Riders join in the battle Decade uses the All Riders Final Form Ride Card to transform the Nine Worlds' Kamen Riders into their Final Form Ride Forms to support Diend and Kiva-la as Double gets the Dummy Dopant off the Mammoth Mecha and convert it into the HardMammother to take down the Super Crisis Fortress while Decade chases after the Dummy Dopant. As Double manages to destroy the Super Crisis Fortress at the expense of the HardMammother, Super Shinigami tries to escape when the ShinigamiHakase Memory, which was given by Ryubee Sonozaki who was called "Ryu" by Eijiro himself, falls out of his neck, turning him back into Eijiro Hikari. Kamen Rider Kiva-la rescues him and both escape the ship's destruction unharmed.  However, the Neo Organism has also escaped destruction and assimilates the Dummy Dopant to become Ultimate D. Decade and Double fight Ultimate D, having trouble until Decade produces the Kamen Rider W Final Form Ride Card. He uses it and splits Kamen Rider Double CycloneJoker into Double CycloneCyclone (controlled by Philip) and Double JokerJoker (controlled by Shotaro). Together, the three Kamen Riders perform the Triple Extreme Rider Kick and destroy Ultimate D. Soon after, as the other Riders take their leave, Tsukasa and Shotaro part ways after Tsukasa hands Shotaro a Kamen Ride card with Skull's image on it. Shotaro is then approached by a Sokichi Narumi from an A.R. World, who praises his determination before returning to his world. Tsukasa returns to the Hikari Studio where a new backdrop depicting an endless road falls as the others wish continue to journey with him. Tsukasa, Natsumi, Yusuke, and Daiki all pose in front of the backdrop as Eijiro takes a photo. In Futo, the party resumes at the Narumi Detective Agency, with Shotaro reassured of his task to follow through with his mentor's wishes. However, in another part of Futo, a mysterious young man named Ryu Terui proclaims that Double is no longer the only Kamen Rider in Futo as he holds up a red Gaia Memory which soon announces its name: [[Kamen Rider Accel|Accel]].

The Killing Room
 Four individuals sign up for a [[psychological research]] study only to discover that they are now subjects of a brutal, modern version of the [[Project MKULTRA]] [[indoctrination]] program.<ref name=room></ref> One by one, the subjects are brought into a large, white room, in which the tables and chairs have been bolted to the floor.  They are each given a questionnaire to fill out. In the meantime, a researcher enters the room, ostensibly to give an overview of the study. He indicates to the subjects—three men and a woman—that the study will take approximately eight hours to complete, at which time they will each be paid $250. Upon completing his introduction, the researcher shoots the female subject in the head with a gun and promptly leaves the room.  Over the next few hours, the remaining three male subjects will be subjected to additional physical and psychological brutality. Only one subject will survive the ordeal. This subject manages to escape into the building. The loudspeaker gives details of where the subject is in the building. It is then realized that the subject is going where he is supposed to be. He ends up in a room with two other males tied to their chairs. The loudspeaker then states that phase 2 is to begin.  It is revealed, during the last subject's escape attempt, that the goal of the covert program is to achieve in human civilians a phenomenon similar to [[apoptosis]] in [[Cell (biology)|cells]] (a comparison noted in the film), by developing "civilian weapons" akin to suicide bombers.

Kill Theory
 An unnamed man is sitting in a psychiatrist's office, being released from an insane asylum. His doctor, Dr. Karl Truftin (Don McManus), recaps how the man sacrificed his three friends during a mountain climbing expedition, cutting their climbing ropes in order to save himself. Although the man insists that anyone in his situation would have made the decision to kill to survive, the doctor explains that due to good behaviour and evident remorse over causing the deaths, the man is to be set free with regular psychiatric evaluation.   Meanwhile, Brent ([[Teddy Dunn]]) is travelling to his father's lakehouse with his girlfriend Amber (Ryanne Duzich), other couples Michael ([[Patrick Flueger]]) and Jennifer ([[Agnes Bruckner]]), Carlos ([[Theo Rossi]]) and Nicole (Steffi Wickens), as well as their friend Freddy ([[Daniel Franzese]]). Upon arriving they are surprised to find Brent's step-sister Alex ([[Taryn Manning]]) has been living there. Brent and Alex argue, however the others convince Brent to let her stay. After settling in, Amber refers to an unspecified event that implies she and Michael were intimate at one point, however Michael brushes off the topic quickly. The group party and drink into the night until everyone goes to bed. Carlos and Nicole decide to sleep outside on the porch. Carlos, being heavily intoxicated, passes out immediately. When Nicole goes into the kitchen to get a drink, she is attacked by an unknown man.   Sometime later, Nicole's body is thrown through a window onto Freddy who alerts the others with his screams. The group panic before noticing the word 'TV' cut into Nicole's stomach. After turning on the TV, the group view a video of Nicole being handed a loaded gun and told to shoot Carlos in order to survive. Nicole refuses and instead turns the gun on her attacker who overpowers her and slits her throat. The unseen man then explains to the group through a walkie-talkie that come 6 a.m. only one member of the group should be alive or they will all die.The man also explains that Nicole was given the same option as they are, kill to survive, however she failed. Collectively the group decide to barricade themselves into the house, realizing their phones do not work. Carlos decides to make a run toward the boat to retrieve a gun placed in the keybox. Brent follows him and they find the boat has been sunk, but Brent is able to retrieve the gun anyway. Noticing a nearby axe, Carlos runs to get it, but is caught in a giant bear trap. Brent begins to help him, however after hearing someone approach from the trees nearby he leaves Carlos and returns to the house, telling the others that Carlos has been killed.  While Freddy begins to become hysterical over their situation, a bandaged up Carlos makes it to the house. Although barely conscious, Carlos is able to tell Jennifer that Brent had left him. Jennifer manages to knock the gun out of Brent's hand and gives it to Michael, no longer trusting Brent. The group decide they have to try and leave in the van in order to get Carlos to a hospital despite Brent's protests and expectation that the van will be rigged to explode. Alex leaves the house and successfully brings the van to the front door of the house, allowing everyone to get in. However, while driving away from the house, road spikes blow all of the tires. The unnamed man quickly shoots rigged balloons of gasoline which spill over the van before telling the group that there is no escape and that they need to sacrifice one person in the next 60 seconds or they will all be burned alive. Brent pushes the wounded Carlos out of the van where he is shot in the head.  The group panic; Brent deserts Amber by running into the forest, leaving her to return to the house with Michael, Jennifer and Freddy. Alex attempts to escape on her motorbike however is nearly shot when attempting to do so, instead fleeing towards the lake. While Brent runs through the forest he is attacked by the killer, only spared due to his promise to kill someone else. Brent then attacks Alex, drowning her in the lake. He quickly returns to the house and convinces Freddy to get the gun off of Michael by lying to him saying that they could both escape on the boat. Freddy retrieves the gun from Michael but eventually shoots Brent after realizing he was lying about the boat and was going to shoot everyone. Freddy then forces Amber to leave the house before attempting to do the same to Michael and Jennifer. Michael tries to reason with the hysterical Freddy, but Brent soon stabs Freddy through the head with a fire poker, having survived being shot. Michael and Jennifer run into the basement but are then cornered by Brent. As Brent prepares to shoot them both, Amber returns and bludgeons him to death with a spade. Michael and Jennifer go back upstairs, leaving Amber in shock in the basement. Eventually she finds a gun planted by the killer in her bag and reluctantly draws it on Jennifer who has the other gun. The two girls get into an argument over Michael, with Amber confessing her love for him. Jennifer shoots Amber in the stomach,  much to Michaels shock.  Realizing it is nearly 6 a.m. and the killer is approaching the house, Michael and Jennifer escape into the basement with an unconscious Amber. In the basement they hide and attempt to shoot the killer when he comes downstairs, however it is revealed to be Alex, having survived her attack from Brent earlier. Alex quickly dies from the gunshot wound before Jennifer turns on Michael in desperation, stabbing him in the stomach. Michael tells Jennifer he would have died for her, but before she can kill him Amber attacks Jennifer and strangles her to death. Amber crawls next to Michael, intent on staying with him until the end. As the clock chimes six and the man approaches, Michael kills himself in order to save Amber. As the man passes, Amber says she'll never be like him, and though he expresses skepticism, he leaves her alive and departs from the house.  The killer leaves a voice mail in the psychiatrist's office, saying he's proved his theory that desperate people would resort to murder and the camera pans along a photograph to reveal Brent was the doctor's son. The killer laughs and says he's now found closure.

After the gangsters fire a shot at Killer Bean and miss, Killer Bean ends up killing every one of the gangsters. The last bean killed is revealed to be the nephew of Cappuccino, a  mob boss.<ref></ref>  The police, led by Detective Cromwell, investigate the warehouse shootings. The warehouse is known to be owned by Cappuccino. As the police investigate, Vagan, a lieutenant of Cappuccino arrives at the warehouse. After discovering the massacre, Vagan, who runs guns for Cappuccino, quickly informs his boss what has happened and that Cappuccino is Killer Bean's next target. Due to Killer Bean's skill, Vagan suggests hiring mercenary soldiers to kill him.  Killer Bean receives an encrypted call from his boss warning him that he is being reckless and that the attack on the warehouse should have never happened, and that only the "target" should be killed. Killer Bean ensures his boss that the mission will succeed. Killer Bean goes to another of Cappuccino's warehouses but instead finds Vagan there, who attempts to kill him. The fight between Vagan and Killer Bean ends as a draw. Vagan leaves a note to Killer Bean which reads, "Shadow Bean, you are too late".  Killer Bean later goes to a bar across the street where Detective Cromwell finds him. Cromwell suggests they work together to bring Cappuccino down, but Killer Bean refuses his help. Later, Cromwell finds the note referencing the "Shadow Beans". After a call to police intelligence, Cromwell discovers that the Shadow Beans were a private organization that carried out secret government operations, but disbanded years ago.  Killer Bean locates a third warehouse, evidently attempting to find Cappuccino there. After killing the gangsters there, Killer Bean is confronted by mercenaries hired by Vagan. The mercenaries fail, but afterwards Vagan is able to capture Killer Bean. Cappuccino interrogates Killer Bean asking him why he wants to kill him, but receives no answers. Killer Bean escapes, and then reveals that he is not after Cappuccino, but rather after Vagan. Cappuccino is then shot by Vagan. Killer Bean explains that he has been sent to kill Vagan, a former Shadow Bean whose code name is Dark Bean. Dark Bean had betrayed the Shadow Agency and had stolen their secret database. Dark Bean then explains that the Shadow Agency had degenerated from an honorable agency into simply guns for hire, and that he was ordered to supply weapons to criminals. Dark Bean claims to have left the Shadow Agency and run guns for Cappuccino so that he could be knowledgeable of all weapon transfers, and thus could fight crime. Killer Bean doesn't believe him, and kills Dark Bean as he attempts to shoot Killer Bean first.  Detective Cromwell witnesses the entire fight, and orders the entire police department to capture Killer Bean. Killer Bean gives up, assuming that only the police can protect him from the Shadow Agency, and presumably because he would have to kill police officers. Meanwhile, the Shadow Agency has dispatched another Shadow Bean named Jet Bean to kill Killer Bean. Jet Bean, an assassin from the east, is one of the Shadow Agency's top Shadow Beans.  Killer Bean is taken to prison, but Jet Bean manages to kill every police officer and find him in his cell. Killer Bean explains to Jet Bean that the Shadow Agency has gone criminal, but Jet Bean doesn't believe him. In the last fight scene, Killer Bean kills Jet Bean with much effort. Killer Bean then contacts the Shadow Agency on Jet Bean's cell phone, and they suggest Killer Bean come in to "talk things over". Killer Bean says he will come in, but it won't be for talk. The film ends with Killer Bean finding a cache of police weapons, and driving off to confront the Shadow Agency.

He leads them out to his truck pretending to get  money and instead grabs a metal rod from the back of his truck and attacks them.  After knocking the gun out of Richie's hand and knocking Blackbird down Wayne chases Richie back into the building. Richie pulls one of his boots off to get his other gun and shoots at Wayne a few times before Wayne throws the metal rod at him and tackles him, knocking him out the window and crashing into a gazebo. They flee, but the Colsons have seen Blackbird, a man that no one is supposed to see.  Blackbird and Richie pay a visit to Lionel Adam, a local man and fellow Indian tribesman of Blackbird (played by actor Aldred Montoya) who Blackbird had once seen with Wayne. They go duck hunting in the local marshes while Blackbird presses Lionel for Wayne's whereabouts before killing him. They stay the night at the house of Nix's girlfriend Donna. The next day they show up outside of the Colsons' house planning to kill them.  Before they can move out of the woods Wayne takes off in his truck after fighting with Carmen.

Because of the situation with Blackbird and the mafia the Colsons are put in [[Witness Protection]] services.  Blackbird and Richie figure out the Colsons have gone to Missouri by tricking Carmen's mother into giving Richie their new phone number. Rather than go after them in Missouri Blackbird fakes his and Richie's death by digging up his little brother's body and burning it in a car so that the DNA test would show that the body was related to his brother in prison. With the FBI thinking Blackbird is dead the Colsons no longer need protection and are allowed to return home. Before Blackbird and Richie leave Donna's house to kill the Colsons, Richie shoots Donna out of jealousy because she and Blackbird were getting along too well. When Carmen returns ahead of Wayne she finds Richie and Blackbird waiting.  While Carmen is a hostage, Richie torments her; he sprays her with buck lure. Blackbird tells her she will feel better if she washes herself off. When she comes out of the bathroom in her underwear Richie puts a bullet in her mouth and she spits it on the floor. While they wait for Wayne to come home they sit at the dinner table while Blackbird eats.

As he runs back to his truck Blackbird bursts out the front door and starts shooting at him. Wayne manages to take cover behind his car and get his shotgun. They exchange fire for a bit before Blackbird hits Wayne with one of his shots. As Blackbird moves in for the killshot, he pauses and turns around to see Carmen pointing Richie's gun at him. Blackbird thinks it is empty because he took the bullets out of it so he doesn't react to the threat, forgetting the one bullet she spit out of her mouth earlier. While Blackbird is distracted by Carmen, Wayne crawls to his shotgun and he and Carmen shoot Blackbird dead at the same time. Wayne and Carmen hug each other outside their house as a pool of blood forms under Blackbird.

Kings of Pastry
 The film features [[Jacquy Pfeiffer]], Regis Lazard, Philippe Rigollot, and [[Sébastien Canonne]], M.O.F. and begins at the [[French Pastry School]] in [[Chicago]], where Pfeiffer prepares for the 2007 competition. While there, the school's co-founder and fellow teacher, Chef Cannone, a previous winner, serves as Pfeiffer's mentor. The theme of this year's competition is marriage, and the competition requires that all competitors create a wedding buffet consisting of a wedding cake, a chocolate sculpture, a sugar sculpture, cream puffs, chocolate candies, breakfast pastries and jam, tea pastries, a restaurant-style dessert plate, and a small sculpture (known as the "bijou") to commemorate the competition.<ref name=autogenerated2></ref> Everything in the buffet, with the exception of the bijou, must be made from scratch and assembled in front of the  judges over a three-day period.<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Keeping in mind that the presentation of his buffet will be judged on par with its taste, Pfeiffer works to develop close to forty recipes that are as visually exquisite as they are delicious.  Once his recipes and training regiment are established, Pfeiffer returns to his childhood home in [[Alsace]] where he adjusts his recipes to account for the nuances in French-quality baking ingredients.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> He is aware that the differences between French and American ingredients can affect the structure of his pastries as well as their taste. For example, French butter tends to have a higher fat and lower water content than American butter, and that slight variation can cause tremendous chemical complications in the baking process.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> While Pfeiffer is prepared to adjust his recipes, he does not foresee the timing challenges that will require him to rapidly revise his wedding cake and sugar sculpture in time for the fast-approaching competition.  While in France, the film introduces two other competing chefs, Regis Lazard and Philippe Rigollot. Lazard, who worked at Gerard Cayotte's patisserie in [[Luxembourg]], is coached by the pastry chef for French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. This is his second time competing. Rigollot is the pastry chef at the renowned Valence restaurant, Maison Pic, which is the only three-star restaurant in France owned by a woman. This is Rigollot's first time competing.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Shortly after the 2007 competition, Rigollot opened his own pastry shop in [[Annecy]], Pâtisserie Philippe Rigollot.  Following the preparation period, the film continues on to Lyon for the final competition. Over the course of three grueling days, the sixteen finalists meticulously assemble their buffets under the constant scrutiny of the judges, among whom are world-renowned pastry chefs [[Jacques Torres]], Pascal Niau, and [[Pierre Herme]]. Since the contestants are critiqued not only on the taste and artistic quality of their buffet but on their workmanship as well, the judges let no detail of the process go unnoticed. They inspect the chefs' work spaces for signs of messiness, going as far as to examine the chefs' aprons for fingerprints, and their waste-bins for discarded surplus.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Their ubiquitous presence does little to ease the contestants' anxiety, and instead, the chefs' mounting stress threatens the stability of their alarmingly delicate sugar sculptures. As the final day of the competition draws to a close, and the contestants race to finish their buffets, the panic among them swells, and more than one chef and delicacy buckle under the pressure.  Philippe Rigollot's sugar sculpture collapses in the kitchen, devastating him and saddening the MOF judges, but he decides to soldier on and earns an MOF through high marks in the other categories. The other two main characters are not selected for the title. Jacquy Pfeiffer plans to take the test again and marries his girlfriend. Regis Lazard's future regarding MOF is not certain.  Pfeiffer opted not to take the exam again in 2011.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/pov/kingsofpastry/film_update.php]</ref>

Knowing (film)
  In 1959, Lucinda Embry hears whispers while staring at the Sun. When her idea to make a [[time capsule]] is chosen by the school, each child draws what they believe that the future will look like. Lucinda writes a page of seemingly random numbers for the time capsule, which is to be opened in fifty years. Lucinda's teacher calls for the pupils to finish, but Lucinda continues until her teacher takes the page off her desk unfinished. Lucinda goes missing after the time capsule is dedicated, and is found in a utility closet, scratching numbers into the door with her fingernails bleeding.   In 2009, Caleb Koestler is attending the same elementary school where Lucinda used to go. When the time capsule is opened, Caleb is supposed to read and write about some of the capsule's contents. He is given Lucinda's page of numbers. His widowed father, John, an [[astrophysics]] professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], notices that the numbers have a set of sequences, with digits referring to the dates and death tolls of disasters over the last fifty years, including 911012996, representing the date and death toll of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The last three sets of digits on the page are dated in the immediate future.  In the following days, a car drives by the family home, containing two strangers. They give Caleb a small black stone.   John witnesses a plane crash on a [[freeway]] on the day that the paper predicted that a disaster would occur. He unsuccessfully tries to save several victims. He then learns that the remaining unexplained digits on the paper are the geographic coordinates of the location of each disaster predicted on the paper. Caleb has a vision of one of the strangers in his bedroom. He looks through the window and sees the forest outside his room ablaze, with animals running from the fire.  [[File:Ezekiel's vision.jpg|thumb|250px|Copy of Matthäus Merian’s engraving of Ezekiel’s “chariot vision” (1670).]] John meets Lucinda's daughter, Diana, and her granddaughter, Abby. After hearing about the events that happened, Diana becomes apprehensive and scared. John then gives up his son to his sister. Soon afterward, a major derailment occurs on the [[New York City Subway]], which John fails to prevent. Diana then believes John and visits him. She says that her mother used to hear voices, and that the next and last date in the document, October 19, was the day Lucinda always said Diana would die. Searching Lucinda's mobile home, they find pictures of the disasters she predicted, a copy of [[Matthäus Merian]]'s engraving of [[Merkabah mysticism|Ezekiel's "chariot vision"]], and a pile of small smooth stones near Lucinda's bed. The last number in the document appears at first to be "33", but they notice that it is really "EE" written backward. They determine that EE means "Everyone Else", representing an [[Extinction event|Extinction Level Event]].  The next day, Abby shows John that she has colored in the sun on the Ezekiel's "Chariot vision" engraving. After seeing the image, John gets a revelation as he realizes that this could be how the world will end. He rushes them to the [[Haystack Observatory|MIT observatory]], where he discovers that a [[Superflare|massive solar flare]] will soon reach [[Earth]], making it virtually [[Planetary habitability|uninhabitable]]. John and Diana debate over how to prepare for the solar flare. Diana leaves with both children. As Diana stops at a nearby gas station, an emergency broadcast is transmitted to alert the world of the solar flare. While Diana is on the phone with John, the strangers take the children. Diana chases after them, but her car is hit by a truck. John, rushing to catch up with them, arrives just as Diana dies, and finds the black stone in Diana's hand. He goes back to Lucinda's mobile home, finding the children and the strangers waiting in a dry river bed covered with similar black stones. A space ship descends from the sky. John is denied entry, and the ship departs with the children. Many similar space ships leave the Earth.  The next morning, John drives to his estranged father's home. John and his family embrace as the flare ignites the Earth, killing all life on the surface. Caleb and Abby are deposited by the beings on an Earth-like planet.

Salma ([[Nauheed Cyrusi]]), Avantika's neighbour, is effectively being confined in her own home by her husband Haqil. She manages to inform Avantika about the situation and requests her to contact Rehana ([[Dia Mirza]]), a friend and TV reporter. Avantika meets with Rehana and her boyfriend Riyaz ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), a Muslim American war journalist who has just arrived from Iraq. Together they discuss Salma's problem and the trio conclude that Salma is probably the victim of domestic violence. Rehana plans a meeting with Salma, but is unable to meet her since she is leaving to Iraq, as part of a United Nations envoy.  Avantika is over joyed to learn that she is pregnant. While waiting for Ehsaan, she takes a walk around her street. Over hearing voices, she decides to investigate, and finds out that a group of men from her neighborhood, lead by the elder Bhaijaan ([[Om Puri]]), are planning a mission. They aim to bomb the plane that Rehana is travelling in, since it is carrying a large group of diplomats and media personnel. Avantika realises that they are part of a terrorist group and also comes across Salma's dead body. The men see her and chase her to her house, where she meets Ehsaan. At first he consoles her, but soon reveals that he is also a part of the terrorist group. Avantika realizes that she is nothing but a pawn in Ehsaan’s game - he married her to legitimately obtain [[Permanent residence (United States)|residency]] in the United States.  Bhaijaan asks Ehsaan to kill Avantika since she is now a liability, but after learning that she is pregnant, Ehsaan decides not to. Ehsaan keeps Avantika captive in their home and threatens to kill her father in India if she tries to inform anyone of what she knows. Avantika manages to make a phone call, and calls Rehana in order to warn her. The call goes to voice mail and it is too late, Rehana has already boarded the flight and the bomb has already been planted. The plane explodes, killing Rehana and all others on board.  A heartbroken Riyaz finds Avantika's voice message for Rehana, and begins his own quest to uncover the real culprits behind the flight bombing. Going undercover, Riyaz joins Ehsaan's lectures and soon befriends him. Avantika and the other wives of the group are watched over by Aapa ([[Kirron Kher]]), Bhaijaan's wife. Aapa explains the reasons for Jihad to Avantika, and also reveals that Eshaan was a [[Pakistani]] man with no political ideology, until his first wife and son were killed by American bombs. Riyaz engages in a passionate debate with other students regarding the topic of Islam, and Eshaan is impressed. While trying to dispose of Salma's decomposing body, Hakil and Eshaan attract the attention of police. Eshaan kills Hakil and the surrounding policemen, and sets the car on fire. Salma's partially burnt body is found, and the FBI distributes pictures of her in order to learn her identity.  Ehsaan finds Riyaz to be a perfect replacement for Hakil. Ehsaan introduces Riyaz to Bhaijaan, who is initially suspicious of the new recruit. He tests Riyaz by ordering him to shoot at a random man serving at a fast food counter. Riyaz is reluctant but follows through, however it turns out there was no bullet in the gun thus leaving the man unharmed. Having passed the test, Ehsaan makes Riyaz a part of their next mission to bomb several subway stations in New York.  Riyaz and Avantika begin to work together to foil the plan and bring down the terrorist group. Riyaz sets up a meeting with the FBI for the next day but his plan is derailed when one of the men sees Salma's picture, and Bhaijaan decides to bring the date of the mission forward.  The group go ahead with their plan - the women travel together with Aapa and the men have three bombs between them, to be detonated at separate stations. While on the subway, Riyaz's colleague bumps into him and accidentally reveals his real identity to Ehsaan and Bhaijaan. Riyaz tries to escape and, in the chaos, shoots Bhaijaan. Before dying, Bhaijaan informs Ehsaan that there are three more bombs, which were placed in the bags of the women, unknown to them. One bomb is with Avantika, who is being escorted by Aapa. Realising that both Avantika and his unborn child will die, Eshaan decides to let Riyaz go, and sets out to find Avantika.  Riyaz informs the FBI of the situation and they rush to each station, trying to find both the men and women. They are able to safely retrieve the explosives from the women, while the men detonate their bombs. Ehsaan kills Aapa in order to free Avantika, and he admits that he loves her and asks her to take care of their child. Eshaan manages to disarm the last bomb, but is fatally wounded as he escapes from three policemen who were chasing him. Before leaving, Avantika asks Ehsaan what his real name is, which he reveals to be Khalid. As she leaves the train, she hears the gunshot of Ehsaan killing himself.

The [[Funeral director|mortician]] appears, and is impaled by a man equipped with a chrome skull mask, and a shoulder mounted camera. The girl stabs ChromeSkull in the eye, and runs off while he treats his wound. The girl is picked up by Tucker, who takes her home to his wife Cindy, and promises her that they will go to the sheriff's station in the morning, as Tucker's truck is low on gas, and their phone service has been cut off.  ChromeSkull tracks the girl (who has been nicknamed "Princess") to Tucker's house, and kills Cindy. Tucker and Princess escape in Tucker's truck as ChromeSkull deals with Cindy's brother Johnny and his girlfriend, who had come by to check on Cindy. Tucker and Princess seek aid from a recluse named Steven, who uses his computer to email for help, and research ChromeSkull, discovering he is a [[serial killer]] whose [[modus operandi]] is to send tapes of himself murdering women to the authorities.

Princess smashes the camera in frustration, and while struggling with ChromeSkull, knocks his mask off. ChromeSkull goes to reaffix his mask, unknowingly using the Cyanoacrylate that Steven had replaced his adhesive with. The chemical melts ChromeSkull's face, and as he writhes in agony, Princess bludgeons him with an aluminum bat.

The police arrive, and find the flyer, which Princess had written an explanation on the back of.  
LaMB
 ''LaMB'' takes place in the distant future on a desert planet called Cerra. The story features a prison system, in which prisoners are sealed in personal containment systems known as "laminated suits" and used for labor. Prisoners go through a "Lamination" process, where they are fitted with cybernetic, laminated skin-tight suits. In these suits, they can move around and completed work assignments that cannot be done by machine or robots. Law-abiding citizens are protected, while the criminals become members of society in a futuristic prison system. This process ensures that convicted criminals remain productive members in a system of virtual slavery. The story encompasses the dichotomy between the theory and practice of a futuristic society's justice system.  The lamination process and system of virtual slavery has made both jails and the death penalty obsolete in a world where human ingenuity, creativity, and labor continue to be precious commodities that cannot be replaced by robots or any form of artificial intelligence. The system also sparks off philosophical debates among citizens presenting pros and cons of the ethical feasibility of "Lamination".<ref></ref>  The story follows protagonists Sara Integra and Jack Griswold's struggle against Cerra's system of imprisonment. Major Sara Integra is a former weapons specialist in bio-weapons division. While she was on a military assignment, innocent lives were lost during an experiment gone wrong. She was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 200 years encased in a laminated suit. Sara forever became known as Eve, or Eve1135.  When she became a LaMB, Eve was assigned a Shepherd. Shepherds control the actions and movement of the LaMBs. Included among the laws of society are that LaMBs must only act upon instructions of their Shepherds. While LaMBs can hear others, they cannot speak, nor can they touch another human being unless ordered by their Shepherd. Dr. Jack Griswold was assigned to be Eve's Shepherd.   Griswold is a scientist from another planet, specializing in advanced botanical engineering. He has been assigned the task to restore vegetation to the dry, desert planet. Among Griswold's superiors is Keiko Suzuki, Chief Scientific Advisor specializing in biophysics, and Sara Integra's niece. She has been deeply affected by the death of her parents, and her aunt's imprisonment, and lamination and has made revenge her ultimate goal in life.   Griswold tends to display workaholic traits, presumably in order to forget the recent loss of his wife. His curiosity and soul-searching thirst to understand the complexities of the universe drives his research.

Griswold inadvertently gets pulled into the politics and ethics behind the system of "Lamination", as well as a romance with Eve.  Keiko's anti-LaMB organization and conspiracy is discovered, and she is put into a lamb suit. Due to recent developments in technology her suit is part plant possibly. She goes on a rampage and tries to destroy Eve1135, but she is immobilized by touching Griswold while she attacked him. She loses her balance and falls off the building. Eve1135 is eventually released from prison (possibly hundreds of years later) and she is just Sara Integra and she kisses Griswold after they put flowers on his wife's grave.

Land of the Lost (film)
 Pompous [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Rick Marshall has a low-level job at the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], three years after a disastrous interview with [[Matt Lauer]] of ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' became a [[viral video]] and ruined his career. [[Doctorate|Doctoral candidate]] Holly Cantrell tells him that his [[fringe science|controversial theories]] combining [[time warp (science fiction)|time warps]] and paleontology inspired her. She shows him a fossil with an imprint of a cigarette lighter that he recognizes as his own along with a crystal made into a necklace that gives off strong [[tachyon]] energy. She convinces him to finish his tachyon amplifier and come help her on a seemingly routine expedition to the cave where Holly found the fossil, which is in the middle of nowhere. With cave gift shop owner Will Stanton they raft into the cave, where Marshall has detected high levels of tachyons. He activates the tachyon amplifier, triggering an earthquake that opens a time warp into which the raft falls. The group finds themselves in a desert, filled with various items from many eras, and without the amplifier. They rescue a primate-like creature, Cha-Ka of the Pakuni tribe, who becomes their friend and guide.  The gang spends a night in a cave after surviving a meeting with a fast, intelligent [[Tyrannosaurus]] they nickname "Grumpy", who stalks Marshall for calling him stupid.  Marshall receives a telepathic message begging for help and finds himself in ancient ruins. The group encounters a race of [[List of reptilian humanoids|lizard men]] called Sleestaks before meeting the one who sent Marshall the telepathic message, Enik the Altrusian. He explains that he was exiled by the evil Zarn who is attempting to take over Earth with his Sleestak minions, but Enik can prevent this if Marshall retrieves the tachyon amplifier.  The group stumble upon a desert where many things from across time end up and they encounter many [[Compsognathus]], [[Dromaeosaurs]], Grumpy, and a female [[Allosaurus]]. The Allosaurus and Grumpy battle it out over a previously killed ice-cream seller until they sense Marshall and chase him. Marshall kills the Allosaurus with [[liquid nitrogen]] and finds that the amplifier was eaten by the Allosaurus. The amplifier is then stolen by a [[Pteranodon]] and taken to its nest. The group arrives at the nest and Marshall lightly steps through the Pteranodon eggs to retrieve the amplifier, but when he reaches it, it stops broadcasting the soundtrack to Marshall's favorite musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]''. When the eggs begin to hatch, Holly realizes that the music was acting as a sort of lullaby keeping the baby Pteranodons asleep. Marshall, Will and Holly belt out "[[I Hope I Get It]]", with Cha-ka inexplicably joining in, displaying an impressive singing voice.  Marshall, Will and Cha-ka celebrate their good fortune. Meanwhile, Holly pockets a dinosaur egg and learns from a recording left by the long-deceased Zarn that Enik deceived them and he is actually the one planning to invade Earth. But she is captured by the Sleestaks to be brought to the Library of Skulls for judgment. The others save her from being executed for helping Enik, but the villainnow possessing the amplifier, and mind-controlling the Sleestaksleaves them to open a portal to Earth. Marshall pole vaults into Grumpy's mouth and after removing an intestinal blockage, befriends him. He joins the others to defeat the Sleestak army and confront Enik. After the crystal link between the Land of the Lost and Earth is shattered, Enik reveals the portal will close forever. Thinking fast, Marshall grabs Holly's crystal and inserts it into the port, knowing that the substitute crystal won't hold for long. Will chooses to stay behind to live a better life and to prevent Enik from following Marshall and Holly back to Earth, learning later that female Pakuni are very attractive.  A triumphant Marshall again appears on ''Today'' with the dinosaur egg Holly brought back to promote his new book ''Matt Lauer Can Suck It''. The egg left behind on the ''Today'' set hatches a baby Sleestak, which hisses as the screen goes black.

Krug shows Justin a local newspaper that has Krug and Sadie's pictures on the front page, and which explains how Sadie and Francis broke Krug out of police custody and killed the two officers that were transporting him.

When he is done, Mari musters enough strength to escape the group and make it to the lake so that she can swim to safety. Before she can swim far enough, Krug shoots her in the back, leaving her body floating in the lake.  A storm forces Krug and his gang to seek refuge with John and Emma, whose house is nearby.

Legally Blondes
  Starting in the United Kingdom, Isabelle "Izzy" ([[Rebecca Rosso]]) and Annabelle "Annie" Woods ([[Camilla Rosso]]) are introduced as clever twin girls with a love for [[pink]] like their [[cousin]], [[Elle Woods]]. They and their widowed father move to [[Southern California]] to staying in Elle's home; Elle is now a successful lobbyist in Washington, D.C. Awaiting the girls are a pair of [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahua]] dogs, who are the nephews of Elle's chihuahua Bruiser. Their giddiness is cut short, however, when they find out they are going to attend Pacific Preparatory, Elle's alma mater, a private school requiring [[uniforms]].  Upon their first day, after meeting the strict Headmistress Elsa Higgins, who introduces them to Pac Prep's many rules and extensively detailed honor code, Izzy and Annie register themselves and sign for their ID cards, and meet Chris, a scholarship student who is almost immediately smitten with Annie. They also start off on the wrong foot with Tiffany Donohugh ([[Brittany Curran]]), the spoiled daughter of a primary funder of "Pac Prep."  Tiffany later apologizes for her rude behavior and befriends the [[twins]], although she does it merely to "keep her enemies close". Annie and Izzy believe Tiffany to be a sweet person, though she dislikes classmates on [[scholarship]]. However, her true colors come out when she embarrasses Annie and Izzy at a formal dance, revealing that they are on partial scholarship at the school.  Izzy and Annie rekindle their friendships with the other scholarship students, including Chris ([[Bobby Campo]]). Izzy wants to help Chris get closer to Annie, but in several instances, Annie believes Chris to like Izzy. The twins and their friends believe the uniforms are stifling their creativity and they re-style their clothing while still cleverly abiding by the school's rules.  Chris and Izzy are later accused of cheating on a big history test and they all set out to prove the school wrong. Izzy and Annie suspect Tiffany and Justin are behind this and find that Chris and Tiffany have the same backpack that comes with a lock and key; in Chris's locked zipper pocket, he keeps a master-key that opens all doors in the school (and was found broken off in the lock their history teacher's office), for his work-studies to help pay off his scholarship. They discover that the keys and locks for the backpacks are the same, any key will open any lock. On the floor of the teacher's private office, where the answer key to the test is kept, they discover red markings that match the marks that Justin's expensive shoes create. They conclude that Tiffany told Justin the uber code to access the answers to the test from their teacher's computer.  With this new piece of information, Annie and Izzy set to prove Chris and Izzy's innocence. In student court, Annie poses as Izzy when she is locked in the bathroom by Justin, and defeats her fear of public speaking. Even as Izzy escapes and returns to the court, Annie points out that Justin owns a new cell phone, one that has not yet been released to the public, and could only have been gotten from one person: the daughter of the creator of both the phone and the uber code, Tiffany Donohugh. Justin, who is irritated by noises such as pencils being sharpened and pen clicks, struggles to hold himself together as the supporters of the twins and Chris click their pens. He finally admits to framing Chris and Izzy on Tiffany's behalf and Tiffany, upon chewing him out for letting "a blonde make (him) crack", admits to masterminding the whole plot, though she protests that she cannot be punished since her father is a major founder and continuous donor of the school. Despite this, Headmistress Higgins expels them both for their attempt to frame their classmates for theft and cheating, and their numerous violations of the Pac Prep honor code in the process.  At the end of the movie, Annie and Chris dance together at a school dance and Izzy does the same with Brad (a secret scholarship student who assisted the twins in student court by ringing Justin's phone). The twins and their friends have now become popular at Pac Prep. As for Tiffany and Justin, they wind up facing the consequences for their actions as they are apparently cut off from their wealth as punishment from their parents for their crimes and for shaming their families (who founded and donated to the school), and are seen boarding a rowdy student-filled bus and being whisked off to public school, much to their horror.  
Leaves of Grass (film)
 The film opens with Bill Kincaid ([[Edward Norton]]) lecturing his class at Brown University about Plato's Socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, Bill's identical twin brother Brady Kincaid (also played by Edward Norton) is living in Oklahoma, growing and selling hydroponic cannabis.   Brady is under pressure from local drug lord Pug Rothbaum ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) to expand his sales. Despite needing money to repay a debt to Rothbaum, Brady refuses.  After a phone call from Brady's partner Bolger ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]) telling him that Brady has died from a crossbow arrow, Bill flies to Tulsa, meeting a Jewish orthodontist on the plane. In Tulsa, Bill is mistaken for Brady and is beaten up and knocked unconscious by rival marijuana dealers angry that Brady has taken half their territory. When Bill wakes, he finds that Brady is alive and has tricked him into travelling to Tulsa. Brady asks Bill to pretend to be Brady while he goes up state to "take care" of Rothbaum. Bill initially refuses, but later agrees, after meeting local poet Janet ([[Keri Russell]]) as he wants to stay and get to know her better.  While Bill (pretending to be Brady) visits their mother, thus giving Brady an alibi, Bolger and Brady go to a synagogue in Tulsa, where Rothbaum is listening to a sermon. Also present is Ken Feinman ([[Josh Pais]]), the orthodontist Bill met on the plane. He sees Brady and mistakes him for Bill. Brady and Bolger leave with Rothbaum, and Rothbaum demands the money Brady owes him. When Rothbaum threatens to kill them if they don't pay up, Bolger shoots Rothbaum's thugs, and Brady stabs Rothbaum, killing him.  In Tulsa, Ken Feinman hears of Rothbaum’s murder and figures everything out. He purchases a gun and sets off for Brady's house, where he encounters Bill and Brady and threatens to shoot them.  In a panic, Ken shoots Brady and Bill shoots Ken in retaliation. Before dying, Brady tells Bill to place the gun in his hand, which Bill does.  After an abortive attempt to sell Brady's dope-growing system to one of Brady's former rivals, Bill is shot through the chest by a crossbow. Bolger frantically drives him to hospital, saving Bill's life, and thereby repaying his debt to Brady (who had saved his life in prison). Bill is forced to stay in Tulsa for a long recuperation after his injury, allowing him time to heal his relationship with his mother and develop his romance with Janet.  
Law Abiding Citizen
 In a home invasion, Clarence Darby kills the wife and daughter of Clyde Shelton. Prosecuting Attorney Nick Rice is unable to securely convict Darby. Unwilling to take a chance on lowering his high conviction rate, he makes a deal with Darby, who pleads guilty to a lesser charge and receives a reduced sentence for testifying against his accomplice, Rupert Ames; Ames only intended to steal goods from Shelton and flee, and was totally unaware of Darby's plan to kill Shelton's wife and child. Ames is convicted and sentenced to death. Darby is released after a few years. Clyde feels betrayed by Rice's actions and the justice system.  Ten years later, Ames is executed. Unknown to the prosecutors and witnesses, the drug usually used has been replaced with an anticonvulsant, causing Ames to die painfully. Evidence implicates Darby. An anonymous caller alerts Darby as the police draw near and directs him to a remote location. Clyde, disguised as a police officer, reveals himself as the caller and paralyzes Darby with poison. He straps Darby to a table and video records dismembering him.  When Darby's remains are found, evidence ties his death to Clyde. Clyde willingly surrenders and goes to prison.  Rice learns his wife and daughter have been sent the dismemberment video and are traumatized by it. He initially refuses a plea bargain with Clyde, but District Attorney Jonas Cantrell orders Rice to make a deal. Clyde demands a new bed in his cell in exchange for a "confession." In court, Clyde represents himself and successfully argues he should be granted bail, then berates the judge for accepting the "bullshit" legal precedents he cited and for being too eager to let madmen and murderers back on the street. The judge jails Clyde for [[contempt of court]].  Clyde demands a steak lunch and a music player be delivered to his cell by a specific time, in return for telling where to find Darby's lawyer, who was reported missing. Rice agrees, though the lunch is delayed by a few minutes by the warden's security measures. Once he has his meal, which he shares with a cellmate, Clyde provides a set of coordinates where Rice and the others find Darby's lawyer, buried alive but suffocated by time-mechanized materials while Clyde's lunch was delayed. As loud music plays in Clyde's cell, he proceeds to kill his cellmate with the bone of his steak, forcing the warden to secure him in [[solitary confinement]].  Cantrell arranges a meeting with a [[CIA]] contact and brings Rice. They learn Clyde previously worked with the agency, creating imaginative assassination devices. They are warned Clyde can kill anyone anytime he wishes. During a meeting with Rice and Cantrell, the judge dies when her cell phone explodes. Clyde demands all charges against him be dropped or he  will "kill everyone". Rice takes precautionary measures instead. After a deadline has passed, a number of Rice's assistants die from car bombs. Leaving the funeral of a colleague, Cantrell is killed by a weaponized bomb disposal robot. Rice meets with Clyde in private and punches him repeatedly. Clyde stands his ground and tells Rice that he is just beginning to destroy the current system and all who believe in it. The mayor puts the city under lockdown and promotes Rice to acting District Attorney.  Rice learns that Clyde owns an auto garage near the prison. A tunnel leads to a cache of guns, disguises, and other equipment below the solitary confinement cells, with secret entrances to each cell. He and Police Detective Dunnigan realize that Clyde wanted to be in solitary confinement all along; this allows him to easily leave the prison without detection, carry out his pre-meditated murders while misleading the cops who assume he must have accomplices. Evidence points to Clyde's next target, City Hall, where the mayor is holding an emergency meeting. Rice and his men cannot find Clyde but discover evidence pointing to a cell-phone-activated suitcase bomb in the room directly below the meeting.  Clyde returns to his cell. He is surprised to find Rice waiting for him. Clyde suggests another deal, but Rice says he no longer makes deals with murderers, thanking Clyde for teaching him that. Rice warns him to not do anything he will regret, but Clyde's cell phone is ready to be dialed to activate the City Hall bomb. Rice and Dunnigan leave immediately when Clyde dials the phone. Clyde realizes too late that Rice has moved the bomb to his cell, which is now sealed. Clyde holds his daughter's bracelet, accepting his fate as the bomb explodes.  The epilogue shows Rice watching his daughter in a musical performance on stage, something he had been unable to find time for previously.

Lebanon (2009 film)
 The film depicts warfare as witnessed exclusively from the inside of a [[tank]]. The crew's window to the outside world is a [[Sight (device)|gunsight]]. As a way of adding realism to the effect, every change in the horizontal and vertical viewing directions is accompanied by the hydraulic whine of the traversing [[gun turret]].

For part of the time there is also the body of a dead Israeli soldier (kept there until it is airlifted away), a Syrian [[Prisoner of war|POW]], a visiting higher officer, and a visiting [[Phalange|Phalangist]] (Lebanese Maronite Catholic allied with Israel) who threatens the POW with torture and a gruesome death.  The soldiers are ordered to clear an area of Lebanese personnel. They are instructed to include the use of [[White phosphorus|phosphorus]] grenades that are forbidden by international treaty.

As a result, a fellow Israeli soldier is killed along with an innocent man in a subsequent incident involving equally poor judgment. The soldiers have to cope with the deteriorating state of the tank, heat, smoke, filth, stench, cramped quarters, equipment failure, navigational problems, conflicting information and recurring quarrels.

After this, it is revealed that Le Donk is to accompany Scorzayzee, playing the (obviously automated) [[Music loop|loops]] on the keyboard and singing in between Scorzayzee's rap verses.  Later in the evening, Le Donk receives a call from Olivia's boyfriend, as she has gone into [[childbirth|labour]]. Le Donk is at first reluctant to let Scorzayzee play the gig on his own, worried that he would not be able to handle the keyboards. ("It's ''a lot'' of beats") Le Donk then admits he is not required and that Scorzayzee is "the talent." Le Donk drives back to Nottingham and meets his baby son, and Olivia convinces him to travel back to Manchester to play.  The following afternoon, the two take to the stage at Old Trafford and play one song with the crowd reacting well to Scorzayzee's rapping but seemingly bemused by Le Donk's lyrics, which begin "Just calm down [[Deirdre Barlow]], just calm down [[Stephen Hawking]]."

Though he maintains that he is innocent, Kelly is convicted. At his sentencing he is presented with a choice between serving jail time and serving probation for one year as a student at an all-white Christian theological seminary.   Kelly faces overt hostility from his fellow students and confusion over his place in the school from the faculty.

Lesbian Vampire Killers
 Jimmy ([[Mathew Horne]]) and Fletch ([[James Corden]]) are two friends living in [[London]], experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in [[Norfolk]] that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving.  Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed [[vicar]] ([[Paul McGann]]) who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage - where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus.  The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a [[lesbian vampire]] on her eighteenth birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village during the night of a [[Hunter's moon|blood moon]], killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil. When the ruler of the land, Baron Wolfgang Mclaren (Jimmy's great ancestor) returned from the Crusades, he discovered one of the women corrupted by Carmilla was his wife, Eva. The baron forged a sacred sword, then defeated Carmilla, but before dying, Carmilla cursed the village, adding that when the blood of the last of Mclaren's bloodline mixed with a virgin girl's blood, Carmilla would be resurrected.  Fletch and Jimmy spend the night with the women. Heidi and Anke are turned into vampires. After Lotte insists that the others try to find her missing friends, they witness Trudi being turned. Eva, Carmilla's mistress, tries to draw Lotte to her growing clan of lesbian vampires. The trio runs back into the cottage after killing Heidi and Anke and barricade themselves in after the vampires destroy the van. Jimmy's ex-girlfriend, Judi arrives at the door and Jimmy not ready to give up on the relationship, takes her into the bedroom. Lotte reveals to Fletch that she is a virgin and wants to sleep with Jimmy.  At the church, the Vicar researches the vampire slayer who killed Carmilla before arming himself and setting off to find Jimmy. Judi reveals herself to be a vampire, and after a struggle, Fletch and Jimmy kill her. The vampires approach the cottage and Jimmy inadvertently invites them in. Eva discovers that Jimmy is the descendant of the baron who killed Carmilla and that Lotte is a virgin and kidnaps them.  The Vicar saves Fletch from Trudi and tells Fletch the truth about the village and Jimmy's identity. They go after Jimmy and Lotte in the Vicar's crucifix-covered car. As the vampires prepare to sacrifice Lotte and Jimmy, Fletch and the Vicar try to recover the Sword of Dylldo, the sword that killed Carmilla, from the baron's tomb. While Fletch works to open the tomb, the Vicar checks on his daughter Rebecca, but does not notice that she has been turned. Rebecca attempts to seduce Fletch, who does not know what she is. When she attacks him, she is inadvertently impaled on the sword. Fletch decides not to tell the Vicar of his daughter's death.  At Carmilla's tomb, Lotte reveals her love for Jimmy. The vampires begin draining the two of their blood to resurrect Carmilla. With the sword, Fletch and the Vicar drive to Carmilla's tomb. When they enter the woods, they bring various weapons, but forget the sword. Despite not having the sword, the pair reach Jimmy and Lotte. The Vicar releases them, but not before enough blood gathers to resurrect Carmilla. The Vicar sacrifices himself so the others can get back to the car for the sword. Eva separates Lotte from the men, attacking and seducing her. Lotte fights back while Fletch and Jimmy fetch weapons. Lotte kills Eva with her [[cross necklace]], infuriating Carmilla. Fletch tries to kill Carmilla before Lotte is turned, but is captured himself. Jimmy saves them by hurling the sword at Carmilla, piercing her heart and destroying her for good. With the curse lifted, the three survivors decide to continue ridding the world of evil.  The film ends with the shot of a "Gay [[Werewolf]]" howling before the full moon.

Life Partner
 Karan ([[Fardeen Khan]]) and Bhavesh ([[Tusshar Kapoor]]) are close friends living in [[Cape Town, South Africa]]. Karan has a good life, with a well-paying job. He is in a comfortable relationship with his beautiful yet childish and pampered girlfriend Sanjana ([[Genelia D'Souza]]), who changes her profession every six months rather disastrously. Her father ([[Anupam Kher]]), who dislikes Karan, always tries to keep her happy and supports her. Bhavesh wishes for an arranged marriage and keeps a diary of all the beautiful things he will do to his wife after marriage. His father Darshan Manibhai Patel ([[Darshan Jariwala]]) is a strict autocrat, patriarch and a tough follower of the [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]. Jeet ([[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]]) does not believe in marriage or love and is a womaniser. He encourages married women into divorcing their spouses so that his living as a divorce lawyer is uncompromised.  Bhavesh's father treats him as young and incapable of marriage, but on his wife's ([[Shoma Anand]]) insistence, he travels with his family, along with Karan and Sanjana to [[Gujarat]] to find Bhavesh a bride. In Gujarat, they stay at the palatial home of Bhavesh's father's friend, Vijay Singh Jadeja ([[Vikram Gokhale]]). Bhavesh meets some girls but ends up falling for Prachi ([[Prachi Desai]]), Vijay Singh's daughter, and they get married. During their wedding, Sanjana says "yes" to Karan's proposal as well and they get married the same night.  The movie then switches to the present, where both couples are at court. The judge declares the divorce between Karan and Sanjana and Bhavesh and Prachi valid. The story goes back 6 months earlier, showing what led to the divorces when they came back to Cape Town from India.  After marriage, Karan and Sanjana's family life deteriorates, with Karan wanting domestic stability and Sanjana being a horrible homemaker. Karan finally loses patience with Sanjana after she accidentally burns down their apartment, and yells at her, venting his frustration at her stupidity and his dislike for her father. Shocked and heartbroken, Sanjana leaves and sends a notice of divorce to him the very next morning.  Bhavesh is happy with Prachi but Prachi is stifled at the old-fashioned ideals and strict rules of Bhavesh's father. She, without her father-in-law's knowledge, applies for a job - the very idea of which angers him. Bhavesh, taking sides with his father, slaps her at the same time Prachi's father arrives. Bhavesh, bound by his father's old-fashioned ideas, is unable to stand by his wife. This ends with Prachi divorcing Bhavesh.  Jeet later changes his lifestyle when he meets Anjali ([[Amrita Rao]] in a special appearance), who turns out to be different from all the other girls he has met since she does not give up on him and expresses a genuine desire to marry him. He decides to get married to her and Karan and Bhavesh shout themselves hoarse at him, stating that since Jeet had facilitated their divorces, he has no right to get married. Jeet explains that he was wrong in taking a negative view of love and marriage and also says that wives or "life partners" always stood by their husbands, thus it is never worth it to break up such a relationship.  At Jeet's wedding, Sanjana enters the party, wearing a "bomb", shouting that Jeet was happily getting married when he had caused her divorce. With five minutes left for the bomb to explode, Karan and Sanjana have an argument as to why their divorce took place. Sanjana's father intervenes by saying that he had been against the relationship from the start, and he had sent the divorce papers to them without their knowledge. With only seconds left, Bhavesh's father also apologises to Prachi and the family for imposing his traditional values on them. However, the "bomb" turns out to be fake. When this is revealed to be a plan concocted by Jeet and Sanjana to bring everyone to admit their mistakes, everyone reconciles with each other.  At the end, Bhavesh's father lets go of his strict ideals and is shown interacting happily and in a modern manner with his family. Jeet becomes a marriage counsellor, now uniting the very people he separated, and Karan unsuccessfully tries to teach Sanjana how to cook.

In the beginning of the movie, he lures his girlfriend, Debbie, to a secluded alley where he and another gang member gang rape her. He leads his gang into robbing and [[torture|torturing]] a very sick pensioner, and then steps up to doing a murder-for-hire at the behest of a local drug dealer, unaware of the enormous risks.  Manny and Concetta, a young couple, are desperately trying to rise out of poverty and care for their sick baby. Manny works two jobs—the front desk of a drug-riddled flop house by day and the cash register of a frequently-robbed [[convenience store|bodega]] at night.  It hardly matters that he is working so hard because the baby's non-stop crying will not allow him to sleep.  Another young couple, Marybeth and Benny, are both drug addicts. Marybeth is a [[transgender]] woman who makes a bit of money as a street prostitute to pay for surgery, and Benny is into very low-paying burglaries.  Their principal source of drugs is a well-off transvestite, Ridley, who is looking to follow in Marybeth's footsteps.  Young Willy and younger Susie are the much-neglected children of an addict named Mommy, who makes them sleep on the floor of their one-room apartment. Mommy's current boyfriend, a hot-tempered addict named Chaz, makes the children beg on the street for his drug money.  Willy's one bright spot is neighbor child Melody, whose mother pimps her out every night.  When Chaz and Mommy leave the children behind while they embark on a drug-fueled quest to get more drug money from a relative of Chaz, Melody is picked up by the police. Willy, meanwhile, is sent on a wild goose chase by Betty, an aging prostitute who enjoys tormenting her neighbors.

Trish's ex-husband, Bill has been released from prison after serving a sentence for [[child molestation]], and heads to [[Florida]] to find out how his family, particularly his eldest son, are doing. He finds brief solace in a one-night stand with Jacqueline, a self-described "monster" as filled with loneliness and self-hatred as he is; however, she kicks him out the next morning when she catches him taking money from her purse.  Trish's middle child, Timmy, is preparing for his [[bar mitzvah]] and trying to determine what it means to become a man. Trish has for years told Timmy and Chloe that Bill had died, to avoid telling them that he is a [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]. Timmy finds out, however, and is angry at her that she lied to him. When he asks her about the mechanics of rape, Trish urges him to scream as soon as any man touches him.  Meanwhile, Joy takes a break from Allen, and heads to Florida to spend time with Trish. She begins having visions of Andy, a former co-worker who had committed suicide shortly after dating her. She briefly goes to California to visit Helen, who has become a successful screenwriter, and calls her husband to leave a message that she is coming home. The audience sees that Allen has committed suicide. She returns to Florida to attend Timmy's bar mitzvah.  In the meantime, Bill sneaks into Trish's house to find Billy's college address. He pays Billy an unexpected visit at Northern Oregon University, where they discuss their past and the time that passed while Bill was in prison; in particular, Bill asks Billy a few very blunt questions about his sex life. Bill asks for forgiveness, but Billy refuses, saying his actions are unforgivable. Bill then disappears again, reassured that Billy will not turn out to be like him.  Harvey brings his adult son Mark to dinner at Trish's, where he and Trish introduce their children to each other. At Timmy's request, Harvey comes to Timmy's room to have a talk. Timmy asks Harvey whether he is [[gay]] or a pedophile. Harvey denies being either, and, suspecting Timmy has been molested, tries to comfort him, touching his shoulder and hugging him. Terrified, Timmy starts to scream as per his mother's earlier instructions. Trish believes that Harvey tried to molest Timmy, and dumps him.  Timmy has his bar mitzvah, during which Joy experiences visions of Andy and then Allen, who implores her to commit suicide as he has, but Joy refuses and banishes him from her life. Timmy leaves the reception to find Mark, Harvey's son. He begs Mark (who revealed he had dealt with allegations of pedophilia) for forgiveness, as he made his mistakes before his bar mitzvah (an event marking the beginning of moral accountability). Mark grants him forgiveness, but notes that such gestures are meaningless. Timmy then says that all he wants is his father.

The Limits of Control
  In an airport, Lone Man ([[Isaach de Bankolé]]) is being instructed on his mission by Creole ([[Alex Descas]]). The mission itself is left unstated and the instructions are cryptic, including such phrases as "Everything is subjective," "The universe has no center and no edges; reality is arbitrary," and "Use your imagination and your skills." After the meeting in the airport he travels to [[Madrid]] and then on to [[Seville]], meeting several people in cafés and on trains along the way.  Each meeting has the same pattern: he orders two espressos at a cafe and waits, his contact arrives and in Spanish asks, "You don't speak Spanish, right?" in different ways, to which he responds, "No." The contacts tell him about their individual interests such as molecules, art, or film, then the two of them exchange matchboxes. A code written on a small piece of paper is inside each matchbox, which Lone Man reads and then eats. These coded messages lead him to his next rendezvous.  He repeatedly encounters a woman ([[Paz de la Huerta]]) who is always either completely nude or wearing only a transparent raincoat. She invites him to have sex with her but he declines, stating that he never has sex while he is working. One phrase that Creole, the man in the airport tells him is repeated throughout the movie: "He who thinks he is bigger than the rest must go to the cemetery. There he will see what life really is: a handful of dirt." This phrase is sung in a [[flamenco]] song in a club in [[Seville]] at one point in his journey.  In [[Almería]], he is given a ride in a pickup truck - driven by a companion of the Mexican ([[Gael García Bernal]]) - on which the words ''La vida no vale nada'' ('life is worth nothing') are painted, a phrase Guitar ([[John Hurt]]) says to him in [[Seville]], and he is taken to [[Tabernas]] desert. There lies a fortified and heavily guarded compound. After observing the compound from afar, he somehow penetrates its defenses and waits for his target inside the target's office. The target ([[Bill Murray]]) asks how he got in, and he answers, "I used my imagination." After the murder with a guitar string, he rides back to Madrid, where he locks away the suit he has worn throughout the movie and changes into a sweatsuit bearing the national flag of [[Cameroon]]. Before exiting the train station onto a crowded sidewalk he throws away his last matchbox.

A Little Pond
 The plot draws on No Gun Ri victims' experiences, but the characters are all fictional. The film opens with scenes establishing the ordinary domestic rhythms of a midcentury Korean village, with children at play, men relaxing over a board game, and a young teacher leading her pupils in practice for a singing contest. But the fighting front of the war, which began several weeks earlier, soon intrudes as combat moves south.  The United States has hastily dispatched insufficiently trained troops from Japan to join the South Korean army in defending against North Korean invaders. As the defenders reel in retreat, American soldiers order the villagers to abandon their homes and head south. Some 500 begin the trek, with children on their backs and carts laden with belongings.  Rumors have spread among American soldiers that North Korean infiltrators are disguised among South Korean refugees. As the villagers struggle southward along a railroad track, they are suddenly attacked by American warplanes. Many are killed. In the ensuing chaos, U.S. soldiers force hundreds of survivors into the underpass of a railroad bridge, and receive orders to fire on them, despite one soldier's communication to his superiors that they're only civilians. Over the next three days, in heart-wrenching scenes of carnage, most of the refugees are killed. The few survivors, mostly children, emerge from under piles of bodies as the Americans retreat and advancing North Korean soldiers discover the gruesome scene. (Survivors estimated 400 people were killed.) [[File:No Gun Ri scene in film "A Little Pond".jpg|thumb|250px|left|A depiction of the scene under the No Gun Ri bridge. The U.S. military killed a large number of South Korean refugees under and around the bridge in July 1950.]]  In the denouement, survivors and villagers who were never trapped under the bridge return to their homes as the tides of war ebb and flow. One of the last is a boy, assumed dead by his mother, who has carried his small sister on his back for miles from their southern refuge. As the credits roll, ''A Little Pond'' ends with a kind of dream sequence in which children and villagers brought back to life sing and applaud the contest theme song they never performed.

London Dreams
 The story revolves around two childhood friends, Arjun (played by [[Ajay Devgn]]) and Mannu (played by [[Salman Khan]]). When Arjun was 17 years old, he was more focused on becoming a singer but his father disagreed therefore he began praying for his death so he can go to London. The only one who consoled him was his 15 years old friend Mannu. After Arjun's father dies, he finally travels to London with his uncle ([[Om Puri]]) whom he later runs away from after arriving.  Arjun, now 35 years old creates a fledgling band with Zoheb and Wasim ([[Rannvijay Singh]] and [[Aditya Roy Kapoor]], respectively), two brothers who duped their relatives in Pakistan to travel to London in pursuit of their musical aspirations. He also brings aboard Priya (played by [[Asin]]), a music enthusiast from a conservative South Indian family. Back in [[India]], Mannu seduces married women and finds himself in debt with the locals.  After paying his debt, Mannu goes to London to join Arjun's band, but becomes more popular with the crowds. Mannu also flirts with Priya.  The band embarks on a three-city tour spanning Paris, Rome, and Amsterdam where Arjun deceives a naive Mannu into a rollercoaster ride of promiscuous sex and illicit drugs. He tricks him, gets him addicted to drugs, and then gets him arrested in a car full of them. While pretending to help Mannu, Arjun leaks the drug story to the press. As the three-city tour concludes, the band heads to London to perform at [[Wembley Stadium]] in front of an audience estimated at 90,000 (which is of significance since, earlier in the movie, the viewer is told that Arjun's grandfather had failed before a similarly huge audience). Knowing how important this is for Arjun, Mannu tries to give up drugs. But Arjun decides that his success and Mannu's total failure are related. He pays a girl to pretend to have oral sex with Mannu, which makes Priya break up with Mannu. In this fragile state, Zoheb pushes Mannu toward drugs again and his mental state is now so fragile that he can't face appearing on stage.  In the moments leading up to the stage entrance, Mannu comes to senses and chooses the righteous path and runs to support his mate. But Arjun, who has become incensed with the crowd chanting Mannu's name, confesses his envy of Mannu's talent and what he did to finish Mannu off. The audience boos Arjun, the show ends in chaos, the band breaks up and a sad Mannu eventually returns to his village.  Arjun's uncle advises him to apologize to Mannu. Then it is revealed that after knowing the truth Priya and Mannu reconcile. Also, she marries Mannu and lives with him in his village. In the village, however, Mannu tells him not to apologize saying that it was his fault that he didn't see Arjun's sorrow and Priya also pardons Arjun for his wrong deeds. They get back together and London Dreams becomes a successful band again.  
The Lodger (2009 film)
  The story opens with a brutal murder of a [[prostitute]] taking place on [[Sunset Boulevard]], in [[Hollywood]]. The [[detective]] in charge is Chandler Manning and his rookie assistant is Street Wilkenson. They initially believe this is a stand alone murder, but when a second prostitute is killed, the [[medical examiner]] says the two murders are not only eerily similar to two murders that took place 7 years prior, but they are exact copies of the first two [[Jack the Ripper]] murders in 1888 London. Since Detective Manning had caught who he thought was the murderer of the previous crimes, they now realize the wrong person was tried, prosecuted and executed. Manning is also dealing with a wife who tried to commit suicide, and his estranged daughter, Amanda, who blames him for the attempt.  In a second story line, a couple is looking to rent their guest house when a passerby comes to the door and says he wishes to rent the room. Ellen Bunting takes the lodger, Malcolm Slaight, to see the room and he immediately agrees to rent the guest house but says several times he cannot be disturbed since he is a writer, and needs complete quiet. When Ellen's husband, Joe, asks her why the "for rent" sign has been removed, she says she's rented the room but the lodger needs to be left alone. Joe doesn't believe she's rented the guest house because he never sees anyone coming or going from the premises, and because he knows his wife has episodes where she imagines things and needs to take medication. Ellen begins to have feelings for the lodger and she goes out of her way to see him. She catches him in their kitchen late one night and when he says he was looking for scissors, she reaches across him to pick up and hand him a pair, but he just takes them and walks out.   The ripper copycat then commits two more murders, but this time he is seen by a witness who describes a man with a long black coat and a black bag. Manning notices a garbage can near the murder site with BATTY written on it; when he opens the lid, he finds a pair of bloody underwear that belong to one of the victims. Wilkenson is suspicious of how he knew there was something in the can, but Manning references the previous ripper murders and how they found a portion of clothing from one of the victims. Manning then goes to the old case files for the man he had previously arrested for the murders 7 years ago, and takes evidence of a letter that was written to him after the arrest had taken place. While there, he pulls his gun on the evidence clerk and tells him to stop following him.  Ellen continues to make contact with the lodger by taking him breakfast and tea - anything to be near him. On one visit she sees a pair of her husband's boots drying on a newspaper, and Malcolm states they got muddy when he walked in the garden. The lodger then kisses her, and Joe can be seen in the house, beginning to head for the guest house. As he is nearing, Ellen opens the door and walks out with the boots, saying she was cleaning them. She sees a picture in the newspaper of a footprint taken of boots that is linked to the crime, and puts the sole of the boot on top of the picture, but then does nothing despite realizing that they are the same size. Joe, getting tired of what he thinks is Ellen's hallucination, forces her next door and tells her he doesn't want to hear another word about the imaginary lodger if they see no one in the room. When the door opens, no one is there and Ellen is left sitting in the rain while Joe disgustedly walks back to the house.  Manning and Wilkenson begin investigating the suspects that are known to frequent the area where the killings are taking place, and this brings them into contact with Joe Bunting. They visit the Bunting home, and Ellen acts suspiciously when she takes them to see the guest house. They leave to get a warrant to search the place, but Manning is pulled into a meeting with the Captain of the precinct and the Mayor. Since he threatened the evidence clerk while at the station, they feel this - combined with his personal life - is causing him to lose touch with reality and they place him on suspension. Det. Wilkenson is left trying to solve the case without the assistance of Manning and when he sees Manning's name on a suspect list, he goes to the Captain. The Captain believes Manning is delusional and psychotic, and not only committed the murders 7 years ago but is obsessed with Jack the Ripper and is committing murders again, just so he can solve them. Manning realizes that the Captain suspects him and observes the Captain and officers searching his apartment, and that they have taken the letter he had stolen from evidence.  Ellen, believing Malcolm is guilty but not caring, goes to the guest house to wipe it clean of any evidence he was ever there, and disturbs a cabinet, causing a gush of red liquid that appears to be blood to spill from it. Malcolm walks in then and confronts her about why she's there and says a bottle of red ink must've spilled. Ellen goes to the house and begins washing her hands of the ink/blood and Malcolm walks in, carrying a black bag. Ellen - realizing he's either about to leave, or worse, kill her - says she won't tell anyone what she's seen and will do anything to protect him. Malcolm appears to let her take the bag from his hand. Meanwhile, Joe is at work and finds that the police have been there to talk to him and becomes agitated.   Manning goes to Wilkenson to ask him for help, as there has been yet another murder, leaving only one woman left to be killed before the murderer disappears. Wilkenson agrees and they get the warrant they need to search the Bunting's guest house but initially find nothing. Manning then realizes the cabinet hasn't been opened and when they do, in it are maps with red ink and prints on them. Wilkenson and the Captain both look suspiciously at Manning because they believe he is planting evidence, and Wilkenson cuffs Manning to escort him in, though they also place a call to pick up Joe at work. When the police arrive, they realize Joe is no longer there.   We see Manning's daughter, Amanda, leaving her dorm at college and being observed by someone in the shadows. Manning notices two maps at the scene, one of London during the Ripper murders and another of Hollywood, marking the current killing. He sees that the marks on the map line up for the past murders, except now there is a new mark on the Hollywood map that doesn't line up, and it is exactly where his daughter's dorm is. He talks Wilkenson into removing the cuffs and they head off to grab Amanda, but she is walking down the street, headed to a local venue. She is being followed by someone in a long black coat, wearing boots and begins to run.  She stops and turns when she hears the sirens but the ripper has moved to the side and attempts to attack her when she stops. Manning sees the attack and runs off after the ripper, while Wilkenson stays with Amanda. The ripper is chased into the Bunting home where Manning, the Captain and several officers enter. We see Ellen in the living room, sitting in a rocking chair, wielding a long, curved knife. She drops the knife when they enter and go upstairs; they find Joe has been cut up very badly but is still alive.  The ending provides an explanation for the killings; Ellen became schizophrenic by the death of her baby in child birth 8 years ago, and this sent her into a spiral of killing. She also made up the imaginary life that her son lived, and the lodger, who was a romantic interest for her. Though the police and the press accept that this is the truth and Ellen is the killer, Manning doesn't believe it and the last scene is Malcolm, at a new residence in Santa Monica, looking for new lodgings.

Logorama
 The opening shot is a panorama of [[Los Angeles]], revealing a city where all of the buildings and inhabitants are some form of commercial branding: birds in the form of [[Bentley]] logos, [[MSN]]'s butterfly, pedestrians in the shape of the [[Aol chat|AIM icon]], overhead highway signs mounted on [[Atlantic Records]] logos, etc. The major characters are revealed in an [[Robert Altman|Altman]]-esque tableau. The [[Pringles]] mascot (voiced by [[David Fincher]]) pulls into a restaurant's parking lot and propositions an [[Esso]] Girl waitress (voiced by Aja Evans) who is on a smoking break. Two [[Michelin Man]] cops in a parked cruiser (voiced by [[Bob Stephenson (actor)|Bob Stephenson]] and [[Sherman Augustus]]) are introduced as they debate the morality of keeping animals in zoos. Across town, Bob's [[Big Boy (restaurant)|Big Boy]] (voiced by [[Joel Michaely]]) and [[Haribo]] (voiced by [[Matt Winston]]) are on a tour at the zoo led by a flamboyant [[Mr. Clean]] (voiced by Michaely). The two boys hate the tour and hop off the [[My First Thomas & Friends|tour train]]. They soon begin to harass the [[MGM lion]] by mooning it and throwing a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle at it, but they are scolded by the zoo security, the [[Green Giant]].  As the cops order lunch, a call comes in over the radio about a criminal on the loose in a red delivery truck. Both cops spy [[Ronald McDonald]] (voiced by Stephenson) in the truck and give chase. The pursuit quickly veers out of control, as innocent bystanders are imperiled. Meanwhile, the kids at the zoo have finished their visit and are back on the school bus, soon nearing the [[Pizza Hut]] where Esso Girl is waiting on the Original Pringles mascot and the Pringles Hot & Spicy mascot. Ronald McDonald swerves to avoid the school bus and tips his truck over in front of the Pizza Hut. Several guns and biological weapons spill out of the back of the truck, tempting Big Boy and Haribo to steal them for sale on the black market. Ronald McDonald knocks out Haribo with his foot, takes Big Boy hostage, and runs into the Pizza Hut. Inside, Big Boy bites Ronald McDonald and runs for cover behind the counter with Esso Girl. Enraged, Ronald McDonald opens fire, giving the police the excuse to start firing on him, and he kills one of the police officers.  [[File:Xbox original logo black.png|200px|thumb|The Xbox logo, on which the logo-shaped fissure split the streets of the city open.]] As the gun battle explodes into the streets, a low rumbling can be heard across the entire city. A giant earthquake opens a fissure in the shape of Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] video game console logo, which splits the streets of the city open. Big Boy and Esso Girl escape the rapidly crumbling Pizza Hut and steal a cop car. While running from the police on a stolen ''[[Grease 2]]'' motorcycle, Ronald McDonald runs into a fallen [[Weight Watchers]] sign and is thrown off, sliding into a crevasse shaped like the [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] logo. As he tries to pull himself out, he is run over by Esso Girl and Big Boy's car. The duo barely escape the city, speeding along a curved highway shaped like the [[VAIO]] logo. As they near the [[Hollywood Chewing Gum|Hollywood]] [[Hollywood sign|sign]], it falls apart, sending the giant letters crashing onto the highway in front of them. While evading one of the letters, they veer off the highway and down a hill, crashing into a [[American Century Investments|tree]]. [[Crude oil]] erupts from the rifts around town and floods Los Angeles. The hill Esso Girl and Big Boy are on splits in two, revealing a giant [[The North Face|North Face]] logo. Eventually, the land crumbles around them, swallowed by the sea, leaving them on a tiny island together (with Esso Girl picking up a coloured [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and taking a bite). The film closes by zooming out to reveal that the entire universe is made up of even more logos. After the credits, a bald, black eyed, and partly toothless Ronald McDonald laughs menacingly and says "[[I'm lovin' it]]."  
Lo (film)
  The film opens with Justin (Ward Roberts) sitting inside a pentagram and following the steps in a dark magic book to summon the crippled demon Lo (Jeremiah Birkett). Justin orders Lo to search Hell for his girlfriend April (Sarah Lassez), whom he insists was taken by a demon. Lo becomes angered not only by the demand but the fact that there are countless billions of people in Hell and finding April would be an impossible task. Undeterred, Justin orders Lo to search anyway. Conceding, Lo asks for details about April to narrow down his search. The memory of their first meeting begins to play in the background in the form of a Vaudeville play.  April's personality is quirky, endearing, but overall odd.  As the flashback ends another demon, Jeez, arrives, whom Justin identifies as the demon who took April and injured him. Jeez has come to see "the mortal who tamed the beast; it explains that it has felt many emotions (hate, annoyance, embarrassment), but never love, making it confused as to why "it" - April - fell in love with Justin.  It says the one Justin calls April was once considered to be one of the best killers in Hell but abandoned its kin to experience love.  Justin refuses to believe that April is a demon, despite insistence from Lo and Jeez.  Lo makes a mistake in conversation, revealing that it in fact did know April - as a cold-blooded killer demon.  After Justin insinuates that Lo is too weak to bring April back, Lo leaves in anger. While alone, Justin discovers that the cut on his hand from the summoning spell has begun to voice his subconscious thoughts and he begins to argue with it. Lo returns, finding the argument amusing.   Lo tells Justin that April is in "lock up" and can't be retrieved so instead it's brought two souls from Hell to describe the tortures they endure after April tricked them into selling their souls.  Lo once again states that it can't retrieve April, going as far as to say its legs were crushed when April returned to Hell. Justin jumps to the conclusion that Lo helped her escape and was punished. Lo tells him to think about her if he wants to see her again, beginning another Vaudeville-style flashback, this time of their first Christmas together.  Justin hands April a present which she unwraps after some initial confusion to discover a rare copy of Faust. She seems confused by the concept of gift-giving but quickly becomes excited about the prospect of reading as she had never read a book besides her own before, a slip of the tongue she quickly covers up. Justin accepts it as her being quirky and doesn't seem to notice. April becomes confused when Justin asks what she got him and becomes upset when she realizes that he expected a gift as well. Realizing that she only has one thing to give as a gift, April gives him her book on demon summoning, which she explicitly tells him not to open and to burn it if she ever leaves.  As the flashback ends, Lo points out that it seems obvious she was a demon. The cut on Justin's hand begins to talk again, questioning April's trust in him and implying that she was using him, and he made it easy to do so. Lo tells Justin that his condition will only worsen the longer he stays in the circle and that he should undo the spell and leave. A waiter (the same one from the flashback about Justin's first encounter with April) then appears and offers Justin a drink. Lo tells Justin that the drink will allow him to travel though Hell to her. Lo asks him if April is truly worth going to Hell for and Justin responds by downing it, an act that causes Lo to laugh uncontrollably before telling him it was poison.  Lo leaves before Jeez arrives, telling Justin that it's a slow-acting poison that can be stopped, but only if he ends the spell, goes to a hospital and gets his stomach pumped. Justin responds by saying that he won't leave without "her", a fact that annoys Jeez who tells him that demons are genderless and that April is an "it". Out of curiosity, Jeez asks what love is. After a brief and pointless attempt at defining love Justin merely smiles, annoying Jeez to the point of leaving.  The hand begins to talk again, this time making the point that it would rather live than die for April. Justin agrees that he doesn't want to die, but wouldn't be able to live without her. Just as he is about to cut off his own hand to stop his inner conflict, Lo interrupts him.   Lo says that April is vile for falling in love and isn't worth any effort on Justin's part. Justin ignores this on the grounds that who she was on Earth isn't who she was in Hell. Lo remains adamant that she was always the same murderer she was in Hell. Justin responds by forcing a flashback while Lo watches.  In the flashback, Justin and April are in bed but are both woken up when she has a nightmare, only to be comforted by Justin. April suddenly smells sulfur and is attacked by Jeez. Justin tries to help but is slashed across his chest. As he lays dying, April bargains with Jeez to return to Hell as long as she is allowed to save him first, a condition Jeez agrees to. He reminds her to bring the book, but she brings the book of Faust instead, leaving the demon summoning book with Justin.  Once the flashback ends, Lo admonishes Justin for not burning the book as she had asked, saying that Justin had betrayed his love. Justin becomes digressive with Lo and comes to the conclusion that humans are allowed to make mistakes, while demons get satisfaction from torturing them because they don't have a choice. Lo begins to laugh again, accompanied with other demons, while Justin holds his head in pain. After Lo stops laughing at him, Justin becomes infuriated and shouts at a surprised Lo, reiterating that he is the master and that he has power over it. He orders Lo once again to find April in Hell, and then to "fuck off". Lo, left speechless, leaves. Once Justin calms down, he looks at a picture of April and begins to cry.  Justin looks up to see April in front of him. She notes that he didn't burn the book, but she forgives him. Justin again affirms his love for her and his determination to bring her back with him.  She kisses Justin, extracting the poison from his body. April tells Justin that she can't go with him as the demons would always find them, putting Justin in danger. Justin offers to stay but April refuses to let him stay in Hell for eternity. As April drags herself away she pauses and,looking back, she becomes Lo, revealing that they were the same person from the start.  The next day Justin is shown in his apartment preparing to burn the book. As he sets it on fire, he watches, ending the film.

Look (2009 film)
 ''Look'' is about a barmaid, Emma (Starina Johnson), who is caught in a daydream when interrupted by a lost model ([[Theresa Meeker]]). The desire for beauty reveals an unsettling emptiness.<ref name="LOOK"></ref>  In an interview with Matthew Saliba of Rogue Cinema, Pickett said, "I feel so alive as a director when making films like this. It's pure emotion. What can we tell you from just our eyes? What are you seeing with yours? Essentially what "Look" is about. Perception and how it works in our lives. The story was just part of the whole, I knew what I wanted to accomplish in this film and worked on a story that would allow that. There actually was a bit more dialogue in the film that I decided to cut out. The story is what you create in your head while watching it, not one I wrote. Or that was my intention."<ref name="Rogue Cinema"></ref> In an interview with Saliba, Meeker said, "Ryan really left its meaning up to interpretation. There are so many different ways that people could think about Look without being wrong in their analysis of it."<ref name="Rogue Cinema"/>  
Lost in the Hood
  A pair of thugs (one of them wielding a camera) are driving through their neighborhood when they spot a lost pizza deliverer, who one of them recognizes from a few days prior, when he was woken up by the man obnoxiously pounding on the doors of his neighbors. One of the hoods grabs the [[pizza delivery]] boy, and takes him into a house, where he physically and verbally abuses the man, and forces him into giving a [[Fellatio|blowjob]]. The thug then [[Sodomy|sodomizes]] the pizza deliverer, and ejaculates into his face, and onto his chest.  At night, the cameraman and a hood named Magnum attack Jamie, a lost motorist, who they drag from his vehicle. Magnum takes the sobbing Jamie to a workout room, where he sexually assaults him, stuffs underwear into his mouth, and repeatedly threatens to torture and kill him. The first rapist and the cameraman are then shown driving through town, bantering back and forth, until they see a supposedly gay man the rapist had previously tried to capture, only for the intended victim to get away. They drive up, pull the man into the vehicle, and then drag him into a house, where the thug beats and rapes him.  The cameraman is with Kacarot, another hood, and they ambush a man on a bicycle, who is forced to fellate Kacarot. The first rapist (who is out of prison on [[parole]]) returns for the final sequence, this time bringing along his half-brother.

Loudspeaker (film)
 The movie is all about the relationships between two rare bred men from extremely different strata of society, but more in common than is apparent from the first look. They might have never run into each other, with their stark contrast in nature and life styles and would have hardly given each other a second look, if they hadn't met in these defined circumstances. But the movie throws them together, intertwined in worst of their days and progressively built in the rapport between the extremes, and infuses the spirit of worthy and meaningful life to all in the screen and those who  watches them on screen.  [[Mammootty]]  plays the lead role Mike Philippose, a barefooted uneducated simpleton who lands in the city, armoured with his loud voice, opinions and dazzling wit to stand up with the different level of etiquette's he find in the flats of the city. His arrival is as a kidney donor to ailing Anand Menon, an astrophysicist who returned to his home nation after working in US for the last forty six years. A dejected man who wants to run away from his memories, Menon is turned into the reverse track by Mike, who lives with his memories and snobs about his deceased father and about the silent hamlet of Thopramkudy.                    The movie packs a lot of characters like the old man (Janardhanan) in legal tussle with his children, the fighting couple (Kalpana and Reghu) who even don't like to see face to face, a secretary of the flat residents (Jagathy) who only has a dog for his company, a group of loud bachelors and a kid who turns into a brat, left alone and away from her parents.

He remained the sole survivor when a mosque collapsed in [[Maharashtra]] when he was just a child of nine months and was amongst very few survivors of another incident at the age of 12. When he was 14, he challenged three friends to jump from a four-storied building and remained alive, though with some injuries, and won. He started gambling at 19 and since then tried out his luck in different places of the world and became known as Musa Bhai. To him gambling and drug smuggling have become old ways to get money, his latest interest is investment on people's luck.  Ram Mehra ([[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]), is abducted by Lakhan Tamang ([[Danny Denzongpa]]), but instead of taking, he gives Ram hundred thousand rupees and explains that Ram is very lucky as Tamang bought lottery tickets for two years without any success until he took tickets from Ram both of which won him two hundred thousand rupees. He then offers Ram 200&nbsp;million rupees for which Ram has to gamble with him for 20 days. After Ram agrees, Musa Bhai and Tamang create a game, getting people with luck to play, and the luckiest ones win them money.  Later, along with Ram, Tamang hires Major Lucky ([[Mithun Chakrabarty]]), who is a soldier as lucky once as he fought in battles and faced numerous bullets  yet none that could kill him. He is in need of money for the operation of his wife Sheila ([[Roopa Ganguly]]). Tamang then visits [[Pakistan]] where he discovers Shortcut ([[Chitrashi Rawat]]), a 16-year-old girl, who is also known to be lucky as any camel she rides wins the race and observes her winning one despite her camel's half-broken leg. Tamang pays four lakh rupees to "export" her to South Africa. Tamang then invites the sole-criminal, Raghav Raghuvaran ([[Ravi Kishan]]) to the game. Raghav was put in [[Tihar Jail]] for raping many women, and also killing them, but when he was hanged, he survived, and since the Indian law doesn't allow one person to be hanged twice, he frees from Tihar Jail.  All competitors arrive in [[Cape Town]]. There, Ram meets a girl ([[Shruti Haasan]]), whose name is later revealed to be Ayesha and Tamang says she took part in the game once before. In their first game, all competitors shoot the person to their right at the same time with a pistol. Some pistols have a bullet, some don’t and all the unlucky ones die, and the lucky ones survive. Later that night, while everyone is eating at a dining table, Ram and Major Jabbar Pratap befriend each other and Raghav goes to Ayesha's room, and starts flirting with her, though Ayesha pays no attention and leaves. The second game is where all of the contestants take parachutes and jump off from a helicopter. Some parachutes open while others don't. Among the unlucky is Ayesha whose parachute doesn't open but she is saved by Ram (whose parachute opens) since he has developed a liking towards her, and afterwards, they start getting closer. In the third game, everyone is left in a hollow tank with one of everyone's hand locked with handcuffs and in front of them are 300 keys and one each will open the handcuffs and added to their trouble are the sharks that swim around them as they start opening the handcuffs as the tank sinks. Ram, Ayesha, Raghav and Major Pratap survive but Shortcut is attacked by a shark. The shark bites her leg off, and Ram jumps into the water, and saves the wounded Shortcut (who is then taken to the hospital). Later on, it is revealed that due to her leg, Shortcut will not be taking part in any of the games any more.  Before the fourth and final game, Raghav tries to rape and kill Ayesha, but the latter is saved by Ram who fights Raghav. Ayesha then runs away to Musa and Tamang, where it is revealed that Ayesha is dead and it is Natasha (her twin-sister) playing, taking Ayesha's character whilst seeking revenge on Musa, for her sister's death. But Musa finds out about this, and uses her for the final game. In the final game, Ram, on whom the bid is the highest ever, has to save Natasha before the train she's tied to hits an oil tanker while Major Singh will help him and Raghav will shoot at Ram and the other survivors try to stop Ram. On the train, Ram starts to fight Raghav, but once Raghav is knocked out on the floor, Ram goes to save Natasha, but Raghav gets up, then interrupted by Major Singh, who to save Natasha and Ram, jumps onto Raghav. However, Raghav pushes Major Singh down to the back of the train, which later explodes. Raghav then goes to Ram, who is currently untying Natasha's hands, though Raghav attacks Ram from the back, but when the oil tank reaches right in front of the train, Ram and Natasha jump off, and Raghav dies. When Ram and Natasha realise what has happened, before they lose hope, Major Singh is seen on the floor getting up, who explains that he jumped off the train a second before his side of the train exploded. The three survivors are then approached by Musa and Tamang, who claim that they won the game and claim two hundred million rupees each.  In the climax, Ram stakes his reward and challenges Musa to a game where two pistols are dug in coal the train's carrying and one has to find one and shoot the other. Musa finds both but hands one to Ram and both shoot at the same time and hit each other, Ram is shot at the place of his heart and Musa survives as he is hit at his shoulder. Though, it is shown that Ram's heart is at his right side ([[dextrocardia]]), very rare for a human, rather than left and he survives and wins back his reward. Later, Shortcut's leg is fixed by a [[prosthesis]], Major Singh saves his wife and maintains his title "Lucky Major Jawar Pratap Singh" and Ram frees him and his mother off the debts and marries Natasha.

  Brent (Xavier Samuel) is driving with his father in the passenger seat, when a bloodied man appears in the middle of the road.

Six months later, Brent is planning to attend a high school dance with girlfriend Holly (Victoria Thaine), having politely refused an offer by Lola Stone (Robin McLeavy). Brent and Holly meet up, go to Holly's  car and they have sex, seen by the now hurt Lola. Holly drives the pair on account of the car crash, and it's revealed that Brent's father died in the accident. Wracked with guilt, Brent has turned to recreational [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use and [[self-harm|self-mutilation]] with a razor blade he keeps on a necklace. Once home, his mother insists on him taking a taxi to the dance rather than ride with an inexperienced Holly. He leaves the house and goes to a nearby cliff, climbs it halfway and contemplates suicide, but then comes to his senses and climbs to the top.  While listening to music, Brent is attacked from behind and his dog attacked with a hammer. Bound to a chair, he wakes up at Lola's house sitting at a table with Lola, her father (John Brumpton), and a [[lobotomy|lobotomized]]-woman they call Bright Eyes (Anne Scott-Pendlebury). Lola's father has turned his house into a dance for his daughter. Lola takes a syringe, fills it with bleach and injects it into Brent's voice box to render him unable to scream or talk. Lola forces Brent to urinate in a cup or have her father nail it to the chair, upon relieving himself Lola threatens to bite his penis off at which time Brent kicks Lola and manages to escape outside. Lola's father chases Brent up a tree, where he and Lola hurl rocks at Brent, knocking him down. The two bring Brent back inside, and nail his feet to the floor with knives. Lola reveals via a scrapbook that she has been abducting many boys throughout her life, one victim in particular is Timmy Valentine, who Brent recognizes to be the bloody man that he swerved in his vehicle six months ago to avoid hitting and led to his Father's death. Timmy turns out to be the brother of Mia Valentine, the goth girl Brent's best friend Jamie asked to the prom. Lola then "draws" on Brent by using a fork to carve a heart with "L S" in the middle on his chest onto which she liberally throws salt.  After being crowned Queen of her dance, Lola admits to Brent that she is looking for her prince, which is not Brent as he is "just another frog". However, Lola confides in her father that he is her prince as the two dance together and almost kiss before Brent interrpts them. Afterward, Daddy lifts the carpet to reveal a secret trap door with the previous abductees still inside. Lola drills a hole through Brent's skull as they intend to lobotomize him like their other captives. But when Lola complains that the hole is too small for her to pour boiling water into, Brent manages to free himself and slashes her father with his razor-blade pendant necklace. Brent then attacks Daddy, stabbing him repeatedly in the neck with one of the knives that he pulled out of his feet. Lola jumps on Brent and tries to hit him, but Brent knocks her out. Brent then pushes Lola's dad into the pit where he watches in horror as the nearly starved captives eat Daddy. Lola gets up and throws Brent in, throwing nearby objects at him in anger. Brent finds a flashlight and hammer that Lola had thrown down which he uses to kill the abductees as they advance on him. Lola then goes and smothers Bright Eyes with a pillow, revealing that the woman is her mother.  On a hunch, Holly calls a policeman (Mia's father) in the neighborhood. When he gets to Lola's house, he sees through a window the bloody floor and chair and breaks in. In an attempt to attract the policeman's attention, Brent makes noise by throwing objects at the doors, alerting the policeman of his presence. But when he opens the doors, Lola appears behind the policeman and Brent, unable to speak, cannot say anything to warn him. Lola drives a meat cleaver into his face and the policeman falls down, dropping his gun. Brent attempts to shoot Lola, but she quickly moves out of the way where she finds Brent's necklace on the floor. She then informs Brent that she is going to go to his house and kill his mother, Carla for murdering her father, and Holly for breaking her heart. Brent notices a large pile of bones in the pit. That gives him the idea to pile up the dead bodies, and he manages to climb out.  Lola begins walking on the road with a knife and her scrapbook when she sees a car advance. It is shown to be Holly, so Lola hides and throws her book at the windshield, distracting Holly to a halt. She then attempts to kill Holly, but Holly evades Lola and a chase ensues. Brent is seen driving the police car fast, attempting to catch up with Lola. He sees Holly and nearly hits her but swerves and hits Lola instead. Holly clambers into the police car, and is shocked to see Brent. The two embrace tearfully as Lola, severely injured but still not dead, crawls to kill the pair. They hear the noise of Lola's knife as she drags herself and Brent reverses the car, striking Lola in the head and crushing her skull.  Brent and Holly arrive back home. Carla looks outside the window to see her son in a brutal state and embraces him after all the horror he has been through. The last scene shown is that of Brent's face as he is being held by Carla, looking on.

Although Josh tries to assure her that he is only trying to help a friend, Linda tells him that it was Candace's own fault for being who she is, and that he should only socialize with a higher class of people. Josh, however, keeps helping Candace anyway, to the point where he rescues her from a pimp and brings her to his home to spend the night. When Linda finds out, she gets furious and threatens to leave him unless he puts Candace out of his life for good. Conversely, Candace sees right through Linda and tells Josh that it will never work between them since they are too different: Josh actually cares about helping anyone he sees in trouble no matter their class, while Linda is a shallow and spoiled brat who considers people who have a lower status than her inferior.  Josh later runs into his friend Ellen, a former drug addict and prostitute who has now become a minister that helps other women get off the streets. After Josh asks Ellen to help Candace, Ellen gets her a job interview, but it results in sexual harassment by the interviewer, who Candace kicks in the groin before storming out. Just before Madea's trial, Ellen asks Josh how he knows Candace. He tells Ellen that they were close friends from childhood through college, but during their college years, all of Josh's friends mistreated and bullied Candace because of her background, and he started pushing her away out of embarrassment. He breaks down when he talks about one particular night when he took her to a party. He ended up going on a date and leaving Candace behind at the party, where a group of his friends gang raped her in his absence. Since then, Josh has continued to harbor deep-seated guilt. Ellen comforts him and tells him that he shouldn't continue holding on to the guilt and that it was never his fault, since Candace already had personal troubles beforehand.  At the district attorney's office, Josh's best friend, Chuck, runs into Linda and discovers that she is falsifying Candace's file to deliberately get her sent to prison and away from Josh, a practice she has been engaged with other defendants as well, including Madea. Linda blackmails him to keep his mouth shut under the threat of telling their and Josh's boss, the head A.D.A. that Chuck cheated on his bar exam to get his job. Candace refuses to show up to her case and returns to prostitution, until she is arrested by an undercover policeman. Due to Linda's falsifying of her file, the judge gives her a seventeen-year prison sentence. Linda later lies to Josh back at the office and tells him that she "tried" to be lenient, but the case was too severe. Chuck overhears this and nearly tells Josh the truth, but hesitates because of Linda's previous threat towards him.  While in prison, Madea befriends Candace, and comes to her defense when she is sexually harassed by Big Sal. Candace, Madea, T.T. (Madea's cellmate), and Donna (Candace's fellow prostitute friend) attend a class taught by Ellen at the prison, in order to have time reduced from their sentences. During a lesson about forgiveness, Madea notices that some of the inmates would rather play victim instead of taking responsibility for their crimes. She tells the class they need to stop seeing themselves as victims and forgive those who led them onto the bad paths they've been on, as they weren't the ones who ended up in jail. Candace is moved by her words, and during a visit with Josh, she admits that back when she was raped at the party he took her to, she called his name repeatedly as the attack happened, but he never came for her. Candace held on to her anger at him for so long that she forgot how to move on, which resulted in her dropping out of school and becoming a drug addict and prostitute. But with everything she learned from Ellen and Madea, she finally decides to forgive Josh and pick up the pieces of her life.  On Josh's wedding day, Chuck, serving as [[best man]], tells him that Linda falsified Candace's file. During the ceremony, Josh, appalled  by Linda's deceit, tells the congregation, including their boss, the Mayor and the Governor, what Linda has done and jilts her at the altar. Josh then rushes to the prison where he admits to Candace that he loves her and will help her get out of jail and restore her life. Because of the now-revealed news of Linda's tampering with client files, there is a public outcry and a protest movement gains momentum to set Madea, Candace, and the others free. In the end, Candace, Madea, and five other women that Linda prosecuted have their convictions overturned and are released, while Linda inevitably faces arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment on multiple charges including fraud, evidence tampering and providing false legal documents. The film ends with Candace and Josh, now a couple, walking out of the prison and sharing a kiss in front of the press.

One afternoon, Roger learns that several pieces including ''The Lonely Maiden'' are to be permanently moved to another museum in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Unable to follow the maiden, Roger falls into despair until he meets Charles ([[Morgan Freeman]]), another guard who has a similar attraction to a painting on another floor of a woman with cats.  George ([[William H. Macy]]) is also obsessed with a piece of art, a nude sculpture of a Greek warrior; he often strips down and poses naked beside it during his night shift. Using the advantages between their shifts and experience, George comes up with the idea to steal their favorite works of art and replace them with replicas. Roger volunteers to tag the artworks being shipped, while Charles and George seek assistance in replicating their favorites. Because Charles is a painter, he's able to do the cat painting perfectly, but he fails in capturing ''The Lonely Maiden''.

A panic-stricken Charlie gives chase, and they manage to successfully rescue George, who emerges from the shipping crate unclothed, much to Rose's shock.  Having pulled off the heist without getting caught, they retire from their jobs and Rose is none the wiser. On a trip to Florida, Roger is enthralled by Rose as she looks out over the ocean because she strikingly resembles the ''Lonely Maiden'' pose. Their love life is rekindled. Meanwhile, the three men hide their treasures in a shack on Charles' apartment roof so that they can go and view them at their leisure.

Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.  After learning about his past life, Harsha is rescued from the lake by a fisherman named Solomon (who is the reincarnation of Sher Khan) and, with Solomon's help, visits Udayghad. He gains access to Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's memories of the past are not revived within the day they can never be revived, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Raghuveer kills Ghora by accident. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived; she reunites with Harsha.

A nine-year-old girl named Shinko Aoki grew up hearing her grandfather’s tales of life a thousand years ago, and is able to vividly see the past. Back then, a princess named Nagiko Kiyohara lived in the same village, at a time when the area was known as the [[Suō Province|province of Suō]] and its capital Kokuga.<ref></ref> Shinko claims that her ability to see the past is a gift from the single cowlick on her forehead, which she calls her “mai mai”. Shinko invites Kiiko Shimazu, a new student who has recently transferred to her school, with her to her vivid imaginings of the past. Despite the girls' quite different characters – Shinko is an outgoing, exuberant tomboy, while the shy and city-raised Kiiko still mourns her deceased mother – they get along surprisingly well and end up learning from each other's differences.  Along with the local village boys, Shinko and Kiiko form a group known as the Destiny Squad, whose leader is 14 year-old Tatsuyoshi. The group explores the village, including building a dam for a fish in the creek, which seemingly represents their bond and hopes for the future. At the same time, Shinko and Kiiko can “see” that Princess Nagiko is lonely and yearns for friendship.   Shinko dreams one night that the Princess Nagiko is barred from friendship with the village girls. The next morning, the fish they built the dam for is found dead in the creek. The Destiny Squad vows that tomorrow will be a better day, one in which they all laugh.   Shortly afterward, Tatsuyoshi’s father, a police officer, hangs himself after gambling away a neighbor’s money with a woman. Shinko and Tatsuyoshi go off late at night to find the woman and punish her, ending up in the village’s dark side riddled with crime. Tatsuyoshi attempts to hit the woman, but gives up at the sight of the grief ravaged woman and breaks down when remembering his father. At the same time, Kiiko goes back in time and becomes Princess Nagiko, and is able to help a local girl and befriend her. Tatsuyoshi and Shinko return home, with Tatsuyoshi announcing that he is moving away the following day. He vows to be a good father one day, with Shinko advising him to have as much fun as he can before becoming an adult.   Shinko and Kiiko spend a bit more time imagining the past and learning about the village with Shinko’s grandfather. At the end of the winter, Shinko’s grandfather passes away, and Shinko moves away to the city with her family to be closer to her father’s university. In the distance, Princess Nagiko and her friend sit on a stone, enjoying the friendship that Shinko and Kiiko helped them create.

While they are visiting the intended's family, a baby next to Manu begins urinating. Manu takes a nearby tea-cup to catch the urine and prevent getting wet. Everyone sees this and his prior behavior as confirmation that he is mentally unstable. Manohar and Satish, both drunk, stop at an isolated hill top and tell one another their opinions about life; they get into a row. Satish drives off leaving behind Manohar.  Manohar walks back home and sees a van coming from a distance. The van is transporting about a dozen patients bound for an asylum. The inmates cause a commotion in the van, the guards loose order of the inmates' paperwork and photographs but the inmates are subdued by the guards. The van stops so that the guards can relieve themselves, and the patient Mahendra escapes. Manu was near the van when the guards went after the escapee. The guards notice him and take him as the escapee. Manohar is forcibly taken to the Kaamanabillu asylum.  At the asylum, Manohar demonstratively attempts to explain the mix-up but he is not believed. Soon, his family find out and go to remove him from the  asylum. An altercation between Manohar and another inmate cause the family to rethink their decision to take him away because they believe he insane. So, they decide to leave him there. Manu's life is thrown out of gear, as he realizes that he has no choice but to live the life of a lunatic, although he is not. He settles down and starts bonding with the patients: Dollar (played by [[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]] (of [[Lucia (2013 film)]] fame), who is a brilliant engineer, but considered a lunatic when one of his inventions, - a baby ass washing machine - injures a baby. He also bonds with Raju Thalikote, who is a self declared veteran of the asylum. Manu soon discloses his story to Shankrappa, who advises him to talk to Dollar, who in turn has always had an uncanny knack to escape from the asylum.  Soon, Manu manages to slip out, but during his escape, which takes him through the female wing of the asylum, he catches a glimpse of Devika (played by [[Aindrita Ray]]) and is smitten by her. Although he escapes, he changes his mind and returns to the asylum to pursue a relationship with her. As they are not allowed to mingle by the asylum staff, the inmates (under Shankrappa's leadership) hatch and execute a plan to allow Manu to meet Devika. Shankrappa is well aware of the doctors' tendency to perform the exact opposite to what he request them to do - since they perceive him to be insane - and he uses this to get them all sent for electro-shock therapy (since the EST room is within the women's wing). Dollar has manufactured a non-conducting gel which they then switch with the EST gel, so that they're not really affected by the shock. They fake syncope, and when the staff leave for a prayer assembly, they sneak out to meet Devika. It turns out that Devika is sleeping (having been given an illegal pill, by a doctor who, unbeknownst to everyone engages in (implied) sexual abuse of female inmates, using the pill). Nonetheless, Manu - with Shankrappa's assistance, carries Devika to an ambulance, and drives it out of the asylum.  Devika is a dental student who is in the asylum as she has cultivated intense misandry, after a lecturer misbehaved with her. This manifests itself as aggressive behaviour from time to time, where she stabs any man she deems dangerous. When she awakens the morning after being spirited away by Manu, she attacks him. However, Manu manages to sudbue her and professes his love to her. Devika and Manu decide to return to the asylum. On the way, at Devika's insistence, they take a temporary detour to her childhood home, where Devika has a flashback - of her uncaring father (who drove her mother to suicide). They then proceed to the asylum, but stop for the night. Manu spouts a monologue of his love for her, once she sleeps - and this is recorded by a CCTV camera that was activated accidentally by Devika, when they had hit a bump in the road earlier. The next morning, she discovers this, but while waking up Manu, unintentionally scares and nearly kills him when he falls down a railway overbridge. Manu is angry, and is about to leave her to her own devices, when she laughs at his rant, and he is smitten again. As they continue on foot (the van having run out of fuel), even as Manu pleads with her to go back (and not to the hospital). She doesn't respond right up until they go to the hospital, and convinces Manu to re-enter it.  As their relationship reaches serious levels, Devika asks Manu point blank whether he is capable of cheating her, to which the latter replies in the negative. However, once the escaped inmate (Mahendra) is caught, and brought to the asylum by the police (Mahendra is a murderer), the staff realise their mix-up. However, in front of everyone, they accuse Manu of being complicit in the charade, so that he could enjoy a free ride at the hospital. Devika construes this as Manu's betrayal, and of the disingenuousness of his love, and spurns him. A shattered Manu is thrown out of the asylum, bidding a tearful farewell to his fellow inmates with whom he had developed a bond. As he leaves, he encounters Dollar (who had managed to finally escape) returning to the asylum, claiming that there was nothing in the world worth living for outside the asylum.  When he arrives at his uncle's place however, he is once again exposed to the ridicule of people.  The movie ends with Devika encountering him near his house. It is shown that she is cured of her dementia when she remembered Manu, who helped her to let go of her painful past, and move on; when she fought back the abusive doctor, and having watched the tape again, Devika is convinced that his love for her was real. The doctors have also concluded that Manu was responsible for "curing" Devika, and she says that is why she has returned to him; but Manu says that he himself is deemed to be uncured, and insane - being laughed at by society. Devika asks him, rather nonchalantly, as to how could that be his problem, and Manu comes around - with both of them pitying society, and walking away. The final scene closes with a voice-over, of a line that Shankrappa had delivered to Manu when the latter first arrived at the asylum - "Those in this world that come to an asylum, are those who can be cured. The ones who cannot be cured at all, remain outside. There's a chance that you'll be cured of madness, which is something that others outside don't have. Wheover comes here is only temporarily mad, but the ones on the outside are permanently so."  The movie has shades of "One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest", the conundrum illustrated in "Catch-22" and also shows the 'institutionalisation' depicted in "The Shawshank Redemption". The main thrust of the movie is to show the hypocrisy of a society which classifies behaviours, and, by extension, people into 'normal' and 'abnormal'.

Malibu Shark Attack
 Heather ([[Peta Wilson]]) is the head-lifeguard on a Malibu beach, alongside her ex-boyfriend Chavez ([[Warren Christie]]), Doug ([[Remi Broadway]]) and Barb ([[Sonya Salomaa]]). Also on the beach are Jenny ([[Chelan Simmons]]), a teenage girl who is reluctantly cleaning the beach for community service after she got caught shoplifting, and Bryan (Nicholas G. Cooper), Barb's boyfriend who proposes to her. Meanwhile, a tremor unleashes a group of [[Living fossil]] [[goblin shark]]s who begin to devour swimmers along the beach. Chavez travels to a nearby house that is undergoing construction and meets with the workers Colin (Jeffery Gannon), who is Heather's new boyfriend, George ([[Mungo McKay]]), Yancey (Renee Bowen) and Karl (Evert McQueen). A warning of a tsunami arises and Chavez returns to the beach, saving Heather who had been knocked into the water by a shark after being sent to investigate some people causing trouble in the water. Doug and Barb evacuate the beach, and take shelter in the lifeguard hut with Heather, Chavez, Jenny and Bryan.  As the tsunami hits, Bryan is knocked unconscious and Jenny suffers a large cut on her leg. Heather manages to stitch the cut together; however, the blood attracts the goblin sharks, and the group realize they are stranded in the hut, with help unlikely due to the damage the tsunami has created. The sharks soon begin to attack the hut and manage to break the floor, dragging Barb out and devouring her. As the group mourn Barb's death, the construction crew have become stranded in the house where they were working. Yancey decides to try to swim to land and get help; however, she is quickly attacked and eaten by sharks. Then a shark jumps up and drags Karl into the water. Soon after, Colin and George discover a boat and begin to travel to the hut. Back at the hut, the group manage to kill one of the sharks, and Chavez swims out of the hut to retrieve a [[flare gun]]. The others attempt to distract the sharks, but one attempts to eat Chavez, resulting in him shooting and killing the shark with the flare gun, instead of summoning help.  Chavez returns, and the group move up to the roof as the sharks continue to damage the hut. Colin and George arrive on the boat and everyone boards, but the fuel soon runs out, forcing them to drift to land. After hours, the boat reaches the house that was under construction. The boat becomes stuck on a gate, so George enters the site to try to find [[pliers]] to open the gate. As the rest wait, the sharks arrive. Bryan jumps into the water, sacrificing himself so the rest can escape. Doug, Jenny and Colin manage to get into the flooded house and encounter a shark but manage to kill it, while Heather and Chavez discover a half eaten George, before taking shelter in a car, where they reconcile. Chavez kills another shark, before entering the house with Heather. The group meet up, and manage to trap and kill the final shark. In the morning, a helicopter arrives to rescue them.  
Maling Kutang
 Syamsul (Indra Birowo) and his wife Yuyun (Deswita Maharani) run an unsuccessful grocery store and are looking for a way to compete with that run by the friendly Ina ([[Kinaryosih]]), which is always full. Meanwhile, Sugeni (Arie K. Utung) is a chocolate salesman who wears a gorilla costume while working. As he is unsuccessful, his grandmother ([[Nani Widjaja]]) tells him to work as a [[transvestite]]. When this fails, the upset Sugeni throws away his grandmother's polka dot bra which he is wearing. It lands in front of Ina's shop. Ina, awakened by the noise, goes outside moments after Sugeni flees.  Yuyun, a strong believer in the supernatural, sees Ina pick up the bra and assumes that she is praying to it; she credits these prayers for Ina's successful business. She tells Syamsul to steal the bra, and the following night they sneak into Ina's home and take all of the bras there. Sugeni, meanwhile, is scolded by his grandmother for losing her bra and must find it.  The theft becomes a national sensation after it is reported, leading Syamsul to have nightmares. He attempts to throw the bra off the balcony, but is stopped by Yuyun. As they are fighting, Sugeni passes by and sees the bra before they finish their argument. That night he sneaks into Yuyun and Syamsul's home, dressed as a demon, to take the bra, but must leave after he is spotted. The following day Syamsul and Yuyun call a ''[[dukun]]'' (shaman) to [[exorcise]] their home; the ''dukun'' is actually Sugeni in disguise, and he tells Syamsul to discard the bra. When Syamsul does this, the bra is caught on a passing ''odong-odong'' (carriage). Yuyun cries out that the driver has stolen her bra, and the villagers chase the ''odong-odong'' and begin beating the driver. Yuyun, meanwhile, steals the bra.  Afraid that they will be caught, Syamsul and Yuyun begin trying various schemes to get rid of the bra. When they try to leave it in the woods, Sugeni (in his gorilla costume) follows them and tries to take it. However, two [[park ranger]]s see him and&nbsp;– thinking he is a real gorilla&nbsp;– shoot him with tranquillisers. He stumbles through the woods and takes refuge in a truck, which is on the way to Syamsul and Yuyun's shop to deliver supplies. Bakrie (Ence Bagus), the driver, delivers the boxes and, unknowingly, the bra, to the store. When Syamsul and Yuyun discover the bra, they are shocked.  They then try to throw the bra in the sea, and bury it, but nothing works. Finally they burn it. Meanwhile, Sugeni&nbsp;– who has realised that he lost the bra again&nbsp;– meets a transvestite named Alfred, who directs him to a store in [[Blok M]], where he discovers that the bra is in fact a rare model designed by Slamet Kartowardoyo. Sugeni buys a new one from the designer, but when he returns home he discovers that his grandmother has died. Sugeni then throws away the bra, and it ends up at Syamsul and Yuyun's home. The couple are now bankrupt, and Bakrie finds the bra. When Ina sees him picking it up she calls the police, who are able to unravel the whole story. Syamsul, Yuyun, and Bakrie move elsewhere, where they become rich selling bras.  A year later, their old store has been occupied by a husband and wife (Andi Soraya and Epy Kusnandar). The couple has opened another grocery store. One night, as Alfred is passing, he [[Urinary incontinence|wets himself]] in front of Ina's home and discards his [[panties]] there. When Ina tries to pick them up, the cycle starts again: the new neighbours think she is praying, and begin planning to steal the garment.  
The Marc Pease Experience
 In high school, Marc Pease ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) ran out on his performance as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] in a production of ''[[The Wiz]]'', succumbing to his stage fright despite his mentor Mr. Jon Gribble's ([[Ben Stiller]]) encouragement. Eight years later, he is dating Meg Brickman ([[Anna Kendrick]]), a high school senior who is bitter about being in the chorus and not having a principal role in Gribble's latest production of ''The Wiz''. Marc is keen for Gribble to produce the demo tape for his [[a cappella]] singing group Meridian 8 (which has already lost four of eight original members). Gribble, however, tries to avoid Marc, frustrated that Marc refuses to leave him alone because of the friendly advice he gave Marc eight years ago.  While tidying Meg's bedroom, Marc finds a tape labelled "Meg singing", but discovers after he listens to it that she is singing with Gribble, and at the end of the song, their noises suggest that they are having sex. Meg, meanwhile, begins to doubt Gribble's sincerity when he tells her what a terrific singer she is when she realizes that she is always in the chorus. Questioning whether she even enjoys singing, she decides to quit. Marc drives to a performance with Meridian 8, where the only way he can keep the group from splitting up is to lie that Gribble has given them the chance to record in a studio. After insisting that he should sing his Tin Man's song, he starts crying on stage, and is later forced to admit that Gribble has not yet responded to his request to produce the demo. That night, the opening night of ''The Wiz'', Marc is working as a chauffeur for a high school prom couple. After dropping them off and cutting off his frequently ridiculed ponytail, he arrives at the show in the interval. He unsuccessfully tries to discuss Meridian 8's demo with Gribble, who brushes him off, then learns from another bandmate that they are losing another member.  After hearing the Tin Man's song from outside the auditorium, Marc goes inside and drags Gribble out into an empty classroom. Marc confronts him about his empty promises for Meridian 8 to record in a studio. Gribble tells Marc that he is still living as if he were in high school, and an angered Marc threatens to play Meg's tape to the school principal and expose Gribble's affair with a student. As they fight, Marc accuses Gribble of denying Meg a main role as a means of revenge on him, and destroys the tape for Meg's sake. He then goes backstage and breaks up with Meg because she is too young for him. Seeing that the actor of the Wiz has injured himself, Marc takes his cape, runs onto the stage and sings the Wiz's song. Meg runs away but decides that she loves singing and returns to the stage. Marc's performance is met with cheers from the audience, and he is overjoyed.  One year later, having left exorcised his ''Wizard of Oz'' demons, Marc is working as a professional singer under the title "The Marc Pease Experience".

Mao's Last Dancer (film)
 In the era of [[Cultural Revolution|Mao's Cultural Revolution]] (in the 60s/70s), 11-year-old Chinese boy Li Cunxin resides in a rural village commune in Shandong Province, destined to labour in the fields. As often occurred in those times, government officials fanning out across the nation seeking young candidates for centralized training arrive at this school. At first bypassed but selected after a plea by his teacher during the school visit, Li seems bewildered although piqued by the gruff preliminary inspection screening at the provincial capital city of Qingdao. Forwarded to a Beijing audition for a place in Madame Mao's Dance Academy, he is admitted for ballet training based on a series of physique and flexibility examinations.  Years of arduous training follow, Li surpassing his initial lukewarm interest and mediocre performance after inspiration from senior teacher Chan (whose advocacy of classical Russian ballet as opposed to the politically aimed, physically strident form required by Madame Mao leads to the teacher's apparent banishment). Later during the course of a groundbreaking cultural visit to China, American-based English ballet director [[Ben Stevenson (dancer)|Ben Stevenson]], impressed by Li's standout talent, seeks him as an exchange student at his [[Houston Ballet|the Houston Ballet]]. Li's determined courage garners a formerly disparaging teacher to influence the Academy to allow him the opportunity for a three-month stay in the United States.  Li's encounters with US life cause questioning of the Chinese Communist Party dictates upon which he has been raised, and he begins a relationship with an aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey. Quickly attracting the attention of the local ballet scene, Li together with Stevenson requests a time extension in America, but the Chinese government refuses. Overwhelmed by the opportunities offered in America and in love with Mackey, Li is determined to stay. With legal advice that the Chinese government would recognize certain residence rights arising from an international marriage, Li and Mackey rush into a marriage. To declare personal responsibility for his decision and hopefully avoid consequences for his family and Stevenson, Li visits the Chinese Consulate in Houston. The Chinese resident diplomat forcibly detains Li in an attempt to coerce his return to China. Unknown to Li, the situation quickly evolves when the media and high level government agents both in the US and China become involved. When Li perseveres in his refusal to repatriate, the Chinese Government agrees to release him but revokes his citizenship and declares he can never return to the land of his birth.  Li and Elizabeth are set to depart for Florida but Li is persuaded to stay by Stevenson for his ballet company, dooming Elizabeth's prospects of dancing success. Burdened by this, plus concerned for and unable to communicate with his family, Cunxin continues to excel as a dancer, but his relationship with Elizabeth disintegrates and their marriage ends. Five years later, as a show of goodwill the Chinese government allows Li's parents to visit him in the US where they finally witness his performance of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' and even reunite with him on stage. Li is eventually granted permission to visit China. Together with his new wife Mary McKendry (Camilla Vergotis), an Australian ballerina, and coming back to the village of his youth, he rejoins his family and his former teacher Chan, who expresses regret that he never got to see Li perform. Li and McKendry give an impromptu outdoor ballet performance to the village's uproarious cheer.  Closing credits announce that: Li Cunxin danced in China with the Houston Ballet in 1995, a performance broadcast to an audience of over 500 million people. He and Mary McKendry now live in Australia with their three children. Ben Stevenson left the Houston Ballet after 27 years as Artistic Director.

Mary and Max
  In 1976, eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle ([[Bethany Whitmore]]) lives a lonely life in [[Mount Waverley, Victoria|Mount Waverley]], Australia. At school, she is teased by her classmates because of an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead; while at home, her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, [[kleptomaniac]] mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened [[condensed milk]]; and a [[The Smurfs|Smurfs]]-like cartoon show called ''The Noblets''. One day, while at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a [[New York City]] telephone book and, becoming curious about Americans, decides to write to one. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz's name from the phone book and writes him a letter telling him about herself, sending it off in the hope that he will become her [[Pen pal|pen friend]]. And it turns out well and finds her perfect match.  Max Jerry Horowitz ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) is a [[Obesity-associated morbidity|morbidly obese]] 44-year-old [[Jewish atheist]] who has trouble forming close bonds with other people, due to various mental and social problems. Though Mary's letter initially gives him an [[anxiety attack]], he decides to write back to her, and the two quickly become friends (partly due to their shared love of chocolate and ''The Noblets''). Due to Vera's disapproval of Max, Mary tells him to send his letters to her [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] neighbour, Len Hislop, whose mail she collects regularly. When Mary later asks Max about [[Romance (love)|love]], he suffers a severe anxiety attack and is institutionalized for eight months. After his release, he is hesitant to write to Mary again for some time. On his 48th birthday, he wins the New York lottery, using his winnings to buy a lifetime supply of chocolate and an entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the rest of his money to his elderly neighbour Ivy, who uses most of it to pamper herself before dying in an accident with a malfunctioning [[jet pack]]. Meanwhile, Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her.  On the advice of his therapist, Max finally writes back to Mary and explains he has been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]]. Mary is thrilled to hear from him again, and the two continue their correspondence for the next several years. When Noel retires from his job at a tea bag factory, he takes up [[metal detector|metal detecting]], but is soon swept away (and presumably killed) by a big [[tidal bore]] while on a beach. Mary ([[Toni Collette]]) goes to university and has her birthmark surgically removed, and develops a crush on her [[Greek Australians|Greek Australian]] neighbour, Damien Popodopoulos ([[Eric Bana]]). Drunk and guilt-ridden over her husband's death, Vera accidentally kills herself after she drinks [[Embalming chemicals|embalming fluid]] (which she mistook for [[Classification of wine#Other styles|cooking sherry]]). Mary and Damien grow closer following Vera's death and are later married.  Inspired by her friendship with Max, Mary studies [[psychology]] at university, writing her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her test subject. She plans to have her dissertation published as a book; but when Max receives a copy from her, he is infuriated that she has taken advantage of his condition, which he sees as an integral part of his personality and not a disability that needs to be cured. He breaks off communication with Mary (by removing the letter "M" from his typewriter), who, heartbroken, has the entire run of her book [[pulped]], effectively ending her budding career. She sinks into [[major depressive disorder|depression]] and begins drinking cooking sherry, as her mother had done. While searching through a cabinet, she finds a can of condensed milk, and sends it to Max as an apology. She checks the post daily for a response and one day finds a note from Damien, informing her that he has left her for his own pen friend, Desmond, a sheep farmer in New Zealand.  Meanwhile, after an incident in which he nearly chokes a homeless man ([[Ian "Molly" Meldrum]]) in anger, after throwing a used cigarette, Max realizes Mary is an imperfect human being, like himself, and sends her a package containing his Noblet figurine collection as a sign of forgiveness. Mary, however, has sunken into despair after Damien's departure, and fails to find the package on her doorstep for several days. Finding some [[Diazepam|Valium]] that had belonged to her mother, and unaware that she is pregnant with Damien's child, Mary decides to commit [[suicide]]. As she takes the Valium and is on the verge of hanging herself, Len knocks on her door, having conquered his [[agoraphobia]] to alert her of Max's package. Inside, she finds the Noblet figurines and a letter from Max, in which he tells her of his realization that they are not perfect and expresses his forgiveness. He also states how much their friendship means to him, and that he hopes their paths will cross one day.  One year later, Mary travels to New York with her infant child to finally visit Max. Entering his apartment, Mary discovers Max on his couch, gazing upward with a smile on his face, having died earlier that morning. Looking around the apartment, Mary is awestruck to find all the letters she had sent to Max over the years, laminated and taped to the ceiling. Realizing Max had been gazing at the letters when he died, and seeing how much he had valued their friendship, Mary cries tears of joy and joins him on the couch.

Outside Ultra's orbit in the  (a.k.a. the , [[Alien Zarab]] assumed the guise of an Imitation Ultraman to subdue the guards before using the Giga Battle Nizer to release the prison's only occupant: The evil Ultraman known as [[Ultraman Belial]]. While Zarab was expecting an alliance, Belial kills the alien and takes back his Giga Battle Nizer as he is confronted by a squadron of Ultras led by [[Ultraman Taro]] to contain him. But Belial overpowers them while proceeding to overpower every able-bodied Ultraman on Ultra, including his former friend [[Father of Ultra|Ken]] and his [[Mother of Ultra|wife]], as he makes his way to the Plasma Spark Tower to take the  which keeps the planet alive. As the planet begins freezing over, Ultraman and Ultra Seven shielding themselves at the last moment, Taro protects the last fragment of light to prevent the planet's complete demise. As Belial flies off, having knocked the younger Ultraman off the planet during his rampage, Mebius returns to find his world a frozen wasteland while Ultraman and Seven instruct Mebius to seek out the Reionics [[Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle#cast|Rei]].  Following their [[Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: Never Ending Odyssey|battle against Alien Reiblood]], the ZAP SPACY group have arrived on the Earth-like Planet known as Dent where Rei and his [[Gomora (Ultra monster)|Gomora]] just defeated a [[Zaragas]] when Mebius spirits Rei and appears in the form of his human guise Mirai Hibino. Mirai tells Rei the genesis of Planet Ultra: How the Plasma Spark initially created to replace M78's collapsing sun caused the evolution of the residential advanced human populace into Ultramen who used their powers to protect worlds from monsters also created by the radiation. But Belial was an exception, his temptation to gain more power from the Plasma Spark resulted in his banishment when he nearly endangered the planet. Belial ended up encountering Alien Reiblood, who fused into the Ultraman's body and further corrupted him into an Ultraman-Reionics. Belial used his ability to control hundreds of monsters with the Giga Battle Nizer to raid the Land of Light in what came to be known , nearly conquering the planet before being defeated and imprisoned in the newly created Space Prison by [[Ultraman King]] while his weapon was sealed away in Valley of Fire before it was found by Zarab. Rei agrees to aid the Ultraman in facing Belial, who has arrived to the Monster Graveyard to resurrect his army with the Plasma Spark's power.  Rei and Mirai soon land on the frozen surface of the Land of Light, ambushed on their journey to the Plasma Spark Tower by an Alien Shaplay that Belial sent with  a [[Dorako]], a Bemstar, and a [[Saramandora]] to intercept them. During the fight, Mirai's Medium Brace is damaged by the Shaplay and Rei nearly loses his Battle Nizer, but Ultraman, assuming a human form modeled after his host Shin Hayata, and Seven in his Dan Moroboshi guise come to the youths' aid as the later uses his Capsule Monsters Windam, Miclas, and Agira to defeat the Shaplay's monsters. On the way to the tower, it is revealed there is another Ultraman who can assist but Seven reveals that person was also exiled from Ultra. While the group arrived to the tower, they find themselves facing a now-revenge driven Shaplay while Rei and Gomora face a [[Black King (Ultra monster)|Black King]]. Once their opposition is dispatched, Taro gives the three Ultramen the last of the Plasma Spark's light to assume their Ultraman forms in a last ditch attempt to reclaim the Plasma Spark from Belial. Meanwhile, sent to a desert planet after almost touching the Plasma Spark when stopped by Seven, the Ultraman known as Zero undergoes training by [[Ultraman Leo]] in training armor while observed by Ultraman King.  Once at the Monster Graveyard, the Ultramen and Rei's monsters battle Belial's army with Belial sensing kinship in Rei as he pressures the human to join him.  When Reim refuses again, Belial uses his power to force the human into his Burst Mode and under Belial's control. Gomora assumes Reionic Burst Mode as it proceeds to attack the Ultramen with Seven mortally wounded. Elsewhere in the universe, the ZAP SPACY crew are searching for Rei before they are saved from an ambush by a Nurse and its Alien Zetton wrangler by [[Ultraman Dyna]] who agrees to take them to the Monster Graveyard after they learned of Rei's location from the Zetton. Dyna attempts to fight Belial while the ZAP SPACY crew snaps Rei out of his Burst Mode. After brushing off Dyna, Belial attempts to kill the humans with Seven taking the lethal attack before using the last of his strength to send his Eye Slugger to the desert planet where Zero is training. The crest-blade reached the planet just after Zero passed Leo's test when he saved the life of a Pigmon that was observing them. Both Leo and Ultraman King inform Zero that he saved the life of someone, the purpose of being an Ultraman, and they finally reveal to him that Seven is his father and that his actions were to prevent Zero from the taking the path Belial took. Casting aside his training armor while using his father's Eye Slugger as a homing device, Zero reaches the Monster Graveyard and introduces himself as [[Ultraman Zero]].  After Seven died in his arms, an infuriated Zero defeated the remaining monsters of Belial's Monster Army before battling the evil Ultraman himself. After a long and vicious battle, Zero disarms Belial of the Giga Battle Nizer and knocks him into a river of molten lava. But the souls of Belial's monsters converge on their master and form a massive exosuit-like monster called Belyudra which Belial has overpower the Ultramen. But Rei uses Giga Battle Nizer to disrupt Belial's hold over the monsters, leaving Belyudra open to attack while Zero uses the Plasma Spark's energy to give him enough power to end Belial as he falls into Belyudra as it explodes. After the Plasma Spark is restored to its rightful place, the ZAP SPACY crew become the first humans to ever set foot on the Land of Light as they bid their goodbyes to Ultraman and Mebius as Dynas decides to accompany them a bit longer as his human host Shin Asuka. As Zero is reunited with a revived Seven, the Ultras attend a moving speech by Ultraman King to remain ready for future threats that would threaten the universe. Back in the Monster Graveyard, a scarred Belial is revealed to have survived destruction of Belyudra.

McDull, Kung Fu Kindergarten
 The story begins as archaeologists discover a crudely made artifact while doing an archaeological study before the entire area was to be flooded following the construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]]. The archaeologists identify it as being made by Mak-zi (also known as "McFat"), an ancient Chinese philosopher who had invented many things, but were arguably ahead of its time - for example, a myriad of electronic devices before the discovery of electricity. However, the crudeness of the artifact has led to the artifact being rejected for every museum in China and abroad, and thus, unwilling to destroy it, the artifact was set on a barge, continuously moving along the [[Yangtze River]]. The story continues on to Mak-zi's descendant 18 generations later, McDull ([[Kwok Kwan Yin]]), a kindergartener living in Hong Kong.  Due to mounting debts from failed ventures and economic hardships, McDull's mother, Mrs. Mak ([[Sandra Ng]]), decides to leave their home in [[Tai Kok Tsui]] to find fortune in the mainland. Arriving in [[Wuhan]], Mrs. Mak, knowing that she cannot continue to take care of McDull while trying to make a living, decides to enroll McDull in the Spring Flowers Gate, a boarding Taoist martial arts academy in the [[Wudang Mountains]], while she continues to ply her trade in [[Wuhan]], [[Shanghai]], [[Suzhou]], and [[Hangzhou]]. McDull finds it hard to fit in, being ostracized by his peers at the academy due to being a Hong Konger. However, a mysterious Brother Panda ([[Anthony Wong Chau-sang|Anthony Wong]]) encourages him to get closer and make new friends with his peers.  McDull eventually gets used to being liked by his friends, but when news of a prestigious martial arts competition, the International Kindergarten Martial Arts Competition, is to take place, nearly all of the students consider leaving the academy, McDull included. On the way down the mountain (as the mountain itself has no modern conveniences), McDull intends to call his mother to tell her that he was quitting the academy, but after a talk with the master's assistant ([[The Pancakes]]), McDull learns about his master's plight: the headmaster had been a martial arts prodigy, mastering all forms of Chinese martial arts before the age of 20. When a published article by international action star Pruce Lee (a play on [[Bruce Lee]]) that claims that Chinese martial arts was on decline and was more suited for show than actual combat, the headmaster had respectfully disagreed. A war of wards was exchanged, and the two agreed to a match together. However, because of the political situation in China at the time, the battle, which would be later known as "The Battle of [[Luohu]]", was held at the [[Sham Chun River]], the border between Hong Kong and [[Shenzhen]]. The two battled all night, but the match was eventually stopped by a Zen master. Returning home, the headmaster had strongly believed that he had lost the encounter, and thus went into seclusion, trying to modernize Taoist Kung Fu with little success. He then turned his attentions to opening the Spring Flowers Gate, taking on the guise of Brother Panda to get new recruits and to comfort students at the academy. McDull, moved by his sacrifices, decides to return to training, and calls his mother to tell her to attend the competition.  Eventually, the day of the competition arrives. While at the competition, McDull notices his friend from Hong Kong, May, who had enrolled in a "wire-fu" summer camp sponsored by [[Yuen Woo-Ping]], also competing in the contest. Meanwhile, the headmaster has also received a revelation: at the competition, the headmaster of a rival school greets him, stating that he was a student of Pruce Lee. He goes on to state that Pruce had thought highly of the headmaster, and believed that the headmaster had won their encounter. Because of this, he had spent his last years extensively studying Taoist martial arts, and had written a book about the subject, which was dedicated to him.  Meanwhile, the Mak-zi artifact had wound up at the site of the competition, and, in front of a large televised audience just as McDull's match was about to begin, the artifact suddenly comes to life, revealing to itself as a crudely made clock in the shape of a chicken powered by cow feces which could count 100,000 years, 100 years at a time, using a complex holographic system. Inspired by the sight before her, Mrs. Mak decides to move back to Hong Kong to start a new business. McDull, having been beaten up badly in the competition, also returned to Hong Kong, having discovered Mak-zi's original blueprints for the clock in the meantime. Having returned home, McDull proceeded to build a new clock using the blueprints as a guide.  The story is concluded by a flashback from an adult May, who had gone on to become an office worker, suddenly noticing McDull's clock in the sky. Taking a break from her mundane life, she traces the clock to its location, and find a quaint restaurant in the middle of Hong Kong's concrete jungle, run by the adult McDull.  Throughout the film, viewers were also treated into various stories involving Mak-zi, in a [[pseudo-documentary]] style, narrated by [[Wan Kwong]].

Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus
 Off the coast of [[Alaska]], oceanographer Emma MacNeil ([[Debbie Gibson|Deborah Gibson]]) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental [[sonar|sonar transmitters]] into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant [[shark]] and [[octopus]] are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of [[Japan]] is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to [[Point Dume]], [[California]], MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a shark’s tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water.  A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders ([[Sean Lawlor]]), who believes it belonged to a ''[[Megalodon]]'', an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada ([[Vic Chao]]), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeil’s submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a [[gigantic octopus]]. MacNeil reflects on the [[polar ice cap]]s melting due to man-made [[global warming]], and wonders if the creatures are mankind’s “comeuppance”. Meanwhile, a U.S. "[[destroyer|naval destroyer]]"  engages the megalodon, but is destroyed after its guns fail to destroy the shark. MacNeil, Sanders, and Shimada are arrested by a team of soldiers and taken to government official Allan Baxter ([[Lorenzo Lamas]]), a rude and racist man who demands their help in destroying the creatures. The three agree to help, in exchange for the government trying to capture the creatures for study rather than destroy them.  While working at a naval laboratory to develop a method for luring the creatures, MacNeil and Shimada become attracted to each other and have sex in a utility closet. The incident makes them realize they can attract the creatures using chemicals. MacNeil and Sanders agree to place a trap for the shark in [[San Francisco Bay]], while Shimada returns to [[Tokyo]] to attract the octopus. MacNeil and Sanders barely escape the shark after placing the trap with a mini-submarine. The plan fails, however, when the shark destroys another destroyer sent by Baxter. The shark then resurfaces and bites off a large portion of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], killing many civilians on the bridge. Later, Shimada contacts the Americans and says the Japanese trap, having the same disaster, only succeeded in angering the octopus, which has escaped despite multiple artillery and missile hits. Baxter suggests using [[nuclear weapon]]s against the creatures, which MacNeil, Sanders, and Shimada strongly oppose due to the risk of marine devastation, coastal damage and human casualties. As an alternative, MacNeil suggests using the same pheromone traps to create a “[[Thrilla in Manila]]” by drawing the two creatures together. She believes that because the two creatures were frozen in ice locked in combat, they must be natural rivals and their aggressiveness towards one another will cause them to fight to the death if they're lured together. MacNeil, Sanders, and Baxter are assigned to a submarine to find the shark and lure it to the [[North Pacific Ocean]].  After a short search, the submarine brings both the shark and the octopus to an ice trench off the Alaskan coast, where MacNeil first encountered the creatures. Sanders himself ends up piloting the sub after the original pilot loses his nerve and pulls a gun on the captain ([[Dean Kreyling]]) before he is overtaken. The octopus and shark begin to fight, Giant Octopus, wraps around Mega Shark, and tries to suffocate him. Mega Shark bites the tentacles to get free. They separate. Mega Shark attacks the submarine. dragging it in its mouth. MacNeil, Sanders, and Baxter man a mini-submarine and detach just as the shark bites the larger submarine in half, killing the rest of the crew. The shark nearly destroys the mini-submarine, but they are saved when a Japanese sub with Shimada on board fires torpedoes at it. The octopus entangles the Japanese submarine and nearly destroys it, but the sub is released after the octopus is attacked by the shark. The two creatures engage in a fierce battle, at the end of which, the octopus strangles the shark after the shark dismembers some of its tentacles, causing it to bleed to death. The two sink, dead, still locked from their battle.  McNeil and the others, after watching the showdown between the two monsters, discover Shimada and his sub survived the octopus attack. The film ends with MacNeil, Sanders, and Shimada deciding to visit the [[North Sea]] after receiving infrared images of mysterious organic life there.

The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)
 In a short prelude, U.S. Army General Hopgood is painfully thwarted in an attempt to pass paranormally through a solid wall by simply running into it. The film then follows ''[[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] Daily Telegram'' reporter Bob Wilton, whose wife leaves him for the newspaper's editor. Seeking an escape, Bob flies to [[Kuwait]] to report on the [[Iraq War]] and to prove to his wife and himself that he is a man. However, he stumbles onto the story of a lifetime when he meets a retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] operator, Lyn Cassady, who reveals that he was part of a U.S. Army unit training [[psychic]] [[espionage|spies]] (or "[[Jedi]] Warriors") to develop a range of [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] skills including [[invisibility]], [[remote viewing]], and phasing. The back story is told mainly through [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]].  In 1972, Army officer Bill Django, after accidentally falling out of a [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|"Huey"]] helicopter in [[Vietnam]]'s [[Bình Dương Province]], found his newly recruited men to be unable or unwilling to fire on a female [[Viet Cong]] soldier before she shot him in the chest. He then underwent a fact-finding mission prompted by a vision where the Viet Cong soldier says, "their gentleness is their strength."  The bulk of Django's mission immersed him fully into the New Age movement so that, when he returned to [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, in 1980, he had long braided hair and a tattoo of a [[third eye]] surmounted on a pyramid on his chest.  Facilitated by the credulous General Hopgood, Django led the training of a [[New Earth Army]], with Lyn Cassady and Larry Hooper as his top students. The two quickly developed a lifelong rivalry because of their opposing views on implementing the New Earth Army's philosophy. Lyn wanted to emphasize the teachings' positive side, such as the ability to resolve conflict peacefully, whereas Larry was more interested in the "dark side" and its military applications.  Prompted by a doodle in Bob's notebook (of an eye on a pyramid), Lyn takes him into Iraq.  They are kidnapped by criminals who want to sell them to insurgents but escape with fellow hostage Mahmud Daash. They are rescued by a private security detail led by Todd Nixon. The trio flees when the detail is caught in a firefight fiasco with another American security detail.  Bob and Lyn then continue on Lyn's alleged "mission", stating he had seen a vision of Bill Django.  After taking the wrong fork in the road their car is disabled by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]].  The other fork in the road actually leads to al-Qaim, Lyn's destination, but neither of them was able to read the Arabic on the roadsigns. Bob and Lyn wander in the desert where Lyn reveals that he had stopped a goat's heart to test the limit of his mental abilities and believes this evil deed has cursed him and the rest of the New Earth Army. It's also revealed that Hooper conducted an unauthorized [[LSD]] experiment which resulted in a soldier killing himself, and therefore forced Django out of the Army.  Eventually, Bob and Lyn are rescued and rehabilitated at a camp run by PSIC, a private research firm engaged in psychic and psychological experiments on a herd of goats and some captured locals. To Lyn's dismay, Larry runs the firm and employs Django, now a depressed alcoholic. Bob spends time with Django and learns the ways of the New Earth Army. They spike the base's food and water with LSD and free both the goats and captured locals, in an attempt to remove the curse. Following this, Lyn and Django fly off in a helicopter, never to be heard from again, disappearing into the sky "like all [[shaman]]s".  Bob returns to work as a reporter and writes an article about his entire experience with Lyn. However, he's frustrated in that the story's only portion to be aired on the news is how the captives were forced to listen to the ''[[Barney & Friends]]'' theme song for 24 hours. This dilutes his story to the level of a joke, and Bob vows to continue trying to get the bigger story out. In the film's final scene, Bob exercises his own psychic abilities and, following some intense concentration, stands up and runs headlong through a solid wall in his office.

His friend, a financial adviser, is trying to convince him to sell the land, but it is later revealed that it's for his own convenience.  One day John discovers a secret door in his barn, where he finds a strange scarecrow.  After placing the mysterious scarecrow in the field, his luck changes, but this also activates a horrific curse that started it all.  While crops begin to grow, he begins to find dead birds in the field as well as a mysterious little girl who continues to appear out of nowhere. At the same time, his troubled marriage begins having more  complications.  Several people begin dying, including the financial adviser (after he makes a move to have John's farm repossessed) and a friend of John's who tries to hit on his wife, trying to convince her to leave John.

John begins to believe that the scarecrow is the source of his issues and burns it, at the cost of missing his therapy session with his wife, damaging their relationship further. He goes to Jude for advice, instead seeing his wife, Miranda, who he had seen stripping before. Miranda gives him some tea, which she has laced with drugs.

Middle Men (film)
 In 2004 [[Houston]], Jack Harris drives with several million dollars in a duffel bag  to deliver to Russian mobsters, worried about the safety of his wife Diana and their children.   In 1997 [[Los Angeles]], Jack has a reputation for solving problems, and helps a sick friend co-managing a nightclub. Wayne Beering and Buck Dolby are best friends renting together. The drug-addicted friends are discussing pornography and Wayne asks why you cannot buy porn on the internet. Buck, a former [[NASA]] scientist, takes 15 minutes to create a program to allow online credit card transactions to charge people for looking at porn on their website. They earn thousands of dollars in a matter of days. Needing more porn they approach Nikita Sokoloff, a Russian mob boss who owns a local [[strip club]], who agrees to 25% of their business in return for letting them photograph and film his strippers.  Buck and Wayne's website is successful and they party in [[Las Vegas]] while neglecting to make payments to Sokoloff. Jack has made the L.A. nightclub a success and attracts the attention of Jerry Haggerty, a crooked lawyer hired by Wayne and Buck to sort out their problem with Sokoloff. Jack meets the friends and becomes a partner in the business, but not wanting to be a pornographer recommends they instead they become middle men and take a cut of the money transfers. Jack pays off Haggerty $200,000, knowing Haggerty is under federal indictment and a threat to the business.  Sokoloff's nephew comes to collect his $400,000 profit, but when he threatens to kill Jack's family, one of Jack's body guards punches his head so hard that he starts bleeding from his ear and falls dead. Jack and his partners dump the body in the ocean and fabricate a story that Sokoloff's nephew took the money and ran. Sokoloff is skeptical, but agrees to let it pass in return for an increase to 50% of the partnership.  Jack expands the business by focusing on the online credit card billing services. They create a billing company called "24/7 billing.com", becoming the titular Middle Men for other internet-based porn providers. The billing business is making hundreds of millions of dollars within a year. Jack becomes addicted to the money, sex and power of his new lifestyle, spends little time with his Houston family and starts a relationship with porn star Audrey Dawns.  Haggerty, bitter that Jack cut him out of what has become a multimillion-dollar partnership, schemes to take over the company. He manipulates the foolish Wayne and Buck to work with Denny Z, providing billing services for Denny's websites which include [[child pornography]].  Audrey's live stream porn site is watched by an international web of terrorists, which the US government uses to track and arrest or kill the terrorists. The FBI asks for Jack and Audrey's help to expand their terrorist hunt, but Wayne and Buck fear that Jack is meeting with the FBI to turn them in for the murder of Sokoloff's nephew and the child porn. The two confide in Haggerty about killing Sokoloff's nephew, which Haggerty uses to incite Sokoloff to make a move on Jack.  When Jack finds out that his partners are helping facilitate Denny Z's child porn, he confronts Denny Z at a house party. Jack sees Audrey having sex with two men at the party and realizes how much he misses his family, leading him to break up with Audrey.  An FBI agent, appreciative of the help Jack has given the government, warns him that 24/7billing.com is about to be indicted for supporting child porn. Jack's life is further complicated when Sokoloff's men kidnap his maid's son, who they believe is Jack's son. Jack gathers up several million dollars and goes to meet Sokoloff, as seen at the start of the film.  Jack is told that the boy will be released if he signs a contract giving his partnership share to Wayne, Buck, Sokoloff, and Haggerty. Jack signs the agreement but asks to backdate it six months, claiming he wants to avoid taxes. Sokoloff kills Haggerty, but lets Jack go in recognition for all the money he has made him.  Jack's FBI contact charges, Wayne and Buck with providing billing services for child porn. Jack avoids charges having sold the company before the crime. Sokoloff flees the country. Jack and the maid's son return home, and Diane welcomes Jack back.  
Micmacs (film)
 A young boy named Bazil loses his military father, who is blown up while attempting to defuse a [[land mine]] in the Western Sahara.  Thirty years later, Bazil ([[Dany Boon]]) is working in a video rental shop in [[Paris]] when a stray bullet from a shoot-out in the street enters his forehead.  Doctors save him but decide against removing the bullet, though it may kill him at any moment, for fear of damaging his brain further.  Bazil returns to his workplace to find that he has been replaced. As he leaves, his replacement gives him a shell casing that she found from the bullet that had struck him.   Bazil, who has miming and sign language talents, becomes a homeless busker until he is taken in by a man named Slammer ([[Jean-Pierre Marielle]]) to Tire-Larigots, a shelter carved under a mountain of recycling material.  Bazil is befriended by the other scavenging dwellers: Elastic Girl ([[Julie Ferrier]]), a [[Contortion|contortionist]], Mama Chow ([[Yolande Moreau]]), who feeds and mothers the crew, Remington ([[Omar Sy]]) a former [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] from Africa who speaks entirely in old-fashioned language clichés, Buster ([[Dominique Pinon]]), a former [[human cannonball]], Tiny Pete (Michel Crémadès), an artist who designs moving sculptures from scavenged trash, and Calculator (Marie–Julie Baup), a young woman who measures and calculates things with a glance.  Slammer himself is a former convict who miraculously survived an execution by [[guillotine]].  While scavenging for trash, Bazil discovers the offices and factories of the firms that manufactured the landmine that orphaned him and the bullet he was shot with, on opposite sides of a street. He enters the latter to ask for compensation but is thrown out violently on orders of CEO, Nicolas Thibault de Fenouillet.  He then infiltrates the other company and manages to hear a speech by its CEO, François Marconi.  Bazil follows Marconi home and hangs a microphone down his chimney. He hears a phone conversation arranging a meeting between Marconi and associates of Omar Boulounga, an African dictator seeking arms for an upcoming violent conflict. Mama Chow demands to know what Bazil is up to and the crew decides to help him exact revenge on the two arms dealers. They first incapacitate Boulounga's men by planting drugs on them in an airport.   Remington, claiming to be Boulounga's right-hand man, meets with De Fenouillet and proposes the same deal which was offered to Marconi. Later, Remington calls each of Marconi and De Fennouillet and angrily cancels the deal. He tells Marconi that he will be dealing with De Fennouillet, and tells De Fennouillet that he will be dealing with Marconi. The two CEOs are furious and declare war on each other. Bazil and his friends break into Marconi's house and steal and replace his luxury cars, and steal De Fenouillet's collection of body-part [[relic]]s from historical persons. They also steal and destroy a truck full of bombs from Marconi's plant. Marconi assumes that De Fennouillet is responsible, and arranges to sabotage a machine causing a massive explosion in De Fennouillet's factory. Next, Elastic Girl breaks into Marconi's apartment searching for blackmail material while Bazil waits and listens on the roof.   Marconi arrives unexpectedly, and Elastic Girl is forced to hide in the refrigerator. De Fenouillet sends an armed team to attack Marconi, but Boulounga's men arrive first and take him hostage. Boulounga's men are about to execute Marconi when they are shot by De Fennouillet's men.  De Fenouillet is, in turn, about to murder Marconi when a henchman captures Bazil on the roof and brings him down.  The two executives recognise him and figure out what has happened.  They decide to take Bazil to a safe house in order to question him.  Elastic Girl comes out of her hiding place, and calls in the rest of the crew to rescue Bazil. After a car chase through Paris, Bazil is saved and Marconi and De Fennouillet are captured. The two CEOs are bound and hooded, and they hear a long plane flight followed by a ride in a car. When they are allowed to see again, they are in the middle of the desert. In a scene inspired by [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'',<ref name="dvdcommentary"/> De Fennouillet is sitting on Marconi's shoulders with a live grenade in his mouth, while Marconi stands on a live land mine. A small crowd wearing desert outfits sit watching them, holding photographs of landmine victims. The men beg for mercy and confess to supplying arms to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], and [[War in Darfur|Darfur]] combatants.  Marconi and De Fenouillet fall and discover that the grenade and mine are not armed. The small audience is revealed to be Bazil and his friends in disguise, who have been recording the event with a video camera. In a flashback inspired by [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Mission Impossible (film)|Mission Impossible]]'',<ref name="dvdcommentary"/> we see that Bazil and his friends simulated the entire plane flight with various sound effects, and the desert setting is simply a clearing in a Paris suburb. Bazil and Calculator upload their video to [[YouTube]], and Marconi and De Fenouillet are publicly disgraced. Bazil and Elastic Girl become a couple.  
The Milk of Sorrow
 The film begins with a song sang by an elderly woman who lies dying in her bed. She describes her own rape and the death of her husband. At the end of the song, she slowly passes away while lying next to her daughter, Fausta (Magaly Solier). It is assumed that Fausta has grown up on stories of the horrors that occurred during the conflict between Sendero Luminoso, a leftwing guerrilla group, and the Peruvian government. This has left Fausta with a crippling fear of men and rape. To dissuade any attempts of rape, she has placed a potato in her vagina. Throughout the film, this potato begins to impact her health yet she continues to refuse to allow the doctors to remove it. In the aftermath of her mother's death Fausta and her family do not have enough money to take her mother's body back to their village for burial. Fausta takes work in the home of a wealthy pianist, Aída (Susi Sánchez) who is struggling to complete a new piece in time for an upcoming recital. When the pianist discovers that Fausta has a knack for writing her own songs, Aída encourages her to complete a song for her by offering a string of pearls in exchange. Fausta desperately needs this money in order to pay for her mother's funeral and agrees. The night of the recital, Aída performs Fausta's song to a roaring applause. On the way back to her home after the recital, Fausta comments about the positive reception that her song received. Aída responds by kicking Fausta out into the dark streets of Lima by herself.   The night after her cousin's wedding, Fausta's uncle comes into her room and frightens her while she sleeps. He begs her to live her life and not waste her days in a state of never-ending fear like her mother did. At the end of the film, Fausta decides to go through with the operation to get the potato removed and buries her mother near the ocean. It is implied that Fausta will move on with her life, leaving her fears behind her.

The movie is set in 2007, taking place before or right after the first part of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''.  A quote from Hive Division states:  <blockquote> "Philanthropy explores ideas such as genetics, which is a recurring theme in the ''Metal Gear'' series; memetics, the study of how culture, habits, and information evolve, expand, how it is used and abused." </blockquote>  Parts two and three were planned for a release in 2014, but due to licensing issues with Konami it was announced to be cancelled. The first twelve minutes of Part 2 are viewable on the network.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/2jvye8/mgs_philanthropy_new_trailer_bad_news/</ref>

Miss March
  The movie begins with Eugene ([[Zach Cregger]]) and his best friend Tucker ([[Trevor Moore (comedian)|Trevor Moore]]) as kids. They sneak into the bedroom closet of Eugene's brother, as he recently acquired a valuable Michael Jordan rookie card.  Upon opening the box the card was in, Tucker notices that Eugene's brother has an issue of ''[[Playboy]]''.  Tucker opens the magazine, instantly becoming obsessed with it. Three weeks later, Tucker's demeanor has changed to that of a hormone driven teenager, despite that he is only 8 years old. Fast forward ten years later, Eugene and Tucker  are seniors in high school.  Tucker is still a huge fan of the [[Playboy Enterprises|Playboy franchise]], while Eugene and his girlfriend of two years, Cindi Whitehall ([[Raquel Alessi]]) are public speakers on the subject of abstinence for younger teens. Despite this, in reality, Cindi has other plans, stating that since they have been together for two years, if she is not Eugene's first then they have big problems.  They decide to go through with it at the after prom party that Tucker had invited them to. On the day of prom, Tucker tells Eugene that he has the limo booked, which when pulls up, has already picked up Tucker's high school drop-out friend, Phil, who now goes by the MC name of Horsedick.MPEG ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]). At the After Prom party, Cindi goes upstairs to prepare, while Tucker takes Eugene into the kitchen and gives him several shots of hard alcohol. As Eugene leaves to go upstairs to meet Cindi, he walks through the wrong door, and falls down the steps into the basement. He is hurt so bad, that he falls into a coma for four years.  After Tucker wakes Eugene with a baseball bat, he tells him that Cindi stuck around for a little while, but disappeared shortly thereafter because Eugene was "a vegetable." Tucker left Eugene to continue his recovery as Tucker went to work. He came back later to visit Eugene again with the newest edition of Playboy. While discussing where Cindi had vanished to, Tucker happened to stumble across a centerfold in his new issue of none other than Cindi. Tucker devises a plan to go cross country to the Playboy Mansion where there was a party to be held in 3 days for Playboy's annual Birthday bash, where Cindi was sure to be. Tucker left as he had a date with his "partner" of 13 months, Candace ([[Molly Stanton]]), who back in high school seemed to hate Tucker.  Later that night, Tucker broke into the hospital while Eugene was asleep, stating they had to leave on their trip now, as opposed to 3 days later, as Tucker had an incident involving Candace and accidentally forgetting she has [[Photosensitive epilepsy|seizures caused by strobe lights]] as a side effect of her epilepsy.  Starting out on the road trip, the two are attacked by Candace's brother, Rick (Geoff Meed), and his firemen crew, but manage to escape temporarily.  Once in Chicago, they meet up with their old friend MPEG, who has become a famous rapper over the four years.  They all hop on board his party bus and begin to trek across the country towards the Playboy Mansion. After an argument between Horsedick and Eugene, Tucker and Eugene were both thrown out of the bus in the middle of nowhere, and left to walk the rest of the way.  Just as it seemed all hope was lost, a car pulled up with two lesbian women. They make a deal where the boys will drive while the girls are in the back with each other having sex.  They make it all the way to the Mansion only to be stopped by bouncers at the door. Moments later, several fire trucks arrived, in search of Tucker.  Tucker and Eugene manage to sneak into the mansion dressed in fireman outfits.  The two go in separate directions while outside, Candace forces her way into the mansion, followed up by her brother, Rick.  Tucker randomly hits on several Playboy models and meets PMOY 2007 [[Sara Jean Underwood]] and makes his way to the Grotto. Eugene, in search for Cindi, is suspected of being a stalker and is taken into a secure holding area, but not before being spotted by Cindi.  Meanwhile, Tucker runs into Candace and darts back into the mansion, where he is spotted by the firemen. After avoiding the firemen, he tries to hide in the mansion and suddenly finds himself face to face with [[Hugh Hefner]]. Hugh and Tucker have a discussion about Tucker's issues, telling Tucker about the first woman he ever fell in love with (who to Tucker's dismay, was not as good looking as the Playboy Bunnies of modern day, and had apparently died at a young age). Hefner tells Tucker that "there is a bunny in every woman," and that if Tucker can only see the "bunny" in those women, that he's on to something.  Back in the holding area, Cindi comes in to see Eugene.  Eugene seems disgusted to see her, claiming that she left him behind and didn't care about him, and accusing her of sleeping with countless other men. Cindi argues that she did still love him and proves it by telling Eugene that the money she made modeling and being a Playboy Bunny was sent to help pay for Eugene's hospital bills, something Tucker never bothered to mention due to his absent minded nature.  Just at that moment, Hef had called to have all stalkers removed from the mansion. Once tossed out on the streets, Candace finally caught up with Tucker.  Tucker apologised for his faults and promised to look past hers and Candace decides to give him another chance.  At the same token, Eugene runs into Horsedick.MPEG, who promised to "rip Eugene's face off."  Eugene seems too distracted regardless to find Cindi.  After Cindi comes out and reveals that MPEG was born without genitals, his right-hand man realizes that he's never seen MPEG in action with a woman. At that moment, his crew pulls down his pants, showing nothing but two straws where his genitals should be, confirming what Cindi said.  MPEG leaves ashamed, and after Eugene and Cindi make up, Hef lets everyone back in.  Eugene and Tucker find themselves in the Mansion's kitchen, and Eugene tells Tucker that Cindi is waiting upstairs for him, shades of the situation that started the whole mess in the first place.  And just like 4 years previous, Tucker and Eugene take several shots together before Eugene goes upstairs, where he finally has sex with Cindi. In the unrated version, footage show Eugene and Cindi having sex. As going too fast he overexerts himself.

She is tranquilized by the military and awakens in a top secret [[Area 51|government facility]] that houses monsters of which the public are ignorant. She meets General W.R. Monger, the [[U.S. Army|Army]] officer in charge of the facility, and her fellow monster inmates: Dr. Cockroach PhD, a [[mad scientist]] who became half-human, half-cockroach after an experiment; B.O.B. (Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate), a brainless, living mass of blue goo as a result of a food flavoring mutation; Insectosaurus, a massive mutated bug standing 350 feet in height, and the Missing Link, a prehistoric 20,000 year old fish-ape hybrid who was thawed from deep ice by scientists. Susan herself has been renamed to Ginormica.  In a mysterious spaceship in deep space, an alien overlord named Gallaxhar is alerted to the presence of quantonium, a powerful energy source on Earth, and he sends a robotic probe to retrieve it. The probe later lands on Earth where the [[President of the United States]] attempts to make first contact with it.

Moon (film)
 In the near future,<ref>A computer screen shows a date of 2035 in one scene towards the end.</ref> Lunar Industries has made a fortune after an oil crisis by building Sarang Station, an automated lunar facility to mine the alternative fuel [[helium-3]] from lunar soil, rich in the material. The facility is [[Post-scarcity economy|fully automated]], requiring only a single human to maintain operations, oversee the harvesters, and launch canisters bound for [[Earth]] containing the extracted helium-3. Sam Bell nears the end of his three-year work contract at Sarang Station. Chronic communication problems have disabled his live feed from Earth and limit him to occasional recorded messages from his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left. His only companion is an [[artificial intelligence]] named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation and provides comfort for him.  Two weeks before his return to Earth, Sam suffers from hallucinations of a teenage girl. One such image distracts him while out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his [[lunar rover]] into the harvester. Rapidly losing cabin air from the crash, Sam falls unconscious.  Sam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY having what appears to be a live chat with Lunar Industries management. Lunar Industries then orders Sam to remain on base and informs him that a rescue team will arrive to repair the harvester. Suspicious, Sam manufactures a fake problem to persuade GERTY to let him outside. He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds his unconscious [[doppelgänger]]. He brings the double back to the base and tends to his injuries. The two Sams start to wonder if one is a [[Human cloning|clone]] of the other. After a heated argument and physical altercation, they coerce GERTY into revealing that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell. GERTY activated the newest clone after the rover crash, and convinced him that he was at the beginning of his three-year contract.  The two Sams search the facility, discovering a secret vault containing hundreds of hibernating clones. They determine that Lunar Industries is unethically using clones of the original Sam Bell to avoid the cost of new astronauts. The older Sam clone drives past the interference radius in a second rover and tries to call Tess on Earth. He instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died "some years ago." He hangs up when Eve tells her father (offscreen, identified as "Original Sam" in [[closed captioning]]) that someone is calling regarding Tess.  The two Sams realize that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. The newer Sam convinces GERTY to wake another clone, planning to leave the awakened clone in the crashed rover and send the older Sam to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports. But the older Sam, having learned that the clones are [[Planned obsolescence|designed to "break down"]] at the end of the 3-year contract, knows that he will not live much longer. With his health declining, the older Sam suggests that he be placed back into the crashed rover to die so Lunar Industries will not suspect anything, while the younger Sam escapes instead.   Following GERTY's advice, the younger Sam reboots GERTY to wipe its records of the events. Before leaving, the younger clone reprograms a harvester to crash and wreck a [[Radio jamming|jamming]] antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth. The older Sam, back in the crippled rover, remains conscious long enough to watch the launch of the transport carrying the younger Sam to Earth. The rescue team is successfully fooled after finding both a newly awakened clone in the medical bay and the corpse of the older Sam inside the crashed rover.  The helium transport arrives at Earth, and over the film's credits, news reports describe how Sam's testimony on Lunar Industries' activities has stirred up an enormous controversy, and the company's [[business ethics|unethical practices]] have plummeted the company's stock.  
Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space
     One night, an [[unidentified flying object]] (UFO) appears on Earth and drops a strange green goo into a large [[pumpkin]] field. The owner, Farmer Jeb ([[Peter Ramsey]]), comes outside to investigate, but is captured by something off-screen.  Meanwhile, Susan ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) and her monster friends prepare for [[Halloween]] celebrations; Missing Link ([[Will Arnett]]) practices scaring, and B.O.B. ([[Seth Rogen]]) tries to decide what he will be for Halloween. Dr. Cockroach ([[Hugh Laurie]]) however has no interest in Halloween because of a childhood trauma on that same night. Their prospect of Halloween is cut short when General Monger ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) tells them that aliens have been detected in [[Modesto, California]] and orders them to investigate. At Farmer Jeb's patch, pumpkins are mysteriously being given away for free, with one family taking the largest one.  That night, Susan and the monsters visit her parents, who have prepared for Halloween eccentrically. The monsters investigate the suburbs for aliens while Susan investigates the patch. Doc then uses his scanner on various people, Link tries to scare people (getting mistaken for [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] at one point) and B.O.B. has trouble remembering what to say when walking up to houses for candy. Doc's interest in Halloween is suddenly rekindled when an old lady presents him with a swirly pop.  At a house belonging to the family that bought the largest pumpkin from the pumpkin patch, the pumpkin, nicknamed Wicked Jack ([[Rainn Wilson]]) by the family's son, comes to life and attacks the family. At the patch, Susan discovers that all the pumpkins have also come to life, a result of saturation from the green goo. All the pumpkins in the suburbs come alive and attack the children, prompting Doc, Link and B.O.B. to protect them. B.O.B. attempts to reason with one of the pumpkins, but fails. Doc discovers that the pumpkins are not after the children, but their candy and that the more they eat, the bigger they will get.  At that moment, Wicked Jack emerges, now a giant pumpkin and assumes leadership of the Mutant Pumpkins. B.O.B.'s bungling leads the pumpkins to the Murphy house, the place with the most candy. The children and monsters rally against the aliens just as Susan turns up, but Wicked Jack fuses himself with the other pumpkins to become an even bigger giant. The monsters' attempts to defeat Wicked Jack seem to prove futile until Doc realizes from seeing B.O.B. suffering from indigestion that they must overfeed the pumpkins with candy to bloat them up. He helps by making a [[Gatling gun]] platform for that purpose.  All the candy is eventually used up, allowing Wicked Jack to recover. Doc realizes he must give up his swirly pop, which he does, to push Wicked Jack to indigestion. At that point, Susan's parents come outside and are shocked to see the whole thing. Susan sucker-punches Wicked Jack's head off, allowing him to escape until she whistles for Butteryflyosaurus (dressed as [[Elvis Presley]]) to destroy him. All the candy that had been consumed by the pumpkins comes out unscathed, including Doc's swirly pop, which he gives to a young girl. Susan's parents also admit that they will have to get used to sharing her with the whole world.  Unnoticed, a surviving pumpkin tries to sneak away but is found by Link, who scares it into exploding. General Monger arrives to congratulate the monsters as well. But, in a [[twist ending]], some of the green goo from the pumpkin Link scared saturates a planting of carrots, [[Night of the Living Carrots|causing a mutant carrot to be formed]].

The movie closes with a scene of Joo-hwan at a burial site where he leaves a photograph of K and Cream as well as Cream's recorder, which contains a recording Cream made for K telling him to wait for her on the other side so that they can be together with "no more tears". The grave is revealed to be Cream's, thus implying that she committed suicide.  
Mother (2009 film)
 An unnamed widow lives alone with her only son, selling medicinal herbs in a small town in southern [[South Korea]] while conducting unlicensed [[acupuncture]] to the town's women on the side. Her son Yoon Do-joon is shy, but prone to attack anyone who mocks his [[intellectual disability]]. She dotes on him and scolds him for hanging out with Jin-tae, a local ne'er-do-well. When Do-joon is nearly hit by a car, he and Jin-tae vandalize the car and attack the driver and passengers as revenge. Jin-tae blames Do-joon for the damage done to the car, and Do-joon is sued. The debt causes Mother to struggle.  Late at night, Do-joon follows a high school girl named Moon Ah-jung into an abandoned building. The next morning, she is discovered dead on a rooftop, shocking the residents and pressuring the incompetent police to find the killer. Only circumstantial evidence places Do-joon near the scene of the crime. The police happily arrest the boy. He is then tricked into signing a confession, and faces a long prison sentence. Mother, believing him to be innocent, tries to find ways to prove he is not the murderer. However, she is unsuccessful, as the lawyer is unreliable.  Mother visits Jin-tae, who tells her that nobody should be trusted, as Ah-jung's body was placed from a point where everyone in the town could see it. Mother fires her lawyer and asks people around town about Ah-jung. They mention she was nicknamed, "the rice cake girl," and that she liked boys. She was in a relationship with a boy who escaped a [[sanatorium]] known as "Crazy JP."  Do-joon is seen beating another prisoner who calls him "retard." Mother visits him about the matter, and Do-joon recalls a memory of Mother trying to kill him with rat poison when he was 5. Mother tries to apologize, saying she wanted to [[euthanasia|free them both]] and offers to give him acupuncture to forget his pain, but he tells her not to see him again. She breaks down and is taken away.  Mother learns from a camera-shop worker that Ah-jung had frequent nosebleeds. Ah-jung's friend is attacked by two boys who are looking for Ah-jung's phone, but Mother rescues her. She pays Jin-tae to interrogate the boys, who confess that Ah-jung used her phone to secretly take pictures of the boys she slept with. These boys all gave her rice cakes in exchange. In his cell, Do-joon remembers seeing a man in the building the night of Ah-jung's death. He identifies one of the pictures on Ah-jung's phone; that of a white-haired elderly man. Mother remembers the man as the junk collector she bought an umbrella from when she was walking in the rain earlier. She goes to his home and asks him about what happened.  He says that he went into the abandoned building (presumably to sleep with Ah-jung, as he is seen gathering rice as payment to her), and he saw a distraught Ah-jung followed by Do-joon. Do-joon curiously asked her questions, but she threw a rock at him and calls him "retard." Do-joon, instinctively attacking those who mock him, threw the rock back at her, which hit her head. He then dragged her to the rooftop. Do-joon is the one responsible for Ah-jung's death, leaving Mother horrified.  When the junk collector learns that Do-joon will be released and the case will reopen, he decides to report that Do-joon is guilty. Mother, fearing for her son, beats the collector to death and burns his house down.  Later, the police tell Mother that they found the "real" killer. He is Crazy JP, who had clothing with Ah-jung's blood on it. While it's possible the blood was from her nosebleeds, the police deduce that it was attempted rape. Feeling guilty, Mother visits JP and cries for him, knowing he is charged for a crime he didn't commit.  Do-joon is freed from prison. He investigates the junk collector's burnt house. During dinner, he says that whoever dragged Ah-jung to the roof was probably trying to alert others so they could help her quickly. As Mother departs to a bus station to go on a trip, Do-joon shows her acupuncture kit, which he found at the burnt site, and Mother tearfully leaves with it. On the bus, she gives herself acupuncture to forget her pain, and dances with the other passengers.

Mr. Nobody (film)
 In 2092, humanity has conquered mortality through the endless renewal of [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The world watches in fascination as the 118-year-old Nemo Nobody, the last mortal on Earth, edges towards death. Curious to know of life before quasi-immortality, they interview Nemo. Dr. Feldheim, a psychiatrist, uses [[hypnosis]] to help Nemo recall some of his memories, while Nemo relates other memories to a journalist. As he is prodded, Nemo makes contradictory statements. He recounts his life at three primary points: at age 9, when his parents divorced, at age 15 when he fell in love, and at age 34 as an adult. All three unfold into their many possible outcomes.  Nemo explains that before birth, children remember everything that will happen in their lives. At the moment of conception, the Angels of Oblivion erase their memory. The Angels, however, forget about Nemo, allowing him to "remember" different possible futures for himself. At age 9, at a railway station, he is forced to choose as his mother leaves on a train while his father stays on the platform. In one case, he manages to board the train while in another he stays with his father.  ===Life with mother=== A rebellious Nemo lives with his mother and her new partner, Harry, in Montreal. He sees a new girl, Anna, in his school and is immediately smitten. One day on the beach, Anna asks if he would like to swim with her and her friends. Nemo insults her friends and they barely see each other again.  In an alternate story line, Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together and fall in love. Anna turns out to be Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to [[New York City|New York]] with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a [[Swimming pool service technician|pool cleaner]], hoping to run into Anna by chance. They finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.  In a different storyline, Anna and Nemo are married with children. Nemo works at a [[television studio]] narrating educational videos. One evening, while returning home, he hits a bird, loses control of his car, plummets into a lake and drowns.  ===Life with father=== Nemo stays with his father, who later becomes [[disabled]]. He works in a shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a [[Science fiction literature|science fiction story]] about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an accident and is hospitalized in a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]]. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of his fingers on the typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.  In yet another alternate timeline, Nemo speaks with Elise at her house, and learns that she is still in love with her boyfriend, Stefano. Nemo does not back down and keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of the story line, Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding. Nemo keeps her [[Cremation|ashes]], having promised her to spread them on Mars. In a far future, Nemo carries Elise's ash to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface. Aboard the spacecraft traveling back to Earth, he meets Anna. Before they can say much to each other, the ship is destroyed by meteoroids. In an alternate version of events, he works at the same television studio but his assistant drowns instead. The assistant's widow is Anna, whom he recognizes. Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from [[borderline personality disorder]] and chronic depression. She has attacks of [[hysteria]] and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.  Alternatively, after being rejected by Elise, Nemo resolves to marry the first girl who will dance with him at the school prom. That night, he dances with Jeanne. While taking her home, Nemo pledges to marry her and be successful. Despite being successful and having two children, Nemo is unhappy and bored with his life. Nemo writes over all his possessions to Jeanne and leaves his family. Now making all of his decisions randomly via coin toss, he goes to the airport, and pretends to be a passenger named Daniel Jones and is taken to a hotel by a waiting [[chauffeur]]. At Jones' hotel room, Nemo is murdered while taking a bath, and his body is dumped in the woods.  Running throughout all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by [[Argyle (pattern)|argyle patterns]]. This setting seems artificial, like a movie set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player hooked up to a television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.  ===Epilogue=== Before his death, Mr. Nobody tells the journalist that neither of them exist. They are figments in the mind of the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as he was forced to make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the choice at all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The [[expansion of the universe]] comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.

Mulan (2009 film)
 In 450 A.D., the [[Northern Wei|ruling Chinese dynasty]] is under constant threat from the [[Rouran Khaganate|Rouran]] tribes. The Chinese army conducts a nationwide draft. A retired soldier named Hua Hu insists on enlisting again to serve his country. [[Hua Mulan]] ([[Zhao Wei]]), his young daughter, is quite intelligent and skilled in various martial arts. But because she is a woman, she cannot enlist. Mulan tricks her father, steals his armor and weapon, disguises herself as a boy and enters the Wei army in her father's place. She is recognized by her friend Xiaohu, who agrees to keep her secret.  Through the harsh military training, Mulan proves to be quite courageous, quick-thinking, and unstoppable, always helping others fend off the army bullies. She gains the attention of Wentai ([[Chen Kun]]), the battalion's Sub Commander. They soon befriend and develop a mutual fondness and liking for one another.  One night, when Wentai is taking a bath in a hot spring, he accidentally runs into Mulan. After a brief skirmish, Mulan escapes without exposing her identity. However, Wentai becomes determined to uncover the woman hiding among the troops. To make things worse, the army bully loses a jade pendant and a strip-search is ordered. Terrified to reveal herself as a woman and tarnish her father's reputation, Mulan admits that she committed the theft.  In prison, she tells Wentai the truth and he promises to keep her secret until the very end. When the Rourans launch a surprise attack, Wentai releases Mulan from jail, but Mulan stays back to fight. Her life is spared and she is also promoted to be a sub-commander. Eventually both Wentai and Mulan become generals.  Wentai and his men are ambushed, and Wentai orders Mulan to stay behind to guard the army's supplies. Afraid for Wentai, Mulan delegates the order to another soldier and follows him. The men guarding the supplies are then ambushed in turn, and Mulan is devastated at the deaths she has caused. Wentai reminds her not to become emotionally invested on the battlefield. When she asks whether he would have done the same for her, Wentai says, "I wouldn't." When Mulan wishes to leave the army and no longer serve as a general, Wentai reminds her that none of them wish to fight and that she must do her duty regardless.  After another battle, Xiaohu returns to inform Mulan that Wentai has died but asked her to remain strong. Devastated, Mulan turns to drinking and stops training her troops. Xiaohu confronts her and demands that she do her duty, at which point Mulan regroups and leads her army to many successive victories. It is revealed that Wentai is in fact alive, and that he and Xiaohu are keeping this secret so that Mulan can remain emotionally unattached and strong.  Unhappy that the Rouran tribes have not joined forces to create a powerful army to fight against the Wei forces, the greedy Prince Mudan murders his own father to seize the throne for himself.  Mulan's troops then fight strongly against the Rourans, but many, including Mulan, are injured in a volley of arrow fire. Suddenly, a huge [[dust storm]] known as the Poison Dragon appears, and everyone on the battlefield is consumed by it. When they regain consciousness, Mulan is reunited with Wentai and she orders a retreat back into the closed canyon. Mudan wants to see how Mulan copes without any provisions and sets up a siege at the entrance of the canyon. Mulan is very sick, but is kept alive by Wentai, who gives her his own blood to drink as the provisions of water have run out.  When Mulan realizes that the Commander-in-Chief isn't bringing his troops and they have been left to die, she prepares her troops to fight to the death for their country. Wentai goes to the front line and announces he is the 7th Prince of Wei, and offers to be taken prisoner in return for Mulan and her soldiers' freedom. Mudan takes him prisoner and delivers provisions and medical supplies to Mulan and her troops.  Leaving her soldiers to return home, Mulan disguises herself as a Rouran woman and infiltrates Mudan's camp to save Wentai. Secretely meeting with the Rouran princess, she reveals her gender as a woman and tells her that she would help her fulfill her dream to stop the war and have peace. Mudan announces that the Wei emperor has agreed to Wentai's ransom and celebrations initiate. During the celebrations, Mulan assassinates Mudan with the help of the Rouran princess and returns to the Wei capital, where she at last reveals herself as a woman. As Mulan asks to only return to her village to take care of her ill father, the emperor announces the engagement of the Rouran Princess and Wentai to bring peace to the two empires. Back at Mulan's hometown, Wentai visits her to ask her to run away with him, but Mulan chooses the country of China over their romantic relationship. He respects her decision, and the two share a long passionate embrace before Wentai departs.  The movie ends with Mulan saying, "Someone once said, go too far from home and you will lose your roots. Kill too many people, and you will forget yourself. If you die in battle, your life will sink into the ground like rain and vanish without a trace. If at that time, you fall in love with someone, hope will blossom again from the earth and embrace life passionately. Thank you, Wentai."  
Murder Collection V.1
 The film's opening explains that in 1994 a [[web series]] called ''Murder'', which broadcast footage of actual deaths and acts of violence, appeared. After being active for four months, ''Murder'' was shut down by the authorities and had all of its content confiscated, though the website's host, a man known only as Balan, evaded capture. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to share more clips that he has unearthed, while also offering commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible [[new media]] has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan querying, "I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity.

Yes it can."  * '''Bludgeoning:''' A drunk Russian man accidentally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's [[webcam]]. * '''The Heist:''' A restaurant's security system records a robbery committed by four gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back. * '''The Cheat:''' In front of a stationary camera a man reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all of the good times that they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else.

 On [[Valentine's Day|St. Valentine's Day]] 1997, a cave-in traps six miners working in the Hanniger mine in the town of Harmony, a rural mining community. Six days later, rescuers recover a comatose [[The Miner (character)|Harry Warden]] alongside his five co-workers, whom he killed to conserve his own oxygen. Teenager Tom Hanniger is blamed for the incident due to his forgetting to vent the [[methane]] lines.  The following year, Warden, dressed in a gas mask and mining suit, goes on a murderous rampage. He murders multiple partying teenagers in the mine, but Tom, girlfriend Sarah, and friends Axel and his girlfriend Irene survive the ordeal. Ten years later, in 2008, Tom inherits the mine after his father's death and returns to Harmony after a decade-long disappearance. He finds Sarah working as a manager of her family's grocery store, married to Axel, now a police officer, and with one son.  Axel goes to his father's abandoned home in the woods to have a sexual rendezvous with Megan, a young clerk at Sarah's store. Tom checks into a motel, where Irene is having sex with Frank, a trucker. She discovers Frank has filmed their sexual encounter, and chases him into the parking lot. He is killed with a pick-axe by a man in a gas-mask and mining gear. The masked killer then murders Irene and the hotel manager.  Axel arrives at the crime scene and finds Irene's body with her heart missing; Tom becomes a suspect. At the police station, Axel receives an anonymous heart-shaped box with Irene's heart in it. The next day, Tom has an encounter with the killer at the mine. James Burke, the former sheriff, confesses to Tom that he, Tom's father, and Ben Foley, a local politician, killed and buried Warden after his 1998 murder spree, and had the crime covered by the local police. To prove it, he takes Tom to the site where Warden was buried, but they find an empty grave.  Ben is murdered by Warden, and discovered in Warden's grave with his heart missing. Sarah and Megan are attacked by the killer, and Megan is murdered; Axel and Sarah discover her body with its heart missing, and the phrase "Be Mine 4 Ever" scrawled in blood. Sarah tells Axel she is aware of his infidelity. The killer later infiltrates the Palmer house, killing their babysitter, Rosa, and Burke.   Sarah leaves with Tom; Axel, convinced Tom is the killer, calls to warn Sarah, saying that Tom has been institutionalized for the last seven years. Alarmed, Sarah makes the car crash and flees into the woods. She hides in Axel's father's abandoned house and discovers empty heart-shaped boxes, and a high school photo of her with Tom. She runs into a mine and is confronted by Axel and Tom. Wresting Axel's gun from him, she holds them both at gunpoint. Tom confirms he is the killer.

My Life in Ruins
 Georgia ([[Nia Vardalos]]) is a [[Greek American]] teacher who came to Greece to teach at a local college about Classic Greece. However, budget cuts caused her to be laid off and forced her to get a job as tour guide. She believes she has hit rock bottom when she loses her passion in everything.  Informed by her boss, Maria (Bernice Stegers), that she ranks poorly as a guide because the tourists think she's boring, Georgia finds herself leading a tour around Greece with an assorted group of misfit tourists whom she believes is a failure since they seem to care more about buying T-shirts than learning about history and culture. Instead, she wishes to have a good group of Canadian tourists whom seems to be more engaged in history and culture than wanting to go shopping for souvenirs and hang out at the beach. Maria disagrees with Georgia's assessment, informing her that they are more interested in Nico ([[Alistair McGowan]]), a rival male tour guide also working for Maria because he's engaging in tours.  As Georgia's tour departs, her driver is injured in an accident and is replaced by another driver, Poupi ([[Alexis Georgoulis]]).  In a [[clash of personalities]] and cultures, everything seems to go wrong and Georgia is on the verge of quitting as she can't connect with the group to get them to appreciate Greece and its culture. This is made worse when she voices her disgust with Maria for favoring Nico over her in letting his group stay in better hotels than her group. After being ignored again, Georgia decides to send a letter to inform her that she's quitting at the end of her tour and Maria can find another tour guide more tolerant to her and Nico.  One day, an older traveller named Irv Gideon ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]), helps Georgia see why she can't connect with the group: she finds them annoying and is bored with her current job. Therefore, he shows her how to have fun and teach her how to be more engaging to the tourists. This helps Georgia learn more about the current group of tourists she has and open her eyes to the different places where they come from. In doing so, she also teaches them the origins of the [[Olympic Games]], which they take genuine interest in. While they become more immersed in Greek culture, Poupi begins to show interest in Georgia. However, Georgia's antics distract him while driving, and he narrowly avoids causing an accident on the road. At the hotel they're staying at, Georgia's female members of her group manages to stall a hurt Nico as Georgia, Irv and Poupi secretly sabotage his tour bus by stealing the air conditioning from it to install in her own bus. As the group begins to enjoy themselves at the beach, Irv becomes sick and they take him to the hospital. Georgia is unsure if she should continue and is concerned for Irv's health until Poupi encourages her to do so.  During her group's tour of the [[Parthenon]], Georgia tells them why she likes coming there because at the right time, she could feel the wind from the ruins. While his own group looks around, Nico confronts Georgia and her group. Georgia realizes she ended up with the better group when he reveals that without air conditioning on his tour bus, Nico got a serious headache from having to hear his group complaining the entire time and he never bothered getting to know them. When Nico openly insults his group in front of Georgia and her group by calling them Americans, the Canadians are offended by this and start trying to beat him up. Georgia and her group visit the hospital where Irv is recovering well. At night when the group is celebrating the farewell party at a Greek buffet, Maria confronts Georgia for the letter and convinces her to stay with a promise of a raise after she produces the review logs with good reviews with her current group of tourists. She even admitted that she was glad Nico quit since she never liked being around him and only tolerated Nico because she knew his parents very well. Georgia begins a relationship with Poupi.

Mystery Team

Somehow, the trio have remained as naïve as ever, although they are about to graduate from high school. They have continued the same mindset and antics even though they are teenagers, focusing on children's infractions, although adults (such as their parents) wonder when the teens will grow out of this attitude.  To prove to themselves and the town at large that they can be "real detectives", the Mystery Team take it upon themselves to solve a double homicide when they are hired by a young girl named Brianna ([[Daphne Ciccarelle]]) to discover why her parents were killed. Although Duncan and Charlie are reluctant to help her, Jason convinces them to help to her, stating that it is their chance to prove they can be real detectives and earn everyone's respect. Then they meet Brianna's older sister Kelly ([[Aubrey Plaza]]), whom Jason becomes attracted to, who tells them to let the cops handle it. They ignore her, and go to the local grocery store, where they are told by their friend Jordy ([[Bobby Moynihan]]) that a hobo named Sam may know something. They are given stuff from Kelly's house from Sam and find a card from a local bowling alley with a symbol engraved in it. They go to the bowling alley where they meet a clerk, who has a grudge against them and refuses to scan the card. However, they spot a guy named Dougie, who the card belongs to, and see that he's wearing Kelly's ring. They follow Dougie to a local gentlemen's club were the bouncer attempts to throw them out for spying on Dougie and a stripper with him. However, they escape from the bouncer and Duncan and Charlie overhear Dougie saying that someone named Leroy gave him Kelly's ring and the ring is now in the stripper's vagina. Jason, Duncan and Charlie then retrieve the ring from the toilet the stripper urinated it into and escape from the gentlemen's club before the bouncer catches them.  After returning the ring to Kelly, they go back to Jordy, who tells them about Dougie and who Leroy is. Leroy Maddox ([[Peter Saati]]) is a dangerous drug dealer who used to work at the local lumber yard. After learning his address at the lumber yard, they go to his house claiming to want to buy drugs from him. Jason sneaks away and hears Leroy arguing with someone on the phone about finding some papers. After going to Kelly's house to find the papers, he finds Kelly and they both find a paper that states something called Iphedolene is extremely toxic. However, Leroy, who becomes suspicious of Duncan and Charlie, shows up at Kelly's house and takes them hostage but they manage to escape. After Kelly thanks Jason, who promises to tell everything to the police, he, Duncan and Charlie return to the lumber yard, where they find Leroy and his girlfriend's dead bodies. A horrified Duncan then decides to give up, despite Jason's objections. He and Charlie then reveal to Jason that they are going to college and leaving him, as he didn't apply. After a fed up Duncan and Jason get into a fight, he and Charlie abandon Jason. After going to talk to Kelly and Brianna, their dad's friend Robert Finney ([[Glenn Kalison]]), who they have been staying with since their parents' death, helps fix his damaged bike. However, Jason realizes that Robert was the one he heard arguing with Leroy on the phone and quickly leaves.  After going to a police officer, who tells Jason he needs proof to believe him, he goes to the Holden and Charles Corporation, where Robert works and Kelly's father worked, but not before attempting to warn Kelly about Robert on a walkie-talkie he gave her, not knowing that Robert has it. At Holden and Charles, Jason bonds with two employees Jim and Frank, who get him drunk and give advice on asking Kelly out. After sneaking into Robert's office, Jason learns that Robert is trying to treat wood with the toxic substance Iphedolene. Kelly's father, who was lawyer, learned this and was going to ruin the company and Robert, which is the reason Robert hired Leroy to scare him, not kill him. When Leroy kept asking for money, he killed him too. Duncan and Charlie, who heard Jason talking about Robert on a walkie-talkie, also show up to help him. The three are then confronted by Robert, but they manage to escape. After Jason makes up with Duncan and Charlie, Robert, who has taken Kelly hostage, uses the walkie-talkie to contact them into bringing the papers to the lumber yard.

Every year St Bernadette's [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school in [[Coventry]], where he teaches, competes with a local [[Protestant]] [[private school]] (Oakmoor) to see who can produce the best [[nativity play]].  Paul hates Christmas because his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Lore ([[Ashley Jensen]]), who attended drama school with him, left him at Christmas before he could propose to her. Despite this, the St Bernadette's headteacher Mrs Bevans ([[Pam Ferris]]) tasks him with running their nativity play this year, and gives him a new class teaching assistant called Mr Poppy ([[Marc Wootton]]), who turns out to be as much of a child as the rest of Paul's class.  As every year, it is one of Paul's other friends from drama school, Gordon Shakespeare ([[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]]), who runs the nativity plays at rival school Oakmoor. Determined not to be seen as a failure by his old rival, Paul lies to Shakespeare about how a [[Hollywood]] producer—their old friend Jennifer—will be turning his production into a Hollywood film, though he hasn't even spoken to her in five years. Mr Poppy accidentally overhears this and is so excited that he has to spread the rumour. Soon, Paul finds his lie is out of control, and all he can do is go along with it as media attention mounts and the children get more and more excited.

Halfway through, jealous Gordon Shakespeare climbs on stage to tell everybody that there is nobody from Hollywood there and the entire story was a lie. Luckily, a helicopter flies over and Mr Poppy declares that it's Hollywood come to see the play; the show continues, and Jennifer and her film producer boss finally come in at the back to watch the end, joined by Paul, who is still in love with Jennifer and kisses her.The play is a success, and everyone, including Shakespeare, is reunited onstage to celebrate the children's success.  As the film closes, Paul and Jennifer are shown decorating his house together for Christmas, reunited at last.

New York (film)
 In the [[United States]] in 2008, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] arrest Omar Aijaz ([[Neil Nitin Mukesh]]) after finding guns in the trunk of a taxi cab he owned. Omar, a young Muslim man originally from [[Delhi]], is then taken into custody and interrogated by [[FBI]] Agent Roshan ([[Irrfan Khan]]), also a Muslim man originally from South Asia who has been living in the United States for twenty years. Omar then discovers that he was set up by the [[FBI]] in order to force him to spy on a former college friend, Sameer Shaikh ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), whom he has not seen in seven years and who the FBI believes is a terrorist. In the process, Omar discovers that Sam has married Maya ([[Katrina Kaif]]), a mutual friend whom Omar had a crush on in university and finds out that Sameer and Maya have a young son, Danyal (Aidan Wagner).  Roshan orders Omar to tell him everything he knows about Sameer. The film then flashes back to September 1999, when Omar begins his studies at the New York State University. He is befriended by his [[international student]] counselor Maya and learns that though she was born and raised in New York, she is fluent in [[Hindi]] because of her mother's interest in [[Bollywood]] films. Omar also meets Sam, another [[Indian American]] who is also Muslim and fluent in Hindi due to the fact that his father is a professor of [[India]]n studies. Over the next two years, all three become inseparable friends and gradually Omar falls in love with Maya. When Omar realises that she loves Sam, however, he distances himself from them both. Their carefree days finally end with the onset of [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].  After finishing his story, Omar agrees to help Roshan (rather reluctantly), if only to prove that both he and Sam are innocent. He reunites with Maya and Sam and stays in their house, all the while spying for the FBI. Omar learns that Maya is a civil rights activist who is helping one of Sam's employees, Zilgai ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) overcome his experience as a former [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|9/11 detainee]]. Zilgai was eventually released due to lack of evidence and has been having difficulty adjusting back to "normal" life.  As time progresses, Omar feels satisfied that he can find nothing to warrant the FBI's suspicions and is ready to leave when a series of events forces him to reconsider. In the process, Omar learns from Sam that ten days after 9/11, Sam was arrested and detained for a period of nine months as a suspected terrorist, a charge which everyone, including the FBI and Roshan, now agree was incorrect. Though he was eventually released due to lack of evidence, the impact of being detained and tortured permanently changed Sam in ways which are difficult for those surrounding him to understand, leaving him with feelings of deep resentment towards the FBI. Omar thus finds that Sam ultimately resorted to plans for terrorism as a means of revenge.  In addition, Maya is unable to help Zilgai resolve the trauma of being a detainee. After a routine traffic stop escalates and an NYPD police officer gives Maya a very rough full-body search, Zilgai becomes agitated. He drops Maya at her home and eventually kills the police officer the same night. After being declared a fugitive, Zilgai leads the police on a long chase ultimately ending in his suicide.  The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the film rests upon the attempts of Maya, Omar, and Roshan to prevent Sam from committing an act of terrorism by telling him that if he perpetuates towards terrorism, others will suffer as he has. Finally convinced, Sam surrenders and aborts his attempt to bomb the FBI building. However, the moment he drops his cell-phone (which was originally intended as a detonator for the bomb) he is shot and killed by FBI snipers. The cell phone falls benign to the ground without activating anything. Maya, who was running toward Sam, is also killed by stray gunfire and Omar, bereft of speech, breaks down. Six months later, he is comforted by Roshan who explains to him that; everybody was right in their place, but the timing was wrong. As for Sam, the path he chose killed him. Everybody has moved on after 9/11, as its high time. Omar has adopted Danyal, and Roshan has received commendation for aiding in the anti-terrorism cause. They reconcile each other. The film ends with all three of them going out for pasta and a side note describing the [[Post-9/11|after effects of 9/11]].  
The New Daughter
  John James ([[Kevin Costner]]), a recently divorced novelist, moves into an old house in rural [[South Carolina]] with his teenage daughter, Louisa ([[Ivana Baquero]]), and young son, Sam ([[Gattlin Griffith]]). John and Louisa's relationship is strained; she accuses him of having never loved her mother and ruining everything. On the family's first night in the house, Louisa hears strange noises outside her bedroom window. Unseen by her is a humanoid creature lurking outside on the roof. The following day, while exploring the surrounding fields and forest, the children come across a large mound. Louisa is instantly attracted to it, but Sam is reluctant to go near it. In town, John learns that his house is locally infamous for the disappearance of a woman who lived there. Upon returning home, he finds Louisa's pet cat mutilated near the house.  Louisa returns to the mound after school and, while relaxing in the sunshine, hears strange noises. As Louisa hears what sounds like approaching animal growls, the film jump-cuts to John cutting his hand while washing dishes. That night John finds a trail of muddy footprints leading from the open front door to the bathroom. Louisa is inside with the door locked, sitting in the tub as the shower washes her extremely muddied body. The muddy water is shown turning red with blood as it reaches the drain. Later that night, John finds Louisa [[sleepwalking]]. When he takes her back to bed, he finds a strange doll made from straw, inside which is a dark ball containing a live spider. The next morning Louisa comes down for breakfast wearing a short black dress and make-up. When John asks her about the doll, she claims not to have seen it.  Louisa is bullied by a preppy girl in the staircase of their school. Meanwhile, at home, John comes across a pile of muddy clothes in her bedroom. While investigating outside the house, he finds the head of Louisa's doll at the mound, and the bloody remains of a blackbird. John is called to come to pick up Louisa, who says she does not feel well. In the infirmary he passes the preppy girl, who had apparently "fallen" down the stairs and injured her arm. Sam's teacher, Cassandra ([[Samantha Mathis]]), gives John her phone number, offering her friendship. He is later startled to find a nest of spiders in the kitchen drawer where he'd placed the straw doll. That night John sees Louisa emerging from the woods, even though he had previously ordered her to be home by dark. He calls attention to scarring visible on the skin around her neck, but Louisa storms off without explanation. At dinner she eats in an animal-like manner, as if starved.  John contacts Cassandra one night, and they meet sociably. While John is away, Louisa hears noises outside the house and exits. As John is returning home in his car, he sees a shadowy figure running through the woods in front of the house, which vaguely looks like Louisa. He exits his car and follows sounds of animal growls, but growing fearful, he rushes back to his car. A stone hits his window and he speeds back to the house. Asking Louisa if she'd been outside, she says no. He orders her not to go near the mound any more.  The next day, John's agent drives up to the house and they talk about the house. Inside, Sam is directed by Louisa to climb the ladder to the attic. Sam falls when frightened by animal noises there. He requires stitches, and John berates Louisa for not caring for her younger brother. That night, John searches the internet, finding an article about burial mounds. He telephones an expert on the subject, Professor White ([[Noah Taylor]]), but is ignored. He then researches the previous owner of the house, Sarah Wayne; she disappeared one day without a trace, after having locked her teenage daughter Emily in her bedroom from the outside. Emily was eventually found alive and went to live with her grandfather, Roger Wayne ([[James Gammon]]).  John leaves the children with a babysitter and goes to find Roger Wayne. As Louisa watches him drive away from her window, scarring can be seen on the nape of her neck. She then returns to the mound. John arrives at Roger Wayne's empty house, but lets himself in and looks around. In the girl's room he finds a strange nest made from twigs and straw, and a depiction of the burial mound drawn onto a wall with the word "home" below it. Roger arrives and confronts John with explanations of what had occurred with Emily, that he burned down his house with her inside, insisting that it wasn't his granddaughter anymore.  While John is away, the babysitter is locked out of the house, as animal growls are heard approaching. Sam hides in his room as he hears the babysitter's cries for help. John arrives home, comforts a frightened Sam, and rushes to Louisa to ask what happened to the babysitter. She says she does not know. After reporting the babysitter's disappearance to police, John takes an ill Louisa to bed. She tearfully asks if he's going to leave her as her mother did. He tells her he never will. That night, John dreams of a doorway on top of the burial mound and Louisa transforming into a creature who announces "I'm your new daughter". The next day he finds a nest in Louisa's closet similar to the one at Roger's house. John calls a contractor to destroy the mound that day. Professor White, having called back to ask about the mound, suddenly arrives and pleads with John to wait. He tells John of an ancient civilization who worshiped the burial mounds, believing them to be the homes of ancient Gods, or "mound-walkers". He mentions a ritual exchange of gifts — including small straw dolls, as John had found — and the mound-walkers' search for a young girl with whom to mate and give birth to a new generation of deities to reclaim the earth. Horrified by this, John instructs the bulldozer to start. When it digs into the mound, the body of the babysitter is uncovered. Louisa, meanwhile, in the schoolyard, is scraping the ground with her fingers. John is taken to the police station for questioning while Cassandra looks after the kids.  That night, as officer Ed Lowry ([[Erik Palladino]]) drives John home, they are attacked, and Lowry is dragged from the patrol car by a creature. John continues home, discovering it in disarray and finding Cassandra with her throat slit. She dies while motioning toward Louisa standing in the doorway.  John gathers the children to leave, but Louisa refuses. Mound-walkers begin attacking the house, and John kills three. After the attack, Louisa is missing. Her screams can be heard coming from the mound. John leaves Sam in his room, tells him to wait for the police, and tells him "be a big boy". John goes to the mound to rescue Louisa and finds a tunnel leading into it. He pierces a can of gasoline, sets explosives left from the postponed demolition by the tunnel entrance, sparks a flare for light and crawls inside. Louisa is found unconscious and covered in mud. As he carries her out, angered creatures howl and give chase. Meanwhile, Sam has exited the house, clutching a framed family portrait and looking into the dark toward sounds coming from the mound.  John escapes the mound with Louisa and blocks the tunnel with the leaking fuel canister, but another mound-walker is already there outside. Louisa collapses and begs her father not to leave her. John looks down at her and sees her beginning to transform into one of the creatures. He drops a flare into the leaking diesel fuel and the mound goes up in a huge explosion. As Sam watches, the flames are reflected on the glass of the frame. A figure is seen emerging, although its identity is unclear. Sam asks, "Daddy?", as shadows can also be seen moving in the trees and house behind him. A growling creature emerges directly behind him as the screen goes black.

Night Train (2009 film)
 A man runs through a forest carrying something.  A nearly deserted train pulls into a station and two conductors get out, take a stretch, and kill time as no one seems to board.  Just as the train is about to depart, the running man calls out, runs to the train and seems to want to board.  He does not speak and, assuming that perhaps he does not know English, the conductors let him on with the intention of getting his money later. He joins two of the only five passengers who appear to be on the train at that point. One of the passengers, an inebriated salesman named Pete (Steve Zahn), offers the man a drink.  Downing a mouthful of pills, the man washes them down with the vodka. Soon after the man dies as a result of ingesting Seconal, combined with alcohol, which causes his heart and lungs to stop working.  Upon this discovery, Pete and another passenger, med student Chloe (Leelee Sobieski), locate the head conductor Miles (Danny Glover) and alert him to what has happened. Miles intends to call the authorities at the next stop, but Pete discovers a mysterious object in the box the dead man was carrying and, peering inside, is intrigued. Chloe also looks inside the object and both, immediately convinced that there is a liberating fortune inside, scheme for ways to keep it. They suggest the idea to Miles, who tells them they're crazy, and takes the object and the box it was in back to his office purportedly to keep it safe and call the authorities, but he too peers inside and his will is overcome.  With a crazed Chloe taking the lead, the three decide to dispose of the man's body and keep the treasure for themselves. Their only problems now are keeping anyone else from finding out, warding off the other suspicious passengers as well as the other conductor and keeping a close eye on one another, as paranoia takes hold and the box's influence continues to do its work.    Eventually it is revealed that the box contains a supernatural force of some kind, and that whoever looks into it sees what would tempt them the most, dooming them to corruption and death before dawn. The last survivor, Miles, lives only long enough to attempt to destroy the device by placing it in the path of an oncoming train, but dies just after seeing it nudged off the tracks by a curious dog.  Ultimately, a random toddler-age child wandering alone, in the middle of nowhere, miles from any city, town or train station, picks up the box, looks inside, and smiles.

Karthik ([[Lollu Sabha Jeeva]]) is a total showoff who tries to humiliate Shiva and Shakthi, but ends up making a fool of himself.  The movie begins on an aeroplane as Shiva (a mature looking Prithviraj, with a French beard and rimless spectacles) heads back to his college to meet his friends. With his eyes sparkling with nostalgic memories, he takes a trip down memory lane, and what he recalls about his college days forms the main part of the story.  At the reunion, the friends are happy to see each other after eight long years. But they all seem to be weighed down by a tragic incident: Shakthi's death. Shiva remains the most melancholic of them all. All goes well, until Shiva is found almost strangled to death. Everyone suspects Vasu, but Shakthi's father discovers that the murder was attempted by Shalini.  In a flashback, it is revealed that Shakthi and Shalini were lovers. In an ultimate twist, Shalini reveals that Shiva, who was running away from the police after breaking into an election booth, killed Shakthi with chloroform as the latter suffered from asthma. Shalini is upset that Shakthi's father prevented her from taking revenge against Shiva.  Shiva is cured and comes to seek apology from Shakthi's father for accidentally killing Shakthi. Shakthi's father forgives Shiva and asks him to marry Meera, who has been waiting for him for over eight years. Vasu also comes to seek apology from Shiva for all of his antics in college. Shakthi's parents adopt Shalini, whose family has died, and decide to take her home. The film ends as Shalini says farewell to her friends and to the image of Shakthi, who is forever present in the college campus.  The message of the film goes for all of us: "Never forget the sweet memories that happened in college."  
Night of the Demons (2009 film)
 The film opens in 1925, with scenes of gore and demons. Evangeline Broussard prepares to hang herself from her balcony when she is stopped by a man trying to reassure her that he is truly Louis and that she shouldn't hang herself. Evangeline calls him a liar, then jumps, hanging herself -- and also causing her head to rip off and bounce down the stairs.  Louis stares over the balcony...as his eyes switch to a demonic shade of orange.  Cut to present day: a girl named Maddie goes to a party held by Angela Feld with her friends Lily and Suzanne. She realizes her ex-boyfriend Colin is there, dealing drugs. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. At the party, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. Maddie goes to the toilet, only to have a hand grab her through the mirror. They pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela.  Police break up the party. Panicked, Colin stuffs his drugs into a grate to hide it from the police before leaving. Maddie, Lily, Dex and Jason leave with the rest, leaving an upset Angela alone in the house. After a while, the group returns, unable to find Suzanne, who is revealed to have passed out. Colin returns for his drugs and, with Angela, goes into the basement to find them. The pair find a hidden door, and Angela remarks that the house is full of hidden rooms, including a tunnel that leads to the next estate over. They enter the room and find six skeletons. Angela surmises that the skeletons are the remains of the missing party guests of Evangeline Broussard.  One of the skeletons bites Angela's hand, which causes her to feel woozy. Colin attempts to leave the house, only to discover that the gate is locked and can't be opened. While everyone plans to wait the night out, Suzanne details how Evangeline supposedly practiced [[black magic]] in the hopes that she would attract the attention of Louis, only to have that magic go wrong during a [[séance]]. The only person found alive was the maid, who was found scribbling spells on her walls, having been driven insane by the night's events.  Angela slowly succumbs to the skeleton bite -- and turns into a demon. She returns to the group, who partake in a game of spin the bottle. Angela infects Dex by kissing him. Lily angrily leads Dex into a nearby room, where the pair have sex. Dex transforms into a demon and infects Lily. Angela then attempts to seduce the others while Maddie, Jason and Colin leave to find another exit but can't. Angela successfully seduces Suzanne and then rips her breasts and face, turning her into a demon. Jason sees Lily pressing her lipstick into her breast, then voiding it out through her vagina. He warns the others who do not believe him until a demonic Suzanne attacks them. They decide to leave through the house's escape tunnel. On their way, they arm themselves with a gun and a metal bar. They discover the tunnel has caved in before being attacked by Lily and Dex. They manage to fend off the demons but Jason is injured. The survivors run upstairs and tend to Jason's injury. They realize that not only are they in the maid's room but that the symbols remained on the walls. They discover that the demons are attempting to take over seven human hosts to be freed upon the earth, having been thrown out of hell for trying to usurp Satan's rule. The demons had tricked Evangeline into hosting the party so they could take over the guests. The demons can't take over a dead body, which is why Evangeline hung herself. They also find out that the demons don't like rust, finding that they can use it as a weapon.  As the boys fall asleep, Angela taunts Maddie but is unable to enter the room due to the spells. The walls begin pouring with blood, washing off the spells. The trio attempt to re-draw the spells but are lured out of the room when the demons fake daylight in the windows. The demons attack them. Maddie and Colin rush back to the room--and Jason is caught and [[disemboweled]] by Angela--turning him into a demon.  As they plan to wait in the room until sunrise, Colin falls through the rotten floorboards, falling many floors into the basement. Maddie climbs down a rope into the basement to help him, but he is now a demon. Maddie manages to get back to the maid's room and fights the demons. She makes her way to the balcony, where she ties a rope around her neck and jumps over, seemingly hanging herself. As the sun rises, the demons are eliminated. Maddie reveals that she only pretended to hang herself, having tied the rope around her waist...and the demons merely assumed that she was dead. Maddie is then able to exit through the gates to her freedom.

Nine (2009 live-action film)
  Guido Contini ([[Daniel Day-Lewis]]) is a gifted Italian filmmaker in 1965 at the famous [[Cinecittà]] movie studios in Rome. At the age of fifty he has developed [[writer's block]] and surrealistically summons all of the women in his life, alive and dead, to help him recapture inspiration, as dozens of women dancers and the film’s leading ladies appear in his mind: Claudia Jenssen, his star actress; his wife Luisa; his mistress Carla; his costume designer and confidant Lilli; his beloved Mamma; Stephanie, an American fashion journalist from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''; and Saraghina, a prostitute from his childhood; ("Overture Delle Donne"). He avoids any clear answers when questioned by reporters about his new movie, because he doesn't have an idea for one.  Escaping their biting probes, he creates an elaborate fantasy ("Guido's Song"), where he explains that he wishes to have the naiveté of youth yet the wisdom of age. In short, he wants ''everything''. Escaping to a Spa Hotel on the Italian coast, he receives a phone call from Carla, his mistress ("A Call from the Vatican") seducing him as he listens on the other end. Later, she arrives at the spa, expecting to share his suite, but is upset to find that she’s staying in a shabby pensione by the train station. Meanwhile, Guido meets with Lilli, his costume designer, and begs for inspiration, confessing he has no script. A sequence of musical numbers ensues, seemingly from Guido's imaginative brain...first Lilli urging him to use his film to entertain, inspired by the [[Folies Bergère]], where she 'learnt her art' ("Folies Bergères"). Then Guido remembers Saraghina, a prostitute who danced for him and his boyhood schoolmates on a beach, teaching them the joy of life's sensual and sexual pleasures ("Be Italian"). Young Guido is caught by his school teachers/priests and punished by his principal. Back at the Spa, at dinner , he’s happily surprised to see his wife Luisa. He embraces her and wishes her a happy birthday. Luisa, deeply unhappy, sings of the life of compromise she's made, abandoning her acting career to be at Guido's side in supporting his art ("My Husband Makes Movies"). She then notices Carla entering the restaurant and storms out immediately, Guido following. Luisa ignores him and leaves and, when he returns to the restaurant and sees Carla, he is furious.  Carla now departs, heartbroken. Later, unable to pacify Luisa in their hotel room, Guido seeks out Stephanie in the hotel's bar, who describes her love for his movies though clearly from the point of view of an ignorant fashion editor ("[[Cinema Italiano]]"). She takes him to her room but, watching her undress, Guido realizes how much he cares for and needs his wife and seems to come to his senses. Returning to Luisa he promises that he’s finished with cheating. As she embraces him, the phone rings and he’s called away to help Carla, who’s now overdosed on pills in a suicide attempt. It is becoming impossible for Guido to juggle all the women and contradictions in his life. He stays with Carla until her husband arrives, then returns to the hotel to find that Luisa has abandoned him, and the crew has returned to Rome to begin filming. Distraught, he has a vision of his mother singing him a lullaby when he was young ("Guarda La Luna"). Later, in Rome, he phones Luisa from the studio and begs her to come to view screen tests the next evening. When his leading lady, Claudia, arrives and senses there is no written script, she and Guido go for a drive. Guido confesses that there is indeed no script, but he needs her to inspire one. She asks him what he wants the film to be about and his description closely resembles his own ordeal: a man lost and in love with so many women. Claudia explains that she loves him but he seems to be a man who does not know how to love ("Unusual Way"). When Guido returns to review the screen tests, Luisa too arrives and is devastated to see a clip of an actress in a scene drawn from a private memory she and Guido shared years ago. It is the last straw for her, to see him exploiting her private life so publicly before the world. In an angry and imaginary public striptease she leaves Guido for good ("[[Take It All (Nine song)|Take It All]]"). Utterly abandoned by all those whom he has selfishly exploited, Guido finally comes to terms with the truth ("I Can’t Make This Movie"), realizing that he’s lost everything and everyone: his wife, his muse, his talent, and has nothing with which to make a movie.  Admitting that there never was a movie, he has the set destroyed before leaving Rome. Two years later, Guido is in a café in [[Anguillara]] with Lilli and sees an advertisement for a play starring Luisa. He asks about Luisa and Lilli tells him that she’s not going be to be the middle-man for them.. She asks if he will ever make a movie again. Guido answers that the only thing he would want to make would be a movie about a man trying to win back his wife.  As he speaks, he is suddenly on a film set, making that very film, (which is, in fact, the film we the audience have just seen). Surrounded now by his actors and his boyhood nine-year-old self, Guido takes his place in the director’s chair, with the cast of his entire life assembled on the scaffolding behind him, including (as in the film's opening) the living and the dead. We see the arrival of his mother and the imagined nine-year-old Guido running now to sit on the mature Guido’s lap ("Finale") as his fantasy meets his reality. Luisa quietly arrives without being seen and watches in the background, as a chastened Guido who has learned something about the need to grow up, quietly directs a scene with a young actress and actor who are sympathetically playing the younger Guido and Luisa deeply in love . Luisa sees all this... as Guido is slowly raised high on a crane and calls, “Action!”  
Ninja Assassin
  The Ozunu Clan, led by the ruthless Lord Ozunu ([[Sho Kosugi]]), trains orphans from around the world to become the ultimate ninja assassins. Raizo ([[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]]) is one of the orphans. Their training is extremely brutal and tough, especially for him, because he is to be the next successor of the clan. The only kindness he ever feels is from a young kunoichi named Kiriko, with whom he eventually develops a romantic bond. As time goes by, Kiriko becomes disenchanted with the Ozunu's routine and decides to abandon it. One rainy night, Kiriko climbs a wall to escape and encourages Raizo to join her, but he chooses to stay. Branded as a traitor, Kiriko is captured and later executed in front of Raizo by their elder ninja brother Takeshi, who impales her through the heart.  From then on, Raizo begins to harbor resentment and doubt towards the Ozunu. Kiriko's death opens his eyes, and he begins to see that what he's been taught to do isn't right. Later on, Raizo is instructed by Lord Ozunu to complete his first assassination. After the mission, Raizo meets the rest of his clan atop a city skyscraper in Berlin. There, Lord Ozunu orders him to execute another kunoichi traitor, just like Kiriko. Remembering Kiriko's death and finally having had enough, Raizo cracks. He slashes Lord Ozunu's face with his [[kyoketsu-shoge]] and fights against his fellow ninjas. Barely surviving, he falls off the rooftop and into a river. After years, Raizo recovers and trains on his own to intervene and foil all of Ozunu's assassination attempts, hoping to smash the clan that took everything from him.  Meanwhile, Europol agent Mika Coretti ([[Naomie Harris]]) has been investigating money-linked political murders and finds out that they are possibly connected to the Ozunu. She defies her superior, Ryan Maslow ([[Ben Miles]]), and retrieves secret agency files to find out more about the investigation. Mika meets Raizo and convinces him to see Maslow for protection, as well as to provide evidence against the Ozunu. However, Raizo is arrested by Maslow and abducted by Europol agents for interrogation.  Although feeling betrayed, Mika is assured by Maslow that he is still on her side and gives her a tracking device for emergencies. The Ozunu ninjas infiltrate the Europol safe house, where Raizo is being held, in an attempt to kill him and everybody inside. Mika frees Raizo and they both manage to escape, but Raizo suffers near-fatal wounds. Mika then takes him to a motel to hide. Resting in the motel, Mika implants the tracking device into Raizo, as the ninjas remain in pursuit. Unable to fend off the Ozunu, she hides outside the motel until Special Forces arrive to help her.  By the time they arrive, the ninjas have already kidnapped Raizo, bringing him before Lord Ozunu for execution. During the transport back to the Ozunu, Raizo uses his ninja techniques to heal his own wounds. Europol Special Forces and tactical teams led by Maslow storm the secluded Ozunu retreat (nestled in the mountains) using the tracking device on Raizo.  Turning the night into day by saturating the sky above with powerful flares, the military forces are able to fight the ninjas on their own terms. In the confusion, Mika frees Raizo from his bindings. He proceeds to kill Takeshi and confront Lord Ozunu in a sword duel. Mika interferes to help but gets stabbed by Lord Ozunu. Enraged, Raizo uses a "shadow blending" technique for the first time to distract and kill Lord Ozunu. Mika, seemingly fatally wounded, is in fact saved by a quirk of birth: her heart is actually on the right side of her chest.  With the Ozunu defeated, Europol leaves. Raizo stays behind in the ruins of the Ozunu retreat. Climbing the same wall Kiriko did in the past, he looks out at the surrounding countryside with a smile, feeling his freedom for the first time.  
Nine Dead
 The nine characters are revealed to be: 1 — a petty criminal (Christian), 2 — a police officer (Jackson), 3 — an illegal gun seller (Leon), 4 — a strip club owner and loan shark (Sully), 5 — an Assistant District Attorney for LA County (Kelley), 6 — a pedophile and rapist (Coogan), 7 — a priest (Father Francis), 8 — a health insurance executive (Eddie), and 9 — a Chinese store owner who does not know English (Nhung Chan).  After a string of kidnappings, these nine people are locked inside a room and handcuffed to pipes. Then a masked man enters and explains each of them are there for a reason, and to survive, they must figure out how they are all connected. He further explains that he will kill one of them every ten minutes until they figure it out. The shooter leaves and a countdown begins. The group begins introducing themselves, and a few early connections are made. Christian says he once borrowed money from Sully, but paid it back. Coogan mentions he has been in multiple prisons. Kelley and Jackson are former lovers. Just as the group begins to think it is all a hoax, the shooter enters and kills Christian.  After the masked man leaves, Leon has Sully stomp on his hand until it breaks, freeing himself from his handcuffs.  He attempts to escape, but is caught and brought back by the shooter. The shooter then kills Coogan, who has mentioned earlier that he is dying anyway. Before he shoots him he whispers the reason in Coogan's ear. Then Coogan attacks the masked man and is shot. The shooter tells Leon he will be the next to die.  With seven people left, Mrs. Chan recognizes Kelley as her former lawyer after Mrs. Chan's store was robbed two years earlier. The group begins to see connections between themselves and the robber, Wade Greeley. The shooter returns, but as the seven only know part of the story, he shoots Leon.  With the theory in doubt, it becomes clear that Father Francis knows more than he is admitting, but refuses to give further information.  Eventually, it is determined that Greeley did not rob the store; the real robber, Christian, confessed to Father Francis that he committed the robbery in order to gain enough money to pay back Sully. However, when shown a line-up, Mrs. Chan mistakenly identified Greeley as the robber, and Kelley prosecuted him.  At this point, the shooter reenters, and since not all of the connections have been established, he tries to kill Eddie, but Father Francis puts himself in the path of the bullet and is killed instead. When Kelley calls him Wade, he denies being Wade Greeley and leaves. Once the shooter leaves, Sully realizes that before Christian robbed Mrs. Chan's store, he didn't have a gun, and must have bought one from Leon. The shooter enters and targets Mrs. Chan; instead of whispering the reason to her he hands her a note written in Chinese. She pleads with him in Chinese (presumably revealing the father-son relationship between the Shooter and Wade Greeley to viewers who understand Chinese) before he shoots her. Kelley begs to be let go to be with her son, but the shooter is visibly angry Kelley used her son as an excuse, and leaves, but not before hinting Jackson is the father of Kelley's baby.  Kelley confirms that Jackson is the father of her son, and also reveals she fabricated evidence to convict Greeley, saying she needed to win a case after many losses. She also reveals that Jackson unknowingly helped her falsify evidence, and that she once murdered a man who raped her, and swept it under the rug when the man's body was found. Eddie realizes the shooter must be Greeley's father, exacting revenge, and the remaining four begin to wonder what happened to Greeley after he went to prison. The shooter returns and kills Sully, who has no regret for his actions.  With only Kelley, Jackson, and Eddie left, the three struggle to establish connections for Eddie and Coogan. Eddie supposes that Coogan was earlier referring to being infected with AIDS (since he mentioned the others being harmed by "blood splatter"), and, as he has been in multiple prisons, could have raped Greeley and infected him. Then the final connection is made; Greeley applied for an experimental drug treatment (run by Eddie's company) for HIV, but Eddie would have had to reject him due to his criminal conviction. They explain this to the shooter, Greeley's father, who removes his mask and agrees to let them all go. Kelley is released, but, having slowly revealed her true nature, steals the shooter's gun and shoots Greeley's father, Eddie, and Jackson. Greeley's father, who was wearing a kevlar vest, recovers momentarily to reveal that the whole time "everybody has been watching" and that they now know "who the real Kelley Murphy is". He is then shot in the head, and Kelley escapes as the police arrive.

Ninja (film)
  Casey Bowman is an American orphan who was adopted into a martial arts dojo in Japan. Because of his perseverance and desire to master bushido, he earns the respect of his sensei Takeda and his daughter Namiko. However, the dojo's top student Masazuka becomes bitter over Namiko's friendship with Casey. One morning, during a sparring match, he loses his temper and nearly kills Casey by throwing a katana at him. In self-defense, Casey scars Masazuka below his right eye. As a result of his actions, Masazuka is expelled from the dojo by sensei Takeda.  Years later, Masazuka becomes a contract killer of an organization called Temple Industries, which itself runs an underground criminal cult known as "The Ring". He returns to his former dojo and claims the succession as soke, but sensei Takeda turns him down. Anticipating an invasion by Masazuka, sensei Takeda assigns Casey and Namiko to guard an old chest called the "Yoroi Bitsu", which contains the suit and weapons of an ancient ninja. Before Masazuka storms the dojo and murders sensei Takeda, Casey and Namiko manage to take the Yoroi Bitsu" to New York City, where they keep it safe at Triborough University's vault with the help of sensei Takeda's friend, Professor Garrison. They are tracked down by Masazuka, who sends Temple's thugs to take down the couple. While Casey and Namiko are on the run, they are framed for the murder of Professor Garrison and arrested. During their interrogation, Casey is ridiculed by Detective Traxler (Todd Jensen). Masazuka, disguising himself as Namiko's lawyer, slips into the station and cuts the power. He takes down several police officers in the dark before incapacitating Namiko. In the midst of the chaos, Casey saves Traxler from being gunned down by Masazuka, who leaves with Namiko.  After receiving a tip-off through a member of Temple's thugs, Casey storms Temple Industries, retrieving Masazuka's phone number from the firm's president. He calls Masazuka and sets up a meeting place to exchange the "Yoroi Bitsu" for Namiko's life. Casey then rushes to the university to retrieve the chest and don the ninja suit and the arsenal. At a construction site, Masazuka releases Namiko once the "Yoroi Bitsu" is lowered from a crane, only to discover the chest empty. The two men prepare for a final showdown, but members of The Ring stage an ambush under Temple's orders to kill the trio. Together, Casey, Namiko and Masazuka beat the thugs. Masazuka uses a blowgun to shoot a poison dart at Namiko and taunts Casey with the antidote bottle. Masazuka, however, drops the bottle, forcing Casey into a fit of rage. As an NYPD helicopter flashes its spotlight on the fight, Masazuka uses a ninjutsu technique to blind Casey with the reflections from his katana and disappears in front of him. Casey uses his instincts to counter-attack and impales Masazuka from behind. Casey is saddened that he is unable to save Namiko. However, but upon remembering his sensei's teachings of a ninja's katana possessing the power to both kill and heal, he discovers the antidote inside the handle of his katana. Within seconds, the antidote neutralizes the poison as Namiko awakens. Before they leave, Casey decapitates Masazuka.  The next morning, Traxler informs Casey and Namiko that Temple has been arrested and The Ring has been smashed. He gives them their passports and tells them to leave New York for good. The couple returns to Japan to pay homage to their late sensei and continue running their dojo.

Not Forgotten (film)
 Jack Bishop ([[Simon Baker]]) works as a loan officer in [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]], [[Texas]] and is remarried to Amaya Bishop ([[Paz Vega]]), living with her and his daughter Toby Bishop ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]) from his first marriage. Toby is kidnapped by an unknown perpetrator leading to the involvement of the local police and eventually the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]]. The FBI begins inquiring in Jack's past only to find out he has no official records dating back farther than ten years, and there is no evidence showing how his first wife had died or where she was buried.  A local petty criminal and repeated sex offender is initially thought to be the culprit, but it is revealed that the dangerous cult-like religious movement [[Santa Muerte]], popular within Mexican criminal circles, might be involved. Jack's former life as a [[Santa Muerte]] worshiping hit man for the Mexican mafia is revealed as he tries desperately to find out who kidnapped his daughter.  We later learn that Jack was really named Roberto.  Though born in Oklahoma, his drug addicted mother took him to Mexico when she was young.  She later died, and Roberto had to make a life for himself on the streets.  He ultimately became an enforcer for the Mexican mafia.  He married a woman named Katie, and they had a child, Toby.  Jack escapes from the FBI in Texas and makes his way across the border to Acuna.  There he is accused of murdering a prostitute who was trying to help him find Toby.  Though he did not do it, the Mexican police arrest him.  Jack is later able to escape from the Mexican jail in disguise.  Still in Acuna, he makes his presence known.  As he planned, he lured the assassin who was looking for him to come to his hotel.  They fight and Jack beats the assassin, who he then tortures for information about Toby's whereabouts.  The assassin tells Jack that Toby was kidnapped by Katie, Jack's/Roberto's ex-wife.  Jack breaks into the brothel that Katie now runs in Acuna and confronts Katie, who is herself furious that Jack/Roberto ran out on her without warning and took Toby with him.  Jack thinks Katie is lying when she says she does not know where Toby is, and murders her.  In the film's denouement, we realize that the real kidnapper was Jack's new wife, Amaya, with the help of her cousin, the Sheriff in Del Rio (who throughout the film appeared as if he was trying to help Jack and that he believed Jack's innocence).  We learn that the flashback we have seen throughout the film—of Jack/Roberto strangling a man at Katie's behest as she looks on in delight—has new meaning.  The man Roberto strangled was Amaya's father.  Worse still, Amaya was in the room with Roberto and Katie when they strangled her father, hiding under the bed.  Amaya's father was a degenerate gambler who owed a large debt to Katie and the Mexican Mob, and when he could not pay, Katie had Roberto kill him.  Amaya witnessed all of this.  We realize that she then set in motion an elaborate plan to emigrate to the United States and marry Jack/Roberto in order to punish him for murdering her father.  It was Amaya and the Sheriff who kidnapped Toby.  Amaya and the Sheriff set fire to the room where Jack is (the same room where he killed Amaya's father many years ago).  But Jack is able to see that Toby is tied up on the bed in the room.  He manages to free her and they escape the fire unhurt.  The viewer thinks this is the end of the movie and that it has a happy ending.  But we then learn, in a final twist, the truth.  Amaya did not really kidnap Toby.  When Amaya explained to Toby who her father really was, Amaya was able to enlist Toby (using the magic of Santa Muerte) to help exact an even worse revenge on Jack/Roberto.  Amaya tells Toby that her father will kill her mother (which in fact happened earlier when Jack was duped by the assassin he tortured into killing Katie to find Toby).

 An anonymous flasher [[Indecent exposure|exposes himself]] to shoppers in the Forest Ridge Mall parking lot. The head of mall security, Ronald "Ronnie" Barnhardt (Rogen), makes it his mission to apprehend the offender. However, while Ronnie is ostensibly well-intentioned and valiant in his own mind, in reality he appears to be an emotionally unstable individual with [[vigilante]] tendencies, apparently experiencing [[bipolar disorder]] and displaying [[homicidal ideation|violent ideation]], [[grandiose delusions]] or [[megalomania]], [[paranoia]], and [[bigoted]] and [[delusional]] thinking. He is assisted by Charles, Dennis, and the Yuen twins ([[John Yuan|John]] and [[Matthew Yuan]]), in his efforts.  The day after, Ronnie's dream girl, Brandi (Faris), who works at the mall make-up counter, encounters the flasher as soon as she stops her vehicle in the mall's parking lot, shocking her. Then Ronnie tries to comfort her until Detective Harrison, a cop, arrives and takes over Ronnie's palliative role. Ronnie gets upset and agitated that his manager allowed an outsider to take over his search for the suspect.  The criminal activity at the mall continues, as a masked person robs a shoe store, causing property damage. Detective Harrison is once again called in to investigate, his efforts which Ronnie decides to get into, who believes that Saddamn, an Arab shopkeeper in the mall is the thief, based on the fact that he is an Arab. Ronnie curses Saddamn out, and Harrison profanely excoriates Ronnie for this during a meeting with Ronnie's superior, and in response, Ronnie decides to take steps to become a police officer.  As part of his preparations, Ronnie decides to ride along with Detective Harrison. Harrison, fed up with Ronnie, tricks him into walking into the most dangerous part of town, and drives off. Ronnie then confronts and subsequently assaults several drug dealers, victoriously returning to the police station with a dealer's son and thanking the detective for the opportunity to prove himself. Emboldened, Ronnie arranges a date with Brandi. On their date, Brandi sees Ronnie taking a prescription [[clonazepam]], and thinking that Ronnie takes them [[Recreational drug use|recreationally]], she asks him for the bottle. She consumes multiple tablets herself while drinking. Ronnie takes her home and they have sex while she is apparently semi-conscious, and at one point, when he stops mid-coitus, she says groggily, "Why are you stopping, motherfucker?", prompting him to continue.  Ronnie passes the background check and physical examination for the police officer job, but fails the psychological examination. Nell, a friendly food court worker, explains to him that her boss, Roger, and Trina, another female employee, make fun of Nell for having her leg in a cast. Ronnie then beats up Roger and warns him and Trina not to harass Nell again. Depressed, he is persuaded by Dennis to spend the day doing a wide variety of drugs and assaulting [[skateboard]]ing teenagers.  At the end of the day, Ronnie finds out that Dennis was the shoe thief, and that he has been stealing from the mall for some time. Ronnie is stunned and, after a brief argument, is knocked unconscious by Dennis, who then flees to Mexico.  Ronnie decides to go [[undercover]] in order to catch the flasher. At night he sees Harrison having sex with Brandi, and he confronts her in front of onlookers at the mall the next day, blowing his cover and inadvertently destroying a display case. When the police are summoned, Ronnie fights them and Harrison. Ronnie single handily defeats the regular officers, but he loses against Harrison and is arrested.  After a night in jail, Ronnie's mom gives him a postcard from Dennis in Mexico. Dennis admits that he respects Ronnie for caring so much. The next day, Ronnie returns to the mall, fired from his job. Despondent, he sits at a food court table, where Nell, whose cast has been removed, and is sporting a more flattering hairdo, brings him a complimentary cup of coffee. As a vulnerable Ronnie expresses his sadness over his situation, Nell kisses him. Interrupting their romantic moment, the flasher exposes himself to Nell and Ronnie and runs off, exposing himself to many other mall patrons. Ronnie, pursuing the flasher in a slow-motion sequence that includes him punching Saddamn in the face, retrieves a gun and shoots the flasher in the shoulder as he charges toward Brandi. Refusing the flasher an ambulance, Ronnie brings the flasher to his feet to take him to the police station, and as he does so, his boss, Mark rehires him. Though Brandi compliments Ronnie on a job well done, Ronnie rejects her compliment and humiliates her publicly for betraying him. Ronnie drops the flasher off at the police station, and boasts to Harrison of his feat, saying that he does not need a badge or gun to know who he is. Ronnie is then interviewed by the local news with Nell and his fellow security guards by his side.

Seeing that Eno is financially troubled, the crew agree to pay him on the condition that they are allowed to film the occurrences personally.  Eno who, when given the financial opportunity drinks and smokes heavily and becomes rude, repulses the crew, especially since they think that he will follow Matsuki's path of murder. From Matsuki's father, the crew learns that Eno's mark resembles the one possessed by Matsuki since childhood, and their search brings them to Mount Ohiruyama, where the sacred Kutoro Rock is located. The crew find a stone with Matsuki and Eno's petrogylph marks inscribed on it. According to a horror film director, [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], the Kutoro Rock (九頭呂岩, literally "Nine-Headed Spine Rock") in Mount Ohiruyama (お蛭山, literally "Mount Leech") was dedicated to [[Ebisu (mythology)|Hiruko]], a Japanese god with the form of leech. This tale matches Shiraishi's experience of having nine leeches biting his left leg when he visited the rock five years previous. However, the film Eno takes reveals a number of leech-like apparitions that the film crew have to acknowledge.  Shiraishi takes Eno alone back to a Korean barbecue restaurant to get him to talk openly about what the voices he hears tell him. Drunk and relaxed, Eno reveals that he has been saving ¥700,000 to build a bomb so he can commit a suicide bombing in a busy street in [[Shinjuku]], which he claims would send him and all people involved to God's realm. Shiraishi initially claims he will stop Eno, but on the way home, he sees Eno's head surrounded by the leach-like apparitions and find his leg bleeding as it did when the leaches bit it. He becomes utterly compliant and agrees to cooperate, intending to record the step-by-step for other people to identify. They spend the day of the bombing together. Eno refuses to eat beef for fear of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow]] disease. After spending a day with Eno prior to the bombing, Eno offers him a ¥100 coin to repay one he borrowed long before. Shiraishi tells him to later return it and the camera from the realm he expects to go to with the bombing. The bomb claims 108 lives, including Shiraishi's fellow journalist, Shinobu Kuribayashi. However, Eno's body, like Matsuki, is never found. Shiraishi, meanwhile, is sentenced to prison for complicity.   21 years later, Shiraishi has been released from prison and reunites with his producer. They return to the Korean barbecue. There, the producer explains that the restaurant will soon close as has many others since over 100,000 people have died from Mad Cow disease. Suddenly, something falls from the ceiling and Shiraishi screams in pain. He finds the camera and a ¥100 coin that Eno borrowed years ago. He also realizes that his leg is bleeding with leech marks.   The camera recording shows Eno being sent immediately after the bombing to a [[Lovecraftian]]-like universe which he screams is [[Hell]]. Leech and jellyfish-like creatures surround him in the almost cartoonish realm.  He screams for help among other people's torments before a leech consumes him.  
Old Dogs (film)
 Dan Rayburn ([[Robin Williams]]) and Charlie Reed ([[John Travolta]]) are best friends and co-owners of a successful sports marketing firm. Seven years prior, Dan, recently divorced, married Vicki ([[Kelly Preston]]) after being whisked away by Charlie for a tropical vacation. The marriage, however, is short lived. Seven years later, Vicki resurfaces to tell Dan that their short marriage resulted in something he never suspected: twins Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta).  Vicki, facing jail time for her work as an environmental activist, asks Dan to take care of the kids while she does her time. Thinking this might be his chance to get back with Vicki, Dan agrees, but only if Charlie will help him since neither have any experience taking care of kids. At the same time, the two must finalize a huge marketing deal with a Japanese company; something they've always dreamed of, but will take all of their talents to clinch.  Because Dan's condo does not allow children, he has to board with Charlie. Whilst this is happening, Charlie and Dan are close to securing the biggest account in the history of their careers with the Japanese corporation. Charlie and Dan's attempts to take care of the kids are well-intentioned, but very misguided. On a trip with the kids to an overnight camp, a hard-nosed camp instructor ([[Matt Dillon]]) becomes convinced that Dan and Charlie are homosexual partners. The trip ends with a bang after Dan accidentally sets a beloved statue of the camp's founder on fire.  The kids then proceed to spill and replace Charlie and Dan's prescriptions, mixing them up in the process. Dan then must play a game of golf with the Japanese executives while experiencing extreme side effects and Charlie tries to woo Amanda ([[Lori Loughlin]]) with a face frozen by the pills.  Desperate to help Dan communicate with the children despite his inexperience with children, Charlie recruits his friend Jimmy Lunchbox ([[Bernie Mac]]), a [[Effeminacy|flamboyant]] children's entertainer, who is famous around the world. Jimmy comes by and straps Dan and Charlie in motion control puppet suits so Charlie can help Dan make all the right moves with his daughter while having a tea party. The suits malfunction, but Dan speaks from the heart, winning over Emily but his speech makes Jimmy emotional. Everything is great with Vicki as she returns home upon having served time in jail. However, the guys have sealed their Japanese deal, sending junior associate Craig ([[Seth Green]]) to Tokyo. When Craig goes missing after arriving there, Charlie and Dan must fly to Tokyo themselves to work. Dan must leave the kids and Vicki despite his (and their) desire to be a family.  Once in Tokyo, Dan realizes that what he really wants is to be a good father. He leaves the meeting without sealing the deal, rushing with Charlie to Vermont for the kids' birthday party. They aren't able to get into the Burlington Zoo in time and are forced to break in with the help of Craig. However, they mistakenly wind up in the [[gorilla]] enclosure. Though Dan and Charlie escape, Craig is captured by the gorilla (which takes a strong liking to him).  Dan then pays a birthday party performer hired by Vicki to use his jet pack and suit, flies into the ceremony and wins his kids back over. When the jet pack stops working in mid-air, he is taken to an ambulance on a stretcher. One year later, Dan and Vicki are together, Charlie has married Amanda, and Craig has become like a new "uncle" to the kids.

One Night in Supermarket
 Bespectacled nerd Li Junwei ([[Qiao Renliang]]) and pretty girl Tang Xiaolian ([[Li Xiaolu]]) are manning the night shift at the 24-hour Wang Wang Supermarket when balding lottery addict He Sanshui ([[Xu Zheng (actor)|Xu Zheng]]) arrives, demanding to speak to the lady owner Wang Sufen (Yang Qing). Wang, who is not in, made a typo entering the lottery number more than a month ago, which rendered He Sanshui's winning ticket useless. When He Sanshui asked for the ¥9500 win at an earlier occasion, she attacked him and drove him out of her store. This time, He Sanshui returns with a stun gun flashlight and his dimwitted cousin He Damiao a.k.a. Tire (Wang Dongfang), and is determined to get his ¥9500 "back".   At this moment, Li's goofy roommate Zhu Liao (Zhao Yingjun) who wants to record a funny prank video also storms in, wearing a pantyhose on his face and wielding a knife, but is quickly tasered down by He Sanshui. He Sanshui proceeds to the cashier counter and realizes there isn't enough cash in the cash register. He and Tire rope up everyone else in the soundproof back room—which has a complete Karaoke system—and taking their place behind the register begin to run the store, funneling the profits into their own pockets.   The hungry Tire is getting preoccupied with bag after bag of junk food (some of which have expired) and Karaoke singing in the back, so Li—whom He Sanshui calls "Little Steel Teeth" because he wears a dental brace—is brought back out to help with the work. Some time later, Tang's escape attempt, during which she tasers down Tire, is spoiled by Zhu's foolishness and He Sanshui's second stun gun.   Wang suddenly returns to the store from her [[Mahjong]] games—obvious having lost all her money—and immediately begins to attack He Sanshui with a bag of weight before Tire tasers her down. However, holding her (and her [[French Bulldog]] Wang Wang) hostage does nothing to the business, which has been slow tonight. In an effort to boost sales He Sanshui decides to give 50% discount to all store items, and business quickly perks up after a taxicab chauffeur (Cao Li) helps spread the news to his colleagues. During this time, Tang discovers voyeuristic photos of hers in Li's phone and realizes that Li likes her.  With ¥3.50 to go before their ¥9500 goal (taking into account that Tire has eaten ¥118.10 of food), a [[Guanzhong dialect]]-speaking, gun-toting robber (Zhang Jiayi) on the run arrives to retrieve a diamond his partner left in the ice in the store freezer. Unable to find his diamond he takes everyone hostage and is in the middle of having everyone strip, when Yaozi (Ye Qian)—the store's delivery man who has fallen asleep in the warehouse—barges out from the rear. The group tries to subdue the gunman, but fails because He Sanshui's stun gun has run out of battery.   When the diamond is finally discovered during the subsequent search, the dog Wang Wang picks it up and runs outside. This is when the gunman realizes that the police have already surrounded the store: it was Tang who secretly texted a policeman shopper (Li Weijian). The gunman runs back inside, grabs Tang and points his gun to her head. Li saves Tang but is shot by the gunman, who is accidentally electrocuted by a loose wire.    Some time later, the policeman returns to the store and learns that Li—no longer wearing a brace and glasses—and Tang have been dating, while He Sanshui and Wang are honeymooning in [[Hainan]]. They watch on TV that Zhu has become a famous actor, and Tire his agent.  
Open Graves
 In the medieval era, a witch named Mamba is tortured and skinned alive in punishment for her crimes. Her skin and organs are then used to make a cursed game. A player who wins the game is granted a wish; however, a player losing the game is killed in a fashion predicted by the game.  In the present day, Jason ([[Mike Vogel]]), while shopping with his friend Tomas ([[Iman Nazemzadeh]]) and Tomas' girlfriend Lisa ([[Lindsay Caroline Robba]]), acquires the board game from a handicapped shop owner called Malek ([[Alex O'Dogherty]]). The three friends travel back to Tomas' beachfront house, and at night a party occurs on the beach. Jason meets Erica ([[Eliza Dushku]]), before it begins to rain, causing most of the party-goers to leave; leaving behind only Jason, Erica, Tomas, Lisa, Elena (Naike Rivelli), Miguel ([[Ander Pardo]]) and Pablo ([[Boris Martinez]]). Erica suggests that the group should play the game, to which they all agree.  However, Pablo is soon eliminated and takes Tomas' car to go to the shop and get beer. On his travel, Pablo stops to urinate, but falls over the edge of a cliff. He survives the fall, but is barely alive. A group of [[crabs]] then attacks him, gouging out his eyes and killing him. Meanwhile, Miguel, Lisa, Elena and Tomas also lose the game, before Detective Izar ([[Gary Piquer]]) arrives and informs the group of Pablo's death, cutting the game short.  The group attend Pablo's funeral, where Erica realizes his death mirrors the games prediction. Soon after, Tomas, Lisa and Miguel travel to a wood-cutting factory (that belongs to Miguel's family but is currently empty) to have a photo shoot. While Lisa models, she feels unwell; she stops the photo shoot and leaves with Tomas. After their departure, Miguel is attacked by snakes. He attempts to climb a stack of logs, but a snake bites him and he falls into a large group of snakes that kill him with their venomous bites.  Meanwhile, Jason and Erica start up a romance. While they are in Jason's car they witness ghostly versions of Pablo and Miguel, before receiving a call from Tomas telling them of Miguel's death. Jason and Erica meet Tomas, Lisa and Elena at Tomas' apartment, where they tell the others they suspect the group are dying because of the game. Tomas, Lisa and Elena remain skeptical, however. After Jason, Erica and Elena have left, Lisa becomes more ill. Tomas tends to her, before the pair go to bed. The following morning, Lisa has aged into an old woman and is rushed to hospital.  Jason, Erica and Elena arrive at the hospital and tell Detective Izar their theory about the game. They then go in to see Lisa. Elena becomes distraught at her appearance and about her friends' deaths, and leaves despite Tomas' attempts to get her to stay. Lisa soon dies, prompting Jason, Erica and Tomas to seek answers from Malek.  They find Malek at his home, but he is no longer handicapped. He explains to them that he won the game and wished to no longer be handicapped. Meanwhile, Elena is traveling home to [[Milan]] in her car when she is involved in a car accident. Her car leaks gas, and a broken electrical wire ignites it, burning her to death. Jason, Erica and Tomas go to Jason's house, where they find Detective Izar looking for the game. Jason and Erica escape with it, but Tomas is caught by the Detective, who puts him in the trunk of his car. Later, Jason receives a call from the Detective demanding the game in return for Tomas, but Tomas attempts to escape and the Detective shoots him dead.  At Tomas' beachfront house, Jason and Erica decide to play the game in the hope that they can win and wish for it to be a week in the past, so that their friends will be alive. Erica is eliminated, and realizes her death will involve the sea. Jason wins the game, and will get his wish as long as he passes the game onto another person. Jason and Erica go to bed, but Erica discovers she must die for Jason to get his wish, so she enters the sea. Jason wakes up and rushes out to save her, but Detective Izar shows up, takes the game away and leaves with it. Erica then emerges from the sea and reveals herself to be Mamba, granting Jason his wish that they have never played the game. However, Jason and his friends now become trapped, forced to relive the week again and again.

One night, after another game in which he continues to slump at the plate, Carlton gets a phone call from his grandfather Amon ([[Harry Dean Stanton]]), who tells him that Carlton's mother, Katherine ([[Mary Steenburgen]]) has fallen ill and is at the hospital.  Katherine requires a surgery that the doctors recommend; however she refuses to sign the waiver until Kyle comes to visit her.  After Carlton agrees to find his estranged father, together with his ex-girlfriend Lucy ([[Kate Mara]]), the two of them fly to [[Columbus, Ohio]] to break the news to Kyle, who is there for an autograph signing and doesn't have a cell phone.  After a tense meeting, in which it's revealed that Carlton and Kyle haven't seen or spoken to each other in five years, Kyle agrees to fly to [[Texas]] to see Katherine with his son and Lucy.  The next morning, while preparing to get through airport security, Kyle realizes that he's lost his wallet and hence his identification, therefore he's not allowed to board the flight.  Lucy suggests that the three of them rent a car and drive.  While at a gas station one evening, Kyle asks Lucy to bring him his bag which contain painkillers for his various aches.  Lucy notices Kyle's wallet in the bag, revealing that Kyle intentionally misplaced his wallet in hopes of not having to get on the plane and thus not make the trip; Lucy keeps this discovery a secret from Carlton.  As the trip progresses, Carlton and Kyle attempt to piece-together their fragile relationship.  Also, Lucy tells Carlton that she's engaged to a new man; this creates a tension between the two, as their love towards each other remains.  Many delays occur, as Kyle becomes increasingly anxious about seeing Katherine and becomes more and more unreliable.  He seems to make up for this, however, when he tells Carlton and Lucy that he knows someone who works at the [[Memphis]] airport who can get him through security without I.D.  While waiting for their flight, Kyle tells Carlton that the employee he knows doesn't exist and it was a cover-up story.  Carlton realizes that Kyle has had his wallet the entire time and has purposely been delaying the trip.  He angrily storms off to talk to Lucy, leaving Kyle unattended.  After an argument with Lucy, whom he finds out knew about the wallet the whole time, he returns to where Kyle was sitting to find him missing.  Carlton and Lucy get on the flight anyway and Carlton exits the flight to look for his father but not before telling Lucy that if he doesn't come back before takeoff, to get off the plane.  Mad at Carlton and their argument, Lucy decides to stay on the plane anyway and she flies home; Carlton is also unsuccessful in finding Kyle.  Carlton calls Katherine and she tells him that if his father is anywhere in Memphis, he'd be at The [[Peabody Hotel]] downtown.  When Carlton arrives at the hotel he finds out from the front desk that no one by the name of Kyle Garrett has checked-in.  Tired at this point, Carlton takes a room for the night.  Later that evening, during a conversation with the Peabody Hotel bartender ([[Lyle Lovett]]), the bartender tells him that Kyle Garrett is indeed staying in the hotel but under an alias.  Furious, Carlton confronts Kyle in Kyle's room.  After forcing himself in, Carlton and Kyle wrestle each other to the ground, where Kyle tells Carlton that he loves Katherine but loves himself even more.  Soon Kyle agrees to continue with the trip.  The next day Carlton gets a phone call: Katherine has gotten an infection and the doctors have been forced to operate earlier than expected.  Carlton, Kyle, Amon and Carlton's grandmother Virge ([[Lenore Banks]]) wait anxiously in the hospital waiting room.  Soon Lucy shows up and she and Carlton reconcile.  The doctor comes out and tells the family that the operation was a success.  The next morning, while still at the hospital, Carlton tells Lucy that he's quitting baseball to focus on becoming a writer and Lucy tells Carlton that she's not a 'fiancee' anymore.  At this point it's assumed that the two have gotten back together.  Carlton drives Kyle to the airport, where Kyle agrees to come visit on [[New Year's]] and Carlton agrees to visit Kyle for [[Christmas]].  The ending scene shows Carlton clearing out his baseball locker and walking to his jeep, where Lucy is waiting for him.  The two drive off together.

Orphan (2009 film)
 Kate and John Coleman's marriage is strained after their third child, Jessica, was [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. The loss is particularly hard on Kate, who is also recovering from alcoholism. They decide to adopt a 9-year-old [[Russians|Russian]] girl, Esther, from the local orphanage. While Kate and John's 5-year-old deaf-mute daughter Maxine or "Max" embraces Esther almost immediately, their 12-year-old son Daniel is less welcoming, being rude and insulting towards the peculiar Esther and refusing to treat her like a sister.  Kate begins to develop a strong mother-daughter bond with Esther too. She decides to teach piano lessons to her and starts to reconcile with John again. One night, John and Kate reflect on their lives since adopting Esther, and  happily proceed to have intercourse, as Kate hopes to become pregnant and have a fourth baby in their extended family. However, their moment is spoiled when Esther suddenly walks in on them. Kate soon becomes suspicious when Esther expresses far more knowledge of sex than expected of a child her age. John says she may have learned it from her previous foster family and to not think about it too much. Esther starts to develop other strange behaviors, such as smashing and killing an injured pigeon with a rock to “put it out of its misery” after Daniel hit it with his [[paintball gun]]. When Esther seriously injures school bully Brenda at a local park, Kate initially believes it was an accident. Daniel starts an argument at dinner claiming that Esther is an embarrassment to him and John locks Danny’s treehouse as punishment. Kate becomes alarmed when Sister Abigail, the head of the orphanage, visits, warning bad things frequently happen in Esther's vicinity. Esther overhears the conversation and uses Max as a distraction. She pushes Max onto the road into Sister Abigail’s path, causing her to almost hit Max and swerve off the road. When Sister Abigail approaches Max, Esther kills Sister Abigail with a hammer and has Max help her push her body into a ditch. Esther then hides the hammer and her bloody clothes in Daniel’s treehouse. Danny spots Esther coming out of his treehouse and becomes suspicious. During the night, Esther approaches Daniel in bed with a box cutter and asks him if he saw anything and then threatens to cut off his penis if he says anything to his parents. Terrified, Daniel claims he didn’t see anything and Esther exits his room, leaving him traumatized and caused him to urinate himself in his bed. Kate is convinced that something is wrong with Esther but John does not believe her. After Esther is allowed by John to stay home from school and the dentist, John suggests she should do something nice for Kate. Esther then presents Kate with a bouquet of white roses from Jessica's grave. Frantic, Kate yells at Esther and grabs her by the arm for cutting the roses.  Later that night, Esther purposely breaks her arm with a [[vise]] and cries to John that her arm still hurts from when Kate grabbed her. After returning home from the hospital, John kicks Kate from their bedroom due to Esther's request for safety. Kate then buys two bottles of wine but refrains from drinking. The next day at school, Esther releases the brakes in Kate’s car, causes it to roll into oncoming traffic with Max inside. Esther points out the wine to John, who tells Kate to attend rehab or he will divorce her and leave with the kids. Kate finds Esther's hidden Bible and discovers that it came from the Saarne Institute in [[Estonia]]. She contacts the institute to ask about Esther and learns that it is a [[mental hospital]]. She then calls the orphanage to ask about Esther’s background in Estonia but was informed that her adoption papers were all from Russia. Kate later learns that the Russian orphanage that Esther was originally from never had any records of her at all.   When Daniel learns about Sister Abigail's death from Max, he plans to retrieve the hammer and prove Esther's guilt. Esther overhears their conversation and confronts Daniel as he searches the treehouse, setting it on fire and locking Daniel inside. Daniel falls to the ground trying to escape and is knocked unconscious. Esther attempts to kill him before Max stops her. While Daniel is hospitalized, Esther tries to smother him, but doctors quickly revive him. Kate realizes this and attacks Esther, screaming, but orderlies help John to restrain her. As John takes Esther and Max home, doctors sedate Kate.   That night, Esther, wearing a strapless black dress and heavy dark makeup, tries to seduce a drunken John, who finally believes Kate and threatens to send Esther back to the orphanage. Meanwhile, as Kate is coming out of sedation, she receives a call from Doctor Värava at the Saarne Institute, who reveals that Esther is not a 9-year-old child at all. She is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer from Estonia. She has [[hypopituitarism]], a condition that stunted her physical growth and caused proportional dwarfism, and has spent most of her life posing as a little girl. Värava tells Kate that Leena is extremely violent with a severe mental illness and has murdered at least seven people, including a family who adopted her in Estonia; after the father rejected her sexual advances, she killed the whole family and burned their house down in revenge. Leena was later put into a straight jacket, restraining her and leaving scars on her wrists and neck when she tried to break free from it. Leena had concealed these scars by tying ribbons over them as part of her “Esther” disguise. The doctor concluded that Leena had vanished from the institute a year earlier and hasn’t been seen since.   Meanwhile, Leena flies into a violent rage after being spurned by John and ransacks her room. She removes her makeup, false teeth, and body wrappings, revealing wrinkles and dark spots on her face, badly decayed adult teeth, and a fully mature body. After Leena shuts the power in the whole house, John discovers Leena's paintings in her bedroom, which, when exposed to the black light from her fish tank, show hidden scenes of pornography and gore. Max witnesses Leena stabbing John to death and hides. Kate calls the police and rushes home to find John dead. Leena gets a gun from John's safe and shoots Kate in the arm, then goes searching for Max, finding her in the greenhouse. While Leena shoots at Max, Kate crawls onto the greenhouse roof, breaks through the glass above Leena, and lands on her, knocking her out. Kate takes the gun and leaves the greenhouse with Max.  Leena regains consciousness and finds Kate and Max outside near a frozen pond. Leena lunges at Kate, knocking the gun out of Kate's hand and hurling them both onto the ice. Max watches from a hill above, picks up the gun and tries to shoot Leena, but shatters the ice instead, causing Kate and Leena to drop into the water. After a brief struggle, Kate climbs partially out of the pond with Leena clinging to her legs. Leena, hiding a knife behind her back and reverting to her little-girl persona, begs Kate not to let her die, calling her "mommy." Kate angrily responds that she is not her mother and viciously kicks Leena in the face, breaking her neck and letting her sink into the pond. Max and Kate are met by the police moments after.

When asked by de La Bath why Koulechov does not like the dictatural [[Brazilian military government]] of the time, she lists its examples of [[totalitarianism]] that the puzzled de La Bath finds the same as the France of [[Charles de Gaulle]].  :- ''Do you know what a dictatorship is ? It's when people are communists, when they are cold with gray hats and boots with zippers. That's a dictatorship !''  :- ''Then, what do you call a country with a military leader controlling everything, a secret police, a single TV channel with every information controlled by the state ?''  :- ''I call that "France", Miss. "General De Gaulle's France..."''  Throughout the film, de La Bath is forced to engage with [[hippies]], exploration of [[sexuality]], [[gender roles]] in different [[belief systems]], and his personal convictions about society and prejudice.  
The Other Man (2008 film)
 In Cambridge, Lisa (Linney) is a shoe designer, happily married for the last 25 years to Peter (Neeson), a software CEO. They have a daughter, Abigail ([[Romola Garai]]). Lisa frequently travels to [[Milan]] to do business with the Gianni & Gianni Company.   After Lisa dies, Peter is rooting around his house in an attempt to rid himself of Lisa's stuff and help deal with the grief. Abigail takes one of her mother's shoes and pulls a piece of paper out of it, saying it was for Peter to find. On the paper is written "Lake Como". Soon after this, Peter finds a strange message on her cell phone from a man, wishing only to hear Lisa's voice. It creates a tension in the mind of Peter. When he checks her e-mails he finds several similar requests from "Ralph". He also finds on her computer a folder named "Love", which is password protected. It creates a strong suspicion in his mind that she has had a secret affair and that her lover is mailing her now. He tries to open the folder by guessing the password, but in vain.   Peter wrongly accuses one of Lisa's co-workers named Ralph of being her lover. He replies to the mails of Ralph pretending to be Lisa. He asks one of his co-workers to find out the real name and location of the sender of these e-mails by tracing his IP address through his email address. His co-worker tells him that Ralph has an address in Milan. Peter continues to try to access the "Love" folder on Lisa's computer, and becomes increasingly frustrated. When he types "Lake Como" as the password, the folder opens. It contains many photos of her with a man in intimate moments and near [[Lake Como]].  In order to find out more about his wife's lover, he locates and secretly follows Ralph (Banderas) in Milan. He then goes to a café, one of Ralph's haunts, and begins to play chess alone. Ralph (pronounced "Rafe" he learns) engages him in conversation, and they begin to play chess and talk. Ralph easily speaks about Lisa and their relationship, unaware that Peter is Lisa's husband. Ralph tells him that it is he who has suggested she start a shoe designing business after perceiving her unique understanding of shoes and her passion towards different new designs, which the industry lacks. Over a period of time, they play several games of chess and, as far as Ralph is concerned, have a friendship.  Abigail learns of her mother's affair, while listening to her mother's voicemail, and deduces her father's frightening obsession with vengeance. She goes to Milan and tries to convince her father to stop hunting for Lisa’s lover as she had already gone, as well as to accept her partner George (who is a scruffy musician). She also warns him that his craziness will lead him to lose everything, including his daughter, career and friends.   Peter becomes greatly upset and he goes uninvited, with murderous intent, to Ralph's apartment. There, to his surprise, he learns that Ralph is not the cosmopolitan man of the world as he has been portraying himself, but an impoverished janitor. Peter's hate diminishes, but not his urge to avenge. He sends an e-mail, as Lisa, to Ralph, asking that he meet her at Lake Como. Ralph tells Peter about his upcoming meeting, and Peter gives him money to enable the meeting. Ralph also plans to throw a party for Lisa in London, as he sees this latest meeting as a sign that their relationship is taking off.  Ralph goes to Lake Como, but instead of finding Lisa there, Ralph finds Peter waiting for him. Peter reveals to Ralph that he was Lisa's husband, and that Lisa is actually dead. Ralph tells Peter that Lisa had known about his humble background and helped him financially on several occasions. He also forces Peter to confront that it is his excessive devotion for his work and cold nature towards marital life, which had moved Lisa to seek warmth in Ralph's arms, but still loving Peter so much that she never was ready to leave him, in spite of cheating with Ralph. Throughout this conversation, it is shown through flashbacks that Lisa died of cancer, and that she did not tell Peter about it until 'it was too late'.   It is then revealed in flashback that when Lisa was critically ill and about to die, she wrote something on a piece of paper and asked her daughter to put it in one of her red shoes so that one day Peter would find it. Lisa instructs Abigail not to tell him about the note, and assures her that he will definitely look for it and find it on his own one day. This is the piece of paper with "Lake Como" on it seen earlier.  When Ralph had asked her to tell Peter about their affair, end their marriage and move in with him, Lisa refused, saying that she did not want to hurt Peter and make him endure the pain of separation. She promised to reveal her dark secret to Peter at the appropriate time in her life so that he can forgive her for her infidelity. Peter and Ralph part, with Peter seemingly more bitter and upset than ever.  Ralph has arranged a dinner in Lisa's memory, and at first, Peter refuses to go. However, he realizes that "forgiveness and love need to replace hate", and arranges to be at the dinner with Abigail and her partner. Traveling home after the dinner, we see Peter reconciled with George.

Outlander (film)
 A spacecraft crashes in a lake in [[Vendel Period|Vendel]]-era [[Scandinavia]]. The only surviving occupant &ndash; a human &ndash; retrieves a distress beacon and a computer which explains that he is on Earth, a "seed" colony that his people have abandoned.  The computer downloads the local [[Proto-Norse language|Norse]] language and culture directly into his brain. The spaceman soon finds a freshly destroyed village, where he is captured by Wulfric ([[Jack Huston]]), a warrior from another village.  Wulfric takes him to the fortified village of King [[Hrothgar|Rothgar]] ([[John Hurt]]), father of Freya ([[Sophia Myles]]), who he hopes will marry future king Wulfric. Rothgar is concerned that Gunnar ([[Ron Perlman]]), chieftain of the destroyed village, will assume it was Wulfric's doing, as Wulfric's father (Rothgar's predecessor) had been killed by Gunnar. Wulfric interrogates the "outlander", who identifies himself as Kainan ([[Jim Caviezel]]), claiming he is from the north, and states that he is hunting a dragon. The village is attacked that night by an unseen creature, which kills several men. Kainan identifies it as a "Moorwen", a predatory creature which caused his ship to crash and now will hunt men and animals alike. When Kainan is taken with a hunting party to find the Moorwen, he kills a gigantic bear that had slain some of the hunters, proving himself to the others who begin treating him as a part of their tribe.  Gunnar and his men attack the settlement, retreating after casualties on both sides. They soon return, pursued by the Moorwen, and enter the safety of the village. Kainan devises a plan to build a huge pit just inside the village entrance, fill it with whale oil and leave wooden shields floating on the surface.  Freya becomes increasingly attracted to Kainan. He explains to her the Moorwen's origin&mdash;Kainan's people invaded its land (planet), slaughtered it in the billions and built a colony there. This Moorwen, now the last of its kind, massacred everyone in the colony, including Kainan's wife and child. When his "ship" returned to the colony, the Moorwen snuck onboard and later caused the crash. After listening to Kainan's tale, Freya gives him a family sword, saying she was told that she would know what man to give it to.  Kainan and Wulfric lure the Moorwen to the village. They cross the oil pit by running on the shields, but the Moorwen falls into the pit, and the oil is set on fire. The Moorwen bursts out, kills several people, then escapes. Meanwhile, an offspring of the Moorwen sneaks into the hall where the women and children are hiding. Eric, the orphaned boy that Kainan has begun looking after, alerts Rothgar, who is killed as the women and children escape. Kainan realizes that they need stronger weapons to kill the Moorwen. Kainan, Freya, and the newly-crowned King Wulfric return to the lake to retrieve fragments of metal from Kainan's submerged ship. While Kainan is underwater, the young Moorwen attacks the boat, taking Freya. Kainan and Wulfric return to the village, where the fragments are soon forged into weapons before descending into the Moorwens' lair.  Freya awakens on a pile of bodies in the underground lair. As the young Moorwen moves toward Freya, it is distracted by the sound of Kainan's hunting party. Many of the hunters are killed, but the young Moorwen is blinded by Boromir. When it returns to attack Freya, Kainan and Wulfric pass one of the new swords, with which she slays the young Moorwen. The cave exits to a high waterfall, where the adult Moorwen attacks. It seriously wounds Wulfric before Kainan engages it in battle.  When Freya joins in, Kainan is able to knock the Moorwen over the cliff's edge to its death. Freya and Kainan return to Wulfric's side, where he passes the kingship to Kainan just before he dies.  Kainan tells Freya to wait for the rest of the warriors, while he heads back to the lake. Night falls as Kainan retrieves some items from his ship, says goodbye to his wife's submerged coffin, then destroys his distress beacon just as Freya sees a rescue spaceship approaching, leading her to believe that Kainan was sent by the [[Asgard|gods]]. The rescue ship departs without Kainan, who stays as king, weds Freya and they adopt Eric.  
The Other Woman (2009 film)
 Emilia ([[Natalie Portman]]) is a young lawyer from New York, who in a short time has seen her disgraceful life come to tragedy: she and her husband Jack ([[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]]) have separated following the death of their only daughter, Isabel, from [[Sudden infant death syndrome|SIDS]]. Emilia views this loss as a punishment, particularly after finding out she is sterile, and cannot move on with her life by having more children.  Vilified as a homewrecker, she attracts the unyielding ire of Jack's furious ex-wife, Carolyn ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), who is revealed to also be pregnant (after she heard about Emilia's pregnancy, she realized that she too wanted another child). Emilia thinks that this is purely out of spite. Now she must come to terms with her step-son, William ([[Charlie Tahan]]), who upsets her with constant references to her late little girl (including saying that under the terms of Jewish law, Isabel did not live long enough to be considered a full human being). Emilia's efforts to bond with William do not go well and succeed only in making both Carolyn and Jack think less of her.  Conquered in her crisis and increasingly unfinished, Emilia finds the courage to tell Jack of the details never confessed about the death of their daughter Isabel, dead three days after the birth, that morning, Emilia did not find her dead in the crib, but on her breast, where most likely the baby girl was suffocated after her mother had fallen asleep, despite the fact that the couple had called an ambulance, there was nothing left to do, the terrible doubt of having killed her own daughter, is the real cause of her uneasiness.  She moves out, tentatively mends fences with her father (who earlier had cheated on her mother), and joins her old friends at a Legal Aid office. She is surprised when Carolyn calls her and asks her to come by her office. After initially being upset about Emilia moving out, Carolyn admits to telling William there is a possibility Emilia did accidentally kill Isabel because of Emilia's thoughtless ways; Carolyn seems chastened when she adds that her son was angry at her attitude and told her she should be ashamed of herself. She then tells a stunned Emilia that she has personally looked into the autopsy report on Isabel, and she can confirm that Emilia did not kill her baby girl. Emilia starts crying in realization that she has been punishing herself for so long, and that it was not her fault. Emilia later goes to Jack and tells him the full story, and while he tells her at that point that he cannot reconcile with her, a crisis involving Carolyn's City Hall wedding and William leads to Emilia getting through to his son and Jack saying he wants to go on a date with her, leaving Emilia happy and strongly hinting the couple will get back together soon.  On the day that Carolyn's son is born, Emilia takes William to the park and gives him a boat that was given to her when she was his age, she then says, "I love you William" and he replies "I know." He looks at her and away again and says, "Me too." The film ends with a montage of pictures and art, showing the various figures in the story.

Overheard (film)
 A major stock exchange in the world, [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|Hong Kong]] attracts not only money but any who try to manipulate the market. At the Hong Kong Police Force Commercial Crime Bureau, an operation is underway to infiltrate a trading company, Feng Hua International where a man, nicknamed "Boss" is the chief suspect. The team of Criminal Intelligence Bureau (CIB) officers, led by Inspector Leung (Lau Ching-wan) together with Yeung (Louis Koo) and Lam (Daniel Wu), installs interception devices to monitor the company's communications. Yeung is a family man, has a wife, a daughter, and a son who is suffering from a serious illness and needs constant attention, while Lam, a young new comer to the team, is to be married to the daughter of a wealthy man. Leung is a calm experienced officer who is having an affair with Mandy (Zhang Jingchu) who happens to be the wife of his friend Lee (Alex Fong).  One night, while monitoring a conversation between the company's manager and his secretary, Yeung and Lam overhear that the stock price will surge on market opening the next day. Seeing an opportunity, Yeung asks Lam to delete the portion of the recording so he can take advantage of it. The next day, Lam opens an account at a stock brokerage house but is discovered by Leung. However, Lam has already invested in the stock on a deep loan. The stock rises quickly, but before the trio manages to sell it, trading is suspended due to unusual trading activity.  Back in the operation center, the three of them overhear a plot to murder the manager over a listening device planted unofficially. To report the intelligence would lead them to suspicion and ruin their future, and Lam begs Leung not to report it. Having thought about it, Leung decides instead to stop the murder themselves. They ambush the murderer as he force-feeds the unconscious manager with pills to fake a death scene. Leung's face, however, is briefly seen by the manager's girlfriend. Seeing him again along with Yeung and Lam at the station after selling their shares worth $15 million, she calls the Boss's men, allowing him to track them down, seek retribution, and organise the deaths of Leung, Lam, Yeung, and their families. Because of Leung's compassion for his subordinates' mistakes and unwillingness to turn them in and seek help from the rest of the police force, he is unable to stop their unnecessary deaths. Faced with guilt, Leung turns himself in to the "Boss's" henchmen, and the Boss's subordinate, Wah, seemingly executes Leung in an unmarked grave, watched by the "Boss".  A year later the "Boss" gives a speech at a charity function. But during the recital, a video plays on screen showing the whole room the Boss's shadowy dealings the morning before. Surrounded by the police and ICAC officials, the Boss attempts to cut off the videofeed but is stopped and detained by a very much alive Inspector Leung. It is revealed that Leung had bought off Wah, promising the entire $15 million to him in exchange for not killing him prior to Leung's "execution". Wah would then act as Leung's agent in bringing down the Boss. While under police excort, the van carrying the Boss drives off course, and the driver is revealed to be Yeung, who was the sole survivor of the attempted murder of him and his family. Yeung drives himself and the Boss off the unfinished bridge into the harbour as part of a murder-suicide, while Leung sadly looks on and remembers the happy times with his two subordinates.

Pandorum
 In 2174, the human population has depleted all the resources on Earth, leading humanity to build a huge [[interstellar ark]] named ''Elysium''. It carries 60,000 people on a 123-year trip to colonize an [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]] named Tanis. The passengers are placed in [[sleeper ship|hypersleep]], with a rotating crew who take turns awakening from hypersleep every two years to maintain the ship. Eight years into the mission, the ship receives a transmission from Earth in multiple languages: "You're all that's left of us. Good luck, God bless, and godspeed."  Some unknown time later, two members of the flight crew, Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton, are awakened. Improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial [[amnesia]]. The ship is experiencing power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor, and they are unable to enter the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]].  While Payton stays behind to attempt to access the ship's computer, Bower ventures into the seemingly abandoned ship using the ventilation system with the intention of stabilising the reactor. He begins to suffer from "Orbital Dysfunction Syndrome," a severe psychotic illness known to affect deep-space travelers, commonly called "Pandorum." Pandorum led to the failure of a previous mission, as the captain of the starship called ''Eden'' became so afflicted with Pandorum that he became convinced that the flight was cursed and ejected all 5,000 passengers into deep space to their deaths.  Bower encounters Nadia, a geneticist, and Manh, an agriculturist, and they are attacked by a group of fast and vicious cannibalistic humanoids with a seemingly tribal culture. The trio flees into a barricaded chamber and finds a [[cook (profession)|cook]] named Leland, who has been awake for years, living off the water leaking into the ship, the algae it creates, and resorting to cannibalism. Meanwhile, Payton finds a young man named Corporal Gallo, who claims that the ship is lost in space. He claimed that he killed his team in self-defense because they developed Pandorum after finding out that Earth mysteriously vanished.  Leland gives food to Bower's group and shows them mural drawings depicting their true origin. According to the drawings, after Earth vanished following an unknown catastrophe, Gallo went insane. After killing his team, he begins to "play God" by awakening passengers and abusing them. Taking advantage of their mental state, Gallo then convinced these passengers, many of whom are affected by Pandorum, to exile themselves to the ship's enormous cargo hold and survive by fighting, torturing and eating each other. Eventually, Gallo went back into hypersleep, leaving the descendants of the psychotics to evolve. After multiple generations, accelerated by an [[enzyme]] produced in the hypersleep pod's feeding tubes, the passengers' descendants adapted to their living condition and became a [[troglofauna]] species, with Gallo's savage game becoming the centre of their culture.  After eating Leland's drug-laden food, the group falls asleep. When they wake up, Leland is preparing to kill and butcher them. Bower convinces him to let them fix the ship's reactor, otherwise the ship will be destroyed, killing them all. Noticing the ship's power has been unstable recently, Leland agrees to free the group. Bower hopes to find his wife on the ship before the creatures do, but later his memories come back to him and he remembers that she divorced him and stayed on Earth, disappearing along with the rest of the planet. This revelation almost makes him give up on the mission and pushes him closer to insanity.  When Bower's group finds the reactor, they find a large crowd of mutants sleeping around it. Bower tries to access the reactor computer by sneaking, but fails. While Manh distracts the mutants, Bower restarts the reactor, killing many mutants. Leland flees, and Manh is cornered by the mutant leader. In a one-on-one fight, Manh kills the leader, but is then killed by a mutant child that he hesitates to slay.  As Gallo becomes increasingly aggressive, Payton grows more worried, and prepares a [[sedative]] injection to subdue him. After the power is restored, Payton attempts to access the bridge, but Gallo assaults him and injects him with his own syringe. Gallo suddenly disappears, leaving Payton holding the syringe in his own hand. It is revealed that Gallo killed the real Payton long ago. Because he went in Payton's pod, he mistakenly believed himself to be Payton.  Leland makes his way to the bridge, and Gallo kills him by stabbing him with the syringe. When Bower and Nadia confront him, Gallo opens the shutters on the bridge's windows, revealing that the ship is adrift in deep space with no [[stars]] visible. The shock from the revelation pushes Bower even further to insanity and he begins to break down. Taking advantage of Bower's mental state, Gallo tries to convince him that they must maintain the violent society rather than attempt to revive civilization.  However, Nadia observes [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] ocean life through the windows, and the computer displays that 923 years have elapsed since the mission launched. It turns out that the ship reached Tanis 800 years ago, and automatically landed itself in the ocean. Gallo attacks Bower and Nadia, and Bower hallucinates mutants invading the bridge. In his delirium, Bower accidentally breaks a window and water pours into the ship. Nadia manages to snap Bower to reality, and they climb into a hypersleep pod, while Gallo and the remaining mutants drown. The flood triggers an emergency protocol which ejects all active pods to the surface.  Bower and Nadia surface near a lush [[coastline]], and witness the other pods ascending one by one. Thus begins Year One on Tanis, with 1,213 survivors from the original 60,000 passengers.

Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha (film)
 The story revolves around the unnatural death of a young woman named Manikyam ([[Mythili]]) in Paleri, a small village in northern Kerala, in the late 1950s. Although it was claimed by her in-laws that she died after she had a seizure, examination of the body revealed it to be a case of murder. The police charged three locals with the murder, only to be released by the court which described the prosecution's case as flawed. With no further investigation, the case had, since then, gone cold over the years, eventually acquiring the status of an unsolved mystery.  Around 52 years later, Haridas ([[Mammootty]]), a detective living in New Delhi, sets out on a journey to Paleri hoping to solve this mystery. Apparently, he was born in the same village on the same night when Manikyam was killed. He is joined by Sarayu ([[Gowri Munjal]]), a crime analyst.  Most of the clues and knowledge of Balan Nair ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) and Keshavan ([[Sreenivasan]]) lead him to zero in on Ahmed Haji (Again Mammootty), a cruel feudal landlord who lived in Paleri during that period. It was obvious why his name did not figure in police reports from that era; he was so powerful and influential in Paleri at that time. Slowly, as things become clear, Haridas deduces that the murderer is Khalid Ahmed (Again Mammootty), Haji's first wife's eldest son.

Back in the present day, Joong-shik is now the ringleader of a political protest group whose interests run from obstructing the city's plans of [[gentrification]] to strengthening relations with North Koreans. Squatting in Paju's derelict apartments, the group is under siege from an unidentified property developer who has engaged goons to bulldoze the buildings. With only the briefest of hints as to what has transpired, Eun-soo is nowhere to be seen and Joong-shik and Eun-mo are clearly at odds.

Palestrina - Prince of Music
 “To achieve artistic and economic independence, Palestrina works with great diplomacy in the shadow of the powerful Roman Catholic Church. Despite strict ecclesiastical rules, he succeeds in modernizing music.” <ref name="Pressetext">press communication Arte: Palestrina - Fürst der Musik</ref>  The film starts with the death of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina in 1594. Afterwards his son, Iginio, some of his students and colleagues, members of the [[Cappella Giulia]] (Julian Chapel) at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], and also members of the Roman clergy give their personal statements or testimony on Palestrina’s life and career: from his childhood, when he is trained as a choir-boy in the circle of the "Roman School" of polyphony founded by [[Costanzo Festa]], to the peak of his career, when the plague and an influenza epidemic take away his two oldest sons and his wife.  These testimonies reveal Palestrina as a typical Renaissance artist who takes his destiny into his own hands and maintains his artistic independence in the middle of the greedy Roman clergy, who are more interested in secular politics than in the spirituality of music. He developed a new style in polyphonic art, the genus novus with a balance between word and sound, in which all voices are separate and   independent from each other. Palestrina finally liberates music from the word. In this style he composes the famous [[Missa Papae Marcelli]], which, after the [[Council of Trent]], becomes the model for sacred music.  After having lost his two sons and his wife, the testimonies reveal with the wink of an eye, that Palestrina, instead of taking holy orders, decided to marry a very rich widow, enabling him to afford the publication of all his scores. In this way his work would never be forgotten.  Palestrina’s music is presented in the film by the Roman ‘Ensemble Seicentonovecento’, conducted by maestro Flavio Colusso.

One night the camera records Ellen sitting up in bed and leaving her bedroom. She walks into the living room, where she writes something on a piece of paper. She then crumples the paper and walks back down the hallway. Thomas finds the paper under Samantha's pillow and sees that it spells out the word "MARON".

A Perfect Getaway
 A young mild-mannered American couple, Cliff (Zahn) and Cydney (Jovovich), are celebrating their marriage by hiking to a remote beach in [[Hawaii]] while on their honeymoon. On their way, they see two hitchhikers, Cleo ([[Marley Shelton|Shelton]]) and Kale ([[Chris Hemsworth]]). They offer the pair a ride but change their minds when the two seem possibly dangerous.  After they begin the hike, the couple comes in contact with Nick (Olyphant), a solo hiker who claims to be an [[Iraq War]] veteran. Nick saves Cydney's life when she slips while attempting to cross a narrow ledge. The trio approaches a group of frightened female hikers discussing a double murder in [[Honolulu]]. The victims had their teeth pulled out and fingertips removed. Cliff suspects the hitchhiking couple are the murderers, and Cydney and Cliff discuss whether or not they should turn back, but decide to continue hiking with Nick. They subsequently meet up with Nick's sexy girlfriend, Gina (Sanchez) at the Secret Falls Waterfall.  Cliff suspects Kale and Cleo are following them. When he notices their permits are missing, Cliff sees Kale and Cleo's bags by the trail and goes through them, but he does not find the permits. After making camp, Nick and Cliff split up to search for Kale and Cleo. Cliff runs into a guide who is bringing Cliff the permits they left behind. Cliff and Nick return to the campsite. Nick brings a goat he has killed, and Gina proceeds to butcher the animal, explaining she had learned how while working in the meat department of a grocery store.  The following day, Kale and Cleo are arrested for the murders. A container full of pulled teeth is found in one of their bags. The two couples are relieved by the arrests, and they continue their hike to the beach. Cliff rents two kayaks so he and Nick can explore a marine cave.  As Gina idly looks through the photos on Cydney and Cliff's video camera, she is terrified when she realizes the couple are not who they claim to be. Gina sets off after Nick and Cliff, while Cydney chases after Gina.  Flashbacks reveal that Cliff and Cydney are drug-addicted sociopaths who murdered the newlyweds. They kill people and steal their identities in order to, as Cliff explains, "live a hundred different lives and achieve a kind of immortality". It is also revealed that "Cliff" had planted the bag of teeth in Kale and Cleo's bag to frame them for the murders.  In the sea cave, Cliff suddenly reveals his true murderer identity and shoots Nick in the head. Gina witnesses this from the cliffs above. Then Cliff shoots at her, but misses. Cydney sneaks up on Gina and attacks her. Gina is stabbed in the leg but manages to push Cydney off the cliff into the water.  Even though they have not had a signal during the entire trip, Gina fortuitously receives a call on her cell phone from a phone company representative. She begs him to call the police. She spots Cydney below in the kayak just as Cliff pops up over the cliff ledge to grab her feet. Gina stabs him in the hand with Cydney's knife and flees.  While Cliff chases Gina and Cydney kayaks ashore to intercept the police, Nick, saved by the titanium plate in his head from his war wound, wakes up. Gina runs into a group of men searching for their stolen kayaks, who tell her she is safe now. Cliff tries to convince the men that Gina is [[stimulant psychosis|irrational due to meth use]]. But one of the group happens to be an [[emergency medical technician|EMT]] and notices Cliff's [[mydriasis|enlarged pupils]], which undermines his story, so Cliff shoots and kills the entire group of men. Gina uses Cliff's distraction as an opportunity to run toward the beach. Nick arrives and fights Cliff, getting the upper hand.  At that point, the police arrive by helicopter with a rifle aimed at Nick. Cydney is also in the helicopter, and the police want her to confirm that Nick is the killer, but she pauses. Cydney identifies Cliff as the murderer and says he ruined her life. The police sharpshooter kills Cliff as he reaches for his gun to kill Nick. Later, Nick finally proposes to Gina in the helicopter but due to their traumatic encounters, they both agree to not having a honeymoon.

Perkins' 14
  Ten years after officer Dwayne Hopper’s son disappeared, the last of 14 victims in a string of local unsolved disappearances, his suspicions are aroused by prison inmate Ronald Perkins ([[Richard Brake]]). Dwayne searches Perkins’ house and discovers a collection of torture videos featuring the missing victims from the past. In a fit of rage, Dwayne kills Perkins.  But things get complicated when a wave of carnage sweeps the town, with reports of Dwayne’s own son amongst the marauding psychopaths. A number of flashbacks start to reveal that Hopper's son was kidnapped from his home, wondering if his son is still alive. Earlier in the film, Hopper begins to question Perkins' motive on how he knows that Hopper has a family, namely his wife and daughter.  After doing some digging on Perkins' file, Hopper comes to a horrible realization that Perkins kidnapped his son years ago. Hopper tries to help him, but arrived too late. Hopper then shows the file to Perkins, and tells him he doesn't have a family. He calls his deputy, Hal to cone down to the station to see if the man in the cell is the killer he had been looking for, but Hal becomes skeptical at this.  He then looks through Perkins' personal belongings and realized that there is no record of Ronald Perkins' living in town. A friend of the judge tells him that they will have search warrant in the morning, but Hopper decides to call his deputy to look at Perkins' home and finds a backroom in the basement full of scientific equipment. Hal notices a cage with someone inside and gets attacked by a crazed woman. During their conversation, Perkins reveals that his own family was killed by a burglar to Hopper.  Perkins tries to sympathize with Hopper for losing someone they loved. Meanwhile, Hopper's daughter is out with her friends, not knowing that they are being watched by someone close by. Daisy and her boyfriend run for their lives after two of their friends are murdered. Her father arrives just in time to save her, and shoots the suspect. To their shock, the suspect comes back to life and is run over. The chief of police decides to declare a state of emergency.  Hopper finds out that his own son is still alive as he witnesses him killing someone in the street. Hopper's wife Janine is having an affair after her son disappeared. Daisy tells her father that Janine is at a motel with her boyfriend, whom she witnesses being beaten to death by a woman with a champagne bottle. A local holds Daisy's boyfriend, Eric at knifepoint when he tells Hopper that everyone is dead. Hopper realizes that Perkins wanted to get revenge by taking 14 children with him.  They arrive at the motel to find Janine safe and sound. Hopper then leads the killers into a fight, while Janine, Daisy, and Eric seek shelter at the police station to wait for help. A deputy and the others decide to find safety in the basement when they learn their inside. Eric is then ripped to pieces by the killers. Hopper then arrives with a shotgun and kills them. They start to hear Felicity, an animal rights activist, calling for help in one of the cells.  Hopper also realizes that Perkins took the kids to make the townspeople suffer the way he suffered. Felicity hears a strange noise in the bathroom, where she is attacked and killed by someone hiding in the ceiling. The deputy realized that there is no way out. Hopper's son tries to attack him, but the deputy holds them at gunpoint, resulting in him getting shot dead by Hopper. Janine volunteers to get help, where Hopper promises to take care of Daisy, if anything should happen to her.  Hopper and Daisy watch on the video monitor that the killers are planning an ambush, where they attack and kill Janine, much to their horror. Hopper tries to deal with the situation himself by not endangering Daisy. He then gives her a shotgun to protect herself. Hopper tries to reason with his son, "Kyle", while police sirens start to approach the station. Hopper wants Kyle to remember his lost childhood, such as playing chess. Kyle kills Hopper by snapping his neck. Kyle then kills Daisy with a shotgun when he ignores his sister's pleas for mercy.  
Perrier's Bounty
  Michael McCrea ([[Cillian Murphy]]), a perpetual waster, has passed out during the afternoon. He awakes to find two thugs, Ivan ([[Michael McElhatton]]) and Orlando (Don Wycherley), staring at him. They remind him that he owes money to Darren Perrier ([[Brendan Gleeson]]), a local crime boss. The debt must be paid that night, or Ivan and Orlando will break two of Michael's bones of his own choice. After they depart, Michael goes downstairs and sees his friend Brenda ([[Jodie Whittaker]]) carrying a bouquet of flowers. She informs Michael that her boyfriend, Shamie ([[Pádraic Delaney]]), with whom she has a rocky relationship, has given her the flowers by way of apologising for his absenteeism. Michael is uninterested, and leaves the building in pursuit of a loan to pay off his debt.  Michael heads to Delgado's Pool Hall, a nearby [[snooker]] bar, in search of a man known as The Mutt ([[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]]), who provides loans. There, Michael's friend Clifford ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]) explains that The Mutt was recently thrown out of the bar after assaulting a man who insulted his snooker skills. Leaving the bar, Michael clashes with two clampers (Ned Dennehy and Glenn Speers), who vow to find him and clamp his car later. Michael goes home to find his father, Jim McCrea ([[Jim Broadbent]]), waiting outside. Their relationship is not good, and Michael is reluctant to talk. However, Jim reveals that he is dying of cancer and wishes to reconcile. The two go to a pub to drink, but while there,  Michael learns of The Mutt's location in another pub. He abandons his father, promising to talk later.  At the next pub, Michael runs into Shamie, who is making out with a girl. Michael is angry and tells Shamie he needs to show Brenda some respect and end their relationship if he wants to pursue other girls. Michael then finds The Mutt, who is drinking with his associate Dinny (Breffni McKenna). He asks The Mutt for a loan, but is refused. Giving up, Michael begins to drink at the bar only to be assaulted by an angry Shamie. Michael overpowers Shamie and demands he break up with Brenda. Storming off, he is stopped by The Mutt, who asks if Michael will join him and Dinny in a burglary. The money earned will pay off Michael's debt, but he won't get it until morning. Michael agrees, and the three head out.  The burglary goes off without a hitch, and The Mutt finds pictures that prove the home owner is cheating on his wife. The trio plan to blackmail him out of €30,000. Michael is dropped off and is assured he will get his €10,000 in the morning. Back at his car, he finds his car clamped. Ivan and Orlando then return and drive their truck full speed into the clamped car. Michael flees the scene and loses them, then returns to his home in search of the pistol he keeps under his bed. However, Brenda has stolen the gun and is contemplating suicide after being dumped by Shamie. She locks Michael out of her apartment just as Ivan and Orlando enter, having predicted that he would come home. They begin to beat Michael with a bat and prepare to break his leg. Before they can do so, Orlando is shot dead by Brenda. Ivan runs away to tell Perrier. While comforting Brenda, Jim enters and, noticing the body, tells them they need to properly dispose of Orlando. The three get into Brenda's car and go to an escarpment, where they bury Orlando. Jim comments that the locale is beautiful and refers to its history, commenting that men who lived and died by the sword were buried here. Brenda's car becomes flooded and they cannot get away, so Michael and Brenda spend the night in her car, while Jim stands outside, spending the whole night awake, watching Dublin.  At Perrier's hideout, he discusses Orlando's death with four other members of his crew. It is revealed to him that Ivan and Orlando were lovers. Perrier goes to comfort the grieving Ivan, telling him that he is not judgemental about his homosexual relationship and that he will be putting a €10,000 bounty on Michael and Brenda.  Back at Brenda's car, it is morning and Michael notices that his father has been up all night. Jim then admits that he does not have cancer, but instead believes he was visited by the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]. During his visit, the Reaper informed Jim that the next time he sleeps, he will die. Upset that his father played on his sympathies, Michael wakes Brenda and tells her that her car has to be burned. Once it is aflame, the trio head back into the city. They are caught in a rain storm and take shelter at a farm, but the farm owner (Jane Brennan) calls the police and claims the trio raped her. Having fled down the road, they take cover upon seeing a [[Garda Síochána]] patrol car. Once it has passed, they cut through a forest. Brenda vows to make her relationship with Shamie work, and an angry Michael berates her for blindly loving Shamie despite his lack of faithfulness and love for her. While Jim takes him aside, Brenda storms off and, once they notice she is gone, Michael and Jim follow. They catch up with her as she is being arrested by two police officers. While sneaking up on them, Jim snatches Michael's gun and confronts the officers. The trio steal the police car and Michael receives a call from The Mutt, who gives them his location in order for Michael to pick up his share of the blackmail earnings.  With plans to meet The Mutt behind a factory at one in the afternoon, Brenda demands that, in the meantime, she be dropped off at Shamie's so she can try to restore their relationship. Along the way, the trio encounter a young man ([[Chris Newman (actor)|Chris Newman]]) and two of his mates joyriding in a stolen car. Jim and the man talk and the two trios swap cars. In their new stolen car, they arrive at Shamie's; however, Brenda arrives just as a nearly naked woman strolls out and a nearly naked Shamie runs after her. The two start to get intimate in the hallway just as Shamie notices Brenda, but Brenda runs away. Outside the building, Brenda bypasses the car and runs down a nearby street, prompting Michael to chase after her and comfort her. Jim, left behind, approaches Jerome ([[Brendan Coyle]]) and Russ ([[Conleth Hill]]), two members of the Savage Canine Vernacular, who are training their [[Rottweiler]]s to attack. Jim helps them, and then picks up Michael and Brenda.  They trio arrive at the warehouse and Michael heads in alone to get his share. He meets with The Mutt and Dinny, but the two plan on betraying him. The Mutt knocks Michael out with a wrench and he and Dinny carry the unconscious Michael to The Mutt's car. As they are putting him in the boot, Jim approaches, armed with a pistol. He knocks both Dinny and The Mutt out while Brenda steals the entire €30,000. With Michael back in the car, the trio head out.  Hiding out in another industrial area, Jim reveals the reason why Michael became estranged from his parents. After witnessing a local thug, Steve Lynch, beating up a woman, Michael intervened and beat up Lynch. Lynch returned to Michael's house later, where only his mother, Elaine, was home. Lynch proceeded to assault Elaine, leaving her badly injured. Believing his parents blamed him for the attack, Michael broke off contact with them. Elaine and Jim would later split up, with Elaine moving to [[County Clare]]. Jim then asks Michael if he can have some [[cocaine]], and Michael agrees, taking him to Delgado's Pool Hall in order to buy off of Clifford. However, during the sale, Clifford signals Mulligan, played by the Irish novelist ([[Patrick McCabe (novelist)|Patrick McCabe]]), who calls Perrier. While Jim is snorting coke in the bathroom and Michael and Brenda are talking, Perrier and his goons enter. Michael accidentally fires off his pistol, causing everyone to take cover. Other gang members, primarily Ivan, begin shooting but Brenda, angry at Clifford, beats him over the head and she and Michael use him as a human shield to escape. Clifford is killed in the process, and Jim is left behind. Upon exiting Delgado's, the pair find that their stolen car has been clamped, and are forced to flee on foot. Thankfully, Shamie is able to find them in his car, announcing that he has been looking for Brenda. Michael and Brenda jump into his car.  Outside Delgado's, Perrier and his crew join with The Mutt and Dinny. Jerome and Russ approach, but their dogs growl and Perrier coldly shoots them. Jim walks out of the hall just as the gangs are leaving, but The Mutt notices him and he is taken hostage. Meanwhile, Shamie has tried to reconcile with Brenda, but she refuses him and her and Michael take his car at gunpoint. They take refuge in a hotel. They receive a call from a badly beaten Jim who explains to Michael that he is going to "take a nap" after the phone call - implying, true to his vision, that he will die. Despite this, Michael arms himself and prepares to go to Perrier's hideout. Brenda tries to warn him against it, but the two share a passionate kiss and Michael heads out in Shamie's car.  Michael arrives at Perrier's hideout, with the €30,000 and a pistol hidden in the crotch of his pants. He is informed that his father is going to die that night, though it will be quick. Michael's death, however, will be slow. He is pinned down on the table while Ivan attempts to castrate him. Before it can be done, however, The Mutt asks for his money so he can leave. Perrier pockets the money, just as Hank ([[Francis Magee]]) shoots and kills Dinny. In the confusion, Michael is able to escape, and Perrier kills The Mutt. Two of Perrier's cronies pursue Michael, who has acquired a golf club. He uses it first to knock out Blaise (Wuzza Conlon) and then Victor (Brendan Dempsey). Michael, now armed with a pistol, returns and confronts Perrier, Ivan, Hank, and Kenny (Brian Doherty). Lining them up against a wall, Michael takes their guns and his money. Kenny calls his bluff, and is shot in the leg. Michael then pushes his father out of the building and loads him into Shamie's car. At the same time, Perrier reveals that he has an [[AK-74u]] hidden under the snooker table. With that in hand, he, Ivan, and Hank head outside to confront Michael, who is attempting to flee. Perrier fires into the car as Michael reverses, and Jim is hit in the chest. They comment on how the Reaper came after all, and Jim calls him a cunt. An enraged Michael charges out of the car at Perrier, firing his gun, wounding Ivan and Hank in the process. Perrier shoots at Michael, severely wounding him. Before Perrier can finish him, multiple vans pull up, brought to the location by Brenda, containing members of the Savage Canine Vernacular. They set their dogs upon Perrier, who is mauled to death. Brenda, Jerome, and Russ inform a semi-conscious Michael that they're taking him to Derek Dawson, the best veterinarian in the business.  The next morning, Michael, having had his wounds treated, and Brenda are at the funeral for Jim, who is buried alongside Achilles and Apollo, Russ and Jerome's dogs, at the same place that the trio had buried Orlando earlier. A heartfelt eulogy is given, and Michael and Brenda profess their love for each other. The pair then head to County Clare, where Michael intends to reconcile with his mother. The narrator, implied to be the Reaper, ponders as to whether the experience has made Michael a better man, possibly an enlightened man. He is shown waving at his mother before the camera fades out.

The Pink Panther 2
 When the master thief The Tornado steals expensive artifacts from around the world, France assembles a Dream Team of Amateur Detectives to solve the case. Inspector Clouseau is reassigned from his task as a parking officer by Chief Inspector Dreyfus to join the Dream Team in Japan, site of the Tornado's recent heist. At the airport, as soon as he steps over the border and leaves France, news breaks that the Pink Panther diamond has been stolen, prompting Clouseau, who had up to that point been wary of leaving, to say, "I told you".   Clouseau travels back to the scene of the crime and joins the other members of the Dream Team: Inspector Pepperidge, from Great Britain; Vincenzo, from Italy; Kenji, an electronics specialist from Japan; and Sonia, a researcher and criminology expert from India. They go to Rome to investigate a black market fence, Alonso Avellaneda, who deals with The Tornado. Assuming he is The Tornado, the Dream Team question him while Clouseau snoops around. Avellaneda vindicates himself by demonstrating that he lacks a bullet-wound to the right shoulder that the Tornado suffered over a decade ago. After they leave, he meets with the real Tornado.  That night, Clouseau and his partner, Ponton, spy on Avellaneda, using a wire they planted on him, as he takes a date out for dinner. The mission is compromised when they find Vincenzo and Clouseau's girlfriend, Nicole, together at the restaurant. Having been banned for burning down the restaurant three months earlier, Clouseau disguises himself as a dancer and switches the wire to Nicole's table. In the process, he ends up burning down the restaurant again. At the same time, The Tornado steals the [[Ring of the Fisherman|Pope's ring]], an act which turns public opinion against the Dream Team.   When Clouseau's acts of foolishness aggravate the situation, he is voted off the team; only Sonia sympathizes with him. Shortly afterward, Clouseau is called to an office where they see the Tornado has killed himself and left a suicide note that claims he destroyed the Pink Panther – regarding it as being so beautiful that he could not bring anyone other than himself to own it – and left the other treasures to be recovered. Examining a key they found in the Pope's Chambers, they match the DNA of the victim with DNA of the Tornado acquired when he was shot, and thus believe themselves to have solved the case. However, Clouseau is unconvinced and believes the Tornado was not the thief.  For their victory, a celebration is thrown in the Dream Team's honor. Clouseau, who was not invited, discovers something in a license plate of Sonia's car and calls Ponton. He tries to tell Dreyfus the real thief is still at large, but is ignored. Dreyfus relays to the group that Clouseau told him Sonia was the thief, and the group, treating the idea as a joke, work out a plausible explanation for how she could have done it; as the Tornado's ex-lover, she would have in-depth knowledge of his methods, and has set up a situation to draw all attention to the thefts of the other artifacts while leaving her free to sell the Pink Panther. As Sonia leaves, Nicole, beginning to realize that what Clouseau and the group said could be true, asks her to take everything out of her purse. Sonia pulls out a gun, and after initially threatening to shoot Nicole, she shoots Clouseau, but the bullet hits the medal of honor. A chase ensues, with Clouseau and the Dream Team attempting to catch Sonia, while all the members of the team but Clouseau make fools of themselves through various accidents caused by Clouseau's clumsiness.   Finally cornered, Sonia threatens to destroy the Pink Panther, and Clouseau goads her to do so. Sonia attempts to escape, but is knocked out by Ponton and arrested by the police. Clouseau reveals that Sonia had destroyed a fake gem; Clouseau had, in fact, kept the real Pink Panther in his possession, having switched them at the museum before he was about to leave France. The Tornado, an expert on gems, would have recognized the Pink Panther to be a fake; therefore, his suicide note was forged, and he was murdered. He reveals that he had given Sonia's car a ticket two days before the Pink Panther was stolen, contradicting her alibi of having been delayed to the crime scene because of her flight, which revealed to him that Sonia was the culprit. Dreyfus tries to claim credit for having appointed Clouseau to his parking job, but Clouseau, remembering Dreyfus told him to deny this to anyone who asked, rebukes the claim.   The film ends with Clouseau marrying Nicole in a ceremony hosted by Dreyfus and attended by the Dream Team, but the ceremony ends in complete chaos caused by a raid from the Gas Mask Bandits, with Clouseau and Nicole escaping as the animated Pink Panther watches; he then goes to close the doors and winks at the camera.  
Pig Business
 The film begins with an introduction by Tracy Worcester in which she reflects upon the role that the countryside and small-scale farms have had on her personal and family life. She proceeds to argue that this [[cultural heritage]] is under-threat from large-scale corporations that, driven by [[profit maximization]], have replaced traditional farming with a system that treats animals as a mere raw material or input in an industrial system.  Worcester narrates the history and development of these large-scale corporations through the [[Anti-competitive_practices|anti-competitive]] practices of [[vertical_integration|vertical]] and [[horizontal integration]]. Through interviews with affected parties, as well as footage of campaign rallies and undercover exposés within factory farms, the film suggests that powerful corporations may take advantage of a monopoly position by acting in an [[business_ethics|unethical]] manner. It states that because the [[externality|external costs]] of intensive animal farming are not taken into consideration by consumers, the industry constitutes an example of [[market failure]].   Of particular focus is the expansion of food giant [[Smithfield Foods]] within Poland, a location selected for its low costs and strategic access to the [[European Union]] market, following Smithfield's acquisition of the former state-owned meat producer Animex Foods in 1999.<ref>http://en.animex.pl/animex/company/</ref> Drawing on testimony from Polish academics, politicians, industry leaders, farmers and villagers, the film argues that poor [[Corporate_governance|corporate regulation]] has resulted in a number of human and environmental disasters within Poland. Specifically, Animex is accused of causing harm to human health through the over-application of [[Manure|pig slurry]] as an agricultural fertilizer, as well as of [[Antibiotic_use_in_livestock|antibiotic misuse]] within factory farms. Worcester further suggests that Smithfield has influenced government legislation through the sponsoring of sympathetic politicians with financial grants.   Speaking in 2006, then CEO of Animex Foods Morten Jensen<ref>https://www.campofriofoodgroup.com/company/organisation/morten-jensen?q=morten_jensen</ref> states that Animex is compliant with all Polish and European environmental legislation. In an interview given in 2008, Smithfield's Vice-President of environmental and corporate affairs Dennis H Treacy<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=1522487&privcapId=303885&previousCapId=303885&previousTitle=Smithfield%20Foods,%20Inc.</ref> states that contamination caused by slurry is illegal and that the organisation goes to "extra-ordinary lengths to ensure that they have a system in place that doesn't allow that".

Planet 51’s army, led by the paranoid General Grawl, arrives to inspect the spacecraft. Grawl deduces that Chuck is an alien invader bent on turning planet’s population into zombies, and a manhunt ensues throughout Glipforg.   Lem enlists the help of his best friend Skiff to hide Chuck away from the army. During his efforts to conceal Chuck, Lem inadvertently upsets his neighbor and crush Neera, who believes the alien is friendly, and is also fired from his job when his boss discovers Chuck. In Lem’s room, Chuck reunites with a dog-like NASA probe called Rover, which freed itself from the army’s base. After the army searches Lem’s home for traces of the alien, Lem and Skiff move Chuck to a comic book store Skiff works at, where Glipforg’s news station manages to capture Chuck acting out references to Earth’s pop culture, which is misinterpreted as alien threats. After escaping the store from the invading army, Grawl has Chuck’s spacecraft moved to a secret location. Chuck is later captured by Grawl’s forces during a festive movie premiere in town, and is slated to have his brain removed by alien scientist Professor Kipple. When Lem defends Chuck, Kipple deems him a zombie minion. Chuck, resigned to his fate, pretends to release Lem from his "mind control" and is taken away with Rover to Base 9, which Grawl inadvertently reveals.  Lem gets his job back, but is determined to rescue Chuck. Joined by Skiff, Neera, her younger brother Eckle, and Rover (who escaped the army again), Lem tracks down Base 9’s location in the desert. They free Chuck from Professor Kipple and find his spacecraft, but they are cornered by Grawl and his forces. Bent on eliminating Chuck, Grawl reveals has the base rigged to explode. Lem tricks the General into activating the countdown. Enraged, Grawl attempts to shoot Lem, but misses and the stray bullet ignites an explosive, causing Grawl to be trapped under debris. Chuck rescues Grawl before launching his spacecraft into Planet 51’s orbit, escaping Base 9’s destruction. After admiring Planet 51’s view from space, Lem successfully asks Neera out of a date, while Grawl expresses his gratitude to Chuck for saving him.

As the duo talk about their heartbreaking experiences over lunch, they notice a Taiwanese couple arguing over a red couch that is delivered on their doorstep. When the couple and delivery workers abandon the couch, Manuel sees it as a sign from God and decides that he and Dado bring it back to their dormitory. After a friend overcharges them for offering to deliver it on his truck and the local bus refuses to accommodate it, Dado and Manuel have no choice but to carry the couch on foot. In the middle of their journey, they cross a street when a drunk motorcyclist collides with the couch.

The duo get into an argument and Dado threatens to leave Manuel at the plant, but he changes his mind when he steals a shopping cart from a group of kids and they strap the couch on it. Later, Manuel and Dado argue over using the couch as a side business at the dormitory when a news reporter stops to interview them after they indirectly prevented a young man from jumping off an apartment building during their journey. After they run away from the reporter, she broadcasts a report on them, asking if they are thieves or heroes.

[[Palkia]] then arrives to save Dialga from another typhoon, and Sheena, once again, uses her ability to sync with the two to thank them. Taking the kids to the temple, Sheena and Kevin explain that they investigate disruptions in time and space, and worry that [[Arceus]], the creator of the dimensions, is to awaken, and that he is responsible for the encounters between Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina.  Sheena explains that centuries ago, Arceus saved Earth from a meteor storm and nearly died with the loss of his sixteen Life Plates, but a man named Damos saved him. In gratitude, Arceus fused five of his plates into the Jewel of Life, which turned the town of Michina into a paradise. Arceus asked Damos to return the Jewel to him, but Damos proceeded to betray Arceus and attacked him. Arceus was forced to go into a long slumber, but he vowed to awaken and judge humanity.

The kids, [[Pikachu]], and [[Piplup]] are imprisoned, but the latter two are released by a notch-eared [[Pichu]]. The kids meet Damos, who was imprisoned by Marcus, who is actually the true culprit behind the betrayal, using his [[Bronzong]]'s Hypnosis to manipulate Damos into becoming his pawn. Unaware of Marcus' true role, Sheena tells him everything about the future. Pikachu, Piplup, and Pichu free the kids and Damos. Arceus arrives to collect the Jewel of Life, hidden in Marcus' scepter, but the fooled Sheena ends up being the one who betrays him. Arceus is forced into a pit and is wounded by silver water and electrical attacks. Marcus' intention is to kill Arceus himself to save the future. Sheena and Damos use their abilities to free the Pokémon under Marcus' control, including Heatran and Bronzong. Ash and Dawn (with the help of [[Chikorita]], [[Cyndaquil]], and [[Totodile]]) confront Marcus, and Ash obtains the real Jewel of Life.  Arceus absorbs the Jewel of Life, restoring his own life force and those of the future. Arceus rescues his saviors from the collapse of the temple. Ash, Dawn, Brock, and Sheena are transported to the future, only to discover that Arceus is still furious and has defeated Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina. Arceus spots Ash and recognizes him due to history's alterations, and reverses the destruction he caused and heals his servants. Ash and the others discover Damos has put them on a mural, thanking them for their help in saving the world. Arceus and his followers depart to their respective dimensions, with Arceus realizing that he is truly a part of the world that he created.  In the credits, it is shown that Marcus works for Damos after his defeat, Newton visits Zero in prison while the [[Shaymin]] discover a new location, and Alberto is still hitting on Alice as [[Darkrai]] looks on.

Possession (2009 film)
 Jess (Gellar) is a sweet-natured but driven [[lawyer]] who puts her career ahead of her personal life and ahead of her marriage to her artist husband, Ryan (Landes). The couple is on the verge of their first wedding anniversary and, though they are happy, the thorn in the side of their relationship is Ryan's younger brother Roman (Pace). Where Ryan comes across as an honest and sweet man, Roman is the direct opposite. Roman is moody and violent, particularly with his casual girlfriend Casey (Novotny), and Jess is terrified of him, particularly as she met Ryan through Roman when she represented him in court on an [[aggravated assault]] charge. When Roman overhears Jess and Ryan discussing their plans to send him to a [[halfway house]], he packs his bags and leaves in his car.  Jess calls Ryan, worried about what the impulsive Roman will do, and Ryan quickly heads home in his car. As the brothers cross the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], they crash into one another and are both seriously injured. Jess goes to the hospital and learns that both Roman and Ryan are in [[coma]]s. Casey arrives and shares a few words with Jess, who promises to keep her updated. Later, Jess gets her mail and finds one of Ryan's weekly handwritten love letters. After several weeks, Roman suddenly awakens—but he immediately claims to be Ryan, begging Jess to believe that he is her husband returned to her in his brother's body. He implies that something [[supernatural]] happened when their bodies were revived side by side on the road, but cannot explain the phenomenon. Jess is initially doubtful and hostile towards Roman, believing that he is disoriented from his head injuries, and she employs Casey's help in trying to get him to regain his memories.  However, he maintains that he is Ryan, continually offering romantic gestures and recounting specific memories private to them. Eventually, after a year passes, once he accurately recalls the story behind a certain photograph of the two of them, she believes that he is truly her husband and they resume their romantic life. Despite the disapproval of Jess' co-workers and a harsh reaction from Casey, who still believes that he is actually Roman, Jess and Ryan fall back into their former happy marriage, although Jess is still hesitant to turn off the machines keeping Ryan's body alive. They are both soon thrilled by the news that Jess is pregnant. Casey goes missing, but when the police question them, Ryan merely says that she was "troubled". Jess notices a discrepancy in a necklace that Ryan gave her before his accident, but brushes it aside until she discovers the original necklace hidden in a picture frame.  She then discovers that the box in which she kept all of Ryan's many love letters and photographs has been broken into, and she realizes that Roman has in fact lied to her, having previously studied the pictures and letters to learn the details of their marriage to impersonate his brother. When she confronts him, he quickly grows violent with her, saying that he did it because he loved her and knew they were meant to be together, saying that she must have sensed that it was him all along, and it is revealed that he murdered Casey because of her suspicions. As Roman and Jess fight, Ryan, in the hospital, experiences a [[seizure]]. Jess finally manages to stab Roman with a pottery knife, and he dies as the doctors work on Ryan. Later, at the hospital, Jess learns that her baby sustained no injuries from Roman's attack and that Ryan managed to pull through his episode, and she sits by his bedside, promising to wait for him and start their life over once he returns to her.  ===Alternate ending=== There is a 30-minute alternate ending on the DVD that fundamentally reconstructs the narrative. This ending is similar to the Korean original.  Jess and Roman/Ryan decide to turn off Ryan's machines, and he dies and is cremated. Rather than being murdered by Roman, Casey merely moves away. Jess realizes that Roman has lied to her by reading Ryan's love letters, but decides to feign ignorance and continue their life together, apparently appreciative of the fact that he so desperately wanted to change for her, echoing the theme of "change is choice" as stated in earlier scenes.

After her eldest brother's sudden death, their father wants to send his second son Johannes to the cathedral school in [[Dorestad]], but when the teacher Aesculapius ([[Edward Petherbridge]]) visits them in Ingelheim, Johanna proves to be far more capable of dealing with the Scriptures than Johannes.

Thurston|Lorrin Thurston]], the men demand that Ka'iulani's uncle, [[King Kalakaua]], sign a [[Bayonet Constitution|new constitution]] to restrict the power of the monarchy as well as to grant huge governmental powers to citizens of European ancestry. The situation soon devolves into a tense standoff between Thurston's men and the [[Royal Guards of Hawaii|Royal Guards]]. Amidst the chaos of the moment Ka'iulani is taken away for her own safety by her Scottish father, Archie Cleghorn, and sent to England for both protection and education.  Now in England, Ka'iulani struggles to fit in as her Polynesian heritage makes her a target of racism and offensive stereotypes from the Europeans whom she meets. She does make some friends, including the handsome young Clive Davies. They develop a relationship and the two become engaged. But one day her father returns from Hawaii after several years and, to her shock, informs her that her uncle, King Kalakaua, had died shortly after being forced to sign the new constitution by Thurston and [[Sanford B. Dole]]. He then informs her that a [[Wilcox Rebellion of 1895|failed native rebellion]] against the new constitution gave Thurston enough support to arrest and depose [[Queen Liliuokalani]], overthrowing the monarchy and declaring Hawai'i a republic. After discovering that the Davies family knew of her family's overthrow but hid the news from her Ka'iulani decides to call off her engagement and leave England. She travels to the United States where she gathers media attention and denounces the overthrow as well as the U.S.'s involvement. Her cultured, regal appearance overcomes the racist views against her, and many note that she is not the "Barbarian Princess" she was depicted as at all. Her campaign against the overthrow climaxes with her meeting U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]]. At a lunch with the President, Ka'iulani charms him and convinces him to actively oppose the overthrow, which he does so by refusing to annex Hawaii as an American territory. Unfortunately for Ka'ilulani, this act is done during the waning days of the Cleveland administration, and a few weeks later President [[William McKinley]] is inaugurated.  When Ka'iulani returns to Hawaii, she learns the new president has not only failed to oppose the overthrow but has also accepted Thurston's [[Newlands Resolution|annexation proposal]], annexing Hawaii as a territory of the United States of America. She attends a small private funeral for the [[Kingdom of Hawaiʻi]], hosted by her aunt, Queen Liliuokalani. Shortly after her return, she is visited by Sanford B. Dole, who explains that three U.S. legal commissioners are arriving, and that he and Thurston would like the Princess to host a small dinner for them. Though she is appalled at the impertinent request, he convinces her that it might be to her advantage too. At the dinner, Ka'iulani charms her visitors before surprising Thurston by publicly petitioning for an amendment to the annexation treaty to guarantee [[universal suffrage]] and voting rights to all Native Hawaiians. She is disregarded by an appalled Thurston, who points out she is not a recognized diplomat before Dole stands up for the princess and declares he will petition the amendment for her. As the amendment gathers support amongst the dinner guests, Thurston leaves, embarrassed and angry.   After the dinner, Ka'iulani is surprised to learn that her former fiancee Clive has come to Hawaii, as he had promised he would, and she goes to see him. He tells her that his father has passed and he is now in charge of his assets, including those in Hawaii. The two make up, and Clive asks Ka'iulani to return to England and marry him. She refuses, stating that her future is in Hawaii. When he equally refuses to move to Hawaii, the two share a last farewell kiss before Clive leaves for England. The film ends with Ka'iulani returning her treasured seashells, which she had kept throughout her travels to remind her of Hawaii, back to the ocean as she wades in the waves, with a voiceover saying that the bright flame of Ka'iulani is kept alive by the love of her people. A post-credits card shows that Ka'iulani died less than one year after annexation, some say of a broken heart for the loss of her kingdom. Another card mentions that in 1993 President Clinton signed the Apology Resolution, apologizing to Hawaii for the role the U.S. played in the overthrow.

If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada permanently and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish the book he's been recommending to her. Margaret agrees.  The couple travels to [[Sitka, Alaska]], Andrew's hometown, to meet his family. Margaret meets Andrew's mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and grandmother Annie (Betty White), known as "Gammy". During the trip to the family home, Margaret notices that nearly every shop in town carries the name Paxton and learns that Andrew's family is in fact very wealthy. During a welcome home party, Andrew confronts his father, Joe (Craig T. Nelson), who is angry about Andrew's dating the boss he has so long disliked and thinks he is using her to get ahead in his career. After their argument, Andrew announces the engagement to everyone. Margaret also meets Gertrude, Andrew's ex-girlfriend.  The next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a local bar as part of her bachelorette party to watch a strip dance by a locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer, Ramone. Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor and make his own life and that Andrew had proposed to Gertrude. However, Gertrude refused because she didn't want to leave Sitka for New York. Returning home, Margaret learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe. That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk. Instead, Margaret opens up to Andrew.  The next day, the family convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka.  After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him she has been alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had forgotten what it felt like to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada.  Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.  
A Prophet
 Malik El Djebena, a 19-year-old French youth of [[Algeria]]n descent, is sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers. Alone and illiterate upon his arrival, he falls under the sway of [[Corsican mafia|Corsican mobsters]], led by César Luciani, who enforces a brutal rule.  The prison is divided between two main factions: the Corsicans and the Muslims. Malik keeps to himself. When Luciani forces him to be the unwilling assassin of Reyeb, a Muslim witness in a trial, Malik gains the protection of the Corsicans in spite of his Arab origin. Malik serves as a low-level servant to the Corsicans, who treat him with disdain. All the while, he is haunted by visions of the murdered Reyeb. When the bulk of the Corsicans are transferred or released, Luciani is forced to give Malik more responsibility. Having secretly learned [[Corsican language|Corsican]], Malik acts as Luciani's eyes and ears in the prison. When Malik earns the privilege of day-long furloughs outside the prison, Luciani relies on him to conduct his criminal business outside.  Ryad, a Muslim friend, teaches Malik to read and write, and the two become close. Ryad teaches Malik about his own heritage, introducing him to two other Muslims, Tarik and Hassan, and increasing his power within the prison. Malik also becomes involved with a prison drug dealer, Jordi. When Ryad gains an early release due to testicular cancer, the three partners organize a drug-running enterprise to sell [[hashish]]. But when Ryad is kidnapped by the drug dealer Latif, Malik tracks down Latif's relative inside the prison. He kidnaps the relative's family and forces Latif's gang to release Ryad.  When Luciani discovers that Malik is using his day-releases for his own personal enterprise, he punishes him. Malik is sent to meet Brahim Lattrache in Marseille, another Muslim, who is involved in a deal between Luciani and the Lingherris, an [[Italian mafia]] group. Lattrache is bitter toward the Corsicans for the murder of Reyeb and holds Malik at gunpoint. When Malik spots a deer warning sign, he remembers a recent dream of deer running in the road. He tells his kidnappers that they are in danger of hitting wild animals, and they suddenly strike a deer. Lattrache is impressed by Malik, calling him a [[prophet]] and agreeing to do criminal business with him instead of Luciani, even though Malik admitted that he killed Reyeb.  Luciani believes there is a "mole" in his organization and decides to use Malik to assassinate Jacky Marcaggi, the [[Crime boss|Don]] of the [[Unione Corse|Corsican mafia]], for secretly dealing with the Lingherris. But Malik and Ryad have their own plan for Marcaggi: they kill his bodyguards and dump him in a van with his Corsican enemy Vettori, Luciani's henchman. Malik takes refuge at Ryad's house with his wife and young son. Ryad's cancer has returned; his decision against more chemotherapy leaves him just six months to live. He gets Malik to promise to take care of his family when he's gone.  Upon Malik's return to the prison, he is placed in solitary for returning late - putting him out of reach of Luciani's retribution while Marcaggi uses his influence to wipe out much of Luciani's faction. Once back in general population, Malik joins the Muslim faction in the yard. When a now powerless Luciani tries to approach him, two Muslims intercept and beat him.  On the day of his release, Malik is met by Ryad's wife and son outside the prison. They walk off together, followed by a vehicle convoy carrying Malik's new associates.  
Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva
 Not long after the events of Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, archaeologist and puzzle master Professor Hershel Layton and his young apprentice Luke Triton reminisce over one of their earliest adventures together from three years ago: Layton is invited by his former student Janice Quatlane to watch her perform in an opera at the Crown Petone opera house, which is built on the White Cliffs of Dover. The performance centers on the legendary lost land of Ambrosia and the secret of eternal life it holds, which will be rediscovered when its queen returns. Janice believes recent strange occurrences are somehow connected to the opera: girls have disappeared from London, and the opera's composer, Oswald Whistler, has recently adopted a young girl who has claimed to be his deceased daughter Melina. Whistler plays the entire opera on the Detragon, an elaborate one-man orchestra machine. Once the performance is complete, a mystery man informs the audience that they are to play a game, the winner of which will receive the secret of eternal life, while the losers will die. Several members of the audience try to escape, but the floor opens up beneath them and they disappear. Inspector Grosky tries to arrest the mystery man, but the man is a puppet which inflates and floats out of the theater, taking Grosky with him.  The Crown Petone is revealed to be a ship, which breaks off from the cliffs and sets sail. The mystery man unveils a series of timed puzzles intended to progressively eliminate the players until one winner remains. Layton's prolific puzzle-solving prowess allows him, Luke, Janice, and a group of nine others to quickly deduce the answers. The remaining contestants leave the ship in lifeboats, which take the players to their next destination as the ship explodes behind them.  The next morning, the group finds themselves on an island. After discovering a sculpted stone seal, amateur historian Marco Brock reasons they must be at Ambrosia. Evading a pack of wolves as they make their way towards the castle at the centre of the island, Layton, Luke and Janice become separated from the rest of the group and assemble a makeshift helicopter that allows them to fly to the castle quickly. There, they solve the fourth and final puzzle that directs them to the final room of the contest, but Layton leaves Luke, Janice and two other contestants (Brock and child prodigy Amelia Ruth) to enter it while he explores the rest of the castle.  Back in London, Emmy Altava, Professor Layton’s assistant, is meeting with Dr. Andrew Schrader when she hears about the events on the Crown Petone. She flies out to the remains of the ship, where she picks up Inspector Grosky and flies to the island.  Layton finds a room filled with Melina Whistler’s belongings, along with a piece of sheet music titled “A Song of the Sea”. He meets Melina herself and witnesses her having an argument with herself. Luke, Janice, Brock and Amelia enter the final room of the contest, only to be trapped behind bars. The mystery man reveals himself as Jean Descole, Layton and Luke’s old nemesis, who orders Amelia to be brought to him. Luke, Janice and Brock are taken by Descole’s men, but they are saved by Emmy and Grosky. Layton and Melina meet up with them, and Emmy recognizes “Melina” as Nina, one of the girls who went missing.  Amelia is brought to Oswald Whistler, believed to have been eliminated by a previous puzzle, and declares her the winner of the contest, but soon forces her into a machine connected to the Detragon and confesses that there is no Elixir of Life. Layton and company manage to save her, and Layton explains the truth: the Detragon is actually a machine that can copy a person’s personality and download their memories into another person’s brain. Whistler had conspired with Descole to abduct girls from London and use the Detragon to implant them with his dead daughter's memories as a means of keeping her alive indefinitely. This is the fate that befell Nina, and it is the fate that Whistler had planned for Amelia. Layton reveals that Janice also was a victim of Whistler's experiments, and that, unbeknownst to Whistler, he had actually succeeded in transferring Melina's memories into Janice's body. It was Melina who sought Layton's help in stopping her father from hurting anyone else.   With Melina’s cover blown, Descole captures her and reveals his true plan: to use the Detragon in concert with Melina's singing to raise Ambrosia by playing a pair of melodies found in the island's stone seal - the Song of the Stars and the Song of the Sea. After Descole's attempts fail, he flies into a rage: the Detragon destroys the castle and becomes the controls of a gigantic excavation robot, the Detragiganto, which Descole commands and begins rampaging across the island in a desperate attempt to uncover Ambrosia by force. Layton and company escape the castle, and Layton and Luke fly in their makeshift helicopter to save Melina.  During the chaos, Melina tries to stop Descole, but he knocks her over the side of the robot, where she holds on for her life. Luke rescues Melina while Layton duels with Descole on top of the Detragiganto, and reveals that Descole had overlooked a third melody hidden in the seal, the Song of the Sun. Again, Melina sings as Layton takes the Detragon's controls, and this time, the ruins of Ambrosia do indeed rise, infuriating Descole even further. He lunges at Layton, believing that the ruins belong only to him, but merely damages the control panel instead, throwing the Detragiganto out of control and causing it to heavily damage itself. Descole falls off the machine and disappears while Layton, Luke and Melina escape.  In the aftermath of the rise of Ambrosia, Melina decides she cannot take over Janice's life, and, after bidding farewell to her father, Luke and Layton, her spirit leaves Janice's body. Whistler plays one last song on the remains of the Detragon, and Janice, now in control of her body again, sings for Melina's memory. As the sun rises over the island, Luke wonders if Melina could have been a reincarnation of the queen of Ambrosia, and Layton reminds him of the legend: that Ambrosia would rise again when its beloved queen returned.  
Protector (2009 film)
 It is 1938 and the Nazis are just one step away from invading and occupying Czechoslovakia. Hana is a young Czech film actress who also happens to be Jewish. She has just appeared in her first feature with her leading man, an older Jewish actor, who warns her that her career is over and that their picture will never see the light of day since the Nazis will never allow its release. He hands her a forged passport and papers to get out of the country but she throws them in the trash, not believing what he says about the imminent German invasion.  As the filming of the 'film within a film' is on the verge of completion, we see the two actors riding stationery bicycles with a moving image in the background. As was the usual practice in creating films in earlier days, the illusion of motion is created when the moving image flickers in the background but the object in the foreground is static. This bicyclist becomes a symbol for the man who pedals furiously but is actually going nowhere. That man is the Czech everyman of 1938 who desperately wishes to escape his tragic circumstances but in reality remains motionless, trapped by the forces of tyranny. Throughout the film, we catch glimpses of the film's protagonist, Emil, pedaling furiously, superimposed over the screen's larger canvas.  Hana is married to Emil, a journalist, who is conscripted by collaborating Czech officials at the radio station where he works to serve as a radio announcer after a colleague, Franta, who will not keep his opinions about the Germans to himself, is taken away by occupying forces and later executed. Emil, no hard core collaborator, cooperates to protect his wife from being deported to the death camps. Emil's boss at the radio station is a Nazi sympathizer who offers him the job with the understanding that no one will bother him about his wife.  Soon, Emil has become popular hosting a cultural program in Prague entitled "Voices of Our Home". Meanwhile Hana becomes bored sitting at home and jeopardizes Emil's position by leaving their apartment, usually to attend the cinema. As Hana is rebellious and narcissistic, refusing to accept how risky her position is as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. She is almost arrested leaving the cinema after curfew, rescued by former medical student, now [[morphine]]-addicted projectionist, Petr.  As tensions arise, Emil begins having an affair with former colleague and former lover of Franta, Vera. Vera is now engaged to his boss, after dumping Franta for not being able to "listen." After figuring out Emil is having an affair, Hana beings seeing Petr more and more, as they both begin to take up the dangerous hobby of Petr taking pictures Hana in front of Anti-Jewish shop signs. He wants to go to bed with her but she resists his advances, eventually allowing him, however, to take pictures of her in the nude. At this point in the film, things slow down considerably as Hana is no longer talking to Emil with the conflict between the two principals, grinding to a halt.  Hana's former film co-star shows up at their apartment having just escaped from a death transport (he never made it out of Czechoslovakia). Emil is horrified that Hana allows him to take a bath in the apartment and throws him out on the street. Enraged at Emil for throwing her ex-colleague out, Hana dons her blond wig and adopts the persona of her character from her movie and crashes Emil's boss's wedding. Emil is on the verge of being fired for his 'transgression' when [[Reinhard Heydrich|Reich Protector Heydrich]] is assassinated by Czech partisans. Nazi soldiers do a house-to-house search and discover Hana is in the apartment. When they realize who Emil is, they take no action against Hana, despite the fact that the soldiers know she is Jewish. Later the Nazis broadcast a description of a bicycle used by one of the partisans who has killed Heydrich. Emil has another affair with a gossip columnist and takes her family's bicycle back to his apartment and attempts to hide it; this leads Hana to believe that Emil has switched sides and is now helping the partisans.  Now Emil's boss orders him to prove his loyalty by reading a loyalty oath over the airwaves after the Heydrich assassination places all Czech citizens in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Hana has come down to earth after she escapes arrest during the house-to-house search. However, when Emil's second lover comes to Hana for help after she saw Emil get taken away, Hana realizes where the bike is truly from and believes that Emil was never on her side after all. She packs her belongings to go find Petr, ultimately ripping off her wedding ring. Unfortunately, she finds Petr completely under the influence of morphine and watching her first feature film. The Nazis hear the loud music and arrest him, with Hana barely getting away. After she has realized that there is nothing left to live for, she turns herself into the authorities. Emil decides not to show up at the broadcast to read the loyalty oath to go looking for Hana, riding the bike that is believed to belong to the man who assassinated the Reich Protector.  Emil finds her in a crowd of Jews being marched to the death transports. He stands impassively with the bike blocking the group's path. Nazi soldiers club him in the head and drag him to the side of the road. He runs to meet Hana in the crowd and they gaze at each other. Emil is then attacked for a second time as Hana is marched away.  
Psychotropica
 The film opens with an elderly man (Damien Sage as "The Patient") leaving a rushed and emotional, voice message to his partner of 30 years. The Patient implies that an insidious person from his distant past (a past he never spoke of to his lover) has shown up and this person is very dangerous. The Patient has decided to run out on the good life he has had for so long, to leave his lover and everything they have behind to keep his partner out of harms way. When The Patient finishes his message and prepares to leave he suffers from delirum, and he sees an orange fishtank with devil horns and eats it. In this moment The Patient drifts off into his subconscious mind, into his past. As this happens the "elderly" Patient's apartment fades away into a bright white light that reveals a large ominous building perched on a jagged cliff side, overlooking the sea...  Two voices appear over the scene, one is of The Patient (age 25 at this point) and the other is a sadistic man known only as "The Doctor" (played by Maximillian Magick). The Doctor states that he has been administering an experimental drug called "Psychotropica" to The Patient and mercilessly interrogating him about a traumatic and off kilter "nightmare" for quite sometime now (in an effort to "study" his reactions.) The Patient is obviously in great emotional and psychological stress and does not wish to continue the "treatment" but The Doctor forces him to continue for "as long as it takes" under threat of severe "punishment." Reluctantly The Patient agrees to continue relating his painful nightmare for The Doctor. The Patient takes a deep breath and begins his psychological "trip"...  As The Patient begins, the scene fades into an odd neon landscape, that features a never ending "highway of the mind", glowing green plasma mountains and billowing technicolor clouds that flow relentlessly in the sky. The Patient can now be seen standing off in the distance of this dreamscape. We move slowly past him and into the sky. We travel through the vast reaches of space and time at great speed until we are thrust into the first major segment of The Patient's "nightmare"...  From here on out the film plays like a dream would, jumping wildly in tone and style, from the past to the present, each segment related in some meaningful way to the ones before and after. The dream logic of the film is only interrupted by brief interludes of The Patient setting up and describing each part of his "nightmare." Most of this nightmare revolves around The Patient's tumultuous relationship with his sadistic Stepbrother and Sister (played, as adults by Braden West and Tiffany Titmouse) and his efforts to break away from them and their violent life together. Along the way there are visually stylish dreams with dreams, a pulse-pounding psychedelic sex scene between the step brother and sister, an extended [[Evil Dead]] homage that segues into an epic animated sequence that pits The Patient's conflicting "light and dark" sides against one another. There are also moments of unmitigated violence, black comedy, brutal fights and visually stunning weirdness; all building up to an emotionally and psychologically explosive final act where all the secrets of the "nightmare", The Doctor and The Patient are revealed.<ref></ref>  
Push (2009 film)
 In 1945, the United States government sets up The Division, an agency that tracks and experiments on people who possess [[Parapsychology|psychic abilities]]. Each psychic is categorized into a group based on what powers they have. Two [[Psychokinesis|Movers]], teenager Nick Gant and his father Jonah, are hiding from Agent Carver of Division.  Jonah tells Nick about a vision he received from a [[Precognition|Watcher]] about a young girl Nick must help in the future to bring down Division. Nick watches Carver murder Jonah before he escapes.  Years later, Division has developed a drug which can boost psychic abilities. All of the test subjects died until a Pusher named Kira successfully adapted to it. Kira escapes from Division and steals a syringe of the drug before fleeing to Hong Kong. Nick now lives in Hong Kong as an [[expatriate]], but is in trouble due to gambling debts he incurred while attempting to use his power as a Mover to cheat the games.  Nick is visited by Cassie Holmes, a moody teenage Watcher.  Her mother, Sarah, is considered the strongest Watcher ever born and directly aided in Kira's escape. Nick realizes Cassie is the girl his father saw in his vision and decides to help her find Kira and the briefcase containing the stolen drug. They are attacked by the [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese triads]] at a market and Nick is wounded by a Bleeder before he and Cassie get away. Nick Meets a Stitch named Teresa Stowe who heals him from his wounds.  Nick and Cassie use her Watcher abilities to track down Kira, who is actually Nick's ex-girlfriend. Kira hid the case and then had a [[Memory erasure|Wiper]] erase her memory of its location. Nick recruits a Shadow named Pinky Stein to hide Kira from Division. Cassie attempts to foresee the case's location, competing with the Triads Watcher Pop Girl.  As Kira begins to get sick from withdrawal, Nick feels he must meet with Carver to save her life.  Nick learns that Kira will get sicker and eventually die without more of the drug, which only Carver has.  Victor, a talented Mover and Carver's assistant, battles Nick and nearly kills him before Cassie convinces Carver to spare him.  Cassie then finds a key in Kira's shoe which unlocks a locker atop a construction site where the case is hidden.  Knowing that their every move can be seen by both Division and Triad Watchers, Nick proposes an elaborate plan to obtain the drug and eliminate their enemies. He creates several envelopes containing instructions for each of his friends, including Shifter Hook Waters and Sniff Emily Wu.  Nick seals each envelope and gives them to his friends before hiring the Wiper who erased Kira's memory to do the same to him.  With his memory wiped the Watchers are unable to see his future, enabling the group to execute Nick's plan.  Hook locates the case and creates a duplicate of it and the syringe, while Pinky delivers Kira to Carver as part of the plan. Carver then pushes her into believing she is actually a Division agent and her relationship with Nick was a lie.  Cassie is confronted by Pop Girl, only for the Wiper to appear and erase Pop Girl's memory per instructions from Nick. Nick visits Carver and discovers Kira's brainwashing. They travel to the construction site where Carver unknowingly retrieves the fake case, but the Triads arrive and attempt to steal the case.  A battle erupts between all three groups which leads to the Triad Bleeders being killed.  Nick uses his newly discovered Mover power to battle Victor, killing him.  Nick seizes the fake syringe and injects himself with it, apparently dying. After Kira and Carver leave, Cassie appears and reveals Nick is alive. They retrieve the real case and syringe from a dumpster and discuss using it to free Cassie's mother from Division.  In the final scene, Kira discovers her unopened envelope, which contains photographs proving her relationship with Nick was real. She then pushes Carver, and as the screen goes black a gunshot is heard.  
Putaani Party
 [[File:Mcrowd.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Children in action]] A [[Gram Panchayat]] (village governing body) in rural [[India]] facilitates the functioning of the Makkala Samiti (Children’s Committee) – a children’s body elected by the children themselves.  The committee acts as a pressure group in trying to get the [[local governance]] react to various social issues that it raises. Guided by a sympathetic school teacher, the children’s honesty and persistency ruffles many feathers among the adults, some of whom have been using the ‘Makkala Samiti’ for their own needs.  What follows is a subtle cat and mouse game, by the end of which the children hope to get their voice heard.  The film subtly speaks about the [[Children's rights]] to [[self governance]] and the pathetic attitude we adults have towards this issue.  
Puthiya Mukham
 Krishnakumar ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran]]) is a resident of an [[agraharam]] in Kalpathy. Along with his studies, he pursues a career as a percussionist and teaches the [[mridangam]] to local students. He is in love with a girl who is the daughter of a family friend. Their relationship is not only approved, but supported by both families.  Kichu moves on to the city of [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] ([[Ernakulam]]) to enroll at an engineering college. The villain Sudhi ([[Bala (actor)|Bala]]) is a senior student and the youngest of three brothers (the others being Mahi ([[Saikumar (actor, born 1963)|Sai Kumar]]) and Giri ([[Shammi Thilakan]])); he pursues a real estate business and routine crimes associated with it. In all his villainous endeavors on the campus, he is supported by his brothers.  The main support for the villain family from 'the system' is a police officer named Shivaraman ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]). The story takes its form when Anjana ([[Priyamani]]), Shivaraman's daughter, joins the engineering college. Sudhi is in love with her and to win her love plays the gentleman, concealing and temporarily stopping all his villainous activities.  Kichu, as is expected, wins the heart of the girls in the college from almost day one. Sudhi suspects that Anjana is attracted to Kichu, so he moves fast and sends his brother with an official proposal to Anjana's family. Her parents accept the proposal and force the reluctant daughter to agree to it. But she stipulates a condition: there will be no marriage immediately. Sudhi has to wait for four years (until the course ends) for the marriage; she will have her freedom for these four years. The 'freedom' of Anjana and the way she exercises it make jealous and suspicious. He wants to scare Kichu out of the college. He arranges an attack on him at the college hostel. Kichu is severely wounded. At the end of the attack, when apparently he receives a blow on his head, Kichu appears to turn mad and attacks his own friend who tried to rescue him.  He is admitted to a hospital and it is revealed that he has what the doctor in the movie says a 'Flashback Phenomenon'. He had to witness the death of his younger brother, while young, hit by a bus, and traumatic incidents like this will turn him violent. His prearranged marriage has been disapproved by his would-be's family following this. His own family doesn't want him to go to the college anymore. But his father ([[Nedumudi Venu]]) supports him, urges him to go back to the college, and asks him to win his life.  What happens after this is an unbelievable change in Kichu's character. A hitherto simpleton now turns a superhero. The villain welcomes him back at the college with an attack. Kichu, the now fearless super hero, gives a difficult-to-believe show of stunts. Sudhi's brothers turn in for help. Kichu sends the eldest brother Mahi to hospital, mortally wounded. He is put in the ICU for observation and is reportedly in a coma. The villain's ally, Shivaraman, arrests Kichu and takes him to the police station. Here, Kichu learns that he is going to be transported to the sub jail where his murder is planned. Kichu turns violent and storms the police station. He is hit by a policeman from behind and apparently falls unconscious, but it is only an act. He is rushed to the hospital, where he makes his escape.  The villains kidnap Anjana. In the final stunt at a construction site of a multi-storied building, Kichu beats numerous stuntmen and tells Sudhi the truth about Kichu and how he wants to see Sudhi become a good person towards Kichu. But Sudhi, who is still angry, denies and tells Kichu that he doesn't want a life. So Kichu lets go of his hand and Sudhi dies. Kichu walks away with Anjana as the credits start to roll.  
Pumzi
  ''Pumzi'' begins with a tele-type caption that places the film spatially in the Maitu community of the East African Territory and temporally thirty-five years after World War III—The Water War. In Kikuyu, the word "Maitu" stems from the roots 'truth' and "our," and in everyday usage, 'our truth' signifies 'mother.' A placard marks a seedpod of the Mother Tree, contained in a glass jar. The Maitu community contains open spaces, windows with cast cityscapes, and hallways that are well maintained and lit.  Although only a small portion of the Maitu community is ever shown, as Asha walks through the hallway, she stops to admire the scenery. Portions of the community are visible through the window, which gives the sense that the community is large, though not how large or how extensive it is. Because of the harsh conditions, the lack of resources, and concerns about radiation, all citizens are confined within the walls of the community.  The Maitu community is powered by manual energy production machines—treadmills and rowing machines—which produce no pollution.  Each citizen is allotted a small amount of daily water, and they are meticulous in their conservation of water. For example, in the bathroom, urine and sweat are recycled and kept in a personal water bottle.  The curator of the Virtual Natural Museum, Asha, receives an anonymous package that contains a small soil sample. She tests the soil and finds no radiation and a high level of moisture. Although she tests the sample with technological instruments, she also uses her own senses. When she takes a deep breath and inhales the smell of the soil, she is plunged into a vision, into a deep pool of water. Based on both the mechanical, scientific tests, and her own, biological, visions, Asha believes that life may have returned to the environment outside the community.  Asha meets virtually with the Maitu Council—a body of three women. Because they live in a contained society, citizens are not free to leave. Anyone who wants to leave must ask for a permission from the Council. She informs the Council members, but they deny that life is possible outside. To prove them wrong, Asha places her hand on a scanner, which projects her dream of the green tree and the pool of water on the screen. They dismiss the visions as 'dream' and deny the visa, immediately sending in a security team to destroy all evidence. The authorities haul Asha from the lab and compel her to produce energy on one of the machines—the dark side of Maitu's energy self-sufficiency.  With the help of a bathroom attendant, Asha breaks out of the underground compound and emerges into the sunlight. Even though she has never seen the outside world, as if channelling an ancestral memory, Asha stops and makes coverings for her feet out of refuse and a head scarf to block the sun, and wind. Tellingly, we see bags of garbage ejected from the city into the landfill, which suggests that the Maitu community may not have learned its lesson, after all. Asha struggles through the harsh elements toward the compass coordinates of the soil sample. She sees the tree of her dream, though it is only a mirage. Finding nothing alive, Asha digs a hole in the sand and plants the Mother Tree. As she pours the last of her water and wrings out the last of her own sweat onto the small plant, she lies down to protect and nurture the bud.  In a reverse of the opening scene, the camera pulls up. As the shot widens, we see tree growing rapidly, apparently right out of Asha's body.<ref></ref>  
Pure (2009 film)
 Twenty-year-old Katarina ([[Alicia Vikander]]) never finished school; she lives in [[Gothenburg]] with her alcoholic mother.

Raaz: The Mystery Continues
 The story starts with an American visiting the Kalindi Temple at night. There he sees the priest of the temple in a horrific state – he had slit his body with a [[scythe]] and had written '[[Om]]' on his body. The man, horrified by what he is seeing, flees from there. The story then shifts to a model in her early 20s, Nandita ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) who is in love with Yash, ([[Adhyayan Suman]]) a director and host of the reality show "Andhvishwas" a show dealing with various superstitions of Tanuja Twins ghosts mirror and tantric voodoos. Yash gifts Nandita an apartment where they start living and they love each other, in the meantime Nandita gets pregnant.  One evening, Nandita encounters Prithvi ([[Emraan Hashmi]]), an aspiring artist who is in search of his masterpiece. Prithvi tells Nandita that he made a sketch 4 months ago of a girl, who is actually Nandita. He also shows her a painting where she is lying with her wrist slit. He warns her of any type of danger. Regardless, Nandita accidentally slits her wrist due to an unknown ghostly attack on her in the bathroom. Prithvi saves her and admits her to a hospital. Yash arrives to the hospital and comes to know about her pregnancy and also her miscarriage due to excessive bleeding. She complains to Yash about Prithvi, and Yash gets him arrested, though he is released later on.  Meanwhile, at Kalindi, the same American, David Cooper (J. Brandon Hill), who is the Kalindi chemical plant owner, commits suicide by hanging himself after writing on the wall of his room, "Tum ashudh ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho" (You are impure, you are rotten from inside), with his blood. The inspector investigating the suicide is severely affected by it. Back at his home, Prithvi makes another picture of Nandita getting mobbed. He runs to a fashion show where Nandita is performing, and witnesses her being possessed and attacking a spiritual guru attending the show. She then says the same lines, "Tum ashudh Ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho", to the guru. Prithvi rushes to her rescue, but is prevented by the guards. Nandita is taken away from the guru and audience. The guru later appears on TV, claiming she had been possessed. Coming to know about everything, Yash has her publicly apologise to everyone, and declares that she has mental problems.  After the guards release Prithvi, Nandita is possessed again in her bathroom, with same lines appearing in the mirror. She goes to Prithvi for help, but he refuses her, showing her a new painting in which she is hanging herself and the same lines seem to appear behind her. He also shows her some news clippings about the death of the priest and David Cooper, with the same lines written behind them. Nandita thanks him and leaves to attend a party with Yash. There she is possessed and attacked again, and starts bleeding. Meanwhile, Prithvi prepares himself to help Nandita by burning the ominous painting of Nandita, which symbolises that he will protect her. He spots Nandita running from the party, apparently bleeding, and follows her. He finally catches up to her in a slum, where he sees her writing the same lines as before with her blood. He tries to stop her, but realises that she is possessed. She then tries to commit suicide but he prevents her from doing so. Yash arrives to find Nandita in Prithvi's arms.  Yash agrees to help Nandita on the condition she leaves Prithvi, but she refuses his help and decides to stay with Prithvi and visit Kalindi to find out the truth. Prithvi and Nandita spend the night in a guest house, where Nandita is possessed once again. The spirit leads her to a forest where she is repeatedly attacked by paranormal beings. She receives visions of people hanging from trees. She then spots a well and somebody standing near it, and goes towards them. Just as she is about to jump, Prithvi catches her. It is revealed that the 'well' was actually the steep edge of a cliff. They arrive at Kalindi and meet the priest's wife (who is living life as a prostitute) who tells them that it was her husband who was evil and his death was not surprising, considering the crimes he had committed against innocent people in the name of religion. They decide to go to the police inspectors' house (the same one who investigated David Coopers' suicide), where they find him completely crazy and are unable to prevent him from committing suicide.  Nandita and Prithvi soon continue their journey by jeep. One night while travelling, they are attacked by animals. Nandita escapes the jeep and heads towards the trees, where she finds the same well. This time, before Prithvi can save her, she jumps into it. Prithvi follows her. Inside the well, Nandita comes to know that it was Prithvi's father, Veer Pratap Singh (Jackie Shroff), who was possessing her. It so happened that he discovered that the Kalindi chemical plant dumps its toxins into a lake where thousands gathered once a year to bathe in a sacred ritual. He lodges a complaint against David Cooper but is warned by the policeman and the priest against taking any action, or his life will be in peril. He merely replies, "Tum ashudh Ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho". Veer Pratap tries to tell the truth to everyone, but is killed by the goons of the priest and his body is dumped in the same well. His spirit returns for his revenge. He kills David Cooper, and the policeman and priest who sided with David. Prithvi finally learns the truth, but is still confused as to why Nandita was used for this. They come to know that it was Yash who had all the proof of Veer Singh's death, but he had sold those proofs to David in return for sponsorship of his show. Nandita tries to escape with the proof but is just about shot by Yash, when Prithvi saves her. Unfortunately for both, Prithvi is stabbed by Yash. In the end however, the spirit of Veer attacks and kills Yash. Before moving on, Veer heals Prithvi's wounds after which Nandita and Prithvi are reunited.

REC 2
 Dr. Owen ([[Jonathan D. Mellor|Jonathan Mellor]]), an official from the [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Ministry of Health]], and a heavily armed [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO]] team equipped with video cameras are sent into a quarantined apartment building to control the situation. After Martos, a GEO operator, is killed and infected while encountering some of the infected, Owen uses religious mantra and [[rosary]] to hold him off in a room. It turns out that Owen is actually a priest sent by the Vatican to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], the same attacker from the end of the previous film.  At the penthouse, Tristana is nowhere to be found. Larra, one of the GEO operators, finds a sample of her (Tristana's) blood – the only one that the original priest took from her. Owen performs a religious rite, and the blood combusts, confirming that it is the blood he is looking for; however, Fernandez, commanding officer of the GEO team drops it, rendering it useless. Owen tells them that they must get a blood sample from Tristana herself.  Jennifer's father, who was outside getting medicine for his daughter (the infected Jennifer from the first installment), manages to convince a firefighter to take him into the building. Three teenagers, Tito, Mire and Ori gain access to the building through the sewage system; however, police seal their exit. After the deaths of Larra, Jennifer's father, and the firefighter from attacks by the possessed, the two groups find each other. However, Tito has been bitten, and they restrain him and lock Mire and Ori in a room where their fates are left unknown. The group then finds Ángela Vidal ([[Manuela Velasco]]), the reporter from ''[[REC (film) | REC]]'', who still has her camera with her. Owen forces Tito to tell him where Tristana Medeiros is. The demon possessing Tito tells him that she is "in the highest." Owen figures out that this means that she is in the penthouse. The demon then gives a hint that the "light" blinds them from seeing the path. When Ángela is asked how she saw Tristana, she says she saw her through the camera's night vision. Owen deduces that some things can only be seen in the dark.  They go back to the penthouse. When they turn on the camera's night vision, a door appears that leads them to a room. They find a tub filled with water that cannot be seen when the lights are on. While the GEO chief, Fernandez investigates it, Tristana leaps out and drags him in and then disappears as the light is turned on. When Tristana attacks them again, Ángela blows her head off with a shotgun, finally killing her. Owen is enraged because he needed the blood sample, but all Ángela wants to do is leave the building. At this point, the only survivors are Ángela, Owen, and Rosso, the GEO cameraman. When Owen refuses to authorize their exit, Ángela starts to beat him. Rosso tells her to stop, but she shoots and kills him. It is revealed that the demon possessing Tristana has now possessed Ángela so she can leave the building. After telling Owen that she does not need him to get out, as she can impersonate his voice, she kills him. She takes his radio and says that the mission is over and they can let them out. She also tells them that he is staying behind because he is infected and the only survivor is a woman, Ángela. When asked how the woman survived, the demonic Ángela looks at the camera and smiles.  The ending of the first film is shown, but extended to reveal how the demon possessed Ángela (by forcing her mouth open and transferring some type of large parasite into her mouth), and then as Ángela, went into hiding as Owen and the GEO team broke into the penthouse earlier in the film.

The five leaders, Jimmy (Calvin Poon), Coffee ([[Paul Wong (musician)|Paul Wong]]), Jupiter (Convoy Chan), Sand ([[Jun Kung]]) and Man Ching (Anson Leung) share the same power over the area. Seemingly, everything remains calm, each gang owning its territory and conflicts rarely rising in-between. However, as Jimmy's wife Cheung Wah ([[Ada Choi]]) is so talented in managing their business which has been expanding in recent years, gradually they are the most affluent among all. Adversely, Man Ching is facing down turn of his empire, business shrinking in scale and its power narrowing down.

One night, when Jimmy is dining with seniors, a young man armed himself with a gun fires several big shots to his head. Knowing that, Cheung Wah stops all business dealing at once and appoints Po ([[Shawn Yue]]), Jimmy's right hand, to dig out the backhand but keep things quiet.

Red Cliff (film)
 Director [[John Woo]] said in an interview with David Stratton that the film is only 50% factual. Woo decided to alter the story using modern feelings and his own feelings for a more worldly acceptance. According to Woo, historical accuracy was less important than how the audience felt about the battle.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090723083614/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2616304.htm]</ref>  ===Part I === In the summer of 208, towards the [[End of the Han Dynasty|end of the Eastern Han dynasty]], the [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]], [[Cao Cao]], leads the imperial army on a campaign to eliminate the southern warlords [[Sun Quan]] and [[Liu Bei]], whom he denounces as "rebels". [[Emperor Xian of Han|Emperor Xian]] reluctantly approves the campaign. Cao Cao's mighty army swiftly conquers [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]. The [[Battle of Changban]] is ignited when Cao Cao's cavalry starts attacking civilians on an exodus led by Liu Bei. During the battle, Liu Bei's followers, including his [[sworn brother]]s [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei]], give an excellent display of their combat skills by holding off the enemy while buying time for the civilians to retreat. The warrior [[Zhao Yun]] fights bravely to rescue Liu Bei's entrapped family but only succeeds in rescuing Liu's infant son.  Following the battle, Liu Bei's advisor, [[Zhuge Liang]], goes on a diplomatic mission to [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] to form an alliance between his lord and Sun Quan against Cao Cao. Sun Quan was initially in the midst of a dilemma of whether to surrender or fight back, but his decision to resist Cao Cao hardens after Zhuge Liang's clever persuasion and a subsequent tiger hunt with his viceroy [[Zhou Yu]] and his sister [[Lady Sun|Sun Shangxiang]]. Meanwhile, [[Cai Mao]] and [[Zhang Yun (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Yun]], two naval commanders from Jing Province, pledge allegiance to Cao Cao, who puts them in command of his navy.  After the hasty formation of the Sun–Liu alliance, the forces of Liu Bei and Sun Quan call for a meeting to formulate a plan to counter Cao Cao's army, which is rapidly advancing towards their base at Red Cliff from both land and water. The battle begins with Sun Shangxiang leading some riders to lure Cao Cao's vanguard force into the allies' [[Eight Trigrams Formation|Bagua Formation]]. The vanguard force is defeated by the allies but Cao Cao shows no disappointment and proceeds to lead his main army to the riverbank directly opposite Red Cliff, where they make camp. While the allies throw a banquet to celebrate their victory, Zhuge Liang conceives a plan to send Sun Shangxiang on an espionage mission to Cao Cao's camp. They maintain contact by sending messages via a pigeon. The film ends with Zhou Yu lighting his miniaturised battleships on a map based on the battle formation.  ===Part II === Sun Shangxiang has infiltrated Cao Cao's camp and is secretly noting its details and sending them via a pigeon to Zhuge Liang. Meanwhile, Cao Cao's army is seized with a plague of [[typhoid fever]] that kills a number of his troops. Cao Cao orders the corpses to be sent on floating rafts to the allies' camp, in the hope of spreading the plague to his enemies. The allied army's morale is affected when some unsuspecting soldiers let the plague in. Eventually, a disheartened Liu Bei leaves with his forces while Zhuge Liang stays behind to assist Sun Quan. Cao Cao is overjoyed when he hears that the alliance has collapsed. At the same time, Cai Mao and Zhang Yun propose a new tactic of interlocking the battleships with iron beams to minimise rocking when sailing on the river and reduce the chances of the troops falling seasick.  [[Image:Red Cliff.jpg|right|thumb|Sun Quan's forces look on as [[Liu Bei]] leaves the alliance. ''From right to left'': [[Zhou Yu]] ([[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]]), [[Sun Quan]] ([[Chang Chen]]), [[Lu Su]] ([[Hou Yong (actor)|Hou Yong]]).]]  Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang make plans to eliminate Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, and produce 100,000 arrows respectively. They agreed that whoever fails to complete his mission shall be executed under military law. Zhuge Liang's ingenious strategy of letting the enemy shoot 20 boats covered in straw brings in over 100,000 arrows from the enemy and makes Cao Cao doubt the loyalty of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun. On the other hand, Cao Cao sends [[Jiang Gan]] to persuade Zhou Yu to surrender, but Zhou tricks Jiang Gan into believing that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are planning to assassinate Cao Cao . Both Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu's respective plans complement each other when Cao Cao is convinced, despite having earlier doubts about Jiang Gan's report, that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun were indeed planning to assassinate him by deliberately "donating" arrows to the enemy. Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are executed while Cao Cao realises his folly afterwards but it is too late.  Sun Shangxiang returns to base from Cao Cao's camp with a map of the enemy formation. Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang decide to attack Cao Cao's navy with fire after predicting that a special climatic condition will soon cause the winds to blow from the southeast – a direction to their advantage. Before the battle, Sun Quan's forces feast on [[Tangyuan (food)|rice dumplings]] to celebrate the [[Dongzhi Festival|Winter Solstice]]. Meanwhile, Zhou Yu's wife, [[Two Qiaos|Xiaoqiao]], heads towards Cao Cao's camp alone secretly in the hope of persuading Cao to give up his ambitious plans. She fails to convince Cao Cao and decides to distract him with an elaborate [[Chinese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] to buy time for her side.  The battle begins when the southeast wind starts blowing in the middle of the night. Sun Quan's forces launch their attack on Cao Cao's navy by ramming smaller boats that are set aflame into Cao's larger battleships. On the other hand, Liu Bei's forces, whose departure from the alliance was a ruse, start attacking Cao Cao's forts on land. By dawn, Cao Cao's entire navy has been destroyed. The allies launch another offensive on Cao Cao's ground army in his forts, and succeed in breaking through using [[testudo formation]] despite suffering heavy casualties. Although Cao Cao is besieged in his main camp, he manages to hold Zhou Yu at sword point after ambushing him with the help of [[Cao Hong]]. Xiahou Jun also shows up with Xiaoqiao as a hostage and threatens to kill her if the allies do not surrender. Just then, Zhao Yun manages to reverse the situation by rescuing Xiaoqiao with a surprise attack, while Sun Quan fires an arrow that grazes the top of Cao Cao's head and causes his hair to be let loose. Cao Cao is now at the mercy of the allies, but they spare his life and leave. In the final scene, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang have a final conversation before Zhuge walks away into the far distance with the newborn foal Mengmeng.  ===Abridged version=== For the non-Asian releases, the film was shortened from 288 minutes to 148 minutes and was released in some countries under the title ''Battle of Red Cliff''. An opening narration in American English provides the historical background, whereas in the Asian release, a more brief description of the context of the political situation appears in scrolling form ten minutes into the film. Notable cuts include the background and motivations behind Zhuge Liang's plan to obtain 100,000 arrows, including the threat to his life, and the early parts of Sun Shangxiang's infiltration, where she befriended a northern soldier Sun Shucai (though the scene where she mourns killed Sun was not cut). The tiger hunting scene was also cut from the non-Asian releases.  The original two-part 288 minute version was released as a two-disc set on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 5 October 2009,<ref name="dvdtimes.co.uk"/> and in the United States and Canada on 23 March 2010.<ref name="amazon.com"/>

Two weeks before, in September 2002, Keller's crew gets a mission assignment and is set out to an isolated farmhouse where a family had been slaughtered days before. Their mission is to monitor a road as a sting to catch militants using it to transfer supplies. However, after an unintended stop at a mysterious shrine, a bored member of their group, Chard Davies, fires a few rounds at a stone idol, causing it to shatter. The squad's interpreter Wilcox believes that it was a shrine to a Djinn, a powerful deity made from a smokeless flame, which in mythology matched the legend of a genie. They return to their convoy and go to the farmhouse. While there, a series of bizarre events unfold.  A sandstorm comes up and the group catches an unnamed Afghan woman running in, seeking shelter. Unable to speak her language they are unable to understand what she is saying, though dubious to her arrival, they keep her in case there are more. During the following days, tension begins to mount in the group. Staff Sergeant Howston is unable to reach any of their allies by radio; when Wilcox attempts to, he hears a strange distress call stating that their sergeant has gone AWOL which Howston cannot hear. Paranoia begins to get the better of them when Howston receives word that they missed a car on the road which they cannot see, and their truck's ignition system is destroyed one night. Meanwhile, Howston and Wilcox are being haunted by gruesome images of people they had killed in the past. Wilcox goes missing, and the only witness seems to be team member Tino Hull, who sees another member, Jorge Wardell, giving off a terrifying roar before him. That night, Wilcox's dead body is found with his eyes removed and his face in a frozen expression of terror, and after a series of vivid and bizarre dreams Hull grabs another member Trevor Anderson and holds him at gunpoint as he accuses Wardell of killing Wilcox. Hull opens fire on Wardell and Davies is forced to retaliate, killing Hull. Howston orders them to take the bodies outside, and the next morning, the group is shocked to find that they are missing. Howston, slowly losing his grip on his sanity, orders Keller and Anderson to keep guard outside while he himself watches to make sure nothing else goes missing. While they are gone, Davies attempts to rape the Afghan girl, and in a heated moment calls Howston a "fucking nigger", prompting Howston to hit him. In anger, Davies attempts to attack Howston, and Howston finally cracks, killing Davies and ordering Anderson and Keller to stash his body outside. Afterwards, Howston goes missing, as does the girl as the remaining two attempt to make radio contact, Keller realizes that the voice he heard on the radio was that of Anderson when he makes the same radio call he had heard days prior. The pair plan to make a break for the rest of their group, but the girl appears briefly in the house and Keller goes to find her. Meanwhile, Anderson is confronted by the dead Wilcox who reveals himself to be a hideous creature. Before Anderson can react, however, he is killed by a shot to the head from the stalking Howston. Howston prowls the farm looking for Keller and is shocked when he comes across the same creature that Anderson had seen. His defenses lowered after running, Keller manages to gain the upper hand and slits the Sergeant's throat. Keller then encounters the Afghan girl, who turns out to be the Djinn, and manages to escape by throwing a grenade into the ammo-filled farmhouse. The following morning, Keller is grabbed by something from underneath the sand and pulled down, disappearing under the desert.  The first scene then recaps, and after the commanding officer tells him that he will be returned to the United States, he leaves. Keller then looks toward the camera, his eyes turning black revealing he is in fact the Djinn. As the screen pans out to the desert again it is revealed to the audience that Keller is dead, half buried in the sand, his eyes removed and his mouth open wide in terror. The screen then goes dark, and the credits roll.

The gambling boss is concerned that JP might attempt to win the fixed race but Frisbee reassures him that JP needs bail bond funds from the pay-off. JP attempts to win anyway while Frisbee resorts to using a remote detonator transmitter hidden in the palm of his hand, which the mob boss doesn't notice, causing JP's TransAM20000 to explode thereby making the 'Crab Sonoshee Sea' hovercraft, piloted by female racer Sonoshee "Cherry Boy Hunter" McLaren, the final winner.  While recuperating from the explosion in a planet Dorothy hospital, Frisbee tells JP he's off the hook with his [[Bail bondsman|bondsman]]. JP initially turns down the money but a crowd of reporters storms the hospital room where JP learns that he has been voted by popular demand for the Redline following the dropout of two qualifiers due to the revelation of the race's location as being on Roboworld—a planet dominated by militant zealot [[cyborg]]s whose President has threatened on interstellar television to hang all involved with the Redline mothership if it appears out of hyperspace over their planet. The broadcast (sent over the race's thousands of satellites) also exposes the secret weapons Roboworld has built-up against treaties.   Inside DEST Tower on Roboworld, the President asks Secretary of Defense Titan for a report about ships landing on Roboworld's moon, EUЯPSS (pronounced Europass) - a de-militarized zone that Roboworld signed away to refugees in the M-3 Nebula Federation, making it off limits to Roboworld's troops. The President obtains a verbal oath from Colonel Volton to fight to the death to protect Roboworld and the M-3 Nebula.  While the racers are staying on EUЯPSS before REDLINE under constant media coverage, Frisbee's alien junk dealer, Old Man Mole, wants to put weapons on the restored TransAM, which JP refuses despite his competitors being armed. Old Man Mole also protests the presence of Frisbee on their team and his insistence on using a rare uncontrollable hyper-powered engine, but eventually gives in to JP's convincing.  JP finds Sonoshee in the slow hours of the Oasis Restaurant on the moon. Shinkai, formerly of the Roboworld army, shows up at the Oasis when racer Little Deyzuna, a recently [[AWOL]] subordinate of Col. Volton, attacks Shinkai's partner, Trava. The Redline favorite, Machinehead, a tall menacing but ultimately well-mannered cyborg, appears, and is attacked by a sobbing Little Deyzuna, who is retrieved by Col. Volton. Machinehead confronts Volton for being in the de-militarized zone. Volton reminds the racer any Redline event will be repelled by the army and police before leaving the damaged restaurant.  Fireworks celebrations and [[bookmaker]] agent desks break out on Roboworld despite the threats from the military, and are raided by deadly android police robots. Miners on Roboworld use their power suits to sabotage the military base's power station while the Race Commission, which promotes gambling, hires Earth-native racing partners Lynchman and Johnny Boya to sabotage the Orbital Disintegration Cannon, which Secretary Titan plans to use to destroy the Redline mothership the instant it comes out of hyperspace.  While in hyperspace, the Princess from the planet Supergrass marks the race course on the military base with a pair of scout vessels, with the starting line to the north at the Knock-out Tower and the finish line to the south, east of DEST Tower. Unaware of the sabotage against the Orbital Disintegration Cannon, the President realizes the racers are on the planet after the cannon fails, and sends his troops ''en masse'' at the racers. The President becomes increasingly desperate as the racers evade them and approach the mine-laden Zone XXXXXXX (pronounced, "Seven-Ex"), lair of a secret illegal biological weapon named 'Funky Boy', who awakens from its stasis as the racers and the rebellious miners converge on it. With the several hundred foot tall Funky Boy awakening and subsequent destruction of the base coinciding with the orbital cannon coming back online, the President orders Funky Boy fired upon. The explosion takes out most of the Roboworld troops while JP pushes to right his overturned car off its side. Sonoshee, her vehicle totaled, agrees to ride with him to the finish line as Funky Boy regenerates. Funky Boy is taken out by Col. Volton, who had to dangerously merge physically with another bioweapon to do so.  Frisbee watches the race on several televisions parked atop a mesa in the mob boss's giant Cadillac hovercraft, where he revives the same deal as Yellowline. Frisbee however, refuses to detonate the explosive charge this time, wanting to see his friend win 'the big one' just one time. He is attacked by mobsters for his decision but is saved by Old Man Mole - who discovered Frisbee's sabotage - and shoots and kills the mob boss and his lackeys with a double barrel flechette firing shotgun.  As the race nears the finish line, Machinehead and JP race to the southern line boosted by their rare Steamlight boosters. As they come to a desperate neck-and-neck finish, a drunken Old Man Mole accidentally detonates Frisbee's remote detonator, propelling JP and Sonoshee towards the finish line, thrown from their vehicle. The boost is enough and JP wins by the length of his long duck tail pompadour.  As the racers rest at the end of the race amidst the ruins of Roboworld, JP and Sonoshee float back down to the ground kissing and thus declaring their love for each other. Machinehead (who vowed to win but comes in second) sees the romance and his rage turns to laughter, happy with the outcome anyway.

There, she becomes distraught by a well-intentioned, but overbearing woman who gives her unwelcome stories and advice about being pregnant.

He promises to visit her in Paris when she has the baby.  Mousse gives birth to baby girl, Louise, and Paul comes to see them at the hospital. Their reunion is a joyful event.

Joey does research online to find out what Bart is and seems to be stuck between a [[Zombie]] and [[Vampire]], finally stating that Bart is a [[Revenant]].  While buying beer from a small store in Koreatown, Bart and Joey become [[vigilantes]] when Bart both kills and feeds off of a gangster who is holding up the store. They enjoy the media coverage of the incident, and Joey asks Bart to bestow him with the "dark gift". Bart refuses to do so and laughs the idea off.

Joey returns to the apartment with a "pimped out" [[hearse]] for the two to use, and suggests that they go to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to continue their reign.

Bart is captured by [[SWAT]] teams and taken to jail, where, come dawn, he collapses in his cell. Upon nightfall, Bart reawakens in the morgue and escapes, returning to the apartment. Inside is a package containing Joey's severed head.  Since he was decapitated at night, Joey is still "alive", and Bart uses a vibrating [[dildo]] to enable Joey's head to talk.

Bart crushes Joey's head underneath a bulldozer, and then tries to find a way to kill himself.  Against normal convention, a bullet through the brain does not have the desired effect, and neither does hanging himself with Christmas lights. He even throws himself in front of the subway train, but only succeeds in severing his arm. Bart then boards a train, where he finds and reads a letter that Janet left in his uniform's pocket at his funeral. He breaks down and attacks the only other passenger. He is caught and flees into the station where more SWAT teams attempt to catch him.  He finally escapes to a hilltop and at dawn collapses once more, while he is being surrounded by men in [[Hazmat suit|hazmat suits]].

Within a few days, a client asks for a [[Bribe|kick-back]]. The top salesmen at AYS acquire large client contracts through bribery. In such corrupt company culture, Harpreet's honesty only brings him a demotion and humiliation. After making concessions to a client for the company, Harpreet realizes that sales success is dependent on the customer; so if the customer is satisfied then bribery will not be necessary to secure these contracts. No one agrees with him but Harpreet remains firm on his belief and forms his own company, Rocket Sales Corporation, from within AYS. Rocket Sales is being managed from the AYS offices where the Rocket partners were still employed. Unlike AYS, Rocket Sales Corporation's overall strategic goal is customer service and customer satisfaction as opposed to just selling the product through bribes and providing zero customer service. Other disgruntled employees of AYS find their way to Rocket Sales – a place where even the guy who serves tea is an equal partner because he brings talent to the table.  The five member company targets previous clients of AYS, who were irritated with AYS's attitude and soon enjoys a strong client reputation. The company soon becomes successful because of its dedication to excellent customer service. Although it does not make much profit. Rocket Sales Corp is able to make a huge difference. AYS's sales start decreasing as many the clients cancel their orders and place orders at Rocket Sales, which offers them better services. Harpreet starts a relationship with Sherena, his first client, whose fashion business had failed.  The MD of AYS, Sunil Puri, becomes angered by the small company's success. Puri moves quickly to attempt to contact the MD of Rocket Sales Corporation and in a phone conversation attempts to entice him to sell Rocket Sales Corporation to AYS (he does not know it is Harpreet). Harpreet not only rejects Puri's offer but says that his company will buy AYS Computers. Afraid of Puri's attempts, Harpreet's partners have a discussion and move their headquarters to Sherena's house, making her a partner in the process. After multiple failed attempts in locating the Rocket Sales Corporation office, Puri decides to call the number on Rocket Sales Corporation's brochures and the phone at the AYS reception desk begins to ring. After thoroughly insulting him and firing both him and his partners, the MD has Harpreet sign a contract handing over Rocket Sales to him for a final compensation of Re. 1. However, AYS is unable to maintain Rocket Sales' commitment to customer satisfaction because of its cold and greedy personnel. The MD, realizing his downfall in purchasing Rocket Sales, visits Harpreet at his new job at Croma, an electronics store, and returns the contract to Harpreet in return for Re. 1. He also tells him never to become a businessman again, because he will fail again. However, this is not intended as an insult, but rather as a compliment; he implies that what made Harpreet so successful was his eschewing of 'normal' business practices such as kick-backs, false advertisement, and low wages.  The ending scene is the new Rocket Sales office building where a prospective worker is going in for an interview. The firm is implied to be very successful. It shows the former employees, all partners of the business, and finally closes with Harpreet smiling genially at a desk, showing that in the long run, honesty and hard work are sound business practices.

Road, Movie
 Vishnu ([[Abhay Deol]]), a restless young man, itches to escape his father's faltering hair oil business.  An old truck beckons, which, Vishnu sees as his ticket to freedom. He offers to drive the 1942 [[Chevrolet]] across the desert to the sea, where it has been sold to a local museum. As he sets off across the harsh terrain of desert India, Vishnu discovers he is not merely transporting a battered vehicle but an old touring cinema.  Along the way, Vishnu reluctantly picks up a young runaway ([[Mohammed Faizal Usmani]]), a wandering old entertainer ([[Satish Kaushik]]) and a striking [[Romani people|gypsy]] woman ([[Tannishtha Chatterjee]]). Together they roam in the barren land, searching for water and an elusive fair. The journey turns dire when they are waylaid by corrupt cops and a notorious water lord.  The key to their freedom is the eccentric collection of films and the two forty-year-old film projectors in the back of the truck. As in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', if the films are good, they live and move on. If the films are boring, they face death in the outback.  The journey proves transformative for each of the travelers, but especially for Vishnu who discovers life, love and laughter on the Indian highway.  
RoboGeisha
 The film starts out with an assassination attempt on a political candidate by a Geisha (that turns out to be a robot) and two scantily-clad women wearing Tengu/Goblin masks. The goblin-clad women violently (and phalically) take out the body guards (notably shooting shuriken out their butts) as the politician is menaced and wounded by the robot geisha who has a circular saw blade in her mouth. Suddenly, another person named Yoshie (Aya Kiguchi) appears, reveals herself as a robogeisha, and destroys the villainous robot.  We go back in time to see Yoshie as a servant for her sister Kikue (Hitomi Hasebe), who is a geisha in training. It is later revealed that the two sisters were orphaned, and though they used to be close (with Kikue being the favorite child), they are now enemies. Yoshie is klutzy and ruins Kikue's performance for Hikaru Kageno ([[Takumi Saito]]), heir to Kageno Steel Manufacturing. Despite her klutziness, Kageno is impressed with Yoshie's beauty, and becomes more interested when he witnesses her display of superhuman strength when threatened by Kikue.  Eventually, Kageno invites the two sisters to his house, where they are captured by the goblin ladies. The two are forced to fight to the death, and after Kikue wounds and actually threatens to kill her sister, Yoshie snaps and knocks out Kikue, once again displaying superhuman physical prowess. Accordingly, Kageno and his father begin training Yoshie to become an assassin for the company along with many other young Geisha-type women, and she quickly becomes the head assassin. They are told that Kageno Steel seeks to use them to kill terrorists and other national threats in an effort to create an "Ideal World". Kikue, meanwhile, is relegated to the role of servant to the organization.  Nonetheless, Kikue strives to outdo her sister and shows a greater propensity for violence than Yoshie. Eventually, both sisters frequently undergo surgery to become cyborgs (Robogeisha), with machine-gun busts and other robotic enhancements. On their first mission, however, Kikue is severely wounded when she selflessly saves Yoshie from being killed by one of their target's bodyguards. Later, Kikue explains to Kageno that though Yoshie annoys her, she still loves her sister. Nonetheless, Kikue will never be able to recuperate sufficiently to serve as an assassin.  The story reaches a turning point when Yoshie is sent on a mission to kill a small group of elderly people and their young caretaker living near the Kageno Steel building. The seniors then reveal that they are the relatives of the Kageno Steel's geisha and goblin assassins, and that Kageno Steel has actually been abducting these girls to serve their own ends. Yoshie confronts Kageno and his father, who confirm the story. Then, the duo threaten to kill Kikue unless Yoshie completes what turns out to be a suicide mission. The other girls also have been devoid of a conscience and humanity for so long that they decline to return to their families, remaining geisha assassins.  Yoshie barely makes it out of the building after an Explosion from the Suicide mission and her body is recovered by the senior group and she is rebuilt by the leader, who used to work for Kageno Steel. The protestors want a meeting to demand the return of their loved ones. They found a set of Kageno's blueprints for a bomb that's said to be "17 times more powerful than the [[atomic bomb]]" and intend to use to threaten Japan into ceding all power to them. The group then heads off to confront Kageno and his father and force them to return their cyborg relatives or reveal the bomb plot to the authorities. But the Meeting is revealed to be a trap as the father and son have also robotically modified themselves and kill most of the senior group. The leader, however, had installed a gun into his leg and uses it to kill Kageno's father. Hiraku, now freed from responsibility, activates a protocol that turns his family castle into a giant robot. Kageno reveals that he intends to drop the bomb into Mount Fuji, thus destroying Japan and himself and "freeing" everyone. The robot-castle is wired to mimic Kageno's every move.  Yoshie launches an assault on the robot-castle, defeating her former geisha sisters and the goblin girls (in a battle featuring a butt-sword duel). She confronts Kageno, but is met by Kikue who has been upgraded into a superior model of robogeisha and who has had her mind wiped. Kikui defeats Yoshie. Knowing she has been bested, Yoshie reveals that, in fact, she was her father's favorite daughter because Kikue was actually born to their father's mistress and was looked down upon. Yoshie reminds Kikue that in fact, it was Yoshie who had defended Kikue's honor as a child and then also allowed Kikue to build their false history and become the family geisha. Finally, Yoshie confesses that she loves Kikue. These revelations manage to overcome Kikue's memory blocks and the two sisters reconcile and merge into one ultra-powerful robogeisha.  The new robogeisha confronts Kageno and trick him during their fight to have the robot-castle (which mirrors his fighting moves) stop the bomb from being dropped into Mount Fuji and launch the bomb and robot-castle into space. Once airborne, the sisters defeat Kageno and the bomb detonates, destroying the robot-castle and all inside (including, presumably, our heroes). The film ends with Yoshie imagining she and her sister living happily as real geisha.  
Road to Sangam
 A simple story of a how a God fearing, devout [[Muslim]] [[mechanic]] named Hashmatullah ([[Paresh Rawal]]), resident of [[Allahabad]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], who has been entrusted the job of repairing an old [[Ford Flathead engine|Ford V8 engine]] not knowing the historic significance – that it once carried the ashes of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] which were immersed in the holy [[Triveni Sangam]], imbibes the Gandhian values. The film begins with an imaginary sequence of events. The story has been imagined such that after Mahatma Gandhi's assassination in 1948, his ashes were divided into 20 parts and sent to different provinces of India and then brought back, recollected and dispersed in [[Triveni Sangam]] in Allahabad. All (but one) parts of his ashes were dispersed in 1948 but one part somehow lay forgotten in a locker of Orissa State Bank for decades until one day this error is realised and Gandhi's grandson claims it back by filing an application in the Orissa High Court. Government decides to honour Mahatma Gandhi's grandson's wish is to disperse this forgotten part of ashes in [[Triveni Sangam]] in the same way the other parts of the ashes were dispersed. So the same Ford lorry which was used in 1948 is to be used again, and its engine has been given to Hashmat (Paresh Rawal) to be repaired. Hashmat comes to know about historic significance of the engine he is repairing when a news channel reporter comes to interview him. In another parallel development, there has been a terrorist bomb blast in a court of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. In relation to that bomb attack, Uttar Pradesh Police arrests some suspects (suspected to have links with the terror organisation [[Hizb-ul-Mujahideen]]) from various cities of [[Uttar Pradesh]] including the Muslim neighbourhood of [[Allahabad]], where Hashmat lives. Hashmat is General Secretary of the Managing Committee of the main Mosque of [[Allahabad]] (Masjid-e-Azam). The Mosque Committee decides to hold a protest against the government and Police outside the Court Complex for arresting Muslim suspects. While Police tries to block the entry of protesting Muslims into the court, many of them succeed in breaking the police cordon and entering the court premises. Police beat them up with canes (lathicharge). One Muslim protestor, while trying to scale the boundary wall of the Court, dies in an accident. It is revealed that the youth who died in the accident was none other than the nephew of Chairman of the Mosque Committee [[Nawab]] Kasuri (played by [[Om Puri]]). Infuriated [[Nawab]] Kasuri supported by [[Maulana]] of the Mosque Masjid-e-Azam calls for a 'Bandh' (General Strike) by all Muslims. All Muslims, whether in public or private sector, are ordered to stop work. Hashmat is caught between the community and his promise to deliver the Ford engine after repair to his friend - Mr. Rizvi- who works with Government of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. First he decides to return the engine unrepaired and goes to meet Mr. Rizvi at the museum where Mr. Rizvi works. He does not get to meet Mr. Rizvi but driven by circumstances he comes to know that [[Mahatma Gandhi]] laid his life fighting for safety of Muslims during Partition. His conscience appeals to him and he resolves to deliver the engine for Mahatma Gandhi's cause. He asks the Mosque Committee to make exception for him (as this is for a cause) allowing him to return to work and deliver the engine in time, but Mosque Committee insults him and rebukes him. His family and friends turn against him. He is pressurised and physically attacked but he carries on with his work eventually winning over hearts of his fellow Muslims (who regarded him as a traitor) with Gandhian values and methods.  The film very beautifully captures the split personality of Indian Muslims through symbolism. In a scene, right in the beginning of the film, some Muslims are shown praising Pakistani Cricket Team and its famous players like [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Javed Miandad]] insinuating towards the support which Pakistani Cricket Team enjoys over Indian Cricket Team in Muslim neighbourhoods of India. In contrast, the main protagonist Hashmatullah (portrayed as a moderate patriot Muslim) praises [[Sachin Tendulkar]] in the same scene. In a scene, it is shown how aristocrats are ruling the Muslim community with an iron fist. [[Nawab]] Kasuri ([[Om Puri]]) is angry with Hashmat and his family because Hashmat's late elder brother, who was once an employee in [[Nawab]] Kasuri's household, had contested an election against him for the Chairmanship of the Mosque Committee. Because a former employee dared to contest election against him the aristocrat bears a grudge against him for life. In many scenes, ordinary Muslims are seen fearing the aristocrat- [[Nawab]] Kasuri. In one argument, Hashmat asks his fellow shopkeepers, would they have not allowed him to work if this work was for cause of a Muslim personality, (and after a pause he says) like Jinnah. Hashmat sees Gandhi as one of his own not as a Hindu leader, and that is why he makes his work his cause, whereas for other Muslims Mosque's order is above any cause.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead
 Julian Marsh ([[Jake Hoffman]]), an unemployed young [[lothario]], is forced by his doctor dad ([[Chip Zien]]) to accept a job directing an off-Broadway play called ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead'', which is described as a weird adaptation of ''Hamlet''. The play has been written by a mysterious, pallid Romanian named Theo Horace ([[John Ventimiglia]]), a vampire who has just killed a young woman ([[Bijou Phillips]]). Unaware of the danger that surrounds Theo's play, Julian casts his best friend Vince ([[Kris Lemche]]) as Hamlet and uses his new job to impress his ex-girlfriend, Anna ([[Devon Aoki]]), an aspiring actress. To Julian's dismay, Anna has taken up with a shady businessman named Bobby Bianchi ([[Ralph Macchio]]), who has reputed ties to the Mafia. When Anna is cast as Ophelia, she slowly gets involved with Theo. The roles of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Theo's play are filled by Carlo ([[Carlos Velazquez]]) and Mickey (Mike Landry), two narcissistic actors as foolish as the characters they are cast to play. Opening night draws near and people begin to die. Two bumbling New York City detectives ([[Jeremy Sisto]] and Lou Carbonneau) chase suspects as the movie builds to its climactic sequence.<ref></ref>  ===The play within the film===  Theo's play, ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead'', is revealed in short segments throughout the movie. Its basic plot points are that Hamlet's friend Horatio (played by Theo) is a master [[vampire]], over 2000 years old, who had once lived in ancient Rome. Through a series of twists and turns, Hamlet and his simple-minded friends, [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]], become vampires themselves. When Horatio attempts to turn Hamlet's girlfriend [[Ophelia]] into a vampire, she thwarts him by drowning herself first. Hamlet angrily confronts Horatio but discovers that one vampire cannot kill another. His only hope of reversing the curse that rendered him a vampire is to find the [[Holy Grail]] and drink from it. Horatio also becomes obsessed with finding the Grail in order to destroy it. The battle for the Grail between Hamlet and Horatio lasts for centuries and leads to the creation of four plays, each concealing a secret message. The first is [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', written at Horatio's bidding. The second is ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'', written in the nineteenth century by [[W. S. Gilbert]] (half of the duo of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]). The third is [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', written in 1964. The final play in the cycle is this one, ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead'', written by Horatio himself under the name Theo Horace, with the purpose of luring the real Hamlet into a final confrontation.

Meanwhile, an escaped prisoner named Song Gi-tae intervenes in the celebration and steals Pil-seong's money. When Pil-seong finds out what has happened he confronts the criminal, but suffers a humiliating defeat.  Pil-seong reports to his colleagues and his boss that he encountered the infamous Gi-tae, but none of them believed in him. In an attempt to recapture Gi-tae, Pil-seong decides to recruit his friends (who were beaten up by Gi-tae earlier) and found him inside a house with his girlfriend, Kyeong-joo. Formulating a plan, Pil-seong tells his friends to stand by the outside window of where Gi-tae was, while Pil-seong himself sneaks into the house, armed with [[pepper spray]]. Gi-tae, however, was aware of Pil-seong's presence and once escaped before the police arrived. Before leaving, Gi-tae takes out his knife, stabs Pil-seong's right hand, and warns him that the next time he'll kill him if he tries to capture him again.  Suffering from [[public humiliation]] as well as being kicked out of the house by his wife (because of her money), Pil-seong decides to train himself in fighting Gi-tae. When taking [[taekwondo]] lessons one day, Pil-seong learns that the upper part of the [[human rib cage]] is the vulnerable area of taking his opponents down. He later buys himself his own handgun as his own personal defense weapon.  In the next encounter of Gi-tae, Pil-seong got him surrounded by keeping Kyeong-joo hostage.

Holding a gasoline tank, he gives Pil-seong one hour to meet him and bring the money, or else he'll destroy the manwha shop with his family inside.  Pil-seong did as he was told but also asked his colleagues and [[policemen]] to arrive in his family's manwha shop. Pil-seong arrived in a small fenced area and buried the money, before Gi-tae came. Wanting to capture Gi-tae, he non-fatally shoots him in the stomach with his handgun. He discards his handgun and takes Gi-tae's knife and asks for a [[hand to hand combat|fair fight]]. The battle then ensures as both Pil-seong and Gi-tae beat each other up to the pulp.  Finally cornering Pil-seong, Gi-tae asks him for the money and threatens to kill him if he doesn't. Gi-tae finds the money and walks off. However, Pil-seong regained consciousness and eventually defeats his opponent by accurately striking him in the upper rib cage. Pil-seong is barely conscious from the fight, but is satisfied on his efforts of capturing Gi-tae. Pil-seong's colleagues later finds him in the cell sleeping with Gi-tae handcuffed.

Saat Paake Bandha
 Rahul ([[Jeet (actor)|Jeet]]), the son of a wealthy but traditional industrialist, returned home to his father after completing his academic career in foreign lands. When the father tries to persuade him in his marriage he puts up a fantastic condition -  that he will marry the girl of his father’s choice and will live as married couple for one year only, after which, if either of the two seems to feel distant from the other, the marriage will be called off. Surprisingly, the traditional father agrees and chooses Pallavi ([[Koel Mallick]]), his PA as the most appropriate bride.  Now Pallavi’s family consisted of her widowed mother, an elder sister deprived of her husband, a younger brother not at all competent for any job, and the youngest sister getting pregnant with the boyfriend trying to avoid responsibilities. So Pallavi, just to save her family, accepted the contract much against her wishes and thus began a curious way of life with both of the wedlocked couple leading an unreal lifestyle.  Though both shared the same bed, but Rahul seemed to be oddly insensitive to Pallavi’s emotions. Thus it was not strange that he never cared to celebrate Pallavi’s birthday and his scathing remarks while appreciating Pallavi’s cooking hurt her feelings and duty seemed the only virtue that kept Rahul any closer to his wife. But the artificiality of the story is vividly brought to fore when Rahul, after quickly recovering from a comatose condition, chiefly due to Pallavi’s sincerest nursing, doesn’t hesitate to declare that the next day is the end of their contract term when he will be willingly divorcing Pallavi. Well at this point if the audience thought that the story is nearing a tragic completion, it is only the Intermission that is declared.  In the second half we see that the table turns as Rahul suddenly feels sympathetic to Pallavi and all his passions overwhelms him so much that he rushes to his in-laws’ house and requests Pallavi’s return. But no says the director, and the story goes on with Pallavi now rejecting all the ardent proposals of Rahul, be it him buying all the shares of Pallavi’s new struggling organization just to secure for himself the position of Pallavi’s boss. Surprises seem to be on store for the audience with Pallavi conceiving a child (just imagine that Rahul was in comatose for a pretty long time and the day he recovered, the couple separated) and now Rahul, in sympathy arranges for an AC bus for her and shifts her office to the ground floor. Now the only thing that remains is revelation and Pallavi invites and insults Rahul in one of the most improbable of settings with Rahul sophisticatedly defending his views.  Finally after all these, the two again reunites in hospital bed after the severely injured Rahul takes Pallavi to the maternity ward (it is clearly indicated in the picture that Pallavi was less than seven months pregnant though she suffers serious labour pains and again when the baby was delivered no sign of immaturity is ever observed) and they celebrate the simultaneous delivery of the child and Rahul’s recovery from his critical condition. Thus family ties are again restored and the happy ending is guaranteed.

Jodie is reluctant as she does not get on with her mother. She finds her mother, Beth ([[Neve McIntosh]]) in her room having sex with Kieran ([[Shaun Dooley]]). Disgusted, Jodie storms out and stays at her friend Lianne's ([[Jessica Baglow]]) house across the street, despite Beth's pleas. Beth argues with Lianne's mother Pam ([[Debbie Rush]]) but she will not let her in to see Jodie.  As Beth stands in front of Lianne's house, a team of special forces soldiers appears and orders everyone inside. Mr Sharma emerges from his house covered in blood and armed with a knife. As he advances towards the soldiers, he is shot dead. Beth gets back into her house with Kieran and the two hear gunfire outside. A television news report shows a [[shipping container]] washed up on a nearby beach. Three bodies were found near it and another further inland. The power then goes off.  A man breaks into the house and attacks them, and after a struggle, Kieran kills him. The man turns out to be Beth's next-door neighbour Peter Davis (Alan Pattison), who had smashed his way in through the communal wall between their lofts. Beth and Kieran enter Peter's house, finding the place trashed and his wife dead. Pam bangs on the door shouting for help, but before they can let her in she is dragged away and killed.  The two see the body of a soldier in Peter's garden and get out to retrieve his radio. The soldier turns out to be alive. They carry the soldier, Akede (Kevin Harvey), inside and tend to his wound. Akede reveals that Mr. Sharma was an [[al-Qaeda]] terrorist and the shipping container contained weapons for a terrorist operation. Later, Beth hears Akede talking on his radio saying his team were killed by a creature. As she confronts him, he tells her that the true cause of the chaos is due to an experiment to create a creature to be used as a weapon. It was being carried away for destruction by a helicopter, but the helicopter went down in the sea. The shipping container containing the creature washed up on the beach, and was opened by three drunk teenagers. It killed them and escaped.

Beth wakes up and finds herself tied up and gagged outside, presumably to act as bait. Kieran, badly wounded but still alive, appears and unties her. They attempt to flee, but run into the sergeant major, who stabs Kieran to death. Beth flees into the woods, pursued by the soldiers, and finds the paperboy's body. The creature appears, but does not notice her, and attacks the soldiers.  Beth goes to Lianne's house to find her daughter. She finds Lianne, who tells her that Jodie has gone home. Beth flees the house, narrowly avoiding the soldiers. Gunshots are heard inside, implying that they kill Lianne. Back at her house, Beth finds Jodie, but they are attacked by the creature. Beth manages to stab it to death as it attacks Jodie, but as she stands up and screams in triumph she is shot dead by one of the soldiers. Jodie tries to help her mother while the soldiers freeze in shock.

Saw VI
 Two [[Predatory lending|predatory lenders]] wake up in a room with a caged-in scale, wearing head harnesses with screws aimed at their temples, and the one who sets more flesh weight on their scale will survive. The overweight Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called over by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who found Peter Strahm's fingerprints at the scene. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed the autopsies for all of the Jigsaw victims thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.  While at the hospital to meet with Simone, Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins, who claims to have found something at the meatpacking plant. He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic and tells her that he is taking control of the games. Jill gives him five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramer's will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof that his methods work. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to the hospital, shows that Jill met with John at the plant hours before his death, where he gave her the box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.  William Easton, an insurance executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed to heart disease after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned [[zoo]], where he and his janitor, Hank, awaken in [[vise]]s designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into [[oxygen mask]]s strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a [[hanging]] room, a [[steam room]], and [[carousel]] trap. Flashbacks show that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for only deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.  The game is viewed by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the observation room, which contains a tank of [[hydrofluoric acid]] and a switch marked "Live" and "Die". Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side of the room. During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm's death. The moment his voice is unscrambled, Hoffman kills everyone in the room, with Perez mockingly telling him that everyone already knows of his involvement before she dies. He then plants fingerprints using Strahm's severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.  He returns to the observation room and finds the letter he had written to Amanda, in which he had used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches the end of his path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch to "Die" and a bed of needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope from John's will, which contains ''his'' photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand to free his wrist restraints and jams the trap in window bars as it activates. He then pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek in the process and screams in agony.

He recognizes Hyun-soo's talents and employs him for the biggest scam yet, also giving him a nice makeover. Hyun-soo joins the other members of Hwang's dream team for the 60 billion won heist: Jo Min-hyeong, an elite stock broker who doubles as the think tank of fraudulent trades (musical star [[Kim Mu-yeol]] makes his big screen debut); sexy private banker Yoo Seo-yeon ([[Kim Min-jung (actress)|Kim Min-jung]]); Park Chang-joo, a second-generation chaebol CEO facing a management crisis (veteran supporting actor Jo Deok-hyun); and Bryan Choi ([[Jun-seong Kim|Kim Jun-seong]]), a Korean-American fund manager who fakes foreign investment as a "black-haired foreigner."  These are professional stock gamblers who win the house by reading everyone else's cards. They opt for new scientific technology, the cream of the crop for stock scams. Park's [[chaebol]] company invests heavily in a friend's new environmental research and Seo-yeon has one of her clients buy the company's shares. They have a famous broadcaster hype public attention while Bryan creates the illusion of foreign investment, and the cash starts flowing in from blind "ants."

Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins
 In Coolsville, [[Ohio]], four teenagers are accidentally involved in a fight on the school bus, which causes the bus to crash into a flagpole, which falls on Vice Principal Grimes' 2007 [[Ford Mustang]], smashing its windshield. Because of the fight on the bus and the damage to Grimes' car, the teenagers are sent to the library for detention. [[Shaggy Rogers|Norville "Shaggy" Rogers]] is a [[Accident-proneness|clumsy]], [[geek]]y [[Outcast (person)|outcast]], who tried to smuggle his dog [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] onto the bus; [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] is [[quarterback]] of the football team; [[Velma Dinkley]] is a science nerd; and [[Daphne Blake]] is in the drama club and very wealthy. They bond somewhat over a shared interest in mysteries, but quickly get on each other's nerves. Two [[ghost]]s suddenly appear and chase them to the gym where a pep rally is taking place. A third ghost, The Specter appears, causing the lights in the building to flicker. He starts telling everyone to leave. The stamp-collecting Principal Deedle decides to close the school, but Vice Principal Grimes deems it a prank and suspends the quartet as he refuses to believe that there are ghosts in the school.  The gang tries to clear their names by investigating the ghosts at the school, which leads to Grimes expelling them and threatening to have them arrested if they're caught sneaking into the school again. Further investigation, in disguise at the school, makes them think Grimes is their prime suspect. Searching at night at Grimes' house leads them to information about a time capsule. The ghosts attack again, and the teens are knocked out. The Specter, keeping Scooby and Grimes as prisoners, forces the gang to search underground for the time capsule. Unable to find the capsule, they trick the Specter into coming down to carry the capsule out of the hole, but the plan backfires when they try to lock him up in a flooded room, and the Specter acquires the capsule.  Stealing the capsule back, the gang uses a book of [[spell (paranormal)|spells]] to banish the ghosts. Scooby manages to break free of his restraints and arrives just in time to subdue the Specter, who turns out to be Principal Deedle. The principal reveals that a stamp misprint was hidden within the time capsule, something that would have been worth a fortune. The time capsule was meant to be buried when the school first opened, but a flood hit the town that day and the capsule was lost in the old school underneath the new school. Deedle being determined to claim the misprint in the time capsule used the spell book to summon the ghosts to scare everyone away so he as the Specter can open the time capsule himself. As the exposed Deedle is fired from his job and is sent to prison for his crimes, the group is publicly congratulated (and un-expelled) by Grimes (who becomes the new Principal) who also apologises to the gang for falsely accusing them. In the film's ending, the group decide to stay together and solve mysteries, and they head off to "investigate some strange goings-on at the Coolsville museum", a hint to the very first episode of ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' and their very first case, The Black Knight Ghost.  
Scooby-Doo! and the Samurai Sword
 At a [[Tokyo]] museum of ancient history, Mr. Takagawa, the curator, and Kenji, a janitor, witness the resurrection of the evil Black [[Samurai]], an ancient Japanese warrior whose armor was to be the newest exhibit at the museum. The next day, the [[Mystery Inc.]] gang arrives at [[Tokyo]], where [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] is ready to participate in a [[martial arts]] tournament at a prestigious academy. The gang meet Daphne’s friend Miyumi, who explains the difficulty of winning the tournament and entering the school as a student. The gang and Miyumi take a fully functioning robotic plane to the school, which is run by Miss Mirimoto. After Daphne defeats Miss Mirimoto’s bodyguard, Sojo, and almost defeats Miyumi, Mirimoto tells her she shows promise as a fighter. Also at the tournament is Mr. Takagawa, who explains to Mirimoto that the Black Samurai has risen and will be after the Destiny Scroll, which is at the school. That night, during a feast, the Black Samurai and his [[Ninja]] warriors attack the school and steal the scroll. But Mirimoto explains the scroll was only a copy, and shows the gang the real one. Mr. Takagawa explains to the gang the legend of the Black Samurai.  The Black Samurai was an ancient warrior who asked the great swordsmith [[Masamune]] to craft a powerful sword. The sword maker agreed, but told the Samurai it would take a year to make. Masamune’s evil apprentice [[Muramasa]] offered to make another sword for the Samurai in only half the time, which the Samurai accepted. But the apprentice's evil nature passed into the blade, and when the Samurai took the sword, the evil was transferred to him, and he became the Black Samurai, wielding the Sword of Doom. When Masamune finished crafting his sword, the Sword of Fate, he presented it to the Green Dragon, who used it to fight against the Black Samurai. After a long battle in the sky, the Green Dragon successfully defeated the Black Samurai and imprisoned him in the Sword of Doom. The Dragon then hid the sword, and put its whereabouts in a riddle on the Destiny Scroll.  [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] is able to solve the riddle, and Miss Mirimoto instructs the gang, Miyumi and Mr. Takagawa to find the Sword of Doom before the spirit can. The gang finds the sword in a cave on an island in the [[Pacific Ocean]], where they deal with a tribe living on the island and are attacked by the Black Samurai. During the fight, the Black Samurai is revealed to be Sojo. But once the gang brings Sojo back to Miss Mirimoto, she and Miyumi capture them. Miss Mirimoto explains that she staged the tournament to bring the Mystery Inc to Japan so that they would find the Sword of Doom for her. She also reveals she plans to release the Black Samurai so she can use him to return Japan to the way it was in [[Feudalism|feudal times]]. The ninja army is revealed to be robots in which Miss Mirimoto planted the various fighting techniques of her students (including Daphne's). She then locks [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], Daphne, Velma and Mr. Takagawa in the museum, but not before Daphne kicks the Samurai's sword from Miss Mirimoto's hand into [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby]] and Shaggy's possession.  Scooby and Shaggy manage to escape Miss Mirimoto with the samurai sword, but are chased by the ninja warriors. They are saved by Matsuhiro, a sushi shop owner and Samurai (but also lose the sword to the ninja warriors in the process), who trains them as Samurai and who also is aware of the legend. Matsuhiro instructs Scooby and Shaggy to pass through the gates of earth, air, fire and water in order to find the Green Dragon and the Sword of Fate. When they do so, the Green Dragon enters the sword and takes them back to the museum to combat the Black Samurai. Kenji frees Fred, Daphne, Velma and Mr. Takagawa, and they, plus Miyumi, who decides to fight with them, attempt to stop Sojo and Miss Mirimoto from resurrecting the Black Samurai, but their plan fails. After reviving the Samurai, Miss Mirimoto tries to make him her servant, but she has miscalculated-the villain has no interest in working alongside her, and throws her against the palace stairs, knocking her out (leaving her and Sojo's fate unknown). Scooby and Shaggy arrive riding the Green Dragon and, along with a little encouragement from Matsuhiro, defeat the Black Samurai by using the Sword of Fate to destroy the Sword of Doom, breaking the curse on the Samurai, who finally passes on to the afterlife. The gang later attends the newly renovated museum, where a statue of Scooby is erected in his honor.

The Secret of Kells
 Brendan, a young, curious, and idealistic boy living in the tightly knit community at the [[Abbey of Kells]], is under the strict care of his stern uncle, Abbot Cellach. Cellach is obsessed with building a wall around the Abbey, in order to prevent [[Viking]] attacks.  Brendan is apprenticed in the [[scriptorium]] of the monastery. After listening to the other monks of the monastery talk about Brother Aidan, the creator of the Book of Iona, Brendan is curious about the mysterious illuminator and "the book that turns darkness into light" (the unfinished [[Book of Kells]]). Aidan arrives in Kells, accompanied by his white cat, [[Pangur Bán]], after his own monastery is destroyed by a raid. After eavesdropping on a discussion between Cellach and Aidan, Brendan wanders to the scriptorium, where he finds the still-to-be-completed book. Pangur Bán guards the book, but when the cat sees that Brendan means no harm to the book, she accepts him. Aidan arrives and tells Brendan about the book.  Seeing Brendan as a suitable apprentice, Aidan sends Brendan, with Pangur Bán for company, into the woods to obtain [[Oak apple|gall nuts]] to make ink for the illumination of the book. However, Brendan is cornered by a hungry pack of wolves. He is saved by Aisling, the forest spirit from the beginning of the film. Although at first suspicious of Brendan's presence, Aisling slowly comes to accept him after he reveals his intentions of helping to create the book.  After a brief yet scary close encounter with [[Crom Cruach]], a deity of death and destruction, of whom Aisling is deeply afraid, Brendan and Aisling return to the outskirts of the forest. She assures Brendan that he can come back and visit anytime he wants.  Upon his return home, Brendan is reprimanded by Cellach, who forbids him to leave the monastery again. However, Brendan continues to work with Aidan. Brendan learns that Aidan's work is endangered by the loss of the Eye of [[Columba|Colm Cille]], a special magnifying lens captured from [[Crom Cruach]]. When Brendan tries to leave to visit Crom's cave to obtain another Eye, he is confined to his room by Cellach.  Pangur Bán and Aisling set Brendan free. After running into the heart of the woods, Brendan tells Aisling of his objective. A shocked Aisling begs him not to confront the dark deity, warning that Crom Cruach will kill him just as it killed the rest of her people. But Brendan persuades Aisling to assist him, by stating that if he does not retrieve the Eye, the book will never be completed. Convinced, Aisling helps Brendan enter Crom's cave, nearly getting killed in the process.  Brendan duels with Crom and seizes the Eye, blinding Crom and causing the dark deity to consume itself, becoming an [[ouroboros]]. Upon returning to the cave entrance, Brendan finds the forest covered in white flowers.  Brendan returns to the abbey and continues to assist Aidan in secret. The brothers of the monastery excitedly watch the two create the book. In a fit of frustration, Cellach locks Brendan and Aidan in the scriptorium, but not before ripping out a page that Brendan had created for the book. Shortly thereafter, the Vikings invade Kells, and Cellach watches in horror as they breach the wooden gate. Brendan and Aidan manage to escape by using smoke from the gall berry ink, confusing the raiders when they burst into the scriptorium.  Meanwhile, the wooden staircase to the central tower of the abbey becomes overloaded with panicked villagers and collapses.  The village and abbey below is set ablaze.  Cellach is wounded by an arrow, and stabbed by a Viking raider; Brendan is dragged away by the frantic Aidan, who tells him that there is nothing that he can do.  After they leave, Cellach, having survived the attack, sees the burning remains of the scriptorium. The central tower of the abbey is left untouched by the Vikings, leaving the few villagers and Brother Tang to survive the carnage. Thinking that his nephew has perished, Cellach falls into a deep despair.  While running through the woods, Brendan and Aidan are confronted by the raiders, and the Viking leader takes the book's bejeweled cover and scatters the pages. Before two Viking raiders can kill Brendan and Aidan, Aisling's black wolves attack the Vikings, saving the two refugees. Brendan and Aidan gather the pages and depart. Cellach and the remaining villagers take refuge in the monastery.  Brendan and Aidan travel across Ireland, and, after many years, complete the book. Aidan, after entrusting the book to Brendan, dies. The now-adult Brendan returns to Kells with Pangur Bán, guided by Aisling (in wolf form). The aged guilt-ridden Cellach is nearing death. Brendan and the abbot happily reunite, and Brendan displays the complete Book of Kells to his uncle. The film closes with an animation rendition of some of the illuminated pages of the book.  
The Secret in Their Eyes
   Retiree Benjamín Espósito is having trouble getting started on his first novel. He pays a visit to the offices of Judge Irene Menéndez Hastings to tell her about his plans to recount the story of the Liliana Coloto case, the one they both worked on 25 years before, when Irene was his new department chief and he was the federal agent assigned to the case. Irene suggests that Benjamin start at the beginning.  The beginning marks the discovery of Coloto's body, raped and murdered in her home in 1974. Espósito promises her widower, Ricardo Morales, that the killer will do life for his crime. Morales states that he opposes the death penalty. Espósito's investigation is joined by his alcoholic friend and assistant, Pablo Sandoval, and the [[Cornell Law School]]-educated Menéndez. Before the three can start, their rival, Romano, tries to show them up by having officers beat a confession out of two innocent laborers, who had been working near the couple's apartment. Espósito has the confessions overturned and lashes out at Romano in a justice building hall. Espósito threatens to file a complaint as Romano racially insults the construction workers.  Back on the case, Espósito notices that pictures from Coloto's home town of [[Chivilcoy]] frequently show a man named Isidoro Gómez whose eyes never leave her. Although Irene is skeptical, Benjamín insists all of a young man's feeling for a woman is spoken there. Seeing that Gómez has disappeared, Espósito and Sandoval travel to Chivilcoy and sneak into Gómez's mother's house, where they find his letters to her. Sandoval steals them but they contain nothing useful and, when their supervising judge learns of the illegal action, the case is closed. Over an evening review of the manuscript, Benjamín reminds Irene that it was only one week later that she announced her engagement. He also recalls backing out of a conversation with her in which he was about to shut the door. The memory is poignant, and Irene decides that she cannot revisit the past through his novel anymore.  The case is reopened after a year when Espósito sees that Morales maintains daily surveillance of Buenos Aires railway stations looking for Gómez. After receiving Menéndez's approval, Sandoval studies the letters and notices references to the players of [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Football Club]] in Buenos Aires. Espósito and Sandoval attend four matches of Racing until they are able to spot Gómez in the crowd. Gómez leads the police through a chase before being arrested. Menéndez is able to break Gómez by making taunting remarks about him being too weak to commit the crime. Feeling emasculated, Gómez exposes his penis and shouts a confession.  In 1975, the widower sees his wife's killer on television, included in a security detail for the then president of Argentina, [[María Estela Martínez de Perón]]. Menéndez and Espósito quickly establish that Romano, now working for a government intelligence agency, released the murderer out of spite. Romano claims that Gómez has violent talents that should be used to combat left wing guerrillas instead of being squandered in prison. Romano insults them both, taunting Espósito for being beneath Menéndez. Undeterred, she later invites Espósito to offer his objections to her impending marriage plans later that night. Before they can meet, however, he has to leave a very intoxicated Sandoval in his living room to fetch his wife. When they return, they find Sandoval murdered. Espósito assumes he was the target of either Romano or Gómez and accepts the remote isolation of [[Jujuy Province]]. Late one night, while contemplating the sacrifice of his lost friend Pablo, Benjamín gets a call from Irene asking to see the rest of his book. Menéndez takes him to the train station for a disconsolate goodbye.  When Irene finishes reading, she and Benjamin still seek inspiration for a suitable ending. They are able to locate Ricardo Morales leading a quiet life in a [[rural area]] of [[Buenos Aires Province]]. Although the widower apparently has relinquished his obsession with the murder case, Benjamín has to ask him how he has lived without the love of his life for 25 years. When Benjamín repeats Pablo's final promise to get Isidoro, Ricardo hesitantly confesses that in 1975 he kidnapped Isidoro and shot him dead. Feeling that something is not right, Benjamín follows Ricardo to a small building near the main house, where he is shocked to find Isidoro living in a makeshift cell, undetectable from the outside. Isidoro begs for human contact and Ricardo reminds Benjamín of his promise that Isidoro would never go free. Benjamín pays his respects at Pablo's grave, then goes to see Irene with an evident sense of purpose. She notices something different in his eyes, reminds him that it will be complicated, and asks him to close the door.

Materialistic dreams and mental anguishes collide as the lives of the three confused friends, and the women surrounding them, spirals out of control. The film is a stylistic psychological study, with its gritty story portrayed with creative images, disjointed cuts and a slick, stylistic camera work and aesthetics.

Seinfeld: A XXX Parody
 Like most episodes of the original show, ''Seinfeld: A XXX Parody'' opens with a stand-up sequence from [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Gerry]] ([[James Deen]]) about pornography. The film then cuts into a XXX video store, where Gerry and [[Elaine Benes|Elania]] (Kristina Rose) are attempting to purchase porn from a man known as “[[List of Seinfeld minor characters#Characters appearing in 2 to 4 episodes|The Porn Nazi]]” ([[Evan Stone]]). Gerry manages to buy a movie from the guy, but Elania is unsuccessful due to her behavior towards him. At Gerry’s apartment, Gerry is watching the film he bought, and he and Elania have sex. In the next scene at the apartment with Gerry and [[George Costanza|Gorge]] (Steve Pomerants), [[Cosmo Kramer|Crammer]] (Eric John) comes in saying he is unable to masturbate to his old porn movies he owns. Being dissatisfied, Crammer decides to make his own porn. When he exits the scene, Gerry complains about a girl who has a crush on him, Regina ([[Ashlynn Brooke]]), because she orgasms too easily, and Gorge rants about getting married to [[List of Seinfeld minor characters#Characters appearing in 2 to 4 episodes|Suzanne]] (Natalie Norton) in less than a month, reasoning that "the [[pope]] gets more pussy than I do." Gerry suggests Gorge to spice up their love life.  Back at the video store, Elania makes another try at getting a porn video, but the Porn Nazi recognizes her and she fails again. The woman who works next to the man at the counter (London Keyes) is also having problems with him, and she goes in the back room with Elania. The former offers to give Elania the Nazi's secret distributor if she'll make out with her, which the latter accepts. Meanwhile, Crammer is getting food from a picnic table when he happens to stumble upon a porn shoot between [[Sasha Grey]] and Sadie West. The camera man mistakenly takes Crammer as the actor who is going to be in the scene, which he joins. Back at Gerry’s apartment, Crammer is shooting his own porn with Suzanne and a guy named Buck (Tony Disergio). The next scene, Gerry and Regina are watching TV at the apartment, and after Regina is getting turned on from looking at the newscasters, he decides to let her know that he cannot take her orgasms anymore. She leaves, and [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Noman]] (J. Walker) enters the room to get the tape Crammer shot so he can deliver it to Gorge.  Noman encounters Regina in the stairwell, picks her up and goes to the store with her. Upon their arrival, the Porn Nazi sees the tape in the hands of Noman, dropping the tape and then running away. Regina starts humping the Porn Nazi and they go into the back room to have sex. Back in the front room, Gerry and Crammer wait in line. Noman and Regina then enter the front room, and Gorge enters with Suzanne. The four all find the video playing on the store’s television, causing a four-way argument and the four to exit the store. Elania enters the store and tells the Nazi that he has the list of new releases from his secret distributor. The film ends with another stand-up bit from Gerry about fake boobs, and [[List of Seinfeld minor characters#Characters appearing in 2 to 4 episodes|Sandra]] (Cassandra Calogera) is up on stage showing Gerry that her boobs are real. He is seen playing with her breasts for the remainder of the movie.  
A Serious Man
 In a prologue, a [[Jewish]] man in an unnamed 19th-century Eastern European [[shtetl]] tells his wife that he was helped on his way home by Reb Groshkover, whom he has invited in for soup. She says Groshkover is dead and the man he invited must be a [[dybbuk]]. Groshkover arrives and laughs off the accusation, but she plunges an ice pick into his chest. Bleeding, he exits their home into the snowy night.  In 1967, Larry Gopnik is a professor of physics living in [[St. Louis Park, Minnesota]]. His wife, Judith, tells him that she needs a [[Get (divorce document)|''get'']] so she can marry widower Sy Ableman, with whom she has fallen in love. Meanwhile, their son Danny owes twenty dollars for marijuana to an intimidating [[Hebrew school]] classmate. He has the money, but it is hidden in a transistor radio that was confiscated by his teacher. Daughter Sarah is always washing her hair and going out. Larry's brother, Arthur, sleeps on the couch and spends his free time filling a notebook with what he calls a "probability map of the universe".  Larry faces an impending vote on his application for tenure, and his department head lets slip that anonymous letters have urged the committee to deny him. Clive Park, a South Korean student worried about losing his scholarship, meets with Larry in his office to argue he should not fail the class. After he leaves, Larry finds an envelope stuffed with cash. When Larry attempts to return it, Clive's father threatens to sue Larry either for defamation if Larry accuses Clive of bribery, or for keeping the money if he does not give him a passing grade.  At the insistence of Judith and Sy, Larry and Arthur move into a nearby motel. Judith empties the couple's bank accounts, leaving Larry penniless, so he enlists the services of a divorce attorney. Larry learns Arthur faces charges of solicitation and sodomy.  Larry turns to his Jewish faith for consolation. He consults two [[rabbi]]s but his synagogue's senior rabbi, Marshak, is never available. The first, a junior rabbi, advises Larry that he lacks "perspective"; the second rabbi tells Larry a parable about a dentist. Larry and Sy are involved in separate, simultaneous car crashes. Larry is unharmed, but Sy dies. At Judith's insistence, Larry pays for Sy's funeral. At the funeral, Sy is eulogized as "a serious man".  While her husband is away on business, Larry calls on his neighbor, Vivienne Samsky, whom he has seen sunbathing naked, and she introduces him to marijuana. He later dreams that he is having sex with her, but this turns into another nightmare.  Larry is proud and moved by Danny's [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]], unaware that his son is under the influence of marijuana and unable to read the Torah. During the service, Judith apologizes to Larry for all the recent trouble and informs him that Sy liked him so much that he even wrote letters to the tenure committee. Danny meets with Marshak, in a brief encounter in which Marshak only quotes [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]," names some members of the band and returns the radio while counseling Danny to "be a good boy".  Larry's department head compliments him on Danny's Bar Mitzvah and hints that he will receive tenure. The mail brings a $3,000 bill from Arthur's lawyer. Larry decides to amend Clive's mark from F to C−, whereupon Larry's doctor calls, asking to see him immediately about the results of a chest X-ray. At the same moment, Danny's teacher struggles to open the emergency shelter as a massive tornado closes in on the school.  
Separation City
 Simon ([[Joel Edgerton]]) is a decent fellow, married to a lovely woman Pam ([[Danielle Cormack]]), living comfortably with two children. He has grown tired of the lack of sex and is attracted to a cellist friend of his wife, Katrien ([[Rhona Mitra]]).   Katrien travels to New Zealand to follow her husband Klaus ([[Thomas Kretschmann]]) in an attempt to rekindle their marriage. However, she catches him in bed with a young arts student and so their marriage collapses. Katrien, now available and lonely from the breakdown of her marriage, is susceptible to Simon's attraction.<ref></ref>   The two become fascinated with each other, but don't immediately start an affair. She doesn't want to destroy his greatest appeal, which is that he is upright and reliable. They eventually attempt some meetings, but something always goes wrong. Either he arrives late and the children are coming, or he ejaculates prematurely.   Opportunity comes when they discover that they are both going to be in Germany the same week. Simon books a hotel room in Berlin, where he and his boss are attending a convention. Katrien comes to his room, but before they manage to have sex, his wife surprises him by showing up. Katrien escapes to an adjacent room through an interconnecting door and Simon and his wife make violent love, which Katrien hears through the wall. She gets upset because they were just about to have sex and he is having sex with his wife.   Pam sees Simon sneak into the hallway during a speech and hears Katrien's voice on the other end of his phone, figures out what they are doing, and flies back to Wellington angry. She soon asks for a separation.   Simon professes his love to Katrien, but she says she doesn't love him, so he goes back to Wellington to live near to his wife and children, whom he sees often (his wife slept with Katrien's husband and wants a divorce). His wife eventually forgives him and as the movie ends, we find that Katrien has accepted a job with an orchestra and lives blocks away from her ex-husband who now takes care of the kids.  Early on in the film the five or six wives suggest that the men form an encounter group that meets regularly. At least one of the wives makes it a condition that her husband would be allowed back in the house. The discussions are amusing, but the group disbands after a session that turns into a free-for-all fist fight.  
The September Issue
 The film revolves around the making of the ''Vogue'' September 2007 issue. (The September ''Vogue'' is traditionally the biggest, most important issue of the year.)

[[Inspector Lestrade]] and the police arrest Blackwood. Three months later, Watson is engaged to [[Minor Sherlock Holmes characters#Mary Morstan (later Watson)|Mary Morstan]] and moving out of [[221B Baker Street]]; while he enjoys their adventures together, Watson looks forward to not having to deal with Holmes' eccentricities. Meanwhile, Blackwood has been sentenced to death and requests to see Holmes, whom he warns of three more unstoppable deaths that will cause great changes to the world. Blackwood is subsequently hanged.  Holmes is visited by [[Irene Adler]], a [[A Scandal in Bohemia|former adversary]] who asks him to find a missing man named Luke Reordan. After her departure, Holmes follows her as she meets with her secret employer, and only learns that the man is a professor and that he intimidates Adler. Meanwhile, sightings of a living Blackwood and the discovery of his destroyed tomb lead to belief that Blackwood has risen from the grave. Reordan is found dead inside Blackwood's coffin. Following a series of clues from the body, Holmes and Watson find Reordan's home and discover experiments attempting to merge [[Science|science]] with [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. After they survive a battle with Blackwood's men who attempt to destroy the lab, Holmes is taken to the Temple of the Four Orders, a secret magical fraternity with considerable political influence. The leaders&mdash;[[Lord Chief Justice of England|Lord Chief Justice]] Sir Thomas Rotheram, [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador]] Standish, and [[Home Secretary]] Lord Coward&mdash;ask Holmes to stop Blackwood, a former member of the society and Sir Thomas's secret illegitimate son.  That night, Sir Thomas drowns in his bath as Blackwood watches, and the next night Lord Coward calls a meeting of the Order. He nominates Blackwood to take command in place of Sir Thomas and Blackwood reveals himself to the group. Standish attempts to shoot Blackwood but is set on fire when he pulls the trigger of his gun, and runs out a window to his death. Lord Coward issues an arrest warrant for Holmes, causing him to go into hiding. Holmes studies the rituals of the Order and recognizes their symbols in Blackwood's murders that were staged at specific locations; from this he deduces the targets of the final murder are the members of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. With the aid of Lestrade, Holmes fakes arrest and is taken to see Coward, where he uses evidence on Coward's clothes to deduce Blackwood has conducted a ceremony in the sewers beneath the [[Palace of Westminster]].  Holmes escapes and he, Watson, and Adler find Blackwood's men in the sewers guarding a device based on Reordan's experiments, designed to release cyanide gas into the Parliament chambers and kill all but Blackwood's supporters, whom he has secretly given an antidote. Blackwood comes before Parliament and announces their impending deaths, then attempts to activate the cyanide device by remote control, but it is disabled by Adler. Blackwood flees Parliament and sees Adler and Holmes in the sewers, and pursues them to the top of the incomplete [[Tower Bridge]]. Blackwood fights Holmes, as the latter deduces how all of Blackwood's supposed supernatural feats were the work of science and [[Illusion|trickery]]. Blackwood plummets off the bridge and falls entangled in a noose of chains, killing him when the chain wrapped around his neck [[Hanging|hangs]] him. Adler explains to Holmes that her employer is [[Professor Moriarty]], and she warns that Moriarty is as intelligent as Holmes and far more duplicitous.  As Watson moves out of 221B, the police report to him and Holmes that a dead officer was found near Blackwood's device. Professor Moriarty used the confrontations with Adler and Blackwood as a diversion while he took a key component, based on the [[history of radio|infant science of radio]], from the machine. Holmes looks forward to the new case and new adversary.

Shank (2009 film)
 In [[Bristol]], Cal (Wayne Virgo) is a 19-year-old [[Closeted|closeted gay]] gang member who has nothing in his life except drugs, sex, random acts of violence and a secret that he keeps hidden from his mates.

Jonno, putty in Nessa's hands, can't express his own deep rooted and unrequited attachment to Cal. Manipulating situations that bring her closer to having her suspicions confirmed, Nessa sets out about dividing loyalties and encouraging conflict.  For no good reason an innocent student, Olivier (Marc Laurent), falls victim to one of her plans and is mugged on her orders by the gang. Cal steps in to restrain them and creates a distraction allowing Olivier to run free. Ignoring Nessa's screams of contempt, he chases after him and offers him a lift by way of an apology. Fearing that the fall-out from Nessa for his actions will be harsh, Cal persuades Olivier to help him out. Seizing the moral high ground and sensing that there was something more to Cal's [[Good Samaritan]] act, Olivier allows Cal to stay with him for a few days. Acting on his own attraction to Cal, Olivier seduces him and in doing so, exposes Cal to new emotions and a tenderness that he has never experienced before.  Soon, the boys are overtaken by the embrace of the first flush of love. Cal and Olivier's relationship progress, but Olivier is warned by Scott, who happens to be one of his professors, to be wary of Cal. Scott gives Olivier his phone number and tells Olivier to contact him if he is ever in need of help. Nessa can't contain her rage for Cal's disloyalty to the gang and sets about hunting him down, intent on destroying him once and for all. With her gang in tow and Jonno tightly wound up, she kidnaps Olivier, taunting Cal with video messages via her mobile phone, to come and save his boyfriend. Arriving at the abandoned factory where they are all waiting for him, he reveals that he is equally hurt by the child she lost, as he was the father. Meanwhile, Jonno and the other gang members begin to destroy Cal's car before they turn toward him. As the showdown unfolds, Nessa loses all control of events and Jonno explodes in act of sexual aggression by raping Cal and leaving everyone traumatized. Shocked by what she has witnessed, Nessa realizes she will now never be able to break the bond between Cal and Olivier while she and the other gang members flee. Olivier then contacts Scott for help and he rescues them and tends to Cal's wounds.  As the film ends Cal sends Scott a video of the man being beat up in the opening scenes of the movie, with the message "Sorry". That man turns out to be Scott's husband (they both wore wedding rings) who is still in a coma at the hospital.

Unwilling to get caught, Steelhead and the others run for their lives. In the ensuing turn of events, Steelhead saves Detective Kitano from drowning, and in gratitude, Kitano decides to stop pursuing Steelhead.

Saddened by seeing his fiancée with another man, he spends the night with Jie drinking and partying with hookers. Once sober, Steelhead decides to become a legal citizen of Japan by any means possible. Steelhead and his Chinese friends then go on an aggressive money laundering operation, but leave Jie out of it due to his kind hearted nature. Unfortunately, Taiwanese triad leader Gao ([[Jack Kao]]) discovers one of his pachinko machines has been tampered with (fixed by Steelhead's group) and vows to punish the culprit. Jie gets caught playing the violence tampered pachinko machine and is taken to a dark alleyway where Gao slices Jie's face and cuts off his right hand while trying to get information. Upon learning that Jie is held by the Taiwanese gang, Steelhead and the rest of their group go and collect Jie.  Full of anger and pity for Jie's fate, Steelhead sneaks inside Gao's establishment and hides to take revenge, but instead learns of the plot between the Togawa group (rival "allies") and Gao to kill Eguchi. Eguchi, unaware of the plot, arrives at Gao's. Just as Gao is about to kill Eguchi, Steelhead saves him by chopping off Gao's arm with his machete and the two run for their lives. They successfully escape their pursuers and Steelhead is welcomed to the Eguchi estate to recover.  Steelhead has the chance to catch up with Xiu-Xiu as Eguchi gives them a moment to speak to each other. Steelhead learns that Eguchi and Xiu-Xiu have a little girl, Ayako. Xiu-Xiu tells him that her name is now Yuko and that she is happy with her new life. Eguchi returns and offers Steelhead a high paying job, which he refuses.  Later, Eguchi tries unsuccessfully to expose Togawa for the attempted assassination, but their boss makes Eguchi apologize for the accusations instead.  Eguchi then asks Steelhead to be a hitman. Steelhead agrees, under two conditions: he'll take control of Gao's territories and legally become a citizen of Japan. Steelhead kills all of his targets, which results in a gang war within the Yakuza ranks; Steelhead and Eguchi get what they wanted. Eguchi is promoted after Togawa and Steelhead become a vassal under Eguchi with Gao's territories.  Steelhead does everything to make a better life for his Chinese ''brothers,'' but has no interest in the daily operations of Yakuza activity. He leaves all the daily operations to his ''brothers'' as he starts a successful tractor business. Sometime later, Detective Kitano meets with Steelhead and warns him that all of his ''brothers'' have become corrupted. Kitano tells Steelhead that he would be arrested along with his friends, with him charged as the head conspirator. Steelhead makes a deal with Kitano: Steelhead would find evidence to have Eguchi arrested in exchange for his comrades' freedom.  That fateful night, Steelhead and Kitano return to the vassal HQ to warn his comrades about their impending arrest if they don't stop their operation and is met with furious opposition. His ''brothers'' violently refuse to give up their rich lives they made with the Yakuza. Eguchi arrives just as Steelhead is stabbed by one of his "brothers". Meanwhile, the Yakuza can't tolerate Eguchi's leadership anymore. Gao, Nakajima (Eguchi's former subordinate), and Togawa's son agree to take Eguchi down the same night.  Waves of Yakuza storm into the building and proceed to kill everyone, leaving only Eguchi, Steelhead, and Kitano to survive the onslaught. Mortally wounded, Eguchi gives Steelhead a flash drive that contains data on the Yakuza operations. As Kitano and Steelhead escape out of the building, the police arrive and arrest the Yakuza. Steelhead calls Yuko to meet in Okubo station, along with Ayako, but Togawa has already taken Ayako hostage and forces Yuko to tell him where Steelhead is headed. Nakajima intercepts Steelhead; the police arrive in time and exchange gunfire with Nakajima and his men. Nakajima shoots Steelhead, but is then gunned down by Kitano. Steelhead, still alive, flees into the sewers. Kitano follows and finds him being swept away by sewage currents and tries to pull him out, but Steelhead tells him it is useless and Kitano does not know how to swim. Steelhead gives the flash drive to Kitano before the current sweeps his body away, calling his debt to Kitano repaid while remembering how happy it was when he was with his comrades in simpler times.

When Tomás finds out, he tries to stop Alec, blaming him for Maire's death, and runs away to Katie's. She explains how sad Alec is about losing Maire. The next day, Tomás goes to feed Smudge, asking it to pass on a message to Maire, asking her 'what he should to do'.

That night, Derek returns home to his Grandma's ([[Maxine Miller]]) house, whom the family have moved in with after the death of their dad. Derek's mom ([[Wendy Anderson]]) urges Derek to set a good example for Tobey. The next morning, Derek voices his annoyance of having to move to a new town again. While at school, Derek makes a move on Christy before he is approached by Taylor (Josh Emerson) who has heard about the dead dog on the shortcut. Taylor tells him his dog has gone missing and believes the old man has killed his dog. The pair makes an arrangement to go to the shortcut that night together.  After dinner, Derek asks his Grandma about the shortcut, she warns him never to go there. Derek's mom then tells him that the old man on the shortcut is the last living member of the Hartley family who she thinks "just wants to be left alone." Taylor arrives and he and Derek go to the shortcut. They come out at the old man's house and sneak into his garage where they find dog collars, but none of the collars belong to Taylor's dog. The old man appears and they flee.   The following day, the group become determined to prove the old man is killing dogs. Derek and Lisa attempt to go back to the house, however, their plan is foiled when the old man does not leave his house. Later, at work, Derek is startled to see the old man. Derek is unable to determine if he recognizes him from the night before and he leaves soon after. Christy then arrives and also spots the old man. Derek manages to get an intrigued Christy's number so she can help with the investigation. After she leaves, Derek witnesses Mark being attacked and murdered, however, it's revealed this was a prank.  The next day, at Derek's house, Mark, Lisa and Taylor have met up with Derek. Taylor tells them that a friend's dog has also gone missing and that the old man is a veteran so he spends every Friday night at the memorial hall. Derek and Christy plan to spy on the old man at the memorial hall while the others go to investigate his house. Tobey then enters and Lisa teases him before leaving.  At the memorial hall, Derek and Christy bond before they make out and then realize that the old man has arrived. Derek phones the others to go to the house. Mark, Lisa and Taylor go through the shortcut and break into the old man's house. Mark and Lisa find a room where Benjamin was presumably home-schooled. Mark and Taylor then go into the basement. Meanwhile, Christy and Derek realize the old man is leaving and they cannot get the others on the phone. Realizing they must beat the old man back to the house, they quickly begin to drive to the house. In the basement, Mark and Taylor discover an old man ([[William B. Davis]]), Benjamin, shackled to a large wheel by a chain that is padlocked around his neck. Benjamin pleads for them to help him before the old man arrives back home. Lisa, Mark and Taylor take Benjamin and depart the house, but Benjamin is still bound. As they reach the shortcut, the chain restricts him from moving further. Taylor grabs a sledgehammer to break the chain while Benjamin and Mark hold the chain tight. As Taylor swings the sledgehammer, Benjamin yanks the chain, bringing Mark's hand in line with the swing, horribly disfiguring it. As Lisa attempts to get a signal on her phone to call help, Taylor tends to Mark. Suddenly, Benjamin hits Taylor over the head with the sledgehammer, killing him. Mark attempts to crawl away, but he too is killed with the sledgehammer. Lisa runs away as Benjamin manages to break the chain.   Derek and Christy arrive at the house and find a distraught Lisa who warns them they need to leave. Just then, the old man, revealed to be Ivor, arrives and crashes into the back of Derek and Christy's car and then tries to shoot them. Derek and Christy then flee the car and head for the forest as Lisa is shot in the leg. Derek urges Christy to escape, while he helps Lisa to run. As Christy runs deeper into the forest, she becomes lost. Suddenly she is attacked by Benjamin. As Derek and Lisa run through the forest, they fall into a pit of bones. Derek manages to climb out, but is unable to help Lisa out as Ivor arrives. Lisa hides under the bones but is spotted, and as she is about to be shot, Derek knocks out Ivor, allowing Lisa to escape. Again running through the forest, the two stumble upon Benjamin who has captured Christy and has her bound by the neck with the remaining length of chain that is also still attached to his neck. Derek attempts to save her, but Benjamin breaks Christy's neck, killing her. Derek attacks Benjamin and is stabbed in the side while doing so. Derek quickly finds the sledgehammer and braces himself to hit Benjamin. Before Derek can hit Benjamin, Ivor turns up, he warns Derek not to hit Benjamin, and as Derek is about to, Ivor shoots Benjamin, while saying "he can no longer deal with having to hide Benjamin and kill anyone who happens to see him." Ivor then shoots himself, allowing Derek and Lisa to make their way out of the forest. Lisa becomes unable to walk due to her injury and Derek checks on it. As they are about to continue on, Lisa is stabbed to death by Tobey. Derek is shocked at first but then says he is disappointed in his brother for allowing this to happen again, and reveals that Tobey murdered their father. The two brothers then begin to drag Lisa's body into the forest. Derek reassures Tobey they will be able to cover up her death, possibly implying that they both will follow the same legend that Ivor and Benjamin did.

He smokes [[marijuana]] at home, in his car and behind his office, when not seeing patients. Carter routinely drinks himself to sleep around his house, waking up in his clothes and never enters his bedroom. Despite his own problems, Carter continues psychotherapy with his patients, maintaining his incisiveness, compassion and strong [[doctor-patient relationship]]s.  Around some of Carter's patients, Patrick ([[Dallas Roberts]]) is a high-powered [[talent agent]] who is both [[narcissistic]] and anxiety- ridden, with a germ phobia, Seamus ([[Jack Huston]]) is an actor addicted to various drugs and alcohol, and one of Patrick's biggest clients, Seamus is not one of Carter's patients, but they share a drug-dealer named Jesus ([[Jesse Plemons]]). Jack Holden ([[Robin Williams]]) is another popular celebrity with a drinking problem, about which he is in denial. He continues therapy, however, because he believes that he has a sex addiction. Kate ([[Saffron Burrows]]) is an actress in her thirties, who is intelligent, compassionate and poised, but is facing fewer career opportunities because of Patrick's notion that her age is a limitation. Her rock-star husband, who she says "wasn't always like this," is self-centered and cheating on her. Carter's newest patient, Jemma ([[Keke Palmer]]) is a troubled high-school student, who is required to see a therapist by her school, after cutting her hand by punching a mirror. She is referred to Carter by his father as a pro bono case because like Carter's wife, Jemma's mother committed suicide. Jemma is an avid moviegoer who aspires to become a filmmaker.  Carter has few friends, and spends time with Jesus, his quirky pot dealer. Carter also socializes with Jeremy ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]) to whom he is loosely related through Carter's deceased wife, whose mother was Jeremy's godmother. Jeremy is a struggling young screenwriter who finds romantic interest in Patrick's assistant Daisy ([[Pell James]]). Jeremy also derives creative inspiration from Jemma. Jeremy secretly steals Jemma's private file from Carter's office and pursues a [[Platonic love|platonic]] interest in Jemma. He writes his breakthrough [[screenplay]] about Jemma, and with Daisy's help, Jeremy succeeds in gaining Patrick's interest in the screenplay.  Carter suffers a breakdown on a live television talk show, alarming the host ([[Gore Vidal]]) and the viewers when he states publicly for the first time that his wife committed suicide. He denounces his book as "bullshit" and himself as a fraud, and storms off of the set. Jemma, Daisy and Jeremy react to Carter's on-air outburst. Carter decides to stop treating Jemma, though he begins helping Jemma finally come to terms with her mother's suicide.    Jemma discovers the screenplay and feels betrayed by Jeremy. Carter angrily attacks Jeremy for his deception, but accepts his own professional responsibility in the situation, which he unknowingly allowed. Later, Carter and Jeremy are mysteriously invited to a meeting at Patrick's office. Patrick seats them in a conference room, where Jemma is already waiting. To their surprise, Jemma now approves of Jeremy's screenplay. Patrick announces that he will be representing Jemma and making Jeremy's screenplay into a movie. Carter, having disposed of his drug supply, approaches Kate at home. He tells her he doesn't want to see her anymore "...professionally," implying his interest in seeing her romantically. She smiles.  That night, Carter enters his bedroom, wearing pajamas. He momentarily regards his former marital bed, before climbing into it and turning off the light.

Sikandar (2009 film)
 Sikandar Raza (Parzan Dastur) is a 14-year-old schoolboy in the Kashmir valley. Ever since his parents were killed by jihadis (from Pak Occupied Kashmir) (militants) 10 years ago, he has lived with his aunt and uncle, in a small town called Kupwara in Kashmir valley. All Sikandar’s desires revolve around the happiness of his foster parents and getting the ball into the goal on the football field.  One day, on his way to a school football match, Sikandar finds a gun lying on the path. Despite admonishments by his newly made school friend, 14-year-old Nasreen (Ayesha Kapoor), Sikandar picks up the gun and begins a journey into the darker side of his nature. The quiet-yet-strong Nasreen becomes Sikandar’s conscience keeper. She tries to dissuade him from giving in to the lure of the gun.  Sikandar gets embroiled further and further in situations beyond his control, and people get killed. At first it seems that the happenings occurring alongside Sikandar’s predicament are not connected. But, as layer upon layer is revealed, it becomes clear that Sikandar is the innocent victim in a game being played out between the militants, the army, the peace-bartering politicians and the religious heads of the little Kashmiri town. The pieces of the puzzle come together at the very end, leading to a shocking revelation.  The movie is a portrayal of how child psychologies can be moulded, how terrorists are made.

Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another.  Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential [[illegal immigrants]] stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a [[Honduras|Honduran]] family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in [[New Jersey]]. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off.  Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping. Unbeknownst to Casper, Sayra follows him off the train. Meanwhile, her father and uncle decide to continue the journey.  Traveling north on a car transport organized by a friend of Casper, Casper and Sayra barely escape a trap laid for them and enter an immigrant shelter, where Sayra sees a familiar face. She is informed that her father has died and her uncle has been caught. In disbelief, she rushes off to cry at the chapel, where Casper comforts her. They reach a river that constitutes the border to the United States. A [[People smuggler|coyote]] agrees to take them across one by one. Casper pays the man with his camera containing the cherished pictures of his murdered girlfriend and insists that Sayra go first. When she is halfway across, the gang appears and begins to chase Casper. Casper flees the pursuing gang but runs into Smiley, who shoots him once, then slowly two more times, the last of which in the head. This allows time for the others to catch up. They then all proceed to empty their magazines into Casper in an execution style killing, while Sayra struggles to hold on to the raft and screams in horror.  The closing scenes show Sayra phoning her father's new family from outside an American mall, her uncle setting off on another attempt to cross the border, and Smiley getting his lip tattooed as a sign of his loyalty to the gang.

His friend and partner at the law firm Sully ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] when they visit the home and warns Bryan not to enter the closet behind the cross. He recovers having no recollection of saying this. Wanting a separation from his wife to "scare her" into accepting his behavior, Bryan decides to spend a few weeks at his aunt's home. While he is there several strange occurrences are ignored by him that might hint at haunting behavior; a chest in the upstairs bedroom falls unaided, a large shrine is found in the closet behind a [[crucifix]], and the house is filled with strange unexplained noises and glimpses of what appears to be a woman.  Bryan learns that the house was willed to an institute that studies [[sleep disorder]]s. Upon investigation, the director Koven shows him another department that deals with [[psychic]] energy for scientific research. Though he maintains that they do not believe in the [[paranormal]], Bryan decides to contest the will. But the sounds of whispering about an old trunk send him back. After Koven discounts his theories of voices in his house, Bryan goes to his [[psychiatrist]] Shepard ([[Edward Herrmann]]) who decides that Bryan's stress-induced [[insomnia]] is to blame. The visions become more vivid, and Cassie ([[Zoe Saldana]]) a psychic specimen of Koven's arrives to scan the house. She comes to several conclusions that Bryan had not disclosed, and the strange sound of someone falling down a flight of stairs that only he can hear clearly disturbs him. While going through an old trunk he found in the basement, Bryan and Cassie come across a doll that absolutely terrifies him into an emotional outrage. The next day, he begins to sense recurring memories of [[Child abuse|his mother abusing him]] and locking him in the same closet that seems to be the source of the hauntings. Shepard confirms this, and allows Bryan to remember that as a five-year-old, due to the harsh treatment by his mother, he consciously placed toys on the stairs, causing her to fall down them to her death. Shepard and Bryan's father used Bryan's [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]] to make him forget about the event entirely. This makes Bryan realize that it is the ghost of his mother haunting the house.  He returns to his aunt's home, but decides against going in. He sees Cassie's car parked in the driveway and calls her from outside the house but he is unable to reach her, so he enters the home searching for her. He calls her cell phone again and she answers. He asks why she left her car in the driveway and she says she didn't. He looks out the window and finds that her car is not there. Bryan realizes that his mother tricked him to get him in the house. A now angry Bryan, storms from the room and finds his mother's body lying on the floor at the foot of the stairs. The shock causes him to faint and he falls down the stairs, landing where his mother had died. As his mother touches his face, he receives a vision of the picnic he had missed on the day before her death, when she had locked him in the closet for leaving a sock on the floor when he cleaned his room. It is implied in this vision, that she is apologizing to him for her deeds; then all goes dark and Bryan finds himself at the foot of the stairs as the screen goes dark.  
Skull Heads
 The film begins with Naomi Arkoff ([[Robin Sydney]]) being taken by her father Carver Arkoff ([[Steve Kramer (actor)|Steve Kramer]]) into the basement of their castle home in [[Rome, Italy]], where there lies a [[rack (torture device)|rack]]. Carver ties Naomi to both ends of the rack and turns the wheel, hurting her. Carver claims that her punishment ''this'' time is for having a cell phone, which was against the father's wishes. After begging her father to let her go, Carver unties her, but warns her that the next time she has a cellphone in the house, her punishment is not going to be slow and painful. As she gets released, she runs off upstairs, strangely screaming: "I can run faster than you!" over and over again.  The next afternoon, Carver comes downstairs into the dining room to be questioned by his wife Lisbeth (Samantha Light) about what he did to Naomi the previous night. They then encourage Carver's half brother Peter (Giacomo Gonnella), who is mentally retarded, to have lunch with them, where Carver tells Peter that the lamb that they're eating was Sophia, who Peter had grown an affection with. When Naomi comes downstairs and finds out what's up, she gives her toy animal of a horse to him, which appears to cheer him up. Later, Lisbeth takes a tray of food upstairs to her father, who throughout the entire film has his face not seen. Lisbeth then continues to read [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "From Childhood's Hour" to him. Afterward, she alerts him that his guardian angels are in the room to protect him, which are shown to be small little creatures with big skull heads.  Lisbeth then goes to check on Naomi and Naomi tells her that she wants to go away to college because she wants to be able to get out and meet people and do exciting things. Lisbeth, however, tells her the story of Naomi's grandmother, who ran away when Lisbeth was a baby to go see the circus and never came back. When Lisbeth then became a teenager, the circus came back into town and when she went to see it, she saw her mom in the circus act performing acrobatics on a wire. The moral is, that if Naomi leaves, she might never come back to see her father and mother just like her grandmother did. Lisbeth suddenly finds an [[iPod]] underneath Naomi's pillow. But after finding out how useful it can be, she allows Naomi to keep it unless she doesn't have her father see it.  The next morning, Claudia (Lucia Stara), the Arkoffs' maid, opens the two double doors that lead outside of the castle to be greeted by three people: Kimi (Kim Argetsinger), L.J. (Antonio Covatta) and Jensen (Rane Jameson), who claim that they are Hollywood Producers looking for a place to shoot a couple scenes for a spy/war movie they're doing. Before shutting the door in their faces, Naomi quickly invites them in so she can finally meet new people, but the opportunity is ruined when Carver comes outside and insults the trio, forcing them to leave, not before Kimi hands Carver her card in case anyone changes their mind. Carver then tears up the card, and throws it down, telling Uncle Peter to escort the trio out. Meanwhile, Naomi gathers up the card. Later on that day, Naomi sneaks a cell phone away from one of the water delivery boys and calls the number on the card so they can come over for dinner that night.  That night, after finally calming her father down about having guests over, everyone finally settles down for a lovely meal until they hear something. The family explains that it's the "protectors" A.K.A.: Grandpa's Guardian Angels. Lisbeth explains that the Romans used to bury the dead in underground catacombs, and it is believed that a couple of tombs are buried beneath the castle. Back when the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Vandals]] sacked Rome, they violated the catacombs searching for valuables, hence why the castle was constructed above the burial grounds. The so-called "Protectors" in the castle are called ''Skull Heads'', creatures born from witchcraft that were placed in the castle to protect the dead from any such type of violation for the past 200 years. it's also believed that they have the power to have control on the living and the dead.  After the grand tour of the castle, the film crew leave and it's revealed that they're not really Hollywood filmmakers, but really art thieves, and after viewing the castle, they plan on robbing the place the next night. The next morning, Carver tells Naomi that the breakfast that she has just received is the only thing she's eating because she's going to be put back on the rack later on. As he heads downstairs, he finds Peter trying to stick his penis in Claudia's crack. He quickly beats Peter out of the room, but then forces Claudia to keep her pants down as he unzips his pants zipper. Later that night, Kimi, L.J. and Jensen sneak into the house and start stealing items.  Meanwhile, Jensen finds Naomi tied up on the rack in the basement and just as they're about to escape, they run into Carver and Lisbeth. As they fight between the right decision for Naomi, Lisbeth explains why the family always sticks together and why they act strange (especially Naomi): Naomi is not only Carver and Lisbeth's daughter, but she's their niece and Carver and Lisbeth are not really husband and wife, they're really brother and sister. The reason Naomi is a little bit retarded is because of being an [[inbred]] and confused about who she really is. Suddenly, Lisbeth gets shot in the back and Carver, at the same time, gets shot in the chest by Kimi, who then forces Jensen and Naomi back into the basement.<ref>[http://www.enghenhac.com/movies/new-releases/skull-heads.html Skull Heads Movie, New Releases Films]</ref>  Kimi tricks Naomi into tying Jensen to the rack, for betraying his partner. Kimi then presses an button, which causes the rack to run automatically instead of manually. Kimi then locks Naomi in a trap where she can't move and continues to find L.J., who had just been knocked out by Peter. L.J. and Kimi then continue to grab the rest of the stuff they wanted. Meanwhile, the ''Skull Heads'' find the bodies of Carver and Lisbeth and with their power, they bring them back alive as zombies and have them go after the thieves. Carver and Lisbeth corner L.J. and Kimi at the castle's doors and they start eating off their faces, spraying blood all over the walls.<ref>[http://planetofterror.blogspot.com/2009/10/skull-heads-2009.html PLANET OF TERROR!!: Skull Heads (2009)]</ref>  Meanwhile, Peter comes into the basement, releases Naomi and quickly save Jensen's life. As Naomi and Jensen are about to escape, Naomi quickly runs back upstairs to get her grandfather and Jensen finds something shocking: Naomi's grandfather has been dead for quite a while. Those who were shown talking with the grandfather were really talking to themselves. Suddenly, his body rises up and surprises Jensen, revealing one of the ''Skull Heads'' controlling his body. Jensen runs back downstairs, grabs Kimi's gun, shoots at Carver and Lisbeth near the exit (which has no anvil) and quickly runs outside, shutting the doors behind him. Just as he thinks it's all over, a screaming Naomi opens the doors, grabs Jensen and pulls him back in, slamming the doors behind her, leaving the fate of Jensen unknown.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/features/21-fearful-features/4071-boning-up-on-skull-heads.html Boning Up on SKULL HEADS] </ref>

Skeleton Crew (film)
  In the 1970s, a mental institution near the border of [[Russia]] and [[Finland]] was shut down when it was discovered that main administrator Doctor Andersson (who had taken to calling himself "[[Auteur theory|The Auteur]]") had filmed himself torturing patients to death. Most of the doctor's films were confiscated, though the rooms in which they were developed and screened were never found.  Around thirty years later, the asylum is being used as the set of ''Silent Creek'', a film based on the murders committed in it. While doing recordings, two soundmen hear disembodied voices, and find a hidden room. The chamber contains Andersson's undiscovered work, and while the bulk of the cast and crew of ''Silent Creek'' are disgusted by the [[snuff film]]s, they decide not to call the police, since doing so would shut down production. Steven, the director of ''Silent Creek'', becomes obsessed with Andersson's films (which he is drawn to one night by an apparition) and begins acting deranged, claiming that ''Silent Creek'' is "not real enough".  After finding Andersson's camera among the snuff films, Steve tricks Bruce (the actor playing Andersson) into killing an actress with a drill (which he said was just a prop) while he films it. The next day, the rest of the cast and crew find a note on Andersson's projector telling them to turn it on. The projector shows Steven (dressed like Andersson) disemboweling Mari while ranting about how he is "The Auteur". Steven then cuts a restrained Bruce in half with a chainsaw, which is shown through a television in the break room. Since the telephones and vehicles all fail to work, the remaining employees decide to make a run for it, after they look for the missing Mike. During the search, Klasu is taken after drinking drugged liquor.  In the previously sealed attic the rest of the group find a [[Moviola]] showing ''Skeleton Crew'' itself, everything up until that very moment. As everyone theorizes that it is like reality itself has become blurred and they are inside a horror film, the machinery shows Klasu in a pit with Mike. Steven throws two spiked clubs into the hole, and has Klasu and Mike fight for their freedom. The former wins, but Steven goes back on his word, and burns Klasu to death with spotlights. The next to die is Erno, who is locked in the attic and bombarded with sound, causing a fatal aneurysm.  While he, Lisa, and Anna are looking for another way out due to the main doors being sealed, Darius is captured, strung up, and impaled by a spear attached to a camera set on a [[Camera dolly|dolly]]. Steven then takes Anna, severs her right arm and left leg, and leaves her for Lisa to find. Anna begs for death, and Lisa comes close to mercy killing her, but upon realizing that this scenario is almost an exact recreation of the opening of ''Silent Creek'', fakes passing out. When an angered Steven approaches her, Lisa shoots him several times with a dead crew member's gun. Steven survives being shot, and upon realizing he cannot be killed due to the supernatural presence in the asylum, Lisa shoots herself in the mouth to spite Steve and ruin his film. However, Lisa survives the suicide attempt, and wakes up tied to chair, with Steven about to torture her with a blowtorch.  In a post-credits scene, Steven is shown watching ''Skeleton Crew'' in a theatre. A viewer yells out "Ah, mate, that really sucked. Weren't even any fucking tits!"

The Sniper (2009 film)
 Hartman Fong (Richie Jen) succeeds Shane (Bowie Lam) as the leader of Hong Kong's [[Special Duties Unit]] Sniper Team. Hartman who is by-the-book and hierarchical, got the job despite being the second best shooter in team history. The best was Hartman's former teammate Lincoln (Huang Xiaoming), whose unorthodox methods and confidence makes him arrogant and disdainful of authority. Hartman and Lincoln are two alpha males with a long-running rivalry, with only room at the top for one sharpshooter.  Lincoln however was dismissed and jailed for accidentally killing a hostage (the son of the bank chairman) during a bank robbery committed by crime boss Tao (Jack Kao). Lincoln maintained in defense that Tao was about to pull the pin of a grenade but no one else on the Sniper Team could support his story, indeed there is a feeling that Hartman (who was the only other person who could have been in a position to see Tao with the grenade) may have withheld key evidence that would have exonerated Lincoln. Back to the present, upon his release from prison after a four-year stint, Lincoln still harbors a grudge against his former SDU teammates despite being welcomed back into society by Shane. Within days Lincoln has purchased an illegal sniper rifle. He also rekindles his relationship with his wife Crystal (Mango Wong) who encourages him to seek revenge, after they view the wedding ring in the aquarium.  In a flashback, there are two rookie cops getting involved in criminal shootout. One of them is OJ, who manages to stay calm and kills a criminal. Lincoln sees potential in this youngster and decides to take him under his wing. Yet when OJ becomes fascinated by Lincoln and determines to top his shooting skills, he becomes another wild card on the loose. OJ's unorthodox means leads him into frequent conflicts with Hartman's rigid authoritarian style.  Within a few days of being a free man, Lincoln helps crime boss Tao escape prisoner transfer convoy. An off-duty Hartman witnesses the incident, killing several of Tao's men but unable to prevent them from breaking their boss free, after Lincoln tips him off to the crime's location as kind of a "ha ha, I'm helping the bad guys," taunt. Ming and his team are dispatched to profile the suspect. OJ (Edison Chen), the hot-headed rookie on the team, surprises everyone by accurately replicating the suspect’s impossible shots. He manages to do this because of advice from Lincoln.  As Hartman investigates the suspect, he inadvertently runs into crime boss Tao and his henchmen in the elevator of an apartment building. Hartman manages to kill one of the criminals but while chasing after Tao he is foiled by Lincoln. Hartman then pursues Lincoln to the roof and Lincoln loses his grip on a rope and falls down. Tao escapes but his right-hand man is cornered by police, so he flees into a restaurant and takes hostages. Hartman, now in the police command van, coordinates his sniper team but only OJ has a good shot. Although Hartman's order is "shoot to kill", OJ instead wounds the criminal in the arm holding the gun. Although the hostage situation has been resolved without loss of innocent life, Hartman and OJ have a heated argument over the disobeyed order, with OJ arguing that this allowed for the mobster's capture so the case can be further investigated.  Later it is revealed Lincoln has survived the fall with no major injuries and continues his plan of revenge and kidnaps Shane, who is Lincoln's last friend and supporter from the SDU. While Lincoln and Crystal make conversation, Shane regains consciousness and reminds him that Crystal is dead and it is revealed that Lincoln has been hallucinating all this time. In a fit of rage, Lincoln takes his rifle and fires at the ghosts of Hartman and the bank chairman's son, before realizing that he has inadvertently killed Shane. A flashback shows Crystal visiting Lincoln in prison, but he tells her to go away. Crystal then returns home and drops the wedding ring into the aquarium. Standing out on the balcony of her apartment looking at a photo of them in happier times, a wind blows away the photo, and as she lunges for it she tumbles over the railing and falls to her death (likely a suicide).<ref></ref>  In the ending, Lincoln decides to lure Fong and the SDU sniper team into a trap at an auto scrap warehouse, leading to the ultimate showdown amongst three expert snipers. First Lincoln forces the crime boss Tao reenact the bank robbery hostage taking, and unlike four years ago, this time Lincoln successfully kills Tao and saves the hostage. In the final gun battle, most of Hartman's team is wounded or killed, but Hartman volunteers to sacrifice himself and draw Lincoln's fire, allowing OJ to kill Lincoln and become the best sniper in the SDU.

Later, Sota returns to the pond with the circus clown. Sota offers to paint a picture of him, but the clown refuses and advises Sota to paint whatever his heart desires. He decides to paint Sayo playing the piano after he watches Sayo play the "[[Suite bergamasque|Clair de lune]]". To save money for the painting paper, Sota goes hungry and eats just a few grains of rice each day. Sota's grandfather dies, and after the funeral, Sota goes to the circus to find solace in the circus clown, only to discover that the circus has moved away.

 In 2005, Steve Lopez is a journalist working for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. He is divorced and now works for his ex-wife, Mary, an editor. A biking accident lands Lopez in a hospital.  One day, he hears a violin being played beautifully. Investigating, he encounters Nathaniel Ayers, a homeless man with [[schizophrenia]], who is playing a violin when Lopez introduces himself. During the conversation that follows, Lopez learns that Ayers once attended [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]].  Curious as to how a former student of such a prestigious school ended up on the streets, Lopez contacts Juilliard but learns that no record of Ayers graduating from it exists. Though at first figuring a man with schizophrenia who's talented with a cello isn't worth his time, Lopez soon realizes that he has no better story to write about. Luckily, he soon learns that Ayers ''did'' attend Juilliard, but dropped out after two years.  Finding Ayers the next day, Lopez says he wants to write about him. Ayers doesn't appear to be paying attention. Getting nowhere, Lopez finds and contacts Ayers' sister, who gives the columnist the information he needs: Ayers was once a [[child prodigy]] with the cello, until he began displaying symptoms of schizophrenia at Juilliard. Unable to handle the voices, Ayers dropped out and ended up on the streets due to the delusion that his sister wanted to kill him. Without a cello, he has resorted to playing a two-string violin.  Lopez writes his article. One reader is so touched that she sends him a cello for Ayers. Lopez brings it to him and Ayers shows he is just as proficient as with a violin. Unfortunately, his tendency to wander puts both Ayers and the cello in danger, so Lopez talks him into leaving it at a shelter, located in a neighborhood of homeless people. Ayers is later seen playing for the homeless.  A concerned Lopez tries to get a doctor he knows to help. He also tries to talk Ayers into getting an apartment, but Ayers refuses. After seeing a reaction to music played at an opera house, Lopez persuades another friend, Graham, a cellist, to rehabilitate Ayers through music. The lessons go well, though Ayers is shown to be getting a little too attached to Lopez, much to the latter's annoyance. Lopez eventually talks Ayers into moving into an apartment by threatening to abandon him.  Through Lopez's article on Ayers, Ayers gains so much fame that he is given the chance to perform a recital. Sadly, he loses his temper, attacks Graham, and leaves. This convinces Lopez's doctor friend to get Ayers help. But when Ayers learns what Lopez is up to, he throws Lopez out of his apartment and threatens to kill him.  While speaking with Mary, Lopez realizes that not only has he changed Ayers' life, but Ayers has changed him. Determined to make amends, Lopez brings Ayers' sister to L.A. for a visit. Ayers and Lopez make up. Later, while all watch an orchestra, Lopez ponders how beneficial their friendship has been. Ayers still hears voices, but at least he no longer lives on the streets. In addition, Ayers has helped improve Lopez's relationship with his own family.  It is revealed at the end that Ayers is still a member of the [[LAMP Community]] – a Los Angeles nonprofit organization that seeks to help people living with severe mental illness – and that Lopez is learning how to play the guitar.  
Solomon Kane (film)
 The film opens in North Africa, 1600, with the [[Kingdom of England|English]] mercenary Solomon Kane as he leads his ship's crew into battle against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupiers of a fortress town. After defeating the defenders, Kane and his men raid the fortress, where most of the crew are killed by demons. Kane fights his way to the throne room, but, before he can loot the riches, he is confronted by a demon named the Devil's Reaper who tells him his soul is forfeit to Satan. Solomon rejects his fate and jumps out a window to escape. Following this encounter, Solomon returns to England and finds sanctuary in a monastery. After a prophetic dream, the abbot apologetically expels Kane, and Kane travels by foot to his ancestral estate, from which he had been expelled in his youth after defying his father. Along the way, he is ambushed by robbers who mock his vow of pacifism and leave him for dead. He is found and treated by the Crowthorns, a family of [[Puritans]] traveling west to the New World. When the Crowthorns are slaughtered by corrupted followers of the evil [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] Malachi, Kane renounces his vows and swears to avenge their deaths and rescue Meredith Crowthorn, who has been marked by a witch and kidnapped by the Masked Rider, Malachi's lieutenant.  Kane battles Malachi's followers across the countryside, rescuing many captives but not finding Meredith. On his journey, he meets a deranged priest who explains Malachi's followers are taking the weaker survivors of their raids as slaves and corrupting the strong into soldiers. The priest tries to feed Kane to his parishioners, who have become ghouls, but Kane escapes, only to face the robbers who attacked him earlier, now corrupted servants of Malachi. He kills two of the robbers and interrogates the survivor, who tells Solomon that Meredith is dead. Kane throws the robber to the ghouls, and, believing his quest for redemption has failed, drinks to excess at a country inn. Former shipmates recognise him and try to recruit him as a leader of a resistance against Malachi, but Kane refuses. Malachi's followers attack the inn at dawn and crucify the leaders of the resistance, including Kane. As Kane hangs on the cross, Meredith cries out his name from her cage in the back of the raiders' wagon; Kane realises that he still has a chance to save her and pulls himself free. Before Malachi's remaining men can finish him, they are killed by survivors of the resistance, who take Kane to safety. Kane is healed by an old witch and is soon anxious to confront the raiders.  The resistance explain Malachi's background as a former healer who made a bargain with the Devil, and reveal that he now lives in Kane's ancestral home. Kane leads them into the castle via an underground passage, and, as the resistance fights Malachi's soldiers, Kane heads for the dungeons and frees many of the captives. There he finds not Meredith but his father, who explains that the Masked Rider is Kane's older brother Marcus, whom Kane thought he had accidentally killed after his banishment. Instead, Marcus was critically injured, and, when healers failed to revive him, his father turned to Malachi. Disfigured and turned to Malachi's will, Marcus became the Masked Rider. Solomon reluctantly acquiesces to his father's request and kills him, then heads to the throne room to confront Malachi. There, Kane finds Meredith in a cage, and as she warns him of a trap, Marcus stabs him in the back. Kane tries to reason with Marcus, but they engage in a duel; Kane wins after setting Marcus on fire and decapitating him. Malachi uses Meredith's blood to release a demon sent to claim Kane's soul, but Kane shoots Malachi dead and sacrifices himself to close the portal. Meredith believes Kane to be dead, but he awakens and explains that he has finally redeemed his soul. Kane reunites Meredith with her remaining family and buries his father and brother. In a final voice-over, he declares his intention to roam the Earth and oppose the forces of darkness.

Solitary Man (film)

About six years later, Ben's fortunes have drastically changed. He is taking oral medications but never got the prescribed heart tests, and his lost sense of "immortality" has sent him on a self-destructive binge: habitual lying, inappropriate sexual affairs, divorce, and bad business decisions that nearly put him in prison. He is broke, borrowing money from his daughter Susan ([[Jenna Fischer]]), and still unwilling to accept his age, ignoring his heart problem, and has a serial sexual appetite.  Ben, who cheated often on his wife Nancy Kalmen ([[Susan Sarandon]]), accompanies Allyson ([[Imogen Poots]]), the 18-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, Jordan Karsch ([[Mary-Louise Parker]]), to her college interview at a Boston college campus where Ben is an alumnus, having been a prominent donor during his more prosperous days. On campus, Ben meets an impressionable student named Daniel ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) who appreciates his wisdom and advice. Later that night, Ben and Allyson sleep together.   Back in New York, Ben expresses a desire to continue the relationship, which Allyson dismisses as a one time experiment with an older man, in her words, crossing "the Daddy" fantasy off her "list". Frustrated with Ben and her own mother, Allyson dismissively tells her mother about the sexual encounter. Jordan is incensed and breaks off contact with Ben. She then withdraws the support Ben needs to open a new auto dealership. While discussing his overdue rent with his building manager ([[Lenny Venito]]), his daughter Susan appears and tells him he is no longer welcome in her family's life. She tells him that this is because of his inconsistency and unreliability as the grandfather of her son and after discovering another inappropriate affair Ben had with her friend.  Facing eviction, Ben asks his college friend Jimmy Marino ([[Danny DeVito]]) to give him a job at his campus diner. Allyson, now a student, discovers Ben working near her. Ben receives a call from Jordan demanding he leave town immediately and threatening if he does not that she will have Allyson's father's connections persuade him to do so with physical force. At a college party [[Cruising for sex|cruising]], Ben recognizes a customer from the diner then makes a sexual advance toward Daniel's new girlfriend, Maureen ([[Olivia Thirlby]]). Shortly after the girl rebuffs him, he is severely beaten by an ex-police officer ([[Arthur J. Nascarella]]) sent by Nancy who heads up Allyson's father's security team.  After discussing his view of life with Jimmy, Ben collapses and wakes up in a hospital with Susan at his bedside. Ben then leaves the hospital against medical advice. He apologizes to Daniel for his indiscretion and discovers Nancy on the bench where they met. Nancy has learned of Ben's medical condition and appears to struggle with the fact that his illness has caused the pattern of self-destructive behavior in his strange behavior. Ben tells Nancy that aging and the prospect of dying caused him to feel "invisible", so he decided to plunge into life with full gusto. She tells him that's no excuse, but she understands and offers him a ride back to New York City. The film ends with Nancy waiting in the car for his decision and a young woman walking by Ben, still sitting on the bench, in the opposite direction. Ben looks one way at Nancy, then the other way at the woman. The film ends with Ben standing and looking into the camera.

Somewhere I Have Never Traveled
 In a small lazy southern [[Taiwan]] port town, two lonely youths are desperate to escape their drab existence. The first half of the movie is humorous at times, with the child Ah-gui seemingly intent on being killed or maimed. Her father brings home naked mannequins in his drunken stupor, to replace the wife who left him. Ah-gui's world has always been different, and the adults around her don't know why. Her grandmother takes her to see a local shaman to find out why. The shaman says her spirit has gone, but it will return when she grows up. To Ah-gui the world is black, gray, and white and full of constant frustration. Testing at her school finally determines that she is completely color blind.  The person she looks up to is her cousin Ah-hsian. In his mind Ah-hsian travels the world with the help of his bookshelf full of travel guides. A great story teller, Ah-hsian takes Ah-gui on imaginary journeys. The journeys take her away from their drab little town into a world full of odd people, strange customs, and unbelievable wonders. When asked why she has to be so different, Ah-hsian replies that wouldn't the world be boring if everyone was the same? Ah-hsian finds his feelings of being different make sense after a meeting a Japanese tourist who is traveling alone. Ah-hsian brings Ah-gui along when he takes some mosquito repellant to the visitor who is staying overnight in an extra room at the local school. When she goes to find her cousin who is taking a long time, she witnesses part of the intimate encounter between the two. The next day when the tourist departs, we seem to see a new Ah-hsian. So does Ah-gui.  Some years later, Ah-gui is still having a difficult time dealing with her life. She is now going to cosmetology school, a frustrating effort considering her disability. Instructors berate her and even Ah-hsian teases her. Ah-gui and Ah-hsian still dream and plan that one day they will go away to a place where they will not be different. Ah-hsian it turns out, is not only a dreamer, but also a hopeless romantic: the most important goal in his life is 'True Love'. Ah-hsian invites Ah-gui along on an all-night date in the harbor with his new boyfriend. Ah-gui reluctantly goes along and pretends to be asleep as she listens to the discussion. The next day she shows her anger by hacking the hair from her practice head. She attempts to borrow a [[New Taiwan dollar|thousand dollars]] from Ah-hsian to replace the mannequin. However, when he demands that she pay him back because apartments in New York are expensive, she tells him to keep his money. While delivering dinner to her uncle, she finds her money in one of her uncle's hiding places. Soon after, Ah-gui consults a travel agent for help in planning a trip. A pilgrimage to a certain [[Pingelap|small island in the Pacific]] where, according to her cousin, she will fit right in because almost everyone there is born color-blind.<ref></ref>  Both Ah-hsian and Ah-gui soon discover that no matter how carefully you plan and dream, if you are careless with your feelings, life can be unbearably painful. Ah-gui witnesses Ah-hsian's boyfriend with another, the fight that follows, and Ah-hsian apparently crying for hours in the church confessional. In almost perfect English, a soliloquy by Ah-hsian of the passionate love sonnet ''Somewhere I have Never Traveled'' by [[E. E. Cummings]] portends a sad ending. Ah-qui wakes one night to someone banging on the door, yelling "Come quick, Ah-hsian has killed himself." After racing to the hospital on her bike Ah-gui tells her comatose cousin how disappointed she is; how chicken his is; and asks who is he going to take her away now? The movie ends with Ah-gui visiting Ah-hsian who is still in a coma. She tries to get him to play some games they used to play as children and continues asking him to wake up. Later at home with her grandmother who makes umbrellas, grandmother ask her to give her a yellow umbrella, she gives her a blue one and takes the yellow for herself to twirl. Looking off into the distance she tells her grandmother, "Look a rainbow."  
Someone's Knocking at the Door
 Ray Harris, a med student, sits in his dorm, watching [[stag film]]s and shooting what at first appears to be [[heroin]] but is later revealed to be an experimental drug called "Taldon". He hears a knock on his door and answers it. He is greeted with the sight of a fully nude woman, who makes sexual advances towards him. He reciprocates, only for the woman to metamorphose into a grotesque man with a freakishly large penis. The man attacks Ray, and it is strongly implied (and later confirmed) that the man rapes and kills him.  Ray's friends Meg, Joe and Annie learn of Ray's death. Another consort of Ray's, Sebastian, suspects Joe of killing Ray in a bizarre sex game, as Joe was the last person to be seen with Ray. Justin joins the four of them at Ray's funeral. Meanwhile, police are baffled to learn that Ray died after a [[phallus]], fifteen inches in length and four inches in diameter, pulverized his colon. The five remaining coeds come under suspicion and are interrogated. However, no evidence implicating them in the crime exists and they are allowed to leave. A flashback shows the six friends using Taldon, the drug found at the scene of Ray's murder, and reading the case files of John and Wilma Hopper, a serial killer couple that was the subject of an intensive study at the school when it was still a mental hospital. They hypothesize that the Hoppers, long thought to be dead, have returned via [[astral projection]].  Sebastian and Annie park at a secluded place in the woods to make out. Annie grows annoyed by Sebastian's aggressive sexual behavior and is dropped off. Shortly thereafter, she comes face to face with a demonic Wilma Hopper, who uses her genitalia to asphyxiate Annie. Back at the hospital, a detective reading information about the Hoppers is attacked by the reanimated John Hopper, who forces the detective to perform fellatio on him. Meg, after sharing a romantic evening with Justin, research Taldon. It is revealed that the drug is a [[hallucinogen]] that stimulates the central nervous system to dangerous proportions. Her research is cut short when she is attacked by the now-undead detective from earlier, who chases her down the halls of the hospital before being gunned down. John Hopper, taking the form of Annie, seduces and kills Sebastian by anally raping him to death.  Meg, who had earlier passed out after her encounter with the possessed detective, lies on a hospital bed, recovering. She is joined in the same room by Justin. Justin, believing himself to be trapped in an [[artificial reality]], guns down Joe and another detective before committing suicide. Everything that has happened is revealed to be Justin's dying hallucination; he and his friends had overdosed on Taldon the night they first read about the Hopper spree. Justin is at first believed to have died with his friends (with the exception of Meg, who had sworn off drugs) but miraculously survives.  
Sorority Row
 After finding out that her boyfriend Garrett ([[Matt O'Leary]]) has cheated on her, Megan ([[Audrina Patridge]]) enlists the help of her friends and fellow Theta Pi [[sorority]] sisters Cassidy ([[Briana Evigan]]), Jessica ([[Leah Pipes]]), Ellie ([[Rumer Willis]]), Claire ([[Jamie Chung]]), and Charlene ([[Margo Harshman]]) to pull a prank on him. While having sex with Garrett, Megan fakes her own death. Garrett and the girls bring her to a lake, where they intend to dump her body. When Jessica mentions they need to release the air out of her lungs so that her body will not float to the surface, Garrett loses control and stabs Megan in the chest with a tire iron, resulting in her actual death. Garrett and the girls cover up the incident and dump Megan's body and the tire iron in a nearby mine shaft. Everyone swears to never mention the incident to anyone, much to Cassidy and Ellie's dismay.   Eight months later, the girls are graduating from college and have put the incident behind them, but Cassidy has grown apart from the rest of the group. During the party held after graduation, the girls all receive a text message on their cell phones with a picture of a robed person holding the bloody tire iron. Suspicion immediately falls on Garrett, but Charlene defends him, insisting that he's changed after killing Megan. Maggie ([[Caroline D'Amore]]), Megan's younger sister, arrives at the party, wanting to honor her sister's memory. Later that day, Charlene arrives for her appointment to visit her therapist. However, an unknown figure wielding a tire iron murders them.  In the sorority's shower room, Claire and Jessica talk about the night Megan was murdered. After they leave, a sorority girl named Joanna, who overheard their conversation, is murdered. At the party that night, Claire's ex-boyfriend Mickey is attacked and murdered by the killer, which Ellie witnesses. Cassidy, Claire, Jessica, and Ellie regroup and all receive a text containing the video of Megan's death and a message telling them to go to the mine shaft in twenty minutes or the video will be sent to the police. The girls drive to the mine shaft and encounter Garrett, who has cut his wrists and begins threatening them.  Thinking Garrett is the one stalking them, Jessica runs over him with her vehicle. However, they discover afterward that Garrett has been receiving the same text messages they have. Ellie suspects that Megan is the killer, believing that she did not actually die and is seeking revenge. The girls lower Cassidy down the shaft to make prove that Megan is dead. Instead of finding Megan's body, she finds a message written in blood which reads, "Theta Pi must die". Back at the now empty sorority house, the girls receive a text from Chugs' cell phone, telling them that she is dead. Afterward, Claire is murdered with a flare gun. Searching the house for Jessica's boyfriend, Kyle ([[Matt Lanter]]), the girls run into Maggie and their house mother, Mrs. Crenshaw ([[Carrie Fisher]]). Maggie claims that Kyle had been with her prior to Jessica's return.   After finding out about Megan's murder, Mrs. Crenshaw tells the girls to lock themselves in Jessica's bedroom and to call the police while she searches for the killer. Maggie is horrified when she learns what happened to Megan and, thinking she's the killer, leaves the room to find her and convince her to stop killing. After many failed attempts to shoot the killer in the kitchen, Mrs. Crenshaw attempts to reload her shotgun but is killed by the hooded figure with a table. With no cell phones around, Cassidy and Jessica decide to find Mickey's body and use his cell, telling Ellie to run if she gets the chance. Downstairs, the killer confronts Maggie and after she begs the killer to stop, throws a Molotov cocktail at her, setting the house on fire. Cassidy and Jessica run into Kyle, who injures Jessica after getting into an argument with her. Cassidy and Jessica flee to an under-renovation bathroom where they find Megan's decomposing corpse hanging in a closet.  Kyle wearing the same cloak as the killer finds them attacks them. As he does so, it is revealed that Kyle knew of what had happened with Megan as Jessica told him. He is killed with an axe by Andy ([[Julian Morris]]), Cassidy's boyfriend. Jessica regains consciousness and Cassidy realizes that Andy was the killer. Jessica tries to negotiate with Andy, but Andy stabs her in the face, killing her. Revealing himself as the killer, Andy explains that he had hoped for a bright future with Cassidy, but because she was involved with Megan's death, he feared that she would be found out, so he decided to kill everyone who knew about it. Despite Cassidy's opposition, Andy tells her that they need to kill Ellie, the only other person who knew about the murder. Andy reveals that Ellie was the one who confided in him about Megan's murder and will likely report it the police. Cassidy plays along and tells Andy that Ellie is in the basement.  Just as Cassidy fetches Ellie from upstairs, they're discovered and attacked by Andy. Cassidy stuns Andy and escapes, but finds Maggie, who is trapped behind the flames. Andy attempts to kill Maggie, resulting in a fight between him and Cassidy. The floor then crumbles underneath Cassidy, and she is left hanging over the burning basement. As Andy recovers and is about to finish her off, Ellie appears and shoots him with Mrs. Crenshaw's shotgun. He falls backward onto the burning floor, which collapses under him and he falls to his death into the flames. After Maggie and Ellie save Cassidy, the three girls escape from the burning sorority house just as the fire department and other emergency personnel arrive.   18 months later, the Theta Pi building is being renovated from the fire and Maggie is now a Theta Pi sister. As the girls sing the Theta Pi song, a man comes into view, holding a garden trowel. The camera pans up to his wrist, revealing scars, implying that Garrett is still alive.

He's unaware that people worldwide are following his music and spiritual journey through the songs he writes; among them, some [[Contract killing|contract killers]] trying to prevent him from claiming the [[inheritance]] that rightfully belongs to him.  
Soul Diaspora
 The story depicts Saidu ([[Sadiq Abu]]), a [[Nigerian]] [[immigrant]] living in [[Los Angeles]] who is forced to overcome sleepless nights of his tormented past in Africa. The audience finds him alone in this modern world, often hearing voices in his head, sometimes not even his, as the film interweaves color and black and white to illustrate this protagonist's conflicted behavior and tortured mental state.  Saidu's "life's path" brings him to working less than [[minimum wage]] at a mechanic shop, forging little by little a [[friendship]] with a sixteen-year-old Afghani-American, Reza ([[Kristian Steel]]), the son of the shop's friendly owner. Yet, even then, the mysterious Saidu is unable to fully overcome his alienation and loneliness. He soon meets and bonds with a [[stripper]], Latisha ([[Mimi Vasser]]), after frequenting the same [[bar]].  During the film, the audience meets an [[African-American]] named Tyrone ([[Serge Eustache]]) who may not share Saidu's morality, but is confronted with internal troubles. He is embroiled in a seamy [[love triangle]] with Saidu's encounter, Latisha and another woman, Lori ([[Maggie Maki]]), whom he has no feelings for but seems unable-or rather unwilling to rid himself of.  All the characters' souls are stripped to the core by one searing (and national) event, which give them all fresh perspective.<ref></ref>  
Space Buddies
 The film begins with Buddha ([[Field Cate]]) and his owner Sam ([[Nolan Gould]]) star-gazing, when Sam makes a wish to touch the moon. The next day is his school field trip to Vision Enterprises, in which students participate in a special viewing of a test launch of the Vision One spacecraft. However, Sam has to leave Buddha at home to attend, so Buddha secretly escapes to meet up with the other buddies; Rosebud ([[Liliana Mumy]]), Budderball ([[Josh Flitter]]), B-Dawg ([[Skyler Gisondo]]), and Mudbud ([[Henry Hodges]]), and invites them to join his own spectatorship of the test launch. In a quick effort, they hide in the back of the school bus as it drives to the launch site of Vision Enterprises. On a tour with Dr. Finkel ([[Kevin Weisman]]), students see an automatic outfitter that Sam uses. The dogs, not far behind, come across the machine themselves and use it to equip suits before deciding to view the interior of the Vision 1 outside. At the Vision Enterprises' control center, "Mission Control", Pi ([[Bill Fagerbakke]]) confirms the ship is now prepared to launch. The Buddies conveniently place themselves in the seats when they become sealed in. Astro ([[Ali Hillis]]), the remote pilot, activates the shuttle, and the Vision 1 propels into the outer atmosphere with the Buddies.  At Mission Control the operators, unaware of the buddies, discover an incompletely filled third tank. Given ten hours until the ship's supply runs out, they scramble to navigate the Vision 1 to the R.R.S.S. (Russian Research Space Station), an old [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[space station]]. They contact the [[cosmonaut]] living there, Yuri ([[Diedrich Bader]]), instructing him to refuel the Vision 1. Upon its docking, the dogs decide to explore, and meet a dog called Spudnick ([[Jason Earles]]) under Yuri's care. Yuri is quite content to stay in space, however Spudnick disagrees and explains he wishes to go home. Yuri finds the dogs in amazement, so he traps them in the kitchen, leaving them to wait. Spudnick returns to rescue them, but a connected fuel pipe has already started leaking. The puppies rush back to Vision 1 to escape as Yuri tries to block them. As he bangs on the control switches, however, electricity triggers the leak to combust, and everyone on-board escapes one way or another; Yuri barely manages using an escape vessel.  With dire timing, the Vision 1's course proceeds to travel to the moon, leaving the puppies in awe. The ship touches down, and they explore the area of landing. Operators at Mission Control find the helmets of spacesuits sending back soft barking, giving awareness that these puppies are roaming around. The revelation is announced on news networks, which concerns the buddies' owners as they notice their absence. Meanwhile, a [[ferret]] named Gravity ([[Amy Sedaris]]) contacts the buddies on the moon through audio at Mission Control (with no indication of her species), and instructs their return to the spacecraft.  As it returns to [[Earth]], Dr. Finkel changes the path to divert the ship into a [[meteor shower]], which prompts the ships built-in dodging system to quickly maneuver its way out of the situation, with a slight error that busts the data antenna to the right by a passing meteor. Budderball is sent outside the Vision 1 to repair the antenna, space walking to recalibrate it. At Mission Control, the adults remain puzzled about the change when Sam accuses Dr. Finkel as the perpetrator. However, much to Dr. Finkel's denial, Mission Control's security footage justifies that the desk had Dr. Finkel's presence at the time of change, causing him to be quickly removed from the premises.  Mission Control receives Yuri's distress signal in his escape pod, unable to form a response, and the Vision 1 enters the atmosphere. Having good condition, it makes contact with the take-off strip safely, and the buddies exit. They meet Gravity in-person, learning she is a ferret. In a field, Yuri crashes and is rescued by a military group.  Pi awards the Buddies titles of "Space Buddies", wings of heroism, and the Buddies reflect on the lessons they learned. Once at home, Buddha gives Sam a [[moon rock]] taken from his journey, which fulfills Sam's wish. The film ends as Spudnick returns to his old owner, Sasha.  
Soundless Wind Chime

He is [[pickpocket]]ed by a [[Swiss]] thief, Pascal (Bernhard Bulling) who is in an abusive relationship with his [[con artist]] boyfriend ([[Hannes Lindenblatt]]).  Deciding to leave him, Pascal has a chance encounter with Ricky and the two begin a romantic relationship.  The couple struggles through good times and bad, forcing them to determine if their relationship is based on love or dependence on one another.  Several years later, Ricky searches [[Switzerland]] for signs of Pascal, eventually encountering Ueli (also played by Bulling), a timid [[antique store]] owner who looks the same as Pascal, but who has a vastly different personality.

Space Battleship Yamato: Resurrection
 The film opens as the Earth Flagship "Blue Noah" leads the first Emigration Fleet to Amare. Suddenly, thousands of unidentified ships appear and open fire. The Earth fleet's (EDF) warships counterattack, but are quickly overwhelmed. Blue Noah is damaged critically. On one of the failing support ships, Captain Yuki Mori Kodai, wife of the protagonist Susumu Kodai, orders her ship to do an emergency warp, but for some reason, she vanishes mysteriously after the warp.  Thirty-eight-year-old Susumu Kodai, having quit the EDF sometime after ''Final Yamato'', becomes captain of the cargo vessel "Yuki". He picks up the distress signal from the crippled Blue Noah and quickly arrives at the wreck with a boarding party. Without warning, three ships of the enemy fleet arrive. With Kodai at the helm, Blue Noah has just enough power to cover a small distance and fire one shot. Kodai's precise timing and maneuvering destroys all three ships.  Later, at the Headquarters of the EDF, Commander Sanada discusses with Kodai about the approaching black hole. Kodai also learns that his wife became lost in the battle. Sanada wants Kodai to lead the Third Emigration Fleet, saying he should follow his wife's example of volunteering.  Kodai returns home, and is met by his bitter daughter, Miyuki, who blames him for the supposed death of his wife. The two barely speak, and before Kodai can attempt to talk with her, he is called back to HQ with news about the second fleet being destroyed by three different fleets, not including the enemy fleet earlier. This means Earth now has four enemies. Kodai accepts command of the Third Emigration Fleet without hesitation, and Sanada reveals his ship: the "Yamato" itself, newly rebuilt in the Aquarius ice asteroid. After arriving at its drydock and taking his seat in the captain's chair, he makes a solemn vow to find his wife, refusing to believe she is dead. On the other side of the galaxy, the leader of the enemy fleets and the fleet that attacked the Blue Noah is revealed to be the SUS. Metzler, the leader of the SUS, deceived the others that Earth is an invader, and they are barbarians. However, one leader—Gouri, admiral of a fleet belonging to the planet Ethos—is unsure.  The Yamato takes off and joins the fleet, taking its place at the front as Flagship. In the planning room, the crew lays out the mission. The plan is to slingshot around a small black hole, BH199, and boost the arks and warships into high warp, propelling them to Amare much faster than usual. There is no other option, as there are enemy ships lurking around them and the previous fleets were destroyed at this area. Gouri watches the first group of arks slingshot and warp, and then, still unsure, orders an attack. Soon, all the fleets open fire in a frantic battle, damaging warships in each side.  However, when Gouri witnesses the Yamato putting herself in harm's way to defend an ark, Gouri concludes that he has been lied to. He orders his fleets to cease firing and retreat, since the action of the Yamato is "not how barbarians act". He contacts Kodai and tells him that they were misled, twisted to do the bidding of the SUS. Seeing that the EDF fleet fought honorably, Gouri allows them to go in peace. It had some repercussions—he is later threatened by Barlsman, a SUS leader. However, Gouri holds his ground.  The third EDF fleet successfully arrives at Amare, much to the joy of HQ and the citizens of Earth. However, not all is well. SUS launches an attack on Amare, dropping bombs on its cities. Gouri, in an attempt to reclaim his honor and save Amare, rams his vessel into the SUS flagship, destroying it and killing him in the process. Yamato is ordered by General Pascal not to interfere, as it would make Amare-SUS relations worse. Kodai, remembering that his wife always fought injustice, is inspired and informs the Queen Iriya of Amare of his intention to declare war on the SUS. The Yamato launches and blows the SUS bombers away easily. The Queen is brought to tears and thanks Kodai and his crew for their bravery. General Pascal is also inspired, and joins the EDF fleet for one final battle: an assault on the nearby SUS space fortress. If it is destroyed, then the SUS will lose control over everything.  Earth and Amare fleets warp in, and are plunged into battle. Once again, the EDF fleet takes heavy damage, and the Amare fleet is completely wiped out. During the long battle, the Yamato's First Officer sacrifices himself and disables the defensive energy shield around the fortress by ramming it with the Shinano, Yamato's auxiliary ship. The Yamato prepares its [[Wave Motion Gun]] for the first time, and with five powerful shots, destroys the fortress. Then, an immense ship emerges from the bowels of the destroyed fortress, unleashing one superweapon after another. It is only stopped when Kodai, realizing that the power source is the artificial sun behind it, uses the final available shot of the Wave Motion Gun on it, collapsing the sun and turning it into a black hole. The Yamato escapes, while the enemy ship—with all of the SUS leaders in it—is torn apart and sucked into it. Metzler escaped the destruction of the SUS space fortress, and appears to the Yamato crew and reveals himself and the people of the SUS as energy beings that can change form, being sent to this galaxy from another universe. He then disappears.  The Yamato warps back to Earth, and the energy being Metzler appears again. He reveals that the black hole headed for Earth is artificially created and controlled: it will serve as a portal to "steal" Earth and take its resources, since they cannot be found in his world. Kodai realizes that it must have a power source. The Wave Motion Gun automatically reconfigured to enable it to fire all six shots in one go, a risky decision that could destroy the ship, but the crew unanimously agree that saving Earth is more important. The Yamato dives into the black hole, and as it reaches the core, the Wave Motion Gun fires, destroying the artificial weapon in a gigantic implosion. The blast from the Wave Motion Gun had ruptured and damaged the Yamato bow and front section; the third bridge (where the ship's navigation room resides) also suffers serious damage and is exposed to space, killing Chief Navigator Maho Orihara, who was working in it, and her assistants; but the ship is still space-worthy and orbits Earth in triumph. Earth can now be repopulated and the arks can return home. Kodai also reconciles with his daughter in the end.  
Soul Kitchen (film)
  Zinos, a [[Greeks in Germany|German of Greek descent]], owns Soul Kitchen, a shabby, run-down restaurant providing working-class food in the [[Hamburg]] area, in an old warehouse space.  The business is struggling financially, and tax inspectors ask Zinos for payments.  Occasionally a [[punk rock]] band uses the restaurant as practice space, but never pays rental fees.  An old sailor, Sokrates, continuously works on his boat at the warehouse, but is never able to pay the rent.  At a family gathering at an upscale restaurant, Zinos argues with his girlfriend Nadine, a journalist, who is preparing to leave on assignment to [[Shanghai]].  During that dinner, the chef, Shayn, has an argument with a customer, and the restaurant owner dismisses Shayn on the spot.  Afterwards, Zinos meets an old schoolmate, Thomas Neumann, and his fiancée Tanja.  In spite of their arguments over Nadine's assignment to Shanghai, Zinos and Nadine maintain contact via [[Skype]].  Zinos' incarcerated brother Illias, a gambler and hustler, is serving a prison sentence, and has "special leave" where he is allowed occasional leave from the prison, but must do community work as part of the terms.  Zinos agrees to hire Illias to work at Soul Kitchen, to the disdain of bartender Lucia, because Illias has never had a regular job.  Illias asks Zinos not to tell anyone about his criminal past.  Later, Zinos injures his back when trying to move a heavy dishwasher.  He has no medical insurance and cannot afford full medical treatment.  Zinos meets a physical therapist, Anna, in the course of his recovery.  Unable to cook, Zinos finds Shayn and hires him as Soul Kitchen's new cook.  Shayn insists on changing the menu to a new [[haute cuisine]] menu.  This drives away the old clientele and shrinks business to nearly nothing.  Illias has the idea of being a DJ at Soul Kitchen, which he achieves with equipment stolen with the help of his criminal friends.  Shayn begins to teach Zinos gourmet cooking skills.  Gradually, the restaurant's reputation and fortunes turn around, to the point where Zinos can make a tax payment to the authorities.  Although Zinos inadvertently, whilst drunk, revealed to Lucia that Illias has a criminal record, with time and his success as a DJ at Soul Kitchen, Lucia changes her opinion of Illias and begins to find herself attracted to him.  Meanwhile, Neumann has designs on purchasing the restaurant property and re-developing the site.  He offers to buy Soul Kitchen from Zinos, but Zinos continually refuses.  One evening, Shayn spikes one dessert with an aphrosidiac from tree bark.  This has an effect on everyone in the restaurant, including Neumann and Frau Schuster, the lead tax inspector, where the two of them have sex.  Afterwards, after Zinos complimented Neumann on this liaison, Neumann says that he's done the same thing financially to the tax authorities.  However, on her way out of the restaurant, Zinos chats with Frau Schuster, and Zinos reveals Neumann's full name to her.  Zinos had hoped to travel to Shanghai to meet Nadine, but the new success of Soul Kitchen causes Zinos to be distracted from maintaining contact with her.  New tensions arise in their relationship.  To try to reconcile with Nadine, Zinos plans to leave for Shanghai, after he makes Illias manager of Soul Kitchen and gives him full power of attorney. Nadine advises Zinos not to make the journey, because she might be moving her assignment to Tibet.  Zinos buys the plane ticket, but at the [[airport]] about to leave, he sees Nadine, accompanied by a Chinese man, Mr Han.  She has returned following the sudden death of her grandmother.  At the funeral, at which Zinos arrives uninvited (having left the airport rather than take his flight), he realises that Mr Han is Nadine's new boyfriend.  Zinos disrupts the funeral and becomes estranged from Nadine and her family.  [[File:SoulKitchen.JPG|thumb|The Soul Kitchen]] In Zinos' absence, Illias loses the Soul Kitchen in a poker game to Neumann, and signs away the deed.  Neumann and his hired men evict Zinos, Illias and the other denizens of Soul Kitchen.  To try to prevent completion of the deal, Zinos, Illias and some accomplices plan to steal the title deed.  The theft fails and the brothers are arrested.  Zinos is released, but Illias is kept confined for violating the terms of his sentence.  In a final desperate move to try to cure his herniated disc, Anna takes Zinos to a [[chiropractor]], Kemal "the Bone Cruncher", whose extreme therapy succeeds.    Zinos is despondent at losing both his restaurant and Nadine.  However, Nadine feels some guilt for ending her relationship with Zinos.  They have a reconciliation of sorts, where she indicates her eventual plans to return to China and to stay with Mr Han.  Lucia has found employment at another restaurant, and Shayn has apparently left the country altogether.  In a sudden twist, however, the tax authorities have arrested and convicted Neumann of tax fraud.  In prison, Neumann catches a glimpse of Illias, not knowing before that Illias was a convict.  Soul Kitchen is now up for auction to the highest bidder, because Neumann's ownership is now void.  Zinos asks Nadine for a loan to bid for Soul Kitchen at the auction, because she is now wealthy from her grandmother's inheritance.  Through a fortunate accident due to Sokrates which prevents a rival bid against Zinos, Zinos wins the auction and buys the restaurant back.  Although in prison, Illias continues his relationship with Lucia.  The film ends with the restaurant closed for a "private party", with only two attendees, Zinos and Anna, who is visiting Soul Kitchen for the first time.

Splice (film)
 [[Genetic engineering|Genetic engineers]] Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized [[vermiform]] creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature.  Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature "Dren" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt.  After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious.  While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger [[Sequential hermaphroditism|had spontaneously changed to a male]], but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.  Elsa forms a motherly bond with Dren. After Dren jumps on Clive's brother, Gavin, they move her to an isolated farm. There, Dren displays carnivorous tendencies and retractable wings. She grows into adolescence and becomes bored with being locked up in the barn, but Elsa and Clive fear that letting her outside might lead to her discovery. Clive realizes that the human DNA used to create Dren was Elsa's, not from an anonymous donor as Elsa had told him. After Dren exhibits dangerous misbehavior Elsa restrains Dren and removes her stinger, using it to synthesize the protein that Elsa and Clive had been searching for.  Meanwhile, Dren and Clive have developed a mutual attraction. Elsa discovers them having sex in the barn and is horrified. Clive accuses Elsa of never having wanted a "normal" child because of her fear of losing control; instead she chose to raise one as an experiment, where control could be assured. Deciding the only solution is to terminate Dren, they return to the farm and find Dren seemingly already dying.  William Barlow discovers human DNA in Dren's protein samples and arrives to investigate. Elsa tells Barlow that Dren is dead and buried behind the barn. However, Dren, having metamorphosed into a male, rises from the grave and attacks the group, killing Barlow and Gavin before raping Elsa.  Clive attacks Dren to save Elsa, but Dren overpowers him.  Elsa intervenes and is about to kill Dren, but she hesitates, which allows Dren to kill Clive.  Elsa then kills Dren.  Elsa is later informed that Dren's body contained numerous biochemical compounds for which the company has begun filing patents. Joan offers Elsa, now visibly pregnant with Dren's baby, a large sum of money to go through with the pregnancy, which Elsa accepts.

State of Play (film)
 One night, a thief fleeing through Georgetown in Washington, D.C., is shot by a man carrying a briefcase. A deliveryman who witnesses the incident is also shot by the killer and is left in a coma. The following morning, a young woman is killed by a [[Washington Metro]] train in what seems to be [[suicide]]. Congressman Stephen Collins ([[Ben Affleck]]) is distraught to hear that the woman was Sonia Baker ([[Maria Thayer]]), a researcher on his staff. Collins, who has military experience, is leading an investigation into PointCorp, a [[private military company|private defense contractor]] with controversial operations involving [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Collins tells his college roommate and old friend Cal McAffrey ([[Russell Crowe]]), an investigative reporter, that he had been having an affair with Sonia and that she had sent him a cheerful video message on the morning of her death, which he says is inconsistent and unusual behavior for someone about to commit suicide.  Della Frye ([[Rachel McAdams]]), a reporter and blogger with the online division of Cal's newspaper and its editor, Cameron Lynne ([[Helen Mirren]]), discover that Sonia's death occurred in one of only three [[CCTV]] blind spots in the Metro camera system. Cal believes the shootings are related to Sonia's death and finds a link between the thief and a homeless girl who sought out Cal. The girl gives him photographs that the thief, a friend of hers, had stolen from the killer's briefcase. The photos show surveillance images of Sonia talking to a well-dressed man. Della visits the hospital where the deliveryman is regaining consciousness and witnesses his murder by an unseen sniper. Later, she reviews CCTV footage and recognizes a man she saw at the hospital.  It is later revealed that PointCorp stands to gain billions of dollars annually from its mercenary activities in the [[Middle East]] and domestically. Cal speaks with Collins, who shares his research findings: PointCorp is cooperating with other defense contractors to create a [[monopoly]] and purchase government surveillance and defense contracts, essentially [[Privatize|privatizing]] United States security. Cal's PointCorp insider returns with the address of someone linked to the suspected assassin. Cal finds the assassin living there and calls the police, who force the man to disappear after he shoots at Cal.  Della, following a lead, finds the identity of the well-dressed man who was speaking to Sonia in the listed photographs. He is Dominic Foy ([[Jason Bateman]]), a [[Public relations|PR]] executive working for a subsidiary of PointCorp. Cal blackmails Foy into talking about his activities with Sonia and secretly tapes their conversation. He reveals that Sonia was being paid to spy on Collins and to seduce him to get information for PointCorp, but she fell in love with Collins and was pregnant with his child when she was killed.  Before Cal's newspaper goes to press, Collins goes on record to present his research into PointCorp. Collins's estranged wife Anne ([[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright Penn]]), whose conversation with Cal seems to imply a past love triangle dating back to their college years, reveals that she knows the amount of money Sonia received from PointCorp, after hearing Collins's statement to the newspaper. After the couple leaves, Cal realizes that Collins already knew that Sonia was working for PointCorp. Cal wonders what Collins would have done had he known he had been tricked and whether Collins himself is connected with Sonia's assassin. A picture of Collins from his military days, with the assassin in the frame, confirms Cal's hunch. Collins reveals that he had been suspicious of Sonia, and that he hired the assassin to watch her. The assassin is U.S. Army corporal Robert Bingham ([[Michael Berresse]]), whose life Collins had once saved. Collins says that Bingham hated PointCorp more than he did, and that he killed Sonia with no authorization.  Cal tells Collins that he has three minutes to leave his office before the police arrive, as he has already contacted them. As he leaves the building, Cal is confronted by Bingham. Officers arrive and shoot Bingham before he opens fire. Cal leaves and goes to his office. There, Cal and Della type up their own story, noting that Collins was secured and arrested.  
St. George Shoots the Dragon

It is largely set in and around a small village by the [[Sava|Sava river]] near Serbia's border with hostile [[Austria-Hungary]].  The village is deeply divided between able-bodied men that are potential army recruits and the many disabled veterans from the previous [[Balkan Wars]]; there is bitter animosity between the two groups, who do not intermingle much with each other even though they live in the same village.  The movie's central theme is a love triangle between the village [[Gendarmerie|gendarme]] Đorđe, his wife Katarina and the young disabled war veteran Gavrilo who was previously engaged to Katarina before he went to war and lost his arm in battle, and with the arm partly also his lust for life. Even though Katarina married Đorđe in the meantime, she still has affection for Gavrilo, which is a source of friction between the two.  At the onset of World War I, all able-bodied men in the village are recruited for combat. Left in the village are only women, children and disabled veterans from previous Balkan wars. Rumours start circulating that the [[Political correctness|invalids]] in the village are trying to take advantage of the situation by making their moves on the women in the village &ndash; the wives and sisters of the recruited men. These rumours reach the villagers at the frontlines, and in order to prevent mutiny the army staff decides to recruit the invalids as well and send them to the front line.  
St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold
 One night, the girls of St. Trinian's catch Celia, a member of the eco sect, retrieving an old ring from the school's Fritton Archives, who explains that an unknown man telephoned her to retrieve it for him in exchange for £20,000. Seeking to get more, Annabelle Fritton, the new head girl, demands £100,000 from the man when he calls back, only for him to refuse and threaten the girls for their greed. When the school's power is cut, the girls ask their headmistress, Camilla Fritton, about why the ring might be so valuable.   Camilla recognises the ring as one of two created by a pirate ancestor of hers in 1589, which when brought together can lead the way to a buried treasure hidden somewhere in the world. Shortly after learning this, the school is besieged by masked men led by Sir Piers Pomfrey, a man of flawless reputation and a descendant of the man that was robbed by Camilla's pirate ancestor, who steals the ring with the intention of finding the treasure.  Seeking to stop him, the girls search for the second ring and find a clue left by another ancestor who located the first and left it in the archives. After a difficult time deciphering a clue they left, the girls find it to be hidden within a boy's school, leaving a group to infiltrate it in disguise and recover it. Seeking to recover the first, the girls learn that Piers is the leader of a secret society known as AD1, a [[masculinist]] brotherhood, and that Camilla's old flame and former head of education, Geoffrey Thwaites, knows about him and the society.   After tracking him down at a pub, Camilla convinces him to help them, whereupon she puts him through a course to help him overcome his need for drink, and assigns him to work undercover at AD1's hideout, with Annabelle calling in the former head girl Kelly, now an [[M.I.7]] agent, to assist in the recovery of the ring. Despite the girls not finding it in the vault, Geoffrey spots it being worn by Piers and manages to steal it from him, returning it back to St. Trinian's.  Finding that the two rings bear longitude and latitude coordinates respectively on them, the girls find that the treasure is buried under the [[Globe Theatre]]. After organising a flash mob to keep AD1 from pursuing them, after Piers learns they recovered the first ring, Camilla, Geoffrey, the school's bursar, Annabelle and a small group of the girls make it to the theatre, and while the girls head underneath the building, Camilla and Geoffrey pose as actors they knocked out to avoid raising an alarm.   Although the girls make it to the treasure's location within a secret room, they discover a chest within containing nothing more than a note from Pirate Fritton, who gave up being a pirate to write plays under the name of [[William Shakespeare]], and that the treasure was the final play he wrote intended to reveal that "he" was a woman. Piers, managing to track them down, holds them at gunpoint and steals the play from them, revealing that his ancestors knew this fact and that he had always intended to find the play and destroy it. The girls watch as he flees the scene on his private boat.  Seeking to stop him, the girls take control of the reconstruction of the [[Golden Hind]] and sail it down the Thames, whereupon they attack Pier's boat, with Camilla recovering the play's script from him. The girls soon return to St. Trinian's for a wild party to celebrate their success, while Piers is exposed for being a sexist after AD1 is revealed to the media.

David invites him down to the basement, where he has installed locked cabinets, and tries to befriend Michael over tequila shots.  Michael's suspicions start when David uses the wrong name when mentioning his deceased daughter. After Susan says that an elderly neighbor warned her that ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'' ran a profile on a serial killer that looked like David, David barges into the woman's house and throws her down her basement stairs, breaking her neck.   Susan's ex-husband Jay confronts David angrily about laying hands on his younger son, Sean, after David grabbed the boy roughly for failing to turn down the volume on his video game. He warns Susan that she knows nothing about David. Doubts about David mount further when he quits his job working as a real estate agent for Susan's sister, Jackie ([[Paige Turco]]), to avoid displaying a photo ID and other forms of identification.  Later, Jay confronts David about an apparent lie regarding his college history. David clubs him with a vase and suffocates him with a plastic bag. He sends Michael a text with Jay's phone saying that David checked out okay.  When the neighbor woman's body is discovered two weeks later, David tells the family.

While Michael's girlfriend, Kelly ([[Amber Heard]]), tries to get him to focus on college applications, he grows more obsessed with the contradictions in David's stories. Michael is obsessed with David's stories and Kelly leaves.  The situation comes to a head when David intercepts an email from Jackie about hiring an investigator. He then goes to Jackie's house and drowns her in her pool. Determined to discover what was in the locked cabinets, Michael breaks into the basement as Kelly keeps a lookout. In the basement, Michael eventually discovers his dad's body in a freezer. David knocks out Kelly and traps Michael in the basement. The commotion awakens Susan, and he berates her parenting skills and says that he thought she could be "Mrs. Grady Edwards". On Susan's stunned reaction, David grimaces and asks, "Who am I here?", Susan tries to snap him out of it, saying his name, causing him to say "David! I'm David Harris!"   Susan, realizing the situation after noticing the unconscious Kelly, flees to the bathroom, locking herself in. David kicks the door in, shattering the mirror behind it. Susan picks up a shard of the glass mirror, holding it behind her. David grabs her, they struggle, and she manages to stab him in the neck with the shard. He falls to the floor, apparently dead. Michael escapes from the basement and finds Kelly. They find Susan in the hallway across from the bathroom, thinking David is dead. Then David approaches from behind and blocks the stairs, chasing all of them into the attic, where he and Michael fight. Both fall onto the roof and then off the edge of the roof to the ground, where they lie unconscious.  When Michael wakes up, he finds out he had been in a coma for just over a month.

Stoic (film)
 The film is presented through several flashbacks as the three inmates are being interviewed in regards to the apparent suicide of their 4th cellmate, Mitch Palmer, who has hanged himself.  It is gradually revealed throughout the interviews that the inmates tortured and humiliated Mitch prior to his hanging.   The film begins with the four cellmates playing poker for cigarettes and trading stories of their lives prior to their incarcerations.  After Mitch wins all of his cellmates’ cigarettes, they coerce him to play one more game.  Mitch says he’ll put his entire bag of cigarettes on the table, and the loser has to eat an entire tube of toothpaste.   Mitch loses the round and refuses to eat the toothpaste as the cellmates continually ask him to uphold his end of the bet.  At first it seems like the cellmates decide to give up and call it a night.  Harry Katish, who is in jail for armed robbery, pretends to wash up and wraps a towel around a bar of soap.  He then goes to Mitch and begins to scream and hit him with the soap, as the others grab him and hold him down.  All three force him to eat the entire tube of toothpaste.  The three leave him be as Mitch lies on the floor, his stomach in pain.  Peter Thompson, a low level drug dealer, goes to Mitch and pretends to be concerned, and says he’ll make him a special drink that will make him feel better.  Peter grabs a glass, and fills it with water, salt, and a piece of pepper.  Mitch says he isn’t stupid, but the other cellmates tell him as far as they’re all concerned, he already drank the drink, and threaten to hold him down again.   Out of fear of being held down again, Mitch drinks as much as he can but begins to throw up.  The cellmates laugh, and Peter says he’ll make another drink to make him feel better.  Peter takes water filled with urine and feces from the toilet bowl.  Mitch however, is choking and throwing up, but the cellmates start a countdown advising they’ll force him to drink it.  Mitch grabs the glass and after one sip begins to throw up and choke.   Jack Ulrich, in jail for arson, becomes enraged and violently beats Mitch, telling him to lick up his vomit with his tongue and belittles him as a pig.  Mitch begs and pleads that he’ll clean up the mess with his mop, but Jack continues to beat him harder as Peter and Harry watch apathetically.  Mitch crawls to the mess and begins to lick the vomit, further becoming sick.  The cellmates become bored and decide to call it a night.  As the cellmates sleep, Mitch sits down and stares at the emergency button.  He makes a run and presses it, screaming into the intercom that he needs help, but the cellmates wake up and drag him to the wall and cover his mouth.  Peter, speaking to the guards through the intercom, says Mitch just hurt himself and it’s nothing they can’t handle.  The three cellmates beat Mitch to the ground, and then all urinate in a cup, pouring it down Mitch’s throat.   Jack is further enraged that Mitch pressed the emergency button, and then anally rapes him.  Peter, witnessing the rape, begins to feel remorseful and says things have gone too far, however he is threatened with violence by Jack and Harry, with Jack remarking that he’s “already a part of this” and to “remember who made the drink”.  Harry then stares at Mitch, grabs the mop handle, and violently sodomizes Mitch with it, then putting the bloody and feces covered handle in Mitch’s mouth.  Mitch becomes catatonic as Jack and Harry watch TV, and Peter begins to shake with remorse.   Jack and Harry confront Peter on his remorse, who states he is fearful that the guards will see the blood and bruises during their routine checks, and that serving a longer sentence as a result is not worth this.  Harry asks Peter what they should do, and Peter recounts an urban myth in that if a cellmate commits suicide, the psychological trauma inflicted on his fellow cellmates will significantly reduce their sentence.  The three cellmates decide that Mitch needs to hang himself.  They first prop him against the barred window and tie his neck with a TV cord, but the attempt fails.  They then try with Mitch’s bedsheets and have him stand on a garbage can, granting him a final cigarette before Harry says “enough of this shit” and kicks the garbage can away, killing Mitch.  Peter is reduced to tears as Jack and Harry remain apathetic.     The next morning, the three cellmates agree to hit the emergency button and pretend to be upset by what has happened, however Peter remains silent.  Throughout the interviews, Harry denies any involvement or accusations in regards to the torture and humiliation and remains indifferent to what has transpired; Jack admits his guilt and is remorseful, stating he doesn’t know why he did what he did and wants his hands washed clean; Peter is in tears for the entire interview, stating the hanging was his idea and Mitch did not deserve what happened to him.   The film ends with text stating the three cellmates, all serving 2- to 3-year sentences, received an additional 8 to 15 years for their role in Mitch Palmer’s death.  It is then revealed Mitch was serving a 6-month sentence for vagrancy and resisting arrest.  The closing frames show Mitch helping Peter do proper pushups, and bonding in a friendly manner with his fellow cellmates.

Sanjay is determined to find the stone-man. He takes the help of his informer Ghanshu(Ashraful haque).The Stoneman is shown to be killing poor people sleeping on streets (beggars, workers, sweepers etc.). All the people on the streets think the killer is a midnight taxi driver named Mohammed. His wife Manali ([[Rukhsar]]) is upset with him and thinks that he is having an affair. One night someone throws a stone into Sanjay's house through a window. Manali thinks it to be the mischief of boys of the locality; Sanjay feels it is the Stoneman. Another night the Stoneman tries to kill a beggar sleeping on the roadside but is saved by Kedar and some patrolling policemen. Sanjay and his car is spotted by Kedar. Sanjay finds that his investigation house has been visited by the Stoneman as he sees vermilion spread everywhere in the room.

Before he can catch him, Kedar shoots him in the thigh, thinking him to be the killer. Sanjay escapes and the incident brings him closer to his wife. He suspects the killer to be a policeman, from a tribe, performing an impotency ritual and asks his trusted cop Kamble ([[Virendra Saxena]]) to tell this to AIG Satam along with evidence.

In a trap laid by the police in the hospital, when Kamble sneaks in to kill Sanjay, he is nabbed and the matter is closed.

Both Leah and Tommy worry that Steve, recently [[furlough]]ed because of a drinking problem, will be unreliable. Ryan also is an unnecessary complication to the flight as he continually probes for details about the mission and Leah's background and motivation.  Leah reports back to her supervisor Eli Harder (William MacDonald) who is involved with a full-scale evacuation of [[Corpus Christi, Texas]] called by NSC Director James McCaffee (Mackenzie Gray), due to the proximity of Hurricane Ike.

Leah again tries to alert the NSC that Hurricane Josephine has shifted and is headed directly to Jacksonville. Announcing a second evacuation is problematic, the NSC Director, despite Eli's pleas to look at the data Leah is sending, refuses to change the evacuation plans already in progress.  The violent storm suddenly turns into a level 5 hurricane with winds at over  battering Flight 263. Captain Henry Gersh (Barclay Hope) and co-pilot Ben Tillner (Chad Cole) on his first hurricane hunters flight, wrestle the aircraft through a climb that abruptly turns into an out-of-control dive to wavetop heights. After a fire in one of the engines is doused by the violent rain storm outside, electrical systems begin shorting out, with both Henry and Tommy blinded by the sparking equipment. Leah is abruptly hurled into the ceiling as the aircraft enters a [[elliptic|parabolic]] maneuver. Turbulence increases with the rear exit door torn off, and the sudden [[Cabin pressurization|depressurization]] sucks both Leah and Tommy out of the aircraft. Caught in the cargo netting, Leah is still alive but badly hurt. Ryan reacts quickly to haul Leah back inside, with the two crawling their way to the cockpit for safety. Leah has a dislocated shoulder that Ryan attempts to reset but with Henry blinded, she convinces Ryan that he has to help Ben fly the crippled aircraft.  Receiving Flight 263's [[mayday]] distress message and on the ground reports of the hurricane already battering the coast, Eli finally convinces the Director that Hurricane Josephine is the greater danger. Ben and Ryan manage to bring the aircraft down safely at Jacksonville, and as Henry and Leah are brought out by emergency crews, all the surviving members of the flight find out that their loved ones are safe.  
Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li
  Chun-Li moves from [[San Francisco]] to [[Hong Kong]] with her family. While practicing to be a concert pianist, she learns [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]] from her father, businessman Xiang. For a while, her life is perfect until one night, Xiang is attacked and abducted by M. Bison's henchmen in front of Chun-Li. When Chun-Li was grabbed, Xiang had no other choice to stop moving.  Years later, Chun-Li grows up and becomes a talented pianist. At the end of her concert, she receives a mysterious scroll written in ancient [[Chinese language|Chinese]] text. Shortly after, she loses her mother to cancer. Meanwhile, at Shadaloo headquarters in [[Bangkok]], Thailand, Bison announces his complete control of the organization before he has the other shareholders executed by one of his henchmen, Vega. It is also revealed that Xiang is still alive and working for Bison.  The next day, [[Royal Thai Police]] detective Maya Sunee meets [[Interpol]] agent Charlie Nash, when both are called to investigate the murder of several crime syndicate families in Bangkok. Nash informs Maya that the Shadaloo perpetrated these crimes. Back in Hong Kong, an elderly woman translates Chun-Li's scroll and tells her to travel to Bangkok and find a man named Gen. Chun-Li then leaves her home and travels to Bangkok, living homeless and searching for Gen for several days. A fight with local gangsters one night leaves her exhausted and unconscious, and Gen appears and brings her to his home.  Gen informs her that he was once comrades with Bison and he knows how to find her father, and for the next few days, he teaches her his style of martial arts. Chun-Li also learns more about Bison, who is operating Shadaloo publicly, and is holding the families of property owners hostage in order to force them to sign their property over to him. While spying on Bison's henchman Balrog, she overhears that a property owner is asked to hand over the rights to a docking harbor, allowing the shipment of the "White Rose".  Later that night, Chun-Li confronts Cantana, one of Bison's secretaries, in a nightclub. She obtains information on the location of the White Rose before escaping from Shadaloo's thugs and Nash and Maya. As a result of this incident, Cantana is used as a punching bag by Bison the next day and killed.  Gen tells Chun-Li more of Bison's origin. The son of Irish missionaries, Bison grew up an orphan and lived his entire life as a thief. Many years later, as a means of becoming completely evil, he killed his pregnant wife and transferred his conscience into their prematurely born daughter. After telling Chun-Li to go and fetch some food, Gen is attacked by Shadaloo troops before Balrog blows up his house. Chun-Li runs off when she is attacked by Vega, whom she soundly defeats and leaves hanging by the side of a building.  The next day, Chun-Li interrogates a harbor employee into telling her the arrival time of the White Rose. She returns to the shipping yard that night, only to fall into a trap as Bison and his soldiers capture her. Tied up and brought into an undisclosed house, she is reunited with Xiang, only for Bison to kill him by breaking his neck. After Bison and Balrog leave the house, Chun-Li uses her skills to defeat the guards and escape. During the escape, she is shot in the arm by Balrog while trying to protect a child. Angered Thai locals then pelt Balrog and other Shadaloo henchmen with fruits, food, and other merchandise. Chun-Li is reunited with Gen, who heals her wounds and continues with her training.  Despite being taken off the assignment, Nash is secretly asked by Chun-Li to back her up in taking down Bison. Nash and Chun-Li, along with Maya and her SWAT team, arrive at the shipping yard, where they engage in a shootout with Shadaloo forces. Maya is wounded in the shootout, but her SWAT team manages to dwindle Shadaloo's numbers. Meanwhile, Chun-Li enters a ship and meets a girl who speaks Russian asking for her father before leaving her to continue her search for Bison. In another part of the ship, Gen faces off against Balrog, ultimately impaling him with a liquid nitrogen pipe. Bison takes the girl, who is revealed to be his daughter Rose, and flees the scene by helicopter.  Chun-Li, Gen, Nash and a SWAT officer arrive at Bison's headquarters, where Nash and the officer take Rose out to safety while Chun-Li and Gen face Bison. After a long battle, Chun-Li hits Bison with a bamboo pole and drops sandbags on him, stunning him. She then charges up a ''Kikoken'' and shoots it at him, knocking him off the scaffolding before she jumps and twists his neck with her legs. Nash tells Chun-Li to leave the scene as Thai police arrive.  Chun-Li returns to her home in Hong Kong and settles down when Gen pays her a visit. He shows her a newspaper ad for an upcoming Street Fighter tournament, telling her that a Japanese fighter named [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] might be a recruit for their cause. She declines the offer, telling him she is home for now.

Unfortunately, Charlie can’t take a hint (or several dozen hints) and Rob develops a plan to get the two of them together. The next time Charlie helps Juliet in the editing bay, Rob convinces their bumbling Professor to end class early locking Charlie and Juliet in the classroom. Stuck spending the night together, Charlie and Juliet finally open up to each other.

Street Dreams (film)
 Derrick Cabrera ([[Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)|Paul Rodriguez]]) has a dream of being sponsored and one day going pro. He is an up-and-coming street skateboarder from [[Chicago]] with all the talent but has the world against him. He and his fellow skateboarding friends Cash ([[Ryan Dunn]]), Reese ([[Terry Kennedy (skateboarder)|Terry Kennedy]]), and Troy ([[Rob Dyrdek]]), as well as filmographer friend Mikey ([[Adam Wylie]]), spend their days skating at spots around the city, being pursued by cops for skating where they shouldn't be, and planning how to make names for themselves. In Derrick's case, this means landing one special trick on-camera for a sponsorship video that has never been done before, affectionately dubbed the N.A.C. (Not A Chance) by his friends. Unfortunately, the handrail at the local university he needs to practice his trick on has been skate-proofed, preventing him from making that goal a reality.  At home, Derrick's passion has started interfering with his high school education, causing tension between him and his father ([[Yancey Arias]]). At the same time, Derrick's preppy, partying girlfriend Samantha (Jordan Valley) is starting to make him lose focus of his goals with her high-maintenance personality. After the stress between Derrick and Samantha comes to a boil and they break up, he joins his friends on a trip to Ohio to visit a skate park with the perfect rail to practice the N.A.C., and so they all can practice for the coming Tampa AM amateur skateboarding contest in Florida. However, when Troy notices Derrick gaining more attention from sponsors and professional photographers while practicing the N.A.C., his jealousy takes over and forces the group to pack up and leave before Derrick can successfully land his trick. Thankfully, before leaving, Derrick has the chance to meet well-renowned skater Eric Jones ([[Ryan Sheckler]]), and attractive older sister Taylor (C.C. Sheffield), and learns Eric will be competing in the Tampa Am contest as well.  When Derrick returns home to a furious father and the boring school routine, the only thing Derrick can think about is finally landing the N.A.C., so he comes up with a plan: taking an angle grinder to the welded knobs on the university rail, and skate it all night. To do this, he enlists the help and trust of his friends to watch for cops as he cuts the knobs off. All goes according to plan, until cops eventually show up, and Troy, who saw them coming, deliberately fails to inform the rest of the group, resulting in Derrick and Mikey getting arrested. This causes the tension and anger between Derrick and his father to reach a critical point, resulting in thrown fists and Derrick running away with his friends to Florida to compete in the Tampa AM.  Arriving in Tampa, the gang immediately gets into various shenanigans; Derrick plays a game of S.K.A.T.E. with some other skateboarders there for the competition, Cash and Reese cause a fiery explosion in the parking lot of their motel, and after dropping off their stuff in their room, head to the [[Ybor City]] strip to party. However, this quickly goes awry after Cash and Troy get too drunk on shots and cause a fistfight that ends with Cash being taken to jail for the night. Finally Derrick has had enough of Troy's ego and calls him out on his faults in front of the group, prompting Troy to confess to letting the cops arrest Derrick and Mikey back at the rail. In a rage, Derrick abandons the group, just in time for Eric and Taylor to find him and allow him a place to stay in their motel room. After having a talk with Taylor, Derrick calls his father to let him know where he is and that he's okay, and his father wishes him luck in the competition.  The next day, Derrick arrives at the Tampa AM with Eric and Taylor, where Mikey, Reese, and a freshly-out-of-jail Cash happily meet up with him. During pre-competition practice though, Troy makes it abundantly clear that he and Derrick are enemies here, shoulder-checking Derrick and knocking him off his board. As the competition begins, Troy appears to be faring better than Derrick, landing all of his tricks with Derrick only landing three. However, because Derrick's tricks were harder and Troy played it easy with more basic tricks, Derrick leaves Troy behind as he qualifies first place for the finals. Troy is initially furious, but finally Cash steps up and puts him in his place, as well as a headlock. With the dust settled, all of Derrick's friends wish him luck on his final run.  With the support of his friends carrying him, Derrick advances to the finals with full confidence. His plan here is simple: to land the N.A.C. in his final run. As he approaches his end goal he is certain of his ability to do so, but even at the last moment, Derrick fails once again trying to land it. However, even though the clock has run out and it won't count for the competition, the judges and fellow competitors want to see Derrick try again. With all of the skateboarding world watching, Derrick finally lands the N.A.C., with plenty of footage from Mikey for his sponsorship video. Derrick is instantly landed a sponsorship on the spot, and after trading phone numbers with Taylor, he hops in Troy's van with the gang to ride back to Chicago in victory.

There Malik, played by Stahly, falls in love with Sara's young handyman, Bilal, played by Salim Kechiouche, who lives in a servant's bungalow on the estate, and who has also returned recently from a life in France.  The French title, ''Le Fil'' refers to Malik's neurotic anxiety, originating in childhood but continuing in the time of the story, manifest in the feeling he is attached at his back to a string that threatens to entangle and strangle him, an anxiety that expresses a troubled and deeply ambivalent relationship with his dominating mother, whom he cannot confront but upon whom he is also fearfully dependent.  The title is also apparently a play on words, as the French title of the film, "le fil" (the thread), is closely akin in spelling to "le fils" (the son).  His mother and grandmother want Malik to marry and have children and Malik has failed to confront his mother with his own homosexuality. During the course of the story, Malik agrees to marry his friend and cousin, Syrine, a lesbian who is planning a pregnancy by artificial insemination in order to raise a child with her lesbian lover, but who nevertheless wants the child to have a father and be like other children in the traditional society of Tunisia.  Malik befriends Bilal, a 25 year old also recently returned from France to Tunisia, who does odd jobs and gardening for Sara and lives in  the servants' quarters on the estate.  Bilal, a sweet-natured dreamer, is distressed by the news that Malik is to marry and confronts Malik, who is devastated when Bilal tells him that he must leave, that he cannot continue as Malik's servant.  The two make love, but Sara discovers the pair in bed together the next morning, forcing Malik to a decision to try a form a relationship with Bilal; Sara begins her own journey of acceptance even as the two lovers depart on a road trip to the countryside where their intimacy and bond grows.    The film opens with a class of adults studying Arabic as a second language.  While the teacher rehearses the students in repeating a simple phrase, Hakim, one of the students, whispers to his friend Bilal a question about why a person returns to his country, saying that he regrets everyday his decision to come back to Tunisia from France.  .

Sundo
 The film opens with Vanessa ([[Iza Calzado]]) who was killed when she was visited by her long dead husband as her companion. The film then cuts to [[protagonist]] Romano ([[Robin Padilla]]), a retired military operative who goes into seclusion after being seriously wounded in battle and almost died, discovers that he has the uncanny ability of seeing ghosts around people who will soon encounter sudden, disastrous deaths. Worried of his brother, Romano’s blind sister Isabel ([[Rhian Ramos]]) persuades him to return to Manila with the help of Louella ([[Sunshine Dizon]]), Romano’s childhood friend who is a doctor and harbors affection for him.  An aspiring actress, Kristina ([[Katrina Halili]]), a widow, Lumen (Glydel Mercado), and her nephew, Eric ([[Hero Angeles]]) hitch a ride with Romano, Isabel and Louella along with Louella’s driver, Baste ([[Mark Bautista]]). On their van's way back to the city, the group manages to avoid a fatal accident on the road as Romano woke up just in time to warn Baste - having just dreamt of the impending tragedy. As he steps out of the van to survey the scene, he started seeing ghosts surrounding the van and eventually looking at him. The ghosts are an old man, a young woman with hair covering her face, two more adult men, and a woman who Romano thinks look like his mother. He also hears a baby crying though he is unable to see it. After this, the group stopped to eat dinner and rest in a small eatery in [[Baguio]]. Just as Lumen mentioned that she needs to use the ladies room, one of the adult male ghosts showed himself to Romano and interacted with him. Soon after, Lumen died as a [[rail spike]] pins her head. The next tragic event happened as Eric died of electrocution while attending Lumen's husband's wake, right after the other adult male ghost grabbed Romano to get his attention.   The group now consulted with a local elder who informs them that Romano can see ghosts because of an open third eye. Moreover, the ghosts that he sees are "Sundo" - or those who the grim reaper uses to fetch a person who is about to die. The Sundo can be anyone such as a spouse, siblings, parents, or a friend - anyone who has previously died and has a close relationship with the person. Because Romano prevented the earlier road accident from happening when they are "meant" to die, they still "owe" the grim reaper their lives and this debt will be collected no matter what. After leaving the local elder, the group discussed that there are 7 people in the van but Romano only saw 5 ghosts. Romano is unsure whether the ghost of their mom is his or his sister Isabel's Sundo.   Kristina and Baste also died right after their Sundo show themselves to Romano. Baste's Sundo is the old man who turned out to be his grandfather who raised him. Kristina's Sundo is the young woman with hair covering her face who is a twin sister that she is not aware exists. After these deaths, Romano, Isabel and Louella decided to stay in Louella's apartment and spend the night.  Louella, feeling emotional and scared, finally confessed to Romano that the remaining mysterious ghost - a crying baby - is her Sundo. She got pregnant while in medical school, felt that she was not ready to be a mother and had an abortion.    Later on, Romano was lured to the balcony by Isabel as his Sundo. As he realizes that his sister is already dead, the grim reaper pushed him over the balcony. Romano lands into the pool and regains consciousness. As he ascends from the pool he saw a distraught Louella crying. She tells him that he can't be her Sundo, as she already repaid the grim reaper with a life - that is Isabel's life and not her own. She insists that she cheated death by doing so and he can't fetch her. Romano realizes that Louella killed his sister and a flashback of Louella smothering a sleeping Isabel with a pillow is shown. Louella continued to plead to Romano and look visibly scared. Romano then looked at the pool and saw his dead floating body. It turned out that he has died in the water and is now Louella's Sundo. The end scene show the grim reaper going for a screaming Louella as she dies.

Summer's Blood
 Summer ([[Ashley Greene]]) is hitchhiking along the side of the road when a man pulls over. He asks her where she's going, and she tells him; he says he's going through that town and that it was no trouble. Maybe, for this favor, she would do a favor for him. He expects Summer to pay him with giving him oral sex. Summer pulls out a gun and tells the driver to keep his eyes on the road. Summer is next seen in a gas station. Summer shoplifts food and accessories at a store in a small town. The sheriff (Paul Whitney) watches Summer from a distance. He approaches Summer, informing her that "people around here pay for their items." Summer throws down a rack of store goods. She runs away. The sheriff falls over the rack.  Summer runs outside. A young man Tom Hoxey ([http://Peter_Mooney Peter Mooney]) tells Summer to hide inside his truck. Summer is reluctant to accept Tom's offer, but he urges her to hurry up or else the sheriff will find her. Tom drives off with Summer. She asks Tom the reason he helps her to escape the sheriff. He claims the sheriff previously busted him for a drinking charge. At a local bar, the two of them have a few drinks. They chat about Summer's travels. Summer is obviously a confident girl who can take care of herself. Tom takes Summer back to his home. Summer discovers that Tom lives with his mom, Gaia ([[Barbara Niven]]). Tom is direct with Summer, so the two agree to go upstairs and have sex. As they are having sex, the audience then sees Gaia outside Tom's door, listening to him and Summer having sex.  In the morning, Summer wakes up and puts her clothes on. She scavenges the kitchen, taking money from a jar. Tom enters the kitchen. He tells Summer she can stay. Summer is not interested. She tells Tom he was good last night, and that she wanted to avoid the awkward morning goodbye. Tom refuses to let Summer leave, continually telling Summer she can't leave. Summer pulls out a gun,  threatening Tom to let her go or else she'll take action. Tom's mother Gaia smacks Summer on the back of her head with an object. Tom shows his mom that in his hand are the bullets to Summer's revolver, reassuring her that he had it under control.  Summer is stored in the basement. A frail young woman Amber (Danielle Kind) is also held hostage; that the lack of sun is what's hurting Amber, not Tom. Tom tells Summer that he considers the basement as his garden. The girls make his garden look beautiful. The audience then discover Tom is a serial killer after he shows Summer a skull of a deceased girl. Summer says that he killed the girl, and Tom, angry, hits her, insisting he would never kill any of his girls.  Amber's father Darwin is released from jail. He notices his home is a mess, and that there's rotten food in the fridge. Darwin asks the sheriff whether he has heard from Amber, saying that he heard around town that Amber was hanging around Tom. The sheriff is biased toward Darwin, dismissing him and telling Darwin that Amber probably left town for a while, as she had before. Summer tries to survive in the basement by antagonizing Tom. She is defiant toward Tom and his mother. When Summer and Amber are alone, Summer tells the weakened Amber to grab the tools hanging on the wall. Amber, at first, is delrious, not understanding what Summer means. Amber asks for "Daddy," and Summer uses that to make Amber get up and limp toward the tools. Amber, weakened, falls on the ground, hits her head on a brick, and dies.  Tom is pissed off that one of his girls died. He takes any deaths seriously. Tom's garden is special to him since his father locked him in the basement as a child that was where he first started growing his plats. Tom is told to get rid of Summer. His mother feels that keeping the garden is too dangerous since Darwin is snooping around town. Tom, angry, pins her to the table, forcing her to give in and say that he is right, before kissing her. She pushes him off, but touches herself after Tom leaves the room.  Summer is left alone in the basement. Tom searches Amber's purse, finding an old picture and a journal, which forces Tom to realize that he only has one "garden angel" left. He gives Summer water, and when she behaves he unlocks Summer from the chains and gives Summer a bath upstairs. However, she tries to run again. After that, Tom and his mother search Summer's purse and find an old letter. Whatever it is, upsets Gaia, and she goes downstairs, pulling Summer's chin back and forth before giving Summer permission to work upstairs while Tom is home. She must stay in the basement when Tom and the mother are gone.  Tom's father Gant Hoxey ([[Stephen McHattie]]) is on his way home, after calling that night that after she found the letter in Summer's purse. She sounds upset, he said, and he wants to know why.

Tom is injured in the basement after Jessie, who he tied up, manages to get the ropes off her wrist and getting a knife from her ankle and stabs him on his leg. Tom asks Summer to give Jessie water. Jessie thinks Summer and the rest of the bunch are expecting her to become a sex slave. She agrees to do anything sexual, if only to survive. Summer begs Jessie to stay quiet, obviously scared for her. Jessie begs her not to leave her alone, but she's scared of Tom and goes back upstairs.

Summer is restrained again in the basement, to Jessie. The father arrives home. He visits downstairs to see Summer.  Gant tells Summer her mother never told him about her existence, telling her that her mother told him she miscarried Summer. Summer connects the dots and realizes that Gant is her father. She came looking for her father; however, she finds a monster. Gant guts Jessie, forcing Summer to watch, after he lets Summer go upstairs. The family have a cake. Tom defies his father, informing him he is not going to take Summer. Gant makes a joke that he is in love with his sister saying that "has a hard-on" for her. The next morning, as they're all sitting down for breakfast, Gant informs them that he's going to take Summer with him. Tom insists that he isn't, that Summer is going to stay with him. They fight, and Gant belittles him, calling him a "pussy" and throwing him into the next room.  Tom walks out with a gun and threatens his father, asking if he's a man now. Gant takes the gun from Tom, shooting him to death. Summer is shocked. Tom's mother is saddened to see her son dead. Gant also shoots Gaia dead after she realizes, and says that it was Gant's plan all along - to get rid of his old family to make a new one. He tells her that she's right, and forces Summer to leave with him. Gant and Summer leave the home. They drive to a nearby park. Gant approaches a woman who is having a picnic.

Summer Wars
  Kenji Koiso ([[Ryunosuke Kamiki]]) is a young student at Kuonji High School with a gift for [[mathematics]] and a part-time [[Gamemaster#Gamemasters in online games|moderator]] in the massive computer-simulated [[virtual reality]] world OZ along with his friend Takashi Sakuma (Takahiro Yokokawa).  One day, Kenji is invited by fellow Kuonji student Natsuki Shinohara ([[Nanami Sakuraba]]) to participate in the 90th birthday of her great-grandmother Sakae Jinnouchi ([[Sumiko Fuji]]). After traveling to Sakae's estate in [[Ueda, Nagano|Ueda]], Natsuki introduces Kenji as her [[fiancé]] to Sakae, surprising them both. Kenji meets several of Natsuki's relatives and discovers that the Jinnouchis are descendants of a samurai (vassal of the [[Takeda clan]]) who challenged the [[Tokugawa clan]] in 1615. He also meets Wabisuke Jinnouchi ([[Ayumu Saitō]]), Natsuki's half-great-uncle and a computer expert who has been living in the United States since stealing the family fortune 10 years ago.  Kenji receives an e-mail with a mathematical code and cracks it. Love Machine, an [[artificial intelligence]] written by Wabisuke, uses Kenji's account and [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] the infrastructure, causing widespread damage. Kenji, Sakuma, and Natsuki's cousin Kazuma Ikezawa ([[Mitsuki Tanimura]]) confront Love Machine. Love Machine defeats Kazuma's avatar King Kazma and continues to consume accounts in the OZ mainframe, creating catastrophic [[traffic congestion]] and disabling electrical devices. Two of Sakae's relatives, Rika ([[Sakiko Tamagawa]]) and Shota Jinnouchi (Yutaka Shimizu), discover Kenji's involvement. Shota arrests Kenji, but the congestion causes Natsuki to return them to the estate.  Sakae calls associates in important positions in Japanese society and relatives who work in emergency services, encouraging them to work their hardest to reduce chaos and damage, comparing the situation to war. Kenji is able to return control of the mainframe to the moderators and engineers. Wabisuke explains that he sold the program to the [[United States Armed Forces]] for a test run. After an argument with Sakae, Wabisuke leaves the estate. Sakae later encourages Kenji to take care of Natsuki during a [[Koi-Koi]] match.  The next morning, Sakae is discovered dead by Kenji and the Jinnouchis. Her youngest son Mansaku ([[Tadashi Nakamura (voice actor)|Tadashi Nakamura]]) explains that she had [[Angina pectoris|angina]], and that Love Machine had deactivated her heart monitor. Kenji, Sakuma, and most of the Jinnouchis initiate a plan to defeat Love Machine with a [[supercomputer]] using ice blocks as a coolant, while Natsuki and the others prepare a [[funeral]] for Sakae.  Kenji, along with Sakuma and the others, capture Love Machine, but Shota carries the ice blocks to Sakae's body, causing the supercomputer to overheat. Love Machine consumes King Kazma and redirects the ''Arawashi'' Asteroid Probe onto a collision course with a [[nuclear power plant]]. Meanwhile, Natsuki discovers a [[Will (law)|will]] left by Sakae and reunites with Kenji and the rest of the group. Natsuki has Wabisuke return home before the family reads Sakae's will, asking them to bring Wabisuke back to their lives. Realizing that Love Machine sees everything as a game, Kenji has the Jinnouchis confront Love Machine to play Koi-Koi in OZ's casino world, wagering their accounts in a desperate attempt to stop Love Machine. Natsuki wins several rounds, but gets distracted and nearly loses her "winnings".  However, OZ users worldwide enter their own accounts into the wager on Natsuki's side, which also prompts the guardian programs of OZ—the blue and red whales known as John and Yoko—to upgrade Natsuki's account. Natsuki wagers the 150 million avatars given to her in a single hand and critically damages Love Machine, prompting the artificial intelligence to redirect the ''Arawashi'' towards Sakae's estate. Kenji attempts to break into the probe's GPS, while Wabisuke disables Love Machine's defenses. After being revived and assisted by several of the Jinnouchi family's avatars, King Kazma destroys Love Machine. Kenji activates the GPS code to redirect the ''Arawashi'' away from the estate, destroying the estate's entrance and causing a [[geyser]] to erupt. In the aftermath, the Jinnouchi family, celebrating their victory as well as Sakae's birthday, has Natsuki kiss Kenji after they confess their love to each other.  
Survival of the Dead
 The prologue follows the actions of [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] Sergeant "Nicotine" Crockett, who, along with Kenny, Francisco and Tomboy, desert their posts and rob the protagonists of the [[Diary of the Dead|previous film]]. Meanwhile, off the coast of [[Delaware]] lies Plum Island, home to two feuding Irish families: the O'Flynns and the Muldoons. The former family, led by Patrick O'Flynn, round up a posse to kill the [[Zombie (fictional)|undead]] on the island. O'Flynn learns that the Muldoons are keeping their undead loved ones safe until a cure is found. Tensions come to a head when O'Flynn and his posse arrive at the Muldoon house to dispatch their undead children, only to engage in a brief gunfight that leaves a woman dead as well. Unable to put the children down himself, Patrick surrenders his weapons when the Muldoon posse arrives. Seamus Muldoon contemplates killing Patrick until Patrick's daughter Janet suggests he be exiled from the island instead.  Boy joins the National Guardsmen and through him they learn of Plum Island. They watch a video made by Patrick and follow the instructions in it that leads them to a nearby dock. At the dock, O'Flynn and his men attempt to rob the Guardsmen, which results in a shootout. Francisco steals a ferry boat and bites off the finger of an attacking zombie in the process. All of the O'Flynns but Patrick are killed by zombies, and he boards the ferry. During the trip to the island, Patrick says that he sent other people to Plum Island to anger the Muldoons.  When the group reach the island they discover that the Muldoons have chained up their zombies in imitations of their previous lives. They also see that the people sent to the island by Patrick have been killed. Patrick sees his daughter Janet ride by on a horse, apparently dead and turned into a zombie. Patrick attempts to gather allies when two Muldoons attack them, shooting Crockett and Kenny. The latter dies from his wounds, and is shot in the head by Patrick to prevent reanimation. Francisco realizes that he infected himself when he bit off the zombie's finger, and asks Tomboy to shoot him to keep him from turning. Tomboy shoots him and is then captured by Muldoon.  Patrick finds out that the daughter he saw earlier was actually Janet's twin sister Jane. Janet, still alive, joins Patrick and the Guardsmen in their attack on the Muldoons. A standoff occurs at the bridge that separates the two families' land, and the O'Flynn group is captured; Boy and Janet escape. Muldoon reveals his attempts to persuade the zombies to eat something other than human flesh, and uses Jane as a test case. He tries to persuade the dead woman to bite her horse, but instead she attacks and bites her sister Janet. A melee ensues and captured zombies are released, consuming people from both sides. Muldoon and O'Flynn call a truce that is almost immediately broken when Muldoon shoots O'Flynn, who pulls a hidden gun and kills Muldoon.  Crockett and his group attempt to leave the island. Janet witnesses her sister bite the horse and rushes to tell Crockett's group the news. Patrick shoots his daughter to prevent her turning before he succumbs to his own wounds. Crockett, Boy, and Tomboy board the ferry and escape the island while the zombies are eating the horse. Crockett muses about the purpose of war as the reanimated O'Flynn and Muldoon stagger toward each other and attempt to shoot and kill each other again.  
Surviving Evil
 A team of six documentary [[filmmakers]], Sebastian "Seb" Beazley ([[Billy Zane]]), Phoebe Drake ([[Christina Cole]]), Cecilia "Chill" Reyes ([[Natalie Mendoza]]), Joey "Tito" Valencia ([[Joel Torre]]), Rachel Rice ([[Louise Barnes]]) and Dexter "Dex" Simms (Colin Moss), arrive to spend six days shooting a wilderness survival special, ''Surviving the Wilderness'', on the remote Mayaman Island, one of the seven thousand islands that make up the [[Philippine Archipelago]]. They set up camp, and it’s not long until ominous events begin to happen, eventually sparking their suspicion that the mythical [[Aswang]] creature inhabits the island.   The second day, Joey and Cecilia travel alone to the village of the Isarog tribe, where people had been savaged and one woman's corpse remains with her stomach gouged open. Determined to stay for the whole trip, Joey forces Cecilia to keep her silence among the group about the lurking danger. That night, Phoebe overhears one of their conversations and together they discuss the Aswang, detailed as a [[shape shifting]], flesh-eating, jungle tree creature of the [[Filipino folklore]], capable of procreating by altering the [[fetus]] of a pregnant woman in an evolutionary process called ''Dungo nan bunti''. The creatures' fears include staying on the ground too long and fire.  The third day, Sebastian is bitten by the Aswang and Phoebe comes across an infant corpse, as Joey and Cecilia follow map directions to a gun tower close to the Aswang’s nest. There, Cecilia finds out Joey is searching for gold to help his family. The gold and the [[treasure map]] were left behind decades ago by Joey’s grandfather who was a prisoner of the Japanese army in the [[Second World War]]. Joey detonates a hole in the tower floor and goes underground to find and obtain some of the gold. Just then, many Aswang creatures attack Cecilia, who stayed above to take cover for Joey. Cecilia falls out of sight, and when Joey returns to the surface, he is killed by the creatures, to Cecilia's horror.  The group discovers Phoebe is pregnant and the Aswang creatures are after her blood to turn her baby into one of theirs. Cecilia escapes on foot from the creatures, with Dexter eventually finding her after she calls for help. This leads to the whole group coming under attack from the creatures, but they are able to injure some of them. The group attempts to leave the island on an [[inflatable boat|inflatable raft]], but the creatures pursue them again and end up killing Dexter. At nightfall, Sebastian and Phoebe go down a ditch in the jungle; however, Sebastian badly injures himself with his machete during the fall. He tells Phoebe to run and tries to fight off the creatures, but they kill him.  By sunrise on the fourth day, Rachel and Cecilia take shelter at the gun tower. Rachel looks for Joey’s satellite phone, and one of the creatures emerges, only for Cecilia to shoot it with Joey’s gun. Rachel uses a rope to go underground, but it snaps from its wooden hinge and she falls, causing her to lose consciousness. Cecilia solely combats the entourage of creatures which fly out of its nest; however, one of them grabs her and brings her there. A handheld explosive she was preparing before she was taken detonates in the nest, killing her, a pregnant woman inside, and the creatures in the explosion. While this goes on, Phoebe escapes the island on the raft. The next day, she winds up on another island where she realizes three pregnant women are soon to give birth to more creatures. Back at the gun tower, the [[sat phone]] rings in Joey’s bag. Underground, Rachel shows signs that she is alive.  
Surrogates
 In the future, widespread use of remotely controlled [[Android (robot)|androids]] called "surrogates" allows everyone to live in idealized forms from the safety of their homes. Compared to their surrogates, the human operators are depicted as slovenly and homebound.  Protected from harm, a surrogate's operator feels no pain when the surrogate is damaged. In [[Boston]], [[FBI]] agent Tom Greer ([[Bruce Willis]]) has been estranged from his wife Maggie ([[Rosamund Pike]]), since their son's death several years before. He never sees her outside of her surrogate and she criticizes his desire to interact via their real bodies.  Tom and his partner, Agent Jennifer Peters ([[Radha Mitchell]]), investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed at a club. Jarid Canter (Shane Dzicek), one of the victims, is the son of Dr. Lionel Canter ([[James Cromwell]]), the inventor of surrogates and the former head of their manufacturing company, VSI. The two determine that a human, Miles Strickland ([[Jack Noseworthy]]), used a new type of weapon to overload the surrogates' systems and kill their operators. After locating Strickland, Tom attempts to bring him into custody. Strickland uses the weapon and injures Tom during the chase; Tom inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone known as the Dread Reservation (one of many throughout the US). A mob of humans destroys Tom's surrogate, forcing him to interact in the world without one. The Dread leader known as The Prophet ([[Ving Rhames]]) kills Strickland and confiscates the weapon.  Tom learns that VSI originally produced the weapon, designed to load a virus that overloads the surrogate's systems, thus disabling it, under a government contract. Unexpectedly, the weapon also disabled the fail-safe protocols protecting operators. The project was promptly scrapped and all prototypes supposedly destroyed. Tom also learns that Andrew Stone ([[Boris Kodjoe]]), his FBI superior, supplied the weapon to Strickland and ordered Dr. Canter's assassination, upon VSI's request, for his criticism of surrogate use. Jarid, using one of his father's many surrogates, was killed instead. Jennifer is murdered in her own home by an unknown man who hijacks her surrogate, and the Prophet orders the weapon delivered to her. During a military raid on the reservation, the Prophet is shot, revealing his identity as a surrogate, with Canter himself as the operator.  Travelling to Canter's home, Tom discovers that he has been controlling not only the Prophet, but Jennifer as well. Using Jennifer's surrogate in FBI Headquarters, Canter uses the weapon to kill Stone and proceeds to upload the virus to all surrogates, which will destroy them and kill their operators. Canter reveals that he only wanted to empower the disabled to live normal lives, but after he was fired from VSI, they capitalized on surrogacy for profit. Convinced his plan is unstoppable, Canter disconnects from Jennifer's surrogate and swallows a [[cyanide]] pill. Tom takes control of Jennifer's surrogate and, with the assistance of the network's system administrator, Bobby Saunders ([[Devin Ratray]]), insulates the virus so the operators will survive, but a second step is required to save the surrogates. Tom ultimately lets the virus permanently disable surrogates worldwide. People emerge from their homes without their surrogates, confused and afraid.  Returning home, Tom shares an emotional embrace with Maggie in her real form. The film ends with an aerial view of the collapsed surrogates along with overlapping news reports of downed surrogates all over the world and how people are now "on their own" again.  
Superman/Batman: Public Enemies
 [[Lex Luthor]] has been elected [[President of the United States]] during a severe nationwide [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]]. Under his leadership, the economy begins to thrive, and he assembles a force of government-employed superheroes consisting of [[Captain Atom]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Power Girl]], [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]], and [[Major Force]]. [[Superman]] and [[Batman]] maintain their distrust toward Luthor.  The United States government discovers that a massive [[Kryptonite]] meteor is hurtling toward Earth. Instead of asking superheroes for aid, Luthor decides to destroy it with [[nuclear missile]]s. Luthor arranges a meeting with Superman in [[Gotham City]] under the pretense of forming a pact. This results in a battle with the hired [[Metallo]] against Superman and Batman, in which Metallo manages to injure them both. After, an unknown assailant kills Metallo. On national television, Luthor pins Metallo's murder on Superman, using footage of their battle to implicate him. Luthor claims that the meteor's radiation can affect Superman's judgment, and he places a one-billion-dollar bounty on Superman.  Batman and Superman break into [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] seeking information on the meteor and find Metallo's remains; they realize radioactive energy is what killed him, and it was made to look like Superman's heat vision. An army of villains looking to collect on the bounty attacks them. Most of the villains are defeated and Captain Atom defeats the rest with a giant energy blast. All of Luthor's superhero team but Power Girl, whose loyalties are divided, attempt to capture the heroic duo. Superman creates a twister using his superspeed, and the two heroes escape with Power Girl.  In [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], Power Girl admits that she does not believe Superman killed Metallo. Luthor's superheroes catch up and the fight begins anew, Power Girl aiding Batman and Superman. Batman realizes that Major Force killed Metallo under Luthor's orders and goads him into admitting it in front of everyone. When Major Force begins angrily attacking him, Power Girl punches him in the stomach hard enough to rupture his containment suit, releasing his radiation. Captain Atom absorbs the energy, disintegrating Major Force and injuring himself in the process.  Meanwhile, the missiles fail due to the sheer amount of radiation detonating them before impact. [[Amanda Waller]] discovers that Luthor has secretly been taking a serum composed of liquid kryptonite, making him lose whatever rationality he had left. Feeling disillusioned by his failure, Luthor decides to let the meteor hit the Earth so that he may rule over what remains of society. Batman and Superman battle [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Hawkman (Carter Hall)|Hawkman]] before breaking into Luthor's base of operations to retrieve data on the meteor's radiation. Luthor refuses to relinquish the data, going so far as to erase it from the lab computers, but Waller gives them a copy. Batman and Superman fly off to [[Tokyo]] to deliver the data on the meteor to the Japanese [[Toyman]], who has already built a giant rocket-propelled [[spacecraft]], intending to use it as a large missile to stop the meteor. Waller and the military then attempt to arrest Luthor, but he injects himself with more kryptonite steroid  and dons a power suit. After escaping Waller and the military, Luthor follows Superman and Batman overseas.  After Batman and Superman arrive at Toyman's base, he shows them the spacecraft, which resembles a giant, robotic [[Composite Superman|composite version of Superman and Batman]]. With the data, Toyman is able to calculate the necessary reinforcements needed for the rocket so it will not explode before impact. Unfortunately, Luthor neutralizes Power Girl, Superman and Batman, and then disables the rocket's remote guidance systems so that it will not take off by itself. Having no other choice, Batman decides to fly the rocket himself, despite Superman's protests. Though initially faring poorly against Luthor and his kryptonite power suit, Superman eventually gains the upper hand and after an aerial chase back to Metropolis, Luthor is defeated. Batman succeeds in destroying the meteor, and Superman finds him alive in an escape pod.  With the truth of Metallo's death now public knowledge, Superman is cleared of the murder charge and Luthor is arrested and taken away to face trial and [[impeachment]] for his crimes. Batman then returns to Gotham while the ''[[Daily Planet]]'''s star journalist, [[Lois Lane]], arrives and happily embraces the Man of Steel.  
Super Rhino
 Penny and [[Bolt (Disney character)|Bolt]] have been captured by the evil Dr. Calico, suspended above a pool of lava (Calico is going to lower Penny and Bolt into the lava to kill them), inside a heavily guarded warehouse on an island in the middle of nowhere - a base which is impenetrable to both people ''and'' dogs. Penny's father watches the events from his lab through a secret camera imbedded in Bolt's collar and worries that he cannot save her. Discovering that no man or dog can break into Dr. Calico's base, he turns to Rhino, who is watching TV in the background. In order to save Penny and Bolt, Rhino is put through the same procedure as Bolt to give him super-powers.  Rhino uses his newly found powers to fly across the sea and crash land outside the armed base encased in his [[Hamster ball|ball]]. Rhino's battle with the guard is witnessed by Penny, Bolt and Dr. Calico from the inside, with helicopters and cars crashing into the side of the building. As all the noise subsides a single knock on the door is heard and not receiving an answer Rhino uses his heat-vision to create an opening in the wall.  On the inside Rhino uses his eye-beams to defeat the armed guards and commandeers a flying missile, riding it like a surfboard to aim at Dr. Calico, though the missile misses. Instead Rhino uses his ''super squeek'' ability to finish the villain off. With Penny and Bolt saved Rhino walks away.  Rhino is next seen on stage performing  "[[The Best of Both Worlds (song)|The Best of Both Worlds]]"; the theme song from ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' (by co-star [[Miley Cyrus]]), where it is revealed that Rhino has been dreaming his adventures all along.

 A man calling himself Ryder hijacks Pelham 123, a [[New York City Subway]] 6 train that departed from [[Pelham Bay Park (IRT Pelham Line)|Pelham Bay Park]] station at 1:23&nbsp;p.m. Ryder is accompanied by three other heavily armed men: Bashkin, Emri and former train operator Phil Ramos. They uncouple the front car from the rest of the train and take the passengers hostage. [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] employee Walter Garber is working the Rail Control Center as a train dispatcher and receives a ransom call from Ryder, who demands $10 million in cash be paid within 60 minutes. Ryder warns that every minute past the deadline they force him to wait, he will execute a hostage.  Bashkin kills a [[New York City Transit Police|plainclothes New York City Transit Police officer]] who approaches him after recognizing that something is amiss. He and Ramos then allow all the passengers not in the front car to be released except for the motorman. Garber reluctantly negotiates with Ryder and develops a rapport, while Ramos and Emri set up Internet access in the tunnel. Ryder uses his laptop to watch the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] plunge nearly 1,000 points during the next hour in response to the hostage-taking. One of the passenger's laptops also connects to the Internet, and the computer's [[webcam]] is activated. The webcam allows the people in the control center to observe Ryder and Ramos. Lieutenant Camonetti of the [[New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit]] enters the Rail Control Center to take over negotiations and Garber is ordered to leave the premises. The change infuriates Ryder, who shoots and kills the train's motorman in order to force Camonetti to bring Garber back. Garber blames Camonetti for the motorman's death.  Camonetti learns that Garber is being investigated for allegedly accepting a $35,000 bribe over a contract for new subway cars. Ryder also discovers the allegations through online news reports after Ramos told Ryder that Garber was a "big-shot" at the MTA and should not be dispatching trains and forces Garber to confess by threatening to kill a passenger. Garber explains that he was offered the bribe while deciding between two companies for a train contract, but also tells Ryder that he used the money to pay for his child's college tuition and insists that he would have made the same decision without the financial offer. Ryder expresses his admiration for Garber's willingness to risk himself to save a stranger. Meanwhile, the Mayor agrees to deliver the ransom money to Ryder and orders the police to deliver it. On the way to the delivery point, the police car is involved in an accident and fails to get the money there in time. Garber attempts to bluff Ryder by telling him the money has been dropped off, unaware that Ryder has been monitoring events on his laptop and knows he's being lied to. An enraged Ryder threatens to execute one of the children hostages and the child's mother. Another hostage, a former soldier, sacrifices himself to save the mother and child and is killed. A short gunfight erupts after an Emergency Services Unit police sniper is bitten by a rat and accidentally discharges his weapon, killing Ramos.  Based on clues that Garber receives during his conversations with Ryder, the police discover that Ryder's real name is Dennis Ford. He was a manager at a private equity firm before being sentenced to prison for [[securities fraud|investment fraud]]. Ford had agreed to a plea bargain for a three-year sentence, but was instead sentenced to ten years by the judge. One of the Mayor's aides mentions the extreme drop in the major stock indexes in response to the train hijacking, and the Mayor deduces that Ryder is actually attempting to manipulate the market via [[put option]]s. Ryder demands that Garber himself deliver the ransom money, and Garber is given a pistol and flown to the terminal to make the drop. Ryder brings Garber aboard and orders him to operate the train to the next station, where he and the hijackers exit the train during a brief stop. Ryder then uses a device to rig the train to go on without them. Garber manages to separate himself from Ryder at a railway crossing and then follows him as he escapes to the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria hotel]]. Ryder parts from Bashkin and Emri, who are later shot dead after being surrounded by police and provoking [[deadly force]] in an apparent [[suicide-by-cop]].  The train comes to a halt safely, and police learn that Ryder is no longer on board. Ryder hails a taxi while Garber follows him in a truck. Ryder checks his laptop and finds that his scheme has amassed a $307 million profit. He leaves the cab on the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and takes the bridge's pedestrian walkway but Garber catches up to him. Garber holds Ryder at gunpoint, and Ryder gives him a 10-second ultimatum to pull the trigger. In the final seconds of the countdown, Ryder pulls out his gun and forces Garber to shoot him. As he begins to stumble, Ryder tells Garber that he is his hero. He then collapses and dies. Afterward, the mayor thanks Garber for saving the hostages and reassures him about his bribery charges. The film concludes with Garber walking into his home carrying a bag of groceries, including a half-gallon of milk, instead of a gallon, that he promised he'd pick up on the way home to his wife.  
Taking Chances (film)
 Chase Revere manages Patriotville's history museum, the run-down town's sole tourist attraction. Having inherited a love of history from his late mother, Chase happily devotes most of his free time to maintaining the museum's exhibits, directing [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]]s on the site of a Revolutionary War battle, and preparing a proposal to expand the museum. His friend Digs, who has devoted himself to having sex with as many high school girls as possible, is disgusted at this and wants Chase to join him on the dating scene.  A group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] arrive in town, taking up temporary residence in the hotel run by Chase's father, to consider setting up a casino in Patriotville. They negotiate with the town government for a bribe by threatening to have the casino built in Sulfur Falls instead. Feeling the town needs the casino to keep from going bankrupt, the mayor resorts to taking $1,000,000 out of various town projects to fund the bribe.  Chase spots a girl, Lucy, trying to get into her father's car. She sets the interior on fire and convinces Chase to give her a ride away from the scene before he realizes what's happening. Lucy comes from Sulfur Falls and tracked her father to Patriotville after he abandoned Lucy and her mother for another woman. Though she claims to be after a family heirloom that her father took, Chase intuits that Lucy is obsessed with her father. Intrigued, he asks for her phone number.  Digs, whose father is on the town council, tells Chase about the casino deal. Chase is incensed even before learning that the proposed building site is the historical battlefield, believing that the casino will desecrate the town's culture. Digs also advises against dating Lucy, since his cousin dated her and says she is resolutely chaste. Chase and Lucy's first date seems to go well, but she firmly refuses his request for a kiss.  Chase and Lucy start a petition to put the casino issue to a vote. They meet opposition from both the government and the general citizenry, who seem convinced that the casino's financial benefits outweigh the battlefield's historical value. They tear up their fliers, call upon legal technicalities to shut down their protests, make threatening phone calls, vandalize their houses, print news articles describing them as communists, and fire Chase from the museum. Chase's father is unsupportive, and seemingly pays no attention to anything Chase says. Chase and the Native Americans maintain their budding friendship, expressing mutual respect even in their disagreement.  The mayor's wife confronts Chase and Lucy with a [[selfie]] of Lucy and the mayor having sex. A deflated Chase walks away in silence. Digs tries to stifle Chase's hopes of reconciliation by psychoanalyzing Lucy, saying her affair with the mayor is undoubtedly part of a pattern of having sex with older men and breaking the hearts of would-be "saviors" like Chase in a subconscious act of revenge against her father.  The mayor's wife tape records the mayor discussing the casino bribe and gives the tape to Lucy in retribution for his philandering. Lucy finds Chase and confesses that, much as Digs suspected, the mayor is the third married man in a position of authority who she had an affair with, but also says that she is giving up this behavior. They then have sex. She shows him the tape, and he tells her to bring it to a rally they have planned. An agent facilitating the casino deal is listening in and tells the mayor. He finds Lucy and offers to trade her father's address for the tape. Lucy gives over the tape while Chase is humiliated at the rally outside, playing for time in hopes of Lucy arriving with the tape.  Chase finally realizes that Lucy does not really care about him, that the casino's victory gave just about everyone in town what they wanted, and that he has a larger role in life than safeguarding Patriotville's "minor league" history. The Native Americans depart from Patriotville after receiving the $1,000,000 bribe and giving Chase a new name, "Chase with Plenty Horses", meaning he will go far. While cleaning their room, he finds actors' makeup and a wanted poster which clue him in that the "Native Americans" are actually con men. They left him a car as a gift, which he packs with his belongings and drives out of town. After the revelation that Patriotville is not really getting a casino, the mayor and his cohorts are imprisoned for the abuse of town funds.  
Taking Woodstock
 Set in 1969, the film follows the true story of [[Elliot Tiber]] ([[Demetri Martin]]), an aspiring [[Greenwich Village]] interior designer whose parents, Jake ([[Henry Goodman]]) and Sonia ([[Imelda Staunton]]), own the small dilapidated El Monaco Resort in [[White Lake, New York|White Lake]], in the town of [[Bethel, New York]]. A [[hippie]] theater troupe, The Earthlight Players, rents the barn, but can hardly pay any rent. Due to financial trouble, the motel may have to be closed, but Elliot pleads with the local bank not to foreclose on the mortgage and Sonia delivers a tirade about her struggles as a Russian refugee. The family is given until the end of the summer to pay up.  Elliot plans to hold a small musical festival, and has, for $1, obtained a permit from the town's chamber of commerce (of which he is also the president). When he hears that the organizers of the [[Woodstock Festival]] face opposition against the originally planned location, he offers his permit and the motel accommodations to organizer [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]] ([[Jonathan Groff]]). A neighbor, [[Max Yasgur]] ([[Eugene Levy]]), provides his nearby farm land; first they agree on a fee of $5,000, but after realizing how many people will come, Yasgur demands $75,000, which the organizers reluctantly accept. Elliot comes to agreement about the fee for the motel more smoothly. Initial objections by his mother quickly disappear when she sees the cash paid in advance.  Elliot and Yasgur encounter a little bit of expected opposition. The local diner refuses to serve Elliot anymore, inspectors target the motel (and only his) for building code violations, and some local boys paint a [[swastika]] and hate words on the motel. However, resistance quickly dissolves in the tidal wave of peace and love (and commerce) brought to the area. The Tiber family works hard serving the massive influx of visitors and become wealthy in the process. A cross-dressing veteran, Vilma ([[Liev Schreiber]]), is hired as a security guard. Elliot also struggles with hiding his homosexuality from his family, when he connects romantically with one of the event organizers staying at the motel.  On the first day of the concert, Elliot, his father, and Vilma hear the music begin in the distance. Elliot's father, transformed and enlivened by all the new life in town, tells Elliot to go and see the concert. Elliot hitches a ride through the peaceful traffic jam on the back of a benevolent [[New York State Police|state trooper's]] motorcycle and arrives at the event. There, he meets a hippie couple ([[Paul Dano]] and [[Kelli Garner]]), who invite him to join them on an [[LSD#Psychological|LSD trip]] in their [[Volkswagen Type 2#In counterculture|VW Bus]] a short distance from the crowd. Elliot has trouble relaxing at first, but gradually melts into a psychedelic union with them. When they finally emerge after sundown, Elliot watches the vast crowd and brilliant lights of the distant concert ripple with harmonious hallucinatory visuals that swell into serene white light.  Elliot returns home from his liberating experience and has breakfast with his parents. He suggests to his mother that they now have enough money to replace him, but she cannot bear to let him have his freedom. Elliot storms out, facetiously suggesting his mom eat the [[hash brownies]] Vilma has just offered. After another beautiful day at the festival, during which his friend the Vietnam veteran, Billy ([[Emile Hirsch]]), appears to overcome his [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], Elliot returns home to find his parents laughing and cavorting hysterically, having eaten Vilma's hash brownies. The once-brittle family (particularly Sonia) is united in joy and delirious affection.  The next morning, however, Sonia inadvertently reveals that she has secretly saved $97,000 in cash in the floorboards of her closet. Elliot is upset that his mother hid this from him while he put his own savings into helping his parents.  After the final day of the concert, Elliot decides to move to California as he packs up his things and says farewell to his father, after his father encourages him to strike out on his own. As Elliot pays one last visit to the concert and looks out over the muddy desolation of the Yasgur farm, Lang rides up on horseback and they marvel at how despite the obstacles, the event was a success. Lang mentions his next big project: staging a truly free concert in San Francisco with the [[Rolling Stones]]—the infamous [[Altamont Free Concert]].  
Talentime
 "''The music teacher, who is herself a great performer is organising an inter-school [[Talent show|talentime]]. Through the days of auditions, rehearsals and preparations, running up to the big day of the contest, the characters get embroiled in a world of heightened emotions - ambition, jealousy, human comedy, romance, heartbreak - all of which culminate in a day of great music and performances.'' Yasmin also mentioned that ''the idea behind ''Talentime'' was that as humans, we have to go through a lot of pain and some measure of suffering before we can reach greater heights.''<ref></ref>  A talent search competition has matched two hearts - that of Melur, a Malay-mixed girl and an Indian male student, Mahesh. Melur, with her melodious voice, singing whilst playing the piano is one of the seven finalists of the Talentime competition of her school organised by Cikgu Adibah. Likewise Hafiz, enthralling with his vocalist talent while playing the guitar, dividing his time between school and mother, who is hospitalised for brain tumor.  It all started after Mahesh, amongst the students assigned to get the finalists to school for practice, delivered the notice of successful audition to Melur's house. His handsome looks attracted the girl. Early on of their relationship, tragedy struck Mahesh's family when his uncle Ganesh who had been the care-taker of the family since the loss of Mahesh's father, was stabbed to death on his wedding day. Melur thinking that Mahesh's silence was due to his grief over the tragedy became furious when she was continuously ignored. She regretted it however after Hafiz revealed Mahesh's situation.  That changed Melur's perception of Mahesh. Likewise Mahesh, who grew comfortable with the presence of the girl who often quotes beautiful poetry. Mahesh, realising that the relationship will be opposed, kept it hidden from his mother, still grieving over the death of Ganesh. Alas, the secret was exposed and Mahesh was assaulted before Melur's very eyes. Just a day before the competition, is Melur resilient enough to sing the poetic lyrics of her song when her heart is tormented by the thoughts of Mahesh? What about Mahesh who has found his first love? On Talentime night, everything unfolds.  
Taking Chance
  The film opens on a black screen, with white letters describing the date and place, as we hear radio chatter about a "suspicious vehicle" followed by the sound of an explosion and gunfire.  We then cut to see two Marines driving, wearing dress blue uniforms, to an unmarked house in the middle of the night and knocking on the door. Finally, we cut to Colonel [[Michael Strobl]] (played by [[Kevin Bacon]]) searching on his computer the casualty report for the [[Middle East]]. After a couple clips of Michael running through the woods, service members' coffins getting put into an airplane, and some driving, we find the Lt. Col. at work giving a presentation to several other Marines. The Lt. Col. makes his way home with his family for a short while, then the camera cuts to five Marines in woodland MarPat camouflage taking US Flag-draped coffins off of an airplane in the rain. After a short clip of the Lt. Col. eating dinner with his family, we find him looking at the casualty report yet again but this time he writes down some information. The movie then cuts to him in an interview with a higher ranking Marine and he asks to escort a Marine named PFC (Private First Class) Chance Phelps. He says it is because the PFC is from his hometown, and then we see him discuss his choice with his wife. After he explains that he is doing this only because the PFC is from his hometown and has no other meaning, the film cuts to several people doing medical procedures on a dead body which one can assume to be PFC Phelps. After the morticians are shown, the film then cuts to the Lt. Col. leaving and telling his wife goodbye.  He then arrives at Dover Port Mortuary where he gets his instructions along with other Marines on how to go about escorting a fallen Marine. After the instruction, all the service member escorts who are awaiting their turn to depart head outside and render honors as each of them departs. The Lt. Col. is informed that Phelps isn't ready to be transported due to the amount of casualties. He checks into a hotel room and the next day does an inventory, with another Marine, of Phelps' personal items including: a cross on a string, a [[Saint Christopher]] necklace, a wristwatch, and Phelps' [[dog tags]]. He is told that PFC Phelps's private effects are not to leave his side, under any circumstances. The Lt. Col. then verifies that the body in the van is in fact the PFC and then begins his drive to the airport where he has a talk with Rich Brewer (played by [[John Magaro]]) of the Dover Port Mortuary. They talk about the military and how the driver knew two men from his high school who enlisted, one of whom returned after sustaining severe injuries (who is recovering at Walter Reed), and the other who was killed. Lt. Col. Strobl arrives at the airport, where he first renders honors to the PFC as he is offloaded to a cargo area, before saying a curbside goodbye to the driver (telling him, he's "a good man"). Lt. Col. Strobl heads to the check-in counter, where the ticketing agent tells him that he has been upgraded to [[First class (aviation)|First Class]]. As he goes through security, he tells a somewhat annoyed TSA agent that he can't put Phelps' personal items into the x-ray scanner (because they are not allowed to leave his side at any time for any reason). He also says that he won't take off his Marine Dress Uniform Jacket to go through the metal detector because it would degrade the uniform. Eventually he is screened in private, with the TSA agent using a metal-detector wand, while the Lt. Col. holds on to the PFC's personal effects in his hand. He then renders honors to the PFC again as the coffin is loaded onto the airplane. On board, the man next to him in first class orders a Jack Daniels, and he orders a water, after which the man asks him "What, are you on duty?" He replies, "Yes, I am," and they take off. While in the air the flight attendant hands him a [[crucifix]] and tells him that she wants him to have it.  A few hours later, the plane touches down and Strobl and the PFC's casket wait to change flights in Minneapolis. After the casket is unloaded, Strobl requests to stay with the casket overnight in the airport's cargo area. Despite reservations from the foreman, his request is granted; one of the workers offers him a sleeping bag from his jeep. During this time, Strobl meets a U.S. Army Sergeant of the 1st Cavalry Division who he recognized from the Dover Port Mortuary. The sergeant tells Strobl that he is escorting his deceased brother home. The following morning, the PFC's casket is loaded onto a Northwest Airlines flight as the baggage handlers and even the flight captain pay their respects. On this flight, Lt. Col. Strobl sits next to a young woman who cheerily offers him a magazine to read, and also texts someone that she is sitting next to a "HOT soldier," which Lt. Col. Strobl happens to catch a glimpse of and corrects her that he is actually a Marine. Upon landing, the airliner captain, a retired U.S. Air Force officer and former [[A-10]] attack jet pilot in the first Persian Gulf War, makes a special announcement, asking for the other passengers to remain seated so that Lt. Col. Strobl has a chance to deplane first and render honors for PFC Phelps as his casket is unloaded. The woman sitting next to the Lt. Col, who had no idea he was on an escort mission for a fallen Marine, is visibly touched, and apologizes for potentially being insensitive with her earlier actions; Lt. Col. Strobl instead warmly thanks her for her company.  After unloading, Lt. Col. Strobl is greeted by the funeral director, and they load PFC Phelp's casket for the final part of his journey. Along the way, an impromptu funeral procession forms along the highway, as people in passing cars see Lt. Col. Strobl and realize what the hearse is carrying. After arriving in the town where PFC Phelps's parents reside, the Lt. Col. is greeted by a younger fellow Marine, who along with a partner had driven up from Salt Lake City a few days earlier to inform PFC Phelps's family of his death. The men proceed into the funeral home, where the younger Marine suggests that this would be a good time to place some personal items that PFC Phelps's family had asked him to place into the casket; Lt. Col. Strobl agrees, and despite it being a closed casket ceremony, insists that he wants to make sure PFC Phelps's uniform is correct and in place. As the men open the casket, both Marines have a strong, emotional reaction to seeing PFC Phelps; Lt. Col. Strobl remarks that even though the staff at Dover Port Mortuary knew it was going to be a closed casket ceremony, they still made every effort to make sure that PFC Phelps was prepared and dressed perfectly.  Later that evening, a memorial event is held at the local VFW, to which Lt. Col. Strobl was invited earlier. The local veterans, along with PFC Phelps's sergeant (who was with him when he was killed) and others, all welcome Lt. Col. Strobl with sincere gratitude for "bringing Chance home." They reminisce about Chance's outgoing personality, and recount some war stories of his, including, eventually later in the evening, the sergeant's story of what happened the day that PFC Phelps was killed (apparently in the firefight following the IED attack on their convoy, heard at the beginning of the film, in which PFC Phelps was the gunner on a machine gun and was able to draw the focus of much of the enemy fire, allowing for his comrades to safely find cover for themselves). As the attendees of the memorial leave at the end of the evening, Lt. Col. Strobl remarks to the U.S. Marine 1st. Division Korean War veteran who first introduced himself at the bar, that he was eligible for a tour of duty in Iraq himself, but instead "got used to the sight of his wife and kids" and put in an application for an office tour instead, which was granted. Even though Lt. Col Strobl is a recipient of the Marine Combat Action Ribbon from his service in the First Gulf War, he feels somewhat ashamed of his actions, to which the Korean War veteran reminds him that there is no shame in loving his family, and that he is not any less of a Marine than PFC Phelps or his sergeant or any of the other men serving in combat in Iraq, because now, he is a witness for PFC Phelps, having served this escort mission, and he is now responsible in no small part for PFC Phelps's legacy.  Prior to the funeral the next day, Lt. Col. Strobl meets PFC Phelps's family for the first time, and makes a point of mentioning that PFC Phelps was treated with great care and dignity across his entire journey. He hands over PFC Phelps's personal effects, as well as a letter from PFC Phelps's platoon leader. He finally leaves them with the cross that was given to him by a flight attendant, saying that eventually he realized it wasn't really given to him, only that he was carrying it for them. With the father's voiceover reading the platoon leader's letter in the background, we see PFC Phelps receive a funeral with full military honors, and his divorced parents are each presented with a flag, "on behalf of the President, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and a grateful nation," honoring their son. As the attendees all pay their respects, Lt. Col. Strobl renders one final salute as the last one left at the ceremony. The film ends as Lt. Col. Strobl reminisces about his experience, saying that despite the fact he didn't know PFC Chance Phelps prior to his death, somehow after escorting him home and laying him to rest, he now misses him. We then see Lt. Col. Strobl returning home and embracing his wife and children, as the final shot of the film reveals that the mailbox of the unknown house depicted at the beginning of the film says "Phelps."

Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike
 Using the power of a powerful substance known as aer, mankind is in an age of discovery and prosperity. The crystallized form of aer, which is known as Apatheia, is considered to be a very powerful energy source as it is essential to human life. To protect towns from attacks by monsters, large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns. One day, in a forest near the town of Shizontania, [[Yuri Lowell]] and [[List of Tales of Vesperia characters#Flynn Scifo|Flynn Scifo]], two knights who have just joined the Niren Corps, together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members, Hisca and Chastel, are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area.  After their first assignment to help in destroying a monster infestation near the town, Yuri, Flynn, Hisca, and Chastel meet the leader of the local guild, Melzome Kaid. Niren, the captain of the knights stationed in Shizontania, was once dedicated to following the letter of the rules and regulation of the knights. However, he attributes the death of his wife and daughter to this trait, saying that if he had defied orders, he may have been able to protect them. The knights' efforts to repel the monsters around the area prove to be in vain. Despite being called by Commandant Alexei to attend a formal gathering at the imperial capital of Zaphias, Niren sends Flynn in his stead to attend the gathering and to request aid in defending the town. Niren and Chastel leave in search of a "strange blastia expert" named Rita Mordio. Yuri and Hisca are left to care for Lambert, Niren's personal hound, and Repede, Lambert's son. Niren succeeds in finding Rita Mordio and obtaining a device with which to return the aer to normal. Flynn is admonished by Commandant Alexei, and his request for reinforcements to hold Shizontonia is denied until the end of the gathering. Yuri and Hisca assist in defending the town against a strange monster made out of aer, and while they successfully repel the invasion, the monster takes control of Lambert along with two other wardogs. As Lambert rages out of control, Yuri is forced to kill him to protect Hisca.  When Flynn returns from Zaphias, he and Yuri come to blows, as each believes the other had an effortless assignment. Meanwhile, a platoon of high-ranking knights from central are seen in the forest being slaughtered by monsters. One survives and flees to Shizontonia's front gate, where he delivers a report to an unseen individual in the city. Niren, upon receiving the news that reinforcements would not be arriving anytime soon, decides to take the knights to investigate the source of the aer, which he believes to be a fortress at the center of a nearby lake. Flynn disagrees with Niren's decision, viewing it as disobedience of a direct order.  Garista, the strategist for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren but to no avail. The investigation in the fortress turns out to be more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way into the center of the fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.  The knights and the entire town mourn over Niren's death. Flynn realizes that the blastia used in the fortress where the aer abnormality originated, along with the piece he spotted on the floor, were a specialized type used only by Garista. Yuri and Flynn confront Garista with this information, and Garista reveals that he was attempting to illegally create a new kind of blastia, but failed and decided to leave the blastia to destroy itself, therefore destroying Shizontonia and killing any and all witnesses. Yuri and Flynn attempt to arrest Garista, but a fight ensues and Yuri kills him. In the aftermath, Shizontonia is evacuated due to the failure of the barrier blastia. Yuri leaves the knights, taking Niren's blastia as a keepsake and bringing Repede along with him, saying his goodbyes to everyone in the town. Flynn sees him off at the gates, and the two share a fond farewell, swearing to meet again one day.

Tekken (2009 film)
   ===Setting===  In the late 2010s, after the Terror War has destroyed much of civilization, 8 [[megacorporation]]s survived and divided up the world around them; the biggest being Tekken Corporation, which controls [[North America]]. In order to placate the masses, the corporation's Chairman, [[Heihachi Mishima]], sponsors the King of Iron Fist Tournament, or ''Iron Fist'' - in which fighters from the 8 corporations battle until one is left standing and receives a lifetime of stardom and wealth. In contrast to the rich and lush Tekken City, there is the slum area surrounding it, referred to as the Anvil.  ===Story===  [[Jin Kazama]], Kazuya's son has been raised by his mother, Jun, She has trained him in martial arts and has been a mentor, yet she never speaks of Jin's father, claiming he is dead. In 2039, Jin is now a rebellious 19-year-old teenage fighter and contraband runner who lives in the Anvil, and usually goes into fights and cooperates with the resistance groups to earn money to provide food (fruit, coffee and chocolate have become expensive and rare commodities in the Anvil). One night, Jin is targeted by the Jackhammers, the elite specs group that patrols the Anvil and ensures the safety of Tekken City, for cooperating with the resistance groups. He tries to return to his home, only to find his mother, Jun, killed by the Jackhammers bombarding the house.  Grieving the loss of his mother and feeling guilty that he had not protected her, Jin swears revenge against Heihachi. In the ruins of his former home, he finds a ''Tekken'' Fighter I.D. belonging to Jun, revealing she was once an Iron Fist fighter. Furious about this, he decides to try out at the Open Call, which lets the Anvil pick a fighter for the tournament. After defeating the disgraced [[Marshall Law (Tekken)|Marshall Law]], who was dropped out of the Tournament and forced to fight in the Open Call, Jin is sponsored by former boxer [[Steve Fox (Tekken)|Steve Fox]], sponsor of the Open Call and former Iron Fist fighter, and is hailed "The People's Choice", who takes him to Tekken City.  Upon entering Tekken City, Jin befriends mixed martial artist [[Christie Monteiro]]. After witnessing [[Raven (Tekken)|Raven]] overpower Capoeira fighter [[Eddy Gordo]] in the first match, Jin wins the match against Miguel Caballero Rojo, nearly killing him in a fit of rage. Heihachi's son, [[Kazuya Mishima]], is impressed and offers Jin a place in Tekken Corp., but Jin refuses. Later that night, after sneaking out with Christie and visiting a nightclub, Jin is attacked by masked assassins, on the orders of Kazuya, who is scheming to take over Tekken and sees Jin as a possible obstacle since he is hailing as People's Choice. Jin survives the assassination attempt, thanks to Christie's interference. Steve and Christie attempt to discourage Jin from continuing in the tournament, but Jin vows to win Iron Fist and kill both Heihachi and Kazuya, and he gives Fox Jun's ID, he realizes he is her son, telling him that he knew her. Meanwhile, Kazuya blackmails the tournament's champion, Bryan Fury, into killing Jin in a match or be exposed as a partial cyborg, banning him from the tournament for life (cyborgs are banned from fighting).  During the quarter-finals, Christie is paired with Nina Williams. But before the fight, Jin notices Nina's face, she was one of the assassins. After Christie defeats Nina, Jin is matched up with an elite swordsman named [[Yoshimitsu]]. Heihachi, liking this young fighter, deems that this match be reserved for the semi-finals and attempts to change the order, but Kazuya, who controls the Jackhammers, stops him. Kazuya then has Heihachi imprisoned and orders the match to begin, effectively seizing control of Tekken. Jin narrowly defeats Yoshimitsu, thanks to Heihachi tripping a security alert in the arena.  Following the match, Kazuya orders all of the fighters to be detained. He tells them that the rules have changed, and so they must now fight to the death. Jin, Christie, and Steve try to escape, along with Raven, leaving Nina & Anna Williams and Sergei Dragunov behind, since they were in a separate cell. Kazuya notices them escaping and brings down some guards, causing a firefight. Steve, Christie, and Raven cover Jin but he walks across Heihachi's cell. Angry, he tries to taunt him, saying he is responsible for killing his mother. However, because Heihachi is their only chance of escaping Tekken, Steve frees Heihachi and joins the group. On the gunfight, Raven is wounded and recaptured, while the others make it out to the Anvil.  In the warehouse that Jin uses as protection, Heihachi reveals to Jin the true nature of his origin. 20 years ago, Jun was fighting in the first Iron Fist tournament placed by the Tekken Corporation after the war, and she impressed Kazuya, who raped her, making him Jin's father, and left her for dead. She survived the assault and Heihachi took her out of Tekken City to the Anvil to keep her alive. Heihachi also tells Jin that since he is Heihachi's grandson, he could become the next Chairman. He also states the corporation's true purpose is to restore order to the world, though Jin can't believe what he is being told, believing that the corporation is spreading terror and fear to its residents. Heihachi entrusts Jin with the task of defeating Kazuya. Later on, the group is located by Jackhammers, who kill Steve Fox in a firefight and recapture the rest of the escapees. Before taking them back to Iron Fist, Kazuya orders the Jackhammers to execute Heihachi.  Back in Tekken City, Raven comforts a dispirited Jin, saying that he saw what Jin did to Miguel Rojo and reminding him that anger doesn't fuel the soul, but incinerates it. Raven tells Jin that because there are many people depending on him, he can become champion without letting anger take control of his body. In the Finals, Jin is forced to fight against Bryan Fury, who had already killed Sergei Dragunov in a death match, while Kazuya holds Christie in the control room. At first he is outmatched, but remembering his mother's teachings, Jin kills Bryan.  Angered about Jin's victory, Kazuya enters the tournament himself, armed with half moon axes, and begins the final match. The weaponless Jin is battered and is about to lose. He is saved, though, when Christie escapes by shooting the Jackhammers guarding her, creating a distraction. This allows Jin to wound and pin Kazuya, who baits Jin by claiming that he remembers how Jun "put up quite a fight." Kazuya taunts him into inheriting the Mishima Curse (Heihachi imprisoned and killed his father and Kazuya presumably murdered Heihachi), but Jin refuses to kill his father, stating that it is not his curse.  Christie comes to the stage and declares Jin the new Champion of Tekken. Elated, the crowd both in and outside the arena cheer for him. When Christie asks where he will go, he replies that he will go home to the Anvil, since he doesn't want to run the corporation. He walks out of Tekken City's gate and is saluted by the Jackhammers - symbolizing his new role as CEO of Tekken Corp. In a voiceover, Christie explains that Jin's victory made the Kazama family name synonymous with hope in the Anvil, but that the true legacy of ''Tekken'' is only beginning.  After the credits, the scene shifts to Kazuya, who walks out of the arena and realizes that he lost control of the Jackhammers, who refuse to salute him. Back at Heihachi's execution, he kneels in front of a Jackhammer, who is holding him at gunpoint. His final words are: "I am Heihachi Mishima. I...am...Tekken. You will obey."  The Jackhammer lowers down his gun and obeys his command.

The Telling (film)
 In the prologue, Brianna ([[Najarra Townsend]]), after being harshly rejected from a sorority, is found dead at a party from [[Overdose|overdosing]] on prescription drugs and alcohol. Scrawled in lipstick on a nearby mirror are the words "You made me do this."  One year later, the most exclusive and cruel sorority on campus, headed by Stephanie ([[Holly Madison]]), is in the final days of rush. For their final task, the three remaining pledges are required to tell the scariest story they know.   The first pledge, Tonya ([[Jessica Noboa]]), tells a true story she heard from a friend. Lily ([[Rebekah Kochan]]), is a beautiful blonde that lives with her boyfriend Tommy ([[Ryan Freeman]]) and his ex-girlfriend, Sarah, from [[England]]. Tommy works at a coffee shop, and finds a doll in a dumpster one day, which he brings home to Lily. At first, Lily thinks that Sarah has done something to the doll to mess with her. The doll kills Sarah first, stabbing her to death, then electrocutes Lily. The story ends with Tonya saying Tommy was convicted for the murders and was put away for life. The girls think that the story is good and take a shot.  The second story, told by Phoebe ([[Stephanie Sanborn]]), is about a former A-list actress, Eva DeMarco ([[Bridget Marquardt]]), who wants to be back on top. So she accepts a role from an elusive filmmaker ([[John D'Aquino]]) in a desolate region in Romania. But this isn't just any ordinary film, the film crew has a deadly secret. Eva is drugged and has a dream where she's in a jail cell and killed by an angel with black wings ([[Christine Nguyen]]). When she wakes up, she goes to a dinner party for the shoot of the movie, where she discovers that all of the crew members are dead, and that they make snuff films. Eva is killed and becomes the newest member of the group. Similarly, the sorority girls like Phoebe's story and take another shot.  Finally, it is Haley's ([[Jean-Louise O'Sullivan]]) turn. She tells a story about a group of three girls, based on Stephanie, Amber, and Roxy. The story begins at the girls' home; the girls are about to go see a movie while their cable is being fixed. The girls come back home after one of them forgot to buy tickets in advance. Another girl suggests making prank calls. They call a man and tell him that he has won seven free pizzas. During the call, the man goes to answer the door and is killed. The girls overhear the man being killed and hesitantly call the police. The girls don't trust the cop who shows up, since he is by himself. After s killing spree occurs, Anna is the last one left, and kills the cop out of terror, thinking he is the killer. After shooting him five times, she walks into the hallway, where the real killer is. She is promptly killed.   After all of the girls tell their stories, it is time for the sorority sisters to make their decision. But not everyone is happy with the decision, and not all of them make it out to tell the tale. First, Stephanie reveals the two newest members selected for their sorority are two other girls, Stacie and Rachel, who were inducted in a private rush separate from the official rush that Tonya, Phoebe, and Haley just underwent. Stephanie derides the three pledges for thinking that they could become members of the sorority. But then the sorority sisters start feeling the ill effects of the poisoned cookies provided by Haley. Haley, who turns out to be Brianna's half-sister, became a pledge solely to get close enough to the sorority (that she blames for Brianna's suicide) to kill them. She walks away from the sorority house, accompanied by her mother.  
Teenage Dirtbag (film)
 At a local IGA store, a pregnant woman is shocked to learn from an old classmate that a boy she once knew named Thayer died in a river recently. When going back to her car, the woman has a flashback of her time in high school.  The woman is Amber Lange, once a popular cheerleader in high school. Thayer Mangeres is a classmate who always sat beside Amber because of their last names. In class, they are dissecting a fetal pig. When it's time to clean up, Thayer asks people around their table how much they will bet him if he drinks the juice from the fetus. As everyone is putting their money on the table, Amber looks disgusted. Thayer then tells everybody to keep their money, implying that he won't drink it, but he then says he will for free. After the bet, Thayer asks what Amber thought. She tells him that she thinks nothing of him. Ever since that day, he's harassed her.  The next year they are put in Creative Writing and Study Hall together, which class Thayer skips to get high with his friend. For the next couple of days, it's hard for Amber and Thayer to get along. At a party that night, he eats fish that she caught earlier that day from a bowl. Very angry, Amber continually pushes Thayer and asks him why he is such a freak.  Thayer continues to harass Amber in class as a new girl named Tabitha is assigned a seat by them. Eventually Tabitha and Thayer form a friendship, and, knowing that he does not like Amber and bullies her, she does the same. By the soda machine, Thayer flirts with Tabitha, unbeknownst to Tabitha that he is doing this to make Amber jealous. When Amber walks away peeved, he stops, clearly wanting Amber's attention all along. After school, Thayer walks home. He walks in and his father shouts angrily that he got a call from the school about his actions and does not want another call from them. Thayer is frightened by his dad, and his father calls in Thayer's brother Dooley, who physically abuses him, to hold him down while his dad whips him. On the same night, Amber walks into her home, but no one is there.  Back in Creative Writing, Thayer starts to show his emotions in his poems, and Amber realizes this because she feels exactly the same way. Thayer begins a friendship with Amber by asking her questions by writing in his notebook. As their friendship progresses, so do Thayer's feelings. Thayer begins to fall in love with Amber the more they talk. During class, Thayer sends Amber signals in his poems. As Amber hears these poems in class, she knows they are about her. She's not sure if she feels the same about him because of their different social groups, although she has strange dreams of kissing him.  Thayer and Amber's lives and homes are different, even though they are both experiencing trouble. Thayer is struggling at home with his family. His dad beats him and his drunk brother does the same, but he and his sister Jeannie are very compassionate toward each other. Amber is mostly alone when her parents are gone. At a sandbar one night, Amber has sex with a school friend as Thayer secretly watches. Feeling betrayed, Thayer writes another poem about Amber, but this time it's about the night before. He starts to act rudely to her again and harasses her verbally. When the teacher realizes that he's insulting one of the students, he takes Thayer outside. Tabitha accuses Amber of being jealous of her and Thayer's "relationship." Amber, ticked off, takes out Thayer's notebook and throws it onto Tabitha's desk. After looking at a few pages, Tabitha runs out of the classroom. Everyone rushes to see the notebook, all while Amber sits there. Her life turns back to normal because she doesn't associate with him anymore. One day in the hallway, Thayer and Amber accidentally meet up. Thayer begins to yell at her, and questions why she gave away their notebook. After being nose to nose, literally, Thayer walks away without an answer from her. Amber screams, "Because I hate you!"  Thayer still has feelings for Amber, so after Tabitha mischievously attempts to spill purple nail polish in Amber's book bag, he grabs her wrist. After eating four brown tablets which Thayer tells Amber are drugs, which she doesn't believe, Thayer convulses and has a seizure on the floor. The whole class has to leave the room and Amber watches through the window as Thayer becomes unconscious. After the overdose, Thayer never returns to school. Amber's world returns to normal. Years later, while shopping, Amber meets Thayer again and is surprised to learn that he has joined the Mormon faith because he had been so rebellious in school.  The scene switches back to the present. Amber is at home calling up old schoolmates trying to find out exactly how Thayer died. No one is really sure how Thayer died, but Amber finds out that his father and brother died suspiciously, and no one seems to know where his sister is.  The scene changes again to another old memory. Amber meets Thayer again at the beach. She questions him about his Mormon mission and he informs her that he left early, to which she replies, "you don't look very Mormon." Thayer evades her questions by changing the subject. Eventually, Amber informs him that she is getting married; Thayer remains silent for a second and then starts talking about how easy it would be to fake his own death. Amber debates with him a little bit telling him that she would know that he wasn't dead, to which he smirks and says, "No, you wouldn't," and walks off.  The scene briefly switches back to the present and then to another memory when Thayer follows Amber into the bathroom of a movie theatre the same day of the beach meeting. He argues with her, trying to get her to admit her feelings, but she denies it and pretends that she doesn't know what he's talking about.  Amber eventually finds Thayer's sister Jeannie and visits her. She then visits the school and finishes writing in the old notebook she pulled out from her closet. She admits defeat, stating that she'll never know whether he was alive or truly dead. The movie ends with a scene of Jeannie looking in on Amber in a hospital room, where Amber has just given birth to a baby boy named Thayer.  
Teer enta
 A didactic man who works as a vet named Baheeg (Ahmed Mekky) is in love with a girl named Laila (Donia Samir Ghanem), who brings her dog into his clinic from time to time. Baheeg is a very goofy guy and is unable to grasp her attention. All is going poorly until Mared, a genie who is trying to pass his "genie exams", comes along and grants Baheeg wishes to attempt to captivate the girl of his dreams. Mared transforms Baheeg into different people, in different shapes and forms in order to make Leila fall in love with him. All his attempts seem to fail, but ends up helping Mared to graduate genie school by signing a paper. Laila’s dog bends up becoming sick and Laila takes it to Baheeg, who is (at this point) his true self. They end up getting married. Throughout a comedic, yet anticipating story, we see how all fails when one attempts to be someone that they are not, and that receiving help from a friend can benefit one even if that was not the initial intention.  
Terminator Salvation
 In 2003, Dr. Serena Kogan (Carter) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces [[death row]] inmate Marcus Wright (Worthington) to sign over his body for medical research following his execution. [[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines|One year later]], the automated [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] system is activated and becomes self-aware; perceiving humans as a threat to its existence, it starts a [[nuclear holocaust]] to eradicate them in the event known as "Judgment Day".  In 2018, [[John Connor]] (Bale) leads an attack on a Skynet base, where he discovers human prisoners and schematics for incorporating living tissue to a new type of [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]], the T-800. John survives an explosion on the base, which is destroyed. Following John's departure, Marcus emerges from the base's wreckage and begins walking towards [[Los Angeles]].   John returns to the Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Hugh Ashdown (Ironside) that the Resistance has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol which they believe can initiate a permanent shutdown of Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the Resistance plans to launch an offensive against Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco. It is decided among the Resistance that the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet, which plans to terminate the Resistance's command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following [[Kyle Reese]] (Yelchin). The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows that Kyle will eventually travel back in time and become his father (as seen in ''[[The Terminator]]''), and realizes that Skynet has learned of this fact.  Arriving at the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus encounters Kyle and a mute child named Star (Berry) during a skirmish with Skynet's machines where Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by Skynet. Two Resistance [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]] airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Wright locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Bloodgood). They then make their way to John's base, where thereafter, Marcus is wounded by a magnetic [[land mine]]. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is actually a [[cyborg]], with a mechanical [[endoskeleton]] and a partially artificial [[cerebral cortex]]. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John and his wife Kate (Howard) think that Marcus has been sent to execute him and orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in [[San Francisco]], to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets him live.  John pleads with General Ashdown to delay the offensive so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdown's orders and instead, await John's signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables [[perimeter defense]]s so that Connor can infiltrate the [[cellblock]] and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was resurrected and built into a machine to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed to be a ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard.  Marcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new [[Terminator (character)|T-800 (Model 101) Terminator]] (Kickinger). Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John comes to his aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers his own heart for [[heart transplantation|transplantation]], sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over.  
Tenure (film)
 Charlie Thurber ([[Luke Wilson]]) is a beleaguered English professor at fictional Grey College who competes for [[tenure]] against an impressive new hire from [[Yale]], Elaine Grasso ([[Gretchen Mol]]).  Jay Hadley ([[David Koechner]]) is an anthropology professor at Grey who tries to convince Thurber to sabotage Grasso’s career – while being simultaneously obsessed with trying to prove the authenticity of [[Bigfoot]]. Thurber's articles are rejected by a series of academic journals and he worries about becoming a victim of the "[[publish or perish]]" pressures of professorship. And despite competing for the same job, Thurber and Grasso begin developing a friendship after she flounders as a classroom teacher and asks him for advice.  Meanwhile, Thurber struggles with a series of personal problems: his sister pesters him for money to pay for their father's retirement home; a smitten female student is aggressively flirtatious; and rather than admit he's single, Thurber hires a woman of questionable sanity to act as his girlfriend for a dinner with Grasso and her snobbish boyfriend.  Thurber's tenure review with college officials seems to be a disaster until the dean casts a tie-breaking vote, noting that Thurber's students gave him exemplary reviews and clearly adore him. Thurber is offered probational tenure, with the caveat that his classroom teaching will be severely reduced so that he can devote more time to publishing in respectable academic outlets.  The film concludes with Thurber inviting his ailing father to move in with him, Grasso dumping her boyfriend and hinting that she would like to pursue a relationship with Thurber, and Thurber quitting Grey College to teach at a high school so that he can remain in the classroom with students.

The Terminators (film)
 The film takes place at an undetermined point in the future, when humanity has developed advanced robotic technology with enhanced artificial intelligence. This includes the use of cybernetic organisms (or ''cyborgs'') called the TR-4 (all TR-4s are played by [[Paul Logan (actor)|Paul Logan]]) for general labor. After being reprogrammed by the newest model TR-5, the machines instigate a [[cybernetic revolt]] against humanity, bombing cities and sending thousands of armed, identical TR-4 [[android (robot)|androids]] to eradicate all human life.  A band of survivors, led by small-town Sheriff Reed ([[A Martinez]]), battle to make it through and defeat the TR-4s. During their journey, they encounter a mysterious man, Kurt Ross ([[Jeremy London]]) who possesses a weapon that can disable any TR-4 it hits. Ross also has intimate knowledge of the TR-4s and is heavily implied to have met Reed in the past. With Ross's help, Reed's group struggles through several battles with the TR-4s and ultimately locate an airship used by the machines to travel. Ross proposes that they travel to the space station where the TR-4s originate from and shut them down remotely, but they must first acquire fuel for the ship. They find the fuel, but Sheriff Reed is shot in the leg by a TR-4.  On the ship, the survivors discover metal beneath Reed's skin, causing him to begin questioning his existence. Ross reveals that Reed is actually one of the first TR-5s, planted in the community with Ross as his handler. Reed's memories are all implants based on Ross's own memories. Bronson ([[Dustin Harnish]]) becomes paranoid and believes the other survivors are also androids, but Chloe ([[Lauren Walsh]]) dispels him by revealing she is pregnant. At the space station, the group battles the TR-4s en masse, resulting in Bronson's death and Tiffany ([[Lucinda Rogers]])  becoming separated from the others. Ross attempts to shut down the TR-4s but the control console fights back, repeatedly locking him out. Suddenly, the TR-4s all shut down, and Ross ominously realizes their power is being funneled to a much worse problem – the giant TR-5 that caused the rebellion in the first place. The massive robot appears and kills Ross with a blade mounted in its arm after shrugging off his EMP weapon, then attacks Chloe. Reed appears and baits the TR-5 into an airlock, and Chloe ejects both it and Reed into outer space. The TR-4s come back to life despite Tiffany hitting the shutdown switch, but when she rips the cords from the control box, they all die simultaneously. Chloe, Tiffany, Tanner ([[Mark Hengst]]), Laura ([[Krystle Connor]]) and Chloe's unborn child are left as the only survivors, possibly of all humanity.

Days later, David's research team begins feeling the effects of a strange illness, and David tells helicopter pilot Bart not to bring his daughter Evelyn to the station.

As he is about to shoot Evelyn, he is shot from behind by David. David insists they destroy the research station.

As a rescue helicopter comes to pick up David, Evelyn and Atom are locked up by David, but they escape. Atom tries to hang on to a helicopter skid but falls to the ground. As the helicopter starts flying away, Evelyn shoots at it, causing it to crash into a building previously doused in gasoline. David and the helicopter crew die in the resulting fire; Evelyn finds Atom, who dies in her arms.  The following day another rescue team arrives, finding the destruction and Evelyn, the sole survivor. Later, as a radio station airs information based on Evelyn's reports, a hunter calls his dog away from a dead bird the dog has been eating. Bugs emerge from the bird's body.

Moments later, Henry is helped by an older version of himself who has also traveled back. Unable to control the timing or destinations of his traveling, Henry finds himself drawn to significant people, places, and events in his life but is incapable of changing events beyond the minor differences his presence creates.  In 1991, Henry meets Clare Abshire in the library where he works. She is overjoyed to see him although he is actually meeting her for the first time. Clare explains that she met Henry's future self when she was a child, and that he informed her then that they would meet in the future, which is happening at the moment. Since childhood, Henry has been Clare's best friend and has visited her. As a child, Clare develops a crush on Henry, and she is upset to learn that he is married. When Clare turns 18, two years before their meeting at the library, the older Henry kisses her, leading her to realize that he is her husband in the future. They begin a relationship, which is challenged by Henry's disorder. His sporadic time traveling is further complicated by the fact that he arrives at his destinations completely naked. From an early age, he had learned how to pick locks and to steal clothing to endure his travels. Among his getaways are many visits to young Clare. From present-day Clare's diary, he gets a list of dates when he visited her, and gives those to young Clare so that she can be waiting for him with clothes. Falling in love, Henry and Clare eventually marry, though he actually time travels away before the ceremony and a visibly older version of himself arrives in time to step in, slightly confusing the guests.  Henry's disappearances allow him to win the lottery by having the numbers in advance, but his disorder takes a toll on his relationship with Clare. It also makes having a child with Clare seemingly impossible, as Henry's genes cause their unborn fetuses to time travel. They seek a renowned doctor's help, but after numerous similar miscarriages, Henry has a secret [[vasectomy]] to end their suffering. However, soon after, Clare gets pregnant one last time—by a visiting younger version of Henry—and carries the baby to full term. Before the child is born, Henry travels forward in time and happily meets their pre-teen daughter, Alba. She tells him that she is a time traveler, too, but has increasing control over when and where she travels. Alba tells Henry that he will die when she is five years old, a fact that Henry subsequently hides from Clare.

Later, Henry time travels and is accidentally shot by Clare's father, who is hunting elk. Henry returns in time to die in Clare's arms. Some years later, a younger Henry visits Alba and Clare, giving Clare hope that he will visit again, though he tells her not to spend her life waiting for him, hoping this encounter would provide a proper closure for both Clare and Alba.

But it fails just as she is called to meet Queen Clarion ([[Anjelica Huston]]), Fairy Mary ([[Jane Horrocks]]), and Redleaf, the Minister of Autumn ([[John DiMaggio]]).  They show her a mystical moonstone and explain to her its tremendous powers. Every eight years, there is a [[blue moon|blue harvest moon]] in Pixie Hollow. When the light of this rare blue moon passes through the moonstone, it creates blue-colored pixie dust to strengthen and rejuvenate the pixie dust tree. The Autumn Revelry is the associated event during which the fairies gather to collect the dust.  A new [[scepter]] is to be made to raise the moonstone, and Tinker Bell has been recommended. Although Tinker Bell has made mistakes in the past, Fairy Mary explains that tinker fairies learn from them, most of the time. Tinker Bell accepts the task, as well as help from Terence. But as the work on the scepter progresses, Tinker Bell begins to have trouble with Terence, who is trying too hard to be helpful. When Tinkerbell asks Terence to go find something sharp, Terence brings a compass to her workshop, irritating Tinkerbell. She kicks the compass, causing it to roll over and break her newly completed scepter. After lashing out at her friend, Tinker Bell's furious antics result in her accidentally smashing the moonstone as well. Tinker Bell sets out on in a balloon she's created to find a magic mirror, which, according to legend, granted two of three wishes before becoming lost. Tinker Bell intends to use the third and last wish to repair the shattered moonstone to its original form.  While trying to evade a hungry bat, a firefly named Blaze crash lands into Tinker Bell's balloon. Tink orders him to leave, but he truly wants to tag along with Tink on her quest to find the magical mirror. After Blaze's apparent exit, Tink tries to read her map but it's too dark to see. Blaze then sheds light on the map to help Tink, and the tinker finally allows him to stay. As the duo's adventure continues, Tink thinks she has stumbled upon the stone arch that is said to lead way to the mirror. She leaves the balloon to make sure of this and leaves Blaze to watch over it. Once Tink flies off, however, the balloon begins to stray away. After unsuccessfully trying to anchor it, Blaze rushes to tell Tink, though she is too busy trying to figure out why she stumbled upon a bent tree instead of the stone ark to notice Blaze. When she finally sees the balloon floating off, she gives chase, Blaze in tow, but the harsh winds knocks them down. The next morning, Tinker Bell awakens, hungry and lost.  Blaze scouts out to rally some forest insects that provide food and water for Tink. They also lead her and Blaze to the stone arch, and the adventure continues. They find the shipwreck that is said to house the mirror and head inside Tinker Bell finally discovers the mirror. Just as she is about to make the wish, Blaze keeps getting in her face, causing her to blurt out her wish for the firefly to be quiet for one minute, accidentally wasting her third wish. She blames Blaze for distracting her, but then, realizing that her temper is what had gotten her in trouble in the first place, she apologizes and breaks down crying. She is found by Terence, who has been following her after discovering her plans and the fragments of the moonstone in her empty house. They reconcile, but then they are chased by rats.  Tinker Bell and Terence start back to Pixie Hollow. Along the way, Tinker Bell fixes the scepter using a white gem from the top of the mirror, the scepter pieces Terence has wisely brought, and the moonstone pieces, all set at just the right angle. She discovers the magic of true [[friendship]], [[humility]], and [[love]]. Thanks to inspired teamwork with Terence, she is ready to give the scepter to Queen Clarion.  When she unveils the scepter, the assembled fairies are all shocked and alarmed to see the fragments of the precious moonstone. However, the broken moonstone shards create an unexpected benefit: they drastically magnify and increase the surface area through which the rays of the blue moon could pass, creating the largest supply of blue-colored pixie dust ever seen in Pixie Hollow.  
To Save a Life
  The story opens with Jake Taylor ([[Randy Wayne]]) a high school student in the suburbs of [[San Diego]] attending the funeral of his ex-best friend Roger ([[Robert Bailey Jr.]]). After Roger's mom comes and asks Jake if Roger had said anything to him, she walks away, and Jake remembers that this all started back when they were young boys and best friends. Roger pushed Jake out of the way of a car, saving him but crippling himself forever. During their freshmen year of high school, after Jake had made the winning basket in a basketball game, a freshman cheerleader named Amy invited him to a party that Roger was not let into. In the years later Jake joined a new popular group of friends, Amy became his girlfriend, and he became star of the basketball team.  Jake grew further away from Roger, who became more of a loner due to his condition which he was bullied for. Three years later as a high school senior, Roger came in with a gun and began to shoot. Jake, knowing what Roger was going to do, tries to stop him, but Roger tells him that it was too late.  Jake watches in horror as Roger shoots himself. Roger dies from his injuries, prompting Jake to wonder if he could have saved him by being a better friend.  After the final basketball game of his senior year, Jake meets Chris, a youth pastor, who had spoken at Roger's funeral. Jake goes to a party that is broken up by the police and, being slow to orient himself, is the last to sneak out of the house.  Amy had taken his truck, and he was without a ride home.  With no other options left, Jake decides to call the number on the business card Chris gave him.  On the ride home, Chris reveals that Roger had come to church the Sunday before he killed himself. Chris expresses guilt that no one had really welcomed him there.  Jake continues to struggle in dealing with Roger's death, attending church several times and drawing concern from Amy because of his withdrawn behavior.  He discovers Roger's social networking page and sees that Roger had openly discussed his hopelessness. Amy joins Jake at church the following Sunday, but leaves during the service, feeling judged.  Jake confronts the group angrily about their shallow faith and failure to be inclusive and inviting. Chris asks for a solution, and a girl named Andrea suggests that they all have lunch together at school.  For the next few weeks, they all meet at lunch everyday.  Slowly, Jake becomes shunned by all of his old friends, including Amy. Jake invites Jonny (Sean Michael Afable), a boy who had been mocked by a fake invitation to a party, to join them, which he eventually does.  Jonny starts to emerge from the darkness he felt following Roger's death as he, Jake, and Andrea become friends.  After some time, Jonny asks Jake for advice on asking Andrea on a date. They go out for ice cream and Andrea sees scars on Jonny's wrist from cutting.  She reveals that she used to be a cutter as well, touching his wrist. Jonny tries to kiss her, dropping his ice cream in her lap and causing her to draw back. Meanwhile, Jake finds out that Amy is pregnant with his baby and that she doesn't want to keep the child.  He then discovers that his parents are about to divorce after his father had an affair. The next day at school, Jonny wants help from Jake on what to do with Andrea after he blew his chance. Jake takes his anger out on Jonny by brushing aside his concerns, effectively humiliating him in front of his peers.  Jake and Andrea attempt to patch things up with Jonny, but he ignores their calls and resumes cutting his wrists.  Danny, the pastor's son, overhears Jake and Chris talking about Amy's pregnancy and posts drawings all over the school announcing the secret to the school.  In the weeks that follow, Jake stops hanging out with his old friends for good and spends more time with his new friends. He gives up his dream about going to college, much to his father's disappointment, and talks to Amy, who has decided to keep their baby. Jake promises her that he will help her raise their child. Amy, having been shunned by all her old friends at school, begins spending time with Andrea and the other girls from the church. Jake continues to call Jonny, but he refuses to pick up his phone.  At the climax of the movie, Jonny bumps into Danny, who takes the cell phone Jonny drops. Minutes later, students are evacuated from the school due to a bomb threat.  Danny steps forward and tells the police he thinks it was Jonny. The police search Jonny's locker and find horrific pictures of bombs exploding the school. They ask Jonny for his phone, but he doesn't have it, because Danny still does. The police handcuff Jonny and walk him through the crowd of the entire student body. Jake realizes that Jonny didn't make the threats when he calls Jonny's phone and sees Danny answer it. With Amy distracting the teachers that guard the exit, Jake runs past them to the road and steps in front of the police car. Jonny had opened a bottle of prescription pills preparing to overdose on them, but Jake successfully stops the vehicle just before Jonny ends up like Roger.  Danny is then caught by the police, but cannot bring himself to call his father, calling Chris instead. Chris leaves Danny alone, but Jake offers to stay with him. The pastor takes a leave of absence to spend time with Danny and Chris becomes the new pastor in his place.  Jake's life soon begins to look up. His daughter is placed in [[open adoption]], and Amy gets back together with him. The daughter is adopted by a couple unable to have children and, instead of taking the child and leaving, they want to keep Amy and Jake in the family. His friends and family gather to see him off to Louisville for college, and his dad comes along with him so they can talk. Jonny gives Jake a note to read on the way there stating that he actually did feel like Roger and had considered taking his life, as well.  He stated that if Jake had not invited him for lunch that day, he did not know where he would be at the moment. At that point, Jake and his father stop the trip to Louisville and head home.

Timer (film)
   The conceit of TiMER is that a wrist implant is available that counts down to the day when the user will meet his or her soulmate.  Oona, a [[Los Angeles]] orthodontist, has a blank timer, meaning her soulmate is not equipped with one. Searching for her soulmate, Oona brings her latest timerless boyfriend to get a timer installed, but the timers do not match and they part ways.  Oona's stepsister and roommate, Steph, has a TiMER indicating that she will not meet her soulmate for over 15 years. Steph's lifestyle includes one-night stands with men whose timers are about to expire, and she encourages Oona toward similar behavior.  Oona gravitates toward Mikey, a young grocery store clerk who encourages her to live in the present. Mikey’s TiMER only has a few months left. Steph meets Dan, a newcomer to Los Angeles, and invites him to her bar intending to introduce him to Oona, who does not show up because she is with Mikey. Steph and Dan flirt. Dan confesses that his wife died; he does not have a TiMER because he believes she was "his one".  When Mikey meets Steph and the sisters argue, Mikey reveals that his TiMER was fake: a programmable sticker. Oona is angry but realizes she was more herself with him because of it. With Oona's 30th birthday approaching, she feels pressure from her mother to find her soulmate. Steph and Oona decide to have their TiMERs removed claiming that they are moving on and the results no longer matter.  Steph has hers removed and is visibly relieved. During Oona's turn, her countdown abruptly starts, signifying that her soulmate has gotten a TiMER. It indicates that she will meet her soulmate the next day. Steph encourages her to remove it anyway, but a conflicted Oona decides to keep it. An angry Steph leaves Oona to think it over.  The next day is Oona and Steph's birthday, and their parents throw them a party, inviting Mikey and Dan. Steph and Oona, still fighting, arrive separately. Oona looks for Steph, but sees Dan. Her TiMER goes off, because Dan purchased a TiMER: being with Steph made him not want to be alone. Mikey runs off before Oona can talk to him, and Oona finds Steph and Dan arguing. The sisters fight and Oona leaves.  The next day, Oona visits Mikey and shows him she had her TiMER removed and says she does not care about the results. Mikey is grateful for the gesture, but insists that the results matter and they say goodbye. The next morning Steph reconciles with Oona. Oona goes for a run at the track later than she usually does, and runs into Dan practicing with his relay team, learning they use the same track, but at different times. They part with the promise of meeting again.  
Tormented (2009 British film)
  [[Head girl]] Justine Fielding ([[Tuppence Middleton]]) is escorted out of Fairview High School by the police, as other pupils look on.  Five days earlier, Justine is reading at the funeral of unpopular, asthmatic student Darren Mullet ([[Calvin Dean]]). She starts to talk about him, when Mullet's equally unpopular friend, Jason Banks ([[Olly Alexander]]), stands up in church and angrily calls her a [[Hypocrisy|hypocrite]] because she did not really know him. He is then thrown out by the sadistic P.E. teacher. Later on, Justine is talking to her friend Helena ([[Mary Nighy]]) when school heart-throb Alex ([[Dimitri Leonidas]]) decides to invite her to a party that his popular friends, Bradley ([[Alex Pettyfer]]), Tasha ([[April Pearson]]), Khalillah ([[Larissa Wilson]]), Sophie ([[Georgia King]]) and Marcus ([[Tom Hopper]]) are having. She decides to go.  At the party, when Justine arrives, Tasha tells Jez ([[Ben Lloyd-Hughes]]), the DJ, to say something about her appearance. He begins to rap about her in an unflattering manner. When Alex tells him to stop, he is literally thrown out of the party by Bradley. Later, Alex and Justine go to one of the bedrooms and kiss. Meanwhile, Bradley, Tasha, Khalillah, Marcus and Sophie all receive insulting and degrading text messages from Mullet's number. During this, someone puts on a clown costume and grabs a chainsaw, before heading up to Alex and Justine. It turns out to be Bradley, who is pranking them.  Jez goes to the cemetery and urinates on Mullet's grave. He is stabbed with a wooden crucifix by Mullet.  Later, the 'in-crowd' toast Mullet. Justine admits that she didn't even know who he was. At school, the headmaster mentions that Jez never came home. Bradley threatens Nasser ([[James Floyd (actor)|James Floyd]]), the leader of the school's [[emo]] clique, about removing a website he had put up about Mullet. Justine is persuaded to hang around with the popular crowd, as well as telling Helena that she won't be able to make it to her DVD night. She finds a teddy bear (stolen from Mullet's grave) in her locker and assumes it is from Alex. He asks her on another date after this, which she agrees to. She goes to see Jason and he tells her that Mullet was in love with her and hands her his suicide note. While she is reading the note, a teacher tells her that she will make a great pupil at Oxford University. In the school's recording studio, Nasser is then attacked and sees Mullet's ghost. The ghost increases the volume of Nasser's music and forces him to listen, rendering him deaf. He is taken to the ambulance, yelling to everyone: "Mullet's back!". However, no one believes him.  The gang get more messages. Bradley believes Jason is sending them. Jason, meanwhile, is in art class. The art teacher tells everyone that the guillotine is faulty and they shouldn't touch it. A boy sent by Bradley fetches Jason out of class, then Bradley and Marcus assault him, but they are interrupted by another message, showing Jason is innocent. The P.E. teacher arrives and gives Jason detention. Later, Justine confronts Jason about the note, but he denies forging it, and breaks down in tears about the horrific bullying that caused Darren Mullet to kill himself. He tells Justine about the vicious texts sent to Mullet, as well as a [[website]] that Bradley's gang created about him. When Justine asks who was responsible for Mullet's suicide, Jason glances at the popular kids. She shows Alex the suicide note, but his friends tell her she cannot hand it into the police, because as it accuses Justine of hating him, she would implicate herself in his death. The girls decide that Helena has been sending the messages and attack her in the bathroom, with Tasha smashing her phone. After swim practice, Sophie tells Justine that she should sleep with Alex that night, but goes back into the swimming pool to retrieve her watch. She is attacked by Mullet's ghost until she drowns.  Later, Justine and Alex sleep together, but are seen by Mullet, who had brought some flowers for her. Mullet tears the badge from her uniform, as well as re-arranges her fridge magnets, calling her a "dirty slut". Marcus is then in P.E. class where he sees Mullet's ghost, and the P.E. teacher tells him to go and have a shower, just as the art teacher arrives and tells the head that they have found Sophie's body. In the shower, he is led to a mirror with "moron" written on it, which Marcus hates being called. He is then brutally whipped with a towel by the ghost of Mullet while nude. He manages to fight him off with a cricket bat after painfully popping his bloodied eye back into his skull and heads outside, running into Helena, who accuses him of trying to rape her because he is semi naked. He manages to get outside, but is impaled through the skull upon an iron fence by the ghost. Later on, the gang are at Bradley's house, where they have an argument about who killed their friends, ending in Tasha and Justine getting into a fight, and Justine is thrown into the swimming pool. Bradley decides to go and dig Mullet's body up at the cemetery to prove that Mullet cannot be responsible.  Justine goes home and demands that Alex shows her the website, where she tearfully witnesses the diabolical stunts inflicted on Mullet by Bradley and his friends - including Alex (who refers to Justine as "Head Girlus Frigidus Bitchus"). Justine is even more revolted when she realizes that she was rude to Mullet because he interrupted a conversation about her going to Oxford, as well as ignored his pleas for her to stop the in-crowd torturing him. She tells Alex that he is deceitful and a liar, and that their relationship is over.  Tasha becomes drunk in Bradley's car as he takes her to dig up Mullet. After attempting to dig up Mullet's corpse, Bradley breaks down and begins to cry with grief over the death of his friends. Tasha consoles him and they have sex in Bradley's car. Tasha sees Mullet's ghost and, despite her desperate attempt to get Bradley's attention, Mullet drags Bradley out of the vehicle and rips off his penis, killing Bradley due to blood loss. Tasha gets free and runs into an open grave. She explains that she lied to Mullet, telling him that she loved him ever since they met each other. Mullet decapitates her with a shovel.  The next day, Justine arrives at the art class (where Jason has painted [[Edvard Munch|Munch]]'s "The Scream"), and tells Jason that she was responsible for Mullet's death. He tells her that it was his fault, because he was scared of being bullied, so he told Bradley that Mullet fancied her. After she leaves the room, Mullet appears and kills him by jamming two pencils up his nose and slamming his head against the table. Justine approaches Helena and tells her that she is sorry, that her friends, including Alex, were all horrible. Khalillah runs over and asks her where Tasha is, but Justine tells her she doesn't care. Khalillah then gets a text message from Tasha telling her to meet her in the art room.  Before Justine can follow, she is confronted by Alex, who tells her he is going to kill Mullet for what he has done to everyone. Justine tells him that Khalilah is in danger. Khalillah gets to the empty art room and sees "The Scream" with her name on it, at which point Mullet puts a plastic bag over her head, before using the guillotine to slice her hands off. She tries to call the head teacher, but he is too busy with the police, who tell him that Justine's badge has been found near the bodies of Bradley and Tasha. They get to the art room and find Jason's and Khalillah's bodies, but are attacked by Mullet. They break free by stabbing him in the stomach with a screwdriver and head to the common room, where Mullet follows them. Alex tries to stop him, but is stabbed in the hand with the screwdriver and his hand is tightly nailed to the floor. Justine gets him to stop, but he begins to choke her to death. She grabs his inhaler and throws it across the room, telling Alex to smash it. He does and the ghost begins to die. Justine tells Alex to leave, but he starts being a bully again and punches Mullet, knocking a sofa over, finding Mullet's other inhaler, which Alex had hidden from Mullet when he was alive. Mullet then uses it, and stabs Alex in the throat with the screwdriver. Mullet flees just as the police arrive. Justine is then led out and into the police car seen earlier, having been arrested for the murders. She sees Mullet's ghost, but it then disappears; what happened to her is never revealed.  During the credits, there is a sequence where the foul-mouthed P.E. teacher is telling students off, while Mullet is shown getting ready for revenge on him.  
Tormented (2009 Salvadorean film)
  The film opens with Mariana, a young lady in her early 20s. Mariana was coming home when her car broke down, so she went to a nearby to ask for help. A strange-looking lady opens the door and, not completely understanding what she's saying, lets her in. While they're inside, the woman acts completely cold and robotic, and asks Mariana to wait in a small living room till her husband arrives.  She waits there for a long time. The man finally arrives and while he's asking her about her problem they hear an argument between the woman and her daughter upstairs. He offers to go outside and see if they can find a solution for her problem, and when they are near the door he asks her to go ahead since he has to go get his tools first. As soon as Mariana grabs the door knob, she hears a strange noise, and the house starts to change. The lights go out, the walls burn down quickly and a lot of the furniture disappears. At the end, a big plank drops and hits Mariana in the face.  After she recovers, she tries to move the debris blocking the door but she can't do it. She hears a little girl's laugh, and then that same voice asks her to go upstairs. Mariana has no choice but to go up, and as soon as she arrives she sees a figure running down the hall. Mariana follows it into a room, where she finds the woman, dressed in a big sleeping gown. Eliza, the little girl, comes from behind, and Mariana witnesses a small argument between the two. In that argument, it's hinted that the man is abusing the little girl, while the mother is willingly ignoring that situation. Both the woman and the little girl disappear, hinting that they were in fact [[ghosts]]. A devilish-looking version of the little girl appears, and runs away while pushing Mariana to the side. Mariana again runs after her, going back downstairs. While she's downstairs she sees a light shining under one of the doors, and while she's checking it out the doorknob begins to shake. Then something starts hitting the door from the other side, so the scared Mariana runs away, hiding herself inside the kitchen.  In the kitchen, Mariana is trying to figure out a way to go out, since all exits are blocked. Suddenly, the man enters through the supposedly blocked back door. She asks him for help, and after a brief struggle he throws her onto the table and [[rapes]] her. The little girl appears and explains she wants her to go through the same pain her father would make her suffer. After that, the man throws Mariana to the floor and they both leave her there. The house falls apart, a lot of debris falling on her. Mariana opens her eyes, and a series of flashbacks are displayed, revealing she had a car accident in front of the house, and that everything she'd seen since the beginning was in fact a [[near-death experience]]. She closes her eyes and the film ends.  
Tony (2009 film)
 Tony Benson lives alone in a flat on an [[Dalston]] [[council estate]] [[tower block]]. He obsessively collects 1980s violent action movies, and he aimlessly wanders the streets of London in an unsuccessful attempt to connect with another person. He has been unemployed and living on state benefits for over 20 years.  He is soon revealed to be a [[serial killer]], killing men he encounters by chance, including two drug addicts whom he uncomfortably tries to engage with after inviting them to his home to smoke [[heroin]]. The encounter ends with Tony suffocating one of them with a plastic bag while locking the other in a cupboard before letting him go, believing the terrified addict wouldn't go to the police.  The rare visitors Tony does get usually complain of the rotting smell from his house, which he blames on clogged drains. Others he meets at [[gay bar]]s before bringing them back to his flat and usually end with him rejecting their advances and killing them, similar in fashion to [[Dennis Nilsen]]. He also gets dismissed after visiting a prostitute with only £5, asking the price of a cuddle and failing in his attempt to strike up a conversation with her.  Tony disposes of the bodies of his victims by butchering their torsos and human organs in his kitchen sink before bagging them and dumping them in the [[River Thames]] and canals in London. He shares a bed with a rotting corpse, obviously one of his victims, and drags bodies which are stashed around the house out to put on the couch to sit and watch TV with him.  Tony comes under fire from a drunk (played by [[Ricky Grover]]) when his son goes missing. Grover bullies Tony with volleys of verbal and physical abuse, including spitting on him. Grover accuses Tony of being a [[paedophilia|paedophile]] and wrongly blames him for his son's disappearance. Tony becomes suspect number one because of his unusual appearance and his withdrawn nature towards other people. A police detective visits to question him on the missing boy's whereabouts, putting Tony at risk of being discovered.  However the boy is soon discovered and Tony is let off the hook. The film ends with Tony casually walking around London.

The Tournament (2009 film)
 A group of the world's wealthiest and most powerful men, who are themselves tied into law enforcement agencies and criminal underworlds alike, and who also control the international media with their billions, have devised the ultimate entertainment for themselves, simply referred to as "The Tournament", which takes place at intervals of every seven or ten years in an unspecified location, usually a large city.  "Contestants" volunteer, but due to the nature of the tournament are some of the toughest or craziest individuals on the planet. They are expected to kill and only the last surviving combatant will win the cash prize of £10 million offered by William Randolph Hearst. The men and women running the tournament not only view it as entertainment, but also bet high stakes on the outcome as a huge gambling tournament, serving as the source of excitement also for the millionaires.  For each tournament, combatants are selected from the world's special forces, serial killers, athletes, trained contract killers and assassins. The last combatant standing receives not only the cash prize, but also the glory and reputation of having the title of World's Number 1, and which itself carries the legendary million dollar a bullet contract killing price tag. Each of the contestants carries a tracking device, embedded under their skin, allowing the observers to monitor their movements, and the contestants to track each other. The tournament lasts twenty-four hours, and if no one has won, then the tracking devices will explode.  The mayhem which takes place is passed off as natural disasters, terrorist outrages, accidents, or put down to rampages committed by lone madmen. The unsuspecting towns where the tournament takes place are randomly selected, and the public never know of its existence. This year, the latest tournament has come to [[Middlesbrough]], a town in the United Kingdom - the country with the most prevalent mass surveillance in the world so that the events of the tournament can be easily followed and recorded through the ever-present [[CCTV]] as well as satellite surveillance. They also jam the communications of the emergency services, completely taking over the electronic infrastructure, and the stage is set.  The current Tournament becomes complex due to the actions of the organisers and competitors. Not only has Joshua Harlow, the winner of the last Tournament, been convinced to return because his wife was murdered and he's informed that the killer is in the Tournament, but another contestant, the Frenchman Anton Bogart, manages to remove his tracking chip, dropping it in a cup of coffee just in time for Father Joseph MacAvoy, a priest struggling with alcoholism and a crisis of faith, to drink it. With his only ally assassin Lai Lai Zhen, seeking to escape the game after her last kill, MacAvoy must race to survive before the timer runs down.  Joshua Harlow finds out in the course of the film who murdered his wife. It was Lai Lai Zhen, who had been commissioned by the organizer, Powers. Harlow blows himself and Powers into the air at the end of the film. Lai Lai Zhen and Father MacAvoy are the only survivors of the game. At the end of the film we see that Father MacAvoy is once again working as a priest and has defeated his alcohol addiction.

Totally Spies! The Movie
 The movie begins with Sam, Alex and Clover starting their new lives in [[Beverly Hills]], California. As each of them were about to cross paths outside a sushi restaurant, nearby of WOOHP agents (including Jerry) purposely cause the giant sushi roll above the entrance to break off and chase after them, setting some nearby animals free in the process. The giant sushi roll, with the three girls [[log rolling]] on top of it, chases a baby pig to the street. The three girls are able to avoid it, save the life of the baby pig (which Alex later adopts and names "Oinky") and destroy the sushi roll before it causes any damage. After that, Alex, Sam and Clover introduce themselves and this starts their friendship when they later see each other again at their new school, meet the current principal Miss Skrich and their rivals, Mandy and Dominique and Catlin. Clover offers her new friends a change of clothes after Mandy sprays them with a chai machine, but they find themselves sucked in through a locker and into one of the offices of WOOHP. Here, they meet Jerry and fellow WOOHP agent Tad. Jerry reveals that WOOHP had been observing the three of them secretly since childhood, showing videos of each girl, and picking them as prime recruits for the organization. However, the girls are quick to reject the invite and refuse to join. However, they later are "forced" into training after each having traumatic experiences that seemingly relate to WOOHP. They agree to go through training and in 48 hours, complete the training.  After training, they are thrown into their first mission when famous celebrities, like rockstar Rob Hearthrob and animal psychologist Peppy Wolfman, have been mysteriously abducted. This also shows how the girls obtained their differently colored uniforms (thanks to a design suggestion by Clover). They first go to Wolfman's building where Alex has Oinky "go hog wild for mommy" as a distraction, and Oinky deliberately runs around the lobby with the other animals and the receptionist in pursuit. They later find that each went through a make over by a mysterious machine called the "Fabulizor", discovered thanks to security footage in Wolfman's office. They later see that everyone at school also had gone through the Fabulizor, having the same look the next day, and Oinky ends up going through the Fabulizor, getting the same make over as well. This is after nearly being blasted by one of Fabu's minions in a fighter jet while being flown back to school and after nearly avoiding Miss Skritch as they sneak back into school. Tailing Mandy that night, they find that all of those who went through the Fabulizor became hypnotized by a special chip in their cheek bones prior to the make over and Alex spots Oinky in the crowd and grabs onto him, with Sam and Clover grabbing onto Alex as they were abducted into a strange space station out in space. They then meet the mastermind behind the entire affair, Fabu, a runway model who quickly lost fame in five minutes on the runway and was ashamed of not being a part of the crowd during his childhood. The spies accidentally expose themselves and are captured by Fabu's strongest henchmen. He then relates his entire plan, to abduct everyone who went through the Fabulizor and place them inside a special space station which he calls Fabutopia to live out new lives in the posh surroundings, then use a missile to destroy all of Earth, before using his Fabulizor in reverse and give the girls each horrible make overs (Sam gets green skin, Clover grows a unibrow and Alex gets massive pimples). He then sets them to be blasted back to Earth in rockets. But just as he leaves, things get more difficult when Tad meets the girls again while they are still imprisoned and says he will let them fail the mission and stop Fabu himself, taking all the credit and regaining his "favorite agent" status with Jerry.  But after a fight with Fabu, Tad is strapped to the missile bound for Earth. The girls manage to escape and, after fixing the Fabulizor's damage to themselves, go after Fabu. They are unable to stop the missile from taking off but hitch a ride as it is rocketing towards Earth with Tad still attached to it. They are able to turn the missile around to destroy the station, surprising the girls since they had no idea of how to stop it earlier and Alex whacks at the control panel with the WOOHP manual. They then are picked up by a surprise appearance from Jerry in one of WOOHP's ships and rescue the kidnapped people from aboard the station (freeing them of the hypnotic trance by destroying Fabu's signal beacon in his staff) and evacuate safely, including Oinky, who Alex thought was never going to make it out in time, only to see him run fast to her, finally reunited with Alex before the missile explodes and destroys the station in a firework finale. They then chase after Fabu's ship, manage to destroy it and catch Fabu and his [[Sphynx (cat)|Sphynx]] in his escape pod. After the mission, the girls admit that the mission was difficult at first, but it also made them friends, so they accept their position as spies. Alex is invited for a session with Wolfman and Clover is offered a date by Rob Hearthrob over the phone. But before that, they later return to school to face punishment from the principal for the "damage" they caused when trying to avoid her earlier on in the movie (thanks to Sam using a laser lip stick to cut an escape hole in the wall earlier). But fortunately, it seems that thanks to WOOHP, they have a new principal, whose name is not revealed, and seemingly does not know about the girls' punishment and gives Sam high praise.  Miss Skritch had been transferred to another school in [[Antarctica]] in an igloo, Fabu, his henchman and Tad are later imprisoned and set for punishment by WOOHP and everyone who was rescued from aboard Fabu's space station have their minds erased (including Mandy). But just after the girls celebrate getting even with Mandy for the last time, courtesy of one of WOOHP's gadgets, they are sucked away to another mission. The girls are quick to bring up personal appointments, but soon find themselves running from a WOOHP jet as it prepares to suck them aboard. But the girls are ready for their mission as they change into their spy uniforms and exclaim their friendship as the movie ends.  
Toys in the Attic (2009 film)
 In an attic full of discarded junk, a pretty doll called Buttercup lives in an old trunk together with her friends, the marionette Sir Handsome, the lovable Teddy Bear, a Mechanical Mouse and the plasticine creature, Laurent. When Buttercup is snatched and taken off to the Land of Evil, her pals set out on a wondrous and daring adventure to rescue her from the all-powerful Head of State. Originally produced in the Czech language, the meticulously crafted animated feature is set in a magical world of toys and knick-knacks stored in the attic of a home in Prague. Following the symbolism of the Cold War era that impacted director Barta and the Czech Republic, the world of the attic is divided into the land of happy toys in the west and the land of evil in the east. The despotic Head of State rules over the evil empire of the east with a band of sinister minions, insects and rotted vegetables. When the lovely "Buttercup" is kidnapped and held prisoner by The Head, it is up to her friends - a teddy bear, a mechanical mouse and marionette puppet - to cross the international boundary and attempt their daring rescue. A teddy bear, a mechanical mouse, and a marionette join forces to save their kidnapped friend, Buttercup the doll, from the denizens of the Land of Evil.  
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
   In 17,000 B.C., the [[Thirteen (Transformers)|Seven Primes]] travel across to create [[Spark (Transformers)|Energon]] with star-absorbing machines namedcalled Sun Harvesters, which destroy stars in order to collect their raw material. One of them later known as "[[Fallen (Transformers)|The Fallen]], defies, sole their rule to never to destroy planets with life by establishing a Sun Harvester on [[Earth]]. He is confronted by, the other Primes, who imprison The Fallen before he can harvest the planet's Sun using the [[Matrix of Leadership]]. The rest of the Primes then sacrifice themselves to hide the Matrix in an unknown location.   In the present, two years after Megatron's defeat, the [[Autobots]] and the U.S. military have formed the Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (NEST), a classified international task force used to eliminate the surviving [[Decepticons]]. In [[Shanghai]], the Autobots intercept two Decepticons, Demolisher and Sideways. Sideways is killed by the Autobot [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]], while [[Optimus Prime]] kills Demolisher, but not before he warns them of the Fallen's return. At NEST's secure headquarters in [[Diego Garcia]], National Security Adviser Theodore Galloway concludes the Decepticons are still on Earth to hunt the Autobots, since Megatron's corpse is at the bottom of the [[Laurentian Abyss]] and the last known [[AllSpark]] shard is secured in the base. [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] hacks into a military satellite, overhears the information, and sends [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] to retrieve the shard.  Meanwhile, [[Sam Witwicky]] is preparing to attend college, leaving his girlfriend [[Mikaela Banes]] and guardian [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] behind. He finds a smaller AllSpark shard and picks it up, causing him to see Cybertronian symbols. Sam gives the shard to Mikaela, who later captures Decepticon [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]] when he attempts to steal it. The [[Constructicons]] resurrect Megatron by brutally ripping apart the Constructicon Scrapmetal to provide parts for him, as well as using the stolen shard. Megatron then travels to one of Saturn's moons, where he reunites with his master, The Fallen, who orders him to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus, as he is the only Transformer who can defeat The Fallen. Sam, Mikaela and his college roommate, Leo are captured by the Decepticon Grindor and taken to an abandoned factory. Megatron reveals that the symbols in Sam's mind will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source before Optimus and Bumblebee arrive to rescue the trio. Optimus engages Megatron, [[Starscream]], and Grindor; though Optimus injures Starscream by cutting his arm off and killing Grindor, Megatron kills Optimus by impaling him through the chest, destroying his spark. The other Autobots arrive and repel the Decepticons, forcing Megatron and Starscream to retreat. The Decepticons launch devastating simultaneous attacks around the world, destroying ships in the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]] and damaging [[Paris]]. The Fallen hijacks Earth's [[telecommunications]] systems, demanding that Sam be handed to him.   Sam, Mikaela, and Leo enlist the help of former Sector Seven agent, Seymour Simmons, who reveals that the Transformers [[Ancient astronauts|visited]] Earth [[Aeon|eons]] ago and the most ancient, known as [[Seekers (Transformers)|Seekers]], remained on Earth, hiding in secret. With help from Wheelie, they track down a Decepticon Seeker named [[Jetfire#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Jetfire]] at the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian Air and Space Museum]]. They use their shard to revive Jetfire, who teleports the group to [[Egypt]] and explains the story of the Fallen. Jetfire and Wheelie turn against the Decepticons, and order them to locate the Matrix, which could revive Optimus. Sam's group finds the Matrix in [[Petra]], but it disintegrates into dust in Sam's hands. Undeterred, Sam stuffs the Matrix's remains into his sock.   Meanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the [[Giza pyramid complex]] but are attacked by a large force of Decepticons. During the battle, many Constructicons combine to form [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]], who destroys one of the pyramids to reveal the Sun Harvester inside, before he is killed by a destroyer's [[railgun]] called in by Simmons. Ravage and the Decepticon Rampage attempt to spring a trap with Sam's captured parents as bait, in order to force Sam to give them the Matrix, but Bumblebee interferes and kills them both. Major William Lennox and Master Sergeant Robert Epps call in an airstrike, which kills the majority of the Decepticon ground forces. However, Megatron manages to shoot Sam, seemingly killing him, before retreating upon getting attacked. Nearing his death, the Primes contact Sam through a vision, telling him the Matrix is earned, not found, and that he earned the right to bear it. They restore Sam's life and the Matrix, which he uses to revive Optimus.   The Fallen teleports to their location and steals the Matrix from Optimus, then returns to the pyramid with Megatron and activates the Sun Harvester. Jetfire, who was gravely wounded during the battle by Scorponok but did manage to kill his attacker, sacrifices himself in order to transplant his parts to Optimus, which give him immense strength and the ability to fly. Optimus knocks the Fallen and Megatron off the pyramid, destroying the Sun Harvester in the process. In the battle, Optimus disables Megatron and kills the Fallen; vowing vengeance, Megatron retreats with Starscream. The victorious Autobots and their allies then return to the United States.  
Transmorphers: Fall of Man
 Taking place 300 years prior to the events of [[Transmorphers|the first film]] in present-day 2009, the narrator describes how the government knew what was happening. A woman is seen driving recklessly on a California highway while arguing over her cell phone. Police officer Ryan Hadley ([[Bruce Boxleitner]]) pulls her over and gives her a warning. The man calls her back, but she tells him off and throws the phone down; the phone then transmorphs into a robotic spider and kills her.  At [[Edwards Air Force Base]], an NSA officer informs her superior about intercepting a signal. In [[Los Angeles]], Jo Summers is shocked to read in the newspaper about of the death of the woman from the car. In the [[Kern County]] Morgue, the police are baffled by the wound that killed the driver. Madison arrives home to discover her television is out. A repairman is called to fix the television. It ends up his name is Jake and he is an old friend of Madison who hasn't seen her since the war. Jake is shocked when the satellite dish transmorphs into a robot. He runs inside to warn Madison, but when he goes back the robot is gone. Summers arrives to investigate the death of the driver, but the NSA show up and asks her to go with them. She advises Ryan to find the driver's missing phone.  A man is driving an SUV when his GPS gives him a five seconds warning to exit the vehicle. He is shot in the forehead with a laser and the body is dumped, the SUV driving off by itself. Ryan meets with Madison and hears her story. He takes them in his car to look for the cell phone, but he is called to the scene of the SUV driver's body. A young boy tells Ryan that the empty car drove away. Ryan picks up the first driver's cellular phone from the coroner's office. He then intercepts the SUV, which tries to ram him. When Ryan pulls the SUV over, they are jumped by the satellite robot. They drive away, but are chased by the SUV, who also transmorphs into a robot.  The machines quickly seize control of the Earth. After surviving an assault and avoiding the destruction, the small group learn that aliens are changing the water and the atmosphere to fit their physiology. They hear about this from a soldier who claims that this information came from [[Russia]], where they captured and tortured one of the machines. They manage to salvage explosives and destroy one of the terraforming devices. This has a negative effect, though: the release of toxic chemicals into the atmosphere, to which the machines have adapted, and what is left of mankind takes refuge underground.  
Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day
 It has been 2 years since the events of the episode "[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys]]", and Ricky ([[Robb Wells]]), Julian ([[John Paul Tremblay]]) and Bubbles ([[Mike Smith (actor)|Mike Smith]]) are finally released from prison.  Upon returning to Sunnyvale Trailer Park, Bubbles finds that all of his kittens have been sent to an animal shelter and that he will need to pay thousands of dollars in order to have them released; secondly, Ricky and Julian successfully rob a liquor store, but Julian uses all the money to buy a car and refurbish his trailer into an [[Automobile repair shop|auto-body shop]]. Ricky's plan is to pass his Grade 12 exam, which he feels will open doors of opportunity for him.  Jim Lahey ([[John Dunsworth]]) is sober and has opened up a posh new trailer park while attempting to demolish Sunnyvale. His only problem is that his new sewer line will have to run through Julian's lot; he tries to convince Julian to move.  One sip of beer causes him to revert to heavy drinking. After Randy ([[Patrick Roach]]) leaves him and moves out of their trailer and on to Julian's deck, Lahey goes on a liquor-fueled rampage. Meanwhile, the boys experience failure: Julian's auto-body business is failing, Ricky fails his Grade 12 exam, and Bubbles' kittens remain in the animal shelter after a failed attempt to rescue them which results in Tyrone's (Tyrone Parsons) arrest.  Bubbles is told that the kittens will be put down soon unless he can raise the money to have them released. Lahey, drunk again,  destroys Ricky's new [[cannabis cultivation|cannabis growing operation]] and also demolishes Julian's trailer in an attempt to get Julian to move. However, Lahey's plan backfires as Julian has insured his trailer for $28,000. With nothing left to live for and his dream of operating his new posh trailer park ruined by Julian's refusal to move, Lahey loses his sanity.  The boys decide to rob a bank disguised as security guards making an armored-car transport as a last resort while Julian waits for the insurance check to save Bubbles' kittens. They succeed in obtaining the money from the vault but they are foiled by Lahey showing up at the last minute. Lahey threatens to commit suicide by threatening to jump off the roof of the bank. After Julian prevents this, the real security guards show up. Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles are arrested and sent back to prison after a car chase with the police and security guards, including Sam Losco, Cyrus, Dennis, Terry, Jacob and Phil Collins, Officer George Green, Detective Ted Johnson and Randy. They receive a short two-week sentence due to their arresting officer being drunk but request not to be filmed anymore.  Bubbles' kittens are saved through a therapy animal program at the prison where the cats are released and spend time with the inmates. Bubbles secures a date with the animal control worker who saved his kittens, and the boys presumably return to Sunnyvale, with Julian building a new trailer with the insurance money.  Meanwhile, Lahey is drunk in Cuba, having absconded with the stolen money. Even though he is now rich, he is shown to still be miserable, because he has nobody with whom to share his wealth. J-Roc ([[Jonathan Torrens]]) is also shown to have finally reached his goal of becoming a famous rapper, as he has a released new record, and is on stage in front of a large, enthusiastic crowd.  
Trash Humpers
   The film presents scenes of the lives of a group of seemingly deranged, [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] elderly individuals living in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] "who do antisocial things in a non-narrative way."  The movie opens with multiple shots of the old gang members masturbating to trash. This continues as a recurring sequence throughout the film.  These gang members are mostly male. There is only one woman among the main cast, though you can see others in brief shots later in the film.  We get a glimpse into the home of the elderly thugs. The living room is squalid, and the old people lie around or dance through it and rant and rave about various meaningless topics. The kitchen, however, is clean.  Various members of the gang are shown trespassing, partaking in vandalism, and disturbing the peace among other crimes.  A few of the members are seen on a basketball court in broad daylight, mocking and laughing at a boy failing to make baskets.  As the old people relax and lie down, the old lady sits in wheelchair and cheers him on as the child describes hitting a doll with a hammer, before aggressively doing so. The movie displays a recurring theme of violence driven by peer pressure, and the ritualistic antics in which the gang collectively partakes.  Briefly, a scene is played out involving the old lady on a small tricycle, dragging the beaten doll behind her by a string attached to the back of the bike. This is seen in greater detail towards the end of the film.  An old man drags himself along the ground as the old lady, again, sits in her wheelchair. She instructs a fat kid on how to hide a razor blade in an apple and screeches with joy at the thought of their pain. The gang members display a strong, recurring theme of taking sadistic pleasure in the suffering of others. We later learn that other people have hurt the gang through societal standards and expectations and actively attempt to oppress their freedom of self.  Later in the film, we see them ranting and making pancakes in the kitchen, chanting "make it, make it, don't fake it". The scene changes to the dark living room, which also features a dining table. Two old men sit across from each other, both wearing hats that are connected by a large pipe. They do not take these hats off and remain connected throughout the scenes in which they are featured. The old lady serves them pancakes, screams at them for a short time period, and then instructs an old shouting man to liberally apply dish soap to the pancakes. The hat men are henceforth forced to eat the pancakes. They do not appear to mind.  The movie is peppered with more scenes of the gang humping trash.  An old man, clad in only a confederate flag t-shirt, humps a tree.  The gang sits out on the porch and talks of freedom and the demons in the night. An old man jerks off in the corner.  The gang hires three plus-size prostitutes. In a line, they bend over on the bed in their underwear while the old people walk back and forth and tap the prostitutes' butts as they pass. Occasionally, one drums on their butt before moving on. The prostitutes lie on the bed and cheer while one of the men sings and tap dances in the corner. Another man masturbates to this. That man is then shown sitting in the tap dancing corner in his wheelchair, while the prostitutes sit around him, sing "Silent Night", and rub his crotch.  The gang go out for a walk. They sing songs, particularly "Three Little Devils", and are shown standing still under a bridge, doing nothing, as the water flows by. At night, a man in a french maid costume gives a sort of sermon, which ends in an expression of his hearty enthusiasm for fornicating with trash.  This man appears to die in the next scene. The men wearing hats sit around him, apparently mourning.  Another old man sits in a chair and plays a twangy rendition of an apparently original song, which he entitles "You Girls Sure Suck Large Fat Penis".  As the film continues, the rants of the gang members grow more bitter. They express their hatred, their pain, their fear, their lack of belief in magic. A man lies on the bed, talks about drugs, and blows a trumpet.  Toward the end, the gang goes for a bike ride. The woman is continuously singing "Three Little Devils". They all drag dolls behind them, tied to the back of the bicycles.   Integrated with this are scenes of a night time car ride; the old people split into two car pools. A man in one car talks of society, the power it holds over people, and how the way they live is in a state of true freedom from its clutches.

Triage (film)
 Set in 1988, Mark Walsh (Colin Farrell) is a photojournalist who has earned a reputation for working in some of the most unforgiving locations on Earth. When his editor Amy (Juliet Stevenson) asks him to cover Saddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds, Mark takes the assignment and thinks little of it. His wife Elena (Paz Vega) is considerably more concerned. Mark and his friend and fellow photographer David (Jamie Sives) head off to the war full of confidence. Mark takes photographs of brutally injured soldiers and of a doctor who shoots them dead to spare their suffering. Later on, Mark is seen mildly injured in what he claims to be an accident in the river and he then comes home alone after being separated from David. Elena notices that he is like a different person, gaunt and unable to relax.   Elena can't get Mark to talk about what he saw that left him so traumatized, so she invites her grandfather Joaquin (Christopher Lee), a veteran psychoanalyst with military experience, for a visit to see if he can help. Joaquin struggles to get Mark to open up. The grandfather's presence ignites an old conflict between him and Elena; the doctor was a supporter of Franco during the Spanish Civil War. He had helped Franco's soldiers recover from the guilt of the atrocities they had committed in warfare. Elena had never been able to forgive him for his actions.  The second half of the film depicts Joaquin's patient persistence in getting Mark to face his own memories. Joaquin is particularly curious as to why Mark is more concerned with bringing bodies back to their families rather than survival or death. While Mark is drawing a picture of the area he and David were situated, Diane (Kelly Reilly), David's pregnant wife and Elena enter the apartment and Joaquin tells him he has to come clean with what happened. A flashback reveals that Mark followed David when he decided to leave early. While walking back to the Kurdish camp, they were shelled, which resulted in David losing both of his legs. Mark tried to carry him back.   After he tells them this story, Diane begins labour, and is taken to the hospital, where she delivers a baby girl. Mark, Elena, and Joaquin visit Diane in the hospital. Unable to tell Diane the "end of the story," Mark walks up to the roof and considers jumping. Joaquin and Elena follow him and he tells them that he had jumped in a river with David's arms wrapped around his neck and that once in the water, he could no longer breathe. He released David from his grip and let him go. He tearfully admits that he felt guilty about not bringing him home. Elena embraces him and the film ends with [[Plato]]'s quote: "Only the dead see the end of the war."

 While preparing to take her [[autism|autistic]] son Tommy on a boat trip with her friend Greg, Jess hears the doorbell ring, but no one is there. She later arrives at a harbor in [[Florida]] without Tommy, explaining he's at school, and boards Greg's boat. She meets Greg's married friends Sally and Downey, Sally's friend Heather, and Victor, a runaway teen living with Greg. While out at sea, the wind dies and a storm approaches, and they pick up a [[distress signal]] while radioing the coast guard. The storm capsizes the boat, during which Heather is swept out into the water, and the others climb onto the overturned boat when the storm clears.  They board an [[ocean liner]] as it passes; it appears to be deserted, yet there is fresh food in a dining room. Jess experiences a growing sense of [[déjà vu]] as they explore. They find Jess's keys in a corridor near a display case for [[Aeolus]], the ship's namesake, leading Sally to believe Heather has also boarded. Jess soon spots someone watching them and Victor gives chase. She and Greg continue on and find "Go To Theater" written in blood on a mirror. After they part, she returns to the dining room, where the food is now rotting. Victor enters, covered in blood, and tries to kill Jess; she fights him off by aggravating a wound at the back of his head. She hears gunfire and follows it to a theater, where Greg lies dead of a gunshot. Sally and Downey tell Jess that Greg told them she shot him. They accuse her of the sending them to the theater. A burlap-masked shooter kills them from a balcony and chases Jess to an outside deck; she fights back and disarms the shooter, who tells her "You have to kill them; it's the only way to get home" before falling overboard.  She soon hears yelling, and sees herself and the others alive on Greg's upturned boat. After they board, Jess becomes the earlier unseen figure: she drops her keys near the display case and is spotted shortly after. She attempts to warn Victor when he catches up to her, only to accidentally impale his head on a wall hook. She flees deeper into the ship and finds dozens of duplicates of the shooter's outfit, shotgun, her own locket, and a note saying to kill them all when they board. She takes a shotgun, intending to "change the pattern", but the shooter, another Jess, kills the men and mortally wounds Sally with a knife.  The first Jess chases Sally, who sends the distress signal heard on Greg's boat. Jess catches up to her on an upper deck filled with dozens of Sally corpses, and Sally succumbs to her wound as, below them, the newest Jess kills the shooter Jess. The overturned boat returns again, and Jess realizes the loop restarts once everyone is killed. Desperate to stop and ultimately prevent the loop, Jess sets everything from the first loop into motion, with herself as the shooter. After she is disarmed during the fight on the front deck, she urges her counterpart to kill everyone when they return, and falls overboard.  She awakens washed ashore and discovers that it's the same morning. She returns home and watches from outside her house as her double [[Child abuse|abuses]] Tommy out of anger toward his autism. Promising to change, she distracts her counterpart with the doorbell, then kills her, puts the bagged body in the car trunk, and leaves with Tommy. A seagull hits their windshield and dies, but when she picks it up and disposes  of it, she sees a pile of dead seagulls. Realizing she's still trapped in the loop, Jess hurriedly drives away, but she crashes into a truck and Tommy is killed and the earlier double (who Jess killed) is seen dead at the scene. In the aftermath, the real Jess stands watching the accident scene. A taxi driver approaches her and she accepts a ride to the harbor. After promising to return, she joins the others on Greg's boat, starting the loop again.

Meanwhile, Hegumen Philip arrives in Moscow, and on the way rescues a girl Masha, who is fleeing from a group of guardsmen. Receiving the Hegumen when he arrives, the Tsar invites him to become Metropolitan of Moscow, but Philip initially declines. The Hegumen meets his nephew, who is leaving for the wars and urges the Hegumen to flee from the Tsar, as those around him cannot survive. The Tsar returns to Philip, gives Masha an [[icon]] of the [[Mother of God]], and persuades Hegumen Philip to become Metropolitan. Philip, witnessing the horrors being committed by the Oprichniki, urges the Tsar to show mercy to his enemies.  2. The Tsar at War. Metropolitan Philip's nephew fights in a bloody battle against the Poles and Lithuanians at Polotsk. There is also Masha, who has escaped from the Tsar and brought the icon. Thanks to the icon, the bridge collapses under the Lithuanian cavalry.

The governor is arrested, and [[Malyuta Skuratov]] brands his chest.  3. The Tsar's Wrath.

Killing two commanders, bear attacks Kolycheva. At this point, Masha runs into the arena with the icon and tries to stop the bear. It kills Masha with his paw. Metropolitan Philip, horrified by the senseless brutality of the Tsar, seeing the futility of their attempts to persuade the Tsar to give up violence, enters the arena, and raises the icon. During a service at the Church, he refuses to bless the Tsar, who furiously strips the Metropolitan of his rank and forces him to watch the execution of his nephew on the rack. The Tsar decides to pardon Philip himself, but forever exiles him to a monastery, where he is treated as an ordinary prisoner, shackled, deprived of even water.  4. The Tsar's fun. Heinrich von Staden builds a "torture camp", which is planned to convene the people to festivals and watch the torture of prisoners. During the inspection, the Tsar's jester Vassian quotes the [[Book of Revelation]], comparing [[Maria Temryukovna]] with the [[Whore of Babylon]], for which the Tsar burns him at the stake. Meanwhile, in the monastery Philip's chains are supernaturally loosened, and he receives the gift of healing and foresight. He warns Archbishop Pimen that they will be accused in his death. Philip encourages them to run and save themselves. However, the abbot, and almost all the monks stay with him. The Tsar arrives, but Philip again accuses him of horrific violence and refuses him a blessing. On the orders of the Tsar, Skuratov strangles Philip with his own hands. Despite the order to hand over Philip's corpse, the monks bury Philip in a wooden church and lock it; guardsmen burn the church with the monks inside.  Final Scene - The Tsar waits for the beginning of his tortures. Despite the order to assemble, no one does. "Where are my people?" - asks the Tsar.

Turtles Forever
 The [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|Ninja Turtles]] are alerted by their master [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] that they have been careless and discovered fighting the Purple Dragons on TV. Denying this, they set out to break into the Purple Dragons' HQ to get to the bottom of these [[doppelgänger]]s. Upon doing so, the Turtles discover that their "imposters" are [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|from the 1987 series]]. They escape together, but the 2003 Turtles find the 1987 team childish as they refuse to talk until they eat lunch. They enter a pizza place and terrify the citizens, who call the cops; the 1987 Turtles flee, only for the 2003 Turtles to capture them. They have brought Splinter along with them, to which the 1987 Turtles realize that the [[New York City|New York]] they know has become different. 1987 [[Leonardo (TMNT)|Leonardo]] explains his team was fighting [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] over Mutagen in the [[Technodrome]]. During the battle, the dimensional teleporter malfunctioned, sending them all to the 2003 world. Checking recent tremor reports, the Turtles find the Technodrome, only to have to battle an army of Foot bots led by [[Bebop and Rocksteady]]. When 1987 Shredder hypothesizes the existence of another Shredder in this dimension, he proceeds to elude them. This forces the Turtles to build a portal device to reach their universe for "anti-Technodrome gear". In the meantime, Shredder locates Ch'rell, the [[Utrom Shredder]], on an icy asteroid. After Ch'rell is thawed out, he is contained for vivisection, as he's too insane to work with. However, his adopted daughter [[Karai (character)|Karai]], who had been monitoring his exile, breaks into the Technodrome and frees him.  While tracking the Technodrome, the Turtles and Splinter are attacked by Hun and the Purple Dragons, who want their mutagen. Although Hun is in possession of a powerful mutant, Splinter destroys it with the Turtle Truck's missiles. Unfortunately, Hun tackles 2003 [[Raphael (TMNT)|Raphael]] and 1987 [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]] into the sewers for the mutagen. Unfortunately, just as he retrieves the mutagen and declares victory, he apparently becomes exposed to it; due to the last thing he touched being "mutant turtle filth", he becomes the very thing he hates: a mutant turtle. He wanders until coming upon the Technodrome, now under the control of Ch'rell, who has built a new exoskeleton or himself; Hun vows to serve him again. Utrom Shredder and Karai begin the process of rebuilding the cartoonish fortress and revising it and the Foot bots with Utrom science, making them more worthy of the Utrom Shredder. They have also used mutagen to make a mutant army out of the Foot clan. Utrom Shredder uses the dimensional portal, learning there are many parallel universes filled with ninja turtles. Hun, Bebop, and Rocksteady are dispatched alongside an army of Utrom Foot bots to capture the Turtles, breaking into their lair; it begins crumbling, forcing the Turtles to use their dimensional portal stick to escape into the 1987 universe. Splinter is captured by Hun to serve as bait in a trap. Utrom Shredder decides to launch an all-out assault on the 2003 universe to lure the Turtles out of hiding.  Back in the 1987 universe, the 2003 Turtles meet 1987 [[April O'Neil]] when the 1987 Turtles rescue her from a group of enemies that are confusing to them, though they feel a kinship with the 1987 Splinter, who welcomes them as sons. After both Donatellos apply their expertise, the Turtles are able to return to the 2003 universe with anti-technodrome gear and the 1987 Turtles vehicles, the Party Wagon and Turtle Blimp. They find [[Casey Jones]] and 2003 April attempting to repel the advancing onslaught, and infiltrate the Technodrome, which now looks like the [[Death Star]]. Captured by Utrom Shredder, the Turtles learn they are not the only versions in the multiverse; he plans to kill [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|the Ninja Turtles of the source dimension]], creating a [[domino effect]] that erase every other team of Ninja Turtles in the multiverse. All eight are scanned for shared DNA, seemingly vanishing into oblivion as the Technodrome vanishes to the source dimension (dubbed "Turtle Prime"); however, they are somehow teleported to safety. Unfortunately, Utrom Shredder has already infiltrated the Turtle Prime universe and is now demolishing it; this causes a chain reaction that begins to literally erase everything and everyone in the 2003 universe. Needing to upgrade their portal device, the Turtles break into Purple Dragon HQ; Hun is waiting for them, wanting revenge for his mutation. However, when he sees the world vanishing, Hun surrenders the upgrade tech just before he's erased.  The Turtles accomplish their task and, despite 2003 April and Casey being erased as well, just manage to escape the 2003 universe, and are teleported to the black-and-white Turtle Prime. To their surprise, they quickly encounter their source counterparts, who attack them for no reason until they mention the Shredder. As part of their plan, the other eight will hide while the Prime Turtles lure Utrom Shredder out by insulting his pride. Before he comes out, they are challenged by Shredder Prime, who is comically dispatched by the hiding Turtles. When Utrom Shredder discovers both his Turtles and the 1987 team still alive, Karai reveals that she had teleported them to safety because Ch'rell showed no concern over the [[paradox|consequences]] of eliminating all Ninja Turtle life. With the aid of Splinter, Karai, and even the 1987 Shredder and [[Krang]], all twelve Turtles then engage Utrom Shredder in battle. Ch'rell's exoskeleton grows thanks to molecular amplification technology from Dimension X, but is knocked into the energy the Technodrome is firing and receives damage. Everyone tries knocking him into the beam before Rocksteady accidentally trips on and unplugs the power cable as he and Bebop attempt to help their master. Utrom Shredder seizes and begins crushing the Prime Turtles, causing Turtle Prime and all his enemies to start being erased. Even though his enemies warn him that all of reality, including Ch'rell himself, will vanish, Utrom Shredder continues to crush the Prime Turtles due to being too insane to care, until 1987 Donatello tosses explosive throwing stars at his leg, causing him to release the Prime Turtles, thus halting Turtle Prime's demise. Bebop plugs the Technodrome's beam back in, thus vaporizing Utrom Shredder into nothingness.  With their foe defeated, the Turtles watch as Turtle Prime and the 2003 reality restore themselves. 2003 Splinter and Karai note that Ch'rell always returns no matter how he is defeated, but the various characters decide they'll be there to stop him whenever he may rise again. The 1987 characters board the Technodrome and return to their homeworld, while the 2003 characters use the portal stick to return to theirs. The Prime Turtles decide to go get some pizza to eat, as somewhere else, across time and space, [[Peter Laird]] and [[Kevin Eastman]] put the finishing touches on the first issue of ''[[Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', expressing the hope that the book will sell.

The Unborn (2009 film)
 Casey Beldon has nightmarish hallucinations of strange-looking dogs in the neighborhood and an evil child with bright blue eyes following her around. While [[babysitting]] Matty, her neighbor's son, she finds him showing his infant sibling its reflection in a mirror. Matty attacks Casey, smashing the mirror on her head, and tells her: "Jumby wants to be born now". She puts him to bed and leaves in shock.  Casey's friend Romy tells her of a [[Folklore|superstition]] that newborns should not see their reflections in the mirror for at least a year because otherwise they will die soon. Casey's eyes begin to change color; a doctor asks if she is a twin, and explains the change as [[Chimera (genetics)#Tetragametic chimerism|tetragametic chimerism]] and [[heterochromia]], and that it is completely normal. Her neighbor's infant dies, supporting the superstition.  Casey's father admits that she had a twin brother years ago who died while he was in the womb when [[nuchal cord|her umbilical cord strangled him]], and whom he and Casey's mother had nicknamed "Jumby". She begins to suspect that the spirit is haunting her and this is the soul of her dead twin wanting to be born so it can enter the world of the living as evil.   Casey meets Sofi Kozma&mdash;whom she later learns is her grandmother&mdash;who explains that as a child she had a twin brother who died during [[Nazi human experimentation#Experiments on twins|Nazi experiments]] in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] during [[World War II]]. A [[dybbuk]] brought the brother back to life to use as a portal into the world of the living. Kozma killed her twin to stop the spirit, and now it haunts her family for revenge, which is why Casey's mother became insane and committed suicide.  Kozma gives Casey a [[hamsa]] amulet for protection, instructs her to destroy all mirrors and burn the shards, and refers her to [[Rabbi]] Joseph Sendak, who can perform a Jewish [[exorcism]] to remove the dybbuk out of her soul. Sendak does not believe Casey's story until he sees a dog with its head twisted upside down in his [[synagogue]]. The dybbuk kills Kozma and, soon after, Romy. Casey and her boyfriend Mark&mdash;who both see the spirit after it kills Romy&mdash;realize that it is getting stronger.   Sendak, Mark, [[Episcopal priest]] Arthur Wyndham, and other volunteers begin the exorcism, but the dybbuk attacks them and several are wounded or killed. The spirit, having possessed the priest, chases Casey and Mark. Mark knocks Wyndham unconscious but gets possessed. Casey stabs Mark in the neck with the amulet; Sendak arrives and he and Casey complete the exorcism. The rite draws the dybbuk out of the human world, but Mark falls and dies during the separation.  Casey mourns her boyfriend but still wonders why the dybbuk became suddenly active in her life now, and why it didn't attack her earlier. She takes a pregnancy test, and learns that she is pregnant by Mark, with twins.

Up (2009 film)
  In 1940, nine-year-old Carl Fredricksen idolizes famous explorer Charles F. Muntz. When Muntz is accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls, he vows not to return until he captures one alive. One day, Carl befriends a girl named Ellie, also a Muntz fan. She confides to Carl her desire to move her "clubhouse"—an abandoned house in the neighborhood—to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls.   Carl and Ellie grow up, get married and live in the restored house. Carl sells toy balloons at the zoo where Ellie works. After Ellie suffers a [[miscarriage]]<ref name="miscarriage"></ref> and they are told they cannot have a child, the couple remembers their childhood dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing needs. Finally in the present day, the now elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie suddenly falls ill and dies.  By 2009, Carl still lives in the house, stubbornly [[holdout (real estate)|holding out]] while the neighborhood homes are torn down and replaced by [[skyscraper]]s. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace, ordering him to move to a [[retirement home]]. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift [[airship]], using thousands of helium balloons. Russell, a young "Wilderness Explorer" who visited Carl in his effort to earn his final [[scout badge|merit badge]], for assisting the elderly, becomes an accidental stowaway.  After surviving a [[thunderstorm]], the flying house lands on a [[tepui]] opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall, colorful [[flightless bird]], known as the mythical "Snipe", whom he names "Kevin". They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a [[pack (canine)|pack]] of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a [[Doberman Pinscher]], and are taken to their master, who turns out to be Charles Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his [[Airship|dirigible]], where he explains to them that he is searching for a giant bird. When Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin, Muntz becomes hostile, believing they are attempting to capture the bird themselves. Carl flees with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin. After Carl saves the house, he and Russell eventually reach the falls, though Russell is upset at Carl for abandoning Kevin. Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the "adventure" and encouraging him to go have a new one.   The repentant Carl goes outside, only to see Russell sailing off with some balloons and a propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with the [[Elizabethan collar|cone of shame]] and becomes the dogs' new leader. A determined Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.  After reuniting Kevin with her chicks, Carl and Russell fly the dirigible back to the city. Russell receives his Assisting the Elderly badge, and Carl presents Russell with his own badge: a grape soda cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Meanwhile, Carl's house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls, fulfilling his promise to Ellie.  
The Uninvited (2009 film)
 Anna ([[Emily Browning]]) has been in a [[psychiatric institution]] for ten months, following her [[suicide attempt]] after her terminally ill mother died in a [[boathouse]] fire. Upon her discharge, she has [[Memory repression#Amnesia for trauma or abuse|no memory]] of the event but frequently has related nightmares. While packing, Anna is startled by a disturbing, talkative patient from the room across the hall. Shortly after, she leaves with her father, Steven ([[David Strathairn]]), a writer who has dedicated his latest book to Anna and her sister.  At home, Anna reunites with her sister, Alex ([[Arielle Kebbel]]), with whom she is very close. The sisters stand against Steven's girlfriend Rachel ([[Elizabeth Banks]]), who had been their mother's [[live-in nurse]]. Alex criticizes Steven for sleeping with Rachel while the girls' mother was still alive and sick in bed but he does not respond. Anna describes to Alex how scenes from her dreams have started happening while she is awake. The sisters become convinced that the hallucinations are messages from their mother, telling them that she was murdered by Rachel.  Anna catches up with her old boyfriend, Matt ([[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]]), who tells her that he saw what happened the night of the fire. They secretly planned to meet that night, but Matt fails to show up and Anna returns home. In her room, Anna awakens to find him climbing into her window, saying that she needs to know the truth and that he had a warning from her mother. They kiss but then Anna notices Matt's body suddenly warping and his back breaking. Anna flees from the room in fear but when she opens the door, he is gone. The next morning, Matt's dead body is pulled out of the water, his back broken. The police assume he fell and drowned.  The sisters are unable to find a record of Rachel with the [[List of nursing organizations#State Nursing Boards|State Nursing Association]] and conclude she is actually Mildred Kemp, a nanny who killed the three children she looked after because she had an obsession with their widowed father. They try to warn their father, but he ignores their concerns and leaves for work. The girls try to gather evidence against Rachel to show the police but Rachel catches them and sedates Alex. Anna escapes and goes to the local police station, but they do not believe her claims and call Rachel, who sedates Anna and takes her home.  As Rachel puts a disoriented Anna in bed, Anna sees Alex in the doorway with a knife and then passes out. She wakes to find that Alex has killed Rachel and thrown her body into a dumpster. As the girls comfort each other, a horrified Steven arrives and asks what happened. Anna explains that Rachel tried to murder her and her sister but Alex saved their lives by killing Rachel. Steven is confused; he explains that Alex died in the fire along with her mother. Anna then notices that she is not holding her sister's hand, but the bloody knife used to murder Rachel.   Anna finally remembers what happened on the night of the fire. After catching her father and Rachel having sex, Anna became enraged and filled a watering can from a large gasoline tank in the boathouse, intending to set them and the house on fire. She did not close the tap properly and a trail of gasoline was ignited by a falling candle. Her mother and Alex were killed in the resulting explosion. Flashbacks reveal that Anna had been hallucinating Alex since she left the institution. She remembers killing Matt—who did show up at their planned meeting—by letting him fall and break his back. She also remembers killing Rachel, who was surprisingly a kinder person than she had imagined.  As the police arrest Anna for murder, Steven is questioned by an officer. He explains that Rachel changed her name years ago to escape an abusive boyfriend.   At the institution, Anna is welcomed back by the patient across the hall that scared her earlier; the name plate on her door reads "Mildred Kemp".  
Underworld: Rise of the Lycans
 The film tells the story of [[Underworld (film series)#Lucian|Lucian]], the first werewolf born capable of taking human form and the first to be called a ''Lycan''. [[Underworld (film series)#Viktor|Viktor]], a vampire elder, raises the child, envisioning a race of Lycan slaves guarding the coven's fortress during the day and working as laborers for the vampires at night. The forests and the countryside are filled with savage werewolves born from [[Underworld (film series)#William|William]]'s rampage, and human nobles have taken to begging Viktor for protection against the beasts: he grants it in exchange for tributes of silver, which enables him to keep his slaves under control. As Lucian grows up, he and Viktor's daughter [[Underworld (film series)#Sonja|Sonja]] ([[Rhona Mitra]]) fall in love, and in their adult years they begin a secretive intimate relationship. Sonja is reckless and insubordinate, and one night Lucian escapes the shackles preventing him from turning werewolf and rescues Sonja from his werewolf brethren. Despite acknowledging that Lucian rescued his daughter, Viktor cannot forgive the escape and has Lucian whipped and imprisoned.  By trading her seat on the vampire council, Sonja enlists the help of [[Underworld (film series)#Andreas Tanis|Andreas Tanis]] in orchestrating Lucian's release. Lucian, unable to flee alone, liberates the other Lycans as he escapes. Sonja remains, planning to meet Lucian in three days. As she prepares to leave she is visited by her father. Viktor asks if she assisted in Lucian's escape: she denies it, but he discovers the truth by biting her neck and reading her memories through her blood. Discovering her relationship with Lucian, he imprisons her. Meanwhile, in the forest, Lucian recruits both human slaves and werewolves to build a force against the vampires. In the fortress, the vampire council and nobles demand that Viktor recapture Lucian, as his Lycans have been attacking human estates, freeing their slaves and offering them immortality as Lycans themselves. Viktor replies that he is confident Lucian will return as he has something Lucian wants: Sonja.  Lucian learns about Sonja's imprisonment and eventually rescues her from her room but they are stopped from escaping by Viktor. Sonja, hoping to spare Lucian's life, reveals to Viktor that she is pregnant with Lucian's child. Disgusted, Viktor overpowers her and imprisons both her and Lucian. Sonja is unanimously sentenced to death by the council at a trial presided over by her father, and is executed by exposure to sunlight in Lucian's presence. Viktor later visits her body and retrieves her pendant.  Lucian turns werewolf, but his attempt to escape the fortress is thwarted by the Death Dealers. He is able to communicate with and control the wild werewolves, however, and summons them to storm the fortress. A melee ensues in which vampire council members, their aides and lesser vampire nobles are killed. Realizing that Viktor intends to flee, Lucian pursues him and they fight. Lucian traps Viktor by exposing him to shafts of sunlight and then stabs him through the mouth with a sword and pushes his body down into a nearby body of water. With the battle over, Lucian's deputy Raze declares that "it is finished", but Lucian knows this victory is only the beginning of what will become a war between the races.  The film's [[Post-credits scene|coda]] reveals Viktor, having survived his wound, on a vampire ship fleeing the fortress and being sealed in an elder hibernation chamber by Tanis. The opening scene of the first ''Underworld'' film is also shown, with the voice of vampire [[Underworld (film series)#Kraven|Kraven]] ([[Shane Brolly]]) revealing to [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] ([[Kate Beckinsale]]) that it was Viktor who had killed her family, not the Lycans, and that he had spared her life because she reminded him of his executed daughter Sonja; Selene, unaware of the truth, dismisses Kraven's statement as "lies".  
Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)
  The recently dismissed police commissioner of Chennai, Maraar ([[Mohanlal]]) describes in a voice-over about his sudden termination due to a common man who walked into his life.  An unnamed man ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is shown strategically placing a travel bag in a train in the Chennai Central railway station and in a shopping mall. He proceeds to place another bag, under the pretence of lodging an [[First Information Report|FIR]], in the toilet of a police station in Anna Salai, Chennai. He then arrives on the rooftop of an under-construction building and sets up his base of operations, equipped with gadgets and instruments. He calls up Maraar and informs him that five bombs have been planted in locations throughout Chennai, which are programmed to explode simultaneously within four hours.  The caller demands that he would like to negotiate with a senior government official, who has the full authority. Maraar seeks the services of the chief secretary ([[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]]) to act as the negotiator. Maraar also alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance, tapping all the available resources in gathering preliminary information and tracing the location of the caller. Meanwhile, the caller tips off news reporter Natasha Rajkumar ([[Anuja Iyer]]), telling her to reach Anna Salai police station immediately.  Maraar initially suspects the caller to be bluffing, but his doubts are dispelled as the caller, to prove his seriousness and the police force's helplessness, reveals that a bomb has been planted in the Anna Salai police station. When the bomb disposal squad find the bomb, there is only three minutes left. They manage to deactivate the bomb after following the caller's instructions. Natasha reaches the scene on the caller's instructions and reports about the situation. An intense debate ensues between Maraar and the chief secretary on who would act as the negotiator with the caller. The chief secretary appoints Maraar as the State's negotiator with unrestricted power for one day. The caller talks full of life logics and religious philosophy and finally asks Maarar to release three Muslim terrorists and one convicted arms seller, all who were arrested by him years ago.  Maraar's men realise that the caller is using advanced software to automatically switch the numbers and locations of his mobile phone SIM card every minute, rendering their manpower and the obsolete equipment useless and prompting them to employ the services of a young hacker, an [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]] drop-out. In the meantime, Maraar is able to obtain a facial composite of the caller with help of the police officer to whom the caller had approached to lodge the fake FIR, but much of the time passes without any concrete results on the identity or the location of the caller.  Ultimately, Maraar agrees with the caller's demand and puts two of his best men, Arif Khan ([[Ganesh Venkatraman]]) and Sethuraman ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]]), in charge of handing over the four terrorists at the Sozhavaram airstrip. Once there, the caller confirms the identity of the four men via a conference call with Arif and Maraar. He then asks Arif and Sethu to unlock their handcuffs and leave them alone at a particular spot. Sethu orders his men to do as told but, at the last moment, Arif decides not to hand over terrorist Abdullah, to ensure all the information regarding the locations of the bombs can be forced out from the caller. Sethu argues with Arif and demands he do as ordered, but Arif forcefully grabs Abdullah and starts walking away. The other three enter a car which explodes soon after, killing them. But the caller knows that Abdullah is alive.  The caller threatens to blow up the remaining bombs across the city unless Arif and Sethu kill Abdullah. The Chief Secretary tells Maraar that the Chief Minister has to know about the current situation but Maraar disagrees and tells her that he will face the consequences, and orders Arif to kill the terrorist. Arif kills Abdullah and Sethu shoots Arif in the hand to make it look like an attack for self-defense. The caller confirms it via the news and reveals that he was bluffing and there are no more bombs anywhere in Chennai. He tells that as terrorism is instant, justice and safety must be so. Then Maarar questions the IIT hacker to trace the caller, but he refuses. But Maraar looks in the hacker's computer, discovers the location, and leaves abruptly towards the site. The caller, meanwhile destroys all of his gadgets with a mini-bomb inside a drum. As he leaves his hideout with all his camouflage, Maarar catches up to him.  Both shake hands; in a voiceover, Maraar says the caller told him his real name, but does not reveal it as it does not have any significance. He adds that the higher most officials saved themselves by framing him as a recluse and the CM fired him. Maraar admits that they all knew the caller was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities but he never imagined him to go to such lengths and have the guts to do something like that. He also repeats that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it. He acknowledges that although the incidence has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best.  
Universal Soldier: Regeneration
 A group of terrorists led by Commander Topov ([[Zahari Baharov]]) kidnap the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Ukrainian Prime Minister]]'s son and daughter and hold them hostage, demanding the release of their imprisoned comrades within 72 hours. In addition, they have taken over the crippled [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and threaten to detonate it if their demands are not met. It is revealed that among the ranks of the terrorists is an experimental Next-Generation UniSol (NGU) ([[Andrei Arlovski]]), who was smuggled in by rogue scientist Dr. Robert Colin ([[Kerry Shale]]). U.S. forces join up with the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces|Ukrainian Army]] at the plant, but quickly retreat when the NGU slaughters most of them effortlessly.  Dr. Richard Porter ([[Garry Cooper]]), Dr. Colin's former colleague on the Universal Soldier program, revives four UniSols to take down the NGU, but they are systematically eliminated.  Former UniSol [[Luc Deveraux]] ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]), who is undergoing rehabilitation therapy in [[Switzerland]] with Dr. Sandra Fleming ([[Emily Joyce]]) with the goal of rejoining society, is taken back by the military to participate in the mission. As the deadline nears its expiration, the prime minister announces the release of the prisoners. The terrorists, having gotten what they wanted, rejoice and shut off the bomb. Dr. Colin, however, is not pleased with the outcome, as he feels his side of the business is not done. As the NGU is programmed not to harm the terrorists, Dr. Colin unleashes his second UniSol: a cloned and upgraded version of Andrew Scott ([[Dolph Lundgren]]) - Deveraux's nemesis - who quickly kills Commander Topov. However, Dr. Colin never considered Scott's mental instability, and he is killed by his own creation. Scott then reactivates the bomb before heading out to hunt the children.  In the midst of the chaos, Capt. Kevin Burke ([[Mike Pyle (fighter)|Mike Pyle]]) is sent in to infiltrate the plant and rescue the prime minister's children. He is successful in locating them and leads them toward safety. On their way out, they encounter the NGU. The children flee as Burke tries in vain to hold off the NGU, who stabs him to death after a brutal fight.  With 30 minutes remaining on the bomb's timer, a re-conditioned Deveraux is geared up and sent to the plant, where he kills every terrorist he encounters. He searches the buildings and finds the children cornered by Scott.  Scott, who has distorted memories of Deveraux, is about to kill the children when Deveraux attacks and a grueling fight ensues. In the end, Deveraux impales Scott on the forehead with a lead pipe and fires a shotgun through it, blowing his brains out.  As Deveraux escorts the children to safety, they are attacked by the NGU. Deveraux and the NGU take the fight to the site of the bomb, with less than two minutes remaining. During the melee, Deveraux removes the detonator and jams it in the back of the NGU's uniform as they both jump out of the reactor chamber. NGU pulls the detonator off his back as it explodes, taking him with it. U.S. soldiers quickly arrive on the scene and tend to the children as Deveraux leaves. Burke's body is placed in a black bag and taken away, as well as recovered pieces of the NGU.  In [[Langley, Virginia]], Burke's body is shown stored in a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] chamber as a new UniSol, along with multiple [[Cloning|clones]] made of him.

Up in the Air (2009 film)
 Ryan Bingham works for a [[Human Resources]] consultancy firm which specializes in [[termination of employment|termination]] assistance, and makes his living traveling to workplaces across the United States, conducting company layoffs and firings on behalf of employers. He also gives motivational speeches, using the analogy "What's in Your Backpack?" to extol the virtues of a life free of burdensome relationships with people as well as things. A frequent flyer, Ryan has no fixed abode, relishes his travels, and desires to become the seventh and youngest person to earn ten million [[frequent-flyer program|frequent flyer]] miles with [[American Airlines]]. During his travels, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex, and they begin a [[casual relationship]].  Ryan is called back to his company's offices in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Natalie Keener, a young and ambitious new hire, promotes a program designed to cut costs by conducting layoffs via [[video conference|videoconferencing]]. Ryan raises concerns that the program could be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows nothing about the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes.  As they travel together, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant that he is more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by [[text message]], and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him. Another threatens to commit suicide. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex in spite of their obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program.   Instead of returning immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex to accompany him to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a cutout picture of them in various places was because they cannot afford a [[honeymoon]]. When the groom gets [[cold feet]], Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade the groom to go through with the wedding. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding goes off without any further hitches.  Ryan begins having second thoughts about his life and philosophies. As he starts delivering his "What's in Your Backpack?" speech at a convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], he realizes he no longer believes it, and walks off the stage. On an impulse, he flies to Alex's home in Chicago. When she opens the door, Ryan is stunned to discover she is married and has children, and leaves before her husband can suspect anything. She later tells him over the phone that her family is her real life and he is an escape.  On Ryan's flight home, the crew announces that he has just crossed the ten million mile mark, and a small celebration is thrown. The airline's chief pilot comes out of the cockpit to meet Ryan. He notes that Ryan is the youngest person to reach the milestone. When asked where he is from, a disheartened Ryan can only respond, "here."  Ryan calls the airline to transfer five hundred thousand miles each to his sister and brother-in-law, enough for them to fly around the world for their honeymoon. His boss tells Ryan that a woman he and Natalie fired during their travels has killed herself, and that an upset Natalie has quit via text message. The company also puts the remote-layoff program on hold.  Natalie applies for a job in San Francisco, where she was offered a job before following her now ex-boyfriend to Omaha. The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her. The film concludes with Ryan standing in front of a vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his luggage.

Valhalla Rising (film)
 Somewhere in the [[Scottish Highlands]], a mysterious mute [[thrall]] with one eye is held captive by a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] chieftain from [[Sutherland]] and forced to fight to the death against others. During his imprisonment, the man is brought his meals by a young boy, who seems to sympathise with him. One day, the man manages to break free, killing the chieftain and his entourage and impaling the chieftain's head on a pike. As he sets out across the land on foot, the man soon realizes that the boy is following him.  They reach a small group of [[Christian]] [[Norsemen]] who are persecuting the heathens of [[Scandinavian Scotland]]. The leader of the group asks the boy about the man's origins and he, dubbing the man as 'One-Eye', tells that he came from across the ocean, possibly hinting that he is from [[Vinland]], which the boy refers to as [[Helheim|Hel]]. (The name 'One-Eye' is not without significance in a conflict between [[Christian]] and [[pagan]] faiths - [[Odin]], the Father of the Norse gods, is believed to have given one of his eyes in order to obtain understanding of the [[Runes]].) 'One-Eye' and the boy agree to sail with them to the [[Holy Land]] on a [[Crusade]]; the expedition encounters thick fog not long after setting sail and gets hopelessly lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. After many days, with supplies dwindling, land is sighted.  Sailing up a river, they are attacked by locals who use primitive stone arrowheads, and the group realises that they are nowhere near the Holy Land, and have in fact sailed far away from [[Europe]]. Their leader nevertheless contemplates attempting to conquer the locals and claim the land, while 'One-Eye' has a vision of him trying to build a [[cairn]]. Some of the group members begin to angrily blame 'One-Eye' for their predicament, and he is forced to kill them; he and the boy then leave and walk into the forest, followed soon after by the group’s second in command who has been stabbed by the leader for choosing to follow. The leader’s son then arrives to follow, as the leader stays behind to be killed by arrows. As the remainder of the group reaches the peak of a mountain, the son decides to return, so as not to leave his father, and the second in command is left to presumably die on the mountain. The fate of these two men is left unknown.  'One-Eye' and the boy eventually reach the coastline and are soon met by over a dozen clay-covered warriors. 'One-Eye' regards them knowingly, as he has already foreseen this event in a vision. He puts his hand on the boy's arm, then walks into the middle of the tribesmen. He drops his axe and his knife and closes his eye. One of the warriors, understanding what he wants them to do, fells him with one blow to the back of the head, before the other warriors finish him off. 'One-Eye's' spirit walks into the estuary next to his cairn and disappears below the surface. On the beach, the remaining tribe members quietly withdraw back into the forest, leaving the boy looking out at the ocean. The sky grows dark and 'One-Eye's' face appears in the clouds.

The woman's father, Francis Costello ([[Johnny Hallyday]]), arrives to visit his daughter who is now suffering from serious injuries. She is nevertheless able to tell her father that there were three shooters and that she shot one of the killers in the ear. At a hotel, Costello meets Kwai ([[Anthony Wong Chau-sang|Anthony Wong]]), Chu ([[Gordon Lam|Lam Ka-Tung]]) and Fat Lok ([[Lam Suet]]), a trio of hitmen who are hired to murder the unfaithful wife of Triad crime boss George Fung ([[Simon Yam]]). After overhearing the murder in a hotel room, Costello reaches an unspoken agreement to walk away. Costello later tracks down Kwai's syndicate, hands them a stack of [[euros]] and his watch, and asks them to help him avenge his daughter's family's deaths. Before doing so though, he takes a Polaroid picture of each of the hitmen, and writes their names on the pictures so that he will not forget who they are. The four go to the apartment where the shooting occurred and work out what happened, the number of shooters and the weapons used.  The four visit a landfill to meet Kwai's cousin Tony, who supplies illegal arms. Tony tells them that he "sawed off" a matching weapon for a Hong Kong hitman who works on Seafood Street. As the four men reach the street, they see a man with a bandage over his ear. However, they see only two men. Kwai's syndicate decide to wait until the men lead them to the third attacker. The two suspects head towards the countryside as Kwai's syndicate follows.  The two men later reach a [[nature reserve]] as the third killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's syndicate during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout in front of the three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to treat their wounds. Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had a bullet in his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory.  Shortly after they have tended to their wounds, Kwai receives a phone call from triad boss Fung, who informs him that three of his men need help, and are with an underground non-registered doctor known as "Old Five". Fung tells Kwai that his men were attacked by three Chinese men and one white man. The four men realize that Fung ordered the hit on Costello's daughter and her family. They head to the dwelling and kill the three attackers but leave Old Five alive, who telephones Fung reporting what had happened. Fung then contacts Kwai, explaining that Costello's son-in-law was handing over Fung's financial reports to the police, and that he only ordered his men to kill the parents. Kwai replies that his syndicate has switched their loyalty from Fung to Costello as a matter of honor.  Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's refuge in order to eliminate Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello has a problem with his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman ([[Michelle Ye]]) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.  The next day, Fung is having tea in a public square surrounded by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (Kwai's pregnant friend) having tea in the same square. As he tries to get her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. The pregnant woman leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.  Costello picks up the trenchcoat and shoots more subordinates who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.

When Uma asks Chella to contribute money, he willingly donates, but violates her modesty by placing the money between her breasts. Chella abducts all of Uma's father's vehicles, and blackmails them to send Uma to him for one day in exchange for all vehicles.  Uma's father declines and is about to send her out of town to their village. Ravi learns out what had happened to Uma, and he comes to her defense and heavily beats up Chella, hospitalizing him. His troubles start from there as Chella's father, the most powerful, rich and prime [[Boss (crime)|don]] named Vedanayagam ([[Salim Ghouse]]), with the help of his right-hand man, a corrupt police officer ACP (Assistant Commissioner of Police) Kattabomman ([[Sayaji Shinde]]), begin to create havoc in Ravi's life. Ravi is soon imprisoned on a false case of [[illegal drug trade|drug smuggling]] and is expelled from his college. Only Susheela and Ravi's friend Valayapathi ([[Srinath (actor)|Srinath]]) are willing to help him. Susheela goes to Devaraj and pleads with him to help Ravi, but Devaraj initially refuses to help as his entire family was murdered by Vedanayagam, and he himself was blinded by Vedanayagam because he had taken action against him and his gang. However, with the help of his henchmen, he saves Ravi from being killed in a fake encounter led by Kattabomman.  Ravi then visits Devaraj and knows the truth about him. Without a way into the society, Ravi visits Vedanayagam himself. Vedanayagam gives Ravi a tour of his whole empire and life history. He tells Ravi that his only key was the Fear about him in people's minds. He orders a  driver of his illegal spirit factory about to smuggle his illicit liquor to drop Ravi on the way. But Ravi abducts the vehicle en route. Ravi then visits Kattabomman. He blackmails Kattabomman into registering a case against Vedhanayagam for smuggling liquor, as he has kidnapped Kattabomman's second wife. Ravi also takes help from a local rich businessmen and clears some cases against him. Ravi also kills the terrorist whose encounter he was to be killed, by using Kattabomman's gun.  It is at this stage, that Ravi takes on a new persona called "Police" Ravi to clean up the illegal activities of Vedanayagam and instill hope in the public, something that Devaraj was unable to do. He removes all instincts of fear and ruins Vedanayagam's future plans. Chella suddenly awakens from his coma, and pressurizes Kattabomman to kill Ravi. When Kattabomman fails to do so, Chella sleeps with Kattabomman's second wife and kicks Kattabomman out, reforming him. Due to Ravi's increasing power, Vedanayagam kills Ravi's close friend Sugu ([[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]]).

As Ravi finally plans to kill the soon-to-be Home Minister Vedanayagam, the police arrive to arrest him. However, Ravi sees Devaraj in the crowd and shouts Vedanayagam's location to him just as he is being arrested, allowing Devaraj to assassinate Vedanayagam, effectively taking his revenge. In the end, Devaraj is reinstated into the police force as a trainer and offers to make Ravi a police officer, as he can nominate him as his heir.

The Vicious Kind
 The film opens with Caleb Sinclaire sitting in a diner, forlorn and smoking a cigarette. He begins to cry, but composes himself when his younger brother, Peter approaches the table.  Peter is an idealistic  college student on Thanksgiving break and Caleb is begrudgingly giving him a ride home. At school, Peter has found a new girlfriend, Emma Gainsborough, and Caleb immediately grills him for details. Emma and Peter met each other while Emma was on campus meeting some fraternity boys; while Peter says she’s a good girl and nothing happened, Caleb immediately perceives her as a whore. On the way to get Emma, Caleb reveals that he hasn't slept in a week.  Caleb is immediately antagonistic to Emma. Caleb drops them off at his father, Donald’s house, revealing to Emma that he and Donald do not get along and this will be the last time he will see them this weekend.  Donald comes off as well-meaning, if somewhat flirtatious.  Caleb meanwhile, has been trying to sleep, but keeps seeing images of his last girlfriend, Hannah, who behaves and looks strikingly similar to Emma. Hannah has continuously called Caleb, so he drops off pictures of himself having sex with a prostitute named Samantha at her doorstep, ringing the bell and fleeing.  Caleb, arrives at work and belittles fellow worker JT. Later, Emma and Peter go bowling and Caleb secretly watches them.  In the bowling alley lobby, Caleb bumps into Emma.  They have an awkward conversation and she asks him for cigarettes, revealing she secretly smokes. Caleb obliges; Emma asking him to promise not to tell Peter, and Caleb asking not to reveal he was there to Peter or Donald.  Later Caleb runs into Emma. He ends up viciously physically and verbally attacking her, and threatens her not to hurt Peter, who is a good kid (and a virgin). Moments later, he breaks down, begging her forgiveness. Confused and outraged, Emma punches him, bloodying his nose and dropping him to the pavement. Caleb sits on the ground crying and apologizing.  That night, Emma sneaks out for a cigarette and meets Caleb trying to sneak around the yard with a camera. Emma wants an explanation about what happened earlier. Caleb goes into his belief on what he heard about her at school, his girlfriend Hannah who cheated on him, and his lack of sleep, which has further muddled his actions and behavior. Caleb eventually leaves, feeling better after these confessions.  The next morning, Donald and Emma go jogging together. Emma asks about Peter’s mother, and Donald reveals that she died when Caleb and Peter were young. Donald also says that his wife cheated on him prior to being diagnosed with cancer and that no one came to visit her in the hospital the last four months of her life. At work, Caleb reveals he managed to fall asleep for a few minutes the night before.  At a cheap restaurant, Caleb, Peter and Emma are together. Caleb and Emma get a few moments alone, and Caleb assures her that he doesn’t have feelings for her. Caleb ends up forcibly kissing her. Emma says nothing about it to Peter. Caleb privately warns Peter to watch Emma carefully, because she's been eyeing him. Peter says he’s in love with her and wants to give her his virginity, and Caleb laughs at the idea. Caleb apologizes for his ideas that she was a whore.  While Peter and Emma prepare to have intercourse, Peter reveals that what Donald told her is true, except that Caleb was the only one to see their mother before she died, and Caleb and Donald haven’t spoken to each other since. Caleb goes to see Samantha, and asks her if it’s normal to be in love with a perceived image of someone, even if that’s not who they really are (likening Emma to Hannah). Caleb asks Samantha if she was abused as a child, and Samantha is offended. Caleb loses his temper, then comes back and gives her a better tip, implying that his perception and treatment of women is evolving.  Caleb tries apologizing to Emma for kissing her and says he’ll try not to bother her anymore. Emma reveals she has accidentally locked herself out of the house, and Caleb manages to get them both inside through a window. Emma falls on top of Caleb, and they seem like they might be about to kiss. But she rebukes him and asks him never to see her again. Caleb leaves, and Emma returns to the place they embraced to masturbate.  At a bar, JT asks Caleb if he’s had sex with Emma yet, and he says no, but he wants to. He spots some men sexually harassing a woman and ends up fighting them, marking another change in him.  Peter tries to have sex with Emma but ejaculates prematurely. Caleb drives over to see Emma, and this time, she doesn’t rebuke him when he kisses her, and eventually, they end up having passionate sex in Caleb's old room.  Emma asks why Caleb was the only one to see his mother before she died. He reveals he was hurt by her cheating, and shut her out of his life. However, he eventually discovered that Donald had been the one cheating until his wife finally left, never thinking that he would refuse to let her see her sons. Caleb never told Peter because he was only 12. Emma tells Caleb she was a virgin. Caleb leaves and reminds Emma that Peter is in love with her. On his way out, he runs into his father who deduces what happened and says he’ll tell Peter. Caleb calls him a coward for erasing him out of his life; in the last 8 years, Donald never attempted to re-enter his life. They both hide quickly as Peter goes to Emma’s room, and Caleb dictates to Donald that he won’t tell Peter what he did, otherwise he’ll tell him Donald’s secrets and he’ll lose both his sons. Peter and Emma sleep together, and he loses his virginity to her.  The next morning, Donald drives them to the train station back to school. Donald confesses that he’s made mistakes to Peter, and that sometimes, people know what they are doing is wrong but they do it anyway, because the right thing is painful. On the train, Peter tells Emma he loves her, but it causes Emma to cry. The two of them alone again, Caleb rings Donald’s doorbell and Donald invites him in, their relationship beginning to mend at last.

The attention of characters first seems to rest on the [[1988 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup finals]], which are in play in Boston with [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s [[Edmonton Oilers]] facing the [[Boston Bruins]]. Since Ben Spektor's life is mostly centered on hockey, he is portrayed as the star player of his Toronto Red Wings minor hockey league team, resembling the skills of a young Gretzky throughout the film's opening scenes. However, a life-altering event changes the course of Ben's path as he attends a [[Bob Dylan]] concert alongside his juvenile close friends: Sammy ([[John Mavro]]) and Noah (Scott Beaudin). While there, Ben spots Jordan Chapman ([[Mitchell Amaral]]), his classmate, hockey teammate, and tormentor, taking part in what appears to be a routine drug deal. Being short of five dollars to purchase the drugs, Jordan provokes Ben into reluctantly spotting him the remainder. This critical affair seemed hardly significant to Ben at the time— he could not have foreshadowed the life-altering consequences this event would have on his future.  As the days pass, Jordan's whereabouts are a mystery, and the city police organize a search party that is ultimately fruitless. With a guilty conscience and the fear of Jordan's disappearance, the days drag on for Ben. However, the sequence of events initiate a budding romance for Ben and Jordan's fifteen-year-old sister, Cayla ([[Holly Deveaux]]). From love and romance, to the future of Ben's hockey career, Ben's adolescent life appears to be promising. Yet, the continuous discomfort of his teammate's disappearance preoccupies Ben's life, drastically altering the determined path of his promising future.

Virtuality (film)
 The story is set aboard the ''Phaeton'', Earth's first starship, on a ten-year journey to explore the nearby [[Epsilon Eridani]] star system. In order to help the 12-person crew endure the long mission, a system of [[virtual reality]] modules are installed aboard the ship.<ref name="wired" /> These modules, which are worn like glasses and suppress real-world body movement, allow the crew to assume various identities and enjoy a variety of adventures.<ref name="wired" /> The crew's experiences aboard the ship are broadcast back to Earth as Fox's [[reality television]] program ''Edge of Never: Life on the Phaeton''.<ref name="wired" />  The pilot picks up approximately six months after the launch of ''Phaeton''. The crew now faces a "go or no-go" situation, in that they are fast approaching their last chance to change course back towards Earth. However, their home planet is quickly becoming uninhabitable, with dry land becoming increasingly rare. Scientists estimate that the planet will become completely inhospitable within the next hundred years. The ''Phaeton''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s priority mission has been changed to that of searching out and discovering a new planet for humans to inhabit.  Unfortunately, as the crew fast approaches their point of no return beyond the planet [[Neptune]], several problems arise. Dr. Adin Meyer (Metwally), the crew's only physician, becomes aware that he is in the early stages of [[Parkinson's disease]]. Via use of the ''Phaeton's'' virtual reality programs, Commander Frank Pike (Coster-Waldau) has begun a secret sexual relationship with botanist Rika Goddard (Guillory), whose husband, psychologist Dr. Roger Fallon (D'Arcy), is also a part of the crew, the mission psychologist and producer of ''Edge of Never''.  Meanwhile, the crew's virtual reality simulators have been experiencing several bizarre glitches, all of which involve a mysterious man, whose acts against the crew inside the virtual simulations become more and more disturbing, including "murdering" Pike during a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] re-enactment and "killing" Meyer by pushing him off a cliff. Despite the hardships, the crew unanimously decides to continue on with the 10-year voyage.  After Billie Kashmiri (Bishé), the new host of ''Edge of Never'', is beaten and raped by the mystery man within the virtual world, the crew considers discontinuing use of the virtual reality programs, possibly for the remainder of the voyage. Now past their "point of no return", the crew faces the prospect of continuing on for an entire decade within the confines of the ''Phaeton'' without a virtual world for comfort.  The communications array fails to deploy, and after Dr. Jules Braun (designer of most of the ''Phaeton''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s systems, played by Erik Jensen) tries everything that he can from inside the ship, Pike, Rika, Val Orlovsky (Farber) and Manny Rodriguez (Cantillo) prepare to identify the problem from the outside. However, while preparing for [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]], the airlock chamber closes by itself, with Pike inside and without his pressure suit helmet.  Despite efforts to save him, the airlock opens and Pike is killed.  His death leaves the crew in shambles.  Braun, however, believes Pike's death was murder, and does not know whom to trust.  The ''Phaeton''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s drive engineer and second in command, Dr. Jimmy Johnson (Coster), unwillingly assumes command, foreseeing conflict with the crew as he is a somewhat abrasive loner. While going over the ship's recording of Pike's death, Fallon discovers Pike's last confession of love to Rika.  Rika finds Pike's virtual reality headset in her quarters, and when she wears it, she finds herself in Pike's favorite simulation: a tactical military command of the Civil War era. Inside the simulation, she encounters what appears to be a simulation of Pike that tells her, "None of this is real," and only by following him "through the looking-glass and down the rabbit hole" will she learn the truth.  He rides off on horseback into the virtual sunset, with Rika crying out Pike's name in desperation.

Due to this, Commissioner Ashraf Taufiq Khan ([[Govind Namdeo]]) decides to make Mumbai free of crime. He arrests Gani Bhai, who makes various attempts to contact Radhe, however, in vain. Ashraf is blackmailed to release Gani Bhai, after his men release an explicit video of his daughter online after kidnapping her. Under the influence of drugs, his daughter reveals a mission that involves an IPS officer, Rajveer Singh Shekhawat, murdering Gani Bhai.

Walled In
 Sam Walczak ([[Mischa Barton]]), is a recent engineering graduate. At her graduation party, her father, an owner of a demolition company, gives her a gift: a job supervising the demolition of a building in the middle of nowhere. If she's successful, she will become his partner. Sam arrives at the Malestrazza Building, and is greeted by Mary ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), the caretaker.  Sam tells Mary she will be staying in one of the apartments in the building. Jimmy ([[Cameron Bright]]), the caretaker's teenage son, takes her bags to her apartment and explains the rules of the building.  She is to stay off the eighth floor because it is Malestrazza's and the roof because it is too dangerous.  Sam researches the building and discovers that it was the scene of a horrible series of murders where sixteen people were entombed in the walls.  Jimmy takes Sam to the eighth floor and tells her how his father was one of the victims, the crime being blamed on a local factory worker.  The lights go out, and Sam cuts her leg after panicking in the darkness.  Later, Jimmy washes her wound and begins to caress her thigh, but she tells him to stop.  Sam begins having nightmares about being entombed in the walls.  Sam's boyfriend arrives, causing Jimmy to grow jealous.  While exploring the eighth floor, Sam and her boyfriend discover a secret passage which would allow someone to secretly view any of the apartments.  Sam realizes that Jimmy has been spying on her.  Later, as Sam and her boyfriend make love, Jimmy watches from behind the walls.  The next morning they find his dog, butchered.  Sam and her boyfriend agree to leave.  Jimmy gives Sam a copy of the journal of Malestrazza, the building's architect.  Sam realizes from reading the journal that there must be a large, open space in the center of the building.  Jimmy goes to the roof to look for an opening to the hidden space.  When he does not return, Sam and her boyfriend follow.  They discover a massive shaft in the center of the building.  They hear Jimmy calling from down in the shaft, saying that he is hurt.  Sam has her boyfriend lower her into the shaft on a rope, but he is shot and killed, causing Sam to fall to the bottom. Jimmy then mails Sam's demolition report and sinks her car into a lake.  Sam awakens at the bottom of the shaft and discovers that a man is there with her.  He is Malestrazza, the architect, who has been trapped there by Jimmy.  He tells her that Jimmy is keeping her down there until she learns to love him. Sam also learns that Malestrazza was the mastermind behind the murders and is dumbfounded that people believe that a factory worker could concoct such a scheme of entombing people.  He also tells her that if he does what Jimmy wants, Jimmy is nice, but can be very cruel and imaginative when he disobeys Jimmy's orders.  Jimmy is back at the hole and sends down a cassette tape. Malestrazza plays the tape, and Jimmy says that he wants to see Sam and Malestrazza dance. Sam reluctantly dances, but, when Jimmy tells them to kiss, she refuses. Malestrazza pulls her close and forces her to kiss him. After a few seconds, Jimmy tells them to stop and threatens Malestrazza not to touch Sam again. He sends down a basket with food, water, and a two-way radio. He tells Sam to keep the radio with her so that they can talk and be close.  Sam looks for a way to escape and realizes one wall leads to the garbage area. When Jimmy returns, she lies and says that she is hurt and needs medicine. When Jimmy brings her the medicine, she opens the capsules and starts creating a mix to try and blow out the wall to get into the garbage room. Sam's attempt fails, and Jimmy is upset that she tried to escape.  Before Jimmy could exact his punishment, his mother, Mary, catches him. Mary realizes that Sam is in the hole with Malestrazza. Mary tells Jimmy that place was for the architect not for anyone else. She realizes that Sam must stay in the hole with Malestrazza, or else they'll take her away and Jimmy will be an orphan.  Sam is stuck in the hole with Malestrazza, who she realizes does not want to escape. This is his tomb, and he picked her to kill him. She eventually does kill him after some taunting, and he thanks her after he falls into his tomb and it begins to fill with cement. Sam is by the wall hoping that Jimmy will come through and save her.  The demolition team arrives and her father asks where Sam is. Mary tells him that she left. Her father says that he thought she would want to see her first building being demolished. Mary is keeping Jimmy calm as they set up and begin to install the explosives. As the countdown begins, Jimmy starts saying "Sam," and then screams her name and runs toward the building. Sam's father tells them to stop the countdown. At the roof, Jimmy looks down, and her father asks what they have done. Jimmy then throws himself over, killing himself, and lands next to Sam. Sam is then lifted out of the hole and put in an ambulance.  Sam narrates that Malestrazza built 27 buildings and that they are all still standing. He considered the Malestrazza building his masterpiece. The building will not be demolished.

The boys succeed in stealing the truck and they temporarily park the locked truck in a desolate area while they look for a purchaser for the stolen goods. David's father vows revenge against whoever stole from him. David is surprised that his father is so upset instead of just seeing the stolen truck as a business loss.   While the truck sits abandoned, Greg pursues Marta, a local Mexican woman, and the other two boys explore their attraction for one another.  The operation goes perfectly until some unidentified men vaguely threaten Marta.

Determined to get some profit anyway, they choose to return to the wasteland, take what they can from the truck, and then report its location to the traffickers via an anonymous call. When they unlock the truck's storage, they discover its unexpected cargo. Their rage and fear leads the situation to slip completely out of their control as they confront David's father and the police. One of them ends up being shot.  
Wangan Midnight (film)
 Whilst driving on Tokyo's [[Shuto Expressway]] in a [[Nissan 300ZX]], high school student Akio Asakura challenges the "Black Bird", whose driver is Tatsuya Shima, to an impromptu race despite having his friend, Ma, in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, but is defeated. Determined to drive a faster car, he follows his mechanic friend Ko-chan to a junkyard upon hearing a newer 300ZX model is available. While at the junkyard, he sees the scrapped body of a midnight blue [[Nissan S30|Nissan Fairlady Z (S30)]], equipped with a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 L and fitted with twin turbos. Attracted to it, he attempts to buy it but the junkyard owner, Kuro, refuses as Kuro was told by the previous owner to scrap the car because it is cursed. After telling Ko-chan that he remembers seeing this car a few years ago, they eventually agree to buy the car. Akio sells off his 300ZX to fund the purchase, much to Ma's exasperation.  When testing the car after its restoration on the highway, Kuro calls Ko-chan warning him that the Z Akio bought is the "Devil Z", a former Wangan racing car which is infamous by causing accidents, as if the car is rebelling against its driver. Despite this, Akio continues to spend time with it, eventually taking two part-time jobs to support his interest and being forced to repeat high school due to his lack of attendance. Eventually, his activities catch the attention of others like his new homeroom teacher Rumi Shimada who knows his obsession of cars with his absence due to it, and also Shima who raced against the Devil Z at the time of the Z's last accident two years previously, which killed the Z's driver (who was coincidentally also called Akio Asakura). They race, but Akio crashes into some roadworks after losing control of the car.  A couple of weeks after the crash, Akio meets Shima while working at his gas station, when he also meets Eriko Asakura, the sister of the deceased Akio and Shima's love interest. Whilst there, Akio issues a formal challenge to Shima once his Z had been repaired. On the same night of the challenge, Rumi comes to visit Akio wanting to ride with him in his Z. Akio however pleads her he cannot do so that night, preventing her from getting to know him better. After which, Akio, Ko-chan and Ma wait for Shima, along with Eriko. Reina Akikawa, a model, appears and shows her interest in cars as well. Akio invites Eriko to ride with him as he and Shima race, to prove that the Z is no longer like the Z her brother drove. Along with Ma riding alongside Ko-chan and Reina following, through the race Akio loses control again, but saves it from hitting the barrier.  Reina goes through a job switch to being an actress and learns from Akio on his passion to race. Knowing her poor social skills due to racing, she learns through others what her passion for racing is, even knowing her manager Yoshiaki Ishida whom she commonly lied to races as well.  Eriko, knowing Akio's address after convincing the gas station manager she is a sibling due to the name similarity, later visits Akio to tell him she is leaving for abroad, and requests for one last drive in the Z. When they reach Eriko's home, where Shima was waiting, Eriko steals the Z using the spare key she still owned from her brother. She then speeds towards the docks, with Akio and Shima in pursuit, with the plan to dump the Z in the bay. Akio manages to stop the Z just in time, with Eriko furious that she could not kill it herself. In the midst of this, Akio and Shima agree to one last race on Wangan to settle who is fastest once and for all. Akio, along with Ko-chan retune entirely the Z, while Shima sends his Black Bird to an expert to do the same. Akio's absence in school due to the retuning catches the attention of Rumi, who has hopes Akio will return to school soon.  Whilst racing, a disgruntled truck driver asks another up the road to "scare" Akio and Shima knowing of them as racers that bother the highway. When the cars approach this truck, the truck driver swerves in front of Shima, but Akio slows down so that the truck hits Akio instead causing him to swerve back. However, the Z mounts the inner curb and rolls after hitting the guardrail. Akio and Eriko, who was riding with him again, managed to escape the Z before it bursts into flames. Shima helps Akio up as they observe the burning wreck, which is viewable through the highway with Reina driving by and catching a glimpse, shocked.  The next day, Eriko leaves Japan to study in England. Whilst there, she receives a letter from Shima, telling her that things are settling down with Akio keeping the burnt out Z, and plans to race it once more. While the Z is being repaired, Akio finally attends school, albeit with injuries sustained from the crash and Rumi glad to see his presence. When Ko-chan and Ma arrive one day to Akio's garage, they see its shutter door partially open with sounds coming out of the garage.  In the post credits scene, Shima stops midway through a hospital corridor and hears the Z starting up. Smiling, he walks away with the on-screen message, "Z will be back".  
Walk and Talk (film)

Watchmen (film)
 Utilizing an [[Alternate history|alternative timeline]] and applying [[multiverse]] theory, the story exists in a nearly identical, but separate America, whilst slightly mimicking both historically significant time periods. Initially starting in 1939, during the fading [[Interwar period|Interwar Period]], The "[[Characters in Watchmen#Minutemen|Minutemen]]," a team of costumed crime fighters, formed in response to a rise in costumed gangs and criminals; this creation and timeline occurring prior to, and similarly covering the 1960s Vietnam Era through mid-1980s Cold War Era America, saw the rise of The "Watchmen" team formed decades later. Their existence and influence dramatically affected world events: [[Doctor Manhattan]]'s powers have helped the United States win the [[Vietnam War]], and given the [[Western Bloc|West]] a strategic near-peer parity military advantage over the [[Soviet Union]], which by 1985 threatens to escalate the [[Cold War]] into a fully committed [[Nuclear warfare|thermonuclear war]]. Additionally, the Comedian has suppressed evidence of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate Scandal]], allowing [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] to stand for, be re-elected, and serve multiple consecutive Presidential Terms. Owing to success in ending the War, dodging The Watergate Incident, and overwhelming support sees a full Repeal of the [[Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]].  Eventually, growing anti-vigilante sentiment sweeping the U.S. general public, coupled with a massive nationwide police strike, enables the passing of the Keene Act, deeming all "costumed adventuring" and "vigilantism" illegal. While many of the heroes retire, Dr Manhattan and the Comedian operate as government-sanctioned agents, and [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] continues to operate outside the law.  While investigating the murder of government agent Edward Blake, Rorschach discovers that Blake was the Comedian, and theorizes that someone may be attempting to eliminate former costumed heroes. He warns his retired comrades—[[Nite Owl|Daniel Dreiberg]] (Nite Owl II), Dr. Manhattan, and the latter's lover, also a former heroine [[Silk Spectre|Laurie Jupiter]] (Silk Spectre II). Dr. Manhattan ignores Rorschach, and Dreiberg is skeptical, but relays this information to vigilante-turned-billionaire [[Ozymandias (comics)|Adrian Veidt]] (Ozymandias), who also dismisses it.   Dr. Manhattan is at a press conference, a reporter proposes that Manhattan himself is giving people close to him cancer. As Manhattans ex-girlfriend enters the conference she reveals that she also has cancer. This outrages the conference and they surround Dr. Manhattan.   Following a backlash, Dr Manhattan exiles himself to [[Mars]], giving the Soviets the confidence to [[Soviet–Afghan War|invade Afghanistan]]. Rorschach's theory appears to be justified when Veidt narrowly avoids an assassination attempt, and Rorschach finds himself framed for the murder of a former villain named [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]]. When Rorschach is arrested, his identity is revealed to be Walter Kovacs, and he is sent to prison. Jupiter goes to stay with Dreiberg after breaking up with Dr. Manhattan. The two become lovers and decide to come out of retirement. After helping Rorschach break out of prison, Jupiter is confronted by Dr. Manhattan, who transports her to Mars. As he probes her memories, he discovers that she is Blake's daughter, and realizes the miracle of her life, created in spite of her parents' turbulent relationship. He then returns to Earth with her.  Investigating the conspiracy, Rorschach and Dreiberg discover that Veidt is behind everything. Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops off at the publication office of the ''New Frontiersman'', a [[right-wing]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]. Rorschach and Dreiberg confront Veidt at his [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] retreat. Veidt admits to being responsible for Blake's murder, Manhattan's exile, Rorschach's framing, and his own assassination attempt, which he staged to divert suspicion. He explains that his plan is to unify the U.S. and U.S.S.R. by destroying the world's main cities with exploding energy reactors generating a Radioactive Decay Signature similar to that produced by Dr. Manhattan. Rorschach and Dreiberg attempt to stop him, but Veidt subdues them both and reveals that his plan has already been set into motion: The reactors already detonated, and the Decay Signatures are recognized as Dr. Manhattan's, leaving the world powers to assume he caused the attack.  Jupiter and Dr. Manhattan arrive in a destroyed [[New York City]] and determine that Veidt is responsible. They [[Teleportation|teleport]] to his base, causing him to retreat and attempt to kill Dr. Manhattan. Unsuccessful, he shows them a televised news report in which Nixon states that the two superpowers have allied against their new "common enemy": Dr. Manhattan. Although his allies realize that revealing the truth would only disrupt this new peace, Rorschach refuses to compromise, and attempts to return to the United States to expose Veidt. Dr. Manhattan intervenes and complies with Rorschach's demand to kill him to keep him from revealing the truth.  Dr. Manhattan shares a final kiss with Jupiter before departing permanently to another galaxy, while an enraged Dreiberg attacks Veidt, who makes no effort to defend himself. Nevertheless, he defends his actions, claiming that for world peace to be possible, there had to be sacrifice. Dreiberg rejects his logic declaring that Veidt has deformed and mutilated humanity. Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, an editor of the ''New Frontiersman'' tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on. The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of crank mailings, among which is Rorschach's journal.

Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says there is no need for Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.  Yogesh is impatient, but Devu keeps the bride a secret. When she enters, Yogesh cannot tell who she is. When the ceremony ends, Devu welcomes the father of the bride: Sanjana's father. Yogesh is stunned when his grandfather brings the money to pay Jitu's debts. He asks Devu how he arranged the marriage; Devu explains that when Sanjana followed him and showed him a picture of her boyfriend, he remembered seeing the boyfriend kissing another woman in Khandala.

Whatever Works
 Boris Yelnikoff ([[Larry David]]) is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] chess teacher and former [[University of Columbia|Columbia]] professor in quantum mechanics. [[Divorce]]d, he avoids human contact except for his friends ([[Michael McKean]], Adam Brooks, [[Lyle Kanouse]]) and students, patronizing everyone he meets for not matching him intellectually. He spends much of the film washing his hands, all the while singing the "Happy Birthday" song—an attempt to gauge the proper length of time for the process.    Boris comes home one night to find Melody ([[Evan Rachel Wood]]), a simpleminded 21-year-old, lying on his doorstep. He reluctantly lets her in for a meal and soon she tells him her story. She turns out to be of a distinctly [[Southern United States|Southern]] background, having been born to [[religious fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] parents in [[Mississippi]] and ran away from them. She asks if she can stay the night, which Boris eventually allows, and she stays with him while she looks for a job. Melody develops a crush on Boris despite their age difference and their varying cultures and intelligence.  Melody finds a job as a dog walker while still living with Boris. Out on the job, she meets Perry Singleton ([[John Gallagher Jr.]]) and they arrange a date. When she comes back home, she explains to Boris that she ultimately did not like Perry because he loved everything in the world too much. Boris realizes that he loves her and they get married.  After a year passes, Melody's mother, Marietta ([[Patricia Clarkson]]) finds Melody, explaining that she and her husband John ([[Ed Begley Jr.]]) thought Melody had been kidnapped. She goes on to tell her that John left her and sold their house after John lost money in the stock market. She meets Boris and is disappointed with him, so she tries to persuade Melody to end her marriage. The three go for lunch at a restaurant and meet Boris's friend Leo ([[Conleth Hill]]). As Marietta goes to use the restroom, Randy Lee James ([[Henry Cavill]]) inquires about Melody. Marietta slyly decides to recruit him to end Melody's marriage. Later that evening, Leo, who had taken an interest in Marietta, asks her over for dinner. They spend the evening together, and discover that she is a talented photographer. Leo makes plans to contract her professionally.  Boris explains to the audience that over the next few weeks Marietta changed and started experimenting in artistic photography, exotic new habits, and having an [[open relationship]] with Leo and his business partner, Morgenstern ([[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]]). Marietta still hates Boris and continues to arrange for Melody to marry Randy. She takes her to an outdoor craft market and "accidentally" runs into Randy, who questions her about her marriage. Melody initially sees past Marietta's attempt and tells him that her marriage is fine. She warns her mother to stop at once, but Marietta keeps trying. Later, shopping for clothes, Melody meets Randy in another planned encounter and he gets her to admit that her relationship with Boris is not entirely satisfying. He invites her to the boat he lives on, and the two end up kissing and beginning an affair.  John arrives at Boris and Melody's home full of regret and hopes to get the family back together. They all go to Marietta's photography exhibit opening together, and he sees how his ex-wife has changed since she moved to New York. Distraught, he retreats to a bar, drinking away his misery. While there, he meets a recently divorced gay man, Howard (Christopher Evan Welch), and admits something that he has known most his adult life: that he is also gay.  Melody tells Boris she is in love with Randy. Boris is devastated and jumps out a window again, but this time lands on Helena ([[Jessica Hecht]]), breaking her arm and leg. As he visits her in the hospital, he asks her if there is anything he can do to make it up to her, and Helena says she would like to go to dinner with him.  Finally, Boris hosts a New Year's Eve party, at which everyone is seen in their new relationships: Marietta with Leo and Morgenstern, John with Howard, Melody with Randy, and finally Boris with Helena. Melody and her parents have completely shed their former Southern [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] mindsets and wholeheartedly adopted the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[New York City]] way of life and values. (John tells that his former membership in the [[National Rifle Association]] had been but a sublimation of his repressed [[homosexuality]].) They are now all the best of friends, and at midnight they kiss. Afterward Boris is revealed to be the only one who is able to communicate with the audience, and explains directly to them that one has to find all the enjoyment he can, to find "whatever works".

Welcome (2009 film)
 The film tells the story of Simon Calmat (Vincent Lindon), a French swimming coach who is divorcing his wife Marion (Audrey Dana). Simon tries to help a young Iraqi-Kurd immigrant, Bilal Kayani (Firat Ayverdi), whose dream is to cross the [[English Channel]] from [[Calais]] in France to the United Kingdom by any means possible to be reunited with his girlfriend Mina (Derya Ayverdi). Meanwhile, Mina's father strongly opposes Bilal's plans as he wants to marry his daughter to her cousin who owns a restaurant. After being caught with other immigrants and returned to France, Simon gives him temporary refuge at his home after the young Bilal, nicknamed "Bazda" (runner, for his athletic abilities and love of football and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in particular) registers for swimming lessons, intending to train to be able to swim across the Channel. After police search Simon's apartment, Bilal goes on a final attempt and drowns 800 meters from the English coast while hiding from the coastguard. Simon then travels to inform Mina.  
Well Done Abba
 The film tells the story of Armaan Ali ([[Boman Irani]]), a Muslim driver working in [[Mumbai]], who takes a one-month leave from his employer to find a groom for his daughter Muskaan ([[Minissha Lamba]]), who lives in a village near [[Hyderabad, India]]. Armaan does not turn up for three months, and his employer makes the difficult decision to sack him, but he asks his boss to listen to why he could not come. Getting soft, his employer allows him to drive to Pune where he has a meeting. Armaan starts the story from here.  In Armaan's village, many problems include a rising drought situation and financial difficulties due to the antics of his twin brother, who has a bad reputation for debt addiction and theft. In the opening, a man named Arif demands 500 rupees from Armaan. Eventually, Muskaan pays the debt to Arif and Armaan's brother is arrested, later on released. To solve the drought problem, he goes to a government office to build a well, with a friend. There, he goes through stages such as explaining what he wants and even having his photo taken. Muskaan, on the other hand falls in love with Arif, of which Armaan does not approve at first but later is pleased with.  Armaan does not receive the well he wanted and sits in despair. He and Muskaan try to tell the police inspector about the well that was 'stolen', but the inspector finds the story rather silly and is even stubborn enough to not listen to what they have to say. Disturbed, Armaan and Muskaan launch a protest with several villagers against the police inspector, later on to the justice minister, where the minister punishes the inspector for his slack behaviour. The inspector, realising his mistakes and behaviour, then starts to approach the people in a more orthodox way. The justice minister then allows the government people to build the well for the villagers and punishes them all for not doing what they are supposed to do.  With the drought problem solved, Armaan decides that Muskaan should marry an Arab [[sheikh]]. Muskaan does not accept her father's offer and even has an argument about this. The issue is even more heated when she receives a letter from her friend, Sakina, which involved her getting beat up by her sheikh husband and getting kicked out, shocking Armaan and Sakina's mother. Disturbed, Armaan then decides that Muskaan should marry Arif, much to her delight. With the two of Armaan's problems solved, he ends his story at an awards ceremony, which in his perspective was a 'big drama', as the stage literally collapsed, delighting people. With his employer convinced, he then allows Armaan to work for him again.  
Where the Wild Things Are (film)
 Max, a lonely eight-year-old boy<ref>[http://warnerbros2009.warnerbros.com/assets/screenplays/wtwta_screenplay.pdf WBshop.com - The Official Online Store of Warner Bros. Studios] </ref> with an active imagination whose parents are divorced, is wearing a [[wolf]] costume and chasing his dog. His older sister, Claire, does nothing when her friends crush Max's [[snow fort]] with him inside during a snowball fight. Out of frustration, Max messes up her bedroom and destroys a frame he made for her. At school, Max's teacher teaches him and his classmates about the eventual death of the sun. Later his mother, Connie, invites her boyfriend Adrian to dinner. Max becomes upset with his mother for not coming to the fort he made in his room. He wears his wolf costume, acts like an animal, and demands to be fed. When his mother gets upset, he throws a tantrum and bites her on the shoulder. She yells at him and he runs away, scared by what transpired. At the edge of a pond, Max finds a small boat that he boards.  The pond soon becomes an ocean. Max, still in his wolf suit, reaches an island. He stumbles upon a group of seven large, monstrous creatures. One of them, Carol, is in the middle of a destructive tantrum caused by the departure of a female Wild Thing named K.W. As Carol wreaks havoc Max tries joining in on the mayhem, but finds himself facing the suspicious anger of the Wild Things. When they contemplate eating him, Max convinces them that he is a king with magical powers capable of bringing harmony to the group. They crown him as their new king. Shortly after, K.W. returns and Max declares a wild rumpus, in which the Wild Things smash trees and tackle each other.  The Wild Things introduce themselves as Carol, Ira, Judith, Alexander, Douglas, the Bull, and K.W. Soon, they pile on one another before going to sleep, with Max at the center. Carol takes Max on a tour of the island, showing him a model he built depicting what he wishes the island looked like. Inspired by this, Max orders the construction of an enormous fort, with Carol in charge of construction. When K.W. brings her two [[owl]] friends Bob and Terry to the fort, a disagreement ensues, as Carol feels they are outsiders. To release their frustrations, Max divides the tribe into "good guys" and "bad guys" for a dirt clod fight, but Alexander is hurt during the game. After an argument between K.W. and Carol, K.W. leaves once again.  Max finds Alexander alone in the fort. Alexander reveals that he suspected that Max is not a king with magical powers, but warns him to never let Carol know. At pre-dawn, Carol throws another tantrum — this time, about the fort, K.W.'s absence, and the eventual death of the sun, which Max talked with Carol about earlier. When Carol gets angry with Max for not doing a good job as king, Douglas tries explaining that he is "just a boy, pretending to be a wolf, pretending to be a king", exposing the truth to the rest of the Wild Things. Carol becomes enraged and rips off Douglas's right arm, though only sand pours from the wound. Carol chases Max into the forest and attempts to eat him. Max is saved by K.W., who hides him in her stomach. Max listens as Carol and K.W. argue over Carol's behavior.  Max finds the crushed remains of Carol's model island and leaves a token of affection for him to find. Max finds Carol and tells him he is going home because he is not a king. The other Wild Things escort Max to his boat. Carol runs to join them after finding Max's token and arrives in time to see him off. He starts to howl and Max howls back, then all the other Wild Things join in. Carol looks at K.W. and she smiles kindly at him. Returning home, Max is embraced by his mother, who gives him a bowl of soup, a piece of cake and a glass of milk and sits with him as he eats. He watches as she falls asleep.  
Whip It (film)
 Bliss Cavendar ([[Ellen Page]]) is a misfit in the small town of Bodeen, [[Texas]], with no sense of direction in her life. Her mother, Brooke ([[Marcia Gay Harden]]), a former beauty queen, pushes her to enter beauty pageants despite her lack of interest. During a shopping trip to Austin with her mother, Bliss encounters three [[roller derby]] team members and finds herself intrigued by the sport in which teams and players are given pun names that highlight the violent aspect of the sport. Intrigued, she and her friend Pash ([[Alia Shawkat]]) attend a roller derby bout under the pretense of going to a football game, where they see the "Holy Rollers" defeat the "Hurl Scouts", a perennially unsuccessful derby team.  Returning to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Bliss lies about her age and tries out for the Hurl Scouts, discovering her natural skating abilities in the process. Joining the team, Bliss is given the [[derby name]] "Babe Ruthless." After realizing she needs to be unmerciful in roller derby, Bliss sees she needs to take charge in other aspects of her life. One involves Bliss's love interest, a lanky young rock guitarist and singer named Oliver ([[Landon Pigg]]) whom she meets via her exposure to roller derby. They enjoy a whirlwind romance before Oliver leaves for a tour, taking a T-shirt Bliss gave him to remember her by, in exchange for his jacket. She later finds a picture of him at a gig with another girl, who is wearing her T-shirt. She burns his jacket in retribution and subsequently breaks up with him following his return, although he vehemently denies that anything happened.  Another sub-plot examines Bliss's relationship with her parents, a loving but controlling mother and an amiable but clueless father ([[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]) who seldom opposes his wife's parental decisions. After seeing her excelling and enjoying roller derby, Bliss's father convinces her mother to let Bliss out of a pageant (which is at the same time as the championship roller derby game) and convinces the Hurl Scouts to come get Bliss for the bout. Various other sub-plots include her relationship with Pash, and confrontations with a stuck up snob at school. Pash is fine with Bliss's new path, until she gets arrested with an open container of beer while she is waiting for Bliss, who has left to go find Oliver. Eventually, Pash gets together with their manager and forgives Bliss. The movie ends with the Hurl Scouts narrowly losing the championship match and everyone finally getting along; the team chants "We're number two!" which was the same thing they chanted when they lost their first match.  
Where Got Ghost?
 The film is made up of three omnibus horror tales laced with Singaporean humour. In sequence, they are ''"Roadside Got Ghost"'', ''"Forest Got Ghost"'' and ''"House Got Ghost"''.  
White Material
 Maria Vial is a [[white people|white]] [[French people|French]] farmer who runs (with her ex-husband, Andre, and his sickly father) a failing [[coffee]] [[plantation]] in an unnamed African country in the present day. Maria and Andre have a lazy, mentally unstable son, Manuel, while Andre has another half-African son, Jose.  Civil war has broken out and rebel soldiers, many of them [[child soldiers]], are advancing on the area. The French military, while pulling out, makes one final plea for Maria to leave, but unyielding in her desire to protect her family's home, she ignores the warnings.  Meanwhile, a rebel DJ on the radio urges the rebels on and advocates attacks on emblems of colonialism.  Maria's workers flee for fear of the upcoming conflict.  Maria stubbornly refuses to abandon the plantation and its harvest, which will be ready in five days.  Risking her life and unable to find Andre, she drives to a village to hire men to finish harvesting the coffee. On the way, she is forced to pay off bandits who threaten to kill her at a roadblock. After hiring the workers, she stops at the elementary school and collects Andre's other son, Jose.  Jose is an upbeat boy of about 12, and we later learn that his mother is Andre's father's young housekeeper.  Meanwhile, we see Andre in town meeting with the African [[mayor]], Cherif.  Cherif seeing that Andre is desperate, takes advantage of the situation and offers to purchase the plantation for the cancellation of Andre's debts.  Cherif requires Andre to get his father to sign over the coffee plantation to him.  Having returned to the plantation, Maria searches out her son Manuel and finds him in bed after midday.  Trying to rouse him, she laments his listlessness and scolds that he is without purpose.  Manuel rises, and after a swim, is intrigued by a noise in the house.  He follows it to two young rebels. They run, and in spite of his lack of shoes, Manuel follows them far from the home. They eventually corner him; he discovers that they're armed with a spear and a machete.  The rebel boys threaten him, cut his hair, and retreat to the bush, firing shots from a revolver. Maria, Andre, and some workers converge on Manuel and are shocked to find him stripped and standing naked in the field.  The fact that the oldest boy stuck his revolver down Manuel's pants, as well as his state of shock, the dirt on his hands and knees, and his later over-reaction, suggest he may have been raped off camera.  Maria loads him in the tractor and heads back to the house.  Manuel, obviously traumatized and out of his mind, abandons the tractor and goes to his grandfather's home.  There the heavily tattooed Manuel reacts to his assault by shaving his head, stealing his grandfather's shotgun, attacking Jose's mother, and disappearing on his mother's motorbike.  Despite Andre's continued pleas that they should flee, Maria remains steadfast in her efforts to bring in the coffee crop.  She discovers the wounded rebel hero known as 'The Boxer' in a barn and feeds him.  As night falls the workers bed down and Maria falls asleep dreaming of an earlier evening where we see her discussing Manuel with Cherif in what appears to be a romantic situation fueled by [[marijuana]].  Cherif warns her that her son is 'half-baked', a statement which makes her laugh.  She awakens and attempts to start work again.  However, the radio issues reports that the Boxer is being harbored by the "foreigners" and that loyal citizens should oppose them. Her workers, hearing this, demand to be paid immediately.  Upon threat, Maria opens the safe to find that the money is all gone, likely taken by Andre to secure passage out of the country.  The workers demand to be driven back to the village.  Maria agrees and starts driving them back.  Before they can reach the village they are stopped by a band of young rebels who appear to be wearing her clothing and jewelry.  The rebels demand the truck and, when a worker protests that they are just poor villagers, the rebels shoot him and drive off leaving Maria by the roadside.  Maria discovers they have looted the [[pharmacy]] and killed the doctor and his assistant.  Driving the truck down the road the rebels are pursued by Manuel who tells them that he knows where the Boxer is, and leads them back to the plantation.  He is clearly mad as he assists the rebels to loot his own family's food store.  The rebels and Manuel gorge themselves on the food and then ingest the many pharmaceutical products which they have stolen.  Almost all then pass out in and around the house.  Government troops then retake control of the area.  They slip onto the plantation grounds, immediately in front of Andre's father who calls out no warning to anyone inside.  We see the troops move from room to room, slitting the throats of the rebels who are passed out from the orgy of food and medication.  Government troops then lock the gun-toting Manuel in one of the farm buildings and burn him to death.  Andre is shown dead on the floor of the house holding the family passports.  In the town Maria is overwrought, she is seeking a way back to the house when Cherif sees her and gives her a ride. At the plantation Maria finds Manuel's charred body. Andre's father is shown walking around the barn where Manuel was burned. Maria clubs Andre's father to death with a piece of timber, presumably seeing him at least partly responsible for the death of her son. Another reason may be the fact that Andre's father had promised Maria that she would inherit the plantation, but has broken the promise this very day by selling the land to Cherif, the mayor. Since Maria's ex-husband, who was instigator of the sale, has already been killed, his father is the only one in the family left to be punished.  At the end, we see one rebel leaving the area with the wounds to his head.  He carries the beret of the Boxer.  He tucks it into his trousers and continues into the countryside.  
White Lightnin'
 Jesco White ([[Edward Hogg]]) is the last of the [[West Virginia]] mountain dancers. He is the son of D. Ray White ([[Muse Watson]]), the greatest mountain dancer of all time. Ever since Jesco was a child, D. Ray tried to keep him on a straight path—one that would put him on the right hand of the Lord. Dancing was just one way to keep Jesco from losing his soul. But from a young age, there was temptation drawing him away from D. Ray, away from the dancing. There were the voices in his head, tormenting him. Maybe that’s why Jesco loved to get high.  Hooked on [[inhalant abuse|sniffing gas, glue, lighter fluid, airplane cement]], Jesco was constantly finding himself in trouble with the law. He landed in the [[reform school]] more than once, and it was here that he spent most of his adolescence, left to endure the horror of the voices.  Years after his time in reform school, Jesco had made the best of staying true to his daddy’s word. He tried to stay as straight as he could, and used the dancing to do so. But the devil has his ways too, and soon Jesco was back to his old vices. On his way around the south, dancing and performing in whatever local dives he could, Jesco met the woman of his dreams—four foot three inch Enid Carter ([[Carrie Fisher]]). Jesco renames her Percilla. An off-beat pair, the two managed to keep all their wickedness inside the family.  Long and Davie—the two men responsible for dragging D. Ray years earlier behind their pickup until he was dead, are released from prison because of a trial error. It was as though God were testing Jesco again, tempting him with the taste of revenge. And so this temptation is satisfied, and Jesco got the revenge he craved, brutally torturing and murdering the two. After accidentally killing the officer who comes to arrest Jesco, he takes to the woods. Jesco hid himself in the cabin deep in the West Virginia hills previously inhabited by the preacher, whose voice Jesco constantly hears in his head. Jesco encounters God, cutting and chopping himself until he dies to expiate himself of his sins.

Whiteout (2009 film)
 In 1957 a Russian cargo plane is flying above [[Antarctica]]. In the cargo hold, three [[Russians]] sit with a padlocked box. The co-pilot leaves his seat and goes into the cargo hold, then begins to shoot the other men, who return fire. The chaos caused by the gunfight leads to a crash which kills all aboard.  In modern times, newcomers arrive at the United States' [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] in Antarctica, while  others who are scheduled to leave are preparing to do so early because of a storm. They must depart before the onset of winter or remain for six months. [[United States Marshals Service#Deputy U.S. Marshals|Deputy U.S. Marshal]] Carrie Stetko ([[Kate Beckinsale]]) has been working in Antarctica for two years, since a betrayal by her partner in [[Miami]] that killed him and nearly killed her. She plans to retire after returning to the United States in two days.  Stetko, her friend Doc ([[Tom Skerritt]]), and pilot Delfy ([[Columbus Short]]) fly in a [[de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter]] (Turbo Otter) to the remote [[Haworth Mesa]] to retrieve a discovered body. The dead man is Anton Weiss (Marc James Beauchamp), one of a group of three scientists looking for meteorites. An [[autopsy]] finds evidence of murder by ax. A murder requires a federal investigation; Stetko considers sending the body to [[McMurdo Station]] to avoid spending another winter in Antarctica, but decides to continue the investigation. When Stetko goes to speak to one of the others at [[Vostok Station]], she finds him dying from a neck wound and is herself attacked by a black-clad man with an ax. Stetko injures her hands in escaping, losing the wet skin of her fingers on the metal handle of a door. Later, she finds Robert Pryce ([[Gabriel Macht]]), a [[United Nations]] security agent, examining the body of the second scientist. They conclude that the third, who is missing, must be the killer and set out to explore the group’s most recent search site. There, Stetko falls through the ice to find the old Russian cargo plane. Pryce and Delfy join her to investigate, and they realize that the locked box had been opened and six cylinders removed. Pryce reveals that it is possible that [[nuclear fuel]] of interest to [[arms traffickers]] may be in the cylinders.  After nearly being trapped by a cave-in at the plane, Stetko must have her badly [[frostbite|frostbitten]] fingers amputated by Doc. She then finds the missing scientist hiding in her office. He tells her that he and his two companions found the plane and took the canisters, but the killer has them now. Before Stetko can protect him he is killed, but Carrie captures his killer, who is revealed to be Australian biologist Russell Haden ([[Alex O'Loughlin]]). The base commander orders everyone to evacuate because of the murders. With Haden locked in the brig and the winter storm near, Stetko and Pryce search for the canisters. However, Haden manages to escape and starts pursuing Stetko and Pryce. The three end up outside the base while the winter storm happens, and just when Haden corners, and is about to kill, Carrie, Pryce arrives and cuts Haden's safety rope and he is dragged onto the base's wall as a result of the storm's heavy winds, fatally smashing his head in the process.  Stetko checks the last departing plane's cargo manifest and learns that the bodies of the dead scientists were not aboard. She searches their body bags and notices that the stitching on Weiss's old wound matches the distinctive pattern on her amputated fingers. Stetko explores the body and finds several bags of large, uncut diamonds. Doc confesses that he was part of a diamond smuggling ring with the others before Haden killed the rest. He had hoped that the diamonds would make him wealthy outside Antarctica. When Doc tells Stetko he wants to see the [[aurora australis]] one last time, she allows him to walk outside to his death.  Six months later, Stetko, Pryce, and Delfy have wintered at the facility. She transmits an email to her superior, rescinding her previous resignation and asking for a warmer location for her assignment.

The White Ribbon
 The memories of an unnamed elderly tailor form a [[parable]] from the distant year he worked as a village schoolteacher and met his fiancée Eva, a nanny. The setting is the fictitious [[Protestant]] village of Eichwald, Northern [[German Empire|Germany]], from July 1913 to 9 August 1914, where the local pastor, the doctor and the baron rule the roost over the area's women, children and peasant farmers.  The puritanical pastor leads confirmation classes and gives his pubescent children a guilty conscience over apparently small transgressions. He has them wear white ribbons as a reminder of the innocence and purity from which they have strayed. When under interrogation his son confesses to impure touching, the pastor has the boy’s hands tied to his bed frame each night. The doctor, a widower, treats the village children kindly but humiliates his housekeeper (the local [[midwife]], with whom he is having sexual relations) and also sexually abuses his teenage daughter. The baron, who is the lord of the manor, underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. After his young son is abusively injured by unknown assailant(s), he summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason, yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son in a symbolic act has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages.  The schoolteacher's friendship with Eva leads to a visit to her family home during a Christmas break; asking for her hand in marriage, he receives from her taciturn father a reluctant permission to marry, but only after a one-year test-period delay.  Unexplained harmful events occur. A wire is stretched between two trees causing the doctor a terrible fall from his horse. The farmer's wife dies at the sawmill when rotten floorboards give way; her son was the cabbage-field vandal, and her grieving husband later hangs himself. The baron’s young son Sigi goes missing on the day of the harvest festival and is found the following morning in the sawmill, bound and badly caned. A boy with Down syndrome goes missing and is found nearly blinded. A barn at the manor burns down. The baroness tells her husband that she is in love with another man. Shortly after the pastor has singled-out and mortified his daughter in class, she opens his parakeet's cage with scissors in hand; the pastor finds the bird on his desk, cruelly impaled in the shape of a cross. The steward's daughter claims a violent dream-premonition about harm coming to the midwife's handicapped son, then the boy is attacked and almost blinded, found during a night search along with a well-written note quoting [[Ten Commandments|Exodus 20:5]]. The steward at the baron's estate thrashes his son for violently stealing a flute from Sigi.  The midwife urgently commandeers a bicycle from the schoolteacher to go to the police in town, claiming that her son has said he knows who attacked him. She and her son are not seen again; meanwhile the doctor and his family have also suddenly disappeared, leaving a note on the door indicating his practice is closed. The schoolteacher's growing suspicions lead to a confrontation in the pastor's [[rectory]], where he suggests that the pastor's children and students had prior knowledge of the local troubles and insinuates that they likely perpetrated them.  Offended, the pastor berates him and threatens to report him to the authorities if he repeats his accusations.  The film ends a few days after World War I [[World War I|officially begins]], with the final scene occurring in Sunday church on the day of a visit from the narrator's prospective father-in-law. Disquiet remains in the village, with no explanation of the violent events. The narrator is eventually [[Conscription in Germany|drafted]], leaving Eichwald, never to return.

Having realized that she has fallen in love with Rath later, they continue to find ways to see each other.  Ultimately, Thida's parents find out and attempt to separate the two by marrying Thida to a man. She and Rath run off together the day of the wedding and are pursued by the enraged fiance. He confronts Rath and brandishes a gun. He takes aim and shoots Rath, killing her. Devastated by her lover's death, Thida ends her own life with a gunshot. Her parents' plea to save their daughter from suicide was done in vain.

Wishology
  === "The Big Beginning" === Timmy makes a wish to star in his own movie trilogy (In parodies of ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[Harry Potter]]''). He is interrupted by Jorgen, who takes his fairy godparents away and sends Timmy home. When he gets there, Timmy's parents and school friends don't remember him, and an Eliminator appears after Timmy calls out his own name. In an alley, the Eliminator projects a space vortex through its mouth to inhale Timmy. Jorgen saves him, and the two arrive at Fairy World. Meanwhile, the fairies are hidden as gumballs inside a truck stop bar by Jorgen. After being blown into a bubble from a kid's mouth, Cosmo takes Wanda and Poof with him as he floats away. The rest of the fairies use Cosmo's method as their escape plan.  At the Cave of Destiny, Jorgen explains to Timmy the cave prophecy, where in ancient times fairy warriors, represented by stars in space, fought and eliminated The Darkness with light. The ancient fairies also hid a powerful white wand, which is to be found and possessed by the chosen one, Timmy Turner. As stars in space disappear and The Darkness approaches, Timmy arrives back on Earth and tracks his godparents down in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where the Middle-Aged Rock Festival (M.A.R.F.) is held. The M.A.R.F. features the rock band  [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], who reveal to Timmy that they are the galactic protectors of the white wand, which is their star-shaped guitar. The Darkness and Eliminators arrive at the venue, and the fairies arrive to defeat Eliminators while Timmy defeats The Darkness with a rock solo performance on the white wand. A celebration follows at Fairy World, where Turbo Thunder, the person who was supposed to be the chosen one, appears and takes the white wand from Timmy.  === "The Exciting Middle Part" === Eliminators and The Darkness invade Yugopotamia—a planet that is home to squid-like aliens called Yugopotamians—and steal "fake-i-fiers", belts that allow users to transform into anyone else. Yugopotamian prince [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Mark Chang|Mark Chang]] goes to Earth. Meanwhile, in Fairyworld, Timmy and Cosmo are watching Timmy Turner's Chosen One movie. Mark arrives and notifies Timmy that The Darkness is back, and the group discovers that there is a second part to the cave prophecy: Timmy must find the second wand, located at the Blue Moon. Timmy and Mark teleport back to Dimmsdale, only to discover Timmy's parents and friends are now Eliminators in disguise. Because his real parents and friends have been kidnapped by Eliminators, Timmy seeks help from people who hate him: Mr. Crocker, Dark Laser, and Vicky. Setting their differences aside, everyone cooperates and boards Dark Laser's death pod and depart into space. During their rest stop at planet Frigidarium, the aliens inside the [[cantina]] are Eliminators who send Timmy's enemies to the Abracatraz Prison in Fairy World. Turbo Thunder saves Timmy and Mark from the corrupting planet, and the three eventually arrive at the Blue Moon, where the rock guardian grants Timmy the second wand.  Meanwhile, Eliminators incarcerate the fairies at the Abracatraz Prison and put Timmy's friends and family in the same cell with Timmy's godparents and Jorgen. After Poof frees the group and locates the wands, Jorgen takes everyone to the Blue Moon. Timmy's friends, enemies, family, and the fairies defeat Eliminators with a combined magical attack and have a reunion with Timmy, which is interrupted when The Darkness tries to inhale him. The second wand produces no effect, and Timmy realizes he has no other choice, so he sacrifices himself into The Darkness, after sharing a kiss with his long-term crush [[List of The Fairly OddParents characters#Kids|Trixie]], leaving the others to mourn.  === "The Final Ending" === Timmy wakes up in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, and the world is merely an illusion to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.  Timmy and his fairies return to the Blue Moon via M.E.R.F.'s escape pod to retrieve the second wand. A weakened Turbo Thunder reveals the second wand only opens underneath a secret cave, which contains magical wands and the final part of the cave prophecy: to find the ice wand. The group returns to Fairy World with the wands to free the imprisoned fairies before everyone heads back to Earth. The fairies arrive and use their magic to remove the Earth's metal casing. Timmy heads into space with the Destructinator following him; the Destructinator attacks him, which sends him back down to the Earth, at its north polar region. After Timmy [[Reverse psychology|tricks the Destructinator into inhaling the explosives]], he reveals that he stole the detonator remote from him back in space and uses it to obliterate him.  A polar bear—the guardian of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the [[Solar System]]. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes in front of them and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.

Wish 143
 David, a 15-year-old living in the Cancer ward of a children’s hospital, is asked by Dreamscape Charity representative for his biggest dream.  David states that he would like to lose his virginity before he dies.  The shocked representative attempts to talk David into meeting a celebrity, but David insists that losing his virginity is all he wants.  This statement creates a minor media splash, much to the consternation of a Priest in the hospital.  The Priest tries to convince him to have sex for love, while David insists "I don’t have time for love!"  David meets with his ex-girlfriend Amy.  During the visit Amy tells him that although she thinks of him often, she’s dating someone else.  She leaves a letter with him and leaves.  David stuffs the unread letter into his pocket and sneaks out of the hospital.  He goes to a red light district and attempts to solicit a prostitute.   The woman he approaches tells him to use the money to "buy something nice for your mother."  An upset David picks up bricks and starts throwing them at cars until he is arrested.  When the priest picks him up at the police station he asks him why he did it.  David responds "I wanted to see how low I could go." The priest finds the unopened letter from Amy and reads it.  In it Amy states that, while she is flattered by the proposition of having David lose his virginity to her, she feels like she cannot do it.  She continues by writing she hopes he gets better soon, and she’s sure that when he does she’ll find a nice girl who loves him.  The Priest knows what Amy does not, the cancer is spreading and "getting better" is not a possibility.  Later that night the Priest wakes David up and takes him via motorcycle to see a prostitute.  He tells her she is very nice and gently reminds him that he doesn’t have to do anything he doesn’t want to. While inside David nervously talks to the girl.  She asks him what he wants to do and he replies "I don’t know, what do you want to do?"  The girl smiles and states she has never been asked that before.  She takes off his shirt revealing several tubes and scars coming from his chest.  David explains that various treatments that he’s had.  She responds by showing him her own scar.  She tells him he’s handsome and asks if anyone has told him that. David replies people tell him how sick he is.  She touches his shoulder and asks him if anyone touches him.  David replies he is only touched by doctors who are checking vital signs. David asks the girl to lie in bed and hold him "that’s all that I want."  David cries while she gently holds and comforts him.  The Dreamscape Charity representative returns and asks again if there are any wishes that David wants.  A much more contented David says he doesn’t need anything.   The representative smiles and tells a story about how the charity arranged for a kid to meet an entire sports team, but at the last minute the kid changed his mind and instead used the van to go on a fishing trip with his uncle.  The representative wishes him luck and leaves. In the end, David realizes he has found the love of friendship with the Priest who has been helping him, and they spend a day together clay pigeon shooting.

Wonder Woman (2009 film)
 In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]], battled [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son [[Thrax (mythology)|Thrax]], whom Ares [[rape|forcibly conceived]] with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]] stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, [[Hera]] bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the [[psychic]] aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood.  Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, [[USAF]] [[Colonel]] [[Steve Trevor]], is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]]. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.  In the meantime, the Amazon Persephone, who has been gradually seduced by Ares, kills Alexa and releases him. With the additional task of capturing Ares, Diana brings Trevor in his repaired and now invisible jet to New York City, where he volunteers to help Diana on her quest. An investigation uncovers a pattern of violence created by Ares' presence that will lead to him given time, and the pair goes out to a bar while they wait. After some heavy drinking, Trevor makes a pass at Diana. They argue outside, but are attacked first by thugs and then the demigod [[Deimos (deity)|Deimos]]. Deimos is beaten and kills himself to prevent being interrogated, but Diana and Steve find a clue on his body that leads them to a concealed gateway to the underworld guarded by members of a still-extant ancient cult of Ares.  Once they have arrived, Diana attempts to subdue Ares, but he summons [[Harpy|harpies]] that attack her, prompting Trevor to save her instead of stopping Ares. Meanwhile, Ares performs a sacrifice to open a gate to the Underworld, where he persuades his uncle [[Hades (DC Comics)|Hades]] (who has made Thrax his slave) to remove the bracers, though Hades does not tell Ares that the ultimate cost of removing the bracers would be Ares' own death in combat. Later, Diana regains consciousness in a hospital and is furious that Trevor saved her rather than stop Ares. Trevor argues against her abuse with his own criticism of the Amazons' self-imposed isolation and their generalizations about men, and reveals how much he cares about her.  Ares and his dark army attack [[Washington, D.C.]]; Trevor and Diana arrive to battle Ares and are soon joined by the Amazons. While Ares manages to summon the Amazons long dead from the Underworld to fight their own sisters, his scheme is stopped by Alexa, a member of the undead host, who reveals to Artemis a chant which nullifies Ares's control over them. The undead then turn on Ares but are destroyed by his powers. Hippolyta faces Persephone in combat and kills her, but with her dying breath Persephone makes it clear that in shutting the Amazons away from the world of Man, Hippolyta has denied them happiness in attaining love and a family.  Meanwhile, the [[President of the United States]] is influenced by Ares's power and orders a nuclear missile against Themyscira, assuming the island nation to be the source of the attack on Washington. This act of supreme aggression greatly increases Ares's power, but Trevor takes the invisible jet and shoots down the missile just before it hits the island. After taking a brutal beating at Ares's hands, Diana finally outmaneuvers and beheads him. As Trevor arrives back at the scene, Diana finally accepts him, and the two share a kiss. Ares is condemned to the underworld to attend Hades as a slave alongside his son.  Later on Themyscira, in memory of Alexa but with severe difficulty, Artemis takes up the hobby of reading. Hippolyta realizes that Diana misses both the outside world and Trevor, and to make her happy again, she gives her daughter the task of being a channel for 'communication between men and women'. Diana accepts and returns to New York, where she enjoys the company of Trevor. Their relationship comes with the understanding of her larger duties, such as when Diana sees [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] robbing a museum and she excuses herself to stop the supervillainess as the newly christened [[Wonder Woman]].

Women Without Men (2009 film)
  The film begins with the sound of [[Adhaan]]. A woman is standing on the rooftop contemplating jumping. She jumps in slow motion. Flashback. Munis does not want a husband. Her tyrannical brother, Amir Khan, wants Munis to prepare for a visiting suitor and demands that she cook dinner for them. When she scoffs at the idea, he gets angry, and threatens that if she leaves the house he will break her legs.<ref name="NYTimes"/>  Protests fill the street. People are chanting ''"Durood bar [[Mosaddegh]], marg bar Englis"'' (''"Long live Mosaddegh, Death to Britain"''). A second woman, the religiously observant Faezeh (Pegah Ferydoni), joins Munis and they discuss the protests. Faezeh calls the protestors "a bunch of ne'r do wells". Munis suggests that they themselves should be outside protesting. Faezeh, who secretly longs to marry Munis' brother, asks if it is true that he is getting married to someone else. Munis nods her head, ''yes.''   A prostitute, Zarrin (Orsi Toth), puts on makeup. A male client gets up and dresses. As Zarrin washes her face, a brothel Madame is calling out her name. Zarrin curls into a corner and begins to sob, as the Madame continues to yell that there is yet another customer.  Another man appears in Zarrin's room. Surrealistically, in Zarrin's point-of-view, he appears to be "faceless."  Zarrin rushes out of the brothel, the Madame calling after her.   In the next sequence, a wealthy 50-year-old woman named Fakhri (Arita Shahrzad), arrives at a military event where her husband Sadr, a general, is being honored. They get into a marital dispute about another officer, an old flame, who has returned to Tehran and with whom she has been seen talking. Sadr tells Fakhri she is getting old and that if she is unable to satisfy him sexually, he'll get another wife. Crying, she says she is tired of him and leaves.<ref name="NYTimes"/>    Faezeh and Munis are in the garden of Munis' home, gossiping about the woman that Munis' brother is planning to marry. It is suggested that the fiancee may not even be a virgin. Munis' brother shows up and they get into another argument.   Zarrin the prostitute is at a bath house. She is wearing a ''long'' (a traditional Iranian piece of cloth used to cover the body in a public bath). A female ''dallak'' (a person whose job is to help people wash themselves in a public bath) offers to aid her but she refuses. When Zarrin opens the robe to bathe, her gaunt body and protruding ribs are revealed. She proceeds to scrub her body vigorously, so hard that her skin becomes raw and bleeds.<ref name="NYTimes"/>   Faezeh and Amir Khan find Munis, apparently dead, in the street. She seems to have jumped from the roof while they were getting ready, after Amir unplugs her only connection to the outside world, the radio. On discovering her body, Amir curses her for disgracing him and buries her in the garden as Faezeh looks on.<ref name="NYTimes"/>   A  group of women in black [[chador]]s are mourning. Zarrin, in a white flowered chador, walks by, scowling. She continues walking until she comes to a group of men in [[sujud]] during prayer. She defiantly stands in front of them until they rise. She then scampers away into the night. Zarrin walks until daybreak onto a dirt road, and the rivulet from the beginning of the film appears again. She walks into the river, leaving her chador behind.   The military wife, Fakhri, arrives at a restaurant where her old flame is having a sociopolitical discussion with a group of artists. When they are alone, the young man recites some poetry to her. He tells her she seems sad, upon which she reveals that she has decided to leave her husband, Sadr. In the next scene she is being driven along the dirt road. She steps out of the luxury car and arrives at the gate. A man (the same one who was seen stroking Zarrin the prostitute) opens the door. He says that he has been waiting for her. He takes Fakhri to a beautiful, quaint villa house, a mystical retreat which she buys. The interior, while luxurious, is filled with dust. Fakhri examines the house. There are books and instruments, but the place is covered in cobwebs. She walks into the garden and looks into a river, where she sees Zarrin lying unconscious. Fakhri calls the man for help and he carries Zarrin into the house.   Faezeh is with an old woman with divine powers whom Faezeh has approached to cast a love spell on Amir Khan. While in Amir Khan's house following the seer's instructions, in a magical realist trope, Faezeh hears Munis' voice beckoning from the ground. Munis tells Faezeh that she can no longer breathe, and Faezeh digs her out of the ground. Munis then walks into the [[howz]] and immerses herself in the water.   Munis, who was a virtual prisoner in the house even when controlled by her tyrannical brother, goes out to a cafe to listen to the radio, Faezeh following her. Noticing two men gazing at her, Faezeh quickly walks away. The men follow Faezeh.  Munis walks out to find Faezeh curled up into a ball and crying after she has been raped, and takes her to the garden. Walking through the trees, Faezeh prays to God to forgive her "sin". She follows some singing and arrives at the cobweb house, where she finds the military wife.  She tells her that she has lost her way and asks for water. She then sees Zarrin, the prostitute, lying on a bed.   The next sequence shifts to a street in [[Tehran]]. Munis begins a second fantasy life as an independent woman working with an underground Communist group.<ref name="NYTimes"/> She becomes infatuated with a young man who is telling people to band together and fight injustice. He shouts, ''"Long live freedom!"'' as he scampers away to avoid authorities. Munis asks if he is a member of the [[Tudeh Party]]. As he leaves, he gives her a pamphlet, saying he hopes to see her again. A crowd is in the street shouting the same slogans as before. The crowd is wearing white, and Munis, now standing among them, is wearing a black chador. She says that this time, she is here, ''"Not only to look, but to see. Not only to be, but to do."''  Faezeh is praying. Noticing the gardener outside her window, she rushes to close it, darkening the room. Flash to a dark dreamscape where Munis is calling Faezeh's name. In this surreal sequence filled with abstract voices and music, she watches herself lying on the ground helpless, as the two men rape her. Nightmarishly, Faezeh in the nightmare flashback, appears to be smiling. Faezeh awakes at Fakhri's cottage of refuge, in a bed next to Zarrin's. Faezeh walks out of the house without her requisite chador, her long hair flowing down to her shoulders. She arrives in a fantastic field of red flowers.   A meeting occurs among members of the Tudeh Party, including the young man Munis met earlier. An announcement is made that the British government has declared Mosaddegh's government illegal and plans to stage a [[coup d'etat]]. That night, they distribute flyers under doors. During the day, people continue to protest. A man is speaking on a megaphone, claiming the [[Shah]] has run away, but the danger of a coup is still imminent.   We return to Fakhri's mystical house of refuge, where Faezeh and Zarrin are recuperating. Fakhri announces she wants to ''"open the garden doors"'' and have a party. Faezeh likes the idea, but Zarrin doesn't. Later that night, a tree mysteriously falls through one of the windows. Zarrin is lying in some greenery outside, scowling. Munis' narration: ''"The garden is turning. Under this great weight, it seems sick. Now, there is no way back, and no peace."''  A different group of protesters, shouting out, ''"Javid Shah"'' (''"Long live the Shah"'') collide with Mossadegh's supporters. Gunshots ring out. Munis is seen among Mossadegh's supporters. She is no longer wearing a chador.   The gardener walks into the house, carrying Zarrin, who has fallen ill again. Fakhri tells him to put her in her bedroom, as she is preparing the living room for the party. The party guests arrive. A man recites ([[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]]) poetry. People drink, ''"to the health of the Shah's rule."'' Amir Khaan arrives and witnesses Faezeh tending to Zarrin, the prostitute. Amir asks Faezeh what has happened to her [[hijab]] (head covering) and who are these dubious people he thinks she has surrounded herself with. He questions Faezeh's faith, and queries whether or not she still prays. Amir tells Faezeh that he has now come to take her hand and not to worry about his other wife, who will act as a servant to her. Faezeh replies, ''"And perhaps when you get tired of me I will serve your third wife".'' Faezeh leaves in anger. Police arrive, inquiring about the home's owner. The police search the place, and then later are invited to sit down to a grand dinner. The guests ask the police which dissidents they are searching for (the Tudehs, or Mossadegh's supporters). A guest replies, ''"It doesn't matter. Opposition is opposition. We are all Shah-supporters here".''   The next scene is a Tudeh marriage gathering, a celebration which may be a front for their covert publishing activities. Munis is in a back room where a political discussion is ongoing. One of the Tudehs has been taken by the police and they are discussing whether he will talk under torture.   At the garden party, a soldier is praising his country to a foreign guest. Her fiance (Fakhri's old flame) thanks Fakhri and asks her to sing. Faezeh sits with Zarrin, who is sweating profusely. The police raid the place.  At the same time, the Tudeh publishing room and wedding party are also raided. The captured Tudeh, a young man, also arrives with the police. He has been battered and bruised. Munis's friend gets in a scuffle with a young soldier, whom he kills with a knife. Munis cries over the soldier's body.   Back at the garden party, Faezeh, crying, walks into the room where Fakhri is singing. Fakhri realizes that Zarrin has died. Fakhri quietly makes her way to Zarrin, touches her forehead, and weeps over her body. Munis narrates ''"Death is not difficult. It is imagining it that is difficult. It seems that what we were all looking for, was finding a new shape, a new way towards freedom."'' Munis falls from the rooftop in slow motion once again. There is no mistaking that the party is a last hurrah for a kind of social and political freedom that is now long gone.<ref name="NYTimes"/>

X-Men Origins: Wolverine
 In 1845, [[Wolverine (character)|James Howlett]], a boy living in [[Canada]], witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper [[Thomas Logan]]. The [[anxiety]] activates the boy's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutation]]: bone claws protrude from his knuckles and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James' birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas' other son [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor Creed]], who is thus James' half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the [[American Civil War]], both [[world war|World War]]s and the [[Vietnam War]]. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to [[execution by firing squad]], which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major [[William Stryker]] approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in [[Team X (comics)|Team X]], a group of mutants including [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]], [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]], [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]], [[Blob (comics)|Fred Dukes]] and [[Chris Bradley]]. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's lack of [[empathy]] for human life causes Logan to leave.  Six years later, Logan is working as a logger in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend [[Silver Fox (comics)|Kayla Silverfox]]. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, he realizes that Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with [[adamantium]], a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.  Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor is still working for Stryker, hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory, located at a place called "The Island". Fred mentions [[Gambit (comics)|Remy "Gambit" LeBeau]], the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location. John and Logan find LeBeau in [[New Orleans]], then both fight Victor, who kills John and extracts his DNA. Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured, Gambit takes Logan to Stryker's facility on [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station|Three Mile Island]]. Logan learns that Kayla is alive, having been forced by Stryker into surveilling him in exchange for her sister's safety. However, Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service, claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation. Stryker activates Wade, now known as Weapon XI, a "mutant killer" with the powers of multiple mutants.  While Logan and Victor join forces to fight off Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the captive mutants to [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] and safety. After Logan kills Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets, rendering Logan unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed. Logan regains consciousness but has [[Retrograde amnesia|lost his memory]]. He notices his dog tags read "Logan" on one side and "Wolverine" on the other. He pauses upon noticing Kayla's body, but does not recognize her and leaves the island.  In a mid-credits scene, Stryker is detained for questioning by some [[military police|MPs]] in connection with the death of his superior, General Munson, whom Stryker had murdered to protect his experiment. There were two alternate post-credits scenes that were shown at different screenings. One post-credit scene reveals a surprise twist on the fate of Weapon XI / Deadpool where he is revealed to have survived his decapitation. The other post-credit scene shows Logan in Japan where he tells a barmaid he is "drinking to remember."  
Wyvern (film)
 The small Alaskan town of Beaver Mills is located just north of the [[Arctic Circle]], meaning that the sun does not set during the summer solstice. As the town prepares for its annual celebration of this event, a [[wyvern]] is awakened by the melting of the ice caps, and attacks a fisherman. Jake ([[Nick Chinlund]]), a handyman fixing the cafe where a waitress named Claire ([[Erin Karpluk]]) works, hurts his hand and David ([[David Lewis (Canadian actor)|David Lewis]]), the town's doctor, examines it. While driving back to town, David is attacked by the wyvern. The next morning, Sheriff Dawson (John Shaw) and Jake hear gunshots and find Haas ([[Barry Corbin]]), a redneck attacked by the wyvern. Colonel ([[Don S. Davis]]), who has seen the Wyvern, goes to town to warn the citizens; but they disbelieve him, and he goes to kill it. Dawson radios to his Deputy Susie ([[Elaine Miles]]) to watch the town, but fails to convey his meaning. Dawson finds his friend dead, and returns. At the town, the wyvern kills Susie and several other people. Jake, Claire, Haas, and the eccentric Edna ([[Karen Austin]]) take shelter in the cafe. Later, Vinyl ([[Tinsel Korey]]), who runs the town's radio, and Farley (Simon Longmore), another citizen, hide in the cafe. Sheriff Dawson is killed by the wyvern. Jake and Claire track the wyvern into the woods, where they find the Colonel, and discover the wyvern is killing anyone on the Interstate. Farley is injured trying to get supplies. The wyvern then uses David, still alive, as bait to draw people from the cafe. Jake goes to rescue him, and Farley distracts the wyvern to save them, but is eaten. David tells the group the Wyvern has eggs, and dies of his injuries. The survivors decide to electrify the nest, but the wyvern kills Haas. Jake takes a truck left on the side of the road and, using the eggs as bait, kills the wyvern. Jake, Claire, Colonel, Vinyl, and Edna try again to radio for help.

Walter is badly injured, but Nate rescues him from the truck before it explodes.  They follow Alex, and on the way, find an abandoned armored truck. Chavez tells Nate to check the cab of the truck. Nate finds a set of keys and a gun. He secretly gives the gun to Walter, after handing the keys over to Chavez. Chavez uses the keys to open the back of the truck, and finds several bags of money. He intends to steal the money and demands that everyone carry two bags, but Walter refuses because of his injury. In a last-ditch effort to regain control of the situation, Walter pulls out the gun and tries to shoot Chavez. Unfortunately, the gun is not loaded and Chavez shoots and kills Walter. Chavez forces those left alive to carry the money and they continue on foot.  Along the trail, they stumble upon a trap, set by Three Toes, Three Finger's son. They escape then catch the son and behead him, leaving a trophy on the spent booby trap for Three Finger to find as a deterrent. This enrages Three Finger, who sets traps for the group, killing first Willy, then Crawford.  Meanwhile, Sheriff Carver looks for Nate, and Deputy Lane sets out look for the missing group of rafters. Sheriff Carver finds the group but is killed by Three Finger. Chavez and Floyd get into a fist fight while Brandon watches, allowing Nate and Alex to escape.

They find the location where the [[Wrong Turn|watch tower once stood, only to discover it was burned down years ago]]. Floyd finds the money and attempts to run away with it, but he stumbles on some rocks and cries out. Chavez hears him and finds Floyd, only to see Three Finger lobbing a molotov cocktail at Floyd, killing him and burning all the money. Chavez gives Alex to Three Finger to improve his chances of survival. Three Finger drags Alex into his truck and drives off. He secures Alex at his house and goes back out to hunt the rest of the survivors. Nate wants to go after Alex, but Chavez threatens to kill him if he does. Fed up, Brandon knocks Chavez unconscious and lets Nate go. After waking up, Chavez finds Three Finger and fights him, but Three Finger overpowers and kills him.  Alex awakens in Three Finger's house and sees Deputy Lane die in a razor wire net. Nate finds Three Finger's house and frees Alex, but Three Finger attacks him. Alex saves him by stabbing Three Finger. Nate and Alex drive away in his tow truck, but Three Finger follows them, leaps on top of the truck, and causes them to crash into a tree. As the truck catches fire, Brandon appears and pulls Alex out. While Brandon helps Nate, Three Finger attacks them, but Nate apparently kills him with a meathook. Afterwards, a U.S. Marshal team arrives and rescues Nate and Alex.  Sometime later, Nate greedily returns to take the remaining money from the armored truck. Karma takes its toll and Brandon appears from nowhere and betrays him, shooting him in the back with an arrow. While Brandon takes the money, an unknown cannibal appears and brutally bludgeons him to death with a crude club.  
World's Greatest Dad
 Lance Clayton ([[Robin Williams]])  is a single father and high school English teacher whose biggest fear is that he will one day end up all alone. He dreams of becoming a famous writer, but his previous novels have all been rejected by publishers. His 15-year-old son Kyle ([[Daryl Sabara]]) is a pornography-obsessed underachiever who despises and is annoyed by everyone, especially his father.<ref name="sundance"></ref> Kyle is a student at the school where Lance teaches an unpopular poetry class. His only friend is Andrew, a fellow student who spends his evenings at the Claytons' house trying to avoid his [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother. Kyle's consistently poor academic performance and vile behavior gain the attention of the school principal ([[Geoff Pierson]]), who advises Lance that Kyle should transfer to a special-needs school. Lance is in a non-committal relationship with a younger teacher named Claire ([[Alexie Gilmore]]), who is spending time with a fellow teacher named Mike ([[Henry Simmons]]), whose writing class is more successful than Lance's. On nights when Claire cancels their dates and he is alone, Lance bonds with his elderly neighbor Bonnie ([[Mitzi McCall]]).  One night, after Kyle and Lance spend an evening with Claire, Lance discovers that Kyle has died in an [[autoerotic asphyxiation]] accident in his bedroom. To avoid embarrassing his son, he stages Kyle’s death as a suicide. He writes a suicide note on Kyle’s computer and hangs his son’s body in the closet. A classmate later obtains the suicide note from police records and publishes it in the school newspaper. The note strikes a chord with the students and faculty, and suddenly many students claim to have been friends with Kyle and are touched by how deep and intelligent he shows himself to be in his writings.  Enjoying the attention his writing is finally receiving, Lance decides to write and publish a phony journal that was supposedly written by his son before his death. Kyle becomes something of a postmortem cult phenomenon at the school, and soon Lance begins to receive the adoration that he has always desired. Andrew finds Kyle’s suicide note and journals as highly uncharacteristic based on Kyle's personality when he was alive, but Lance brushes him off when Andrew confronts him. The journal soon attracts the attention of book publishers and Lance lands a television appearance on a nationally broadcast talk show. The school principal then decides to rename the school library in Kyle’s honor.  At the library dedication, Lance starts to feel guilty for exploiting his son's death for his own benefit as well as hatred towards those who pretend to like Kyle when in reality they didn't. While giving a speech, Lance decides he can no longer continue the charade and confesses to everyone that Kyle's death was accidental, and that he wrote the suicide note and journal. Predictably, Lance is denounced by the students and faculty, including Claire; and at the same time finally realizes that it is better to be alone than to end up with people who make you feel all alone. Despite now being despised by everyone, Lance nevertheless feels reborn and dives naked into the school's swimming pool. Outside, Andrew tells Lance that he knew the truth all along, and that he enjoyed Lance's writing and encourages him to keep writing which Lance says he will. The film ends as the two happily watch a zombie movie with Bonnie.  
Wrong Turn at Tahoe
 Joshua and his boss, Vincent, are driving to a hospital. Both have been shot and are in pain. Joshua thinks back to his childhood, when his father was shot in front of his eyes.  In a flashback, Joshua and his partner, Mickey, visit people that owe money to Vincent.  They encounter a crazy druggie who tells them that a small-time drug dealer named Frankie Tahoe wants to kill Vincent. Joshua and Mickey inform Vincent, and the trio intimidate a guy who works for Tahoe into telling them where he can be found.  They find Tahoe at a nightclub. During a talk, Tahoe insults the religion of Joshua and Vincent, which they hold dear, and Vincent beats Tahoe to death with a baseball bat. The trio dump the body in a landfill. While doing this, Vincent reveals that Mickey and Vincent's wife have been having an affair. Vincent then kills Mickey.  While Joshua and Vincent are having breakfast, Joshua tells his boss that he has become weary of the violence and wants to retire. Vincent admits that he has violent outbursts but insists that Joshua owes him his life. Angered, Vincent says that Joshua cannot retire.  He leaves to go home, where he discovers two men watching his house. While confronting them, Joshua appears. The men tell Vincent that they have been ordered to deliver him to Nino, a powerful crime boss. When Nino calls his men, Vincent answers the cellphone. Vincent and Joshua get in the car and are driven to Nino's house.  After Nino taunts Vincent with a choice of restitution methods for killing Tahoe, all of them expensive, Vincent rejects every option.  Nino is insulted and walks away. Vincent and Joshua leave.  Upon arriving back at his house, Vincent finds that his wife has been brutally murdered. Vincent attempts to give Joshua $50,000 as severance and tells him to leave the city.  Joshua refuses and says that he will not retire while Nino is still alive. They wait until night and return to Nino's house to seek vengeance. While Joshua takes the downstairs, fighting his way through many of Nino's henchmen, Vincent goes upstairs and finds Nino, who has donned a bullet-proof vest and is waiting for him, sawed-off shotgun in hand. The fight is prolonged; Vincent is hit but survives, and Nino dies in a large pool of blood.  Meanwhile, Joshua engages in a hand-to-hand fight with one of Nino's men and finally strangles him, only to have another appear. As this man is about to slice Joshua's throat, Vincent shows up and shoots him, but the man does not die right away. Joshua identifies the wounded man as the one who killed Vincent's wife.  Vincent uses the man's knife to eviscerate him. While the two leave the house, Nino's wife appears. She and Joshua exchange fire and both are hit. The wife dies, but Joshua, who has been hit in the stomach, is able to walk away.   Back in the present, Vincent is driving the car and Joshua is in the back seat.  At that point, Joshua remembers that it was Vincent who murdered his father. Joshua places a handgun to the back of Vincent's head.  Vincent tells Joshua that he is too loyal to kill his own boss. The scene fades to black, leaving it unresolved as to whether Joshua pulls the trigger.

They try to buy the girls' freedom, but Cain ends up selling Zed and Oh. While being taken to a village by the owner with all the other slaves from their tribe, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodomites]] attack and take the slaves prisoner, though Zed and Oh escape and hide in the desert, watching the Sodomites.

They come to a mountain and find [[Abraham]] ([[Hank Azaria]]) about to kill his son [[Isaac]] ([[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]). Zed stops them, claiming that the Lord sent him to do so.

Inside the temple, Zed encounters Oh, who is hiding from the high priest ([[Oliver Platt]]). There, they get into a heated argument and are then imprisoned for going inside the temple. The two are sentenced to be stoned to death but Zed convinces the Sodomites to have mercy, so they are instead sentenced to hard labor until they die from work. The king then announces that he will be sacrificing his daughter and two virgins (Maya and Eema) as a gift to the gods.   Zed interrupts the ceremony, claiming he is the "Chosen One." A riot starts, Oh saves Eema and Abraham arrives with the Hebrews to overthrow the king. Oh and Eema [[sexual intercourse|lay with each other]] inside the palace, which not only consummates their relationship, but also means that Eema cannot be sacrificed. They then come out to help Zed fight the soldiers (including Cain). The crowd kills all the leaders and proclaims Zed as the Leader being the "Chosen One". Zed turns this down, letting Inanna rule, and instead becomes an explorer with Maya. Oh becomes the leader of the village where the whole adventure started. The two say their goodbyes and head their separate ways.  
Yavarum Nalam
 Manohar moves into a new apartment, 13B, on the 13th floor with his family, fulfilling his life's biggest dream. But they encounter a series of small but strange incidents (such as milk getting spoiled), which are regarded as inauspicious by his family but shrugged off by an excited Manohar. The elevator in the apartment works for everyone in the building except Manohar, which bothers him.  The women in the family get hooked onto a new TV show ''Yavarum Nalam'' (''Everyone Is Well'', or ''Sab Khairiyat'' in [[Hindi]]). The show is about a family eerily similar to Manohar's who have also just moved into a new house like they have. As the serial unfolds, Manohar notices that the incidents that happen in the serial are a reflection of what is happening to his family. Things like his sister graduating, his wife getting pregnant and later suffering a [[miscarriage]] are all also shown in the serial. Priya is saved by their longtime family friend and doctor, Dr. Balu. The rest of the family remains oblivious to the similarities and Manohar prefers it that way to avoid panic. He also notices that his camera takes distorted pictures of him while he is in the apartment, but not while he is outside the apartment.  Things start taking a turn for the worse in the serial and Manohar becomes terrified that the same might happen to his family. He now wants to know who is behind the making of the TV show. One day Manohar finds the blind man's dog trying to find something in the sand, Manohar stops the dog and takes it to its owner. Later that night he asks his wife about the latest episode of the serial, she reveals the same story to him. On this, Manohar digs the ground on a rainy evening and finds a diary. He then unravels a terrifying secret: the apartment they live in shared their address with a house where a family of eight (similar to Manohar's family) was butchered back in 1977. It was the family of a TV news anchor named Chitra. On the day of Chitra's engagement, an ardent fan (Shriram Shinde in the ''13B'' version) of Chitra wanted to stop the engagement and failed in doing so. Disheartened, he committed suicide. Subsequently, all members of Chitra's family were murdered with a hammer in a single day. The blame rested on the lunatic brother in the family, as he had been seen with the hammer last. The police officer investigating the case also committed suicide by hanging himself in the same house.  Manohar and his policeman friend Shiva meet the madman brother Senthil, who apparently goes crazy after seeing the TV show in an asylum. They then meet Chitra's former fiance Ramchandar, who tried to plead for Senthil's innocence because he got covered in blood while he hugged the bodies of his family. After researching one night, Manohar has a nightmare of the 13B murderer climbing the stairs to kill his family. When Manohar tries to climb the stairs, he always ends up on the 2nd floor. He goes to the hall and witnesses the climax of ''Yavarum Nalam'' when they are showing the murderer's identity: Manohar's face is shown as the killer.  What follows is the climax: the 13B murderer is Dr. Balu, who sees the family members' faces as the serial family members. It was he who killed them in the 1970s on behalf of his brother, the spurned fan, and also killed the police officer who caught him red-handed. Manohar kills Dr. Balu.  The story ends with Manohar living a normal life with a new dog in the family; the milk is not getting spoiled anymore. They bring Senthil home and the lift in the apartment finally works for Manohar. Next day,when Manohar uses the lift,he receives a call from Dr Balu, who says that while the 13B family haunts the TV, he haunts Manohar's phone. Finally the lift falls and Manohar plunges to his death.

After a series of slapstick combat scenes, the Doronbo trio flee back to their mecha to defeat Yatterwan. Cheering at their first victory, the villains accidentally hit the mecha's self-destruct button. When the chaos clears, a teenage girl emerges from the ruins with a blue object in her hands.  The Narrator (Yamadera) explains Gan Takada (aka Yatterman #1, Sakurai) and his girlfriend, Ai Kaminari (aka Yatterman #2, Fukuda), live a double life as crime-fighting heroes. They are based under Takada Toys, founded by Gan's father. Gan built Toybotty and Yatterwoof, the latter an abandoned plan from his father. The girl they found in the ruins was Shoko Kaieda (Okamoto), daughter of Dr. Kaieda (Abu), an [[archaeologist]]. The piece of blue stone Shoko carries is a part of the Skull Stone, a legendary object now split into four pieces. Dr Kaieda, who is on a quest to find them, is attacked in the forest of Narway by Skullobey (Takeguchi), a black-clad being with an oversized skull.  The Doronbo Trio is then introduced. The gang includes Doronjo, the sexy female boss; Boyacky (Namase), the clever but lecherous mecha genius; and Tonzra, the gluttonous, [[kansai-ben]]-speaking strongman. Skullobey sends them orders to find the Skull Stone pieces, and will punish them should they fail. The trio open a wedding store called "Doro Merry" to raise money to build a new mecha: the , a very feminine-looking construction. A robot skull arrives to deliver Skullobey's message: another Stone is in Ogypt, and the Doronbo trio must find it without losing Shoko. The skull self-destructs. Unknown to the trio, Toybotty witnesses everything and reports back to Gan and Ai. The duo transform into Yatterman and set off for Ogypt. When the group discover the missing piece, the villains arrive on the scene. They again use their mecha to damage Yatterwoof. After consuming a Mechanade thrown by Gan, the dog robot releases a swarm of ant robots which destroy the Bridesmaidiot, dragging Yatterwoof with it.  Back home, Gan tries to rebuild Yatterwoof while Ai, jealous of Shoko and Doronjo goes out for a walk. The trio receive another message that another piece of the Stone is in the Southern Halps. It is then revealed that Skullobey wants Doronjo for himself. Meanwhile, things around the world start to disappear, and before he can tell the truth behind the Skull Stone pieces, Toybotty, who has been analyzing the Stone, disappears, as well.  Ai discovers another scam by the villains, involving a sushi restaurant, to raise money for their new robot, a giant squid. She also overhears that the last piece is hidden in the Southern Halps. The Doronbo trio then set out in a Squid mecha.  Upon returning to base, Gan reads the analysis made by Toybotty before it disappeared: the Skull pieces, put back together, will destroy the flow of time itself, causing the disappearance of all things. The only way to stop this is to destroy the Stone when the pieces are reunited. The Yatterman duo set out with Shoko riding Yatterking, an upgraded Yatterwoof. The trio find the final piece. When the heroes arrive, Skullobey encases them in a giant dome filled with [[clockworks]]. Doronjo zaps Ai to force the Yatterman duo apart, only to finally discover the true love between Gan and Ai.  Shoko realizes Skullobey has possessed her father and due to her pleas, Dr. Kaieda is able to free himself from Skullobey and reveal his true form. Fighting as a unit again, Yatterman #1 and #2 team up with a reformed Doronbo Gang defeat Skullobey to trap him in the other world. Later, Gan and Ai bid Shoko and her father farewell, who leave to explore the world some more while the Doronbo Gang goes their separate ways.  However, they will gather, because their paths are reassembled into a single road.

Yoga Hakwon
 Hyo-jeong is a co-host of a shopping channel show lingerie. However, she loses her job to her younger, more glamorous, rival, and she also gets into a conflict with her boyfriend, Dong-hoon. Deciding to calm herself, Hyo-jeong heeds to an old friend, Seon-hwa's advice to take up [[yoga]] class for a week. Her yoga colleagues include the jolly but demented In-soon, the failing actress Yeon-joo, the troubled mother Yoo-kyeong, and the quiet Bo-ra. The class is taught by the cryptic instructor Na-ni, who states the following rules: 1. Not to eat, 2. Not to shower within an hour after training, 3. Not to communicate with the outside, 4. Not to look at mirrors, and 5. Not to go outside. Na-ni also informs the class that the owner of the yoga school, the former 1970s actress Kan Mi-hee, will join the class on the seventh day.  The five women are suspicious that something is amiss with the school and Na-ni herself. Nevertheless, they continue to undergo intensive training and even start to bicker with each other as they attempt to achieve [[Kundalini]] (the coiled "serpentine" energy) as promised by Na-ni. Meanwhile, Dong-hoon, who likes to watch Mi-hee's films during her heyday, tries to contact Mi-hee's frequent collaborating director, Kang Hee-joong, only to find him dead with his eye gouged out in his house. Recognizing Seon-hwa, whom he met just before he discovered Hee-jong's corpse, as Hyo-jeong's friend, he confronts her with Hyo-jeong's whereabouts. Refusing to answer, Seon-hwa heads down the street only to be hit by an incoming car. Dong-hoon finally contacts a janitor who formerly worked in Hee-jong's studio, learning that Mi-hee might have something to do with the death of her substitute in her final film, after she was fired.  Throughout the week the women start to break the rules: on the third day, Yoo-kyeong bathes less than an hour after training and In-soon eats a strangely prepared dinner. Yoo-kyeong is soon found lifeless with slash marks and black goo in the bathroom. Na-ni takes her in to treat her, but the latter is choked by Na-ni's pet snake. Later, Bo-ra lends Yeon-joo her mirror, and both of them are dragged by an unseen force on the fifth day. On the sixth day, In-soon catches Hyo-jeong calling Dong-hoon and tries to report it to Na-ni, but she receives her punishment for lawbreaking on the third day: she is revealed to have eaten her pet mouse's corpse which damages her skin, and she is dragged away by a black-clothed woman.  Becoming the only surviving pupil on the seventh day, Hyo-jeong meditates and gets glimpses of Mi-hee. She bolts away to find Mi-hee's corpse with snake-like skin and eye producing a snake. Hyo-jeong is knocked out by Na-ni, who then performs a ritual for Mi-hee to take Hyo-jeong's soul. Hyo-jeong, however, manages to escape and discovers her colleagues' dying bodies. As she works to get away from Na-ni, flashbacks reveal that Na-ni is an admirer of Mi-hee and wants to be exactly like her. She says that Mi-hee is a demon who trades Kundalini in exchange for souls. Stating that she cannot continue this anymore, Na-ni succumbs to her wounds inflicted by Mi-hee while Hyo-jeong escapes.  Hyo-jeong is able to reconcile with Dong-hoon. As she heads back home, she encounters her colleagues at the subway, all mysteriously alive. After a brief power failure, Hyo-jeong screams when all people disappear, leaving only posters depicting Mi-hee hanging on the walls.

The Young Victoria
  [[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria of Kent]] is the [[heiress presumptive]] to the throne during the last years of the reign of her uncle [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] and is subject to a political tug of war for influence over her. On the one side is her mother, the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], along with the comptroller of the Duchess's household, [[John Conroy|Sir John Conroy]], who tries to force Victoria to sign papers declaring a [[regency]] and giving him and her mother power.  On the other side is her uncle, [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]] of [[List of Belgian monarchs|the Belgians]], who wishes to use his influence through family ties to secure an alliance between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and his kingdom. He decides to have his nephew [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] seduce Victoria and he is coached in her likes and dislikes. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], to visit the household. Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other, despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by their uncle to win her favours. They begin writing to one another after Albert returns home.  At a birthday reception in [[Windsor Castle]], the King states his wish to be closer to Victoria and insults her mother. But when the King increases Victoria's income, this is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues her in front of her mother, heightening the animosity between them. The King then sends the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]] to advise her. Victoria agrees to make him her private secretary, and he appoints [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]] for her from political families allied to him.  King William dies after Victoria's 18th birthday, avoiding a regency. After accession, Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving into her own room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], she announces that "I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people". Victoria now moves into the recently completed [[Buckingham Palace]] and her aunt, [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen|Queen Adelaide]], advises her against giving in too much to Lord Melbourne's direction. Albert then comes to England to spend more time with Victoria. They bond more, dancing together during her coronation and later discussing together the condition of the poor. Albert hints at taking their relationship further but the self-sufficient Victoria resists and he leaves.  When Lord Melbourne loses a vote in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], the new Prime Minister designate, [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], wishes to replace some of her ladies-in-waiting with supporters of his own party and the queen refuses. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent [[Bedchamber crisis|crisis]] damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself.  Their marriage is loving and the birth of their first child helps heal the breach between Victoria and her mother, who had earlier sent a letter of support during the crisis. Nevertheless, Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness and Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to take on more duties. He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. As Victoria's primary adviser, he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. However, Victoria quarrels with him fiercely for going over her head with Peel in the matter of her household.  Soon after, when Victoria is fired upon by a would-be assassin as they are riding in an open carriage, Albert throws himself across her and is wounded. This bravery leads to their reconciliation and Melbourne advises her to share with Albert also her work for the social welfare.  The final [[title card]] sketches in their successful future until Albert's death at the age of 42.

Despite Sheeni's boyfriend, Trent Preston, they become romantically involved.

Jerry needs to return to Oakland and takes Estelle and Nick with him. Sheeni promises to arrange a job in [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]] for Nick's father, George, while Nick will get his mother to kick him out so he can return to Sheeni. Back at home, Nick creates an [[alter-ego]] named François Dillinger, a suave, rebellious troublemaker. Immediately after Nick makes the decision, Jerry dies of a heart attack. Under François' influence, Nick mouths off to his mom and her new boyfriend, police officer Lance Wescott. Nick takes Jerry's [[Lincoln Continental|Lincoln]], and crashes into a restaurant, which starts a fire. Lance agrees to lie and report the car stolen. In return, Nick must live with his father. In Ukiah, Nick phones Sheeni and tells her he had to blow up "half of Berkeley" to return. Sheeni's parents overhear this and ship her to a French boarding school in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], forbidding Nick ever to see her again.  In his new high school, Nick befriends Vijay Joshi, and they take Vijay's grandmother's car to visit Sheeni. After being allowed into Sheeni's room, Nick goes to the restroom and meets Bernice Lynch, Sheeni's neighbor, and claims Trent said terrible things about her. Bernice brings the matron to Sheeni's room and the boys flee. On the way home, the car dies and Nick calls Mr. Ferguson, his father's idealist neighbor, to come pick them up; he tells Ferguson that Vijay is an illegal immigrant whom Nick is trying to "free from persecution".  When he returns home, Nick meets Sheeni's older brother, Paul, who tells him that she will be returning home on Thanksgiving and invites him for dinner. Nick begins to send Bernice letters asking her to slip sedatives into Sheeni's drinks to make her fall asleep in class, thereby getting Sheeni expelled. Nick finds Lacey, George's 25-year-old girlfriend, Paul, and Ferguson, lounging in his living room, high on mushrooms, which Nick also ingests. George finds them and punches Ferguson, which results in Paul punching George. Lacey leaves the house to live with Paul. On Thanksgiving Day, Nick receives a call from his mother explaining Lance left and will not cover for Nick anymore. Nick goes to Thanksgiving at Sheeni's. Trent unexpectedly arrives and explains Nick's letters to Bernice; Sheeni is horrified and Nick leaves.  Nick steals his father's car to escape the police. He then removes his clothes and drives the car into a shallow lake in front of the police station. He buys a wig and a dress and impersonates one of Sheeni's "friends". He fools Mr. and Mrs. Saunders and goes up to Sheeni's room. Upstairs, Nick tells Sheeni that he understands what loneliness is like, and that everything he has done, including burning down Berkeley, destroying his parents' cars and having her sedated were all so that they wouldn't have to be alone anymore. Sheeni forgives Nick, and the two have sex, finally achieving Nick's dream of losing his virginity. Trent barges in, telling Nick he's brought the police with him. Nick beats up Trent and asks Sheeni to wait for him; Sheeni reassures him that he will only be in juvenile detention for three months.  The animated closing credits show Nick in jail with François helping him. When Nick is released, Sheeni shows up in a car and they drive away into the sky towards the Paris skyline, as various characters appear to make amends with the two and give them their blessing.

Tragically, when Quincey is 3, Miranda is killed in a car accident and Rawdon is left alone, unmoored, to continue life without the love of his life.      Fortunately Rawdon still has Quincey.  Staying as strong as he can he takes her to the roof of a skyscraper and explains that Mommy is now an angel.   It is up here that for the first time they see a vision of Miranda as an angel.     Rawdon continues to see visions of her. Initially these visions help him—at home she gives him advice about parenting; in Portugal she softens his hardness;  when he hides in the closet to isolate himself she snaps some sense into him and insists that Rawdon keep her mother, father and brother—Quincey's Grandparents ([[Jerry Hardin]], Diane Hardin) and Uncle Jack ([[Don Michael Paul]]) – firmly in Quincey's life.

You Might as Well Live
 On the advice of his childhood hero, Robert R. Mutt embarks on a madcap adventure to attain the three keys to being a "somebody" - a girl, some money, and a championship ring.  
Zombieland
 Two months have passed since a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] mutated into "mad person disease" that became "mad zombie disease" which overran the entire [[United States]], turning [[American people]] into vicious zombies. Survivors of the zombie epidemic have learned that it is best not to grow attached to other survivors, because they could die at any moment, so many have taken to using their city of origin as nicknames. Unaffected college student Columbus ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) is making his way from his college dorm in [[Austin, Texas]], to [[Columbus, Ohio]], to see whether his parents are still alive. He encounters Tallahassee ([[Woody Harrelson]]), another survivor, who is particularly violent in killing zombies. Though he doesn't appear to be sociable, Tallahassee reluctantly allows Columbus to travel with him. Tallahassee mentions he misses his puppy that was killed by zombies, as well as his affinity for [[Twinkie]]s, which he actively tries to find.  The pair meet Wichita ([[Emma Stone]]) and her younger sister Little Rock ([[Abigail Breslin]]) in a grocery store. The sisters are con artists, and trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons by pretending that Little Rock was infected by the disease, then steal their [[Cadillac Escalade|Escalade]]. The two men find a yellow [[Hummer H2]] loaded with weapons and go after the sisters. However, the girls spring another trap for them and take them hostage. Tallahassee steals his gun back and has a stand-off with Wichita, until Columbus lashes out in anger that they have bigger problems to worry about, resulting in an uneasy truce between them. The sisters reveal that they are going to the Pacific Playland amusement park in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], an area supposedly free of zombies. After learning his hometown has been destroyed, and his parents likely killed, Columbus decides to accompany the others to California. Along the trip, Columbus persists in trying to impress and woo Wichita.  When the group reaches [[Hollywood]], Tallahassee directs them to [[Bill Murray]]'s mansion. Tallahassee and Wichita meet Murray himself, uninfected but disguised as a zombie so he can walk safely around town (and play golf). Murray is killed when Columbus shoots him, mistaking him for a real zombie during a practical joke while watching ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' with Little Rock. Columbus realizes during a game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] that Tallahassee has not been grieving for his puppy, but rather for his young son. Wichita becomes increasingly attracted to Columbus, and Tallahassee bonds with Little Rock, with whom he was previously at odds. Despite Wichita's attraction to Columbus, she fears attachment and leaves with Little Rock for Pacific Playland the next morning. Columbus decides to go after Wichita, and convinces Tallahassee to join him.  At Pacific Playland, the sisters activate all the rides and lights and begin to enjoy the park, but also unwittingly draw the attention of all the zombies in the surrounding area. A chase ensues, and just as the sisters are trapped on a [[drop tower (ride)|drop tower ride]] called Blast Off, Tallahassee and Columbus arrive. Tallahassee lures the zombies away from the tower, creating a distraction for Columbus to get to the tower ride; both use the attractions to their advantage.

Zone of the Dead
  In 1986, in [[Chernobyl]], a mass grave of bodies is discovered, resembling victims of the Plague. The Chief of Bureau (Eugeni Roig) arrives at the scene and is informed that a man cut himself on a corpse’s ribcage and died of infection minutes after. Seconds later, that same man rises up and attacks them both.  Twenty years later, a local professor (Steve Agnew) is trying to catch a train out of [[Pančevo|Pancevo]], [[Serbia]], but finds that all railroads have been closed down as part of a [[military exercise]]. While he tries to make a call, a train comes in carrying a deadly biohazard agent monitored by a scientist in a [[hazmat suit]], who asks for permission to pass through. Before he can, a trio of drunken off-duty soldiers emerge and harass the station guard, taking his weapon and inadvertently rupturing the tank, releasing the chemical agent into the atmosphere. All the soldiers and the station guard are infected by the gas, becoming zombies, but the professor manages to escape.  Meanwhile, [[Interpol|INTERPOL]] Agent, Mina Milieus (Kristina Klebe) is tasked with transporting a mysterious prisoner (Emilio Roso) from Serbia to Belgrave while under the supervision of Agent Mortimer “Morty” Reyes (Ken Foree), an ex-[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent and on the verge of retiring, along with his partner, Inspector Dragan “Dra” Belic (Miodrag Krstovic). While Mina is in awe of Morty, she is also nervous as this is her first assignment in the field. Morty assures her that she will be fine, considering this to be the easiest assignment he’s ever had.  The Chief of Bureau meets with the [[President of Serbia|President]] and informs him about the accident at the train station in Pancevo. He discloses that the agent in the tank was capable of reanimating dead cells and advises that he not bother with evacuation, but contain the incident and let the [[Gendarmery (Serbia)|National Guard]] deal with the rest.  Back in Pancevo, a young reporter named Jan (Marko Janjic) is wasting his time at a minor concert, and is eventually convinced by his girlfriend Angela (Ariadna Cabrol) to leave along with her friend, Jovana (Iskra Brajovic). At the same time, the professor is trying to escape the growing number of infected. He comes across another escaped felon, Armageddon (Vukota Brajovic), who states the End of Days has arrived, and he has made it his personal mission to eradicate the zombies. The professor runs away and meets Jan and the girls, who allow him to come into their car.  The two INTERPOL vans arrive in Pancevo just as the driver, Petrovic, hits a zombie. When they go out to investigate, several more arrive, separating them from Agents Bottin (Vahidin Prelic) and Savini (Zeljko Sesta). They attempt to contact Headquarters for backup, but there is no signal. Upon finding the second van, containing the Prisoner, Morty finds Bottin and Savini are dead with more zombies coming. The Prisoner tells them to shoot the zombies in the head, which proves to be successful, but they are quickly overwhelmed: Petrovic is devoured and Dra is bitten on the hand. With little choice, they are forced to take shelter in a nearby abandoned police station.  While reconnoitering the area, Morty and Dra find the professor, Jan and the girls, and bring them back to the reception. The Prisoner attempts to flirt with Mina, but she rebuffs him, although she is put off by how he knew she was a rookie. Meanwhile, Armageddon continues his rampage on the zombies, using multiple weapons at his disposal. He enters a local TV Station and broadcasts his declaration of the apocalypse to Pancevo, including the station. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Morty decides to activate the generator and find a way out. Dra is unable to come with him and has begun to succumb to infection, resulting in Morty freeing the Prisoner and taking him along. After turning the power on, several zombies break in and nearly kill Morty, but the Prisoner saves him. Dra subsequently dies and reanimates, forcing Mina to shoot him. Jovana, driven insane by the turn of events, breaks down the barricade, allowing herself to be eaten. The professor also chooses death by Morty’s gun, as opposed to being eaten.  The group escapes and heads towards the river through the train tunnels. The Prisoner reveals to Mina that he knows of the zombies because his father was one of them, as a result of the incident in Chernobyl. He goes on to explain the President will most likely ‘cleanse’ the city to prevent the spread of infection. Upon arriving at the shipyards, they find a horde of sleeping zombies which are awoken by the Hazmat zombie. Morty leads the zombies away while the rest of the group makes for the boat. Morty runs out of ammo and gets trapped inside a train, while Jan takes the boat and abandons Angela. Just as she is about to be eaten, Armageddon arrives and supplies the group with weapons; Mina with a rifle, and the Prisoner with a broadsword. The three proceed to kill the zombies, while Morty escapes the train, taking a gun from the Prisoner and helping them out. Armageddon finishes off the undead and the Prisoner decapitates the Hazmat zombie, apparently ending the threat.  Later, the President announces that he will cooperating with [[NATO]] to bring all those responsible for the bioweapon to justice, much to The Chief of Bureau’s chagrin. The President considers his decision to be “a necessary evil” and expects the Chief to resign, effective immediately. Mina allows the Prisoner to leave, despite having some ammo in her guns, showing respect for him. Morty congratulates her on her efforts, in spite of the mission not being completed, saying he messed up his first one as well. Milo asks who the Prisoner was, to which Morty replies: “Nobody special.”  As they leave, Armageddon completes his prophesy, possibly answering Mina’s question: “And he shall raise his hands with the Sword of Vengeance. The Flaming Blade of the Lord’s Retribution. And his eyes were as a flame of fire… And he had a name written… which no man knoweth but himself.”  In the final scene, Jan has taken the boat up the river, only for it to run out of gas. As he heads to a cabin to look for more, the infected captain lurches out and tackles them both into the river.
